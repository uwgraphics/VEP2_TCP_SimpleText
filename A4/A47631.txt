A TREATISE Of the DIVINE PROMISES. In five Books.

In the first, A general description of their nature, kinds, excellency,
right, use, properties, and the persons to whom they belong.

In the four last, A declaration of the Covenant it self, the bundle and Body
of all the Promises, and the Special Promises likewise, which concern a man's
self, or others, both Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.

By EDWARD LEGH, Master of Arts of Magdalen Hall in Oxford.

Godliness has the Promises of the life that now is and of that which is to
come,

1 Timothy 4 8. Whereby are given unto us exceeding Great and Precious Promises,
that by these ye might be made partakers of the Divine nature,

2 Pet. 1.4. Having therefore these Promises, let us cleanse our selves from
all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holin^sse in the fear of GOD,

2 Cor 7.1. The second Impression corrected and enlarged by the Author.

TO THE RELIGIOUS, VIRTUOUS AND Every way Accomplished Lady, and his much
honored good Mother, the Lady RU^H'^ CUDAM^^E.
N^^le Lady, and my worthy Mother;
THERE are two chief reasons why I dedicated this Trea^ise of the Promises
unto your Ladyship First the excellency of the subject, with which I know you
are much affected, (...) My near relation and engagement unto your Self. I
deemed none fit to patronize such a work, but some noble Theophilus, or Elect
Lady; and to have sought a remoter Friend having one so near and proper, might
have bin construed folly. I wish the Book may give content unto your Self,
and others of Gods people, and then I doubt not, but the dedication of it unto
a Christian, and such As Paula and Marcella were to Jerome, so is your Ladyship
to those judicious persons, which resort unto you, a great Questionist, and
they to whom you propound your doubts do tam proficere quam prodesse, as well
benefit by you, as benefit you.
a Christian, will be approved. The knowledge of the Promises is necessary for
Christians, who do, or ought to live by faith, and therefore this Treatise (I
conceive) may be generally useful unto them both for the right performance of
holy duties, the exercise of divine graces, and likewise to uphold the soul in
all manner of distresses.

1 It will be very useful for the right performance of any good duty.

What better motive to and help for prayer, hearing, Quis virtute^ amp^ectitur

never stick to do any evil, he that believes not the Promis^s will never be
forward to do any good
reading, meditation, conference, etc. then to call to mind Gods gracious
promises which he has made to assist us in those services, and to accept them
rightly performed? but because I handle this point in the Treatise it self,
mentioning the special promises made to particular duties, I will here proceed
after another manner, and show, how there are Promises in Scripture for every
Commandment.

For the first Commandment

How many Promises are made to the true knowledge of God, Psalm 91.14. to the
true acknowledgement of God, Pro 6.3. to the love of God, Pro. 8.17. John
14.23. Cor. 8.3. John 16.27. to confidence in God, Ps. 125.1. Ier. 177, 8. Ps.
55.22. Esaias 40.31 Romans 5.5. Ps. 1^0.5, 6, 7. Esaias ^6.3. to the Fear of God,
Ps. 33.18. Ps 115.13. Ps. 111.5. Lu^^. 50. ^ro. 1.7. Pro. ^9.10, 11. Pro.
14.27. and 15 33. Pro 22 4 Ps 111.10. Pro. 10.27.

For the second, there is a promise annexed unto it, Exo ^0.6. Deuteronomy. 5.10. and
others likewise made in Scripture to all holy duties, as Iam: 4.8. and. Isa:
12.3. and specially to prayer, Rom: 8.16. Iam: 1.5. Reading, Pro: 1.23. Fasting
Man 6.18. Conference, Man. 3 16 17. Meditation, Ps: ^. 2.

For the 3 Commandment, there are many promises made to those, who glorify
Gods name, Ps. 50.23. Mat: 10.32 and 5.11. and 12.37.

For the 4 Commandment, See, Lev: 26.2, 3, 4. Esa 56.2 3, 4 5, 6, 7. Eze: ^0
12, 20. Esa 58.13, 14. Ier. 17.24, 25, 26

For the 5 Commandment, there is an express promise in it to that special
duty it injoyneth, Exo: 20.12. and in other places of Scripture, there are
promises to such as being elders in years give good example to their youngers,
and are teachers of good things, Esa 65.20, 22. Job 25.26, to good Princes,
Prove: 20, 28 and 29.19. 1 King. 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. Deu: 17.19, 20. to good
Ministers, 1 Pet. 5, 2, 3, 4, to the husband that is loving and kind to his
wife, Pro. 3^.10, 1^, 12. to the wife that is loving and reverend to her
husband, and wife and careful in the education of her children, Pro 31.28, 29,
31. 1 Timothy: 2.15 to good Masters, Pro. 5.33. Deu. 5, 18, Ephesians. 5.8, 9. to good
Parents, Pro. 10.1. and 23 24, 25. to obedient children, Ephesians; 6.3. Gen: 9.27.
of spiri^uall things, Col. 3.20 Ps, 117 8. Ier: 35.19. Pro: 1.9. and 6 23 24.
to Subjects, Ier. 29.7. Ro^. 8 13.3, 5. Pet. 2.15. to Servants Pro. 17.2. Col.
3.24. Ephesians. 6.8. to those which do honor the faithful Ministers of Gods word,
John 13 20. Mat. 10.41 to those that honor their Elders in years, 1 Pet. 5.5.
Luke 1^.1.

For the 6. Commandment, there are many promises in Scripture made unto those,
who shall seek to preserve the life of their neighbor, 1 John 4 12. Mat. 6.14.
Mat. 25.40. Pro. 25.21, 22. Mat 5* 7, 9. Pr. 14.29. and 16.3^. Iam. 1.4. Psalm
25.9. Proverbes 1^.20. Ps. 133.1. Luke 6.35, 37 Pro. 29.7, 22. and 21.3, 21.
Esa 3.^.1^. Eccl. 10.4. and also to the meek Mat. 5.5. Psa. 37.11. to the
gentle, and such as forgive offenses, Mat. 6.14, 15 Luke 6.27. to those that
are of a peaceable and quiet spirit, desirous of peace, 1 Pet 3.10, 11, 22. Pr.
20.22, to the peacemakers, Mat. 5.9. Pro 12.20 to the merciful, Mat. 5.7, 2
34. to those that are kind to their enemies, Luke 6.35.

For the 7 Commandment,

Chastity is a fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. and there are promises to it, 1
Cor. 6.19 Eze. 18.6, 9.

For the 8 Commandment, See Heb. 13.16. Mat. 5.7. Deu. 5.10. and 24.1^, 13,
19. Esaias 58.8. Eze. 18.^. Pro. 11.26. and 19.17. Pro. 21.^, 21. and 22 9. and
28.27. Ps. 14.5. Ps. 116.6 Mat. 6.4. and 10 42. Lu. 6.38 and 11.41. and 14.14.
and 18.22. 2 Cor. 9.10. Pr. ^.10. God promises a temporal and eternal
benediction to those that are righteous and bountiful to the ^core, Ps. 1^.5.
and 112.9. There are promises also to righteousness, or just dealing, Mat. 6.33.
Pro. 10. and 1^ 1. Pro ^8.^0. to the publik Magistrate that deals justly in
judgment, Pro. 16.12. and 25.5. and 15.27. and 28.16. to the private person
that deals justly, Deuteronomy. 25.15. to him that being just uses diligence in his
calling, Pro. 10.4. and 12.24.

For the 9 Commandment, See 1 Pet. 3.10. Lu. 6.37. Gen 1^.3. Pro. ^3.2. and
18.20. and 20.15.22. most ample goods are promised to those that speak the
truth from the heart, Ps. 15.9. Pro. 12.19 23.

For the 10 Commandment, See 2 Pet. 1.4. Mat. 5.8. Iam 4.5.6. 2 Cor. 1^.9.
Pro. 22.5, 11. Ps. 24.4, 5. and 3.^. Pro! 14.2^.

Thus graciously does God deal with his people, he might out of his absolute
sovereignty over us, command only, and we were bound then to obey; but he is
pleased (the better to quicken us to obedience) to annex these gracious
promises, to his righteous Commandments, and those that truly perform the
duty which he commands, shall undoubtedly receive the mercy, which he promises.

Secondly, this Treatise of the Promises, may be useful (I suppose) for the
quickening and exercising al holy graces. How does the sound knowledge and
frequent meditation of Gods sweet and precious Promises, strengthen Faith,
quicken hope, in flame zeal, confirm patience, and foster all the graces of Gods
Spirit? When we stagger through unbelif, and are tempted to doubt of any thing,
if we would have recourse to the promises, they would uphold us* as for
example, if this cogitation should arise in me, certainly if I do not as the
world does, I shall loose my credit, and never come to any wealth, or estate
like others, by and by I should rem^mber what is written touching this matter,
Sam. 3.^0. Mat. 6.33. and then consider the gen^rality and certainty of these
and other promises, and that would settle the soul.

Lastly, against all troubles ^nward, outward, painful, sinful, of soul, body,
good name, state, Faith in Gods promises is a sovereign Antidote; this is my
comfort in my affliction (says David) thy word (that is, thy promise made unto
me in thy Word) has quickened me, Ps. 119.50. He tells not what kind of
trouble he was in; in any trouble whatsoever, he received singular comfort by
meditation in the Promises: by Gods promises, adversity, sickness, poverty and
death of Friends are sweetened, we are upholden by them in time of temptation,
and in the pangs of death, receive consolation: Against all Evil that may
assail us, 3 things there are that we may with joy behold in the promise; 1
Protection, 2 Restitution, 3 Deliverance. Does the Lord permit us to
temptation? his grace is sufficient to support us, 2 Cor. 12 9. does he suffer
us to be overcome in temptation? yet promises he restitution, by a new act of
grace, raising us, and at length to set us out of the reach of all temptations.
In the defects of good things, and the small measures thereof, we may draw
comfort likewise from the promises. God promises, ^ Preservation, 2 Growth, 3
Perfection, of ^^ace and glory. If we enjoy a^y good grace of God, though
^^never so weak measure; first ^e assures us, that little is a ^ledge of more,
2 Cor. 1.22, ^econdly, even that little, he ^ill enable to get final victo^y,
Rev. 3.8. and will perfect ^t to the day of the Lord Ie^us, Phil. 1.6. and
after this ^ife make us pure as he is ^ure, perfect as our heavenly Father is
perfect.

Thus we see what Balm ^her is in Gilead, what sweet^es in Gods promises; they
are ^he Christians aqua vitae, to ^evive him, when he is ready ^o swound; in all
or in any estate be may extract abundance of comfort from that thrice precious
promise, Ps. 84.11. and those three heavenly conduits of sweetest consolation,
Rom 8.18, 28, 32. and if one or a few verses afford so much comfort, what
cordial sweetness and refreshing may a Christian suck, out of all those
wells and breasts of consolation and Salvation? Indeed the Faithful can never
want grounds of comfort. First GOD the Father is the GOD of all consolation,
Esa. 12.3.
comforting them in all their troubles, Esaias 66.11.
2 Cor. 3.4. Secondly, CHRIST is the Fountain of comfort, ver 5, Thirdly, the
HOLY GHOST (...) the Comforter of all the ^aithfull, ^oh. 14.16, 20. and 15
^6.7, 1 Fourthly, all the Scripture makes for their comfort, ^o. 1^.4. The whole
Gospel is a plentiful Storehouse of Comfort, called 1 Good or gladsom tidings
Esaias 9.3.^2.^ and a good word, Heb. 6.5. because it cheareth the heart, as good
news does him that is in heavines* 2 The Gospel of Peace, Ro^. 10.15. Ephesians
6.15. because it pacifieth a troubled conscience: but the very pith, marrow and
quintessence of all true consolation is contained in the Evangelicall promises,
Psalm 119.92. Thus assuring my Self, that your Lady ship will often peruse this
book, wishing tha^ your Soul may daily prospe^ by it, and that the LORD would
now fill you with all joy an^ peace in believing these promises, 3 Ep of John
2. Romans ^5.1*
and hereafte^ crown you with all happiness in the full fruition of the things
promised, I rest,

Your obliged Son and Servant, EDWARD LEGH

To the Christian Reader.
REader, as I desire thy Good by this Treatise, so let me crave thy favorable
acceptance of ^y honest intentions. This Golden Mine, and Rich Treasure of the
^romises, has not yet bin fully o^ened and displaied unto the world. Some that
have written of Faith have handled some of the Divine Promises, and other
little Treatises there are (I confess) al^eady extant concerning this very
^rgument. Far be it from me (who have made use of them all, and many other
worthy Writers for the compiling of this Treatise) to disparage the meanest of
them, who have written any thing of so excellent a Subject. But I dare appeal
to those who are judicious, and have read the Treatises out in that kind,
whether any or all of them have either yet methodically ranged, or fully
handled all the special Promises, both of which I have at least endeavored to
accomplish. I speak not this (as I said before) to derogate from them, nor yet
to arrogate an^ thing to my self, but rather to gi^^ satisfaction unto such who
will b^ ready to pretend, that others ha^^ written of this Subject, and
therefore this work of mine is needless. The Proverb says* Store (...) no
sore, and I think there is n^ great cause to complain of satie^ty in this
kind. Besides, I handl^ both the Covenant and Special^ Promises together,
whereas those who write professedly of the Covenant, say but little of the
Promises, and those who expressly trea^ of the Promises, say but little or
nothing of the Covenant. Furthermore, my method di^fers much from theirs, that
have labored in this kind; for they commonly in handling the Promises,
allege such and such Scriptures generally and in the lump. But I have in many
of the graces, and most of the duties, set down Promises, both of and to, as
Promises, 1. Of the grace. 2. Unto it. Promises 1. To enable to the duty. 2.
Also to accept and reward it: and I have often particu^ariz'd the things
promised; by ^anking and marshalling them in^o their several Heads, and
shew^ng distinctly the special Rewards whither Temporal, Spiritual, or
Eternal of such or such a grace, or duty. My chiefest motive and inducement to
publish this Work, next unto the promoting of Gods glory, was the benefit of
Christians, which fruit of my labors I have already promised to my self,
having both read Exhortations in books to the performance of such a work, and
heard complaints from Christians, of the want of such a work. If any should
demand, cui bono, for what use may such a Treatise serve, or what profit can
redou^d to Christians by it? I may answer with the Apostle, and say of it, as
he does of Circumcision, much every way. Romans 3.12
But I forbear to exemplify, or instance the particulars, since I have done it
already in the former Epistle, and the work it self will sufficiently show it.
O but may some say, this work would well have beco^e an experienced Divine
furnished with rich abilities of learning and piety: all that I grant, and had
it bin done by such a one, I should both have spared my own pains, and made use
of his most willingly. But since that is rather to be desired, the^ yet to be
expected, I (who abou^d with leisure) was willing to make this essay, both that
I might employ my own Pudeat illos (says Tully) qui ita in studijs se
abdiderunt, ut ad vitam communem nullu^ fructum proferre possint. Paulum
sepultae distat inertiae C^lata virtus. Hor l. 4. Carm. od 9 Trisle
mortalitatis privilegiu^ est, etc. Euphormio.
Talent, and gratify the desires of Christians. For their saks (though I must
expect several censures, according to the variety of men's humors) am I willing
confer aliquid in publicum, to cast in my mite into the common treasury. If
thou find faults and Errata in the book, let love cover them, for to err
(as the Satyrist says) is the sad privilege of mortality, and he (of all me^)
erreth most, who challenges a privilege from error. Thus praying to the Lord,
that thou may reap much good from these Promises, and promising to my self
no little comfort from thy prayers, I rest

Thy true Christian Friend and hearty well-wisher, EDWARD LEGH.

A TREATISE OF THE Divine PROMISES. The first Book. Book 1.

CHAP. 1. 1. The Nature of the Promises.
THERE are three things to be known in the Word: 1. Precepts or Commandments,
because, they teach obedience. 2. Threatenings, because they restrain
disobedience. 3. Promises, because they serve to confirm us in our Obedience.
Perkins on 2. Hab. 4.

Faith in the Commandments (says Dike) breeds obedience, in the Threatenings
fear, in the Promises Comfort.

The Greek words for Promise in the New Testament are, (...), which is tendered
in the English a Message, 1 Ioh. 1.5 of (...) nuncius, but most Usually a
Promise, Ephesians. 3.6. 1 Ioh 7.25. and often in the Galatians, it signifies
gratu^^am ultrenamque promissionem, a free and willi^g Promise, as both Budeus
and Beza have observed, and (...), 2 Pet... 4. which properly signifies a
Public Promise made is foro, before many, ab (...) id est, nunciare, edicere.

The Latin, 1. Promissien^ and promissi^ (whence comes the frenc^ word
promise, and the english promise) a pro and nutto, praemittitur enim
promissiorei praesiandae.

2. Pollicuum or pollicitatio, which also signifies a free Promise it comes
of polliceor, and that of porro and liceor. Pollicem^^ spoute, promittimus
rogati, says Ser^ius on Virg.

3. Sponsi^, from Spondere, quasi sponte dicere, says Scaliger.

Illyric. clav. Script.




Promise is oftentimes used in the New Testament both in the Singul^r, and
Plural number, especially in Romans 4.16. Gal 3.^8

As often as S. Paul compares the Law with the Promise, he makes a comparison
between the Law and Gospel Illyric. ubi Supra.


S. Paul's Epistles: it signifies by an excellency the Gospel it self, or
the promise of giving the Messiah, and free reconciliation with GOD by Him. It
is called by a Synecdoche (says Polanus) the Word, Psalm. 56.4, 10. In GOD will
I praise his Word, that is, his promise, says Iunius; and sometimes it is
taken by a Metonymie (as Beza and Piscator have observed) for the good things
promised, Promissio interdum idem vales quod res promissa Piscator.

Act. 1.33, 18, 19 and 7.17. and 26.7.


Gal. 3.14. the promise of the Spirit, for the Spirit promised, Acts 1.4. wait
for the promise of the Father, that is, the good promised, viz. the HOLY GHOST.
You are sealed with the Spirit of Promise, Ephesians. 1.13. that is, with the
Spirit promised. So Gal. 3.22. That the promise by faith of JESUS CHRIST, that
is, the thing promised, remission of sin and life everlasting. Heb. 10.36.
Ye have need of patience, that ye might receive the promise, that is,
eternal glory promised. Heb. 6.12. Who through faith and patience inherit the
promises, that is, See Heb. 9.15. and 11.9, 17, 3^, 39.
life promised by a Metonymie, 2 Timothy 1.1. It is called the Promise of Life,
for life promised.

A Promise is a revelation of some such truth, The definition of a Promise in
general.
as shall be beneficial to me in particular. The truth of such a promise
consists in the certainty of performance, the goodness of it in the quality of
the thing promised.

Promise is 1. A word, passed from man to man, for performance of some lawful
things; as in contracts, bargains, marriages, and other aff^ires of common
life. This is a civil promise: Such a one Laban made to Jacob, for giving his
daughter, David to Jonathan.

2. Our word passed and given unto GOD, for some duty which we will do unto
his honor, Psalm. 66.13, 14. I will pay thee my vows which my lips have
promised Number. 30.2. He shall not break his promise. This is a religious or
holy Promise, called a vow in Scripture.

3. The Word of God given unto men, for the performance of some good, or for
removing some evil, Spiritual or Bodily, Psalm. 119.103. How sweet are thy
promises unto my mouth? and verses 38, 49. This is a divine Promise. Of these I
purpose to treat: and the divine Promises are thus defined.

The Promises are declarations of GODS favor toward Man, and of his
providence over him for his good.

Or thus.

The Promises are all those declarations of GODS will, Promissio Dei est
denunciatio suturorum honorum nobis dandorum, u^ ex ea consolationem habeamus,
and siducia nos^ra in V^um confirmetur. Polanus.
wherein he signifies in the Gospel, what good He will freely bestow. I shall
define them in this manner.

The Promises are outward declarations of GODS will concerning good to be
received, and evil to be removed; I call them outward declarations, to
distinguish them from inward purposes, concerning good, to distinguish them
from threatenings, which are also declarations of GODS will, but for evil to be
inflicted, concerning good to be received, etc. to distinguish them from
commands, which declare GODS will for good, but that of duty to be done to him,
not of mercy to be received from him.

The Promises of the word are as so, many Legacies bequeathed us by our
Heavenly Father, and by His Son JESUS CHRIST, in His last Will and Testament.

The Promises are the grounds of our Hope, and the objects of our Faith.

1. The grounds of our Hope, Faith and Hope agree in their ground. both of them
are grounded on Gods promises; but Fides credit promissioni divinae, spes
patienter expectat praestationem promissionis, says Polanus. Faith believes
the truth of GODS promises: Hope waits till GOD manifest and accomplish His
truth.
Remember thy Word (i.e. the promise of mercy and grace) unto thy servant, upon
which thou have caused me to hope, Psalm. 119.49. and 81. verse, I hope in thy
Word: Therefore Hope is termed the hope of the Gospel, Coloss. 1.23. that is,
an hope which waits for those things which in the Gospel are promised. This
was the ground of Simeons hope, Luke 2.25. We have no reason to hope for any
thing which is not promised, or upon any other condition, then as promised.

The Apostle uses this argument, why we should not cast away our confidence or
slacken our hope, because there is a Promise, Heb. 10.35, 36. which is a f^rme
foundation for our Confidence to rest upon: So Abraham is said Romans 4.18. to
have believed against hope (of sense and reason) under hope (of GODS Word) for
the ground of that hope is added, according to that which was spoken (to that
word of promise) so shall thy seed be, and elsewhere, to Look for a City that
has foundations, that is, Heb. 11.10.
(as one expounds it) a City which was built upon the immutable stability of
GODS oath and promises.

These Promises are of all needful things in the world, both Spiritual and
Temporal; of assistance under all crosses and of deliverance from them, and at
length of eternal glory and happiness in Heaven, which (because it is
furthest off, and includes in it, an accomplishment of all other promises) is
the most proper object of Hope, in which respect the Scripture does thus
entitle it, hope of salvation, 1 Thessalonians. 5.8. hope of eternal life, Tit. 3.7.
hope of glory, Romans 5.2.

At this Cape of good hope arrives every good Christian, every true Israelite.
The rest are either hopeless, being Aliens from the Covenant of promise,
Praesumendo sperant, and sperando pereunt.
or over-hoping, without evidence and due qualification fondly expecting the
promise.

2. The Promises are the objects of our Faith, Heb 11.11.
and also the foundation of it: whatsoever is promised, may and must be
believed; and whatsoever is believed without a promise, is rather presumed. The
Gospel is called the Word of Faith, Romans 10.18. the Ephesians believed after
that they heard the Gospel, Premissiones vocantur obiectum fidei per
melonymiam adiu^cti.

The object of faith is Christ, or the Gospel and the promises thereof. The
order wherein faith lays hold upon the promises. Ioh. 3.16.


Ephesians. 1.13.

The object of true faith is

1. Principal, the promise of salvation by CHRIST, this is the maine promise.
So GOD loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end, that
whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

2. All inferior Promises annexed thereunto, of Temporal blessings, as food,
raiment, health, peace, liberty, deliverance in temptations, safety in dangers,
etc. these depend, upon the maine promise of CHRIST, so far forth as they are
for our good: for in CHRIST all the promises of GOD (whether they concern life
eternal or this temporal life) are yea and Amen, that is, ^ Cor. 1.20.
sure and certain to GODS children.

True Faith first of all directly and plainly fasteneth it self on the maine
promise of GOD in CHRIST, but after and with this on all other promises that
concern soul or body. The Heart that says by faith, GOD will pardon my
sin, and save my soul, will say also by the same faith, GOD will give me
food and raiment, and all things sufficient for this life, Romans 4.18. Abraham
by the same faith, whereby he was justified, believed GODS promise, that he
should have a Son in his old age: and Noah believed GODS promise of his
preservation in the Arc, by the same faith whereby He was made Heir of
righteousness. First faith apprehends mercy in CHRIST, and then providence for
this life.

Object.
Justifying Faith believes the Creation and all other holy truths, Heb. 11.
besides the Promises; therefore the promises are not the only object of Faith.

Answ.
But not employing her self about them, as her special object, but
presupposing them as necessary Antecedents.

Object.
Justifying Faith believes other promises, besides that of CHRIST and salvation
by Him, as concerning strength in tentations, moderation of afflictions,
comforts of this life.

Answ.
True, but as Appendants and Appurtenances to the maine and principal Promise:
for in CHRIST, that is, the Fundamental Promise, concerning CHRIST, All, that
is, the other depending Promises, are yea and Amen. The proper and peculiar
object then of Justifying faith, is the Evangelicall promise: other things are
believed, some as necessary Antecedents, some as necessary Consequents of this.
But Faith finds life and salvation, neither in the histories of the Creation,
nor in the Legal Commandments, threatenings, promises, but only in the
Covenant of Grace.

CHAP. 11. 2. The Kinds of them.
SOme divide them thus: The Promises are either General or Particular, Real
or Personal, Conditional or Free, Temporal or Eternal.

Others thus:

They are either Spiritual or Temporal, concerning this life or the life to
come, of things simply necessary to salvation, or of things good in themselves,
but not always good for us.

The Promises are either Legal or Evangelicall, General or Particular,
Principal or less Principal, Direct or by Consequent, Absolute or
Conditional, Temporal, Spiritual, or Eternal.

There are Promises The Promises of the Law are directed and made to the person
of every man; particularly those of the Gospel are first directed and made to
Christ, and then by consequent to them that are by faith ingrafted into him.
Perk
Legal and Evangelicall.

Legal are made on condition of works, as the perfect keeping of the Law,
which none since Adam, save CHRIST, can lay claim to, Deuteronomy. 7.12. Ier. 7.3,
23. These should be uneffectuall, if CHRIST had not for us fulfilled that
righteousness whereupon they hang, Gal. 2.16.

Evangelicall are made on condition of believing and repenting, The
Evangelicall Promise is called the promise of Grace; because it is freely
given, and freely performed, and the Promise of the Spirit, Gal. 3.14. because
the Spirit is both the Author and app^ier of it
2 Cor. 7.10. John 3.15.

These are made to the worker, not for the merit of his work, but for CHRIST'S
merit, in which both his person and work are accepted.

Legal Promises or sentences, may be found in the New Testament, as Romans 2.8,
9. to the 13, Romans 10.5. Gal. 3.10, 12. and Evangelicall promises of grace may
be found in the Old Testament, as Psalm. 32.1, 2. Ier. 31.31, 32.

Both these are either General or indefinite, propounded to all, Promissiones
Evangelij praestantiores Legalibus dicuntur, primo quia conditio Legis est, Hoc
fac and vive^, id quod simpliciter imp^ssibile est, quando lex nos invenit
peccatores, nec ullum relinquit ^oenitentiae locum, quod facit Evangelium.
Deinde vero promissiones Evangelij habent comitem essi aciam Spiritus Sancti
a^ul electo^, promissiones Legales apud neminem. Tertio promissio Evangelij
complectitur donum perseverantiae. Promissio Legis minime. Quarto promissiones
Legis sum obscurae, Evangelij sole meridiano clariores. Quinto promissiones
Legale^ pertinent ad solos Iudaeos, promissiones Evangelij indiscriminatim ad
omnes. Denique, promissio Legis est ^ossessio terrae Chanaan, sen vita beata in
illius possessione. Promissio Evangelij est vita beata in coelis de genda.
Cameron.
Exodus 20.6. John 3.16, 17, 18.

Or Particular, directed to some kind of persons, few or one, Exodus 20.12.
Matthew. 9.2. Numb. 25.12, 13.

There are Promises Principal, and less Principal.

1. Principal, as righteousness, remission of sins.

2. Less Principal, deliverance in afflictions, safety in dangers, health,
wealth.

There are direct or express Promises, and Promises by consequent.

Direct, as that which was made to Abraham of a Son, Genesis 18. to Paul, that
not one in the ship should lose his life, Acts 27.

What he prom^seth to any, he promises to all in an equal estate.
Promises are implied by consequence, either in the examples or prayers of
faithful Saints.

1. In their examples, by those blessings which they have enjoyed: GODS giving
it to one, is a promising it to all. Thus does S. James urge that end which GOD
gave to Jobs troubles, Iam. 5.11.
as a ground of our faith, to make us wait for a like deliverance in troubles,
S. Paul assures us, that for this cause GOD comforted him in his tribulation,
that he might be able to comfort them which were in any trouble, by the
comfort wherewith he was comforted of GOD, 2 Cor. 1.4. Whatsoever things were
written (whether precepts, promises, threatenings, or examples) are written for
our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have
hope, Romans 15.4.

2. In their prayers, by those things which they prayed for in faith and
obtained. The Faithful calling upon GOD, and GODS gracious hearing of them,
are as much as a promise, that GOD in such and such things will hear us
calling upon him. David made this a ground of his faith, Psalm. 22.4, 5.

There are Promises Absolute, and Conditional.

1. Absolute, That there shall be no waters of a flood to destroy all flesh,
Genesis 9 11, 15.
which GOD has simply determined to accomplish even as they are propounded, as
before CHRIST was manifested in the flesh, the promise of the Messiah, Esaias
7.14. and of calling the Gentiles, Esaias 42.1. since that time the promise of
calling the Jews, Romans 11.26. and of CHRIST'S second coming in glory, Matthew.
24.30.

2. Conditional, which are no further promised, then GOD in wisdom sees to
be most meet for his own glory and his childrens Psalm. 84.11. No goo^ thing
does he wit^hold, Psalm. 34.^. They shall want nothing ( that is good) They are
good in themselves, not always good for us.
good.

Thus are promised:

1. All temporal blessings, which Luke 16.20
Lazarus wanted.

2. Freedom from all crosses and The evil of troubles shall not ^urt them, Job
5.19. Psalm. 23.4. Ioh. 17.15.
troubles, Job and other Saints had their part in many of them.

3. Freedom from all The godly shall be delivered from the evil of temptation
and persecution So that promise, Rev. 3 10. is to be understood. Po^an. Syntag.
temptations, CHRIST himself was tempted.

4. Less principal graces, the common gifts of the Spirit: these are
distributed severally, 1 Cor. 12.8.

5. The measure of sanctifying graces, some Saints have a greater measure of
grace, and some a less.

Some Promises are in diverse respects both Absolute and Conditional, as that
Exodus 3.17. of bringing the Israelites into the land of Canaan: for in respect
of the people of Israel, it was absol^te, and at length really accomplished;
but if we consider all the particular Israelites, it had an implicit
condition, viz. if they were obedient to GOD.

Lastly, the Promises are either such as pertain unto this life, or the life
to come.

The Promises pertaining unto this life, are either Spiritual concerning the
soul, such are the promises of GODS graces; or Temporal, concerning the body,
as health, wealth.

The Promises appertaining unto the life to come, are eternal life, the crown
of glory, which concern both soul and body.

These I shall handle fully afterward.

CHAP. III. 3. The Excellency of them.
THe Promises of GOD are a Rich Mine of Spiritual and Heavenly treasures; they
are a garden of most precious flowers, of medicinable herbs, they are as the
Poole of Bethesda, for all diseases, for all sorts of persons, and at all times.

They are called the unsearchable riches of CHRIST, The Lord calls them the
bands of love, Hos. 11.4.
Ephesians. 3.6, 8. to assure us, that he is a very rich man that has his heart
stored with the promises of GOD well applied. One styles them, pabulum fidei,
the food of faith. As ^aith is the life of the Soul, so GODS promise is the
life of Faith. They are the inheritance of GODS people. David did so account of
them (Thy promises have I claimed as mine heritage for ever, for they are the
Joy of my heart) Psalm. 119.111. and all the people of GOD are Heirs of all his
Promises, Romans 9.8. The very keeping of the Records of these Promises was a
great Prerogative to the To them pertained the promises made to the Patriarchs
touching the Messiah. Rom 9.4. Perkins.

The promises which were of two sorts, either temporal, as touching the
inheritance of the land of Canaan, or Spiritual of the Messiah, Gryneus:

Both Legal promises and Evangelicall Pet Ma^t. Pareus

Both ^f this l^fe and the next Pellica^ These promises first belonged to them,
and upon their rejecting they were fulfilled upon the Gentiles, ^s^nder.


Jews, Romans 3.2. and it is accounted a singular happiness for the Gentiles,
that they may now partake of these Promises, Ephesians. 3.6. The Apostle Peter
says, that they are Exceeding great and precious promises, 2 Pet. 1.4. which
GOD has given to us. They are most great and precious: for quantity, Great,
exceeding great; for quality, Good, exceeding good. Precious:

1. In respect of the Author of them, GOD; He is said in Scripture to be the
giver of them, Romans 1.2. 1 Timothy 1.1. Tit. 1.2.

2. The ground of them, JESUS CHRIST, for whose sake we obtain them, and the
price he paid to purchase them for us, his Fortas^is epithe^um [pretiopa]
nonnullum respectu^ habit ad prenu^ sanguinis Christi, and meritoru^ eius.
Lorinus in locum.
precious blood, 1 Pet. 1.19.

3. The manner, how they are given, freely; the fountain from which they
spring is the precious loving Quaelibet divinae promissio est dilectionis Dei
erga nos testimonium. Calv. l. 3. Iustit. c. 2.
kindness of GOD, Psalm. 36.7.

4. The means whereby they are apprehended, that precious grace of faith, 2
Pet. 1.1.

5. The great and inestimable profit flowing from them, and the end why they
are bestowed upon us, that we might be partakers of the Excellentia^
promissionum inde ostendit, quod nos tandem effician^ naturae Divinae
consortes. Calvin on this place of S. Peter.
Divine nature, that is, of the graces of the HOLY GHOST.

6. Piscator in locum.

If the promise^ be so sweet, what swee^nesse shall we find in the performance
of them, 1 Cor. 2.9.


In regard of the excellency of the things promised, life and godliness, or
glory and virtue, which the Apostle Peter mentioned, 3. ver. of that 1. Chapter.

The ordinary Gloss, would have life eternal to be there promised.

There is nothing in the world so excellent, so precious* so sweet and so
comfortable as the promises are, Psalm. 119.103.

Cardan subtle l. 7. Joseph. Anti^. l. 3. c. 9.
Cardan says that every precious stone has some egregious virtue; and
Josephus observes, that the splendour and brightness of the precious stones in
the Highpriests breast plate foreshewed victory.

I examine not the truth of those relations: but I dare say, there is more
sovereign virtue in one of GODS precious promises, than in all the precious
stones of the world. I may say of them, as Solomon says of a virtuous woman,
Pro. 31.10.
that their price is far above rubies, or as he speaks of wisdom, Pro.
8.11. Promises in our hearts (says one) are better then pearls or precious
stones in our chests.
that they are better then rubies; and all the things that may be desired, are
not to be compared to them. The bright luster also of these precious stones,
observed by the quick eye of faith, presageth certain victory over all our
enemies. If we can behold the face of GOD to shine upon us, by proving our
interest in his promises, we shall be in all things more then Conquerors
through Him that loves us. The Promises of GOD applied by faith, will put such
an undaunted courage into the heart of the weakest Christian, that he will not
fear the rigor of the Law, 1 Timothy 1.9. the rage of Satan, Ephesians. 6.16. the
tyranny of the world, 1 Ioh. 5.4. the ghastly and grimme face of Death, 1 Cor.
15.55. nor the torments of Hell, Ioh. 3.16. Therefore a truly humbled spirit,
relishing Spiritual things, would not exchange any one of the Promises, for
the riches and sweetness of both the Indies. In many of David's Psalm. 6. Psalm.
22. Psalm 51. Pierre du Moulin de L' Amor Divin.
Psalms, the beginnings are full of trouble, but joy and assurance is to be
found in the end: so that one would imagine (says Peter du Moulin) that the
Psalms had been composed by two men of a contrary humor: but he assigns
this as the cause of so sudden a change. David's soul at the last raising up it
self, from under its burden and adhering to the promises, he found abundance
of comfort. Mr. Bolton has three excellent Stories to this purpose. Bolton his
Instructions for a right comforting afflicted consciences. Page 345.
The first is of a woman greatly distressed in conscience, who industriously
sought the destruction of her self; but being most miraculously preserved,
she afterward received comfort from that promise, Esaias 57.15. Thus says the
High and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity, whose Name is Holy, I dwell in
the high and holy place: with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite
ones. And (to use his phrase) she went to Heaven, in the year of our LORD
1595. Page 346.
Another Godly Man in his sickness, steadfastly fixed his heart upon that
sweetest Promise, Esaias 26.3. Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind
is stayed on thee, because he trusts in thee: and said, GOD had graciously
made it fully good unto his soul, A Scottish Penitent also at the place of
execution, Page 397.
when he was ready to die, laid hold on that, Matthew. 11.28. saying, I challenge
thee LORD by that promise, which thou have made, that thou perform and make it
good unto me, that call for ease and mercy at thy hands.

S. Paul boasts that he is an Apostle of CHRIST according to the promise, 2 Timothy 1.1.

The Patriarchs hugged and embraced the promises as a chief stay of their
lives in their pilgrimage on earth, Heb. 11.13.

Vrsine was comforted by that place, Ioh. 10.29. and Bilney was much quieted by
that saying of S. Paul, 1 Timothy 1.15.
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that CHRIST JESUS
came into world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

There is a commandment of the LORD for the children of Israel, Esaias 66.11.
That they should suck and be satisfied with the breasts of consolation. D.
Preston of the New Covenant.
A worthy Divine observes well the Emphasis of the original. Two Metaphors are
there used, one is to milk consolation out of the Promises: Thus says the
Lord, ver. 12.
the meaning is this, that the promises are full of comfort, as a dugge is full
of milk (for he repeateth the promise presently after) now if thou be ready to
faint, Alludit ad infantes ^ugente, quos maetres quietant and sola^tur,
applicando eis uberibus, ut sugen^o stere desinant Cor. a Lap. in locum.
go and milk out consolation out of the promises, and that will relieve thee,
and stay thy heart. The other Metaphore is, to extort the promises, as a rich
man oppresses a poor man, and gets out of him all that he is worth; so deal
with the Promises, for they are rich, there is a price in them: now when a man
is poor and needy, let him go to the rich promises, and be an extortioner to
them, that is, consider them to the utmost, see the utmost riches that is
contained in them, and they will make thee rich. Again, draw out the utmost of
the milk that is in them, and it will exceedingly revive and comfort thee.

CHAP. IIII. 4. The right Use of them.
We are to praise God for his promises:

1. Tey are good things.

2. They shall be accomplished in a conve^ient season, and this duty have the
Saints practiced, Luke 1.46.

Heb. 11.13. 2 Cor. 6.17, ^8 and 7. Chap. v. 1.


We should labor to work upon our selves to be holy upon Consideration of GODS
promises, thus: is GOD our Father, is he holy: And are we his Sons and
Daughters, and profess our selves to be so, and shall we be unclean? Has GOD
promised to pardon our sins? and shall we therefore provoke and grieve him
every day more and more by our sins? shall we thus requite the bounty, mercy,
love and goodness of GOD? Has he promised us a Crown and Kingdom? an
immortal and eternal Inheritance, that can never be shaken nor taken from us,
and shall not we labor to walk worthy of the s^ne? When the LORD renewed the
promise of the Land of Canaan to the children of Israel, Deuteronomy. 10.11, 12. He
does infer this use upon the same, And now O Israel (says he) what does the
LORD require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy GOD, to walk in all his ways,
and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy GOD with all thy heart and with all
thy soul? As if he should say, since GOD has made thee so large promises,
there is somewhat required at thy hands to do. So Romans 12.1. I beseech you
Brethren by the mercies of GOD, since GOD has been so merciful toward you,
both in promises and performances (for so f^rre that may be extended) that
therefore you gi^e up your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto GOD.

But because the right use of the Promise is a means to sweeten all our
afflictions, confirm our faith, excite us to well-doing, and to breed
contentation of mind in all estates and conditions whatsoever: something shall
be premised generally, concerning the use of them, and then special rules laid
down to direct us how to use them.

For the general, three things are to be observed:

1. We must labor to be acquainted with them.

2. Faithfully to remember them.

3. Wisely and fitly to apply them.

1. We are to acquaint our selves familiarly with those Promises, which are
most General, Precious and Fundamental, wherein GODS power and goodness is
principally seen. Such a speech there is in Job, Acquaint thy self with him
and be at peace, Job 22.21, 2^.
thereby good shall come unto thee. Receive the law from his mouth, and lay up
his words in thine heart.

If we have an herb in our garden that would ease our grief, and we know it
not, what are we the nearer? So if we know not the Promises, though they be in
the book, what are we the better?

2. We should strive to remember the Promises, for that which is not remembered,
is not known. David hid GODS promises in his heart, Psalm. 119.111. and those
upheld him in his trouble, and he received admirable comfort by them, verse 50.
The Promises of GOD are the Magna Charta of a Christian, his chief evidence
for Heaven. Now if men do so highly prize their Charters and Privileges, and
carefully keep the conveyances and assurances of their Lands, how should we
then treasure up these promises, which unto the Faithful are in stead of all
assurances, for his maintenance, protection, assistance, deliverance, comfort,
and everlasting happiness. The Apostle shows, that the cause of the Hebrews
fainting in their troubles, Heb. 12, 3, 5.
was this; they had forgotten the consolation, that is, the comfortable
promises of GOD made unto them for the strengthening of their faith in the
fiery trial. As a Lamp (says Chrysostom) will soon be out, if oil be not
continually supplied: so faith, if it be not nourished with continual
meditation of GODS promises, will soon fail.

3. We should believe the promises, and apply them particularly to our selves.
Faith apprehends the promises not only as true, and so assents, but as good
and sweet, Faith applies and app^o^riates Christ in (...) to ^nes self.
and so adheres and cleaves unto them. Thy loving kindness (apprehended by
faith) is better then life, Psalm. 63.3. The apprehension of Faith, is with
feeling sweetness in CHRIST, He loved me and gave himself for me, Gal. 2.20
says S. Paul in the person of all believers. When Thomas said, My Lord, and My
God, Christ answered that he believed. Ioh. 20. Gal. 3.2^.
and in the Promises, and therefore called The receiving of CHRIST, John 1.12.
The eating and drinking of his flesh, John 6. Psalm. 34.8. Taste and see that
the LORD is good, that is, Believe in him, as appears by the reason added,
Blessed is the man that trusts in him. When the understanding has judged
aright of the promises and adjudged them to our selves, that they belong to us,
then the will welcomes them, claspes about them, hugges them, and as it is Heb.
11.13. kisses and embraces them, and when the heart thus kindly entertaines the
promises, then with old Simeon, we hold CHRIST in our arms.

GOD himself applies the promises outwardly in the Word, and inwardly by the
testimony of his Spirit, and is wont to make good his promises unto his
children, proportionably to their Promises are never believed, unless they be
trusted upon, as a captive cannot be said to believe him that promises to
ransom him upon a day, unles he trust and depend upon him.
trust in them, and dependence upon his truth and goodness for a seasonable
performance of them, Be it unto thee according to thy says, Matthew. 9.29. All
things are possible to him that believes, Mark. 9.23.

That we may apply GODS Promises, we are to use two means: 1. Fixed
Meditation, we should ponder well and muse upon the promise. Pondering is, when
a man lifts any thing to see what weight it bears, so ought faith to do with
the promise, sound the sweetness of it to the bottom, and that, 1. By marking
it, we should set a star upon the Margin of a special promise, and by the
book that culs out promises of note in this kind. 2. Musing of it, we should
dwell upon it: Mary pondered the Angels words in her heart. 3. Making the word
of promise, familiar by frequency, we should get it by heart till it be easy,
so did David make the promise his Counselor and Companion, Psalm. 119.24. When
we go to prayer, we should chew of those promises, Romans 8.26. Iam. 1.5. When we
go about our callings, we should think seriously of that promise, Psalm, 121.8.
When any cross befalls us, we should remember that unvaluable promise, Romans
8.29. and that 1 Cor. 10.13.
2. Fervent prayer, that GOD would by his Spirit both reveal unto us, what be
those precious promises which he has made unto his people in his holy Word,
and also give unto us wisdom rightly to judge of them, and fitly to apply
them unto our selves, in every estate we shall be in. We should beg of him to
reveal this mystery of godliness and CHRIST to us, Ephesians 1.17, 18.
as the Disciples said, LORD increase our faith, that phrase of David is most
heavenly, Psalm. 119.49. Thy promise in which thou have caused me to put my
trust. It is the LORD that must cause the heart to put her trust in the promise.


If we would keep faith in exercise, we must endeavor to know GODS promises,
meditate on them, confer about them, Living by Faith is a relying upon the
Word of God, with full purpose to be guided by it, either by resting upon his
promises, or obeying his Commandemen^s. Baynes directions.
they should be continually in our minds, memories, hearts and tongues. To
live by Faith, is to feed upon the several promises of GOD made in his Word,
and to apply them to our selves, according to all our needs, and so comfort and
encourage our selves against temptation, and unto every good duty. This is that
which is required by GOD of his people, Hab. 2.4. These words Hab. 2.4. are
interpreted two ways according to the several readings: the first is thus,
The just by faith shall live. The words [ ^y faith] being referred to the
subject of this proposition [ The Ius^:] and then the sense is, he that is just
by faith, shall li^e and have eternal life Iuniu^ in his parallels, Weemse,
Willet, Fai^^, and Wilson, sa^^ this is the r^g^t reading. The second read^ng
is thus, The Just shall live by Faith; The words [ by faith] being referred to
the predicate [ shall li^e] then the sense is this, the just while he lives in
this world shall live by his Faith.

Piscator on 1 Romans and Perkins on Hab. 24. approve this latter construction
for the best.


GOD there having threatened judgment against the Jews by the Babylonians,
does afterward promise deliverance again, but not suddenly: the people of GOD
therefore in the mean time were to live by Faith, and depending upon GOD, to
wait for the accomplishment of his gracious promises. The just shall not only
live eternally by his faith, but even here also in this life, He shall live by
Faith.

Abraham served GOD wheresoever he came, That we may live by f^^^h we sh^^ld
1 Sto^e up good promises seasonably when our parts and ^bilities are strong. 2.
Abundantly of al kinds Esa. 42.^3. as if he had said, you must not only lay
in promises just for the present, but store them for afterward 3. We must so
lay them up, that we may have them at hand, Col. 3.16. Verse 12.
and rejoiced in the promise of salvation by CHRIST, Genesis 17.17. John 8.56. Now
if he who saw the promises but afar of, Heb. 11. 13. was so cheared and
quickened by them, what should we be to whom the grace of GOD has shined so
clearly, Tit. 2.11. Jacob when Esau met him, and his heart began to faint (for
the Text says, Genesis 32.7. he feared exceedingly) did go and suck consolation
out of the Promises: for thus he reasons with the LORD, LORD thou have said
thou will do me good: this promise sustained him, and he got so much strength
with this milk, that he was able to wrestle with the LORD all night, and would
not let him go without a blessing. So David, when the Philistines had burnt
Ziklag, and the soldiers that should have been his strength, were ready to
stone him, he remembered GODS promise that he should be King, and sit in the
Throne of Saul; therefore it is said, He comforted himself in the LORD his
GOD, 1 Samuel 30.6. that is, in the promise that the LORD had made to him. So
Nehemiah when he heard of the misery of his people, fell to prayer, 1. Chap. 5.
and 10. verses.
clinging to a promise that he knew was made by GOD, that he had read and marked
out of Deuteronomie. Verse 8, 9.
The same is to be seen in that honorable company of those Worthy Servants of
GOD in all ages from the beginning of the world to that day, mentioned, Heb.
11. which are all brought in as a cloud of witnesses testifying this truth,
that The Just shall live by Faith. Thus S. Paul also lived by faith, both for
Spiritual life, Romans 7. and for Temporal life, 2 Timothy 4.17, 18. and for
Eternal life, 7, and 8. verses of that Chapter.

The Devil strikes specially at our faith in the promises, and not so much at
the general faith, in believing the truth of them in general, as at our
special justifying faith, applying those promises unto our selves. Not so much
to doubt at the general voice of GOD in the Word, Every believer shall be
saved, but at the particular voice of GOD by his Spirit applying the general
to us, and saying, Thou beleevest, Thou art my Son. Therefore above all
things we should fortify our faith and assurance, that GOD is our Father and
we his sons, and (as the Apostle exhorts) Labor to make our calling and
election sure: and for our better applying of GODS promises, let us observe two
rules: 1. To apply all the Word of GOD indifferently, as well the Commandments
for our direction, and the The threa^^nings declare the great pureness of God,
the promises do show ^is great love to righteousness and his wonderful
goodness toward men: He that does these things shall live it them, is the
promi^e, Levit 185. The threatening that answers it, The soul that sins it
shall die, Ezekiel. 18.4, 20. The tar^nesse of the threatening make^ us best taste
the sweetness of the promise Sour and swee^ make the best sauce, promises and
threatenings mingled, serve t^ keep the heart in the best temper.
threats for our humiliation, as the promises for our comfort. 2. To examine
the conditions of GODS promises, and to look as well to the performance of the
conditions required in the promises, as to enjoy the things promised. For as
the Devil denies unto us the application of the promises when we are
interested in them, as when we walk uprightly with GOD; so contrarily he
applies them strongly and earnestly, when they belong not unto us, as he did
the promise of protection by Angels unto CHRIST, though he should tempt GOD. So
he ordinarily applies the promise of mercy, to notorious sinne^s, though they
lie wallowing in their mire, and never wash themselves in the waters of
repentance. And wicked men do often with great confidence or rathe^ Faith
receives Christ, presumption snatches at him, Dike. Faith having promise of a
blessing, uses with precisest care means ordained to obtain it, Act ^7.25,
3^ Presumption so builds on the promise, that it regards not means of
accomplishment.
presumption lay hold of the promises; in the mean space, neither caring to
apply to themselves the commandments and threatenings, nor yet respecting the
conditions, by which the promises are limited. Thus when the LORD says, Ezekiel.
33.11. As truly as I live, I will not the death of a sinner, they regard not
what follows, but that he repent and live; and when they hear the Apostles
speech, 1 Timothy 2.4. That GOD will have all men to be saved, they make a bolster
of it, whereon they sleep securely in their sins, but leave out the
following condition: viz. that he would have all whom he would have saved, come
first to the saving knowledge of his truth, which is never severed from the
fruits of obedience, 1 John 2.3, 4. So when CHRIST says, That he came not to
call the righteous but sinners, with that they comfort themselves in their
sinful courses, but observe not to what he calls them: viz. to repentance,
before they can have any part with him in glory. Some likewise suck poison out
of that heavenly flower, Romans 10.13. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the
LORD shall be saved: not considering, that Every one that calls upon the name
of the LORD, should depart from iniquity, 2 Timothy 2.19.

Special Rules directing us how to use the Promises.

1. General Promises are particularly, and Particulars generally appliable.
The LORD in assenting to Salomons prayer, 1 King. 8.37.40.
made a general promise to any man, or to all the people, that what prayer or
supplication soever should be made toward his Temple, he would hear in heaven
and forgive, 2 Chronicles. 20.8 10.
etc. Iehosaphat being after in distress, applied this general to his own
present condition; when the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Scir came to
turn Israel out of their possessions. So David, Psalm. 119 49. and the woman of
Canaan, Matthew. 15.22. applied the general promises to themselves.

The LORD made a particular promise unto Iosh^a, Josh. 1.5, 6.
that he would be with him to bless his enterprises against the Cananites, and
to carry him through all the difficulties and hazards of that holy war; and
S. Paul applies the promise to all the faithful, Heb. 13.5.
in any straights or distresses of life, as the LORD himself had before
applied it from Moses to Joshua, Let your conversation be without
covetousness, -- for as GOD was with Joshua, so will he be with thee, He will
not fail thee nor forsake thee. CHRIST made a particular promise unto Peter, I
have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not. Luke 2^.32.
And the same in effect he applies to all his, John 17.15 See ^1. and 20.
verses.
I pray that thou would keep them from the evil.

Thus may the children of GOD do, if they find any promise made to one godly
man, and no special reason expressed why it should be peculiar to him, they
may take it as a promise made to them. The ground of this is taken from GODS
unchangeable and impartial manner of dealing: the same GOD that he is to one
faithful man, the same he is to all: they all are under the same Covenant, and
have interest in the same promises.

2. Promises are subordinated and performed with dependence.
Therefore we must not anticipate nor perturbe the order which GOD has put in
his Promises, but wait upon him in his own way. Grace and Glory will he
give, Psalm. 84.11. Master Reynolds in his Treatise of the Sinfullnesse of Sin
but first grace before glory: no man must snatch at this promise, till he have
interest in that. Godliness has the promises of this life and of that which
is to come; but we must note the order which our Savior puts, Mat 6.33.
First seek the Kingdom and Righteousness of GOD, and then all these things
shall be added unto you. The LORD promises to call men unto CHRIST, Esaias 55.5.
Nations that knew thee not shall run unto thee. The Apostle tells us
whereunto he calls, 1 Thessalonians. 4.7.
GOD has not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness. Therefore in the
next place he promises to sanctify and cleanse his Church; I will put my law
in their hearts, Ier. 31.33.
and in their inward parts. The qualification of this holiness is, that it be
whole and constant. The very GOD of peace sanctify you, 1 Thessalonians. 5 23
and preserve you blameless unto the coming of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, is the
Apostles prayer for the Thessalonians. Therefore in the next place, GOD
promises perseverance, I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I
will put my fear into their hearts, Ier. 32.40.
that they shall not depart from me. But this perseverance is not so certain,
but that it admits of falls, slips, and miscarriages; therefore in that case,
He promises healing and restoring: Hos 11.3. Hos. 14.4. Ezekiel. 34.16 Gods
Promises signify what he will do, his precepts what we must do, that this
promises may be to us fulfilled. He promises to hi^ Church to forgive their
sins withal give^ us command to repent and believe, that our sins may be
blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come, Acts 3.19 His promise is
to save his children, their duty yet to save themselves, Acts ^.40.
I will heal their backeslidings, I will love them freely, I will bind up
that which is broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. And after all
this comes the promise of Glory and Salvation. Therefore we must take the
Promises in that Connection and dependancie which they have amongst themselves.
When GOD has called us to the knowledge of CHRIST, we must not skip over all
the intermediate linkes, and look presently for the accomplishment of GODS
promise of Salvation, or perseverance by GODS sole power, and in the mean time
omit all care of Holiness in our conversation. For GOD does not fulfill his
promises in us only, but by us too; and those things which in regard of his
word are his promises, are also, in regard of his Command, our duties.

3. Experience of GOD in his Promises, confirms Faith and nourishes Hope.
Experiments God has given us in others.
The faithful are confirmed in the truth of GODS promises, by the experience
of his dealing with others of his servants, Psalm. 22.4. Our fathers trusted in
thee: they trusted, and thou did deliver them: Psalm. 34.5. They shall look
unto him, and (...) to him, and their faces shall not be ashamed: What made
them so confident in GODS mercies? verse 6. This poor man cried, and the LORD
heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.

Experience of GODS dealing with others, does also nourish and uphold hope.
Therefore James brings to the memories of the Christian Jews, Iam. 5.11
GODS dealing with Job, to strengthen their hope.

2 Experience ^f his mercy in our selves
But especially the experience a man has had in himself, of the performance of
GODS promises, will marvellously confirm him.

This encouraged David, when he was to encounter with Goli^h. See Pal. 4.1.
^sal. 2* and 7.5 77.5.11 1.3 5. Psa. 1^9.52.
The LORD (says he) did deliver me from a Lion and a Bear, therefore he will
deliver me from this Philistine, 1 Samuel 17 35, 37. Paul concluded Gods favor,
for the time future, by his proceedings past. The LORD (s^ith he) has
delivered me from a sentence of death, and does deliver, therefore I trust
that he will deliver, 2 Cor. 1.9, 10. See 2 Timothy 4.17, 18.

This we may see also in Solomon, That faith may be preserved, we must often
meditate upon the sweetness, Ps. 1^9 103. and 139.11. constancy, Rev. 1.5. 2
Cor. 1.20. and perpetulty of the most precious and free promises which are the
grounds of faith, Hos. 14.5 Ezekiel. 36.22. as a Revered Divine^ observes in his
Exposition of his Catechism.
1 King. 8.24. and in other places, Deuteronomy. 1.29, 31. Deuteronomy. 3.21. Esaias 51.9, 11.
But we have a notable example for this in Jacob. Genesis 32.9. Thou said unto
me, remove into thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good.
There is GODS Word and promise: then follows the experience, he had already
of the performance of this promise, verse 10. I am not worthy of the least of
all thy mercies which thou have showed unto thy servant: for with my staff
came I over this Jordan, and now I have gotten two bands. Then follows the
confirmation, he received in his faith by this experience, verse 11. I pray
thee deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau.

Experience likewise brings forth Hope, Romans 5.4.

Three things concur to make up experience:

1. Knowledge: the better knowledge, the better affiance, Psalm. 9.10. They that
know thy Name, will put their trust in thee. The Philosopher says, that
experience is multiplex memoria, a multiplied memory, because of the memory of
the same thing often done arises experience.


2. Observation of the ways of GOD.

3. Memory, remembrance of such works of GOD, as we have known and observed.

We should observe how GOD has made good and confirmed his promises, even in
our own experience, by blessing us, while we have walked carefully and
conscionably before him, how often he has granted our requests. To this
purpose is that exhortation, Psalm. 34.8. O taste and see that the LORD is good.
Labor to be able to say with David, Psalm. 119.56. This I had because I kept
thy precepts: thou have dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy
Word, 6^. verse, or as it is 140. verse, Thy Word is prooved most pure (by good
experience) therefore thy servant loves it, or as he says elsewhere,
Mavelous are thy works, Psalm. 139.14.
and that my soul knows right well.

4. GODS Promises to us must be the ground and rule of our prayers to him. The
ground for what, and the rule how we must pray.

There are two things in this rule to be observed:

1. That we can make no prayer in boldness, faith or comfort, All our prayers
are to be grounded on Gods promises.
but for things promised, and in that manner as they are promised. We must see
the things we ask, made ours in some promise and engagement^ before we presume
to ask them. David often charge God with his promise, Psalm. 119.

Q^^cken me according to thy word, v. 2^. that is, thy promise in thy word. So
10^, 149, 154.

Rem^mber thy Wor^ (...) thy Wo^d, 38. still he ha^ps upon this st^ing, 28^,
1.^5, 75.


This encouraged Jacob, Genesis 32.9, 12. David, 2 Samuel 7.27, 28, 29. Daniel 9.2,
3. and Iehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 20.8, 12. to pray unto GOD, because he had made
promises of the things they desired, and therefore they were certain, that
they prayed according to his will. This was Neh. 1.8, 1^ In the want of other
Rhetoric and Oratory, let Christians in their pray^^^ ^rge this with
repetition, Lord ^hou have ^romised, thou have promised.
Nehemiahs ground in his prayer for the reparation of Ieru^alem. Remember, I
beseech th^e, the word which thou comm^n^est thy servant Moses, saying if ye
transgress, I will scatter you abroad: But if ye turn unto me, and keep my
Commandments, and do them, though there were of you cast out unto the
uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from th^nce, etc. Now
these are thy servants, and thy people whom thou have redeemed by thy great
power, and by thy strong hand. O LORD, beseech thee, let now thine care be
attentive to the prayer of thy servants who desire to sear thy Name. An
excellent example also we have of this in Jacob, Genesis 28. GOD promised to be
with him, ver. 15. his vow or prayer respe^teth that, ver. 20. GOD promised to
keep him in his way, ver. 15. his vow or prayer respects that, ver. 20. GOD
promises not to leave him, he says and will give me bread and raiment, GOD
^romised to bring him again to (...) land, his prayer ans^^^ed that, (...). 21.

Otherwise (...) can have no hope to be heard, (...) 2 Chronicles. ^9 and ^^ 15, 17.
1 King ^2.
if our petitions be not fram^d according to GODS promises. If we will have
GOD hear us, we must pray a^c^rding to h^s will, 1 Ioh. 5.14. We must ask
in faith; Both CHRIST and his Apostles require faith in GODS promises in
prayer, Mar. 11.24. James 1.6.

No f^culty can or ought to extend it self beyond its adequate and proper
object; The thing asked must first be warranted under some precept or promise
in general, though not expressly. M. Harris.
for the object is the rule and the limit of the habit, but the promise is the
object of faith, as has been showed, therefore he that prays without a
promise, denies his own request.

If I pray for the salvation of another, Object.
I have no promise, how then can I pray in faith? How we may pray in faith,
when we want a particular promise, that the thing we ask shall be granted.
So likewise when a man prays to be guided in such a business, to have such
an enterprise to be brought to pass to have deliverance from such a trouble,
such a sickness or calamity that he lies under, he finds no particular
promise, and for ought he knows, it shall never be granted: How can he be
said to pray in faith? For to pray in faith, is to believe that the thing shall
be done.

Sol.
To pray in faith, is to go as far as the promise goes. Now no particular man
has any particular promise, that he shall have such a deliverance, that he
shall have such a particular mercy granted him; Gods promises of things
temporal and to hear us for others, are but indefini^e not universal. The
faith therefore requited toward them is but an indefinite act of recumbency and
submissi^n not of assurance. M. Go^hei^ in his return of Prayers. Yet God
often grants prayers made for o^her^, since promises are made to such prayers,
as, that they shall be healed in their bodies, Iam 5 15. healed of their lust^,
v. 16. converted to li^e, 1 Ioh 5 16. Id. ib.
and therefore it is not required to believe, that that particular thing should
be done, but that GOD is ready to d^e that which is best for me, in such a
particular, that which shall be most for his own glory and my good. Indeed if
we had a particular promise, as Elias had, that it should not rain, in that
case we were bound to believe in particular; but not having that, we are not
tied unto it.

David says, Psalm. 35.13. that he prayed for his enemies, but his prayer
returned into his own bosom: no benefit came to them in their amendment, yet
he was no looser by it, his prayer was not lost. The like may be said of
others of GODS children: when they seek to GOD in sincerity, and pray in the
behalf of others, though the particular suite be not granted, yet they
discharging their duty, shall receive a reward.

The Promises also are the rule how we must pray: Eo modo cuinia sunt petenda,
quo modo sunt promissa.
as things are promised, so must they be prayed for; things absolutely
promised, may be absolutely asked; but where GOD has put conditions and
exceptions to his promise, there our prayers also must be conditional, and we
must express or reserve in our minds some such secret limitations, as these,
If GOD see it to be good, if his good pleasure be such, if it may stand with
his glory.

Verse 3^. We may pray against temptations, (as against sickness and poverty)
(...) simply, bu^ with submission to Gods will; only we must pray ab^olu^ely to
be (...) from (...) of temptation: for those latter words in the I.P do
restrain or correct the former.
Moses, Ex^d. 32.10, 11. wo^ld not let GOD done till he had spa^^d his people,
but desired to be razed out of GODS Book, rather th^n his people should be
destroyed; because GOD had made an absolute promise to bring them into Canaan,
verse 13. which promise Moses plead^th unto GOD in prayer.

GOD has made an Absolute promise of the perpetual continuance of the Church,
but (...) of a continual outward flouri^hing state thereof: for he can turn
the persecution of his Church to the incre^se thereof, and so ^aine honor unto
himself, and bring good unto his people thereby.

In this point (because some things are controverted) I will not interpose my
own judgment, it shall suffice me to declare, how the question is stated by
many Divines. D. Am. That we should have grace is absolutely necessary, and
therefore we may pray absolutely for it.

We may not absolutely pray for limited and set mea^ure^ of grace, but in what
measure God shall think good.




1. Spiritual things, as they are necessary to salvation, ought absolutely to
be asked, because they are absolutely promised to the Faithful, and those that
seek them, Luke 11.13.

2. Those spiritual goods which admit degrees, cannot in every degree be
absolutely begged, because the things themselves, not the degrees of them, are
absolutely necessary, and of GOD absolutely promised, 2 Cor. 12.8, 9.

3. Yet we ought absolutely to ask that measure of grace which is necessary for
us to avoid crimes or scandals, and keep a good conscience, James 1.5, 6. 1
Cor. 10.13. Psalm. 19.14.

D. Sclater upon 2. to the These. page 18.210 and 233.
Spiritual things are promised:

1. Rather quoad essentiam, then gradum perfectionis.

2. In competencie for final victory, not in perfection.

3. With power reserved to withdraw the exercise; 2 Chro. 32 31
leave to our selves, abate the fervor.

There must be submission to GODS will and wisdom in our prayers for
spiritual things, D. S^lat. on 1. of Romans We must refer the time, manner and
measure of granting our petitions to the Lord.
in regard of circumstances of time, means, measure; for these the LORD has
reserved in his own power. We must not in our prayers prescribe GOD the
particular time, when he should give his blessings or help us out of misery,
yet we may lawfully pray, that he would hear us speedily, Psalm. 102.3. because
He has promised to do it.

All the Petitions of the LORDS Prayer (says Dr. Gouge) are absolutely
promised, D. Preston on the Sacrament.

D. G^uge on the Lords Prayer.

See page 10


saving the fourth. For hallowing GODS Name, He himself has said, I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again, John 12.28.2. For the coming of his
kingdom, CHRIST has said, that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against
his Church, Mat. 16.18.3. For doing his will, this is a branch of the new
Covenant, which by CHRIST'S death is made absolute, Ier. 31.33. Ezekiel. 36.27.4.
For pardoning sin, this is another branch of the foresaid new Covenant, 34.
verse of Jeremy. For not leading into temptation, See Schudder key of heaven,
last Doct.
but delivering from evil, the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 10.13. GOD will not
suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation,
make away to escape. For daily bread, GOD can instruct us, both to be full, and
to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need, Phil. 4 12.

Temporal things, are not promised absolutely, but

When we crave temporal benefits, which GOD has promised conditionally, so
far forth as will stand with his glory, and our spiritual good, and
everlasting salvation, we must believe that we shall obtain them, so far
forth, as they will stand with these conditions.

B Babington on L.P.
Earthly and outward things are lawfully prayed for, but ever ^um Condition
voluntatis, with Condition of GODS good pleasure and liking.

A Reverend Divine on the L.P.
Things Temporal which are promised with condition, we are to pray for with
condition of GODS will.

A Worthy Writer in his Catechism.
All outward things must be asked with this exception, if it seem good unto
his Majesty; which exception is proper to the fourth Petition.

We must ask these outward things (not absolutely) no further then they may
stand with GODS glory. Smith grounds of religion.


Those things which belong to the kingdom of GOD are simply and primarily to
be asked, other things only secundum quid and secondarily. Tylen. Syntag.


GODS promises of temporal blessings are Hypotheticae and go with condition
sometimes expressed, Barker on the 5. Commandment.
sometimes suppressed, which condition is as a stern of a ship, and turns the
promise another way. Illa sola sunt absolute^ petenda, quae necessaria sunt ad
Dei gloriam and n^stram salutem: caetera vero cum tacita subiectione ad Dei
sapientissima^ dispositione^. D Ames medul. To l. 2. c. 9.
Of the same opinion are Vrsin in his Catech. on the fourth Petition. Piscator
on 8. Mat. 2. Cameron Myrothee. Evangel. in Luke 5.12. Master Harris on the
Beatitudes and Covenant. Barlow on 2. of Tim. D. Preston in Saints daily
Exercise and M. Goodwin in his return of Prayer.

This is an undoubted truth, that we must pray for heavenly things with a more
ardent affection then for earthly, Therefore in the Lords Prayer there are 5.
Petitions for Spiritual, and but one for Temporal things
Matthew. 6.33. 1. They comply with GODS nature and he had rather be giving
them. 2. They are best for us, and will do us most good.

2. GOD will not perform promises till by prayer they be sought for from him;
God must be sought to for the performance of his promises.
till in our humble desires we declare, that we account his promises
exceeding great and precious things. The LORD had promised deliverance unto
Israel, yet says the LORD, Ezekiel. 36, ^7.
For this I will be enquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them: Thus
says the LORD, After seventy years be accomplished at Babylon, Ier. 29 10, 13
I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to
return to this place; for I know the thoughts that I think toward you,
thoughts of peace, and not of evil to give to you an expected end. But how
shall this excellent promise of GOD be effected? It follows, God does not give
his promises to make us idle, but to exercise our faith in importuning him for
performance.
Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go, and pray unto me, and I will
hearken unto you, etc. Godliness has the promises of this life and that which
is to come, 1 Timothy 4.6. yet we do not forbear daily to say the LORDS Prayer,
that we may speed of both. The Lord makes a promise of forgiveness of sins,
I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgression for mine own ^ake, Gods
promises then are as directions in, not as dispensations from the devotion we
owe unto God. Bish. Lake. ^hen God promised things in par^icular, yet ^^ll ^hey
prayed, and prayed earnestl^, as E^^th when God promise^ that it should rain,
1 King 18.41, 42. and David when God promised to make him an house, 2 Samuel 7.11.
and will not remember thy sins. But for the execution of this promise* GOD
will be so^ght unto. Put me in remembrance (s^^th he) and set us plea^e

ground of what we may expect with comfort.

CHAP. V. 5. The properties of them. GODS Promises are 1. Free. 2. Full. 3.
Firm.

1. GODS Promises are free and tran^ferred.
THey are not m^de for any (...) that is in us, It is called a Covenant of
grace and the promise of grace. The very Greek and Latin w^rds for promise (s^
was before noted) signify a free and willing promise, so the word is taken,
^it. 1. ^. Deuteronomy. 7.7, 8.
bu^ proceed from Gods fre^^om and benevolence: ^orking moo^ed God out of
hims^^^^.

1. Not (...) The LORD did not ^et h^^ lov^ upon you nor choose you: because we
were more in number then any other people (or for any such like respects) but
because the LORD loved you. That at first might seem to be Idem per idem, (as
we say) a woman's reason, that the LORD should set his love on them, because he
loved them: but it excellently sets forth the ground of GODS love to rest
altogether in himself, and in his own good pleasure. Ezekiel. 16.6.8
2. Not our beauty: we were in our blood when GOD set his love upon us, and
entered into Covenant with us. 3. Not our righteousness, Tit. 3.5. Not by
works of righteousn^sse which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us.
There is nothing at all in us to move the LORD to promise any good to us: as
that first and great promise after Adam had sinned, was from GODS free grace,
so are all other Evangelicall promises.

GOD never set the promises on sale, or will ever sell his Son to any, He
gives him freely, He stands not of desert, We may buy of Him Christ is a free
gift, Esaias 96. and how shall he not with him freely give us all thing. Romans 8
31. God commends his love to us, in that when we were yet sinners (and
enemies also) Christ died for us, Rom 5 8.10 He loved us, non existentes, imo
resistentes, says Bernard.
freely, Esa. 55.1, 2, 3. Rev. 21.6. and 22.17. Ezekiel. 36.32. He loves freely,
Hos. 14.7. and pardons sin freely, Esaias 43.25. 1 John 2.12. Election is of
grace, Romans 11.5. Vocation is of grace, 2 Timothy 1.9. Justification is freely by
grace, Romans 3.24. Faith is of grace, Ephesians. 2.8. Eternal life and salvation is
of grace, Romans 6.23. Luke 12.32.

The promises are free, yet conditional. Conditional is not opposed to Free,
but to Absolute. 2 Thessalonians. 3.3, 4
The Promises are ( free in ficri) made only out of grace, but ( conditional
in facto esse) performed and accomplished with dependence upon duties in us.
GOD is faithful (says the Apostle) who shall stablish you and keep you from
evil, there is the promise; and we are confident, that you will do the
things that we command you; there is the duty which the promise calls for.
When we pray give us our daily bread; by saying give us, we acknowledge that
it is from GOD, but when we call it ours, we show how GOD gives it, namely in
the use of the means. For bread is ours, not only in the right of the
promise, I will not fail thee nor forsake thee, 2 Thessalonians. 3.11.12.
but service and quiet working in an orderly calling.

The freeness of GODS promises marvellously lifts up the head above water; as
the beggar says, the dole is free, and why may not I get it as well as
another? O (may some say) but if I could pray and humble my self, there were
hope of mercy.

The freenes of Gods promises revives our hope.
GOD gives his mercy freely, he keeps open house, he requires nothing of thee
to procure it, but he shows mercy, because he will show mercy. See what he
says, Es^y 43 24, 25. Thou have wearied me (says he) with thine iniquities;
and in the next verse, I, even I am he that blott^th out thy trans^ressions,
for my own sake, even I] excluding all m^anes: for my own names sake]
excluding all motive.

No unwor^hinesse then should hinder us from believing the promises: but rather
they that have the most sense of their own It is good for a man (says
Greenham) to watch himself, whether in hearing the promises of God he has a
cold fear coming on him for his unworthines, which if he have, that man may
hope well of himself, Mat. 11.28.

The wicked came Gods peace into wantonness, Jude 4.


unwor^hinesse, have most encouragement to believe; for that voice of CHRIST,
Come unto me all ye that are weary, etc. serves not only for our first
conversion, but in all our distresses whatsoever, throughout the whole course
of our life. Jacob confesses himself unworthy of the least of all GODS
mercies, Genesis 32.10. yet in the 9. verse he entitleth himself unto the
promises, He that comes to me, I cast not away, Ioh. 6.37. As if the LORD
should say; fear not, though base, sinful, poor, and of no account in the
eye either of thy self or others: For if thou come to me, thou art welcome,
notwithstanding these, and I never cast him away that comes.

The wicked abuse the promises of GOD to looseness; they say GOD is gracious
and merciful. CHRIST dyed for us, the LORD will forgive us, and so stuff
themselves with promises till they have made them a pillow for sin. It is
true, there is mercy with GOD, Psalm. 130.4. not to make us bold to sin, but
to fear him. The Apostle urges the promise to spur us to obedience, 2 Cor.
7 1. Heb. 4 1.
and as a motive to the fear of GOD, we should take heed of sinning, because
GOD is gracious, Romans 6.1, 14. Heb. 10.29. Joel 2.13. who would spend to try a
liberal friend? GODS mercy is regulated by his truth and justice. He has
promised no mercy to such, Deuteronomy. 29.20. they have neither part nor portion in
this matter, Esaias 55.7.
Acts 8.21.

2. GODS Promises are full and of large extent, in respect of 1. Persons. 2.
Things.

In respect of persons;

They are propounded generally with such terms as these, every one, or
whosoever, Ioh. 3.15, 16. Matthew. 11.28. Revel. 22.17. Esaias 55.1, 2. Acts 10.43.
Ioh. 7.37. John 6.37, 40. and 5.24. and 11.26. Ezekiel. 33.11. 1 John 2.1.

They are offered to all, none excepted: the Angel brought glad tidings for
all people, Luke 2.10. no sort of men are excluded, but in CHRIST they may have
their part in these promises, as the Apostle shows, Gal. 3.27, 28, 29. He
will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great, Psalm. 115.13. The
LORD is rich unto all that call upon him, Romans 10.12. In every nation he that
fears him, and works righteousness, The Covenant is actually made with
believers only, Act 13.48 Gal. 3.^. but it is offered unto all by the Gospel,
Mat. 28.1^. Acts 17.30. Col 1.23. Tit. ^.11.
is accepted with him, Acts 10.35.

The Promises are propounded promiscuously to all, together with the
commandment of believing; but they are not performed to all, because they
fail in performing the condition, but power is given to the Elect to perform
the condition, Ephesians. 2.8. Act. 5.31. and 11.18.

There is therefore a twofold offering of CHRIST:

1. External in the preaching and publishing of the Gospel or the promises of
CHRIST, Act. 9.15.

2. Internal, a certain spiritual Illumination whereby those promises are
pro^ounded to the hearts of men, Ioh. 6, 45 7 Ephesians. 1.17.
as it were by an inward word.

(...) in Comment. ad Rome. 3. v. 2.
The promises are indefinite in regard of all and every man, and to believers
only they are unive^sall, John 3.16. and Mark. 16.16. R^m. 1.16. and 10.4. GOD
undertakes with them, not for themselves only, but for their seed aft^r them,
I am thy GOD, and the GOD of thy seed: he shows mercy to a thousand
generat^^ns of them that fear him, and keep his Commandments. He maintains
not only such is serve him, but all their hou^hould* yea and all th^^r
posterity too: for the promises are made to you, Acts 2.39.
and to your seed, and to as many as GOD shall call.

2. In respect of things;

His Promises are likewise large for things. No good thing will he withhold;
all that is in heaven, in earth, will GOD bestow on his.

In Deuteronomy. 28. Psalm. 37. and 128. whatsoever is good for the soul, the body,
the estate, the name, the posterity of m^n, is promised to them that fear GOD,
and obey his Commandments.

The Promises in the Word extend themselves to all estates, to all conditions,
and to all kind of distresses whatsoever, they are a Christians Catholic^n;
being a help to all duties, a quickner of all graces, and a Comfort in all
Troubles.

The people of GOD streiten promises, and enlarge precepts, The largeness of
the Promise serves not only to assure all believers of salvation, but to
encourage all that hear of Christ to believe in him: as the brazen Serpent had
a promise annexed to it, Numb. 21.8, 9. Ioh. 3.14, 15, ^6. that all that look^d
toward it, when they were stung with a Serpent should be he healed; that
promise served not only to assure the lookers of recovery, but also to
encourage and warrant every one to look to the Serpent.
but the generality of the promises may comfort any gracious person: Whosoever
believes, shall be saved, none is excluded but such as exclude themselves.
This is singular comfort in temptation, no matter for thy sins; whosoever
believes in CHRIST, shall be saved, though his sins be never so great. This
may comfort the godly also in their mean estate in the world, whosoever
believes, the heinous sinner as well as the lesser; the poor beggar as well as
the mightiest Monarch, shall not perish, but have life eternal.

The Sacraments particularize the generality of the promise.
The indefinite promises are to be appropriated by particular application: Gal.
2.20. 1 Timothy 1.15. The Articles of the Creed Perkins reformed Cath^like. Abbot
against Bish.
concerning remission of sins and life everlasting do include, and we in
them acknowledge our special faith concerning our own salvation. He that
has not this particularity of applying, has nothing of faith more then a
Devil, as two of our worthy Divines D. Prideaux Lect 7 de salutis certitudine.

D Sclater on Rom 18.

The Papish say it is arrogance and presumption by a special faith to apply
the promises to our selves; but it is a notable glorifying of God: the glory of
his truth is given him, when a man does as it were subscribe to GODS Word, and
set his Seal to i^. Ioh 3.33 Rom 4 20. not to believe is horri^le pre^umption,
for that we presume to give God the lie, ^ Ioh 5. ^0 for he that does not in
special apply the promise unto himself, does not in heart believe the
general promise. Non en^m hic sensus est quem fingit Bellarminus, credo in
Ecclesia dari remissionem peccatorum; quod Diabolus atque desperabundus quivis
potest credere: sed credo diri remissionem peccatorum, per Christum mihi, quia
in illum Credo. Episc Daven, in Col.


have well observed. The Devils hold generals, of CHRIST'S death; remission of
sins thereby purchased unto the Church: herein only they fail, that they
apply not these to themselves, nor can believe that they are sharers in these
benefits; and let it be thought no presumption, for GODS child to outstrip the
Devil one step at least, in belief of the Articles of his Creed.

The Apostles applied the promises to them whom either they did instruct or
confirm in the faith, 1 Cor. 1.4, 9, 30. and Chap. 12.27. Ephesians. 1.13. and
Chap. 2.5. Acts 2.39. and 13.38. Col. 2.10. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. 1 John 2.12. The
faithful also apply them to themselves, 2 Cor. 3.18. and 5.1. Ephesians. 1.4. and
2.5. Col. 1.12. 1 Pet. 1.3. 1 John 3.1, 2. and 3.24.

The Papists scoff at this particular assurance, and say, there must be a
particular word, for a particular faith. Where is it said by name (say they) to
any man; Thou Peter or John shall be saved? We may retort this argument upon
themselves: for where is it said to any by name, Sanctify the Sabbath, swear
not? and yet the commandments belong to us, why not then the Promises, though
not spoken to us by name? The word of promise is as particular, as the word of
threatening, command, or prohibition. The Generals include their particulars;
Generals of promise, blessing or comfort, delivered in Scripture, are
intentionally meant, to particulars rightly qualified.

Quod omnibus promi^titur, singulis promittitur.


When a Prince gives a pardon to all thieves, every one can apply the same unto
himself, though his name be not set down in the pardon. To me (says D.
S^lat^r) it sounds as particular in case of my faith and repentance, as if our
Savior himself should say unto me, as to him in the Gospel, Son, thy
sins be forgiven thee.

The wicked enlarge the promises, and streighten the precepts, they take
liberty to sin, presuming on pardon from those two general maine promises,
He that believes, shall be saved, Mark. 16.16. At what time soever a sinner
repents him of his sins, I will have mercy on him, says the LORD, Ezekiel.
18.21, 22.

Here are two sweet promises, the one annexed to Faith, the other to
Repentance; but out of these fragrant flowers, the wicked suck poison.

It is an easy matter to believe (says the worldling) though indeed it be as
hard as to keep the Law, for GOD must enable to both. And true repentance
(says he) is never too late: GOD has promised pardon to the penitent, there
is no exception of 1 Ioh. 1.7. Esaias 1.8. Ezekiel. 18.22.
sin, Ezekiel. 3^.12
times, or Mat. 1^.28.
persons, but at what time soever, what sinner soever repents him of what sin
soever, he shall be forgiven.

This cannot be denied; but yet though true repentance be never too late, late
Poenitentia vera nunqua^ sera; at poenitentia sera raro vera. Austen.

Qui promisit ^oenitenti veniam, non promisit peccanti poenitentiam.

Peccanti crastinum non promisit. Nemo promi^tat sibi, quod Evangelium non
promittit.


repentance is seldom true: and though GOD has promised pardon to the
penitent, yet he has not promised repentance to the sinners. Thirdly, thou
know not whether ever thou shall have time, for he promises not tomorrow
to the offendour, who is always ready to receive the penitent. One says, GOD
has left man time past to repent of, and time present to repent in, but the
time to come he has reserved in his own hands.

3. The Promises are most firm and faithful;
GOD is true in all his promises, be they never so great or wonderful: heaven
and earth shall sooner pass away, then one piece of his promise fail, Romans
4.16. GOD cannot lie, Tit. 1.2. nor deny himself, 2 Timothy 2.13. He may as
easily deny himself as his word. David often in 119. Psalm, gives this
epithet to GODS Word, Nehem. 9.8.
Just and righteous Word, 106, 123, 137, 144, verses. Paul often uses this
preface, This is a true saying, and of all men worthy to be believed; or, this
is a faithful saying, 1 Timothy 1.15. 1 Timothy 4.9. 2 Timothy 2.11. Tit. 3.8. Revel.
21.5. and 22.6. it is called The Word of truth, Iam. 1.18. Ephesians. 1.13. Col.
1.5. The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of
earth, purirified seven times, Psalm. 12.6. Psalm. 18.30. Psalm. 119.140. Pro.
30.5. As the gold and silver that has been often tried does never deceive
men, so the divine promises do not deceive those that trust in them, because
the truth and goodness of them has been continually tried by others, and
graciously performed by GOD himself. His Covenant is called a A firm sat and
uncorruptible Covenant which lasts for ever, Number 18.19 Decretum ab omni
corruptione tutum perpetuumque, says Iunius.
Covenant of salt, 2 Chronicles. 13.5. that is, a stable and sure Covenant, an
everlasting Covenant, Genesis 17.7. Esaias 55.3. Ezekiel. 16.60. this phrase is
frequently used in Scripture, GOD that keeps Covenant, Deuteronomy. 7.9. Dan. 9.4.
Nehem. 1.5. and 9.32. 2 Chronicles. 6.14, 15. Psalm. 89.34. Every word of his mouth
is exactly performed, a^ his people by experience have found and confessed,
Josh. 21 45. 1 King 8.56.
Esaias 54.10. All the promises of GOD are Yea, and Amen, in CHRIST, 2 Cor. 1.20.
Not only Yea, but Yea and Amen. Not only firm and faithful in themselves,
but such as shall be made good to the souls of GODS people in full perfection.

We may call in experience to witness this truth: GOD has not only made good
his Covenant to his friends, but to his enemies and strangers, Deuteronomy. 2. Josh.
23.5, 10, 14, 15. He kept touch with Iehu for the kingdom, for four
generations 2 King, 10.30.
according to his promise. He is faithful to those that deal perfidiously in
the Covenant, Romans 3.3* 4. He makes good his promises in the circumstances of
them, keeps the very hour as it were, Genesis 15.13, 16. compared with Exodus
12.41. therefore this phrase is often used, as the LORD has said, or as the
LORD has promised, Deuteronomy. 10.9. and 18.26. and 27.2. Joel 2.32. Josh. 23.5, 10.

We might instance in particulars, and show how the promises of GOD have still
been fulfilled, as that first promise of CHRIST, Genesis 3.15. we may see
fulfilled, Luke 1.68. to 73. Gal. 4.4. and that particular promise to preserve
Noah in the Arc, Genesis 6.18. fulfilled, Genesis 8. those made to The promise, Gen
12 2, 3. performance, Genesis 13.26.24.1.35. the promise, Genesis 15.5. fulfilled,
Deuteronomy. 10.22. the promise, Genesis 17 16, 9. fulfilled, Genesis 21.1, 2.
Abraham, Promise to Isaac, Gen 26.3 fulfi^led, 12, 13. verses.
Isaac, and To Jacob, Genesis 24.15 fulfilled, Genesis ^5 3. His love move^ him to
promise, his truth binds him to perform. Deuteronomy. 7 7, 8.
Jacob. But I leave this to the observation of Christians themselves.

GODS Love and mercy is the only reason of making promises; but his truth,
justice, fidelity, power, and glory, are the reasons of fulfilling them. The
LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, says Moses to Israel;
because ye were more in number then any people; but because the LORD loved
you; that is the ground of making the promise: and because he would keep the
oath which he had sworn to your fathers, that was the ground of performing his
promise. For thy words sake, and according to thine own heart, 2 Samuel 7.18, 21.
says David, have thou done all these great things, according to thine own
heart, that is, ex mero motu, out of pure and unexcited love thou did give
thy Word and promise, and for thy Word sake thou have performed it. Thou will
perform says the Prophet, The truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which
thou have sworn unto our father from the days of old. Micah 7 20.
Why truth to Jacob and mercy to Abraham? the promise after a sort began in
Abraham (therefore he is called the Father of the faithful) and when GOD
makes a promise, it is only out of mercy; but the promise was continued unto
Jacob, who being Abraham's seed, was an heir of the Promise, and so the
inheritance which was out of mercy given unto Abraham, did out of truth and
fideli^y descend unto Jacob, the seed of Abraham; The promises run all upon
mercy, Exodus 20.6. and 34 7. Deuteronomy. 5.10 Luke 1 50 Psalm. 103 17, 18. Mat. 5 7.
Psalm. 62 2.
and therefore we shall find Covenant, Mercy, and Oath, joined together in the
Scripture, Deuteronomy. 7.12. Luke 1.72, 73. to note unto us, both the ground of
making the Covenant, Mercy, and the ground of performing the Covenant made, the
Truth and Fidelity of GOD.

GODS very name JEHOVAH, declares that he is constant and will perform his
promise, because as he gives being to all things, so he makes that to be which
he has promised. Every one of Gods promises is as sure as himself, being
confirmed with his own oath, Heb. 17 18. Luke 1.7^ Esaias 54.9. D. Benefield on
Amos 1.2
By my Name JEHOVAH was I not known to them, Exodus 6.3. He means, that
though he made many promises to them, especially concerning their possession of
Canaan, yet he did not show himself to be JEHOVAH an Accomplisher of his
promises, that he reserved to future generations, ver. 8. Therefore whenever
in any of the Prophets, GOD promises or threatens any great matter, to assure
us of the most certain event of such his promise or threatening, he adds unto
it his Name JEHOVAH, as Ezekiel. 5.17. Ier. 31.31. in which Chapter being wholly
promissorie concerning the New Covenant of grace and free pardon of sins,
which the Church obtains thorough CHRIST, it is repeated 33 times,

It was the end 1. Of CHRIST'S Incarnation, to show that GOD would be mindful
of his promise, Luke 1.72. 2. Of his Ministry, to assure and confirm the
promises made before to the Fathers, Romans 15.8. 3. They are sealed with the
blood of CHRIST the Testator, Heb. 9.16. and therefore are said to be all in
him Yea and Amen, 2 Cor. 1.20. that is, sure and infallible.

They are sealed in his Spirit, all believers are said to be sealed by the
Spirit of promise, Ephesians. 1.13. and this is GODS privy Seal.

GOD has sealed to all his promises in the Sacraments, Romans 4.11. which are
given to us as GODS broad Seals to ratify his Covenant, and all his promises
made unto his Church; they are outward pledges to confirm our faith, and make
the promises (though not more sure, yet) more credible to us.

The promises are in some places called in the singular number, the promise, to
assure us, that it is as easy for GOD to fulfill all that goodness contained
in all those Promises, as if they were but one only Promise.

We promise and many times fail, either by the mutability of our will, the
imbecility of our power, or the scantnesse of our knowledge, not being able to
foresee impediments.

But GOD is neither mutable, weak, nor ignorant. His promises are made in
heaven, where there is no inconstancy nor repentance. For I the LORD change
not, Psalm. 119.89 152. Psalm. 33.11.
therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed, Mal. 3.6. as if he had said,
I promised not to consume you, and you can tell I have kept promise with you,
for ye are not consumed to this day, With him there is no variableness, nor
shadow of turning, Iam. 1.17. GOD cannot lie, 1 Samuel 15.29. nor repent: Number.
13.19
He cannot lie in making a promise, nor repent in fulfilling it.

GOD is also infinite in wisdom to contrive, and in power to bring about the
execution of his own will. He is only wise, Romans 16.27. 1 Timothy 1.17. The
LORD knows, 2 Pet. 29. It is not Gods power simply, but with relation to his
promise which secures our faith. Luke 1.37. Psalm, 1^5 3. and 135* 6. In Dei
p^omissis nulla falsit is est, quia in facie^dis nulla omnipotent^ est
difficultas, Fulgentius.
to deliver the righteous out of trouble.

GOD is able to accomplish what he has promised, All things are possible to
him, Mar. 10.27. Nothing is too hard for him, Ier. 32.27. Genesis 18 14. Number.
11.23. He c^nnot be hindered by weakness, He is Almighty, Revel. 1.8. He
that is able of stones to raise up children unto Abraham, Matthew. 3.9. is able
to take away our stony heart, and give us a heart of flesh. There is a promise
made of calling the Jews unto CHRIST, God having made a promise unto Israel,
to restore them out of that great Captivity of Babylon, and it seeming to them
incredible, he acquainteth them with his power together with his promises,
Ezekiel. 37.11, 13.
and causing them to turn from transgression in Jacob, Esaias 59.20. But he who
should consider the extreme obstinacy and stubbornenesse of that people
against the Gospel would think it impossible, that they should ever be pulled
out of the snare of the Devil; therefore the Apostle makes GODS power the
ground of certainty in this promise, Romans 11.23, 26. The HOLY GHOST also puts
us in mind of GODS power to strengthen our faith in these promises following.
Where the Holy Ghost entreats of the doctrine of repentance and faith, the word
create is metaphorically use^* to assure us that God will perform his promise,
though it were as hard a work as to create all things at first; Thus he has
promised to create a clean heart, Ps 51. and to create the fruit of lips to be
peace, Esaias 57.9. and to create upon every place, etc. Esa 4.5 and to create
light and deli^erance out of afflictions, Esa. 45 7.


1. The alteration of our corrupt nature, Mark 10.23.

2. All needful grace, GOD is able to make all grace abound, 2 Cor. 9.8.

3. Perseverance to the end, Ioh. 10.28, 29.

4. Supply of all necessities, GOD that is able will supply them, Philip. 4.19.

5. Assistance in all trouble, Psalm. 89.13, 21, 22.23.

6. Deliverance out of all evil, Esaias 50.2.

7. The resurrection of our bodies, Ephesians. 1.19, 20.

8. Eternal glorification, Phil. 3.21.

This motive taken from GODS Almighty power, is used often in Scripture, to
stir up men and women to believe the promises of GOD. It was used to Sarah,
Genesis 18.14. to the Virgin Mary, Luke 1.37. to Jeremy, Ier. 32.27. and to the
Disciples of CHRIST, Mark 10.27.

Abraham looked to GODS power, God performs his promise when there is no
ground nor possibility in nature for it^ notwithstanding all the media
incongru^i and dissimilia. Job 15.25, 26, ^7.
and thereby was moved to believe that GOD would perform his promise, though
Isaac in whom the promise was made, was to be sacrificed, Romans 4.20, 21. Heb.
11.19. Iehosaphat also by his faith did magnify GODS power, 2 Chronicles. 20.12.
This was Jobs only comfort upon the dunghill, that that GOD who would (after
worms had consumed his flesh) raise him up at the last day, and make him with
those very eyes to see his Redeemer, had power enough to deliver him from that
calamity into which he cast him, and to revive his strength.

All the promises are as true, as truth it self

The promises are called su^e, Rom 4 16. Prom^ssa tua sunt Deus, and qua falit
timeat, cum promittii veritas.

August. Confess. l. 12. c. 10.


GOD is likewise true, just, and faithful, and therefore will perform his
promises.

GOD the Father (who has promised) is the God of truth, Psalm. 31.5. the
Gospel (in which his promises are made) is the word of truth, Ephesians. 1.13. His
Son (who has declared and merited the promises) is a faithful and true
witness, Revel. 3.14. truth it self, Ioh. 14.6. His Spirit (which seals
unto us the truth of the promises even in our hearts) is the Spirit of truth.
Ioh. 14.17.

His words are as deeds, his promises as performances.
GOD is just and faithful in accomplishing his promises, Romans 3.3, 5.

David says, LORD in thy faithfulness, The land which was only prom^sed to
Abraham is said Genesis ^5.12. to be given him, Promittendo se fecit debitorem.
Austen. 1 Ioh. 1.9.
or in thy Justice answer me, Psalm. 143.1. that is, not in the justice of
merit, but of promise or Covenant: for in his promises he makes himself our
Debtor, and what he owes by virtue of his blessed promise, we may challenge. If
we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins. As
if he should say, Verba illa [Iust^s and fidelis] referuntur ad promissionem
divinam. Bellar. de poenitent. l. 3. c. 6.

God is as just in performing the mercy which he promises, as in executing the
vengeance which he threatens.


GOD of his infinite mercy has promised to all true Penitents and Confessors,
that he will forgive, and never remember their sins any more; he must stand
to his Promises, or else he should be unfaithful: and he is just, he does not
say he is merciful but just to forgive the sins of true believers, because
they are all satisfied for, and GODS justice will not let him demand the same
debt twice, of the surety and of the debtor.

The righteous GOD shall give unto me a Crown of righteousness, 2 Timothy 4.8.
righteousness as well as mercy, is the ground of salvation, not in relation or
respect to merit in us, but to promise in GOD.

2 Timothy 2.13. 1 Thessalonians. 5.24.
For he is faithful that promised, Heb. 10.23. Sarah judged him faithful who
had promised, Heb. 11.11.

The Promise of GOD is our title to happiness, Gal. 3.18. If some great man
out of his bounty give another an Inheritance of a hundred pounds per annum,
upon his paying of a peppercorne for rent; when he has paid it, he may claim
the profits and by law recover them, and his plea in the Law must be the
bargain and Covenant between them; for betwixt the rent and revenue there is
no proportion: so upon our scant obedience, and scarce appearing faith, we may
challenge heaven, and GOD cannot deny it us; not because we have deserved it,
but because he has promised it.

This will uphold the faith of a Christian: GOD has promised, nay confirmed
his promise with an oath, and sent his Son in the fulness of time, Gal.
4.4. in whom all the promises are Yea and Amen. What can be more Absolute? It
is a maine policy of the Devil, to lay siege, to the truth of GODS Word, Yea
has GOD, said? Genesis 3, 1.
so he would persuade us, that GOD will forget to be merciful, and his promise
will fail for evermore, Psalm. 77.8, 9. Weak Christians in temptations and
desertions are ready to distrust GOD, and to question the truth of his
promises. Moses bewrayed his infidelity, Number. 11.1^, 14.15. Christ's Disciples
and othe^s that believed in him, accounted the promises of his resurrection to
be vain. Luke 24.11, 25.

Psalm. 105.24.


The wicked hope he will change, where is the promise of his coming? 2 Pet.
3.4. the godly fear he will change: David complains, Psalm. 69.3. I am weary
of my crying, my throat is dried, mine eyes fail, while I wait for my GOD,
Psalm. 119.123. Mine eyes fail for thy salvation. I shall one day die (says
he) by the hand of Saul, 1 Samuel, 27.1. Psalm. 73.13. Verily I have cleansed my
heart in vain, Psalm. 116.11. I said in my haste, all men are liars. Psalm.
31.22. I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes. After that GOD
had promised to Abraham that he would make of him a great nation, Genesis 12.2.
and make his seed as the dust of the earth, Genesis 13.16. He and his wife being
both old; he thus (as accounting GODS promises vain) answered, LORD GOD, what
will thou give me, seeing I go childlesse? Genesis 15.2. Luke 1. 18, 20
Sarah likewise hearing the promise GOD had made to her husband concerning a
Son by her, laughed at it, Genesis 18.12. as if she should have said, that is a
jest indeed. GOD told Adam in Paradise, That the seed of the woman should
break the serpents head, Genesis 3.15. He was long, but sure; for it was
fulfilled at last. He that gave us CHRIST, how shall he not with him give us
all things also? Romans 8.32. He that has performed the promise concerning
CHRIST, wherein shall he fail? He has hitherto kept promise with nights and
days, as Jeremy says, Ier. 33.20, 25. that one shall succeed the other,
therefore much more will he keep his word with his people. He is worthy to
be believed, who never failed to perform what he promised. If GOD have
promised us pardon of sin, Sanctification, Patience, Faith; we should
promise our selves these things, and rest confident, that we shall receive
them. Shall we believe an honest man on his word, and yet not trust GOD upon
his word, who is Almighty, and therefore able, a Father, and therefore willing
to perform his promises. GOD has spoken in his holiness (says David) I will
rejoice therefore in his Word. I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley
of Succoth, Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, Ephraim also is the strength of
mine head, Judah is my lawgiver, Moab is my washpot, Psalm. 60.6, 7. Though
then he had little enough, yet he was confident, he should have all that,
because he had GODS Word for it. So we may believe what GOD has promised,
since he has said it, and sealed it, and sworn it. One in the Covenant may
lay hold on CHRIST, and say CHRIST is mine, on the Promise, and say
forgiveness is mine, The Covenant is mutual between God and us. 1 King. 8.23.
on the Covenant, and say grace is mine.

The LORD will not be unmindfull of his Covenant with us, Psalm. 111.5. nor
unfaithful in performance of his promise to us, God has said that he will be
All-sufficient to us; but he requires then on our part that we be Altogether
his, Cant. 2.16. In marriage the woman must take the may for her husband as
well as he her for his wife. True faiths apprehension of Christ is mutual, it
lays hold on Christ, as we use to do in our salutatio^s when we embrace one
another, there is mutual hold on both sides. Whence the act of the Patriarchs
faith apprehending the promises, Heb. 11.13. is elegantly set out, by the
metaphor of saluting; They saluted the promises. True faith kissing Christ, is
kissed of him, embracing Christ, is reimbraced of him, Phil. 3.12
if we prove not unfaithful, but keep covenant and promise with him, Psalm.
103.17, 18. 2 Chronicles. 15.2. for the Covenant consists of two parts: in the one
GOD binds himself to be our GOD, in the other we bind ourselves to be his
people, Hos. 2.23. His is a Covenant of mercy, ours of obedience; He promises
happiness, we holiness; He glory, we duty; He has tied himself by an oath,
we have bound our selves by the vow of baptism, He will not forget his part,
let us remember ours. Let it never be said of us, as it was of a Pope and his
Nephew, that the one never spoke as he thought, the other never performed what
he spoke. The Carthaginians were infamous for covenant breaking, and
slipperinesse in their promises, so that it grew a proverb, Punica fides,
Poeni foedifragi semper habiti, says Plautus; and the Athenians were renowned
for faithfulness in all their covenants, agreements, and promises; which gave
occasion to those proverbes, Attica fides, and Atticus testis, used for one
that still keeps touch. Fidelity in keeping promise is a fruit of the Spirit,
called by the Apostle faith, Gal. 5.22. and a property of him that Psalm. 15.4,
must rest on GODS holy mountain. Therefore we should imitate, the Athenians,
shall I say? nay rather GOD himself, expressing faithfulness in all our
words, works, and ways; we should When we receive this command from God,
keep my covenant, we should pray with Austen, Da Dominc, quod iubes, and iube
quid vu, or as the Church teaches us, when we hear the 10. Comma^dements,
Lord have mercy on us, and incline our hearts to keep this law
keep our covenant with GOD, and Exodus 19 5
pay our vows unto the most High, Psalm. 25.10. Psalm. 103.18. we should also be
constant in the performance of our promises to men, for promises are due debts.
And non in promissione sed in consummatione virtus est, virtue does not consist
in promise, but in performance.

The manner, how GOD performs his promises is not always one and the
selfsame: sometimes he gives the very particular thing promised, as unto the
children of Israel deliverance out of Egypt, David from Saul, Jacob from
Esau. He restored unto Hezekiah his health according to his promise, and
removed the host of the Assyrians, which besieged Jerusalem; sometime he gives
that which is equivalent or better. Deuteronomy. 5.16. Is a good exposition of this
place. So far as long life may be a benefit to Gods children, so far he
gives it to them, Genesis 25.8.
Thus in the 5. Commandment, obedient children are promised long life; yet
Josiah, 2 Kings 23.29. and Abiah, 1 King. 14.13. were taken away in their best
age; therefore for temporal life, they had eternal: He promised ^itam (...)
^ongatam, and gave vitam perpeuatam for it.
so GOD promised Abraham the land of Canaan, and he had the true Canaan, the
Kingdom of Heaven. GOD here breaks not promise, but changes in melius. In
Coelis rep^sita est mayor compensatio. Calvin.
So in taking away wealth from his children, he gives them more store of
grace, in restraining liberty of body, He gives freedom of con^cience, with
affliction, He gives patience. It was promised Josiah, 2 Kings 22.20. that he
should be gathered to his grave in peace; yet he died a violent death, for he
was slain by the hands of his enemies, 2 King. 23.29. the next words therefore
do expound it, And thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring
upon this place. 1 Chronicles. 34.28.
He died in peace comparatively with a worse state of life, for he lived not
to see the misery of succeeding ages, Esaias 57.1. Some interpret it thus, he
was gathered to the Spirits of his Fathers, who enjoyed peace.

GOD does not always perform his promises to the same parties, and yet most
truly performs them, Psalm. 97.11. Light is sown for the righteous.
Oftentimes the Father sows and dies ere the harvest, and so the Son
reapes: so Abraham inherited Canaan in his posterity. Acts 7.5. Tibi dabo and
semini tuo, Genesis 13.15. Particula et videtur exegetica, Pareus in locum.
So GOD promised to send his Son: this promise was made to the Fathers, and
GOD fulfilled it to the children, Acts 13.32, 33.

The time of accomplishing GODS promises is uncertain to us, Acts 1.7, God
delayeth the fulfilling of his promises, Hab. 2.3. Goodness makes the promise,
truth performs it, and wisdom observes the fittest time.
though it shall not be over-passed, The vision is for an appointed time, but
at the end it shall speak and not lie. All visions and words of GOD, whether
of promise or of threatening, let them seem to lie lea and void never so long,
yet shall be not only certainly fulfilled, but in the period of time, Esaias
60.22.
which the wisdom of GOD has impropriated to them. Sometimes GODS promises
have a limited time; as that, 2 King. 4.16, 17.
Genesis 17.21 and 18.14. and then they are fulfilled in that very time, expressed,
as Genesis 21.1, 2. Sometimes he expresses not the time.

GOD in the beginning made a promise to our first Parents concerning the seed
of the Woman, Genesis 3.15.
and deferred it almost 4000. years, and yet at length accomplished it. There
have passed about 5000. years since the time of the glorious coming of CHRIST
unto judgment was promised, Jude 14.
and it is not known when it shall be accomplished. The Amorites country is
by promise given to Ab^ahams see i^, Genesis 12 7. and 13.15. and 15.18. and
Abraham's seed in the posterity of Jacob possessed it, Amos 2, 10. but some 400
and seventy years after the promise.
Abraham was childlesse till he was 70. years old, and at those years the
LORD promised him issue. But this promise was not accomplished till a long time
after, when he was an 100. years old. David had a promise to be King of
Jerusalem and Judah, but the LORD exercised him by many and grievous
afflictions, before he came to the Crown; insomuch that he says of himself,
Psalm. 119.82. Mine eyes fail for thy Word. The promise which was made unto
Simeon, Luke 2.^5.
was not accomplished till he was an old man ready to die, yet he continued to
wait. The deliverance of Israel was promised 400. years before it was
fulfilled, Genesis 15.13.

GOD many times takes day,

1. ^ither his children are not ready for it. Always some distance of time
passes be^weene promises and ^erfo^mances.


2. Or he does it to exercise their faith and patience, Heb. 6.15. to prove
whether they can believe when they see not, Deuteronomy. 8.2.

3. Or he lets them wait, that they may more esteem the blessings when they
have them, but never any could tax him for promise-breaking. GOD as he does
outvie all for the largeness of his promises, so is he unmatchable for
faithfulness in fulfilling his promises. Polliciti^ dive^ quilibet este
potest. Ovid.
We read of some that have promised half their kingdoms, nay the Devil
promised Matthew. 4. Excels^ fro (...) in excelso.

On a mountain, he promises mountains.


all the kingdoms of the world to our Savior; but GOD promises yet more, and
performs better then any of them. First, he does not promise by halves, but
he promises a whole Kingdom, and such a one, as is more worth then all the
kingdoms of the world, and excels them in four properties, as the Apostle
Peter shows. 1 Pet. 1.4.
Nay one kingdom or one world is too little for him to give, he promises to
give to all the faithful two worlds, 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. Things present, and
things to come, all are yours, both worlds are yours. He performs better
also, what he has promised, then those before mentioned. For the first of
them were but men, which often promise mountains, and perform Like the man in
Erasmus his naufragium, who in a storm promised the Virgin a picture of wax as
big as S. Christopher, but when he came to sh^re, would not give a tallow
candle.

Heb. 6.12, 15 Psalm. 130.7, 8


mole-hills: in this sense it may be said, Let GOD be true and every man a
lier; and for the Devils promise, that great All which he made profer on, was
just nothing, but shadows and representations of things. He went about to
coozen CHRIST with mere words, for the kingdoms of the world were not in his
power to give; but GOD is both able and willing to perform, whatsoever he has
promised, his servants have often found him better, He promised the c^ildren of
Israel only the land of Canaan, but he gave them, besides the whole l^nd of
Canaan, two other kingdoms which he never promised; and to Zachary (for his
unbeleefe stricken dumb) he promised to give his speech at the birth of the
child, but besides he gave him also the gift of prophecy. God prevents his
people with his blessings, Psalm. 2^.3. He is bountiful to them before they ask
ver. 3. and above their requests, ver. 4.
never any worse then his word: therefore we should wait with patience for
the fulfilling of his promises, not limiting him to time, manner, or means of
accomplishment.

CHAP. VI. 6. The persons to whom the promises belong 1. CHRIST as the head. 2.
His members.

Christ is the scope and foundation of all Gods promises, partly by merit, and
partly by efficacy; by merit, because he ha^h procured by ^is death and
passion, remission of si^nes and life everlasting; by his efficacy, because
he seals up unto us in our consciences remission of sins, and withal
restores to us the image of God. Perk. on Galat.
FIrst, a Covenant of Grace is made with CHRIST the Head of the Church, He is
the Foundation of it, He was GOD and Man to reconcile both; and is therefore
called The Angel of the Covenant, Mal. 3.1. The Covenant of the people, Esaias
49.8. The Mediator of the New Testament, Heb. 12.24. and next in CHRIST it is
made with all Christian men and women. As he was Head of the Church and
Redeemer, he is the heir of all GODS Promises, In him they are Yea and Amen,
that is, in him they are propounded, ratified, and accomplished. This is
evident by those general promises which are the foundation of all the rest.
He (that is, CHRIST) shall break thine head, Genesis 3.15. Gal. 3.16. Caput and
Corpus uniu est Christus* Austen.
In thy seed (that is, CHRIST) shall the nations of the earth be blessed, Genesis
22.18. The promises are made not to seeds, as many, but to seed: viz. CHRIST
( in aggregato) with his Church, the Head and members together; for JESUS
together with all the Saints, make but one mystical body which is CHRIST, 1
Cor. 12.12. Any promise or blessing that belongs to us, belongs chiefly to
CHRIST. He is the Elder Brother. That speech, Hos. 11.1. I called my son out
of Egypt, is meant speci^lly of the delivery of Israel by Moses out of the
bondage of (...), and yet it is a prophes^e of CHRIST and applied to him,
Matthew. 2.15. That which is spoken Psalm. 8. of man's digni^y above all other
creatures, as having all things put in subjection under him, is interpreted of
CHRIST, Omnia salutaria communicari nobis dicuntur in Christo, ut in Capite;
propter C^ristum ut merito suo impetrame^; and per Christum, ut essi caciter
applicantem.
Heb. 2.6. 1 Cor. 15.27. All the good we have, comes to us by and through him.
We are elected and called in him, Ephesians. 1.3, 4. In him we have redemption,
Ephesians. 1.7. Col. 1.14. Sanctification, 1 Cor. 1.2. Adoption, Ephesians. 1.5. In him
GOD is well pleased with us, Matthew. 3.17. He is Heir of all things, Heb. 1.2.
The Faithful are Co-heires with him, Romans 8.17. They shall have the same
substantial (though not graduall) glory, the same crown, the same kingdom,
Ioh. 17.22, 24. GOD loves them with the same love that he lo^ed CHRIST, verse
23. They are heirs of all GODS most precious promises. They are styled
Children of the Covenant, Acts 3.25. Children of the Promise, Romans 9.8. Gal.
4.28. because they are made children of GOD by virtue of GODS promise. Thus was
Isaac the child of the promise in that he was borne to Abraham, S. Paul Rom
9.8. opposes the children of the promise to the children of the flesh, which
were borne by natural strength.
not by the strength of nature, but by GODS promise. They are also called
Heirs of the Promise, Gal. 3.29. Heb. 6.12, 17. and 11.9. that is, not only
such to whom the promises do belong, but such as claim their inheritance
only by adoption and promise. Amongst men the eldest child usually is the
heir, and carries away the Inheritance, and the rest have but petty portions;
but all the LORDS children are Heirs, and that not alone of the promises, but
of the glory promised. Pareus has an excellent similitude to illustrate this:
every one there (says he) inherits all, even as every man injoyeth the light
of the Sun, as if it were made only for him.

The promises made to Christ, are, Thou shall be a Priest for ever, and I will
give thee the kingdom of David; thou shall be a Prince of peace, and the
government shall be upon thy shoulders; Luk 1.32, 33. The active part is
committed to the Messiah.
thou shall be a Prophet to my people, shall open the prison to the captive.

The promises made to us are passive, You shall be taught, you shall be made
Prophets, you shall have your sins forgiven, you shall be subject to his
government, you shall be made Kings.

If only they that are CHRIST'S have benefit of the promises in CHRIST, The
promises of the Gospel are not universal, but belong to the Elect only. God
has promised by Esaias 8 16. that the Elect only shall be his Disciples, and
not all men indifferently
then the wicked have no part nor portion in this business: the Devil sweeps
all that are out of the covenant, the childrens bread shall not be given to
dogs, GOD will not cast away precious things upon swine, and those that are
strangers from the covenant of promise, Ephesians. 2.12. GOD p^omiseth to satisfy,
but it is such as hunger for righteousness sake; to comfort, not the
careless, but such as mourn, forgiveness of sins, but to the Penitent,
eternal life, but to such as believe. Except the condition be wrought in us,
the promise shall never be accomplished upon us: walk before me and be thou
upright (and then) I am GOD All-sufficient, Genesis 17.1. Blessed are the
undefiled in the way, Psalm. 119.1. Psalm. 84.11. Ioh. 1.12. Gal. 3.7, 9. Psalm.
34.9, 10. Pro. 19.16.

Therefore in the 1. of S. Matthew, Piscator in 1 Matthew.
when Abraham is said to have begotten Isaac, there is no mention made of
Ishmael which yet he begot, and likewise when Isaac is said to have begotten
Jacob, there is no mention made of Esau, whom he begot also. But when Jacob is
said to have begotten Judah it is added, and his brethren, because the promise
of Redemption which was to come by CHRIST, was pronounced to them also. But
that promise belonged not to all them neither, but only to such, who following
the steps of their holy Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, applied it by a
true faith to themselves, as the Apostle shows. Rom 4.12.


It is our comfort tha^ we which cannot stand of our selves may subsist in
Christ. Bish. Lake.
This is a comfort to the people of GOD; they can never loose Evangelicall
blessings of grace and glory, because CHRIST is made the Lord Treasurer and
Lord Keeper of them. We are not trusted with them our selves, for then we
should loose them; but he receives them for us, and communicates them to us.

THE SECOND BOOK. Book. II.

CHAP. I. Of the Covenant. THE PROMISES ARE either GENERAL OR SPECIAL.

GENERAL THE COVENANT. Which in (...) either ab Eligendo or Comedendo from
(...) or a caedendo from (...) Buxtorfe and Pag^in on the word.
Hebrew is called Berith; from choosing, because it is established on certain
conditions which both parties choose: Illvric. Clav Scrip. Iun. Orat. de
foedere.

The Greek word whereby the Septuagint still rendre^h Berith is (...)
testamontum. Heb. 9.^7. foedus, Mat. 26 28 Acts 3.25 from (...) dispo^^. Est
enim extrenta voluntas, qua quis disposit and dispensit res suas; or from (...)
pa^^scor, Luke (...).

The Latin words whereby the Original is expressed, are Foedus, Pactum
Testamentum. For they are used promiscuously in the Latin says Muscula. 1.
Foea^^. It was called Fedai in time past says Var^o, for in a Covenant
interp^uitu^ (...), men give their faith says Isia^re, therefore some ((...)
Al^ie^) had rather write it with a single ^ then ^e. Some derive it from the
adjective, soedus, fil^hy, for the slaying of a ^ow (when was inter ritualia
foederis) was filthy, (...) Vi^g^^ says -- and caesa iungelant foedera porca.
Peter Martyr derives it a feriendo, quod Foertales atrinque porcam mactarent
Hinc ferire aut percutere foedu^, tritu loquenti modus, pro iung^^e, sace^e,
pangere. Ma^^i^ius approves this etymology, and it agrees best with the
Hebrew. ^. Pactum, generis comni est, says Beza: quas^ (...) pace fictum,
says Isidore. It is that truce (says Sico (...)) which in time of war is
concluded upon, and accepted of both sides for a certain limited space of
time; but Foedus: was a perpetual ^uce or league. 3. Testam^ntum quasi
testatto m^n^is, says Justinian, which etymology Vasia derides; but it may be
received as an aliusien.

The French is Alliance, ab all^gando.

The English is League a Ligando, or Covenant, which is the same that Conventio
is with the Civilians, a convent^^^io


it is taken for both a Covenant and a Feast; therefore some derive it from a
word that signifies to eat; because the Hebrews at their Covenant-makings
usually had a Feast, Genesis 31.54. Others derive it from a word that signifies
to stay. It was a Religious Ceremony common to the Jews and Gentiles, that in
making solemn covenant before their gods, a beast was slain by the Priest,
and the parts thereof laid one over against another. The makers of the Covenant
passed between those divided parts; the Ceremony intended and imprecation,
that he might be cut in pieces as that beast was, who should violate the
Covenant so made. And from the use of this Ceremony came the phrase of cutting
a Covenant; as with us, striking of a bargain, from our fashion of striking
hands upon a bargain made.

Alexander ab Alexandro. Lib. 5. c. 3. speaks of it: nay, This was a custom
in Abraham's time, and therefore GOD himself to confirm his Promise to
Abraham, vouchsafed to use that Ceremony, Genesis 15.10.17. for which it is said,
GOD did cut a Covenant with Abraham, ver. 18. See Ier. 34.18.

The word Covenant does sometimes signify a simple promise of grace without
condition, Genesis 9.11. Numb. 25.12, 13. but ordinarily it notes a mutual
contract or agreement between the parties covenanting by stipulation and
promise, Psalm. 50.16. and 25.10.14. and 44.17.

What a Covenant is in general.
A Covenant is a solemn Contract, passing between some parties (two at the
least) whereby they bind themselves, each to other, in certain articles, to
both their contents, for their mutual peace and comfort.

Disserunt non re, sed modo rei promissio and foedus. Foedus est promissic
solenni ritu foederali vestita atque firmata.

Pareus in Genesis Chap. 15. v. 18.


For the form and manner of it, it must be done with some solemnity; and herein
stands the difference between a promise and a Covenant, for a Covenant is a
bundle of promises, bound and knit up together in one tie and mutual solemnity.

There is a Civil Covenant, which is a league or agreement inter dimicantes,
between two or more parties being at variance, Genesis 21.32. and a Religious or
Sacred Covenant, which is a league or agreement, that GOD has made with man
for his Salvation, and that is twofold:

1. That which GOD made at the beginning with our first Parents in the state of
Innocence, Genesis 2.17. promising perfect felicity on condition of their perfect
obedience. It is called Foedus natural, the Covenant of nature, because it was
made by GOD with man at his first Creation, Gal. 4.22. The Law requires,

1. Personal

2. Perpetual.

3. Perfect obedience

4. And from a perfect heart, and that under a terrible curse.


and because it is contained in the Law which is known to men by nature; and
Foedus Legale, the Covenant of works, because works were the condition of it:
it did run thus, Do this, and thou shall live, and I will be thy GOD, Ezekiel.
20.11. Levit. 18. Romans 10.5. Gal. 3.12. win it and wear it, obey perfectly,
and live everlastingly. The two Sacraments of this Covenant, were the Tree of
knowledge respecting the Law, Do this, and the tree of life respecting the
promise, Live. GOD shadowed out this covenant also to the children of Israel
in the wilderness of Sina, when he brought them out of Egypt. Moses describes
it, Exodus 19. and 24. the blessings and curses comprehended in that Covenant
are recited, Levit. 26. Deuteronomy. 27. and 28. It has rationem speculi. It is a
glass to manifest and discover sin and death, and so serves to humble men
which are naturally proud, Mat. 19.17. and to make them fly unto CHRIST for
sanctuary, Gal. 3.24.
who perfectly fulfilled the Law for the Elect; in and through whom we may
obtain the Legal promises, Romans 10.4. Gal. 4.4. I will shake all nations, and
the desire of all nations shall come says the LORD, Hag. 2.7. to note unto us,
(says one) that a man shall never desire CHRIST indeed, till he be first
shaken.

2. That which GOD of his singular grace made with man fallen. The first
Covenant was of man's works, the second of Gods grace, It is a compact made
between God and man touching reconciliation and life everlasting by Christ.
Perk Genesis 3.15.
This is a free disposition of GOD whereby he promises eternal salvation by
the death and mediation of his Son, that he may magnify the riches of his
mercy. This was revealed and delivered to our first Parents in the garden of
Eden, immediately after the fall by GOD himself, and after was continued and
renewed with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

It is called Foedus Evangelicum, the Covenant of the Gospel, and the Gospel,
Romans 1.16.

A New Covenant: We need a new Covenant (says Bishop Lake) that ^ave broken
the old, by our mutability before the fall, and through our imbecility since
the fall.
Behold the days come (says the LORD) that I will make a new Covenant with
the house of Israel, Ier. 31.31. that is, with the whole Church, the whole
Israel of GOD, as appears, Heb. 8.8, 10.

The Covenant of grace, Romans 4.16. because nothing else moved GOD to make and
establish it: it is not grounded upon our works and worthiness, but upon the
free mercies of GOD, and all-sufficient merits of Christ, Gal. 3.18.

The Covenant of peace, Ezekiel. 34.25. and 37.26. Peace, Esaias 54.10.
Romans 10.15. the Gospel of peace, Ephesians. 2.17. and 6.15. Reconciliation with
GOD, and a Testament, because this reconciliation was ratified by the death of
the Testator, The word of reconciliation.

2 Cor. 5.19.


Heb. 9.16, 17.

It runs in these terms, believe and repent, and Thou shall be saved. John
3.16. Gal. 3.11, 19. Mar. 16.16. The Covenant of Grace (says D. Preston) is
double: 1. Absolute, and Peculiar only to the Elect, Ier. 31.33. Ezekiel.
36.26.2. Conditional, which is common to all, and that is expressed in these
terms; CHRIST has provided a righteousness and salvation now, if you will
believe, and take him upon these terms, that he is offered, you shall be
saved, Mark. 16.16.

The Sacraments which GOD gave to man in his corrupt estate were, God ever
ordained Seals to make good his Covenant.
either 1. Before CHRIST, prefiguring Him. 2. After Him, as memorials of Him.


The Sacraments before Christ were of two sorts: 1. Either such as belonged to
all sorts of people. 1. The Arc and Noah's preservation in it, Genesis 6.18. Heb
11.7. 1 Pet. 3.20, 21. 2. The Rainebow, Genesis 9.9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17.
2. Such as were peculiarly appointed to the Jews, some of which were 1.
Extraordinary, during but once or a short time, and answering, either To
Baptism as the red sea, the cloud 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 5. Or to the LORDS
Supper, as the Manna, the water flowing out of the rock.
2. Ordinary, as 1. Circumcision, answering to our Baptism, Genesis 17.9, 11, 12.
Col. 2.11, 12. 2. The Passover, answering to the LORDS Supper, Ex. 12.13. 1
Cor.



The Sacraments after Christ's coming to continue till the end of the world,
are two: 1. Baptism, John 1.26. Mat. 28.19. 2. The Supper of the LORD, Luke
22.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.25, 26.


These two Covenants of works and Grace, do both agree and differ in several
respects: 1. They agree 1. In their Author, GOD. 2. In the persons contracting,
GOD and Man. 3. In the general end of them both, the glory of GOD. 4. In the
ext^insecall form, they both bind. 5. They have both one matter also for
substance, on Gods part man's happiness in both, on man's part obedience in
both. 6. In nature, because they are both inviolable on GODS part.
2. They differ. Therefore this is called Reconliation as well as Covenant.
1 In kind: that was a Covenant of amity between the Creator and the creature;
this of Reconciliation between enemies, for there was no breach made before,
as now there is between us and our GOD. When we were enemies CHRIST died for
us. 2. In the special end; for the end of the Covenant of nature is the
declaration of GODS justice, Cameron. opusc. miscell.
of the Covenant of grace, the declaration of GODS mercy. 3. In the
foundation: for the foundation of the covenant of nature is the creation of
man, and the integrity of humane nature, of the other the redemption of man by
Christ. 4. In the quality of the persons contracting: GOD the Creator in the
first exacts his right from a man pure and perfect, but in this offers
himself, as a merciful Father to a sinner troubled with the sight and sense
of his sins. 5. In the conditions: works are required in the first, faith in
the other. Adam was to make that good of himself, Invat Idem, qui lithet.
Auson.

God undertakes in the Covenant of grace to enable us to walk in his statutes,
and to perform the condition he requires. He works all our works in us, and
for us, Esaias 26.12.


and by his own power: In the Covenant of grace, GOD gives what he requires,
and accepts what he gives. Fides impetrat quod lex imperat. August. Enchir.
c. 117. 6. In the form of fanction; the Covenant of nature was published as
soon as promised, but the Covenant of grace was first promised, then a long
while after proclaimed and ratified with the blood of Christ. 7. In the object:
that is extended to all men, this belongs to some certain men by a singular
reason; for although it is often promiseuously propounded, yet by a special
propriety it belongs to them to which it is intended by GOD. Rom 9 7, 8
8. In duration: that is antiquated to them who are made partakers of this new
one; this is perpetual, therefore called often an everlasting Covenant, and
admits of no end or variation for the substance. 9. In effects: that was deadly
for a sinner, the Ministry of death; this is called a quickening Spirit, and is
the ministration of righteousness and life, 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8, 9.



A Covenant in respect of God, a Testament in respect of Christ.
The Covenant of grace, is called in regard of the convention and agreement
between GOD and man, a Covenant; in regard of the manner of confirming it, a
Testament; being in many things like a Testament. For

1. As in a Testament or last will the Testators mind is declared; so is the
will of GOD in his Word.

2. As in a Will so here, is a Testator which is CHRIST; a Legacy which is
eternal life; Heirs which are the Elect, an Instrument, which are the
Scriptures; and Seals, which are circumcision and the Passover, of the old,
Baptism and the LORDS Supper, of the new.

Thirdly, and principally, as a Testament is in force by the death of the
Testator, Heb. 9.16, 17. so the Covenant of Redemption, is ratified by the
death of CHRIST, and this death by the effusion of blood was shadowed out in
the Old, but consummated in the New Testament.

This Covenant is but one for Divisio foedera in vetus and novum; non est
Genero in Species, sed subveti in accidentia, Scarpi^s.

The two parts of the ^ovenan^, as (...) the (...) and the (...) have (...)
been (...) in sub^^^^^ though not always in like manner dispensed.

S. John speaking of love calls it a new Commandment and an old, 1 Ioh 27,
8. Ol^ in regard of the substance, Levit. 9.^8 because it was given to Adam,
was a Law in Paradise, and because our of request; New because re^e^ed and
approved by Christ, Ioh. 13.34 and 15 12 excellent as new, it makes us new; it
should be new and fresh in our memory.

Novum, quia renovatum. Bucan.


substance, yet in diverse respects and circumstances it is either Old or New.

Old as it is a reconciliation of the old people with GOD by CHRIST to be
exhibited, new as it is a reconciliation of the new people with GOD, by CHRIST
now exhibited in the flesh: in regard of the shadow it is called the Old, and
in regard of the substance the New.

Old, because it is first in time and antiquity.

2. Because it is abrogated in part, Heb. 8.13. 2 Cor. 3.14. being placed in
ceremonies, which in time for oldnesse vanished away.

New, 1. In respect of the immediate Author CHRIST, Luke 22.20. GOD was the
Author of the other.

2. Because celebrated in a new manner, and new rites, and is never to be
abrogated or disanulled.

It is new in respect of GOD and us.

1. In respect of GOD, because the Covenant is renewed as he promised in the
seed of Abraham, which is with all the nations of the earth, Gal. 3.8. 2. In
respect of us, because we are renewed thereby, 2 Cor. 5.17.
The Old Testament is called the Law, because the first and chief part of it
is the Law of Moses; the New Testament is called the Gospel, because the first
and chief part thereof, is the glad tidings of our Redemption, and the form
of the Covenant is in the one Legal, in the other Evangelicall. The Law was
written in Tables of stone, Exodus 31.18. 2 Cor. 3.5. but the Gospel is written
in the fleshie tables of the heart, Ier. 31.33. Heb. 8.10.

The Old Testament is the Covenant of GOD which in types and shadows
prefigured CHRIST to come and to be exhibited, The Fathers had the same
Covenant which we have, they looked for immortality and had it promised.

They expected it by mercy and not by merit, they knew that Christ was their
mediator to obtain mercy as we^l as we, Ioh. 8.^6 Acts 13.32. Luke 1.72. 1 Cor
10 ^. Sanguis Ch^isti proti^it ante^uam suit, Bernard.

CHRIST'S blood was effectual, before existent.


and by virtue thereof, Life everlasting was given by faith in CHRIST that was
to come.

The giving of Isaac, of the promised Land, and all these promises, were but
shadows of the great promise, of the maine Covenant in CHRIST.

The New Testament is the Covenant of GOD, which (since the coming of CHRIST
in the flesh) has abolished those shadows, and gives life everlasting by
faith in CHRIST that is come.

The old Covenant agrees with the Covenant of nature:

1. In both, the parties contracting are GOD and Man. Cameron. opusc. miscell.
2. Each has a stipulation annexed to it. 3. The promise is the same in kind.
4. Both lead to CHRIST.
They differ, 1. Because the Covenant of nature was contracted with all men,
this with the Israelites only. 2. That of nature was made as soon as man was
created and had no praeludia: the old Covenant long after, and had many
praeludia before it. 3. That of nature only binds to obedience due by the Law
of nature, the old Covenant obliges also to ceremonies. 4. Life is promised in
both, but it is set forth in the one by the fruition of Paradise, in the other
by the possession of the Land of Canaan. 5. The Covenant of nature is eternal,
the old Temporary. 6. Both Covenants bring us to CHRIST; bu^ that of nature
does not this per se, but As it shows what a man owes unto God, and how he
must be punished if he pay not the debt, whence it makes ^im look to a
mediator, when he sees himself unable either to pay the one or endure the
other.
per accidens; this old one does it, per se, for it is the true and proper
scope of it. 7. The Covenant of nature was written in the heart, but the old in
tables of Stone. 8. The Covenant of nature was made in Paradise, the other in
Mount Sina. 9. There was no Mediator of that, this had a Mediator, Moses, Deuteronomy.
5.26, 27. 10. That was made with all mankind when man was perfect, this with a
certain people after the fall.


The Old and New Covenant agree; Polan. Syntag.
1. In the principal efficient cause, for there is the same Author of both,
GOD, Ier. 31.31. 2. In causa proegumena, the inward impulsive cause, the mercy
of GOD in both, Luke 1.54, 55, 72, 78. 3. In the meritorious procatarcticall
cause, Ephesians. 2.12, 13.
there is one and the same foundation of both Covenants, CHRIST, Heb. 13.8.
Rev. 13, 8. 4. In the matter, there is the same thing promised in both, Romans
1.1, 2. 5. In the essential form, in both Covenants there is a mutual
obligation of GOD and the faithful, although of GODS part it is free, of man's
due, Romans 3.22. 6. In the end, which in both, is the glory of GOD and salvation
of man, Heb. 11.8, 9, 10. 7. In the subject, for GOD made both of them with the
faithful only, Romans 3.26. 8. In the adjunct, the internal obsignation, for
both of them are sealed by the same HOLY GHOST to the faithful, 2 Cor. 1.22.
Ephesians. 1.13.


The Old and New Co^enant differ. 1. In respect of the Author or Covenant-Maker
which was not CHRIST, They differ not essentially as the Covenant of works and
grace, but modo admirish andi, in the manner of ministration.
but GOD the Father of the Old; or he made it then mediately and not Incarnate,
now immediately and from his own mouth. 2. In respect of the Mediator; Moses
was Mediator of the Old, Levit. 26.46. Deuteronomy. 5. 27, 28. CHRIST of the New, Heb.
8.6. and 9.15.12.24. 3. In their quality. Non exigit a quoquam (says Erasmus
of the Gospel) onus Legis Mosatcae tantum adsit vivida fides.
1. In respect of liberty: of old they had circumcision and the Passover, which
were painful and chargeable Seals; and they were burdened with many carnal
ceremonies: we have bread and wine, cheap and easy seals in comparison, and
are freed from the Ceremonial Law, Col. 2.14. that was a handwriting against
us; the new is a rest for us, Matthew. 11.28. 2. Clarity: the old was obscure,
Novum Testamentum in veteri est velat^m, and vetu^ in novo revelatum. Austen.
Heb. 9.8. 2 Cor. 3.13, 14. consisting in rites and ceremonies, whereby CHRIST
was darkely prefigured; but the new is more plain and perspicuous, John 1.17.
then the Spirit was distilled by drops, Novum Testamen^um in veiers latet, and
vetus in novo patet. Luth^r.

The Old Testament is instar libri clausi.

Esa. 29.11. The New instar libri aperti.

Apoc 5.9. Says our learned Whitaker.


now there is a larger effusion of the Spirit, Heb. 8.10. Joel 2. which is
repeated, Acts 2. Tit. 3.6. Zach. 12.8. 2 Cor. 3.12. they had the blood of
CHRIST, but shadowed only in the blood of bulls and goats, Heb. 9.18. Exodus
24.5, 8. we have the very blood of CHRIST it self, to seal unto our covenant,
Mat. 26.28. Heb. 9.12. and 10.4. Zach. 9.11. Cuius sanguis sistit omnem
sanguinem, as the Fathers say.
4. In their quantity: the new is larger and more extensive then the Old, in
respect of 1. Persons; the Old Testament was appropriated to a few, and did
belong properly to the nation of the Jews alone, Psalm. 114.2.
Psalm. 76.1. none but Israelites and Proselytes had part in the promise; Esaias
40.27. and 66.18. Joel 2.28. Hag 2 8.
the New extends to the Gentiles. 2. Places; that was proposed, as to one
people; Mat 10.5, 6
so in angulo tantum mundi, Trelca^iu^ Ephesians 2 14.
in one land of Canaan; this to all nations throughout the whole world. Gal
6.15.
3. Times; that was Temporary, and to endure but a while, viz. till the ^^rst
coming of CHRIST; 2 Cor 3.11.
this is perpetu^ll and shall last from CHRIST'S first, Ephesians. 4.13.
to his second coming, Heb. 8.6, 13. and 10.4, 9. and 9.12.



How has GOD then honored us in these days of the Gospel, who are herein
beyond, not Heathens only who were without GOD, and without the Covenant, but
even beyond Adam in his innocence, and GODS Ancient people of Israel; for we
have a better Covenant then they had, made upon better promises, Heb. 8.6. upon
better terms and conditions, upon better evidences and assurances.

Since GOD has thus abounded in love and mercy toward us, we therefore should
abound in knowledge, faith, love, zeal, and care to worship GOD, publicly and
privately, with joy and singleness of heart.

I have hitherto handled the several Covenants comparatively; and that to give
some light to the Covenant of Grace, which I shall now speak of in a special
manner, as it is a Bundle of all the Promises.

The Covenant of Grace, is expressed in these words, I will be thy GOD, and
thou shall be my people, Ier. 31.33.

In this Covenant GOD undertakes to free his people from all If the seal of
the Covenant be stamped upon us, we are thereby secured from all evil, Ezekiel
9.4. Rev. 7 3. and 9 4.
evil, that may any way prove hurtful to them, and to bestow all good things
upon them, Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal, Genesis 17.1, 2. Levit. 2.6.11,
12. 2 Cor. 6.16, 17, 18. Heb. 8.10, 11, 12.

We promise to choose GOD to be our GOD, Hence are those gracious promises,
that God is our portion, Ier. 10.16. and 51.19. Lam. 3.24. that is, all we
have to maintain us in the world: and we h^^ portion, Deuteronomy 32 9. that is the
chiefest thing he makes reckoning of.

He becomes our God to direct, protect, and bless us, and we become his people
to serve, love, and obey him.


trust in him, love and fear him, and walk in obedience before him, Exodus
15.2. and 20.19. and 24.3, 7. David calls GOD his Lot and Portion, Psalm. 119.57.
GOD is my portion for ever, Psalm. 16.5, 6. Psalm. 142.5.

God says so unto the Gentiles, Hos 2.23. which the Apostle makes use of Romans
9.25, 26.
This was promised the faithful in all ages, that GOD would be their GOD, and
they should be his people, Exodus 29.45. Revel. 21.3.7. Zach. 13.9. Ezekiel. 36.28.
Ierem 31.1, 33. 1 Chronicles. 17.13. and 22.10. All the particular promises depend
upon this maine Charter, that GOD is our GOD: one Wing Jacobs staff.
observes; that throughout all the Scripture, all the mercy promised, and every
promise wherein any happiness is contained, has this Seal, [ and I will be
their GOD, and they shall be my people.]

If we could steadfastly believe and rest upon this promise, we should find
more true comfort in it, then in all the world besides.

This is the top of man's felicity, when GOD takes him into Covenant. When GOD,
Levit. 26. had spoken much by way of promise to his Church, as That he would
give them rain in the due season, etc. That he would set his Tabernacle among
them, etc. at length he concludes all with this, verse 12. I will walk among
you, I will even neighbor with you as it were, and I will be your GOD, and ye
shall be my people. David having prayed for many temporal blessings in the
behalf of his people, Psalm. 144.12, 13, ^4.
That their sons might be as plants, their garners full, etc. at length he
windeth up all with this Epiphonema, or conclusion, Happy is that people that
is in such a case; Verse 15.
but presently comes with an Epanorthoma, or a correction of his former speech,
Yea rather, happy is that people whose GOD is the LORD: as if he had said, that
indeed is a happiness in some kind, but nothing to this; that is but
Temporal, this is Eternal. The honor and happiness of a nation and people,
Deuteronomy. 33.29.
Psalm. 33.12. and also of particular persons, Psalm. 65.4. lies in this, The
immunitie^ and privileges of those that have God for their God.
that they have GOD for their GOD. He that is in special Covenant with GOD,
all that is in GOD is for him; his truth for his security; his love for his
comfort; his power for his protection; his wisdom for his direction; all that
is in CHRIST is his: his love, his graces, his merits. He is his Savior,
Redeemer; The HOLY GHOST is his Comforter, dwells in him, to teach him and
guide him into all truth, and to seal up the promises to his heart. He has
the guard of Angels, Heb. 1.14. Dominion over the creatures, and free use of
them both for necessity and It is pro^ised as a blessing eve^ unto Gods people,
that there should be boys and girls playing together in the streets of
Jerusalem, Zach 85. and that they should have liberty to invite, and ente^taine
eit^er other. Zach. 3 10.

hairs, Ier. 31.20.

He observes it, Psalm. 38.9. He is the shield of their help, the sword of
their excellency, Deuteronomy. 33.29. He is their hope, their help, their health,
Psalm 71.5. Joel 3.16. Ier. 17.7. Their Rock, their Refuge, Psalm. 62.2, 6, 7.
He will teach them in the way that they should choose, Psalm. 25.12. And make
them perfect in good works. Heb. 13.21. 2 Thessalonians. 2.17. He will give them
their hearts desire, Psalm. 37.4. Pro. 10.24. His eye is ever upon them for
good, Psalm. 33.18. The Prophet comprehends all in that one verse, Psalm. 84.11.
The LORD GOD is a Sun, and shield: the LORD will give grace, and glory: no
good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. A Sun for
consolation, a Shield for protection. A Sun to give them life, a Shield to
defend life given. A Sun to make them fruitful in all good, a Shield to
preserve them from all evil. He will give not only temporal blessings, as it
follows there, no good thing, etc. but he will also bestow upon them grace
here, and glory hereafter, even that grace that shall be once glory. 1 Timothy 4.8.
Godliness is profitable to all things, (says the Apostle) having the
promises of both lives, of temporal things for this life, and of spiritual
and eternal things for the life to come.

Since then the happiness of a Christian consists in this, Let us resolve to
be Gods and enter into Covenant with him, Josh 24.14. Nehem. 5.13 Nehem 9. 2
King. 23.3. 2 Chronicles 3^.31. 2 Chronicles. 15.12. is a special place: there was a
Covenant, yea an oath upon the Covenant, a Bond upon a Bond Psalm. 119.106
that GOD is his GOD, every one should labor to secure this maine point, and
try whether he be in special Covenant with GOD. To this duty the Apostle
exhorts us, when he bids us, Give diligence to make our calling and election
sure, 2 Pet. 1.10. and 2 Cor. 13.5. he says, Examine your selves, whether ye
be in the faith, prove your own selves. And indeed there cannot be a better
evidence, that we are in the Covenant then this, that we are in the faith, or
that faith is in us, for so are those words to be understood.

For the Covenant of grace runs all upon promises, I will give thee, etc. now
faith answers the promise; for the promise is to be believed: Abraham believed
in the LORD, and therefore GOD reckoned him, as a man that was righteous, Genesis
15.6. and accepted him to be a partaker of the Covenant. Every believer is
within the Covenant. He that has a true and saving Faith which works
inwardly by purifying the heart, Acts 15.9. and outwardly by Love, Gal. 5.5.
may certainly conclude that GOD is his GOD.

We may know likewise, that we are in Covenant with GOD, by this, if we labor
to keep Covenant with him, Psalm. 103.18. if our greatest care be to please
him, and our greatest fear, least we should offend him. If we have chosen him,
it is certain he has chosen us, for so Cyril interprets that place, John
15.16. You have not chosen me, 1 Ioh. 4.19.
but I have chosen you, that is, (says he) in regard of priority, I have
chosen you first.

There is a threefold Choosing of GOD. God bestows himself on that man, that
in true desire would have God for his God.

M. Harris.




1. In opinion to prize and esteem him above all other delights, when with
Paul we count all things as dross and dung, nay dogges-meat (as the (...),
garbage and filth that is thrown out to dogs, Ignatius (that holy Martyr)
called Christ his love: my Love (says he) was Crucified.
Original has it) in comparison of CHRIST, Philip. 3.8.

2. In affection, if we love him above all; when we can say with the Spouse,
Cant. 1.7. O thou whom my soul loves: or with Peter, LORD thou know that I
love thee, Ioh. 21.16.

3. In practice, when we choose his ways, as David says, I have sworn and
will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments, Psalm. 119.106.

If upon a diligent scrutinie into our own hearts and ways, we find GOD has
the chiefest command over all our thoughts, affections and desires, and that
we are truly ingrafted into CHRIST by faith; we should then prize the
Covenant, and improve it to all holy uses.

1. We should highly prize the Covenant.

We should say with David, What am I, 2 Samuel 7.18.19.
or what is my fathers house, that I should be raised hitherto? We should
rejoice in this, that the Great and mighty GOD will enter into Covenant with
us, every promise should be precious unto us. That noble Emperor Theodosius
thought it a greater honor, to be Membrum Ecclesiae, then Caput Imperij, a
member of the true Church, then Monarch of the world. Solomon in the book of
his repentance, preferres the title of Ecclesiastes, a Preacher, or reconciled
Penitent, before the title of the Son of David, King of Jerusalem.

When Charles the fifth, Abbot his Geography, and Grimston.
Emperor, in a challenge to Francis the first King of France, commanded his
Herald to proclaim him with all his Titles, stiling him the Emperor of
Germany, King of Castile, Arragon, Naples, Sicilie, etc. Francis commanded his
Herald to call him so often King of France, as the other had titles by all his
Countries, implying that France alone, was more worth, then all the Countries
which the other had. So when the wicked brag of their Honors, Livings, and
great Lordships, a child of GOD may say, that GOD is his, he is his portion,
and oppose this to all other dignities whatsoever. For when a man has GOD, he
has all, he is Blessedness it self; when he comes into the heart, all
comforts come along with him. The Child of GOD may view the Heavens, and say,
my Father made them; he may behold the works of providence, and say, my
Father feeds, clothes and preserves all the creatures in the world: if he be
in prosperity, he may say, GOD has yet reserved greater goods for me; if in
adversity, he may say, CHRIST has endured much more for my sake. The Word and
Sacraments are his: He may go boldly to the throne of grace, Heb. 10.22. and
ask almost what he will in the name of CHRIST, Gods covenant with his people
is a covenant of mercy, therefore these two are often joined together in
Scripture, 1 King 8.23. Dan. 94. and elsewhere. 1. Mercy induced God to make
it. 2 He administers this Covenant with a great deal of mercy, 1 accepting a
little, 2 giving that little, 3 passing by many provocations. Psalm. 31.1 9.
Psalm. 36.7, 8, 9.
Mark 11.24. All his infirmities shall be borne withal, all his endeavors
accepted. He may expect protection in dangers and distresses, Psalm. 80.14, 15,
16. Every one protects their own, I am thine (says David) save me, Psalm.
119.94. He may look to have his wants supplied, Psalm. 23.1, 4. He may boldly
challenge Sin, Death, Hell, the Devil, and victoriously triumph over them all
with the Apostle, 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57. and say with David, The LORD is my
light and my salvation, whom shall I fear, the LORD is the strength of my
life, of whom shall I be afraid? Psalm. 27.1.

2. We should also improve the Covenant for all holy purposes.

We must with boldness and reverence challenge the Covenant of grace. There
cannot be a more forcible argument in prayer, then to plead GODS Covenant and
the interest we have in him. Our Savior, Matthew. 6.9. teaching us to pray,
bids us to say Our Father, as if he should say, presume not to ask any
petition of GOD, till thou can so conceive and be persuaded of him. Those
then who are GODS children may pray with confidence unto him, as a Father:
ipsum nomen orat pro nobis, The very name makes supplication for us.

Thus our Savior CHRIST prayed, O my Father, three several times, Matthew.
26.39, 42, 44. and My GOD, My GOD, Matthew. 27.64. Psalm. 22.1. The Papists urge
their own merits, and merits of Saints, in their prayers, but GODS people have
still urged Covenant, Genesis 32.9. Nehem. 1.6.10.11. 2 Chronicles. 14.11. and 20. 6,
7. Psalm. 16.1, 2. Psalm. 18.1, 2, 3, 6. Psalm. 22.1. and 116.16. Ioh. 17.6.9, 10.
Deuteronomy. 9.27. 1 Samuel 12.22. Ier. 14.21. Psalm. 74.20 and 94.14.


Unite my heart, says David, to thy fear, Psalm. 86.11. as if he should have
said, LORD thou have promised to give me one heart; behold I find my heart
divided, disjoynted; unite it I beseech thee: so those that are within the
Covenant may go to GOD, and say, LORD give me wisdom, faith, patience, for
the discharge of my duty toward thee: Phil. 4.6.
my heart is out of order, LORD mend it; it is thy bargain, Psalm. 119.125.176.
thine own Covenant; O do it for thy names sake. GOD takes it well, if we
mind him of his Covenant, and press him with his promise.

We should also aggravate our sins in confession, by this, that we have
sinned against Covenant, hand and seal; our sins in that respect are worse
then the sins of Pagans or Heathens: they sin but against Creation, we
against Covenant; Amos 3.2. Romans 2.9.
whoredom is worse then fornication.

When we are tempted to the committing of any sin, the Covenant should be a
curb to us: we should say, no; I must now lie no more, swear no more, break
the LORDS day no more; it is against my bargain: such a LORDS day, in such a
Congregation, before such and such witnesses, I took the Sacrament upon it,
that I would do so no more: when we are taken off from any duty, In the
preface to the Commandments, this is premised to provoke their subjection to
the whole Law. I am the LORD thy GOD, Exodus 20. and again, Levit, 18.1, 5.
the Covenant should spur us on, we should remember that we have taken
press money and earnest as it were from GOD in our Baptism, that we will be
for him, that we have often renewed our first Covenant in the Sacrament, and
therefore there should be no flinching from our bargain. I am the LORD your
GOD, ye shall (therefore) do my judgments, and keep my ordinances, and this
was the reason of the peoples resolution in Joshua's time, 24 17, 8. For the
LORD is our GOD, etc. therefore will we also serve the LORD, for he is our GOD.

CHAP. II. Of Special Temporal Promises. 1. Temporal Promises in regard of
evil things: 1. In General. Afflictions and Dangers; 1. To prevent them.



GOD will preserve his children from Afflictions and Dangers.
HE is a Buckler, Genesis 15.1. Psalm. 32.10, Job 1.10
Pro. 2.7. and 30.5. to keep them from all evil, to cover and compass them
round about, Psalm. 5.11, 12. Psalm. 8.2. A wall of Brass, Ier. 1.18. and A wall
He says, not (says Theo^lores) a wall of stone or of brass, but of fire,
that it may both fray a fai^e of and keep of toe at hand, that it may not
only protect them, but destroy their enemies, Non saxe^, non aheneus, sed
igneus, qui and comminus arecat, and eminus terreat.
of Fire about his children, Zach. 2.5.

As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his
people, Psalm. 125.2. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling, Psalm. 91.10. The LORD shall preserve thee from all
evil, Psalm. 121.7. There shall no evil touch thee, Job 5.19.

Ezra 8.22, 31 Genesis 32.
GOD has promised to protect his children in all their ways, Psalm. 91.11. and
to preserve them in greatest dangers by Sea or land. God will be with his in
the fire, as he was with the three children: and in the water, as he was with
Moses and Jonah.


Fire and water are two merciless enemies, yet the fire shall not burn, nor
the waters overflow them, as GOD has promised, Esaias 43.2. They must not pass
by these, by the fire and by the water, but through the fire and through the
water, neither is here water mentioned only but floods or rivers of water, nor
fire only but a flame too. Surely in the By floods of waters, the Scriptures
metaphorically express great dangers, and violent troubles, Psalm. 42.7 Rev.
1^.15 Esaias 59.19.
floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him, Psalm. 52.6. An
asseveration is added to confirm their hearts, and to show the truth of the
promise.

Though the earth, and the heavens be shaken, yet GOD will be the hope of his
people, Joel 3.16. And they shall be hid in the day of his anger, Zeph. 2.3.

Therefore such who are in Covenant with GOD may look to be freed from evils
and dangers, if it be for their good; and in the valley of the shadow of death
may assure themselves of GODS merciful omnipotent presence, Psalm. 23.4. Psalm.
73.26. Psalm. 91.15. Esaias 43.2.

2. To qualify them if they do come. GOD will qualify Afflictions to his
children.
He will correct them.

1. In great wisdom, which is seen in two things: 1. In the meetnesse of
correction, Heb. 12.9, 10. Furthermore we had fathers of our flesh, which
corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in
subjection to the father of spirits and live? For they verily for a few days
chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might
be partakers of his holiness. Earthly Parents often correct their children after
their own pleasure to satisfy their will: but GOD our heavenly Father in
great wisdom considers, (...) nocumenta, documenta. Schola crucis, schola
lucis. Detrimenta Corporum, incrementa virtutum. Gregory.
with what correction, and when to chastize his, so as may be most for their
profit, yea the best profit, to repair his image of holiness in them. 2. In
the just measure and continuance thereof, Psalm 119.75.
Ier. 46.28. and 30.11. Esaias 27.7, 8. 1 Cor. 10.13. they shall not be tempted
above their strength, GOD will not lay more on man then is meet, that he should
enter into judgment with God, Job 34.23 Affliction is momentany, CHRIST
comforts his Disciples with the shortness of afflictions, Ioh. 16.16. GOD will
not keep his anger for ever, Ier. 3.12. Ezekiel. 16.42. Micah 7.18. nor cast off
for ever, Lam. 3.31. Esaias 10.25. and 26 20. Chapter 54.7, 8. Chap 57.16.

Hos. 6.2. Heb 10.37. 1 Pet. 1.6. and 5.10.


David had great experience of this, as he often professes, Psalm. 30.5. Psalm.
103.9. The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous
Psalm 125.3.
God has the wisdom of a Father, and the bowels of a Mother.
2. In love and tenderness, GOD compares himself to a Father, Psalm. 103.13,
14. to a Mother, Esaias 49.15, 16. I will not execute the fierceness of mine
anger, for I am GOD and not man, Hesea 11.9. and in the 8. verse he says, Ier.
31.21. A child never sits so much on his mothers lap, and in her bosom, as
when sick; so the Spouse being sick of love, that is, in some misery, Christ
stays her with fl^gons, comforts her with apples; his left hand is under her
head, and his right hand does embrace her, Cant. 2.5, 6.
His heart is turned within him, his repentings are kindled together. GOD there
imitates parents (says Theodoret) when any misery is upon a child, their
bowels yearne more. There is an excellent expression in Judge. 10.16. His soul
was grieved for the misery of Israel. He does not afflict willingly, nor grieve
the children of men, Lam. 3.33. Judgment is called his Strange work, Esaias
28.21. which we enforce him unto. Atque dolet quoties cogitur esse ferox. In
all their afflictions he is afflicted, Esaias 63.9. Affliction cannot separate
from his love, Romans 8.35, 39. He preserves their tears (as precious liquor)
in his bottle, Psalm. 56.8. See Psalm. 116.15. Psalm. 31.7. Psalm. 38.9. Psalm.
145.8, 9.
3. For good. GOD afflicts his children for their good.
There are many benefits, Afflictions are sanctified to the godly.
which GOD promises, and his Spirit works by afflictions.

1. General: they are blessed whom the LORD corrects, Behold happy is the
man whom GOD corrects: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the
Almighty, Job 5.17. the like promise we have, Iam. 1.12. Psalm. 94.12. Whom the
LORD loves he corrects, Qui excipitur a numero flagella^oru^, exelpitur a
numero siliorum. He that ^scapes his a^fliction, may suspect his adoption. Deus
unicum habet silium sine peccato, nullum sine stagello. Rev. 3.19.
even as a father the son in whom he delights, Pro. 3.12. Quem unice
diligit, whom he cockers above the rest of his children: so the Hebrew word
signifies. That Son in whom he is well pleased, says Mercerus, quem
approbat, whom he makes his white boy, so Theophylact interprets, Heb. 12.6.
The Original there (...) chastize, is derived from (...) a son or child.
Our light affliction 2 Cor. 4.17 Who can show a richer and fuller expression in
Tully or Demosthenes, then is in the Greek, where there is both an elegant
Antithesis and double hyperbole beyond englishing.
which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory. We shall have for Affliction, Glory; For light affliction,
Heavy, Massy, Substantial Glory, a weight of Glory; For Momentany
affliction, eternal Glory. He adds also degrees of comparison, yea goes
beyond all degrees, calling it More excellent, far more excellent, an
exceeding, excessive, eternal weight of Glory. See Romans 8.18. Acts 14.22. 2 Timothy 2.12. 1 Cor. 11.32. Matthew. 5.10, 11. Luke 6.22. 1 Pet. 3.14. and 4.14.
Iam. 5.11. Psalm. 119.71. Lament. 3.27. 2. Special. 1. Afflictions are trialls:
the godly by them have experience of their frailties and graces, and come to
know GOD and themselves, 2 Chronicles. 33.13. This is often set out by this comparison
of gold and silver tried by the fire, Zach. 13.9. Prove. 17.3. Psalm. 66.10. 1
Pet. 4.12. James calls afflictions temptations, Iam. 1.2.
because they serve to try what is in us. GOD led the Israelites forty years
in the wilderness, To prove them, and to know what was in their heart: Deuteronomy.
8.2, 3, 16.
that is, that they might know, says Iunius. The skill of a Pilot is unknown
but in a tempest: the valor of a Captain is unseene but in a battle, and the
worth of a Christian is untried but in trial and temptation. 2. They shall
purge sin, they are sovereign medicines to kill spiritual diseases. GODS
children shall come out of the furnace of affliction much more refined and
purified, as Job did, and lose nothing but their dross. By this the iniquity
of Jacob shall be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sin,
Esaias 27.9. I will purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin,
Esaias 1.25. Many shall be purified, made white, and tried, Dan. 12.10. We know
that all things work together for good to them that love GOD, That one v. 35.
of 11. of Daniel, And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them,
and to purge, and to make them white: shows that these were the three chief
ends of their afflictions: 1. To try what dross of corruption and what sound
metal of grace was in them. 2. To purge out the corruption which was yet
found remaining in them. 3. To make them more beautiful and shining in grace.



to them who are the called according to his purpose, Romans 8.28. We, that is,
not only I and you, but all the faithful know, have great proof of it by
daily experience, that all afflictions (for of them he specially speaks) how
many or how great soever they be, shall procure and further our chiefest good,
the welfare and happiness of our souls. See John 15.2. Prove. 20.30. Psalm,
119.67. Esaias 4.4. Job 33.16, 17. and 36.8, 9, 10, 15. Hosea 2.6, 7. 3. They
quicken graces, they make us partakers of GODS holiness, and bring forth the
quiet fruit of righteousness, Heb. 12.10, 11. The inward man is renewed by
them, 2 Cor. 4.16. 1. Faith is exercised in believing most assuredly the
promises that GOD has made of our deliverance, that the trial of your faith
being much more precious then of gold that perishes, God afflicts his people,
that they might trust in Him. Zeph. 3.12.
though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and glory at the
appearing of JESUS CHRIST. CHRIST. Faith is as much advanced by afflictions, as
gold by fire. The 11. Chapter to the Hebrews proves this. Afflictions (says
one) cause us to seek out GODS promise, Hos. 5 15. Psalm. 107.6, 13, 19. Esaias
26.16.
the promise to seek faith, faith to seek prayer, and prayer to find GOD. 2.
Hope in assuring her self of the reward promised to them that suffer
patiently; Tribulation works patience; patience, experience, and experience
hope, Romans 5.3, 4. 3. Patience is exercised in bearing quietly. Tribulation
works patience, as was said, Account it all joy, when ye fall into diverse
temptations; knowing this, that the trial of your faith works patience, Iam.
1.2, 3.


3. To help us to bear them, and in due time to remove them.
GOD promises to help us to bear afflictions, and in due time to remove them.

Though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down, for the LORD upholdeth him
with his hand, Psalm. 73.23.
Psalm. 37.24. 2 Cor 7.3.
As their afflictions abound, so shall their consolations also, 2 Cor. 1.5. The
LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in time of trouble,
Psalm. 9.9. See v. 18, Psalm. 46.1, 2, 3 Unto the upright there arises light in
darkness, Psalm. 11^.4. that is comfort in afflictions.
They shall have the Comforter himself, Ioh. 14.16. Ioh. 15.26. and 16.7. GOD
often promises to his people to be a sure and speedy help in all troubles,
David had great experience thereof.

The book of Psalms is full of those speeches: GOD is my Rock, my Tower, my
Refuge, my Shield and Buckler, my Health and Strength, Psalm. 18.2. Psalm. 31.3.
Psalm. 71.3. Psalm. 94.22. and 73.25, 26. All which speeches show, that what
help any man in any danger, may find in any earthly means whatsoever; GOD is
the same and much more to all his people in all their necessities, bodily or
spiritual.

The like are those speeches, that GOD will lighten our darkness, he will
keep the feet of his Saints, he will not forsake them, nor forget their
complaint, that they shall not be confounded in the time of trouble: He will
hide them in his pavillion, Psalm. 27.4, 5. And cover them with his feathers,
Psalm. 91.1, 4. His Angels shall pitch their tents about them, he will set them
up on high from such as rise against them, he will heal their wounds, Ier.
30.17.

GOD sees our affliction and knows it well, Exodus 3.7. He hears our sighs,
and remembering his Covenant helps us, Exodus 2.23, 24, 25.

All afflictions come from him, the Almighty has afflicted me, says Naomi,
Ruth 1.21. it is often called the Chastening of the LORD. When we are judged,
Heb. 12.5.
says the Apostle, we are chastened of the LORD, 1 Cor. 11.32. And the same
GOD which imposed the affliction, takes it away, Deuteronomy. 32.39. 1 Samuel 2.6, 7.
Job 5.18. Vna eademque manus, vulnus opemque tulit; GOD will be the strength of
the righteous in their trouble, and their salvation out of trouble. Psalm.
37.39, 40.
David had great proof hereof, and therefore after a mighty deliverance,
composed that excellent Ps. 34. See 7, 17, 19. verses.

I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of
peace to give you an expected end, Ier. 29.11. Rejoice not (says the Church)
against me O mine enemy. When I fall, I shall arise, when I sit in darkness,
the LORD shall be a light unto me, etc. Micah 7.8, 9. Light is sown for the
righteous, and joy for the upright in heart, Psalm. 97.11. The latter part of
the verse expounds the former; by light is meant joy, and by righteous the
upright in heart. Joy is sown for these, and as sure as an harvest follows a
feeding; so to these comfort follows mourning, If we sow in tears, we shall
reap in joy.

I will be content (says D. Hall) with a wet spring, so I may be sure of a
clear and joyful harvest.

Your sorrow shall be turned into joy, Ioh. 16.20. if CHRIST had only promised
that their sorrow should be mitigated or shortly ended, it had been a great
comfort, but this ministers abundant consolation. Never was Goldsmiths more
curious and precise to watch the very first season, when the gold is thoroughly
refined and fitted for use, that he may take it out of the furnace; Mal, 3.3.
then our gracious GOD waits in such cases with an holy longing, that he may
have mercy upon his children, and deliver them. Esaias 30.18.
He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea in seven there shall no evil
touch thee, Ioh. 5.19. Many of the Learned say, that here by six and seven,
the Spirit of GOD alludeth unto the days of the LORDS work in Creating the
world, and his resting on the seventh day; that so must his servants labor
under afflictions all the days of their life, and shall rest from those
labors in the perpetual Sabbath. Rather six or seven are to be understood
indefinitely, Numeri definiti pro indefinitis.
certain numbers for uncertain things: seven referred to humane evils
imports many, Pro. 24.16.

See Psalm. 91.14, 15. Pro. 11.8. Psalm. 50.15. Psalm. 149.4. 1 Cor. 10.13. 2 Cor.
4.8.

The meditation of these gracious promises may comfort GODS people in trouble.
Faith looks unto God, and acknowledges his hand in all afflictions, Amos
3.6. and this will ca^se patience, 1 Samuel 3.18. Psalm. 39 19. Job 1.21. Hos. 6.1.
GOD assures me, he will lay no more upon me, then I shall be able to bear,
either my burden shall be made lighter, or my faith stronger.

We should go to the LORD then in our afflictions, and say, LORD, it is part
of thy Covenant to deliver me from such a cross and calamity; LORD thou have
said, that the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the Righteous;
that thou will afflict, but in measure, according to our strength, and for our
good. O sanctify thy hand unto me, give me faith and patience to wait upon
thee, wisdom to make a good use of this chastizement; God has made a swee^e
promise of giving liberally even wisdom to behave our selves under the cross,
if we ask it. Iam. 1.4, 5. See Ier. 33 2. Lam. 3.39, 40.
let it purge me from my dross, and breed the quiet fruit of righteousness.

The end of chastizement is amendment of life, whence it receives the name of
correction, which signifies to set right or straight. Therefore we must first
labor to find out the sin, for which GOD corrects us. For which purpose
let us remember that place, Job 36.9. If they be tied with the cords of
affliction, then will I show them their works and their sins. When we have
found it out, let us be humbled for it, make our peace with GOD, and reform
our selves, Ioh. 5.14. and then we may expect comfort from GOD. This the LORD
both promised and performed to Job, Job 11.14.
and in him to all that are afflicted. Zophar tells Job, that which GOD
himself did make good at last: If iniquit be in thine hand, put it far away,
and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. It must be the care of the
afflicted to purge his hand and house of all manner of wickedness and sin.
Then it follows, verse 15. Thou shall lift up thy face without spot, yea thou
shall be steadfast and not fear, that is, Thou shall enjoy the comfortable
assurance of the remission of thy sins, and shall rest persuaded, that the
stain thereof is quite done away before the LORD. And for his outward estate
he adds, ver. 16. Thou shall forget thy misery. He shall be quite freed from
all the trouble of it, Thou shall remember it as waters that are past: which
cause the meddowes to be more fat and fertile, then they would have been, ver.
17. Thine age (says he) shall be clearer than the noone day, thou shall shine
forth and be as the morning. The comfort of a sinner reformed by corrections,
shall be plentiful and excellent as the brightness of the noone-tide sun, and
withal, constant, durable, and on the growing hand, as the light of the
morning.

Faith makes us depend on GODS promises in our afflictions, and patiently
expect the issue that he will give, and that without prefixing any time, for
He that believes does not make have, It may be understood either as a
precept, Le^ him not make have, or as a promise, He shall not make haste.
Esaias 28.16. or prescribing any means to him, as faithful Moses when he said,
Stand ye still and see the salvation of the LORD, Exodus 14.13.

Faith does not limit GOD for the measure of affliction; Job says, He will
trust in GOD though he kill him, Job 13.1^. It was a grievous affliction for
David to be driven out of his kingdom by his own Son, yet he says in that
slight, If he say, I have no delight in him, behold here I am, let him do unto
me as seems good in his eyes, 2 Samuel 15.26. Therefore in all our afflictions,
let us set faith a work, for this stirs up prayer, and prayer stirs up
Prayer of the Saints in time of afflictions, can do more then all the witches
in the world can do (to whom divellish minded people seek in their troubles)
for they can but set the Devils awork, but prayer will set God aworke,
GOD, and GOD stirs up all the creatures.

Faith gathers one contrary out of another, life out of death, assurance of
sweetest deliverances out of deepest distresses; For the LORD shall judge his
people and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is
gone, and there is none shut up or left, Deuteronomy. 32.36. 2 King. 14, 26. Going
into captivity, was a sign of the Israelites returning out of Captivity. S
Jerome says it was a proverb among the Hebrews, God will help us in the
Mount, Gen 2^.14 and it is an english proverb, man's extremity is Gods
opportunity.
Faith will teach us to say, he has chastized me according as he has
threatened, therefore he will comfort me according as he has promised, Ier.
32.42. It will extract abundance of comfort, in the most desperate distresses,
from those places, 2 Chronicles. 20.12. Prove. 18.10. Esaias 33.9, 10. For the nature
of it is to believe GOD upon his bare word, Ibi incipit auxilium divinum, ubi
defici^ humanum. Psalm. 61.2, 3.
and that against sense in things invisible, and against reason in things
incredible, Heb. 11.1. David, Psalm. 56.10. though sorely afflicted, yet
rejoices in GOD, because of his naked promise; the woman of Canaan could pick
comfort out of the reproachful name of dog. Has not GOD promised and assured
me not to fail nor forsake me, but to uphold me in affliction, Psalm. 27.10.
and bring me through it, and comfort me by it, and glorify me after it?
therefore I should with Abraham hope against hope, and apprehend the certain
accomplishment of these promises by faith; when sense and carnal reason see
nothing but the contrary.

CHAP. III. Temporal Promises in regard of evil things. Special. Sickness,
Poverty, Famine, War, Captivity, Witchcraft, or possession of the Devil,
Oppression.


Promises in regard of Sickness.
1. TO prevent Sickness and keep it away. 1. To prevent sickness.


If thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy GOD, and wilt do
that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his Commandments, and
keep all his statutes; I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I
have brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the LORD that heals thee, Exodus
15.26. Deuteronomy. 7.15.

GOD will preserve his children from the pestilence, Pro 3.25.
Psalm. 91.3, 6, 7, 10. He will certainly deliver them from the hurt of it, so
as it shall not hinder the good or salvation of any in the godly man's house.

2. If sickness be amongst us, to help in it, 2. To help in sickness.
and remove it from us. The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of
languishing, thou will make all his bed in his sickness, Psalm. 41.3.

And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, 3. To take it away.
Job 5 18.
Deuteronomy. 7.15. And I will take sickness away from the midst of thee, Exodus 23.25.

In all our bodily infirmities and sore diseases, we should remember some of
these promises, and lay hold on them by faith, that we faint not nor murmr.

Promises in regard of Poverty.

There is a general promise made to all that fear GOD, 1 Timothy 4.8. Psalm.
34.9, 10. Heb. 13.5. Mat. 6.33.


And many other special promises likewise, which may comfort and strengthen
the godly against murmuring and impatiency in hard times: I will abundantly
bless her provision, I will satisfy her poor with bread, Psalm. 132.15. Deuteronomy.
8.16. No rich man under Heaven can be so assured, that he and his shall be
preserved from beggary, as every poor Christian may be. For though the LORD in
infinite bounty do bestow those blessings on wicked men in great abundance,
yet they belong to them only ex largitate, out of a general providence; but
to the faithful ex promisso, out of GODS The good that comes by the promise,
is a more sure, complete and comfortable good. Job 21.7, 8. Ier. 12.1, 2.
Psalm. 73.12.
promise; David beholding how much it vexed GODS children to see the wicked
prosper in this world, and the godly distressed, of purpose made the 37.
Psalm, to hearten^ the godly against this sore tentation, which in all ages
much troubled GODS people; and there he shows that the state of the godly is
far better even in this life, then that of the wicked, 3, 4, 5, 11, 16. verses.
To the same purpose was made the 73. Psalm.

See Psalm. 16.5, 6. Psalm. 23. Psalm. 10.14. Psalm. 109.31. He raises up the
poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the dunghill, Psalm. 103.7.

I have been young (says David in that 37. Psalm 25. verse) and now am old,
yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. David's
saying may be taken 1. as his own observation in his time; for he says not,
the righteous is never forsaken; but that he never saw it, and it is a rare
thing: 2. (which Exposition Master Perkins approves) the righteous man is never
forsaken and his seed too; GOD may make trial of godly Parents by want, but
their godly children shall surely be blessed: 3. he says, he never saw the
righteous and his seed forsaken, begging bread; that is, no not forsaken when
they were begging their bread.

God will either supply the wants of his children or enable them to bear them,
as he taught Paul how to want, Phil. 4.12. Genesis 15 1. Hab. 3 17, 18
Whenever we are pinched with any earthly necessity, we should run to one
of these gracious promises; for if we rightly believe them, they will make us
cast our care on GOD that cares for us, and moderate our immeasurable carking
after the things of this world, moving us patiently to wait for the
accomplishment of our desires, or contentedly to want what GOD denies, Phil.
4.5. 1 Pet. 5.7. Psalm. 55.22. Psalm. 37.4, 5. Deuteronomy. 8.3.

Promises for succor in Famine
At destruction and famine thou shall laugh, Job. 5 22. God will not leave his
in famine, but will then relieve them, as he did the widow of Zar^ph^ah.
Particular promises for help in Famine, and deliverance from it.

In Famine he shall redeem thee from death, Job 5.20. The LORD will not suffer
the soul of the righteous to famish, Prove. 10.3. Behold the eye of the LORD is
upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy, to keep them alive
in famine, Psalm. 33.19. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied, Psalm.
37.19. If I shut up Heaven (says the LORD) that there be no rain, or if I
command the Locusts to devour the land; if my people shall humble themselves
and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I
hear from heaven and will forgive their sin, and heal their land. 2 Chronicles.
7.13, 14. In that day I will hear says the LORD, I will hear the Heavens,
and they shall hear the Earth, and the earth shall hear the corn, and the
wine, and the oil, and they shall hear Iezreel, Hosea 2.21, 22. When the
poor and needy seek water and there is none, Esaias 41.17, 18.
and their tongue fails for thirst; I the LORD will hear them* I the GOD of
Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains
in the midst of the valleys, I will make the wilderness a poole of water, and
the dry land springs of water.

See Joel 2.18, 19. Zach. 8.11, 12. and 10.1. Mal. 3.10.

GODS children in time of scarcity should live by faith, Mat. 4.4. feed on the
promise, and depend on GODS allowance: when our own provision fails us, then
not to distrust the provision of GOD, is a noble trial of faith.

Promises to preserve from War, and deliver from the Sword.
The LORD will preserve his children from War, Thou shall not see a fierce
people, Esaias 33.19.

The enemies being astonished shall be a prey to the Church, ver. 23.

GOD will deliver them from the Sword, as he says Ier. 39.17, 18. I will
deliver thee in that day, and thou shall not be given into the hand of the men
of whom thou art afraid. For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shall not
fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee, because thou
have put thy trust in me, says the LORD.

In War he shall redeem thee from the power of the sword, Job 5.20.

Promises to comfort in and deliver out of Captivity.
Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, Levit. 25.44.
and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them
a little Sanctuary in the countries where they shall come, Ezekiel. 11.16. See
ver. 17.

I will give you a reviving there, Ezra 9.8. And make you to be pitied of
those that shall carry you captive, Psalm. 106.46.

Then the LORD thy GOD will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee,
and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the LORD thy GOD
has scattered thee. This promise, Deuteronomy. 30.^. was performed by Christ, Luke 4
18. Ephesians. 4.8.
If any of thine be driven out unto the utmost parts of Heaven, from thence
will the LORD thy GOD gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee, etc.
Deuteronomy. 30.3, 4, 5. Nehemiah sueth out this promise, Nehem. 1.9.

There was a promise made unto Israel to restore them out of the great
captivity of Babylon; and this seemed to them as incredible, as for men to be
raised out of their graves, after so many years consumption; therefore they
said, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, we are cut off for our parts:
we have no more reason to believe any promise, or to rest upon any expectations
of deliverance, then dead bones have to revive again. Therefore the LORD
acquainteth them with his power, together with his promises; O my people, ye
shall know that I am the LORD, that is, that my ways and thoughts are
infinitely above your shallow apprehension, when I shall have brought you out
of your graves, Ezekiel. 37.11, 13, 14.

See Psalm. 14.7. and 53.6. Ier. 30.6.18.

A promise against Witchcraft or possession of the Devil.
Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination
against Israel, Number. 23.23.

This is promised conditionally; so far as it is good for GODS people, they
shall be freed from it.

Promises against Oppression.
It is one of the LORDS most royal titles, to be the Father of the
Fatherless, and a Judge of the widows, Psalm. 68.5. To be a Refuge for the
oppressed, Psalm. 22.24. Psalm. 140.12.
Psalm. 9.9, 10, 14. Esaias 25.4. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing
of the needy, now will I arise (says the LORD) I will set him in safety from
him that puffs at him, Exodus 22.23. Deuteronomy. 10.8. and 14.29. and 24.20.
Psalm. 12.5. He executes judgment for the oppressed, preserves the
strangers, relieveth the fatherless and widow, Psalm. 146.7, 9. In thee the
fatherless finds mercy, Hosea 14.3.

CHAP. IIII. Temporal promises in regard of good things.
1. In General, to supply any thing needful.
GOD has promised to provide things needful for the godly.

All earthly blessings are intailed to godliness by that gracious promise, 1 Timothy 4.8. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is, and that which
is to come.

It is said, Nothing shall be wanting, Psalm. 34.9. All things shall be
ministered, Matthew. 6.33. GOD shall fulfill all your necessity, Philip. 4.19.

As a tender Father desiring the welfare of his beloved child, bids him to be a
good and obedient child, and he shall not want any thing; so the LORD bids us
as good children, hearken to his voice, and be ruled by him, and tells us we
shall not want any thing that is good, Psalm. 34.8, 9, 10. and 84, 11.

This is that which is so often repeated, That it may go well with thee in the
land, which the LORD thy GOD gives thee, Deuteronomy. 5.16, 33. and 6.3, 18. and
12.25, 28.

This is meant in those Scriptures which set out the goodness of the LORD,
Thou ar^ good and do good. Psalm 119.68.
Psalm. 31.19. Psalm. 145.9. and many other places, where GODS goodness, loving
kindness and mercy, and that specially in things belonging to this natural
life, are commended unto us. In those general promises, wherein GOD says, He
will dwell with his, and not forsake them, that he will love and bless his
people, that he will be their GOD, will rejoice over them to do them good,
Ier. 32 41.
will compass them with favor as with a shield, that he will set peace in
their borders, and prosper them in all they go about, that he will keep his
Covenant with them. For outward riches are a part of his Covenant, All things
are yours, The Lord undertakes not only by single promise, but by Covenant to
furnish his people with all needful blessings pertaining to this life.
we are heirs of all the world. In the Covenant of grace, GOD promises not
only to write his law in our hearts and to forgive our sin; but also to
confer Temporal blessings, as they shall be serviceable to us in our journey
toward Heaven, Ier. 31.10, 11, 12, 14. Ezekiel. 34.25, 26, 27. and 36.29, 30.
Hosea 2.20, 21, 22.

He has given us his Son, the Fountain of all good things, what can he
deny us then that may be for our good and comfort? R^. good
The promise of CHRIST before his incarnation, was to the Jews a seal of all
temporal things promised.

Our Savior says, Seek ye first the Kingdom of GOD, and his
Righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. Mat. 6.33.
First] in time before all other things; and in degree above all other things,
and all these needful things] shall be cast in. As when a man buyeth spice,
fruit, or any such commodity, paper and packthred is given into the bargain.

It is the property of true saving faith, not only to lay hold on the mercy of
GOD for the pardon of sin, and life everlasting in CHRIST; but on his
promises also for Temporal blessings that concern this life. As we look to
be saved by our faith after death, so we must live (...) faith in this world;
if we rely upon his mercy for our souls, we must depend upon his providence
for our bodies. How does he trust in GOD for a Kingdom, that will not trust
him for a crust of bread?

Faith receives earthly blessings not as the fruit of our labor or desert,
but as the gifts of GODS bounty, yea as gifts of the gracious Covenant
proceeding from the free love of GOD.

GOD has promised, not only to give these outward things but to bless them to
his children.

CHAP. V. 2. Temporal Promises in regard of good things. 1. Special.
Promises to GODS children in respect of their Name.
1. Honor.
GOD says, He will honor those that honor him, 1 Samuel 2.30. Exodus 19 5.
Psalm. 91.14. Deuteronomy 28 1. Esaias 58.14. Psalm. 14^.18. Job 36.7.

If any man serve me, him will my Father honor, Ioh. 12 26.

His borne shall be exalted with hon^ur, Psalm. 113.9.

He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lift^th the needy out of the
dunghill, th^s he may (...) him with Princes, Psalm 113.7, 8 Deuteronomy. 28.13. Many
shall make store unto thee, Job ^1, 19.


And Wisdom will honor those that honor her, Pro. 4.7, 8, 9. So it is often
said, Riches and honor are with her, Pro. 3.16. and verse 35. The wise shall
inherit glory. So Chap. 13.18. He that regards reproof, shall be honored.
This is meant by all those speeches where it is said, that harkening to
instruction will adorn and bring into estimation, as costly ornaments of
bracelets, jewels and the like will do; so it is, Pro. 1.9. They shall be an
ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. See Chap. 3.22.
and 4.9.

The gracious woman receives honor, Pro. 11.16. Righteousness exalts a
na^ion, Prove. 14.34.

GOD does highly esteem of the godly himself. Since thou wast precious in my
sight, thou have been honorable and I have loved thee, Esaias 43.4. and he will
make the wicked to honor them. The evil bow before the good, and the wicked
at the gates of the righteous, Pro. 14.19. Behold I will make them of the
Synagogue of Satan to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have
loved thee, Rev. 3.9.

2. Good name.
A good name is better then precious ointment, Eccles. 7.1. and rather to be
chosen then great riches, Pro. 22.1.

GOD has made many promises concerning this.

The memory of the Just is blessed, Pro. 10.7.

I will make you a name and praise among all the people of the earth, says the
LORD, Zeph. 3.20.

I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off, Esaias 56.5.

The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance, Psalm. 112.6.

Promises to GODS children in respect of the Body.
1. Long life.
The LORD, that he may stir up his people to obedience, does make many
promises of long life, and many days; as in the fifth Commandment, Exodus 20.1^
which the Apostle says is the first Commandment with Promise, He that
follows afte^ righteousness, as a man follows a trade, shall find honor
and life, true honor and eternal life. Pro. 21.21.
Ephesians. 6.2. every child is there commanded to Honor his Father and Mother,
upon this promise, that his days may be long in the land. So Deuteronomy. 5.33. Deuteronomy.
25.15. and 30.20. In the Proverbes this is very often repeated, Chap. 3.1, 2. My
son forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments; for length
of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee. And 16. and 18. verses
of the same Chapter, and Chap. 4. from the 5. verse to 14. Chap. 8.35. Chap.
9.11. Chap. 10.25, 27. Chap. 11.19, 30. and 14.30. This GOD promised to
Solomon, See Esaias 65.20, 22. Psalm 91 16. Psalm. 1^8.6. Job 5.26.
1 King. 3.14. and the like is spoken more generally, that the Prince that
hates covetousness shall prolong his days, Prove. 28.16. and also Deuteronomy.
17.19, 20.

Long life is promised to the observers of the whole law, Deuteronomy. 6.2. and other
particular branches of it, Psalm. 34.12, 13, 14.

In all the perils of this life, by sickness, war, famine, thieves, or any
wicked enemy whatsoever, we may call to mind some of these promises and so
rest quiet thereupon, that none of these nor any thing else shall shorten our
days more then shall turn to our good.

2. Health.
GOD has promised bodily health and strength unto his people, that they may
enjoy and make use of these earthly comforts.

Solomon, Pro. 3.7. exhorting us to fear the LORD and depart from evil, adds
this as a promise, verse 8. It shall be health to thy navill, and marrow to thy
bones, that is, soundness of health to thy whole body, and Chap. 4.22. He
says, That the true receiving of instructions, is life to those that find
them, and health to all their flesh.

Bodily strength is often promised.

The LORD will give strength unto his people, Psalm. 29.11. See Psalm. 103.5.

3. Safety.
Then shall thou walk in thy way safely, Psalm. 121.3.
and thy foot shall not stumble, Pro. 3.23. See verse 26. 1 Samuel 2.9.

The Name of the LORD is a strong tower, An example hereof we have in David, 1 Samuel, 306. Psalm. 8 2. Ier 46.27 Micah. 4.4.
the righteous runs unto it and is safe, Pro. 18.10.

He that walks uprightly walks surely, Pro. 10.9.

Who so hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear
of evil, Prove. 1.33.

Thou shall be secure, because there is hope, yea thou shall dig about thee,
and thou shall take thy rest in safety, Job 11.18. See Psalm. 91.1, 3, 4, 5, 9,
10. 1 Pet. 3.13, 14.

When a man is in Covenant with GOD, he is in league with the creatures, and
therefore they shall never do him hurt, Genesis 9.2. Hos. 2.18.

Thou shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the
field shall be at peace with thee, Job 5.23.

4. Peace.
Peace in regard of outward troubles is a special blessing of GOD, and has
been in all ages promised by GOD to his Church, 1 Chronicles. 22.9.

And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall
make you afraid, Levit. 26.6.

The LORD will bless his people with peace, Psalm. 29.11.

The meek shall delight themselves in abundance of peace, Psalm. 37.11.

He makes peace in thy borders, Psalm. 147.14.

LORD thou will ordain peace for us, Esaias 26.12.

Thou shall know that thy Tabernacle shall be in peace, Job 5.29. Promises to
peaceable men or peacemakers, Mat. 5 9. Iam, 3, 16.
See Jam. 3.18. Esaias 48.18.

When a man's ways please the LORD, he will make his enemies at peace with
him, Prove. 16.6.

5. Sleep.
Promises for quiet rest and safety in the night.

When thou lie down, thou shall not be afraid, yea thou shall lie down, and
thy sleep shall be sweet, Pro. 3.24.

Also thou shall lie down and none shall make thee afraid, Job 11.19. Zeph.
3.13.

He gives his beloved sleep, Psalm. 127.2.

6. Food and raiment.
GOD has promised to give his children food unto content.

Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the Name of the LORD,
Joel 2.26.

Trust in the LORD, and do good, so shall thou dwell in the land, and verily
thou shall be fed, Psalm. 37.3.

He gives meat unto them that fear him, Psalm. 111.5.

He will satisfy the poor with bread, Psalm. 102.15.

He loves the stranger in giving him food and raiment, Deuteronomy. 10.18.

To such as want meat, drink, or apparel, CHRIST says, Matthew. 6.25. Is not
the life more then meat, and the body then raiment? It is an argument (as we
say) a maiori a^minus, from the greater to the lesser.

The LORD which gave the life it self, will not suffer us to want those things
that appertain to the sustaining of the same, and ver. 32. Your heavenly
Father (says he) knows that ye have need of these things, that is, food
and raiment. A man may know our wants, and yet say as it is, James 2.16.
another may desire to supply our wants, and yet not know them; but GOD 1.
Knows our wants: 2. Will supply them, for he is a Father: 3. Can supply them,
for he is a heavenly Father.

Promises to GODS children for their outward Estate.
1. Wealth.
GOD has promised his people such a portion of earthly goods, as shall be
needful for their more comfortable living in this world.

Riches and honor are with me, yea durable riches and righteousness. My
fruit is better then gold, yea then fine gold, and my revenue then choice
silver, Pro. 8.18, 19.

The blessing of the LORD makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it, Pro.
10.22. The LORD often promises plenty, that the land shall yield her fruit,
that he will give them rain in due season, that there should be none barren
but he would increase them in all their substance, 1 Cor. 9.6. Pro. ^1.23. Esaias
60, 17
both ground and cattle, that they should eat old store, that threshing
should reach unto Pestican, Osia^der, Iuni^a, Vatablu^, Lorinus, Cornelius a
Lap. do understand this promise touching the general blessing of (...), and
plenty to this people in this land, whilst they walked in obedience to Gods
Commandments, so Amos 9.13.
vintage. Ezekiel. 36.30. Joel 2.23, 24, 25. Levit. 26.4, 5, 10. and 25.19. See
Deuteronomy. 28. from 2. to 15. and Chap. 7. from 12. to 17. Psalm. 23. Psalm. 128. Pro.
3.9, 10, 16, 17, 18. and Chap. 8.21. 1 Chronicles. 29.12.

Those that wait upon the LORD shall inherit the earth, Psalm. 37.9. the like
is in the 11, 22, 29, 34. verses, and Mat. 5.5.

A good man leaves an inheritance to his childrens children: and the wealth of
the sinner is laid up for the Ps. 135.11, 12. and 136 21 22.
Just, Pro. 13.22. Wealth and riches shall be in his house, Psalm. 112.3. In the
house of the righteous is much treasure, Pro. 15.6. Thou shall lay up gold as
dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks, thou shall have
plenty of silver, Job 22.24, 25. That was a special promise made to the people
of Israel at their return; They shall flow together to the goodness of the
Lord for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock
and for the heard, etc. Jer. 31.12. I will open unto you the windows of
heaven, and power you out a blessing that there shall not be room to receive
it, Malac. 3.10.

2. Good success and prosperity.
GOD has promised prosperity to his children: Both to their persons, and their
purposes.

They shall prosper that love thee, Psalm. 122.6. Prosperity shall be within thy
palaces, ver. 7. Good understanding gives favor, Pro. 13.15. Do according to
all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee, We have excellent examples
of this in Jacob, Genesis 30 17 Joseph Genesis 39 2, 5. Hezekiah, 2 Chro^ ^1 21.
David, Psalm. 23
that thou may prosper whithersoever thou go, Josh. 1.7. Then shall thou
make they way prosperous, and then thou shall have good success, ver. 8. They
shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures, Job
36.11. And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delight some
land, Malac. 3.12. The LORD takes pleasure in the prosperity of his servants,
Psalm. 35.27. He that fears the LORD is and shall be blessed, See Ier. 33. ^
Hosea 14.5.
every way blessed, Psalm. 128.1, 2.3.

GOD will also give good success to their purposes and endeavors.

Deuteronomy. 29.9.
Whatsoever he does shall prosper, Psalm. 1.3. this was verified in Joseph, Genesis
39.3, 23.

Thou shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee, Deuteronomy.
28.8, 12.
and the light shall shine upon thy ways, Job 22.28. Commit thy way unto the
LORD, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass, Psalm. 37.5.

Promises to GODS children in respect of their Calling.
Diligence in a calling has many a sweet promise in the Word of GOD.

1. Abundance and plenty: The hand of the diligent makes rich, Pro. 10.4. The
soul of the diligent shall be made fat, Deuteronomy. 30.9
Pro. 13.4. He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread, Pro. 28.19. at
least sufficiency follows it. He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with
bread, Pro. 12.11. Two Promises to tillage.
See 27. verse. That which is gotten by honest labor is preserved and
multiplied, Prove. 13.11.

2. Protection: GOD has promised to protect those that keep themselves within
the limits of their calling; He shall give his Angels charge over thee to
keep thee in all thy ways, Psalm. 91.11. that is, Heb. 13.5
so long as thou keep thy self within the ways of thy calling, so long
shall my Angels preserve thee.

3. Promotion, it exalts to honor and authority. The han^ of the diligent
shall bear rule, Pro. 12.24. See thou a man diligent in his business? He
shall stan^ before Kings, he shall not stan^ before mean men, Prove. 22.29.

Thou shall eat the labor of thy hand, Psalm. 1.8.2.
4. Good success: The recompense of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him,
Pro. 12.14. They shall build houses and inhabit them, they shall plant
vineyards and eat^ the fruit of them. They shall not labor in vain nor bring
forth for trouble, Esaias 65.21, 23.

There ye shall eat before the LORD your GOD, and ye shall rejoice in all
that you put your hand unto; Ye and your households wherein the LORD thy GOD
has blessed thee, Deuteronomy. 12.7. Deuteronomy. 28.8, 12.

5. It builds the house, Pro 24.27.

6. It makes sleep comfortable, Eccles. 5.12. The sleep of a laboring man is
sweet and pleasant, whether he eat little or much: if little, his labor
breeds him rest; if much, his body being strong and hardened by labor, causes
easy digestion, and uninterrupted sleep.

CHAP. VI. GOD has promised not only to give these outward things, but to
bless them to his children.
HE will make that prosperous unto the Righteous which they possess, be it
little or much.

Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the
fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep.
Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store, Deuteronomy. 28.4, 5. Deuteronomy. 7.13, 14.

The LORD also will bless thy fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land,
thy corn, and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, the flocks
of thy sheep, there shall be neither male or female barre^ among them, or
among your cattle.

He shall not only enjoy the fruit of his labors, but also be blessed in his
fruit, Psalm. 128.1, 2.

The godly are in a better state for these outward things then the wicked, in
two respects:

1. They have a spiritual right to them which the wicked have not, they have
these outward things only by a general providence during GODS pleasure, but
the faithful have them as rewards of their righteousness, as testimonies of
GODS love and care of them.

2. They enjoy them as they are, A little that a righteous man has, is better
than the riches of many wicked Psalm. 37.16.
a little gives them more content then plenty others. Better is a little
righteousness, then great revenues without right, Prove. 16.8. more comfortable
in respect of inward peace, the present use of this life and continuance.
Better is a little with the fear of the LORD, then great treasure and trouble
therewith, Prove. 15.16, 17. The blessing of the LORD makes rich, and he
adds no sorrow with it, Prove. 10.22. GOD gives his beloved sleep, Psalm.
127.2. The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul, Pro. 13.25.

See Esaias 65.13. Eccles. 5.19. and 3.12, 13. Prove. 17.1

THE THIRD BOOK. Book III

CHAP. 1. 2. SPIRITVALL PROMISES. 1. In regard of evil, from Temptations 1. Of
Satan in general. 2. To uncleanness.

Comforts against the temptations of Satan.
THE Faithful have a promise to preserve them from such temptations as are
incident to their lawful callings, and which they cannot avoid unless they
would forsake their calling, Psalm. 91.11, 12. In all thy ways (seem they
never so dangerous and full of temptation) they shall bear thee up. Rev. 3.^.
The man whose heart is upright shall find strength enough against every
temptation, while he is in the LORDS way, Pro. 10.29. 2 Chronicles. 15.2.

There is much comfort to be drawn out of that one verse, 1 Cor. 10.13.

Et quam sortem patiuntur omnes, far nemo recusat. 1 Pet. 5.9. God will make
his grace sufficient for us, 2 Cor. 12.9.
1. It is the common condition of all the godly, to be tempted. There has no
temptation taken you but such as is common to man. 2. GOD will lay no more upon
us, then we shall be able to bear, GOD is faithful who will not suffer you
to be tempted above that you are able. 3. GOD will give a happy issue out of
temptation: Who will with the temptation also make away to escape, that ye may
be able to bear it.
Another consolation against them, may be the short continuance of our
temptations, We shall suffer but a while, 1 Pet. 5.10. The GOD of pe^ce shall
bruise Satan under your feet shortly, Romans 16.20.

We should consider, 1 That CHRIST was tempted as we are, Heb. 4.15.

2. That he is our Captain in this warfare, Rev. 12 7. The Captain of our
salvation was made perfect through sufferings, Heb. 2.10.

3. That he overcame the Devil for all his members; so it was promised to Adam
and prophesied of him, Genesis 3.15. so it was fulfilled by him, Mat. 4.1. And
having spoiled principalities and powers (that is, the Devil and his Angels)
He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them upon ^he Cross, Coloss.
2.15. He led captivity captive, Ephesians. 4.8. By captivity is meant sin and
Satan, which did and do lead men captive into perdition: Heb 2.14.1^
^. Death and the grave which held him captive for the space of three days. He
leads them all captive: 1. In himself, triumphing over them. 2. In his
members, Idem hortatur ut pugnemus, adiuvat ut vincamus, deficientes sublevat
and vincentes ceronat.
subduing and weakening their power.

4. That CHRIST is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb. 4.15.

5. That he has made intercession and prayed for us, Luke 22.32. I have
prayed that thy faith may not fail; that is general for all believers as well
as Peter, Ioh. 17.9, 10.

6. CHRIST succors and helps those that are tempted, Heb. 2.18.

7. He assures them of If GOD lead them in^o temptation, he will deliver them
from evil, Mat. 6.13.
strength and victory; Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you, Iam. 4.7.
He is like the Crocodile, whose property is, if one follow, it flies away; if
one fly, it pursues him; cowardice incourageth the Devil, courage daunts
him. See 1 John 5.18. Esa. 27.1. John 12.21. The The Devil is a Lion, so is
Christ, and that of the Tribe of Judah, there is a Lion for a Lion, courage for
courage: the Devil is a Serpent, so Christ called himself the brazen Serpent,
the^e is a Serpent for a Serpent wisdom for wisdom.
Devil is subtle, but GOD will teach wisdom to discern and disappoint his
stratagems, 2 Pet. 2.9. He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
Psalm. 91.3 He is strong and powerful; But GOD shall cover thee under his
wings, thou shall be Psalm ^0 12 1 Pet. 1.5. kept with all care as a garrison is
kept.
safe under his feathers, his strength shall be thy Buckler. ver. 4. He
dissolveth the works of the Devil, 1 John 3.8. He will tread Satan under our
feet. He shall bruise his head, wherein lies all his subtilty and strength.
Mat. 16.1^ Portarum appellatime urbes and con silio and pro pugna^u^^ munitas
intelligimus, i^ quicquid vel consilio vel viribus potest Satan Beza in locum.
The gates of Hell (that is, the power and policy of the Devil) shall not
prevail against the Church. For the gates were the places, where both their
strength was and their counsel sat, Amos 5.15.

2. Promises against Temptations to uncleanness.
He shall deliver thee from the strange woman, Prove. 2.16. Thy body shall be
kept blameless until the coming of CHRIST, 1 Thessalonians. 5.24 Who so pleases GOD
shall escape from her, Eccles. 7.26.

It is part of GODS Covenant to give us victory over all our enemies: this is
the great promise that GOD has made; That being delivered from the hands of
all our enemies, we might serve him in Holiness and Righteousness all the
d^ies of our life, Luke 1.74. When a child of GOD is to wrestle with Satan, or
any temptation or lust, he may challenge the Covenant at GODS hands, and say,
LORD have not thou said that Thou will deliver me out of the hands of all mine
enemies? Is it not a part of thy Covenant?

CHAP. II. 2. Promises against opposition for truth and goodness from persons,
which are either 1. Ill minded and oppose truth. 2. Ill livers and oppose
goodness.

1. Promises for those that suffer for the profession of the truth.
FOR I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not
be able to gainesay nor resist, An example of which promise we have in S.
Stephen, Act. 6.9, 10.
Luke 21.15.

When they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak, for it
shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak, Matt. 10.19.

Be not afraid (said GOD unto Paul) but speak, Ex 4, 11, 12 Psalm. 8.2. The
Apostles were persecuted for preaching the Gospel, Act. 4.3, 3. others for
believing and professing the Gospel, Act 9.2.
and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to
hurt thee, Acts 18.9, 10.

Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my
Father which is in Heaven, Matthew. 10.32.

2. Promises for those that suffer for the practice of good.
Daniel was cast into the Lions den for praying unto God, Dan 6.10. and Christ
was persecuted for doing works of mercy, Mat. 3.^.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is
the kingdom of Heaven, Matthew. 5.10. If ye suffer for righteousness sake,
happy are ye, 1 Pet. 3.14. Hereby they give their testimony to CHRIST and the
Gospel, when they partake of the afflictions of the Gospel, 2 Timothy 1.8.

And as there be promises for such as suffer either for truth or goodness, so
there are for such who suffer for both together, and these either

General in regard of any kind of suffering, as these following.

For if they suffer with CHRIST, they shall reign with him in another world, 2 Timothy 2.11, l2. When CHRIST appears in his glory, they shall be glad and
rejoice, 1 Pet. 4.13. What shall separate us from the love of CHRIST? shall
tribulation, distress, or persecution, etc* nay in all these things we are
more then conquerours, Occidi possumus, vinci non possamus
Romans 8.35, 36, 37.

GOD may turn the hearts of the wicked, 2 Thessalonians. 1.6.
and make them of Lions and Tigers, to become Lambs, and no more to do hurt
in the mountain of the LORD, Esaias 11.6, 7, 8, 9. Esaias 65.25.

GOD will subdue all their enemies; I will bless them that bless thee, and
curse them that curse thee, Genesis 12.3. See Deuteronomy. 30.7 Jer. 12.14. Psalm. 37.14,
15, 17. Job 8.22. Esaias 41.11, 12. and 54.15. and 59.19. Pro. 22.23. and 21.18.

Their troubles shall not be long, though violent, For the elects sake those
days shall be shortened, Matthew. 24.22.

Or Special, as Loss, 1. Of name, in reproaches. 2. Of liberty, in
imprisonment. 3. Of goods, any or all. 4. Of life it self.


Promises to those that suffer reproaches for both truth and goodness.
1. Reproaches and scorns from the world for thy profession, should fill thy
heart with abundance of glory, blessedness and joy. If ye be reproached for
the name of CHRIST, happy are ye (says S. Peter) for the Spirit of glory and
of GOD rests upon you, The very kind and cause of the a^fliction should be an
argument of great consolation.
1 Pet. 4.14. that is, such a Spirit shall rest on you, which shall make you
glorious. Blessed are you (says CHRIST himself) when men shall revile, and
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my
sake, Iam. 1.2. Psalm. 69 7, 9, 10. Act. 5 41.
rejoice and be exceeding glad, Matthew. 5.11, 12. Leap for joy, so it is, Luke
6.23. and the word here in Matthew. signifies exceeding joy, such as we use to
express by outward signs in the body, as skipping and dancing, 2 Samuel 6.14,
16. For great is your reward in Heaven.

Thou art honorable in GODS account, Esaias 43.4. he takes notice of all thy
disgraces, Psalm. 69.19. and will take care for thy clearing and comfort, He
will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgments as the
noone day, Psalm. 37.6. As if he should have said, howsoever thy innocence be
at sometimes covered as it were with a thick and dark mist of slander and
oppression, yet the LORD will in his good time scatter and dissolve the mist,
and so make thy innocence apparent to the world; yea he shall make thy
righteous cause, as evident as the Sun when it arises, nay as noone day when
it is at highest, and shines brightest. Thou shall receive double for all thy
shame, Esaias 61.7. Though you have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the
wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold, Psalm
68.13. that is, although ye have lived in great streights and baseness, yet
ye shall be freed from them, Scurtilities and odious nicknames in this kind
are so many honorable badges of thy Christian magnanimity, and at the throne
of Christ will be certainly reputed as characters of special honor, and
remembrances of thy worthy service, Bolton.

Esaias 16 1^.


and obtain illustrious glory.

They shall be honored in the day of CHRIST, 1 Pet. 1.7. Their reward shall be
great in Heaven, Mat. 5.12. and in the mean time there is with GOD a hiding
place from the strife of tongues, Psalm. 31.20. Job 5.21. Psalm. 13.18. How does
GOD cheer his people, Esaias 41. Fear not, be not dismayed, ver. 10. I am with
thee, I am thy GOD, I will strengthen thee, yea I will uphold thee with the
right hand of my righteousness. But GOD will bring the wicked to shame for the
contempt with which they have disho^oured his servants, as it follows, ver.
11. All they that were incensed against thee, shall be ashamed and confounded.
He still incourageth his people there, ver. 13. He says again: Fear not, for
I the LORD thy GOD will help thee, Esaias 43. c. 2. Esaias 44.2.
and ver. 14. Fear not thou worm, (that is, were thy state never so weak and
despicable) I will help thee, says the LORD and thy Redeemer. He begins the
43. Chap. with the same words; Fear not, viz. thine enemies, for I have called
thee, and redeemed thee, thou art mine. Fear not little flock (says our
Savior) fear not men, fear not means, for it is your Fathers pleasure to
give you a Kingdom. Luke 12.32.
See Ier. 46.27, 28.

If thou would be delivered from reproaches and evil report, go to the LORD
and urge him upon Covenant; say, LORD thou have said, Thou will bless the name
of the righteous, thou will honor them that honor thee, that we shall not be
ashamed when we have respect unto all thy Commandments, Psalm. 119.6. Sue out
this promise upon all occasions, as David often does, Psalm. 31.1, 17 and
119.116.

2. Promises to those that are imprisoned for the Gospel.
The LORD hears the poor and despises not his prisoners, Psalm. 69.33. He
hears the groanings of the prisoner, Psalm. 102.20. And brings out those
that are bound with chains, Psalm. 68.6. as he did Peter, Acts 12.10. Fear
non^ of those things which thou shall suffer: behold the Devil shall cast some
of you into prison that ye may be tried, and ye shall have tribulation ten
days: be thou faithful unto the death, Rev. 2.10.
and I will give thee a crown of life. Here was a bittersweet message, Ye
shall be cast into prison: Act. 16.25.
This was bitter: fear not, this was comfortable; but I will give thee a
crown of life, this was the comfort of comforts.

3. Promises to those that loose outward things for GODS cause.
In losses for GODS cause:

We should meditate of GODS gracious promises.

1. In the loss of outward things for thy love and service unto GOD, remember
that place, 2 Chronicles. 25.9. The LORD is able to give thee much more then this.

2. In the loss of any earthly blessing for GODS cause, call to mind that
promise three times set down by the Evangelists: Every one that has forsaken
houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, An excellent example of this we
have in Job 46 10, 1^.
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names sake, shall receive an
hundred Which is termed by S. Augustine the best and greatest usury.
fold, and shall inherit everlasting life, Mat. 19.29. Mark 10.29, 30. Has it
for my sake and the Gospels, Luke 18.29, 30. For the kingdom of GODS sake.

3. In the loss of any earthly things in every kind, think of that speech,
Hab. 3.17, 18. Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be
in the vines: the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield
no meat, the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no
heard in the stalles: Yet I will rejoice in the LORD: I will joy in the GOD of
my salvation. Consider also Jobs patient blessing of GOD, upon the surprise and
concurrence of an universal misery, Job 1.22.

4. Promises to those that loose their life for GODS cause.
4. When thou art like to loose thy life, m^ditate on those places, Mat. 10 39.
He that finds his life shall loose it, Ioh 12 25
and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it. Blessed is the man
that endures temptation, (yea though it be the fiery trial) for he shall
receive the crown of life, Jam. 1.12. Rev. 14 13 Q^i moriuntur Domini ciusa,
id est, propter Dominum. Beza.

1 Pet. 4 16.


Blessed are the dead which die in LORD; and which die for the LORD: he speaks
of such as suffered in the quarrel of CHRIST under Antichrist, they rest from
their labors, and their works do follow them. Every drop of blood spilt by a
true professor of the Gospel, for the constant and found profession of it, is
precious in the sight of GOD, Psalm. 116.15. Precious in the sight of the LORD
is the death of his Saints.

CHAP. III Promises against evils in the world,
1. In general.
WHosoever is borne of GOD overcommeth the world, and this is the victory that
overcommeth the world, even our faith, 1 John 5.4. CHRIST prayed to his Father,
To keep his from the evil of the world, Joh. 17.15. 2 Pet. 1.4.
Who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present
evil world, Gal. 1.4. Our Savior, John 16.33. tells his Disciples, That in
the world they should have tribulation, but be of good cheer (says he) I
have overcome the world.

2. A promise to those that dislike evil company.
I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their GOD, and they
shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate
says the LORD, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and I
will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, says the
LORD Almighty, 2 Cor. 6.16, 17, 18.

3. Promises against worldly cares and covetousness.
To curb our hearts from covetousness, we should meditate upon these places,
Heb. 13.5. There are five negatives together in the Original that strongly
affirm, as if he should say, tell thee I will never forsake thee, I tell thee
I will never forsake thee and so five times.

We are to pray that every thing which causes offense in the Church may be
removed, for which we have an express promise, Mat. 13 41.


I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. He that gave us his own son, how
shall he not with him freely give us all things, Romans 8.32. See Matthew. 6.25.
to the end. Phil. 4.6. 1 Timothy 4.8. 1 Pet. 5.7.

4. Promises against Scandales.
GOD will secure his people and save them from being ensnared by scandals,
Psalm. 119.165. and nothing shall offend them, or they shall have no stumbling
block. Ier. 31.9.

CHAP. IIII. Infirmities are, 1. General, as sinfullnesse of nature, that
remains, though it reign not. 2. Special.

1. IGnorance. 2. Spiritual deafness. 3. Slips and frailties. Here Promises
1. To keep them from falling. 2. To comfort them being fallen, and restore
them again.
4. Spiritual lamenesse. 5. Doubts and fears of losing the love of GOD. 6.
Forgetfullnesse. 7. Dullness and uncheerefullnesse. 8. Indisposition to good.
9. Distractions in good. 10. Evils of good done. 11. Fears of falling away
from GOD.
Comforts to the godly, who likewise want the means of grace, either
altogether, or in the power of them, or having them do not profit by them.

1. General or daily Infirmities. Comforts to those that do fall though
Infirmity.
The LORD, The LORD GOD, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant
in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity,
transgression and sin, Exodus 34.6, 7.

He is JEHOVAH] Always the same, unchangeable, he will not alter his love to
thee, and for the more assurance he repeateth that title twice; then follows
his power, GOD El the strong God, Deu^ fort^, a. Tr^melliu^ renders it.
] Though thou be weak, he is strong. Mercifull] or compassionate toward
rep^ntant and believing sinners, and though they be unworthy, yet he is
Gracious.] The Hebrew word signifies to power out abundance of extraordinary
bounty upon a most undeserving and ill deserving party. (He will show mercy,
not because thou art good, but because he is Good; not because thou can
please him, but because mercy pleases him, Micah 7.18.) though thou offerdest
daily, yet he is Long-suffering,] and Abundant in goodness and truth] 1. In
Goodnesse] ready to bestow all benefits. 2. In Truth,] ready to fulfill all
promises, As ^03, Psalm. 8 the same Hebrew word is used, and should be so
translated iniquity] that is, original corruption, transgression] that is,
actual rebellion, sin] that is, sin of custom.
keeping kindness for thousands,] a certain number for an uncertain;
forgiving iniquity, transgression and sinne] that is, sins of all sorts,
kinds and degrees whatsoever. It is neither the foulness of sin, nor the
multitude of sins, nor the long continuance in sin that can prejudice his
goodness. God will pass by our mere frailties. There is no god like unto him
for passi^g by transgressions. Micah 7.18. Dan. 9.9. Psalm. 1^0 3, 4. 1 Ioh. 2
1, 2.


GOD upon our prayer will cure our infirmities, Esaias 40.29. Psalm. 103.3. he
pittieth his in their infirmities, as an Indulgent ^ather his little ones, Mal.
3.17. CHRIST himself is affected with the sense of our infirmities, Heb. 4.15,
16. Matthew. 11.28. and Esaias 42.3. he was a Pro^itiation for such sins, and
comforts us concerning them before they be committed, 1 John 2.12. Romans 6.14.
The Spirit helps our ^nfirmities, (...), the same word i^ used, Luke 10 40.

Est metaphora ab oneribus sumpta, quae utrinque admotis manibus sublevantur.
Beza.


Romans 8.26. helps together: the Greek word is decompound, and there is a
great force in it; as two that carry a burden, one will carry over against
another, and put to his ^and and help him; so when we begin to sink, GODS
Spirit puts under his hand to support ^s, which is said in so many words, Psalm.
37.24.

O but I offend daily, I sin again and again, may some weak Christian say.

GOD promises likewise that he will multiply his pardons (so the word
signifies in the Original) as thou have multiplied thy sins, Esaias 55 7, 8, 9
for (says he there) My thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor my ways as
your ways, but my thoughts go beyond your thoughts, as much as the distance
is between Heaven and earth: He is merciful and and gracious, slow to anger,
and plenteous in mercy, he will not reward us after our iniquities: for as the
Heaven is high above the Earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear
him, Psalm. 103.8, 10, 11. As there is a continual spring of wickedness in
you, so there is a continual spring of mercy Thou can not commit more then
God can remit; Thy sins are but the sins of men, his mercies are the mercies of
an Infinite God.
flowing from him, both to pardon, and wash away this iniquity.

Special Infirmities. 1. Ignorance or blindness. Comforts against ignorance.
It is a special promise of GOD in the new Covenant, In Christ's Kingdom the
eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be
unstopped, 2 Cor. 3.16 Ioh. 9 39. and 12.46.
that He will write his laws in thy heart, and he will make thee to know the
LORD.

He has promised to lead thee by a way that thou have not known, Esaias 42.16.
we have such an High Priest as knows how to have compassion on the ignorant,
Heb. 5.2, 3. The eyes of the blind shall be opened, Esaias 35.2. He shall open
the eyes of the blind, Esaias 42.2. Luke 4.18.

The anointing thou have received, shall teach thee all needful things, and
lead thee into all truth, 1 Ioh. 2.27.

GOD has made many promises to teach them his way, that see their ignorance
and mourn for it.

He will guide the meek in judgment and will teach the humble his way, Psalm.
25.9. See 12. and 14. verses.

GOD will fill the hungry with good things, Luke 1.53.

To him that disposes his way aright will I show the salvation of the LORD,
Psalm. 50.23.

He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
of life, Joh. 8.12. I will manifest my self to him, John 14.21. The Spirit of
truth will guide them into all truth, John 16.13. A high way shall be there,
and fools shall not err therein, Esaias 35.8.

2. Spiritual deafness. Comforts against spiritual deafness.
The cares of the deaf shall be unstopped, Esaias 35.5. Other sheep I have
which are not of this fold, them also I must bring, and they shall hear my
voice, Ioh. 10.16. that is, the Gentiles not yet called shall understand the
voice of GOD.

3. Particular falls through frailty. Comforts in regard of slips and frailties.
1. GOD will uphold his and keep them from falling.

I pray not that thou should take them out of the world, but that thou
should keep them from the evil, Joh. 17.20. The LORD is faithful, who
shall stablish you and keep you from evil, 2 Thessalonians. 3.3. That your whole
soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our LORD JESUS
CHRIST. Faithful is he that calls you, who ^lso will do it, 1 Thessalonians. 5.23,
24. GOD watches over his people to defend them from sin, 2 Timothy 4 17, 18.
Romans 7.24, 25. Psa. 73.23, 24. Ier. 32.39, 40. His mercy holds up the godly,
when they say their foot slippeth, Psalm. 94.18. He will be their confidence,
and shall keep their foot from being taken, Pro. 3.26. He will keep the feet
of his Saints, 1 Samuel 2.9. And guide their feet into the way of peace, Luke
1.79. And thine ear shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way,
walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the
left, Esaias 30.21.

The child of GOD has a promise of preservation from the sin unpardonable,
1 John 5.18.

2. Comforts to those that do fall through infirmity.

But of this I have spoken already, when I treated of the daily and general
Infirmities of Christians, therefore I will (tanquam can^s ad Nilum) run over
it hastily.

GODS people after relapse into some old, or fall into some new sin, when
their heart is smitten for it, may comfort themselves with such precious places
as these, 1 Ioh. 2.1. Luke 17.4. 1 Samuel 12.20, 22. 1 John 1.9.

From this last place, a reverend Divine collects this comfort. If we see our
unworthiness, and with broken hearts acknowledge it, GOD is faithful and just
to forgive it, be it never so great.

Thou have played the harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me says
the LORD, Ier. 3.1.

3. The LORD will restore them, and raise them up again by repentance. Return
ye (...) and I will heal you^ b^ckesl^din^s. Ier. 3.2^ See 12, 13, 1^. verses.
The LORD will heal thy backesliding, if thou take unto thee words to confess
thy falling away, Hosea 14.2, 3, 4. There is healing in the wings of the Son
of righteousness, and you shall grow up as the calves of the stall, Mal. 4.2.
The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raises up all those that are bowed
down, Psalm. 145.14. Behold I will bring it health and cure, Psalm. 103 3.
and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and
truth, Ier. 32.6.

He speaks Ezekiel. 34.16. of the time of the Gospel when CHRIST should be the
Shepherd, and shows the Covenant that he will make with those that are his,
if any thing be lost (says he) if a Sheep lose it self, this is my Covenant,
I will find it. If it be driven away by any violence of temptation, I will
bring it back again. If there be a breach made into their hearts by any
occasion through sin and lust, I will heal them and bind them up.

GODS Covenant is to make us faithful in his Covenant: the actions of faith
and repentance are ours; but the power of doing them, GODS.

4. Spiritual Lamenesse. Comforts against Spiritual Lamenesse, or weaknesses
of graces.
Then shall the lame man leap as an Heart, Esaias 35.6. And I will put my spirit
within you, Ier. 31.9.
and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and
do them, Ezekiel. 36.27. Psalm. 29.11.
They shall run and not be weary, Mark the gradation, they shall walk, they
shall run, they shall fly, yea, as an Eagle.
they shall walk and not be saint, Esaias 40.31. See ver. 29. The LORD will be
the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel, Joel 3 16.

In our Spiritual infancy we may comfort our selves by those cordi^ll
refreshing promises.

I will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life
freely, Rev. 21.6. Esaias 57 15. Mat. 5.6.
A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not
quench, Esaias 42.3. though grace be in us but like the heat in the week of the
candle, when the light is out; yet GOD has taken order, that it shall not be
extinguished. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd, he shall gather the
lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead
those that are with young, Esaias 40.11. He will use all compassion with a
tender respect of our weakness. In love, in care, in pity he will redeem
us, and carry us as in the days of old, Esaias 63.9. As he has borne us from
the womb; so will he be the same still unto old age, even unto the gray
hairs, he will carry us in the arms of his compassion, he has made us, he
will bear, even he will carry and deliver us, Esaias 46.3, 4. Since thou art a
branch of his planting, Rev. 3 8, 9, 10
he may glorify himself in thee, so as thy little one may be as a thousand,
and thy small one as a strong nation, GOD can perform it in his due time, Esaias
60.21, 22.

CHRIST graciously receives and tenderly cherishes weak Christians, Zach.
13.7. Matthew. 18.5. He gives charge against the contempt of them, verse 10.
and will not have the day of small things despised, Zach. 4.10.

God acce^^s affecting for a^^e^ting, willing for working, desires for deed^,
purposes for performances, pence for pounds. Dyke.

Examples are many in Scripture, Ge^ 2^ 16, 17 Reb. 11.17 1 Chronicles. 17 10, 11,
12 Luke 21.3.


The obedience o^ the faithful is weak and imperfect, but pleasing and
acceptable unto GOD. The Psalmist says, Psalm. 147.11 and 149.4.

The LORD takes pleasure in his people, Pro 15.8.
the prayers of the upright are his delight.

GOD will reckon of so much good done by us, as we desired and endeavored to
do; the preparations of our hearts are reckoned with GOD as great things, Esaias
55.1.

This is a great comfort to GODS children, The best gold must have his
allowance of such grains, so the best Christian must have some allowance,
imperfection clea^e^ to him, he can not do all perfectly, for then what need^
the Covenant of grace.
that do their best endeavor to keep all his Commandments, for though they
fail in that obedience which they ought to perform, yet GOD promises to show
mercy to them, Exodus 26.6. so long as their heart is true, he will bear with
their infirmities.

We are not under the law (says the Apostle) but under grace, Romans 6.14. We
are delivered from the rigor of the Law: GOD has received us to the benefit
of that Covenant, in which perfection is only required in CHRIST, uprightness
in us. GOD accepts of the will for the deed, Col. 3.24.
2 Cor. 8.12. and the will above the deed, as appears by the 10. verse, Who
has not only begun to do, but also to be forward a year ago; making it a
greater grace to be willing and desirous to do well, then it is to do a good
thing.

5. Doubts and Fears of losing the love of GOD. Comforts against doubts and
fears of loosing the love of GOD.
In the affliction of thy mind and loss of the feeling of GODS favor, Ier
31.12, 25
acquaint thy self with those promises, John 13.1. Having loved his own which
were in the world, he loved them unto the end, and without end. The Rom 11.29
gifts and calling of GOD are without repentance: that is, such gifts as
accompany an effectual calling, are such as GOD never repents of, or takes
away, I will not forsake my people, 1 King. 6.13. Heb. 13.5. Behold GOD will
not cast away a perfect man, Job 8.20. The love of GOD unto his child, in
respect of tenderness, is infinitely dearer then that of a most loving mother
to her little one, Esaias 49.15. stronger then the stony mountains and rocks of
flint, Esaias 54.10. as constant as the waters of Noah, ver. 9. as the ordinances
of Heaven. Ier. 33.20 and ver. 25. nay as sure as GOD himself, Psalm. 89.33,
34, 35.

6. Forgetfullnesse. A promise against forgetfullnesse.
But the Comforter which is the HOLY GHOST whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance
whatsoever I have said unto you, John 14.26.

7. Vncheerefullnesse. Comforts against dullness and uncheerefullnesse.
The wilderness and solitary place shall be glad for them, and the desert
shall rejoice and blossom as the rose, it shall blossom abundantly, and
rejoice even with joy and singing, Esaias 35.1, 2. Then shall ye suck, ye
shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees. As one whom his
mother comfort, so will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in
Jerusalem. And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall
flourish like an herb, Jer. 66.12, 13, 14. Thou shall rejoice in the LORD,
Esaias 41.16. Thou shall have thy delight in the Almighty, Job 22.26.

The godly have a spring of joy within them, John 4.14. In thy name shall they
rejoice all the day, Psalm. 89.16. See Psalm. 33.21.

8. Indisposition. Comforts against it.
In the thoughts of our indisposi^ion to any thing that is good, let these
places quicken us.

I can do all things through CHRIST that strengthens me, Phil. 4.13. Ye
shall be unto me a kingdom of Priests, Exodus 19.6.

We shall be able to offer unto GOD the sacrifice of prayer or praise. In every
place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering, Mal. 1.11.
which is spoken of the believing Gentiles.

9. Distractions. Comforts against them.
GOD promises in the Covenant of grace, Ezekiel. 11.19. To give his people one
heart. CHRIST prayed that we might have this one heart, John 17.21, 23. and be
one with GOD. When we are troubled with distractions in prayer, hearing, or
meditation, we should plead the Covenant, and pray with David, O LORD unite
my heart to thee.

10. Evils of good done. Promises or comforts to the godly for evils of good
done.
GOD not only accepts and takes in good part the poorest service we do to
him notwithstanding our corruptions and frailties, but even delights and
takes great pleasure in them, Cant. 2.14. as a Father delights more in the
stammering of his little child, then in the eloquence of the best Orator.
CHRIST presents and perfumeth our prayers to his Father, Rev. 8.3. 1 Pet.
2.5. And it shall be upon Aarons forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity
of the holy things, and that they may be accepted before the LORD, Exodus 28.38.
Accipit suum, and remittituum, God accepts that which is his, and forgives that
which is thine.
Aaron was a Type of CHRIST, who by his intercession perfumes our prayers, and
does away the blemishes that cleave to our best actions. Loving Parents do not
take notice of many blemishes in their children; so GOD sees no iniquity in
Jacob, nor any transgression in Israel, Number. 23.21. But passes by the
transgression of the remnant of his heritage: Micah. 7 18
which makes the Prophet in the beginning of the verse, in admiration to cry,
Who is a GOD like to thee!

11. Comforts against Fears of their falling from GOD, who labor to work out
their salvation with fear and trembling.
1. In regard of GOD.

Romans 9 11. Mat. 25 23, 24. 2 Timothy 2 19.

Singula ve^ba po^du^ habem, certitudo haec nititur ^ sundamento, 2 non
quocunque sed sirmo, 3 non hominu sed Dei, 4 non vacillan^e s^d stante i^lque
o^signato, ^dque notitia Dei, non si^pl^^u satum inspection^, sed disce^nen^e
sum a non sun. O. Prideaux.


1. His Counsel, on which man's salvation is founded, is sure and unchangeable,
and his calling without repentance, Romans 11.29. 2. His Love is everlasting and
inviolable, Ier. 31.3. Romans 8.35. ult. 3. His Mercy (like his Lov^) is
^verlasting, Psalm. 103.17. Psalm. 100.5.106.1. and 107.1. Luke 1.50. It is
iterated 26. times in 136. Psalm. 4. His Will is for such, Luke 12.32. 1 Pet.
1.5. Kept by the guard of Gods power unt^ salvation, Phil. 4.7. Keep with a
guard as Kings are kept, Ps. 132.11.
John 6.39. His Grace, and that is all-sufficient, 2 Cor. 12.9. 5. His Power is
for such, and that is Almighty, Ioh 10.27, 28, 29. Jude 24.2 Tim. 1.12. 6. His
faithfulness and truth make both for this, 2 Thessalonians. 3.3.
2. In regard of CHRIST.

1. Because of our union with him: Our assurance is not in o^r self, b^t in
Christ; as we la^ hold of Man, so he fa^^ holde^h u^; and as he has prayed
that our faith fail not us, so neither will he let go his hold Ioh 10 27, 28,
29 Heb 7 25 Phil ^ 7.
He is the Head, we the members. and he will not suffer any to perish that are
ingraffed into him, Ioh. 6.39. Ioh. 17.22, 23, 26. 2. From the perpetual
efficacy of his intercession, Romans 8.34. Heb. 7.21. He is a Priest for ever,
and always intercedes for his. What he said to Peter, S. Austen says, A
mighty man will not loose that which he has bought for his money, and will
Christ loose ^h^t which He has bought with his blood?
I have prayed that thy faith fail not, Luke 22.32. He performs for all. He
is the Author and finishe^ of our faith, Heb. 12.2.
3. In regard of the HOLY GHOST.

1. His continual assistance, Esaias 59.21. 1 Cor 3.16.
He shall abide with us for ever, John 14.16. And he which has begun a good
work, will finish it, Phil. 1.6. The nature of a seal is to make things sure,
Dan 6.8. Mat 27.66. a writing in firm amongst men, when the seal is put to it.
2. His Obsignation which is irrevocable: every one that believes, is sealed by
the holy Spirit of promise, Ephesians. 1.13, 14. sealed for ever, 4.30. 2 Cor.
1.22. an honest man will not break his bargain, when there is earnest and
evidence for it; therefore Chrysostom says elegantly, if GOD having once
given this earnest, should not also give the rest of the inheritance, He should
undergo the loss of his earnest.
4. The lasting power of the Word once rooted in the good and honest heart,
Luke 8.15. It is called immortal seed, 1 Pet. 1.23, 25. The engraffed Word,
James 1.21. The seed remaining, 1 John 3.9.

5. The certainty and sweetness of the promises to this purpose. Zach 10.12
John 8.12. 2 Samuel 7 14 15.
GOD has promised that his people shall not be moved from the state of grace,
The book of Psalms is full of ^he^e comfortable promises. Psalm. 1, 3. and
9.10.18. Ps 112.6.19. and 73.24, ^6. Ps. 103.17. and 145.14. Ps. 8^.33.
Psalm. 15.5. and 16.8. Psalm. 37.24, 27, 28, 31. Psalm. 55.22. and 102.28. Pro.
10.30. Psalm. 125.1. He will not cast off his people nor forsake his
inheritance, Psalm. 94.14. 1 Samuel 12.22. And he will put his fear into their
hearts, that they shall not depart from him. For this is his Covenant with his
people. Ier. 32.39, 40, 41. Hosea 2.19, 20. He upholdeth them with his hand,
that they shall not fall away. He will confirm them unto the end, that they
may be blam^lesse in the day of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, Ioh. 6.35, 37 51, 53.
and 5.24.
1 Cor. 1.8, 9. the like is, 1 Thessalonians. 5.23, 24 GOD has made more promises to
hold up his children, then ever he made to hold up the pillars of the world.

6. The prayers of the whole Church of GOD which are very prevalent and
powerful, Ioh. 16.23. the daily sacrifice of believers, is, ne inducas in
tentationem.

7. The force and might of faith, 1 Pet. 1.2, 3, 4, 5.

8. The durable vigor of saving graces, John 4.14. our Savior has promised,
John 16.22. that he will give unto the faithful such constant and permanent
joy, as no man shall be able to take from them: He has prayed that our faith
may not fail, Luke 22.32. It is a stable grace, 1 Ioh. 5.4. 1 Pet. 2.6.

Comforts to the Godly, who are troubled with many and strong corruptions, and
likewise want the means of grace, either 1. Altogether. 2. In the power of
them. 3. Or having them so, yet profit not by them.



1. Comforts in case of dismayednesse under many and strong corruptions. Act 3
26.

I will sprinkle clean water upon you, The faithful (that they may have
comfort against their corruptions) must by beholding the promise^, fly unto
Christ, and clea^e the faster to Him, Romans 7 25. Phil. 3.9.
and you shall be clean from all your filthiness, and from all your idols
will I cleanse you, Ezekiel. 36.25. Though thy sins were as great as Idolatry in
the first Table, or Whoredom in the second, yet GOD will forgive and sanctify
thee.

He will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea, Micah. 7.19. The sea
can drown mountains as well as mole-hills: Though they were as crimson and
scarlet, which will take no other die, yet in CHRIST'S blood they shall be made
as white as wool and snow, Esaias 1.18. All manner of sins and blasphemies
shall be forgiven unto men, Matthew. 12.31. CHRIST came to save sinners, 1 Timothy
1.15. It matters not what the wound is, so CHRIST be the Physician. Where sin,
that is, the knowledge and feeling of sin abounded, grace over-abounded, Romans
5.20. have we a multitude and magnitude of sins? GOD has a multitude and
magnitude of mercies: Have mercy upon me O GOD according unto the multitude,
Psalm. 51.1.
so we translate it, (the Hebrew word Rob, (...) See 2 Samuel 24.4. His mercies
are greater many. Spare me O God according to the greatness or multitude of thy
mercy.

Neh. 13 22.


signifies also magnitude) of thy tender mercies. Two things terrify penitent
sinners: 1. The multitude and exceeding great number of evils whereof they are
guilty, he tells them in that 26. Ezekiel. that he would Psalm. 130 8
wash them from all their filthiness, without exception, 1 John 1.9. therefore
let us not put in conditions where GOD does not, and as it were interline his
Covenant. 2. That their sins have been heinous and extraordinary, Zach.
13.1. He promises to open a fountain of grace to wash them from all sins;
CHRIST has discharged our pounds as well as our pence. He came to take away
the sins of the world, this is spoken indefinitely.

2. Comforts to such who are troubled for want of the means of grace, either
Altogether.
After GOD has given you the bread of affliction, Comforts to those that want,
or have lost the means of knowledge, their teachers are taken from them.
and the water of adversity, he will restore teachers and no more restrain
instruction, Esaias 30.20.

Though thou see no way of help, yet thou know not how GOD can provide, He
can open rivers on the tops of mountains, and he makes the wilderness a
standing poole, when his people thirst and cry unto him, Esaias 41.17, 18.

If ordinary means fail, GOD will then ^^pply of his Spirit; I will be unto
them as a little Sanctuary in the countries where they shall come, Ez^k. 11.16.
I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will ^r^ng you in
Sion, Jer. 3.14. The LORD gives the Word, great is the company of preachers,
Psalm. 68.11.

The rans^med of the LORD shall return and come to Sion with songs, and
everlasting joy upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, and
sorrow and sighing shall fly away. E^ay 35.10.

Or in the power of them.

I will give you Pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with
knowledge and understanding, Ier. 3.15.

Or having them so, and not profiting by them. In our spiritual barrenness
lamen^ed,


I am the LORD thy GOD which teaches thee to profit, which leads thee by the
way which thou should go, Esaias 48.17.

For thy Maker is thine husband, etc. Esaias 54.5, 6. Hosea 2.19.

In the wilderness shall waters break out, See 1 and 2. verses.
and streams in the desert, and the parched ground shall become a poole, and
the thirsty land-springs of water, Esaias 35.6, 7. that is, the most barren heart
shall abound with grace, according to that promise, Out of their bellies shall
flow rivers of living water, John 7.38. streaming out for the good of others.
The Kingdom of GOD shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing
forth the fruits thereof, Matthew. 21.43. This is a promise, that the Gentiles
shall bring forth the fruits of the Gospel, therefore every believing Gentile
may apply it.

The use of Faith here is, to uphold us against our manifold de^ects,
infirmities and imperfecti^ns. For first, it gives evidence to our souls,
that the graces we have are the gifts of GOD, because GOD promises them.
Secondly, it makes us rest on GOD for perfecting of that good work which he
has so graciously begun.

The Godly that know they fear GOD unfainedly, and yet are often perplexed,
because all sensible tokens of GODS favor are taken from them, should 1.
Acquaint themselves with the promises, and comfort themselves with these words,
they will be as flagons of wine to all distressed spirits. 2. Let them not
consider too much of, nor reason too much with their temptations, Romans 4.19. 3.
Though they feel nothing, yet let them say with David, Psalm. 56.10. In GOD
will I praise his Word, in the LORD will I praise his Word.

CHAP. V. 5. In regard of GOD, Desertions.
Comforts to GODS people in spiritual desertions.
1. LEt them Consider, that this has befallen the best of GODS servants. Job
6.4, 13.16.9. David, Luther confesses of himself, that after his conversion,
he lay three years in desparation.
Psalm. 6. and 77. and CHRIST himself, Mat. 27.46. CHRIST (says Greenham) was
forsaken for a few hours, David for a few months, and Job for a few years.

2. GOD does not forsake them, Heb. 13.5. Non deserit etiamsi deserere
videatur, non deserit etiamsi deserat. Austen.
Esaias 49.15, 16. but seems to forsake them.

3. Desertion is but short, compared with the time of mercy, For a small moment
have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little
wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with everlasting kindness
will I have mercy on thee, says the LORD thy Redeemer, Esaias 57.18, 19.
Esaias 54.7, 8.

He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever, Psalm.
103.9. The LORD will not cast off for ever, but though he cause grief, yet
will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies, Lam. 3.31,
32.

4. GOD waits for a fit season of showing his favor toward them, Esaias 30.18.

We ought to live by faith, Hab. 2.4. waiting for GOD who hides his face,
Blessed are all they that wait for him, Esaias 30.18.
Esaias 8.17. and to stir up our selves to lay hold on our GOD, Esaias 64.7. that
is an excellent place, Esaias 50.10.

CHAP. VI. SPIRITVALL PROMISES. 1. In regard of Good. 1. GODS 1. Love of them,
which has three properties, it is 1. Free. 2. Infinite. 3. Eternal.
2. Presence with them: 1. Each of the godly in particular. 2. The whole Church
in general.
3. Providence over them, keeping them 1. Immediately, by himself. 2. Mediatly,
by his Angels.



1. Promises of GODS Love.
For spiritual blessings in General, Ephesians. 13. he has blessed us with all
spiritual blessings, 2 Pet. 1.4. He has given us all thngs pertaining to life
and godliness.
ANd he will love thee, and bless thee, etc. Deuteronomy. 7.13. He crowns his
people with loving kindness, and tender mercies, Psalm. 103.4.

There are three properties of GODS Love.

1. It is a free Love; he stands not upon desert, Hosea 14.4. Exodus 33.19. 1
Ioh. 4.10, 19. The LORD did not set his Love upon you, nor choose you, because
ye wore more in number then any other people, but because the LORD loved you.
Lo he loved you, because he loved you, Deuteronomy 7.7, 8. Amat, quia amai. Bernard.
to show the freedom and independancy of his love unto them.

2. It is an infinite and transcendent Love, Ephesians. 2.4.7, 18, 19. GOD There is a
Sic without a Sicut.
so loved the world, etc. John 3.16. that is, so infinitely, so transcendently,
so incomprehensibly, 1 Ioh. 3.1.

Ier. 32.40. 2 Samuel 7.15.
3. It is an eternal and unchangeable Love, I have loved thee with an
everlasting love, Jer. 31.3. Behold I will betroth thee unto me for ever,
Hosea 2.19. With everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, Esaias 54.8.

2. Promises of GODS special and gracious presence.
This is the most sweet comfort, wherewith GOD anciently used to sustain his
children.

Each in particular.

Isaac, Genesis 26.3, 24. Moses, Jacob, Genesis 28.15. and 3^.3. I will be with thee,
that is, to do thee good, Gen 32.12
Exodus 3.12. and 4.12. Josh. 1.5, 9. and 3.7. Ezekiel. 3. Jer. 1.8, 19. David
encouraged his son Solomon with this, 1 Chronicles. 28.20. And the whole Church in
general. Zach. 2.10, 11.

Joel 2.17. Christ is spiritually present with all true believers.

Romans 16.24 2 Cor 13.14 Phil. 4.23.


Esaias 41.10. and 43.2. Rev. 1.13. and 2.1. CHRIST left this comfort for his
farewell to his Disciples and their Successors. Lo I am with you to the end of
the world, Matthew. 28.20. And [With you] Comprehends under it not only Pastors,
but people also; For where two or three are gathered together in my name (says
CHRIST) there am I in the midst of them, Mat. 18.20.

3. Promises of GODS providence over his children.
They have an honorable guard.

1. GOD himself keeps his Israel who neither slumbreth nor sleeps. Psalm.
121.4, 5. He keeps his under the shadow of his wings, Psalm. 91.14. The LORD
compares himself to an Eagle which safely carries her young, Deuteronomy. 1.31. and
32.11. and to a careful Shepherd, Ezekiel. 34.12. Psalm. 23.1, 2, 3. John 16.12.
Esaias 30.21. ^ Chron. 16.9 Psalm. 13.18 19 Deuteronomy. 11.1^.

There are two sweet Psalms for promises of future protection, Psalm. 91. and
121.




The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, Psalm. 34.15. a man's eye is upon
one that he loves, ubi amor, ibi oculus. The LORD has a care of them, he
loves, defends and protects them. He says, Psalm. 32.8. I will guide thee with
mine eye. He will guide his children by his special providence in all their
ways, Psalm. 121.8. Esaias 46 4. He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous,
but with Kings are they on the throne, yea he does establish them for ever,
and they are exalted, Job 36.7. He keeps all his bones, not one of them is
broken, Psalm. 34.20.

There shall not a hair of your head perish, All the hairs of your head are
numbered Luke 12.7. and it is Austens inference thereupon, Si fic custodiuntur
su perstua tua, in quanta securitate est animatua. The eye is kept most
diligently, and strongly guarded by nature with tunicle;
Luke 21 18. Matthew. 10.30. Acts 27.34. He that touches you touches the apple
of his eye, Zach. 2.8. To express the tenderness of his love, he named the
tenderest part of the body, says Salvian, that he might show that he is
troubled with the least contamelie offered to his Saints, as we are with the
least hurt of our eye. Nay he says not, he that touches you touches his
eye, but the apple of his eye, the tenderest piece of the tenderest part, the
Crystal humor as the Philosophers call it, Psalm. 17 8. Deuteronomy. 32.10
Ishon in Hebrew of Ish, pupilla in Latin of pupa, because therein appears
the resemblance of a little man, or because as a man is to be prized above all
other creatures, so GOD esteems his people above all the world. David found
by his own experience, Psalm. 17.8. Psalm. 63.7. and 41.12. that GOD preserved
him as the apple of his eye: and so may all Christians. What was said to Jacob,
Genesis 28.15. and to Joshua by Moses, Deuteronomy. 31.8. and by GOD himself, Josh. 1.5.
Paul applies generally to all Christians, Heb. 13.5. I will never leave thee
nor forsake thee. He guides them in all their ways. He that has mercy on
them (says the Prophet) shall lead them, even by the springs The world is
like a wilderness, the wicked like wild beast, in a de^art; Gods children are
so provided for, that God preserve^ them, yea and himself s^^ds them out
means of singular refreshing all their days.
of water shall he guide them, Esaias 49.16.

2. Christians have the guard of Angels.

He shall give his Angels charge ov^r thee, to keep thee in all thy ways,
they shall bear thee up in their hands least thou dash thy foot against a
stone. Psalm. 91.11, 12. The Angels keep us, and that universally, in all our
ways: they keep us, and that very charily and tenderly, they bear us in
their hands, and they keep us very safely and surely, so that we dash not our
feet against a stone.

The Angel of the LORD encampeth about them that fear him, and delivers
them, Exodus 33 2. and 32.34.
Psalm. 34.7.

CHAP. VII. 2. CHRIST himself, and many blessings by him are promised to the
Godly, 1. Redemption. 2. Vocation. 3. Justification, which has two parts, 1.
Not imputing sin. 2 Imputing righteousness
4. Reconciliation 5. Adoption.


The world it self was no sooner begun, but the promise also began of sending
Christ into the world, Gen 3.15 Yet this promise was in general terms,
neither showing what seed, neither showing what kind of woman, or of what
people this seed should be. A second promise was made to Abraham, and it was a
little more lightsome then this, for it showed of what people he should be, viz
of the Jews, Gen 22.8. A third promise was more lightsome then this too, for
it shows of what Tribe he should be, viz of the Tribe of Judah, Genesis 49 ^0. A
fourth promise was yet more lightsome, for it showed of what family He should
be, viz of the family of David, 2 Samuel 7 16 The fifth, and six, and seventh
promises were much more lightsome then this, for the fifth declared the party
that should bring him into the world, viz a Virgin, Esaias 7 17 The sixth the
place he should be borne in, viz. Bethlehem, a City of Judah, Micah 5.2 These
youth declared the time, viz. seventy weeks of years from the time the
Prophet Daniel lived in, that is, four hundred four score and ten years,
Dan. 9 24. Days first Sermon of our Saviors Nativity.
1. CHRIST is promised to the godly.
THe first promise made to man and the foundation of all other was that, Genesis
3.15. It shall bruise thy head, It or He, that is, CHRIST, shall bruise thy
head, that is, break the power and dominion of Satan. The first Promise was
made concerning CHRIST, because GOD intended to make good every promise in
CHRIST.

In all ages the LORD renewed this promise of sending CHRIST the promised seed,
as immediately after the flood, Noah by prophecy blessing his two sons,
said, GOD shall enlarge Iaphet, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem, Genesis
9.27. He means that we the Gentiles should be called to be one body with the
Jews in CHRIST. The same was afterward often renewed to Abraham: In thy Seed
(that is, CHRIST) thou thy self, and all the nations of the earth (that is,
the faithful in all nations) shall be blessed, Genesis 12.3. Genesis 13.14. and
15.4, 18. Genesis 17.4. and 22.

The like was after promised to Isaac, Genesis 26.4. and Jacob, Genesis 28.14. and
Genesis 49.10. it is said, The Scepter shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh
come, Shilo secundae eius, id in que involvitur partus in utero existe^s,
Metonymia rei continent^s pro recontenta, ut inquit ^remel. See Cartwright his
confutation of the Rhemish Testament, on Mat. 1.23 and Perkins on the Creed.
that is, the Messiah come, for Shiloh signifies the tunicle or skin that
lappeth the Infant in the Mothers womb; called by Physicians the secundine,
(because it grieves the woman that is with child the second time, as it were a
second birth) in French arriere fais, in English the afterbirth or
after-burden: and by a kind of figure is put for the Son of GOD in the womb
of the Virgin, made man; to note him to be of the flesh of Mary, and his birth
to be like the birth of other children, sin only excepted. There shall come
a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, Numb. 24.17.

In all succeeding ages, Moses and all the Prophets in their times foretold of
CHRIST, Rom 1.2.
Acts 3.24. and 10.43. The LORD thy GOD will raise up unto thee a Prophet from
the midst of thee, of thy brethren like unto me, unto him shall ye hearken,
Christ was promised to come of the seed of David, Acts 1^.23. See Psalm
8^.35.36 and 131, 11, 12, 13 14 Esaias 16.5.
Deuteronomy. 18.15. like unto mee] both in the participation of nature and office,
says Iunius: a true man, and a true Mediator, CHRIST is there meant, Acts
3.22. and 7.37. That evangelicall Prophet Esaias spoke of him then as already
come. For unto us a child That is, Jesus Christ, of whom he prophesied, Chap.
7 14 Behold a Virgin shall conceive, and hear a Son, and shall call humane
Immanuel.
is borne, unto us a Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his
shoulder, and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty GOD,
the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, Esaias 9.6. See Esaias 11.1.32.1, 2.
and 53.2, 3, 4. Ezekiel 37.24. and 34.24. Ier. 33.15, 16. Ier. 23.5, 6. Micah 5.2.
Zach. 3.8. and 6.12, 13. and 9.9, 10. He is called the messenger of the
Covenant, Mal. 3.1. For in him GOD reconciled the world to himself, 2 Cor.
5.19.

There are multitudes of promises also concerning CHRIST, Luke 1.32.
and the general benefits by him in the New Testament.

1. That he shall save us: The Evangelist Matthew gives this reason of his name
JESUS, Mat. 1.21. Luke 3.6.
For he shall save his people from their sins, from the guiltiness, power,
and punishment of them. The Son of man is come to seek and save that which
was lost, Luke 19.10. GOD sent his Son into the world, that the world through
him might be saved, Ioh. 12.4^.
John 3.17. The Apostle with a vehement asseveration affirms this. This is a
faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that CHRIST JESUS came into
the world to save sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15. Hence CHRIST is often called our
Savior, Esaias 49.26. Esaias 60.16. Luke 2.11. 1 Timothy 1.1. 1 Timothy 2.3.

Esaias 49 6. 1 Ioh. 19.
2. CHRIST is said to be A light to the Gentiles, Matthew. 4.16. The light of the
world, John 8.13. and 9.5. under this comparison of Light, all benefits which
CHRIST brings us are contained, light of knowledge, grace, and glory.

Hitherto belong all such Scriptures as show CHRIST to be our Life, 2 Timothy 1.10
Col. 3.4. John 6.33. Ioh. 14.6. CHRIST also calls himself The bread of life,
Ioh. 6.35, 51. He is said to be the Head of the body.
Compares himself to a Vine, John 15.1. to teach, that as the branch has his
whole life from the stock, so we have all our life from him.

3. GOD is well pleased in CHRIST, Mat. 3.17. In whom, not with, by, or through
whom, but a larger preposition then them all, which signifies two things: 1.
That GOD is well pleased with CHRIST: 2. In and through him with others;
therefore it is said, Ephesians. 1.3. GOD has blessed us, Romans 8.32.
with all spiritual blessings in CHRIST, verse 4. GOD has chosen us in him,
ver. 6. accepted us in the beloved, ver. 7. Ephesians. 3.25.
In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of his grace. It is said, Acts 13.34. I will give you
the sure mercies of David, that is, all those good things which were promised
in CHRIST, who was of the seed of David.

2. Blessings by CHRIST to the Godly.
1. Redemption.
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit.
2.14. We have redemption through his blood. Col. 1.14
Ephesians. 1.7. And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquity, Psalm. 130.8.
He has redeemed them from the curse of the law, by being made a curse for
them, Gal. 3.13. CHRIST JESUS by his own blood entered into the holy place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us, Heb. 9.12.

CHRIST is made unto us Redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30.

2. Effectual Calling; our particular calling does interest us in the promises
of GOD, Acts 2.39. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, Rom 8
28.30.
and to all that are a far of, even to as many as the LORD our GOD shall
call, there is the condition.

3. Justification.
By his knowledge, shall my righteous servant justify many, Esaias 53.11.

By him all that believe, are justified, Acts 13.39.

In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, Esaias 45.25. Who shall
lay any thing to the charge of GODS Elect? it is GOD that justifies, Romans 8.33.

He justifies the ungodly, Romans 4.5. that is, says Beza, he makes him
righteous in CHRIST, who is unrighteous in himself.

1. Justification consists of two parts, 1. Not imputing sin, 2 Cor. 5.19. 2.
Imputing righteousness, Gal. 3.6.

Promises of forgiveness of sins.
This great benefit of forgiveness of sin by CHRIST, is plentifully
proclaimed unto us miserable sinners.

See Luke 14 47. Act 5.31.10.43. and 13.38.
Behold the Lamb of GOD which takes away the sins of the world, John 1.29.
He shall bear their iniquities, Esaias 53.11. Once in the end of the world has
he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, Heb. 9.26. He was
manifested to take away our sins, 1 John 3.5. The blood of JESUS CHRIST
cleanses us from all sin, 1 John 1.7. He has by himself purged our sins,
Heb. 1.3. He bare our sins on the tree, 1 Pet. 2.24. He loved us and washed
us from our sins in his own blood, Rev. 1.5. He is the propitiation for our
sins, 1 John 2.2.

Hereunto agrees that invitation of our Savior: Come unto me all ye, He
came to call sinners, Luke 5 21.
that are weary and heavy laden, and I will ease you, Mat. 11.28.

GOD of his rich grace and mercy in JESUS CHRIST does make offer of free and
full forgiveness of sins, to every burdened, thirsty, and penitent soul.

Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let
him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our GOD,
for he will abundantly pardon, Esaias 55.7. Return thou backesliding Israel,
says the LORD, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you, for I am
merciful, says the LORD, and I will not keep mine anger for ever, Jer. 3.22.
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against
me, and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned, and
whereby they have transgressed against me, Jer. 33.8.

GOD when he forgiveth us, so fully acquitteth us of our sins, as if we had
committed no sin at all.

This appears by many Metaphors used in the Scripture.

I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions, says the LORD, Esaias 43.25. It
is a Metaphore taken from Creditors, who when they purpose never to exact a
debt, will blot it out of their books: Col. 2.14.
I have put away thy transgressions as a cloud, and thy sins as a mist, says
the same LORD, Esaias 44.22. The clouds which are driven away by the winds
appear no more, nor the mist which is dried up by the Sun; so the sins
which GOD forgiveth, return not again: thou have cast all my sins behind thy
back, says Hezekiah to GOD, Esaias 38.17. that which a man would not look on or
regard, that he casts behind his back.

Thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the Sea, Micah. 7.19. As if
he should say, look as God subdued Pharaoh and all his host in the bottom
of the Sea; so he will cast and put away the sins of his people. Psalm. 85.2.
says Micah to the LORD. When a man would have a thing utterly forgotten, he
will cast it into the bottom of the Sea, from whence there is no fetching it
again.

The Psalmist pronounces him blessed, whose sin is covered, Psalm. 32.1. A
thing covered is not seen, he has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, nor seen
perverseness in Israel, Numb. 23.21.

The same Psalmist pronounces him blessed, to whom the LORD imputes not
sin, Rom 4.7, 8.
Psalm. 32.2. a sin not imputed, is as not committed: as Merchants when they
will forgive a debt, put it not into the reckoning, and so do not impute it.

GOD himself says, I will forgive their iniquities, Heb. 8, 12. and 10.17.
and I will remember That which the Heathen Orator spoke flatteringly of Iuliu^
Caesar, is most true of God, nihil obli^iset so let, nisi iniurias, He forgets
nothing but the sins of penitent suppliants.
their sin no more, Ier. 31.34. the latter clause expounds the former; to
forgive is to remember no more, that is, never to call that to account, which
was once remitted.

Thus GOD blotteth out our sins, that they condemn us not. Puts them
away, that they hurt us not. Casts them behind his back, as though he
regarded them not. And into the Sea, that they drown us not. Covers them, that
they appear not. Does not impute them, as though they were not. Forgets
them, so that he punishes them not.

All the blessings in the new Covenant are given with remission of sins. When
GOD forgives a man's sins, then he gives him all other things,
Sanctification, and whatsoever else, as we see at large. Ezekiel. 36.26. The LORD
there, after he had promised to forgive all their sins, he says, he will
give them a new heart, he will cause them to walk in his ways; and then he
comes with outward mercies too, he promises them deliverance from their
enemies, and other good things in the rest of the Chapter, but all other things
come in with remission of sins, Acts 10.43. To him give all the Prophets
witness, that through his name, we have remission of sins. The Prophets gave
witness concerning CHRIST of many other things besides remiss^on of sins, that
we have in his name, which we have by him, but all other things come with
this. GOD was in CHRIST reconciling the world to himself, 2 Cor. 5.19. a
mavelous great mercy, it consists in this, that their sins were not
imputed. The privileges of the new Covenant are chained together: Whom he
has predestined, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he
justified, and whom he justified, them also he glorified, Romans 8.30.

2. Promises to make us righteous.
As by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of
one, shall many be made righteous, Romans 5.19. therefore we are said, to be the
righteousness of GOD in him, 2 Cor. 5.21. For this cause CHRIST is called The
LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, Ier. 23.6. and 33.16. CHRIST is made unto us
righteousness, 1 Cor. 1.30. He is said to be the end of the law for
righteousness, to every one that believes, Romans 10.4. and the Sacraments are
said to be the Seals of the righteousness of faith. Romans 4.11.

Esaias 61.10. Zach. 3.3, 4,
He has covered me with a robe of righteousness, Abraham believed GOD, and it
was imputed to him for righteousness, Gal. 3.6.

This imputed righteousness the Papists scoff at, Romans 4.3, 5, 6 8, 9, 10,
11, 22, 23, 24.
and call it a putative righteousness; and yet the phrase is used ten times
in one Chapter.

4. Reconciliation.
By CHRIST we are reconciled to GOD.

GOD has reconciled us to himself by JESUS CHRIST. GOD was in CHRIST,
reconciling the That is, all believers thorough the whole world.
world unto himself, 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. CHRIST is our peace, who has made both
one, that he might reconcile both unto GOD, Ephesians. 2.14, 16. See Romans 5.1.10.
You that were sometime alienated, yet now has he reconciled, Col. 1.21.

5. Adoption. Promises 1. of it.
Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, For ye are all
the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus Gal. 1 20. Ephesians. 1.^.
that we should be called the sons of GOD, 1 John 3.1, 2. But to as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of GOD, even to them
that believe in his name, John 1.12. That is a gracious promise which the
Apostle cites out of the Prophet Hosea, Romans 9.26. And it shall be in the
place, where it was said unto them, ye are not my people, that there they
shall be called the children of the living GOD. So the LORD promises to such
as shall separate themselves from the wicked, 2 Cor. 6.18. He that overcommeth
shall inherit all things, and I will be his GOD, and he shall be my son,
Rev. 21.7. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of
GOD, Mat. 5.9.

It was GODS promise to David concerning Solomon, 2 Samuel 7.14. I will be his
father, and he shall be my son. Whereupon David much affected and ravished,
says, verse 18. O LORD GOD, what am I, or my fathers house, that thou should
vouchsafe me so great honor and happiness, as to find my child, yea to take
him for thine own, and to become his Father?

See that excellent place, Gal. 4.4, 5, 6, 7. and Romans 8.17.

2. To it, paternity promises all blessings, Mat. 7.11. and all forbearance,
Psalm. 103.13. Heb. 12.5, 6.

CHAP. VIII. PROMISES
1. Of the Spirit.
THe giving of the Spirit is a part of GODS Covenant, Whereas God did in the
old time reveal his will unto some by vision^, and dream; now all sorts of
men, young and old, men and maids shall be instructed in the knowledge of God
more plentifully and perfectly.
I will power out my Spirit upon all flesh in those days, and your young men
shall see visions, etc. Joel 2.28, 29. which is repeated, Acts 2.17, 18. The
great Promise that our Savior CHRIST made to them, before he departed in the
flesh, was this, I will baptize you with the HOLY GHOST; which was fulfilled
after when he powered forth his Spirit. So Esaias 44.3. I will power water upon
him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground, I will power my spirit
upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy offspring, the latter end of the verse
interprets it. So Ezekiel. 36.25, 26, 27. I will put my spirit within you, etc. I
will power upon the house of David the spirit of grace and supplications, Zach.
12.10. How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Spirit to them that
ask him, Luke 11.13. I will power out my spirit unto you, Prove. 1.23. This is
meant in that place, Ioh. 4.10. Where our Savior says to the woman of
Samaria, thou would have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
water: that is, the Spirit, as appears by comparing it with John 7.38, 39. I
will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may
abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, John 14.16, 17. It is said,
Ephesians. 1.13. They were sealed with the Spirit of promise, that is, which was
promised to all Believers, and Gal. 3.14. we are said, by faith to receive the
promise of the Spirit, that is, the Spirit of promise, or that had been
promised.

CHRIST had the Spirit in the fulness of it, The Spirit of the Lord shall
rest upon him, Esaias 11 2. I will put my Spirit upon him. Esaias 42.1.
It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell, Col. 1.19. all
fulness both in respect of the number of graces, Esaias 11.2. and in respect of
the measure of them, John 3.34. Col. 2.3. Of his fulness we shall all
receive, and grace for grace, Ioh. 1.16. grace freely, and grace upon grace,
Zach. 14.8.

A Promise to those that have the Spirit.
As many as are led by the Spirit of GOD, they are the sons of GOD, Romans 8.14.

CHAP. IX. The operation of the Spirit. 1. In General. Sanctification.
2. In Special. 1. Spiritual graces. 2. Spiritual duties. 1. The kinds of
them. 2. The degrees of them.



1. The Promises of Sanctification.
Ier 31.33. and 32.4. which is twice repeat^d in the Epistle to the Heb 8.10.
and 10.16. Ezekiel. 11.19, 20. which is repeated, Ezekiel. 35.27. and 37.24.
OD promises in the Covenant of grace which he has made with his people, to
take away their hearts of stone, and give them hearts of flesh: to put his law
in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, to put his fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from him, and to give them a new heart, and
to put his Spirit within them.

The substance of which Covenant is this, that all their sins shall be
forgiven, and both the guilt and punishment thereof wholly remooved. Their
persons shall be justified, and their natures sanctified; the laws of GOD and
his promises shall be written in their minds, so that they shall have the
knowledge of them; and in their hearts, so that they shall have the comfort,
feeling and fruition of them: they shall not only have interest in all GODS
graces and blessings, but according to their need, shall have the use and
enjoyment thereof.

The LORD often promises to Sanctify and make holy his people, Ezekiel. 37.28
Deuteronomy 28.9.
as Exodus 19.6. and 31.13. Levit. 22.32. Esaias 4.3, 4, 35.8. Joel 3.17.

Sanctify them through thy truth, John 17.17. and ver. 19. For their sakes I
sanctify my self, Ephesians. 5.25, 26.
that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

The LORD has sworn that his children shall serve him in holiness and
righteousness all the days of their life, Luke 1.73, 74, 75. The GOD of peace
sanctify you wholly. Faithful is he that has called you, who also will do
it, 1 Thessalonians. 5.23, 24. CHRIST is made unto us Sanctification, 1 Cor. 1.30. The
LORD has said, God will enable his children to live a holy life.
that his children shall not want any needful Grace, for the leading of a
godly life, Psalm. 84.11. 1 Ioh. 3.3.
There shall be a fountain opened for sin, and for uncleanenesse, Zach.
13.1. it is GODS Covenant to sprinkle clean water upon us, that we may be
clean, and to cleanse us from all our filthiness, and all our Idols, Ezekiel.
36.25. I will turn to the people a pure language, Zeph. 3.9. See ver. 13. The
mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of judgment.
The Law of GOD is in his heart, Psalm. 37.30, 31. CHRIST gave himself for us
that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works: Tit. 2.14.
the LORD will guide the meek in judgment, and teach the humble his way,
Psalm. 25.8. and 12.

In the days of the Gospel (says the Prophet Zachary) shall there be upon
the bells of the horses, Zach. 14. The meanest shall have holiness written upon
his forehead as the Priests had under the Law, or they shall be holy in their
iourneys, in eating and drinking.
HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD.

Those Promises before quoted in the Chapter of Justification, Mat. 1.21. Ioh.
1.29. 1 John 2.2. 1 Ioh. 1.7. Rev. 1.5. may be referred to this head also, for
they are to be understood not only of pardoning our sins, but, delivering us
from the power of them.

Promises. 2. To Sanctification.
In keeping of them there is great reward, The rewards of Sanctification.

The promise of walking in white hereafter is made to none but such as walk in
white here, Rev. 3 4.

There are promises to holiness, 1. Of Gods presence. 2. Of his acceptance. 3.
Of his father-hood, 2 Cor 6.16, 17, 18.


Psalm. 19.11. Blessed and, happy is he that has part in the first
resurrection, on such the second death has no power, Rev. 20.6. Depart from
evil and do good, and dwell for evermore, Psalm. 37.27. To give you an
inheritance among all them which are sanctified, Act. 20.32. See the like Act.
26.18.

See Romans 8.1, 13. 1 John 1.7. Esaias 1.16, 17, 18.

CHAP. X Promises of Spiritual Graces. 1. The kinds of them. 1. Knowledge and
wisdom. 2. Faith. 3. Confidence. 4. Hope. 5. Joy. 6. Love, of 1. GOD. 2.

There are promises of all kind of graces; not a grace, but there is a promise
of it generally, or specially
Spiritual Graces promised. 1. Knowledge, and Wisdom. Promises. 1. Of
Knowledge.
IT is part of the Covenant, Heb. 8.11. You shall know me from the least to the
greatest, Ier. 24.7. and 31.34. ^os. 2 20.
and I will teach you, and you shall no more teach one another his neighbor,
you shall have my law written in your hearts. The Prophet speaking of the days
of CHRIST, says. The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the
waters cover the sea, Esaias 11.9. the like we have, Hab. 2.14.

2 Cor 3.16.18.
In the time of the Old Testament, there was a veil that covered their hearts
and their eyes, that they were not able to see the truth clearly, but now That
veil is taken away and we see the truth with open face, as we see an image
in a glass. Ioh. 1.17, Mat. 1.16. 1 Ioh 5.10. Ephesians 3.5
We know much more then they in the Old Testament, and in another manner, more
distinctly, more particularly. It is often said, that The LORD will teach his
people. As in that famous prophecy of the days of the Gospel, that GOD would
teach them his ways, and they would walk in his paths, Esaias 2.3. Micah 4.2.
So Psalm. 25.8, 9. He will teach sinners in the way, and the meek he will
teach his way. The Elect shall be all taught of GOD, Esaias 54.13.
John 6.45. so much as is necessary for their salvation, Ier. 31.34.
yea The least as well as the greatest.

They shall know of the Scripture to be GODS Word, Esaias 52.6. They shall know
in that day that I am he, that does speak, behold it is I.

They shall know of that doctrine which is taught them, whether it be of GOD,
or whether their teacher speak of himself, John 7.17. CHRIST'S Sheep know his
voice, and will follow him, John 10.4. Pro 3.32. His secret is with the
righteous.
The secret of the LORD is revealed to them that fear him, and he will show
them his Covenant, Psalm. 25.14. See ver 12. When the Spirit of truth is come,
he will guide you into all truth, John 16.13. The faithful have an unction
from the holy one, and know all things. 1 John 2.20. and ver. 27. The HOLY
GHOST abides in them, and they need not that any man teach them.

See Pro. 1.23. Hos. 14.9. Psalm. 107.43. John 8.32. Psalm. 32.8. Mark 4.11.
Esaias 30.21. Prove. 2.3, 4, 5, 6. Prove. 3.6. and 14.6.

Promises. 2. To Knowledge and wisdom.
The profit of knowledge.

Pro. 3 15 to 19 21. to 25. and 24.14.


It is rewarded 1. with Temporal blessings, GOD will exalt such as know him. I
will set him on high, because he has known my name, Psalm. 91.14. Length of
days is in her right hand, Dan. 11.3^. and 11.3. The wise shall inherit glory,
Pro. 3.35. See P^o. 4.5. to 10.
and in her left hand riches and honor, Prove. 3.14.

2. With spiritual blessings, as grace Ioh 17 3. By life eternal is
understood grace, by a metonymie of the effect, quia vitam efficit, it works
life. Piscat quia radix and or^go vitae Cyril Quia gustus est vitae aeternae.
Brentius. Esaias 53.11. M. Perkins on the Creed.

Faith is the gift of God, whereby we know, apprehend and apply the promises
relying upon them Pa^. on the Romans


and peace. 2 Pet. 1.2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the
knowledge of GOD.

3. With eternal blessings, Prove. 3.13, 18. She is a tree of life to them
that lay hold on her, and happy is every one that retains her.

2. Faith, which is thus defined, Faith is a supernatural gift of GOD in the
mind, apprehending the saving promise with all the promises that depend upon
it, Phil. 1.29. Gal. 3.14.

Promises. 1. Of Faith.
GOD promises to give Faith to whom he means to save. The Apostle says, It
is the gift of GOD, Christ is co^ceived in our soul by faith, as he was
conceived in the Virgins womb by her yealding to the promise. So we closing
with the promise, then faith is wrought, and Christ comes to live in the heart.
Ephesians. 2.8. and Jude 3. That it was once given to the Saints. Heb. 12.2.
CHRIST is said to be the Author and finisher of our Faith. And Romans 12.3. That
GOD has dealt to every man the measure of Faith. All that the Father gives
me, that is, by election; shall come to me, that is, by Faith, John 6.37. See
verse 35.

Promises. 2. To Faith. Many Promises are made to Believers.
1. Belief in GOD brings good success. Believe in the LORD your GOD, so shall
ye be established; believe his Prophets, so shall ye prosper, 2 Chronicles. 20.20.

2. Forgiveness of sins: righteousness and justification are promised to
Believers, Acts 10.43. Romans 10.4. and 4.5. and 5.1. Acts 13.39.

3. We are made the sons of GOD by adoption, when we believe in CHRIST,
Ioh. 1.12. Gal. 3.26, 29.

4. GOD will give his Spirit to them that believe: He that believes in me,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water, Ioh. 7.38.

5. GOD has promised to hear the prayers of such as believe, What things
soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall
have them, Mark. 11.24. Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, if ye believe ye
shall receive it. Matthew. 21.22.

6. Eternal life is promised to Believers, John 3.16. Ioh. 3.18. and 6.35, 11,
25, 16 and 12.^^ 2 Thessalonians. 1.10.
Whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. It is
not only said he shall have eternal life, but already he has it, often in
John, Chap. 3.36. Chap. 5. 24. Chap. 6.47, 54. 1. In regard of right, because
he is instated into it in the Covenant of grace, Mat. 5.3. 2. CHRIST in his
Ascension has taken full possession for us, Ephesians. 2.6. 3. In regard of
initiall fruition in this life, the life of grace is an imperfect life of glory.

Believers are said to be blessed, John 20.29. Acts 16.30, 31. The Evangelicall
promises of grace concerning ou^ reconciliation made by Christ and remission of
sins, are so to be believed of us, that they may bring firm and solid comfort,
but unless I believe in speeciall, that I am reconciled and that my sins are
pardoned, I cannot have this consolation, Ergo, I am to believe this. The Mayor
is manifest, because the end of Evangelicall grace and the Divine promises, is
that we may have firm consolation, Heb. 6.18. B. Dav. on Coloss.
Every man that believes shall be saved, Mar. 16.16. There is the gracious
promise: now the Faithful man assumes the Minor, but I believe, and out of
these two premises, infers this saving Conclusion, therefore I shall be
saved. Bellarmine says, this particular proposition, such or such a man is
truly justified, has eternal life, is not contained in the Word of GOD,
either immediately or by consequence. Some Divines say, that such places as
these, Psalm. 103.3. Romans 10.9. Gal. 2.20. intimate and imply such a particular
proposition immediately, but this is deduced by evident consequence out of the
word, from such general promises and propositions as these: Whosoever
believes in him, shall receive remission of sins, Acts 10.43. And by him all
that believe, are justified from all things, etc. Acts 13.39. He that believes
on the Son, has everlasting life, John 3.36. follow by good consequence
these particulars, Paul, Peter, Calvin, Bradford, or any other particular man
believing in him, receives remission of sins, is justified and has eternal
life; as it follows directly and infallibly, every man is a reasonable
creature, therefore John, Thomas, etc. is endued with reason.

For all Generals comprehend and include their particulars; otherwise how
shall it be proved, that GOD made Hens and Ducks, etc. but by this, that he
made all the world, and gave being to every creature.

One means to get Assurance is a serious meditation on the Promises of GOD,
and an humble and sound application of them to thy self, Heb. 10.22, 23.

When the LORD acquaints us with his Word and Promises, and causes us by his
Spirit to put our trust in them, this is a sound and true Assurance, Job 33.26.

The smallest measure of true grace that can be, is to hunger after grace in
the want thereof, faith a reverend Divine on the fourth of John.
The smallest measure of Faith that can be, is when a man not being able to
apply the promises to himself, and to say, I am persuaded my sins are
forgiven, yet out of a troubled heart does unfainedly desire the favor of GOD
above all the world. Such as unfeinedly desire and ask grace of God, shall be
sure to obtain it.


To this thirsting the Promises are made, Mat. 5.6. Psalm. 107.9. The LORD will
fulfill the desires of them that fear him, Psalm. 145.19.

See Esaias 55.1, 2. Esaias 44.3, 4. Rev. 21.6. and 22.17. John 7.37. Psalm. 10.17.
Luke 1 53.

Promises of Assurance, Psalm. 50.23. that is, I will cause him to see and know
that he shall be saved, Mal. 4.2. Psalm. 85.9. and 97.11. GOD has first
commanded the faithful to make their calling and election sure, 2 Pet. 1.1.
and to believe his promises, Mar. 1.15. 1 John 3.23. Secondly, promised that
he will certify and assure his people of his favor, Ezekiel. 34.30. Thirdly,
GOD has given his people in all ages experience of the truth of this his
promise in themselves, Romans 8.15, 16. Gal. 4.6.

3. Confidence. Promises. 1. Of Confidence.
It is said of GODS people, That they shall stay upon the LORD the holy one of
Israel Esaias 10.20. At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eye
shall have respect to the holy one of Israel, Esaias 17.7. Thou shall call me my
father, and shall not turn away from me, Jer. 3.19. They shall trust in the
name of the LORD, Zeph. 3.12. Many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in
the name of the LORD, Psalm. 40.3. Under his wings shall thou trust, Psalm. 91.4.
He is the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are a
far off upon the Sea, Psalm 65.5. They that know thy name will put their trust
in thee, Psalm. 9.10. In his name shall the Gentiles trust, Mat. 12.21. The
Spouse leaned upon her beloved, Cant. 8.5.
The Isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust, Esaias 51.5.
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him, Psalm. 64.10.

Promises. 2. To Confidence.
1. Safety: Deuteronomy 31.6. Josh 1.9. 1 Chronicles. 28.20. 2 Chronicles 20.15, 17.

Esaias 41.10, 13, 14.

He shall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the
Lord, Psalm. 112.7. Confidence in God does the more bind and oblige him as it
were to do us good.


GOD is a shield to them that put their trust in him, Pro. 30.5. who so puts
his trust in the LORD shall be safe, Pro. 29.25. They that trust in the LORD
shall be as mount Zion which cannot be removed, Psalm. 125.1. Thy life shall be
for a prey unto thee, because thou have put thy trust in me, says the LORD,
Jer. 39.18. None of them that trust in him shall be desolate, Psalm. 34.22. The
LORD shall save them because they trust in him, Psalm. 37.40. The faithful have
promised themselves help, because they trusted in the LORD, Psalm. 57.11. and
143.8, 9. Numb. 14.9. 1 King. 6.16. Psalm. 3.6. and 23.4. and 27.1, 3. Psalm.
46.1, 2. and 49.4. and 46. Psalm. 4.11. and 118.6. Esaias 12.2.

2. Peace; Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee,
because he trusts in thee, Esaias 26.3.

3. Mercy, He that trusts in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about, Psalm.
32.10.

4. Blessedness; Blessed is the man that trusts in thee, Psalm. 84.12. Psalm.
34.8.
Blessed is the man that makes the LORD his trust, Psalm. 40.4. Who so trusts
in the LORD, happy is he, Pro. 16.20.

4. Hope.
Calvin calls Hope an expectation of those things which Faith believes to be
truly promised of GOD. Spes est expectasio eorum quae vere a Deo promissa fides
credidit. Calvin l. 3. Inslit. C. 2. Sect. 42. Rom 8.25. Spet est virtus qua
inclinamur ad expectatione^ eorum, quae Deus nobis promisit.


M. Perkins defines Hope thus Hope (says he) is the grace o^ GOD whereby with
patienc^ we wait the LORDS leisure for the performance of his promises,
especially touching redemption and life eternal.

Hope is an expectation o^ such good things to come (...) GOD has promised,
and Faith believed.

Faith is the foundation of Hope, Hope is the nourishment of Faith. Faith
apprehends the promises of things to come, Hope expects the things
promised. Simeon having a promise, that before he died, he should see CHRIST
with his bodily eyes, believed the same, and looked for the performance of it,
Luke 2.26, 29, 30.

Promises. 1. Of Hope.
David often professes, that GOD was his hope, Psalm. 39 7.33.22. and 119 16^.
and his trust even from his youth, and GOD made him hope even from his mothers
womb, Psalm. 71.5. and 22.9. And that GOD is the hope of all the ends of the
earth, Psalm. 65.5. CHRIST is in you the hope of glory, Col. 1.27.

The righteous has hope in his death, Proverbs 14.32.

Dum spiro, sp^ro, says the Physician.

Dum expiro, spero, says the Divine. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in
him, says Job 13.15.


Promises. 2. To Hope.
The LORD promises, Psalm. 91. both temporal blessings and eternal salvation
to those that hope in him.

They are pronounced Blessed that have true hope, Psalm. 40.4. We are saved by
hope, Romans 8.24.

The hope of the righteous shall be gladness Pro. 10.28.

Hope makes us not ashamed Romans 5.5. Psalm. 25.3.

To Hope in GOD, and to have GOD for our Help, ar^ linked together in
Scripture Happy is he, that has the GO^ of Jacob for his help, whose hop^ is
in the LORD his GOD Psalm. 146.5.

See Heb. 10.35. Lam. 3.24, 2^ 26. Psalm. 14.7, 11.

Hope is preserved by a (...) consideration and full persuasion of GODS
properties, which make us patiently abide for the accomplishment of his
promises: four special properties for this purpose are to be observed.

1. His free grace, 1 Pet. 1.13.
that makes us wait on him, being persuaded in our hearts by faith, that the
same grace which moved GOD to make any gracious promise, will further moove him
to accomplish it.

2. His infinite power, Romans 4.2^.
being persuaded that he is able to do it.

3. His infallible truth: 2 Timothy 2 13
so faithful is GOD, that not a word which he has said, shall fall to the
ground.

4. His unsearchable wisdom: he is most wise in appointing the fittest times
and seasons for all things, so as may most make for his own glory, and his
childrens good.

Let us therefore imitate David, Job, and Simeon, spoken of before, in waiting
for the accomplishment of GODS promises, Romans 4.18. Acts 26 6.
and hoping in him even against hope, as Abraham did: though Sense corrects
imagination, reason corrects sense, but faith corrects both.
sense, reason, and experience should be against us, yet let us cleave to the
Promises, and wait upon GOD, who never fails those that trust in him, 1 Pet.
1.13.

5. Joy. Promises of it.
This is notably set out unto us in the book of Psalms, Psalm. 19.8. The
Statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart. Psalm. 23.4. Thy rod and
thy staff they comfort me. Psalm. 36.8, 9. Thou shall make them drink of the
river of thy pleasures; for with thee is the fountain of life, and in thy
light shall we see light. Psalm. 89.15, 16. Blessed is the people that know the
joyful sound, they shall walk O LORD in the light of thy countenance. In thy
name shall they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be
exalted. Psalm. 45.15. Psalm. 33 21. and 126 5, 6,
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought. Psalm. 64.10. The righteous
shall be glad in the LORD. Psalm. 68.3. Let the righteous be glad, let them
rejoice before GOD, yea let them exceedingly rejoice. Psalm. 97.11, 12. This
duty is often and earnestly enjoined, ^sal. 32.^. Phil. 4. and 3^.
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the LORD ye righteous, Psalm. 118.15. The voice of rejoicing and
salvation, is in the tabernacles of the righteous. Psalm. 132.16. Her Saints
shall shout aloud for joy.

The books of the Prophets are full of these Promises. Notable is that sweet
song of Esaias, Esaias 12.2, 3
GOD is my Salvation, I will trust, and not be afraid; for the LORD JEHOVAH is
my strength and my song, he also is become my salvation. Therefore with joy
shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation or Consolation. The whole
35. Chapter of Esaias is full of heavenly consolation to as Gentiles, verse 1.
Ier. 3^.12, 13 and 2^ 19.41.16.61 3. Hol. 12.9 Zach. 19.
The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them, and the desert
shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. See ver. 10. Esaias 56.7. I will make
them joyful in my house of prayer. In the 66. of Es^y are many sweet
consolations, v^rse 10. to 14. our Savior likewise said to his Disciples, that
their hearts should rejoice, and their joy should no man take away from them,
Joh. 16.22. Paul says, The kingdom of GOD is in righteousness, peace, and
joy in the HOLY GHOST, Romans 14.17. The HOLY GHOST works it in the heart, one
of his fruits is joy, Gal. 5.22.

The LORD makes so many promises of this one thing, to make us see, 1. That
there can be no holding out in a Christian course without this joy: 2. By
reason of the many evils that befall us in this life, it is very hard to get,
much more to keep this joy.

6. Love, of 1. GOD. 2. CHRIST. 3. Our Brethren. 4. Our Enemies.

A Promise. 1. Of the Love of GOD.
And the LORD thy GOD will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed, to
love the LORD thy GOD with all thy heart and with all thy soul, that thou
may live, Deuteronomy. 30.6. As if the LORD had said, I will ingraft the true love
of my self in your hearts, which you will increase in, and constantly proceed
in the same; The upright love thee. Cant. 1 4.
and then I will account and accept of it, for the full measure of love that my
law requires.

Promises. 2. To the Love of GOD.
Many things are promised to those that love GOD.

1. Preservation, The LORD preserves all them that love him, Psalm. 145.20.

2. Plenty, GOD will cause them to inherit substance, and will fill their
treasures, Proverbs 8.21.

3. Deliverance, Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I
deliver him, Psalm. 91.14.

4. Joy, unspeakeable and glorious, 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. That Text is chiefly meant
of the Gospels joy, of the wine and fatlings, revealed to the Believer by the
Spirit.

5. GOD knows them, loves them, will keep his Covenant with them, shows
mercy to them and their posterity, and has promised them a crown of life.

If any man love GOD, the same is known of him, 1 Cor. 8.3. I love them that
love me, Pro. 8.17. He is the faithful GOD which keeps Covenant, and mercy
with them that love him, Deuteronomy. 7.9. Deuteronomy. 7.9.
Which sentence is repeated twice in the very same words, Nehem. 1.5. Dan. 9.4.
He shows mercy to them, and thousands of their generations that love him,
Exodus 20.6. He shall receive the crown of life, which the LORD has promised
to them that love him, James 1.12. and 2.5.

6. All things shall work together for their good, Romans 8.28.

Promises. To the Love of CHRIST.
If any man serve me, him will my Father honor, John 12.26.

He that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will
manifest my self unto him, John 14.21, 23.

Promises to the love of our Brethren.
It is the cognizance of a Disciple, and a sign of spiritual life.

Iam 2 8.
By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another,
John 13.35. He that loves his brother, abides in the light, 1 John 2.10. And
is translated from death to life, 1 John 3.14. If we love one another, GOD
dwells in us, 1 John 4.12.

Pr^mises to forg^v^ of (...).
Promises to the love of our Enemies.
It is a matter of great credit to forgive, for thereby we are declared to be
The children of our heavenly Father, Matthew. 5.44, 45. Love your enemies, and
do good, and your reward shall be great, Luke 6.35. If thine enemy be hungry,
give him bread to eat, and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: For
thou shall heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee,
Pro. 25.21, 22. Thine enemy] that is, he that hates thee, not he whom thou
hate, for thou must hate none: give him bread] that is, Saul was for the time
moll^^^^d, when he saw that David spared his life. 1 Samuel 2^.^6 17.
all things necessary in time of his need, if occasion be offered; for by thy
beneficence thou shall overcome his evil, and provoke him to love; or if not,
GOD will certainly reward thee.

It is also matter of Comfort for us; for if we forgive, so shall we also be
forgiven, If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
forgive you, Matthew. 6.14. the same is Mark 11.25. and Luke 6.37.

7. Fear. Promises, of Fear. GOD promises to make us fear him.
He says in his New Covenant, that he will put his fear into our hearts, as
Ier. 32.39, 40. and that we shall fear him for ever. The LORD does often
repeat this promise, as Deuteronomy 4.10. where one special means whereby this
fear is wrought, is set down. Deuteronomy 6.1, 2. and 17 19.
Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they
may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and
that they may teach their children. So Pro. 2.5. They who seek for wisdom,
shall understand the fear of GOD. David, Psalm. 40.3. shows another means,
whereby GOD does stir up this grace in his people, viz. the beholding of GODS
mercy on others, saying. And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise
unto our GOD: many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. They
shall fear thee as long as the Sun and Moon endure, throughout all
generations, Psalm. 72.5. They shall fear the GOD of Israel, Esaias 29.23. Psalm.
102.15.
They shall fear the LORD, and his goodness in the latter days, Hos. 3.5.

GOD has made promises to free his people from servile fears, Job 11.15.
Psalm. 112.7, 8. Prove. 1.33.

Promises to Fear.
1. Great and everlasting mercy is promised to those that fear GOD.
Illumination of the understanding, Psalm. 11^.^0. Pro 1.7. ^ the amendment of a
wicked life, ^ro 10.27. and 1^.27. and 15.16. Luke ^.^0 Eccles 8.12. Psalm 112 1.


As the heaven is high above the earth: so great is his mercy toward them that
fear him, Psalm. 103.11. The mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to
everlasting, upon them that fear him, verse 17.

O how great is thy goodness, which thou have laid up for them that fear
thee, Psalm. 31.19.

2. Such as fear GOD, are accepted of him, Deuteronomy. 6.24 Esaias 66.2.
Act. 10.35. He takes pleasure in them, Psalm. 147.11. Mal, 3.16, 17. The Sun
of righteousness shall rise up to such. Mal. 4.2. GOD will teach them in the
way that they should choose, Psalm. 25.12, 13, 14. He will fulfill their
desire, Psalm. 145.19.

3. They shall not want, There is no want to them that fear the LORD, Psalm. 34
9 Psalm. 111.5.

4. The Angel of the LORD enc^mpeth round about them, and delivers them,
Psalm 33.17
Psalm. 34.7.

5. Their days shall be prolonged, Pro. 10.27. Pro. 19.23. Pro. 22.4. and they
shall be rewarded, All kind of felicity is promised to it, Psalm 15 12, 13, ^4,
15. Psalm 34 10. Esaias 33 6.
Pro. 13.13.

6. Those that fear the LORD are pronounced blessed.

Blessed is the man that fears GOD, Psalm. 112.1, 2. He will bless them that
fear the LORD, both small and great, Psalm. 115.13. Happy is the man that
fears always, Pro. 28.14. He that fears the LORD is, and shall be every way
blessed, Psalm. 128.1, 4. The reward of eternal life shall be given them, Rev.
11.18.

8. Obedience. Promises. 1. Of Obedience.
GOD will make us able to obey.

GOD does promise in the New Covenant to enable us to walk in his statutes,
and keep his Ordinances and do them, Ezekiel. 11.19, 20. the like is repeated,
Ezekiel. 36.27. and 37.24. And thou shall return and obey the voice of the LORD,
and do all his Commandments which I command thee this day, Deuteronomy. 30.8. The
like promise is, Hos. 14.9. The ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall
walk^ in them. Ier 30.9. Esaias 30.21. and 58.11.


GOD has sworn, that we shall serve him, Luke 1.72, 74.

Promises. 2. To Obedience.
1 Ioh. 2.3. and 3.24.
The Scriptures are full of promises to Obedience.

1 Timothy 4 8.
True and faithful obedience brings all manner of blessings for body and
soul, God said to Adam in Paradise, do this and live. The Lord had Abraham go
out of his country, and promised upon his obedience to bless him. Genesis 12.1,
^, 3. and to be his buckler, and exceeding great reward Genesis 15.1. and 17.1.
and 18.19.
for name and estate, yea, and for seed and posterity also.

All these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shall
hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy GOD, Deuteronomy. 28.1, 2. to 14. 1. All in
general, all these blessings shall overtake thee. 2. Every one in particular,
as is showed in the verses following.

Particular promises made to Obedience.

1. Peace and ^ranqui^lity of mind are promi^ed to obedience.
Holy and Christian security, Levit. 25.18, 19. and 26.3, 5, 6. Pro. 1.33. Job
11.13, 15, 19. 1 Chronicles. 28.7.

2. Psalm. 8.13, 1^. Deuteronomy. 10.13 and 1.36.

Long life in man^ of those place^ is promised ^lso to obedience. Deuteronomy. 30.20.
Pro. 3.1, 1, 2^ 21.


Sufficiency of outward things, nay plenty, Deuteronomy. 28. Levit. 25.18, 19, 21.
and 26.3, 4, 5, 10. GODS blessing on the creatures, Exodus 23.25.

3. Prosperity and a blessing also on their seed, Job 36.11. Esaias 48.17. Deuteronomy.
6.17, 18, 24. This is often iterated almost in every Chapter in Deuteronomie,
and in diverse verses of some one: Take heed and do according to all that I
command you, that it may be well with you and with your children for ever,
Deuteronomy. 4.40. Deuteronomy. 5.29, 33. Deuteronomy. 6.2, 3, 18, 24. Deuteronomy. 12.28. GOD will show
mercy unto thousands of them that love him and keep his Commandments, Deuteronomy.
5.10. Exodus 20.6.

4. Freedom from diseases, Exodus 15.26. and deliverance out of trouble, Deuteronomy.
4.30, 31.

5. GODS love, and presence.

If ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant, then ye shall be a
peculiar treasure unto me above all people, Exodus 19.5. And I will set my
Tabernacle amongst you, and I will walk among you, Levit. 26.11, 12.

6. Victory over enemies, Deuteronomy. 6.19. Psalm. 81.13, 14, 16.
Deuteronomy. 11.22, 23. Deuteronomy. 28.7. Levit. 26.7, 8.

7. Audience of their suites, and acceptance of their persons.

1 Ioh 3.22.
If my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done
unto you, John 15.7. Our obedience is an acceptable sacrifice to GOD, offered
up in CHRIST, Pro. 3.1, 4.
Genesis 4.7. Levit. 26.9. Acts 10.35.

8. Perseverance.

If you keep my Commandments, ye shall abide in my love, John 15.10.

9. Blessedness, and eternal salvation. Deuteronomy. 11.17 1 Timothy 4.8.


Blessed are they that keep judgment; and he that does righteousness at all
times, Psalm. 106.3.

See Pro. 8.32. and 29.18. Luke 11.28. John 13.17. Romans 2.10. Psalm. 19.2. Ezekiel.
18.9.
James 1.25. Rev. 22.14.

He became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him, Heb.
5.9.

A promise. 1. To willing obedience.
If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land, Esaias 1.19.

2. Promis^s to general obedience.
Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy Commandments,
Psalm. 119.6.

Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you, John 15.14.

9. Repentance; Promises 1 of it, Acts 5.31.2 to it, Acts 2.31. 2 Cor. 3.16.
Ier. 4.1. Ezekiel. 33.15, 16.

In it are handled 1. Confession of sin. 2. Mourning for it. 3. Killing of it.
4. Turning from it.

1. Confession of sin. To true Confession of sin are promised. Remitting of
it, purging from it, and mercy.
Man takes advantage from the delinquents confession, confess (we s^y) and be
hanged. But with God, that may rather be a proverb, Confess and be saved.
Psalm. 32.5. See Levit. 26 40, 41, 42.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just (see the certainty of
this promise) to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness, See the extent and largeness of this promise, 1 Ioh. 1.9.
Cum homo agnoscit. Deus ignoscit, says Austin. He that confesses and
forsakes his sins shall have mercy, Pro. 28.13.

If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged, 1 Cor. 11.31. Jer.
3.12, 13.

He looks upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which
was right and it profited me not; He will deliver his soul from going down
into the pit, and his life shall see the light, Job 33.27, 28.

2. Mourning for sin. Promises. 1. Of godly sorrow.
GOD promises in the New Covenant, Ezekiel. 36.26 Non carnale sed carneum cor.

Not a fleshly but a fleshly heart.


to take away the stony heart out of their flesh (that is, the stony hardness
which was in their heart before) and to give them a heart of flesh, that is, a
soft and tender heart, to tremble at GODS judgments, believe his promises, and
obey his Commandments.

You shall look on him, whom you have pierced, and you shall mourn for him,
as one mourns for his only Son, and be in bitterness for him, as one that
is in bitterness for his firstborn, Zach. 12.10.

See Ezekiel. 20.43. and 36.31.

If thou complainest of a hard heart, challenge GOD with his promise, and in a
holy reverence and humble boldness, charge him with that Covenant mentioned in
Ezekiel.

Promises to true contrition or humiliation.
Promises. 2. To Godly sorrow.
This sorrow shall not be everlasting, but it shall end in comfort.
1. Comfort.
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted, Mat 5.4. The words
import an exceeding measure of grief, such as is expressed by crying and
weeping; therefore Luke says, Blessed are ye that now weep, Luke 6 21.
Doler p^opter off^nsum Deum per nostra peccata.
Piscator, and others expound it of sorrow for sin. They that so mourn are
already blessed, and shall be comforted. You shall be sorrowful, but your
sorrow shall be turned into joy, John 16.20. See verse 24. Psalm. 126.5.6. They
that sow in tears shall reap in joy. See Ier. 21. The meek shall increase
their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of
Israel, Esaias 29.19.
He that goes forth and weepeth, shall come again with rejoicing bringing
his sheaves with him. GOD has undertaken to comfort them: In the prophecy of
Esaias every where almost we find it promised. The ransomed of the LORD shall
return and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads; they
shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall fly away, Esaias
35.10. They shall have both outward and inward comfo^t, for so some distinguish
between joy and gladness; that ^oy is outward of the body, and gladness
inward of the soul, Psalm. 118.24. arise (says GOD, ^alling on his Church) and
shine, and put on brightness and glory: ^he LORD shall be a light unto ^hee in
darkness. CHRIST was ^ent for this very end, to comfort such as mourn for
their sins. The LORD has sent me to bind up the broken hearted, See Esaias
65 13, ^4. and 60.5, 10, 11, 12.13. Psalm. 10.5. Mat. 11.28 Ier. 31.18, 19 20.
Psalm. 51.17.
to give unto them that mourn in Zion, beauty for ashes, the oil of joy, for
mourning, the garment of praise, for the spirit of heaviness, Esaias 61.1, 3.
Luke 4.18. I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel, Esaias
30.19 Zach. 8.19.
Mat. 15.24. that is, (says M. Perkins) to those which in their own sense and
feeling are lost in themselves. The fruit of the Spirit is joy, Gal. 5.22. The
LORD who is the Father of mercies, and GOD of all consolation, 2 Cor. 1.3, 4, 5.
is called a GOD that Comfort all those that are cast down, 2 Cor. 7.6.
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, says our GOD. Speak ye comfortably to
Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her
iniquity is pardoned, Esaias 40.1, 2. Behold how freely and how fully the LORD
speaks, how he doubles his comforts: Comfort ye, comfort ye, and iterates
his words, speak comfortably, cry unto her: The LORD will comfort Zion and her
mourners, Esaias 57.18. All Sion, the Church of GOD shall be comforted, and all
the friends of the Church, that mourn in her mourning, and that take to heart
her sorrows and desolation, shall be comforted too. GOD shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes, Rev. 7.17. God will make hims^l^e mavelous in their
deliverance, when all other humane helps and comfo^ts fail, Esaias ^3.18, 9,
20, 21.
Thus says the High and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is
holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite
and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart
of the contrite ones, Esaias 57.15. The day of humiliation, when GODS people
afflict their souls before him, is called a day of a^tonement, Levit. 23.27.
For so is GODS promise, In that day there shall be a Fountain opened for
sin, Zach. 13.1. Zach. 13.1.


2. Grace.
The second benefit this sorrow will bring, is, that it will make us capable of
and able to thrive in every saving grace.

Such shall attain to a clear, certain, and sanctified knowledge of the
truth. Such shall get power over their corruptions, Eccles. 7.3. 2 Chronicles. 32.26.

Counterfeit humiliation, has been effectual for the turning away of Gods
judgments. 2 Chronicles. 12.12.


This benefit is pressed as a motive unto godly sorrow. 1 Pet. 5.5, 6. GOD
gives grace to the humble. Humble your selves therefore (says the Apostle)
under the mighty hand of GOD. Iam. 4.6, 7, 9. GOD gives grace to the humble.
Submit your selves therefore to GOD, Be afflicted and mourn and weep.

1. Knowledge, The humble he will teach his way, Psalm. 25.9. 2. Repentance,
Godly sorrow brings repentance to salvation, 2 Cor. 7.10.
3. Special protection, assistance, and mercy in the evil day.
Those that mourn for the sins of other men, have a great promise of
special protection in the days of common calamity. Go through the midst of
the City, 1 King 21.29.
through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men
that sigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst
thereof, Ezekiel. 9.4.

GOD marked them for his own, signo salutari says Iunius, with a saving
mark, such as that, Exodus 12.

Thou will save the afflicted people, Psalm. 18.27 He saves such as be of a
contrite spirit, Psalm. 34.18. When men are cast down, then thou shall say,
there is a lifting up, he shall save the humble person, Job 22.29.

4. Audience in prayer.
The LORD has promised, that the prayers of such shall prevail mightily with
him both for themselves and others. Ambrose said to Monica the mother of
Austin, when with many tea^es, s^e bewailed her ^ons unconversion, Fieri non
potest, ut (...) l^ch^y^arum perea^ It could not be that the Son of so many
tears should perish. Aug. Confess l. 3 c. 13.
It is said of Jacob, Hosea 12.4. He had power over the Angel and prevailed,
he wept, and made supplications unto him. And of Hezekiah, Esaias 38.5. I have
heard thy prayers I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days
fifteen years. LORD thou have heard the desire of the humble, thou will
prepare their heart, thou will cause thine ear to hear, Psalm. 10.17. When the
Prophet had said, Psalm. 34.17. The righteous cry, and the LORD hears them, he
gives this reason, verse 18. The LORD is nigh to them that are of a broken
heart. 2 Chronicles. 7.14. If my people that are called by my name, shall humble
themselves and pray, then will I hear from Heaven.

Yea GOD will hear them also for others. Job 42.8. My servant Job shall pray
for you, for him will I accept.

3. Mortification or killing of sin. Promises. 1. Of Mortification.
A Child of GOD shall be able to mortify his corruptions, and overcome his
special sins which most prevail over him.

For sin shall not have dominion over you, Romans 6 14. that is, shall never
any more reign as in times past it did, and so have the full victory over you.
For ye are not under the Law, but under grace, that is, Ye are not still
under the condemnation and tyranny of the Law; but by true receiving of CHRIST
by faith are now delivered from that bondage, and so brought into the liberty
of GODS children. See ver. 18, 22. and Romans 7.24, 25. He will subdue our
iniquities, Micah 7.19. He will tread them under our feet, as it were.

This grace of Mortification is expressly promised, Gal. 5.16. Walk in the
spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh, Tit. 2.11, 14.

The members of CHRIST shall be cleansed from the guiltiness of sin, it
shall not be imputed; and from the filthiness of sin, it shall not prevail
over them, 1 John 17.9. Mat. 1.21. John 1.29. Rev. 1.5. Acts 3.26. Psalm. 103.3.
The Prophets foretold in their time, That GOD would purge and cleanse his
Church. Esaias 4 3, 4. and 27 9
Esaias 1.25. That GOD will purely purge their dross, and take away all their
tin: that is, their sins. I will cleanse you or wash you, that is, with the
imputation or sprinkling of the blood of CHRIST from all your Idols, that is,
from all the sins that you have committed.

Esaias 11.6.
When we feel our hearts discouraged by the little strength we find to master
our special corruptions, then we may apply to our selves any of these
promises, wherein the LORD himself does undertake this work which is too hard
for us: Nothing cleaves more pertinaciously, or is more inexpugnable then a
strong lust. As God of ten promised his people going to conquer the land of
Canaan, that no enemy should be able to stand against them, Deuteronomy 7 24 and
11.2^^ Josh. 1.5. and ^0 8 so he has as certainly promised to the Elect
victory over their enemies.
That he will subdue our iniquities, cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
Though a strong and importunate lust hang upon us, an hereditary disease, a
lust that is natural to us, which we think we shall never be able to conquer,
yet GOD has promised to break the dominion of every sin; That he will
crucify the flesh with the affections thereof. He can heal the strongest
lusts, CHRIST could cure those that were borne blind and lame; therefore when
we grapple with a strong lust we should go to the LORD, and plead the
Covenant, and say to him, LORD I feel this temptation is too strong for me,
such a lust I cannot overcome, thou have said, Thou will circumcise my heart,
that thou will dissolve these lusts, I beseech thee to do it. If we truly hate
and detest sin, (though it do sometimes stir in us) we should not be
discouraged; for our Sanctification here is but in fieri, it is but in doing
yet, We should do therefore as Iehosaphat did, 2 Chro. 20.11.
Rev. 6.2. CHRIST rides about conquering, and will yet go on to conquer sin
in us. He will not subdue our corrupt lusts unto us at once, but as he did the
Cananites to his people Israel, by little and little, Exodus 23.30. Deuteronomy. 7.22.

That promise which GOD made to Paul in the stirrings and conflicts of his
concupiscence is made unto all of his temper, God has promised to give grace
s^fficient to them that ask it. Ezekiel. 36.25, 26.
my grace is sufficient for thee, 2 Cor. 12.9. There are two things in that
promise; grace to make it, and sufficiency to fulfill it.

The LORD does sometimes descend to particulars, as that, He will cleanse them
from their Idols, and that he will take away the stony heart out of them. But
we may apply the former general promises to our particular occasions, and
they will be as comfortable, as if the LORD had said in particular, he will
kill our pride, our unbeleefe, our hypocrisy.

Promises. 2. To Mortification.
The benefits the LORD will bestow upon us, if in obedience and love to him,
we can be content to cast away our sinful lusts.

He that forsakes any profit, credit or comfort for CHRIST'S sake, shall be
rewarded an hundred fold, Mar. 10.29, 30. Mat. 19.28. He shall receive not ten
in the hundred, but a hundred for ten, If ye mortify the deeds of the flesh
by the Spirit, ye shall live, Romans 8.13. Without it there is no living, it is
a necessary condition required to the attainement of salvation.

4. Turning from sin. Promises. 1. Of Turning from sin.
Then thou shall remember thy ways and be ashamed, Ezekiel. 16.61. Ye shall
remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled, and you
shall loathe your selves in your own sight, for all your evils that ye have
committed. Ezekiel. 20.43. the like is repeated 36.31. Unto you has GOD raised up
his Son JESUS, and sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you
from his iniquities, Acts 3.26. GOD promises to the Gentiles in their
conversion, Then will I change in the people their lip, that it may be pure (
so Iunius reads it) with the which all may call upon the name of the LORD,
Zeph. 3.9, 11.
that is, I will call them to repentance: and then follows a promise of taking
away the stain of sin, In that day shall thou not be ashamed for all thy
works. The remnant of Israel shall stay upon the LORD the holy one of Israel
in truth. E^ay 10.20 21, 22.
The remnant shall return, etc.

Then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was
it better with me then now, Hos. 2.7. They shall return unto me with their
whole heart, Ier. 24 7.

Promises. 2. To turning from sin.
Turning unto GOD by repentance procures his mercies upon us.

1. Temporal, Return unto me, The like is Zach. 1 3. I will turn unto you,
in pard^n of sin, and delivery of them out of the scarcity and dangerous
condition they were in, into a better estate of peace, and plenty and outward
prosperity.
and I will return unto you says the LORD of hosts, Malac. 3.7. See Deuteronomy.
30.1, 2, Nehem. 1.9. Job 22.23, 24, 25 -- 28. Ier. 7.3, 5, 7, 14, 15. and 18.8.

2. Spiritual: the promises of remission to repentance are very frequent in
Scripture. Esaias 1.16, 17, 8

God will hear their prayers that turn unto him.

Job ^2.27. 1 King. 8 48, 49.

2 Chronicles. 7.14.


So the Prophet Esaias promises pardon to the penitent; Wash you, make you
clean, put away the evil of your works from you, that is, repent: and then
follows, Though your sins were as crimson, they shall be made as white as
snow, that is, ye shall be pardoned. If we acknowledge our sins, See Esaias
59.20.

Ier. 4.1. and 3.1.


(that is, if we repent) he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.
Hence repentance and remission of sins are joined together by our Savior,
Job 33 27, 28, 29.

Ezekiel 18.2^, 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, 32. and 33.12, 14, 15, 19


Luke 24.47. Acts 2.38 Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
out when the times of refreshing shall come, Acts 3.19. Let the wicked forsake
his way, and return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy on him, Esaias 55.7.

3. Eternal: O Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou may be
saved, Ier. 4.14.

10. Humility. Promises. To Humility.
The LORD inricheth the humble with all his gifts, both Temporal, Spiritual,
and Eternal.

22.4.

2. GOD promises deliverance to the humble, 2 Chronicles. 12.7. Job 22.29.

3. Honor, Before honor is humility, Pro. 15.33. and 18.12. Job 5.11. Iam.
4.6, 10. Luke 18.14. Matthew. 23, 12. Mat. 18.4.


2. Spiritual graces; Wisdom is with the lowl^, Pro. 11.3.
GOD gives grace unto the humble, Iam. 4.6. 1 Pet. 5.5. Pro. 3.24.

1. Pardon of sin, 2 Chronicles. 7.14. 2. GOD teaches them his ways, Psalm. 25.9.

thereby wise unto their salvation, Pro 11.2. 3. GOD blesses them with his
presence, taking delight to dwell with them, Esaias 57.15.
3. GOD will crown the humble in the life to come with eternal glory. God
has two thrones; one in the highest heavens, the other in the lowest heart
Esaias 6^.2.
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven, Mat.
5.3. Austen and Chrysostom expound it of inward humility.

11. Meekness. Promises. 1. Of Meekness.
The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the
Kid: and the Calfe, and the young Lion, and the falling together, and a little
child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed, their young ones
shall lie down together, etc. Esaias 11.6, 7, 8. whereby is signified, that men
once converted, shall be so changed and altered, that if they were never so
fierce and cruel against the Church, and one against another before, yet they
shall be framed to a peaceable and meek disposition toward all men.

Promises. 2. To Meekness. God has promised to water this grace with secret
joys and easefull refreshings, Esaias 29 19. Mat. 11.29.

1. Protection, The meek are under GODS protection, in a special manner,
Psalm. 76.9.

He will beautify the meek with salvation, Psalm. 149.4. They shall be hid in
the day of the LORDS wrath, Zeph. 2.3. He will rebuke aright for all the meek
of the earth, Esaias 11.4.

5. Blessedness, Mat. 5.5. Blessed are the meek.

12. Patience. Promise. 1. Of it.
Patience is a gift which GOD has promised freely and liberally without

up braideth not, and it shall be given him.

Promises. 2. To it.
The patient abiding of the righteous shall be gladness, Prove. 10.28.

Humble your selves under the mighty hand of GOD, (that is, Rev. 3.10.
bow and buckle under it with meekness and silence) that he may exalt you in
due time, 1 Pet. 5.6.

Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of GOD, Heb.
12.9. Who through faith and patience inherit the promise^, Heb. 6.12.
ye might receive the promise, Heb. 10.36. Behold we count them happy which

glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life, Romans 2.7.

13. Righteousness. Promises To Righteousness.
1. Generally, Psalm. 11.7. Pro. 11.3, 4, 5 6, 18, 19. 2. Particularly, for the
righteous person. 1. Himself. Blessings (indefinitely) are upon the head of

The truth dwells in us and shall be with us for ever, 2 Epist. of John 2.

Promises. 2. To Uprightness.
GOD rewards it with the blessines of this life and that which is to come, he
will give them grace in this life, and glory in the life to come, Psalm. 84.11.
No good thing will be withho^d from them. In this life GOD multiplieth his
favors upon those who s^rve him in sincerity, Psalm. 73.1. Psalm. 125.4. GOD
has promised to be good to them;

1. In their habitations and families, Pro. 14.11.

Pro. 10 29. Pro. 4 2, 11. and 19.1.

Job 8.6, 20. Psalm 61.10.


He that walks uprightly walks surely, Pro. 10.9. 2 Chronicles. 16.9. Psalm.
97.11. Prove. 11.28. GOD performs all his gracious promises upon this
condition only: so he promises unto the Kings of Israel and Judah, 1 King.
2.4. and 9.4.5. that he will confirm their Kingdom unto them and their
posterity after them. If they would walk before him in truth with all their
heart and with all their soul: Psalm. ^7.18. Pro. 2.7, 21. Pro. 11.3, 6.
therefore Hezekiah entreats GOD to perform his promise unto him and his
posterity, grounding his faith on this, seeing he had walked, etc. Esaias 38. 3.
Psalm. 145.18. He will save and deliver them from all perils, and out of the
hands of all their enemies, Psalm. 7.10. Prove. 11.6. which makes them bold and
confident as Lions in pe^illous times, Pro. 28.1.

6. Promotion, Pro. 22.11. He that loves pureness of heart, See Esaias 33.15.
Pro. 10, I^b 17.9, ^0. Psalm ^5 and Psalm 24

Pro 10 20. Pro. 11.20.


for the grace of his lips the King shall be his friend.

7. GOD is delighted with it, 1 Chronicles. 29.17. Pro. 12.22. Psalm. 51.6. Psalm.
11.7. By sincerity and truth we come to be in league with GOD, he smites a
covenant with us, Genesis 17.1, 2.

8. A peaceable end: mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end
of that man is peace, Psalm. 37.37.

Three special blessings are promised them: 1. Such shall never fall away nor
loose GODS favor and grace, Psalm. 36.10. a Prophetical prayer has the nature
of a promise, Psalm. 112.6.2. Such shall have strength given them of GOD to
endure any trial he shall be pleased to bring them unto, 2 Chronicles. 16.9.3.
Such shall be sure to have a comfortable issue and a joyful deliverance ^ut of
all their tentations, Psalm. 37. 37. Psalm. 97.11. Psalm. 126.5.

In the life to come, GOD also crowns the sincere and upright services of the
faithful with joy and happiness. Solomon says, He who walks uprightly
shall be saved, Pro. 28.18. and David affirms that the upright is bl^ssed and
shall dwell in GODS presence, Psalm. 32.2. and 119.1. Psalm. 15.2. our Savior
affirms that he shall be blessed in the vision and fruition of GOD, Mat. 5.8.

15. Peace. Promises. Of Peace of conscience.
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives,
give I unto you, John 14.27. Our Savior 1. Challenges peace to be his own,
having dearly purchased it: 2. His own to give, men may wish the peace of GOD
or CHRIST, but he gives it as his own: 3. He shows that this peace cannot
be elsewhere had; Psalm. 3.^. and 4 8. Romans 5.1.
(not as the world gives) plainly distinguishing his peace from the worlds,
both in the gift and manner of giving.

Ob. O but (may a child of God say) I have many and great afflictions in the
world. Sol. What though, in Christ thou may have peace, Ioh. 16.33.

Ob. O but I cannot see which way I should have peace Sol. He will create peace
Esaias 57.19. Ob. O but the peace we have, neither is, nor here will be perfect.

Sol. Peace shall come, Esaias 57.21. Ob. O but am afraid least my peace with God
break and so hold not.

Sol. The mountains may fall, but Gods Covenant of peace shall not fall, Esaias
54.10.


The peace of GOD which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and
minds through CHRIST JESUS, Phil. 4.7. It is called the Peace of GOD] 1.
Because it has GOD for its Object, it is a peace with GOD. 2. Because GOD by
his Spirit is the Author of it; it is peace from GOD, and therefore said to be
a fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. It is said to pass all understanding]
because 1. The understanding of man cannot sufficiently conceive it 2. Man's
understanding cannon sufficiently esteem or prize (...) according to its
worth, shall kee^ your hearts] keepe] as with guard or strong garrison: the
same greek word is used, 2 Cor. 11.32. your hearts] that is, your will and
affections, and minds] your intellectual faculties, your whole souls shall be
kept in the knowledge and faith of CHRIST JESUS.

As many as walk according to this rule, peace shall be upon them and mercy,
Gal. 6.16. By peace we are to understand outward peace, as prosperity and good
success in all things we go about, and peace with the creatures: but the
peace which is principally meant in this place, is peace of conscience, which
is peace with GOD, and our selves.

16. Zeal.
The care of being Zealous, 1. Has a singular promise of the presence and
communion of GOD in CHRIST, Rev. 3.19, 20.

2. Zeal makes all our services acceptable to GOD, Iam. 5.16. Romans 12.11.

3. It is the way to happiness, Matthew. 11.12.

17. Perseverance. Promises to strengthen our faith as touching Perseverance.
For this mark the first Promise which GOD made, The seed of the woman shall
break the serpents head, Genesis 3.15. there Satan is stinted to the heel of
CHRIST, and that promise made to Abraham, Genesis 17.7. and to David concerning
Solomon, 2 Samuel 7.14, 15. the which promise is applied to all GODS Elect, Psalm.
89.23, 28, 29. GOD has promised to his Elect, That they shall enjoy the work
of their hands, and shall not labor in vain, Esaias 65.22, 23. Not one of them
shall be lacking in the whole flock, Jer. 23.4. He will build them and not
pluck them down, he will plant them and not pull them up, Ier. 24.6.

See Esaias 33.20. Mat. 28.20. Mat. 7.24, 25. Rom 8 35 to the end 1 Ioh. 2 24.
Ioh 6.47. 2 Timothy 4 18. Mat. 24.24.
Deuteronomy. 31.8. 2 Samuel 7.10. Amos 9.15. Psalm. 92.13, 14. Pro. 10.30. and 12.3.
Judge. 5.31. Job 11.15, 17. Esaias 42.3. and 46.4. Esaias 55.3. Ezekiel. 37.26. Heb.
13.5. and 20. Esaias 54.9, 10.

Promises. 2. To Perseverance.
The Promises of reward, are limited and restrained unto those who persevere
unto the end, He that endures unto the end shall be saved, Mar. 13.13.
Matthew. 10.22. which is often repeated, Matthew. 24.13. Mark 13.13. CHRIST
promises a reward to those seven Churches of Asia, but with a proviso of
overcomming. To him that overcommeth will I give to eat of the tree of life
which is in the paradise of GOD, Rev. 3.5, 11 12, 21.
Rev. 2.7. He that overcommeth shall not be hurt of the second death, verse
11. To him that overcommeth will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, He that
overcommeth shall inherit all things. Rev 21.7.
verse 17. To him that overcommeth and keeps my works unto the end, to him
will I give power over the nations, verse 26. See 28. verse.

Holding fast and going on has a crown attending it, Heb. 10.23. Luke 22.28,
29, 30. Be thou faithful unto death, Romans 27. Col. 1.1^. Heb 3 6.
and I will give thee a crown of life, Rev. 2.10.

If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will,
and it shall be done unto you, John 15.7.

See James 1.25. Heb. 3.14. Gal. 6.9.

CHAP. XI. 2. The Degrees of Graces.
Promises. Of growth and increase in Grace.
GOD has promised to give grace abundantly, not only to drop it, but to power
it.

I will power water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground:
I will power my Spirit upon thy seed, etc. Esaias 44.3, 4.

Their soul shall be as a watered garden, Esaias 58.11. and Jer. 31.12.

GOD promises to make his people fruitful; He is compared to a Husbandman,
the Church to an Orchard, the faithful to young plants, whose nature is to
spread, and shoot out their branches and bring forth fruit, John 15.2.

The godly man shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
brings forth fruit in his season, Psalm. 1.3. Jer. 17.8.

The righteous shall flourish like the Palm Tree, ver. 12.

The Palm Tree never, loses his leaf or fruit says Pliny. Quentumun
veveres non v^terascent. ^unius.


Those that be planted in the house of the LORD, shall flourish in the courts
of our GOD. They shall bring forth fruit in old age: they shall be fat and
flourishing, Psalm. 92.13, 14. An old man being once asked if he grew in
goodness, said, yea doubtless, I believe it to be so, for GOD has said it.

The righteous shall flourish as the branch, Pro. 11.28. Ye shall go forth
and grow up as the calves of the stall, Mal. 4.2.

The LORD likewise as a good Shepherd says, He will feed his people, that
they may be fat, that is, abounding in grace, as Psalm. 23. Ezekiel. 34.13, 14, 15.
Psalm. 36.8. Pro. 13.4.

He says, He will give strength to his people, to walk in the ways of the
LORD, Esaias 45.24. Esaias 40.29, 31. Psalm. 29.11. Esaias 26.4, 12. Esaias 41.10. Zach.
10.12. Phil. 4.13.

They go from strength to strength, Psalm. 84.7.

The righteous shall hold on his way, and he that has clean hands shall be
stronger and stronger, Ezekiel. 47.^2
Job 17.9.

But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more
unto the perfect day, Pro. 4.18.

Whosoever has (that is, uses well what he has received) to him shall be
given, and he shall have abundance, Matthew. 13.12. Luke 19.26. Mar. 4 24. The
Apostle proves that the (...) and might (...) and p^a^s^d God (...)

T^ess^lonians, that the^ d^d gr^w. 2 ^hess. ^




Nathaniel believed at the first, yet he is promised that he shall see greater
things.

See Hos 14.5, 6, 7.

Promises to several degrees of true grace or growth in grace. 2 Pet. 1.5, 6,
8, 10, 11.

Growth in grace will procure growth in glory; the more holiness we have here,
The more we proceed in holiness, our salvation is still the nearer to us. Rom
13.11.
the more happiness we shall have hereafter. If we be rich in the work of
the LORD, our labor shall not be in vain in the LORD, 1 Cor. 15.58. He that
sowes liberally, shall reap liberally, we shall receive a full reward, John
Epist. 2.8.

CHAP. XII. 2. Spiritual Duties.
THe LORD has promised to assist us in them by his Spirit, and they being done
by the operation and assistance of the Spirit shall be accepted and rewarded of
the Father.

1. GOD has promised to help us by his Spirit in holy duties.

Therefore we must not only look to the Commandment injoyning duty, but to
the promise showing GODS mercy in helping us.

For GOD in the New Covenant gives what he requires.

In one place the LORD commands, Ezekiel. 18 31
Cast away from you all your transgressions, and make you a new heart, and a
new Spirit. In another place he promises, Ezekiel. 36.25, 26.
I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your
filthiness; A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
within you. So GOD commands them to circumcise the foreskinne of their
hearts, Deuteronomy. 10.16. and after he says, he will circumcise their hearts, etc.
Deuteronomy. 30.6. He commands us to keep his Commandments, Eccles. 12.13. and
promises to cause us to walk in his statutes, Ezekiel. 36, 27. He commands us
to fear Him, Eccles. 12.13. and promises to put his fear into our hearts,
Ier. 32.40. He commands us to have a new soft heart, and promises to make
it so, Ezekiel. 36.26. He commands us to pray and make known our wants to him,
and promises to power upon us the Spirit of grace and Supplication, Zach.
12.10.

GODS promises are the foundation of all our performances; For we by working
do not cause him to fulfill his promises, but he by promising does enable us
to perform our works.

2. GOD promises to accept the services of his children.

All our sacrifices shall be accepted.

The LORD by Moses did often tell his people, God acce^^s ^is in their serv^ces.
that their sacrifices should be accepted, Levit. 1.3, 4. and 22.21. and 23.11.
Exodus 28.36, 38. See Esaias 60.7. Ezekiel. 43.27. and 20.40, 41. Mal. 3, 4.

If thou do well, shall not thou be accepted, Genesis 4.7. Exodus 19 5, 6.
Then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, Psalm. 51.19.
Ye are a holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to GOD
by JESUS CHRIST, 1 Pet. 2.5.

If there be first a willing mind, it is ^c^epted according to that a man
has, and not according to that he has not, 2 Cor. 8.12.

I will make them joyful in mine house of prayer; their burnt offerings, and
their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar, Esaias 56.7.

3. GOD will reward the services of his children. God rewards his children for
the good they do, even in this I for the least tear shed, and wo^d spoken in
a good cause goes not without a re^ard.

Mat. 10.^2. Job 34.11.




To him that sows righteousness, shall be a sure reward, Pro. 11.18.

Every man shall receive his own reward according to his labor, 1 Cor. 3.8.

Whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the LORD,
whether he be bond or free, Ephesians. 6.8.

Behold his reward is with him, Esaias 40.10.

Verily there is a reward for the Righteous, Psalm. 58.11.

I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, Ier. 32.18. Psalm. 111.5. Ps.
105 42. Mal. 3.16.
even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of
his doings, Jer. 17.10.

Let us not be weary of well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we
faint not, Galat. 6.9.

2 Chronicles. 15.7.
He shall reward every man according to his works, Mat. 16.27.

CHAP. XIII. The ordinances of GOD. 1. In general. 2. Particular Duties. 1.
Prayer. 2. Preaching. 3. Reading.


Promises. 1. To the ordinances of GOD generally.
THere is a promise to the use of GODS ordinances. James 4.8. Draw nigh to GOD,
and he will draw nigh to you.

With joy shall ye draw water out of the wels of salvation, Esaias 12.3. We may
apply this promise when we pray, hear, confer or fast, in every duty.

Promises. 2. To particular Duties.
1. Prayer. 1. GOD will give his children hearts to seek him by Prayer.
Zach. 13.9.
He shall call upon me, and I will answer hi^, Psalm. 91.15.

Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will
hearken unto you, Ier. 29.12. He will prepare their hearts, Psalm. 10.17.

For this cause shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
thou may be found, Psalm. 32.6.

See Ier. 31.9. and Hosea 3.5.

2. GOD promises to help us to pray.
His Spirit shall indite our prayers, and help us to draw our petitions.

The Spirit helps our infirmities, and makes intercession for us with
groanings that cannot be uttered, Romans 8.26, 27. Every one should labor for
more Spirit then speech in prayer


I will power upon the house of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Jerusalem
the Spirit of grace and supplications, Zach. 12.10. So soon as the Spirit of
Grace enters into the heart; it makes one plentiful, and abundant in
supplicating and suing unto GOD for grace and mercy.

3. GOD has bound himself by promise to hear his servants, when they call
upon him. Promises of audience in prayer.

See Psalm. 18.3 and 20.6. Ioh 4 10. Job 22 27. and 33.6. Esaias 58 ^. David
pleads this promise, Psalm. 4.1.



The LORD made a promise to Solomon after his prayer, saying, Mine eyes shall
be open and mine ears attentive to the prayer in ^his place, 2 Chronicles. 7.15.

The LORD is rich unto all that call upon him, Romans 10.^2

Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with
thankesgiving, General promises to prayer, that God will hear and answer us,
Esaias 30.19 John 16.23 particular promises; first deliverance from any trouble
and affliction, Ps. 50.15. of strength and patience to bear it, Iam. 1.5.
Secondly, whatsoever spiritual grace we stand in need of, Luke 11.13.
Thirdly, inward joy and peace of conscience, Job 23.26. Ioh. 16.24.
let your request be made known unto GOD. And the peace of GOD which passes
all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through CHRIST JESUS,
Philip. 4.6, 7.

The prayers of the upright are his delight, Pro. 15.8. He hears the prayer
of the righteous, verse 29.

GOD will not only hear our prayers in general, but our voice, Psalm. 5.3.
our very desires, Psalm. 10.17. Pro. 10.24. which are effectual prayers with
GOD. He will not despise our prayers, Psalm. 102.17. He will not reproach us, nor
upbraid us with what is past, or our present frailties, Iam. 1.5. It is
agreeable to his nature and disposition to hear prayers, Psalm. 65.12. The
thing that has encouraged GODS children, and given them heart in prayer, has
been this hope and assurance that they should find audience and respect with
GOD, O thou that hear prayer, or because thou hear prayer, all flesh
shall resort unto thee, Psalm. 65.2.

GOD excepts no man, all shall be heard.

For thou LORD art good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all
them that call upon thee, Ps. 86.5. We are to be familiar^y acquainted with
these promises and meditate on some of them when we go to pray.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him
in truth, Psalm. 145.18. It shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord shall be delivered, Joel 2.32. which is repeated, Acts
2.21. and Romans 10.13. Though our prayers be weak, yet let us remember, that
the promise is made to all. We may see the proof of this in a prayer made in
much infirmity, Psalm. 31.22. GOD is more ready to hear, then we to ask, to
give, then we to receive, 1 Pet. 3.12. His ears are open, as a kind mother or
nurse which uses to be so wakefull, that she will hear the child so soon as
ever it begins to cry, Dan. 10.11. Fear not Daniel, for from the first day,
that thou did set thy heart to understand, and to humble thy self before
GOD, thy words were heard, yea before they call, I will answer, and while they
speak, I will hear, Esaias 65.24. that is, in our purpose of Prayer. This the
faithful have gloried in, Psalm. 4.3.17.6. and 38.15.

GOD has specially bound himself to hear his children in those prayers, that
they make unto him in their afflictions; the time of trouble is the very set
hour of Audience. Exodus 22 23. Psalm 9.9. and 22.24.


The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their
cry, Psalm. 34.15. The righteous cry, and the LORD hears and delivers them
out of all their troubles, verse 17. Which is repeated four times in the 107.
Psalm, 6, 13, 19. and 28. verses.

The LORD says, Psalm. 50.15. Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will
deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me. He will regard the prayer of the
destitute, and not despise their prayer, Psalm. 102.17. to 21. their tears,
s^ghes, and groanings are not hid from him, Psalm. 39.12. He will hear in the
morning, Psalm. 5.3. in the very season, the due time, when we are in trouble.
Yea so as he will in our affliction in a special manner, let us know, that
he is our GOD, and that he will deliver us, Zach. 13.9. The LORD, hears the
prayers of his people, when they think they are cast out of his sight, Psalm.
31.22.

GODS people have found comfort in all their afflictions, by pouring out their
hearts to GOD in prayer, Psalm. 109.3, 4.

In the day of my trouble, I will call upon thee, for thou hear me, Psalm.
86.7. Psalm. 86.6, 7.


The LORD has heard the voice of my weeping, the LORD has heard my
supplication, the Lord will receive my prayer, Psalm. 6.8, 9.

A Noble man in this Kingdom, had a ring given him by the Queen Elizabeth,
with this promise; that if he sent that ring to her at any time when he was in
distress, she would remember him and deliver him. This was a great privilege
from a Prince, and yet that ring though sent, might not be delivered. GOD has
given his children prayer as that ring, and tells them whatsoever distress
they are in, let them but send this up to him, and he will be sure to relieve
them, and when they do send up this, it is sure to be conveyed, wheresoever
they are.

Prayer is profitable to obtain every thing, as is evident by the promise of
CHRIST, John 16.23. Verily, Psalm. 5.24.
verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father i^ my name he
will give it you. Note the certainty of the promise, in CHRIST'S vehement
asseveration; note the generality of it [ whatsoever.] Our Savior often repeated
such promises in those heavenly and last speeches which he uttered to his
Disciples, John 14.13. Ioh. 15.7, 16

See Mar. 11.24. John 9.31. 1 John 3.22. and 5.14, 15.

I may say of prayer, as the Apostle says of Godliness; it has the promises
of this life and that which is to come.

1. For this life.
Temporal and Spiritual things are promised to prayer.

1. Temporal.
1. The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the LORD shall raise him up,
Iam. 5.15.

2. Spiritual.
1. It obtains remission of sins, and if he have committed sins, they
shall be forgiven him, the same verse of 5. of I^mes.

2. The Spirit, How much more shall your heavenly Father give good things to
them that ask him, Matthew. 7.11. Give the holy Spirit to them that ask him, So
it is Luke 11 13.

2. For the life to come.
Prayer obtains eternal life and salvation.

For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD shall be saved, Romans 10.13.

That Promise that is made to our prayers runs thus, If thou prepare thine
heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him, etc. Job 11.13. The stretching
out of our hands (or of our voice either) is to little purpose, if our heart be
not prepared first.

Promises
To fervent prayer.
Then ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, Ier. 29 12, ^3
and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me and find me, Luke 8.7, 8
when ye shall search for me with all your heart, that is, truly and fervently,
says Greenham.

The effectual prayer of a righteous man avails much ( both for the helping
of the body, Iam 5.16.
and healing of the soul) but with this proviso, if it be fervent: open thy
mouth wide, that is, Psalm. 81.10.
earnestly, confidently, call upon me, and I will fill it, that is, I will
satisfy thy desire to the full.

Ask and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock and it shall
be opened unto you, Matthew. 7.7. Ask, seek, knock. It is not a simple
repetition of the same thing, but a gradation. It shows instantissimam
ne^essitatem, says Austen. Ask ^s a beggar, seek as with a candle, knock as
one that has power with importunity. D. Playfer^
One thus descants upon the place; Ask with the mouth, Non dicitur quid
dabitur, says Austen Christ names not what shall be give^ to you, to let us
know that that gift, is a thing suprae omne nomen, above all that can be named
Matthew 6.6.
seek with the heart, knock with the hand: and it shall be given you, that is,
for Temporal things; and ye shall find, that is, for Spiritual things; and
it shall be opened unto you, that is, for Eternal things.

Promises.
1. To Secret Prayer.
When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou have shut thy door,
pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which sees in secret,
shall reward thee openly.

2. To Private or Family prayer.
Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there a^ I in the midst
of them, Matthew 18.20.

3. To public prayer. Public for 1. Matter. 2. Place.


1. A promise to those, that pray for the Church.

Remember Sion, they shall prosper that love thee, Psalm 122.6, 7.

2. Promises to the prayers of the Congregation made in the Church. If every
several beleiver have a promise, Mat 7.7, 8 to be heard in whatsoever he
shall ask according to the will of God, when he prays apart by him self, or
privately in his fr^ily, or with a few, much more when he ioyns in prayer with
the Minister and ^he rest of the godly i^ the publi^ assembly Mat 18, 20.


Jerusalem had singular promises made unto it, such as had no particular
Church in the world besides, Psalm. 132.14.

There is a special promise made to the prayers made in the Temple, 2 Chronicles.
7.15. Mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is
made in this place, 1 Kings 9.3.

The LORD has promised, that he will cause his servants to rejoice in the
granting of their suites which they shall make unto him in his own house, Esaias
56.7. upon the like promise made by GOD, Solomon at the consecration of the
Temple, 1 King. 8.30, 33. groundeth his Prayer, that the LORD would in special
manner, hear the suites and supplications of his servants, publicly assembled
in his Temple to call upon him. See the 5. Book, cap 1.

God has promised to accompany this ordinance of his with the divine power and
efficacy of his Holy Spirit. Esaias 59.21. John 5.25.
A promise.
To Preaching.
GOD has made a special promise to this, that he will be with it, to assist
and bless it, Matthew. 28.20. I am with you always, even unto the end of the
world.

Promises.
To Reading.
Rev. 1.3.
In Reading of the Word, if we understand not, we should apply these Promises.

Prove. 1.23. I will power out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my Words
unto you.

Prove. 1.4. It gives subtilty to the simple, to the young men knowledge and
discretion.

The Commandment of the LORD is pure, inlightning^ the eyes, Ps. 19.8.

GOD has promised to teach and instruct such by his Spirit, that bring good
and honest hearts to the reading and hearing of the Word.

Psalm. 25.12. What man is he that fearth the LORD, him will he teach in the way
that he shall choose.

The promise of finding is made to those who seek as for gold and search as
for treasure, Pro. 2.3, 4, 5.

Promises, to such as love the Word of GOD.
Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing shall offend them, Ps.
119.165.

Blessed is the man that delights greatly in his commandments, Ps. 112.1.

A promise to those that wait for the Word.
There is a blessing promised to such hearers as wait for the Word.

Pro 8, 34, 35. Metaphora a clientibus so res patronoru^ obsidentibus. sunius.
Blessed is the man that hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the
posts of my doors. For who so finds me, finds life and obtains favor of
the LORD.

Promises, that GODS children shall hearken to the Word.

The ears of them that hear shall hearken, Psa. 32 3.

See Esaias 50.4. Acts 16.14.

Promises to such as conscionably hearken to the Word.

Hoe, every one that thirsts come ye to the water, and he that has no money:
come ye, Esa. 5^ 1, 2. Promises

1. General God will ever assist this ordinance and work with it, Mat. 28.10.

2. ^^ee will save the souls of his people by this ordinance, Iam. 1 21. ^s.
55.3.

3 By this ordinance he will begin grace and convert the soul, Ps. 19.7. 4
By this ordinance he will increase and perfect grace where he has begun it,
Mark. 4.24 Act 20.32. God has made also part^cular promises to them that
attend on this ordinance. 1. That by it he will give them strength to overcome
their strongest corruptions, Psalm. 119 9 2. That he will by it work peace in
their consciences, Esaias. 57.9.


buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine, and milk without money, and without price.
Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
delight it self in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and
your soul shall live, etc. There the LORD freely offers saving grace to such
as have none, and nothing, whereby they might purchase it. 2. He sets out a
way whereby they might enjoy it, viz. a diligent hearing and beleiving GODS
Word. 3. He makes most sweet promises, that their soul shall live, that is,
they shall be quickened in CHRIST, and in him the seed of David, be made
partakers of those mercies which shall never decay, If thou warn the righteous
man that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live,
because he is warned, Ezekiel. 3.21. The conscionable hearing of GODS Word,
quickens the soul, and makes it to live both the life of grace and of glory;
Prove ^ 14. Mark 4.24. Luke 1 28. Romans 1.16.
He that hears my word and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting
life: the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of
the Son of GOD, and they that hear shall live, John 5.24, 25. not such a
voice as shall call them out of their graves, as in the 28. verse; for he
says, now is, but the meaning of the place is, that those which were dead in
sin should be quickened either by CHRIST in his own person, or by his Word in
his Ministers.

The titles given to the Word express this.

It is called, the Word of life, Acts 5.20. Phil. 2.16. John 6 68. The Word of
grace, Acts 20.32. The word of Salvation, Acts 13.^6. Salvation it self, and
life e^erlasting, Heb. 2.3. Acts 28.28. John 12.50. The word is able to save
our souls, Jam. 1.21. 1 Timothy 4.16. 1 Cor. 1.21. To this purpose there are so
many commendations of the Word, specially in the Ps^lmes and Pro^erbes, Psalm.
19.^. The l^w of the LORD is perfect; etc. the whole 119. Psalm was written, to
set out the excellency of the Word. The nine first Chapters of the Proverbes;
Take f^^st hold of instruction, let her not go, keep her, for she is thy
life, Pro. 4.13. Instruction is our life, thereby we attain all things
pertaining to the comfort of this life and of that to come. See Pro. 1.9, 23.
Pro. 2. from 1. to 13. Prove. 3.3. to 4. and 13. ver. to 24. Prove. 4.5. to 14.
and 20. to 23. Prove. 6.20. to 24. Pro. 7.1 to 5. and the whole eighth Chapter.
Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth, John 17.17. Do not my
words do good to him that walks uprightly? Micah 2.7. As new born babes
desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby, 1 Pet. 2.2.
The comparisons which are used to set forth the profit of the Word, confirm
this: it is resembled to The light, Esaias 9.2. Rain, Deuteronomy. 32.2. Dea^, there
also, living water, Zach. 14.8. Wine and milk, Esaias 55.1, 2.

It is able, 1. To inlighten with saving knowledge the simplest that shall
hear and read it with an honest heart, Psalm 119.130. 2. To reform the heart
and life of him that has the strongest corruptions, Psalm. 119.9. 3. To comfort
and revive the heart that is most cast down either with inward or outward
afflictions, Esaias 57.19. 4. To preserve and add knowledge and grace to them
that have best profited, Mar. 4.24.

Whenever we go to the Word, we should meditate on some of these precious
promises, We should hear so, as to expect and hope for life by the word which
the Lord promises, Deu. 3^.47. Ioh. 5.39.
to encourage us to attend unto GODS Word with expectation of his blessing on
our labors.

Promises. For the Sacraments. 1. In general.
They are the Seals of the righteousness of faith, Romans 4.11. or of the
Covenant of grace.

The Apostle speaks of both Sacraments, 1 Cor. 12.13.

2. The special^ Sacraments. Baptism. LORDS Supper.

1. Baptism. Promises to it.
It is called, It is a usual thing to call the principal cause and the
instrument by the same name.
The laver of regeneration, Tit. 3.5. The Baptism of repentance for remission
of sins, Mar, 1.4. Act. 2.38. Our sins are said to be washed away, Act.
22.16. Heb. 10.22. and Baptism saves, 1 Pet. 3.21. all which belong to the
blood of CHRIST, Rev. 1.5. 1 John 1.7. our Savior says, we must be borne of
water, John 3.5. that is, be made GODS children by receiving CHRIST, Acts 1, 4,
5.
as John 1.12. GOD has promised that he will baptize us with the HOLY GHOST
and with fire, Mat. 3.11.

2. LORDS Supper. Prom^ses to it.
1 Cor 11 24, 25.
When our LORD JESUS did ordain it, he speaking of the Bread, ^^k. 21.19 ^0
Iohne. 14.5^ Mark 1, 22, ^4.
said, This is my body, and of the Wine, This is my blood of the New Testament,
Mat. ^6.26, 28. that is, these outward signs and seals were most sure and
certain pledges of his body and blood, which he did as truly give to be
spiritual food, as he gave the bread and wine to be bodily food to every
believer, 1 Cor. 10.16.

There is a full meal, (...), Romans 14.17. Bread and Wine comprehend entire
food; for humidum and siccum are all that are required unto food: this is
promised, Esaias 25.6. In this mountain shall the LORD of Hosts make unto all
people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, etc. that is, he
would make for his Church complete provision. So Pro 9.5.

A Lawful Oath. Promises to it. God has promised to reward it.
1. In this life, Jer. 12.16. If they will learn the ways of my people, to
swear the LORD lives etc. then shall they be built in the midst of my people.
2. In the life to come with eternal happiness, for he that swears and
charge not, though it be to his own hinderance, he shall dwell in GODS holy
Mountain, Psalm. 15 4.
Fasting. Promises to it.

praise thee. Then shall the Earth yield her increase, and GOD, even our own
GOD shall bless us. Psalm. 67.5, 6.

Promises. To Meditation.
Mercy and truth shall be to them which devise good, Pro 14 22.

This promise may be also applied, to the following of good examples and
presidents.
Think of these things which ye have both learned and received, and heard and
seen in me; and the GOD of peace shall be with you, Phil. 4.8, 9.

Let not the book of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day
and night, that thou may observe to do according to all that is written

delight thy (...) in the LORD, and I will cause (...) to ride upon the high
places of the (...).

2. Spiritual.
Blessed is the man that keeps the Sabbath from polluting it, Esa. 56.2. See
5, 6, 7. verses, Jer. 17.24, 26. a special place. GOD promises there, 24, and
26. verses to reward the outward observation of the Sabbath. The blessing there
promised is twofold, the first concerns the Commonwealth, verse. 25. The
second the Church and State of Religion, v. 26.

Promises. To Watchfullnesse.
Blessed is he that watches, Matthew. 24.46, 47. Revel. 16.15.

They are three times said to be blessed, Terque quate^que beati. Poelices ter
and amp^ius Horat.
Luke 12.37, 38, 43. to show that they are thrice blessed and ever perfected in
blessedness, which keep constantly their spiritual watch.

See Mat 6. Heb 13.16. Eccles. 11.^. Esaias 587, 8, 10, 11.

Ps. 129.


Beneficence shall be rewarded.

1. In this l^fe. 1. In our selves. 2. In our posterity, Ps. 37.25, 26. 1. In
our selves, with 1. Mercy, Blessed are the merciful for they shall receive
mercy, Mat. 5.7 Pro. 14.21, 22. Pro. 14.21, 22
2. Comfort in sickness. 3. Deliverance out of trouble: one verse proves both,

in time of trouble, the LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing,

gives unto the poor shall not lack, Pro. 28.27. this is a means to bring us
to the right use of our wealth, Luke 11.41.
2. In the life to come, Come ye blessed of my Father, receive the Kingdom
prepared for you from the beginning of the world, etc. Mat. 25.34. Make to your
selves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousnes, that when ye fail they may
receive you into everlasting habitations, Lu. 16.9. Receiving is not mentioned
here in regard of merit Though Alms deeds merit not at Gods hands: yet they
make him our debtor according to his gracious promise, said King James, Pro,
1^.17. 1 Timothy 6.18.19.
(as the Papists say) as though a man could deserve it by giving of alms, but
either by way of hearty prayers made by the poor, that they may be received,
or else because their Alms shall be unto them a pledge and earnest of their
receiving into GODS Kingdom as a Father says sweetly if ye will be wise
Merchants, thrifty and happy usurers, part with tha^ which you cannot keep that
you may gain the which you cannot lo^s^ When thou make a feas^ call the

Promises. 1. To liberality to the Saints.
He that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man. shall
receive a righteous man's reward. Dicit frigidae aquae, ne in calida sumptu^
lignoru^ causari quis posset, Hieron. Mark 9.4. Propecuto aquae fr^gidae
torrens voluptatis.
And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones, a cup of
cold water only in the name of a Disciple, he shall in no wise loose his
reward, Mat. 10.41, 42. For a cup of cold water, (water the common element, and
cold water that cost thee not the charge of fire to warm it) there is a
Torrent, may a very Sea of all pleasures provided for thee for all eternity.
For GOD is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye
have showed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the Saints, and do
minister, Hebr. 6.10.

See Gal. 6.9, 10.

Promises. To bounty to GODS Ministere.
He that receives you, receives me: He that receives a Prophet in the name
of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward, Matthew. 10.40, 41. Some
understand that thus, they shall be partakers of the same reward, which is laid
up for the Prophets. Calvin takes it for a reward which is fit for the
worthiness of the person, upon whom the liberality shall be bestowed.

Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine
increase: So shall thy barnes be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall
burst out with new wine, Prove. 3.9, 10. See Mal. 3.10 1^.
And the Levite because he has no part nor inher^tance with thee, A promise to
paying of tithes.
shall come and shall eat, and be satisfied, that the LORD thy GOD may bless
thee in all the work of thine hand which thou do, Deuteronomy. 14.29.

Promises to seeking of GOD. Zephany 2.3

1. They shall have their hearts filled with joy and gladness Rest on every
side from enemies
in the fruition of GODS favor. Book IV


2 Chro. 14.7
That prophetical prayer of David's implies also a promise in it, Ps. 40.16.
Let all those that seek thee, be glad and rejoice in thee.

Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD, Psalm 105.3. the very same
is, 1 Chro. 16.10.

The LORD often promised to his people, that if they should seek him, Esaias
55.6.
he would be found of them, as David told Solomon his son, 2 Chro 14 7 Mat.
77.
1 Chronicles. 28.9. and the Prophet told Asa the King, 2 Chro. 15.2. See 15.

Thou LORD have not forsaken them that seek thee, Ps. 9.10. Esa 45.19.

But his people then must seek him with their whole heart, 2 Chro. 31.11
Blessed are they that seek him with their whole heart, Psalm 119.2.
as Deuteronomy. 4.29. Jer. 29.13. and diligently, Heb. 11.6.

Seek yea me, and ye shall liv^ Amos 5.4, 6. And your heart sha^^ live that
seek GOD, Psalm 69.32.

The hand of our GOD is upon all them for good that seek him, Book III
Ezra 8.22. Lam. 3.23.

They that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing, Psalm. 34.10.

Promis^s. To waiting on GOD.
Waiting patiently for the LORDS coming to comfort us, either in temporal or
spiritual distresses, is a right pleasing and acceptable duty and s^rvice unto
GOD, which he is wont to crown with multiplied and overflowing refre^hings
when he comes. They that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength, they
shall m^unt up with w^ngs as Eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they
shall walk and not faint, Es^. 40.31. For since the beginning of the world,
w^^ have not heard nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O
GOD, besides thee, what he has prepared for him that waits for him, Esaias
64.4. they shall not be ashamed (or disappointed) that wait for him, Esaias
49.23. He shall save them, Pro. 20.22. They shall inherit the earth, Psalm.
37.9, 34. and Heaven too. Blessed are all they that wait for him, Esaias 30.18.
Dan. 12.12.

We must stir up our selves to receive the promises, Cant. 5.2, 3. The godly
sometimes walk without comfort, because they put it from themselves, and GOD
oftentimes causes his children to seek long before they find comfort. But the
ardent desire shall at length be satisfied. Remission of sins, and peace of
conscience, are favors worth waiting for. We have not waited so many years in
the means of grace for comfort, as GOD has waited for our conversion.

Promises. 1. That we shall delight in God.
Then shall thou have they delight in the Almighty, Job 22.26. The promise of
delighting our selves in the LORD, is confined to the duty of delighting in
holy exercises, If thou call the Sabbath a delight, etc. then shall thou
delight in the LORD, Esa. 58.13, 14.

A promise. To delighting in GOD.
Delight thy self in the LORD, Psalm ^9 15 16, ^7, 18.
and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart, Ps. 37.4.

Promises to godliness or grace exercised, or to godly and gracious men which
act the graces, and exercise themselves in the duties above specified.

True Godliness has the promises both of this life and of that which is to
come, 1 Timothy 4 8.
( of this life) Seek ye first the kingdom of GOD and the righteousness
thereof, Book IV
and al these things shall be administered unto you, Matthew. 6.33. (and of the
life to come) To him that order^th his conversation aright, will I show the
salvation of GOD, Ps. 50.23.

^r^mises in gen^rall to the w^ys of godliness.
1. The godly shall be blessed.
(...) ^.13 Ps. 11^.1. Ps. 9.8. Ps. ^11* 12, 13. Ps. 110.1. Ps. 1.1. Ps. 128.1,
4.

They whom the world account above all men most miserable, are truly and only
happy, as our Savior prooves, Matthew. 5. Blessed are the poor in spirit, etc.
from 3. ver. to 12. we shall never be truly happy till we be sincerely holy,
nor fully happy till we be perfectly holy. (...), Au^^in.


2. The godly shall be a blessing to the place where they live.

I will bless thee, and the^ shall be a blessing, Genesis 12.2.

And I will make them a blessing, Ezekiel. 34.^6. I^rael shall be a blessing in
the midst of the land, Esaias 19.24.

Damnation.
Ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end, Esaias 45.17. Romans 9.
Some do refer it to the day of judgment when the faithful shall not be
confounded or ashamed cum ventris in future, when Christ shall come to
judgeme^t Gloss interlin, Haym^ But it is more general, showing that the
faithful neither in the time present nor to come shall be ashamed. Not to be
confounded sign^fieth non frustrati, not to be disappointed of the^r hope, P.
Matt. And more is under^^ood then said, i.e. shall be confirmed comforted and
establishe^, Parus.
33. and 10 11. 1 Pet. 2.6.

GOD will deliver the soul of the righteous from the pit. Job 33.28. Ps. 86.13.

There is no condemnation to them that are in CHRIST JESUS, Romans 8.1. Who shall
lay any thing to the charge of GODS elect? It is GOD that justifies, ver. 33.

They are delivered from the wrath to come, 1 These. 1.10.

HE that will bear with comfort the pangs of death, He that will k^ep^ my
saying, shall ^ot test of death. John 8.51 that is shall not be overwhel^ed by
^t.
must labor to die in faith, that is, he must lay hold of the promise of GOD
touching forgiveness of sins and life everlasting by CHRIST. All these (says
the HOLY GHOST, Heb. 11.13.) died in the Faith: viz. Abel, Enoch, Noe, Abraham
and Sarah, all laying hold of the promise of life by CHRIST: So Jacob, Genesis
49.18. by Faith rested on the mercy of GOD, and by hope he waited for his
salvation.

Thou shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes, Job 5.21. Death be it
never so bitter or painful, shall not be able to separate us from the love of
GOD, Romans 8.28, 38. St. Stephens violent death was but a sweet sleep, Act.

called a bed of rest, Esaias 57.2. CHRIST has pulled the sting out of death for
all the godly, Dying in the Lord. Revel ^4.13 is but a rest from labors, 2 Timothy 1.10.

death, Heb. 2.14, 15. The righteous has hope in his death, Pro. 14.32. it is
gain unto him, Phil. 1.21. for he is delivered by death from many and great
evils. 1. Sin, That one happy pang which pulls away the soul from the body,
does also pull away sin both from the soul and body
Romans 6.7. He shall never offend GOD more: 2. Those miseries which follow sin,
Esaias 57.1, 2.3. The temptations of the Devil Rev. 12.8.4. The opposition and
vexation of the world and flesh, God does watch over the faithful for good by
his pro^idence, both in life and death, Mat. 10.28, 29, 30 31. Psa. 72.14
Rev. 14.13. Eccles. 4.1, 2. It is to them obstetrix immortalitatis, a passage
to immortality, 2 Cor. 5.1, 4. a sturdy Porter, that opens heaven gates unto
him.

See 1 Cor. 3.22. and 15.26. Psalm 37.37.

2. Comforts against the fear of untimely death.
Thou shall come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shocke of corn comes
in, in his season, Job 5.26.

The number of thy days will I fulfill, Exodus 23.26. The Lord will preserve
him and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth. Ps. 4. 1.2.
With long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation, Ps. 91.16.

2. Burial.
It is a kind of blessing promised by GOD to his Saints, to be buried. 1 King.
14.13. 2 King. 22.20.

2 Samuel 25. In Christ shall all be made alive, 1 Cor 15 ^^punc; that is shall be
raised by him at the resurrection.

The Cerma^es call the Church yard Godsaker, because the bodies are sown there
to be raised again: and the Grecians called their Church yards, or places of
sepulture, (...) dormitories, or sleeping places where the bodies rest,
expecting the resurrection.


3. Resurrection. Promises of our Resurrection.
He which raised up the LORD JESUS, shall raise up us al^o by JESUS.

The Covenant of GOD is of force with us, as we lie in the dust of the Earth,
Mat. 22.31.32.

He keeps the very bones of his Saints, Ps. 34.20.

All that are in the grave shall come forth, they that have done good unto the

Faith apprehends the promise of eternal life, hope expects it, love
thankfully entertaines it, and all other graces are quickened and strengthened by

and 12.26.

they cannot be contained in the soul of man.

life, Iam. 1.12. Rev. 2.10. A Crown of righteousness, 2 Timothy 4.8. An
immarcessible Crown of glory, 1 Pet. 5.4. The word [Crowne] represents unto us:
Sir Thomas Bodley gave for his arms three crowns with this posey, Quarta
perennu erit, the fourth shall be eternal.
1. The perpetuity of that life, for a crown has neither beginning nor
ending: 2. Plenty, because as the crown compasses on every side, so there is
nothing wanting in this life: 3. Dignity, eternal life is a coronation day,
every Saint shall be a crowned King.

The use of Faith in regard of these promises, is to uphold us with the
expectation of that heavenly happiness which is promised, yea though we be
destitute of worldly things and be in many troubles and tribulations, Act.

Esaias ^3 20. The unvisible Church is the ^^llar of truth, Christ is made to her
righteousness, sanctifica^io She has all light and (...) here, and in Heaven.
The ^ambe himself shall be her Sun and glory She shall be led into al truth.
Her fai^^ shall not fai^^ her enemies shall ^cke the do of her sect, and come
and worship before her, she shall inherit the earth, prevail against the gates
of her enemies. Yea the promises made to Christ himself, are applied to her,
compare Esaias 49 ^. with that in 2 Cor 6^
CHAP. I. Promises in regard of others. The Church in general, or particular
Churches, as public Assemblies.
1. GOD will defend the Church, and all the faithful.
THE gates of Hell shall not prevail against it, Matthew. 16.18.

GOD is in the mid^^ of the Church, therefore it shall not fall, Ps. 46.5.

I the LORD do keep it, I will water it every moment: least any hurt it, I
will keep it night and day, Esaias 27.3.

As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his
people from hence forth, and for ever, Ps. 125.2.

See Esaias 4.5, 6. Psalm. 46. whole, 124, and 125. Psalms, Psalm. 132.13. to 17.
Psalm. 89.15, 16, 17, 18. Zach. 9.16.

GOD has made promises unto the public assemblies, Promises unto the Church
assemblies,
of his special protection.

Look upon Sion, the city of our solemn f^asts; thine eyes shall see
Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that cannot be removed, etc. Es^y
33.20, 21. See ver. 16. This was one reason why David so esteemed of GODS
Tabernac^es, Ps. 84.11. For the LORD GOD is a sun and shield unto us.

Christ has promi^ed to be present in a more comfortable manner in the
assemblies of his people, then in any of our houses or any other place.
2. GOD has promised to be present with his Church and people in a special
manner.
There are promises, 1. Of the presence of CHRIST, Matthew. 18.20. and 28.20. 1
Cor. 5.4. Rev. 2.1. Esaias 31.9. 2. Of the presence of the HOLY GHOST Esa. 59.21.

GOD has made promises to the public assemblies of his special presence.

Promises unto the Church Assemblies.
In this respect the Prophet calls, Sion the habitation of GODS house, and the
place where his honor dwells, Psalm. 26.8. Psalm. 132.14. in this respect the
place of GODS public worship, is called the face of GOD.

The Synagogues were called the houses of GOD, Psalm 83.12. This promise is
also made to our Assemblies as well as theirs, Matthew. 18.20. Where two or three
are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them, Rev. 2.1.
CHRIST walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. Public places
have a p^omise of Gods special presence in them, 1 King 9.3.


3. GOD has p^omised his special blessing to public assemblies.
In all places where I record my name, w^ll I come to thee and bless thee.
Exodus, 20.24.

GOD has p^omised Temporal blessings to such as do love and frequent the
Assemblies. No good thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly,
Psalm. 84.11. David makes this one reason of his love to GODS Tabernacles, but
the chief reason why he so esteemed them, was this, the LORD will give grace
and glory, and 133.3. There is beauty, Ps. 7 4 good^e^se ta^nesse in Gods
hou^e, such as (...) fill the soul of a man, and give him as much as he can
desire Esaias 55.7.
For there (in Sion) the LORD appointed the blessing and life for ever. The
LORD shall bless thee out of Sion, Psalm. 128.5. We shall be satisfied with
the goodness of thy house, even of thine holy Temple, Ps 63, 4.

See Psalm. 36.8, 9. and 92.13, 14.

4. GOD will deliver the Church out of trouble.
Thou shall see peace upon Israel. Ps. 128.6.

Thou shall see the good of Jerusalem, all the days of thy life, verse 5.

The LORD will not cast off his people, nor forsake his inheritance. Ps. 94.14.

Thus says the LORD, after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon, I will
visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to
this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD,
thoughts of peace, to give you an expected end, Jerem. 29.10, 11.

They shall sit every man under his vine, and under his fig tree, and none
shall make them afraid for the mouth of the LORD (...) Hosts has spoken it.
Many nations are gathered against thee, but they know not the thoughts of the
LORD: For he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor, Micah 4.4, 11,
12.

When thus it shall be in the midst of the Land amongst the people: there
shall be as the shaking of an Olive Tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the
vintage is done, Esaias 24.13.

See Esaias 61.10. Deuteronomy. 4.29, 30. Jeremy 33.6. Jeremie 31.12. Esaias 27.5, 7, 8, 9.

CHAP. II. Promises.
1. Against the seductions of Antichrist.
1. THE faithful are of GOD, and overcome Antichristian Seducers, 1 John 4.4.

2. The Elect cannot be seduced. Mat. 24.24.

Promises. 2. For the d^struction of Antichrist.
The ten horns which thou saw upon the beast, See 2 Thessalonians. 2.8.
these shall have the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall
eat h^^ flesh, and shall burn her with fire. Rev. 17.16.

There is a promise that Babylon shall be cast into the Sea as a millstone,
Rev. 18.21. See ver. 8.
And a mighty Angel took ^p a stone like a great millstone and cast it into
the Sea, saying, thus with violence shall the great city Babylon be thrown
down, and and shall be found no more at all. Each word almost has a
gradation; in that an Angel, a strong Angel, takes a stone, F^rb^s upon the
place Magnas la pa sua mol^ ^uit cum ingeni^ impetu^ mato i^si pro ijciatu^r
long maximo, protectus ab act quo valido and ^ebusto. Brightma^nu. in locum.
and a great stone, even a millstone, which he lets not barely fall, but
casts and with impetuous force, thrusts in the bottom of the Sea whence
nothing ordinarily is recovered, much less a millstone, thrust from such a
hand, and with such force.

CHAP. III. Promises. For calling the Jews.
THere is a promise made of calling the Jews unto CHRIST, and causing them to
turn from their transgressions, The Redeemer shall come from Sion, and unto
them that return from transgression in Jacob, Esaias 59.20. They shall be
graffed in again, for GOD is able to graffe them in, as it is written, there
shall come out of Sion a deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob, Romans 11.23, 26. Before the second coming of CHRIST, the Jews shall be
converted and become a most famous Church again: and they shall be the means
of the salvation of all the Elect, that shall remain to be converted among the
Gentiles, as the Apostle plainly teaches there 25, 26. verses, I would not
Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, that blindness in part
is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so
all Israel shall be saved.

In Hosea there are most sweet and comfortable promises to the Jews.

1. Of delivering them out of misery, and making them to flourish again,
comparing their wretched estate to death, and their delivery to a resurrection,
Hos. 13.14.

2. A promise of their repentance and turning unto GOD, Hos. 14.2, 3.

3. Of the forgiveness of sins, peace, reconciliation, verse 4.

4. Of a glorious Church. 5, 6, 7, 8. verses.

These promises which GOD has made unto that nation, that he will call them,
and make them his people again, should provoke us to pray for them, as they
did for us, Cant. 8.8.

CHAP. IV. Promises. For bringing in the Gentiles.
THus says the Lord, Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, Esaias 42
2^, ^3
and set up my standard (i.e. the Gospel) to the people, and they shall bring
their sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their
shoulders, and Kings shall be thy nursing Fathers, and Queens thy nursing
Mothers: that is, GOD will stir up the Princes of the Earth to be a
protection to it, and to shrowed it under the wings of their authority. The
Apostle John speaking of the new Jerusalem, says, Ps. 68.29, 31. and 7^.10, 11
and ^^.19. Esa 62 2. Ps. 38 4.
the Kings of the earth shall bring their glory to it, Rev. 21.24.

Other sheep I have (says our Savior, meaning the Gentiles not yet called)
which are not of this fold, them also must I bring, and they shall hear my
voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd, Joh. 10.16.

And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, Esa. 60.3, 5, 8
and Kings to the brightness of thy rising. The abundance of the Sea shall be
converted un^o thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. Who are
these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? Act. 10.45
they are the words of the Church, wondering, as it were at the sight of such a
propagation, as a cloud and Doves: it is a prophecy of the Gentiles
converted, they fly as a cloud, that is, most swiftly, and shall in such f^ocks
come into the Church, as if a whole flight of Doves driven by some hawke or
tempest, should scour into the Columbary and rush into the windows. The
Prophet Esaias almost in every Chapter speaks of the vocation of the Gentiles,
as the 2. and 9. the 11. the 18. the 42. and 45.

See 49. Chap. 12. and Chap. 54.1. And Chap. 65.1. Amos 9.11, 12. Ephesians. 2.12,
19. John 12.32.

CHAP. V. Promises. To Magistrates.
THe LORD makes expressly this promise unto a godly King, that if he decline not
from the commandment to the right hand or to the left, he shall prolong his
days in the kingdom, he and his sons in the midst of Israel. Deuteronomy.
17.19.20. His enemies will I cloth with shame, but upon himself shall his
crown flourish, Psalm 132.18.

Promises, to Ministers. 1. Extraordinary, the Apostles. 2. Ordinary, all
faithful Ministers.


Promises to the Apostles.
1. To work miracles, M^t. 19 2^. and 28.^0.
Mar. 6.17. That promise was made by CHRIST unto his Church to be fullfilled
immediately after his ascension. It extended only to the times of the Primitive
Church, and to such as then lived, Perkins.

2. To cast out Devils, Mat. 10.1.

3. The Spirit promised to le^de them into all truth, John 16.13. so that they
were free from error in doctrine.

Promises to faithful Ministers.
1. For sufficiency and a competent measure of the blessings of this life.

GOD promises this as a blessing to his Church, that in the plenty and
abundance he would give to his people, his Ministers also should be
plentifully provided for: And I will satiate the soul of the Priests with
fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with goodness, says the Lord, Ier.
31.14.

Levi has no part nor i^heritance with his brethren, the LORD is his
inheritance, according as the LORD thy GOD promised him: Deuteronomy. 10.9.

2. Of protection and deliverance from trouble.

I will cloth her Priests with salvation, Ps. 132.16. I am with thee; says
the LORD to Jeremy, to deliver thee. Ier. 1.18, 19. See 7. and 8. verses, Jer.
15.19, 20. and 20.11. Ezekiel. 2.6. and 3.9.

He holds the stars in his right hand, Rev. 2.1. by which is signified his
power in protecting and governing his Ministers.

2. GOD will take their part against their enemies and revenge their wrongs.

He suffered no man to do them wrong, yea he reproved Kings for their sakes,
saying, Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm, Ps. 105.14, 15.
Hitherto belongs that benediction and prophetical prayer that Moses made for
Levi: Bless LORD his substance, and accept the work of his hands, smite
through the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him, that
they rise not again, Deuteronomy. 33.11.

4. GOD has promised to give good success to their labors. It was promised,
Esa 6.13. that a tenth should return.


He walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, Rev. 2.1. by which
action is noted, his presence in the middst of his Church, guiding and blessing
his Ministers with all the members thereof.

Lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the world, Matthew. 28.20.
CHRIST was present with his Apostles, and now is with their Successors by his
protection of their persons, and cooperation in their work. But if they had
stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they
should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their
doings. Jeremy 23.22.

1 Timothy 4.16. Rev ^1 18. Dan. 12.^. Mat. 24.45, 46.

2 Timothy 4 7, 8 Secundum labore^ accipient, non secund um proventam, says
Bernard.


5. Their reward shall be great.

They shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away, 1 Pet. 5.2, 4.

Their reward is with God. Esa. 49.4,

6. They shall agree together, and join force against the common Adversary.

It is promised, as a blessed fruit of the Gospel, Esaias 11.13, 14.
That Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim: But they
shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the West.

CHAP. VI. Promises. To Masters of families and godly Servants.
IN ordering and guiding the affairs of our family, we should depend by faith
upon GODS blessing. See Ps. 127.

Promises to godly servants.

1. They have a general promise, 1 Timothy 4.8. 2. More special ones.
Servants, be obedient unto them that are your masters, Ephesians 6 5, 8
etc. Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he
receive of the LORD, whither he be bond or free: whatsoever ye do, do it
heartily as to the LORD and not to men, knowing that of the LORD ye shall
receiv^ the reward of inheritance: for ye serve the LORD CHRIST, Col 3.23, 24.

The Apostle Peter shows that a poor servant when he suffers hard words and
ill usage from his master, does herein find acceptance from GOD, ^ Pet. 2.19.

GOD has promised to the faithful, to keep their houses, and bless them in
their going out and coming in.

It is a special blessing often promised to the godly, that their habitation and
dwelling shall prosper, He blesses the hab^tation of the Just, Pro 3.33. Exodus
34 24.
Pro. 3.33. that GOD will make the habitation of their righteousness prosperous,
Job 8.6. yea that they shall know and feel, that peace shall be in their
tabernacles, Job 5.24.

There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling, Pro. 14.11.

The tabernacle of the upright shall flourish, the house of the righteous shall
stand, Pro. 12.7.

GOD keeps such a fence about them, and their houses, and all that they have,
as Satan cannot hurt them, Job 1.10.

Blessed shall thou be when thou come in, and blessed shall thou be when
thou go out, Deuteronomy. 28.6.

The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this time
forth and even for evermore Ps. 121.8.

It is the protection of GOD that keeps our houses from the calamities of fire
within, and lightening from Heaven, and from the annoyance and molestation of
evil spirits, and other judgments; governors of families should therefore put
sin far from their Tabernacles, Job 22.23.

CHAP. VII. Promises. To Husband and Wife.
IF the Husband or wife be godly, they have a promise from the Lord for their
comfort. David bestows a whole Psalm upon them to this purpose, viz. 128. the
sum whereof was this, that he should eat the labors of his hands, that he is
well, and should be happy: that his wife should be as the fruitful vine upon
the walls of his house, comfortable as well as fruitful: that his children
should be like the olive branches round about his Table: profitable and
beneficial as well as many (those are of the best fruits, the one for chearing
the heart, the other for clearing the face, Psalm. 104.15. the one for
sweetness, the other for fatness, Judge. 9.13.) that he should see Jerusalem
in prosperity all his life long, that he should see his childrens children (as
Job 42.16.) and peace upon Israel. See also Prove. 31.28. and 30. verses.
promises made to the virtuous woman, and Proverbes 11.16.

Promises. Concerning children.
GOD promises the godly, 1. To give them the fruit of the womb.

It is promised, as a blessing and favor of GOD to his people, to multiply
their seed, and to make them fruitful.

I will make you fruitful and multiply you, Lev. 26.9. He will bless thee,
and multiply thee. There shall neither be male nor female barren among you,
Deu. 7.13, 14. The like is, Deu. 6.3.8.^. and 28.11.

Thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth, Job
5.25.

Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house, thy
children like olive plants round about the table. Lo thus shall the man be
blessed that fears the LORD. Thou shall see thy childrens children, Ps.
128.3, 4, 6.

See Esaias 48.19. Ps. 115.14. and 127.3. Ps. 113.9.

These promises may abundantly suffice to settle the minds and hearts of any
true believer, under this tentation of grief for want of children, that
assuredly GOD will fulfill their desire, if it be good for them.

2. To bless their children every way, 1. With outward things. 2. In their
souls.

GOD has made a free and gracious Covenant with the believing Parents, and
their posterity, Genesis 17.7, 9. Act. 2.39. Ier. 32.39. He has promised to
bless their children every way, He will bless the fruit of thy womb, Deuteronomy.
7.13.

This is intended in all those places, where it is said, I will be the GOD of
thy seed, which was said to That very promise was after repeated to Abraham's
posterity in all ages, to be a staff of comfort to them still, therefore it is
often said, that God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Exodus 36 15, ^6 Le^^
42 Ps. 105 8. (...).
Abraham the father of the faithful, Genesis 17. and belongs to all Acts 3.25.
Romans 4.11.16 1 Cor 7.14.
believers. The just man walks in his integrity, his children are blessed
after him, Pro. 20.7.

1. GOD will bless them with outward things.
Personal goodness is a good means to bring safety, honor, wealth, and many
comfortable blessings upon posterity.

Exodus 20.6. Their children and childrens children to many generations shall be
blessed. Esa. 619 and 65.23. Ps. 102 ^8. Pro. 14.26
Ps. 37.25, 26. Pro. 11.21.

His seed shall be mighty upon the earth, the generation of the upright shall
be blessed, Ps. 112.2. His seed shall inherit the earth, Ps. 25, 13. Ps. 37.29.

A good man leaves an inheritance to his childrens children, Pro. 13.22.

2. GOD will bless them in their souls.
I will power my Spirit upon thy seed, Esa. 44.3, 4.

Thy children shall be taught of the LORD, and great shall be the peace of thy
children. Esaias 54.13.

If we know our selves to be GODS children, we may be assured (says one H^on 4
of Job
) that some of our posterity shall be so likewise.

They are foederati in GODS Covenant, by means of their Parents, whom when GOD
received into the Church, 1 Cor 7 14. Romans 11.16. See 1 Kin 11 34. and 2 Kings
10.30.
he received them with this promise, I will be thy GOD, and the GOD of thy seed.

Good Parents though they be poor, leave their children a good patrimony, for
they have laid up many prayers for them in heaven, and they leave them GODS
favor for their possession; this is urged therefore as a motive by the HOLY
GHOST to provoke Parents unto all righteousness, Deuteronomy. 5.29.

It is promised as a blessing, that mothers shall give suck to the children
that they bear.

GOD shall bless thee with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb, Genesis
49.25.

Promises. To Parents correcting their children.
The rod and reproof give wisdom: correct thy son, and he shall give thee
rest, yea he shall give delight to thy soul, Proverbs 29.15, 17.

Hold not correction from thy child, for if thou beatest him with the rod he
shall not die. Thou shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul
from Hell, Pro. 23.13, ^4.

Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction
shall drive it far from him, Pro. 22.15.

Promises to comfort them in the want of children.
To them will I give in mine house, and within my walls, a place and a name
better then of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name,
that shall not be cut off, Esa. 56.5.

Promises. To children obeying their Parents.
Honor thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long upon the Land
which the LORD thy GOD gives thee, Exodus 20.12.

The Apostle, Ephesians. 6.2. says this is the first Commandment with promise.

The second Commandment has a Promise annexed unto it, Object.
and a large one, of showing mercy unto thousands, to them that love GOD, Exodus
20.6.

The Greek (...). Ambrose and Piscator say, this is the first precept of the
second Table with promise.
word used by the Apostle, Answ.
properly signifies an affirmative precept, as our English word [Commandement]
does, of the affirmative precepts it is the first with promise; Secondly, the
promise in the second Commandment is only a general promise made to observers
of the whole Law, and therefore he uses the plural number [ Commandements] and
says in the general showing mercy to thousands, but this is a special
promise made to them that keep this particular Commandment: Boza, V^sin, R^vet
on 20. of Exo Zanchtu^ on Ephesians 6. B Bahington B. Andrews.

D. Gouge and others.


that it may be well with thee, and thou may live; this answer is given by
many Learned Divines.

It follows, ver. 3. That it may be well with thee, and thou may live long
on the Earth.

The promise mentioned before in general, is particularly set down.

Whatsoever belongs to a man's welfare and wel-being in this life is here
promised, says D. Willet.

All manner of blessings, Spiritual and Temporal, belonging to soul and
body, concerning this life and the life to come, make to a man's well-being; but
temporal prosperity is here principally intended, Deuteronomy. 5 1^.
says Doctor Gouge.

And Jeremiah says unto the house of the Rechabites; Ier 35.18, 19
Thus says the LORD of Hosts the GOD of Israel, because ye have obeyed the
commandment of Ionadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done
according unto all that he has commanded you: Therefore thus says the LORD of
Hoasts, the GOD of Israel, Ionadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to
stand before me for ever.

My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy
mother. For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about
thy neck, Prove. 1.8, 9. See 6.20.

CHAP. VIII. Promises. For Company.
That we shall reap good by the society of the godly.
HE that walks with wise men, shall be wise, Prove. 13.20.

Then they that feared the LORD, spoke often one to another, and the LORD
hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for
them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. Mal. 3.16, 17.
And they shall be mine, says the LORD of Hosts, in that day when I make up my
Jewels, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son that serves him.

Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them, Mat. 18.20.
