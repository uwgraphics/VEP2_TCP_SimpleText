TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE PARLIAMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH of ENGLAND.
The humble Petition of the Company of Worsted-Weavers of the City of Norwich,
and County of Norfolk.
Humbly Shows, Worsted-Weavers, and others in the City and County aforesaid,

a Committee. That the said Committee, after many hearings of the parties on
both sides, did report the same to this Honorable Parliament. That upon
hearing of the said report, made by the said Committee to this Honorable
Parliament, it was Ordered that an Act should be drawn, whereby provision
should be made against the irrigularities of the said Combers. That the said
Act has been read and recommitted, and for a long time has been ready to be
produced. That your Petitioners finding a decay of Trade still to increase, and
that many Families, are daily ruined for want of a just regulation, are forced
to be thus solicitous with your Honors; and humbly do pray, That your Honors

Act according to your Order, of the thirtieth of July last, may be this day
read and determined.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray.

Signed in the Name, and by the appointment of the Company of Worsted-Weavers
in Norwich and Norfolk. Per me (...)
