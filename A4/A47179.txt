Q. Seeing Christ is called the Word in Scripture, John 1.1. Is it not false to
call the Scriptures the Word; for the Scriptures are not Christ, but testify
of him?

A. It is no more false, than to call the Sun light, because God is called
Light in Scripture, 1 John 1.5.

Q. How is then the Word distinguished?

A. The essential Word is Christ, but the Doctrinal Word that was first spoken,
and then committed to writing, is that contained in the holy Scriptures?

Body?

Q. How can two such Natures be one Christ?

A. By the personal Union of both, as the Soul and Body of a Man is one Man, 1
Cor. 8.6.

Q. How was Christ the Son of David and Abraham?

A. Because he was born of the Virgin Mary, who was descended of David and
Abraham, Mat. 1.1, 20, 25.

A. Jesus signifies Savior and Christ Anointed.

SECT. V.

Bishop, Shepherd, Captain, Physician?

A. They are all contained under these three.

Q. Was it needful that he should be both God and Man, in one Person, to
perform all these his three Offices?

A. Yea.

Q. Is not Christ the Foundation of all the Faithful in particular, and of the
whole Church in general, as he is both God and Man, and as he is Prophet,
Priest and King, and as such is not he, the Vine, and they the Branches?

A. Yea, Isaiah 28.16. 1 Cor. 3.11. Ephesians. 2.20. 1 Pet. 2.6. John 15.5.

Q. How does Christ perform the Office of a Prophet?

A. By teaching us by his Word and Doctrine outwardly delivered to us in the
Holy Scriptures, by Reading and Preaching, and by his Spirit inwardly
enlightening our Minds to understand what is outwardly delivered, Isaiah 59.23.
John 17.8, 14, 20. John 16.13.

Q. Have not Men some knowledge of God, without the Scriptures?

A. Yea, and all Men may know some things of God and of his Will, without the
Scriptures, partly by what God does manifest in them, and partly by the Works
of Creation, and Providence without them, and toward them, Romans 1.19, 20. John
1.9.

Q. But are the peculiar Doctrins of the Christian Religion, concerning the way
of Life and Salvation revealed to Mankind, without the Scriptures, or some
outward Means of Instruction, according to the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures?

A. Nay.

Q. How was the Doctrine of Salvation made known to Men, before the Scriptures
were writ?

A. The same Doctrine was taught by good and holy Men with word of Mouth, which
was accompanied with the inward teaching of the Spirit of God in all the
Faithful.

Q. How had they that Doctrine outwardly conveyed unto them?

A. By means of the Prophets, whom God raised up in the several Ages from Adam
to Moses, and the following Prophets.

Q. What is the Gospel of Salvation? Is it not the Doctrine of Salvation, as
held forth in the Holy Scriptures, by and through Jesus Christ, with respect to
his Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection, etc. And spiritual Blessings received by
him?

A. Yea, Luke 2.10.

Q. Is it not a greater Error, to say, that the Light within every Man, that
teaches nothing of Christ Crucified, and raised again, is the Gospel of
Christ, yea, the whole Gospel without any thing else?

A. Yea.

Q. What place of Scripture in the Old Testament, did show that Christ the
promised Messiah should be a Prophet, whom all were to hear?

A. Deuteronomy. 18.15, 16, 17, 18. The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a
Prophet, etc.

Q. What place in the Old Testament did show that he was to give Light to the
Gentiles?

A. Isaiah 49.6. I will also give thee for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou
may be my Salvation to the end of the Earth.

Q. Was that Prophecy fulfilled by the common Illumination, given to all
Mankind without the Preaching of the Gospel, requiring Faith in Christ
Crucified?

A. Nay, But by the Preaching of the Gospel, and the special Illuminations of
Christ, by the holy Spirit inwardly accompanying it, 2 Cor. 4.4, 6. Ephesians. 1,
17, 18.

Q. How did it appear that the Man Jesus, born of Mary was that Prophet?

A. By his Prophecies, his Miracles, his most excellent Doctrine, and most holy
Life, and the many other things that did agree to him only, and could agree to
none other.

Q. What things did the Prophets chiefly bare witness unto, and deliver as
their Message?

A. The coming of Christ in the Flesh, his Prophetical, Priestly, and Kingly
Office, the Promises of Salvation, and Remission of Sin through Faith in him,
with the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and the saving Gifts and Graces thereof, Acts
26.22, 23.

SECT. VI.
Q. HOW did Christ perform the Office of a Priest?

A. By dying for our Sins, and offering up himself a Sacrifice by his Death, to
satisfy the Justice of God, and thereby to reconcile us unto God, and by his
continual Mediation and Intercession for us in Heaven, 1 Cor. 15.3. Ephesians. 5.2.
Heb. 9.26. Heb. 7.25.

Q. Why was it necessary that he should dye for our Sins?

A. Because Death was the punishment due to us for our Sins, which he, being
our Surety, did undergo for us; and the nature of an expiatory Sacrifice
required, that he should be slain, and his Blood should be shed.

Q. What Blood is that which Christ has redeemed us with, and by which we are
justified, cleansed and sanctified?

A. The real Blood of his Body that was outwardly shed, at his passion, on the
Tree of the Cross.

Q. Was the Priesthood of Christ foretold by any of the Prophets?

A. Yea, by David, in the Hundred and Tenth Psalm and fourth verse, The Lord
has sworn and will not repent, thou art a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedeck.

Q. What places in the New Testament hold forth Christ to be a Priest and our
High Priest?

A. Many places in the Epistle to the Hebrews, as Heb. 2.17. Heb. 3.1. 4.14.
15.5. 1.5. 10.7. 26.8. 1.3. 9.11. 25.10. 21.

Q. Were not the High Priests under the Law, Types of Christ our High Priest
under the Gospel?

A. Yea.

Q. Were not the Sacrifices under the Law, and the Passover Types of Christ,
the only effectual Sacrifice for the Remission of our Sins, and Justification
and Sanctification by his Blood?

A. Yea.

Q. Did Moses and the Prophets foretell of Christ's Death, and Sufferings, and
that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and give Light to
the Gentiles?

A. Yea, Acts 26.22, 23.

Q. What is the first promise that was given to Men, concerning Christ, and
Salvation by him?

A. That in Genesis 3.15. that the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Head of the
Serpent, and he should bruise his heel.

Q. Why is Christ called the Seed of the Woman?

A. Because he was made of a Woman, and born of her, without the knowledge of a
Man.

Q. What is meant by the Serpents bruising his heel?

A. The Death and Sufferings of Christ, who was put to death, by the
Instigation of the Devil, that moved the Jews and Pontius Pilate against him.

Q. What is meant by the Woman's Seed bruising the Serpent's Head?

A. His complete and perfect Victory over him, first in his own Person by his
Resurrection from the dead on the third day, and next by what shall in due time
be accomplished in all the Faithful who are his Members, by his victorious
Power, in destroying his Kingdom of Sin in them, and delivering them, from all
the effects of Sin, at the Resurrection of the dead, Heb. 2.14. 1 John 3.8.

Q. Is Christ Jesus, as he outwardly came in the Flesh the Seed that was
promised by God, to Abraham, that in him all Nations of the Earth should be
Blessed?

A. Yea, Genesis 22.18. 26.4. 28.14. Acts 3.25. Gal. 3.16.

Q. How is that promise fulfilled?

A. That whoever of all Nations should believe in him, should be blessed with
the Remission of their Sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the saving
gifts thereof, be justified and adopted to be God's Children, sanctified, and
in the end eternally glorified, Acts 10.43. Acts 13.38. 39.26. 18. Joh. 1.12.
13.7. 38.39.

Q. How is Christ a Priest for ever?

A. Because the efficacy, merit and worth of his being a Sacrifice for our
Sins, by that one offering, did extend to the Faithful, from the beginning of
the world, and will extend to them, to the end of it, for Remission of Sin and
Eternal Salvation, and that he continually appears before God, ever living to
make Intercession for us, Acts 15.11. Heb. 11.13. 7.25.

SECT. VII.
Q. HOw does Christ perform his Kingly Office?

A. By his various Administrations of it in the several parts thereof.

Q. Has Christ a Kingly Power and Government over the Angels both good and bad?

A. Yea.

Q. How has he a Kingly Power and Government over the evil Angels, and Devils,
and evil Men?

A. By restraining and limiting their Power, overruling their evil designs and
actions, and causing them to turn to his Glory, and to the Good of the
Faithful, and lastly by Judging and Punishing them at the last day, Psalm.
103.19. Psalm. 76.10. Romans 8.28. Matthew. 25.41, 46.

Q. What Acts of Kingly Power did Christ show forth on Earth before his Passion?

Devils, and wrought Miracles by his own Power, and forgave Sins, Matthew. 8.27.
Mark 1.27. Matthew. 9.6.

Q. What places in the Old Testament did foretell of his Kingly Office and
Government?

A. Diverse, such as Psalm. 2.6. I have set my King upon my holy Hill of Sion,
Isaiah 9.6, 7. and 32.1, 2. Dan. 7.13, 14.

Q. Was his rising from the Dead, and ascending into Heaven, and his being set
down at the right Hand of God, Acts of his Kingly Office and Power?

A. Yea, John 10.18. Ephesians. 4.8. 9. Psalm. 110.1. 2.

Q. How does he perform his Kingly Office over the Heirs of Salvation, and his
Church?

A. By Converting them, and giving his holy Spirit to Renew and Sanctify them,
with the saving Gifts and Graces thereof, giving them Faith and Repentance,
Justifying and Adopting them to be the Children of God, and his Members, giving
them his Laws and Writing them in their Hearts, protecting and preserving them
in this world, receiving their Souls and Spirits after Death, to be with him,
and raising their dead Bodies from Death to eternal Life, and Immortality at
the Resurrection of the Dead, and placing them in those heavenly Mansions he
has prepared for them in the Heavens, Isaiah 53.10, 11. Isaiah 60.5. Acts 5.31.
John 4.14, 7, 38, 39. Jer. 31.31. John 10.28, 29. Acts 7.59. John 6.40. John

Manhood-nature?

A. Yea, Acts 3.20, 21. Phil. 3.20.

Q. When will the time be that he will so come?

A. Of that Day and Hour knows no Man, nor the Angels in Heaven, Matthew.
24.36, 42, 44.

Q. Why has not God pleased to reveal the particular time of it?

A. That we may not be sloathful, but continually watching and preparing for
our Lord's coming. Matthew. 24.42.

SECT. VIII.
Q. CAN any Men be saved, whether Jews or Gentiles, simply by the Works of the
Law?

A. Nay, Gal. 2.16.

Q. Why can they not?

A. Because the Law does require perfect and perpetual Obedience from every Man
in his own Person; but this no Man ever did (the Man Christ Jesus excepted) nor
ever can do, for all have sinned, and, fallen short of the Glory of God, and by
the Law, both inwardly writ in the Heart, and outwardly written in the Book,
every Mouth is stopped, and the whole World is guilty before God, Romans 3.19. 20.

Q. Were none ever saved, nor can be saved by the Terms of the Covenant of
Works, do and live?

A. Nay, Romans 4.15.

Q. By what Covenant then are they saved who are the Heirs of Salvation?

A. By the Covenant of Grace, Romans 11.6.

Q. With whom is the Covenant of Grace made?

A. It is made originally with Christ, the second Adam (as the first Covenant
of Works was made with the first Adam) and through him the Mediator of it, with
all his elect Members, whom God the Father had chosen in him, before the
Foundation of the World, to be Holy, and without Blame before him in love,
Psalm. 89.28. Isaiah 59.21. Psalm. 40.6, 7. Heb. 12.24. Ephesians. 1.4.

Q. When was this Covenant made betwixt God the Father, and Jesus Christ the
Son?

A. It was designed in the Counsel and Purpose of God, before all Ages, but the
Administration of it began in time after Man's Fall, 2 Timothy 1.9. 10.

Q. What was to be performed by Christ on his part, by Virtue of this Covenant?

A. To dye for us, and be a Sacrifice to God for our Sins, to Suffer in our
stead, and make Satisfaction to the Justice of God, to apply to us the Merits,
Virtue, and Efficacy of his Death and Sufferings, for the Remission of Sins, by
his giving us the holy Spirit, to work in us Faith, and Repentance, and all
other saving Graces and Virtues, to enable us by his Grace to perform sincere
Obedience to God's Commands, Ephesians. 2.10. Dan. 9.27. Heb. 7.22. 1 Pet. 3.18. Ephesians.
4.12, 16.

Q. What is required in the Covenant of Grace on our part, that we may partake
of the Benefits of Christ's Redemption and Mediation?

A. Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ, Acts 20.21.

Q. What is Repentance?

A. It is not only a real Sorrow and Grief for Sin, but a true and real
forsaking of it, the Hatred and Aversion of it, and a Sincere turning of the
Heart to God and Christ, and a true Resolution to keep God's Commandments, 2
Cor. 7.9, 10, 11. Prove. 28.13. Acts 3.19. Psalm. 119.104. Acts 11.23. Psalm.
119.106.

Q. What is the chief moving cause to true Gospel Repentance?

A. The having sinned against a most holy, and a most merciful and gracious
God, and such a merciful and gracious Redeemer and Savior our Lord Jesus
Christ, who suffered so great Sorrow and Grief for our Sins, Zach. 12.10.

Q. What is Faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ?

A. It is not only to assent to the Truth of his Doctrine, but a receiving,
relying, and resting upon him for Life and Salvation, and upon the Mercy and
Favor of God, through him, as held forth in the Doctrine, and especially in the
Promises of the Gospel, John 20.31. John 1.12. Isaiah 11.10. Isaiah 32.2. Jude
21. Matthew. 11.28. 2 Cor. 1.20.

Q. Does the Gospel contain not only Promises, but also Commands of God and of
Christ?

A. Yea, John 14.21. John 15.10.

Q. Does the Gospel and Covenant of Grace require holiness of Life, and good
Works?

A. Yea, Mathh. 5.16, 48. i These. 4.7. i Tim. 6.18.

Q. How does it require them? as any part of satisfaction to Divine Justice, or
by way of merit to our Justification before God, or to be the foundation and
cause of it.

A. Nay.

Q. How then does it require them?

A. As our duty, and to answer the great love of God, and of Christ, and the
great end of his coming into the world, and his dying for us, that we being
dead unto sin, might live unto righteousness, and that by them, and in the
performance of them we might please God, and find acceptance of him, through
Christ, and for his sake, and be thereby fitted for Communion with God, and
(being made like him) for the Inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven, 2 Cor.
5.14. Titus 2.14. 1 Pet. 2.24. 1 John 3.22. 1 John 1.7. Colloss. 1.12.

Q. Do then the good works and holy living of the Saints by sincere obedience
please God, and are they accepted of him and rewarded by him?

A. Yea, Heb. 11.5. 6. Colloss. 3.24. Rev. 22.12.

Q. How can that be, when they fall short of that perfection which the Law
requires?

A. Wherein they fall short, God does pardon them, for Christ's sake, and
accepts of them, in and through him, so far, as they are sincerely performed in
faith and love by the help of his holy Spirit, Micah 7.18. Ephesians. 4.32. Psalm.
103.12. 13.14.

Q. Are any justified before true faith and repentance is wrought in them?

A. Nay.

Q. How are Believers justified by the righteousness and obedience of Christ
wrought by him, without them, and imputed unto them? are they equally righteous
with him, or are they without all spot or sault before God, while they have
sinful imperfections in them?

A. Nay, 1 John 1.8.

Q. What then is the true sense of the imputation of Christ's righteousness
unto Believers?

A. That God for the sake of Christ's righteousness, freely pardons their
sins, gives them a right to eternal life, deals with, and accepts them as
righteous in his sight, owneth and favoreth them, in the relation of Children,
Mal. 3.17. Ephesians. 1.6. Isa. 63.8. 9.2 Cor. 6.18.

Q. How is Christ Jesus the object of faith, for remission of sin,
justification, regeneration and sanctification? Is it not as he is both God and
Man, and as being Man, as he dyed for us, and rose again, and is in Heaven, our
Advocate and Mediator with the Father?

A. Yea, Romans 8.34. Romans 10.8. 9.10.

Q. Is it not therefore a great error in them, who teach that it is sufficient
to our Salvation, to believe in Christ, only as he is God, and as he is the
word, and light, that lightens every Man that comes into the world, without all
knowledge of Christ crucified, and raised from the dead, and without all faith
in him as such?

A. Yea, Philip. 3.8.

Q. What is the nature of true saving faith, and how is it evidenced?

A. It is a lively operative faith, that works by love, and is fruitful in
good works, and is never alone, but is always accompanied with hope, charity,
temperance, justice, humility, meekness, patience, holy fear, and other
Evangelical Virtues, and fruits of the Spirit, Gal. 5.6. 22.

Q. How is faith wrought in God's ordinary way in Men?

A. By hearing the word and doctrine of the Gospel outwardly preached or read,
the Spirit of God inwardly operating with and by the word. Romans 20.14. 17. 1
Cor. 1.21. 24.

Q. Are such excluded from the possibility of having saving faith in Christ
Jesus, and of Salvation by him, who hear not the word outwardly preached,
either for want of the sense of hearing, or for want of all possible means to
hear it?

A. Nay, for although in God's ordinary way, it has pleased God to save Men by
the foolishness of Preaching, and that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by
the word of God, as outwardly taught by preaching or reading, yet God is
abundantly sufficient to work that faith in any, by his Spirit, who works
when, where, and how he pleases.

Q. But is not the neglect of hearing the word outwardly taught, and of using
other outward means of grace, where they can be had, such a heinous sin, that
if continued in, takes away all ground of hope of Salvation?

A. Yea, Heb. 2.1. 2.3. Heb. 6.12. Heb. 10.25.

SECT. IX.
Q. WHat use has that inward law of righteousness or illumination in all Men,
both good and bad, Believers and Unbelievers, Christians and Heathens, if no
promise be given of God, that any shall be eternally saved by that alone, and
by their obedience to it, without some degree of faith in Christ crucified
explicit or implicit?

A. It is of great use, both to the Unbeliever and Believer, to the Heathen and
Christian, Isaiah 40.3. Romans 2.12. 14.15. 16.

Q. What use has it to the Heathen and Unbeliever?

A. As a preparatory ministration in a lower degree, and kind of operation, for
convincing of moral duties, and the contrary Sins and Vices for restraining
them, from great immorality, for rendering them without excuse, and liable to
the judgment of Christ, according to which, they are to be judged, and lastly
for the government of the World, and preserving good order, equity, and justice
among Men: It being that whereby mainly God's providential Kingdom is
maintained, and administered in the World, according to Psalm 103.19. and his
kingdom rules over all.

Q. What use has it to true Believers and Christians?

A. It serves for a rule of life (together with the Scriptures) in things of
moral honesty, justice and temperance, and obedience to it, as a rule of moral
life is so necessary, that no Man can be saved, without sincere obedience to
it, and all transgressions against it, in any, are heinous sins, Mat. 7.12.

Q. What is the sum of the moral Law?

A. To love the Lord our God, with all our heart, with all our Soul, and with
all our mind, and to love our neighbor as our self, on these two Commandments
hang all the Law and the Prophets, Matthew. 22.37. 38.39. 40. Deuteronomy. 6.5. Lev.
19.18.

SECT. X.
Q. WHat are the Laws that God does write in the hearts of the faithful, as he
has promised in the new Covenant? Are they not the same contained in the holy
Scriptures, excepting the Ceremonial part, and some other Laws peculiar to the
Jews?

A. Yea, Jerem. 31.31.

Q. Are not many of these Laws belonging to the new Covenant, other, and
distinct from the Law writ in the hearts of all Mankind, commonly called the
Law of Nature, particularly such as respect the peculiar Doctrins and Precepts
of the Christian Religion, and the positive Institutions of Christ concerning
Baptism and the Supper, and Christian Discipline in the Church of Christ?

A. Yea.

Q. Does God write those Laws of the new Covenant in the hearts of his People,
without all use of outward means?

A. Nay, but in the use of them, 2 Cor. 3.3.

Q. What is the difference betwixt the writing of the Law, in the hearts of
Unbelievers, and Heathens, and that writing in the hearts of the faithful?

A. The former has it writ in hard and stony hearts, the other has it writ in
hearts of flesh that are made by the Lord soft and tender, as he has promised,
Ezekiel. 36.26. 2 Cor. 3.3.

Q. Of what service are the promises contained in the Scripture to the faithful?

A. Of exceeding great use and service, for by them through the operation of
the Spirit, true Believers are made partakers of the Divine nature, and have a
lively hope begot in them, that what God has promised, he will faithfully
perform, both in this life, and in the life to come, 1 Timothy 4.8. Heb. 13.5. 2
Pet. 1.4. 1 Pet. 4.8. 19.

Q. Is God and Christ in all Men, both Believers and Unbelievers?

A. God and Christ (as the word) and also the Spirit, are in all Creatures, as
to their essential presence, Psalm. 139.7. it being one of God's Attributes, to
be omnipresent, as well as omniscient, and omnipotent, and therefore they are
in all Men both Believers and Unbelievers, but in respect of their Operations
and Manifestations, the difference is great.

Q. What is the difference betwixt the manner of God and Christ, their
Operations and Manifestations, in Be^^^vers and Unbelievers?

A. Believers have special and peculiar Manifestations and Operations of God,
Christ, and the holy Spirit in them, which Unbelievers have not; and God, and
Christ, and the holy Spirit are in the Faithful by union, and communion, and
inhabitation, or indwelling by Faith and Love, but they are not so in
Unbelievers; hence it is that Unbelievers are said to be without God and Christ
in the world, without hope, strangers and aliens from the Commonwealth of
Israel, 1 Cor. 2.12. 14. Ephesians. 1.17. 18. 1 John 1.3. Ephesians. 3.17. 1 Cor. 6.17.
Phil. 2.1. Ephesians. 2.12.

Q. How is Christ the Saints hope of Glory, Col. 1.27. is it only as within
them, considered only as God, and as the Word, or is it, both as without out
them, as he is God-Man, their Prophet, Priest and King, Mediator and Advocate,
and Head, and also as within them, as he is the Word, Light and Life?

A. Christ is the Saints hope of Glory both ways considered, for Paul gave
thanks to God, for the hope laid up for the believing Colossians in Heaven,
Col. 1.3. 4.5. and surely that was without them, and not within them only; also
the hope of the Faithful, is said to be as an anchor of the Soul, sure and
steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil, whither the forerunner
is for us entered even Jesus, Heb. 6.18. 19. and that place whither Jesus our
High Priest is entered, is not any place within us (though he is spiritually
present in us) but Heaven without us, there to appear in the presence of God
for us, and that in the true nature of Man, Heb. 9.24.

SECT. XI.
Q IS Prayer and Thanksgiving with humble reverence, both of Soul and Body unto
God, a most necessary duty to be performed by us, both in private and public,
and that frequently?

A. Yea, Matthew. 6.6. Jer. 10.25. Matthew. 18.19. 20.

Q. Ought the Prayers of all true Christians and their Thanksgivings be offered
up to God, in the name of our blessed Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ
God-Man, and also to him, together with the holy Spirit?

A. Yea, John 14.1. 3.14. John 16.24.

Q. Are Angels and Saints to be prayed unto?

A. Nay, Rev. 19.10. Matthew. 4.9. Exodus 20.3.

Q. Are Images to be made use of in the worship of God?

A. Nay, Exodus 20.4. 5. Acts 17.25. 29.30.

Q. For whom are we to pray?

A. Not only for our selves, but for all Men, for the King and all in
Authority, and for the whole Church of God, and also for our Enemies, 1 Timothy
2.1. 2. Psalm. 51.18. Psalm. 137.5. Matthew. 5.44.

Q. How are we to pray, and give thanks so as to be accepted?

A. In Spirit and in Truth, in sincerity of Heart, in Faith, in Humility, in
Holy Fear, with the Understanding, with Love and Fervency of Heart, with
frequency and constancy, to all which we need the continual help of God's
Spirit and Grace to aid and assist us, John 4.23. Jam. 1.6. 5.16. 1 Thessalonians.
5.17. 1. Cor. 14.15. Heb. 12.28.

Q. What are the things for which we are chiefly to pray?

A. They are briefly contained in that excellent form of Prayer, which Christ
taught his Disciples saying, Our Father, etc.

Q. Does the Spirit of God teach us to pray, without all outward means of
instruction, or use of the holy Scriptures.

A. Nay.

Q. May we not therefore be taught in words what to pray, as well as what to
believe?

A. Yea, Hos. 14.2. Luke 11.1. 2.

Q. Ought not great care be taken by all, to have their hearts in some prepared
frame in order to Prayer?

A. Yea, Eccles. 5.1. 2.

Q. How is that preparation obtained?

A. By getting the mind freed from worldly and vain thoughts, and also by
meditation on spiritual things and matters, as the Spirit of God is pleased to
assist us, who is never wanting to them who sincerely desire, and wait for his
assistance, Jer. 4.14. Psalm. 119.113. Psalm. 39.3.2 Cor. 3.5.

Q. Is it necessary for the best of Men, to confess their sins and pray for the
forgiveness of them.

A. Yea, 1 John 1.9. Jam. 3.2.

Q. Ought not the first day of the week, (on which our Lord rose from the dead)
be solemnly set apart for the worship and service of God both in public and
private, with abstinence from worldly affairs, and servile labor?

A. Yea, Matthew. 28.1. Acts 20.7. 1 Cor. 16.2. Rev. 1.10.

Q. Ought not also times of thanksgiving to be observed by the Faithful, to
give solemn thanks to God for solemn and extraordinary mercies and deliverances:

A. Yea.

Q. Is fasting at times a Christian Duty?

A. Yea, as it is a help to mortify the flesh, and to prepare and dispose us,
for more solemn humiliation, and confession of Sin, and Prayer either in
private or public, when some more than ordinary occasion requires it, Matthew.
6.17. 18. Acts 13.2. 3. Jonah 3.5. Exodus 15.1. Jer. 30.18. 19. John 10.22. Rev.
15.3. 4.

SECT. XII.
Q. WHat is the Catholick-Church?

A. The whole multitude of the Faithful, every where, in all Ages, having one
Faith, one Lord, one Baptism, who are one Body, (tho many Members consisting
of superiors, as Teachers, Pastors, Elders and Inferiors, to wit the several
Congregations of Believers) having one Spirit and one hope of their calling,
and one God and Father, over all, through all, and in them all, Ephesians. 4.4. 5.6.

Q. What are the best marks of the true Church?

A. Purity of Doctrine, the due observation and practice of all the
Institutions and Ordinances of Christ under the Gospel, and holiness of life
and conversation.

Q. Ought any Men to be received, or owned to be Members of the Church of
Christ, who do not give some proof of their Christian Faith by Confession of
the mouth, and good conversation before they be received?

A. Nay, Acts 8.36. 37.

Q. Wherein does the Communion of the Faithful consist?

A. Inwardly in the Gifts and Graces of God, and the Communion of the holy
Spirit, and outwardly in the profession of the same Faith, and jointly
worshipping God together, and practicing Christ's Institutions; particularly
these of Baptism and the Supper, also in mutual acts of Piety and Charity,
Philem. 5.6 7. Ephesians. 4.16. Phil. 22. Matthew. 25.35.

Q. Are the Infant Children of Believers, by virtue of God's promise, within
the Covenant of grace, together with their Parents?

A. Yea, Acts 2.39. Gal. 4.28. Genesis 17.7. 1 Cor. 7.14.

Q. How does it appear, that Baptism with Water is an Institution and
Ordinance of Christ?

A. From his Command to the Apostles, Matthew. 28.19. Go therefore and teach all
Nations Baptising them, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, and the general practice of it, in the Apostles days.

Q. But some say, it was not outward Baptism with Water that is there
commanded, but the inward Baptism with the Spirit?

A. That is a great error, they might as well say, it was not outward teaching,
with audible words, that was there commanded, but inward teaching by the
Spirit; we find not any where in Scripture, a command or power given to Men, to
Baptize with the Spirit, that power only belonging to God, and to Christ, but
we find a promise given by God, that Christ should Baptize with the Holy Ghost,
as was accordingly fulfilled, John 1.33.

Q. What is the chief end and use of Baptism with Water?

A. It is a Seal of Gods receiving us into the Covenant of Grace, a badge or
token of our Christian Profession, a means of Grace, a sign of our washing from
sin, and the forgiveness of our sins, and of our regeneration, and translation
from being Aliens and Strangers to be Members of Christ and of his Church;
therefore it is, that Baptism, (by a figure of the sign receiving the name of
the thing signified) is called regeneration, Titus 3.5.

Q. Seeing Baptism is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, are not all baptized
Persons, solemnly engaged by their Baptism, to deny themselves and take up
their Cross daily, and follow Christ by obeying his most holy Commands, and
walking after his most holy example, renouncing the World, the Flesh, and the
Devil, giving up and resigning themselves wholly, to follow Christ the Captain
of our salvation, and manfully to fight the good fight under his Banner?

A. Yea, Matthew. 16.24. Heb. 5.9. 1 Pet. 2.21. 1 Timothy ^ 12.

Q. What proof is there in Scripture, for the practice of the Supper, by the
outward Elements of Bread and Wine with Prayer and Thanksgiving?

A. The Command of Christ, Matthew. 26.26, 27, 28. and practice of Believers in
obedience to that Command.

Q. But some say, Christ did Command it, but until he should come again, and
now that they witness him come, the substance and thing signified they need not
the sign or shadow?

A. That is also a great error in them, to expound it only of his inward
coming. The Bread and the Wine in the Supper were real signs of his Body
outwardly broken, and his Blood outwardly shed, and did respect the Man Christ,
who is not come again, since he ascended.

Q. What is the chief end and use of the Supper?

A. It is another Seal of the Covenant of Grace, a sign of our being
spiritually nourished by Christ as by Meat and Drink, that we eat his Flesh,
and drink his Blood, by Faith, that so we may receive of his Spirit still more,
to quicken, refresh, and nourish us, a memorial of his Death and Suffering, a
Pledge of his Love, a means of Grace, and of preserving the Doctrine and Faith
of him in the World, also a testimony and sgnification of our Communion with
the Faithful, 1 Cor. 11.25, 26. 1 Cor. 10.16. 17.

Q. How ought Persons to be prepared for the receiving the Lords Supper?

A. By serious examination, of the sincerity of their Faith, and whither they
are in true Charity, also with earnset Prayer, and true spiritual hunger and
thirst, to enjoy and feed upon Christ in that Divine Institution, 1 Cor. 11.28.
2 Cor. 13.5.

Q. By whom are Baptism and the Supper to be administered?

A. By such as are duly called and authorized by Christ, who are true Pastors
and Stewards of the mysteries of God, Ephesians. 4.11. 1 Cor. 4.1.

Q. What is the Eternal Life, that all the Faithful hope to attain unto,
according to God's promise?

A. It is their full enjoyment of God and Christ, together with the holy
spirit, by vision, love and delight, with the complete glorification of their
Souls and Bodies, and the blessed Society of all the holy Angels, and glorified
Saints in the Kingdom of Heaven eternally and without all end. Luke 20.36
Matthew. 5.8. 1 Cor. 13.12. 1 John 3.2. Rev. 22.4. Phil. 3.21. Heb. 12.22.

FINIS.
The CREED.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth;

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, Who was Conceived by the Holy
Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
dead, and buried. He descended into Hell; the third day he rose again from the
dead, he ascended into Heaven, and sits at the Right Hand of God the Father
Almighty: From thence he shall come to Judge the Quick and the Dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Holy Catholic Church, The Communion of
Saints, The Forgiveness of Sins, The Resurrection of the Body, And the Life
Everlasting. Amen.

The Ten Commandments.
I. THou shall have none other Gods before me. II. Thou shall not make thee any
graven Image, or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is
in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water under the Earth. Thou shall not
Bow down thy self to them, nor serve them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous
God, visiting the iniquties of the Fathers upon the Children unto the third and
fourth Generation of them that hate me, and showing Mercy unto thousands of
them that love me, and keep my Commandments. III. Thou shall not take the Name
of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that
takes his Name in vain. IV. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days
shall thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh
