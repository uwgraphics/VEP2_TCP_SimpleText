Commons Assembled in Parliament, concerning the Papers of the Scotts
Commissioners, etc. Martij 13.

Printed Anno Dom. 1647.

HIstory informs us. That when a dumb Son of Craesus King of Lydia, saw one
ready to stab his father, he conquered the natural impediments of speech, and
distinctly cried out Kill not the King That which wrought this Wonder, was the
power of natural affection by the operation of an extraordinary Sympathy:
surely those are justly chargeable, with a more then brutish, (even insensate)
want of affection, and Sympathy who will not now use, what Nature ordinarily
affords unto all; (Speech,) to rescue the father of their Country the Kings
Majesty, from the killing wounds ready to be given unto him: This duty puts the
Pen into my hands; and without the Paint of Apology, makes me (in the absence
of an entrusted, and my far more able countryman) to show unto you, how
dangerously the States Empetiques practice upon the body politic of Great
Britain, and make it as the (Evil one) their work to propogate the sin of
their Rebellion: unto all others, especially unto my dear Countrymen, and these
poisonous pills, are gilded With the pretense of undeceiving the people of
both Kingdoms: This work begets in them, A declaration of the Lords and
commons assembled in Parliament, concerning the Papers of the Scots
Commissioners, entitled the Answer of the Commissioners, etc. And horrid
impiety that what men themselves wilfully reject, they should envy unto
others; Repentance, The Scots through misprison of zeal (as Paul did Christ)
have persecuted their Sovereign, but now are divinely converted, and will no
longer engage with the Parliament in this sin, as they have published unto the
world in their Answer, upon the New propositions of peace, and the four Bills
sent unto his Majesty, full of Honor, and Honesty, clear from all the cavills
of these desperate contrivers, and the ripe consultations of Men, of singular
Judgment, and exemplary integrity: who sincerely represented the sense of
their Nation; and therefore, ( although they are burdened with forgetfulness
of the work about which they came, with interpositions in things concerned
them not, and deviation from the trust of the Kingdom of Scotland) they
received as the Guerdon of true Patriots, and experienced Statesmen, before
their departure from this city, a public Instrument of thankful
approbation, from almost all the Nobles of Scotland, for their good carriage
and wise conduct of the affairs of that Kingdoms here: So that wherein they
quarrel the proceedings of the Commissioners they might have been pleased, to
intend the Kingdom of Scotland.

That which is first noted by them to disgust the Scots, was the alteration of
the Propositions sent to Newcastle from those of Oxford, in the management of
the Militia of the three Kingdoms, the War, of Ireland, the education and
marriage of the Kings children, etc. The concluding peace or war with foreign
Princes etc: Scotland, as well as of England, and was the prosecuting these
interests in the Kingdom of England, the Offensive exercise of an Interest in
that Kingdom; It were much to be wished this distinction, had been offered,
before the Scots Army left England: Surely these alterations the Post na^i
tells us, leaves them worse then you found them, and takes from them their
birthright of equal capacity with your Sects join with you in your
Rebellion at first, with much of your own, [as the Devil unto our Saviour] you
tendered more then was your own, and now your work is done, will you deny unto
them, what is their own in a word the sense of your Resolution, never to grant
them the exercize of interest in this kingdom, Scotland, will be further
claimed, and disputed with you: Yet the waving these interests for the time, by
the Scots, could not but be acknowledged to proceed from transparent
inclinations unto peace; but now, because by the progress of your unlimited
Usurpations upon his Majesty's royal Rights, (in which the Interests of the
Scotts are especially included) being better informed, they differ in Judgment
from your Propositions;

Are further results of Judgment, upon further and more clear Information no
ways to be permitted? This were to obstruct all passages, unto humare
certainty of knowledge, which is perfected by experience, (the Child of time:)

But these men (because they will complete their sins with Obstinacy) will
admit of no variation from their first principles (to unthrone the King!) and
now much wonder that the Scots will not arrive with them at that point of
Impiety: Because the Scots cannot grant that his Majesty* and royal succession,
should be divested of the power of the Militia, and conferring Titles of
Honor, (the Essential rights of Regality) for which they liberally affoard
them solid Reasons; the Parliament retrive nothing to procure further
satisfaction; but blow them of with, that they are the transcript of the Kings
Arguments about HVLL: which amounts unto this; That what comes from the King
(how consistent soever with Reason,) cannot be of force, or worthy the
Answering: It is no marvel the Kings reasons are no higher rated by them, when
that the word of God, can have but that Authority, and Acceptance with them,
it has with the Devil; but wherein they can force it unto a specious (though
false) Consistency, with their own ends, and Interests: And it cannot
certainly, without astonishment, and Horror, disbanding of the Army was
propounded by them, how they discover a Tyranny awed with continual fear, and
only supported by the power of an Army: Had Sir Thomas Fairfax his Army been
disbanded, then indeed (say they) they might have brought the King to London,
whether the Parliament would or no, and have brought the Parliament unto a
Personal Treaty with him, and therein unto what terms, he and they pleased:
This is the greatest crime they charge the Scotts Commissioners, with: A
Personal Treaty at London is first in their thoughts, and discourse: The
presence of the King at London might give him opportunity (say they) to caiole
the Citizens; i. e. to cozen and cheat them as themselves have done:) Their
diligence employes it self, (with Achan) to hide the Goulden wedge, and goodly
things they espied in this City, to convey it into their own stuff, and makes
the riches thereof serve unto their own ends, with which, It can no ways
stand, to admit King Charles unto Loudon: No the undeceived Citisens, would
have too many representations, in his Majesty's presence, of their sufferings,
occasioned by his absence. A Treaty there, say they (and contrary unto their
custom most truly,) would treat us out of what we have fought for, (i. e.
the Sovereign Dominion,) draw the whole guilt of this effusion of blood, upon
our selves, and tend unto the Apparent destruction of the Persons, (i. e.
themselves) that have engaged: This Proposition of the Scots Commissioners, is
too much for the Advantage of his Majesty, and indeed too honest for this
pack't party, the present partie-colourd Parliament, to yield unto: And
therefore, whilst he is at this distance of affection with them, (they say not
of Judgment,) for what good man can close with them? His local absence is
Necessary: But nothing more startles this Crew, then that the Scots, should now
vary from that, wherein they formerly concurred with them: Or what Reasons
they have thought on since, which they Judge more effectual then those,
(formerly.) I will assign them some few, of many; Natural affection and
Loyalty, quickened by the word of God and conscience informed; Honor, their own
Interest, and the perfidie and Irreligion of this present Parliament,

All which, by a joint and respective Influence upon them, now, powerfully
dispose them unto their duty of Subjection, and Christian Obedience, wherein
they are obliged unto their Dread Sovereign.

They were formerly decoyed into this Kingdom, under those winning pretenses,
of Reformation of Religion corrupted, and the preservation of the just
liberties of the subject encroached upon, and fearing the Inconveniences which
flow from these, might reach unto themselves, they willingly engaged in this
war: but now [contrary unto their Hope] finding the successes of their Arms,
to have been the fruitful parents, of infinitely more corruptions, in church
and common wealth, and that the intentions of these Reformers, (what ever they
pretended) never aimed at or were directed unto these good ends, but at the
subversion of Monarchy, and placing a supreme power in themselves, and the
driving on of particular ends and interests of their own; and an Arbitrary
Government; to support which, as they tolerate all Religions, and even the
most damnable Here^^es; So they do all illegal practices; and the most
unwarrantable, and violent actions of those who adhere unto them.

These things visible (unto all who have eyes) appearing unto the Scots, they
do now, [not without just resentment] reflect upon themselves, and are resolved
no more to partake with these men, in their sins, but to do their first works,
return unto their first love, and as [the Tribe of Judah did by King David,]
being bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, they will [by Gods assistance]
industriously endeavor to bring their natural King unto his own house; and
that with honor, safety, and freedom; maugre the opposers.

Nor will his Majesty be ever pressed by them to take the Covenant, having so
often protested his averseness thereunto, there being more reason herein [what
they upraid the Commissioners with,] to take the measure of their desires, from
what may please the King; then what they (with Jeroboam) do, to establish
their own throne, and new erected dominion, to set up so many Calves and
Idols, such multitudes of reidiculous teachers, and abominable Sects, and
Heresies: For what else is it to conive at and tolerate them, yea to
countenance them: yet this sect [forsooth] must be convinced by the word of
God, with Gentleness, and Reason, and not beaten out of it by force: Thus must
Anabaptists be dealt withal, yea pleaded for also, and supplied with a better
argument then ever they could find for themselves, That It is only a
difference in the circumstance of time, in the Administration of an Ordinance
It is admirable that Moses could not hit upon this distinction, unto the Angel
who was ready to kill him for his deferring the circumcision of his son
Eleazar equipollent unto baptism. Independents, also under which Notion,
Antinomians, Libertines, Brownists, Seperatists, must have indulgence granted
unto rhem, yea, and the chief places, of Honor, trust, and profit, in Church
and common wealth, conferred upon them; [how ever we are borne in hand with
the settlement of the Presbyteriall Government, the Comissioners would have the
King complied with and the conviction of his Judgment, and satisfaction,
expected: This must be in them a Coznage: Nor will such as have adhered unto
his Majesty in the late War, be [through the Scots procurement,] pressed unto
the Covenant, which has bin truly made an Hook only to draw the Kings party
into danger.

A mere Cobweb to catch flies in, the weakened Kings party, whilst the
stronger Reptilia (bred in their own intralls) can break through it when they
list: Surely an equal respect is due (nay a far greater) unto those of the
Kings Judgment, for the antiquity of their Reformation, and uniformity, then
unto your Independents, and Sectaries, so that (what you will not extend,)
Indulgence, to tolerate unto them, the use of the Common Prayer, will be left
unto his Majesty to give unto them: It being much more (in the apprehension of
the Scots) tolerable, that Prelacy* (some exercise of which Government, they
have seen in other Kingdoms embraceing the Reformation) should be restored,
then instead thereof such thick weeds of Heresies as now daiely spring up in
the Church, and are ready to choke the seed of Gods word* be permitted a full
growth. And herein they say much less, then that great Patron of Independencie
Mr. John Goodwin, the Bellweather of that Flock does, Sion Coll. visited.
That there was more of the power, and truth of Religion in England, under the
late Prelaticall Government, then in all the reformed Churches besides which
(they say not in others) in this Church is most true: But this Parliament likes
not, (as not likely to Thrive by it) uniformity in Religion, being certainly
(for the greater part of them,) of Kin unto that English man, our Country
man Barkely speaks of, who seperating from his Neigbours, first placed the true
Church in his own family, Icon Any.
and having several Sons, these afterward being different in Judgment,
there became at length, so many Churches and Religions, as there were persons
in the House, from which many of the Grandees at Westminster, are probably
extracted. And as unto that grand exception taken against the Commissioners,
for propounding that an act of oblivion, without any caution or limitation,
should be passed in both Kingdoms, whereby Delinquents shall be set upon an
even flower, with those that have engaged against them in that Cause: The Scots
conceive themselves obliged in the strictest points of honor, to advance what
they possibly may, the good of those high Noble and Loyal spirits, which no
obliquity of worldly respect, no distortion of danger or weight of sufferings,
has been able to divorce from his Majesty's service: And as they acknowledge
it their great unhappiness, that they have not had the Honor to be sharers
with them hitherto in this Glory; So now it is their ambition, to have part and
fellowship with them in this most noble work, and just undertaking, of
re-establishing his Sacred Majesty into his unquestionable Rights; In
pursuance whereof, (what the Parliament object unto the Scots Commissioners,
that through all these and many former Papers they plead the Cause of the King
and his Party) They will hence forward, England can yield unto, gnash they
never so much with their teeth; Such favorites are Delinquents now grown with
them, Edinburgh they may guess.

Nor can less be expected from the Scots, as on whom the Parliament of
England, has so notoriously imposed, as to have his Majesty left unto them,
by them, upon such terms and assurances of high regard unto his Majesty's
Person and Royal Rights: The contrary whereof, in every point they have unto
their eternal infamy) performed; which assurances though they evade and deny
them, shall be justified unto the world, by the publication of the
transactions, between the Commissioners of both Nations at New Castle, and
also by the Overtures ever sithence: His Majesty's Person and Royal Rights,
being of equal concernment unto the Scots with the English, although the
Parliament of England call these [exclusively] their own rights -- for which
they hold it not fit to capitulate: confidence in the Houses, the Scots doubt
not, in Gods mercy to bring them unto such an account, as shall leave the whole
reckoning of His Majesty's unparalleled sufferings upon themselves, who now
seem to have no way of Justification left, but by further progress in crimes:
So that it is not to be marveiled at, they seem so much to undervalue His
Majesty's Regal Power, of conferring titles of Honor, and labor to render
the Scots ridiculous, for that they are so extreme thirsty, to drink of the
Fountain of Honor, so they style the King, say they, because indeed the
Parliament of England (as to the overruling party thereof, many being led
aside by their fraud, and violence) have left off to be honest, Honor being
but the proper seat, and stall of honesty: Neither can it be presumed that
they desire to taste of this fountain, when they make it their work, to damme
and fill it up with the rubbish of their new Government, and yet unshapen
Tyranny, wholly trampling under their feet, all the Divine and Glorious
prerogatives, and Royal Privileges of Monarchy exercised in all ages by the
Kings of England and Scotland (The Sun in his greatest splendour, is not more
manifest then this) By their endeavor to take away His Majesty's Prerogative
in the settlement of Religion, His Legislative power, the Negative voice, the
Militia, the disposing of Offices, conferring of Honors, the disposing of his
Children, the election of his Servants, with many other rights that append unto
these; In which transcendent usurpations upon their own borne King, should the
Scots concur, they should most justly render themselves the shame of all
Nations, and the offscouring of the world: The perfidie of the leading party
in the present Parliament, has already given too great a stain unto their
Honor (by their dealing with His Majesty) which they will sooner wash off
with prodigal streams of the dearest and best blood of Scotland, then they
will suffer to remain or rest longer upon them; And whereas they lay an heavy
load upon the Commissioners of unthankfulness unto their Army, who showed
such tender fellow-f^^ling of their sufferings and their true-heartednesse
toward them* many blows they received, and with which they discharged their
scores in Scotland, and saved their heads (with the loss of many thausand of
their own lives) in England; They no ways being able to have matched, much
less to have mastred His Majesty's party without their conjuncture; No English
man all this while loosing one drop of blood for the Cause in Scotland; and as
the Scots have very dearly earned their whole pay (had it been more, and more
truly paid) with the vast expense of their blood, the impoverishment of their
County, and a bloody engagement against their own bowels, so has it cost
them most, by incurring the foreign censure of disloyalty; Into which the
Hypocrisy, and Avarice of the Parliament of England principally led them, and
to discharge themselves of this burden, now become intolerable, and to show
unto the world, that the present practices of the Parliament of England were
not the motives of their advance into the Kingdom; they resolve (with Gods
leave) to manifest the contrary, and speedily to come nearer unto them, to
debateface to face the Royal Rights of His Majesty, so eluded by them, with
such demonstrations (as by Gods help) will be of force manifestly to prove by
their power, what by their Commissioners they have propounded in their Papers.

Reader, take this for the first light skirmish of a reply unto the
Declaration, until the maine battle of more manifest Demonstrations, for the
truth of what is here set forth in the behalf of the Answer of the Scots
Commissioners, can be drawn up and rallied.

FINIS.
