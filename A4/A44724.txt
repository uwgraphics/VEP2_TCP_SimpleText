LONDON, Printed by T. B. for Humprey Mosley, at the Princes Arms, in Paul's
Churchyard. 1642.

To the growing Glory OF Great Britain, Prince CHARLES.
A parallel 'twixt His Highness, and the Black Prince.
SIR,
Wales had one Glorious Prince of hair and hue (Which color sticks unto Him
still) like You:
He traveled far, He won His spurs in France,
And took the King, the KING, o monstrous chance
Then His victorious troops afresh He getherss
And with the gray Goose-wing his shaftsnew feathers,
He beats a march up the Pyrene Hills,
And the Cantabrian clime with terro^fils,
To re-inthrone Don Pedro Castile's King,
Of which heroique Act all Stories ring.
Your Royal Sire traveled so far, and They
Of all our Princes only made that way.
Who knows, Great Sir, but by just destiny,
Your bunch of (Youthful) Plumes may further fly?
But Faulcon-like, You may with full summed wing
The Eagle cuff, and from his tallons wring
The Palatinat.
Prey, or in exchange seize on his Ore,
And fix Your Standard on the Indian shore.
'Twas by Carolus Magnus.
^ Charles, France once the Empire got,
'Twas by a Carol Quintus.
Charles the Spaniard d^^ue that los,
Why may not Britain challenge the next call,
And by a CHARLES be made Imperial?

INSTRVCTIONS FOR Foreign Travel.
SECTION. I.
AMongst those many advantages, which conduce to enrich the mind with
Knowledge, to rectify the Judgment, and compose outward manners; Foreign
Travel is none of the least.

But to be a Sedentary Traveller only, penned up between Walls, and to stand
poring all day upon a Map, upon imaginary Circles and Scales, is like him, who
thought to come to be a good Fencer, by looking on Agrippa's book-postures
only: As also to run over and traverse the world by Hearesay, and traditionall
relation, with other men's eyes, and so take all things upon courtesy, is but a
confused and imperfect kind of speculation, which leaves but weak and
distrustful notions behind it; in regard the Ear is not so authen^^q^e a
witness as the Eye; because the Eye, by which as through a clear crystal
Casement, we discern the various works of Art and Nature, and in one instant
comprehend half the whole Universe in so small a room after so admirable a
manner, I say the Eye having a more quick and immediate commerce and familiarity
with the Soul (being the principal of her Cinq ports, and her Centinell)
takes in far deeper Ideas, and so makes firmer and more lasting impressions,
conveying the object more faithfully to the memory, where it remains afterward
upon record in particular topicall notes, and indelible characters: For though
I confess with the Stagirite, that Hearing is the sense of Learning (and of
Faith also, as the holy Text tells me) yet the Sight surpasses it by many
degrees, if you respect the curious workeman-ship of the Organ, the readiest
road to the heart, and love's best Intelligencer and Usher: As also for the
penetrative apprehension of the object, with the intuitive virtue and force of
affection, it works inwardly, as we find upon good record that a heard of
Sheep conceived once by the strength of the Eye, as likewise for the
wonderful quickness of this Sense, which is such that i^ makes the effect
oftentimes fore-run the cause, as we see the Lightning, before we Hear the
Thunder, though thunder be first in Nature, being by the violent eruption it
makes out of the Cloud, the cause of such fulgurations. And although one should
read all the Topographers that ever writ of, or anatomized a Town or Country,
and mingle Discourse with the most exact observers of the Government thereof,
and labor to draw and draine out of them all they possibly know or can
remember* Yet one's own Ocular view, and personal conversation will still find
out something new and unpointed at by any other, either in the carriage or the
Genius of the people, or in the Policy and municipall customs of the Country,
or in the quality of the Clime and Soil, and so enable him to discourse more
knovvingly and confidently and with a kind of Authority thereof; It being an
Act of parliament in force amongst all Nations: That one Eyewitness is of more
validity than ten Aur^cular.

Moreover as every one is said to abound with his own sense, and that among
the race of mankind, Opinions and Francies, are found to be as various as the
several Faces and Voices; So in each individual man there is a differing
faculty of Observation, of Judgment, of Application, which makes that every
one is best satisfied, and most faithfully instructed by himself, I do not
mean soley by himself, (for so he may have a fool to his Master) but Books
also, and conversation with the Dead must concur, for they are likewise
good Teachers, and edify infinitely; yet the study of living men, and a
collation of his own Optique observations and judgment with theirs, work
much more strongly, and where these meet (I mean the living and the dead) they
perfect.

And indeed this is the prime use of Peregrination, which therefore may be not
improperly called a moving Academy, or the true Peripatetique School: This
made Ulisses to be cried up so much amongst the Gre^ks for their greatest wise
man, because he had Traveled through many strange Countries, and observed the
manners of diverse Nations, having seen, as it was said and sung of him, more
Cities than there were Houses in Athens, which was much in that age of the
World: and the Greatest of their Emperors did use to glory in nothing so
often, as that he had surveyed more Land with his Eye, than other Kings could
comprehend with their thoughts.

Amongst other people of the Earth, Islanders seem to stand in most need of
Foreign Travel, for they being cut off (as it were) from the rest of the
Citizens of the World, have not those obvious accesses, and contiguity of
situation, and other advantages of society, to mingle with those more refined
Nations, whom Learning and Knowledge did first Vrbanize and polish. And as all
other things by a kind of secret instinct of Nature follow the motion of the
Sun, so is it observed that the Arts and Sciences which are the greatest helps
to Civility, and all Moral endowments as well as Intellectual, have wheeled
about and traveled in a kind of concomitant motion with that great Luminary of
Heaven: They budded first amongst the Brachma^s and Gymnosophists in India,
then they blossomed amongst the Chaldeans and Priests of Egypt whence they came
down the Nile, and crossed over to Greece, and there they may be said to have
borne ripe fruit, having taken such firm rooting, and making so long a
Plantation in Athens and else where: Afterward they found the way to Italy,
and thence they clammer'd over the Alpian hills to visit Germany and France,
whence the Britains with other North-west Nations of the lower World fetched
them over; and it is not improbable that the next Flight they will make, will
be to the Savages of the new discovered World* and so turn round, and by this
circular perambulation visit the L^vantines again.

Hence we see what a Traveller^ Learning has been having in conformity of
course, been a kind of companion to Ap^llo himself: And as the Heavenly bodies
are said to delight in movement and perpetual circumgyration, wherein as
Pythagoras, goras, who by the Delphian Oracle was pronounced, the wisest man
that ever Greece bredd, did hold, there was a kind of Music and Harmonious
concent that issued out of this regular motion, which we cannot perceive,
because being borne in it, it is connaturall to us, so it is observed to be the
Genius of all active and generous Spirits, Queis meliore luto finxit praecordia
Titan,

To have been always transported with a desire of Travel, and not to be
bounded, or confined within the shoares and narrow circumference of an Island,
without ever-treading any piece of the Continent; whereas on the other side,
mean and vulgar spirits, whose Souls sore no higher than their Sense, love to
hover ever about home, lying still as it were at dead anchor, moving no further
than the length of the cable, whereunto they are tied, not daring to lance out
into the maine, to see the wonders of the deep: Such a one was he of whom
Claudian speaks, to have had his birth, breeding, and burial in one Parish;
such slow and sluggish spirits may be said to be like Snailes or Tortuises in
their shells, crawling always about their own home, or like the Cynique, shut up
always in a Tub.

Amongst other Nations of the World the English are observed to have gained
much, and ^mproved themselfes infinitely by voyaging both by Land and Sea, and
of those four Worthies who compassed about the Terrestrial Globe, I find the
major part of them were English, but the scope of this Discourse is to prescribe
precepts for Land Travel only (for the other requires another Tract apart) and
first, A Jove principium --
Sic feret antennas aura secundatuas.


SECT. II.
IT is very requisite that he who exposes himself to the hazard of Foreign
Travel, should be well grounded and settled in his Religion, the beginning
and basis of all Wisdom, and somewhat versed in the Controversies 'twixt us and
the Church of Rome, which I presume he has done in the University, where (I
take it for granted, he has been matriculated, and besides his initiation in
the Arts and Sciences, and learned to chop Logic (and Logic though she be no
Science of her self, but as she is subservient to another, Like the Shoomakers
Last, that may be applyable to any foot, yet no Science can be rightly
studied without her method, nor indeed can the terms of Art be well
understood, or any Schollerlike discourse framed but by her) where I say,
besides these studies, he has sucked the pure milk of true Religion, and
Orthodoxall truth, and such a one will be rather confirmed, than shaken in the
tenets of his Faith, when he sees the sundry fond fantastique forms, which
have crept into the solemn service of God, since the primitive times, for the
practice of the Roman Church is worse than her positions, so that I have known
some, who were wrought upon very far by the one, averted again by the other, I
mean by her Ceremonies, which in some places are so mimicall, and set forth in
such antique postures, that it may be not improperly said, whereas Religion
should go arrayed in a grave Matron-like habit, they have clad her rather like
a wanton Courtisane in light dresses: Such a one, I mean he that is well
instructed in his own Religion, may pass under the torrid Zone, and not be
Sunburned, if he carry this bon-grace about him, or like the River Danube which
scorns to mingle with the muddy stream of Sava, though they run both in one
Channel, or like Arethusa, which Travelleth many hundred miles through the
very bowels of the Sea, yet at her journeys end issues out fresh again,
without the least mixture of saltness or brackishnesse: So such a one may
pass and repasse through the very midst of the Roman See, and shoot the most
dangerous Gulphe thereof, and yet return home an untainted Protestant; nay he
will be confirmed in zeal to his own Religion, and illuminated the more with
the brightness of the truth thereof, by the glaring lights and specious
glosses, which the other uses to cast; For Opposita juxta se posita magis
elucescunt: Nay the more he is encompassed with the superstitions, of the
contrary, the more he will be strengthened in his own Faith; like a good Well
uses to be hotter in Winter than Summer, per Antiperistasin, that is, by the
coldness of the circumambient air, which in a manner besieges it round, and
so makes the intrinsique heat, unite and concentre it self the more strongly
to resist the invading Enemy.

After Religion, it is fitting he should be well versed in the Topography,
Government and History of his own Country, for some are found Foris sapere, and
domi caecutire, to be Eagles abroad, and stark Buzzards at home, being not able
to satisfy a stranger by exchange of discourse, in any thing touching the State
of their own Country.

To this end it were not amiss to run over Cambden, Sir John Smiths
Commonwealth, with those short pieces of Story, as Daniel and others who have
written of the English Kings since the Conquest, and extract out of them, what
traverses of war, what other passages and entercourses of State have happened
'twixt us and other Nations since the last Conquest, specially the French our
nearest neighbors: It is also very behooffull, that he have a passable
understanding of the Latin tongue, whereof the Italian, the Spanish, and
French, are but as it were branches of the same Tree; they are but Dialects or
Daughters, and having gained the good will of the Mother, he will quickly
prevayle with the Daughters.

That he understand the use of the Map and Globe, to find out the Longitude
and Latitude of all places, and to observe and compare the temper of them as
he shall pass along.

Lastly that he seriously contemplate within himself, how the eyes of all the
World are upon Him, as his are upon the World, what his parents, kindred and
acquaintance, yea his Prince will expect at his return: That he is now in the
very forge of his hopes, either upon making or marring: That (being of Noble
extraction) he is like to be a Star of the greatest Magnitude in the Sphere of
his own Country, therefore common qualities will not serve his turn, that
the higher the building is, the more it requires exquisit form and symmetry,
that Nobility without inward ornaments is as fair gilded shells without
kernels, or like a satin doublet with canvas linings, whereas on the Other
side Virtue reflecting upon a Noble subject, is as the Sunbeams falling upon
a rock of Cristall, which makes the reverberation stronger and far more
resplendent, or as rich goldembrodery, upon a piece of Tissue: Such thoughts as
these will work much upon an ingenious Spirit, and be as a golden Spur, to
set him forward, and cheer him in this high road of Virtue, and Knowledge.

SECT. III.
THe first Country that is most requisite for the English to know, is France,
in regard of neighboured, of conformity in Government in diverse things and
necessary intelligence of State, and of the use one shall have of that Language
wheresoever he pass further: And the younger one goes to France the better,
because of the hardness of the accent and pronunciation, which will be hardly
overcome by one who has passed his minority, and in this point the French
Tongue may be said to be like Fortune, who, being a woman, loves youth best.
Whereas for other Tongues, one may attain to speak them to very good purpose,
and get their good will at any age; the French Tongue by reason of the huge
difference 'twixt their writing and speaking, will put one often into fits of
despair and passion, as we read of one of the Fathers, who threw away Persius
against the walls, saying, si non vis intelligi debes negligi, but the Learner
must not be daunted awhit at that, but after a little intermission he must
come on more strongly, and with a pertinacity of resolution set upon her again
and again, and woe her as one would do a coy Mistres, with a kind of
importunity, until he over-master her.

Indeed some of riper plants are observed to overact themselves herein, for
while they labor to trencher le mot, to cut the word, as they say, and speak
like natural Frenchmen, and to get the true genuine tone (and every tongue
has a tone or tune peculiar to her self, specially the French, which has a
whining kind of querulous tone specially amongst the peasantry, which I believe
proceeded from that pitiful slavery they are brought unto) I say while they
labor for this, they fall a lisping and mincing, and to distort and strain
their mouths and voice, so that they render themselves fantastique and
ridiculous; let it be sufficient for one of riper years, to speak French
intelligibly roundly, and congruously without such forced affectation.

The French tongue like the Nation, is a bold and hardy speech, therefore the
learner must not be bashful or meal mouthed in speaking any thing, whatsoever
it is, let it come forth confidently whither true or false Sintaxis; for a bold
vivacious spirit has a very great advantage in attaining the French, or indeed
any other Language: He must be cautelous not to force any Anglicismes upon the
French Tongue, that is certain vulgar Phrases, Proverbs, and Complements,
which are peculiar to the English, and not vendible or used in French, as I
heard of one that could not forbear a great while to salute his Landlord by
bon matin: Another would be always complaining at play of his mauvaise
Fortune: Another when at the racket court he had a ball struck into his hazard,
he would ever and anon cry out, estes wous la avec vos Ours, Are you there
with your Bears? which is ridiculous in any other language but English, for
every speech has certain Idiomes, and customary Phrases of its own, and the
French, of all other, has a kind of contumacy of phrase, in respect of our
manner of speaking, proper to it self.

He must always have a Diary about him, when he is in motion of Iourneys, to
set down what his Eyes meets, with most remarquable in the day time, out of
which he may raise matter of discourse at night, and let him take it for a rule,
that He offend less who writes many toys, than he, who omits one serious
thing. For the Pen makes the deepest furrows, and does fertilize, and
enrich the memory more than any thing else, Littera scripta manet, sed manant
lubrica verba.

It were very requisite to have a book of the Topographicall description of all
places, through which he passes; and I think Bertius, or the Epitome of
Ortelius, which are small and portable, would be the best. At his first
coming to any City he should repair to the chief Church (if not Idolatrous)
to offer up his sacrifice of thanks, that he is safely arrived thither, and
then some have used to get on the top of the highest Steeple, where one may
view with advantage, all the Country circumjacent, and the site of the City,
with the advenues and approaches about it; and so take a Landscape of it.

Being come to France, his best course will be to retire to some University
about the Loire, unfrequented by the English, for the greatest bane of English
Gentlemen abroad, is too much frequency and communication with their own
Contrymen, and there let him apply himself seriously to gain the
practical knowledge of the Language, and for the time hoc agere. This he may
do with more advantage, if he repaires sometimes to the Courts of Pleading,
and to the Public Schools; For in France they presently fall from the
Latin, to dispute in the vulgar tongue: So that it were not amiss for him to
spend some time in the New Academy; erected lastly by the French Cardinal in
Richelieu, where all the Sciences are read in the French tongue, which is done
of purpose to refine, and enrich the Language.

Some have used it as a prime help to advance Language, to have some ancient
Nun for a Divota, with whom he may chat at the grates, when he has little
else to do, for the Nuns speak a quaint Dialect, and besides they have most
commonly all the News that pass, and they will entertain discourse till one
be weary, if he bestow on them now and then some small bagatels, as English
Gloves or Knifs, or Ribands; and before he go over, he must furnish himself
with such small curiosities; but this I dare not advise him to, in regard the
Hazard one way may be greater, than the Advantage the other way.

In this retirement he must assign some peculiar days to read the History of
the Country exactly, which is a most useful and delightful study: For in
History, that great Treasury of Time, and promptuary of Heroique actions, there
are words to speak, and works to imitat, with rich and copious matter to raise
Discourse upon: History, next to Eternity only triumphs over Time, she, only
after God Almighty can do miracles, for she can bring back Age past, and give
life to the Dead, to whom she serves as a sacred shrine to keep their names
immortal.

Touching Books he must choose them, as he should do his Friends, Few, but
Choice ones, yet he may have many Acquaintance: And as for moral society, the
greatest Wisdom of a man is discerned in a judicious election of his friends,
which are as Commentaries upon one's self, and are more necessary than fire
and water, as the Philosophher said: So for speculative and private
conversation with Authors our dead Associates, there must be must judgment
used in the choice of them, specially when there is such a confusion of them,
as in France, which as Africa peoduceth always something New, for I never knew
week pass in Paris, but it brought forth some new kinds of Authors; but let
him take heed of Tumultuary, and disjointed Authors, as well as of frivolous,
and pedantique.

And touching Books, as a a noble speculative Lord of this Land said, some are
to be tasted, only, some chewed, and some swallowed: Hereunto I will add that
some are to be dissected and anatomized into Epitomes and Notes.

To this purpose for the general History of France, Serres is one of the best,
and for the modern times d' Aubigni, Pierre Mathieu, and du Pleix; for the
political and martial government, du Haillan, de la Noue, Bodin, and the
Cabinet; Touching Commines, who was contemporary with Machiavil, 'twas a witty
speech of the last Queen mother of France, that he made more Heretics in
Policy, than Luther ever did in Religion: Therefore he requires a reader of
riperyears.

The most difficult task in gaining a foreign language is to turn English
into it, for to translate another Tongue into English, is not half so hard nor
profitable. In reading he must couch in a fair Alphabetique paperbook the
notablest occurrences, such alliances, and encounters of war (special in the
last Race of the Kings) that have intervened 'twixt England and France, and set
them by themselves in Sections. When he meets with any great business, he
must observe therein the preceding Counsels, the action it self the motives of
it, and the mould wherein it was cast, the progress and even of it, which if
successeful, he must note by what kind of Instruments, co^federations and course
of policy it was carried, if not, where the difficulties and defects lay. The
manner and method in reading of Annalists is infinitely advantageous, if one
take his rise hansomely from the beginning, and follow the series of the
matter, the Epoch of the times, and regular succession and contemporarinesse of
Princes; otherwise if one read skippingly and by snatches, and not take the
thread of the story along, it must needs puzzle and distract the memory,
wherein his observations will lie confusedly h^ddled up, like a skeine of
entangle silk.

For Sundays and Holidays, there be many Trea^ises of Devotion in the French
tongue, full of patheticall ejaculations and Heavenly raptures, and his Closet
must not be without some of these. For he must make account before hand that
his Closet must be his Church, and chiefest Chapel abroad. Therefore it were
necessary when he fixes in any place, to have always one in his chamber,
whether to retire early and late, to his soliloquies and meditations, the
golden keys wherewith he must open and shut the day, and let in the night,
and deaths Cousin-german.

Peter du Moulin has many fine pieces to this purpose, du Plessis, Allencour,
and others; and let him be conversant with such Books only upon Sundays, and
not mingle humane Studies with them. His Closet also must be his Rendez-vous,
whenever he is surprised with any fit of pensiveness (as thoughts of
Country and Kindred will often affect one) For no earthly thing exhilerats the
heart more, and rayseth the spirits to a greater height of comfort* than
conversation with God, than peace with Heaven, than Spiritual Meditation,
whereby the Soul melts into au inconceavable sweetness of delight, and is
delivered from all distempers, from all tumultuary, confusion and disturbance
of thoughts:

And there is none, let him have the humors never so well balanced within him,
but is subject unto anxiety of mind sometimes, for while we are composed of
four d^ffering Elements, wherewith the humors within us symbolise we must
have perpetual ebbings and flowings of mirth and melancholy, which have their
alternatif turns in us, as naturally as it is for the night to succeed the
day: For as the Physicians hold there is no perfection of corporal health in
this life, but a convalessence at best, which is a medium 'twixt health and
sickness, so is it in the state of the mind. This extends from the Lord to the
Laquay, from the Peasant to the Prince, whose Crown is oftentimes inlayed with
thorns, whose robe is furred with fears, whereof the Ermine is no ill
Emblem, having as many black spots in it as white; Nor is there. any thing so
hereditary to mankind as vexation of spirit, which doubtless was the ground
the Pagan Philosopher built his opinion upon, that the Rational soul was
given to Man, for his selfe-punishment and martyrdom, -- Man often is A tyrant
to himself, a Phalaris.

But as when we go abroad, we cannot hinder the birds of the air to fly and
flutter about our heads, yet we may hinder them to roost or nestle within our
hair: So while we travail in this life, we cannot prevent but myriads of
melancholy cogitations, and thoughtfull cares and longings will often seize
upon our imaginations, yet we may hinder these thoughts to build their nests
within our bosoms, and to descend from the head to the heart and take footing
there; if they do, I told you, before what is this best cordial to expel them
thence.

There be some French Poets will afford excellent entertainment, specially Du
Bartas, and 'twere not amiss to give a slight salute to Ronzard, Desportes,
and the late Theophile: And touching Poets, they must be used like flowers,
some must be only smelt unto, but some are good to be thrown into a Lambique
to be Distilled; whence the memory may carry away the Elixi^ of them, for true
Poetry is the quintessence, or rather the Luxury of Learning. Let him run
over also the Proverbs of every Country, and c^ll out the choicest of them,
for many of them carry much weight, wit, and caution, with them.

And every Nation has certain Proverbs and Adages peculiar to it self;
Neither would it be time ill spent to read Aesope in every tongue, and make it
his task to relate some Fable every day to his Governor or some other by heart.

Thus the life of a Traveller is spent either in Reading, in Meditation, or in
Discourse: by the first he converseth with the Dead, by the second with
Himself, by the last with the Living, which of all the three is most
advantageous for attaining a Language, the life whereof consists in society
and communication; let his Chamber be street ward to take in the common cry and
Language, and see how the Town is served, for it will be no unprofitable
diversion to him, but for his Closet let it be in the inner part.

SECT. IV.
HAving by the retirement aforesaid attained to a conversable Knowledge in the
French tongue, he may then adventure upon Paris, and the Court, and visit
Ambassadors, and going in the equipage of a young Nobleman, he may entertain
a Cook, a Laquay, and some young youth for his Page, to parley and chide
withal, (whereof he shall have ocasion enough) and to get some fair lodgings
to keep house of himself, and sometimes he may frequent Ordinaries, for it will
much break and enbolden him: As for expenses, he must make account that every
servant he has (whereof there should be none English but his Governor) every
one will stand him in 50 pounds a piece per annum; And for his own expenses,
he cannot allow himself less than 300 l. I include herein all sorts of
exercises, his Riding, Dancing, Fencing, the Racket, Coachhire, with other
casual charges, together with his Apparel, which if it be fashionable, it
matters not how plain it is, it being a ridiculous vanity to go gaudy amongst
Strangers, it is, as if one should light a candle to the Sun.

The time that he spends in Paris, must be chiefly employed to improve himself
in the exercises aforesaid, for there the choycest Masters are of any part of
Christendom. He must apply himself also to know the fashion and garb of the
Court, observe the Person and Genius of the Prince, enquire of the greatest
Noblemen, and their Pedigree (which I recommend to his special consideration)
of the Favorits and Prime Counselors of State, the most eminent Courtiers, and
if there be any famous man, to seek conversation with him, for it was the
saying of a great Emperor, that he had rather go fifty miles to hear a wise
man, than five to see a fair City.

For private Gentlemen and Cadets, there be diverse Academies in Paris,
Colledge-like, where for 150 pistols a year, which come to about 110 l.
sterling per annum of our money, one may be very well accommodated, with
lodging and diet for himself and a man, and be taught to Ride, to Fence, to
manage Arms, to Dance, Vault, and ply the Mathematiques.

There are in Paris every week commonly some Odd, Pamphlets and Pasquils
dispersed, and droped upon down; for there is no where else that monstrous
liberty (yet London has exceeded her far now of late, the more I am sorry)
which with the Gazets and Courants he should do well to read weekly, and
raise Discourse thereon, for though there be many trivial passages in them, yet
are they couched in very good Language, and one shall feel the general pulse
of Christendom in them, and know the names of the most famous men that are up
and down the World in action.

Some do use to have a small ledger book fairly bound up table-book-will,
wherein when they meet with any person of note and eminency, and journey or
pension with him any time, they desire him to write his Name, with some short
Sentence, which they call The (...) of remembrance, the perusal whereof will
fill one with no unpleasing thoughts of dangers and accidents passed.

One thing I must recomend to his special care, that he be very punctual in
writing to his Friends once a month at least, which he must do exactly, and
not in a careless perfunctory way, For Letters are the Ideas and truest Miror
of the Mind; they show the inside of a man, and by them it will be discerned
how he improveth himself in his courses abroad: there will be plenty of matter
to fill his letters withal once a month at least: And by his Missives let it
appear that he does not only Remember, but meditate on his Friend; not to
scribble a few cursory lines, but to write elaborately and methodically, and
thereby he will quickly come to the habit of writing well: And of all kind of
Humane Meditations, those of ones absent Friends be the pleasingst, specially
when they are endeared and nourished by correspondence of Letters, which by a
Spiritual kind of power, do enamour, and mingle Souls more sweetly than any
embraces.

SECTION. V.
HAving Wintered thus in Paris, that hudge (though durty) Theater of all
Nations (and Winter is the fittest season to be there) and plied his exercises
to some perfection, the fittest Country for him to see next is Spain, and in
his Journey thither he shall traverse the whole diameter of France one way, and
passing through Gascoigne and Languedoc, he shall prepare himself by degrees
to endure the heat of the Spanish clime; let him not encumber himself with
much loggage: and for his Apparel; let him as soon as as he enters Spain go
after their fashion, for as a Spaniard looks like a bug-beare in France in his
own ^ut, so a Frenchman appears ridiculous in Spain: nor would I advise him
to carry about him any more money than is absolutely necessary to defray his
expenses, for some in this particular have been Peny-wise, and Pound-foolish,
who in hopes of some small benefit in the rates, have left their principal,
exposing their Persons and Purses, to daily hazard, and inviting (as it were)
unto them danger for their Companion, and fear for their bedfellow.

For although Sir Thomas More wishes one to carry always his Friends about
him, abroad, by which he means pieces of gold: Yet too great a number of such
Friends, is an encomber and may betray him: It will make his Journey all along
to be a Motus trepidationis. And he that loades himself with a charge of
money, when he may carry it about him with such security, and ease, in a small
piece of paper, I mean a Letter of credit, or Bill of exchange* is as wise as
he, who carried the coach-wheele upon his back, when he might have trilled it
before him all along.

In Spain he must be much more careful of his diet, abstemious from fruit,
more reserved and cautelous in his Discourse, but entertain none at all
touching Religion, unless it be with Silence; a punctual repair of visits,
extraordinary humble in his comportment; for the Spaniards, of all other, love
to be respected at their own homes, and cannot abide an ^nsolent carriage in a
Stranger; On the other side, Courtesy and Morigeration, will gain mightily
upon them, and courtesy is the chiefest congnisance of a Gentleman, which
joined with discretion, can only Travail all the World over without a
Passeport, and of all sorts of Friends, he is the cheapest who is got by
Courtesy, and Complement only: Moreover a respectfull and humble carriage, is a
mighty advantage to gain Intelligence and Knowledge; It is the Key that opens
the breash, and unlocks the heart of any one: He that looked downward, saw the
Stars in the water, but he who looked only upward could not see the water in
the Stars: therefore there is much more to be got by Humility than otherwise.

One thing I would dissuade him from, which is from the excessive commendation
and magnifyng of his own Country; for it is too much observed, that the
English suffer themselves to be too mvch transported with this subject, to
undervalue and vilify other Countries, for which I have heard them often
censured. The Earth is the Lords, and all the corners thereof, he ereated the
Mountains of Wales, as well as the Wiles of Kent, the rugged Alps, as well as
the Fertile plains of Campagnia, the boggy fennes of Frizeland, as well as the
daintiest Valleys in France; and to inveigh against, or deride a Country for
the barrenesse thereof, is tacitly to tax God Almighty of Improvidence or
Partiality. And it had been wished, some had been more temperate in this
theme at their being in the Spanish Court, in the year 1623. For my part, as
the Great Philosopher holds it for a maxim, that Mountaignous people, are the
most pious; so are they observed to be the hardiest, as also the barrener a
Country is, the more Masculine and Warlike the spirits of the Inhabitants are,
having as it were more of men in them; Witness the Scythian and Goth, and
other rough-hewen hungry Nations, which so often over-ranne Italy, for all her
Policy and Learning; and herein Nature may seem to recompense the hard
condition of a Country the other way.

Having passed the Pyreneys he shall palpably discern (as I have observed in
another larger Discourse) the suddenest and strangest difference 'twixt the
Genius and Garb of two People, though distant but by a very small separation,
as betwixt any other upon the surface of the Earth; I know Nature delights and
triumphs in dissimilitudes; but here, she seems to have industriously, and of
set purpose studied it; for they differ not only Accidentally and Outwardly in
their, Clothing, and Carriage, in their Diet, in their Speeches, and Customs;
but even Essentially in the very faculties of the Soul, and operations
thereof, and in every thing else, Religion and the form of a Rational
creature only excepted; which made Doctor Garcia think to ask a Midwife once,
whither the Frenchman and Spaniard came forth into the World in the same
posture from the womb or no.

Go first to the Operations of the Soul, the one is Active and Mercuriall, the
other is Speculative and Saturnine: the one Quick and Ayry, the other Slow and
Heavy; the one Discoursive and Sociable, the other Reserved and Thougthfull;
The one addicts himself for the most part to the study of the Law and Canons,
the other to Positive and School Divinity; the one is Creatura sine Praeterito
and Futuro, the other has too much of both; the one is a Prometheus, the other
an Epinetheus; the one apprehends and forgets quickly, the other does both
slowly, with a judgment more abstruce and better fixed, and in se reconditum;
the one will dispatch the weightiest affairs as he walk along in the
streets, or at meals, the other upon the least occasion of business will
retire solemnly to a room, and if a Fly chance to hum about him, it will
discompose his thoughts, and puzzle him: It is a kind of sickness for a
Frenchman to keep a Secret long, and all the drugs of Egypt cannot get it out
of a Spaniard.

The French capacity, though it apprehend and assent unto the Tenets of Faith,
yet he rests not there, but examines them by his own reason, debates the
business pro and contra, and so is often gravelled upon the quick sands of his
own brain, the Spaniard clean contrary by an implicit Faith and general
Obedience believes the Canons and Determination of the Church, and presently
subjects his Understanding thereunto, he sets bounds to all his Wisdom and
Knowledge, and labors to avoid all Speculation thereon, fearing through the
frailty of his Intellectuals, to fall into some Error.

Go to their Garb and Clothing, the one wears long hair, the other short; the
one goes thin and open clad, the other close and warm, so that although the Sun
should dart down his rays like lances upon him, yet he could not be brought
to open one button of his doublet; the one goes gay without, the other
underneath; the one wears his Cloak long, the other short; so, that one might
give him a Suppositor with his Cl^ake about him, if ^eed were; the one puts on
his Doublet first, the other last; the Frenchman buttoneth always down-ward,
the Spaniard upward; the one goes high-heeled, the other low and flat, yet
looks as high as the other; the one carries a Comb and Looking-glass in his
pocket, the other a piece of bays to wipe off the dust of his shoes: And if
the one has a Fancy to stars his mustachos, the other has a leather bigothero
to lie upon them all night; the first thing the one pawns, being in necessity,
is his Shirt, the other his Cloak, and so by degrees his Cassoke goes off, and
then his Doublet; the one cares more for the Back, and outward appearance, the
other prefers the Belly; the one is constant in his fashion, for the other it is
impossible to put him in a constant kind of Habit; -- You may as soon Cut out
a kirtle for the Moon.

Go to their Diet, the one drinks Watered Wine, the other Wine watered; the
one begins his repast, where the other ends; the one begins with a Sallet, and
light meat, the other concludes his repast so; the one begins with his boiled,
the other with his roast; the Frenchman will Eat and Talk, and Sing
sometimes, and so his Teeth and his Tongue go often together, the Spaniards
Teeth only walk, and falls closely to it with as little noise and as solemnly as
if he were at Mass.

Go to their Gate, the Frenchman walks fast, (as if he had a Sergeant always at
his heels,) the Spaniard slowly, as if he were newly come out of some quartan
Ague; the French go up and down the streets confusedly in clusters, the
Spaniards if they be above three, they go two by two, as if they were going a
Procession; the French Laquays march behind, the Spaniards before; the one
beckens upon you with his hand cast upward, the other downward; the Frenchman
will not stick to pull out a Pear or some other thing out of his pocket, and
eat it as he goes along the street, the Spaniard will starve rather than do
so, and would never forgive himself, if he should commit such a rudeness; the
Frenchman if he spies a Lady of his acquaintance, he will make boldly toward
her, salute her with a kiss, and offer to Usher her by the hand or arm, the
Spaniard upon such an encounter, uses to recoyle backward, with his hands hid
under his Cloack, and for to touch or kiss her, he holds it a rudeness beyond
all barbarism, a kind of sacrilege* the Frenchmen is best and most proper on
Horseback, the Spaniard a foot; the one is good for the Onset, the other for a
retrait; the one like the Wind in the Fable, is full of ruffling fury, the
other like the Sun, when they went to try their strength upon the Passengers
Cloak. The one takes the ball before the bound, A la volee, the other stays
for the fall; the one shuffleth the Cards better, the other plays his game
more cunningly; your Frenchman is much the fairer Duellist, for when he goes
to the Field, he commonly puts off his doublet and opens his breast; the
Spaniard clean contrary, besides his shirt, has his doublet quilted, his coat
of maile, his cassock, and strives to make himself impenetrable.

Go to their Tune, the one delights in the Ionique, the other altogether in the
Dorique.

Go to their Speech, the one Speaks often, the other seldom; the one Fast, the
other slowly; the one mangleth, cuts off, and eats many Letters, the other
pronounces all; the one contracts and enchaines his words, and speaks
pressingly and short, the other delights in long breathed Accents, which he
prolates with such pauses, that before he be at the period of his Sentences,
one might reach a Second thought: The ones Mind and Tongue go commonly
together, (and the first comes sometimes in the arreare) the others Tongue
comes flagging a fourlong after his mind, in such a distance, that they seldom
or never meet and justle one another.

In sine Mercury swayeth ore the one, and Saturn ore the other, insomuch that
out of the premises, you may infer, that there is an Intellectual,
Political, Moral and Natural oposition between them both in their
Comportement, Fancies, Inclinations, Humors, and the very Understanding, so
that one may say, What the one is, the other is not; and in such a visible
discrepancy, that if one were fetched from the remotest parts of the Earth, the
Sun displayeth his beams upon, yea from the very Antipods, he would agree
with either better, than they do one with another.

SECT. VI.
ANd truly I have many times and often busied my spirits, and beaten my brains
hereupon, by taking information from dead and living men, and by my own
practical observations, to know the true cause of this strange antipathy
betwixt two such potent and so near neighboring Nations, which brings with
it such mischief into the World; and keeps Christendom in a perpetual
alarm: For although the Ill Spirit be the principal Author thereof, as being
the Father and fomenter of all discord and hatred (it being also part of the
Turks letany, that wars should continue still between these two potent
Nations) to hinder the happy fruit that might grow out of their Union: yet
nevertheless it must be thought that he cannot shed this poison, and sow
these cursed tares, unless he had some grounds to work his design upon.

And to fly to the ordinary terms of Sympathy and Antipathy, I know it is the
common refuge of the ignorant, when being not able to conceive the true reason
of natural Actions and Passions in diverse things, they fly to indefinite
generality, and very often to these inexplicable terms of Sympathy and
Antipathy.

Some as Doctor Garcia, and other Philosophical Authors, attribute this
opposition to the qualities of the clymes and influences of the Stars, which
are known to bear sway over all Sublunary bodies, insomuch that the position
of the Heavens; and Constellations, which hang over Spain, being of a
different virtue and operation to that of France, the temper and humors of the
Natives of the one, ought to be accordingly disagreeing with the other.

An opinion which may gain credit and strength from the authority of the
famous Hippocrates, who in his Book of Air, Water, and Climes, affirms that
the diversity of Constellations, cause a diversity of Inclinations, of humors
and complexions; and make the bodies whereupon they operate, to receive sundry
sorts of impressions. Which reason may have much appearance of truth, if one
consider the differing fancies of these two Nations, as it has reference to
the Predominant Constellations, which have the vogue, and qualify the Seasons
amongst them.

For then when the heat begins in Spain, the violence thereof lasts a
long time without intension, or remission, or any considerable change, the
humor of the Spaniard is just so, for if he resolves once upon a thing, he
perseveres, he ponders and dwells constantly upon it, without wavering from his
first deliberation; it being one of his prime axioms, that Deliberandum est
diu, quod statuendum est semel.

It is far otherwise in France, for be it Summer or Winter, Autumn
orSpring,neither the cold nor heat, nor serenity of Air continues nere so
long, without a sensible vicissitude and change; so that it may be truly said
there in the morning, Nescis quid serus Vesper trahat. Therefore it being
granted that all Elementary bodies depend upon the motion and virtue of the
Heavenly; the people of France must of necessity partake of the inconstancy of
the Clime, both in their passions and dispositions.

But this reason though probable enough, resolves not the question to the full;
for although we should acknowledge, that the Celestial bodies by their
influxions, do domineere over Sublunary creatures, and ^osse and tumble the
humors and the mass of blood, as they list; it cannot be said,
notwithstanding, that this virtue extends to those actions that depend
immediately upon the absolute empire of the Will, with the other faculties and
powers of the soul, which are merely Spiritual, as Love and Hatred, with the
like.

They that dispute thus, have much reason on their side, yet if we consider
well the order and method that our Understanding and Wills do use in the
production of their actions, we shall find, that the influence of the Heavenly
bodies must have something to do therein, though indirectly and accidentally:
for all Terrestrial creatures by a graduall kind of subordination, being
governed by the Heavenly, it must needs follow that whatsoever is natural in
man, as the organs of the body, and all the senses must feel the power of
their influence.

Now is the Soul so united and depends so far upon the senses, that she
cannot produce any act, unless they ministerially concur and contribute
thereunto, by presenting the matter to her, which is the intelligibles species:
Whence it necessarily comes to pass, that in regard of this straight league
and bond, which is between them, she partakes somewhat, and yealds to that
dominion, which the Stars have over the sensual appetite, which together
with the Will, are dispossed off, and incited (I will not say forced) by their
influxes.

And as that famous Wisard, the oldest of the Trismegisti, did hold, that the
Intelligences which are affixed to every Sphere, do work through the organs
of the body upon the faculties of the mind, (an opinion almost as old as the
World it self) so it may be said more truly, that by the sensual appetite, by
the frailty and depravation of the will, the Heavenly bodies work very
farre^upon the Spiritual Powers and passions of the Soul; and affect them
diversely, though by accident and indirectly, as I said before. The position
therefore of the Heavens and Asterismes, which govern the Spanish Clime, being
different in their virtue and operations to them of France, the Minds and
Fancies of both People, must by a necessary consequence be also different.

Yet notwithstanding that this assertion be true, yet it does not follow, that
the Influxions of the Stars and diversity of Climes, are the sole cause of
this Antipathy and Averseness, for there are many Nations which live under
far more distant and differing Climes, which disaffect not one another in
that degree, therefore there must be some other concurring Accidents and
extraordinary motive of this evil.

I read it upon record in the Spanish Annals, that Lewis the eleventh
desiring a personal Conference with the King of Castile, they both met upon
the borders, the Spaniards came full of Jewels and Gold Chains and richely
apparelled: Lewis, though otherwise, a wise and gallant Prince, yet had he an
humor of his own, to wear in his hat a Medaille of Lead, which he did at this
enterview, nor were his attendants, but Regis ad Exemplum* but meanly
accoutred; which made the Spaniards despise them, and make disdainefull Libels
of them, which broake out afterward into much contempt and disaffection, which
came to be aggravated more and more.

And if we say that the Devil made use of this occasion to engender that
violent Hatred, which reigns between these two Nations, it would not be much
from the purpose, for the least advantage in the World is sufficient for him to
iufuse his venom where he finds hearts never so little disposed to receive it,
either by natural or contingent causes.

Add hereunto the vast extent of greatness the Spaniard is come to within
these Six score years, by his sundry new acquest, which fills the French full
of jealousies, of emulation, and apprehension of fear; and it is an old
Aphorism, Oderunt omnes, quem metuunt.

Furthermore, another concurring motive may be, that there pass usually over
the Pyreneys, from Gascoigne and Bearne great numbers of poor French
tatterdimallians, being as it were the Scumme of the Country, which do all the
fordid and abject offices to make a purse of money, whereof Spain is fuller
than France* from Spain also there come to France many poor Spaniards to be
cured of the Kings Evil; the common people of both Nations measuring the whole
by the part* and thinking all to be such, it must needs breed mutual
apprehensions of disdain and aversion between them; so that what was at first
Accidental seems in tract of time, and by these degrees to diffuse it self
like Original sin from Father to Son, and become Natural.

But I have been transported too far by this speculation, considering that I
proposed to my self brevity at first in this small discourse.

SECT. VII.
ANd now being come from France to Spain, make accoump for matter of fertility
of soil, that you are come from Gods blessing, to the warm Sun, who is
somewhat too liberal of his beams here; which makes the ground more barren,
and consequently to be a kind of Wilderness in comparison of France, if you
respect the number of People, the multitude of Towns, Hamlets, and Houses: for
about the the third part of continent of Spain is made up of huge craggie Hills
and Mountains, amongst which one shall feel in some places more difference in
point of temper of heat and cold in the air, then 'wixt Winter and Summer
under other Climes. But where Spain has water and Valleis there she is
extraordinarily fruitful such blessings humility carries always with her. So
that Spain yields to none of her neighbors in perfection of any thing, but
only in Plenty; which I believe was the ground of a Proverb they have amongst
them, No ay cosa mala en Espana, sino lo que habla, there is nothing ill in
Spain, but that which speaks: And did Spain excel in Plenty, as she does in
perfection of what she produces, specially did she abound in Corn, whereof
she has not enough for the fortieth mouth, as also had she Men enough whereof,
besides the Wars, so many Colonies draine her, she would prove formidable to
all her Neighbors.

But let the French glory never so much of their Country as being the richest
embroidery of Nature upon Earth, yet the Spaniard drinks better Wine, eats
better Fruits, wears finer Cloth, has a better Sword by his side, and is
better Mounted than he.

Being entered Spain, he must take heed of Posting in that hot Country in the
Summer time, for it may stir the mass of blood too much. When he comes to
Madrid (for I know no other place secure enough for a Protestant Gentleman to
live in, by reason of the residence of our Ambassador) he may take new Spanish
servants, for I presume he discharged his French when he forsook Paris: There
he shall find the King constant all the Seasons of the year in the midst of
his Kingdom, as the heart in the body, or the Sun in the Firmament, whence the
one gives vigor to the little world, the other to the great in equal
proportion. And the first thing he must fall to, is Language, which he shall
find far more easy than the French, for in point of crabbednesse there is as
much difference between the French and Spanish, as 'twixt Logique and
Philosophy, the like may be said of the Italian, for a reasonable capacity may
attain both these Languages, sooner than French it self.

There was a Spanish Doctor, who had a fancy that Spanish, Italian, and French,
were spoken in Paradise, that God Almighty commanded in Spanish, the Tempter
persuaded in Italian, and Adam begged pardon in French.

I presume by the help of his Governor he has made an introduction into the
Spanish tongue before he left France, so that in one Summer and Winter he may
easily come to speak it discoursively, and to good purpose; being in my
judgment the easiest of all Languages, by reason of the openesse, and fullness
of pronunciation, the agreement 'twixt the Tongue and the Text, and the
freedom from Apostrophes, which are the knots of a Language, as also for the
proximity it has with the Latin, for the Spanish is naught else but mere
Latin, take a few Morisco words away, which are easily distinguished by their
gutturall prounciation, and these excepted, it approaches nearer and
resembles the Latin more than Italian, her eldest Daughter, for I have beaten
my brains to make one Sentence good Italian and congruous Latin, but could
never do it, but in Spanish it is very feasible, as for Example, in this
Stanza, Infausta Grecia tu paris Gentes,
Lubricas, sodomiticas, dolosas,
Machinando frauds cautelosas,
Ruinando animas innocents, etc.
which is Latin good enough, and yet is it vulgar Spanish, intelligible by
every Plebeian.

Mariana and Acosta, are the most authentic Annalists of Spain, and Alvares
for the modern story, Lope de Vegas works will give good entertainment for
Verse, and Guevara for pure Prose: Nor shall he be distracted with that
confusion of Authors, as in France, and else where, for the Spaniard writes
seldom but soundly, and in a quite differing strain from other Nations of
Christendom, savouring rather of an African fancy, which argues that the Moore
did much mingle with him.

About the fall of the leaf it were not amiss to make a journey to South
Spain, to see Sevill, and the Contratation House of the West Indies, and (if
he can) to get a copy of the Constitutions thereof, which is accounted the
greatest Mystery in the Spanish Government, but he must show himself neither
too busy, nor too bold in this search; And if he be there at the arrival of
the Plate-Fleet, which usually comes about that time, he shall see such a
Grandeza, that the Roman Monarchy in her highest flourish never had the like,
nor the Gran Signior at this day.

There he may converse with Merchants, and their conversation is much to be
valued, for many of them are very gentile and knowing men in the affairs of
the State, by reason of their long sojourne and actual negotiations, and
processes in the Country: and in a short time, one may suck out of them, what
they have been many years a gathering: And very material it is to know here,
as every where else, what commodities the Country affoordeth most useful for
us, either for necessity or pleasure: And what English commodities are there in
greatest request, and what proportions the Market usually bears, for in the
commutative part of Government and Mercantile affairs, lies the most useful
part of policy 'twixt Country and Country; but this he shall observe better
in Italy, where the Prince holds it no disparagement to co-adventure, and put
in his stake with the Merchant: So that the old Clodian Law is now of no force
at all amongst them.

From South Spain he may return by Granada, Murcia and Valencia, and so to
Barcelona, and then take the Galleys for Italy, for there are diverse Fleets
pass in the year from thence with treasure, and cross the Mediterranean to
Genoa. And it is not amiss to see something by Sea, and to embarque in a Fleet
of Galleys will much add to ones experience, and knowledge in Sea affairs,
and in the Art of Navigation which is more useful and important for
Englishmen, and indeed for all Islanders, than others, because their security
depends upon the Sea, and upon wooden Horses. Naviget hinc alia jam mihi
linter aqua.

SECT. VIII.
HAving put foot ashoare in Genoa, I will not wish him to stay long there, in
regard the very worst Italian dialect is spoken there, and besides, as it is
proverbially said, there are in Genoa, Mountains without wood, Sea without
fish, Women without shame, and Men without conscience, which makes them to be
termed the white Moors: And when a Jew (and the Jews are held the most
Mercuriall people in the World, by reason of their so often transmigrations,
persecutions, and Necessity, which is the Mother of Wit) meets with a
Genoway, and is to negotiat with him, he puts his fingers in his eyes, fearing
to be overreached by him, and outmatched in cunning.

From thence let him hasten to Toscany, to Siena, where the prime Italian
dialect is spoken, and not stir thence till he be master of the Language in
some measure.

And being now in Italy that great limbique of working brains, he must be very
circumspect in his carriage, for she is able to turn a Saint into a Devil, and
deprave the best natures, if one will abandon himself, and become a prey to
dissolut courses and wantonness.

The Italian, being the greatest embracer of pleasures, the greatest Courtier
of Ladies of any other. Here he shall find Virtue and Vice, Love and Hatred,
Atheism and Religion in their extremes; being a witty contemplative people;
and Corruption optimi est pessima. Of the best wines you make your tartest
vinegar.

Italy has been always accounted the Nurse of Policy, Learning, Music,
Architecture, and Limning, with other perfections, which she disperseth to the
rest of Europe, nor was the Spaniard but a dunce, till he had taken footing in
her, and so grew subtilized by co-alition with her people. She is the prime
climat of Complement, which oftentimes puts such a large distance 'twixt the
tongue and the heart, that they are seldom relatives, but they often give the
lie one to another; some will offer to kiss the hands, which they wish were
cut off, and would be content to light a candle to the Devil, so they may
compass their own ends: He is not accounted essentially wise, who opens all
the boxes of his breast to any.

The Italians are for the most part of a speculative complexion (as I have
discovered more amply in another Discourse) and he is accounted little less
than a fool, who is not melancholy once a day; they are only bountiful to
their betters, from whom they may expect a greater benefit; To others the purse
is closest shut, when the mouth opens widest, nor are you like to get a cup
of wine there, unless your grapes be known to be in the wine press.

From Siena he may pass to Milan, and so through the Republiques territories
to Venice, where he shall behold a thing of wonder, an Impossibility in an
impossibility, a rich magnificent City seated in the very jaws of Neptune,
where being built and bred a Christian from her very infancy, (a Prerogative
she justly glories of above all other States,) she has continued a Virgin
ever since, nere upon twelve long ages, under the same form and face of
Government, without any visible change or symptom of decay, or the least
wrinkle of old age, though, her too near neighbor, the Turk has often set
upon her skirts and sought to deflowre her, wherein he went so far that he
took from her Venus jointure, which she had long possessed, and was the sole
Crown she ever wore. But if one in Story observes the course of her actions, he
shall find that she has subsisted thus long as much by Policy as Arms, as
much by reach of Wit, and advantage of treaty, as by open strength, it having
been her practice ever and anon to sow a piece of Fox tail to the skin of
S. Marks Lion.

Here one shall find the most zealous Patriots of any, yet some would maintain
(though I do not) that the Venetians, are but indifferently wise single, though
they be very Politic when they are together in the Senate.

Having observed in the Republique of Venice what is, most remarquable (and
there are many things in that Government worth the carrying away, specially the
sight of Nova Palma, a Castle built after the newest rules of Fortification) he
may visit the other ancient Towns of Italy, and so to Naples, where he may
improve his knowledge in Horsmanship, and then repasse through other free
States, whereof Italy is full: And truly a wonder it is to see how in so small
an extent of ground, which take all dimensions together, is not so big as
England, there should be so many absolute and potent Princes by Sea and Land,
which I believe is the cause of so many Dialects in the Italian tongue which
are above ten in number: As he traverseth the Country he must note the
trace, form and site of any famous Structure, the Platforms of Gardens,
Aqueducts, Grots, Sculptures, and such particularities belonging to
accommodation or beauty of dwelling, but specially of Castles, and Fortresses,
wherewith Italy abounds, the whole Country being frontier almost all over.

SECTION. IX.
And with the natural situation of Countries, a Travellershould observe also
the Politicalposition thereof, how some are seated like Mercury amongst the
Planets, who for the most part is either in combustion or obscurity, being
under brighter beams than his own; Such is Savoyand Loraine, and other Princes
of Italy, who are between more potent neighbors than themselves, and are like
s^reens tossed up and down and never at quiet: And they that are so situated
may say, as the Mouse once answered the Cat, who asking how she did, made
answer, I should be far better, if you were further off.

How the state of the Popedom running from the Tirrhene to the Adriatique Sea,
is sited in Italy, as France is in Europe, in the midst, and so fittest to
embroyle or preserve in peace, to disunite or conjoyne the forces of their
neighbors, and so most proper to be Umpires of all quarrels.

How the Dominions of Spain are like the Planets in the Heaven lying in vast
uneven distances one from the other: But clean contrary those of France, are
so knit and clustered together, that they may be compared all to one fixed
constellation.

How Germany cut out into so many Principal ties, into so many Hansiatiqued and
Imperial Towns, is like a great River sluced into sundry Channels, which
makes the maine stream far the weaker* the like may be said of Italy.

How the Signory of Venice is the greatest rampart of Christendom against the
Turk by Sea, and the hereditary territories of the house of Austria, by Land,
which may be a good reason of State, why the College of Electors has
continued the Empire in that Line these 200 years.

He must observe the quality of the power of Princes, how the Cavalry of
France, the Infantery of Spain, and the English Ships, leagued together, are
fittest to conquer the World, to pull out the Ottoman Tyrant out of his
Seraglio, from between the very arms of his fifteen hundred Concubines.

How the power of the North-East part of the European World is balanced between
the Dane, the Swede, and the Pole, etc. And the rest between great Britain,
France, and Spain; as for Germany and Italy, their power being divided 'twixt
so many, they serve only to balance themselves, who if they had one absolute
Monarch a piece, would prove terrible to all the rest.

Spain in point of treasure has the advantage of them al, She has a Veteran
Army always afoot; but She is thin peopled, She has many Colonies to supply,
which lie squandred up and down in disadvantagious unsociable distances, Her
people are disaffected by most nations, and incompatible with some; She wants
bread, She has bold accessible coasts, and Her West Indy Fleet, besides the
length of the passage, and incertainty of arrival, is subject to casualties of
Sea, and danger of interception by Enemies: And if England should break out
with Her in good earnest into acts of hostility, those Islands, which the
English have peopled, colonized, and fortified lately (being warned by Saint
Christopher) in the carrere to Her mines, would be found to be no small
disadvantage to Her.

France swarms with men, and now (more than ever) with Soldiers, She is a body
well compacted (though often subject to Convulsions, and high fits of Fevers,
the blood gathering up by an unequal diffusion into the upper parts) and it is
no small advantage to Her, that Her form is circular, so that one part may
quickly run, to succor the other: She abounds with Corn, and being the
thorough fare of Christendom, She can never want money; She has those three
things which the Spaniard said would make Her eternal, viz. Rome, the Sea, and
Counsel; for She has the the Pope for Her friend (having had his breeding in
Her twenty years together) She has Holland for Her Arsenall, and Richelieu
for Counsel; who since he sat at the helm, has succeeded in every attempt,
with that monstrous course of Felicity: They of the Religion, are now
Town-lesse, and Arme-lesse, and so are Her greatest Peers most of them out of
Office and Provincial command. So that if one would go to the intrinsique
value of things, France will not want much in weight of the vast unweldy bulk,
and disjointed body of the Spanish Monarchy.

Great Britain being encircled by the Sea, and there being an easy going out
for the Natives, and a dangerous landing for Strangers, and having so many
invincible Castles in motion (I mean Her Ships) and abounding inwardly with
all necessaries, and breeding such men, that I may well say, no King whatsoever
has more choice of able bodies to make Soldiers of, having also most of Her
trade intrinsique, with many other Insulary advantages, She need not fear any
one Earthly power, if She be true to Her self; yet would She be puzzled to
cope with any of the other two single, unless it be upon the defensive part,
but joining with Holland She can give them both the Law at Sea, and leaguing
with any of the other two, She is able to put the third shrewdly to it.

Now it cannot be denied, but that which gives the greatest check to the
Spanish Monarchy is France: And there is no less truth than caution in that
saying, that the yeaue of the Conquering of France, is the morning of the
Conquest of England (and vice versa.) It has not been then without good reason
of State, that England since that monstrous height of power that Spain is
come to of late, has endeavored rather to strengthen France (to bear up
against Her) than to enfeeble Her, having contributed both her power and purse
to ransom one of her Kings, at that time when Spain began to shoot out Her
branches so wide: Besides, during the last Ligue, which raged so long through
all the bowels of France with that fury, when there was a design to Cantonize
the whole Kingdom; Queen Elizabeth though offered a part, would not accept of
it, for fear of weakening the whole: Therefore this chain of reciprocal
conservation, linking them together so strongly; England may well be taken for
a sure Confederate of France, while France contains Her self within her
present bounds, but if She should reduce the Spaniard to that desperate pass
in the Netherlands* as to make him throw the helve after the hatcher, and to
relinquish those Provinces altogether, it would much alter the case: for
nothing could make France more suspectfull to England than the addition of
those Countries, for thereby they would come to be one continued piece, and so
England her overthwart neighbor, should be in a worse case than if the
Spaniard had them entirely to himself. For it would cause Her to put Her self
more strongly upon Her Guard, and so increase Her charge and care.

To conclude this point, there cannot be a surer maxim and fuller of
precaution for the security of England, and Her Allies, and indeed for all
other Princes of this part of the World, than Barnevelt gave of late years, a
little before he came to the fatal block. Decrescat Hispanus, nec crescat
Francus.

But I have been transported too far by this ticklish digression, which
requires an ampler and more serious Discourse.

In fine, with these particulars, a Traveller should observe the likeness and
sympathy of distant Nations, as the Spaniard with the Irish, the French with
the Pole, the German (specially Holsteinmen) with the English, and in Italy
there have been many besides my self, that have noted the countenance and
condition of some people of Italy, specially those that inhabit Lombardy, to
draw near unto the ancient Britains of this Island, which argues, that the
Romans, who had their Legions here so many hundred years together, did much
mingle and clope with them. Amongst other particulars, the old Italian tunes
and rithmes both in conceit and cadency, have much affinity with the Welsh,
(and the genius of a people is much discovered by their prosody) for example,
Vlisse o lass^, o dolce Amor^ muoro, etc.

This agrees pat with the fancy of the Welsh Bards, whose greatest acuteness
consists in Agnominations and in making one word to tread as it were upon the
others heel, and push it forward in like letters, as in the precedent example,
whereof many Italian Authors are full, appears.

SECT. X.
HE must also observe the number of Languages, and difference of Dialects, as
near as he can, in every Country as he passes along.

The French have three dialects, the Wallon (vulgarly called among themselves
Romand,) the Provensall, (whereof the Gascon is a subdialect) and the speech of
Languedoc: They of Bearne and Navarre speak a Language that has affinity with
the Bascuence or the Cantabrian tongue in Biscaie, and amongst the Pyrenean
mountains: The Armorican tongue, which they of low Britain speak (for there
is your Bas-Breton, and the Breton-Brittonant or Breton Gallois, who speaks
French) is a dialect of the old British as the word Armorica imports, which is
a mere Welsh word, for if one observe the Radical words in that Language they
are the same that are now spoken in Wales, though they differ much in the
composition of their sentences, as does the Cornish: Now some of the
approvedst* Antiquaries positively hold the Original Language of the Celtae,
the true ancient Gauls, to be Welsh: And amongst other Authors they produce no
meaner than Caesar and Tacitus, to confirm this opinion: For Caesar says that
the Druydes of Gaul understood the British Druyds, who it seems were of more
account for their Philosophy, because as he says, the Gauls came usually over
to be taught by them, which must be by conference, for there were few books
then: Besides Tacitus in the life of Julius Agricola reports, that the
Language of the Britains and the Gauls little differed, I restrain my self
to the middle part of France called Gallia Celtica, for they of Aquitaine spoke
a language that corresponded with the old Spanish, they of Burgundy and
Champagny with the German, and most part of Provence spoke Greek, there having
been a famous Colony of Grecians planted in Marseilles: Other small
differences there are up and down in other Provinces of France, as the low
Norman uses to contract many words, as he will often say, IN ay un pet a
fair, for IN ay un petit affair, and the Poictevin will mince the word, and
say, ma Mese, mon pese, for ma Mere, mon Pere; but these differences are not
considerable.

The Spanish or Castilian tongue, which is usually called Romance, and of late
years Lengua Christiana, (but it is called so only amongst themselves) for a
Spaniard will commonly ask a stranger whether he can speak Christian, that
is, Castillian? The Spanish (I say) has but one considerable dialect, which is
the Portugues, which the Jews of Europe speak more than any other language,
and they hold that the Messiah shall come out that Tribe, that speak the
Portingal language; other small differences there are in the pronunciation of
the gutturall letters in the Castillian, but they are of small moment. They of
the Kingdom of Valencia and Catalunia (Goth-land) speak rather a language
mixed of French, and Italian: In the Mountains of Granada (the Alpuxarras)
they speak Morisco, that last part of Spain that was inhabited by the Moors,
who had possessed it above 700 years.

But the most ancient speech of Spain seems to have been the Bascuence or
the Cantabrian tongue spoken in Guipuscoa, the Asturias and in some places
amongst the Pyrenes; but principally in the Province of Biscaye, which was
never conquered by Roman, Cartaginian, Goth, Vandall or Moore, which Nations
overrunne all the rest of Spain, (though some more, some less) therefore
whenever the King of Spain comes to any of the territories of Biscaye, he
must pull off his shoes upon the frontiers, when he treads the first step,
being as it were Virgin holy ground. And as it is probable that the Bascuence
is the primitive language of Spain, so doubtless the people of that Country
are a remnant of the very Aborigenes, of her first Inhabitants. For it is an
infallible Rule, that if you desire to find out (the Indige^nae) the ancientest
people or language of a Country, you must go amongst the Mountains and places
of fastness, as the Epirotiques in Greece, the Heylanders in Scotland, the
Britains in Wales, with whom (I mean the last) the Biscayner does much
symbolize in many things, as in the position and quality of ground, in his
candor and humanity toward Strangers more than any other people of Spain, his
cried up Antiquity; for the Spaniards confess the ancientest race of Gentry to
have been preserved there: So that a Biscayner is capable to be a Cavalier of
any of the three habits without any scrutiny to be made by the Office, whether
he be, limpio de la sangre de los Moros, that is, clear of the blood of the
Moors or no, it is enough that he be a Montanero, that he be borne amongst the
Mountains of Biscaye. And many may be the reasons why Hilly people keep their
standings so well, for being inured to labor, and subject to the inclemency of
the Heavens, distemperatures of Air, to short Commons, and other
incommodities, they prove the hardier and abler men, and happily with the
elevation of the ground their spirits are heightened, and so prove more
courageous and forward to repel an invading enemy.

Add hereunto, that the cragginesse and steepinesse of places up and down is a
great advantage to the dwellers, and makes them inaccessible, for they serve as
Fortresses erected by Nature her self, to protect them from all incursions: as
Caesar complains of some places in Scythia, that Difficilius erat hostem
invenire, quam vincere.

And now for further proof that the Cantabrian language is the ancientest of
Spain, I think it will not be much from the purpose, if I insert here a
strange discovery that was made not much above half a hundred years ago,
about the very middle of Spain, of the Pattuecos, a people that were never
known upon the face of the Earth before, though Spain has been a renowned
famous Country visited and known by many warlik Nations: They were discovered
by the flight of a Faulcon, for the Duke of Alva hauking on a time near
certain hills, not far from Salamanca, one of his Hauks which he much valued,
flew over those Mountains, and his men not being able to find her at first,
they were sent back by the Duke after her; these Faulkners clammering up and
down, from hill to hill and luring all along, they lighted at last upon a large
pleasant Valley, where they spied a company of naked Savage people, locked in
between an assembly of huge crags and hills indented and hemmed in (as it were)
one in another: As simple and Savage they were, as the rudest people of any of
the two Indies, whereof some thought a man on horseback to be one creature with
the horse: These Savages gazing awhile upon them, flew away at last into their
caves, for they were Troglodites, and had no dwelling but in the hollowes of
the rocks: The Faulconers observing well the track of the passage, returned the
next day, and told the Duke, that in lieu of a hawk, they had found out a New
World, a New People never known on the continent of Spain, since Tubal Cain
came first thither: A while after, the Duke of Alva went himself with a
Company of Muscateers, and Conquered them, for they had no offensive weapon but
slings; they were Pythagoreans, and did eat nothing that had life in it, but
excellent fruits, roots and springs there were amongst them; they worshipped
the Sun, and new Moon, their language was not intelligible by any, yet many of
their simple words were pure Bascuence, and their gutturall pronunciation the
very same, and a gutturall pronunciation is an infallible badge of an ancient
language; And so they were reduced to Christianity, but are to this day
discernable from other Spaniards by their more tawny complexions, which
proceeds from the reverberatio^ of the Sunbeams glancing upon those stony
mountains wherewith they are encircled, and on some sides trebly fenced, which
beams reflects upon them with a greater strength and so tannes them.

But I did not think to have stayed so long in Spain now nor indeed the last
time I was there, but he that has to deal with that Nation, must have good
store of Phlegm and patience, and both for his stay, and success of
business, may often reckon without his host.

SECTION. XI.
But these varieties of Dialects in France and Spain, are far less in
number to those of Italy; Nor do I believe were there ever so many amongst the
Greeks, though their Country was indented and cut out into so many Islands,
which as they differed in position of place, so there was some reason they
should differ something in propriety of Speech: There is in Italy the Toscan,
the Roman, the Venetian, the Neapol^tan, the Calabrese, the Genovese, the
Luquesse, the Milanese, the Parmasan, the Piemontese, and others in and about
Abouzzo, and the Apennine hills; and all these have several Dialects and
Idiomes of Speech, and the reason I conceive to be, is the multiplicity of
Governments, there being in Italy, one Kingdom, three Republiques, and five or
six absolute Principalities, besides the Popedom, and their Laws, being
different, their Language also grows to be so, but the prime Italian dialect,
take Accent and Elegance together, is Lingua Toscana in boca Romana. The Toscan
tongue in a Roman mouth.

There is also a Mongrell Dialect composed of Italian and French, and some
Spanish words are also in it, which they call Franco, that is used in many of
the Islands of the Aegean Sea, and reaches as far as Constantinople, and
Natolie, and some places in Afrique; and it is the ordinary speech of Co^merce
'twixt Christians, Jews, Turks, and Greeks in the Levant.

Now for the Original Language in Italy, as the Mesapian and Hetruscan tongue,
there is not a syllable left any where, nor do I know any Country where the
old primitive Languages, are so utterly and totally extinguished without the
least trace left behind, as in Italy.

Touching the Latin Tongue, which is one of the ancientest Languages of Italy,
but not so ancient as those I spoke of before, the received opinion is, that
the inundation of the Goths, Vandals and Longbards, were her first Corrupters
but it is not so, as the Learned Bembo, and our no less Learned Brerewood are
of opinion; for as the Latin Tongue grew to perfection by certain degrees,
and in Caesar and Cicero's times (whereof the one for purity, the other for
copiousnesse, were the best that ever writ) she came to the highest flourish
together with the Empire, so had she insensible degrees of corruption amongst
the vulgar, and intrinsique changes in her self before any foreign cause
concurred; for the Salian Verses, toward the end of the Republique, were
scarce intelligible, no more were the capitulations of Peace 'twixt Rome and
Carthage in Polybius his time: And every one knows what kind of Latin stands
upon record on the Columna Rostrata in the Capitol, in memory of the famous
Navall victory of Duillius the Consul, which happened but 150 years before
Cicero. As also what Latin had the vogue in Pla^utus his time: And here it
will not be much ou^ of the byas, to insert (in this Ogdoastique) a few verses
of the Latin which was spoken in that age, which were given me by a worthy
polite Gentleman, Sic est, nam nenum lacient uls manaca, praes est
Andreas; Ipsus Hortitor ergo cluo
Dividiam estricem ut genii averruncet, and ultra
Calpar, si pote, Lurae insipet omnimodis,
Calpar, quod Nymphis nenum ebrium, at Argeliorum
Zitho, quod nostra haec vincia dapsiliter
Degulet, ha frux obgraecari (haut numina poscent)
Prodinit, topper morta modo orta necat.
So that as before, so after Cicero's time, the Latin Tongue wrought certain
changes in her self, before any mixture with Strangers, or the intervention of
any foreign cause: For as Kingdoms and States with all other Sublunary things
are subject to a tossing and tumbling, to periods and changes, as also all
Natural bodies corrupt inwardly and insensibly of themselves, so Languages are
not exempt from this Fate, from those accidents, and revolutions that attend
Time: For Horace complained in his days, that words changed as coins did: Yet
besides this home bredd change, it cannot be denied but the Latin Tongue, had
some foreign extrinsique cause to degenerate so far into Italian, as the
admission of such multiplicities of Strangers to be Roman Citizens, with the
great number of slaves that were brought into the City; Add herunto at last
those swarms of barbarous Nations, which in less than one hundred years
thrice overran Italy, and took such footing in her: And as in Italy, so
likewise in Spain and France, they corrupted the Latin tongue, though I
believe she never took any perfect impression amongst the vulgar in those
Countries, albeit the Romans labored to plant her there, making it their
practice (though not at first: for we read of some People that petitioned unto
them, that they might be permitted to use the Latin tongue) with the Law to
bring in their Language as a mar^e of Conquest.

But one may justly as^^e why the Latin tongue could receive no growth at all
amongst the Britains, who were so many hundred years under the Roman
government, and some of the E^perours living and dying amongst them? To this ^t
may be answered, that i^ Britain we read of no more than four colonies
that ever were planted; but in Spain there were 29, and in France 26. But as I
cannot cease to wonder that the Romans notwithstanding those Colonies and
Legions that had so long cohabitation, and coalition with them, could take no
impression at all upon the Britains in so long a tract of time in point of
Speech, (notwithstanding that in some other things there be some resemblances
observed 'twixt the people, as I said before) I wonder as much how such a
multitude of Greek words could creep into the Welsh language, some whereof for
example sake, I have couched in this Distique. (...). Which words Englished
are, Salt, water, birth, fire, the belly, an old woman, to teach, the earth,
honey, to hear, the Sun, destiny, drunkard.

Besides diverse others, which are both Greek and Wels^, both in pronunciation
and sense.

Now for the Greek tongue, there is no question, but it was of larger extent
than ever the Roman was, for these three respects, for the mighty commerce that
Nation did exercise, for their humor in planting of Colonies, for their
Learning and Philosophy, for Greek is the scientificalst tongue that ever was,
in all which they went beyond the Romones: And it is not long ago since in some
places of Italy her self, as Calabria and Apulia, the Liturgy was in the Greek
tongue. Nor is some vulgar Greek so far adulterated, and eloignated from the
true Greek, as Italian is from the Latin, for there is yet in some places of
the Morea true Greek spoken vulgarly (you cannot say so of the Latin any where)
only they confound these three letters, (...), (Eta, Iota, Upsilon) and these
two dipthongs (...), and (...), all which they pronounce as Ioata. As for
(...), they pronounce (...), for (...), they say (...) There is also true Greek
spoken in some parts of the lesser Asia, where there is no place upon the
surface of the earth, for the proportion, where so many differing Languages are
spoken, yet most of them are but Dialects and subdialects; so that of those two
and twenty tongues, which Mithridates is recorded to have understood, above two
parts of three, I believe, were but dialects.

I dare go no further Eastward, for it is beyond the bounds of so smalla Volume
as this, to speak of the Levantine tongues, that go from the Liver to the
Heart, from the Right hand to the Left, as the most Spacious Arabique, which is
spoken (or learnt) throughoutal the vast dominions of the Mahumetan Empire, and
is the most fixed language now upon Earth, it being death to alter it, or
Translate the Alcoran into any other language, to add the least title to the
first text, or comment upon it; a rare policy to prevent schisms, and
restrain the extravagant, and various restless fancies of humane brain.

This page is also too narrow to comprehend any thing of the most large
Slavonique tongue, which above other Languages has this prerogative to have
two Characters, one resembling the Latin, the other the Greek, and in many
places the Liturgy is in both, one for Sundays and Holy Days, the other for
working days. There are above forty several Nations, both in Europe and Asia,
which have the Slavonick for their vulgar speech, it reaches from Mosco, the
Court of the great Knez, to the Turks Seraglio in Constantinople, and so over
the Propontey to diverse places in Asia, i^ being the common language of the
Ianizaries.

SECT. XII.
THe German or Teutonique tongue also is of mighty extent, for not only the
large Continent of Germany high and low, but the Kingdoms of England,
Scotland, Denmarque, S^ethland, Norway, Island, and some parts of Hungary and
Poland speak it vulgarly. And questionless the German is one of the first
mother tongues of Europe, whereof Scaliger would have but eleven, though there
be four or five more, but I find that they who are cried up for great Clearks
may err, as he did in this, as also when he made Prester John an African and
placed him in Ethiopia, in the Habassins Country, whereas it is certain that
he was an Asian, and King of Tenduc in Tartary above two thousand miles
distant, besides he was a Nestorian by his religion, and it is well known the
Habassines are Iacobites and Christians from the girdle upward, and Jews
downward, admitting both of Baptism and Circumcision.

And so ancient is the German tongue, that Goropius Becanus flattered himself
with a fancy, that it was the language which was spoken in Paradise, which
Ortelius also showed a desire to believe; they grounded this conceit upon
these words, Adam, Eve, Abel, Seth, etc. which they would stretch to be German
words; also that their language came first from Asia, because Godt, Fader,
Mother, Brother, Star, are found to signify the same things both in the German,
and Persian tongue.

There is no language so full of Monosyllables and knotted so with Consonants as
the German, howsoever she is a full mouthd masculine speech: the speeches of
the Kingdoms before mentioned, are but Dialects derived from her; And the
English is but a Subdialect or branch of the Saxon Dialect, which has no other
name in Welsh and Irish to this day; for take an Englishman Capa pea, from head
to foot, every member he has is Dutch.

Yet since the last Conquest much French has got in, and greatly embellished
and smoothed the English, so that there is very much affinity between them, as
for Example, La Fortune me tourmente,
La Virtue mecontente.
Or, Men desir est infiny,
D' entrer en Paradis.
Which sayings are both French and English.

Of late years the English tongue has much enriched her self, by borrowing
of some choice, well sounding and significant words from other Languages also;
so that she may be compared to a Posie made up of many fragrant choice Flowers:
And truly, without interest and passion, let it be spoken, there is in English
as true strains of Eloquence, as strong and sinewy Expressions, as elaborate
and solid pieces of Fancy, as far fetched reaches of Invention, and as full of
salt, Metaphor's as faithfully poursued Similies as aptly applied, and as well
clothed and girded about; as in any Language whatsoever, both in Poesy and
Prose; It must be granted that some other Languages, for their soft and smooth
melting fluency, as having no abruptness of Consonants, have some advantage of
the English; yet many of their fancies, which amongst themselves they hold to
be strong lines and quintessentiall stuff, being turned to another tongue
become flat, and prove oftentimes but mere gingles, but what is witty in
English, is so, with advantage, in any Language else, unless the conceit be
topicall, or personal, and peculiar only to this Island.

But whither have I been thus transported? The Copiousnesse and pleasure of the
Argument has carried me a little further than I made account, for to be a
(...), to have the knowledge, specially the practical knowledge (for the
Theory is not nere so grateful nor useful) of many languages is one of the
richest and pleasingst kind of Notions that is; And we find upon the best
record, that the first blessing which fell down from Heaven upon those holy
Heralds of Christianity, the Apostles, was the knowledge of many tongues,
inspired into them immediately by God Almighty himself.

For what is Imagination, Invention and Sense, without the faculty of Speech
without expression? Speech is the instrument by which a Fool is distinguished
from a Philosopher: Speech is the Index, the Interpreter, the Ambassador of the
mind, and the Tongue the Vehiculum, the Chariot, which conveyeth and carries
the notions of the Mind to Reasons Palace, and the impregnable Tower of Truth:
And although there be but one way thither, yet there be many sorts of Chariots,
some more sumptuous and better harnessed than others; for amongst tongues there
be some far more rich, more copious, and of stronger expressions than others:
And amongst Tongues there is also a kind of, good fellowship, for they
sometimes supply one another wants, and mutually borrow and lend.

SECT. XIII.
But whether have I wantred? I had almost forgot where I left my Traveller, but
now I remember well it was in Italy. And having surveyed Italy, that minion of
Nature, he may cross the Alps, and see some of the Cantons, those rugged
Repub^iques, and Regiments, and then pass through many of the Stately proud
Cities of Germany, till he comes to Bruxels, and there he shall behold the
face of a constant Military Court, and Provincial Government, with a
miscellany of all Nations, and if there be any Leagers a foot, or Armies in
motion, it should be time well spent to see them. For the Netherlands have
been for many years, as one may say, the very Cockpit of Christendom, the
School of Arms, and Rendezvous of all adventurous Spirits, and Cadets, which
makes most Nations of Europe beholden to them for Soldiers. Therefore the
History of the Belgique wars are very worth the reading, for I know none fuller
of stratagemes of reaches of Policy, of variety of successes in so short a
time: nor in which more Princes have been engaged (though some more, some
less) for reasons of state, nor a war which has produced such deplorable
effects directly or collaterally, all Christendom over, both by Sea and Land.

Iean Petit in French, is an approved Author, Guicciardin, Don Carles Coloma in
Spanish, and Sir Roger Williams in English, with others, there you shall read
of one Town taken by a Boat of Turfs, and reprized many years after by a Boat
of Fagots, another taken by the flight of a Ha^k, another by a load of Hey,
another by a Cart full of Apples, and many by disguises, either of Boores,
Friars, or Marchands.

Having spent some small time in Brabant and Flanders, he may by safe conduct,
as is usual, pass to Holland, where he shall find a People planted as it were
under the Sea, out of whose jaws they force an habitation, with infinite
expense and toil, checking the impetuous course of the angry Ocean, and showing
the World how far Industry and Art, can curb and control Nature: And very
expedient it is, he should take an exact Survey of the States of the United
Provinces, because they are accounted the surest Confederates of England, and
her fastest Friends, for interest of Religion, for community of danger, and
consequently of reciprocal preservation.

And it will be a wonderful thing to see what a mighty subsistence of wealth
and a huge Navigable power that State in come too, by a rare unparalelled
industry: For I dare avouch that the Roman Commonwealth, (though she had her
head as well knit in her infancy as any that ever was) did not come near her,
in so short a progress of time, to such a growth of strength.

But it seems all things conspired to raise Holland to this pass: First, the
humor of the people, being patient* and iudustrious, and of a genius more in
clinable to a Democraticall Government than to a Monarchy: Add hereunto the
quality of the Country, being every where half cut, and as it were inlayed
with water, and thereby much fortified, and made in many places inaccessible;
so that, if need were, Holland could turn her self into a huge pond when she
list.

Hereunto concurred a further advantage of situation, having behind her the
Baltique Sea, which affoords her all kind of Materials for shipping, and for
all kind of Nutriment and Military forces England and France, both swarming
with superfluous people, suspectfull of the Spanish greatness, and so not
unwilling to contribute auxiliary strength for mutual security and
conservation.

Navigation and Mercantile Negotiation, are the two Poles whereon that State
does move, and to both these, it seems, Nature her self has expressly
designed both Country and People; Them be an extraordinary kind of Propensity,
the Country by apt position, for having no Land to manure, they plow the very
bowels of the Deep, the wrinkled forehead of Neptune being the furrows that
yealds them increase.

Moreover, there being many great Rivers that slice and cut the Country up and
down to disgorge themselves into the Ocean, those Rivers may be said to pay them
tribute, as well as to the Sea, which Rivers branching themselves into large
and bearing streams, do so fitly serve one another, and all the whole, that it
may be said, Nature in the frame of humane bodies, did not discover more Art,
in distributing the veins and arteries, for the easy conveyance of the mass
of blood into each part, as she has showed here in dispersing those waters so
orderly for trafique.

These Rivers bring her what the large continent of Germany, and other Eastern
Countries afford, and she lying between them and the Sea; furnishes them
with all far fetched Indian, African, and Spanish commodities.

Here you shall see the most industrious people upon earth, making a rare
virtue of necessity, for the same thing which makes a Parrot speak, makes them
to labor. For having nothing of their own, yet they abound with all things,
and may be said, to live by the idleness of some of their neighbors, I am
loath to name here who they are.

Here you shall find a people grow Rich also by that which uses to impoverish
others, even by War, for pri^es and booties abroad, go to make a good part of
their wealth.

Yet in conversation they are but heavy, of a homely outside, and slow in
action, which slownesse carries with it a notable per severance, and this may
be imputed to the quality of that mould of earth, whereon they dwell, which
may be said to be a kind of ^^^^ding poole of Air: And which is known to have
such a force of assimilation, that when people of a more vivacious temper, come
to mingle with them, at the second generation, they seem to participate of the
soil and Air, and degenerate into mere Hollanders; the like is found daily
in Horses and Dogs, and all other animals. Occulta est Batavae quaedam vis
insita terrae.

One remarquable piece of Policy I forgot, that he should observe in the
United Provinces; viz. Why in so small an extent of ground they have so many
rich, welbuilt and populous Towns amongst them; one of the principal reasons
is, because they appropriate some staple material commodity to every one of
the great Towns, as Amsterdam has the trade of the East and West Indies,
Roterdam the English Cloth, Dort the Rhenish Wines, Middelborough the French
Wines, Treveres the Scots trade, the Hage the residence of the Prince, and the
States, Haerlam subsist by knitting and dying, and so forth which is a very
laudable course* not to suffer one place to swallow the wealth an^ traffic of
the whole, like the spleen in the natural body, whose swelling makes all the
rest of the members languish.

SECT. XIV.
HAving thus passed the diameter of France, run over Spain, crossed the
Mediterranean to Italy, and observed the multiplicity of Governments therein;
having thus climbed the Alps, and traversed the best part of Germany, having
also taken the length of the Belgique Lion, (of all which France for a
Kingdom, Venice for a Republique, Millan for a Duchy, Flanders for a County
bear the bell) having I say, Traveled through all these places, all which may
be done completely in three years and four months, which four Months I
allow for itinerary removals and journeys, and the Years for residence in
places; it will be high time now to hoyse sail, and steer homwards, where
being returned, he must abhor all affectation* all forced postures and
complements: For Foreign Travel oftentimes makes many to wander from
themselves, as well as from their Country, and to come back mere Mimiques, and
so in going far, to fare worse, and bring back less wit, than they carries
forth, they go out Figures (according to the Italian Proverb) and return
Ciphers, they retain the Vice of a Country, and will discourse learnedly
thereon, but pass by, and forget the good, their Memories being herein like
hair seeves, that keep up the branne, and let go the fine flowr^* They strive
to degenerate as much as they can from Englishmen, and all their talk is still
Foreign, or at least, will bring it to be so, though it be by head and
shoulders, magnifying other* Nations, and derogating from their own: Nor can
one hardly exchange three words with them, at an Ordinary* (or elsewhere) but
presently they are th^other side of the Sea, commending either the Wines of
France, the (...) of Italy, or the Oil and Sallets of Spain.

Some also there are who by their Countenance more than by their Carriage, by
their Diseases, more than by their Discourses, discover themselves to have been
Abroad under hot Climats.

Others have a custom to be always relating strange things and wonders, (of
the humor of Sir John Mandevile) and they usually present them to the Hearers,
through multiplying glasses, and thereby cause the thing to appear far greater
than it is in it self, they make Mountains of Mole-hils, like
Charenton-Bridge-Eccho, which doubles the sound nine times. Such a Traveller
was he, that reported the Indian Fly, to be as big as a Fox; China birds, to be
as big as some Horses, and their Mice to be as big as Monkeys; but they have
the wit to fetch this far enough off, because the Hearer may rather believe it,
than make a voyage so far to disprove it.

Every one knows the Tale of him, who reported he had seen a Cabbage under
whose leafes a Regiment of Soldiers were sheltred from a shower of rain:
Another who was no Traveller (yet the wiser man) said, he had passed by a
place where there were 400 brasiers making of a Cauldron, 200 within, and 200
without, beating the nails in; the Traveller asking for what use that huge
Cauldron was? he told him, Sir it was to boil your Cabbage.

Such another was the Spanish Traveller, who was so habituated to hyperbolize,
and relate wonders, that he became ridiculous in all companies, so that he was
forced at last to give order to his man, when he fell into any excess this
way, and report any thing improbable, he should pull him by the sleeve: The
Master falling into his wonted hyperboles, spoke of a Church in China, that was
ten thousand and yards^ long; his man standing behind and pulling him by the
sleeve, made him stop suddenly: the company asking, I pray Sir, how broad might
that Church be? he replied, but a yard broad, and you may thank my man for
pulling me by the sleeve, else I had made it foure-square for you.

Others have another kind of hyperbolizing vain, as they will say, there is not
a woman in Italy, but wears an Iron girdle next her skin in the absence of her
husband, that for a pistol one may be master of any man's life there; That
there is not a Gentleman in France but has his box of play (...) about him;
That in Germany every one has a rouse in his pate, once a day; That there are
few Dons in Spain that eat flesh once a week, or that has not a Mistress
besides his wife; That Paris has more Courtizans than London honest Women
(which may admit a double sense;) That Sevill is like a chesse-bord table,
having as many Moriscos as Spaniards; That Venice has more Maquerelles, than
Marchands; Portugal more Jews than Christians: whereas i^* is far otherwise,
for the Devil is not so black as he (...) painted, no more are these Noble
Nations and Towns as they are tainted: Therefore one should* Parcere paucorum
diffunder^ crimen in omnes. And it is a generous kind of civility to report
always the best.

Furthermore, there is amongst many others (which were too long to recite here)
an odd kind of Anglicisme* wherein some do frequently express themselves, as
to say Your Boores of Holland, Sir; Your Jesuits of Spain, Sir; Your
Courtisans of Venice, Sir: whereunto one answered (not impertinently) My
Courtisans Sir? Pox on them all for me, they are none of my Courtisans.

Lastly, some kind of Travelers there are, whom their gate and strouting,
their bending in the hammes, and shoulders, and looking upon their legs, with
frisking and singing do speak them Travelers.

Others by a phantastique kind of ribanding themselves, by their modes of habit,
and clothing (and touching variety of clothing, there be certain odd
ill-favored old Prophecies of this Island, which were improper to recite here)
do make themselves known to have breathed foreign air, like Sir Thomas
Moore's) Traveller, whom I will bring here upon the stage. Amicus and Sodalis

Britanniaque natus, altusque Insula:
At cum Brittannos Galliae cultoribus

SEC. XV.
But such Travelers as these may be termed Land-lopers, as the Dutchman
says, rather than Travelers; Such may be said to go out upon such an Arrand,
as we read Saules-son went once out upon; or like the Prodigal son, to feed
upon the husks of strange Countries; or as we read, Aesope traveled to
Istria, thence to Afric^, and sundry other Regions, only to find out the best
Crabs; or like him who came from the furthest parts of Hungary to England, to
eat Oysters: These Travelers in lieu of the Ore of Ophir wherewith they should
come home richly freighted, may be said to make their return in Apes and
Owls, in a cargazon of Complements and Cringes, or some huge monstrous
Periwigs, which is the Golden Fleece they bring over with them.

Such, I say, are a shame to their Country abroad, and their kindred at home,
and to their parents, Benonies, the sons of sorrow: and as Jonas in the Whales
belly, traveled much, but saw little, why, because he was shut up in the body
of that great (aquatique) beast, so these may be said to have been carried up
and down through many Countries, and after a long pererration to and fro, to
return as wise as they went, because their souls were so ill lodged, and shut
up in such stupid bodies: No, an ingenious and discerning Traveller will
disdain this, and strive to distinguish 'twixt good and evil, 'twixt that
which is graceful, and what is phantastique, 'twixt what is to be followed, and
what is to be shunned, and bring home the best: He will strive to be rather
Substance without show, than show without substance: From the Italian he will
borrow his reservednesse, not his jealousy and humor of revenge; From the
French his Horsemanship and gallantnesse that way, with his Confidence, and
nothing else: From the Spaniard his Sobriety, not his lust: From the German
(clean contrary) his Continency, no: his Excess, the other way: From the
Netherland his Industry, and that is all: His heart must still remain English,
though I allow him some choice and change of Habit, Coelum, non animum mutet --
And as the commendablest quality of Oil is to smell of nothing, yet it gives
an excellent relish to many sorts of meats: So he is the discreetest Traveller,
who Savoureth of no affectation; or strangeness, of no exotique modes at all,
after his return, either in his Carriage or Discourse, unless the subject
require it, and the occasion and Company aptly serve for him, to discover
himself, and then an application of his Knowledge abroad, will excellently
season his matter and serve as golden d^shes to serve it in.

If any Forrainer be to be imitated in his manner of Discourse and Comportement,
it is the Italian, who may be said to be a medium 'twixt the Gravity of the
Spaniard, the Heaviness of the Dutch, and Levity of our next Neighbors, for
he seems to allay the one, and quicken the other two; to serve as a buoy to
the one, and a ballast to the other.

France uses to work one good effect upon the English, she uses to take away
the mothers milk (as they say,) that blush, and bashful tincture, which uses
to rise up in the face npon sudden salutes, and enterchange of Complement, and
to enharden one with confidence; For the Gentry of France have a kind of loose
becoming boldness, and forward vivacity in their carriage, whereby they seem to
draw respect from their Superiors and Equals, and make their Inferiors keep
a fitting distance.

In Italy amongst other moral cautions, one may learn not to be over
prodigal of speech when there is no need, for with a nod, with a shake of the
head, and shrug of the shoulder, they will answer to many questions.

One shall learn besides there not to interrupt one in the relation of his
tale, or to feed it with odd interlocutions: One shall learn also not to
laugh at his own jest, as too many use to do, like a Hen, which cannot lay an
egg but she must ca^kle.

Moreover, one shall learn not to ride so furiously as they do ordinarily in
England, when there is no necessity at all for it; for the Italians have a
Proverb, that a gallopping horse is an open sepulcher. And the English
generally are observed by all other Nations, to ride commonly with that speed,
as if they rid for a Midwife, or a Physician, or to get a pardon to save one's
life as he goes to execution, when there is no such thing, or any other
occasion at all, which makes them call England, the Hell of Horses.

In these hot Countries also, one shall learn to give over the habit of an
odd custom, peculiar to the English alone, and whereby they are distinguished
from other Nations, which is, To make still toward the Chimney, though it be
in the Dog-dayes.

SECT. XVI.
LAnguage is the greatest outward testimony of Travel: Yet is it a vain and
verbal Knowledge that rests only in the Tongue; Nor are the observations of
the Eye any thing profitable, unless the Mind draw something from the Externe
object to enrich the Soul withal, to inform to build up and unbeguile the
Inward man, that by the sight of so various objects of Art and Nature, that by
the perlustration of such famous Cities, Castles, Amphitheaters, and Palaces;
some glorious and new, some mouldred away, and eaten by the Iron-teeth of Time,
he come to discern; the best of all earthly things to be but frail and
transitory. That this World at the best is but a huge Inn, and we but
wayfaring men, but Pilgrims, and a company of rambling Passengers. That we
enter first into this World by Travail, and so pass along, with Cries, by
weeping cross: So that it was no improper Character the Wisest of Kings gave
of this life to be naught else but a continual Travel: as the Author crossing
once over the Pyrenes, writ to a Noble friend of his in this distique, Vita
Peregrinans Iter est, sacrapagina monstrat,
Nunc vere vitam, nam peregrinor, ago.


Yet amongst these passengers, some find warm lodgings in this Inn, with fifth
beds, the table plentifully f^rnished, And such is the poorness of some
Spirits, and the narrowness of their Souls, and they are so nailed to the
Earth, that when they are ^lmost at their Iourneyes end, when they
lyewind-bound at the Cape of good Hope, and have one foot in the (...) ready to
go off, with the next Gale to another Country, to their last home: Yet, as the
Orator says, Quo minus viae restat eo plus viatici quaerunt, the less way
remains, the more provision they make still for their journey.

Other Passengers there are, which find but short commons, they are forced to
trudge up and down for a room to lay their heads upon, and would be well
content with a trucklebed, or a mattresse in the garret, for want whereof, they
are often constrained to lie in state against their wills in the Star Chamber,
having the Heaven for their Canopy, and the breasts of their Common Mother for
their pillow.

And it is the high pleasure of Providence this disparity should be'twixt the
Citizens of this World, and that the earth should be divided into such unequal
portions, to leave place for Industry, Labor, and Wit, the Children of
Necessity, and Parents of Virtue, for otherwise, few or none would pourchase
any ground upon Parnassus Hill.

To see the Escuriall in Spain, or the Plate-Fleet at her first arrival; To
see Saint Denis, the late Cardinal-Palace in Richelieu, and other things in
France; To see the Citadell of Antwerp; The New Town of Amsterdam, and the
Forest of Masts, which lie perpetually before her; To see the Imperial, and
stately Hans Towns of Germany; To see the Treasury of Saint Mark, and Arsenall
of Venice; The Mount of Piety in Naples; The Dome and Castle of Milan; The
proud Palaces in and about Genoua, whereof there are two hundred within two
miles of the Town, and not one of the same form of building; To see Saint
Peter's Church, the Vatican, and other magnificent structures in Rome, who in
the case she stands in, may be said to be but her own Tomb, in comparison of
what she has been, being fallen from the Hills to the Plains.

To be able to spoke many Languages, as the Voluble French, the Courtly
Italian, the Lofty Spanish, the Lusty Dutch, the Powerful Latin, the
Scientifique and happily compounding Greek, the most Spacious Slavonique, the
Mystical Hebrew with all her Dialects: All this is but vanity and superficial
Knowledge, unless the inward man be bettered hereby; unless by seeing and
perusing the volume of the Great World, one l^arne to know the Little, which is
himself, unles o^e learn to govern and check the passions, our Domestique
Enemies, then which nothing can conduce more to gentleness of mind, to Elegancy
of Manners, and Solid Wisdom. But principally, unless by surveying and
admiring his works abroad, one improve himself in the knowledge of his Creator,
prae quo quisquiliae caetera; in comparison whereof the best of sublunary
blessings are but bables, and this indeed, this Vnum necessarium, should be the
center to which Travel should tend.

Moreover, one should evertuate himself to bring something home, that may
accrue to the public benefit and ad vantage of his Country, and not to draw
water to his own Mill only; For of those three that the Orator says, challenge
a share in our Nativity, our Country is the first, and our selfs last.
Therefore he should pry into the Policy and municipall Laws of other States
and Cities, and be able to render an account of their government, and by
collation thereof with that of his own, Examine well whether any wholesome
constitution or custom may be applyable to the srame of his own Country.

It is recorded in an ancicient Greek Author, that the famous Ptolomey, he who
conversed and Traveled so much amongst Heavenly bodies, culled out a select
number of his pregnantest young Nobles, and Gentlemen to go to Greece, Italy,
Carthage and other Region^, and the prime Instruction they had in charge, was,
to observe (...) Government, as they Traveled along, and bring back (...) of
the wholesomest Laws out of every Country. Being returned, they related that
in the Roman Republique, a most singular veneration was had of the Temples, a
punctual obed^ence to Governors, and unavoydable punishments inflicted upon
malefactors.

In Carthage, the Senate commanded, the Nobles executed, and the People obeyed.

In Athens the Rich were not suffered to be Extortioners, the Poor idle, nor
the Magistrates ignorant.

In Rhodes Old men were Venerable, Young men modest, and Women solitary and
silent.

In Thebes the Nobles did fight, the Plebeians labor, and Philosophers teach.

In Sicily Justice was entirely administered, Commerce was honestly exercised,
and all enjoyed equal privileges and interest in the State.

Among the Sicionians there were admitted neither Physicians to hinder the
operations of Nature; nor Strangers, to introduce innovations; nor Lawyers, to
multiply Contentions.

These men it seems di^ not go out to see feathers fly in the Air, or Reeds
shaken with the wind, they did not go to get Complements or Cringes, or Carriage
of bodies, or new Modes of clothing, or to tip the tongue with a little
Language only, but they searchd into the solidest and usefullest part of humane
Wisdom, which is policy; And doubtless, that rare wise King made excellent
use of their observations, and rewarded them accordingly: And one of the
happiest advantages to a Monarchy is, to have a discerning and bountiful King
when occasion requires, for Subjects are accordingly active or idle, as they
find their Prince able to judge of their merit and endeavors, and so emp^oy
them; for in the Commonwealth of Letters, and speculative Orb of Virtue, the
benign aspect and iufluence of the Prince, is as Apollo was to the Muses, it
gives a kind of comfortable heat, and illumination, whereby they are cherished
and made vigorous.

The most material use therefore of Foreign Travel is to find out something
that may be applyable to the public utility of one's own Country, as a
Noble Personage of late years did, who observing the uniforme and ^regular way
of stone structure up and down Italy, has introduced that form of building to
London and Westminster, and else where, which though d^stastfull at first, as
all innovations are, For they seem like Bug-beares, or Gorgons heads, to the
vulgar; yet they find now the commodity, firmness, and beauty thereof, the
three maine principles of Architecture.

Another seeing their Dikes, and draynings in the Netherlands, has been a
cause that much has been added, to lengthen the skirts of this Island.

Another in imitation of their aqueducts and sluices, and co^veyance of waters
abroad, brought Ware-water through London streets: And it had been wished so
great and renowned a City had not forgot Him so soon, considering what infinite
advantages redounds to her thereby; for in other Countries I have seen Statues
erected to persons in the most eminentest places (to eternize their memories by
way of gratitude) for Inventions of far lesser consequence to the
encouragement of others, for it is an old Rule of State, and will be in date to
the Worlds end, that Honor nourishes Arts, and is the golden sp^rre of Virtue
and industry.

SECT. XVII.
AMongst many other fruits of Foreign Travel, besides the delightful ideas,
and a thousand various thoughts and self contentments and self contentments
and inward solaces, it raises in the memory of things past, this is one: That
when one has seen the Tally and taillage of France, the Millstone of Spain,
the Assise of Holland, the Gabels of Italy, where one cannot bring an Egg, or
root to the market, but the Prince his part lies therinna: When he has felt
the excess of heat, the dangerous Serains, the Poverty of soil in many
places, the Homeliness and incommodity of lodging, the course clothing of the
best sort of Peasants, their wooden shoes, and straw hats, their Canvas
breeches, and Buckram petticoates, their meager fare, feeding commonly upon
Grass, Herbs, and Roots, and drinking Water, near the condition of brute
animals, who find the cloth always ready laid, and the buttry open: When he
has observed what a hard shift some make to hew out a dwelling in the holes
of the Rocks; others to dig one under the Sea; when he feels, how in some
Climes the Heaven is as Brass, in others as a dropping Sponge; in others as a
great Bellows, most part of the year; how the Earth, in many places is ever
and anon sick of a fit of the Palsy; When he sees the same Sun which only
cherishes and gently warmes his Country men, half parboyle and tanne other
people, and those rays which scorch the adusted soyles of Calabria and Spain,
only varnish and guild the green hony-suckled plains and hillocks of England;
When he has observed what hard shifts some make to rub out in this world in
diverse Countries, What speed Nature makes to finish her course in them; How
their best sort of women after forty, are presently superannuated, and look
like another Charing-Crosse, or Carackes that have passed the Line in three
voyages to the Indies: When he has observed all this, At his return home,
he will bless God, and love England better ever after, both for the Equality
of the Temper in the Clime, where there is no where the like, take all the
Seasons of the year together, (though some would wish She might be pushed a
little nearer the Sun:) For the free condition of the subject, and equal
participation of the Wealth of the Land, for the unparallelled accommodation of
lodging, and security of Travel, for the admirable hospitality, for the
variety and plenty of all sorts of firm food, for attendance and cleanliness,
for the rare fertility of Shore and Sea, of Air, Earth, and Water, for the
longevity, well favourednesse and innated honesty of the people: And above all;
for the moderation and decency in celebrating the true service of God, being
far from Superstition one way, and from Profaneness the other way, (though
(with a quaking heart, I speak it) there have been strange insolences
committed of late) I say, when he has well observed all this, he will sing,
as once I did to a Noble friend of mine from Denmarque, in this Sapphique:
Dulcior fumus Patriae, forensi
Fla^mula, vino, praeit unda, terrae
Herba Brita^nae, mage tra^smarino Flore suavis.


SECT. XVIII.
HAving thus tasted of so many waters, and been Salted in the World abroad,
and being safely restored to the bosom of his own Country, his next course
should be, to settle himself awhile in one of the Innes of Court, (which he
may do and yet be a Courtier besides) to understand something of the Common
Laws of England, which are the inheritance of every subject, as also of the
constitutions and Orders of the House of Parliament, the most indifferent, most
wholesome, and Noblest way of Government in the World, both in respect of King
and People: It being the greatest glory of a King, to be King of a free and
well-crested people, and the greatest glory of a People to be under a Crown so
embellished with Flowers, and sparckling with such ancient and sacred gemmes of
Royal Prerogatives: Yet to be under no Law but of their own making, to be
the Setters of the great Dyall of the Commonwealth themselves. To be subject
to no Ordinance, to no Contribution or Tax, but what is granted in that great
Epidemicall Counsel, wherein every one from the Peer to the Plebeian has an
inclusive Vote. And if every degree high and low, both in Town and Country is
there represented by their Subsistutes; it were a hard measure (under
correction, I humbly speak it) if the Levites, the best of all professions,
who besides the holiness of their function (as having charge of the Nobler
half of man, of that which should guide and regulate the Understanding in
making of all Laws, I mean the Conscience) do make a considerable part of the
People of the Kingdom, should be thence excluded; for though it be
inconsistent with their calling to have hands to execute, yet they may well
have heads to consult in that great National Senate: It were a hard case, I
say, if those great Lights, which were used to shine with that brightness to
the Envy (not the reproach or Scandal of any that I know of) of all other
Reformed Churches, should be now put in wooden Candlesticks: That those
Promotions, Endowments, and Honors, which our well disposed Progenitors
provided, to nourish the Arts, and serve as Spurs to Learning and Zeal,
should now be cut off, as if they served only for Stirrops to Pride. There
being no professions, but have certain steps of rising up, and degrees of
Promotion for their encouragement to make men aemulari meliora. And he who has
spent the vigor of his years and Intellectuals in the Lords Vineyard, it may
well become him (having served, as it were, his year of Iubile) to have his
gray hairs dignified with some Honor and Authority, with reward and rest in
his old age, and by his long experience and pains to see that other painful
Laborers be put into the Vineyard, yet to have his hand often on the Plough
himself. If there be a thief in the Candle, (as we use to say commonly)
there is a way to pull it out; and not to put out the Candle, by clapping an
Extinguisher presently upon it; If these Lights grow dim, there is a Trienniall
Snuffer for them: If these Trees bear not good fruit, or shoot forth any
Luxuriant boughs, they are sure to feel the Pruning iron once every three
years.

In the name of God, let these Lights be brought to move within the
circumference of their own Orbs, and be kept from irregular and eccentrique
motions, And I am confident it will render them less obnoxious to Envy and
Scandal, and draw upon them a greater opinion of Reverence.

There is a Castle in the grand Caire in Egypt, called the Nilescope, where
there stands a Pillar with certain marks to observe the height of the River
of Nile, at her annual inundation (which falls out precisely about the Summer
Solstice) if the stream come to be higher or lower than such marks, it
portends dearth, but if at highest flood it rest about the middle, it is an
infallible presage of a plentiful year: So we may say of these great Streams
that are appointed to water the Lords Field, they must not swell too high, nor
must they run in too low a Channel: And as humility is the fairest gemme that
can shine in a Prelates Miter, so the greatest badge of a well devoted Soul, is
to reverence the Dispensers of the sacred Oracles of God, the Ghostly Fathers,
and Governors of the Church, (which in analogy to the Triumphant in Heaven,
has also her degrees of Hierarchy.) For besides Revenue there is a Veneration,
due to this holy function, and it were no hard matter to produce a Gran Jury of
examples both Humane and Divine, that where this Reverence failed, it has been
a symptom, and an infallible presage of a declining State, or some approaching
judgment.

But I hope I shall never live to see the day that the Noble English Nation,
who have been so renowned all the world over, and cried up for their exemplary
Piety, as well as Prowess, will undervalue themselves so far, and grow
distrustful or conscious of their own judgments, their own wonted Worth,
and Ability so far, as to think those Nations (who have not means to make the
Church shine with that luster) to be Wiser than they, or to out go them in
zeal, as to receive laws for the Conscience, and form of serving God from
those, who have been far behind them, both in the first Reception of
Christianity and the Reformation thereof -- Proh pudor -- I will not say, by
what I heard muttered abroad, it will be accounted a National diminution, but
if it should fo fall out, it is no hard matter to be a Prophet, yea, by what
has passed already, to take a plain prospect of those Anarchicall confusions,
and fearful calamities, which will inevitably ensue both in Church and State;
unless with the pious care which is already taken to hinder the great Beast to
break into the Vineyard; there be also a speedy course taken to fence Her from
other Vermin, and lesser Animals (the belluam multorum capitum) which begin to
brouze her leaves, to throw down her hedges, and so lay her open to wast,
spoil and scorn: Unless there be a course taken, I say, to suppress those
petty Sectaries, which swarm so in every corner, with that connivence (to the
amazement of all the world, and disparagement of so well a policed Kingdom)
who by their capricious and various kind of gingling fancies in serving God, do
their best to bring in the opinion of the Pagan Philosopher (Themistius)
delivered once to Valens the Emperor, That as God Almighty had infused into his
handmaid Nature, a diversity of operations, and that the beauty of the Universe
consisted in a proportion of so many differing things, so he was delighted to
see himself served by various and sundry kinds of worship and invocations.

In all humbleness, (and with submission of censure) I desire to be dispensed
withal for this excursion out of my first intended subject, but I hope the
digression will prove no transgression, in regard the quality of the matter is
such, that every one has a share and interest in it, and should be sensible,
when that Liturgy and Church is vilified, wherein he has received his Birth
and Baptism, and by whose compass he steeres his course to Heaven: When the
Windows come down (and the chief Pillars threatened) the House must needs be in
danger of falling, and he is worthy to be called a Niding, one, the pulse of
whose soul beats but faintly toward Heaven, as having taken but weak
impressions of the image of his Maker, who will not run and reach his hand to
bear up his Temple.

SEC. XIX.
IN the Inns of Court, where I left my returned Traveller, he will be
acquainted with Westminster Hall, with the courses of pleading in the Courts of
Judicature, by which Knowledge, he may learn how to preserve his own, for, for
want of some experience herein, many have mightily suffered in their estates,
and made themselves a prey to their sollicitors and Agents: Nor indeed is he
capable to bear any Rule or Office in Town or Country, who is utterly
unacquainted with John an Oaks, and John a Styles, and with their Terms.

Having been thus settled awhile at home, if business and the quality of his
life will permit, he may make one flying journey over again, and in one
Summer review all those Countries, which he had been forty Months a seeing
before: And as the second thoughts are held the wisest, so a second survey is
more exact, and of a more retentive virtue, and amongst other benefits, it will
infinitely improve one in his language. Noah's Dove brought the branch of Olive
in her Bill, at her Second journey; from the latter end of Mars, to the
beginning of October, one may leasurely traverse France, cross the Pyreneys,
the Mediterranean, and the Alps, and so return either through Germany or
through France again, and thence come home through the Netherlands: But being
(bis Redux) returned the second time, let him think no more of Foreign
Iourneys, unless it be by command, and upon public service.

Now to find entertainment for his hours of leisure at home, he may amongst
other studies, if his inclination leads him that way, apply himself to the
most material and useful parts of the Mathematiques, as the Art of Navigation
and Fortification. The study of the Mathematiques is abstruse, and therefore
they require a ripe and well-seasoned judgment, they have this property, to
make a dull capacity acute, and an acute capacity dull, if he falls unto the^
too soon: which makes us to be censured abroad in the method of our studies in
England, to make green wits not yet half coddled as it were, to fall too early
to such profound notio^s in our Universities, as putting children to stand too
soon upon their legs.

For Conclusion, in this variety of studies and divertisme^ts, I will give him
this Caution, that he fall not into the hands of the Alchymist, for though
there be a world of rare conclusions, and delightful experiments (most useful
and proper for Physicians) to be found in Chemistry which makes many to be so
enchanted therewith (that being got once in, they have not power to get out
again) Yet I never knew any yet, who made the benefit countervaile the charge;
but I have known many melt themselves to nothing (like Icarus wings melted,
when he attempted the Art of flying) And while they labor so with the sweat of
their brows to blow the cole, and bring gold over the helm, they commonly make^
shipwreck of their own fortunes. Et bona dilapidant omnia pro lapide.

And the reason well may be, that it is doubted, whether such undertakings, be
pleasing to God Almighty or no, for though Art be Nature's Ape, and is found to
perfect her in some things: Yet, it may well be termed a kind of Presumption
in man (by fetching down the Planets and damning them as criminals to certain
Metals) to attempt the transmutation of one species into another, as it were
against the first ordinance of the Creator, and the primitive intent of Nature,
whose handmaid she is, in the Production of all Elementary bodies: Therefore
to be led into a kind of fools Paradis, and a conceit of the
Philosophers-Stone, and to spend much money in Chemistry, he shall never have
the advice of*
