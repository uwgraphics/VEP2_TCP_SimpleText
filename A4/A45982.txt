AN ACT For the Enlargement of the Periods of Time. Limited in an Act for the
better execution of his Majesty's gracious Declaration for the Settlement of
his Kingdom of Ireland, etc.
WHereas in an Act made this present Parliament, entitled, An Act For the
better Execution of his Majesty's Gracious Declaration for the Settlement of
his Kingdom of Ireland, and satisfaction of the several interests of
Adventurers, Soldiers, and others his Majesty's Subjects there, several
Periods of time are appointed and limited for the proceeding upon, determining
and settling of the Interests of sundry Persons who are provided for by the said
Act, and for the payment of such Sums of Moneys as are to be paid unto His
Majesty, or others by His appointment; and for that by reason of the retarding
of the Execution of the said Act, by some emergent occasions which have
intervened, it may so fall out, that the times so appointed by the said Act,
may not be long enough for the due and orderly performance and determination of
those things, for which by the said Act they were limited, and thereby much
prejudice may arise to several persons and interests therein concerned; Be it
therefore Enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present
Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, that the Lord
Lieutenant, or other Chief Governor or Governors of this Kingdom, and six or
more of the Council for the time being, as occasion shall require, may by Act
or Acts of Council from time to time to be made, enlarge all or any of the said
several Periods of time in and by the said Act appointed, so far as they in
their wisdoms shall find necessary. Provided, That none of the said Periods of
time be so enlarged beyond the space of twelve months in the whole, next
ensuing from and after the several and respective times whereunto by the said
Act they are limited. And forasmuch as there is not any time limited for the
Determining and settling of some other particulars mentioned in the said Act,
which may very much obstruct the Settlement intended; Be it therefore Enacted
by the Authority aforesaid, That the Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief Governor
or Governors of this Kingdom and Council as aforesaid, may by Act or Acts of
Council from time to time to be made, limit and appoint such Period or Periods
of time for the adiudging, determining and settling of the Qualifications of
innocent Protestants and Papists, and the reprizing of such persons as shall be
removed thereupon, as they in their judgments shall think fit; so as the said
Period or Periods of time so limited, do not exceed the space of twelve months
next, after the first sitting of the Commissioners appointed for the putting of
the said Act in execution, upon the execution of the said Act. And it is by the
Authority aforesaid further Enacted and Declared, That the Period or Periods of
time which shall be limited, and the said Periods of time which shall be
enlarged by virtue of this Act, in such manner as aforesaid, shall be as good
and effectual to all intents and purposes, as if the same had been particularly
inserted into, and appointed by the said Act, any thing in the said Act
contained to the contrary notwithstanding. And be it further Enacted by the
Authority aforesaid, That no Letters Patents passed under the Great Seal of
England or Ireland, to any person or persons whatsoever, of any Lands,
Tenements, or Hereditaments settled upon, or confirmed unto, or intended to be
settled upon, or confirmed unto Sir Theophilus Jones Knight, his Heirs and
Assigns, by his Majesty's gracious Declaration of the thirtieth of November,
One thousand six hundred and sixty, recited in one Act of Parliament,
entitled, An Act for the better execution of his Majesty's gracious
Declaration for the settlement of his Kingdom of Ireland, and satisfaction of
the several Interests of Adventurers, Soldiers, and other his Subjects there,
shall be of any force or validity to hinder the said Sir Theophilus Jones, his
Heirs or Assigns, from inioying the full benefit intended to the said Sir
Theophilus Jones, his Heirs and Assigns, by his Majesty's said Declaration* Any
thing in the said Act contained to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.

FINIS.
