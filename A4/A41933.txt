GREAT NEWS FROM The King OF POLAND: OR An Intercepted Letter from TONY, the
first King of POLAND, to the Reverend Salamanca Doctor.
Poland October 27. 1682. Reverend Doctor,
SINCE your first discovery of your Horrid, Phanatical, Damnable, Popish Plot,
I have not been sensible of so much Grief, as at present lies upon my disturbed
and discomposed Spirits, not only in regard that I am deprived of the happiness
of your Person, which ever afforded much assistance to me in all exigences; the
appearance of those worthy Patriots, which I fear I shall never see, so happily
met, again, but also of those my beloved Associating-Friends with whom you
Know, we used to Cabal it from Tavern to Tavern: But however though I am at
present deprived of that happiness, yet I wait with Patience, knowing that it
is not impossible but the Stars may have the same Revolutions in 82 as they had
in 41. And in the Interim, shall beg your Correspondence, which, I know, you
would easily afford me, did you imagine how I simpathize with you in sorrow for
the discovery of our well begun-Associating-Intrigue; But to use the expression
of our Proto-Martyr College (Pardon me, now I remember my self, it was of that
Arch-Traytor Coleman) there is no trust in man, especially in those Zealous
Lewis's, and those Tory Irish Blades: Yet pardon me, if you imagine, that I
should herein reflect upon you (whom I have ever found a fast and Elbow-Friend)
for it is only those before mentioned, whose mouths I thought I had sowed up:
And as a mark of my thankfulness to you herein, I now return you my thanks for
it, and if I can pleasure you by way of Chapplin (though I hope our late large
Contributions are not yet all spent) give me notice and I shall not be
unmindful: And since I have more reason and am more able to discribe an upstart
Courtier (as being, you know, a Relation of mine) I have therefore taken that
Trouble upon me; first in regard I had nothing else in my thoughts to send you;
Secondly that you might know him, and consequently avoid him, which (desiring
you would communicate it to my Dearest Friends) take as follows, viz.

A True Character of an Upstart Courtier.
HE is a person whose Sense, most commonly, consists in Seent; whose actions
and Gestures, are nothing but Cringes; whose Breath is an Airy Complement; and
whose Rind (like that of the Cinnamon-Tree) is worth all his Body besides: The
height of his Ambition, is to receive Instructions from Coranto's and
Play-Bills; these Notions must regulate the whole Course of his Living. He
never knew what Credit or Reputation meant, further than Running on Score: His
Tongue is Gentleman-usher to his Wit, and ever goes before it: He presses into
the highest Places, thrusts himself upon the greatest Businesses, but ever
falls off with some palpable disgrace to himself. He is wonderful Exceptious
and Choleric, where he sees men are loath to give him an occasion, yet you
cannot pacify him better than by Quarrelling with him: He uses the fine
Rhetoric of Cloths to gain esteem, for they are both his Imprimis and his
Item: His whole Body goes upon Screws, and his Face is the Vice that moves
them; his Skin is Tanned in Civit, and all his Behaviors are Printed: The
chief burden of his Brain is the Carriage of his Body, and the setting of his
Face in good Frame, which he performs the better, because he is not Disjoynted
with other Meditations: Associates he has from all Quarters and of all
Qualities too, save good: He is but the Sign of a Man, for he is made of
nothing but Antic Cloths and Cringes. He is a Mushroom-Gentleman that shoots
up in a Night to Honor and Preferment. In the speculation of his good Parts,
his Eyes, like a Drunkard, sees all double; and his Fancy like an Old Man's
Spectacles, makes a great Letter in a small Print: He is one that weighs his
Breath between his Teeth, and dares not smile beyond a Point for fear he should
unstarch his Look: He had rather the whole Kingdom should be troubled than an
Hair out of order about him: He is ever in the slavery of Ceremony and
Complements, for he varies his Face as Seamen do their Compass. If it be true
that the Giants e're made War with Heaven he had been a fit Ensign-bearer to
that Company, whose thoughts fly a pitch above ambition. Every hot fancy and
passion is the Signal that sets him Forward, and his reason ever comes in the
Rear. All foreign Vices are Naturalized to him, for he makes them all his own
by Imitation: He is the very sum and abstract of Lechery, and (without the
assistance of a well-made Tap) certainly expires in Cupids Flames: He is
persuaded that it is as Imposseble to find a Chaste Man, as it is to throw a
Drop of Water into the Sea, and take it thence unmingled, since he is so bad
himself, as to make no scruple to Court any thing that carries the Face of a
She: All his behaviors are so rediculous that they are enough to make
Heraclitus (were he in being) burst into a Laughter to behold them: As to his
Extraction he is Son to Crysalaus, who (as the Poets tell us) being invited to
the Wedding of Jupiter and Juno, went thither bravely attended, rarely
accoutred, Rich in Golden Attires and Gay Robes, but otherwise an Ass, the Gods
seeing him come in such State and Pomp, rose up to give him Place; Exhabitu
hominem metientes, but Jupiter knowing what he was, Immediately turned him into
a Butter-Fly: Murders to him are but resolute Acts, and Dammes, matters of
small Consequence: All his Words are steeped in Oil, for he ever commends to
you, first what he knows you like, and has always some absurd History of your
Enemy, and then wonders how your two Opinions should so Jump together in one
Man: He is an unnecessary Letter in the Alphabet of Creatures, and the Cipher
in Natures Arithmetic, and in the Accounts of all good Men: By this time he
may be grown so Notorious for private, though Damnable, Associations and
cunning Insinuations (by the help of a little of your Salamanca Divinity) that
he must either Fly his Country or submit to the Ax or Halter.

To Conclude, he is a Glorious Fool, his greatest Pride consisting in the
Rattling of his Silks, a Gaudy nothing, having a Pedlers Pack, and a
Brokers-Shop about him, and as his Life has been Odious to All, so his End is
commiserated by Few. Thus with my Dear Respects to all my
Quondam-Associating-Friends, either at Russels-Ordinary, or at the
Exchange-Sun-Tavern. I Rest,

Your much obliged Friend. TONY
