London, Printed for Edw. Husband, Printer to the Honorable House of Commons,
July 28. 1645.

To the Honorable William Lenthall Esquire, Speaker of the House of Commons.
Mr. Speaker,
I Dipatched hence Letters yesterday to the Committee of both Kingdoms, which
gave some account of Gods Blessing upon our endeavors, in the Storm of
Bridgewater: On Monday morning last, we gained that part of the Town which lies
on this side the River, and therein above 600. prisoners, diverse Officers of
quality, and two piece of Ordinance: The Enemy fired that part of the Town,
wherein we were immediately, after our entrance, which continuing all that day,
and the next night, burned down all the houses, except two or three; Yesterday,
perceiving an obstinate resolution in the Enemy not to yield the Town, I was
forced to use those extreamities for the Reducing of it, which brought them
immediately to a Parley, and in short to yield the Town, upon no other terms
then bare Quarter: We entered the Town this day, finding great store of Arms
and Ammunition, thirty eight piece of Ordnance, above one thousand Prisoners,
and amongst them, diverse persons of great quality, as you will perceive by the
List enclosed. I have not much time to spend here, and therefore did immediately
dispose the Command of it for the present, to Col: Birche, as Governor,
wherein I doubt not of your Approbation: And I believe the Commissioners of the
Army will offer something further concerning him, for the future settlement of
the place: He is a Gentleman of known worth and integrity, and his Regiment at
present with Major General Massey, and I believe, will with Gods blessing,
give you a good account of it: There was found in the Town, a Commission from
Prince Charles, to one Philips a Gentleman of this County, to raise a Regiment
of Clubmen (which I have sent by Mr. Peter's.) I am very desirous to give some
encouragement to the Army for their many services, and especially for their
honest and sober demeanor this day toward the Prisoners and Town, in
refraining that violence and injury, which has oftentimes brought dishonor
upon most of the Armies in this Kingdom, which may be an encouragement to them
in the like for the future: I make no doubt but you will be well satisfied in
what I shall do, and I assure you, it shall be with as little burden to the
State as may be: I beseech you, Sir, take into your consideration the
necessities of the Army for a speedy supply of money, clothes, and other
Provisions, wherewith this Bearer Master Peter's will more particularly acquaint
you; who can likewise inform you more largly in all particulars of this late
Action, then I can now write, I remain

Your most Humble Servant THO: FAIRFAX.
