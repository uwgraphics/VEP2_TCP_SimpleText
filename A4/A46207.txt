WHEREAS We are informed by John Stepney Esquire who is the only Party to the Earl
of Ranelagh, and Partners Contract that appears here to Act on the place, that
several Sheriffs and Collectors within the respective Counties of this Kingdom,
have received by Virtue of his Majesty's Process, diverse considerable sums of
Money due to His Majesty, and which belongs to the said Earl and Partners
Undertaking, some of whom have accounted lately in the Exchequer, but not paid
in the Money due from them, and others have not as yet accounted; upon
consideration whereof, We think fit by this Our Proclamation, to require such
of the said Sheriffs and Collectors who have accounted, with all convenient
speed, and at furthest, by the Tenth day of the next Term, to pay the Money in
their respective hands into his Majesty's Treasury, and such of them as have
not accounted, that they do before the end of the said Term make up their
Accounts, and pay such Moneys as they have, or shall by that time receive into
his Majesty's Treasury, as aforesaid, to the end, the same may be applied to
the Uses of the said Undertaking.
