A LOOKING-GLASS FOR The Lord Chancellor; OR, A Brief Summary of some of his
Notorious Crimes.
WHat horrid guilt surpised the Man,
That in each cause still won the day;
Who always used to lead the Van,
And knew no Justice to Obey.
That he should leave the glorious Court,
The Splendid Place of his Resort,
Where he had all things at Command,
To fly into another Land?
It was because a Monarch Great,
A Mighty Prince, a Protestant,
Was come to Rectify the State
Of England, by a Parliament.
Which Settlement he did abhor,
Who was a Traitor to the Crown;
Advised the King the Laws to mar,
To pull the Rights and Charters down.
He always sided with the Times,
Being guilty of Notorious Crimes;
Gave Counsel to himself and fled,
For fear the Law should reach his Head.
Tho Vengeance suffered not to fly,
But filled his Conscience full of guilt,
And loudly after him did Cry,
For all the Blood that he had Spilt:
Being Apprehended, back was brought,
For all the Evil he had wrought;
Committed Prisoner, on Tower Hill,
His Dream in order to fulfill:
Which Dream Presaged his fatal Woe,
That first Advanced he should be high,
Even next unto the Crown but two,
At last be Hanged in shame to dye.
The two first has already been,
As Oats did at the Bar declare,
When wrongfully he Sentenced him,
Who bid him of the Third beware.
The King may cry, Alas, Alas,
By's Evil Counsel I Am undone,
Which I too often did Embrace,
A Fatal Shaking to my Throne:
The Citizens may Curse the Day
That ever Nature gave him Breath,
And loudly Cry, Away, away
With such a fellow from the Earth;
Who doomed was unto Disgrace,
Before the Parliament, was brought
Upon his knees, when in his place
Great Misdemeanors he had wrought:
Who smothered the whole Popish Plot,
That Godfrey's Death might be forgot:
Who did Invade our Charters Right,
And in our Ruin did delight:
Who abhorred all Petitioning
When we His Majesty did Entreat,
Insinuating to the King
To pull us down, we were too great.
He also (as says the Records)
When on the Bench gave his Consent,
To Bail out all the Popish Lords,
Although Impeached by Parliament.
Who did against Lord Russel plead,
And Sentenced him to Death severe;
A Valiant Protestant indeed,
Against whom nothing was found clear.
He Worthy Cornish doomed to dye,
Tho he would committed no Offense,
And like a Villain, Treacherously
His Jury against him did incense.
When Noble Essex in the Tower
Was Murdered by a Barbarous hand,
He to the utmost of his Power
Did its Discovery withstand.
Nay more, this barbarous Murder he
(Which never ought to be forgot)
Proof against Lord Russel made to be,
That he was guilty of a Plot.
He Murdered Innocents in the West,
And did the bood of Thousands spill,
Caused those inhumane deaths to taste,
Who had been far from doing ill:
This Bawling fellow made a sport
Of Scoffing Men out of their own,
And got a Name at last in Court,
By Bawling Jefferies to be known.
Innumerable were his Crimes,
Half which this Paper cannot relate,
For all his Evils done at times,
He must be Sacrificed to the State.
The Man that Judged in every Cause,
And yet did Justice unto none,
Must stand Indicted by our Laws,
And as a Prisoner, Plead his own:
A Fatal Fall from Bench to Bar,
The just demerit of his Crimes,
Which will his Honor greatly mar,
By Changing Laws, has Changed Times.
He needs not Counsel for to Fee,
His Judges all will do him Right,
He Council for himself may be,
And keep his Guine^s out of sight,
Until the Hangman do appear
To do him Justice on Tower Hill,
Where greatest Shouts will fill the Sphere,
When Jefferies does his Dream fulfill.
FINIS.
