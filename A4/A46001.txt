ORMONDE.

ALL persons that shall have occasion to prefer any Petitions to Us, are to
take notice, That to such of their Petitions as shall come to the hands of Our
Secretary Sir George Lane, they may expect Our Answer, and receive the same
within four days after the delivery of the said Petitions at the said Sir
George his Office under the Council Chamger near the Custom-house, whereupon
all parties may depend, if extraordinary Occasions shall not intervene, which
may hinder Us from giving audience to Petitions. And in the mean time
Petitioners are to forbear troubling themselves in calling for their Petitions.
And they are further to take notice that when Petitions shall be answered, they
shall be delivered out at the Offices of the Secretaries under the said
Council Chamger, and not, in the Castle; neither are any Petitioners to resort
to the Castle for them, nor by their unseasonable solicitations to hinder Our
Secretaries from the dispatch of the businesses committed to their charge.

Given at His MAJESTY'S Castle of Dublin, the 29. day of August, 1662.
God save the King.
