LONDON, Printed for I. Wright in the Old baily, August 27. 1644.

July 23. 1644. A Relation of the late Expedition made by Generall-major
Monroe; with the Army of the united British Protestant Forces, within the
Province of Vulster in the Kingdom of IRELAND. Begun the 27 of June, and ended
the 15 of July, 1644.
IT being unanimously agreed, that so many of the British Forces in Ulster as
could be spared from their Garrisons, as well as the Regiments of the Scottish
Army, should march out under the conduct of Generall-major Monroe, to seek out
the Army of the Irish Rebel^ (wheresoever they could be found,) who not
satisfied with the innumerable barbarous and bloody murders, and other
villainies that they have committed since the beginning of this execrable
rebellion, have ever since they obtained the Cessation of Arms been preparing
an Army of their choicest men, out of all the Provinces of this Kingdom to
invade Vlster, and to destroy all the Protestants therein^ as by good
intelligence from time to time, and by several D^clarations, Lette^s, and
O^^ers of their prime Leaders, which has come to our ha^d^, has pl^i^ly been
made appear. By Order therefore from ^he Ge^^^^ll-m^jor, a party of the Forces
under the command of ^h^ (...) ^^untgom^ry of the Ardes, the Lord V^scount of
Cl^^^^^^, (...) of ^he F^c^^ un^er the command of Sir Iam^^ (...) K^^g^ and
C^lon^ll ^ei^g all of the V^lst^^ B^i^tish for (...) a p^^t of the
G^nerall-majors own R^giment and T^oop o^ horse, and of the E^^le of Lind^ayes
regiment, and of Co^onel Him h^^ ^^giment, an^ of Colonel James Mountgomeries
regiment, being all of the Scottish Army, were appointed to have their
rend^z^ze within a mile o^ Lisnega^vie the 27 day of J^ne last, upon the 28
there marched from thence to Drummor seven Colors of the regiment of Foot,
under the command of the Lord Viscount Mountgomery, and himself in person with
them, and two Troops of horse, the one whereof belong^d to Captain George
Mountgomery, the other to the Lord Viscount himself, and both under this
command. T^ere were also five Colors out of the Lord Coudeboys regiment of
Foot, commanded by some C^ptaines of that regiment; and the said Lord
Cloudeboys his Troop, commanded by his Lieutenant; and Sir James Mountgomery
his Troop of horse, and seven Colors out o^ hi^ Regiment of Foot, commanded
by himself in person; And out of four Scotch regiments: there were six
colors out of the Earl of Lindsays regiment, sev^n out of Colonel Hu^^s
commanded by his Lieutenant colonel, seven of Colonel Iam^s Mountg^meries
commanded by himself, and eight out of the Gen^rall-m^j^r^ own regiment of
Foot, together with his Troop of Hor^e: We arived at Ardmagh upon the 30 of
June, where Colonel Hill his regiment of horse, consisting of five Troops met
us, commanded in chief by M^jor George Royden, and also the Lord Conawayes
Troop, commanded by C^ptaine Bruff; and a part of the Lord Crumwels Troop,
commanded by his Lieutenant; and also five Colors of the Lord Conaways
regiment of Foot, commanded by the Lord Bleny his Lieutenant-colonell, and
Major Jones. Upon the first of July came there also a part of the Earl of
Argiles regiment, a part of the Generals regiment, a part of the Earl of
Glancarnes regiment, and also three Troops of horse, all commanded b^ their
several Lieutenant-colonels, and with them also five Colou^ of Sir John
Clotworthys regiment, commanded by Major O Conelly, and other Captains. There
met us also Sir Robert Stewart, and his whole regiment of Foot, and Troop of
horse, and Colonel Merveine with his regiment; and nine Colors of Sir William
Stewarts regiment of Foot commanded by his Lieutenant-colonell, his Major, an^
o^h^^ C^ptaines, whereof two were his sons; and also his Tro^pe of horse
co^mm^ed by his Lieutenant. There were there also four Companies ^ut of
Lond^n-derry, under the conduct of several Captaine^; and a commanded company
of M^squitiers ^ut of Sir W^^^^am C^l^s regiment from Eneskilline, led by
Captain Ross^ and his Troop of horse, commanded by his Lieutenant; there were
also some more Troop^. The horse in all confuted of 22 Standards^ and were
reckoned to 1000 Horse; and the Foot of 110 Colors mak^ng good 10000 Foot,
marching in rank^ and file, bende^ two thou^^nd Soldiers more that attended
the baggage. All our Soul^^^^ ^f the army carried ten days victuals in
Oatemeale upon their bac^es, besides their Arms; and ten days more was
carried upon b^gg^ge horses; more we could not car^y, nor other shi^t we could
not make, for want of carriage horses, and other accomodations ^or a march: and
all this twenty days victuals for the Soldiers did not ^xceed 24 pound weight
of O^temeale, without any other supply of meat or drink but Water.

Being thus joined together, all under the command of the Generall-major, we
marched through the C^unties of Ardm^gh, Monagoon, and Cavan, to the uttermost
confines of Vulster, without finding any opposition at all. As we marched from
Cluvice to Cavan the fifth day of July, a party of horse of Colonel Hills
regiment that were sent out upon our right hand toward Belturbet, found some
houses standing in it, but new deserted, and some store of Beer, and Aquavitae
in them, for their present use; and not far from thence in a Church they found
that the people of the Country had carried good store of their household
stuff, and there they found also some Beer and Aquavitae and some S^cke,
which the Earl of Castlehaven had sent for his own provision before him, who
they learned was then at Granard in the County of Longford, with his army;
where he and General Owen Mac Art O Neale (as was reported) were to mee^ to
come down to destroy all the Protestants in Vulster.

Being then come to Cavan, we resolved to march out of V^l^^e^ with the army to
Granard the next day, being 12 miles from Cava^^ Sir Will. Stewart, Sir Robert
Stewart, and Sir Will. Coals Troop^ were sent before, who killed in Granard
about 60 of the rebels, and g^t son seven or eight score Cowes, and had a
light skirmish with some of their Troops by the way, with the loss of one man
only; but the E. of Castlehaven with his Army having been almost three weeks
in that County, and himself lying at a pretty Town called Ballenely four
miles from Granard, and the most part of his Cavalrey quartered at the Town of
Longford, General Owen, Mac Art O Neale no^ being then come to Granard the
first randezvouz, the Earl getting intelligence of our approach, did the very
night before retire with his whole forces out of that Country, and c^ossed the
river of the Evey into Weast-meath to a strong hold called Partlester, where
the Lord Moore was killed the last yeare^ And left all the passes upon the
river well manned, bridges and C^st^es being at each pass, and did write to
general Ow^n O Neale, to meet him with all expedition with all his forces,
and as we were then informed their next rand^z^ouz was to have been at Kells in
East-meath. We having rested at Granard upon the Sabbath day being the 7. of
July, we sent out and burnt the Towns of B^llynlie, and Longford, where the
rebels had quartered, and all the Castles that were of any avail to them all
which they wholly deserted, not one man staying within the Country, except such
as hid themselves in Islands. At one of the chiefest of the passes upon the Evey
water, is the bridge of Fyna, where the Earl of Weast-meaths Castle is at the
end of it, about two miles from Granard, There the Earl of Castle-Heav^n had
put 200 musketeers, and three troops of horse, whereof his own lifegard was
one; It hapened that Major Royden with seven English Troops were quartered
near unto that place, who orderly seting out his gards and scouts got the
Alarm several times given him by the rebels horse from the Castle upon the
Sunday, who when the rest horsed, and strengthened their guards did still
retire to the Castle; At last about 12 of the Clock Major Royden expecting that
they would stand and skirmish drew to them with his Troops, but they retired,
yet espying 5 or 6 of their horsemen riding to the top of a hill about half a
mile from the Castle; whereupon he sent out Captain Brauff with six well horsd
men, who endeavored to g^^ betwixt them and the Castle, which the rebels
perceiving rod hard, and being nearer, gained the pass and stopped; Then one
of them tearming himself a Captain, called to our men to know if there were
ever a Captain amongst them, who durst change a pair of bullets with him;
Captain Bruff with his men seeming to retire slowly, the enemy followed him
out; whereupon he upon a sudden whel'd about with his men and charged them, and
having discharged their Carbines, the rogues took the flight; Captain Bruffe
charged home near to the pass the chief man of them he run him quite threw the
body with his rapier, and killed him, and so retired himself and his men
without hurt, and had no more alarms that night; The next morning Sir William
Stewarts Troop, Sir William Coals, and Sir Robert Stewarts had the Van and
marched before the Army, three Troops of the rebels horse came out and
skermished with their Troops and scouts, (and had four Troops more in
readiness to second them,) for upon the Sunday at night late Colonel John
Buttler the Lord Montgarats uncle, who i^ Colonel of 800 horses raised by the
rebels, out of the three Provinces of Lemster, Munster and Conaught, came to
Fyna with four of their best Troops; whereof Owen Mac Arts lifegard was one,
the reb^lls horse following our scouts close up to their body, our three Troops
being all Landfirs, did resolutely charge them, though the enemies horse were
far more in number, and much better horsed and armed, yet after the first salve
they took a flying retreat, the rest of their horse came out to second them,
but the first were so charged home by our horse, who were pell mell amongst
them, that all of them were put to confusion, and took the retreat in
disorder; They had also laid an ambuish of musketeers for our m^n, but seei^g
all their own horse retired in such disorder, took their flight also; And our
men charged their horsemen to the very bridge, and killed some of them upon the
bridge, notwithstanding that the musketeers were playing both from the Castle,
and from ditches near the Castle and Bridge upon them; yet by Gods favor
retired having only three men killed, whereof two were a Corporal and a
Trooper of Sir Stewarts, and the Lieutenant of Sir William Coals Troop called
Graham, who having charged over the Bridge in the o^ i^ of the rebels was
killed at the Castle gate, one Fulerton a v^^iant Soldier a Corporal of Sir
William Stewarts Troop was hu^t and after dyed of the wound, and two or three
more hurt. The rebe^l^ finding that they had received so resolute a charge and
rout from s^ ^ew of our Troops, whom they before despised glorying ^b^ve
mea^ure in their own Troops (^s in deed they might for h^rses and arms, if
God did not fight on our side) seeing our Army be^ding that way, God took
their hearts from them, and they straight forsook both the Bridge and Castle,
with all their horse and foot, which their two hundred musketeers might have
kept against 20000, longer then our Victuals would have permitted our stay, so
the Foot having fled thorough a Bogge toward a Wood, and the Horse toward
Kells, with all their speed, the B^idge and House was first taken up by some
of our horsemen, whilst the Foot we^e marching toward it, which after taking
was burnt, and a number of their Houses about it. The rebels lost at the pass
about a dozen of their best men that were left near, amongst which were two
Captains that were known, and a third Captain was taken prisoner, many
others were hurt and k^l'd, whom they carried off; And some of them were buried
the same day at a Church some six miles from thence, as we got intelligence by
other prisoners which we took afterward; From thence the same day w^e marched
toward K^lls, whether we heard the next Rand^zouz between the Earl of
Castle-Haven, and Owen Mac Art was appointed, there we arrived the next day,
but Owen Mac Art who removed from thence before to Port-Leister, to the Earl
of Castle-Haven, trusting more to the strength and advantage of that hold, then
to their Army, or cause. And it is like enough that if we could have gone
thither also, they would have retired further from us, but that being the 14
day from the time that we set out, we had not m^^le for six days to bring them
home. So having burned that Town and likewise sent out a party of Horse who
burnt the Town of the Navau also, and 47 good Castles more in the County of
Longford, and Westme^^h, want of victuals forced us to retreat homewards, an^
to march as far in two days, as we did in 3 before. From Kells the 10 of
July we came to Ardye where Owen Mac Art lay with his army and Cre^ts before he
went to Kells, that town (with diverse of the rest) had bin formerly burnt by
the English Army, in the beginning of the Rebellion,but began to be rebuilt by
the Irish: This we also burnt, all the people still flying before us, carrying
and driving with them toward Drogheduth and Dublin, all their goods and
cattle.

From Ardie the twelfth day we came to Dundaik an^ leagured, within a mile of
it near Bedloes Castle, where the General Major took a special care, that
no hurt at all was done to them, or to any place which he heard belonged to any
of the Eng^ish Garrisons. From thence the Forces under the command of Sir
William Stuart, Sir Robert Stuart, and the rest, in, and near London-dery, and
Eviskillin did march the next way homewards.

The thirteenth day we came and leagured also by the Neur^y. The General Major
with 5 or 6 Officers did ride into the Town, and desired Lieutenant Colonel
Mathewes (who after the Scots Garrison left that place, was appointed Governor
there, by the Lord Marquess of Ormond) that he might have passage throu^h the
Town with the Army the next morning, which he r^fus^d; whereupon some hot
words grew betwixt them, and one Captain Perkins, a young Captain in that
Garrison, gave some offensive words both to the General Major, and some of the
Officers that were with him; Whereupon after the General Major r^tu^ned from
the Town to the Camp, he sent a Drummer to the Governor, and charged him to
give him passage, or if not to be upon his guard, being resolved to have
stormed the Town, and taken it in, Mathewes persisted obstinate in his
denyall^ after two several fair messages which were sent unto him by the
General Major, which being perceived by the Commanders of the Army^ and
foreseeing the mischief that might come to that place, and the spilling of
Protestants blood, did labor earnestly with the General Major to pass by that
time, and not to take notice of their folly and indiscretion, which he (out of
his respects to the Lord Conway, who had then a company in that place; an^ to
show he could better rule his passion, then the Governor and the rest of that
Garrison) was nobly pleased to do; From thence the next day we marched to a
pl^ce near the banside.

T^^ f^urteenth da^ live passed two miles further then Less^e G^r^^. An^ the
fi^t^^nth day every Regimen^ retired toward t^^ir (...) quarters, in the
Counties of Down and Antrim.

Si^^e our r^turne the Earl of Castle-haven and Owen Mac-Art d^e threaten
hard, that they will immediately follow us down into our quarters, and drive us
into the Sea) if God and we will give them leave) and truly we and all other
Protestants, of whatsoever nati^n they be in this Kingdom, may expect this
measure from them if they get their will, as by all their proceedings since the
beginning of this detestable Rebellion may plainly appear to any man that will
not wil^ully blind himself.

Their late oath of con^ederacy published in May last (or at least then came to
our knowledge, may demonstrate it. And for further testimony to every une,
cannot omit a Declaration which they have lately published upon occasion of
some disturbance and divisiions that did begin and were like to come to a great
height amongst themselves, the original whereof did come to my hands amongst
some papers that were gotten at one Robert Nugents house, Uncle or Cozen to the
Earl of Westmeath, which though a gallant house and a good Bawne, he deserted,
where we gained the pass at Fynam; A true copy whereof I herewith send for the
better satiafaction of every true hearted Protes^ant. The Original under the
hands of M^c Mahon, O Rely, To. Nugent, and others of that hellish crew I
keep, and if perchance you have not seen the oath of confederacy before
mentioned, I also send you a copy hereof, each of these two instruments will
expound one the other; The Declation will show how hateful the English
Government is, and has bin unto them, which they term a servitude. And that
design therein mentioned is to shake it off, and to get the Government in
their own hands, and for Religion to establish the Catholic Roman profession.

It is then clear how they intend to maintain the Kings prerogative^ dignity
and power over Ireland, which has so long been anexed to the imperial Crown
of England, and what is that Episcopal jurisdiction, power of the Church, and
priv^ledges of prelates; they swear in their oath of confederacy to maintain,
though by both severally it is clear eno^gh, that they intend to give the King
no ^urther obedience, ^ither in matters of policy or Religion^ then he shall
con^orm himself to their desires, which God I hope will let his Majesty see.
And this expedition of ours will make t^ose that are of their party ashamed to
put his Majesty in furt^er ^opes^ that these bragging impostures, who are not
able to de^^nd their own Country from a hand^ull of us marching out of a corner
of two or three Counties, with Gods blessing and 20. days provision, and not
20. days before in p^eparation against them, who from all the parts of the
kingdom have these seven or eight months been preparing themselvas for a land
expedition against us, will never be able to per^orm their vast (and not
believed by themselves) undertakings to his Majesty for his assistance in
England, who at the best are a broken reed, and will run in the hand of every
one that will rest upon them, from which good Lord deliver our King and his
posterity, and send a happy accord betwixt him and his people of England and
Scotland, and a prosperous war in Ireland, until Gods justice be satisfied,
the Kings honor vindicated, the true Religion established, and the professors
thereof secured against the barbarous and bloody designs and attempts of those
unhumane and merciless Rebels.

After the writing hereof, advertis^ment came unto me Ma^or Rawden, that
intelligence is this 23. of July, 1644. came unto him that the Irish Army
consisting of 15000. horse and foot, are upon their march toward, and as far
adv^nced Dundalk, whereupon we are putting our selves in a present posture of
readiness to go out and meet them, but I am afeard that all our Army who were
last upon the fields, cannot be brought together for want of provision: But^
God I hope will be on our side, and so we will not fear who can be against us.

A Declaration and Oath of confederacy against the English and Scottish
Protestants, inhabiting within the Kingdom of Ireland, 1644.
Whereas we are informed^ that it is generally conceived and believed by the
English and Scottish Protestants, inhabitants of this Kingdom: That we the
Lords, Gentry, and others of the said Kingdome^ have taken arms, and raised
forces, for the extirpation and banishing them out of this Kingdom, thereby to
acquire to our selves their Goods and Estates.

We therefore desire to be rightly understood, for we hereby declare, that we
consented not nor intend, nor never will intend, not con^iscend to any such
act^ but do utterly declaime therein, but that each man known to be a
conformable mo^erate Protestant, may as well as the Roman Catholic
respectively, live and enjoy the ^reedome of there own Religion and quietly
and peaceably possess^ their own, so far as they or any of them, shall join
with us in this Oath following: I A. B. Doc in the presence of Almighty God,
and all the Angels and Saints in Heaven, and by the contents of this Bible,
promise, vow, swear, and protest, to bear faith and true allegance to our
Soverane Lord King Charles, and the heirs and successors of his ^egotten, and
will defend him, and as far as I may, with my life, power, and estate,
against all persons as shall attempt any thing against his, or their persons,
honors, estates, and dignities. And that I will, with the exposing of my life,
power, and estates, join with the Irish army, or any other to recover His
Majesty's Royal prerogatives forc^bly wrested from him by the Puritans in the
houses of Parliament in England, and to maintain the same against them and all
others, that shall directly or indirectly endeavor to suppress or do^ any ast
contrary to regal government. As also to maintain Episcopal Jurisdictions,
and the lawfulness thereof, ^he Churches power, and privileges of Prelates,
and the lawful rights and privileges of the subjects; and I will do no act
or thing, directly or indirectly to hinder the free and public exercise of the
Roman Religion in any of his Majesty's Dominions, and that I will join with,
and be assisting to the members of this Commonwealth, for redress to be had
of the grievances and pressures thereof, in such manner and form as shall be
thought fit by a lawful Parliament, and to my power, and as far as I may, I
will pass and bring to condign punishment, even to the loss of life, liberty
and estate, al such as either by force, practice, counsels, plots,
conspiracies, or otherwise, do or attempt any thing to the contrary, of any
Article, clause, or thing in this present Oath, Vow and Protestation contained,
and neither for hope of reward, or fear of punishment, nor any respect
whatsoever, shall relinquish this Oath and Protestation, So help me God.

This Declaration and Oath was entered in the council book of K^^kenny and this
is a true copy thereof, witness my hand, 1644.

The second Declaration of the Irish Rebels against the British forces, in
the Province of ULSTER.
WE and others the Natives of this Kingdom of Irland, profess^ng the Catholic
Religion, having long suffered the oppression of English, who deprived us of
the benefits of all our native soyle^ made us under color of Religion,
incapable of dignities and offices, separating of us from being part^ers of the
Government of our own Country, his Royal Majesty being pleased to express
his favor to his subjects of England and Scotland, in admitting them to the
place of government in these Kingdoms, and to express their inveterate malice
against us, have threatened to extirpate us and banish our Religion our of this
dominion, contrary to his Majesty's graces and royal favors hitherto
extended toward us^ and have trampled on his Majesty's royal prerogatives
above p^e^^d^nt of preced^nt times, we having for these many years con^^^^ed
in this servitude^ and our complaints rejected and thtea^ed with wor^e usage,
^^nding our souls touched with zeal to our Re^^^i^n without which we cannot
subsist^ and the true loyalty which (...) owe to our Soverai^ne Prince, whose
prerogative we hold e^^psed, and conceive our Natives as well worthy to manage
the affairs of our C^untry, as those of the English nation that are sent to
govern amongst us^ being for the most part of the meanest of that people^ have
for the defense of his Majesty's royal prerogatives, the liberties of our
laws and Country, and the establishm^nt of our Religion taken Arms without
intention to prejudice any manner of person, in his life, liberty or goods, or
estate, other t^en such as pro^^sse adversaries to that ou^ just design. And
for that we are informed that many under color of furthering those our
int^n^m^nts, raise arms, and convert those their arms and fo^^es to revenge
their private quarells, oppress and prey their neig^bours.

We therefore do publish this our Declaration, and desire all men to take
notice thereof, that whosoever shall seek to avenge him upon any man for
private respect, or shall take any prey or booty of any nature of this
Kingdom or any English, Scots, or other borne out of this Kingdom, professing
the Catholic Religion, that are or shall be converted to the Catholic
Religion, or shall enter upon any of their possessions; We do hereby declare it
to be contrary to our intentions^ and contrary the intentions of all those that
are joined in league with us; and i^ any party that does seek any such avenge,
shall not desist; and that such persons as has taken possessions of any lands,
or taken any goods from any persons qualified, as aforesaid, and will not
forthwith make restitution, that we will deem him a disturber of the
Commonwealth, and take revenge of him as of our public enemy.

A Copy of my Lord DIGBIES Letter to the Duchess of Buckingham.
Madame,
THe shame of my fault to have been thus long without acknowledging the honor
of a former Lettter from your grace, would have destroyed the joy of a
redoubled happiness in the same kind, did not the extreme uncertainty of our
condition hereof late, and the hazard of the passages, excused delay in the
performance of that deuty, wherein I shall never be guilty of a voluntary
neglect. Madam, I esteem it a great misfortune to the Kings affairs, that the
Ships provided to, and expected by my Lord o^ Antrim, have failed him: but
misfortunes are many times without faults, I am sure he is guilty of none,
having so nobly complied with his undertakings, nor indeed can, that then has
been of the Kings party.

For all Council imaginable has been taken to procure ships both in Ireland
and in England, but how the former failed, I cannot say, having not heard
thence these many months; and for these here in England, particularly the
Barkleys ships, they have been shut up by the Parliament ships in the Port, but
I hope the taking of Leverpool may now set them free.

I am now dispatching away Bryan O. Neale to the Marquis of Ormond with a
Commission to meet and conclude either a peace, or farther cessation; for Gods
sake Madam contribute an interest in the procuring of a good one; there is no
way by which my Lord of Antrtm can want more, which I confess he has done
already, to a degree beyond that which your Grace desired should pass as a
mark of it, wherein I humbly thank your Grace, for your noble confidence of my
desires to serve you, which shall never be wanting to any command of yours with
all imaginary industry but in this I can be but a second instrument, the work^
of this time must be the Queens, whose pleasure once t^orowly expressed in it
will not quicken more, but make more comfortable the design in soliciting,

So Madam, Your Graces most faithful humble servant, GEORGE DIGBY.

FINIS.
