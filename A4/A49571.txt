Hector and Achilles.
THere once was sown
Contention,
The like was known
By no man.
'Tween Greekish rout,
And Trojans stout,
And all about
A Woman.
For there is a day,
When Trojans play,
Work laid away,
Which rare is;
This brought great joy,
To the Town of Troy,
But most to the Boy,
called Paris.
He had design,
With fellows nine,
Two pence to join
A piece -- a.
They hire a boat,
(Each doffes his Coat)
And bravely row't,
To Greece -- a.
No have is made,
For time they had
Enough, as said
Before is.
Now here they are,
l' the nick as 'twere,
While Greeks prepare
For Morris.
And if one should,
Such sport behold
For ever, 'twould
Not weary one.
So blithe a Lass,
Did never pass
Through Greece, as was
Maid Marrion.
As frog leaped quick,
Over a Dike,
When she had like
TO have fell in.
As Bag-pipes sound,
On dusty ground,
So tramples round
Smug Hellen.
This did so fire,
The doughty Squire,
H'ad no desire
To leese her.
Rounding in ear,
He speaks her fair,
Yet would this gear
Not please her.
This stung to the Gall,
Now to it he will fall,
He Will never stand shall
I shall I.
Quoth he I Will prove
If you can move
Or else by-Jove
I Will maul ye.
With her they fly,
It Is vain to cry,
For presently
They Are gone all.
For joy they roared,
Now she is aboard,
And this the word,
Our own all.
There Is not a Greek.
Had power to speak,
The are vexed to break
Of a Game.
But they are afraid
It will be said,
That they are made
A May Game.
With Club and Stick,
With Sword and Pike,
The Greeks run thick
To seaside.
To Vessels they
Themselves convay,
Which vacant lay,
There beside.
They hoise up Sail,
Their Oars they trail,
Revenged they will --
-- Be, sans doubt.
To Trojan shore
Now wafted over,
They Will knock (they swore)
Their brains out.
Their Clubs they fit,
In fist they spit,
The next they will hit
That they see;
While Trojans wink,
For you must think,
When they are in drink,
They Are lazy.
Heart was at heell,
'Till Trojans feell,
That Greeks do deal
So badly;
Their Clubs they crack,
They hold them tack,
They bruise and thwack
As madly.
Bumps rise in head,
Both parties bleed,
'Kerchers they need,
To dry 'em.
This ruefull sight,
Did not delight
The Trojan, hight
Old Priam.
He had more care,
Then all men there.
(It is, I swear,
No fable.)
In Trojan Land,
H'ad great command,
Churchwarden, and
Constable.
In midst he stood,
And to the Crowd
These words, aloud,
Then he sent.
Pray make an end
Thus to contend,
Both foe, and friend,
Here present.
For 'twill be sung,
By future tongue,
Our lives were bung
'Oth' tenter.
And if it be so,
Naught else will do,
There Is only two
Shall venture.
Small blood be spilt;
For they shall tilt,
At Basket, Hilt,
And Cudgel.
Who best does play,
Their's be the day;
Spectators pray --
-- Ye judge well.
They like this thing,
They make a Ring.
First Trojans bring
Out their man.
A precious Wight,
Of mickle might,
And to all men's sight,
A rare man.
On's Lip did grow,
Mustachio,
No man did know
Such ever.
A jovial Lad,
Wild, blithe, and mad,
And was by trade
A Weaver.
He armed does come,
With staff of Broom,
Yo'ld swear him some --
-- Protector.
Over spot of ground,
Thrice stalked he round,
And three times frowned,
Brave Hector.
He struts not long,
When from among,
The Greekish throng,
All staring.
There did appear,
Great Hectors Peer,
A Warrier --
-- As daring;
Who erst has stood,
Knee-deep in blood,
Among all the Brood
None such are.
H'ath often rubbed out,
A dreadful bout,
Never was so stout
A Butcher.
But not to fast,
'Fors Battle past
His title last,
To tell is;
He is well known
All over the Town,
By name of boon
Achilles.
Horn-pipes they blow,
Spectators know,
The Champions now
Will fly on.
With open mouth,
The encounter both
As Tiger does
With Lion.
Alike they fight,
'Till for mere spite,
A Blow did light
On Hector.
Feeling the weight,
It Is desperate,
Trojan did straight
Conjecture.
He would not cry,
(Though tear's in eye)
He might thereby
Loose credit.
But, truth be said,
A Curse is laid
Upon his head
That did it.
Quoth Hector, stay,
I will not play,
Because you lay
On so hard.
Says Greek, resign,
A Rope be thine,
For Hellen's mine
Poor Coward.
Trojan would choke,
E're he would have spoke,
Lest the other stroke
Should happen;
Last brought such pain,
That he was feign,
On staff to lean
with Cap on.
Thus have you heard
How Trojans jear'd,
While all men feared
The o'recomer.
If you would veiw,
What did ensue,
I Will send you to
Old Homer.
FINIS.
