The happy INSTRUMENTS of ENGLANDS Preservation.
Come and behold ye salvation of ye Lord.

HEAVEN SHALL TURN THY WEAPONS AGAINST THEE

The wrath of God is uoon all those that conspire against his Church.

My testimony full triumphs

Godfres murder did undo
The knot of all yse plotting Crew.
Why should Stafford so deny
What he knew as well as I
Living dying still the same
Rome will nere forget my name
This Crown they aimd at but the host of Heaven protects it.

By our discoverys you may know
What damned Intreagues are hatched below
The INFERNAL CONCLAVE

How shall we destroy thesese Heretics

Go on and Prosper yuou Holiness is sure of me.

It must be by a general Massacre.

Exit Visct Stafford.



Behold The Infernal Conclave, met in state,
Contriving Englands and its Monarchs Fate.
Assassinate the King, Subvert his Laws,
They cried, and on their Ruin build our Cause.
Pardons were straight prepared, and men made free
Of Heaven to perpetrate their Villainy.
And thus secure, their Plotts went briskly on,
Against our fixed Laws and settled Throne.
But he that sitts enthrond, in mercy chose,
Those instruments, that did the whole disclose.
And thus to Oats and all the rest we owe
The Kingdoms Peace, if we can keep it so.
