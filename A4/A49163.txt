I Will sing of a Villain I cannot abuse,
The Halter and Axe no such men will refuse;

It Is he was the cause of the Nations dismay,
He has ever been a Knave from his birth to this day
To see the sot hanged we will make Holiday:

And first I will show what he is in grain;
I care not a pin for the boobee's disdain,
His deeds now in brief unto you I Will proclaim:

He was the Inventer of Oate's punishment,
From Newgate to Tyburn, and thither he sent,
To have him well whipped he gave his consent;

The good Mr. Cornish did innocent die,
And all by this Chancellor's cursed Villainy;
His blood now from Heaven for Vengeance does cry;

He was the first Author that opened his Jaws
To take off the Test and Privilege Laws;
The beheading of Russel, 'twas he was the cause.

Then next to the West he hurried wi^h speed,
To murder poor men, a very good deed,
He made many honest men's hearts for to bleed.

The prisoners to plead to his Lordship did cry,
but still did make answer, and thus did reply,
We'll hang you up first, and then after we will try:

And still did creat all their doubts and their fears,
He left the poor Widows and Children in tears;

That place called the Ecclesiastical Court,
And thither he made the poor Clergy resort:

To turn on the F^llows, a very fine trick,
And place ^^^her Walker, that cursed Jesuit.

And swore he had done a very good act,
But now shall be tried for the matter of fact.

To accept a petition they humbly desired;
He swore he would prove it a Libel he cried;

Alas, they will Vote him quite out of his Wits,
They Will make him run mad, or fall into Fits;

In Wapping he thought for to make his escape,
A very good Jest, but I faith it will not take,
His head on the bridge must be stuck on a stake;

He many seditious Lines has penned,
And sent them to P -- his honest friend;
My Muse she grows weary, and thus she does end,
With pox of Chancellor, villainous Chancellor,
Damnable Chancellor, oh,
