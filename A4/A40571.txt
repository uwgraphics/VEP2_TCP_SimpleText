A REPRESENTATION FROM HIS EXCELLENCY Sr. THOMAS FAIRFAX, And the Army under
his command, Humbly tendered to the PARLIAMENT: Concerning the just and
fundamental Rights and Liberties of themselves and the Kingdom, with some
humble proposals and desires in order thereunto, and for settling the Peace of
the Kingdom.

St. Albanes, June 14. 1647.
By the appointment of his Excellency Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX, with the Officers and
Soldiery under his Command.

J. Rushworth, Secretary.

CAMBRIDGE: Printed by Roger Daniel, Printer to the Universitie. 1647.

THat we may no longer be the dis-satisfaction of our friends, the subject of
our enemies malice (to work jealousies and misrepresentations upon,) and the
suspicion, if not aastonishment, of many in the Kingdom, in our late or
present transactions and conduct of business; we shall in all faithfulness
and clearness profess and declare unto you, those things which have of late
protracted and hindered our disbanding; the present grievances which possess
our Army, and are yet unremedied; with our desires as to the complete
settlement of the liberties and peace of the Kingdom, which is that blessing
of God, then which, of all worldly things nothing is more dear unto us, or more
precious in our thoughts, we having hitherto thought all our present enjoyments
(whether of life, or livelihood, or nearest relations) a price but sufficient
to the purchase of so rich a blessing; that we and all the freeborn people of
this Nation, may sit down in quiet under our vines, and under the glorious
administration of Justice and righteousness, and in full possession of those
fundamental rights and liberties, without which we can have little hopes (as
to humane considerations) to enjoy either any comfort of life, or so much as
life it self, but at the pleasures of some men, ruling merely according to will
and power. It cannot be unknown what has passed betwixt the Parliament and the
Army, as to the service of Ireland; By all which together with the late
proceedings against the Army, in relation to their petitions and grievances,
all men may judge what has hindered the Army from a ready engagement in that
service, and (without further account or apology, as to that particular) then
what those passages and proceedings themselves (already made public) do
afford; We do appeal to all men, whether those courses to which the Parliament
has (by the designs and practice of some) been drawn, have rationally tended
to induce a cheerful and unanimous undertaking of the Army, as to that
service, or rather to break and pull the Army in pieces, with discontents and
dishonor; and to put such dis-obligations and provocations upon it, as might
drive it into distemper, and indeed discourage both this Army and other
soldiers, from any further engagement in the Parliament service. And we wish
all men would, with us, upon the whole carriage seriously consider, Whether in
the intentions of those who have by false informations and mis-representations,
put the Parliament upon such ways, the timely and effectual relief of
Ireland, seem really to have been intended; or rather (with the breaking and
disbanding of this Army) to draw together, or raise such other forces, and of
such a temper, as might serve to some desperate and destructive designs in
England: For which (besides the probable suspicions from their carriage of the
business) we have beforehand in the trans-action thereof, had more then hints
of such a design, by clear expressions to that purpose from many of those
Officers of the Army, that have been persuaded, and appeared most forward to
engage for Ireland on the terms proposed: And that such a design has all
along been driven, seems now too evident, by the present disposing of those
forces that have been engaged (as for Ireland) by the endeavors of some, to
gain a power from the Parliament of ordering the same for some service in
England, and by the private listings of men for service here, without any
public authority of Parliament; and all this by the same persons who have all
along appeared most active and violent in the late proceedings against the Army.

As to the just discontents and dis-satisfactions of the Army, in relation to
their grievances, and their noncompliance to the late Orders for sudden
disbanding by piecemeal, before more full and equal satisfaction were given
to the whole; We desire you to look back to the papers already published of the
grievances themselves, the Narrative of the Officers, and to the later papers
from the General Council of War at Bury, and from the late General
Rendezvous last week near Newmarket: And (we think) the Parliaments late
resuming the Consideration of those things (as to a further satisfaction) does
much justify the desires and proceedings of the Army, in those past
particulars hitherto.

And though (had we upon our first addresses) for our undoubted rights and
dues, found a free and candid reception, with a just consideration and
reasonable satisfaction; or at least an ingenuous answer therein, we should
have been easily persuaded to have abated, or forborne much of our dues, and not
to have inquired into or considered (so far as we have) either the
possibilities there are for more present satisfaction of Arrears, or the credit
of future securities proposed; Yet since upon those former addresses, we have
found such unworthy dealing, as in the said papers is set forth; and those
additionall (though hitherto but partial) satisfactions coming so hardly as
they have; We find no obliging reasons, in the least, to decline or recede from
what is our due, but rather still to adhere unto our desires, of full and equal
satisfaction, in all the things mentioned in the aforesaid papers, not only in
behalf of our selves and the Army, but also of the whole soldiery throughout
the Kingdom, who have concurred or shall concur with us in the same desires,
and to all our former desires. As soldiers we cannot but add this (wherein we
find our selves so nearly concerned in point of justice and reputation) that
more care, and a stricter course may be taken, for making good all Articles
granted upon surrenders, according to the true intent and meaning of them; as
also for remedy and reparation in case of any Breach (and this) without those
delays which diverse have found as prejudicial, or more, then if they had been
totally denied the performance of them.

Nor will it now (we hope) seem strange or unseasonable to rational and honest
men, who consider the consequence of our present case to their own and the
Kingdoms, as well as our future concernments in point of right, freedom,
peace and safety, if (from a deep sense of the high consequence of our present
case, both to our selves in future and all other people) we shall before
disbanding proceed in our own and the Kingdoms behalf, to propound and plead
for some provision for our and the Kingdoms satisfaction, and future security
in relation to those things, especially considering that we were not a mere
mercenary Army, hired to serve any Arbitrary power of a state, but called
forth, and conjured by the several Declarations of Parliament to the defense
of our own and the peoples just rights and liberties, and so we took up Arms in
judgment and conscience to those ends, and have so continued them, and are
resolved, according to your first just desires in your Declarations, and such
principles as we have received from your frequent informations, and our own
common sense, concerning these our fundamental rights and liberties, to assert
and vindicate the just power and rights of this Kingdom in Parliaments, for
those common ends premised, against all arbitrary power, violence and
oppression and all particular parties and interests whatsoever, the said
Declarations still directing us to the Equitable sense of all Laws and
Constitutions, as dispensing with the very letter of the same, and being
supreme to it, when the safety and preservation of all is concerned, and
assuring us that all authority is fundamentally seated in the office, and but
ministerially in the persons, neither do or will these our proceedings (as we
are fully and in conscience persuaded) amount to any thing unwarrantable before
God and men, being thus far much short of the common proceedings in other
Nations to things of an higher nature then we have yet appeared to: And we
cannot but be sensible of the great complaints that have been made to us
generally in the Kingdom from the people, where we march, of Arbitrarinesse
and Injustice to their great and insupportable oppressions.

And truly such Kingdoms as have according both to the law of Nature and
Nations, appeared to the Vindications and defenses of their just rights and
liberties, have proceeded much higher: as our Brethren of Scotland, who in the
first beginning of these late differences, associated in Covenant from the very
same principles and grounds, having no visible form either of Parliament or
King to countenance them: And as they were therein justified, and protected by
their Own, and this Kingdom also, so we justly shall expect to be.

We need not mention the States of the Netherlands, the Portugals, and others,
all proceeding upon the same Principles of Right and Freedom: And accordingly
the Parliament has declared it no resistance of Magistracy, to side with the
just principles of Law, Nature, and Nations; being that Law, upon which we have
assisted You. And that the Soldiery may lawfully hold the hands of that
General who will turn his Cannon against his Army, on purpose to destroy them:
The Seamen the hands of that Pylot, who wilfully runs the Ship upon the Rock,
(as our Brethren of Scotland argued:) And such were the proceedings of our
Ancestors of famous memory, to the purchasing of such Rights and Liberties, as
they have enjoyed through the price of their Blood, and we both by that and the
latter Blood of our dear Friends, and fellow Soldiers, with the hazard of our
own, do now lay claim unto.

Nor is that supreme end (the Glory of God) wanting in these cases to set a
price upon all such proceedings of righteousness, and Justice, it being one
witness of God in the world, to carry on a Testimony against the injustice,
and unrighteousness of men, and against the miscarriages of Government: when
corrupted, or declining from their primitive and original glory.

These things we mention but to compare proceedings, and to show, that we are
so much the more justifiable and warranted in what we do, by how much we come
short of that height and measure of proceedings which the people in free
Kingdoms and Nations, have formerly practiced.

Now having thus far cleared our way in this business, we shall proceed to
propound such things as we do humbly desire, for the settling and securing of
our own, and the Kingdoms Right, Freedom, Peace, and safety, as follows.

I. That the Houses may be speedily purged of such Members; as for their
delinquency, or for corruption, or abuse to the State, or undue election, ought
not to sit there; whereof the late elections in Cornwall, Wales, and other
parts of the Kingdom, afford too many examples to the great prejudice of the
peoples freedom in the said Election.

II. That those persons who have in the late unjust, and high proceedings
against the Army, appeared to have the will, the confidence, credit, and power
to abuse the Parliament, and the Army, and endanger the Kingdom in carrying on
such things against us while an Army; may be some way speedily disabled from
doing the like or worse to us, (when disbanded, and dispersed, and in the
condition of private men) or to other the Freeborn people of England, in the
same condition with us, and that (for that purpose) the same persons may not
continue in the same power, (especially) as Our and the Kingdoms judges in the
highest Trust, but may be made incapable thereof for future.

And if it be questioned who those are, we thought not fit particularly to name
them in this our representation to you, but shall very speedily give in their
names, and before long, shall offer what we have to say against them to your
Commissioners, wherein we hope so to carry our selves, as that the world shall
see we aim at nothing of private Revenge, or Animosity, but that Justice may
have a free course, and the Kingdom be eased; (at least) by disinabling such
men from places of Judicature, who desiring to advantage and set up themselves
and their party, in a general confusion have endeavored to put the Kingdom
into a new flame of war, then which nothing is more abhorrent unto us.

But because neither the granting of this alone would be sufficient to secure
our Own, and the Kingdoms Rights, Liberties, and Safety, either for the
present Age, or Posterity; nor would the proposal of this singly be free from
the scandal and appearance of Faction, or design only to suppress one party
(under the notion of unjust, or oppressive:) that we may advance another, which
may be imagined more our own; We therefore declare, that indeed we cannot but
wish that such men, and such only might be preferred to the great power and
trust of the Commonwealth, as are approved at least for moral righteousness;
and of such we cannot but in our wishes prefer those that appear acted
thereunto by a principle of Conscience and Religion in them, and accordingly we
do and ever shall bless God for those many Worthies, who through his
providence have been chosen into this Parliament: and to such men's endeavors
(under God) we cannot but attribute that vindication in part of the Peoples
Rights, and Liberties; and those beginnings of a just Reformation, which the
proceedings of the beginnings of this Parliament appeared to have driven at,
and tended to, though of late obstructed or rather diverted to other ends and
interests by the prevailing of other Persons, of other Principles and
Conditions. But we are so far from designing or complying to have any absolute
arbitrary power, fixed or settled for continuance in any persons whatsoever; as
that if we might be sure to obtain it, we cannot wish to have it so in the
persons of any who we might best confide in, or who should appear most of our
own opinions or principles, or whom we might have most personal assurance of,
or interest in, but we do, and shall much rather wish, that the authority of
this Kingdom in the Parliaments rightly constituted, free, equally, and
successively chosen, according to its original intention, may ever stand and
have its course; and therefore we shall apply our desires chiefly to such
things, as (by having Parliaments settled in such a right co^stitution) may
give more hopes of Justice, and Righteousness, to flow down equally to all in
that its ancient channel, without any overture, tending either to overthrow
that foundation either of order or government in this Kingdom, or to ingrosse
that power for perpetuity, into the hands of any particular person, or party
whatsoever. And for that purpose, though as we have found it doubted by many
men (minding sincerely the public good) but weighing so fully all consequences
of things, it may and is not unlike to prove, that upon the end of this
Parliament and election of a new, the constitution of succeeding Parliaments
(as to the persons elected) may prove for the worse many ways, yet since
neither in the purging of this present Parliament, nor in election of new, we
can promise to our selves an assurance of Justice, or other positive good from
the hands of men, but those that appear for present most righteous, and most
for common good, (having an unlimited power fixed in them during life or
pleasure) in time may become corrupt, or settle into parties or factions; or on
the other side in case of new elections those that should so succeed, may prove
as bad or worse then the former:

We therefore humbly conceive that (of two inconveniences the less being to be
chosen) the main thing to be intended in the case (and beyond which humane
providence cannot reach, as to any assurance of positive goods) seems to be
this, viz. to provide that however unjust and corrupt persons of Parliament, in
present or future, may prove, or whatever it be they may do to particular
parties, or to the whole in particular things during their respective terms or
periods, yet they shall not have the temptation or advantage of an unlimited
power fixed in them during their own pleasure, whereby to perpetuate injustice
and oppression upon any, without end or remedy; or to advance and uphold any
one particular party, faction, or interest whatsoever, to the oppression or
prejudice of the community, and the enslaving of the Kingdom unto all
posterity, but that the people may have an equal hope or possibility, if they
have an ill choice at one time, to mend it in another, and themselves may be in
a capacity to taste of subjection as well as rule, and may be so inclined to
consider of other men's cases, as what may come to be their own. This we speak
of in relation to the House of Commons, as being entrusted on the peoples
behalf, for their interest in that great and supreme power of the
Commonwealth, ( viZ. the legislative power, with the power of final
Judgments) which being in its own nature so arbitrary, and in a manner
unlimited, unless in point of time, is most unfit and dangerous as to the
peoples interest, to be fixed in the persons of the same now during life or
their own pleasures, neither by the original constitution of this State, was
it, or ought it to continue so (nor does it, where ever it is, and continues
so) render that state any better then a mere tyranny, or the people subjected
to it any better then vassals: but in all states where there is any face of
common freedom, and particularly in this state of England (as is most evident
both by many positive laws and ancient constant custom) the people have a
right to new and successive elections, unto that great and supreme trust, at
certain periods of time, which is so essential and fundamental to their
freedom, as it cannot or ought not be denied them this, without which the
House of Commons is of very little concernment to the interest of the commons
of England, yet in this we would not be misunderstood to blame those worthies
of both Houses, whose zeal to vindicate the liberties of this nation, cld
procure that Act for continuance of Parliament, whereby it was secured from
being dissolved at the Kings pleasure, as former Parliaments have been: and
reduced to such a certainty, as might enable them the better to assist and
vindicate the liberties of this Nation (immediately before so highly invaded,
and then also so much endangered) and this we take to be the principal ends
and grounds, for which in that exigency of time and affairs it was procured,
and to which we acknowledge it has happily been made use of: but we cannot
think it was by these worthies intended, or ought to be made use of to the
perpetuating of that supreme trust and power in the persons of any, during
their own pleasures, or to the debarring of the people from their right and
elections totally, now when those dangers or exigencies were past and the
affairs and safety of the Commonwealth would admit of such a change.

Having thus cleared our grounds and intentions (as we hope) from all scruples
and misunderstandings in what follows, we shall proceed further to propose what
we humbly desire for the settling of our own and the Kingdoms rights and
liberties, through the blessing of God to posterity, and therefore upon all the
grounds promised, we further humbly desire as follows,

III. That some determinate period of time may be set for the continuance of
this and future Parliaments, beyond which none shall continue, and upon which
new Writs may of course issue out, and new elections successively take place,
according to the intent of the bill for Trienniall Parliaments.

And herein we would not be misunderstood, to desire a present or sudden
dissolution of this Parliament, but only (as is expressed before) that some
certain period may be set for the determining of it, so that it may not remain
(as now) continuable for ever, or during the pleasure of the present Members.
And we should desire that the period to be now set for ending this Parliament
may be such as may give sufficient time for provision of what is wanting, and
necessary to be passed in point of just reformation and further securing the
rights and liberties and settling the peace of the Kingdom, in order to which
we further humbly offer.

IV. That secure provision may be made for the continuance of future
Parliaments, so as they may not be adjournable or dissolvable at the Kings
pleasure, or any other ways then by their own consent during their respective
periods: but all those periods each Parliament to determine of course as
before. This we desire may be now provided for (if it may be) so as to put it
out of all dispute for future, though we think of right it ought not to have
been otherwise before.

And because the present distribution of Elections for Parliament Members is so
very unequal, and the multitude of Burgesses for decayed or inconsiderable
Towns (whose interest in the Kingdom, would (in many) not exceed or (in
others) not equal ordinary Villages) does give too much and too evident
opportunity for men of power to frame parties in Parliament to serve particular
interest, and thereby the common interest of the whole is not so minded, or not
so equally provided for, we therefore further desire:

V. That some provision may be now made for such distribution of Elections for
future Parliaments as may stand with some rule of equality, or proportion as
near as may be, to render the Parliament a more equal representative of the
whole, as (for instance) That all Counties or divisions and parts of the
Kingdom (involving inconsiderable Towns) may have a number of Parliament men
allowed to their choice, proportionably to the respective rates they bear in
the common charges and burdens of the Kingdom, and not to have more; or some
other such like rule.

And thus a firm foundation being laid in the authority and constitution of
Parliament for the hopes at least of common and equal right and freedom to
our selves and all the freeborn people of this Land, we shall (for our parts)
freely and cheerfully commit our stock or share of interest in this Kingdom,
into this common bottom of Parliament, and though it may (for our particulars)
go ill with us in one voyage, yet we shall thus hope (if right be with us) to
fare better in another.

These things we desire may be provided for by bill or Ordinance of Parliament:
to which the Royal Assent may be desired. And when his Majesty (in these
things and what else shall be proposed by the Parliament necessary for securing
the rights and liberties of the people, and for settling the Militia and peace
of the Kingdom) shall have given his concurrence, to put them past dispute; we
shall then desire that the rights of his Majesty and his posterity may be
considered of and settled in all things so far as may consist with the right
and freedom of the subject, and with the security of the same for future.

VI. We desire, That the right and freedom of the people to represent to the
Parliament by way of humble petition, their grievances, in such things as
cannot otherwise be remedied then by Parliament, may be cleared and vindicated,
that all such grievances of the people may be freely received, and admitted
into consideration, and put into an equitable and speedy way to be heard,
examined, and redressed, if they appear real: and that in such things, for
which men have remedy by law, They may be freely left to the benefit of law and
the regulated course of justice, without interruption or check from the
Parliament, except in case of things done upon the exigency of war, or for
the service and benefit of the Parliament and Kingdom in relation to the
war, or otherwise in due pursuance and execution of Ordinances, or Orders of
Parliament.

More particularly (under this head) we cannot but desire that all such as are
imprisoned for any pretended misdemeanour, may be put into a speedy way for a
just hearing and trial, and such as shall appear to have been unjustly, and
unduely imprisoned may (with their Liberty) have some reasonable reparation
according to their sufferings, and the demerit of their oppressors,

VII. That the large power given to Committees, or Deputy Lievtenants, during
the late times of war, and distraction may be speedily taken into
consideration: That such of those powers as appear not necessary to be
continued may be taken away, and such of them as are necessary, may be put into
a regulated way, and left to as little Arbitrarinesse as the nature and
necessity of the things wherein they are conversant will bear.

VIII. We could wish that the Kingdom might both be righted, and publicly
satisfied in point of Accounts for the vast sums that have been levied and
paid, as also in diverse other things wherein the common wealth may be
conceived, to have been wronged or abused. But we are loath to press any thing
that may tend to lengthen out further disputes, or contestations, but rather
such as may tend to a speedy and General composure and quieting of men's minds
in order to peace, for which purpose we further propose.

IX. That public justice being first satisfied by some few examples to
posterity out of the worst of excepted persons, and other delinquents, having
past their Compositions, some course may be taken (by a general act of
oblivion; or otherwise) whereby the seeds of future War or Fewds either to the
present Age, or Posterity, may the better be taken away by easing that sense of
present, and satisfying those fears of future ruin or undoing to persons or
families which may drive men into any desperate ways for self preservation and
remedy, and by taking away the private remembrances and distinctions of
parties, as far as may stand with safety to the Rights and Liberties we have
hitherto fought for.

There are besides these) many particular things which we could wish to be
done, and some to be undone; all in order still to the same end of Common
Right, Freedom, Peace, and Safety. But these proposals aforegoing being the
principal things we bottom and insist upon, we shall as we have said before
for our parts acquiesce for other particulars in the wisdom and justice of
Parliament. And whereas it has been suggested or suspected that in our late or
present proceedings our design is to overthrow Presbitery, or hinder the
settlement thereof, and to have the Independent government set up: We do
clearly disclaim, and disavow any such design; we only desire that according
to the Declarations promising a privilege for tender Consciences, there may be
some effectual course taken according to the intent thereof, and that such who
upon Conscientious grounds may differ from the established forms, may not for
that be debarred from the common Rights, Liberties or Benefits belonging
equally to all as men and Members of the Commonwealth, while they live
soberly, honestly, inoffensively toward others, and peacefully and faithfully
toward the State.

We have thus freely and clearly declared the depth and bottoms of our hearts
and desires in order to the Rights, Liberties; and Peace of the Kingdom:
wherein we appeal to all men whether we seek anything of advantage to our
selves, or any particular party whatever to the prejudice of the whole, and
whether the things we wish and seek do not equally concern and conduce to he
good of others in common with our selves, according to the sincerity of our
desires and intentions, wherein as we have already found the concurrent sense
of the people in diverse Counties by their Petitions to the General, expressing
their Resentment of these things, and pressing us to stand for the interest of
the Kingdom therein, so we shall wish and expect to find the unanimous
concurrence of all others that are equally concerned with us in these things,
and wish well to the Public.

And so (trusting in the mercy and goodness of God to pass by and help any
failings or infirmities of ours in the carriage or proceedings thereupon) we
shall humbly cast our selves and the business upon his good pleasure,
depending only on his presence and blessing for an happy issue to the Peace
and good of this poor Kingdom, in the accomplishment whereof we desire and
hope that God will make you blessed Instruments.

FINIS.
