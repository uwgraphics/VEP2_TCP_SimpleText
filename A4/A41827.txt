TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE JOHN Lord ROBERTS, Baron of Truro, Lord Privie-Seal,
and one of His Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
My Lord,
AS the favors I have received from your Lordship oblige me to present you
with some token of my gratitude: so the especial Honor I have for your
Lordship has made me sollicitous in the choice of the Present. For, if I could
have given your Lordship any choice Excerptions out of the Greek, or Latin
Learning, I should (according to our English Proverb) thereby but carry Coals
to Newcastle, and but give your Lorship Puddle-water, who, by your own eminent
Knowledge in those learned Languages, can drink out of the very Fountains your
self.

Moreover, to present your Lordship with tedious Narrations, were but to speak
my own Ignorance of the Value, which his Majesty, and the Public have of your
Lordship's Time. And in brief, to offer any thing like what is already in other
Books, were but to derogate from your Lordship's learning, which the World
knows to be universal, and unacquainted with few useful things contained in
any of them.

Now having (I know not by what accident) engaged my thoughts upon the Bills of
Mortality, and so far succeeded therein, as to have reduced several great
confused Volumes into a few perspicuous Tables, and abridged such Observations
as naturally flowed from them, into a few succinct Paragraphs, without any long
Series of multiloquious Deductions, I have presumed to sacrifice these my
small, but first published, Labors unto your Lordship, as unto whose benign
acceptance of some other of my Papers, even the Birth of these is due; hoping
(if I may without vanity say it) they may be of as much use to Persons in your
Lordship's place, as they are of little or none to me, which is no more then
the fairest Diamonds are to the Journey-man Jeweller that works them, or the
poor Labourer that first dig'd them from the Earth. For with all humble
submission to your Lordship, I conceive, That it does not ill-become a Peer of
the Parliament, or Member of his Majesty's Council, to consider how few starve
of the many that beg: That the irreligious Proposals of some, to multiply
People by Polygamy, is withal irrational, and fruitless: That the troublesome
seclusions in the Plague-time is not a remedy to be purchased at vast
inconveniences: That the greatest Plagues of the City are equally, and quickly
repaired from the Country: That the wasting of Males by Wars, and Colonies do
not prejudice the due proportion between them and Females: That the Opinions of
Plagues accompanying the Entrance of Kings is false, and seditious: That
London, the Metropolis of England, is perhaps a Head too big for the Body, and
possibly too strong: That this Head grows three times as fast as the Body unto
which it belongs, that is, It doubles its People in a third part of the time:
That our Parishes are now grown madly disproportionable: That our Temples are
not suitable to our Religion: That the Trade, and very City of London removes
Westward: That the walled City is but a one fifth of the whole Pyle: That the
old Streets are unfit for the present frequencie of Coaches: That the passage
of Ludgate is a throat too straight for the Body: That the fighting men about
London, are able to make three as great Armies as can be of use in this Island:
That the number of Heads is such, as has certainly much deceived some of our
Senators in their appointments of Polemoney, etc. Now, although your
Lordship's most excellent Discourses have well informed me, That your Lordship
is no stranger to all these Positions; yet because I knew not that your
Lordship had ever deduced them from the Bills of Mortality; I hoped it might
not be ungrateful to your Lordship, to see unto how much profit that one
Talent might be improved, besides the many curiosities concerning the waxing,
and waning of Diseases, the relation between Healthful, and fruitful Seasons,
the difference between the City and Country Air, etc. All which, being new, to
the best of my knowledge, and the whole Pamphlet, not two hours reading, I did
make bold to trouble your Lordship with a perusal of it, and by this humble
Dedication of it, let your Lordship and the world see the Wisdom of our City,
in appointing, and keeping these Accounts, and with how much affection and
success I am

My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient, and most faithful Servant, JOHN
GRANT.
Birchen-Lane, 25 January 1661/2.
To the Honorable, Sir ROBERT MORAY, Knight, One of His Majesty's
Privie-Council for His Kingdom of Scotland, and President of the Royal Society
of Philosophers, meeting at Gresham-College, and to the rest of that Honorable
Society.
THe Observations, which I happened to make (for I designed them not) upon the
Bills of Mortality, have fallen out to be both Political, and Natural, some
concerning Trade, and Government, others concerning the Air, Countries,
Seasons, Fruitfulness, Health, Diseases, Longevity, and the proportions between
the Sex, and Ages of Mankind. All which (because Sr. Francis Bacon reckons his
Discourses of Life and Death to be Natural History; and because I understand
your selves are also appointing means, how to measure the Degrees of Heat,
Wetness, and Windiness in the several Parts of His Majesty's Dominions) I am
humbly bold to think Natural History also, and consequently, that I am obliged
to cast in this small Mite into your great Treasury of that kind.

His Majesty being not only by ancient Right supremely concerned in matters of
Government, and Trade, but also by happy accident Prince of Philosophers, and
of Physico-Mathematical Learning, not called so by Flatterers, and Parasites,
but really so, as well by his own personal Abilities, as affection concerning
those matters, upon which Account I should have humbly dedicated both sorts of
my Observations unto His most Sacred Majesty; but to be short, I knew neither
my Work, nor my Person fit to bear His Name, nor to deserve His Patronage.
Nevertheless, as I have presumed to present this Pamphlet, so far as it relates
to Government, and Trade, to one of His Majesty's Peers, and eminent Ministers
of State: so I do desire your leave, to present the same unto You also, as it
relates to Natural History, and as it depends upon the Mathematiques of my
Shop-Arithmetique. For You are not only his Majesty's Privy Council for
Philosophy, but also His Great Council. You are the three Estates, viz. the
Mathematical, Mechanical, and Physical. You are his Parliament of Nature, and
it is no less disparagement to the meanest of your number, to say there may be
Commoners as well as Peers in Philosophy amongst you. For my own part I count
it happiness enough to my self, that there is such a Council of Nature, as your
Society is, in being; and I do with as much earnestness enquire after your
Expeditious against the Impediments of Science, as to know what Armies, and
Navies the several Princes of the World are setting forth. I concern my self as
much to know who are Curatours of this or the other Experiments, as to know who
are Mareschals of France, or Chancellor of Sweden. I am as well pleased to
hear you are satisfied in a luciferous Experiment, as that a breach has been
made in the Enemy 's works: and your ingenious arguings immediately from sense,
and fact, are as pleasant to me as the noise of victorious Guns, and Trumpets.

Moreover, as I contend for the Decent Rights, and Ceremonies of the Church, so
I also contend against the envious Schismatics of your Society (who think you
do nothing, unless you presently transmute Metals, make Butter and Cheese
without Milk; and (as their own Ballad has it, make Leather without Hides) by
asserting the usefulness of even all your preparatory, and luciferous
experiments being not the Ceremonies, but the substance, and principles of
useful Arts. For, I find in Trade the want of an universal measure, and have
heard Musicians wrangle about the just, and uniform keeping of time in their
Consorts, and therefore cannot with patience hear, that your Labors about
Vibrations, eminently conducing to both, should be slighted, nor your Pendula,
called Swing-swangs with scorn. Nor can I better endure that your Exercitations
about Air should be termed fit employment only for Airie Fancies, and not
adequate Tasks for the most solid, and piercing heads: This is my Opinion
concerning you, and although I am none of your number, nor have the least
ambition to be so, otherwise then to become able for your service, and worthy
of your Trust: yet I am coveteous to have the right of being represented by
you: To which end I desire, that this little Exhibition of mine, may be looked
upon as a Free-holder's Vote for the choosing of Knights and Burgesses to sit
in the Parliament of Nature, meaning thereby, that as the Parliament owns a
Freeholder, though he has but forty shillings a year to be one of them; so
in the same manner and degree, I also desire to be owned as one of you, and
that no longer, then I continue a faithful Friend, and Servant of your Designs
and Persons,

THE PREFACE.
HAving been born, and bred in the City of London, and having always observed,
that most of them who constantly took in the weekly Bills of Mortality, made
little other use of them, then to look at the foot, how the Burials increased,
or decreased; And, among the Casualties, what had happened rare, and
extraordinary in the week current: so as they might take the same as a Text to
talk upon, in the next Company; and withal, in the Plague-time, how the
Sickness increased, or decreased, that so the Rich might judge of the necessity
of their removal, and Tradesmen might conjecture what doings they were like
to have in their respective dealings:

2. Now, I thought that the Wisdom of our City had certainly designed the
laudable practice of taking, and distributing these Accounts, for other, and
greater uses then those abovementioned, or at least, that some other uses
might be made of them: And thereupon I casting mine Eye upon so many of the
General Bills, as next came to hand, I found encouragement from them, to look
out all the Bills I could, and (to be short) to furnish my self with as much
matter of that kind, even as the Hall of the Parish-Clerks could afford me; the
which, when I had reduced into Tables (the Copies whereof are here inserted) so
as to have a view of the whole together, in order to the more ready comparing
of one Year, Season, Parish, or other Division of the City, with another, in
respect of all the Burials, and Christnings, and of all the Diseases, and
Casualties happening in each of them respectively; I did then begin, not only
to examine the Conceits, Opinions, and Conjectures, which upon view of a few
scattered Bills I had taken up; but did also admit new ones, as I found reason,
and occasion from my Tables.

3. Moreover, finding some Truths, and not commonly-believed Opinions, to arise
from my Meditations upon these neglected Papers, I proceeded further, to
consider what benefit the knowledge of the same would bring to the World; that
I might not engage my self in idle, and useless Speculations, but like those
Noble Virtuosi of Gresham-Colledge (who reduce their subtle Disquisitions upon
Nature into downright Mechanical uses) present the World with some real fruit
from those ayrie Blossoms.

4. How far I have succeeded in the Premises, I now offer to the World's
censure. Who, I hope, will not expect from me, not professing Letters, things
demonstrated with the same certainty, wherewith Learned men determine in their
Schools; but will take it well, that I should offer at a new thing, and could
forbear presuming to meddle where any of the Learned Pens have ever touched
before, and that I have taken the pains, and been at the charge, of setting out
those Tables, whereby all men may both correct my Positions, and raise others
of their own: For herein I have, like a silly Schole-boy, coming to say my
Lesson to the World (that Peevish, and Tetchie Master) brought a bundle of Rods
wherewith to be whipped, for every mistake I have committed.

CHAP. I. Of the Bills of Mortality, their beginning, and progress.
THe first of the continued weekly Bills of Mortality extant at the
Parish-Clerks Hall, begins the 29. of December, 1603, being the first year of
King James his Reign; since when, a weekly Account has been kept there of
Burials and Christnings. It is true, There were Bills before, viz. for the
years 1592, -93, -94. but so interrupted since, that I could not depend upon
the sufficiency of them, rather relying upon those Accounts which have been
kept since, in order, as to all the uses I shall make of them.

2. I believe, that the rise of keeping these Accounts, was taken from the
Plague: for the said Bills (for ought appears) first began in the said year
1592. being a time of great Mortality; And after some disuse, were resumed
again in the year 1603, after the great Plague then happening likewise.

3. These Bills were Printed and published, not only every week on Thursdays,
but also a general Account of the whole Year was given in, upon the Thursday
before Christmas Day: which said general Accounts have been presented in the
several manners following, viz. from the Year 1603, to the Year 1624,
inclusive, according to the Pattern here inserted.

1623. 1624.
The general Bill for the whole Year, of all the Burials and Christnings, as
well within the City of London, and the Liberties thereof, as in the Nine
out-Parishes adjoining to the City, with the Pesthouse belonging to the same:
From Thursday the 18. of December. 1623. to Thursday the 16. of December, 1624.
According to the Report made to the King's most Excellent Majesty, by the
Company of the Parish-Clerks of London.
BUried this Year in the fourscore and seventeen Parishes of London within the
walls. 3386. Whereof, of the Plague, 1. Buried this Year in the sixteen
Parishes of London, and the Pesthouse, being within the Liberties, and without
the walls, 5924. Whereof, of the Plague. 5. The whole sum of all the Burials
in London, and the Liberties thereof, is this Year, 9310. Whereof, of the
Plague, 6. Buried of the Plague without the Liberties, in Middlesex, and Surrey
this whole Year, 0. Christened in London, and the Liberties thereof, this Year,
6368. Buried this Year in the Nine out-Parishes, adjoining to London, and out
of the Freedom, 2900. Whereof, of the Plague. 5. The Total of all the Burials
in the places aforesaid, is 12210. Whereof, of the Plague. 11. Christened in all
the aforesaid places this Year 8299. Parishes clear of the Plague, 116.
Parishes that have been Infected this Year. 6.

4 In the Year 1625, every Parish was particularized, as in this following
Bill: where note, That this next year of Plague caused the Augmentation, and
Correction of the Bills; as the former year of Plague, did the very being of
them.

1624. 1625.
A general, or great Bill for this Year, of the whole number of Buria's, which
have been buried of all Diseases, and also of the Plague in every Parish within
the City of London, and the Liberties thereof; as also in the nine out-Parishes
adjoining to the said City; with the Pest-houfe belonging to the same. From
Thursday the 16. day of December, 1624. to Thursday the 15. day of December,
1625. According to the Report, made to the king's most Excellent Majesty, by
the Company of Parish-Clerks of London.

5. In the Year 1626. the City of Westminster in imitation of London, was
inserted. The gross account of the Burials, and Christnings, with distinction
of the Plague being only taken notice of therein; the fifth, or last Canton, or
Lined-space, of the said Bill, being varyed into the form following, viz.

In Westminster this Year, Buried 471 Plague 13 Christenings 361

6. In the Year 1629. An account of the Diseases, and Casualties whereof any
dyed, together with the distinction of Males and Females, making the sixth
Canton of the Bill, was added in manner following.

The Canton of Casualties, and of the Bill for the Year 1639. being of the some

8. Covent Garden being made a Parish, the nine out-Parishes were called the
ten out-Parishes, the which in former years were but eight.

9. In the year 1660. the last-mentioned ten Parishes, with Westminster,
Islington, Lambeth, Stepney, Newington, Hackney, and Redriff, are entered under
two Divisions, viz. the one containing the twelve Parishes lying in Middlesex,
and Surrey, and the other the five Parishes within the City, and Liberties of
Westminster, viz. St. Clement-Danes, St. Paul's -Covent Garden, St. Martin's in
the Fields, St. Mary-Savoy, and St. Margaret's Westminster.

10. We have hitherto described the several steps, whereby the Bills of
Mortality are come up to their present state; we come next to show how they are
made, and composed, which is in this manner, viz. When any one dies, then,
either by tolling, or ringing of a Bell, or by bespeaking of a Grave of the
Sexton, the same is known to the Searchers, corresponding with the said Sexton.

11. The Searchers hereupon (who are ancient Matrons, sworn to their Office)
repair to the place, where the dead Corpse lies, and by view of the same, and by
other enquiries, they examine by what Disease, or Casualty the Corpse died.
Hereupon they make their Report to the Parish-Clerk, and he, every Tuesday
night, carries in an Account of all the Burials, and Christnings, happening that
Week, to the Clerk of the Hall. On Wednesday the general Account is made up,
and Printed, and on Thursdays published, and dispersed to the several Families,
who will pay four shillings per Annum for them.

12. Memorandum, That although the general yearly Bills have been set out in
the several varieties aforementioned, yet the Original Entries in the Hallbooks
were as exact in the very first Year as to all particulars, as now; and the
specifying of Casualties and Diseases, was probably more.

CAP. II. General Observations upon the Casualties.
IN my Discourses upon these Bills I shall first speak of the Casualties, then
give my Observations with reference to the Places, and Parishes comprehended in
the Bills; and next of the Years, and Seasons.

1. There seems to be good reason, why the Magistrate should himself take
notice of the numbers of Burials, and Christnings, viz. to see, whether the
City increase or decrease in people; whether it increase proportionably with
the rest of the Nation; whether it be grown big enough, or too big, etc. But
why the same should be made known to the People, otherwise then to please them
as with a curiosity, I see not.

2. Nor could I ever yet learn (from the many I have asked, and those not of
the least Sagacity) to what purpose the distinction between Males and Females
is inserted, or at all taken notice of; or why that of Marriages was not
equally given in? Nor is it obvious to every body, why the Account of
Casualties (whereof we are now speaking) is made? The reason, which seems most
obvious for this latter, is, That the state of health in the City may at all
times appear.

3. Now it may be Objected, That the same depends most upon the Accounts of
Epidemical Diseases, and upon the chief of them all, the Plague; wherefore the
mention of the rest seems only matter of curiosity.

4. But to this we answer; That the knowledge even of the numbers, which die of
the Plague, is not sufficiently deduced from the mere Report of the Searchers,
which only the Bills afford; but from other Ratiocinations, and comparings of
the Plague with some other Casualties.

5. For we shall make it probable, that in Years of Plague a quarter part more
dies of that Disease then are set down; the same we shall also prove by the
other Casualties. Wherefore, if it be necessary to impart to the World a good
Account of some few Casualties, which since it cannot well be done without
giving an Account of them all, then is our common practice of so doing very
apt, and rational.

6. Now, to make these Corrections upon the perhaps, ignorant, and careless
Searchers Reports, I considered first of what Authority they were in
themselves, that is, whether any credit at all were to be given to their
Distinguishments: and finding that many of the Casualties were but matter of
sense, as whether a Child were Abortive, or Stilborn; whether men were Aged,
that is to say, above sixty years old, or thereabouts, when they died, without
any curious determination, whether such Aged persons died purely of Age, as for
that the Innate heat was quite extinct, or the Radical moisture quite dried up
(for I have heard some Candid Physicians complain of the darkness, which
themselves were in hereupon) I say, that these Distinguishments being but
matter of sense, I concluded the Searchers Report might be sufficient in the
Case.

7. As for Consumptions, if the Searchers do but truly Report (as they may)
whether the dead Corpse were very lean, and worn away, it matters not to many of
our purposes, whether the Disease were exactly the same, as Physicians define
it in their Books. Moreover, In case a man of seventy five years old died of a
Cough (of which had he been free, he might have possibly lived to ninety) I
esteem it little error (as to many of our purposes) if this Person be, in the
Table of Casualties, reckoned among the Aged, and not placed under the Title of
Coughs.

8. In the matter of Infants I would desire but to know clearly, what the
Searchers mean by Infants, as whether Children that cannot speak, as the word
Infans seems to signify, or Children under two or three years old, although I
should not be satisfied, whether the Infant died of Wind, or of Teeth, or of
the Convulsion, etc. or were choked with Phlegm, or else of Teeth, Convulsion,
and Scowring, apart, or together, which, they say, do often cause one another:
for, I say, it is somewhat, to know how many die usually before they can speak,
or how many live past any assigned number of years.

9. I say, it is enough, if we know from the Searchers but the most predominant
Symptoms; as that one died of the Headache, who was sorely tormented with it,
though the Physicians were of Opinion, that the Disease was in the Stomach.
Again, if one died suddenly, the matter is not great, whether it be reported in
the Bills, Suddenly, Apoplexy, or Planetstrucken, etc.

10. To conclude, In many of these cases the Searchers are able to report the
Opinion of the Physician, who was with the Patient, as they receive the same
from the Friends of the Defunct, and in very many cases, such as Drowning,
Scalding, Bleeding, Vomiting, making-away them selves, Lunatiques, Sores,
Smallpox, etc. their own senses are sufficient, and the generality of the
World, are able pretty well to distinguish the Gowt, Stone, Dropsy,
Falling Sickness, Palsy, Agues, Plurisy, Rickets, etc. one from another.

11. But now as for those Casualties, which are aptest to be confounded, and
mistaken, I shall in the ensuing Discourse presume to touch upon them so far,
as the Learning of these Bills has enabled me.

12. Having premised these general Advertisements, our first Observation upon
the Casualties shall be, that in twenty Years there dying of all diseases and
Casualties, 229250. that 71124. dyed of the Thrush, Convulsion, Rickets, Teeth,
and Worms; and as Abortives, Chrysomes, Infants, Liver-grown, and Overlaid;
that is to say, that about. of the whole died of those Diseases, which we guess
did all light upon Children under four or five Years old.

13. There died also of the Smallpox, Swine-Pox, and Measles, and of Worms
without Convulsions, 12210. of which number we suppose likewise, that about.
might be Children under six Years old. Now, if we consider that 16. of the said
229 thousand died of that extraordinary and grand Casualty the Plague, we shall
find that about thirty six per centum of all quick conceptions, died before
six years old.

14. The second Observation is; That of the said 229250. dying of all Diseases,
there died of acute Diseases (the Plague excepted) but about 50000. or 2/9
parts. The which proportion does give a measure of the state, and disposition
of this Climate, and Air, as to health, these acute, and Epidemical Diseases
happening suddenly, and vehemently, upon the like corruptions, and alterations
in the Air.

15. The third Observation is, that of the said 229. thousand about 70. died of
Chronical Diseases, which shows (as I conceive) the state, and disposition of
the Country (including as well it is Food, as Air) in reference to health, or
rather to longaevity: for as the proportion of Acute and Epidemical Diseases
shows the aptness of the Air to sudden and vehement Impressions, so the
Chronical Diseases show the ordinary temper of the Place, so that upon the
proportion of Chronical Diseases seems to hang the judgment of the fitness of
the Country for long Life. For, I conceive, that in Countries subject to great
Epidemical sweeps men may live very long, but where the proportion of the
Chronical distempers is great, it is not likely to be so; because men being
long sick, and always sickly, cannot live to any great age, as we see in
several sorts of Metal-men, who although they are less subject to acute
Diseases then others, yet seldom live to be old, that is, not to reach unto
those years, which David says is the age of man.

16. The fourth Observation is; That of the said 229000. not 4000. died of
outward Griefs, as of Cancers, Fistulaes, Sores, Ulcers, broken and bruised
Limbs, Impostumes, Itch, King's Evil, Leprosy, Scald-head, Swine-Pox, Wens,
etc. viz. not one in 60.

17. In the next place, whereas many persons live in great fear, and
apprehension of some of the more formidable, and notorious diseases following;
I shall only set down how many died of each: that the respective numbers,
being compared with the Total 229250, those persons may the better understand
the hazard they are in.

Table of notorious Diseases.
Apoplex 1306 Cut of the Stone 0038 Falling Sickness 0074 Dead in the streets
0243 Gowt 0134 Headache 0051 Jaundice 0998 Lethargy 0067 Leprosy 0006 Lunatique
0158 Overlaid, and starved 0529 Palsy 0423 Rupture 0201 Stone and Strangury
0863 Sciatica 0005 Suddenly 0454 Table of Casualties.
Bleeding 069 Burnt, and Scalded 125 Drowned 829 Excessive drinking 002
Frighted 022 Grief 279 Hanged themselves 222 Killed by several accidents 1021
Murdered 0086 Poisoned 014 Smothered 026 Shot 007 Starved 051 Vomiting 136

18. In the foregoing Observations we ventured to make a Standard of the
healthfulness of the Air from the proportion of Acute and Epidemical diseases,
and of the wholesomeness of the Food from that of the Chronical. Yet, forasmuch
as neither of them alone do show the longaevity of the Inhabitants, we shall in
the next place come to the more absolute Standard, and Correction of both,
which is the proportion of the aged, viz. 15757 to the Total 229250. That is of
about 1. to 15. or 7. per Cent. Only the question is, what number of Years the
Searchers call Aged, which I conceive must be the same, that David calls so,
viz. 70. For no man can be said to die properly of Age, who is much less: it
follows from hence, that if in any other Country more then seven of the 100
live beyond 70. such Country is to be esteemed more healthful then this of our
City.

19. Before we speak of particular Casualties, we shall observe, that among the
several Casualties some bear a constant proportion unto the whole number of
Burials; such are Chronical diseases, and the diseases, whereunto the City is
most subject; as for Example, Consumptions, Dropsies, Jaundice, Gowt, Stone,
Palsy, Seurvy, rising of the Lights, or Mother, Rickets, Aged, Agues, Fevers,
Bloody Flux, and Scowring: nay some Accidents, as Grief, Drowning, Men's making
away themselves, and being Killed by several Accidents, etc. do the like,
whereas Epidemical, and Malignant diseases, as the Plague, Purples,
Spotted-Feaver, Smallpox, and Measles do not keep that equality, so as in some
Years, or Months, there died ten times as many as in others.

CHAP. III. Of Particular Casualties.
1. MY first Observation is, That few are starved. This appears, for that of
the 229250 which have died, we find not above fifty one to have been starved,
excepting helpless Infants at Nurse, which being caused rather by carelessness,
ignorance, and infirmity of the Milch-women, is not properly an effect, or sign
of want of food in the Country, or of means to get it.

2. The Observation, which I shall add hereunto, is, That the vast numbers of
Beggars, swarming up and down this City, do all live, and seem to be most of
them healthy and strong; whereupon I make this Question, Whether, since they do
all live by Begging, that is, without any kind of labor; it were not better
for the State to keep them, even although they earned nothing; that so they
might live regularly, and not in that Debauchery, as many Beggars do; and that
they might be cured of their bodily Impotencies, or taught to work, etc. each
according to his condition, and capacity; or by being employed in some work
(not better undone) might be accustomed, and fitted for labor.

3. To this some may Object; That Beggars are now maintained by voluntary
Contributions, whereas in the other way the same must be done by a general Tax;
and consequently, the Objects of Charity would be removed, and taken away.

4. To which we Answer; That in Holland, although no where fewer Beggars appear
to charm up commiseration in the credulous, yet no where is there greater, or
more frequent Charity: only indeed the Magistrate is both the Beggar, and the
disposer of what is gotten by begging; so as all Givers have a Moral certainty,
that their Charity shall be well applied.

5. Moreover, I question; Whether what we give to a Wretch, that shows us
lamentable sores, and mutilations, be always out of the purest charity? that
is, purely for God's sake; for as much as when we see such Objects, we then
feel in our selves a kind of pain, and passion by consent; of which we ease
our selves, when we think we have eased them, with whom we sympathized: or else
we bespeak aforehand the like commiseration in others toward our selves, when
we shall (as we fear we may) fall into the like distress.

6. We have said, 'Twere better the Public should keep the Beggars, though
they earned nothing, etc. But most men will laugh to hear us suppose, That any
able to work (as indeed most Beggars are, in one kind of measure, or another)
should be kept without earning any thing. But we Answer, That if there be but a
certain proportion of work to be done; and that the same be already done by the
not-Beggars; then to employ the Beggars about it, will but transfer the want
from one hand to another; nor can a Learner work so cheap as a skillful
practiced Artist can. As for example, A practiced Spinner shall spin a pound of
Wool worth two shillings for six pence; but a learner, undertaking it for three
pence, shall make the Wool indeed into Yarn, but not worth twelve pence.

7. This little hint is the model of the greatest work in the World, which is
the making England as considerable for Trade as Holland; for there is but a
certain proportion of Trade in the world, and Holland is prepossessed of the
greater part of it, and is thought to have more skill, and experience to manage
it: wherefore, to bring England into Holland's condition, as to this
particular, is the same, as to send all the Beggars about London into the
West-Countrey to Spin, where they shall only spoil the Clothiers Wool, and
beggar the present Spinners at best; but, at worst, put the whole Trade of the
Country to a stand, until the Hollander, being more ready for it, have snapt
that with the rest.

8. My next Observation is; That but few are Murdered, viz. not above 86 of
the 22950. which have died of other diseases, and casualties; whereas in Paris
few nights escape without their Tragedy.

9. The Reasons of this we conceive to be Two: One is the Government, and Guard
of the City by Citizens themselves, and that alternately. No man settling into
a Trade for that employment. And the other is, The natural, and customary
abhorrence of that in humane Crime, and all Bloodshed by most Englishmen: for
of all that are Executed few are for Murder. Besides the great and frequent
Revolutions, and Changes of Government since the year 1650, have been with
little bloodshed; the Usurpers themselves having Executed few in comparison,
upon the Account of disturbing their Innovations.

10. In brief, when any dead Body is found in England, no Algebraist, or
Vncipherer of Letters, can use more subtle suppositions, and variety of
conjectures to find out the Demonstration, or Cipher; then every common
unconcerned Person does to find out the Murderers, and that for ever, until
it be done.

11. The Lunaticks are also but few, viz. 158 in 229250. though I fear many
more then are set down in our Bills, few being entered for such, but those who
die at Bedlam; and there all seem to die of their Lunacie, who died Lunaticks;
for there is much difference in computing the number of Lunaticks, that die
(though of Fevers, and all other Diseases, unto which Lunacie is no
Supersedeas) and those, that die by reason of their Madness.

12. So that, this Casualty being so uncertain, I shall not force my self to
make any inference from the numbers, and proportions we find in our Bills
concerning it: only I dare ensure any man at this present, well in his Wits,
for one in the thousand, that he shall not die a Lunatic in Bedlam, within
these seven years, because I find not above one in about one thousand five
hundred have done so.

13. The like use may be made of the Accounts of men, that made away
themselves, who are another sort of Madmen, that think to ease themselves of
pain by leaping into Hell; or else are yet more Mad, so as to think there is no
such place; or that men may go to rest by death, though they die in
self-murder, the greatest Sin.

14. We shall say nothing of the numbers of those, that have been Drowned,
Killed by falls from Scaffolds, or by Carts running over them, etc. because the
same depends upon the casual Trade, and Employment of men, and upon matters,
which are but circumstantial to the Seasons, and Regions we live in; and
affords little of that Science, and Certainty we aim at.

15. We find one Casualty in our Bills, of which though there be daily talk,
there is little effect, much like our abhorrence of Toads, and Snakes, as most
poisonous Creatures, whereas few men dare say upon their own knowledge, they
ever found harm by either; and this Casualty is the French Pox, gotten, for the
most part, not so much by the intemperate use of Venery (which rather causes
the Gowt) as of many common Women.

16. I say, the Bills of Mortality would take off these Bars, which keep some
men within bounds, as to these extravagancies: for in the aforementioned
229250 we find not above 392 to haved died of the Pox. Now, forasmuch as it is
not good to let the World be lulled into a security, and belief of Impunity by
our Bills, which we intend shall not be only as Death's-heads to put men in
mind of their Mortality, but also as Mercurial Statues to point out the most
dangerous ways, that lead us into it, and misery. We shall therefore show, that
the Pox is not as the Toads, and Snakes aforementioned, but of a quite
contrary nature, together with the reason, why it appears otherwise.

17. Forasmuch as by the ordinary discourse of the world it seems a great part
of men have, at one time, or other, had some species of this disease, I
wondering why so few died of it, especially because I could not take that to be
so harmless, where of so many complained very fiercely; upon inquiry I found
that those who died of it out of the Hospitals (especially that of King's-Land,
and the Lock in Southwark) were returned of Ulcers, and Sores. And in brief I
found, that all mentioned to die of the French Pox were retured by the Clerks
of Saint Giles's, and Saint Martin's in the Fields only; in which place I
understood that most of the vilest, and most miserable houses of uncleanness
were: from whence I concluded, that only hated persons, and such, whose very
Noses were eaten of, were reported by the Searchers to have died of this too
frequent Malady.

18. In the next place, it shall be examined under what name, or Casualtie,
such as die of these diseases are brought in: I say, under the Consumption:
forasmuch, as all dying thereof die so emaciated and lean (their Ulcers
disappearing upon Death) that the Old-women Searchers after the mist of a Cup
of Ale, and the bribe of a two-groat fee, instead of one, given them, cannot
tell whether this emaciation, or leanness were from a Phthisis, or from an
Hectic Fever, Atrophy, etc. or from an Infection of the Spermatick parts,
which in length of time, and in various disguises has at last vitiated the
habit of the Body, and by disabling the parts to digest their nourishment
brought them to the condition of Leanness above mentioned.

19. My next Observation is, that of the Rickets we find no mention among the
Casualties; until the year 1634. and then but of 14 for that whole year.

20. Now the Question is, whether that Disease did first appear about that
time; or whether a Disease, which had been long before, did then first receive
its Name?

21. To clear this Difficulty out of the Bills (for I dare venture on no deeper
Arguments:) I enquired what other Casualties before the year 1634, named in the
Bills, was most like the Rickets; and found, not only by Pretenders to know
it, but also from other Bills, that Liver-grown was the nearest. For in some
years I find Liver-grown, Spleen, and Rickets, put all together, by reason (as
I conceive) of their likeness to each other. Hereupon I added the Livergrowns
of the year 1634, viz. 77, to the Rickets of the same year, viz. 14. making in
all 91. which Total, as also the Number 77. it self, I compared with the
Liver-grown of the precedent year, 1633, viz. 82. All which showed me, that the
Rickets was a new Disease over and above.

22. Now, this being but a faint Argument, I looked both forwards and
backwards, and found, that in the year 1629, when no Rickets appeared, there
was but 94 Liver-growns; and in the year 1636. there was 99 Liver-grown,
although there were also 50 of the Rickets: only this is not to be denied,
that when the Rickets grew very numerous (as in the year 1660, viz. to be 521.)
then there appeared not above 15 of Liver-grown.

23. In the year 1659 were 441 Rickets, and 8 Liver-grown. In the year 1658,
were 476 Rickets, and 51 Liver-grown. Now, though it be granted that these
Diseases were confounded in the judgment of the Nurses, yet it is most certain,
that the Liver-grown did never but once, viz. Anno 1630, exceed 100. whereas
Anno 1660, Liver-grown, and Rickets were 536.

24. It is also to be observed, That the Rickets were never more numerous then
now, and that they are still increasing; for Anno 1649, there was but 190, next
year 260, next after that 329. and so forwards, with some little starting
backwards in some years, until the year 1660, which produced the greatest of
all.

25. Now, such backstartings seem to be universal in all things; for we do not
only see in the progressive motion of the wheels of Watches, and in the rowing
of Boats, that there is a little starting, or jerking backwards between every
step forwards, but also (if I am not much deceived) there appeared the like in
the motion of the Moon, which in the long Telescopes at Gresham-College one may
sensibly discern.

26. There seems also to be another new Disease, called by our Bills The
stopping of the Stomach, first mentioned in the year 1636, the which Malady
from that year to 1647, increased but from 6 to 29; Anno 1655 it came to be
145. In 57, to 277. In 60, to 214. Now these proportions far exceeding the
difference of proportion generally arising from the increase of Inhabitants,
and from the resort of Advenae to the City, shows there is some new Disease,
which appears to the Vulgar as A stopping of the Stomach.

27. Hereupon I apprehended, that this Stopping might be the Green Sickness,
for as much as I find few, or none, to have been returned upon that Account,
although many be visibly stained with it. Now whether the same be forborne out
of shame, I know not? For since the world believes, that Marriage cures it, it
may seem indeed a shame, that any Maid should die uncured, when there are more
Males then Females, that is, an overplus of Husbands to all that can be Wives.

28. In the next place I conjectured, that this stopping of the Stomach might
be the Mother, for as much as I have heard of many troubled with Motherfits (as
they call them) although few returned to have died of them; which conjecture,
if it be true, we may then safely say, That the Mother-fits have also increased.

29. But I was somewhat taken off from thinking this stopping of the Stomach to
be the Mother, because I guessed rather the Rising of the Lights might be it.
For I remembered that some Women, troubled with the Mother-fits, did complain of
a choking in their Throats. Now as I understand, it is more conceivable, that
the Lights, ot Lungs (which I have heard called The Bellows of the Body) not
blowing, that is, neither venting out, nor taking in breath, might rather cause
such a Choking, then that the Mother should rise up thither, and do it. For
methinks, when a woman is with child, there is a greater rising, and yet no
such Fits at all.

30. But what I have said of the Rickets, and stopping of the Stomach, I do in
some measure say of the Rising of the Lights also, viz. that these Risings (be
they what they will) have increased much above the general proportion; for in
1629 there was but 44, and in 1660, 249, viz. almost six times as many.

31. Now for as much as Rickets appear much in the Over-growing of Childrens
Livers, and Spleons (as by the Bills may appear) which surely may cause
stopping of the Stomach by squeezing, and crowding upon that part. And for as
much as these Choakings, or Risings of the Lights may proceed from the same
stuffings, as make the Liver, and Spleen to over-grow their due proportion. And
lastly, for as much as the Rickets, stopping of the Stomach, and rising of the
Lights, have all increased together, and in some kind of correspondent
proportions; it seems to me, that they depend one upon another. And that what
is the Rickets in children may be the other in more grown bodies; for surely
children, which recover of the Rickets, may retain somewhat sufficient to cause
what I have imagined; but of this let the learned Physicians consider, as I
presume they have.

32. I had not meddled thus far, but that I have heard, the first hints of the
circulation of the Blood were taken from a common Person's wondering what
became of all the blood which issued out of the heart, since the heart beats
above three thousand times an hour, although but one drop should be pumpt out
of it, at every stroke.

33. The Stone seemed to decrease: for in 1632, 33, 34, 35, and 36. there died
of the Stone, and Strangury, 254. And in the Years 1655, 56, 57, 58, 59, and
1660* but 250, which numbers although indeed they be almost equal, yet
considering the Burials of the first named five Years were but half those of
the latter, it seems to be decreased by about one half.

34. Now the Stone, and Strangury, are diseases, which most men know, that feel
them, unless it be in some few cases, where (as I have heard Physicians say) a
Stone is held up by the Filmes of the Bladder, and so kept from grating, or
offending it.

35. The Gowt stands much at a stay, that is, it answers the general proportion
of Burials; there dies not above one of 1000. of the Gowt, although I believe
that more die Gowty. The reason is, because those that have the Gowt, are said
to be Long-livers, and therefore, when such die, they are returned as Aged.

36. The Scurvy has likewise increased, and that gradually from 12. Anno 1629.
to 95. Anno 1660.

37. The Tyssick seems to be quite worn away, but that it is probable the same
is entered as Cough, or Consumption.

38. Agues and Fevers are entered promiscuously, yet in the few Bills, wherein
they have been distinguished, it appears, that not above one in 40, of the
whole are Agues.

39. The Abortives, and Stil-born are about the twentieth part of those that
are Christened, and the numbers seem the same thirty Years ago as now, which
shows there were more proportion in those Years then now: or else that in these
latter Years due Accounts have not been kept of the Abortives, as having been
Buried without notice, and perhaps not in Churchyards.

40. For that there has been a neglect in the Accounts of the Christnings is
most certain, because until the year 1642, we find the Burials but equal with
the Christnings, or near thereabouts, but in 1648, when the differences in
Religion had changed the Government, the Christnings were but two thirds of the
Burials. And in the year 1659, not half, viz. the Burials were 14720. (of the
Plague but 36) and the Christnings were but 5670, which great disproportion
could be from no other Cause, then that abovementioned, for as much as the
same grew as the Confusions, and Changes grew.

41. Moreover, although the Bills give us in Anno 1659 but 5670 Christnings,
yet they give us 421 Abortives, and 226 dying in Childbed, whereas in the year
1631, when the Abortives were 410, that is, near the number of the year 1659,
the Christnings were 8288. Wherefore by the proportion of Abortives Anno 1659,
the Christnings should have been about 8500, but if we shall reckon by the
women dying in Childbed, of whom a better Account is kept then of Stil-borns,
and Abortives, we shall find Anno 1659, there were 226 Child-beds; and Anno
1631, 112, viz. not. Wherefore I conceive that the true number of the
Christnings Anno 1659 is above double to the 5690 set down in our Bills; that
is about 11500, and then the Christnings will come near the same proportion to
the Burials, as has been observed in former times.

42. In regular Times, when Accounts were well kept, we find that not above
three in 200 died in Childbed, and that the number of Abortives was about
treble to that of the women dying in Childbed, from whence we may probably
collect, that not one woman of an hundred (I might say of two hundred) dies in
her Labor; for as much as there be other Causes of a woman's dying within the
Month, then the hardness of her Labor.

43. If this be true in these Countries, where women hinder the facility of
their Childbearing by affected straightning of their Bodies; then certainly in
America, where the same is not practiced, Nature is little more to be taxed as
to women, then in Brutes, among whom not one in some thousands do die of their
Deliveries: what I have heard of the Irish-women confirms me herein.

44. Before we quite leave this matter, we shall insert the Causes, why the
Account of Christninos has been neglected more then that of Burials: one, and
the chief whereof was a Religious Opinion against Baptizing of Infants, either
as unlawful, or unnecessary. If this were the only reason, we might by our
defects of this kind, conclude the growth of this Opinion, and pronounce, that
not half the People of England, between the years 1650, and 1660, were
convinced of the need of Baptizing.

45. A second Reason was, The scruples, which many Public Ministers would make
of the worthiness of Parents to have their Children Baptized, which forced such
questioned Parents, who did also not believe the necessity of having their
Children Baptized by such scrupulers, to carry their Children unto such other
Ministers, as having performed the thing, had not the Authority or command of
the Register to enter the names of the Baptized.

46. A third Reason was, That a little Fee was to be paid for the Registrie.

47. Upon the whole matter it is most certain, that the number of Heterodox
Believers was very great between the said year, 1650, and 1660, and so peevish
were they, as not to have the Births of their Children Registered, although
thereby the time of their coming of Age might be known, in respect of such
Inheritances, as might belong unto them; and withal by such Registring it
would have appeared unto what Parish each Child had belonged, in case any of
them should happen to want its relief.

48. Of Convulsions there appeared very few, viz. but 52 in the year 1629,
which 1636 grew to 709, keeping about that stay, till 1659, though sometimes
rising to about 1000.

49. It is to be noted, that from 1629 to 1636, when the Convulsions were but
few, the number of Chrysoms, and Infants was greater: for in 1629, there was of
Chrysoms, and Infants 2596, and of the Convulsion 52, viz. of both, 2648. And
in 1636 there was of Infants 1895, and of the Convulsions 709, in both 2604, by
which it appears, that this difference is likely to be only a confusion in the
Accounts.

50. Moreover, we find that for these later years, since 1636, the Total of
Convulsions and Chrysoms added together are much less, viz. by about 400 or
500, per Annum, then the like Totals from 1626 to 36, which makes me think,
that Teeth also were thrust in under the Title of Chrysoms, and Infants, in as
much as in the said years, from 1629 to 1639, the number of Worms, and Teeth,
wants by about 400 per Annum of what we find in following years.

CAP. IV. Of the Plague.
1. BEfore we leave to discourse of the Casualties, we shall add something
concerning that greatest Disease, or Casualty of all, The Plague.

There have been in London, within this Age, four Times of great Mortality,
that is to say, the years 1592, and 1593, 1603, 1625, and 1636.

There died Annno 1592 from March to December, 25886 Whereof of the Plague
11503 Anno 1593 17844 Whereof of the Plague 10662 Christened in the said year
4021 Anno 1603 within the same space of time, were Buried 37294 Whereof of the
Plague 30561 Anno 1625, within the same space, 51758 Whereof of the Plague
35417 Anno 1636, from April to December 23359 Whereof of the Plague 10400

2. Now it is manifest of it self, in which of these years most died; but in
which of them was the greatest Mortality of all Diseases in general, or of the
Plague in particular, we discover thus. In the year 1592, and 1636, we find
the proportion of those dying of the Plague in the whole to be near alike, that
is about 10 to 23. or 11 to 25. or as about two to five.

3. In the year 1625. we find the Plague to bear unto the whole in proportion
as 35 to 51. or 7 to 10. that is almost the triplicate of the former
proportion, for the Cube of 7. being 343. and the Cube of 10. being 1000. the
said 343. is not 2/5. of 1000.

4. In Anno 1603. the proportion of the Plague to the whole was as 30 to 37.
viz. as 4. to 5. which is yet greater then that last of 7 to 20. For if the
Year 1625. had been as great a Plague-Year as 1603. there must have died not
only 7 to 10. but 8 to 10. which in those great numbers makes a vast
difference.

5. We must therefore conclude the Year 1603. to have been the greatest
Plague-Year of this age.

6. Now to know in which of these 4. was the greatest Mortality at large, we
reason thus,

Anno 1592. Buried 26490 or as 6 Christened 4277 1 There died in the whole or as
8 Anno 1603. Year of all 38244 Christened 4784 1 Died in the whole or as 8 1. to
8. or Anno 1625. Year 54265 1. 1/4. to 10. Christened 6983 1 Anno 1636. There
died, ut supra 23359 or as 5 Christened 9522 2

7. From whence it appears, that Anno 1636. the Christnings were about. parts
of the Burials. Anno 1592. but. but in the Year 1603. and 1625. not above an
eighth, so that the said two Years were the Years of greatest Mortality. We
said that the year 1603. was the greatest Plague year. And now we say, that the
same was not a greater year of Mortality then Anno 1625. Now to reconcile these
two Positions, we must alledg, that Anno 1625. there was error in the
Accompots, or Distinctions of the Casualties; that is, more died of the Plague
then were accounted for under that name. Which Allegation we also prove thus,
viz.

8. In the said year 1625. there are said to have died of the Plague 35417. and
of all other Diseases 18848. whereas in the years, both before and after the
same, the ordinary number of Burials was between 7. and 8000. so that if we add
about 11000. (which is the difference between 7. and 18) to our 35. the whole
will be 46000. which bears to the whole 54000. as about 4. to 5. thereby
rendering the said year 1625. to be as great a Plague-year as that of 1603. and
no greater, which answers to what we proved before, viz. that the Mortality of
the two Years was equal.

9. From whence we may probably suspect that about. part more died of the
Plague then are returned for such; which we further prove by noting, that Anno
1636. there died 10400. of the Plague, the. whereof is 2600. Now there are said
to have died of all diseases that Year 12959. out of which number deducting
2600. there remains 10359. more then which there died not in several years next
before and after the said year 1636.

10. The next Observation we shall offer is, that the Plague of 1603. lasted
eight Years. In some whereof there died above 4000, in others above 2000, and
in but one less then 600: whereas in the Year 1624. next preceding, and in the
year 1626. next following the said great Plague-year 1625. There died in the
former but 11, and in the latter but 134. of the Plague. Moreover in the said
year 1625. the Plague decreased from its utmost number 4461 a week, to below
1000 within six weeks.

11. The Plague of 1636. lasted twelve Years, in eight whereof there died 2000.
per annum one with another, and never under 300. The which shows, that the
Contagion of the Plague depends more upon the Disposition of the Air, then upon
the Effluvia from the Bodies of Men.

12. Which also we prove by the sudden jumps, which the Plague has made,
leaping in one Week from 118 to 927: and back again from 993 to 258: and from
thence again the very next Week to 852. The which effects must surely be rather
attributed to change of the Air, then of the Constitution of Men's bodies,
otherwise then as this depends upon that.

13. It may be also noted, that many times other Pestilential Diseases, as
Purple-Feavers, Smallpox, etc. do forerun the Plague a Year, two, or three,
for in 1622; there died but 8000. in 1623; 11000: in 24. about 12000: till in
1625 there died of all Diseases above 54000.

CHAP. V. Other Observations upon the Plague, and Casualties.
1. THe Decrease, and Increase of People is to be reckoned chiefly by
Christnings, because few bear children in London but Inhabitants, though others
die there. The Accounts of Christnings were well kept, until differences in
Religion occasioned some neglect therein, although even these neglects we must
confess to have been regular, and proportionable.

2. By the numbers and proportions of Christnings, therefore we observe as
follows, viz.

First, That (when from December, 1602, to March following, there was little,
or no Plague) then the Christnings at a Medium, were between 110, and 130 per
Week, few Weeks being above the one, or below the other; but when from thence
to July the Plague increased, that then the Christnings decreased to under 90.

Secondly, The Question is, Whether Teeming-women died, or fled, or miscarried?
The later at this time, seems most probable, because even in the said space,
between March, and July, there died not above twenty per Week of the Plague,
which small number could neither cause the death, or flight of so many Women,
as to alter the proportion part lower.

3. Moreover, we observe from the 21 of July to the 21 of October, the Plague
increasing, reduced the Christnings to 70 at a Medium, diminishing the above
proportion, down to. Now the cause of this must be flying, and death, as well
as miscarriages, and Abortions; for there died within that time about 25000,
whereof many were certainly Women with child, besides the fright of so many
dying within so small a time might drive away so many others, as to cause this
effect.

4. From December 1624, to the middle of April 1625, there died not above 5 a
Week of the Plague one with another. In this time, the Christnings were one
with another 180. The which decreased gradually by the 22 of September to 75,
or from the proportion of 12 to 5, which evidently squares with our former
Observation.

5. The next Observation we shall offer, is, The time wherein the City has
been Re-peopled after a great Plague; which we affirm to be by the second year.
For in 1627, the Christnings (which are our Standard in this Case) were 8408,
which in 1624 next preceding the Plague year 1625 (that had swept away above
54000) were but 8299, and the Christnings of 1626 (which were but 6701) mounted
in one year to the said 8408.

6. Now the Cause hereof, for as much as it cannot be a supply by Procreations;
Ergo, it must be by new Affluxes to London out of the Country.

7. We might fortify this Assertion by showing, that before the Plague-year,
1603, the Christnings were about 6000, which were in that very year reduced to
4789, but crept up the next year 1604, to 5458, recovering their former
ordinary proportion in 1605 of 6504, about which proportion it stood till the
year 1610.

8. I say, it follows, that, let the Mortality be what it will, the City
repairs its loss of Inhabitants within two years, which Observation lessens the
Objection made against the value of houses in London, as if they were liable to
great prejudice through the loss of Inhabitants by the Plague.

CHAP. VI. Of the Sickliness, Healthfulness, and Fruitfulness of Seasons.
1. HAving spoken of Casualties, we come next to compare the sickliness,
healthfulness, and fruitfulness of the several Years, and Seasons, one with
another. And first, having in the Chapters aforegoing mentioned the several
years of Plague, we shall next present the several other sickly years; we
meaning by a sickly Year, such wherein the Burials exceed those, both of the
precedent, and subsequent years, and not above 200 dying of the Plague, for
such we call Plague-Years; and this we do, that the World may see, by what
spaces, and intervals we may hereafter expect such times again. Now, we may not
call that a more sickly year, wherein more die, because such excess of Burials
may proceed from increase, and access of People to the City only.

2. Such sickly years were 1618, 20, 23, 24, 1632, 33, 34, 1649, 52, 54, 56,
58, 61, as may be seen by the Tables.

3. In reference to this Observation, we shall present another, namely, That
the more sickly the years are, the less fecund, or fruitful of Children also
they be, which will appear, if the number of Children born in the said sickly
years be less, then that of the years both next preceding, and next following;
all which, upon view of the Tables, will be found true, except in a very few
Cases, where sometimes the precedent, and sometimes the subsequent years vary a
little, but never both together. Moreover, for the confirmation of this Truth,
we present you the year 1660, where the Burials were fewer then in either of
the two next precedent years by 2000, and fewer then in the subsequent by above
4000. And withal, the number of Christnings in the said year 1660 was far
greater then in any of the three years next aforegoing.

4. As to this year 1660, although we would not be thought Superstitious, yet
is it not to be neglected, that in the said year was the King's Restoration to
his Empire over these three Nations, as if God Almighty had caused the
healthfulness and fruitfulness thereof to repair the Bloodshed, and Clamities
suffered in his absence. I say, this conceit does abundantly counterpoise the
Opinion of those who think great Plagues come in with Kings reigns, because it
happened so twice, viz. Anno 1603, and 1625, whereas as well the year 1648,
wherein the present King commenced his right to reign, as also the year 1660,
wherein he commenced the exercise of the same, were both eminently healthful,
which clears both Monarchy, and our present King's Family from what seditious
men have surmised against them.

5. The Diseases, which beside the Plague make years unhealthfull in this City,
are Spotted Fevers, Small Pox, Dysentery, called by some The Plague in the
Guts, and the unhealthfull Season is the Autumn.

CHAP. VII. Of the difference between Burials, and Christnings.
1. THe next Observation is, That in the said Bills there are far more Burials,
then Christnings. This is plain, depending only upon Arithmetical computation;
for, in 40 years, from the year 1603, to the year 1644, exclusive of both
years, there have been set down (as happening within the same ground, space, or
Parishes) although differently numbered, and divided, 363935 Burials, and but
330747 Christnings within the 97, 16, and 10 out-Parishes, those of
Westminster, Lambeth, Newington, Redriff, Stepney, Hackney, and Islington, not
being included.

2. From this single Observation it will follow, That London has decreased in
its People, the contrary whereof we see by its daily increase of Buildings upon
new Foundations, and by the turning of great Palacious Houses into small
Tenements. It is therefore certain, that London is supplied with People from
out of the Country, whereby not only to repair the overplus difference of
Burials abovementioned, but likewise to increase its Inhabitants according to
the said increase of housing.

3. This supplying of London seems to be the reason, why Winchester, Lincoln,
and several other Cities have decreased in their Buildings, and consequently in
their Inhabitants. The same may be suspected of many Towns in Cornwall, and
other places, which probably, when they were first allowed to send Burgesses to
the Parliament, were more populous then now, and bore another proportion to
London then now; for several of those Buroughs send two Burgesses, whereas
London it self sends but four, although it bears the fifteenth part of the
charge of the whole Nation in all Public Taxes, and Levies.

4. But, if we consider what I have upon exact enquiry found true, viz. That in
the Country, within ninety years, there have been 6339 Christnings, and but
5280 Burials, the increase of London will be salved without inferring the
decrease of the People in the Country; and withal, in case all England have
but fourteen times more People then London, it will appear, how the said
increase of the Country may increase the People, both of London, and it self;
for if there be in the 97, 16, 10, and 7 Parishes, usually comprehended within
our Bills, but 460000 souls as hereafter we shall show, then there are in all
England, and Wales, 6440000 Persons, out of which substract 460000, for those
in, and about London, there remains 5980000 in the Country, the which
increasing about 1/7 part in 40 years, as we shall hereafter prove, does happen
in the Country, the whole increase of the Country will be about 854000 in the
said time, out of which number, if but about 250000 be sent up to London in the
said 40 years, viz. about 6000 per Annum, the said Missions will make good the
alterations, which we find to have been in, and about London, between the
years 1603 and 1644 abovementioned. But that 250000 will do the same, I prove
thus, viz. in the 8 years, from 1603 to 1612, the Burials in all the Parishes,
and of all Diseases, the Plague included, were at a Medium 9750 per Annum. And
between 1635 and 1644 were 18000, the difference whereof is 8250, which is the
Total of the increase of the Burials in 40 years, that is about 206 per Annum.
Now, to make the Burials increase 206 per Annum, there must be added to the
City thirty times as many (according to the proportion of 3 dying out of 41
Families) viz. 6180 Advenae, the which number multiplied again by the 40 years,
makes the Product 247200, which is less then the 250000 above propounded; so as
there remains above 600000 of increase in the Country within the said 40
years, either to render it more populous, or send forth into other Colonies, or
Wars. But that England has fourteen times more People, is not improbable, for
the Reasons following.

1. London is observed to bear about the fifteenth proportion of the whole Tax.

2. There is in England, and Wales, about 39000 square Miles of Land, and we
have computed that in one of the greatest Parishes in Hampshire, being also a
Market Town, and containing twelve square Miles, there are 220 souls in every
square Mile, out of which I abate for the overplus of People more in that
Parish, then in other wild Counties. So as the parts of the said 220,
multiplied by the Total of square Miles, produces 6400000 souls in all London
included.

3. There are about 100000 Parishes in England, and Wales, the which, although
they should not contain the part of the Land, nor the of the People of that
Country-Parish, which we have examined, yet may be supposed to contain about
600 People, one with another, according to which Account there will be six
Millions of People in the Nation. I might add, that there are in England, and
Wales, about five and twenty Millions of Acres at 16 Foot to the Perch; and if
there be six Millions of People, then there is about four Acres for every head,
which how well it agrees to the Rules of Plantation, I leave unto others, not
only as a means to examine my Assertion, but as an hint to their enquiry
concerning the fundamental Trade, which is Husbandry, and Plantation.

4. Upon the whole matter we may therefore conclude, That the People of the
whole Nation do increase, and consequently the decrease of Winchester, Lincoln,
and other like places, must be attributed to other Reasons, then that of
refurnishing London only.

5. We come to show, why although in the Country the Christnings exceed the
Burials, yet in London they do not. The general Reason of this must be, that in
London the proportion of those subject to die unto those capable of breeding is
greater then in the Country; That is, let there be an hundred Persons in
London, and as many in the Country; we say, that if there be 60 of them
Breeders in London, there are more then 60 in the Country, or else we must say,
that London is more unhealthfull, or that it enclines men and women more to
Barrenness, then the Country, which by comparing the Burials, and Christnings
of Hackney, Newington, and the other Country-Parishes, with the most Smoaky,
and Stinking parts of the City, is scarce discernable in any considerable
degree.

6. Now that the Breeders in London are proportionally fewer then those in the
Country arises from these reasons, viz.

1. All that have business to the Court of the King, or to the Courts of
Justice, and all Countrymen coming up to bring Provisions to the City, or to
buy Foreign Commodities, Manufactures, and Rarities, do for the most part leave
their Wives in the Country.

2. Persons coming to live in London out of curiosity, and pleasure, as also
such as would retire, and live privately, do the same, if they have any.

3. Such, as come up to be cured of Diseases, do scarce use their Wives pro
tempore.

4. That many Apprentices of London, who are bound seven, or nine years from
Marriage, do often stay longer voluntarily.

5. That many Seamen of London leave their Wives behind them, who are more
subject to die in the absence of their Husbands, then to breed either without
men, or with the use of many promiscuously.

6. As for unhealthiness it may well be supposed, that although seasoned Bodies
may, and do live near as long in London, as elsewhere, yet new-comers, and
Children do not, for the Smoaks, Stinks, and close Air are less healthful then
that of the Country; otherwise why do sickly Persons remove into the Country
Air? And why are there more old men in Countries then in London, per rata? And
although the difference in Hackney, and Newington, abovementioned, be not very
notorious, yet the reason may be their vicinity to London, and that the
Inhabitants are most such, whose bodies have first been impaired with the
London Air, before they withdraw thither.

7. As to the causes of Barrenness in London, I say, that although there should
be none extraordinary in the Native Air of the place, yet the intemperance in
feeding, and especially the Adulteries and Fornications, supposed more frequent
in London then elsewhere, do certainly hinder breeding. For a Woman, admitting
10 Men, is so far from having ten times as many Children, that she has none at
all.

8. Add to this, that the minds of men in London are more thoughtfull and full
of business then in the Country, where their work is corporal Labor, and
Exercizes. All which promote Breedings, whereas Anxieties of the mind hinder
it.

CHHP. VIII. Of the difference between the numbers of Males, and Females.
THe next Observation is, That there be more Males then Females.

There have been Buried from the year 1628, to the year 1662, exclusive, 209436
Males, and but 190474 Females: but it will be objected, that in London it may
indeed be so, though otherwise elsewhere; because London is the great Stage and
Shop of business, wherein the Masculine Sex bears the greatest part. But we
Answer, That there have been also Christened within the same time, 139782 Males,
and but 130866 Females, and that the Country Accounts are consonant enough to
those of London upon this matter.

2. What the Causes hereof are, we shall not trouble our selves to conjecture,
as in other Cases, only we shall desire, that Travelers would enquire whether
it be the same in other Countries.

3. We should have given an Account, how in every Age these proportions change
here, but that we have Bills of distinction but for 32 years, so that we shall
pass from hence to some inferences from this Conclusion; as first,

I. That Christian Religion, prohibiting Polygamy, is more agreeable to the Law
of Nature, that is, the Law of God, then Mahumetism, and others, that allow it;
for one man his having many women, or wives by Law, signifies nothing, unless
there were many women to one man in Nature also.

II. The obvious Objection hereunto is, That one Horse, Bull, or Ram, having
each of them many Females, do promote increase. To which I Answer, That
although perhaps there be naturally, even of these species, more Males then
Females, yet artificially, that is, by making Geldings, Oxen, and Weathers,
there are fewer. From whence it will follow, That when by experience it is
found how many Ews (suppose twenty) one Ram will serve, we may know what
proportion of male-Lambs to castrate, or geld, viz. nineteen, or thereabouts:
for if you emasculate fewer, viz. but ten, you shall by promiscuous copulation
of each of those ten with two Females, (in such as admit the Male after
conception) hinder the increase so far, as the admittance of two Males will do
it: but, if you castrate none at all, it is highly probable, that every of the
twenty Males copulating with every of the twenty Females, there will be little,
or no conception in any of them all.

III. And this I take to be the truest Reason, why Foxes, Wolves, and other
Vermin Animals that are not gelt, increase not faster then Sheep, when as so
many thousands of these are daily Butchered, and very few of the other die
otherwise then of themselves.

4. We have hitherto said there are more Males, then Females; we say next, That
the one exceed the other by about a thirteenth part; so that although more men
die violent deaths then women, that is, more are slain in Wars, killed by
mischance, drowned at Sea, and die by the Hand of Justice. Moreover, more men
go to Colonies, and travel into foreign parts, then women. And lastly, more
remain unmarried, then of women, as Fellows of Colleges, and Apprentises, above
eighteen, etc. yet the said thirteenth part difference brings the business
but to such a pass, that every woman may have an Husband, without the allowance
of Polygamy.

5. Moreover, although a man be Prolifique forty years, and a woman but five
and twenty, which makes the Males to be as 560 to 325 Females, yet the causes
above named, and the later marriage of the men, reduce all to an equality.

6. It appearing, that there were fourteen men to thirteen women, and that they
die in the same proportion also, yet I have heard Physicians say, that they
have two women Patients to one man, which Assertion seems very likely; for that
women have either the Green Sickness, or other like Distempers, are sick of
Breedings, Abortions, Childbearing, Sore-breasts, Whites, Obstructions, Fits
of the Mother, and the like.

7. Now, from this it should follow, that more women should die then men, if
the number of Burials answered in proportion to that of Sicknesses: but this
must be salved, either by the alleging, that the Physicians cure those
Sicknesses, so as few more die, then if none were sick; or else that men, being
more intemperate then women, die as much by reason of their Vices, as the women
do by the Infirmity of their Sex, and consequently, more Males being born,
then Females, more also die.

8. In the year 1642 many Males went out of London into the Wars then
beginning, in so much, as I expected in the succeeding year, 1643, to have
found the Burials of Females to have exceeded those of Males, but no alteration
appeared; for as much, as I suppose, Trading continuing the same in London, all
those who lost their Apprentices had others out of the Country; and if any
left their Trades, or Shops, that others forthwith succeeded them: for if
employment for hands remain the same, no doubt but the number of them could not
long continue in disproportion.

9. Another pregnant Argument to the same purpose (which has already been
touched on) is, That although in the very year of the Plague, the Christnings
decreased, by the dying and flying of Teeming-women, yet the very next year
after, they increased somewhat, but the second after, to as full a number as in
the second year before the said Plague: for I say again, if there be
encouragement for an hundred in London, that is, a Way how an hundred may live
better then in the Country, and if there be void housing there to receive
them, the evacuating of a th, or part of that number, must soon be supplied out
of the Country; so as, the great Plague does not lessen the Inhabitants of the
City, but of the Country, who in a short time remove themselves from hence
thither, so long, until the City for want of receipt and encouragement,
regurgitates and sends them back.

10. From the difference between Males and Females, we see the reason of making
Eunuchs in those places where Polygamy is allowed, the latter being useless as
to multiplication, without the former, as was said before in the case of Sheep
and other Animals, usually gelt in these Countries.

11. By consequence, this practice of Castracon serves as well to promote
increase as to meliorate the Flesh of those Beasts that suffer it. For that
Operation is equally practiced upon Horses which are not used for Food, as upon
those that are.

12. In Popish Countries where Polygamy is forbidden, if a greater number of
Males oblige themselves to Caelibate then the natural overplus or difference
between them and Females amounts unto; then multiplication is hindered; for if
there be eight Men to ten Women, all of which eight men are married to eight of
the ten Women, then the other two bear no Children, as either admitting no Man
at all, or else admitting Men as Whores (that is more then one) which commonly
procreates no more then if none at all had been used: or else such unlawful
Copulations beget Conceptions but to frustrate them by procured Abortions or
secret Murders, all which returns to the same reckoning. Now, if the same
proportion of women oblige themselves to a single life like-wise, then such
obligation makes no change in this matter of increase.

13. From what has been said, appears the reason why the Law is, and ought to
be so strict against Fornications and Adulteries, for if there were universal
liberty, the Increase of Mankind would be but like that of Foxes at best.

14. Now forasmuch as Princes are not only Powerful but Rich, according to the
number of their People (Hands being the Father, as Lands are the Mother, and
Womb of Wealth) it is no wonder why states by encouraging Marriage, and
hindering Licentiousness, advance their own Interest, as well as preserve the
Laws of God from contempt, and Violation.

15. It is a Blessing to Mankind, that by this overplus of Males there is this
natural Bar to Polygamy: for in such a state Women could not live in that
parity, and equality of expense with their Husbands, as now, and here they do.

16. The reason whereof is, not, that the Husband cannot maintain as splendidly
three, as one; for he might, having three Wives, live himself upon a quarter of
his Income, that is in a parity with all three, as-well as, having but one,
live in the same parity at half with her alone: but rather, because that to
keep them all quiet with each other, and himself, he must keep them all in
greater aw, and less splendour, which power he having will probably use it to
keep them all as low, as he pleases, and at no more cost then makes for his own
pleasure; the poorest Subjects (such as this plurality of Wives must be) being
most easily governed.

CHAP. IX. Of the growth of the City.
1. IN the year 1593 there died in the ninety seven Parishes within the walls,
and the sixteen without the walls (besides 421 of the Plague) 3508. And the
next year 3478, besides 29 of the Plague: in both years 6986. Twenty years
after, there died in the same ninety seven, and sixteen Parishes, 12110, viz.
Anno 1614, 5873; and Anno 1615, 6237: so as the said Parishes are increased, in
the said time, from seven to twelve, or very near thereabouts.

2. Moreover, the Burials within the like space of he next twenty years, viz.
Anno 1634, and 1635, vere 15625, viz. as about twenty four to thirty one: he
which last of the three numbers, 15625, is much more then double to the first
6986, viz. the said Parishes have in forty years increased from twenty three
to fifty two.

3. Where is to be noted, That although we were necessitated to compound the
said ninety seven with the sixteen Parishes, yet the sixteen Parishes have
increased faster then the ninety seven. For, in the year 1620, there died
within the walls 2726, and in 1660 there died but 3098 (both years being clear
of the Plague) so as in this forty years the said ninety seven Parishes have
increased but from nine to ten, or thereabouts, because the housing of the said
ninety seven Parishes could be no otherwise increased, then by turning great
Houses into Tenements, and building upon a few Gardens.

4. In the year 1604, there died in the ninety seven Parishes 1518, and of the
Plague 280. And in the year 1660, 3098, and none of the Plague, so as in fifty
six years the said Parishes have doubled: Where note, that forasmuch as the
said year 1604 was the very next year after the great Plague, 1603 (when the
City was not yet re-peopled) we shall rather make the comparison between 2014,
which died Anno 1605, and 3431 Anno 1659, choosing rather from hence to assert,
that the said ninety seven, and sixteen Parishes increased from twenty to
thirty four, or from ten to seventeen in fifty four years, then from one to two
in fifty six, as in the last aforegoing Paragraph is set down.

5. Anno 1605, there died in the sixteen out-Parishes 2974, and Anno 1659,
6988, so as in the fifty four years, the said Parishes have increased from
three to seven.

6. Anno 1605 there died in the eight out-parishes, 960, Anno 1659, there died
in the same scope of Ground, although called now ten Parishes (the Savoy, and
Covent Garden being added) 4301, so as the said Parishes have increased within
the said fifty four years, more then from one to four.

7. Moreover, there was Buried in all, Anno 1605, 5948, and Anno 1659 14720,
viz. about two to five.

8. Having set down the proportions, wherein we find the said three great
Divisions of the whole Pyle, called London, to have increased; we come next to
show what particular Parishes have had the most remarkable share in these
Augmentations, viz. of the ninty seven Parishes within the Walls the Increase
is not very discernable, but where great houses formerly belonging to Noblemen
before they built others near White Hall, have been turned into Tenements, upon
which Account Alhallows on the wall is increased, by the conversion of the
Marquess of Winchesters house, lately the Spanish Ambassadors, into a New
street, the like of Alderman Freeman, and La Motte near the Exchange, the like
of the Earl of Arundells in Loathbury, the like of the Bishop of London's
Palace, the Dean of Paul's, and the Lord River's house, now in hand, as also of
the Dukes-Place, and others heretofore.

9. Of the sixteen Parishes next without the Walls, Saint Gile's Criplegate
has been most enlarged, next to that, Saint Olave's Southwark, then Saint
Andrews Holborn, then White-Chappel, the difference in the rest not being
considerable.

10. Of the out Parishes now called ten, formerly nine, and before that eight,
Saint Gile's, and Saint Martins in the fields, are most increased,
notwithstanding Saint Paul's Covent Garden was taken out of them both.

11. The general observation which arises from hence is, That the City of
London gradually removes Westward, and did not the Royal Exchange, and
London-Bridg stay the Trade, it would remove much faster, for
Leaden-Hall-street, Bishops-gate, and part of Fan-church-street, have lost
their ancient Trade, Grace Church Street indeed keeping it self yet entire, by
reason of its conjunction with, and relation to London-Bridg.

12. Again, Canning-street, and Watlin-street have lost their Trade of
Woollen-Drapery to Paul's Churchyard, Ludgate Hill, and Fleet Street; the
Mercery is gone from out of Lombard Street, and Cheapside, into
Paternoster Row, and Fleet Street.

13. The reasons whereof are, that the King's Court (in old times frequently
kept in the City) is now always at Westminster. Secondly, the use of Coaches,
whereunto the narrow streets of the old City are unfit, has caused the
building of those broader streets in Covent Garden, etc.

14. Thirdly, where the Consumption of Commodity is, viz. among the Gentry, the
vendors of the same must seat themselves.

15. Fourthly, the cramming up of the void spaces, and gardens within the
Walls, with houses, to the prejudice of Light, and Air, have made men Build new
ones, where they less fear those inconveniences.

16. Conformity in Building to other civil Nations has disposed us to let our
old Wooden dark houses fall to decay, and to build new ones, whereby to answer
all the ends abovementioned.

17. Where note, that when Lud-gate was the only Western Gate of the City,
little Building was Westward thereof. But when Holborn began to increase
Newgate was made. But now both these Gates are not sufficient for the
Communication between the Walled City, and its enlarged Western Suburbs, as
daily appears by the intolerable stops and embaresses of Coaches near both
these Gates, especially Lud-gate.

CHAP. X. Of the Inequality of Parishes.
1. BEfore we pass from hence, we shall offer to consideration the inequality
of Parishes in, and about London, evident in the proportion of their respective
Burials; for in the same year were Buried in Cripple-gate-Parish 1191, that but
twelve died in Trinity-Minories, St. Savior's Southwark, and Botolph's
Bishop-gate, being of the middle size, as burying five and 600 per Annum; so
that Cripple-gate is an hundred times as big as the Minories, and 200 times as
big as St. John the Euangelist's, Mary-Cole-church, Bennet's Grace-church,
Matthew-Friday-street, and some others within the City.

2. Hence may arise this Question, Wherefore should this inequality be
continued? If it be Answered, Because that Pastors of all sorts, and sizes of
Abilities, may have Benefices, each man according to his merit: we Answer, That
a two hundredth part of the best Parson's learning is scarce enough for a
Sexton. But besides, there seems no reason of any differences at all, it being
as much Science to save one single soul, as one thousand.

3. We incline therefore to think the Parishes should be equal, or near,
because, in the Reformed Religions, the principal use of Churches is to Preach
in: now the bigness of such a Church ought to be no greater, then that, unto
which the voice of a Preacher of middling Lungs will eafily extend; I say,
easily, because they speak an hour, or more together.

4. The use of such large Churches, as Paul's, is now wholly lost, we having no
need of saying perhaps fifty Masses all at one time, nor of making those grand
Processions frequent in the Romish Church; nor is the shape of our Cathedral
proper at all for our Preaching Auditories, but rather the Figure of an
Amphi-Theatre with Galleries, gradually over-looking each other; for unto this
Condition the Parish-Churches of London are driving apace, as appears by the
many Galleries every day built in them.

5. Moreover, if Parishes were brought to the size of Colman-street,
Alhallows-Barking, Christ-Church, Blackfriars, etc* in each whereof die
between 100 and 150, per Annum, then an hundred Parishes would be a fit, and
equal Division of this great charge, and all the Ministers (some whereof have
now scarce forty pounds per Annum) might obtain a subsistence.

6. And lastly, The Churchwardens, and Overseers of the Poor might find it
possible to discharge their Duties, whereas now in the greater out-Parishes
many of the poorer Parishioners through neglect do perish, and many vicious
persons get liberty to live as they please, for want of some heedfull Eye to
overlook them.

CHAP. XI. Of the number of Inhabitants.
1. I Have been several times in company with men of great experience in this
City, and have heard them talk seldom under Millions of People to be in London,
all which I was apt enough to believe, until, on a certain day, one of eminent
Reputation was upon occasion asserting, that there was in the year 1661 two
Millions of People more then Anno 1625, before the great Plague; I must
confess, that, until this provocation, I had been frighted with that
mis-understood Example of David, from attempting any computation of the People
of this populous place; but hereupon I both examined the lawfulness of making
such enquiries, and, being satisfied thereof, went about the work it self in
this manner: viz.

2. First, I imagined, That, if the Conjecture of the worthy Person
aforementioned had any truth in it, there must needs be about six, or seven
Millions of People in London now; but repairing to my Bills I found, that not
above 15000 per Annum were buried, and consequently, that not above one in four
hundred must die per Annum, if the Total were but six Millions.

3. Next considering, That it is esteemed an even Lay, whether any man lives
ten years longer, I supposed it was the same, that one of any 10 might die
within one year. But when I considered, that of the 15000 aforementioned about
5000 were Abortive, and Stilborn, or died of Teeth, Convulsion, Rickets, or as
Infants, and Chrysoms, and Aged. I concluded, that of men, and women, between
ten and sixty, there scarce died 10000 per Annum in London, which number being
multiplied by 10, there must be but 100000 in all, that is not the 1/60 part of
what the Alderman imagined. These were but sudden thoughts on both sides, and
both far from truth, I thereupon endeavored to get a little nearer, thus: viz.

4. I considered, that the number of Childbearing women might be about double
to the Births: forasmuch as such women, one with another, have scarce more then
one Child in two years. The number of Births I found, by those years, wherein
the Registries were well kept, to have been somewhat less then the Burials. The
Burials in these late years at a Medium are about 13000, and consequently the
Christnings not above 12000. I therefore esteemed the number of Teeming women
to be 24000: then I imagined, that there might be twice as many Families, as of
such women; for that there might be twice as many women Aged between 16 and 76,
as between 16 and 40, or between 20 and 44; and that there were about eight
Persons in a Family, one with another, viz. the Man, and his Wife, three
Children, and three Servants, or Lodgers: now 8 times 48000 makes 384000.

5. Secondly, I find by telling the number of Families in some Parishes within
the walls, that 3 out of 11 families per an* have died: wherefore, 13000 having
died in the whole, it should follow, there were 48000 Families according to the
last mentioned Acccompt.

6. Thirdly, the Account, which I made of the Trayned-Bands, and Auxiliary
Soldiers, does enough justify this Account.

7. And lastly I took the Map of London set out in the year 1658 by Richard
Newcourt, drawn by a scale of Yards. Now I guessed that in 100 yards square
there might be about 54 Families, supposing every house to be 20 foot in the
front: for on two sides of the said square there will be 100 yards of housing
in each, and in the two other sides 80 each; in all 360 yards: that is 54
Families in each square, of which there are 220 within the Walls, making in all
11880 Families within the Walls. But forasmuch as there die within the Walls
about 3200 per Annum, and in the whole about 13000; it follows, that the
housing within the Walls is * part of the whole, and consequently, that there
are 47520 Families in, and about London, which agrees well enough with all my
former computations: the worst whereof does sufficiently demonstrate, that
there are no Millions of People in London, which nevertheless most men do
believe, as they do, that there be three Women for one Man, whereas there are
fourteen Men for thirteen Women, as else where has been said.

8. We have (though perhaps too much at Random) determined the number of the
inhabitants of London to be about 384000: the which being granted, we assert,
that 199112 are Males, and 184886 Females.

9. Whereas we have found, that of 100 quick Conceptions about 36 of them die
before they be six years old, and that perhaps but one surviveth 76, we, having
seven Decads between six and 76, we sought six mean proportional numbers
between 64, the remainder, living at six years, and the one, which survives 76,
and find, that the numbers following are practically near enough to the truth;
for men do not die in exact Proportions, nor in Fractions: from whence arises
this Table following.

Viz. of 100 there dies within the first six years 36 The next ten years, or
Decad 24 The second Decad 15 The third Decad 09 The fourth 6 The next 4 The
next 3 The next 2 The next 1

10. From whence it follows, that of the said 100 conceived there remains alive
at six years end 64.

At Sixteen years end 40 At Twenty six 25 At Tirty six 16 At Forty six 10 At
Fifty six 6 At Sixty six 3 At Seventy six 1 At Eighty 0

11. It follows also, that of all, which have been conceived, there are now
alive 40 per Cent. above sixteen years old, 25 above twenty six years old, and
sic deinceps, as in the above Table: there are therefore of Aged between 16,
and 56, the number of 40, less by six, viz. 34; of between 26, and 66, the
number of 25 less by three, viz. 22: and sic deniceps.

Wherefore, supposing there be 199112 Males, and the number between 16, and 56,
being 34. It follows, there are 34 per Cent. of all those Males fighting Men in
London, that is 67694, viz. near 70000: the truth whereof I leave to
examination, only the. of 67694, viz. 13539. is to be added for Westminster,
Stepney, Lambeth, and the other distant Parishes, making in all 81233 fighting
Men.

12. The next enquiry shall be, In how long time the City of London shall, by
the ordinary proportion of Breeding, and Dying, double its breeding People. I
answer in about seven years, and (Plagues considered) eight. Wherefore since
there be 24000 pair of Breeders, that is. of the whole, it follows, that in
eight times eight years the whole People of the City shall double without the
access of Foreigners: the which contradicts not our Account of its growing from
two to five in 56 years with such accesses.

13. According to this proportion, one couple viz. Adam and Eve, doubling
themselves every 64 years of the 5610 years, which is the age of the World
according to the Scriptures, shall produce far more People, then are now in it.
Wherefore the World is not above 100 thousand years, old as some vainly
Imagine, nor above what the Scripture makes it.

CHAP. XII. Of the Country Bills.
WE have, for the present, done with our Observations upon the Accounts of
Burials, and Christnings, in, and about London; we shall next present the
Accounts of both Burials, Christnings, and also of Weddings in the Country,
having to that purpose inserted Tables of 90 years for a certain Parish in
Hampshire, being a place neither famous for Longevity, and Healthfulness, nor
for the contrary. Upon which Tables we observe,

1. That every Wedding, one with another, produces four Children, and
consequently, that that is the proportion of Children, which any Marriagable
man, or woman may be presumed shall have. For, though a man may be Married more
then once, yet, being once Married, he may die without any Issue at all.

2. That in this Parish there were born 15 Females for 16 Males, whereas in
London there were 13 for 14, which shows, that London is somewhat more apt to
produce Males, then the country. And it is possible, that in some other places
there are more Females born, then Males, which, upon this variation of
proportion, I again recommend to the examination of the curious.

3. That in the said whole 90 years the Burials of the Males and Females were
exactly equal, and that in several Decads they differed not 1/100 part, that in
one of the two Decads, wherein the difference was very notorious, there were
Buried of Males 337, and of Females but 284, viz. 53 difference, and in the
other there died contrariwise 338 Males, and 386 Females, differing 46.

4. There are also Decads, where the Birth of Males and Females differ very
much, viz. about 60.

5. That in the said 90 years there have been born more, then buried in the
said Parish, (the which both 90 years ago, and also now, consisted of about
2700 Souls) but 1059, viz. not 12 per Annum, one year with another.

6. That these 1059 have in all probability contributed to the increase of
London; since, as was said even now, it neither appears by the Burials,
Christnings, or by the built of new-housing, that the said Parish is more
populous now, then 90 years ago, by above two or 300 souls. Now, if all other
places send about of their increase, viz. about one out of 900 of their
Inhabitants Annually to London, and that there be 14 times as many people in
England, as there be in London, (for which we have given some reasons) then
London increases by such Advenae every year above 6000: the which will make the
Account of Burials to swell about 200 per Annum, and will answer the increases.
We observe it is clear, that the said Parish is increased about 300, and it is
probable, that three or four hundred more went to London, and it is known, That
about 400 went to New England, the Caribe-Islands, and New Foundland, within
these last forty years.

7. According to the Medium of the said whole 90 years, there have been five
Christnings for four Burials, although in some single Years, and Decads, there
have been three to two, although sometimes (though more rarely) the Burials
have exceeded the Births, as in the case of Epidemical Diseases.

8. Our former Observation, That healthful years are also the most fruitful,
is much confirmed by our Country Accounts; for, 70 being our Standard for
Births, and 58 for Burials, you shall find, that where fewer then 58 died,
more then 70 were born. Having given you a few instances thereof, I shall remit
you to the Tables for the general proof of this Assertion. Viz. Anno 1633. when
103 were born, there died but 29. Now, in none of the whole 90 years more were
born then 103, and but in one, fewer then 29 died, viz. 28 Anno 1658. Again
Anno 1568, when 93 were born, but 42 died. Anno 1584, when 90 were born, but 41
died. Anno 1650, when 86 were born, but 52 died. So that by how much more are
born, by so much (as it were) the fewer die. For when 103 were born, but 29
died: but when but 86 were born, then 52 died.

On the other side Anno 1638, when 156 died per Annum, which was the greatest
year of Mortality, then less then the mere Standard 70, viz. but 66 were born.
Again Anno 1644, when 137 died, but 59 were born. Anno 1597, when 117 died, but
48 were born. And Anno 1583, when 87 died, but 59 were born.

A little Irregularity may be found herein, as that Anno 1612, when 116 died
(viz. a number double to our Standard 58 yet) 87 (viz. 17 about the Standard
70) were born. And that when 89 died 075 were born: but these differences are
not so great, nor so often, as to evert our Rule, which besides the Authority
of these Accounts is probable in it self.

9. Of all the said 90 years the year 1638 was the most Mortal, I therefore
enquired whether the Plague was then in that Parish, and having received good
satisfaction that it was not (which I the rather believe, because, that the
Plague was not then considerable at London) but that it was a Malignant Fever
raging so fiercely about Harvest, that there appeared scarce hands enough to
take in the Corn: which argues, considering there were 2700 Parishioners, that
seven might be sick for one that died: whereas of the Plague more die then
recover. Lastly, these People lay longer sick then is usual in the Plague, nor
was there any mention of Sores, Swellings, blew-Tokens, etc. among them. It
follows, that the proportion between the greatest and the least Mortalities in
the Country are far greater then at London. Forasmuch as the greatest 156 is
above quintuple unto 28 the least, whereas in London (the Plague excepted, as
here it has been) the number of Burials upon other Accounts within no Decad of
years has been double, whereas in the Country it has been quintuple not only
within the whole 90 years, but also within the same Decad: for Anno 1633. there
died but 29, and Anno 1638 the abovementioned number of 156. Moreover, as in
London, in no Decad, the Burials of one year are double to those of another: so
in the Country they are seldom not more then so. As by this Table appears,
Decad greatest least number of Burials 1 66 34 2 87 39 3 117 38 4 53 30 5 116
51 6 89 50 7 156 35 8 137 46 9 80 28

Which shows, that the opener, and freer Airs are most subject both to the good
and bad Impressions, and that the Fumes, Steams, and Stenches of London do so
medicate, and impregnate the Air about it, that it becomes capable of little
more, as if the said Fumes rising out of London met with, opposed, and justled
backwards the Influences falling from above, or resisted the Incursion of the
Country-Airs.

10. In the last Paragraph we said, that the Burials in the Country were
sometimes quintuple to one another, but of the Christnings we affirm, that
within the same Decad they are seldom double, as appears by this Table, viz.

Decad greatest least number of Burials 1 70 50 2 90 45 3 71 52 4 93 60 5 87 61
6 85 63 7 103 66 8 87 62 9 86 52

Now, although the disproportions of Births be not so great as that of Burials,
yet these disproportions are far greater then at London: for let it be shown in
any of the London Bills, that within two years the Christnings have decreased.
or increased double, as they did Anno 1584, when 90 were born, and An. 1586,
wherein were but 45: or to rise from 52, as Anno 1593, to 71, as in the next
year 1594. Now, these disproportions both in Births, and Burials, confirm what
has been before Asserted, that Healthfulness, and Fruitfulness go together, as
they would not, were there not disproportions in both, although proportional.

11. By the Standard of Burials in this Parish, I thought to have computed the
number of Inhabitants in it, viz. by multiplying 58 by 4, which made the
Product 232, the number of Families. Hereupon I wondered, that a Parish
containing a large Market Town, and 12 Miles compass, should have but 232
Houses, I then multiplied 232 by 8, the Product whereof was 1856, thereby
hoping to have had the number of the Inhabitants, as I had for London; but when
upon enquiry I found there had been 2100 Communicants in that Parish in the
time of a Minister, who forced too many into that Ordinance, and that 1500 was
the ordinary number of Communicants in all times, I found also, that for as
much as there were near as many under 16 years old, as there are above, viz.
Communicants, I concluded, that there must be about 27, or 2800 Souls in that
Parish: from whence it follows, that little more then one of 50 dies in the
Country, whereas in London, it seems manifest, that about one in 32 dies, over
and above what dies of the Plague.

12. It follows therefore from hence, what I more faintly asserted in the
former Chapter, that the Country is more healthful, then the City, That is to
say, although men die more regularly, and less per Saltum in London, then in
the Country, yet, upon the whole matter, there die fewer per Rata; so as the
Fumes, Steams, and Stenches abovementioned, although they make the Air of
London more equal, yet not more Healthful.

13. When I consider, That in the Country seventy are Born for fifty eight
Buried, and that before the year 1600 the like happened in London, I
considered, whether a City, as it becomes more populous, does not, for that
very cause, become more unhealthfull, I inclined to believe, that London now is
more unhealthfull, then heretofore, partly for that it is more populous, but
chiefly, because I have heard, that 60 years ago few Sea-Coals were burnt in
London, which now are universally used. For I have heard, that Newcastle is
more unhealthfull then other places, and that many People cannot at all endure
the smoke of London, not only for its unpleasantness, but for the suffocations
which it causes.

14. Suppose, that Anno 1569 there were 2400 souls in that Parish, and that
they increased by the Births 70, exceeding the Burials 58, it will follow, that
the said 2400 cannot double under 200. Now, if London be less healthful then
the Country, as certainly it is, the Plague being reckoned in, it follows, that
London must be doubling it self by generation in much above 200: but if it has
increased from 2 to 5 in 54, as aforesaid, the same must be by reason of
transplantation out of the Country.

The Conclusion.
IT may be now asked, to what purpose tends all this laborious buzzling, and
groping? To know,

1. The number of the People? 2. How many Males, and Females? 3. How many
Married, and single? 4. How many Teeming Women? 5. How many of every Septenary,
or Decad of years in age? 6. How many Fighting Men? 7. How much London is, and
by what steps it has increased? 8. In what time the housing is replenished
after a Plague? 9. What proportion die of each general and particular
Casualties? 10. What years are Fruitful, and Mortal, and in what Spaces, and
Intervals, they follow each other? 11. In what proportion Men neglect the
Orders of the Church, and Sects have increased? 12. The disproportion of
Parishes? 13. Why the Burials in London exceed the Christnings, when the
contrary is visible in the Country?
To this I might answer in general by saying, that those, who cannot apprehend
the reason of these Enquiries, are unfit to trouble themselves to ask them.

2. I might answer by asking; Why so many have spent their times, and estates
about the Art of making Gold? which, if it were much known, would only exalt
Silver into the place, which Gold now possesses; and if it were known but to
some one Person, the same single Adeptus could not, nay, durst not enjoy it,
but must be either a Prisoner to some Prince, and Slave to some Voluptuary, or
else skulk obscurely up and down for his privacie, and concealment.

3. I might Answer; That there is much pleasure in deducing so many abstruse,
and unexpected inferences out of these poor despised Bills of Mortality; and in
building upon that ground, which has lain waste these eighty years. And there
is pleasure in doing something new, though never so little, without pestering
the World with voluminous Transcriptions.

4. But, I Answer more seriously; by complaining, That whereas the Art of
Governing, and the true Politiques, is how to preserve the Subject in Peace,
and Plenty, that men study only that part of it, which teaches how to
supplant, and overreach one another, and how, not by fair out-running, but by
tripping up each other's heels, to win the Prize.

Now, the Foundation, or Elements of this honest harmless Policy is to
understand the Land, and the hands of the Territory to be governed, according
to all their intrinsic, and accidental differences: as for example; It were
good to know the Geometrical Content, Figure, and Situation of all the Lands
of a Kingdom, especially, according to its most natural, permanent, and
conspicuous Bounds. It were good to know, how much Hay an Acre of every sort of
Meadow will bear? how many Cattle the same weight of each sort of Hay will
feed, and fatten? what quantity of Grain, and other Commodities the same Acre
will bear in one, three, or seven years communibus Annis? unto what use each
soil is most proper? All which particulars I call the intrinsic value: for
there is also another value merely accidental, or extrinsick, consisting of the
Causes, why a parcel of Land, lying near a good Market, may be worth double to
another parcel, though but of the same intrinsic goodness; which answers the
Queries, why Lands in the North of England are worth but sixteen years
purchase, and those of the West above eight and twenty. It is no less necessary
to know how many People there be of each Sex, State, Age, Religion, Trade,
Rank, or Degree, etc. by the knowledge whereof Trade, and Government may be made
more certain, and Regular; for, if men knew the People as aforesaid, they might
know the consumption they would make, so as Trade might not be hoped for where
it is impossible. As for instance, I have heard much complaint, that Trade is
not set up in some of the South-western, and Northwestern Parts of Ireland,
there being so many excellent Harbors for that purpose, whereas in several of
those Places I have also heard, that there are few other Inhabitants, but such
as live ex sponte creatis, and are unfit Subjects of Trade, as neither
employing others, nor working themselves.

Moreover, if all these things were clearly, and truly known (which I have but
guessed at) it would appear, how small a part of the People work upon necessary
Labors, and Callings, viz. how many Women, and Children do just nothing, only
learning to spend what others get? how many are mere Voluptuaries, and as it
were mere Gamesters by Trade? how many live by puzling poor people with
unintelligible Notions in Divinity, and Philosophy? how many by persuading
credulous, delicate, and Litigious Persons, that their Bodies, or Estates are
out of Tune, and in danger? how many by fighting as Soldiers? how many by
Ministeries of Vice, and Sin? how many by Trades of mere Pleasure, or
Ornaments? and how many in a way of lazy attendance, etc. upon others? And on
the other side, how few are employed in raising, and working necessary food,
and covering? and of the speculative men, how few do truly study Nature, and
Things? The more ingenious not advancing much further then to write, and speak
wittily about these matters.

I conclude, That a clear knowledge of all these particulars, and many more,
whereat I have shot but at rovers, is necessary in order to good, certain, and
easy Government, and even to balance Parties, and factions both in Church and
State. But whether the knowledge thereof be necessary to many, or fit for
others, then the Sovereign, and his chief Ministers, I leave to consideration.

Advertisements for the better understanding of the several Tables: videlicet,
Concerning the Table of Casualties consisting of thirty Columns.
THe first Column contains all the Casualties happening within the 22 single
years mentioned in this Bill.

The 14 next Columns contain two of the last Septenaries of years, which being
the latest are first set down.

The 8 next Columns represent the 8 first years, wherein the Casualties were
taken notice off.

Memorandum, That the 10 years between 1636 and 1647 are omitted as containing
nothing Extraordinary, and as not consistent with the Incapacity of a Sheet.

The 5 next Columns are the 8 years from 1629 to 1636 brought into 2
Quaternions, and the 12 of the 14 last years brought into three more; that
Comparison might be made between each 4 years taken together, as well as each
single year apart.

The next Column contains 3 years together, taken at 10 years distance from
each other; that the distant years, as well as consequent, might be compared
with the whole 20, each of the 5 Quaternions, and each of the 22 single years.

The last Column contains the total of the 15 Quaternions, or 25 years.

The Number 229250 is the total of all the Burials in the said 20 years, as
34190 is of the Burialsin the said 3 distant years. Where note that the of the
latter total is 11396 and the 1/20 of the former is 11462; differing but 66
from each other in so great a sum, videlicet scarce 1/200 part.

The Table of Burials, and Christnings, consisting of 7 Columns.
IT is to be noted, that in all the several Columns of the Burials those dying
of the Plague are left out, being reckoned all together in the sixth Column.
Whereas in the original Bills the Plague, and all other diseases are reckoned
together, with mention how many of the respective totals are of the Plague.

Secondly, From the year 1642 forwards the account of the Christnings is not to
be trusted, the neglects of the same beginning about that year: for in 1642
there are set down 10370, and about the same Number several years before, after
which time the said Christnings decreased to between 5000 and 6000 by omission
of the greater part.

Thirdly, The several Numbers are cast up into Octonaries, that Comparison may
be made of them as as well as of single years.

The Table of Males, and Females, containing 5 Columns.
First, The Numbers are cast up for 12 years; videlicet from 1629, when the
distinction between Males and Females first began, until 1640 inclusive when
the exactness in that Account ceased.

Secondly, From 1640 to 1660 the Numbers are cast up into another total, which
seems as good for comparing the Number of Males with Females, the neglect being
in both Sexes alike, and proportionable.

The Tables concerning the Country-Parish, the former of Decads beginning at
1569, and continuing until 1658, and the latter being for single years, being
for the same time, are so plain, that they require no further Explanation then
the bare reading the Chapter relating to them, etc.
