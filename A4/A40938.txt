A Message from the LORD To all that despise the Ordinance of CHRIST, which is
the power of God unto Salvation; With an Exhortarion to faithfulness, which is
the cause of true ORDER:

Showing the difference of Election and Reprobation, and the ground of True
Faith and False, from what Center they do each of them arise, with Order and
Disorder; and how a Believer and an Infidel may be known; the Believer and the
Elected Ones, as their fruits do make manifest:

With something in vindication by the Scriptures, the conditions of the
Prophets and Holy Apostles, That those whom the world scornfully call Quakers
[as many as are born again of Water and the Spirit] that they are the only
people of the Lord and do witness the same conditions that the Scriptures do
declare of.

Read the Scriptures, both of the Prophets and Holy Apostles, in whom the power
of the Lord was made manifest, and see their conditions, to whom the Lord did
manifest his power: They did both quake, tremble, and shake.

Printed in the Year, 1653.

Moses quaked, Hebrews the 12. ver. 21.

Ezekiel was commanded to eat his bread with quaking. Ezekiel. 18, 19.


Daniel did tremble, Dan. 1^.10, 11.
and there were with him that quaked.

Job his bones did shake, Job 21 ^. and 37
and his flesh did tremble, Job. 4.14.

Habakkuk his belly did shake, and his lip^ quivered, and all his flesh
trembled: See Hab. 3.16.

David roared by reason of the powerful workings of the Lord in him; Psalm. 10
4, 5.
and his bones did shake, and his flesh did tremble: See Psalm. 38.8, 9, 10. and
22.1. Psalm. 119.120.

Isaiah spoke to the people to hear the Word of the Lord, that did tremble at
it, Isa. 66.^.
with many others, etc.

And there were Mockers then as there are now: See Job 17.2. Acts 13.41. Isa.
28.22. Isa. 29.20. Psalm. 50.2, 3.

A Message from the LORD to all those that despise the Ordinance of CHRIST,
which is the power of God unto Salvation. Read Ephesians. 2.10.14. etc.
With the Vindication of those whom the World calls Quakers, witnessed by the
Scriptures, the Conditions of the Prophets, and Holy Apostles; Written from the
Spirit of the LORD.
ALL you that despise and wonder at the work of the Lord, (...). 29.20.1, 28.22.
be not you mockers, lest your bands be made strong thus says the Lord.

Behold, ye Despisers, and wonder, and perish^ I will work a work in your
days, though a man declare it unto you, you will not believe him Acts 13.41.

Take heed of despising and making a mot^ at the power of the Lord, for none
do despise and wonder but Infidells, Unbelievers that know not the power of
God in them selves; and he that bel^veth not, is alread^ damned, as says the
Scripture, Jo. 3.18. 2 These. 2.12.

All the works of the Lord are strange to the carnal and earthly minded man,
Rom 8.7, 8.
because he is an enemy to God, and the natural man knows not the things of
God, because they are spiritually discerned: and so the earthly minded man
despises the works of the Lord and wonders at them; ^. Cor. 2.
but it is because he wants faith, the power of God to rule in his heart, to
overcome that carnal, earthly, brutish, beastly nature in him, and so being
an Infidel and void of true faith, it makes him mock and scoff those that
finds the powerful operation of the spirit of God, Ephesians. 2.4
which works faith in them, knows these what they are.

True faith purifieth the heart, 1 John 5.4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 12. 1 P^t. 1.1
14, 15 and
and works out the carnal part in man: this faith is Jesus Christ, who is a
mystery to the carnal minded man: Shall the Son of man find faith on the
earth when he comes? No, he finds none until he work it: 2 Cor. 13.
all are Infidel^s that know not the work of faith wrought ^n them by the
divine powerful operation of the spirit of God, revealing and manifesting his
Son in them; know you not that Jesus Christ (...) in you except ye be
Reprobates?

What is a Reprobate? and how may he be known? Quaere.


By his fruits, ^^swer. ^^t. 7.16,
says Jesus Christ, every Tre^ is known by his fruits; either the Tree must
be good and the Fruit good, or the Tree evil^ and the Fruit evil; such is the
Tree, such is the Fruit.

First tell me. Quaere.
What is the fruits of the go^ Tree that is first spoken of by Jesus Christ in
the 7. of Matthew?

I answer, ^nswer.
The fruits of the good Tree when Christ is made manifest by his power, workin^
on the old, dead, carnal, corrupt nature; for where Christ is un-made manifest
in power the carnal part bears rule, which is death Thus says the Divine
Spirit, If Christ be (...) you, ^om. 8.9, ^^, 11.
the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of
righteousness: and the (...) of Jesus Christ being made manifest in mo^^
flesh, the Divine Spirit ruling in those earth Tabernacles, it is known by its
fruits; su^^ is the Tree, such is the F^uits, Matt. 7.1^ 19.20.

The fruits of the good Tree.
Now the fruits of the good Tree, the spituall Vine, that grows in the midst of
(...) Garden in Paradise, To. 6.4, 5. John 3.3.
the new Creation, plant in men of pure hearts, that are born againt Water and
the Spirit being the workman^^ of God, 2 Pet. 1.22, 23.
who has wrought out the old ^^ven of malice and wickedness, and made a (...)
creature; he that is in Christ is a n^w creat^^ wrought out of Self into
Spirit, and the sp^^tuall Vine in man; Col. 1.13 Col. 3.10, 12, 31, 14, 15, 16.
the new Plantation ^ringeth forth these fruits, love, peace, gentleness,
goodness, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity,
humility, ^ong-suffering, forbearing, and forgiving one another freely, even
for Christ's sake, Ephesians. 1.17.18.19, 20 Ephesians. 3.4,
who is ^he love of the Father, and works into himself baptising by his
spirit into that spiritual ^ine, to bring forth spiritual fruit to his
Fathers glory. They that are baptized into Christ, they have put on Christ, and
they that are Christ's, Gal. 3.27
they have crucifi d the flesh with the ^ffections and lusts thereof, where he
is made manifest by the powerful operation of his spirit in the hearts of his
people, 1 John 3.5, 6, 7, 8.
working out the old nature, killing, and slaying the man of sin by the sword
of the spirit, and manifesting and revealing his glory in us to his own
praise, manifesting his power in us, cutting down corruptions, and wounding
Levi^than, that crooked Serpent, that was head, Gal. 3.28 29.
^ow is bruis^d in some, and bru^sing in others, by the seed of the Woman, the
seed of Abraham after the spirit; he casts out the bondwoman and her Son,
that he may not have any part with the Son of the freewoman which is after
the spirit, Gal. 4.30 31. Romans 6.7, 8, etc.
and this power of God manifesting it self through us, does crucify the old
man with his deeds and raises up the new man, which is after God, Pet. 2.3.
created in righteousness and true holiness, and so there is pure fruit
grows o^ of the Vine, which is Christ in us; God mani^fest in our flesh, by
the powerful operation of his spirit, 1 Cor. 1.30.

Now where this power of God is not ye^ made manifest, the despising and the
wondering nature stands up in scornfulnesse, Pet 3.1^ 12.
desp^sing the work of the Lord; but it is no^^ that does so but I^fidels,
Unbelievers, tha^ know not the power of God in them, working out that
unbelieving nature in them and so they are ignorant of being made partakers of
the Divine Nature, Pet. 11. ^er. 4.
from where true faith does spring and grow; for faith in God purifieth the
heart, and works out the carnal part, and so engrafteth into the Divine
Nature, from whence righteousness does grow: ^l. 3.1^,
This is the victory that overcomes the world, even your faith, 1 John 5.4.
Put (...) therefore (as the Elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of
compassion, humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering, forbearing and
forgiving one another: These are the fruits of Election; see if you can
witness them in you, growing in purity; ^et. 1.5, 8.
and this pure faith has pure fruits growing ^n it* and flows forth from it,
such as these. 1. Virtue, 2. Knowledge, which is the wisdom of the Father in
us: 3. Temperance, lust being cut off by the sword of the spirit, and the pure
wisdom ruling in men of ^ure hearts, it c^useth them to be pitiful to ^ll
creatures, and to cherish and preserve all ^^e, that all things may be done
decently, and ^n order; Christ ruling in us, he being head of ^he Church in our
hearts, and our bodies being ^ade the true Temples for his holy spirit to
^habit in, he sits there preaching the everla^ing Gospel of his Fathers love in
us to our ^ule, 1 Cor. 6.19. 2 Cor. 6.16, 17. Rev. 21.3
destroying every vile and lustful affecti^n to earthly and carnal pleasures,
profits, and delights, which drew forth the mind after ^^ide, covetousness,
heady-high mindnesse, ^nvy and malice, backbiting and revenge, ^rath and
surmizings, grudgings and repi^ings, slavish fears and doubtings, scoffing and
scornings, peevishness and crossenesse, ^leasures and wantonness, vain
talkings, Gal. 5.19.20, 21. Col. 3.5, ^
and ^oolish j^stings, which the Devil calls pa^times and recreations, which
are fruits of the flesh, and grow out of the corrupt tree, and ^runkennesse,
and oppression, they are fruits of the flesh, and grow from the spirit of
er^our, and causes division and dissension, from ^he pure guide, the spirit of
truth; and every ^s^full desire works disorder in the heart; 2 These. 2.3, 4.
and where these are, Antichrist bears rule, ^^ts in the Temple of God, as
God, Gal. 6.7, 8
showing ^imselfe to be God: Therefore be not decei^ed, God will not be mocked,
such as ye sow, such shall ye reap, they that sow to the flesh shall of (...)
flesh reap corruption; ^om. 8.8. ^oh. 4.23, 4.
and they that are in (...) flesh cannot please God, who is a spirit, and of
^^^rer eyes then to behold iniquity: our God is consuming fire, who is the
heart searcher (...) tryer, and will cut down that vain light mi^^ that is got
up into pride, and vain glory, (...) fleshly exaltation,
heady-highmindednesse, a^^ earthly wisdom, does aspire and cast th^^ into
torment, Ieb. 12.8, 19. ^at. 24. 8. v. 22.
where is darkness and bla^^ness, and you must all tremble and quake, a^^ your
earthly hearts quiver and shake, and t^^ rocks rent the stony hearts that to
mischief are wilfully bent; when you come to kno^ God in power, ^el 2.10, 1. v.
27. ^^d 32.
and his Son that is sent to ta^^ away sin, you must give an account before hi^
at Sinai the mount, before ever you can sin the Song of Sion before the King at
new J^rusalem, where there is joy and rejoicing spirit, and in truth, which no
Fox nor wild beast can take away. Now the scoffer, an^ scorner, and lustful,
and recengefull one must come to the bar, and there give accou^^ whose deed
they have wrought, and they m^^^ be very sore punished, and cast into the fi^^^
of the indignation of the Lord, for despis^^ his power in those whom he has by
the blou^ of his Son so dearly bought and purchase to himself, who are as
dear to him as the apple of his eye: we were by nature the ^^ldren of wrath as
well as others, Ephesians. 2.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
and were ^ners as well as others; but the Lord who ^ich in mercy, for his
great love where^th he loved us, in the Son of his love, not ^r any deserts
in us, but freely for his names ^^ke. To him be praise, honor, and glory for
^^er and ever: He has slain the old man, ver. 13, 14 15, 16.
^e man of sin, that did bear rule in us, and ^ised up the new man, the Son
of his love (...) us being begotten by the Immortal Word, and borne again of
Water, and the Spirit, and redeemed us from our vain conversation, ^o many as
are of the new birth has he set to ^estifie against all unrighteousness
whatsoever: and we do loath the actions of ungodly persons, as pride, and
coverousnesse, and drunken^esse, Ephesians 5.1^
and whoredom, and theft, and lying, and swearing, and pride, and oppression,
and grinding the faces of the poor, and all manner of unrighteousness of what
sort soever, we do loath and detest it, and have no fellowship with any that
act those things, for which we are hated and despised by those that live in
unrighteousness; but we are made willing through the mercies of the Lord to
bear it; it is not we, as men and women that bear the reproaches, mocks,
scoffs, scornings, strikings, stonings and imprisonments but it is the Lord in
us, and he does en^ble our bodies to do or to suffer what his good pleasure is;
Heb. 2
for what are we, 2 John 4.17. 1 Cor. 6.11.
but through his mercies are made to be what he is in us, and thro^ us, and we
are no more our own, we (I me^ that are borne again, washed, cleansed,
j^^fied, and purchased us to himself, Joh. 1.7.
that may be glorified by us, for the blood of Je^^ Christ his Son cleanses
us from all si^^ and so purifieth soul and body, that we (...) not serve our
selves, but the Lord: we ha^^ loath, and utterly detest, and abhor all m^^ner
of unrighteousness whatsoever, and (...) made to testify against it by the
spirit of tru^ and righteousness that rul^th in us, even Jesus Christ, who is
the Lord our righteo^^nesse, and he is the end of the law for right^^ousnesse
to all that believe.

But, Cor. 6.4, 15, 16.
unbelievers know him not, nor tho^ that act in unrighteousness, for
unrighteo^^snesse is the fruit of darkness and unbelief^ and pride is a fruit
of darkness, and is the ca^^^ of disorder; rov. 6.5, 17, etc.
let all things be done decently and in order; put off pride, and put on
h^^mility; let all things be done decently and i^ order to the divine spirit;
for God is a Go^ of order, and of purer eyes then to behold iniquity. Now
covetousness is unpure, fruit of darkness, ^h. 5.3.
a transgression of the righteous law of God, and is in disorder to the spirit
of truth, and in order to the spirit of error, thou proud, and covetous man
an^ ^^man, thou art disorderly, and yet thou ^^est out for order, but it is
fleshly and car^^ that thou would have; thou would (...) Barabbas at
liberty that thy lusts may be ^^^^fied, and Christ crucified, that would se^^^^
and crucify thy lusts and vile affections, (...) so bring thee to be ordered
by the good ^^^^it, to walk conformable like unto the Son (...) God, in
righteousness and true holiness; ^^^de and covetousness is beastly, Isa.
28.1, 2, 3.
and the ^^^stly will, and the carnal corrupt heart does ^^ight in them, and
is unwilling to have or^^^: put off the old man with his deeds, Col. 3.8, 9,
10.
^^d put on the new man which after God is ^^^ated in righteousness and true
holiness, (...) else never profess love neither to God not ^^rist; and walk
orderly, and do not disho^^ur him, for he is jealous of his honor; and ^^w
can ye believe that seek honor one of a^^ther, Joh. 5.44.
and seek not the honor that is of God? Believers do glorify God in
bring^^g forth fruits of righteousness; Joh. 15.8.
herein is my ^ather glorified that ye bring forth much fruit: Jam. 2.17.20.26.
^ew me thy faith by thy works; faith with^^t works is dead; where true faith
is, it ^orketh out that disorderly part in man that ^es in unrighteousness; he
or she, that lives (...) pride, covetousness, lying, swearing, or
^runkennesse, heady high mindedness, scoffing, ^^r scorning, pleasures, or
wantonness, envy, hatred, oppression, and grinding the faces (...) the poor,
vain talking, or foolish jesting, (...) fraud, deceit, etc. These or any of
these (...) nothing of true faith which works out (...) disorderly part, but
are Infidells, and (...) faith is formal, standing in the wisdom (...) other
men's words, and will not stand the (...) trial; for faith in God purifieth the
he^^^ and overcomes the carnal part that delig^^ in unrighteousness; but
formal faith (...) stands in other men's words, brings forth th^^ fruits as are
above mentioned, and is in (...) order to the spirit of truth: these are f^^^
of the Reprobate that makes lies his ref^^^ 1 Cor. 2.5. Ephesians. 4 5. 2 Pet. 1.1.
true faith stands out of all m^^ words, is entered upon the rock: Christ
Je^^^ who is both the Author and Finisher of (...) this true faith is

and overcome^ (...) doubtings, 1, 2, 3, etc. 1 Pet. 4.12.
and questionings, and temptati^^^ and is tried as Gold in the fire, for ev^^^

other men's wo^^^ will burn in the indignation of the Lords i^^^ faith in God
overcomes all lusts, and temp^^tions, 1 Pet. 1.7.
and is tried; 1 Pet. 1.7.
the trial of faith is m^^ more precious then gold that perishes, (...) it is
fruitful: there is a growth abiding (...) faith, virtue to virtue, knowledge
to kno^^ledge, temperance to temperance, pati^^^ to patience, Pet. 2.7.
godliness to godliness, broth^ (...) (...) kindness to brotherly kindness,
charity: ^^ese are the fruits of the true faith, and this ^^ith makes fruitful
in the knowledge of the lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. 2.1
and these are (...) order to the divine spirit, the spirit of truth and
righteousness, which causes to grow from faith to faith, from grace to grace,
1 Pet. 2.5*
from glory to glory; and this leads up to God the Father, to Mount Sion, from
Sinai, where (...) blackness, and darkness, and smoke in the Temple within,
to Sion, Heb. 12* 22, 23, 2^
the City of the living God, to an innumerable company of Angels, to the
spirits of just men made perfect, to the Church of the first borne written in
heaven, where there is true peace, joy unspeakable, which no tongue can
express; there is all soule-satisfying comfort (as it is said) Eye has not
seen, Ear has not heard, 1 Cor. 2 10, 11, ^
neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive those things that God
has laid up for them that love him: but God has revealed them unto us by his
spirit. I bear testimony to the eternal truth, through death, for without
death there is no life; and herein this Church, the new Jerusalem, Rev. 2^
where the Tabernacle of God is with men of pure hearts; those that are borne
again, 1 Cor. 16, 17.
all things are ordered by the golden Scepter of Jesus Christ, that sits upon
his pure throne of grace, shining forth in glory: and in this new Plantation,
the heavenly Jerusalem, ^ev. 21.1, 2 ^, to v. 8.
where (...) new heaven and the new earth is, there is (...) Paradise of God,
where the spices do gre^^^ and the tree of life in the midst of the G^^den,
that bears twelve manner of fruit (...) and there is a river of water of life
which w^^tereth the plants, ^ev. 22.2. ^ev. 22.1.

sorrow and sighing is not ther^ it is without in Egypt, and at th^^ mount
Sinai, and in the wilderness, there a^^ many sore and sad temptations, ^eb.
3.7, ^, 9, 10, 11, ^2. ^eb 8.2, 3
and fiery tr^alls; there the Lord tries and proves to (...) what is in the
heart, and there is either (...) standing or falling, and returning into Egy^^
again, ^eb. 6.4, ^ 6.
and not obtaining the promises, (...) an entering into the promised Land, by
reason of the carnal earthly part, and so the ^^canst not enter; if thou once
look ba^^^ into the wilderness, and begin to murm^^ and repine, look to it
there, and take he^^^ of the love of the world, and the enjoymen^^ and
pleasures of the world; the Devil w^^^ sift and try forth thy faith and
patience eve^^ way, and he will show thee all the glory, an^ ^^auty, and
excellency of the world to allure ^^d persuade thy heart to follow him in the
(...) joyments of the world, and he will suffer ^^ee to profess what thou will, and talk of ^^^gh truths, but not to live in them; and so ^^ou thinking
to have both the love of God (...) the love of the World, Mat. 9.19 20, 21, 22
23, 24.
and the glory of (...) ^od and the glory of the World, and there (...)
catches thee with his bait, and keeps ^^ee feeding upon fancies, Heb. 11.24,
25, 26
and thou losest the ^^bstance, and art among the Gentiles in the ^^^ward
Court, trodden under foot, and at ^^^st cast into hell, there to be tormented
for ^^er: Take heed to your selves all you that (...) ^e profess God in words,
but in works ^^^ny him: it is not he that says, Lord, Lord, Mat. 7.21*
^^at shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; ^^t he that does the will of my
Father (says Je^^s Christ.) Now be not Sayers but Doers, ^^^nd walk in order
to the spirit of God, and (...) will lead you and guide you into all (...)
^^uth.

Suffer a word of Exhortation and Admo^^tion: We have no envy to any man's
person ^ut to his evil actions, that he may not live (...) them lest he be
destroyed with a sore de^ruction, and knowing the terror of the lord: out of
love do I persuade you all to ^^ke heed of dissembling with the Lord (it is
(...) dangerous thing;) you say you love God with all your hearts, ^ets 5.1, 3,
5, 6. the 12.
you say well, but do so Ananias and Saphira said that they brough all their
substance to lay down at the Apostles feet, but did not; and for their
dissemble the judgment of God came upon them a^^ struck them dead to the
ground; and t^^ Lord is the same God of power now that (...) was then: take
heed of dissimulation.

You say you love God with all your heart you that make a profession of him,
but (...) knows your hearts: Ieb. 4.13.
now look to it as y^^ will answer it before the Lord, the righteo^ Judge of
heaven and earth, when you stand nakedness of heart before the tribunal s^ of
judgment, that you do profess no mo^^ then you do possess and practice,
lest t^^ judgment of God come upon you at u^^ wares as it did upon them, and
strike y^^ dead to the ground, and your name and (...) mory come to rot and
perish; it is a dan^^rous thing to dissemble with the Lord; loo^ to it, and let
your love be made manifest your actions, in walking in order to (...) commands
of the spirit of truth, Romans 8.13 14.
Jesus Chr^^^ the divine power of righteousness.

Now, to love God is to keep his comm^^ dements; Joh. 14.15 1 John 2.4.
for (says Jesus Christ) If ye (...) me keep my commandments: and he that s^^
he loves God and keeps not his commandem^^^^ is a liar, and the truth is not
in him. See h^^ you do obey him in keeping his commandments, and do not
dissemble, John 14.23, 24.

I command you to love one another (says Jesus Christ;) how do thou obey
this when thou live in envy with thy br^ther? Joh. 15.13, 14. 1 John 3.16.
and he that envieth is a muderer, as says the Scripture; take heed of
disorderly walking, God does forbid it, and the judgment of God hangs over thy
head that does so. Now thou that live in envy, thou art a disorderly fellow,
and art guided by the spirit of error; 1 John 4.6, 7, 8.
yet thou can talk much of God and of Christ, but walks contrary; it is not
the Sayer but the Doer that shall be justified before the Lord, the righteous
Judge; take heed of dissimulation and disorderly walking, for God is a God of
order.

Says Jesus Christ, Mat. 5.1 20.44.45 46, 47, 4
Do unto all men as ye would be done by, love your enemies, bless them that
curse you, pray for them that despightfully use you, that ye may be the
children of your Father which is in Heaven.

1. But how do you walk in obedience to these commands when you mock, and
scoff, and scorn and deride others? would you have them to do so by you?
take heed of dissimulation lest the judgments of God come upon you at
unawares, and so destroy you with a sore destruction: This is disorder to the
spirit of truth.

(...) it, (...) 5.34.37.
and tell you when you do any evil the you should not do: so if thou do but
heat ken to it and let it lead and guide your mind^ it will bring you to few
words, sollidnesse and temperatenesse in all things, and to pr^^on
faithfulness, to be what you speak in a^^ things; for that is orderly and
according t^ the spirit of truth.

These with many more thou shall find commanded in thy spirit, written in the
ne^^ law of righteousness in thy heart; (...) 31.33,
if thou d^^ but turn within to read there it will brin^ thee to the law and
to the testimony, b. 8.10,
alway^ to see that thy thoughts, words, and action^ be according to
righteousness; so shall the have peace in walking in obedience to the
righteousness of the law in thy heart, and will not let thee do any evil if
thou do b^ mind its leadings in thee; (...). 5.7. ^al. 119.
it will bring tha^ to faithfulness and orderly walking toward God and Man in
all things; let all things b^ done orderly by the spirit of truth, that Go^ may
be glorified by you all that do profe^^ love unto his name; and take heed of
diss^^ mulation and disorderly walking, for (...) God is a severe Judge, and
he will not suff^^ sin to go unpunished, for he is a God (...) order, and of
purer eyes then to behold i^^quity: be not Sayers but Doers, profess (...)
more then you do possess, and take heed (...) speaking evil of that which
you know not; and if any thing seem strange to your carnal minds, be not
hasty in speaking evil of it, but wait upon the Lord till it be made manifest
to you, for all the works of God are strange to the carnal heart; prove all
things, Ephesians. 5.1 11.
hold fast that which is good; but take heed of dissimulation and disorderly
walking; stand i^ ^we and sin not, for God is a God of truth, is God of
power, and of purer eyes then to behold iniquity.

Thus says the Lord, Will ye not fear me, Jer. 5.22
Will ^e not tremble at my presence, Jer. 5.22.

Would you not say it was madness, Quest
delusions, or witchery, and disorderly, to see men and women to tremble now in
these days?

What think you of it? but thoughts are vain that arise out of the earthly
heart: Answ
But would it not be a wonder to you to see men and women to tremble, 1 Cor. 3
19, 20.
and their flesh to shake, and their bones to quake, and some to fall down to
the ground, and others to chatter like a Crane or a Swallow, as Daniel and the
men that were with him did, Dan. 10.10, 11. Isa. 28.1 15. Hab 3.1 Psalm. 38
and as Hezekiah did; and would you not wonder to see some their bellyes to
shake, and their lips to quiver, and to lie roaring by reason of the powerful
workings of God in them, as Habakkuk and David did, etc. What think you? could
you own the same power now that was then in those days and not despise it*

You may say it was so then, Obj.
but that is pa^^ and now there are no such things to be looked f^^ nor no such
power as was then.

I answer, Answ.
God is the same God of pow^^ now that he was then, and he does make (...)
manifest in revealing his Son in us.

But you may say, Obj.
Revelations are ceased, (...) not to be looked for in our days.

You may as well say, Answ.
God is ceased to b^^ God, and Christ to be Christ as to say so who art thou
that limits the holy One of Isra^^ by thy carnal mind? 59.1.
55.9.
Gods power is not to b^^ limited which way he will manifest himself but the
ways and works of God are contrary to man's carnal wisdom, as says th^^
Lord, (...). 56.1.
my ways are not your ways, for as fr^^ as the heaven is above the earth, so
far are (...) ways above your ways; and Christ says (...) that he is the
same yesterday, to day, and fr^^ ever: ^^b. 13.8.
and he says, that no man knows the Father but the Son, neither knows any man
the So^^^ but the Father, and he to whom he is revealed^ Mat. 11.27.

Then there is no knowledge of God but by revelation of the Son; he that has
the Son^^ has life, ^oh. 9.
and he that has the Son has the Father also. Take heed of limitting the
holy one of Israel, he is pouring forth his spirit upon Sons and Daughters
according to his promises, ^^^ts 2.18,
as in Joel 2.28.

Let God be God powerful, omnipotent, ^^d incomprehensible; let Christ be the
power ^f God unto salvation, immortal and invisi^^^e, and not be seen with
carnal, mortal, ^^^sible eyss* and let him be a mystery to ^^e wise ones of
the world that live in the ^istory, and know not that which has been
^^recold; let the carnal mind be as it is, ^n enemy to Jesus Christ, and
death and de^truction is the portion of carnal minds, and ^he carnal mind
is death, and keeps the pure ^^^ede in bondage; but now the vialls of ^^rath
are to be poured forth upon the man ^f sin, the enemy of righteousness; Rev.
16. Rev. 17.^
the Lord is making his power known in the ^earts of his people, let despisers
and won^erers perish* God is the same that he was, and it is the same power now
that is made manifest that was in the Saints and servants of the Lord in former
ages, as is made manifest by the Prophets and Apostles.

Therefore behold ye despisers and wonderers, and perish; Act. 13.4
I will work a work in your days, though men declare it to you, you will not
believe them; the Lord shall arise as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in
the valley of Gibeon that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to
pass his act, his strange ^act. Now be ye not mockers lest your bands be made
strong, Isa. 28.21, 22.

See the conditions of the servants of Lord in former ages, to whom the power
the Lord was made manifest: read the S^^ptures and see whether you can own the
s^^^ power that they did that spoke them for yea or no; I bear testimony to
them thro^^ death; Joh. 3.3, 14.
thus says the Lord, to this man w^^ look, that is poor, and of a contrite
spirit, (...) trembles at my Word, Isa. 66.2. there is Go^^ delight in broken
spirits, those that are bro^^ by his Word in their hearts, which is pow^^full,
Ieb. 4.12, ^3.
his Word is his power, and the Word (...) the Lord is quick and powerful, and
sharper th^^ any two edged sword, to cut down all lusts a^^ corruptions; and
this Word is within, R^^^ 10.8. Now see, could your lustful mind^^ own this?
to see a man tremble, would y^^ not despise the work of the Lord in him (...)
Take heed what you do despisers and wo^^derers, perish* Acts 13.41. Isaac,
he tremble^ exceedingly, Genesis 27.33. what think you b^ that? was it the power
of God or the pow^^ of the Devil that made him to tremble? H^^ Isaac been here
in those days, and trembled would you not have said it was madness;
delusions, and witchery? what think you? i^ not God the same God of power now
tha^ he was then? take heed of despising the work^ of the Lord, despisers and
wonderers perish.

Moses, he did exceedingly fear an^ ^^ake, Heb. 12.21. what think you by
that? ^^t all the thoughts of the wise are vain that ^se out of the first
wisdom, 1 Cor. 1.25 1 Cor. 1.19, 20, 21. and 27, 28, 29.
the wisdom of ^^e flesh; the wisdom of the world is foo^^nesse with God, let
it be so, let God be ^^se, and every man a fool; for every man ^ust be a fool
that he may be made wise: ^^t had Moses been here now and quaked, ^ould not
your wisdom despise him for it, that think you? is not God the same now that
he was then? despise not the work of God: take heed of despising the work of
^he Lord, for despisers and wonderers perish, and be ye not mockers lest your
bands be made ^trong. Acts 13.41. Isa. 28.22.

Moses, he trembled at the work of the Lord, Acts 7.32. what power was that
which made him to tremble? was that the power of God or the power of the
Devil, what think you? would you own the same power now if you should see
men tremble? would you not mock them? take heed of despising the work of the
Lord; and be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong; our God is a God of
power.

When the children of Israel came out of the Camp to meet with the Lord, the
whole mount quaked greatly, Exodus 19.16, 17, 18. what power was that think you?
was that the power of God or the power of the Devil? take heed of despising
the work o^ Lord; none do but infidells and unbelie those that never yet knew
the power of in themselves, working out sin and evil, destroying the works
of the Devil that despise it in others; but despisers and ^^^derers perish,
take heed what you do.

Job* Job 14.14. Job 21.5, 6 Job 16.14, 15. Job 17.1, ^, etc.
there was such fear and tremb^^ came upon him, that made all his bone shake
and his flesh to tremble, and his h^^ also trembled, and was removed out of
place, Job 31.1. what think you by this? (...) this the power of God or the
power of Devil that made Job's bones to shake and flesh to tremble, and
removed his heart out its place? and had Job been in this gene^^tion, and done
so, would you not have s^ that he had been mad? etc. but you (...) take mad
men's words to talk of, and kno^^ nothing of their condition, and where (...)
power of the Lord is made manifest in (...) that they witness Isaac's,
Moses's, or Jo^ condition; you cry out of delusion, madne^^ or* witchery: and
so it is now as it was the there are mockers now to mock and sc^^ those that
witness their condition, as the did, see Job 17.2. says he, are there not
makers? Now the same persecutes the power (...) truth: take heed what you do,
God is a Go^ of power now as he was then, I witness (...) the conditions
through death: see what ^^ptures you can witness fulfilled in you, experience
spoken in from the life of the ^^ptures, and live not in words without life,
they will fail you.

David lay roaring all the day long, Psalm. 28. to v. 12. Psalm. 22.1. Psalm. 6.2,
3. Psalm. 32.3. Psalm. 119.120.114.7.99.1.97.4, 5.55.4, 5.
all his ^^es did shake, and his flesh trembled, he ^^d there was no
soundness in his flesh nei^^er was there rest in his bones; he was feeble ^^d
sore broken, and roared by reason of the ^^squietnesse of his heart, Psalm. 38.
his heart ^^nted, and his strength failed him, and his sight ^ew dim, and all
his bones did shake and his flesh ^emble; what think you of this? was this ^^e
power of God or of the Devil?

See further, the power of the Lord will ^^ake all earthly carnal hearts, and
bring ^owne all that are proud and lofty, Isa. 2.11, ^2. and 17 18, 19, 20, 21.
hear the Word of the Lord, all ye that tremble at his Word, Isa. 66.5. See
Isa. 54. The power of the Lord makes the nations to tremble, Isa. 54.1.

Hezekiah chattered like a Crane, or a Swallow, Isa. 28.14, 15. that was his
condition.

Jeremiah, his heart within him was broken, Jer. 23.9 Jer. 4.24
and all his bones did shake, and his flesh did tremble because of the Lord,
and because of his holiness: will ye not fear me, says the Lord? will ye not
tremble at my presence? for thus says the Lord, Jer. 5.22.10.10. Jer.
33.9.51.29.8.18.
we have heard a v^^ trembling, of fear, and not of peace: A^^ now, and see
whether a man travail with c^^^ wherefore do I see every man with his ha^^ his
loins, as a woman in travail, and all fac^^ turned into palenesse, Jer. 30.5,
6. What th^^ you by this? is not this a strange work, (...) a man should
travail with child? I tell (...) all the works of the Lord are strange to

The word of the Lord came unto Ez^^ saying, Ezekiel. 12.18, 19.
Eat thy bread with quaking, and dr^^^ thy water with cheerfulness, and with

power was (...) think you?

Daniel he trembled, and fell down to ground, and the men that were with him
qua^^ Dan. 10.7.8.11. was that the power of G^^ or the power of the Devil,
think you, the struck Daniel down to the ground, and m^^ the men to quake, and
to run away for f^^ to hide themselves? take heed of despis^ the works of the
Lord, he is the s^^ God of power that he was then.

Thus says the Lord, Joel 2.1, 2.
let all the Inhabitants the earth tremble; and Joel says, the earth all quake
before the Lord, ver. 10, 11. see Na^^ 1.5, 6.

Habakkuk his belly shoke, and his lips did ^iver, and his flesh trembled, Hab.

Paul trembled at the voice of the Lord, and ^ell down to the ground, Acts 9

The Corinthians received Paul with fear and ^^embling, 2 Cor. 7.15.

Paul wrote to the Philippians, Phil. 2.12.13.
and exhor^ed them to work out their salvation with ^eare and trembling; but,
says he, it is God that works in you by his power; and, says ^^e in another
place, the power of God wor^eth in me mightily; the power of the Lord will make
all flesh to tremble: take heed of despising the power of God, or resisting,
for ^n so doing you despise and resist the Ordinance of God, and despisers and
wonderers ^^perish.

Take heed of resisting and despising the power of God, for he that despises
the power despises the Ordinance of Christ, who is the power of God unto
salvation: the Lord is now making his power known in his Sons and Daughters;
therefore (...) every soul be subject to the higher pow^^ God is a God of
power, and he is the righ^^ous Magistrate, who bears not the sword^^ vain,

Say ye to the righteom, it shall be well w^^^ them, for they shall eat the
fruit of their doin^* Isa. 3.10.

Rejoice ye Saints and righteous Ones, t^^ Lord is Keeper and Rewarder; for,

FINIS.
A MITE given forth of the TREASURY.
Christian Friends,
THE end of all my writing is, to t^^^ off false aspersions that are cast upon
the c^uch by those that speak evil of th^^ they know not; and to exhort them
to b^^ mindefu l of the tru^ guide, that would gui^^ them and lead them out of
darkness; (...) those that know the name of the Lord th^^ cannot but speak
well of him; but becau^^ they know him not, ruling by his holy spi^^^ rul ng in
themselves, therefore do they (...) know them that are borne again, in whom
(...) has manifested his love and power, as (...) I John 3.1. Behold what
manner of love the F^ther has bestowed on us that we should be c^^^ the Sons
of God: now we are the Sons (...) God, therefore the world knows us not,
^^cause it knew not him; and that is the reas^^ why they speak evil of the
truth; beca^^^ they know it not in themselves, therefore th^^ know it not in
others, where it is made m^nifest; Jo. 4.5, 6
because they are of the world, the^^fore speak they of the world, and the
world hea^eth them: we are of God, he that knows God ^eares us, he that is
not of God hears us not; ^ereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit ^f
error: And this is the record that God has ^iven to us eternal life; and
this life is in his ^onne. 1 John 5.11. Now to know the Son, (...) to know
the power of God, ruling by the ^ower of his div^ne spirit, operating within,
^orking out all sin and evil, for he being made manifest, is made manifest
to destroy ^he works of the Devil. Now he that has ^he Son has life, and
he that has not the ^onne has not life: now this life is within, therefore
the end of all writing is to lay open that which is the cause of dissension,
from the ^rue guide, the spirit of truth. The mystery of ^niquity has borne
rule long in man; Anti^hrist that sits in the temple of God, as God, ^hewing
himself to be God, and sits decked above the Cross; (Christ) as a
well-favoured Harlot, having got Saints words in form and method to speak of,
but not made conformable to them in life and conversation, having only the
form, but denies the power of godliness; even Satan transformed into an Angel
of light; Leviathan, the old crooked Serpent, the Devil who is the enemy of
all ^ighteousnesse, be gets up into the highest ^orme, and has such fair
colors that he cannot be discerned but by the power, an^ where the power of
truth is he rages at i^ both within and without, and casts fort^ floods of
wickedness after it; but the wit^ kednesse of the wicked shall slay them, the
Lamb shall overcome and get the victory Now the Lion of the tribe of Judah is
takin^ off the seals, and opening the book that ha^^ been sealed, and does
discover Antichrist, the man of sin, with all his deceivablenesse, an^ his
craftiness, how he lies in wait to decei^^ the simple. Now where the simple
desire is b^^ got toward the truth, mind that which do^^ beget the desire,
and wait there upon the Lord, who first b^gets the will, and then giv^ power to
act and perform that which is goo^ upon the obedience to him; for all the
promises of God run upon the obedience Therefore, dear heart, mind the motions
(...) thee that do arise to persuade thee to for sake that which is evil, and
to embrace the which is good, and it will bring thee into true discerning
betwixt good and evil, the thou may choose the good and refuse the ev^^ The
Lord is now setting up the ministery^ his Son in the spirits of his people; and
if the be but still and sit in silence out of all m^^ words and writings, and
outward teaching that arise from the first nature, which is alt^gether corrupt
and uncleans; and if the her^ be unclean, which is the ground, then the words
and writings must needs be the same: therefore cease wholly from all that is
outward and visible, and come to know that which is inward and invisible; for
as the lightning comes out of the East, and shines into the West, so shall
the coming of the Son of man be: therefore wait wholly within, to know thy
teacher there; do but return out of all thy own wisdom, which is
foolishness with God, and return out of all thy own righteousness, which is
unrighteousness, and so shall thou know the wisdom and righteousness of God,
which is pure, spiritual, and divine, which does far excel and go beyond
all thine, which wisdom is hid from all Vulterous eyes, and venomous beasts,
and is not to be purchased with Gold, nor Rubies, nor Pearls, nor the
preciousest things that are, Job 28. it is not to be found out by wit nor art,
study nor industry; mind but to return within out of all thy own words,
thoughts, or musings, to have thy mind kept pure, and free from all thoughts,
and objects without, and thou will be fit to receive the teachings of the
Father, which will teach thee true knowledge indeed; and thou will find the
book of life to be opened to thy soul in waiting within, and hear glad
tidings brought to thy soul, and the everlasting Gospel will be preached to
thee, and the mystery of godliness unfolde to thee, which has been hid from
ages an^ generations, which now the Lord is revealin^ by his spirit to those
that wait upon him: stan^ wholly out of all men's words, and sink dow^ into the
ground, the eternal word of li^^ within, Romans 10.8. and know it preached i^
thy heart, and it will melt thee, and brea^^ thee to pieces with the flowings
forth of lo^^ that runs forth from this pure Vine, the Lord Jesus Christ
within; open when he knock^^ and if thou do but lay thy finger on the latch
thou shall feel the smell of myrrhe^ Oh wait on the Lord for teaching, and
tho^^ shall hear words unexpressable, which wi^^ make thee to rejoice in the
Lord with exceedi^^ joy; for the Kingdom of Heaven consiste^ in
righteousness, peace, and joy in the Ho^^ Ghost, where there is love, and
peace, a^^ joy, and freedom in the Son of righteousnes^ who is King of Kings,
and Lord of Lord To him be praise, honor, and glory for eve^ more. All his
works praise him, Oh bless (...) Lord, praise him and magnify him for ever.

Written in the first year of Jubilee, by o^ that had been in Egypt under sore
taxations (...) Pharaoh, and was redeemed by the pow^^ of the Lord, that sent
his Angel, the Messe^ger of the covenant of grace, who leads (...) Israelites,
the promised seed, from place^ place, which leads up to him, who (...)
Keeper and their King. This Angel of the Lord does lead the promised seed
through the Sea of many great and deep troubles, and through the Wilderness,
where there are fiery trials, there to try all, to see whether they will stand
or fall; there are such troubles there as seldom has been known and there
the Lord he gets himself renown, and so leads through the warsare
spiritually, where many a strong hold is thrown down by the Lords own
powerful hand, and a^l his enemies are brought unto a stand, and the Lord
leads his seed into the promised Land, that he may have the praise, to whom
it does belong: And thus the seed comes to its rest at Sion, the beauty of
holiness, where there is a largeness of the love of God, who will rule all
nations with his Iron rod; the Lord is King, ruling there in power, each day,
and eke each hour: To him alone be all praise, honor, and glory, both now and
evermore. Amen.

Farewell. Thine in the Vine, Rich: Farneworth.

Sin kept out of the KINGDOM.
ALL Professors and People, consider whe^^ you are, and from whence you are
fal^^ you that plead for sin, and say none can b^ set free from sin while
they are in the world, you plead for an hold for Saran in yo^ whilst you are
here, and where will you have him cast out? or what fellowship can you have
with God, whilst the Serpent is head^ you? you are separated from God, and
know^ him not; for what communion has light with darkness? God is light, and
he that dwells i^ God dwells in light; ^h. 1.5.
and in him is no darkness at all: but whilst you live in sin you live in
darkness, and the God of this world has blinded your eyes that you cannot see
it; or.4.4.
you are led captive at his will to serve him, and you are willing to be so,
and you do not believe that you shall ever be otherwise; you are servants to
sin, and you take pleasure in it, you are in the flesh and sin, and have made^
covenant with hell and death, you are resolved to serve and please the flesh
whilst you ^e, and you will repent at your death, Psalm. ^ Heb.
you ^e forgot that your times are in the hand of ^e Lord, and that this is the
day of grace and pentance, which you turn into lascivionsness, ^d wantonness,
you make it plainly appear ^n love your luftfull pleasures and filthiness
^ore then God; you that love the world, and ^e things of the world, 1 John 15,
16.
the love of the Fa^^er is not in you; for whom ye love, him ^ill you follow:
Christ says, If ye love (...), follow me, keep my Commandments: Joh. 14.6.
and those who follow him he leads them out ^f all the ways of sin, into
the ways of ^urity and holiness, and so he is the way to ^e Father, for
without holiness none can ever ^e God, for he is of purer eyes then to behold
^old iniquity; neither can any unclean thing ^ome in his sight; but whilst
you follow the of disobedience, bringing forth fruits of ^n and
unrighteousness, having your conversa^ion in the earth and earthly things,
following ^our corrupt wills and pleasures, and yet you will profess you love
God, and own him in words, and the Devil in practice: O horrible ^ypocrite I
shall not the righteous God find you out, and reward you according to your
works? you cannot deceive him, you deceive your selves, who think to be
heirs of two Kingdoms; you will have the pleasures of sin here, and you say
you hope to be h^ of the Kingdom of Heaven too; but hope of the hypocrite
shall perish; remem^ thy Father Dives, in whose steps thou walk^ and the same
way leads to the same end, (...) Lord says that the wicked shall be turned to
Hell, 9.17.
and all they that forget God, but deceit in it says that thou must live in
f^^ whilst thou art here, and have thy though^ in the world, and yet thou
shall enter into (...) Kingdom of Heaven too. Now who must liar, whether God,
or thou? O vain m^^ was it not Sin that separated God and M^^ at the first?
and think thou to be reconcil^ again so long as sin stands in thee? Man w^^
not created in sin, but pure and holy in th^^ Image of God, and whilst he
stood here (...) had communion with God, ^en. 127.
and had that pu^^ wisdom of God, by which he was able to s^^ into the wonders
of God, ^en. 2.19, ^,
and to give nam^ unto all creatures; ^en. 3.24.
but so soon as he had committed sin he was stripped of all this, and became
naked, and was thrust out of Paradis^ and was cursed from the Lord, yea the
grou^^ was cursed for his sake, and all this because of sin, which thou
think so light of: so od^^ous is sin in the pure eyes of the holy God and
did thou but know thy condition, (...) thou lie in sin, in thy first
birth, a child (...) wrath, and one to whom all the curses in the ^ok of God
are due; thou would tremble at (...) and not plead for it, wherein thou
plainly ^ewest thy self to be a servant of the Devil, ^^d pleads for his Image
and K^ngdome; and ^ere it not that he had blinded thy eyes, thou ^ightst see
where thou art, when thou thus busest the goodness of God, that having left he
sins and faylings of others upon record, 1 Cor. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
^s warning to all that come after not to do he like; and these thou make
u^e of to en^ourage thee in thy sin and filthiness and because God is
merciful to pardon Sinners what time soever they repent, therefore thou ^^rt
encouraged to live in sin the longer unrepented or. Now all that have eyes in
their h^ads may plainly see whose children they are; for the Apostle says,
Romans 2.
Know ye not that the long suffering and forbearing of God leads to
repentance? It does so, to the children ^f God, but that Scripture is fulfilled
in thee which says, because Judgment is not speedly executed on the wicked,
therefore his heart is set in him to work wickednsse: and thus thou make the
mercy of God a cloak for thy u^^g^^^ous actions, and yet thou will talk of a
Rede^mer, and of says in Christ: But O friend, where is thy redemption
witnessed whilst thou art yet in thy sins? what art thou redemmed from? Joh.
8.35, 36.
or what art thou redeemed to? those who are redeemed are set free from the
servitude of sin, but thou servest sin as long as thou obey the motions of it;
then where is freedom? can thou witness Christ dyed thee, and thy sin is
still alive? how wilt (...) witness his death in thee, or thy self d^^ with
him? the Saints who were dead (...) Christ were dead to sin; and says Paul,
(...) can you who are dead to sin, ^om. 6.2. ^om. 6.^7.
live any longer the in? and says, those that are dead with Ch^^^ are free
from sin, and are become servant^ righteousness: And, says he, Now being
m^^ free from sin, ^om. 6.22.
and become servants of God ye h^^ your fruit unto holiness, and the end
eternal l^^ but whilst thou live in sin thy fruit is unho^^ and the end
thereof is death, and then whe^^ is thy redemption? they who are redeem^^ by
Christ are redeemed from earth and earth^^ things up to God again, from whence
they h^^ fallen, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, ^ev. 5.9.10
and Nation; and are made unto God King and Priests to reign above sin and the
ear^^ and are made conformable unto his Image agai^^ which was lost by sin:
^om. 8.29
but what conformity (...) there in thee whilst thou art in sin? thou art n^^
like him, but like the Devil, for every sin (...) the Image of the Devil,
who sinned from th^^ beginning, and whilst thou cornmittest sin^^ thou hold
forth the Image of the Devil i^^ thee, who is thy Father; and Christ told the
Seribes and Pharisees, who professed themselves to be the children of God, but
lived in (...), that they were of their Father the Devil, Joh. ^.
(...) his works they would do, for every sin (...) the work of the Devil;
and, says John, (...) that commits sin is of the Devil; and says, Joh. ^
^^t for this purpose was the Son of God mani^^sted to destroy the works of
the Devil: who ^^er can witness Christ manifest in them, can ^^itnesse sin
destroyed; but if thou say thou ^^nst witness Christ manifest in thee, and
yet ^^mmit sin, thou art a liar; for the Scripture ^ith, that whosoever abides
in him, sins not: 1 John 3.6.
^hosoever sins has not seen him, neither ^nowne him; and he that says, I
know him, and ^eepeth not his Commandments is a liar, and, ^he truth is not in
him: Joh. 2.^
And, says the Holy Ghost, whosoever is borne of God sins not; ^ut he that
is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not; and
says ^gaine, whosoever is borne of God does not commit sin, 1 John 5.1 1
John 3.9, 10.
for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin because he is borne of God;
and says plainly, In this are the children of God manifest, and the children
of the Devil: Whosoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that
loves not his brother. God in all ages has known his by their obedience, Genesis
18 Rev. 7.3
but thou say thou must live in disobedience, and yet would be counted for
one of his too; but where is thy mark by which thou art known from the world?
those that are God's are marked, (...) known from the world, (...)
and therefore ha^^ of the world; but thou art in love with (...) world, and
can conform to them in all th^^ ways, words, works, and worships, and (...)
would be counted one of Gods too. O th^^ deceiver! thou deceivest both thy
selfe^ men that are like thee; but thou can (...) deceive the Lord: take
heed, repent, halt (...) longer betwixt God and the World; if th^^ wilt own
God, thou must dis-own the Wo^^ and the world will dis^owne thee; thou (...)
not have both.

I received these few lines enclosed in a ^^^ter, which came from my dear
Brother ^^orge Fox, whose desire was, that they ^^uld be put in a book: (I
having written is to go to the Press, was moved to answer, (...) desire) (it
being my desire also) as in the ^^ite out of the Treasury, as it is there
