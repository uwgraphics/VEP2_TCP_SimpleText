Martis 17. die Januarii 1670. Annoque Regni Regis CAROLI Secundi, Angliae,
etc. vicesimo secundo.
WHEREAS the Fish-Market at Billingsgate, by reason of the dismal Fire and
other Accidents, has for some late years been in much disorder, and yet
continues without that due Regulation, which by ancient Rules and Provisions it
ought to be: Therefore for restoring the same to the former good order and
condition, It was now considered and ordered by this Court, That the
Fish-Market at Billingsgate shall be kept from the bottom of St. Mary-Hill to
Billingsgate-stairs: And that no Fish be sold aboard any Vessel or Boat except
Herrings, Sprats, Makrel, and Shellfish, nor in any other place or Key, then
in the said place at Billingsgate, and at Queenhithe, which are the ancient
places accustomed for that purpose.

And it is further Ordered, That the Bell at Billingsgate shall be henceforth
duly rung by the Yeoman at the Waterside, for beginning of the Market there
(that is to say) from Lady day to Michaelmas at four of the Clock in the
morning, and from Michaelmas to Lady day at six of the Clock in the morning.
And if any shall presume to buy or sell any sorts of Fish at the said Markets
before those hours respectively, and notice thereof given by ringing of the
said Bell (excepting Makrel, Sprats. and Herrings) such Offender and Offenders
shall be proceeded against as Forestallers of the Market, as by the Law in this
case is directed and provided.

And it is further Ordered, That no Fish be hereafter landed at other then the
common and accustomed Keys and places abovementioned. Of all which the Yeoman
of the Waterside, and under-water Bailiff are to be careful, and vigilant to
prevent the contrary, at their utmost perils.

Avery.
