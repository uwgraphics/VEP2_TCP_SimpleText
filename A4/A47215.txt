A Contemplation on Bassets down-Hill by the most Sacred adorer of the Muses
Mrs. A. K.
IF that exact Appelles now did live.
And would a picture of Elysium give;
He might pourtrai'ct the prospect which this Hill
Does show; and make the eye commaud at will.
Here Is many a shire whose pleasauntness for sight
Does yield to the Spectators great delight.
There Is a large Field gilded with Ceres gold;
Here a green mead does many Heifers hold:
There Is pasture grown with virdant grass, whose store,
Of Argent-sheep shows th'owner is not poor.
Here springs do intricate Meanders make
Excelling far Oblivion's Lethe Lake.
There woods and Coppises harbor as many
And sweet melodious Choristers, as any
Elysium yields; whose Philomel'an lates
Merit the highest of the Lyrick's praise
Here Is Flor a decked with robes of Or, and Azur,
Fragrently smelling yeild's two senses pleasure.
Hence Zephirus does breath his gentle gales
Cool on the Hills, and sweet throughout the Vales
How happy are they that in this Climate dwell?
Alas! they cannot their own sweet welfare tell;
Scarce I my self whilst I am here do know it
Till I see it is Antithesis to show it.
Here are no smoking streets, nor howling cries,
Deafning the earcs, nor blinding of the eyes;
No noisome smells to infect, and choacke the air,
Breeding diseases envious to the Fair.
Deceit is here exiled from Flesh, and Blood:
(Strife only reigns, for all strive to be good.)
With Will hi^ verse I here will make an end
And as the Crab does always backward bend
So, though from this sweet place I go away
My loyal heart will in this Climate stay.
Thus heartless, does my worthless body rest
Whilst my heart lives with the ever blessed.
