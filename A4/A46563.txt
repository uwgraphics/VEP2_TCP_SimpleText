By the King, A PROCLAMATION For putting in Execution the Additional Act for
Improvement of Tillage.
JAMES R.

WHereas by an Act made in the Two and twentieth Year of the Reign of Our late
Brother of ever Blessed Memor^ Entitled, An Act for the Improvement of
Tillage, and the Breed of Cattle, It was Provided and Enacted, That from and
after the Nine and twentieth of June One thousand six hundred and seventy, and
from thence forward, certain Rates should be paid for the Custom and Poundage
of Foreign Corn and Grain Imported into this Our Kingdom according to the
Prices of English Corn at the Times, Havens and Places when and where the same
should be Imported. And forasmuch as no Provision was made by the said Act for
ascertaining and determining of the said Prices, whereby the said Law was
rendered ineffectual, One other Act was made in the First Year of Our Re^gn,
Entitled, An Additional Act for Improvement of Tillage, whereby it is
Provided, amongst other things, That all and every Our Justices of the Peace
for the several and respective Counties within Our Kingdom of England, Dominion
of Wales, and Our Town of Berwick upon Tweed, shall at their next respective
Quarter Sessions after Michaelmas and Easter yearly, by the Oaths of Two or
more honest and substantial Persons of the respective Counties, being neither
Merchants nor Factors for the Importing of Corn, nor any ways concerned nor
interessed in the Corn Imported, and each of them having a Freehold Estate of
Twenty pounds per Annum, or a Lease-hold Estate of Fifty pounds per Annum above
all Charges and Reprizes, and being skilful in the Prices of Corn, and by such
other ways and means, as to them shall seem fit, to Examine and Determine the
Common Market Prices of midling English Corn and Grain of the respective Sorts
in the said former. Act mentioned, as the same shall be commonly bought and
sold in the said respective Counties into which any Foreign Corn or Grain shall
be Imported, and certify the same, with Two such Oaths made, as aforesaid, in
VVriting annexed, unto Our Chief Officer and Collector of Our Customs for the
time being, residing in the said respective Ports and Havens where the said
Corn and Grain shall be Imported, to be hung up in some Public Place in the
Custom-house. And it is thereby likewise Enacted, That the Custom and Duty of
Foreign Corn and Grain Imported into any of Our said Dominions of England,
Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, appointed by the said former Act to be
paid, shall be Collected and paid according to the Prices contained in such
respective Certificates as aforesaid, and not otherwise. And it is further
thereby Provided, That all that by virtue of the said last mentioned Act is to
be done by Our Justices of the Peace at their Quarter Sessions in their several
Counties, shall be done and performed in like manner in the City of London in
the Months of October and April yearly by the Mayor, Aldermen and Justices of
the Peace there; And that the Persons making such Oaths shall be no
Corn-Chandler, Mealman, Factor, Merchant, or other Person Interested in such
Corn so to be Imported, but shall be some substantial Housekeepers living in
Middlesex or Surrey, qualified as aforesaid. And whereas We are given to
understand by the Humble Petition of several of Our Loving Subjects Trading in
Corn, That through the general neglect in most parts of Our Kingdom, of putting
the said last mentioned Act in Execution, by ascertaining the Prices of Corn
and Grain, as is thereby directed, and by the subtle and crafty practices of
unfair Dealers, by raising the Price of Corn in some few and small Markets,
when Corn has generally born but a low Price, on purpose to defraud Us of the
higher Duty due by Law, and thereby to enable themselves to undersell Our
Loving Subjects Trading in Corn of the growth of Our Dominions, which mischiefs
were principally intended to have been prevented by the said Acts. And being
fully satisfied that the said Act made in the First Year of Our Reign, is of
Public benefit to this Our Kingdom: We have thought fit, by and with the
Advice of Our Privy Council, to signify and Publish Our Will and Pleasure,
That the said Act made in the First Year of Our Reign, be duly and strictly put
in Execution. And We do hereby Will and Command Our Mayor, Aldermen, and
Justices of the Peace within Our City of London for the time being, and all and
every Our Justices of the Peace for the time being for the several and
respective Counties and Places within Our Kingdom of England, Dominion of
Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, That from henceforth they do Half-yearly
duly and strictly observe the Directions of the said Act, in examining and
determining the Common Market-Prices of Corn and Grain within their respective
Counties and Places, and make Certificate thereof to Our Chief Officers of Our
respective Custom-houses, as by the said Act is Directed. And to the end they
may be constantly put in mind of their Duties therein, We do strictly Charge
and Command all and every Clerks of the Peace and Town-Clerks at the several
Sessions of the Peace next after Easter and Michaelmas, to cause this Our
Proclamation to be fixed in some open place in the respective Session Houses,
that it may be read by Our Justices of the Peace attending such Sessions, and
to cause the same to be constantly read at the said respective Sessions. And
We do strictly Charge and Command all and every of Our Chief Officers and
Collectors of Our Customs in Our several Ports and Havens, that they yield
Obedience to Our Royal Will and Pleasure in the due Observance of the said
Act, as they will answer the contrary.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Fourth day of November, 1687. In the Third
Year of Our Reign.
