This day the following Act past into an Act of this Court.
WHereas by a Clause in an Act of Common Council made the twentieth day of
July, in the seventh Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, in the
Majoralty of Sir Robert Ducy, It was amongst other things Enacted in the words
following, That the Lord Mayor of this City, for the time being, shall not at
any time hereafter choose or elect any Commoner of this City to be Sheriff of
the City of London, and of the County of Middlesex, so long as there shall then
be an Alderman of the City Eligible to the said Office.

Which said Clause, in respect of Accidents or Circumstances, may not at all
times be convenient to be practiced.

And whereas by another clause in an Act of Common Council, made the sixth day
of June, in the thirty fifth Year of King Charles the Second, in the Majoralty
of Sir William Pritchard, Knight; It was amongst other things Enacted in the
words following, That the Person who shall be Nominated and Elected according
to ancient usage by the Lord Mayor of this City, for the time being, to be one
of the Sheriffs of the City of London and County of Middlesex, and such
Election shall be declared to the Commons of the said City assembled in Common
Hall upon the twenty fourth day of June, shall there by the said Commons be
confirmed and allowed to be one of the Sheriffs of the said City and County
accordingly: And that upon proposing the said Person to be confirmed to he said
Common Hall, in case any Hands shall be holden up in token of Confirmation, the
said Person shall be taken to be confirmed and allowed, and then another Person
shall be chosen by majority of Hands to be the other of the said Sheriffs, and
to join with him that shall be so confirmed.

Which said Clause being not only repugnant to reason, but contrary to the
Rules and Methods of Elections;

Be it therefore Enacted by the Mayor, Aldermen and Commons in Common Council
assembled, and by the Authority of the same, that the said several Clauses
before-recited, and either of them, and every Article and Thing contained in
them, or either of them, shall be, and are hereby repealed, annulled and made
void.

And Whereas by several Acts of Common Council, the Election of Sheriffs,
Chamberlain, Bridgmasters, and Auditors of the Chamberlain and
Bridghouse-Accounts, and Aleconners, are appointed on Midsummer-day yearly,
except the Sheriff or Sheriffs, Chamberlain, or other of the said Officers, for
the time being, shall die, or for just Cause be removed: And whereas in some
years (as in this present year) Midsummer-day happens to fall on the Lords day,
commonly called Sunday, which ought to be kept holy, and is a necessary and
required part of the service of God, and enjoined by the Laws and Statutes of
this Realm;

Be it therefore Enacted and Declared, That from henceforth, whenever
Midsummer-day shall happen to be on the Lords day, commonly called Sunday, that
the Election of the Sheriffs, Chamberlain, Bridgmasters, Auditors of the
Chamberlain and Bridghouse Accounts, and Aleconners, shall be on the day next
following, any Act or Acts, or any other Usage to the Contrary notwithstanding.

Goodfellow.
