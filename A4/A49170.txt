THE Lord RUSSELS Last Farewell to the World.
A SONG.
^

Farewell, farewell to Mortal Powers,
and fond Ambitious Fools;
Now guiltless Blood requires ours,
from Providence that Rules.
Farewell to Monmouth, Horned Gray,
who are from Justice fled;
And left me to this fatal Day,
to loose my Plotting Head.
II.
Of all the Lords of our Cabals,
I am the first that Dies
Byth' hand of Justice, which foretells
a Counter Sacrifice;
That Blazing-Star at Stafford's Death,
foretold a fatal Change:
Now I declare, with my last breath,
it is but just Revenge.
III.
Farewell to our late Parliaments,
which made Three Kingdoms shake;
Our Lawless Votes (my Soul torments)
was for Rebellions sake:
Th'Exclusive Bill I did promote
with vigor, spleen, and power;
Thereby to cut a Monarchs Throat,
that caused this Bleeding Hour.
IV.
The best of Kings I sought to Kill,
and draw'd in Thousands more:
Who neither wanted Wealth nor Will,
and Traitors long before:
Besides the Peasants and the poor,
for Insurrection bent;
To lay the Kingdom all in gore,
to please a Parliament.
V.
We neither feared Law nor Right,
Prerogative nor Fate;
Impeached Queen and Duke for spite,
to make the King afraid:
We thought he durst not call to count
our great Conspiring Heads;
But now like me they all must mount,
and fall into the Shades.
VI.
If we had Hanged Tony and Tom,
when first the Plot begun;
Then I to this had never come,
nor James from Justice run:
Denying of the Plot's in vain,
since Essex cut's own Throat;
Both Rouse and Walcot owns the same,
and all the rest must do it.
VII.
For my Confession I commit
toth' Groaning-Board's Divine;
It Is his desire to Word it fit,
I hope for no Design;
If Whiggish Cant, he puts upon it,
with 'quivocating Shamms;
Then score him up, on our account,
his Libel to the Flames.
Finis.
