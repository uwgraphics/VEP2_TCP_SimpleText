An Introduction.
THat Observation, man's extremities are Gods opportunities, was never more
abundantly and experimentally made good, then in these latter days, and in
none of these more then on Friday the 13. of January, 1642. in and toward the
City of London, where his Majesty's unexpected answer to an humble Petition
presented to his Majesty at Oxford, from the Lord Major and Common Council of
that Honorable City, made many sad hearts; not only in regard that all the
unwearied and loyal endeavors of Parliament and Citle (with other parts of
the Kingdom) have made no deeper impression upon his Majesty's heart (the
greatest treasure for which they have contended) but also in some doubtful
expectation what advantage such spirits might have made of it, at least to the
unsetling of the peace, and disuniting the spirits of the Citi^, who steer all
their actions by that maxim of Policy, Divide and impera, divide, and do
what you will: The rather when they observed that the counsel of some not so
well wishers certainly to the public safety, as to their own private
interests had prevailed with his Majesty, that His answer should be published
in a Common Hall, by His Maj^sties express messenger for that purpose, when as
the Petition was humbly tendered to His Majesty from a Common Council. To
avoid all inconveniences, it pleased the wisdom and goodness of Heaven to
direct the Parliament to choose an honorable Committee of Lords and Commons to
be present at the reading thereof; and the Governors of the City to order
that all the Companies should first meet at their several Halls, and then
come in their City habits to the Guildhall, where his Majesty's answer was to
be read: When the Committee of both Houses, with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and
such a confluence of Liverie men as has not been seen there (in the memory
of the eldest man in the City) being met, the Lord Mayor commanded the Town
Clerk to read in the audience of that great Assembly, the Cities Petition,
which here follows:

To The Kings most Excellent MAJESTY. The humble Petition of the Major,
Aldermen, and Commons, of the City of London.
Shows,
THat the Petitioners, Your Majesty's most humble and loyal Subjects, being
much pierced with the long and great divisions between Your Majesty and both
Your Houses of Parliament, and with the sad and bloody effects thereof, both
here and in Ireland, are yet more deeply wounded by the mis-apprehension which
your Majesty seems to entertain, of the love and loyalty of this Your City,
as if there were some cause of fear, or suspicion of danger to Your Royal
Person, if Your Majesty should return hither; And that this is made the
unhappy Bar to that blessed Reconciliation with Your great and most Faithful
Council, for preventing that desolation and destruction, which is now most
apparently imminent to your Majesty and all your Kingdoms.

For satisfaction therefore of your Majesty, and clearing of the Petitioners
innocence, they most humbly declare, (as formerly they have done) that they are
no way conscious of any disloyalty, but abhor all thoughts thereof: And that
they are resolved to make good their late solemn Protestation and Sacred vow
made to Almighty God, and with the last drop of their dearest bloods to defend
and maintain The true Reformed Protestant Religion, and according to the duty
of their Allegiance, Your Majesty's royal Person, Honor and Estate, (what
ever is maliciously and most falsely suggested to your Majesty to the contrary)
as well as The Power and Privileges of Parliament, and the lawful Rights and
Liberties of the Subject: And do hereby engage themselves, their Estates, and
all they have, to their uttermost power, to defend and preserve your Majesty
and both Houses of Parliament from all tumults, affronts, and Violence; with as
much loyalty, love, and duty, as ever Citizens expressed toward Your Majesty,
or any of Your Royal Progenitors in their greatest Glory.

The Petitioners therefore upon their bended knees do most humbly beseech your
Majesty to return to Your Parliament (accompanied with Your Royal, not Your
Martial Attendance) to the end that Religion, Laws, and Liberties may be
settled and secured, and whatsoever is amiss in Church and Commonwealth,
reformed by their advice, according to the fundamental Constitutions of this
Kingdom; And that such a Peace may thereby be obtained, as shall be for the
glory of God, the honor and happiness of your Majesty and Posterity, and the
safety and Welfare of all your Loyal Subjects, who (the Petitioners are fully
assured, whatsoever is given out to the contrary) do unanimously desire the
Peace herein expressed.

And the Petitioners shall ever Pray, etc. MICHEL^.

THis being done, the Kings Messenger being wished to read his Majesty's
Answer to that Petition, made some apology to be excused, partly willing to
intimate that his Commission was but to deliver the Answer to the Lord Major,
(which seemed very strange to standers by, who were ready to conclude that if
his Majesty's Command had been of no larger extent, the trouble of a
Common Hall might well have been spared) and partly pleading the
inaudiblenesse of his voice in such a vast Assembly, but being deemed the
fittest for that service by the Honorable Committee, the Lord Major and his
Brethren, he then read his Majesty's Answer, which here follows.

His Majesty has graciously considered this Petition, and returns this Answer.
THat His Majesty does not entertain any mis-apprehension of the love and
loyalty of his City of London. As he has always expressed a singular regard
and esteem of the affections of that City, and is still desirous to make it
his chief place of residence, and to continue and renew many marks of His
favor to it; So He believes much the better and greater part of that His City
is full of love, duty, and loyalty to His Majesty: And that the Tumults which
heretofore forced His Majesty for His safety to leave that place, though they
were contrived and encouraged by some principal members thereof (who are since
well known, though they are above the reach of Justice) consisted more of
desperate persons of the Suburbs, and the neighboring Towns (who were misled
too by the cunning and malice of their seducers) than of the Inhabitants of
that City. He looks on His good subjects there as persons groaning under the
same burden which does oppress His Majesty, and awed by the same persons who
begat those Tumults, and the same Army which gave Battle to His Majesty: And
therefore as no good subject can more desire from His soul a Composure of the
general Distractions, so no good Citizen can more desire the establishment of
the particular peace and prosperity of that place by His Majesty's access
thither, then His Majesty Himself does.

But his Majesty desires His good subjects of London seriously to consider what
confidence His Majesty can have of security there, whilst the Laws of the
Land are so notoriously despised and trampled under foot, and the wholesome
Government of that City (heretofore so famous over all the world) is now
submitted to the Arbitrary power of a few deserate persons of no reputation,
but for malice and disloyalty to him: Whilst Arms are taken up not only
without, but against His consent and express command, and Collections
publicly made, and Contributions avowed for the maintenance of the Army which
has given Him Battle, and therein used all possible means, Treason and
Malice could suggest to them to have taken His life from Him, and to have
destroyed His Royal Issue, whilst such of His Majesty's subjects, who out of
duty and affection to His Majesty, and compassion of their bleeding Country,
have labored for Peace, are reviled, injured, and murdered, even by the
Magistrates of that City, or by their directions: Lastly, what hope His Majesty
can have of safety there, whilst Alderman Pennington, their pretended Lord
Major, (the principal author of those Calamities which so nearly threaten
the ruin of that famous City) Ven, Foulke, and Mainwaring, (all persons
notoriously guilty of Schism and High Treason) commit such Outrages in
oppressing, robbing, and imprisoning, according to their discretion, all such
His Majesty's loving subjects, whom they are pleased to suspect but for wishing
well to His Majesty: And His Majesty would know whether the Petitioners believe
that the reviling and suppressing the Book of Common Prayer (established in
this Church ever since the Reformation) the discountenancing and imprisoning
godly, learned, and painful Preachers, and the cherishing and countenancing
of Brownists, Anabaptists, and all manner of Sectaries, be the way to defend
and maintain the true Reformed Protestant Religion? That to comply with, and
assist persons who have actually attempted to kill His Majesty, And to allow
and favor Libels, Pasquils, and seditious Sermons against His Majesty, be to
defend his Royal Person and Honor according to the duty of their Allegiance
(...) Whether to imprison men's persons, and to Plunder their houses because
they will not rebel against his Majesty, nor assist those that do? Whether to
destroy their Property by taking away the twentieth part of their Estates from
them, and by the same Arbitrary power to refer to four standers by of their
own Faction to judge what that twentieth part is, be to defend the lawful
Rights and Liberties of the subject? And if they think these Actions to be
instances of either, whether they do not know the persons before named to be
guilty of them all? Or whether they think it possible that Almighty God can
bless that City and preserve it from destruction, whilst persons of such
known guilt and wickedness are defended and justified amongst them against
the power of that Law, by which they can only subsist?

His Majesty is so far from suffering Himself to be incensed against the
whole City, by the Actions of these ill men, though they have hitherto been
so prevailent, as to make the Affections of the rest of little use to Him; And
is so willing to be with them, and to protect them, that the Trade, Wealth, and
Glory thereof (so decayed and ecclipsed by these public Distractions) may
again be the envy of all foreign Nations, That He does once more graciously
offer His free and general pardon to all the Inhabitants of that His City of
London, the Suburbs, and City of Westminster (except the Persons formerly
excepted by Mis Majesty) if they shall yet return to their Duty, Loyalty,
and Obedience. And if his good Subjects of that His City of London shall first
solemnly declare, That they will defend the known Laws of the Land, and will
submit to, and be governed by no other Rule; If they shall first manifest, by
defending themselves, and maintayning their own Rights, Liberties, and
Interests, and suppressing any Force and Violence unlawfully raised against
those and His Majesty, their Power to defend and preserve Him from all
Tumults, Affronts and Violence: Lastly, if they shall apprehend and commit to
safe custody the Persons of those four men, who enrich themselves by the
spoil and oppression of His loving Subjects, and the ruin of the City, that
His Majesty may proceed against them by the course of Law, as guilty of high
Treason, His Majesty will speedily return to them with His Royal, and
without His Martial Attendance, and will use his utmost endeavor that they
may hereafter enjoy all the blessings of Peace and Plenty, and will no longer
expect Obedience from them, then He shall with all the Faculties of His Soul
labor in the preserving and advancing The true reformed Protestant Religion;
The Laws of the Land; The Liberty and Propriety of the Subject; and The just
Privileges of Parliament.

If notwithstanding all this, the Art and interest of those men can prevail so
far, that they involve more men in in their guilt, and draw that His City to
sacrifice it is present Happiness and future Hopes to their Pride, Fury, and
Malice, His Majesty shall only give them this Warning, That whosoever shall
henceforward, take up Arms without his consent contribute any Money or Plate,
upon what pretense of Authority soever, for maintenance of the Army under the
Command of the Earl of Essex, or any other Army in Rebellion against Him, or
shall pay Tonnage and Poundage, till the same shall be settled by Act of
Parliament; Every such Person must expect the severest punishment the Law can
inflict; and in the mean time His Majesty shall seize upon any part of his
Estate within His Power, for the relief and support of him and His Army raised
and maintained for the Defense of His Person, the Laws, and this His Kingdom;
And since he denies to His Majesty the duty and benefit of his subjection, by
giving assistance to Rebels, which by the known Laws of the Land is high
Treason, His Majesty shall likewise deny him the benefit of his Protection, and
shall not only signify to all His Foreign Ministers, that such Person
shall-receive no advantage by being His Subject, but shall by all other ways
and means proceed against him as a public Enemy to His Majesty, and this
Kingdom.

But His Majesty hopes and doubts not, but his good Subjects of London will
call to mind the Acts of their Predecessors, their Duty, Affection, Loyalty
and merit toward their Princes, the Renown they have had with all posterity
from and the blessings of Heaven which always accompanied those virtues, and
will consider the perpetual scorn and infamy, which unadvoidably will follow
them and their Children, if infinitely the meaner part in quality, and much the
lesser part in number, shall be a (...) to alter the Government so admirably
established, destroy the Trade so excellently settled, and to waste the wealth
(...) industrously gotten, of that flourishing City; And th^^ they will easily
gain up the Courage and Resolution to join with His Majesty in defense of the
Religion, Law and Liberty, which hitherto has and only can make themselves,
His Majesty, and His Kingdom happy.

For concurring with the Advice of His two Houses of Parliament, being with
Reference to the Commonwealth may be as well at this distance, as being at
White Hall, His Majesty doubts not but His good Subjects of London well know
how far (beyond the example of His Predecessors) His Majesty has concurred
with their advice, in passing of such Laws, by which He willingly has parte^
with many of His known Rights, for the benefit of the Subjects, which the
Fundamental Constitutions of this Kingdom did now oblige Him to consent unto,
and has used all possible means to beget a right understanding between them;
And will therefore apply themselves to those who, by making Just, Peaceable,
and Honorable Prepositions to His Majesty, can only beget that concurrence.

After he had read it once upon the Hustings, in the audience of those
Honorable persons, was (for the help of the lowness of his voice, and the
advantage of the great multitudes in the Hall) willed the second time to read
the same Answer in the Clock-house, in the audience of the body of that
Assembly, among whom, after he had finished his work, an inconsiderable
company near the door made some offers toward an acclamation, but finding no
expected Echo to answer their shout, wound up in a little modesty and a great
deal of silence, upon which the Earl of Manchester declared in his Speech as
follows.
