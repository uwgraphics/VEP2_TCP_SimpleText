The exceeding Riches of GRACE ADVANCED By the Spirit of Grace, in an Empty
Nothing Creature, viz.

Mris SARAH WIGHT, Lately hopeles and restles, her soul dwelling far from
Peace or hopes thereof.

Now hopeful, and joyful in the LORD, that has caused LIGHT to shine out of
DARKNESS; that in and by this Earthen Vessel, holds forth his Own eternal Love,
and the Glorious Grace of Jesus Christ, to the CHIEFEST of SINNERS.

Who desired that others might hear and know, what the LORD had done for her
soul, (that was so terrified day and night:) and might neither PRESUME, nor
DESPAIR and murmr against God, as she has done.

Published for the Refreshing of poor souls, by an Eye and Ear-witnes of a good
part thereof, HENRY JESSE, a servant of JESUS CHRIST.

TO HIS CHRISTIAN FRIENDS, Beloved in the LORD, in London, Cambridge,
Yorkshire, Suffolk, Essex, and elsewhere; The Exceeding Riches of Grace be
advanced.
My Beloved;
MY Spirit rejoices in the Lord, who has put such an opportunity as this
into my hand, of Publishing to you, and to others, (and hereby of Advancing,)
The Exceeding Riches of the Grace of God, in such a Pattern thereof, as here
follows: The Daughter of a gracious Matrone, of mine acquaintance in the
Parish where I weekly Preach in London: who was in as hopeles and desperate a
condition in her self, as ever was any. Now often admiring, and uttering to
others, especially to afflicted, despairing, mournful souls, (that resort now
to her,) the unsearchable Treasures of Grace, to the ungodly, and chiefest of
lost, undone sinners. The main Causes urging me to Publish it to you, and the
Contents thereof, are in the Books beginning: The several Uses are in the End.
You know that the works of Jehovah are great, honorable, wonderful, and
glorious; and are greatly to be magnified; sought out of all them that have
pleasure therein: He makes them to be remembered. (Ps. 111. 2, 3, 4.)
Especially his works of Psalm. 145. 9. (...)
tender-Mercies, which are over (and Psalm. 145. 9. (...)
upon) all his works. How desirable is it to one, and to the friends of one,
that is in great extremity of misery, bodily, or spiritual; to hear of
another, that was just in the same condition, that now is cured? How much
longed for, is a safe Harbor, to a weather-beaten Ship, tossed with Tempests?
(Isa. 54. 11.) How refreshful is rest and ease, to a tempted, hurried, wearied
soul? ( Job 7.2-4.) How joyful and beautiful is the Romans 10. 15.
glad tidings of the Gospel of Peace, of riches of Grace, of the perfect 2 Cor.
5. 21.
righteousness of Christ, for the 1 Timothy 1.13-15.
chief of sinners, Ephesians. 2.15.16.3.
enemies, murmurers, ungodly ones? to souls wearied out in looking on
themselves, and their sins, and desperate wickedness of their own hearts; and
that gladly would mend all, and patch up a righteousness in themselves, or
partly there: ( Romans 10.3.) that would first find a thorough change in them,
such a dying of sin, and holy walking; before they think they may believe that
Christ dyed for such as they Romans 5. 7, 8. 10.
; or justifies such ungodly Romans 4.5.
ones; How mighty (through 2 Cor. 10. 4
God) may it be, to support poor souls, that are persuaded they are reprobates
Lam. 3.8-17-22.40.
, that are assured of it upon certain grounds, (as they judge;) and that they
are damned Io. 3.17.22.
, and in Hell already; that never any in their case was, or can be saved 1 Cor.
6.9-11.
; that the sins of Manasses, of David, of Peter, of Paul, of Mary Magdalen,
yea, and of Cain, Judas, and Pilate, are all less then their sins, and
blasphemies; and if all they might be saved, yet themselves should surely be
damned: for such to hear of one, that but lately was in the very same
condition; now sounding forth, and wondering at, the Exceeding Riches of Grace
to her, the chiefest of sinners, ( Psalm. 35.10.) to hear her self telling such
despairing souls; You cannot be more desperate, or more certain of hell and
wrath, then I lately was: and comforting them, by the same consolations,
wherewith her own soul is now comforted in the Lord. (2 Cor. 1.4.) This, all
this, you have here held forth, in this Pattern of Gods patience, and abundant
goodness toward this his unworthy Handmaid, whose low and base estate he has
regarded: He causing LIGHT to shine out of DARKNESS, (2 Cor. 4.6.) The writing,
transcribing, and often perusing hereof, has been, and is sweet and precious
to me, I must confess: I with your reading it may be so, and much more, to
your souls.

As you read, Consider; Admire the LORD in his surpassing Grace to ungodly
ones. ( Mic. 7.18.) Do not so commend the party, that is but an Earthen vessel,
born in sin, Psalm. 51.5.
as you Ephesians. 2.1-3:
are: but still, all along exalt and commend the LORD, who alone is to be
exalted, (Isa. 2.11. 1 Cor. 1.29, 30, 31.) Who puts his treasure into an
Earthen vessel of purpose, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and
not of flesh. (2 Cor. 4. 7.) Be the more vile in your own eyes, when you see,
God is pacified toward you, for all that you have done, (Ezekiel. 16. 63.) And
from believing his love to your souls; in love study what you should render to
him, in Christ's Name, (Psalm. 116.12. Col. 3.17.) Praise the Lord for leaving
such Patterns of his Riches of Grace, [as that of Mris Drake Revived, and that
of Gods gracious thoughts, toward great sinners, (by Dr Homes;) in a late
Book, so called; so] especially this: And Pray for her, [if the Lord shall
restore her body, which as yet is weak, to eat at all, or to drink but very
little, (of fair water, or small Beer, and that only at once in two, or
three, or four days:) and by her daily spending that small strength she
has, by often uttering forth the treasures of Grace, and by often speaking to
comfort despairing souls: seven or more whereof have resorted to her:] that
she may walk humbly, rendering again in her measure, according to the benefit
done unto her. [Since the former was fitted for the Press, she then not being
likely to live, unless the Lord should work a Miracle: He raised her
wonderfully, by faith in his Son, without any means, (when she could use
none;) and that by two degrees: First, to EAT, and to ARISE, ( Iun. 11. 1647.)
Then (on Midsummer day,) to WALK; as both follow, near the end of the Book,
Page 133. to 143.] And Pray for despairing souls, (here now being many of
them) and for the more exalting of Jesus Christ, in the pouring out of his
Spirit upon his sons and daughters that believe, by stretching out his hand
to heal, (souls and bodies:) and that Signs and wonders may be done in his
Name; As the Disciples prayed, Act. 4. 29. as he has promised, Job. 7. 38, 39.

TO HIS RESCPECTED FRIEND AND CHRISTIAN SISTER, Mris MARIE WIGHT, widow, in
Lawrence Pountney in London.
Honored Sister, I salute you in our Lord Jesus.
To this Relation following touching your beloved Daughter, [ the most whereof
your self, and a good part whereof, your Son, ( by a special Providence of
God, bringing him from Oxford hither, at that time of love,) have been both
Eye- and Ear-witnesses,] as you have the nearest interest of any: so it cannot
but be acceptable to you, to retain such a Monument of the Exceeding Riches of
GODS GRACE manifested to her, and uttered by her; that until April 6. for
four years together, had been so deeply afflicted in Spirit, tossed with
Tempest, and not comforted. Whereby both your self, and all your Christian
friends in London, Daintrie, in and about Shrewsbury, and elsewhere, that have
known your Sisters sad condition; and have prayed and mourned for her; now that
God has restored comforts to her, and to her mourners, ( Isa. 57, 18.) they
may the more be stird up to praise and magnify the Name of the God of Pardone,
the God that hears Prayer. And if the Lord please to moove in the reading
hereof, it may administer some door of hope, to some other poor souls, that
are in as sad a condition, in as woeful and doleful a plight, as your Daughter
lately was in, and had so continued, especially since she was about eleven or
twelve years of age, till now of late, that she is toward sixteen, as you
more fully know. I do acknowledge the LORDS goodness, and bless his holy
Name for his gracious dispensation toward me, that by means of Mris Sarah
Jones ( then of Lambeth) he brought me to sympathize with you, when (about ten
or eleven years ago) your soul was (as it had been for some years
together,) in sad despair: and that soon after he refreshed me with the
refreshings that he gave in to your soul. And that hereby the most wise God,
made such way for acquainting me so fully also, first with your beloved
Daughter Sarah her sorrowful, and then with her so joyful estate: and that
gave me so many opportunities of being frequently with her, that I also with
your self, might be a witness of both; and might be an instrument of
Publishing to the world, THE EXCEEDING RICHES OF HIS GRACE, EXALTED toward
her; and by her to many sad despairing souls, and to others: So as I hope the
Lord will make it isntrumental for the great refreshing of many poor, sinful,
sorrowful, weary souls; that thus may be partakers of the same.

When some shall hear that when your Daughter was struck both Deaf and Blind,
and so could neither hear the Word, nor read it; that then should be the time
of love. And when they shall read such unfoldings of Gospel- Mysteries by a
child, newly comforted, before she could hear any Creature speak to her;
(page 16.) such descantings on several choice Scriptures, discovering the
Gospels pith and marrow, that was folded up therein: so amplifying them by
illustrations, and making such application: some will be ready to reject all,
as incredible: some will gaze on you, or say; Blessed is the womb that bare
such a child; instead of exalting God alone. Then have you need to remember
what answer Jesus Christ gave to such an expression, (Luke 11. 27, 28.) and
what he said, Rejoice not in this, -- but rather rejoice that your Name is
written in Heaven. When some shall read, how her eyes and ears were opened,
first for a time, when was greatest need, and shut again for a season; and how
when in humane reason, she was unlike to live two days more: that then, and
not till then the Lord should raise her up by Faith, to EAT and ARISE; and
then to WALK, (page 133-138-141.) they will wonder. And some will come, or send
to you, to your son, and to your daughter, to enquire about it; as some came to
Hezekijah, to enquire of that wonder, that was occasioned by him, (2 Chronicles. 32.
24-31.) The lifting up of his heart thereupon, and his not rendering according
to the benefit done unto him: [ which you heard sweetly opened and applied, on
the day of Thankesgiving, for your daughters restoring; page 144.] and his
humbling himself for that lifting up of his heart; are all writ for our
instruction and benefit: as also Herod's taking Glory to himself, Act. 12.22,
23. and Christ's warning against this, Joh. 5.44. All this showing what we are
subject unto; and what cause there is to look up to Jesus Christ our strength,
our all in all; that he would not leave us to our selves; but make us like
himself, humble, (Phil. 2.3-9.) and like his Apostles, that rent their
garments when they were admired; and led such out to the alone exalting of the
God of Heaven himself in his Son, (Act. 14. 14. Act. 3. 12, 13.) Who shortly
will bring down every high thing, and he alone will be exalted in the Earth:
When great voices shall say, THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD, ARE BECOME OUR LORDS,
AND HIS CHRIST'S; AND HE SHALL REIGN TO THE AGES OF AGES, Rev. 11. 13-15. Even
so, Come Lord Jesus; Amen. The joy hereof frequently refreshes with the
refreshings of God: London ( Postscript. Moonths according to Holy Scriptures,

Your fellow servants and Brother, having and holding the witness of Jesus;HENRY
JESSE, alias HENRY JACIE.

MAy 24. 1647. Mris SARAH WIGHT, being then still very weak in body, (and
keeping bed since April 6.) said thus to the Relator: I would others might
hear how graciously the Lord has dealt with me, the chiefest of sinners, that
none might DESPAIR and murmr, as I have done: Though I murmured as they in
the Wilderness, as much as those that sell, yet he has brought me into the land
of Canaan: and has brought Legion to her right mind, and set her at his feet.
I was strongly persuaded that what I did eat or drink, it was as the unworthy
eating the Sacrament, I still did cat and drink my own damnation: every thing I
did, or saw, was terror to me. So it remained, and might have remained for
ever, had not his loving kindness prevented me, and drawn me to himself.

O that all creatures, reasonable and unreasonable, might praise the Name of
the Lord And I would others might hear of this, that none might PRESUME: For
if they knew the terrors that I have felt, the terrors of Hell, for sinning
against light, against God, and against a Parent, for murmuring, lying,
revolting; (judging I had committed that impardonable sin,) if they knew what
it is to have God hide his face, and be as an enemy, they would not presume.

To the Christian Reader, GRACE and PEACE.
MAny of these precious Pearls, these hidden Mysteries of the Treasury of the
glorious Gospel being gathered and stored up together by the Relator, as they
were brought to light day by day, before the 27th of April last: Diverse
Christian friends, that had been partakers thereof, judged it unmeet they
should be hid and hoarded up for a few to enjoy in private: much desiring they
might be published, both for better supply to themselves, and to many others
whom the Lord might please to support, refresh, and enrich thereby: When no
more was gathered then what might be contained in two sheets or three.

The Earthly Vessel of conveyance being then most likely to return to earth,
within a few days. Hence was the more cause of willingness to yield to this
desire; and to prefix the Letter foregoing (for the better confirmation hereof)
writ April 27. 1647. After that day she remaining as weak as before, and
unable to eat at all for eleven weeks together; or to drink, but only once in
two or three, or once in four or five days: and still drinking less and
less, then that before: ( Page 55, 56.) and her drink being only fair water,
till April 19. and sometimes small beer afterward (never strong beer.) Thus
was this put to the Press, and in the mean while, one day after another was
occasion of enlarging it, by Conferences, etc. and of her still drawing nearer
death, in outward appearance, till June 11. And before June 11. and June 25.
1647. ( which were the days of the Lords wonderful raising up her body by
Faith, as is showed page 135.-) a good part thereof was printed. Yet seeing the
more goodness the Lord magnified toward her, the chiefest of sinners; the
more his love therein melts and abaseth her; (as Page 119. 125. 134. the LORD
so abase her still:) Its hoped the LORD will keep her soul in that humble
frame: whereby the publishing hereof, which may be for great refreshing to many
sad, troubled, disconsolate souls, and to others, who through God may reap
abundant fruit hereby; may be no hurt to her; nor any cause at all of
repenting, to the Relator, or others; but of rejoicing and thankesgiving to
many: which is the longing desire, and humble request of Him that longs to be
made more conformable to the death of Christ: London, scrip. still. 4. Mon. 23.
day. Vulg. July 16. 1647.
to dye to himself, and to live to God; and to walk in, and be led by the
Spirit.

A Postscript to the Reader.
For better satisfying some, that would know many particulars distinctly, or
else they will not believe what wonders are here mentioned: Here is added,
touching this handmaids Parents: Her Father was Mr Thomas Wight, (page 5.) son
to Mr Wight of Daintree; and Brother to Mr Not. Wight, Preacher in Tewksbury:
Her Mother, Mris Mary Wight, above seven years ago was also in deep terror
and distraction of Spirit, (then living near London-stone:) till the Lords good
time of refreshing came. The Maid that tended on her, (hereafter mentioned,)
known to Mr Cradock of Wales, is well known to many of his London acquaintance:
Her name is, Hannah Guy, daughter to Mr Eli-Iabu Guy, late of Ireland of
Trayleigh in Munster Province: (whose Father went thither, to avoid the
Ceremonies here urged.) The Testimony of these two, the Mother and this Maid,
of her drinking so little, and not eating at all, for so long, (from March 27.
till June 11. page 55. etc.) both these being of approved faithfulness, may be
sufficient. (2 Cor. 13. 1.) Of the expressions from page 35. to the end of the
Book, the Relator was with them, an eare-witnes generally. [A great part of
nine leaves, was taken by him from the Relation of them, or one of them, being
writ as they spoke, Verbatim; ( viz. from page 16. to page 35.) Some of the
Repetitions therein, especially of two Names, being taken with the rest; so
passed to the Press with the rest: which now the Relator likes not, wishing
they had been forborne. Thou art entreated therefore to excuse it: and what
other failings are, or appear to be. Remembering, In many things we all Greek.
slip, Jam. 3. 2. Gal. 6. 1, 2.]

Amongst others that have been with this Handmaid, were these, of esteem
amongst many that fear the Lord in London; viz. Mr Prime of Cambridge, now
Minister in Lawrence Pountney, (lately of Black Friars;) Mr Cradock Minister in
Nicholas lane, Mr Barker Minister at Garlick-hill, Mr Brag from about Bristol,
Mr Isaac Knight late of Holland, Captain Harrison: The Lady Mayerne; and Mris
Jane Done her sister; Lady Hartop, with Mris Fant her sister, (now Mris Stock)
and Mr Ric-Wollaston: Mris Rolls, wife to Judge Rolls, Mris Mary Leeb, Hanna
Trapnel, Dinah the Blackmore; and those that are named page 8. 9, 10. and many
others. The Reason of naming many, is there rendered, viz. that some more
incredulous, might the sooner believe, and reap benefit, and not reject the
mysteries of God, against themselves, to their hurt. ( Luke 7.30.) Which may
plead excuse for naming them. Ioh. 4. 39. For the saying of the Woman, many of
the Samaritans believed on Jesus. Joh. 12. 11. Joh. 11. 45. By reason of
Lazarus being so raised up, many believed on Jesus. Act. 9. 42. By making knows
his raising up of Dorcas, many believed on the Lord.

If some yet say; How is it possible, that one so young, and never
understanding to purpose till now, should be able so to speak? It Is answered;
This is the Lords work, and it is mavelous in our eyes: who out of the mouth
of babes and sucklings, has ordained strength, and perfected praise, Mat. 21.
16. And has promised to his, to power out of his Spirit in the last days,
upon them, and upon their children, their sons and daughters, Act. 2. 17. 33.
38, 39. Our Lord Jesus promised to his Disciples, that his Holy Spirit should
bring to their remembrance, what he had said to them, Joh. 14. 26. This good
Spirit brought to her remembrance now, when it was most useful, what she had
read and heard formerly, and opened her heart to understand them: and opened
her mouth to utter them in an humble, melting manner; as he had opened to her;
even when her bodily eyes and ears were held; which since April 19. are both of
them opened.

Mr Saltmarsh his Letter. For my dear and honored Friend and Cosen, M H. JACIE.
Dear Cosen;
I Salute you in the Lord. I did much rejoice in those breathings of the Spirit
of God which I found in your little Book OF THE RICHES OF GRACE ADVANCED, etc.
Surely, the Lord is teaching his people, and fulfilling his promises; They
shall be all taught of God: (Joh. 6. 45.) And thus his New Covenant with his
people shall be more and more revealed, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in
that day, (Isa. 2.11.) When I meet with such precious manifestations of the
Lord, me thinks I taste those waters of life, those rivers of living water
which shall show out of the bellies of those, who believe in Christ, (Joh. 7.
38.) There is not a stream of this water, but it proceeds from the Throne of
Grace, ( Rev. 22. 1. Zach. 14.8,9.) though it flow in the valleys, in the
poor, low, and humble Christians.

I find in this Spiritual Treatise of yours, two things very experiment all;
the one is her Legal, and the other her more Gospel condition: In the first,
she is in bondage, in blackness, and darkness, and tempest; in much distress,
and shadow of death, her life drawing nigh unto hell: and afflicted with all
his waves, (Psalm. 88.3.7.) In her Gospel state, I find God showing wonders to
the dead, making the dead to rise and praise him; showing his loving kindness
in the grave, and his faithfulness in destruction: and making known his glory
in the dark, and his righteousness in the land of forgetfulness, (Psalm.
88.10, 11, 12.) And truly the voice of joy and gladness is in the tabernacles
of the righteous, (Psalm. 118. 15.) I find that when God reveals himself in
Christ, in his grace and love, the Spirit of the Christian is sweetly raised,
and cheered, and the love of the Lord is as wine, even as the spiced wine. I
make no question, but the Lord will fill this soul with more discoveries, then
this of the Riches of grace; this truth being that first discovery of God in
love.

Dear Cosen, you do well thus to watch the appearances of God in his, and to
publish them to the Saints.

I am yours in the Lord, JOHN SALTMARSH.

THE EXCEEDING RICHES OF GRACE ADVANCED.
THE Relator hereof (being one who desires to fear the Name of the LORD,)
having been an eye and ear-witnesse, both of the sad sufferings, and
longed-for- deliverance of this handmaid, Mris SARAH WIGHT; and upon his
enquiring at the first and best hand, having many of her precious Evangelicall
expressions, (as the first fruits thereof, [ viz. from page 16, to 35,])
testified to him, by such as are well approved off for godliness and
faithfulness; who were also eye and ear-witnesses with himself of the rest
here recorded; And he observing, and noting down presently from time to time,
since this happy change, such * Glad-tidings uttered of the Righteousness of
God, of his Faithfulness and Salvation, of his * benign Kindness and Truth:
he could not but Publish it to the World, for the exalting of this glorious
Name of of God; and for the refreshing of poor, hungry, empty, sinful,
burdened, drooping, desparing souls; that judge none to be so base and
hopeless as themselves; and for the building up of others in their holy faith:
he would not, might not, durst not keep it to himself alone, and so conceal
it, hide it, or withhold it from others; as he would not for all the world,
have the Lord withhold, or hide, or * close up his bowels of mercies from his
own soul; as the Psalmist argues *, Psalm. 40. 9, 10, 11. Hebrew.

For the better satisfying of some that would hardly give credit to the
wonderful things herein related: It was judged meet, there should be laid
down; 1. First somewhat touching this Handmaid, her parentage and dwelling
place. 2. Touching her Education. (page 5.) 3. Touching her Afflictions in
Spirit, especially since she wronged her Conscience, at her being about twelve
years old; till April 6. 1647. (she being in September following, 16. years
old.) And of godly Ministers, and others, that knew her soul in adversity, and
sought to comfort her: and of such as have seen her, and spoke with her, since
the LORD has comforted her. ( Page 6.8, 9.) 4. Touching the Lords delivering
her, April 6. 1647. when no creature could help, she being then struck deaf,
blind, and lame; and terrified beyond measure: this extremity was the Lords
opportunity. (page 14, 15.)


Then, 1. of her so continuing deaf and blind, from April 6, till April 19.
many days together; (except part of April 15. wherein she had satisfaction to
her troubled Spirit, that her Mother had pardoned her murmurings against her:
And part of April 17, to see and hear her Brother; as Page 25. and 29.)

2. Of her being acted, both then, and often after, to admire, utter forth, and
magnify the exceeding Riches of Gods Grace to sinners, to her the chief of
sinners. Her speeches of Grace, which follow, were all in her Bed, being in the
time of her bodies great weakness; caused partly through her former deep sense
of Gods wrath, consuming and pining away; And by seeking to beat out her eyes,
and Brains; and since this happy change, her stomach being exceeding weak;
not eating at all till June 11, and drinking so little, as is noted; her voice
thus being very low, and often whispering, (it could be heard by none, but that
were very near her;) uttered in an humble, melting manner; stopped sometimes
with tears of sighs; her eyes being always covered, because of that weakness,
and by spending her self in speaking to distressed souls, and to others.

3. Of her Conferences then and since; with many despairing souls: whose
Names, and dwelling places are so born by the Relator, in tender respect to
themselves, and their friends: least some not experienced in Temptations, might
the more reproach them, or the Name of God, for what these uttered in
distress, or through Temptation. But their Expressions, and the Answers to
them are recorded as near as could be, being then writ down, for help to
themselves hereafter, and to others in like condition, if the Lord will: Hoping
this will not offend them.

2. Conferences with others about the Church-Ordinances, the Spirits pouring
forth; about the New Covenant, the Law, Works, Man's Endeavors, Punishment for
sin, Redemption, etc.

4. Of the Lords power in sustaining her, above 75 days, by a little water
taken once in three or four or five days, and very little besides: [And then
raising her by FAITH.]

All these are here set down, though the latter are set down occasionally, and
not all in this same order.

I. TOuching her Earthly Parentage. This Mris Sarah Wight, was daughter to Mr
Thomas Wight, sometimes of the Auditors Office, and of the Exchequers Office:
(Son to old Mr Wight of Daintry.) Her earthly dwelling is now with her faithful
Mother Mris Mary Wight, widow, in Lawrence Pountney. Lane, by Caning-street in
LONDON: Whose Father was Mr Edward Purcel Esquire, of Ansloo near Shrewsbury:
and whose former Husband was Mr Edward Vaughan Esquire, the Kings Receiver, and
Surveyer for Northamptonshire, and for Rutland-shire: (by whom, she had her
Son Mr Jonathan Vaughan, now of Alsoules in Oxford: Who not long since writ
thence a Consolatory Letter to this his sorrowful Sister SARAH, therein saying
thus: [ Do thou despair, because thy Temper is a Lion for his strength?
Behold the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Christ the mighty God: who can and will
deliver thee out of his paw. -- A fountain laid open for sin, and for
uncleanness. I verily believe, that although for the present you lie among the
pots, of no use: yet thy God will make thee a Vessel of Honor, an instrument
fit for thy Masters use; whereby he will square sinners, to his own glory,
etc.] Thin in his Letter is now fulfilled, and fulfilling.) She that was born
of flesh and blood, borne in sin; and that was by Nature a child of wrath:
is now borne from above, borne of God, having given to her Faith and Love: and
has Jesus Christ to her Mat. 12. 50. Romans 8. 17.
Brother; and God to her 1 John 3. 2.
Father, and her Psalm. 90. 1.
dwelling place; He 1 Jo. 4.12.16.
dwelling in her, and she in him. Let him and her that glories, not glory in
the flesh, but in the Lord 1 Co. 1.29.31 Jer. 9. 23.
alone.

II. Touching her Education: In the time of her Mothers deep afflictions of
Spirit, and sore Temptations, she was well trained up in the Scriptures, by
her godly faithful Grandmother, Mris Wight of Daintree. And when the Lords
time of Love was, that he vouchsafed to manifest his Grace in Christ to her
Mothers soul, then the Lord brought her home to her, she being then about
nine years old. She gave her self much to read and study the Scriptures:
Which though she then understood not aright; yet the Lord by his Holy Spirit
brought to her remembrance, and opened to her since her restoring, what
formerly she had read for great comfort and soul-refreshing to her self, and
to many others; as hereafter follows. (Which is a great encouragement to all
that fear God, to train up there children in the holy Scriptures; as, 2 Timothy 3.
15. Chap. 1.5. Prove. 22. 6. Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7. Genesis 18. 19.)

III. Touching her afflictions. From her childhood she was of a tender heart,
and often afflicted in Spirit: Her Temptations were not so great, till she was
about twelve years old; since which, they have continued with more violence
till April 6. 1647. it being about four years. [Shee is not sixteen years
old (as her Mother says,) till September following.]

The beginning of her more violent Temptations was thus: Her superior bid her
do a small thing, judging it meet and lawful: She did it, doubtingly,
fearing it was unlawful: and as she did it, a great Trembling in her hands
and body fell upon her: being condemned in her self. About a month after,
returning home, having been abroad, she had lost her hood, and knew she had
lost it. Her Mother asked her, for her hood. She suddenly answered, My
Grandmother has it. Her heart condemned her instantly, and trembled again
exceedingly. And these were the first chief occasions of her deep despair:
And upon this, she had cast into her Conscience, that she was both a thief,
and a liar, and was terrified ever since, that she was shut out of Heaven, and
must be damned, damned, damned.

In the last four years, she was often in such extremities, she could believe
nothing but Hell and Wrath -- to be her Portion; and other times, that there
was no heaven; nor no hell, but in our Conscience: and that she was damned
already, being an unbeleever: and therefore if she could but dispatch this
life of hers, there was an end of her sorrows. A subtle deceit of the old
Serpent! Hence she often attempted wickedly to destroy her self; as by
drowning, strangling, stabbing; seeking to beat out her eyes and brains;
wretchedly bruising, and wounding her self: (The chief cause of such
weakness since:) Many particulars whereof follow, in her own Relations.

But the Lord who is her life, and loved her then in her blood, he wonderfully
prevented her destruction, many ways. Sometimes by one or other at that
instant; sometimes staying her in the acting, when no creature was by:
Sometimes by bringing to her mind some choice Scripture: as this, No weapon
formed against thee, shall prosper, ( Isa. 54.17.) or this, None shall take
them out of my hand; or, out of my Fathers hand, ( Ioh. 10.28, 29.) This stopped
her sinful act, but the comfort stayed not.

Many precious Ministers came to comfort her: In London these, Mr Thomas
Goodwin, Mr Barker, Mr Lockyar, Mr Palmer (lately their Minister in Lawrence
Pountney) Mr Sprigge, Mr John Simpson, and others. And these came to her in or
near Shrewsbury, Mr Hildersham of Felton, Mr Paget (Father of Dr Paget now of
London) Mr Wright of Wellington, Mr Smith, Mr Fisher, Mr Blake, Mr Morgan
Floyd, Mr Moston: All these and many more godly Ministers and precious
Christians, being acquainted with her sad condition, endeavored to comfort
her: and she gladly would have received comfort; but it was then hid from her.

Some glimpse she had, especially by means of her kinsman, Mr John Brown, of
Shrewbury (a faithful and loving man,) and by one whom he brought with him,
viz. Mr Daniel Floyd: but it was soon ecclipsed again; and she remained in
grievous horror day and night; concluding she was a Castaway, a Reprobate,
walking daily in the midst of fire and brimstone, as one in Hell already. Till
the Lord (who had loved her with an everlasting love, and in loving kindness
prevented her ruin,) at last restored comforts to her, and to those that had
prayed and mourned for her. (Isa. 57. 18.)

And since that her much prayed-and hoped-for- deliverance, amongst many that
have visited her, were these Ministers; Mr Palmer, Mr Sprigge, and Mr Simpson
beforesaid, Mr Peter's, Mr Charnock of London, Mr Atherley of the Charterhouse
(with his wife,) Mr Hide of Wighton in Yorkshire, and the Relator. Also the
Lady Willoughby of Parham; the Lady Renula, and the Lady Clotworthy her sister;
the Lady Vermuiden, with her daughters, Mris Sarah, and Mris Katharine; Sir
Ric: Philips, and his Lady, daugh: to Dr Oxenbridge; Sir Rich: Saltonstall,
with his Lady: and Capt. Price, with his wife; Dr Coxe, Dr Debote, Dr Worsley,
Dr Paget, Physicians. Also Mris Fines, wife to my Lord Says eldest Son; and
Mris Harrison, wife to the Chamberlain of London; Col. Langhams wife, daughter
to the Lady Roberts; Mris Sarah Jones, wife to Mr Tho. Jones Esquire of
Tower Hill; Mris Berney of Norsolk: Mr and Mris Liggon, Mris Wilson at
Nags-head-Taverne; Mris Thorp, at Grave Maurice; Mr P. Burbon, and his wife;
Mris Owen, and Mris Hannah Allen, Booksellers; Mris Manning of Tower-street,
Mris Elizabeth Waldo, sister to Mr John Pocock; Mr Ellis and Mris Ellis, Mris
Hawkins, Mris Flood, and Mris Their, and her cousins, Mr Brigs Tailor and his
wife, all near London-stone: and of their nearer neighbors, Mr Jews Merchant,
Mris Palmer, Mris Thurrel, Mris Grace Philips, Mris Dupper, Mris Aires, etc.
Besides her Brother Mr Jonathan Vaughan, of Alsoules in Oxford; and her uncle
Mr James Wight of Southwark, and his wife; and other two Ants, Mris Anne and
Mris Mary Wight. Many more might be named, who have seen her of late, and have
bin much affected in hearing of the Lords wonderful workings, in, and toward
her: But these are sufficient to witness what they have seen, or heard, and
believe: many of them being persons of note, and of much esteem in London
amongst them that fear the Lord. The Naming of them, the Relator desires may
not be offensive to any of them, seeing it is done for the more assuring this
great and memorable work of Gods mercy, to some, that (like Thomas) will not
believe it, unless (at least) they may speak with some, that have been present
with her.

About a month before her great deliverance, Satan having but a short time so
to torment her, her storms and tempests were greatest of all. She was
grievously hurried with Temptations; so terrified, she could not rest at all,
for many days and nights together. Whilst she was able to go abroad, her
Mother would have her go with her to hear Sermons, on the Lords days, and on
the Lecture-dayes there. One Lecture-day she was gone forth before her Mother;
who missing her, went to the Assembly; and not finding her there, came forth;
and sudddenly went, and sent toward Thames to seek her: where she had been,
to have cast her self in, but was stayed from it by the power and goodness of
God: and being found, she had a command on her spirit to go to hear that
Sermon, and her Mother coming to her, she readily yielded to go with her
Mother to the Lecture there. Wherein was proved, what great favor God will
show toward the stock of the Jews; that he will grass multitudes of them into
their own Olive, pardoning their sins against Christ, restoring them to great
dignity, etc. He that preached, went in to Mris Wights house there, after the
Sermon; and spoke with her daughter, asking her, if the Lord spoke any peace to
her thereby. She answered, she would not for all the world, but she had
heard that Sermon. Being asked, why so? She said, That God will show mercy to
the Jews; and they are the basest people on earth; that so hate the very name
of Christians, and much more Christ himself: and yet that God will call them;
This supported her a little at that present; but it stayed not with her, and
she was again under horrid Temptations, to believe there was no God, no
Devil, no Heaven, and no Hell, but what she felt within her.

One day being strongly carried on in that temptation, that there was no other
Hell, but here in the conscience; As that famous Mris Hanywood had said and
done with a Venice Glass, (who said she was as sure to be damned, as that was
to break; and therewith threw it from her to break it; and yet it brake not;)
so did she with her little white drinking cup, an earthen cup; she said, As
sure as this cup shall break, there is no other Hell: and therewith she threw
the cup with violence, against the far side of the chamber; and though it light
against the wood, it brake not. Her mother took it up, and said, Lo here
child, it is not break. She got it again, and suddenly said so, and did with
it so again, and again; and once against the edge of the door. Thus she
struggled, and did four or five times, and yet it brake not; but at the fifth
time, a little nip brake out. And now since the Lord has created peace to her,
she has desired to drink still out of that her little cup: till their
Water-bearer unawares cast it down, and then it brake all to pieces.

In her despairing fits, she several times would turn to the places in Job,
and in Jeremy, where they cursed the day of their birth; and she said to this
effect; Job cursed the day wherein he was borne, and said, Wherefore have thou
brought me forth of the womb? Oh, that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had
seen me. She turning to the places, Job 3.3. Job 10. 18. And ( Ier. 20. 14. to
the end) Jeremy cursed the man that brought tidings of his birth, with bitter
curses, because his mothers womb was not his grave, and said, Wherefore came I
out of the womb, to see toil and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with
shame? But she said, Have not I much more cause to say so, then they had? for
they were in a blessed condition: but I am cursed, and must be a firebrand of
Hell for ever.

These and many other desperate expressions, she frequently used; especially
in the last month of her sorrows. When they increased daily, so that her soul
was exceedingly troubled, and she was, as it were all shattered to pieces. And
she was so weary of her life, and of her self, and of everything, she was
never at such a pass, in such extremity, in all her life before.

Her tender and good Mother, attending on her continually day and night, to
prevent her mischieving her self; being still upheld with great hopes, that
the Lord in his good time, would come in to her with his consolations; yea,
she was verily persuaded so, (as was also her Brother in Oxford;) And this
made her sore task the more easy; which else had been intolerable. Yet when
this extremity had continued long, so that for many days and nights together,
her mother had taken no rest. At last she was even wearied out with continual
watchings; and to the end her self might enjoy some rest, to prevent harm to
her self, she had spoke to a friend, desiring that her daughter might be for
a little season with her; which her friend was very willing unto; and her
daughter was desirous to go with her, that her Mother might enjoy rest. But
the Lord prevented both in his goodness. For when her friend was come, her
daughter was taken with such an exceeding trembling, and such extremity of
sorrow and trouble and weakness, that she was not able to go with her. A
forerunner of her deliverance.

Then her Mother procured a maid that feared God, to help to look to her, who
came that same day of her so trembling, being Tuesday April 6. When the maid
beforesaid came to her, she found her weeping most bitterly, and wringing her
hands grievously, saying, I am a Reprobate, a Castaway, I never had a good
thought in all my life. I have been under sin ever since I can remember, when
I was but a child, etc.

This heaviness was greatest, this night was darkest of all, when the day, the
joyful time of her deliverance was near at hand. And like as at the beginning
of her grievous despairing, about four years before, upon those two sins
beforesaid, a great trembling fell upon her at the beginning of her deep
despair and trouble: so now, at the ending thereof, the like trembling fell
upon her; such as she never had, at any other time. And now, thus trembling
exceedingly, and weeping and wringing her hands; she said to this effect: My
earthly Tabernacle is broken all to pieces; and what will the Lord do with me?
If I should hang on Gibbets, if I should be cut in pieces, if I should dye the
cruellest death that ever any did, I have deserved it; I would still justify
God: aye if he cast me to hell. (Thus it was with patient Job; He humbled
himself, and justified the Lord, when his restoring was at hand.) Her hands
and her feet were clunched, so as she could not stand. She was tempted and
sore urged to blaspheme God and dye. And when she was ready to speak, her
tongue was smitten. Afterward she being laid down, she said to her Mother,
I Will lie still, and hear what God will say to me: He will speak Peace, Peace. If
God will speak a word of Peace at the last moment, I should be contented. Then
she desired them that none might trouble her, but that she might lie in
peace. And she lay still, as in a sleep, (or as in a trance rather,) from that
tuesday night, April 6. till the last day of that week (called Saturday) at
night; except when she called for a little water to drink, and drunk two or
three cups of water. No other sustenance she took all that time. And this was
the time of love; when The Exceeding Riches of Grace was advanced.

April 10. 1647. that Saturday at night, about midnight, or after midnight,
she began to express the first expressions of comforts, of such
soule-satisfying comforts, that ever she so manifested: [though her soul
enjoyd them from that Tuesday night before; as since her Trances ceased, she
has declared.] Even now, when all man's help faild, and when all means before
used could not do it; and when now she was made incapable that way to receive
it, being now struck both blind, and deaf: her eyes being fast closed up,
wrapped up together: [A. Saul (who is called Paul) when the Lord converted him,
was three days without sight, and neither did eat, nor drink, Act. 9. 9.] And
thus she began: My soul thirsts for the water of life, and I shall have it:
My soul thirsts for the water of life, and I shall have it, (four times in
ardency of spirit uttering those words, then adding) a little water good
people, a little water. So she drank two or three of her little cups of water.
Then she sat up, and with a most sweet and heavenly countenance, and with
much brokennesse of heart, in an humble melting manner, Tears sometimes
trickling down, she spoke with a low voice, as follows.

Ah, that Jesus Christ, should come from the bosom of his Father, and take the
nature of man upon him! and come in such a low estate; and lie in a Manger Luke
2. 7.
! There Is three sorts of people in the world; a higher sort, and a middle sort,
and a lower sort: Christ came to the lowest soul; he lay in a Manger; a
contemptible place. Do you not see an excellency in him Phil. 3. 8.
? Do you not see an excellency in him? I tell you, there is more excellency in
him, in his lowest state, his meanest state, then in the world; aye, then in a
thousand worlds. Who came he to dye for? for sinners; aye for the greatest
sinners, the chiefest sinners, the chiefest sinners 1 Timothy 1. 13-15. Luke 18.
14.
? A dying Christ for a denying Peter; a dying Christ, for a denying Peter; a
dying Christ, for a denying Peter. Peter denied him, and yet he dyed for him
Mat. 26. 72. Luke 22. 31, 32.
. Go tell Peter! Go tell Peter Mark. 16. 7.
! Ah Peter! And then she paused a while, as admiring it: and proceeded thus:
For a Peter! for a Mary Magdalen! for a Thief on the Cross! that none should
despair: a crucified Christ, for a crucified Thief! a crucified Christ, for a
crucified Thief! A persecuting Saul, becomes a beloved Paul! for the chiefest
sinners! the chiefest sinners! Not the proud Pharisie, but the poor Publican
Joh. 5. 40.
. No sin separates from Christ, but the sin of Unbelief. And this is the
Faith, believing a full Christ, to a nothing Creature: a full Christ, to a
nothing Creatures: a full Christ, to a nothing Creature Joh. 1. 16. 2 Cor. 12.
31.
: To me, the chiefest of sinners: yet I obtained mercy She meant, being then
in unbelief.
through unbelief: Christ came not to find faith, but to give faith: Christ
came in to me, when I was in my unbelief. (Then she said pausing.) There Is a
fountain open, for Judah, and for Jerusalem; for sin, and for uncleanness. A
fountain open, for Judah, and for Jerusalem, for sin, and for uncleanness
Zach. 13. 1.
. A fountain, not streams, but a fountain: open, an open fountain: if a
door stand shelving, you cannot come in, but you must thrust to come in: but
if it stand wide open, then there is freedom for you to go, freedom for you
to go. Its open The house of David, is of Judah, Mat. 1.1,2.6.
for Judah; Judah that played the Harlot, yet God says to Judah, Return,
though thou have played the Harlot with many lovers, return, for I am married
to thee Jer. 3. 1. 14.
. For Judah, and for Jerusalem: and what was Jerusalem? her skirts were fu'l of
blood, her streets were full of blood Jer. 2.34. 2 King. 21.16.
. Yet the fountain is open for Judah, and for Jerusalem. For sin, and for
uncleanness: for all sin, for the greatest sin, the chiefest sin and
sinners. Who is this fountain? Jesus Christ, he is this fountain Joh. 7.37.
Rev. 1. 5.
: a filling fountain, and never dry; Luke 1. 53.
a filling fountain, and never dry; a filling fountain, and never dry. Who is
a God like to thee? pardoning sin Mic. 7. 18.
, all sin, sin past, present, and to come Heb. 10. 10-14.
: not only pardoning sin, but passing by the transgression of his heritage.
Passing by daily sins, and frailites: he retains not his anger for ever; He is
slow to wrath; bist he delights in mercy: He is slow to nothing but to wrath;
but he is swift to mercy. His wrath is but a little, in a little wrath: and
what is that? but with everlasting kindness will he show mercy Isa. 54. 8.
. His mercy, and his kindness is for ever, for ever. Christ was first
crucified, before he was glorified Luke 24. 26. Romans 8. 17.
. Before yot receive a Christ glorified, you must receive a Christ crucified.
[Thus the Lord opened her mouth to speak, much of it in the words of the holy
Scriptures, April 10 or 11. and so also April 13, and 15, and 17. April 19, 20.
25. etc. as hereafter follows; though she remained deaf and blind til April
19, from April 6: except part of April 15. and 17. ( the Wonder follows) nor
could she see to read by reason of the weakness of her eyes, til about the
midst of May, nor well then, til June 11. But as our Lord Jesus promised to his
Disciples, that his Spirit should teach them all things, and should bring to
their remembrance what he had said unto them, (Joh. 14. 26.) So now he thus far
graciously performed it to her. She neither cited Chapter, nor Verse now; nor
usually afterward. Her own words being writ down by the Relator first, he then
added (in a Parenthesis) such places of Scripture as were suitable to them, for
better satisfaction to many: the letter 1 John 3.8.
, Heb. 2. 14.
, Rev. 22.20.
, etc. with the proofs, are suitable to her own words preceding, where the like
letter is.]

Those her gracious expressions beforesaid, (and more to the like effect) she
uttered after midnight, April 10 or 11. and then ceased, and lay down: and
continued silent from April 10. till the 13th, being Tuesday at night
following, neither speaking, nor eating, nor drinking any thing in the mean
while.

When her Mother had moved her to take somewhat, laying her hand upon hers,
(for she heard not what was said to her;) she spoke as one troubled at it,
and said, Why do you hinder my Communion with God. And remained troubled,
sighing about it, for some time after: which caused a forbearing to urge her
therein.

Tuesday-night April 13. first having started suddenly, she said: The Devil
fights with me, as he did with Michael, and his Angels Rev. 12.7.14.
. Do you not see him? Do you not see him? [and she struck with the back of
her hand from her; and thus proceeded;] But the Angel shall prevail, the Lion
of the Tribe of Judah, has overcome him. The Accuser of the Brethren is cast
out: The Accuser of the Brethren is cast out: The Accuser of the Brethren is
cast out Rev. 12.7.14.
. Jesus Christ came to destroy the works of the Devil 1 John 3. 8.
. He took our nature upon him, that he might be partaker of our sufferings Heb.
2. 14.
. [Then she added] Come Lord Jesus; Come Lord Jesus Rev. 22.20.
: But why say I, Come? He is come, he is come, he is come: He has dispossessed
the strong man Luke 11.22.
, and has taken possession of my soul, and will Joh. 14. 16. 23.
dwell with me, for ever, for ever, for ever. How near are the Saints to
Christ? They are his Jewels Mal. 3. 17.
: Nay, they are his signet on his right hand: Nay, they are his seal on his
heart Cant. 8. 6.
: they lie in his bosom. When you take a thing out of a man's bosom, you
cannot take it, but you must touch the man: (clapping her hand on her breast.)
That that I admire most is, that Christ took our nature, he took our nature.
Men and Angels admire it: aye and Devils too, if they can. When the Lord does
any great thing, he puts his I to it: I, even I am he Isa. 43. 25.
. I Will make a New Covenant Jer. 31. 31-34.
: I Will write my Law in their heart: I Will pardon your sins: I Will do them away
as a thick cloud Isa. 44. 22.
. I change not, therefore are you not consumed Mal. 3.6.
. Ah, what a foolish creature am I? I could not endure to hear one speak of
the Devil, and I was as bad as he 1 John 5. 10.
, in distrusting of God, that dyed for me. Oh, that the world knew Jesus Christ
Joh. 4. 10.
! Sure they would not distrust him, they would not despite him, they would not
persecute him. Christ taught Simon how to bear the Cross: he bare it first
himself. I was found of them that sought me not, and to the Nation that looked
not after me, I said; Behold me, Behold me Isa. 65. 1.
. Then speaking somewhat louder, she said; As (...) (Holy, holy) is repeated 9
times in the Greek of Plantins Edition, which is cou^sed the best)
Love him, Love him, etc. These words she repeated nine or ten times, in
ardency of affection. ( Rev. 4.8.
Prove. 8. 17. 21.) Then she desired a little water to drink, [shee never having
loved strong drink, nor wine, nor strong water, since she was borne: of late
small beer, or water was her usual drink: but now, since Saturday the 27th of
March 1647. (when she took a little broth) till this day of the writing of
part hereof, being May 19. These 53. days together, she has taken no outward
sustenance at all, but only two or three or four cups of fair water at a
time, and once of (...) a little broth, (and casting it up again, unable to
keep it,) and taking this also only once in two days, or in three days or
more, between the times of her taking thereof, never taking it two days
together: And yet she looks better now, then she did seven or eight weeks
ago.] Desiring water, she said, Give me a little water good people; Christ
has given you water freely. Then she drank her little white cup full once,
and again: and said, I pray you give me some more: Jesus Christ when he turned
water into wine, be turned not cups full, or glasses full; but sirkins sull
Joh. 2. 6.
. If you give a cup of cold water as to a Disciple, you shall not loose your
reward Mat. 10.42.
. Then she drank two cups more: and proceeded thus in the same tenderhearted
manner. As I live says the Lord, I will not the death of a sinner. He has
sworn it; he has sworn it, that he delights not in the death of a sinner Ezec.
33. 11.
. He has said, I Will never leave thee, no, I Will never forsake thee, no Heb. 13.5.
(...)
. [Thus she added the Emphasis, No; that is more in the Greek, then in our
Translation: though she be no Grecian:] and then added: What am I? a poor,
empty, disconsolate, sinful, vain, contemptible worm: a poor, wretched,
empty, unthankful, sinful, vile, contemptible worm, to tread upon. Yet has
Jesus Christ loved me. That, that I admire most, is, that Jesus Christ should
dye for such a one Romans 5.6-8, 9.
.

Then being sensible of her bodily illness, having kept her bed since April 6.
She said: I am sore from the crown of the head, to the foot; but it is nothing,
it is nothing. When Jesus Christ was in the world, he cured bodies, and not
bodies only, but souls too.

Then turning her self in the bed, she said: Now I have my desire; I desired
nothing but a crucified Christ, and I have him. I desired nothing but a
crucified Christ, and I have him; a crucified Christ, a naked Christ; I have
him, and nothing else. I am sore all over; I can neither hear, nor see; I
desired him so, and I have him so, and I have nothing else. And said, We should
be as well content to bear he cross of Christ, as the crown Gal. 6. 14. Act.
2^. 24.
. For he was made perfect by suffering Heb. 2. 10.
, and he had no sin: it was for us Therefore we should be contented to bear
the Cross 1 Pet. 2. 21, 22.


Hah, Had I known this, I would not have been in such a condition as I was,
(meaning it seems, in murmuring, and not waiting patiently the Lords time:) But
Gods time is the best time, to reveal himself, and to open mine eyes to see,
and mine ears to hear; and he gives power to wait.

Was I afraid to name the Devil? Nothing but free Grace, makes the difference
between me and the Devil. All Is free, mercy free, and goodness free, and love
free. The Lord proclaimed his own Name, he called himself, Gracious, Merciful,
Long-suffering Exodus 34. 6.
.

Ah, how sick am I at the heart! what a stitch I have. Soon after she said; I
thank you for giving me the water, Jesus Christ has given you water. He has
given you, and he will give you more.

She said also; God has two thrones: one is in the highest Heavens; the other
is in the lowest hearts. He dwells as truly in the lowest hearts, as in the
highest Heavens; in the poorest contemptible heart Isa. 66. 2.
. When Solomon built a Temple, he said; The Heavens of Heavens cannot contein
thee: and how shall this house that I have built 1 King. 8. 27.
? But God builds a house for himself to dwell in: and he dwells in it, for
ever, for ever, for ever. Do not you know, that God has two Thrones? The
highest Heavens, and the lowest hearts! Happy is that people that is in such a
case, whose God is the Lord, whose joy is their strength Psalm. 144. 15.
. And so saying, she smiled, her eyes being still fast closed. So she lay
still, and was not heard to speak any more, from that Tuesday till Thursday
following.

Thursday, April 15. 1647.

This day, about 7 of the clock in the morning, she began thus: Daniel in the
Lions den; the three children in the siery farnace Dan. 6. end: Dan. 3.26, 28.
; the Lord delivered them, and so he does me. Then calling for water to drink,
she said again, (as formerly,) Christ has given you water to drink freely:
give me water freely: so she drank three or four times her little cup full of
water. And she still remaining deaf, and with her eyes fast closed up, she
said; Have not I a Mother some where? I pray you pray her to pardon me, the
murmurings against her. For nothing else troubles me. God has pardoned. Has
the Creator pardoned, and shall not the Creature? Thus speaking, the tears ran
fast down her checks for a great while: and she said; When the prodigal came
home, his earthly father pardoned him Luke 15. 20. 32.
, and his heavenly Father pardoned him. And will not my Mother pardon me? If
she should, its not that, will do me good. If she will not, it lies heavy
upon me. But God has pardoned me.

[Another time, when many were present, she said thus, with tears trickling
down; If any did know, what it is to murmr against a God, and against a
Parent, and felt for it what I have felt; they would never do it. Nothing more
burdens me, then my murmurings and disobedience against my Mother. This she
spoke, weeping. [What a warning is this to all children, that have murmured or
been disobedient against father or mother, to repent in time, and seek pardon,
and mercy for help against it; least it be as heavy a burden to them, when
they are in trouble, as it has been to this handmaid, (and to diverse others,)
Yet she said, her disobedience was not wilful, but she was hurried to it, in
the violence of temptation.]

Then she desired her mother might come to her, to testify that she had
pardoned her: yet could she then neither hear nor see: but said, I know a
Jacob from an Esau. Her mother came to her, and took her daughters hand, and
put it to her own neck, where her daughter felt a skare that was there, through
the enemy: whereby her daughter knowing her, cast her head into her mothers
bosom, and wept greatly, and kissed her, and stroaked her face, and said, I
know you mother; and I love you with another love then I loved you before.

Then she asked for water, to wash her EYES, desiring she might now see her
Mother also, and that she might hear her mother speak, and tell her, that
she had pardoned her disobedience. And water being brought, her eyes were
washed: and they being still fast folded up, Mris Dupper her neighbor in
Lawrence Pountney-lane, held open her eyes, and she saw and knew her mother:
and then immediately her EARS also were opened, that she might hear her
mother speak to her, and she testified to her, that she had pardoned her,
and loved her as her own soul. And then, her heart was at rest, she was
satisfied: Her bearing then continued about half an hour, viz. till she
ceased then to speak, and then it was again taken from her; and her eyes were
presently closed up again. In this time of her hearing, her mother told her,
that her Brother was come, viz. Mr Jonathan Vaughan; (her mothers son by her
former husband;) [ Who being then a Student of Alsoules College in Oxford,
having remained there several years; was now come to London, to see his
Mother, and Sister, and other friends, and was to return thither again shortly.
From thence he had lately writ a Consolatory Letter to his Sister, expressing
his confidence, that Jesus Christ, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, both could,
and would deliver her, etc. Of which, her Mother also was persuaded, and waited
for: by which the Lord the more enabled her to bear this sad affliction, that
bad so long continued.]

She was glad to hear of her Brother, that had mourned and prayed for her,
that he was now come at such a time: and she desired to see and hear him; But
at that time, he was abroad. And before he came, she had ceased speaking, and
then remained without speaking, or drinking, and without sight or hearing,
these being again taken from her from that 15. til the 17th of April. On the
same 15. day, she asked if her Brother, or the maid would go to Mr Simpson,
to desire him to come to her. When he came, she had done speaking; and seemed
to be in a trance, and would not speak again, till her time came.

On the same 15th day, before she ceased, she further said: I thought I was
the bad thief; but now I see, I am as the good thief. I was really crucified
with Christ Gal. 2.20.
; though I was not in the appearance of any bodily eye, but as I was in the
loins of Adam when he sinned Romans 5.12. Heb. 7.9. 16.
. I was the nails in his hands and in his feet; and the spear in his side
Isa. 53. 5.
. The maid desired her to eat something: she answered, I cannot; I am full.

Again, she said; How old am I? [Her Mother says, she shall be sixteen year
old in September next, 1647. She went on in her speech thus.] Thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen: so long I have been a filthy sinner. Now I have
been four days in the grave, with Lazarus Joh. 11.39.
: (she having been four years in deep despair:) and now I am risen Col. 3. 1.
, to live with Jesus Christ, for ever, in glory. He led Captivity Captive, and
received gifts for men; even for the Rebellions Psalm. 68. 18.
. He came to the poor Publican, that could but speak one word: not to the
proud Pharisee, that used many words Luke 18. 13.
. Jesus Christ said, The Cup that my heavenly Father gives me to drink, shall I
not drink it Joh. 18. 11.
? He drank the dregs, the very dregs; and he had no sin; and shall the Saints
think much to sip of the Cup, when he drank of it before us? The yoke of Christ
is easy, and his burden is light; but the yoke of sin is heavy, and wrath is
heavy. Mat. 11. 28.
The yoke of Christ is easy, because Christ helps them to hear it himself,
and that makes it easy, The Saints showed have no sufferings, if it were not
for their good Romans 8. 28. 31.
; else they should have no sufferings at all.

Christ comes leaping over the mountains, and skipping over the hills! There Is
nothing in the soul, but mountains of sin, and hills Luke 3. 5.
of corruption: he does not come running, nor walking, but leaping and
skipping, to a poor Hos. 2. 14.
bewildred soul: not to a garden ready trimmed he trims it for himself, to
abide in, for ever, for ever. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and
just to forgive us 1 John 1. 9.
. One confession, and two things to that, Faithful and just. He Will give water
of life to them that thirst Rev. 22. 17.
. Not only water, but water of life. He hides himself, that we may seek the
more earnestly after him Hos. 5. last.
, and that he may reveal himself more fully. I that was an enemy, am made an
heir with Christ, to live in glory, for ever, for ever. Christ is my Brother,
my elder Brother Mar. 3. 35.
.

How sweet are the Teachings of the Spirit to my soul! Sweeter then the
Teachings of men and Angels: They may speak much to the ear, and that is well:
but they could not say to my soul, Thy sins are pardoned, and Christ Jesus
loves thee.

These and more heavenly expressions she uttered in a humble gracious manner
that same 15th day. The relating of them thus brokenly, cannot so affect the
heart, as to have heard her self so tender-heartedly speak them. For this half
hour or more of her now speaking, the Lord restored her hearing, wherein she
both saw and heard her Mother, as two days following she saw and heard her
Brother also, whom she longed to see and hear, and was satisfied. And having
thus spoken what she desired then to say, she ceased, and rested. And then
both her sight, and her hearing were again taken from her. She abiding as
asleep, but it seems slept little, but in that resting time, much enjoying
communion with Jesus Christ, her souls rest. So was she silent from that
morning April 15. till the morning of the 17th day. The night following April
16. she was very sick laboring for breath, as if she would have dyed.

April 17. being the last day in the week in the morning, she asked for water.
A little being given her to drink, she said; Give me it freely: Christ has
given me Faith freely, and love freely, and joy in himself. And having drunk
again, she proceeded thus.

We love him, because he loved us first 1 John 4. 19.
: We rejoice in him, because he rejoiced in us first: We desire him, because
he desired us first. I could not believe that I should be saved: but now, if
men and Devils stood there, before my eyes, and should tell me, I should not be
saved; I would not believe them. I see him that is invisible; and look on him,
whom I have pierced, and I mourn over him. Do not you love him? if you see
him, as I see him, you would admire him. A sight of him would satisfy Nations.
A sparkle of him, is more glorious then the world Phil. 3. 8. Mat. 17. 2.
.

This day she asked again for Mr Simpson, and for Mr Iessey. She answered
her self, thus; I cannot hear, and why do I ask a Question. After this,
she remembering her Mother had told her that her Brother was come, she spoke
of her Joseph, [for so she called him,] and now she was desirous to see him.
And said; Mine eyes have seen my heavenly Joseph, and why shall I not see my
earthly Joseph? The Lord has opened my spiritual eyes, and why should I not
believe, that he will open my bodily eyes? And she called for water to wash
her eyes: and having washed her eyes, her brother being present by her, she
saw him, and took him by the hand, and pulled him, and told him of the greatness
of the love of Christ, saying, Why came he from the bosom of the Father; but
to die for sinners? the chief of sinners: and that makes the Grace great.

She then told him, what condition she had been in, thus (in a sweet humble
manner;) I was at the very brink of Hell; and Jesus Christ pulled me out. And how
can I but love him? He came for the disobedient, and unholy, and unthankful:
and for murmurers, as I have been Mat. 9. 13.
. If any one see and feel what I have seen and felt, they would take heed of
murmuring against God and a Parent. You never murmured so much against God, and
against my Mother, as I have done; Ah, ah, ah, sighing and weeping as she
spoke. But I speak the rather, (said she) that none should despair: because
I have found mercy 1 Timothy 13-16.
.

I am not able to express how sweet that word is; Behold, O daughter of
Jerusalem, thy King, Hab, (smiling at that word,) thy King comes, meek, meek,
comes meek; riding on an Ass Mat. 21.5
; even on a Colt the foal of an Ass Job 11.12.
: not on a horse ready trimmed: He comes to a wild Asses colt; to one
unaccustomed to the yoke, as Ephraim was Jer. 31. 19, 20.
. Yet Ephraim was a dear son, a pleasant child. They cast their cloths on the
Ass: He cast his skirt over me: not a skanty skirt: a skirt that covered all
my filthiness. My beloved is mine, and I am my beloveds. As an Appletree is
among the Trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons Cant. 2. 3.
. What a pleasant thing is an Appletree, among the Trees of the wood? There Is
both Protection, and Provision: there is Protection from the beat, under his
shadow: and his fruit was sweet to me; there is Provision. Christ is protection,
a shelter: a shelter from the storm Isa. 4.6.
. Christ keeps his Church himself. Men put others in their Garrisons: but
Christ keeps his Church, his own self Psalm. 121. 4, 5.
. I that was a far off, far off from peace, am made nigh, by the blood of the
Cross Ephesians. 2. 13.
.

Her brother spoke aloud to her, to take somewhat to refresh her body. She
then heard him, and answered, I cannot; I have what I did desire; I have a
crucified Christ: I am so full of the Creator, that I now can take in none of
the Creature. I am filled with heavenly Manna Joh. 6. 33-35.
: I am sore from the crown of the head, to the sole of the foot. But let the
Lord do what be will with me: let him take me to his eternal rest, I am
content: or leave me in this veil of misery, I am content Phil. 4. 11.
. Thou art a free agent: Thou workest when thou will, and where thou will.

She said moreover: Let the Lord do with me what he will: if he throws me
into hell, I Will be contented; because I have deserved it Ezr. 9. 13.
. But his mercy will save me in the day of wrath 1 These. 1. 10. Ephesians. 2. 3. 5.
.

There Is no sin separates the soul from Christ, but the sin of Unbelief Joh.
5. 40.
. And this is all the Faith I look after, believing a full Christ, to a nothing
Creature: a full Christ to a nothing Creature Joh. 7. 37.
. Nothing makes a difference between me, and the Devil, but free Grace, free
Grace Ephesians. 2. 1-8.
. He has not forgot to be gracious: he has not forgot to be merciful, though
I often said, he had: He has not forgotten to be gracious, though I said, he
had Isa. 49. 14, 15.
. She prayed for her beloved Joseph, her brother, to this effect. Blessed be
Joseph of the Lord. The good will of him that dwelt in the bush, be on the head
of Joseph, and on the top of the head of him, that was separated from his
Brethren Deuteronomy. 33.16.
.

She asked for the same persons that she had named before; and said; They
have sought the Lord for me, desire them to praise and magnify the Lord with
me. When these came, she had ceased speaking, and then she lay still without
speaking, or drinking, till the 19th day: having not eaten any thing at all
since the 27th of March, nor drunk any thing at all, but two or three of her
little cups of fair water, and that only at once in two or three days, as is
beforesaid.

April 19. She put her finger to her mouth, desiring water. And one cup was
given her; then she began, thus: God is a refuge and a shield, from the
storms and tempests: He has avenged me on my adversary, (meaning, the
Devil,) that thought to be avenged on me: and I thought he would: but the Lord
has avenged me on him. Shall the unrighteous Judge do justly, [meaning, in
avenging the widow on her adversary:] and shall not the righteous Judge do
justly? Yea a thousand times more Luke 18. 6, 7.
. Happy, happy, happy is the people that have the God of Jacob for their
Excellency, and whose strength is in the Lord Psalm. 144 15.
. Behold, the Lord will come with a strong band: He shall feed the flock like a
Shepherd: He shall carry his Lambs in his arm Isa. 40. 11, 12.
. I have born thee from the belly, which have carried thee from the womb, even
to thy old age: I am he: and even to hoary hairs will I carry thee, Isa. 46.
3, 4.
I Will wait on him, that hides himself from the house of Jacob Isa. 8. 17.
. He hides himself from the House of Jacob: yet they were his people. Thou art
worth the waiting for, if one should wait from the day of their birth, to the
very day of their death: even one glimpse of thee is worth all. He that walks
in darkness, and sees no light, let him trust on the Name of the Lord, and
stay himself upon his God: his God, though he be in darkness, stay on his God.
[Isa. 50 10.]

Bodily sustenance being offered to her, she not having eaten any thing at all
during twenty-four days last past, nor drunk any thing at all but fair water,
and but very little of that. She thus answered: Do you think, I do not eat?
How do you think I live? Being asked, what she did eat? She said; No eye of
man sees it, but the eye of God. None could taste the sweetness of the Manna,
by looking on it, none but they that eat of it: or of the Honey out of the
Rock. The redeemed of the Lord, are a Royal Priesthood, a chosen Generation.
He has made us Kings and Priests unto God, (1 Pet. 2. 9. Rev. 1.6.) More
precious then Gold, Gold of Ophir. The Lord has avenged me on mine enemy, that
roared over me night and day, to have devoured me; but he has delivered me.
They that know thy Name, will trust in thee, because thou Lord never failest
them that seek thee, (Psalm. 9. 10.) Before she called (meaning her self,) he
answered: whilst she was asking, he heard, and delivered me from all my
fears. She asked again, will not Mr Iessey and Mr Simpson come, to praise
and magnify the Lord with me? they have prayed for me. Then were her ears
opened, that since April 6. had been deaf, except only at that time that she
longed to hear that her Mother had pardoned her, and that she might see and
hear her Brother. For then she being asked, whether she desired to live, she
heard, and said; I am contented with what the Lord will, though I would rather
dye. Being told, Mr Iesse and Mr Simpson desired she might live. Do they?
said she: I must do what the Lord will. The Cup that my Father gives me to
drink, shall I not drink it? Whether to live, or to dye.

Her eyes still being weak, and closed, she asked, whether it was night or no?
it was answered her, it was night. She said; There will be a day when there
will be no night, but the Lord and the Lamb shall be the light, and walk in the
midst of it Rev. 21. 23. 25. 3.
. The Lord has delivered me from my enemy: from the roaring of the Lion, that
roared over me 1 Pet. 5.8.
: the Lord has triumphed over him. And speaking of this, to her mother, she
said: Do you not say, it is well mother? And praise the Lord? He is able to save
to the uttermost, all that come to the Father by him Heb. 7.25.
. You may trust me now Mother, and not be afraid of me, (meaning, of hurting
her self with knife, or water, as formerly she often had attempted:) for if no
body look to me, the Lord will keep me. And the good Samaritan that healed my
soul Luke 10.33.
, will heal my body too.

To Hannah Guy that looked to her, and watched with her, she said; The Lord
will reward all your labor of love. So she lay down and spoke no more till
the next day at night.

April 20. at night, there being diverse neighbors and loving friends come
together to see her, Mris Collet, Mris Caron, Mris Dupper, the Relator, and
diverse others, about twelve or more, which greatly desired to hear her speak,
being greatly refreshed with what they had heard of her expressions, (the Lord
having been praised in her behalf, both in that Parish, and in Ab-Church their
neighbour-Parish, and els-where, where prayers had been put up in her behalf;)
she now lying still, and had not spoken two days together since April 6.

These desiring if the will of God were so, that they might hear her self
speak: she lying with a linen cloth over her eyes, which were very weak; the
maid told her, Mr Iessey was there; (he being in the company, near to her,) she
then began to speak to him, and said; O magnify the Lord with me, for he has
delivered me from all my fears: not from one, but from all my fears Psalm.
34.4.
This she spoke, as all that follows, with a low voice, in a humble, modest,
melting manner, her tears sometimes stopping her speech. He and the rest,
listened, and were greatly affected in hearing her. It cannot affect so much in
hearing it at second hand, as if you had heard her self, with such brokennes
of heart uttering it. She proceeded on thus, (which presently was writ down:)
He has regarded the low estate, Luke 1.48.
the base Luke 1.48.
estate of his handmaid. I rejoice in him. I mourn over him, whom I have
pierced Zach. 12. 10.
. It was not Judas or Soldiers so much, as I that pierced him. I thought I was
the bad Thief: but he has said to me as to the good Thief Luke 23.43,
. Thou shall be with me in Paradise. The earthly Paradise, was a Type of the
Heavenly Paradise. That was fading and lost; but this endures for ever.

O praise the Lord with me, for he has heard me, and looked on me, the vilest
of sinners, the worst, the chiefest of sinners: On me, that was rebellious,
disobedient, unthankful, unholy; a murmurer, as much as ever the children of
Israel in the wilderness, (the tears often trickling down, and she stopping,
through her weeping,) and their murmuring kept them out of Canaan 1 Cor. 10.10.
, but though I have so murmured, he has saved me. I was at the very pits
brink, at the very brink of hell: and the Lord fetched me out. And is not he
worthy of praise? The Lamb is worthy to open the Book. For none in Heaven nor
earth, neither men nor Angels, could open these brazen gates, this iron door,
this hard heart of mine, but he. [putting her hand to her own breast.] When I
confessed my sin, he forgave me the punishment. I could never confess my sin,
til now that he made known his mercy to me; though I sought it diligently to
confess it. Being asked when was this that see confessed her sin? She said, Now
since I saw his mercy. And now he has made known to me his mercy. Nothing but
the sense of his mercy, could ever bring me to confess my sin Luke 15.18.
indeed, I would feign have got comfort by mine own workings, my own doings, or
from a Creature, and I spoke to men: but I never could get comfort by the
creature, but the Lord himself did it. I could not love him, till he made
known his love to me 1 John 4.19.
: to me, the chiefest of sinners. If all the sins in all the world, were in one
party, I thought it was all nothing to mine. I could not find any in all the
Scriptures that obtained mercy, that was in my case. Yes he has showed mercy
to me, the chiefest of sinners 1 Timothy 1.15.
. O, that he should come from the bosom of the Father, to dye for sinners! for
me, the chiefest of sinners. If all the men in the world should have told me,
that Christ dyed for me; that my sins were pardoned, I could not have believed
them. But now, if all the men in the world, and Angels and Devils, should tell
me they are not forgiven, I would not believe them.

What pains did I take in going to men, to have them speak comfort to me, and
they could not do it. But Christ did it in a moment. They that know his Name,
will trust in him: they cannot but trust in him Psalm. 9.10.
. If the world knew him, they could not but love him. He is the chiefest of ten
thousands Can. 5.10.
. He is more to be desired in his lowest estate, then millions of worlds, if
millions of worlds were all in one.

Behold, O daughter of Jerusalem: Thy King comes meek, that he might teach his
people meekness. He came on an Asses Colt: not on a horse finely trimmed; to an
untamed heiser, unaccustomed to the yoke; ( to me, that was ungodly,
unprepared) to Ephraim, that was as a wild Asses colt. Surely, after I was
turned, I repented Jer. 31. 18, 19.
. I could not turn to him, nor love him, till he showed his love to me, and
turned me.

Praise the Lord with me, that has showed mercy on one in so desperate a case
as I was in. I could set nothing before me, but curse, and hell, and wrath,
night and day. O that others may be are what God has done for such a one, (Ps.
66.16.) I would none may DESPAIR of Gods mercy, that has done thus for me. If
any did know what it is to murmr against God, and against a Parent, as I have
done, and felt what I have felt, they would never do it. (A like warning is
page 24.)

The Relator having heard she now had not eaten any thing at all for
twenty-foure days or more, and drunk nothing in all this time since April 6.
but only fair water; neither that, but two or three little cups together,
once in two or three days. He desired her, if she could, to eat, to preserve
life: for when the Lord says, Thou shall not kill: he implies the Affirmative,
Thou shall use all good means to preserve life. (Jam. 2.11.) And though he,
and all those present, were so affected, even to admiration, in hearing a child
so speak; yet he wished her to forbear speaking too much; because it spent her,
she being so very weak. She said; In rest and returning shall I be saved, in
quietness and confidence shall be my strength Isa. 30. 15.
. I have Manna to eat of, he feeds me with hidden Manna Rev. 2.17.
. It was pleasant to the eye Number. 11. 11.
: but they felt no sweetness, by looking on it, but by tasting of it. When
she ended speech, she desired he would praise the Lord with her; which he
performed accordingly, those beforesaid being present.

[ Another time, when one gave her a Poesy, she looking on it, and smelling
its sweetness, commended the workmanship of God in the several flowers: saying
to this effect; The flowers are all fragrant, and some more fragrant then
others, they have different colors, and different smells: and all come out of
the earth. So are the Saints, they all are in Christ, and in him they all are
sweet and savoury: but are of different strength, and judgment. The strong
should bear with the weak, and not despise them.]

April 25. being the Lords day, when many Christians were come to see her,
amongst others, Mr and Mris Liggon, the Relator, Mris Jones, Mris Aires, Mris
Gr. Philips, and others.

In like humble manner, her tender eyes being covered, and lying still, (as
she had kept her bed, being very weak, since April 6.) with a low voice, as
speaking to her self, she said: How sweet is it to my thoughts, that an
infinite God, should be a Rock and a Refuge to a finite Creature! a sure Rock
and hiding place from all storms and tempests whatsoever, Ps. 46. 1.

When the man was wounded by thieves, and lay by the way; the Priest and the
Levite passed by: they passed by and helped not: The creature comfort fails:
and then the good Samaritan helps Luke 10 35.
. Christ saves, whom none else will or can: and when there is nothing in the
Creature to move him. The wounded man did not first desire the Samaritans help.
The deeper the wound is, the more honor to him that cures him. He set him on
his own Beast, leaves him not to himself, to go where he will: but brought
him in, and gave two pence for him. I believe that holds out Faith and Love
Gal. 5.6.
. None cared for him, refuge failed, then Christ helps, and take care for him
Ps 27.10.
.

One speaking to her of her former condition, how far she was then from hope
ever to obtain mercy, she said; If all the world should be saved, then it may
be, I should be one; but else no hopes for me. That Peter, Mary Magdalen, David,
Manasses were saved; it was nothing to me: no, if Judas should be saved, yet
should not I. All their sin, and Paul's in Persecuting, and the Thief on the
Cross, and Judas, and all I could read of, or hear of, if all their sins were
all put together in one; yet all were not so bad as I. Yet I obtained mercy,
that thought my time of mercy was past, and that I was damned already through
unbelief. I said many a time, There Is no hope in thy end: and I thought I saw
it. I may say, It was good for me to be afflicted, I prize his mercies the
more. (Psalm. 119. 69.) All terrors could not humble me; but the sight of his
mercy did. I could never be kindly humbled till then. It was not mine own
fitting, or mine own humbling, but Christ's fitting, and Christ's humbling; when
he looks upon such a one; that humbles. He comes with his power on the soul,
and causes the soul to believe. (Ephesians. 1. 19.)

My tongue was not able to tell the misery I was in before continually: and now
my tongue is not able to tell what love and mercy has been showed to me, I can
never enough express his Name. I would feign have been dissolved, to be with
him Phil. 1. 23.
. It was a hard thing for me to be content to live here still: but its easy
for him to teach, to be willing to live or dye: and he has taught me Phil. 4.
11. 13.
.

I was so desperate, I cared not what became of me: often was I at very brink of
death and hell: even at the very gates, and they were open for me; and then
Christ shut them, and fetched me out: as Daniel that was in the Lions den, but
it was his mercy that stopped the mouth of the roaring Lion, and delivered me.
(Dan. 6.)

The hundredth and seventh Psalm; O that men would therefore praise the Lord
for his goodness, and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men.
I would that Psalm were often read over. The goodness of God is unsearchable.
How great is the excellency of his Majesty; that yet he would look upon such a
one as I! I was full of Terror the week before I kept my bed: I rested not day
nor night. I thought no death was bad enough for me. If all kinds of death were
put together in one, it was too good for me. I walked continually as in fire
and brimstone, for rebelling and murmuring against God, and against a Parent.

When he hides his face, who is able to bear it? and when he gives quietness,
who then can trouble? [ Job 34.29.] I can testify the truth of both these. He
has spoke the word to me, Thy sins are forgiven thee; I even I am he that
blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, Isa. 43. 25. Jesus Christ is
unchangeable, therefore I was not consumed. We may say with admiration, What
is man, that thou art so mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou so
regardest him? thou made him lower then Angels Ps. 8. is meant of Christ; as
Heb. 2.6. to 18 verse. proves.
. Jesus Christ took our nature, to take part of our sufferings; and that we
should follow him in sufferings, and not think strange. We have not a High
Priest, that cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities Heb. 2.17, 18.
and Heb. 4.15.
, but he was made like to us, that he might sympathize with us, Bless the
Lord, O my soul! Which forgiveth all thine iniquity; and heals all thine
infirmity. In my misery my flesh and my bones pined, and consumed away, and I
was near to death. [the Lords chearing the heart does good like a medicine:] I
now recover, strength. I read the Scriptures from a child: but I understood
not what I read till now, that I had the Teaching of the Spirit.

He is worth the waiting for him. There is a blessing pronounced to such,
Blessed are all that wait for him. I did not wait patiently for him. I was
weary, and could wait no longer. But he is not weary: He fails not. He lets
the Creature go his way for a time, for his own good, to humble him more, and
show his mercy the more. He has him in a chain, and the enemy in a chain. So
he has the soul, to dispose of it. (My times are in thy hands:) that he might
magnify mercy indeed, and free love indeed. No soul ever was as I have been:
I am sure of it. If all the sins of all sinners that I read of, or heard talk
of, were in one, it were all short of me. And yet it is his goodness that such a
one as I, should obtain mercy. I wish all may take heed of The like
expressions were by H.T. another in London, in sickness, July 1. 1646.
censuring the vilest creatures that are, seeing the Lord has done thus for me
the vildest Creature: but pity them with tears of blood.

One asked her, how long it was since her hearing was restored to her? She
answered, A few days ago, I asked if Mr Simson and Mr Jesse would come to
praise the Lord with me? and I found it was restored at that instant.

Part of a former Conference between her, and another young Gentlewoman, Mris
A. whilst both were in despair. They met in Lawrence Pountney, to hear the
Lecture, before it began, Mris Sarah saw one walk about and about in a sad
habit, and went to her, and asked her how she did, she answered; In as sad a
condition as ever was any.

Mris Sarah, None is in a Condition like to mine. So they sat together; and
after that, they went together, and spoke further of their sad conditions: each
counting their own state the worse.

Another day, Mris A. said, The Lord knows, that knows all things, that I would
rather then all the world, that I were in your condition.

Mris Sarah W. answ. But if you knew, how desperate my condition is, you would
be afraid to change place with me, for you know not my sad sorrows. None in the
world can compare with mine. Except you would desire to be in hell, you would
not desire to be in my condition.


Mris A. I must be damned.


Mris S. I am damned already, from all eternity, to all eternity: its not to
do, but it is done already.


Mris A. I was a great professor, but I was but an hypocrite, and an hypocrites
hope shall perish.


Mris S. I have bin an hypocrite, a revolter, a backslider.


Mris A. I know it shall be well with you.


Mris S. As well as it was with Judas, who repented, and hanged himself: which
I must do, before I shall be free from these torments.


At their parting, for a farewell, Mris A. said, I think I shall perish ere I
see you again.

Yet the Lord spared her, and she came to her again: and they were somewhat
gladded to see each other again, that could be sensible, each of the others
condition.

To sadded souls, some joy it is, to have companions.

She had another Conference, April 24. 1647. since she was comforted, with
another Maid being in deep despair, that had heard of her former despair, and
her late comforts. The words were to this effect.

Maid. I am darkened in understanding, and I am tempted to believe there is no
God, nor no Creation from God.


Mris Sarah W. ans. So was it with me, I was so tempted: The very Creation
shows there is a God Romans 1. 19, 20.
, and yet I could not believe it.


Maid said: Some kept a fast for me yesterday, and I remain as I was still, and
therefore I am the more terrified, that no prayers shall be heard for me.


Mris Sarah W. So was it with me; I was so terrified when there was no answer
of prayers for me, when in my days were kept for me: But I was rather worse
then better. For I knew no prayers should be heard for a damned Creature. I
concluded, I was rejected. But the Lords time is the best time to give an
answer Psalm. 88. 9. 16.
.


Maid. I have resisted the Spirit. The Lord has spoken mercy to me, but I have
resisted it.


Mris Sarah W. The day of Sealing was not come: then you could not resist that
work when he comes with power Psalm. 110. 3.
: else you would make God weaker then you. God would bring you this way about,
and hides himself, when you have grieved the Spirit, that you may seek him the
more earnestly: and that he may give you the surer comforts; and to make
himself a glorious Name: as in Isa. 63. 10, 11. They rebelled, and vexed his
holy Spirit, therefore he fought against them, as an enemy. Then he remembered
the days of old, when he led them by the right hand of Moses, dividing the
water before them, to make himself an everlasting Name. That led them through
the deep. So through the deepest troubles, till the Spirit of the Lord causes
them to rest, to make himself a glorious Name. Though you have rebeld, and
vexed his holy Spirit, what could you do more? yet says he, I have carried
thee all the days of old. I Will be your guide even to death.


Maid. Its not possible that such a one as I, should find mercy: I look every
moment, to be swallowed up.


Mris Sarah W. But Gods thoughts are not your thoughts, nor Gods ways, your
ways Isa. 55. 8.
. In the Wilderness Israel murmured, yet the Rock followed them, not they the
Rock, but went from the Rock, yet the Rock followed them; and that Rock is
Christ 1 Cor. 10. 4.
. So this Rock will follow you in this your Wilderness.


Maid. Its not possible; I find such a wicked heart, that if it were not for
fear of wrath or punishment, I should fall into all wickedness.


Mris Sarah W. Now you show you believe there is a God. You are not worse then
Peter that so denied and forswore him, against his Conscience Mar. 14. 71.
: or then Mary Magdalen, that had seven Devils, was full of the Devil Chap.
16. 9.
. The Thief on the Cross, Persecuting Paul, that persecuted Christ, and my
self, was so injurious and blasphemous -- The chief of sinners, yet these
found mercy. And what can you be more? You can be but a sinner, and the chief
of sinners. He dyed for such. He is therefore called Jesus, because he shall save
his people from their sins. What people? those that were not a people, these
he calls, and these he saves.


Maid. I am no better for going to the means: and am ready to neglect all.


Mris Sarah W. I was so terrified, I was not able to go to the means: and
then I was terrified for not going to them. I had no rest in either. If I went,
salvation was turned into condemnation to me. If I went not, it was death; I
was on the Rack.


Maid. None can be in a worse condition then I; full of fears.


Mris Sarah W. Of late my case was so, that if one had been all day burning in
fire, they could not have been in a worse condition.


Maid. I am in such extremities of late, I am even almost spent, and have
nothing to relieve me by.


Mris Sarah W. So it was with me of late. When you are at the lowest, Christ
is readiest to restore soul and body. If you see your self nothing; and see
all fullness in Christ, you are the nearest to comfort Mat. 18. 19.
. The Lord has done as much for me, as ever for any: as much as for the man
that had the Legion of Devils in him: he was clothed, and in his right mind;
he has clothed me, and put me in my right mind, and set me at his feet Mar.
5. 15.
. God does away our sins, as a thick cloud, but it wants manifesting to your
soul. His time is the best time, therefore wait for him.


Maid. I am an ungracious creature: I cannot wait any longer.


Mris Sarah W. But the Lord waits on you. You think you are ungracious: and he
waits to be gracious to such as you. There Is as much of the power of the Lord
seen in upholding a soul in such a condition, as in delivering it.


Maid. I am utterly lost.


Mris Sarah W. Not in his account: you must be lost in your self, that you may
be found in him: He came to seek and to save that was lost Luke 19. 10.
.


Thus she endeavored the comforting another, with the Consolations wherewith
she was comforted: yet the poor soul went sad away. And she being much
affected with the others sad condition, pitying her, after she was gone away;
she desired some that came to see her, to pray for that maid.

After this, came another woman to her, being also in deep despair; having
heard of her former despair, and present comforts: and complained to her of her
sad condition. To whom she gave such succouring Answers for upholding and
refreshing her weary soul, as she had done to the former: speaking to her,
till she was very much spent.

Another that came to see her, having heard her so manifest her fulness of joy
and content in God, in such high streines: Told her, she must expect a change,
and had need to lay up in store, against times to come. She answered, thus;
Sarah W. If I should look to take out of my store, I should quickly be a
Bankrupt, a Prodigal, and spend it quickly. But Christ has in store for me.
All my fresh Psalm. 87. 7.
. Springs are in him.

May 2. being the Lords day: Many that had heard what the Lord had done for her
soul, came to see her, and heard her in a humble sort, with a low voice,
(being very weak in body) magnify the Lord and his Grace to her soul. To one
then, she said as follows, (which was presently writ.) O magnify the Lord
in my behalf, that daily compasses me about with songs of deliverance. I
could not endure, but that I see him that is invisible. I could not see him, but
that he saw me first, and gave me faith. He loved me, and washed me in his
blood, (Rev. 1.5.) He loved me before I was washed: and because he loved me,
therefore he washed me.

He was tempted as we are. He had no need to be tempted, but to succor tempted
ones, such poor creatures as I. He takes delight to succor such poor souls.
Its our Fathers good pleasure, to give us a Kingdom. Its his good pleasure, he
delights in giving us a Kingdom. (Romans 8. end) Its neither height nor depth,
neither Principalities, nor powers, nor any other Creature, that shall separate
that soul, that is in union with him. He has bound the soul to himself, with
the cords of love, and there shall be no separation from it.

May 3. In the morning, one having spoken to her, she thus answered: I am not
only filled with the Spirit, but, if one may say it, drunk with the Spirit: it
overcomes me. [Alluding, it seems, to Ephesians. 5. 18. Be not drunk with wine, --
but be filled with the Spirit; or to Act. 2. 15-17. These are not drunk -- but
the Spirit is powered out upon them.]

One said to her, Your enjoyments are more then of many Saints, if theirs were
put together in one.

She answered; My sufferings have been more then of many. Christ is faithful
in all he has spoken: he will not fail in one promise. He says, as our
sufferings abound, so our Consolations abound 2 Cor. 1. 5.
. There Is many Saints have lived threescore years, that have not suffered so
much as I have done in one month. The Lord was my Shield at my right hand,
therefore no hurt could come unto me. Christ is in me, the hope of glory Col.
1. 27.
,

The God of peace shall tread Satan under our feet shortly Romans 16.23.
. He shall do it, he has done it: I see it done. Though he was strong that
possessed this house, a stronger then he has dispossessed him, and possessed
it himself Luke 11. 21.
, None could do it but himself: it was too hard for men or Angels. I am
silent at the Goodness of God. If I had the tongue of men and Angels, I could
not tell the terrors formerly, nor my present enjoyments.

Many strangers (good and bad) came to see her, amongst others, there came one
with Crochets: and when she was silent, vented some, to others present: at the
hearing whereof, she was troubled and sweat; and at last she burst out,
saying: Let them that have received Christ, as the Truth is in Jesus, speak of
nothing, but the freeness of the love of God; and of a full Christ, to a
nothing Creature: and not of whimsies.

May 4. When Mris Langham, Colonel Langhams wife, with some other, came to see
her, and spoke to her, desiring to hear of the dealings of God with her: she
answered, telling her of Gods abundant Goodness to her, to this effect:

Jesus Christ found me, and loved me, before I could love him. He came to me,
in the most disconsolate condition that ever soul was in. When I must either
be delivered, or be destroyed, I could abide no longer; then Christ came.
Christ is my life, and my life is hid with Christ in God Col. 3.3. 1 John 3. 2.
. And when Christ shall appear, I shall appear with him in Glory, How
admirable is it, that he should dye, to give me life! He is to be admired in
his Saints. He came to give Faith to a faithless soul; and to soften hard and
unbeleeving hearts. He brought such as were aliens and enemies Col. 1. 21.
, to be near in himself: and is not this to be admired?

He first finds the soul, and then the Spouse says, She had found him whom
her soul loves. He destroys self; righteous self, and all self, that he
alone might have the glory. He leaves nothing for the Creature to boast in. Its
his Wisdom, that he alone might have the Glory. Turn thou me, and I shall be
turned; Heal me, and I shall be healed; Convert me, and I shall be converted;
So many soul has found by experience.

One told her, Its said; Ezekiel. 18. 31, 32.
Turn ye, why will ye dye, O house of Israel?

She answered; Its Christ that comes with a power in the Word, and turns
them. And the Church knew her own unsufficiency to return, and therefore she
says; Turn me, and I shall be turned Jer. 31. 18.
. Behold, he comes leaping over the mountains, and skipping over the hills. He
makes rough places plain; and raises up valleys Luke 3. 3.
. Its easy for him to pardon mountainous sins, multitudes of sins, as one sin.
He came to me, and pardoned me, though my sins were as the stars in Heaven for
multitude. He has delivered me, from the hard bondage, wherein I was made to
serve. He appeared to me in the dark and thick Cloud, a thick Cloud indeed; One
beam of the Sun of righteousness, dispeld it in a moment. What a sinful
creature was I? I never read of any that was in so desperate a condition as I:
And he has delivered me, from all my fears: not from one or two, but from all
my fears. Therefore I desire high and low, rich and poor, to magnify the
Lord, and to praise his Name in my behalf: that he has looked on the low and
base estate of his handmaid. His works praise him; his Saints bless him, (Ps.
145. 10.) Especially the work of the New Creation in the soul. I could believe
nothing before, but that there was no Hell but in this life: I had no rest; no
rest in hearing, nor reading, -- and then he made me rest on himself Mat.
11.28.
.

And though I was weary and faint, He was neither weary nor faint: His wrath is
but for a moment: but of his goodness and mercy, there is no end. He lays the
foundation, and he builds up. Its I the Lord do all. He bare me, and carried
me, and did at last deliver me. This Rock followed me, though I was not aware
of him. The Sun of righteousness arose, with healing, under his wings, and the
day star arose in my heart 2 Pet. 1. 19.
. It was a dark heart till he arose, and then he made it light. Christ suffered
for me: He needed not to suffer, and be tempted, but to succor such as me
that was tempted Heb. 2. 18.
. I never had rest, till I saw my self crucified with Christ Gal. 2.20.
, and that my sins pierced him: and there came out of his side, a fountain of
blood, for the guilt of sin: and not only so, but a fountain of water, to
wash away the filth of sin: to wash away all my filth. There Is enough in him,
not only to justify, but also to sanctify Joh. 5. 6.
.

The life that I now live, is by the faith of the Son of God, who has loved
me, and given himself for me: though before, I was an unbeleever, and unholy,
and unthankful, and a murmurer, and every way sinful: yet now has he loved
me, and washed me. And it not be to be prized and admired of all his Saints?
And his Name to be had in everlasting remembrance? He proclaimed his Name to be
Merciful, and Gracious, abundant in Goodness, and in Truth; and that to
sinners, to the chief of sinners.

May 4. 1647. The same day at evening, when some came to see her, Mr Iessey,
and Mris Palmer, wife of the late Minister there in Lawrence Pountney, who with
Mr Palmer, had known her soul in affliction. One telling her, Mris Palmer was
glad to hear of Gods goodness to her.

Mris Sarah said: I desire that Mr Palmer, and you, and all Gods people, may
praise and magnify the Lord for his goodness, in looking down on the Lu. 1.48.
(...). so Mat. 23.12.
base estate of his handmaid.


Mris Palmer said: After what manner did your comforts come in to you?


Mris Sarah. My earthly tongue cannot express, what I felt, its beyond
expression. I was in such extremity, that either deliverance must come, or I
must perish, I was able so bold no longer. Then I fell into a Trance. [This was
April 6. at night] I lay in visions. And in that time, the Spirit of God was
powered in upon me. And then Jesus Christ was presented to me, as crucified for
my sins; I saw it; and my self crucified with him: and when I saw a glimpse of
his love, then I mourned bitterly for my sins; and never truly sorrowed for
sin, till then. I never mourned for sin, as sin, before. But then I mourned
bitterly Zach. 12.10.
. And now praise the Lord with me and let us magnify his Name together.


Mris Palmer. Are you nod desirous to enjoy your inheritance?


Mris Sarah. Yes. But Christ has taught me by what I enjoy, to submit to his
will. My terrors so long, were nothing to one moment of mercies. All the
miseries I endured, though they were very great, were nothing to one glimpse of
his mercy.


Mris Palmer. How are your thoughts acted? what are they acted upon?


Mris Sarah. A living active Christ, in a dead passive creature, makes it act
to God Gal. 2. 20.
.


For a farewell, she said; Rejoice in the Lord with me.

Mention was made before, that from the 27th of March, to the 21. of April, in
those 24. days, she had not eaten at all; and her drink had been only two,
or three, or four little cups of fair water, once in two, or three, or in four
days together. Some having spoken of this, others have counted it a forgery,
or pretense: By such injections, the Enemy would obscure and darken the Works
of the Great God of Heaven. But many Godly Ministers and Gracious Saints, that
know Mris Wight, and the Maid, and this Daughter of Abraham; have ground to
judge, they truly fear the Lord: and that they dare not lie, but abhor
lying. Now the Relator by conference with them, has it from their own mouths,
that from the time of her ceasing to be in Trances, and to be deaf and blind,
(which was April 19.) to the day of the writing of this part of the Relation,
being May 5. she has not taken so much sustenance, as she did take in that
time from March 27. to April 19. [And from May 5. till June 11. [being the
longest day in the yeare] less then that from April 19. The power of God
appearing therein wonderfully to the beholders, in upholding her full 75 days
without one crum of bread or meat, and with so little drink;] She not being
able to eat, or to drink more then she did, but against her stomach. When she
by urging, yielded to take somewhat, she could not keep it, but presently
cast it up. She never loved to drink, strong waters, nor strong drink, from
her infancy.

And when the Relator was told, they could not get her to take of a Cordial
that was sent to her from a Lady that had been with her, (as they judged, by
the direction of Dr Debote, or of Dr Worsley, whom the Lady had lately sent to
her:) he persuaded her to take of it, and put it to her mouth: But she said,
She could not: and said that the smell of it made her sick. Which caused him
to forbear further urging of her.

When lately one desired her, if she could to take some sustenance: She
answered:

I would, if I could, but I cannot, it makes me sick to think of it. Jesus
Christ feeds me.

May 2. One asked her, if she would drink. Mris Sarah answered: I cannot: I
have Jesus Christ, I have enough: he feeds me with delights -- He not only
has drops; but he flows in of himself.

She was further urged to take somewhat: Mris Sarah answered: She desired not
to be urged: God has given me food for my soul, when my soul was well nigh
starving for want of food: but God has given me Christ to feed upon: and his
flesh is meat indeed; and his blood drink indeed Joh. 6. 55.
. God has wrought a miracle, in delivering my soul. And if that he has
appointed life, he will give me strength to take in the one, as well as the
other. Now I am worse when I take it.

May 3. When she was wished to drink: Mris Sarah answered; I have wines well
refined, no dregs are in it. Its pure; that is the purity of Christ. He gives me
not cups full; but he has me into his wine-cellar Can. 2.4, 5. Old Transl.
, and fills me with flaggons.

May 4. Mris Palmer desired her, that she would take something to uphold her,
that she might be an instrument of Gods glory, that had done so much for her.

She answered; What ever is for his glory, he will enable me to do it: If it
be his will, that I should continue, he will give me power to take in the
Creature.

May 5. Mris Palmer came again to her, being very desirous to further her to
eat or drink somewhat, to nourish her.

She gave some such answer as is beforesaid.

Mris Palmer said, What promise have you, that any should live without food?


Mris Sarah presently answered, Man lives not by bread only, but by every word
that proceeds out of the mouth of God Mat. 4. 4.
,


Mris Palmer. What Is meant by Word there?


Mris Sarah. I think it is meant of Christ his love and mercy and goodness to
poor sinners: and that's enough for any soul to live upon.


Mris Palmer answered. Its enough for the soul: but how shall the body do?


Mris Sarah. If it be the will of God, that more of his power 2 Cor. 12.9.
shall be seen in sustaining me, with so little: his will is good. [Shee having
said before, that they saw, that when she took somewhat, that it made her
sick.]


Mris Palmer asked her, Do your comforts remain still as clear and fresh, as
at first?


Mris Sarah answered. Yes; I have a standing River, continually to drink of.


Mris Palmer asked, Do you sleep quietly without Dreams?


Mris Sarah answered. I have dreams: and sometimes I dream of the free love
of God toward me. But once or twice I dreamed of the former terrors I was in;
and I trembled exceedingly, and the bed shook under me exceedingly. But I
awaked, and presently all was gone. For he is unchangeable: yesterday, and to
day, and the same for ever Heb. 13.8.
. This was May 5. 1647.


At the former Conference with Mris Palmer, the Relator was present, and then
writ. Both the former and the latter, Mris Palmer her self writ, from whom the
Relator had it: and compared both together.

To another she declared what torments she had undergone for a month
together, before she was forced to keep her bed: (which has been ever since
April 6.) How she walked in terror day and night; what a Hell she had in her
Conscience; and was tempted to believe there was neither God nor Devil,
neither Heaven nor Hell; but what she felt in her Conscience: And therefore if
she were but out of this life, there was an end of all her torments. And hence
she sought to beat out her brains, against the wall, many times: and thereby
was bloody and sweld. And sought to cast her self down from steep places: and
got knives and other things to kill her self withal; but was miraculously
preserved: because the Lord had a favor to her, in her base estate. But then
she thought, If Christ should come in to her, it was as if he should go into
a dunghill, into a carraine. That she was tempted to blaspheme God, and had
much ado to keep it in: especially the last day of her souls affliction.
Wherein she was very forcibly urged to blaspheme God and dye, and so be out of
her Torment; which yet she refused to speak it out: till at last, she could
no longer withhold, but was even ready to utter forth that blasphemy: and even
then was her Tongue smit, that she could not speak. She told moreover that
she usually every morning formerly was wont to read above twenty Chapters, and
so would have stilled her Temptations; but was not a jot the better. That she
could remember nothing of what she had read, but the judgments, and they were
laid open to her: But all the promises were sealed from me, said she. One day
I was tempted to throw my Bible into the fire, and I threw it from me, but it
fell not into the fire. But for this I was sore tormented, that I would have
thrown it into the fire.

Another time in my trouble, I said, what I was urged to say; it was this; If
the Lord will not save me, let him do what he will with me: Let him damn me.
But afterward, I was greatly terrified for it, that I should bid him damn me.

And now she saw the evil of yielding to such Temptations: she thought to
have had ease by yielding: but she was the more terrified for her yielding.
And yet the Lord magnified his mercy to her; when she thought, that by such
yeeldings, God would surely damn her. [O the depths of Satan's wiles: and O the
greater depths of the Goodness of God! even so such seduced souls!]

She further said; That the same day wherein she was forced to lie down
(viz. April 6.) she was taken in all her body: All was shaken, and she
trembled exceedingly. That her hands were clinch'd up together, and so were her
feet, as if it were by the Cramp; and her mouth was drawn up, as a purse; and
her eyes were with the eylids folded up and closed; and her hearing was taken
from her; and she had no motion nor desire of any good. Mine own eyes (said
she) pitied not my self; and just then was the time of love Ezekiel. 16. 8.
. And then the Good Samaritane, then Jesus Christ came, and powered in wine and
oil, when I had most need. I may well shy, He is a refuge Psalm. 46. 1.
, a very present help in time of Trouble.

May 7. Was another Conference between her and the Maid before mentioned April
24. which was at that present taken by the Relator.

Mris Sarah W. How do you? Have you not found him yet, whom your soul loves?


Maid told how long she had been thus, and yet was no beter, and how sad her
case was.

Mris Sarah. I have been in as sad a condition ever since I was about nine
years old. And that daughter of Abraham whom Satan had bound lo those
eightteene years Luke 13. 11.
, yet Christ healed.


Maid. But he will destroy me.


Mris Sarah. How dare you say so, when Christ says, He came not to destroy
Luke 9. 56.
sinners, but their sin: but to save them, such as you and I.


Maid. He Will save them he has chosen, but I am none of them.


Mris Sarah. Dare you enter into Gods secrets? Who made you of his secret
Counsel Romans 11. 34. Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
? Secrets belong to God.


Maid. Aye, but I would not hearken.


Mris Sarah. Its neither in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but in
God that shows mercy Romans 9. 16.
.


Maid. But I resisted when he would.


Mris Sarah. Your time was not come: for if his time had been to have come, its
not all your power, that could hinder his power.


Maid. I put out the light, and I walked contrary to his way.


Mris S. You were not in the light, nor true way, till you have Christ. He is
the light Jo. 1.9.
, and the way.


Maid. I can do nothing as I should.


Mris S. If you had done all, yet you might be but as the young man in the
Gospel, that said; All this have I done: Yet he wanted one thing: So you want
one thing, the sealing of his love to your soul. You must lie low before God.
Its Christ that both throws down, and Christ that raises up 1 Samuel 2. 6.
. He did both to me.


Maid. My heart is desperate.


Mris S. The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and is desperately
wicked Jer. 17.9.
. Its the depth Ps. 130. 1.
of misery, cries to the depth of mercy.


Maid. I am blind and see not the depth.


Mris Sarah. Your eyes are blind yet; and Christ came to open the eyes of the
blind, not of them that see, but that are blind Luke 4. 18.
. Its Christ must wash you with clean water; He must give it, and he will work
Isa. 43. 13.
, and who shall let him.


Maid. But I resisted, and such must be willing.


Mris S. But that's in the day of his power, then they shall be willing Ps. 110.
3.
. My body is weak to speak to you, but my Spirit is willing Mat. 26. 41.
, because he has made it willing, in the day of his power.


Maid. I have gone many a weary step to get comfort, but can get none.


Mris Sarah. Christ was weary for you, to sympathize with you. The strong man
possessed me, till Christ came who is stronger, and dispossessed him Luke 11.
21.
. And so will be do to you.


Maid. I am in depths of misery.


Mris Sarah. Its not depths of mercy that calls for depths of misery: but its
depths of misery calls for depths of mercy Ps. 130. 1.
. Now God would root you, and establish you, and now Satan is most busy with
you.


Maid. I am pulled up by the roots.


Mris Sarah. Christ will root you out of your sin, and root you out of your
self: and plant you in himself. He will do it.


Maid. I saw God full of Glory in the firmament.


Mris Sarah. He will make you and me to see him as he is, and we shall be like
him in Glory 1 John 3.2.
.


Maid. But I cannot believe.


Mris Sarah. I lay in unbelief, and could believe nothing, but that there was
no God, and no Devil, and no Hell: till he made me believe in himself: and
the same power that did it for me, the same will do it for you: for he is
yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever Heb. 13. 8.
: for he is unchangeable.


Maid. I had a glimpse of God, but I have backslidden from him.


Mris Sarah. Say thus to God; Turn me, and I shall be turned: the Lord says;
I Will heal your backslidings, and love you freely Hos. 14.4.
. I Will love you though you have backslidden, and heal your backslidings.


Maid. He speaks it not to me.


Mris Sarah. Why not to you, when it is free: to backsliders: And he is found of
them that sought him not Isa. 65. 1.
What can you say to this?


Maid. That Is to one in the first work.


Mris Sarah. Its in the first work, and the second work too. He takes pleasure
to work both the will and the deed Phil. 2. 13.
.


Maid. The Lord forewarnd me, and I hearkened not to him, and now he is gone.


Mris Sarah. This is nothing but sin and Satan, to hinder you from closing with
the Scriptures that are set before you. Say to God; Job. 34.31. Hos. 14.2.4 Ps.
41.4.
Heal me, I have sinned. Heal my backslidings.


Maid. I am no better for saying it, when I have no heart or Spirit to pray.


Mris S. Say it, though you be no better; because God bids you say it: Say it,
and say it again, till he heal you. It may be, he will come in, when you say
it, if you can but say it with your lips: the everlasting arms of God, can
reach you, when you cannot reach him; his are everlasting arms. He reached
Ephraim, are you more wild than he? that was at a bullock unaccustomed to the
yoke? Ephraim, an untamed heiser Jer. 31. 18, 19.
, that snuf'd up the wind? Yet God tames him, and he says, Turn thou me, and
I shall be turned: Say you so to God.


Mris Sarah having still kept her bed from April 6, till this May 7; and
neither eat nor drunk all this while, but according to the proportion
beforesaid; and being very weak and faint: the Maid was desired to forbear
speaking any more, then unto her, and to come again another time.

May 9. Being the Lords day, after both Sermons, these came to see her; Mr and
Mris Liggon, the Relator, Mris Dawson, a Ministers widow, Mris Berny, of
Norfolk, and many others; amongst which was a Gentlewoman in sad despair, that
hearing of her, came to have speech with her, and had. The Relator writ then
what was said after he came thither.

The Conference follows. Gentlewoman. The Devil Rules in me.


Mris Sarah. Christ will fetch you from him, he will dispossess him, and
possess himself.


Gentle. I am under sin.


Mris Sarah. Shall sin separate from the love of Christ? God hides himself
from the house of Jacob: though dear to him.


She speaking low, one asked the Gentlewoman if she did hear. Mris Sarah. O
that you might hear Joh. 5. 25. Ephesians. 4. 20, 21.
Christ speak to you.


Gentle. I cannot believe I am justified: for such are sanctified: and so am
not I.


Mris Sarah. You speak of sanctifying. Its against the scope of the Scripture,
to put sanctifying before justifying. You should believe that God justifies
the ungodly To. 4.5.
, that's for you to believe now; (and thence would arise your sanctification:)
And that you cannot come to him, except he draw you Jo. 6.44. and 10.29.
. That all power is in his hand. He is greater then all: and none can pull you
out of his hands. Devils, nor Angels, nor sin, can keep from him, when he will
draw you.


Gentlew. None knows my condition, how desperate it is.


Mris Sarah. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked,
who can know it Jer. 17. 9.
? He that has Balm of, Jer. 8. 22.
he, and he alone can heal it. None can wound the soul but himself: and none
can heal it, but himself; I found that everlasting arms were under me, and
kept me, though I knew it not. He taught Ephraim to go, though he wist it not
Hos. 11. 3.
,


Gentlew. I am rebellious against him.


Mris Sarah. He ascended and gave gifts to men, even to the rebellious Ps.
68.18.
. The great gift he gives them, is himself; and from that great gift, are all
other gifts, as all the streams are from the fountain.

If thou knew that gift of God, thou would ask it, and he would give it
Joh. 4. 10.
. She had a veil before her heart, but he took it away, and he gave her to
ask; she could not ask, till then.

I found that no other sin separates from Christ, but unbelief; and did he
come to find faith in earth, in earthen hearts Luke 18. 8.
? there is nothing but death, and unbelief, and envy, and rebellion, and all
manner of evil, till Christ came; and he gave faith to me, he found it not.


Qu: In what manner was his giving faith to you?


Mris Sarah. At first I saw clearly, Christ crucified for my sins. It was
neither Judas, nor Pilate, nor Herod, nor any other, so much as my sins. That
he was the skape-goat, that bare them all away into the Wilderness of
forgetfulness, never to be remembered any more Levit. 16.21.
. I cannot tell my misery how great it was: and I cannot tell the mercy, that a
full Christ came to such an empty creature; to such a one as I, that was as
Ephraim, an untamed heiser, unaccustomed to the yoke. Then his Name was
proclaimed to me, that he was a Savior, to save sinners: merciful, gracious,
long-suffering, abounding in goodness, and abounding in truth, to fulfill all
that mercy and goodness: and he is the way to the Father. Ah! that he should
love such a one, and marry such a one! that was a murmurer; disobedient, unholy
-- Such a one God was pleased to make an object of mercy. There Is an end of my
misery, though I thought, there was no end of it: but there is no end of his
mercy; my misery, was the misery of a creature; but his mercy, is the mercy of
a God, and there is no end of it. I was brought as low, at the lowest hell. The
gates were open to receive me: that then mercy should come to shut them! that
Christ came to fetch me out! He is good, and does good: not to them that are
good, but he makes good; nor to fill them that are full; but to fill them that
are empty. I Will leave in them an afflicted and poor people, and they shall
trust in the Name of the Lord: they that are afflicted and poor, its they
shall trust in his name Zeph. 3. 12.
. And what is his Name? but forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. I made
thee rest, from thy hard bondage, wherein thou wast made to serve: hard
bondage, and made to serve this hard bondage Isa. 14. 3.
. Yet God delivered, when none else could. In the first verse, the LORD will
have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel. I had no will, nor no desire
to him, nothing but perverseness and wretchedness, as in Israel. I might speak
and speak a long time, days and weeks, and months, and not able to tell all
my misery. The Lord loved me, and he chastend me: as he says to Laodicea, As
many as I love, I rebuke and chasten Rev. 3. 19.
.


Gentlew. All afflictions are for good to them that love God: but they bring me
no good at all.


Mris Sarah. I warrant you David could not say, His afflictions were good for
him, when he said, They are gone over my head, my heart fails me Psalm. 40. 12.
. But it was afterward that he said, It is good for me to be afflicted. The
Prodigal, whilst he was in his sin and misery, could not say, it was best for
him. But how did his Father and friends rejoice afterward Luke 15.32.
? I desire all the Saints might rejoice as much for me, as they did for him.
Christ came to seek and to save that that was lost. I found it so. I read, God
is good to them that are of a pure heart, and I was troubled at it; for mine
was not pure Psalm. 73. 1.
. That heart is pure, that he makes pure; he finds it not pure, but he makes it
pure. When I read, I read the promises, over and over, but I could remember
nothing of them: but if I read but a tittle of the judgments, that remained
with me. I could remember the verse where they are. At last, the promises
terrified me most of all; because they were for others, but not for me. None
could burst these brazen gates, but Christ alone. I was worse then a Beast.
Beasts praise God in their kind. But I dishonored him. But all this hindered
not his love to me.

Would you love God first? or would you have him love you first?


Gentlew. I do not love him.


Mris Sarah. We are by nature far from loving him: we are enemies to him: God
reconciles enemies Romans 5. 8-10.
. Its we were enemies to God, `not God an enemy to us. An enemy would not
reconcile enemies. But God reconciled us, when we were enemies to him. We were
then without God, far off, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling them; dead in
sins and trespasses, Ephesians. 2. read it. When God comes with power, he quickens
them that were dead in sins.

Are you weary in your Condition?


Gentlew. I give over all means, I think it bootlesse to use any for me.


Mris Sarah. I found no help by any means, yet I went on. I was contented with
nothing; to hear, or not to hear; read, or not read; pray, or not pray; no
peace in any thing. I have great experience of that place, If he give peace,
who then can trouble? but if he hide away his face, who is able to bear it Job
34.29.
? You do not seek him: and he says; I am found of them that sought me not,
that asked not for me. I said, Behold me, behold me, to a Nation that was not
called by my Name Isa. 65.1.
, That's a place for a poor soul to ponder much upon. Wait a little while, and
he will come Hab. 2. 3.
.


Gentlew. If you knew what sins I am in, you would not say so to me.


Mris Sarah. The blood of Christ cleanses from all sin; not from one sin, or
two sins, but from all sins.


Gentlew. When I went on in sin, the Devil told me, I was Elected.


Mris Sarah. The Devil says no such thing, but, Thou art damned for ever.


Gentle. I have been strangely deluded by him.


Mris Sarah. The sad Temptations and corruptions that deluded me! never any
were in the like. I never read nor heard of any such as mine. But the Lord came
in an acceptable time to succor me Isa. 49. 8.
. When I saw I had no good by good peoples speaking to me, nor their prayers
for me; nor by all my reading, nor hearing; no good to me: I felt such horror,
I thought hell to come, could not be worse then what I felt. I road to
Shrewsbury. I would not hold the bridle; I would gladly the horse might
stumble, or throw me in a ditch, and kill me: I let him go where he would.
[Thus she was thrown in a ditch, and when she came to the Inn, she being all
wet, would not shift her, nor dry her; but sat in the wet clothes, because she
was weary of life, and would have been out of it.] I would not eat. I saw
nothing but condemnation. I thought as I went, the earth was opening every
foot: and that the stones in the streets would open, and swallow me up. I saw
no other but condemnation. The more was my misery, the more is his mercy
manifested. One moment of his mercy, swallowed up the depth of my misery.

Before, I could not eat, nor drink, but I was troubled for it: I thought it
was to me, as to some at Sacrament, that I did eat and drink my damnation.


Gentlew. I am not troubled at my condition, though I know, if I dye, I go to
Hell.


Mris Sarah. Are you not weary of your condition? Is it no burden to you?


Gentlew. Yes, yes.


Mris Sarah. He is never weary, nor faint, in succouring sinners. Christ was
weary, and was in all things tempted, as we are: yet he knew no sin: that he
might sympathize with us, and succor us that are full of sin. (Heb. 2. 18.) He
hides himself from you. I Will look to him that hides himself from the house of
Jacob. They are Jacob, his people, yet he hides himself from them Isa. 8. 17.
. He hides himself, that we might the more desire him; as a mother from her
child.


Gent. I am fit for nothing, I can do no work.


Mris Sarah. I often could do none: and it terrified me, that I did none, when I
could do none: yet it terrified me night and day.


Gentlew. I am not troubled, though I have no faith.


Mris Sarah. You can have no true rest, till you believe. If God set on the
least sin to a young child, it will terrify it as much, as the greatest
sins of one that's a hundred year old, (as I have found.) When he creates
peace, there will be peace Isa. 57. 19.
.


Gentlew. That's to his people he creates it.


Mris Sarah. He calls them his people, that were not his people; and her
beloved, which was not beloved Romans 9. 25.
,


Gentlew. There Is no peace to the wicked.


Mris Sarah. All are wicked, till he makes them good. There Is no peace to sin,
nor Satan, but there is peace for the sinner; Christ is peace for the lost
sinner (Ep. 2.14.)


Part of another Conference May 11. 1647. taken at the writers coming in, it
being begun before he came. G. There Is no hope for me.


S. There Is hope in God, though none in you.


G. Its said; No temptation has taken you, but that that's common to men 1 Cor.
10. 13.
. But that is, except they be given up, as I am; for their condition was not as
mine is.


S. He makes no such exception: some have been before in your condition; and he
says, He makes a way to escape, not that way you think best, but the way he
thinks best: that you may be able to bear it. Christ bare burdens, that you
might be eased, when it is too heavy for you Mat. 11. 28.
.


G. I cannot be affected with my case.


S. Its God must give it. We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with
principalities and powers: we wrestle not with them in our own strength, but
in the strength of Christ, in the power of his might Ephesians. 6.10.12.
. [The party being silent and slow to speak, or to ask: she put out fit
questions to her; and so gained in, upon her answers.] Is your sin so great,
God cannot forgive you?


G. God can forgive me, but he will not.


S. God will graffe them in, because God can graffe them in, as he says Romans
11.23.
. No soul believes indeed that God is able to forgive it, but that believes he
is as willing to forgive, as he is able.

The Lord swear, saying, As I live, I will not the death of a sinner: but that
he turn from his sin Ezekiel. 33.11.
. and he turns it, and it is turned. He swears, he is willing; and yet you
say, he is not willing. He proclaimed his own Name, that he is Gracious --
forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin: and yet you say, he is not willing
to forgive you. You believe not; The great sin Christ dyed for, is unbelief.
You have no will to him: Its he that works both to will, and to do: and that's
his good pleasure, its because he is very willing to it. Of his own will he
begat us Ia. 1. 18.
. You see, how willing he is to it.

You see your sin now, more then you did before: Did you see it so before?


G. I was well enough, in my thoughts before.


S. Its God that gives you to see it.


G. The Devil can show sin by the Law.


S. The Devil can go no further, then his chain.

The God of peace shall tread Satan under our feet, and that shortly Romans 16.20.
` The Devil shall do that, that turns to good to Gods people.


G. That's spoke to them, whose faith and obedience was gone abroad through the
world:


S. Did Christ dye for the obedient, or for the disobedient? Christ dyed for
the disobedient and rebellious, that they might partake of his obedience. He
dyed for those Romans, not when they were righteous; but while they were yet
sinners, and ungodly, and enemies, Christ laid down his life for them: and what
obedience was in such? Can you say, God will not give you obedience? I warrant
you their disobedience went abroad first Romans 6. 17.
, before their obedience.


G. I refused all means of my good.


S. What if you had used all means?


G. Then I should have been more obedient.


S. Then you would have thought, you were some body: Means should be used; But
now Christ will be the more exalted, when you were so negligent. ( Isa. 43. end)


G. When Mr Prig taught on those words, Arise thou that sleep, and stand up
from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light Ephesians. 5.14.
. I was moved at it, I perceived by his teaching, that sin was the sleep; and
ingnorance was the cause; and repentance was the awaking. And I thought I did
repent; and I began, and saw sin in others, and saw how vile sins were, and had
a great desire to God and heaven: sometimes I was so; and by little and little
grew cold; I sinned against Conscience; and now I walk not in light, but in
darkness Isa. 50. 10.
.


S. Christ is light to them that are in darkness Lu. 1. 79.
. Who is it that awakens such, but Christ? You have been a backslider, and he
says, Ier. 3. 22.
I Will heal backslidings for my Names sake.


G. Now in all my reading, and all I do, I sin.


S. You cannot number your sins, and you cannot number his mercy. You will
have the more cause to magnify his Grace, if now he come in to you.


G. Now it is tedious to me, to read, or hear, I am so captived.


S. They that are free, need not be redeemed; he came to deliver captives Lu.
4. 18.
. Neither you, nor sin, nor Satan can awake; but Christ can awake, and will
awake them that sleep. No creature shall have a hand in his work, to have the
praise of it: But his own hand shall lay Isa. 59. 15.
hold on salvation.


G. I grew proud of it, that I knew more then others, and would be finding
fault with others; when all was nothing.


S. I cannot believe, that ever any were beyond my condition, in self, and sin:
yet has he showed mercy on me.


G. I cannot be sorry for my sins.


S. He Will show you, that he dyed for your sins: and then you shall mourn over
him, as one mournes for his only son Zach, 12. 10.
. He does not only bid, Be sorry and turn to me: But he turns the heart, and
makes it sorry: He was exalted to give repentance Acts 5. 31.
, and remission of sins.


G. What hopes have I, that have not repentance?


S. You have not repentance: He gives it to those that have it not, not to
those that have it.


G. I am unthankful, undutifull.


S. Think not of what is in you, but of what is in Christ for you: there is
unkindnesse in you, but kindness in him. He gives a thankful heart. His
promise is to give a new heart. He says, I Will give it Eze. 36.26.25.
. You are still remembering your sins, still be remembering mercy in forgiving
sins. Remember his kindness to Israel in the Wilderness: still they went from
him, and still he followed them 1 Cor. 10.4.
. He Will work, and who shall let Isa. 43.13.
? Neither sin nor Satan shall let, when he will work. Remember that still.


Another Conference with an afflicted woman, that heard of this mercy, and came
to her May 12. She still remaining in Bed, very weak and spent, as beforesaid.
Woman. Being asked how it was with her: she said; I cannot believe.


S. Its his work to give to believe, that dyed for sinners.


Woman. Its not for me.


S. Its for chief of sinners, for Mary Magdalen that had seven Devil, Mar.
16.9.
.


Woman. My heart will not be wrought upon.


S. Is any thing too hard for God? It Is Christ's work, and it is his Office, to
work on hard hearts; stony hearts.


Woman. I am often afraid, I shall never be saved.


S. You are but afraid so. He says, I Will sustain thee, I Will save thee, be not
afraid Isa. 41.10.
. He puts under his everlasting arms. I thought, and said, it was impossible,
that ever I should be saved. Yet that which was impossible with me, was not
impossible with God Lu. 18.27.
: But I thought it was impossible with God.


Woman. How long were you in that affliction?

Another answered, about four years.


Woman. But not continually.


S. Yes continually. But this last half year, in terror day and night.


Woman. I go to the means, but it is to no purpose.


S. So it was with me: I was worse by the means. What may your condition be?


Woman. I have cursed thoughts of God continually. About three quarters of a
year ago, when my husband was dead, I thought, What was become of his soul?
and what would become of me? that had made him worse by my perverse words to
him, when he was faulty: and one morning, after I was awake, I thought, the
room was full of smoke; and suddenly a fire went in at my mouth, and went
down hot into my belly, and there it went flutter, flutter. [ Another that
lately had been with her, said, this was just her condition; she felt such a
fire coming in at her mouth, and so into her belly. But after she judged it
was but a fancy: but remains in despair ever since.]
Then (said the woman) I suddenly flew out of my bed, into the midst of the
room; and a voice said within me, to my heart, Thou art damned, damned. I
felt the smell of brimstone. Thus it began, and I thought the house was full of
Devils. Then for six or seven weeks together, I never slept at all, I was so
terrified, and have been out of hopes, ever since.


S. Jesus Chrisi came to dispossess the strong man armed, that kept the house,
and to possess it himself Lu. 11.22.
: The Lion of the Tribe of Judah, has overcome that roaring Lion, that seeks
to devour you.


Woman. I can see nothing but damnation.


S. I could see nothing but Hell, and wrath: I was as desperate, as ever was
any: I said, I cared not whether I had mercy or no. I felt my self, soul and
body in fire and brimstone already. If all the fire and brimstone in London,
and all the pitch and tar, should all be in one fire, and I walking in the
midst of that fire; this was my condition. I beheld my self in hell locally;
my terror was so great. And I thought, there was no other Hell, but that which
I felt; and therefore I sought to make away my self, and many ways attempted
it: But God bath made me see my sin therein, and he ashamed; and mine iniquity,
and be confounded. Yet then I could wait no longer: and I said, if God will not
save me, let him condemn me: and it terrified me after that I had said so. But
were Gods thoughts as my thoughts? were his thoughts ill toward me, because I
thought so? Nay, Gods thoughts were not my thoughts Isa. 55. 8.
. God could withold possession, and temptation, if he would; but he sees, its
for his glory, and for the good of his, that you might love him the more; and
that his glory might the more be seen in his delivering of you.

Its Christ's work to dispossess, where the strong man armed keeps the house.
He does not dispossess the soul that was not possessed, but the soul that
was possessed: possessed with sin, and Satan, and corruption; that such should be
brought from the captivity of Satan, to the glorious liberty of the sons of
God. And then shall you see that this was good for you, and all things are for
good to them that love God. I say not that you can love God: but he will give
you a heart to love him De. 30.6.
.


Woman. I have no experience, that ever he showed that mercy on me.


Sa. He Will show mercy, that he may be feared Ps. 130.4.
. He Will show mercy to sinners; are not you a sinner, and ungodly?


Woman. But not to me, I cannot believe it.


S. You cannot believe it: I could not believe, that he died for me. Paul says
I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, injurious, yet I obtained mercy, to be a
pattern to others. (1 Timothy 1.) Had you seen my condition that I was in, as I
saw it, you would believ, be may as soon show mercy on you, as show mercy to
me: and sooner too, by far.


Woman. I was and am still of a perverse spirit.


S. He sees you are so, and he heales such. None can heal but Christ, he is
the Physician that heales che chiefest sinners freely. Put al sins into one,
unbelief is the greatest, and Christ died for that sin; and it is Christ's gift
to give faith, to one that has no says, to a heart full of nothing, but of
sin, and corruption, and unbelief, till Christ give it to believe Heb. 12. 2.
.


Woman. I would believe, but I cannot.


S. Say as the man said, I believe, Lord help my unbelief Mar. 9.24.
: there was faith and unbelief mingled. Christ comes to give repentance, and
remission of sins, Act. 5. 31.
and faith to believe it.

If you have Satan in you, Christ came to destroy the works of Satan: and its a
work only for him to do it.


Woman. I am in continual horror.


S. If he speak peace, who then can trouble? He will speak peace to his people,
and then So she spoke it, and so the Hebrew is future, Ps. 85.8.
they shall not return to folly: and what is that folly, but to distrust Gods
mercy, and have hard thoughts of God; as if his anger and wrath should be for
ever? (Ps. 77.8.10.)


Woman. Nothing will work on my heart.


S. No, not till Christ work: And if he work, who shall let him? His Counsel
shall stand Ps. 33.11.
.


The woman being wished to forbear, because the other was so weak and spent;
She would have the woman remember this: That Christ was carried into a
wilderness, to be tempted. So he brings a soul into a wilderness of
Temptation, and then will he succor them that are tempted. He says, I Will
allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and then speak peace to her. Ho.
2.14. That's Gods time to do it; and then he says to them, I will betroth thee
to me for ever; I Will betroth thee to me. Its the wildered soul, the desolate
soul, that he will betroth to him. Though you are now in the wilderness, never so
sore stung of fiery Scorpions; yet there is a brazen Serpent for you, even you,
to look upon, and be healed: or for such a one in your condition, never so sore
stung. Is holden up, not for them that are not stung but for them that are sore
stung, (Io. 3 14.)

May 16. She still being very weak in bed, was another Conference, she
seeking to comfort one in deep despair that came to her. The woman being
asked, how it was with her? Woman. I have slipped my time, (she had formerly
told her more, of her sad condition by sin.)


S. Was it Gods time to have done it? then Who could hinder him? Thou have not
called on me, O Jacob: thou have been weary of me O Israel: thou have wearied me
with thine iniquities. But was their time past? Nay, the very next verse is; I
even I am he, that blots out thy transgressions for mine own sake; not for thy
sake, be thou ashamed; but for mine own sake [Isa. 43 end.] And in Jer 5. 11,
12. The house of Israel and of Judah, have belied the Lord, and said, it is not
he neither shall evil come upon us. Yet Judah shall be saved, and Christ shall
be the Lord their righteousness (Iere. 23. 6.)

For four year together have I been in as sad a condition as you can be in:
and at least, it grow sadder and sadder still, till I came even at the brink of
Hell: and Hell gates were wide open; sin and destruction set them open; then
came Christ with his arms wide open for me, and pulled me thence.


Object. There Is no mercy to one in my condition.


S. I did not then apprehend there was any mercy for me. I never met with any,
so carried on as I was. I reasoned with God, Why he would make me, to damn me?
And why he made the Devil? Of late I thought, if I made away my self, there
was an end of my misery, and that there was no God, no Heaven; and no Hell, but
what I had already. This last, was ever since a month, or six weeks before
Christmas, as they call it. I could not believe the Scripture, nor any thing;
(I had judged my self for these evils.) I see, nothing is too hard for God,
that yet saves me, (Jer. 33. 17.) Then is no sin greater then unbelief. Yet
Christ ayed for this also. Did not Christ say to his own Disciples, O fools
and slow of heart to beleve? They were slow to believe, and yet Christ dyed for
them, and was not slow to give them faith to believe. Whatever we suffer in
Temptation, Christ suffered, being tempted, that he might partake in our
sufferings. Ought not Christ to suffer, and to enter into Glory 25
? It was Christ's way to glory. And are not you slow of hear to believe, that
you must suffer many things, and then enter into glory? When they knew Christ,
then he vanished out of their sight, that they might more desire after him; and
they went speedily to Jerusalem, and told of him. 31
And when Christ came again to them, they were afraid 37.
; and thought it was not he, but a delusion. (Luke 24. So when Christ comes to
your soul, "then you will fear, it is not Christ, it is but a delusion. It
was the Disciples condition before you, those that did lie in the bosom of
Christ continually.


Woman. These are great works for some.


S. Who does Christ work upon, but on stony hearts? His word is a fire and a
hammer, to break and to melt it: and he will give them one heart, Jer. 32.40.
to fear him, and they shall not depart from him forever. Jer. 23. 29.


Woman. I have no good at all.


S. What if you had all excellencies of wisdom, and gifts, and deeds? What
were all this, without the loving kindness of God? And God delights in showing
mercy and loving kindness, (Mic. 7.18.)


Woman. God has forsaken me.


Sa. Ier. 51. 5. Israel has not been forsaken, nor Judah, of his God. And what
was Judah? treacherous Judah, back sliding, idolatrous, and what not? see Ier.
3 They played the harlot with many, and feared not Gods judgments, committed
adultery, and turned to God feinedly. Yet Judah is not forsaken of his God, he
is his God: and not forsaken: though he said, He was forsaken, and his wound
incurable: yet he was not forsaken. And Judah shall be saved for all that, in
the Lord his God. For his own Names sake, he has taken away their sins
forever, and will remember them no more. He will remember his own free love;
this is his own work, and this he delights in. He loved us, and washed us in
his blood: that is she fountain where the Saints wash their Robes. Jer. 2. 13.
My people have committed two evils, (my people, and two evils.) they forsake
me, the fountain, (the fountain of our righteousness, and washing from sin;)
and they dig Cisternes of their own, (their ownrighteousnes they would look on,
and so do you,) which will hold no water: its a broken Cisterne. This was as
Adams fig. leaves. would cover but part of him, not cover all his nakedness: a
skanty skirt, that will not cover all silthines. But the clothing that God
made, will cover all. His fountain of living water is sufficient: and though
they digd their Cisterns; yet he sets open this fountain for them.

Say not as they said, My wound is incureable, and refused to be comforted. No
Physician can heal such as are incurable, and that refuse healing: but God
has balm of Gilead, and has healing there, and he powers in wine and oil,
and heals them, that said, their wound was incurable, and refused to be healed.
Ier. 15. 18. Because its the outcasts of Israel, the poor outcast soul, that
the Lord gathers together, and that he heals, (Psalm. 147.2, 3.) What think
you of such a soul, as refuses to be comforted?


Woman. My heart quarrels against God.


Sa. Who is any otherwise by nature? But what will a father do to his freward
child, that quarrels against the father? As a father pittyeth his child that's
distempered, so the Lord pitieth such. The Lord is more abundaut in love and
kindness, to such souls as Israel was, that were murmurers, backsliders, that
called not on him, but were weary of him; as Ephraim, that fed on lies,
unaccustomed to the yoke: yet Gods bowels were turned within him for Ephraim
Ier. 31. 18. 20.
: And he would not destroy him; For I am God and not man Hos. 11 8, 9
. Man, in his natural condition, is cruel to them that wrong him, and cannot
forgive and be kind, to such: but he is God and not man,


S. Being weak and spent, for a farewell, would have the woman to remember,
Ier. 46. two last. Fear not thou my servant Jacob: Jacob sind, and feared; but
he says, Fear not thou my servant Jacob; Behold, I will save them from a far
off: thou art a far off: yet behold. I Will save thee: thou art in captivity, in
bondage, I Will deliver thee. Return, thou shall return, `and none shall make
thee afraid. He says not, [no man shall make thee afraid,] but none; neither
man, nor sin, nor Satan; Fear not, for I am with thee. Did he think so? No:
Yet then God was with him. I Will make a full end of all the Nations, (their
enemies: so he will make an end of all thine enemies, thy sins, and corruptions,
and Satan;) but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in
measure: God will measure out what affliction, and in what manner, and for how
long, as for ten days, and it shall not exceed; but he will make thee able to
bear it.

O Earth, Earth, hear the Word. Ier. 22. 29.
Man is a lamp of Earth, and cannot hear more then earth, till he cause to
hear.


May 19. There came to visit her the Lady Renula, with Mris Fines, (wife to L.
Says eldest son, and Mris Brie. Mr Sprig also; and the Relator etc. One spoke
of her weakness; she said, My times are in his hands, and my fresh springs are
in him; for refreshing weary souls, and replenishing empty sorrowful souls.

Lady. You could not have hoped for such times formerly?


S. No, no more then the stones in the streets. I said many times, there is no
hopes for me; it was impossible there should. But, these things that were
impossible with me, and with men, they were possible with God. I found them so.
(Iu. 18.27)


Lady. How did your refreshings come in? was it by way of discourse, or in
prayer, or how was it?


A. By vision of God, as he pleased to come in, filling me with admiration of
the free love of God, to so vile a sinner, ( to Mr. Sp. she after said, He
revealed to me Jesus Christ, crucified for my sins; I saw it, and then I
mournd over him, that bare them away into a land of forgetfulness.)


Lady. Whether have you lost the memory of your former terrors, in your present
joys?


A. God has brought me from the power of darkness, into the kingdom of his
dear Son: and I should not be so sensible of his mercy in this, if I should
not remember the darkness I was in; therefore I do not desire to forget it.


Lady. Now you have the inward teachings of the Spirit, whether do you less
esteem the written word?


A. The word is the letter of the Spirit, and types out him; therefore not to
be the less esteemed.


Lady. If the Lord should recover you, whether do you think, you should
frequent the Ordinances, in hearing the word as formerly you did?


A. God will dispose me to that, that shall be for his glory, and my good. But
I look on Ordinances, as tokens of Gods love to his people, and representations
of Christ; that should neither be idolized, nor slighted; but they should be
used, and God loved above them: (To Mr. Sp. she said: As the spouse in the
Canticles, sets out her beloved by similitudes of him: so are Ordinances,
similitudes of him, by which he sets out himself to us, for our good. If Jesus
Christ himself should preach to the soul every day, and give not out of
himself, the Ordinance would be empty to it But he comes in to his people in
Ordinances, and there he fills the empty soul with good things.)


Lady. Whether do you not desire to live, to declare the great mercy that God
has expressed to you?


A. I desire nothing but his will, which does order all things to his own
glory, and his Creatures good.


Lady whether have you thoughts of the Church of God, and of the condition it
is in, in the parts that you know?


A. I wish with Paul, if it were possible, that all Israel might be saved.


Mris Bri. Do you not wish that all differences were composed and made up
among the Saints?


Answ. Yes.


Lady. What means do you think would be most effectual to compose them?


A. The beholding a reconciled God, seen by all: God was in Christ, reconciling
the world to himself. There is need of such a dayes-man as Christ, to
reconcile the world to God. (Suitable to what Mr. St. Marshall gathered from
Isa. 57. 19. I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace; viz. 1. That the
peace and the healing of Gods people, is Gods own work, a work of his
creating power. 2. Though it be so, yet the special way whereby he effects it
is the preaching of the Gospel of peace.)
Her face being covered as daily. It used to be since April 6) one spoke of the
great weakness of her eyes.


Ans. Christ has done a great miracle upon me: he has made the blind to see,
and the deaf to hear, and the damb to speak; he has done it upon many, and
he has done all upon one poor wretch: [Formerly her self was slow of speech,
that now has such freedom; speaking as with a new tongue.]


Mr Sp. Do you think to have it always day with you?


Ans. I know there may be clouds, that the soul cannot so apprehend the light
of Gods countenance: at David said, Restore to me the joy of thy salvation Ps.
51. 12.
: and why hidest thou thy face from me? But Christ the Sun of righteousness
will arise again. Mat. 42.
He will break through all these things. My times, and my refreshings are in
Gods hands Ps. 31 15.
to refresh the weary soul; which he will do freely.


Mr Sp. I would be glad to hear, which way the Lord came in to refresh you?


Ans. It was revealed to me, that Christ was crucified for me, even for me, the
chiefest of sinners. I never had a glimpse of Christ before; and then I admired
him. I saw it plainly. My greatest sin was unbelief; and I saw I was in
unbelief, and that the wrath of God abode upon me; I was damned already. And
not for any thing in me, but when unworthiness was in me, for his own
worthiness, even for his own Names sake, that he forgave all my sins. His
Name is Merciful, Gracious, long suffering, etc [Exo. 34 67,]


Mr Sp. What counsel would you give to one in that condition of darkness.


A. To wait on God, that hids himself. (Isa 8. 17.) My temptations were the
saddest of any: to believe there was no God, nor Heaven, nor Hell, but what I
felt: my soul remained in terror continually.


Mr Sp. You knew the Scripturs before, that comfort you now: wherein then is
your comfort? What Is the difference?


A. The Letter did but kill, it could not comfort, but God has refreshed me in
his love. God was the same to me in his love formerly, that he is now. But in
his fulness of time, he manifested that, which was before. I do not believe
that he hated me before; and loved me after: but all my affliction, was in his
love, and very faithfulness. The glory of God does as much appear, in
supporting a soul under terror, as in delivering it out of terror. Its said in
Isai. 24. 16. Glorify God in the fires; Though the soul sees it not then, yet
when the Lord brings it out, then he sees that God did glorify himself in the
afffliction.


Question. What do you think of the POWRINGS out of his spirit in the last
days?


S. Ans. [Then and since being put together.]
The Name of Christ is powered forth by the spirit on his people, and will be
still, and thereby we love him, when he has showed that love to us, and drawn
us.


Question. we have some drops of his spirit now, but are the powrings out now?
(Act. 2.17.31 38.)


S. Ans. There are many that love him now and why do they love him? its not
said, because of some Drops; but because thy name is Ointment powered out:
Therefore it is that any soul loves him. (Cant. 1. 3.)


Quest. But do you not think there will be a time, when God will power out
more of his Spirit upon his sons and daughters, then now is usual?


S. Ans. Though his love is powered out into the hearts of his people by the
spirit now, or else we could not love him; yet this is personal, to a few: but
I do verily believe, it will be more general to many, and in a greater
measure. This is but a taste now of what shall be.


Mr. Spr. Do you take no food?


S. Ans. Yes, I feed on Jesus Christ, he is my daily food, he feeds me with
himself: and he is full of satisfaction. ( Ioh. 6. 35. 51. 55.)


M. Spr. But I speak of bodily food: Do you think its no temptation on you to
forbear bodily food?


S. Ans. No. I would eat if I could, but I connot

If I try, it makes me worse. His word is my meat and delight. In my trouble, I
often could not eat, he fed me with bitterness and worm wood; I sed on terror,
that was my meat: and now the Lord makes answerable to it, his feeding me now
with promises, this marrow and fatnes: Psalm. 63. 5.
he refreshes me continually with his love, which is better then Cant. 1. 2.
wine May 21. One asked her, Do you sleep?


A. These three nights I slept not till three of the clock. but I lie still, I
stir not, but am content, and that's better.


Quest. How is that better?


S. Ans. Content is better then abundance: is it not? And Christ is never idle,
he is always doing somewhat in the soul.

One speaking of hopes of her life.


S. Ans. To be willing to live, is the hardest lesson to me: It were best for
me to be with Christ Phil. 1 23.
Yet its a more blessed thing to give, then to receive Act. 20. 35.
: to be doing Gods work, then receiving the reward: and I am content. Phil. 4.
11.



May 21. Relat. Quest. whether is Faith the Condition of the NEW COVENANT? S.
Ans. There Is no Condition in the New Covenant; its the freeness of his love,
and greatness of his compassion, that under takes all, when the Creature is in
the blood; as in Ezekiel. 16. There Is nothing in the Creature to move him, but
sin, and disobedience, and unthankfulness.[ So Mr. Slater's Catec. Of the TWO
Covenants, shows. The Matter is, sure mercies, sweet promises, have all in
Christ Yea, and in him Amen: to give a new heart, to know him, to write his
Law, put his fear into us, cause us to walk in his Statutes, forgive our
inquiries, -- to be our God, and make us his people, ( Ezekiel. 36. 26. Ier. 31.
31. Isa. 55. 3. 2 Cor. 1. 20. Quest. What Is required of such as are taken into
this Covenant? A. Nothing but what is given to them: he required that men
believe and repent: but its freely given to them so to do: Man's duty is the
matter of the promise, as well as Gods mercy, (1 Cor. 2. 12. Ephesians. 2. 8, Phil.
1. 29. Act 5. 31.) -- When we are required to believe, repent and turn to God,
We are not to seek strength in our selves, but to search into the Covenant and
turn the promise into prayer. As Repent, Act. 17. 30. The Covenant is, Christ
shall give Repentance, Act. 5. 31. Pray therefore; Turn thou me, and I shall
be turned, Ier. 31. 18]


Rel. Qu. About the LAW. Is there now any use of the Law to us?


Ans. There is use of the Law: the Law is holy, and the Command is holy, and
just, and good,f the Law is just, for it shows with Creature what it should
do, and what it cannot do without the power of God. There Is the Creatures
inability, and the power of Godf. R. 7 12.

Christ is the end of the Law for Righteousness, to very one that believes.
To. 10. 4. Believers can look on Christ in all things, and above all things.
All the Commands are done and kept in believing in the Lord Jesus, who has
done and undergone all for believers. The soul that breaks one of them,
breaks them all: the soul that keeps one, keeps all. The Lord Commands the
soul to do great works, and good works: And he works in them to will and
to work. Phi. 2. 13. And this is his work, that they beleev in Christ. The
Law says, Do this and live. The Gospel says, Believe and live. ( To. 10. 56.
S.) H. G. The Law was our Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.


Sa. Ans. The Law was a Schoolmaster; by types it The Greek has not, To bring
us, but the law was our pedagogue (or, a leader of us children) to Christ or
until Christ.
led out to Christ; But when Christ come, and says is come, we are no longer
under that Schoolmaster, and Tutor, and Governor, and rudiments, when the
fulness of time is come (*Gal. 3.24.25. Greek. Gal. 4 1,2,3 4 5.)


Relat. Have Believers no need of the Law? The Apostle exhorts believers to the
DVTIES of the first and second Table of the Law.


Sa. Ans. I believe the best Saints that are, have need of the Word, of the Law
and Gospel, of the Exhortation; because there is want in them; many things they
see not, and are slow too 2 Pet. 3.1.
. When one knows Christ in the Gospel of Christ, its the special way to lead
them on to the things of the Law Gal. 516.
. Where faith is, there is love to God and his will, and such cannot but be
careful to maintain good works; Tit. 2.11.
and till then, they can never observe the end of the Law, nor do any good
works, works that please God.


Quest. Is the Law of no use then to unbeleevers?


S. Ans. Yes It calls for that they cannot do, and gives no power to do: And
it curses them for not doing it. It shows them, they perish without Christ,
that they may cry, save Master, we perish. And none can redeem them from the
Curse, but Christ Gal. 3 13
. and he has redeemed them already by his death on the Cross, but it wants
manifesting to them Gal. 1 15.
, till the fullness of time come, and then they see it. The further one looks
into the Law, the more one is plunged into the depths; it wounds it the more;
its rather the worse then the better. And then is the time when none can heal
but Christ, that came to heal wounded souls Mat 9 13.
, and that is Christ's time to heal. ( May 24. Because she had said, Its a
living active Christ, in a dead passive creature, that makes it act. One asked
her whether every man should not use his endeavor about spiritual things or
duties


S. Ans. (Besides what was before said Page 64. wishing one that couldnot pray,
Go and say Take away all iniquity. Say it, because God bids you she added,)
Christ is the light and life of the world, and the only way to the Father Jo.
14.6.
, in whom and in him alone he is well pleased Mar. 17. 5.
, and its he only make us acceptable: Yet we must look at Gods will, that we
should pray, and wait on him in his ways: for he says blessed is he that
waits for him Jsa. 30. 18.
. Not that we can wait, by a power of our own; but he, that says there first:
Jsa. 30. 18.
Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious to you; he draws, and
gives a power to wait on him, and to pray; and he comes in, when he has waited
the sutest time. When Dan. 9. 3. 20.
Daniel set himself to pray, the Lord came into him, whilst he was speaking in
prayer. When Act. 10. 6.
Peter had gone apart to pray, and when Act. 22.17.
Paul prayed in the Temple, then the Lord came into them. And, as many as went
immediately to Christ were healed; So of those that went to the poole as to an
Ordinance, Ioh. 5.2.5
at certain seasons; some were healed. And there Christ healed the man that had
an infirmity 38 years, and had waited long, and had no help; at last Christ
healed him there. When Simon Magus was in the gall of bitterness, Peter bid him
prayt. He that cares for Sparrowes, and hears the Ravens when they cry, will
hear poor souls that pray.


Obj. Without faith, its impossible to please God.


Ans. It is so: and unless such believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder
of them that diligently seek him Act. 22. 17.
they will not else come to himt. But such faith, may lead to him (Heb. 11. 6^)


Quest. What judge you about GENERAL REDEMPTION, (and the consequence thereof,
FREE WILL, FALLING AWAY, etc.) Seeing you hold out to all that come troubled to
you, that Christ has redeemed them; and that it only wants manifestation to
themselves?


Answer. The Gospel is to be held out to all the world, to the chiefest of
sinners: And this is Gospel: That Christ was sent of God to them, to turn them
all from their sins, Act. 3 26. Act. 17. 38. 46 Act. 5. 31. Lu. 24. 46. 47.
and to justify and Pardon them; and to give Luke 10. 5. Act. 10. 36.
peace to them that are a far off, and that God is not 2 Pe. 3. 9. Ezekiel. 33.
11. Luke 13. 34.
willing that any should perish, but that all should repent and live. Gods
willingness to 2 Cor. 5. 18.
reconcile the world to himself, it to be held out to all. And those that I
thus speak to, are afflicted: and affliction is the portion of those that he
loves. And he had loved such, and Christ had redeemed them, whilst they were in
the furnace of affliction, though they knew it not: it only wanted the
manifestation to them: and when this fullness of time is to draw them, it is
not because God then began to love them, but he loved them with an everlasting
love: therefore it is that in tender mercy he draws any souls. (Jer. 31. 3)
There is his free choice; and his mighty power in drawing such as were dead in
sins; which no power of man could do: none can come to Christ: except the
Father draw him Jo. 6. 44. 63.
, And having loved his own, he loves them to the end Joh. 13. 1.
; and none can pull them out of his Fathers hand. Who shall separate us from
this loves To. 8. end.
? neither men, nor sin, nor Satan.


Another added as follows: 1. Jesus Christ says, Preach the Gospel to every
creature: say, Peace be to this House. Thus the Disciples did to the worst:
Peter, Act. 3. 26. Paul, 1 Cor. 15. 1. 3, 4. with 1 Cor. 6. 9-11. Chap. 2. 2.
Hereby they received the Spirit, Gal. 3.5. 2 Pet. 1.4. Which alone convinces
effectually of sin, righteousness, and judgment, Job 16. 8. and melts the
hard heart, Zach. 12. 10. Isa. 53. 5. (Gods choice was not used to be preached
to all, but for the comfort of them that knew they believed, Ephesians. 1. 3, 4. 2 Timothy 1. 9.) In preaching of the Gospel, light, motion, and power goes out to
all: which men resist: and such are destroyed, not because they could not
believe; but because they resist, and will not obey; and so die: Act. 7. 51.
Luke 13. 34. Ezekiel. 33. 11. Hos. 13. 9. 2. All the Redemption or freedom that
all have, from temporal, and from hellish torments at present; and all the
good to heart, body or state, that they enjoy; all is by the redemption of
Jesus Christ; who saves all, (both) men, (and beasts:) especially them that
believe; thus, 1 Timothy 4. 10. Psalm. 36. 6. 3. The time must be, when every
promise of God must be fulfilled, Ioh. 10. 35. Mat. 5.17, 18. And therefore,
the time comes, when in the seed of Abraham, (that is, in Jesus Christ,) all
the Genesis 22. 18 Genesis 18. 18.
Nations, Act. 3. 25.
kindreds, Genesis 28. 14.
families, Psalm. 67. 5.
people of the earth, (even to the Verse. 6.
ends, or utmost corners thereof,) shall be blessed. When the stone in Daniel,
that smites the feet of the mighty image, shall become a Dan. 2. 34, 35. 45.)
MOVNTAIN, and fill the whole earth. Dan. 7. 27.
Then the kingdom, and dominion, and greatness of the kingdom under the whole
Heaven, shall be given to the Saints of the most High; whose kingdom is for
ever, or for an age; and all Dominions, (of Rulers, Psalm. 72 11-17.
all Kings and Psalm. 100. 1-4.
people, shall serve and obey him. This was never yet fulfilled and therefore
we may rejoice, that as God is true, as this shall be performed.


H. G. Whether does the Lord at any time PUNISH or chasten his people FOR SIN


S. Ans. He says; For this cause some are sick and weak among you 1 Cor. 11.
30.
. But I cannot call it a Amos 3. 3. Hebr. is visit upon you: not punish. So
Ier. 46.28. and elsewhere.
punishment for sin to his people; for Christ has paid their debt already, and
bare their sin into land of forgetfulness. Thou forgavest the punishment of
my sin. If the punishment for the least sin were taken away, it would press
them down to Hell: and then what would their greatest sin do? But Christ has
satisfied, to take away the punishment.

But yet he has fatherly chastisements for them. For whom he loves he
chastens: What son is he whom the Father chastens not Revel. 3. 19. Heb. 12.
7.
? He chastens them to love, and they see it, and that makes them sorry for sin
as sin; or else they would never be sorry for sin as sin, but that they see his
love. Its his love, that he will correct them, and then he deals with them, as
with one of his own. It is in love, what ever he does to his, in all
afflictions; though the soul may not see it, till afterward: For, All things
are for good to his people.


May 26. 1647. There came to her a wife that being past her reckoning, thought
her Pangs of Travel were come upon her: but (as she said) those being as
nothing to the pangs and terrors her soul was in; having been with Mris Sarah
before, she came now running to her; bewailing that in this her extremity she
had no God to go unto.

Mris Sarah's eyes that had been so very ill, by her cruel beating them, (and
by often bruising her head against walls, in her terrors, to have beat out her
brains,) being now somewhat better, beheld the sadded woman coming in, and had
presently cast in, a word to speak to her; which was this: Judah shall be
saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely Je. 23.6
and who were more sinful then they? Yet God has made a promise to them. If
you were as bad, (as you are as bad by nature,) yet look upon that promise,
which was cast upon me, as you came in; That you, even you shall be saved, and
dwell safely, under the shadow and protection of the Almighty; which is a safe
shelter indeed, from what storms soever they be. Those sins, that are
crimson-sins, and of a scarlet dye; yet God has pardoned doubtless, he has
loved you freely, and pardoned you not for any thing in you, but for his Name
sake. You say, you are weary of your sins, and you desire nothing but Christ:
Therefore the promise is to you.

Woman mourning said, [as the Relator then wrote it,] I am in unbelief.


S. Ans. Its rather a token you have some Faith though you see it not. The Corn
that is sown in the Ground, is first hid, and then the Mar. 4. 28.
blade and growth appears. You are wounded: its not you that wound your self;
but he says, I wound and I heal. Therefore he says to one Mar. 5. 34.
, Go in Peace, thy faith has made thee whole: Thou beleevest I can heal
thee. This faith in me, has made thee whole. So for you though yet you see it
not; you believe Christ can heal you; Desire he would but speak the word, and
manifest it to your soul.


Another asked her, Do you think Christ is willing you should believe? Woman.
Yea, But there are Mountains in the way.


S. Behold he comes leaping over the Cant. 2. 8.
Mountain of Opposition that are in the way.


Woman. If the world knew the worth of the glimpse of faith, they would prize
it, who cannot believe.

Quest. What is faith?


S. A believing, Christ is a sure and strong Rock and refuge to fly too Heb.
6.18.
Had it not before him, you had been swallowed up. Would you rest on our own
righteousness? on any thing in you?


Woman. I am much looking at that, to feel something in me.


S. That's but filthy rags Isa. 64.6.
: and he will take them away, and cloth you with change of raiment Eze.
16.10.-14.
: as Joseph's Genesis 41.14.
rags were taken away, and he was clothed with better raiment.


Woman. When I was troubled about my condition, about ten years ago, one day
as I mused, a voice said plainly to me; Marie, thou shall dye, and live again:
and thou shall glorify God greatly. Thy ways are not my ways; nor thy thoughts
my thoughts. This filled me with joy unspeakable; and I said; Yea Lord, let it be
as thou will. I was persuaded, it was an Answer from God: Then I could not, but
send for my friends, that they might hear what God had done for me; and I told
them of this. Then I presumed that I had faith: and I looked, that God would
do great things for me, that he had thus spoken to me, and done so much for
me. I was carried on thus for a time. But after this, I was led to sin again:
and I feared I should sin: and I said, Lord, shall I sin again? it went to
my heart. The voice answered me; Though thou do, thy sins are buried in the
bottom of the Sea: They are bound in a bundle, and cast into the depth of the
Sea. I was not led to sin by this. But I forgate Gods goodness, and I fell into
sin by little and little: and now I have been a backslider.


S. Here are backslidings. He says, I have seen his ways, and I Will heal him,
and restore comforts to him. I Will heal their backslidings, I Will love them freely
mind that. What joy is it to a Shepherd, when he finds a lost sheep? more joy,
then over all the rest. You are the lost sheep: he will joy over you Hos. 14. ^
.


Woman. Legions of sins are before me.


S. Legions of Devils were within me, not before me; but within me; Yet he has
clothed me, and c^^ out Legion. (Mat. 8. end.) Who came Christ for? Was it for
the righteous Mat. 9. 13.
? You are an alien, without God without Covenant of promise.


Woman. I am confident, that is my case.


S. God draws such souls: Christ dyed to reconcile such souls: the Spirit
ties both ends together, he tied them and Christ together, uniting them to
Christ. So did he with those Ephesians, They were dead in sin and trespasses,
strangers from God, without God, far off, twain; but these had he made near.
Such does God draw, and makes up the breaches. See the condition they were in,
Ephesians. 2. 12. and Hosea, the first and second Chapters. He said, They are not my
people and then it shall be said, now they are the children of the living God.
Hos. 1. 12. Before not people, as now, not only people, but children: before
they were dead people; now they are living children: the living God, gives them
new life. They have life from God that they may live to God. In Ephesians. 2. Ephesians.
2. 1. 5-8. 10.
You that were dead, has he quickened; and by Grace ye are saved through Faith
-- not of works, least any should boast. We would boast, if we did any thing in
it. He works, Faith, and he builds up still: he builds higher and higher, till
his work be finished: We are his workmanship.


Woman. My condition is very dangerous and hopeles.


S. How is it?


Woman. I have an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from God.


S. Have you departed from him? then you had him. How have you departed from
him, if you never had him?


Woman. I never had him.


S. What if now you shall have him? and you be a child? not only a servant,
but a child, an heir of God?


Woman. I should admire it.


S. He will show mercy to be admired. He will come and be admired in his Saints
that believe 2 Thessalonians. 1.10.
. He raises up a bondslave, to be with him in glory. It is a faithful saying,
though the soul doubt of it: and its worthy of all acceptance: though the
soul would not accept it; That Jesus Christ came to save the chiefest of
sinners 1 Timothy 1. 15.
. The Lord will deliver you of two Burdens; the burden of sin, and your other
burden also. Your extremity, is Gods opportunity. In him Judah shall be saved.


Woman. In my prosperity, a poor woman came to me, that had her son in slavery;
and she begged of me to give her somewhat toward her son's release. But I
thought, all was little enough for my self: my sister gave her somewhat; but I
would give her nothing: the woman wept. And now I think on my An Item to all,
wisely to consider the poores cry. Prove. 21. 13. Psalm. 41. 1-3.
unmercifulnes, when now my soul is in slavery my self: his slavery is nothing
to mine.


S. Christ came to deliver them that are captives and bondslaves Luke 4. 18.
, not them that are at liberty: The Son makes free Joh. 8. 36.
, not them that were free, but them that were in bondage.


Woman. I am without hope of mercy, and my heart fails, and gives up all.


S. Some refused Psalm. 77.2.
to be comforted, and would not be healed: yet he heales them. He looks after
the Outcasts Ps. 147.2.
, that none look after.


Woman. That's my case.


S. Yet there was mercy for them; and why is this written, but for our
instruction and comfort Romans 15. 5.
, that we might have hope.


Woman. Not one word will abide with me, that's spoken.


S. The time was not yet come. For in the appointed time, it will surely speak,
and not lie: it will speak truth, and peace, lasting peace, abundant mercy and
love. Wait therefore for that time: The Name of God is to be Preached and
Proclaimed: that he is gracious to graceles ones; and merciful to miserable
ones; and long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth Exodus 34. 6.
, to them that have abundance of sin; and he would that repentance and
remission of sins, should be published in his Name Luke 24. 47.
. When he gives you a glimpse of his love, you are apt to belly the Lord, as
Judah did, and to say, it is not he: unless it comes with a full persuasion to
you: yet this hindered not the Lords coming in and healing them. Though (not a
person, but) the Land was filled with sin, against the Holy One of Israel: yet
Israel has not been forsaken Jer. 51. 5.
: He said, I am forsaken, and not only forsaken, but forgotten: Zion said so,
and Israel said so; yet he is not forsaken.

For a farewell, she said, Go, and Believe, the Lord Jesus makes you whole: and
so Go in peace, believing its Christ must make you whole, and none else.


May 28. A maid in deep despair came to her. [The Relator being present, writ
then also.] After other expressions, the Maid said as follows. Maid. It has
been sad with me, since it was said to me; Repentance is hid from thine eyes:
and woe unto them, when they depart from the living God.


S. Ans. The Lord says, I Will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not
depart from me Je. 32.40.



Maid. But I have departed from him, therefore I am none of his people.


S. There (says he) where it was said Hos. 1. 12.
, They are not my people: there it shall be said, they are the children of God.


Maid. I am without God, an enemy to him.


S. Well, let it be so, you are without God in the world, a stranger, an enemy:
yet such has he reconciled by the death of his Son Ephesians. 2. 12.
: all the want is, you cannot see it so.


Maid. I am far off from him.


S. He gives peace, peace, to them that are far off.


Maid. I had a great deal of light; and I departed from it.


S. So did Judah; they departed from the living God, and went to dead Idol
Gods: yet he would marry them.


Maid. I have done so.


S. So did they before you, and yet he married them.


Maid. But I have rejected him.


S. You can do nothing else, but reject him: but your greatest rejecting is, to
reject Thus leading her to the root sin, that looked at branches more: so did
she often.
a promise from God when he holds one out to you; then you say, it is not to
me. Thus I find, as you do, in rejecting promises: and that was my greatest
sin.


Maid. Your sin was not like mine.


S. No sin was like mine, as I judged. Mine was against such light, that I
judged I had sinned against the Holy Ghost.


Maid. That word terrifies me, that was said to me, Repentance is hid from
thine eyes.


S. That word when I read it, I was ready to tear it out of my book, There
were three other Scriptures that were terrible to me. He that believes not is
condemned already, John 3. 18.
was one: Another was, He that believes not the Son, the wrath of God abides
on him v. 36.
. A third was, He that made them, will not have mercy on them Is. 27. 11.
: no mercy, none at all. But above all, this; Repentance Hos. 13. 14.
is hid from mine eyes.


Maid. Was it so with you? and then said, The Discoveries of Christ, and
promises, are more terrible to me, then the curses of the Law.


S. Sometimes it was so with me; salvation was turned into condemnation to me:
promises that were never so sweet, were terrible to me.


Maid. When he would have healed me, I resisted, and would not.


S. Who has resisted his will? Here is Gods mercy to you, that by his Spirit
he has convinced you of sin; when you might have gone without any sight of it.


Maid. I have not the light of it.


S. You see, you are in darkness: Christ came to be light to them that are in
darkness Lu. 1.79.
. Christ would not unbottome you of your self, but to bottom you on himself
Hos. 2.7.14. Hos.14.3.
.


Maid. He that overcomes, to him will he give to sit on his Throne Re. 3.21.
, and to eat of the hidden Manna Re. 2.17.
? One may go far, and not overcome. He that endures to the end, shall be
saved Mat. 24.13.
: but I fear, I shall not.


S. He says, 2 chr. 20.15.
fear not, nor be dismayed: for the battle is not yours, but the Lords: you
lie down in your shame, but he is your strength, your al in all.


Maid. Better never to have known the Truth, and holy Command, then having
known it, to depart 2 Pet. 2. 21.
, as I have departed.


S. All the Scriptures you bring, are to bring you off from your sandy
foundation; you would build on something you would find in your self, and
feed on husks, your prodigals portion Lu. 15.16.
: Christ is unbottoming you of your own righteousness Phil. 3.7.
, and of all evil, to make known himself, and his righteousness to you: and to
set you on that Rock, that is higher then you.


Maid. Not one glimmering light of him have I.


S. Ans. Had you these eight years enjoyed such light and comforts as you would
have had, you would have rested in them. But God would not have you rest short
of himself Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3. 8.
.


Maid. I have sinned against all the means and light he has given me.


S. You will the more prize his mercy, and the more love him, when you shall
see his love to you, notwithstanding all this Mic. 7. 18. 1 Timothy 1. 13-17.
.


Maid. Judas after his sin, he repented: I have not so much as he had.


S. He had a natural Repentance: you wait for Repentance from Christ Act. 5.
31.
, who is sent to give Repentance to them that have no Repentance.


Maid. I have sinned with Judas; But he says, Return; And I have not returned.


S. Does he expect they should return in their own strength? No. But he turns
them, and they are turned Je. 31.18.
. Judah was given over to reproach, and to treachery, and whoredom, and to all
manner of sin: Their sins were such, as could not be numbered: They would none
of God, but were weary of him Isa. 43.24.
: yet he would not forsake them Jer. 51.5.
; but would have mercy on them, and would love them freely, and would forgive
them, and blot out their sins, for his own sake 25.
; that they might not boast of their own righteousness 1 Co. 1.29.
: but glory in the Lord only.


Maid. I go on in sin: and what hope for such?


S. Ephraim feeds on wind; and the house of Israel co^pisseth him about with
lies: yet they were not destroyed: for his bowels were turned for Ephraim, Hos.
11.8.


Maid. If I eat, I am terrified for it.


S. If I did eat, I was terrified for it. Sometimes I durst not drink in a
whole week together: because I judged, it was a Cup of Devils 1 Cor. 10. 21.
, and I drank to Devils, if I drank: and if I did eat, I thought I did eat my
own damnation.


Maid. I would fain be out of this life, that I might have an end.


S. Would you be sooner in Hell? Is not that worse?


Maid. I would be sitting alone, and musing, and not work: because I have no
hope.


Quest. When you work not, have you no thoughts?


Maid. Yes, thoughts of sin, and of misery.


S. Then it is better for you to be employed in business Romans 12. 11.
: Forels, the enemy has more advantage: And specially because God bids you
labor the thing that is good Ephesians. 4.28.
.


Maid. I shall never be comforted: I am cast out.


S. Because thou say, my pain is perpetual, my wound is incurable Jer. 30.
15-17.
: and are called an Outcast: therefore the Lord will cure thee: The Lord
gathers the outcasts of Israel.


Maid. Once that promise was sweet to me; The mountains shall depart, and the
hills shall be removed: but my kindness shall not depart from thee, nor shall
the Covenant of my peace be removed, says the LORD that has mercy on thee
Isa. 54.10.
Then God was sweet to me, and his people sweet; I could have laid my hand
under their feet. But now, mercy is departed, and all is nothing.


S. Has God said, It shall not depart, and will you say, it shall depart?
Mountains of sin and corruption shall depart; but he will not depart. The
Father draws the soul to his Son: the Son receives it; the Blessed Spirit
unites it, and makes of two, one; He knits the knot in the middle, and ties
these two ends together. Christ and the soul: which knot of love, none can
untie 1 John 5. 7.
.


Maid. God might say, What could I have done more for thee, then I have done
Isa.5.4.
? and yet I have thus revolted from him.


S. Israel not only revolted, but deeply revolted. Yet he says, Return, and
he turns them. He gathers, not only Israel in general; but the Outcasts of
Israel: the skirts and rags of them. I Will tell you what your state is. You are
as a man, that is taken from his house, where was some light; and is put in
Ludgate, and put in a dungeon, where he has no light. If one comes from the
King with a pardon, and to call such a one to the Kings Palace, where the light
is greater and more glorious, then that he had before: how will he then admire
it? And will not you admire it, if the great King shall do thus with you, that
are now in a dark dungeon? If he work, who shall let him? his pleasure is, to
raise up one from a dungeon of darkness, and to bring such to his marvailous
light 1 Pet. 2.9.
: From a dunghill; from sin, and corruption, and the Devil; to sit with
Princes Psalm. 113.7,8.
; to give them a kingdom. Fear not little flock Luke 12.32.
, its your Fathers good pleasure to give you a kingdom.


Maid. If I were of that flock, I might have hope.


S. Other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them will I bring to the
Sheepsold, and they shall hear my voice: and there shall be one fold, and one
Shepherd Joh. 10. 16.
.


Maid. The Lord strove with me, and I resisted.


S. If the Lord pass over all this, your soul and body will melt: you will be
overcome with this goodness of his, to be his for ever. Its the Son that must
make you free, and then you shall be free indeed Joh. 8.36.
.


Maid. But I have fined against such great light: and what will my end be?


S. What think you of Peter that so denied Christ? Was not be on the mountain
with Christ, and saw his glory Mar. 9. 2.
? did not he see light? and yet how sinned he against it? when be both denied
Christ, and forsware him Chap. 14. 71.
. And yet what love showed Christ to him after all this? Tell my Disciples, and
tell Peter that I am risen Chap. 16. 7. 9.
. I was much troubled with the Parable of the foolish Virgins: It was terrible
to me. But yet see what was there? At midnight there was a great cry; Behold
the Bridegroom comes, go forth to meet him Mat. 25. 6.
: So when it is the darkest time with you, you are called to go forth to meet
him.


Maid. I think as I go in the streets, something will fall on my head, and will
kill me.


S. When I went in the streets, I thought the Earth would open, and swallow me
up. You cannot reckon up the thing, but I was troubled with it.


Maid. I desire I might be a warning to all, to beware by my example, of
sinning against light, as I have done, and brought all this misery on me.


S. It may be this is it the Lord aims at, in his hiding himself from you:
that you may be for a warning: and yet he may return to you again 1 Timothy
1.13-16.
.


Maid. If I had hearkened, then my peace should have been as a river, and my
righteousness should go before me.


S. Be you ashamed, and confounded, that you have so neglected him: and if he
will show his love to you, notwithstanding all this, how will you admire him?


Maid. Ay, as much as any. I should have as much cause to admire him, as ever
had any.


A. Therefore he will be gracious, that he may be exalted Isa. 30. 18.
.


Maid. If I could weep day and night, I should find more ease; but I cannot.


S. What if you could? yet the Law and all your doings are weak; Romans 8. 3.
but you have not what you would in your self, that you may not rest short of
Christ. You would not else so desire the riches of Grace to such a one. Are you
not weary and sorrowful?


Maid. I am.


S. He will satiate the weary soul: and he will replenish the sorrowful soul.
Jer. 31. 25.



The maid having further heard by this Gentlewoman, how sad her condition had
been; and that yet the Lord had been so gracious to her, she said: Mine was not
sadder then yours has been: but only that I had sinned against greater light.
How long were you in that sad condition? S. Four years and above, since I was
little more then eleven years old: But the last half year and above before the
Lord delivered me, I was full of terror night and day; and at last, I had no
rest at all, being violently tempted against my life.


Maid. Then I may have some hope that the Lord may deliver me; because I have
not been above two months so violently troubled.


May 31. Being Monday, came to her the Lady Willoughbie of Parham, with Dr Coxe
Physician, and Mrs Cox; Mr and Mrs Adderley, of the Charter House, etc.

Having heard of her great comforts, Dr. Cox put several Questions to her;
Which with her Answers, were to this effect.

1. Dr Cox. Some say of your Comfort, that it is but a Delusion, some say it is
not.


Q. How do you know it is no Delusion?


S. Ans. You cannot know what my comforts are except you knew what my terrors
were: But I believe, the Lord did not keep me in them, and carry me through
them, and deliver me from them, ( not foon one, but from all my fears,) and
give me comfort to delude me with his comfort. For nothing could satisfy in
those Terrors, but Christ; therefore it is apparent that it is Christ; because
nothing else could do it to free me from one of my terrors; much less to free
me from all. Could any thing keep me from such great temptations, but the power
of God? (then she told of some of her Temptations.)


Q. How know you it was the power of God?


Ans. Because it was the bare arm of God that brought salvation to me: (Isa.
59.16.) nothing else could, and nothing else did it. I went about seeking rest,
and could sind none, till he gave me rest.


Q. How know you this working in you, is the Spirit of God?


A. Where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty he 1 Cor. 3 17.
sets the soul at liberty, that was in bondage; for I was in bondage. The other
is a Spirit of Error; this is the Spirit of Truth: the other is the Spirit of
darkness, this is the Spirit of light. This is the Spirit of Truth, and not of
Error, because he leads the soul into all Truth: Ioh. 1 13.
and he set me at liberty, that I am no under the Law, but under Grace Romans
6.14.
.


2. Q. How, or in what sense are you not under the Law?


S. Ans. Because the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the
law of sin, and of death. For what the Law could not do, being weak, etc.
(Romans 8. 2. 3.) It was weak to pardon my sin, and to carry it into the land
of forgetfulness: therefore God sending his Son -- condemns sin, and saves the
sinner: even me, the chiefest of sinners.


3. Q. Whether have you SIN in you?


A. Yes; a thorn in the flesh ( as Paul had,) to humble me: but not to condemn
me. (2 Cor. 12. 7.)


Q. Whether do you think that others judge of your condition now, that it is
but in hypocrisy?


A. They that saw, or knew me in my Terrors, when I could not be ruled; might
well know, that nothing but the Peace of God, which passes all understanding,
could so rule me, which was as Ephraim, an untamed heifer, (Phil. 4.7. Ier.
31.18. (she spoke this very low.)


4. Q. Why do you speak no louder? are you weaker with your joys, then you
were with your Terrors?


Ans. I had more cause in my Terrors, when I abused my body; but I never felt
it, till now. I beat my head often against the wall; and took my flesh in my
teeth: and the more and ofter I did it, the less I felt it. And when I had an
opportunity against my life, and did not take it; then I beat my self for it
most of all, because it took not effect: Or if I spoke any thing that was
offensive to any with me, or did that I should not; when it was brought to mind
afterward, then I abused my body for it, most of all. And that I did so then,
is the cause why I lie here now. For now that he has brought me to my self,
now I feel it. He did not only bring my soul to hell, and brought it back
again; but my body to the grave, that he might raise it up again if he see it
good. (1 Samuel 2.6,7.)


5. Qu. Why do you not eat? Why do they now get things for you, that you may
rise again?


Ans. I do eat. But its meat to eat, that the world knows not off; but those
that taste of it: His words were Jer. 15. 16.
found, and I did eat them. His words are the joy, and rejoicing of my heart;
his words of mercy, and love, and joy in the holy Ghost; which sill an empty
soul indeed, as I was: which is meat indeed, both to soul and body at the
present.


Qu. Whether do you not refuse the creatures our of temptation?


An. No, for I would eat, if I could: my stomach was then sild with terror that
I could not eat; and now with joy. If I could, I would take the Creatures; but
for the present I cannot: But if he see it best for his glory, and my good, I
wait for a power from him for this, as well as for the rest that he has done
for me for I know that all power is in his hand, and all my times are in his
hand: therefore I desire to wait on him.


Q. Whether could you endure to be mocked and skoff'd, and jeered at in the
world? if some should say, This is she that was mad, or that counterfeited
could you endure it?


Ans. Its no more then my Lord and Master was before me: They said, he was mad,
and had a Devil: and the Soldiers mocked him. Let me undergo the uttermost, I
do but follow his 1 Pet. 2. 22.
steps. And if I will be one of Christ's, I must do so Luke 14. 26.
. He suffered it, but for such a one as I, though he was the Son of God; yet he
made himself of no reputation Phil. 2. 7,8.
, And what was it for? but to die for me the the chiefest of sinners, that I
might live to have life from him, that I might live to him 2 Cor 5. 14, 15.
.


7. Q. Whether could you be content with Christ alone now, and take no comfort
in any thing in the world, but be satisfied with him alone?


Ans. Yes, very well: for he is a satisfying Christ: for having him, I have
enough, I have all things. Therefore I desire not to look after pleasures in
the world, for I have enough in him Phil. 4.11, 12.
. For he is full of satisfaction: and I have tasted of that fullness, Grace for
Gr..ce. Io. 1.16.



8. Q. Whether do you love God now, more then ever you did before?


Ans. I know not that ever I loved him at all before: For I had no love at all
Tit. 3.3.
, neither to the Creator, nor to the creature: for all were enemies. All the
sight of God I had then, was, that he was an enemy. I saw no excellency, nor
beauty, Isa. 53.2.
nor comeliness in him to be desired at all.

It must be one that has attained to great love, that can love a deformed
creature. God is LOVE it self Io. 4.16.
: yet he is pleased to look on such a deformed creature as I; none more then I.
Therefore he shows it is great love indeed, that he loved me withal. Therefore I
love him with the same love, that he loved me 1^.
first.

I was a child of wrath, dead in trespasses and sins; a stranger from the
Covenant of promise; without God, without hope; far off from God; indeed I was
an enemy to God. Yet he was pleased to reconcile enemies: therefore its free
love, to love such a one; to quicken such a one; to bring such a one near, that
was so far off. It was love indeed, that made me love him. It was this, that
made me to see a beauty and excellency in him; which made me love him above ten
thousand worlds: if all the glory of them were in one, and given to me, I see
more to besired in him, in the least glimpse of him, then in them all.
Therefore I look on him above them all. When I saw him as an enemy to me, I
could not love him: But now I see him a reconciled God in Jesus Christ to such
an enemy as I, even I the chiefest of sinners; Which constraines me to love
him. (2 Cor. 5. 14.)


9. Q. Whether do you PRAY?


Ans. I do pray: but it is that the Lord would give submission to his will. As
long as I am in the body, I have cause to pray. I cannot forget to pray for
troubled souls, that come hither to me. But for my self, my chiefest work is
now to PRAISE the Lord, for what he has done to my soul. For Praises wait for
God in Zion: And for what waits it? but for Zions deliverance from her hand
bondage. Zion was a Wilderness, desolate, forsaken, forgotten of God for the
present, in her own apprehension. And when God is pleased in fulness of time to
manifest himself, and to show his love to Zion freely, and to marry her to
himself, (such a one as I was,) and to establish Zion on a sure foundation,
that is, upon himself: that though the mountains and hills depart, yet his
loving kindness shall not depart: then PRAISES wait for God in Zion: for Zion
then has answer of her prayers. Ps. 65.1


10. Q. Whether find you a tickling of pride or hypocrisy, when so many
people, and some great ones come to see you? Do you not ask who were the Great
people, when they are gone? and take pride in it?


[A like Question, and her Answer to it, was before. Another time when a Noble
Lady sat on the bed by her, and she was not moved at it, one whispered to her,
that this was a great Lady: She answered Its no more to me, then if it were
such a one: naming a meaner woman troubled in Spirit, that often came to her.]

And now to this Question she answered, No; its far from me. For if I were in a
Wilderness, where none came to me; I should take as much glory there as in
such abundance coming to me in this place Ioh. 5.44.
. For the Saints of God will give thanks for me in general, though they know me
not in particular. And unless it were some that I knew before, I know not any
that come; and I look not upon them, unless it be on some troubled people that
come: for I enquire after these: but I enquire after none else.

11. Q. How know you those that come hither, that they are truly troubled for
sin? For many will make as though they were so, but are not.


Ans. None knows the secrets of God, but himself. And those to whom he reveals
his secrets to, by their own experience they may guess at it, who is, and who
is not 1 Cor. 2.16.
. One that is indeed burdened for sin, its not an easy burden for them to ly
under: they would be out in it, if they could. These are weary of their sin:
and anything else can content them, but a glimps of the love of God, in the
face of Jesus Christ Romans 7.24.25.
. So far I guess then to be really troubled for sin.


12. Q. How put you a difference in the Trinity between the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost!


Ans. These three do all agree in one, and they differ not in working a New
Creation in the soul. They are three in manifesting their workings. For, None
can come to the Son, except the Father who gave them to him, draw them: There Is
the Fathers work, is give and draw them Ioh. 6. 44.
. For these the Son lays down his life, and receives them: All that thou have
given me, shall come unto me 37.
: I have kept them, and lost none. Its the work of the Spirit, to unite the
soul and Christ together, to make of twain one 1 Cor. ^. 17.
. Thus their three works are manifested to the soul. Yet these three agree 1
John. 5.7. Complut. Plant.
in one.


[ June 3. The Relator asked her further about this Mystery of Three in one. S.
Ans. The Father, Son, and Spirit are in Union: These three agree in one: and so
there is no disagreeing or differences therein: But there are various
dispensations to the creatures capacity; so there are three:

First, the Father, that in his love sent the Son Ioh. 3, 16. Romans 5. 8.10.
to reconcile sinners to himself

Secondly, the Son the Word Ioh. 1.1.
who was sent, that took our Nature; to redeem us from all iniquity and to
bring us to the Father. 14. Heb. 2 14.


Thirdly, the holy Spirit, who was sent by the Father in Christ's name Ioh. 14.
16. 26.
, to manifest this love of the Father, and of the Son, to the Creature: which
the Creature could not know, but by the Spirit of God 1. Cor. 2.9.10. Tit. 3.5.
Ioh 3. 3. 5.
, who quickens them that were dead in sin Romans 8.10.11.
: and he teaches and leads the soul into all truth Ioh. 16.13 -- 15.
.]


13. Q. May 31. was; Whether is any thing revealed to you, how it shall go with
the Church of God?


Ans. I know, and verily believe it shall go Isa. 3.10.
well with those that fear the Lord.


Q. How mean you in spiritual, or in outward things?


Ans. Specially in spiritual, I mean: and so far as it is for their good, in
outward things, God will dispose of them.


14. Q. She having said, that her sanctification as well as her justification
did proceed from Christ: Mr Adderley asked her how the proved it?


Ans. I believe that out of the side of Christ, did issue both blood, and water
Ioh. 19.34.
. Blood to take away the guilt of my sin: and water to wash away the filth of
my sin 1 Ioh. 5.6, 8.
. So that from my Lord Jesus Christ, does issue both my justification, and my
sanctification. He 1 Cor. 1.30.
is made to me, Wisdom, Righteousness, 1 Cor. 1.30.
Sanctification and Redemption.

Another maid that was not born in England, being in affliction, both in soul
and body, came to her telling her of her sad Temptations: (her words were
better understood by Mirs Sarah, then by the writer and sometimes were guessed
at, from the Answers given to her; ( viz.)
Maid. I am sore assaulted by Satan.


Mirs Sarah. Christ is lifted up, and held out to you, as the Brazen Serpent
was in the Ioh. 3.14.
Wilderness Though you are stung by the old Serpent, yet healing is in Christ
for such as you. Shall your sin separate from Christ?


Maid. I know it shall not, Romans ^.34.35.
if Christ were willing to save me, for he is able to do it.


Mrs S. Do you question the willingness of Christ He is your King, and he will
save you Isa. 33.2^.
. He is as wiling to heal you, as you are to be healed. He gave his life so
saving the ungodly, and sinners 1 Timothy 1.15.
; therefore he is willing to save them. Do you desire after Christ?


Maid. Yea I desire him with all my heart. I long for him.


Mrs S. Its he that works Phil. 2.13.
the will and the deed: he works that desire in you.


Maid. I feel that God is angry with me.


Mrs S. His anger is but for a moment: but his mercy is for everlasting. Isa.
54.8.



Maid. Yea, if I could believe.


Mrs S. Do you see a want of Faith? that's your chief want: If you had Faith,
you had enough: and this is true Faith, to believe that Christ dyed for you the
chiefest sinners. 1. Tim. 1.15.



Maid. I am a filthy wretched sinner.


Mrs S. Who was a sinner like me? Who was worse then Mary Magdalen Mar. 16. ^.
, then Peter 7.
, then Paul 1 Timothy 1.13-16.
? Yet they obtained mercy. Are you tempted against your life?


Maid. I am often tempted against my life.


Mrs S. Why, what causes it?


Maid. Sometimes this, because I am not as others are: I do not look so, as
others do.


Mrs S. When Christ comes and manifests himself to the soul, it is black in it
self, and uncomely Cant. 1.5.
: but He is fair and ruddy, and he clothes the soul with his comelines that
Ezekiel. 16. 6 -- 10.
he puts on it, and makes it comely therein: and in him the soul is all fair,
and there is chap. 4.7.
no spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing in it, in his account; because he has
cleansed it by his blood, from all sin. Its not you that do it, but Christ
that will do it: as he says, This is my Covenant Hebr. 8. 10 -- 12.
; I will be merciful to their iniquities; and, I Will give you a new heart; Ezekiel.
36.26.
I Will put my fear in you heart; I Will write my Laws there. Though the soul cannot
believe at all; yet he remains faithful, and cannot deny himself 2 Timothy 2.13.
: he says not, he will not, but he says, he cannot deny himself.


Maid. He may do this for some few, but not to me.


Mris Sarah. He does not this to me only, nor to our Nation only, for, many
Nations must be blessed in him Genesis 21.
. He came to give his life for a ransom for many to give himself for the life
of the world 10.6.51.
. He is a free agent; and why should you exclude your self?


Maid. I had a light followed me: but now he is hid from me.


Mris Sarah. The House of Jacob was the Church of God: and yet be hid himself
from them. Isa. 8.17.



Maid. I am a dry barren ground.


Mris Sa. Christ will pour water on the dry and thirsty land. Isa. 4^. 3.
He satisfies the hungry soul with good things Lu. 1.53.
. Its Io. 19.30. 2 Cor. 5 19. Col. 2.13. 14, 15.
all done by Christ already, for poor barren souls: there is nothing now to do,
but to 1 Co. 2. 11.
manifest it by the spirit to you. You know God has made you, and he bare you
up this while. Do you think any could do this but God? and has he done all
this for you. and do you think he will Iud. 13.23.
not deliver you? Did he Isa. 63.9. Ier 1. 1.6. Act. 13.17, 18, 19.
bear and carry the Israelites, that had be bondslaves in Egypt, through the
Wilderness, into Canaan, ( notwithstanding all their sins and provocations, and
hardness of heart;) and will not he bear you, and carry you, out of your self,
into himself though you be a bondslave to sin and Satan? He work and none shall
let him. Isa. 43. 13.
Who shall let the mighty God? shall sin or Satan? He works where he will and
when he will. Though he tarry, wait for him: for he that shall come, will come,
and will notarry. Abac, 2.3.



The Relator spoke afterward with this afflicted Maid; she told him the Lord
had given some support and refreshing to her, since that conference. The Lord
alone be exalted for it, who works all our works for us, Isa. 26. 12.
and in us. For what have we, (any of us) that we have not received 1 Cor. 4. 6.
? And where then is boasting? It is excluded. Romans 3. 27.


June 2. A godly man came to her, and told her, he was convinced in his
Conscience to come, to enquire the truth about an ill report he then had heard
and judged it was false: it was this; That some great persons having come to
her from Westminster: she being told thereof, that she said; A greater then
Solomon was there: as if she gloried more in her self, then in the work of
Christ in her. To whom Mris Sarah answered thus: If all that hear ill reports,
would reserve all ear for the absent: Pro 18. 17.
there would be less printing, and prejudice against the innocent, then there
is,
. Its far from me to glory in my self, but in my infirmities 2 Cor. 12.9.
; and to lie down in my shame, and to have confusion cover me. In my terror it
was far from me; and now seeing a glimpse of the love of God, it does humble me
thoroughly: which nothing else could. And now, if I should glory in this work,
but only in exalting Christ, it would be as great a sin, as ever I committed
yet: but only the sin of unbelief 1 Ioh. 5.10.
. The truth was thus; One day, amongst others that came, one told her, there
were some that came far, and desired to hear her speak, what God had done for
her: She answered saying; The Queen of Sheba came far to hear this Wisdom of
Solomon; but behold, a greater then Solomon is here Luke 11.31.
. Christ himself, to work a New Creation in the soul: To turn me from the
ruling power of Satan, and utter darkness, to his everlasting light Act. 16.18.
to turn a Prodigal to himself: even me, that was a bad, or rather worse; yet
he has turned me. It was his work to turn me, therefore he deserves the praise
of his own work. To cloth Legion in his right mind Mat. 5.15.
, and set him at his feet: yea in his bosom. It was his love indeed to such a
one as I. This I say, that Christ may have the Praise of his own work, and none
else: because he does it alone. This was what she said at that time, to those
from Westminster: and many mo being there is the room; and her voice, through
her weakness, being very low; whether some heard her speak but put of the words
beforesaid; or some that her speech was related unto, God knows: but some did
distract from, and wrested her Expressions; and then raised an ill report. If
the receiver be as bad as the Thief; one had need be wary, lest he receive
prohibited goods. Some other false reports, some have made, and others have
spread already but this may be an Item to all, to take heed, what they hear,
and of whom: and to warn all that are professed Christians, not to come short
of Aristide a professed Heathen; who used to lend but one ear to a party
present, that informed him against one absent; and to lay his hand on his other
ear; signifying to the reporter, that he would reserve one ear for the party
absent; and not judge the case, till he heard the other also. Shall not
Aristides, and heathen Foestus rise in judgment against many in our
generation, and condemn them? When we see how Foestus also would not pass
judgment against Paul being absent, though he had information against him, not
by one or two, but by many, and those also being of his own Act. 26. 5, 6, 7.
22.
sect and Religion in the main, and of special note and strictnes among them:
yet being desired by them, he refused it, saying, It is not the manner of of
the Romans, to deliver any man to A good name is better then great riches.
Pro. 22. 1. Pro. 25. 18. Therefore it is worse to rob or wrong one in this,
then in the other.
die, (so to judge him,) before that he which is accused, have the accusers face
to face; and have license to answer for himself, concerning the crims laid
against him. Act. 25, 15, 16.


June 3. 1647. She told the Relator, how the Lord prevented her ruin, about
Feb. last, viz. That one night she watched till her Mother was asleep; and then
stole out softly from her, taking the key of the buttery door; which she
opened, went in, and locked it to her, taking the key with her, so to make
surer her dispatch without let: and there being a window to the House-tiles,
she crept out, (to do like Judas, so cast her self down to dissolve her self;)
and in the dark she saw there a fire, and Satan as a roaring Lion in it: yet
still being persuades (through his delusion) there was no other hell, but that
she felt in her conscience; she went within a quarter of a yard of the edge,
being ready to leap down, when none should see or hear her; and nor was no
creature to hinder; then was this spoken to her distinctly; Thou shall not fall
down, and burst asunder, as Judas did, and so dishonor God that make thee.
Upon this, the sight vanished, as if it never has been: and she fell not down,
being thus kept from it; and sat down by the chimney there; and after a while,
beat her head against it, till it sweld abundantly: and the more she dashed it,
(then, and at other times,) the less she felt it. Her tender Mother awaking,
missed her, and sought about, and cause one to break open that buttery door:
and cry out, and there found her Daughter; who has not power then to leap
down from her; but when her Mother would have her come in at the windovv, she
tumbled down, her head falling on the bricks: which, with other such hurts
before and after, (she often so beating her head,) was one occasion of her head
and eyes so great weakness of late.

After that desparate attempt, she had secretly got a knife, and hid it, to
dispatch her self withal and then was she glad, and not so troubled: so that
her Mother hoped she was now better. And on a Monday morning, she desired of
her Mother, to hear the Lecture at night by Mr Carter at Fishstreet-hill, and
first entreated she might go see a neighbor; which her Mother granted,
hoping she now might trust her to go. That neighbor not being within, it was
cast in her mind to go to Lambeth-Marsh, (which she had also purposed in the
morning,) there to dispatch her self: and therefore had she taken the knife
with her. Over the bridge she thus went, and quickly came to Lambeth-Marsh;
There she went toward the Trees, and saw them dry without leaves, or fruit;
and thought, so was her soul, as they. She sat down by a ditch; and studied
whether she should drown her self in Thanies, or there? and concluded there;
because there it was more private, that none might hinder her. Then she
thought, (as she had often thought on the like sad occasion,) she must like
Judas, first repent, and then Mat. 27.
undo her self: as if that would serve. Whilst she was about this, two that
seemed to be Ministers, saw her sitting there alone, came to her, and asked
her, how she did, (for now they saw her weeping;) and why she sat there?
She had no power to conceal it, but said; I am not well, I am as sad a
Creature as any on earth. I see my condemnation, and nothing else. I cannot be
well, till I have taken away my life.

Min. Whither were you going?


S. Ans. I had thoughts of hearing Mr Carter in Fish-street-Hill.


Min. This is not a place for such a one to sit in: and by Gods help, we will
bring you thither. So thither they brought her. But as she went, It was put in
her mind to go thence that night to the Dog-house, (she had heared of) in
Moorfields, there to offer her self to the Dogs, to eat her up, that her
Mother might never hear of her more. But at the Sermon her Mother seeking her,
espied her: and she again hid her self beyond others: but her Mother again
found her, and had her home. This was but about a Month before April 6.
beforesaid, of her deliverance.


June 8. being Tuesday the Lecture-day there, (where Mr Ed: Richardson of
Yorkshire the Relators friend, was desired to preach:) upon occasion of two
Passages in his Sermon, two Questions were put to her. (Her answers were
suitable to his resolutions.)

Qu. 1. Whether persons that rightly believe in Christ, do not first feel
their great need of him?


S. Ans. The Gospel is the Ministry of the Spirit. He convinces of sin,
because they believed not: and what great need they have of Christ: and till
then, they never rightly believe. I have found it has been so with me. No sin
is like the sin of unbelief. The enemy is the Grand enemy of the soul: that
sin, is the Grand sin of the soul. Though it be the great sin of all, and the
damning sin; That yet Jesus Christ should not only bid such a one believe, but
give it to believe, it is to be admired.


2. Quest. Whether many are not worse, by hearing the Gospel of Grace in Christ
to the ungodly, and chiefest of sinners?


S. Ans. Many are worse, and many are better. The 1 Pet. 1. 25.
Word by the Gospel is to be preached to the world of sinners; that is, the
Word which became flesh Joh. 1. 14.
. That Christ came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his
life a ransom for many Mar. 10 45.
. He is not to be ministered unto by works of our righteousness, or our
preparing our selves first for him, or any worthiness in our selves, but to
minister, that is, to supply our wants: first the Spirit, and therewith,
righteousness, peace, and joy; which make an empty soul, full indeed; and to
give his life, not so sell it to them that have money, but to give it, to them
that have none: his life, no less price: a ransom for us bondslaves: that
were in bondage, to Satan, sin, and corruption: for many, for a numberles
number, that none can number; so they are indeed, if all be gathered together:
though but a few in comparison of the rest: for many are called, but few are
chosen Mar. 20. 16.
. Its there, for many; here for few. Many are called by the word to Believe,
and to Repent: all, where the Gospel comes: but few are called out of their
sinful state.


June 10.47. It being now above 75. days since she did eat at all: and full
65. days since she did sip or drink two days together, her drink being only
fair water for about twenty days: and since that, some small beer: and both
these only at once still in two, three, or four days; of late in four or five
days once; and then no more till about so long after; (she having never been
able to stir out of bed, since April 6. being 65. days, through her great
weakness, especially in her head, by her so beating it against walls in her
Terror:) and now she being very weak, unlikely to live, unless she took
somewhat; [except he who so miraculously had upheld her so long, should hold
out the same great power and goodness still unto her; she not having taken so
much as a sip of any thing at all, for four or five days last, nor so much as
moistened her mouth or lips in all that time: and had enjoyed very little rest,
for a week together, or more:] The Relator perceiving it now, (as from time to
time formerly) spoke to her about eating or drinking somewhat. S. Ans. I am not
hungry nor thirsty.


Rela. I have sometime neglected my body, till I saw I must not wrong the
Temple of the Holy Ghost 1 Cor. 3. 17.
: and then I durst not but eat, though I had no mind to it; because it is an
ordinary means of preserving life and health.


S. Ans. I cannot do it; I do not abstain out of wilfulness, for I would if I
could: nor have I any command or temptation in my spirit against it, as if I
should not: but it is, because I cannot. When I have tried, I am the worse by
it, I cannot digest it, and the smell of it hurts me.


The Relator durst not then further urge her: and being ready to depart; She
entreated his visiting some of the despairing souls, that had been with her;
and to pray for them: and for her self, that she might quietly submit to the
will of God, to live or dye; for she found not such contentedness to live, as
she desired, but rather longing to be dissolved, to be with Christ, which was
best of al for her. (Phil. 1. 23.)

So lie left her more drooping, weak, and pensive, then at any time; she now
to the eye of man, drawing near to death, as he apprehended, and was much
affected with it; and spoke of it to some.

But yet remembering some expressions of Faith, that she had uttered before,
touching the raising up of her body, as well as her soul ( page 33. 35.) he
had hopes the Lord would yet raise up her body, to the praise of his Name, and
the refreshing of others, that are despairing, disconsolate souls.

And now behold and see the LORDS doing: for it is marvailous, and worthy to be
remembered.

That day, and until about ten of the Clock at night, and all that week
before-going, especially (on, and) since Tuesday beforesaid, she had these
words following her, and still as it were spoken to her again and again: viz.
With long life will I satisfy him. ( Ps. 91. 16.) At first she took it to be
meant of Eternal life in glory, and rejoiced in it. But when it was opened to
her, to be also of long life here: She thought, that would not satisfy her;
and therefore she would not regard it: being so desirous to be absent from the
body, and to be present with Jesus Christ. 2 Cor. 5.8. a little glimpse of him
that she felt, was so sweet, she so desired the full fruition of him, that
she was not so contented to live, as was meet: and as now (having a sight of
it) she desired prayer for her, that she might be; and that she might quietly
lie down at the feet of God, to do with her as he would: that she might not be
so weary of the condition the Lord allotted to her. About ten at night, this
came in, as if it had been whispered to her soul from God; Thou have not
wearied me with thy sacrifices; but thou have wearied me with thy sins: Yet I,
even I am he, that blotteth out thy transgressions, for mine own Names sake
Isa. 43.22.25.
; and will remember them no more for ever: no not for ever. Thou art mine, my
Cant. 7. 10.
desire is toward thee. I will Hos. 14. 4.
heal thy backslidings; I love thee freely, I forgive all thy sins for my Names
sake; as though they had never been committed. Come and see, how I have loved
thee! How I have ever loved thee! Behold and admire this love of mine. Fathom
this sea of my love if thee can, which drownes the multitude of thy sins: and
see how I have ever loved thee from eternity, with an endless, boundless, and
everlasting Jer. 31 3
love: the number of thy sins, and multitude of thy transgressions against me,
shall never be able to separate the To. 8 35-39.
union that I have made between thee and me.

This manifestation exceedingly melted her heart; and the more abased her soul
before him: And she said; Lord, What will thou have me to do? It was
answered, as that to Paul, [ Act. 22. 10.] Arise and go into Damascus, and
there it shall be told thee what thou shall do: So (it was given her to
understand that) she must arise from that sinful condition, and go, out of
her self, to Christ, and he would tell her what she must do. And as he said
to Paul, (Act. 26. 16.) Rise, and stand upon thy feet: For I have appeared to
thee for this purpose, to be a Minister and a witness, both of the things thou
have seen, and in which I will appear unto thee. So God had bid her Arise, and
he had raised her soul from the lowest hell; and now he persuaded her, that he
will raise up her body also: that she might be a Witness of the Grace of God,
to minister to others, what he had administered unto her. And that as Paul
should be a witness, both of the sufferings of Christ for him, and of his own
sufferings for the Name of Christ: So she should be a witness of both in like
manner: and set to her seal, that God is true, in whatsoever he has spoken,
and cannot deny himself. And as Paul, when he was to live, and to suffer many
things; He said, None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
unto my self, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the Ministry.
(Act. 20. 24.) So she must not count her life dear to her self, no not her
being with Christ, which is far better then this life being confident, that
she should finish her course with joy: and now she must testify and minister
that Grace of God that she had received, unto others.

Other places of ministering to others were brought into her, besides that of
Paul. Another was of Peter's wives Mother, Mark. 1. 30. Anon they tell Jesus of
her: and he came and took her by the hand, and lift her up: and immediately the
fever left her: and she ministered unto them. Not to Christ only, but to
others. And so must she. As Christ himself came, not to be ministered unto,
but to minister. Mark. 10. 45.

A Third place was, Luke 5. 20. 25. where Christ said to the man that was sick
of the Palsy; Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. There he first cured the soul;
and then the body, saying, Arise, and take up thy Couch. And he arose, and
went, and glorified God; declaring to others what God had done for him. And so
must she.

Besides those three or four places of ministering to others, there were six
places more brought to her, of such as Jesus Christ raised up by his power: and
they were set on with power on her soul. One was Luke 7. 14. Christ said to
the Widows son, Young man, I say to thee, Arise: and he that was dead, sat up,
and began to speak. Yet she desired, if she might have a place to her more
particular. Then was given in that in Luk 8. end; where Christ said; Maid,
arise. And after that a third place, Mark. 10. 49. It was said to the blind man
by Christ's Disciples; Be of good comfort; rise, He calls thee. He called,
that won'd make him whole every whit. (This was suitable to her whose eyes were
so weak, and dim.

A fourth place, Act. 9. 34. Peter said to AEneas, Jesus Christ makes thee
whole, and he arose immediately.

A fifth place was, Act. 3.6. In the So Name is put for power there, Act. 4.7.10.
Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk: and he arose immediately,
and leaped, and praised God: So thou in the So Name is put for power there,
Act. 4.7.10.
power, and efficacy of the power of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk;
Jesus Christ makes thee whole. Then had she Faith given her, and Power
instantly, that she could arise: but her Mother being asleep in the bed with
her, she forbear, till her Mother did awake in the morning.

Yet there came one place more, (more full, more particular, and more
familiar,) Mark. 5. end, Talitha cumi; Damsel, I say to thee, Arise; and
straightway she arose, and walked. And he commanded that somewhat should be
given her to eat. Here was her Eating, Arising, and Walking. And a full
persuasion was given her therewith, that so it should be with her self. Thus
she lay, fully confirmed therein; not sleeping that night at all, but enjoying
sweet communion with God, till the morning. And June 11. when her Mother awoke,
and was arising, she spoke to her, with tears in her eyes, being grieved that
(through that foresaid pensivenes) she had not spoken a word to her Mother,
and thereby might offend her; entreating her pardon; which was sooner granted,
then asked. Then she declared what sweet refreshings the Lord had given in,
that night, with power to her soul, in behalf of her bodies restoring: and
named the several places beforesaid, the Chapter and verse, as they were given
in to her that night, so as they never had been given in to her in all her life
before; desiring the Maid that tended her, to turn to the Scriptures, one by
one; which she did; and read them, to the last: She declaring what power came
with the words into her: the last place, being, Damsel, I say to thee Arise,
-- and he commanded that somewhat should be given to her to eat. So now she
desired, they would give her somewhat to EAT. It being demanded what? She
would they should give her some broiled fish. Which was a strange expression to
them, from her, that had not eat a crumme of bread, or other meat, in 76.
days; nor so much as wet her lips for the last four or five days. But she
speaking with such power and evidence, they believed. Fish was got, and broild,
and brought to her: and she with joy in the Lord, did eat of it heartily
before them. And said; She did eat it, because Jesus Christ had sweetened it
before: Therefore she said, she found as much savor, and satisfaction, and
delight in it, as if she had all the dainties and delights in the world in
one: So was this unto her.

Having eaten, and been refreshed, and blessed the Lord; (not finding the least
distemper or inconvenience at all thereby;) Then she called for her clothes,
(who had not been able to arise, no nor to hold up her head any while in the
bed, since the sixth of April to this 11th of June, being 66. days:) Her
clothes being given her, she put them on, and arose, and stood on her feet,
and sat down in the Chamber, joyful in the Lord, receiving no hurt thereby.
When she called for the Fish, (as she said,) she had this apprehension cast
into her: Thou have fasted long; thou shall fast no longer; it was but to make
my power known to the sons of men, what I have done, and what I can do. (2
Cor. 12.9.)

Thus the Lord gave a prolonging of her life, by Faith in the Name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth. Thus by faith she did Eat, and Arise; and believed she
should Walk also. The two former she did that instant June 11. The third was
reserved to try her and others, till the Lord should see fittest.

[About the same time of June beforesaid, the Relator heard of one H. T. that
then had great enjoyments of God, and could not take in a crumme or sip of the
creatures, for full six days together; yet being in bodily health. It being
believed by many good people, the Relator desired to speak with the party, who
is of approved godliness; and did; and was certified thereby of the truth
thereof, viz. from Iun. 9. the end, till the beginning of Iun. 16. 1647. And
that both in that time, and before, the Lord had given in several discoveries
of things to come. Some particulars whereof were then related, ( viz. Iun. 19.)
It seemed strange to him. Yet he durst not then reject it, being related in a
tender modest manner, exalting God therein. Since this he has recalled.

1. That its no where said in Scripture, that Prophecy, or Miracles, or
Knowledge are ceased.

2. That Mr Fox in the Book of Martyrs, cites many Miracles wrought, and
Prophecies uttered, both in the first hundred of years after the Apostles, and
in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and so on to his time. The like do
Eusebius, Socrates, and other Ecclesiastical approved Authors, unto their
times. Mr Fox cites Prophecies of late times, revealed to John Hus, to Martin
Luther, yea and to himself. Besides other experiences he has known of.

3. He has weighed several Scriptures, that seem to hold out such things; as,
Job. 16. 8. 13. I will send the Comforter, and he shall convince of sin, of
righteousness, etc. -- And he will show you things to come: and Act. 11. 28.
Act. 21. 11. 9. Agabus, and Philips daughters prophesied, Act. 2. 13. 16, 17.
-- 33. 38, 39. with Job. 7.38. 1 Cor. 12.8. 10. 28. 31. 1 Cor. 14.1. etc. Hence
he feared to judge or speak ill of what he knew not, and had no experience of
in himself: But rather judged, he should try the Spirits whether they are of
God, because false Prophets are in the world, 1 John 4. 1. Rev. 2. 2. And
should admire the Lord in his grace to worthles worms: and should pray for the
accomplishment of the aforesaid Scriptures; as the Disciples prayed thus; Now
Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to thy servants, that with all
boldness they may speak thy word; (the means thereof follows,) by stretching
forth thy hand to heal: and that signs and wonders may be done by the Name (or
power) of thy holy child Jesus, Act. 4. 29, 30. and Luke 17. 5, 6.]

To return: Mris Sarah Wight arose from bed, and sat up daily, from June 11.
till the 25. being Midsommer quarter day. Yet she remained weak. Her Mother
and her self before Iun. 25, desired that such as had sought the Lord for her,
might solemnly Praise the Lord with her, for so answering prayer, for her soul
and body. It was concluded to be Iun. 26. When, behold, the Lord gives in the
third mercy before believed and hoped for, the very day foregoing it; that
their mouths might be the more filled with the High Praises of God, for this
addition, viz. that by Faith she was strengthened, (as before to eat, and to
Arise: so) now to WALK. And thus it was, (as her self related it the same day,
viz. Iun. 25. 1647.) The night before it, she was very ill, till about two in
the morning. Then was it hinted into her spirit, that formerly the Lord had
promised to her, that she should Arise, and Walk and eat: And as he had
performed two of them, in causing her to ARISE, and to EAT; so now he was to
fulfill the Other, in causing her to WALK. Then several Scriptures were
brought in to her, with life and power: amongst others, these; Act. 3. 6. Peter
said to the Criple, In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk:
and immediately he received strength; and stood and walked, and praised God.

Another was Job. 5. 8. Jesus said to the man at the Pool, Rise and walk: and
immediately the man was made whole, and walked. Another was Dan. 10. 17-19.
When Daniel was weak, one from God touched him, and said, O man greatly
beloved, fear not, Peace be unto thee; Be strong, yea be strong. He was weak
in Spirit, and in body; and here it is twice said, Be strong: and now he was
strengthened in body as well as in spirit; and he said, Let my Lord speak, for
thou have strengthened me.

Another place was, Cantic. 2. 10, 11. Rise up my love, my fair one, and come
away. For the winter is past. (With this Paraphrase) The winter of afflictions,
and temptations is past; and the summer of joy and consolation is come: and the
Sun of righteousness is risen, which makes it a summer indeed.

The last place hinted in, was Ephesians. 3. 16. That he would grant, according to
the riches of his Glory; to be strengthened with might by his Spirit, in the
inner man. This (said she, in relating it in the morning,) was spoke to me;
and I did believe it was so absolutely. And as Daniel was strengthened
immediately; So was I strengthened immediately: and was vile, and would be more
vile in mine own eyes, that the Lord alone may be exalted.

Thus she told her Mother, and another Christian friend: and said she had
received strength.

Having declared this, with joy in the Lord, in the morning, Iun. 25, being
Midsummer day, 1647. then she her self opened her head and scombed it: which
she durst not suffer to be done the day before, no nor for about twenty-four
weeks before; because it was so exceeding weak and ill, through her so beating
it in her former terror, that she feared it would not hold well together, if
it were opened: and of late she had not bodily strength to do it, till that
morning. And now, having dressed it, she neither fainted, nor got cold
thereby: but desiring her Mother, with the Maid, to call on the Lord, who is
worthy to be praised; she got up immediately, and stood on her feet, and
WALKED, Praising the Lord. She not having walked, nor had so much bodily
strength, in fourscore days before: namely, not since that sixth of April
beforesaid.

Thus the Lord the more fitted her for rendering Praise to his Name the day
following: And hereby he gave in to her friends, greater encouragement, and the
more occasion of High Praises to our God.

Iun. 26. the day appointed thereto being come, there met together Mr Barker
Minister in Garlic hill London, and the Relator, Mr Sprig, Mr Brag, and Mr
Isaac Knight, lately of Holland, with many other Christian friends, to magnify
the Lord with them. It was a sweet and joyful day to many there assembled:
Much of God was seen therein.

The Party walked down, from an upper, to a middle-roome, the place prepared
for the duty; she being veiled; the Lord having made her the more low in her
own eyes, and having the more melted and humbled her soul, by the greatness of
his goodness toward such an one: (which frame, the Lord continue to the end.)

The Occasion of the meeting was declared; Many of the most material of the
former passages of the Lords special providence, being related, in a way to
exalt the LORD alone, and not a worthless Creature.

Praises were then rendered to the Name of the Lord, which is exculted Neh. 9. 5.
above all blessing and Praise. In special with respect to this mercy, to
soul and body: and to the Glorious Attributes of God, manifested herein.

Some Instructions were also given, for some direction and furtherance herein,
both to the Party her self, and to her Mother, and to all present. Amongst
others, some from 2 Chronicles. 32. 25. But Hezekiah rendered not again, according
to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up; therefore there was
wrath upon him.

Whence was observed: 1. That the mercies of God, require rendrings unto God:
rendering the glory thereof to him. 2. That the measure of rendering back, that
the Lord looks should be endeavored, is, according to the benefit done to
them. 3. That all neglect of thanks or rendering again, springs from pride, or
the lifting up of the heart, that's the root. 4. That the Lords choice servants,
are very subject the fearful sins of pride and unthankefulnesse.] 5. That
the wrath of God is against [ pride and unthankefulnes: The Lord takes it
heavily, when his people walk [ proudly or] unthankfully. The first was then
insisted upon; which being opened, confirmed, and applied; and Praises further
rendered, with prayer suitable: there was then a time of bodily refreshing in a
cheerful manner, after the middle of the day, eating and drinking of what was
sweet and pleasant: (Neh. 8. 10.)
that it might not be as a day of Fasting.( Joel 2.12. 14.
) This was but short, and moderate; that it might be no hinderance, but rather
a furtherance to the main work then intended. Having eaten, and blessed the
Lord; further Instructions were given from the words of our Lord Jesus to his
own Disciples, in Luke 10.20. In this rejoice not that the Spirits are made
subject to you: but rather rejoice, that your Names are written in Heaven.
Where is held out to us: 1. That evil Spirits have been made subject to Christ
Disciples. [and so they shall be, Mar. 16. 17.
1 Cor. 6. 3.]
2. That the Prime cause of rejoicing is, that one knows, his Name is written
in Heaven. He is known there what he is, he is of esteem there, he has
interest there, and happiness there. 3. That even the Disciples of Jesus
Christ, are prone to be carnal or fleshly in rejoicing: and not so spiritual
as is meet.



Praises (with prayer) again and again being rendered in the Name of Jesus
Christ; and those for whom nothing is prepared, being remembered; (Neh. 8. 10.)
and Conclusion being made; the Assembly in convenient time was dismissed; many
being greatly refreshed in the Lord, who had thus exalted his great and
glorious Name, in causing LIGHT, thus to shine out of DARKNESS, restoring her
soul from so deep despair: and thus wonderfully raising up her body, that had
been long, to the eye of reason, ready to see corruption: And as her Brother Mr
Jonathan Vaughan, before her sowls enlargement, had writ from Oxford,
confidently, that Jesus Christ would deliver her: (as is touched before in page
5.) So he having been brought to London by a good providence just at that time,
to see it done, (as page 25. and 29.) when he was returned to Oxford before the
end of April 1647. He writ thence; That he made no doubt, but the Lord would
restore her body also to its perfect health; though then it drew not to death:
His words were these:

Most dear Mother, I am constrained to confess with thankfulness, that it was
an Almighty Providence, indulgent to me, which brought me home to you in a most
seasonable and acceptable time: in which have both heard and seen the goings
forth of the Love toward my choice and precious Sister, to be in love, mercy,
and peace. The strong man is dispossessed by stronger, Christ (the hope of
Glory,) now reigning in her. I make no doubt, but the Great Physician, the good
Samaritan, who has poured out into her wounded Conscience his wine and oil;
will restore her body to its perfect health: whereby she may be able in the
land of the living to declare the Riches of the free Grace and love of God, to
poor sinners. I came safe to Oxford, I praise God, etc.]

June 30 being the Monthly Fast Day, she went to Great Alhallows London, (it
being near Lawrence Pountney) and heard Mr Io. Simpson there, [hee having known
her soul in adversity, was desired to have helped there in the Day of Praises;
but was hindered by his Preaching that day elsewhere; Mr. Prime the Minister of
Lawrence Pountney had an impediment, that hindered him also, where he was
desired. [After the Fast-days Sermons were ended, her heart was drawn out to
go to two women, that were in deep despair, for refreshing them by the
comforts she had received, being greatly affected with their sad conditions:
And the day following, being July 1. she so went, to another woman in like
condition: (one of the former women, and this, having been with her several
times of late, since her soul was comforted:) By speaking much to them, and by
going so far, (about a mile (to and fro) this day, and about as far the day
before,) she was much wearied and spont; so that her body was in some
weakness, for some days after. And this was the more increased by the
resortings to her daily, of many in London, who would draw out expressions from
her, to her further spending of her small strength. Hence, that she might be
the more retired, and recover strength, for further service among the little
ones, that are afflicted, etc. her tender Mother has procured for her a place
in the Country near a friend there, a few miles distant from London. The LORD
has given her to enjoy much of himself in the City: as much may he give, has
he given her in the Country. We cannot leave her better, then in these
enjoyments, which are a Christians ALL IN ALL.

Before that her retire into the Conntrey, the night before July 4. which was
the First day of the week, called the Lords day, (it being but three days
before her removal into the Country,) she had a Dream or Vision; which left
so deep an impression on her Spirit, that after she arose, she wrote it down,
and related it to her Mother, and to the Maid; by whom the Relator hearing of
it, asked her about it, and desired to see the writing: The substance of it was
this:

On Saturday-night last, I was in a Dream, in great terror, and so quaked, that
the bed did shake under me. I so wept, that my face was wet, when I awoke. I
apprehended my self violently hurried down a very steep hill; and being
therewith terrified, it was darted into me presently, that it was the Hill
where the swine that were possessed with Legion, ran down violently into the
Sea, that was at bottom of that steep place. And as I was thus hurrying down
the same, I saw as I apprehended Horses, red and white, and black, and of some
other color, were running down before me. And being thus carried down a great
way, and through the depth of it and darkness that was, I could see no bottom
of it; being overcome thereby, I cried out to God, Lord help, I perish, I
perish; I am not able I am not able to go down it. And wept. A voice presently
answered me, I am able to carry thee upon Eagles wings. Ex. 19.4
) And instantly, one like the appearance of a man, (but the Glory of him was so
great, I cannot express it; he) came, and took me in his arms; and carried me
down to the bottom of the hill. And then he said to me concerning the the
appearance of the As good Angles are sent to and fro, Zach. 1. 8.10. So bad
ones go to and fro in the earth. Job. 1. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 8.
Horses, that were hurried down before me; These are all thy spirittual
enemies; and I have trampled them under my feet Romans 16. 20.
And then he carried me in his arms up to the top of the hill: and then, and
not till then, he told me the reason why he carried me, first down to the
bottom of the hill, saying; I could have carried thee at first to the top, and
not to the bottom: but thus I did, that thou may prize the mercy the more,
in delivering thee from the lowermost hell: and that thou may prize Heaven
the more. And he further said, I have gone before thee, and have made crooked
places straight before thee, and have broken in pieces the gates of brass, and
have cut in sunder the bars of iron: I have done it for thee. He that carried
me, and spoke thus to me, was so glorious, that its beyond what I can express.
Upon this I awoke, my cheeks being wet with weeping. And considering and musing
about this; immediately this was brought to mind: Wherein have I made thee
accepted? Is it not in my beloved Son, in whom my soul delights? ( Mat. 3.17.
Ephesians. 1.6.)

The Glory of this was so great, she could not tell how to set it forth: and
then was it brought to mind, that it is called in the Scripture, Riches of
Glory, Ephesians. 1. 18. Riches of his Glory, Ephesians. 3. 16. Glory of his Grace, Ephesians.
1.6. Riches of his Grace, Ephesians. 1. 7. Exceeding riches of his grace, Ephesians. 2.7.
In the morning the caused Hannah Guy, the Maid that attended on her, to turn to
the places, and to read them.

The Relation hereof was taken as is before-said, the 7th of July, 1647. being
the day of her going from London into the Country, (to High-gate,) to be the
more retired, that here was daily tired or wearied out, by many, especially
afflicted ones in spirit, that daily resorted to her. (An honored friend, that
would not be named, affording her the courtesy of the Coach, for her better
conveyance.)

The LORD having thus far carried on his own glorious work in an Earthen
Vessel, and brought things to such a sweet period; we may Conclude with joy in
the Lord; having heard herein of his so notable and mavelous a work: of one
he has brought from the jaws of hell, to the joys of Heaven: from such
Terrors (so occasioned) to such perfecting of praise, out of the mouth of a
Babe: enabling such an one now, so to improve and make use of the holy
Scriptures; to despairing souls, and otherways. Raising up not only her soul,
but her body also so wonderfully, by FAITH in his Son.

And now, Is this nothing to you, O ye that pass by, you that read, or that
stand, or sit by? Is there nothing that the Lord hereby speaks to your heart?
Mic. 6. 9. The LORDS voice cries to the City, and the Man of wisdom shall see
thy Name: hear ye the Rod, and who has appointed it. Has the Rod a voice?
Does the rod of affliction speak to thee? Do thou hear what it says? And
does this Work of Gods wisdom and mercy speak nothing to thy soul? If thou
would desire to make the best use thereof, but see, thou art not such a man
or woman of Wisdom, as to see and hear so fully as thou desire what it may
speak to thee; What honey may drop to thee out of this Rock: And therefore thou
desire to be helped herein, What benefit may come to us from this
consideration?

Ans. Much every manner of way, if the Lord will please by his Spirit to put an
edge to it, and to set it home to our hearts with a strong hand.

1 Use. Seeing the Works of God declare his Glory, and are for our edifying, as
truly, and as well, as any other Ordinance, as Psalm. 19. 1. Psalm. 8. 3, 4.
Psalm. 145. 5, 6, 7, 10.) [I say not, as much as the word, Psalm. 138. 2. but as
truly, and so as well as it, Psalm. 19.1 -- 7, 8. Romans 1.16.20. Act. 14.17. Act.
17. 26, 24.27. Act. 8.4, 5, 6, 7. Act. 10.35.42.]

1. That therefore, the Lords special works the workings of his Holy Spirit,
being honorable and majesticall, are to be sought out (as most precious things)
of all that have pleasure or delight in them, Psalm. 111.2, 3. Seeing he has
done them to be remembered; Why then is there a slacknesse in any of us, (who
profess we delight in God and love him,) to search out such special works as
these, when we hear some hint of them? Thus robbing God of that honor, and our
selves of that good, that might have accrued thereby: and showing our selves
like the brutish man, Psalm. 92. 5, 6. Psalm. 28. 4, 5. Isa. 26.11.

2. Use. That we think not strange if we hear of some in deep despair, and
judge not hardly of such, as speak great things against themselves: but rather
judge, what a burden is the least sin, if it be felt as it is indeed? This is the
fruit of sin: such may be nearer the enjoyment of mercy, then sinners in Zion,
that are at ease: and then careless Daughters, Isa. 32.9.11. Isa. 33.7. Psalm.
73.3, 4.14, 15.

3. Use. To be a Caution and as a Warning-Piece both to all Superiors and
Inferiors. 1. To all Superiors; whether Husbands, Parents, Masters, or any,
Officers in State or Church, to beware of urging any, by any means, to do,
speak, subscribe, or an any thing against their Conscience, or with a doubting
Conscience: though themselves are persuaded of the lawfulness of the thing, as
it was with her superior: but yet as you have heard ( page 7.) this was one of
the first chief occasions of this so terrible a condition to this lately
afflicted handmaid, for diverse years, and was no small occasion of trouble to
the said superior afterward.

2. Branch. The like Caution it may be also, to all Inferiors, to wives, to
children, to servants, flock, and subjects; against fearing man, that shall
dye, more then the living God: and obeying man, rather then God, by doing,
speaking, or acting of any thing, to please men; that the word or conscience
show, to be displeasing to God. Lest for your so doing, your terrors and
punishment, may be as great, or greater then those of this handmaid, for the
like offense: Yea lest God tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver
you, Psalm. 50.22. and lest both you and your Commander repent, when it is too
late.

I heard of a Maid in Suffolk, whose Parents feared she should grow too pure
and precise: and on a Lords day evening, the Mother bid her do some work: which
she judging unlawful, (or at least doubting of,) entreated to be spared in it;
but her Father threatening to beat her, she did it, and the next morning she
kept her bed; and so did she many weeks together upon it; being terrified in
Conscience, for her preferring man before God: being unfit for work, it
repented her Parents, and her self too, too late: I never could hear that she
got any comfort.

Also a young Gentleman, being a scholar, of whose deep despairing of ever
being saved, and of his strong persuasion that he should be damned, Master
Case, Master Whitakers, Master Chr. Love, and the Relator, with many other
Preachers and Christians, had notice, and sad observation. His Father a
Gentleman in the Country, brought him up to London to procure some to speak to
him, and to pray for him, having him present with them. This Christian duty was
solemnly performed by those before-named, and by others, in several solemn
days of Fasting and Prayer. The beginning and chief first moving cause of
those so sad persuasions was, because of the Oaths and Subscriptions imposed by
the Governors in the University, which he submitted to (with the multitude
that stuck not at them,) though he had his Conscience warning him; yet thus
doubtingly, or against his Conscience, he yielded to the Ordinances of his
Superiors. But his thus doing brought great sorrow on his own soul, and on his
Parents and friends that sympathized with him. Amongst others, the Relator
could more sympathize herein, then many others, in regard himself had been
much afflicted in Spirit, for his University Oaths and Subscriptions: and yet
had found though his sin abounded therein, (it being done with a staggering,
(or worse, with a relucting) Conscience,) yet the Romans 5. 20.
Grace of God had the more abounded, and been magnified toward him, in
manifesting that he had forgiven so soul and heinous sins.

After all means used with this young Gentleman, many several days, he
returned home more wounded and terrified; because so many had taken so much
pains with him, and he was no whit better; and therefore far the worse in his
account; as he showed after his return home, in many sad Letters, in black
lines, to the Relator; and because he could write no other language, but the
language of hell, (as he said) he therefore would cease to weary him with it.
And so he ceased writing. And although since that time, the Lord has given him
hopes of his love in pardoning his sins, and transgressions; yet these sad
examples, (and many more of like nature that might be produced,) may suffice for
a Warning to Heads and Governors in Universities, and Corporations; and to all
Magistrates, Officers, Masters, Husbands, and Parents, all Superiors
whatsoever; to beware of laying on heavy burdens, by Seeing OATHS should be
given and taken only in such cases, and in such ritae and form, as is
warranted by the word, of God (viz. in truth righteousness, and judgment, Ier.
4 2. Revel. 10. 5, 6
Oaths, Subscriptions, or Commands, on any persons; whose Consciences when they
are distressed, they are never able to relieve or release, from Hellish
continual fears and torments. (Psalm. 50. 22. Matthew. 27.3, 4.) To be an end of
all strife. Hebrews 6. 16.) Because of Oaths (so frequent not warranted) this
land mourns. Ier. 23. 10 Oh that Reformamation were herein, as in all things,
else!


And for all Persons, to keep the heart and Conscience, above Prove. 4.23.
Hebrew. Luke 12.4, 5, Act. 5.29. Luke 14.26, 27. 2 Timothy 4 12, 13. Heb. 10.26,

all keeping; Fearing God, above all

Fifthly, Learn hence to fly Censuring the most vile and desperate of all
sinners. Say not, they and Reprobates, though they are damned already in their
own persuasion; as this Party was. So was Mris Honywood, Mris Drake, etc. and
yet obtained mercy.

Sixthly, Be not weary therefore of using all good means for help to such as are
hopeless and desparate as these parties were. The Lord may come in the last
hour. He is not weary nor Isa. 40.28.
faint in seeking your good daily. However your 1 Cor. 15. 58.
labor of love is accepted of the Lord.

Seventhly, Limit not the Holy One of Israel any outward means whatsoever;
seeing he gave the Party Faith and glorious joy in himself, when she was struck
deaf and blind; that till that deafness was as one in hell already. But rather
believe the Proverb, Jehovah ijreh, Jehovah will be seen in the Mount Genesis 22.
14.
.

Eighthly, Exalt the Lord the Creator Isa. 2. 11. Psalm 8.1.2. Act. 3. 12.
alone, and not the Creature: Say not, What a one is she? But, What a Mic. ^.18
God is he? in all reading, and speaking, of her, or to her. For the Lord is
jealous of his glory, and will not Isa. 42.8.
give it to an image of him.

Ninthly, Behold here, what is the most effectual means of humbling the heart
and melting it; and of furthering faith and love; and what is the greatest
support and comfort in the greatest troubles and burdens about sin: namely, the
discovery of the abundant Ephesians. 2.4. Romans 4.5
Grace of God in justifying the ungodly; in giving his own Son to reconcile To.
5. 6. 10; Isa. 53.5.
enemies; and the love Ephesians. 3.19. Ephesians. 5.25. Ezekiel. 16.6.^2.
of Christ, whilst we were in our sins, and had nothing in us that is lovely,
that yet he so loved us, as that he gave himself for us.

Tenthly, and lastly, Let all such as read or hear these wonderful dealings
of the Lord herein; Consider how it is with their own souls.

First, If the Lord has sealed thee by his Spirit to the day of Redemption: in
the Spirit magnify God, and feed on him, and on his Sons love daily, in the
Gospel promises and privileges: And the more thou have received, be the more
humble 1 Cor. 4.7.
, and thankful to God, and serviceable to him in Is. 116.12.
the Power of his Son; and the more pitiful, and tender to others Tit. 3.2.^.
, considering thy self Gal. 6.1.
.

Secondly, If thou have no experience of such kind of speakings of the Spirit
to thee, or of such manner or measure of Faith as here is mentioned; (both of
which the Relator wanting, waits for;) 1. Do not decry, or cry down what thou
know not. a. Envy not others. 3. Be not dejected, because more is given to
others, then to thee: But bless the Lord in his various dispensations, that
best knows what kind and measure is meetest for all, (Mat. 25.15 Ephesians. 4.7 --
16.4.) Pray for more pourings out of his Spirit, upon his sons and daughters,
as he has promised to do in the last days, (Act. 2. 17. 33.38, 39 John. 7.38,
39.

Thirdly, If thou art of a sorrowful spirit, by reason of sin; fearing,
because it is so and so with thee, that there never was an effectual work upon
thy heart; finding such a power of sin and corruption; such dulnes, coldness,
hardness of heart, lazines filthiness, pride, self-ishnes, or the like baseness:
Does not thou so much backward, in toiling to make out the former work, and
still questioning about it, and how bad thou have been, and art since; as
forward, at that abundant GRACE herein magnified and ADVANCED to them that yet
are a far off, without God, ungodly, enemies to him, to unfitted unprepared
ones, to the CHIEFEST OF SINNERS.

Fourthly, If thou have desires after full enjoyment of Jesus Christ, and some
hopes that he is thine; but no assurance of it; Bless the Lord, and be
thankful to him, that has done so much for thee, that did more desire sin and
vanity. But rest not in such desires, but seek and press hard for assurance.

And lastly, If thou have long sought and waited for assurance that Christ is
thine, and yet have not attained it: 1. Beware of murmuring and quarrelling
against God, and by this Example; seeing how grieve to her son and her
murmuring has been. 2. Despair not because she obtained mercy, that was so
deep in that sin. 3. Wait humbly and patiently on the Lord, that hides himself,
that thou may still seek, and the more prize his mercy, when at last he shall
manifest it to thy soul. For therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be
gracious to you: and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy
upon you: For the LORD is a God of judgment. BLESSED are all they that wait
for him, Isa. 30.18. A power to wait, is also from him that bids you wait, and
promises, that they that murmured, shall learn doctrine, (Isa. 29.24.) And to
put his law in our heart, Heb. 8.10. Namely, to enable us, to what he commands
us. THE GOD OF ALL GRACE, perfect the good work he has begun in thee; (Phil.
1.6.) To him be all glory by Christ Jesus, Greek.
to - the age of ages, [ Ephesians. 3.21.] AMEN.

From July 7. till the end of September. 1647. she remained at High-gate, hoping
then to return to LONDON: having eaten no bread nor flesh at all, since March
last; and but very little of any other sustenance, through the weakness of her
stomach: and yet looks as well as formerly: At the writing hereof, in this
