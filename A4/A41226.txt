Factum OF THE FRENCH, AND OTHER PROTESTANTS IN THE SAVOY.
THat as well the safety as the glory of a Land consists in the well-peopling
of its Towns, and the great number of its Inhabitants, is a truth clear and
unquestionable; and that the union of those Inhabitants in matter of Religion,
is the assurance and security of such a Land, is another as little to be
controverted. Civil dissentions contribute not more to ruin a Kingdom, than
union and a fair understanding to the peace and welfare of it; by the one the
strongest foundations are shaken, but by the other the whole fabric is
supported and rend'red unmovable: and of all dissentions that can befall a
Nation, those about Religion are the worst, the most plausible in their
pretenses, the most dreadful in their consequences, and the first to be
provided against.

It was on that consideration, that the wise Queen Elizabeth received those
that in such great numbers were forced to forsake their Country (by the
violent persecution of them for their Religions sake) into England; although
the number of its Inhabitants then, yielded not in the least to that of our
days, assigned them Towns to dwell in, gave them Churches and Privileges, with
the public exercise of their Religion: and it was no doubt the same
consideration that moved the wise and excellent Prince, under whose Protection
we now live, by several Proclamations, to invite distressed Protestants beyond
Sea, to take refuge in his Kingdom, declaring himself their Protector, and by
many daily acts in their favor, confirming his pious intentions to continue so
still. If Kings are generally styled the Fathers of their Country, we may say
of this Prince, that he is ours in a special manner, for both in War and Peace,
he has been graciously pleased to protect us, allowing us a Church,
maintaining our Ministers in part, and by daily repeated marks of his good will
toward us, encourage our brethren abroad, to partake of the benefit of his
powerful protection, who flock hither in great numbers: and certainly if His
Majesty's Subjects did follow his pious and discreet example, we should in few
years see so great an affluence of Protestants, as would be sufficient to
people those many quarters, both in Town and Country, which are now not
Inhabited, for they desire but a safe retreat to serve God in peace, which they
are sure not to meet with in any place or Kingdom, where the Romish Religion
has any Power or Interest, nor indeed in any other Country, though of their
own belief, so well as in this.

Several great men of the Nation, after their Kings example, have greatly
endeavored to oblige the distressed Protestants of foreign Countries, to come
over and occupy the many waste Lands that they have here and in Ireland, and
their endeavors have not been altogether vain, for we see Lands that were but
a charge to the owners, become fast and fruitful soils to the owners, and not
only those worthy and charitable Persons invite others over, but favor,
countenance, and support those that are already here; our Church is often
honored with the Presence of His Majesty's Privy Counselors, Secretaries of
State, and other great Officers of the Kingdom; and indeed, it is through that
means that our Church does almost wholly subsist, the Contributions of such
French Families as are able, being very inconsiderable. The worthy Bishop of
the City vouchsafes to come there sometimes, who does so passionately desire
our good, as to maintain many of our Proselites, who might else, but for his
help and pious assistance, be in a very needy condition: for there are many of
them, and the Church but poor and unable to furnish what their necessities
require, though each of them should have but three, as they that have most,
have but four shillings a week.

The coming and continuing of Protestants into this Kingdom can so little
prejudice, as it must needs be of advantage to it; they come with an intention
to live and dye here, bring with them not only their Arts and Sciences, but
what Estate they have: we conform to the Church of England in all things, as it
is now established and authorized, pay double Parish Duties, which we are told
we must, Pigeon. Roche. Bollave. Gori. Isacq. etc. have convey*d their Estates
into France.
being strangers ^ now if (as the Papists who are in greater numbers than we)
we should speak evil of Dignities, infect His Majesty's Subjects with false and
damnable Principles, to draw them from their allegiance, and seduce them to
disobedience and sedition: or like them, get Estates here, then convey them and
our selves home again; so spending abroad what we got here, we confess that in
such case we should deserve to be as hardly dealt withal, as now we are: but
there is nothing less, nor can one instance or example be produced of any
Protestant, who after he had enriched himself here, returned to his own
Country, but contrarily, we leave what Estates we get to our Children after
us, and make it our business to fashion and bring them up to the ways and
customs of the Country, and they often so far answer that Education, as not to
speak two words of good French.

Now for our belief, it is the same with that of the Country, we own no
Superior to the King, but God only, and every where, and upon all occasions,
declare that he is not of our Faith, that will not do as he is commanded, Fear
God, and Honor the King; and if of late some have endeavored to persuade
people here, that the contrary is believed and taught by our brethren abroad;
we protest that it is an injustice, and false assertion, craftily given out by
the secret favorers of the Romish Religion, to render us odious to the people,
and further the interest of the other party, by an outward appearance of
desiring earnestly, and more than any others, the good of the King and his
people, though such persons are nothing less than what they seem, and do really
in secret, wish the destruction of both, as their Principles and actions do
too-well assure us: which occasioned King James to say, that he did not see how
it was possible for a man to be a good Subject, and a good Papist, a Truth
too-well known, and which the experience of many years has made good and
confirmed; for indeed the interest of the Kings of England, and those of the
Pope, being so different and exactly opposite and contrary; how is it possible
for a man really to desire the good of the one, when he actually endeavors to
promote, and as far as he can, advances the interest of the other.

These one would think should be sufficient reasons to oblige the people here
to a kind and loving reception of us, as formerly they did when they considered
the reason and occasion of our coming hither, for the free exercise of our
Religion, deliverance of persecutions, and avoiding of temptations, which are
there very frequent: yet we find so great an aversion in them, from us, as to
envy us the bread we get by our honest and hard labors, and would compel us
to return under the persecution we fled, or which is little (if at all) better
to dwell here as once the Jews did in Egypt, a kind of slaves to take all the
pains, and they reap all the fruits: a sad choice and a hard usage, which
cannot be believed by our brethren abroad, who look upon this Land as a
Sanctuary and refuge of Protestants, and who, in that consideration, rejoice
for its good, and take part in its misfortunes: yet it is true, that we are so
dealt withal by the Masters and Overseers of the Companies, who, to palliate
that unkindness to us, with the face of Authority, allege an Act of Parliament
in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, by which Act it is Provided, That all such us
have not served seven years to their Trades, shall be obliged to certain
payments, which they require of us, but that is but a weak pretext, for the
same Parliament, almost at the same time, invites the persecuted Protestants of
Flanders, and of other Countries, to take refuge here, with full leave to work
in their several Callings, which shows that other Act concerns not them, nor
consequently the Protestants at this day, whose case is the same with theirs of
those times. Nor can it be supposed, that so wise a Queen and Parliament would
only invite us hither to compel us to return again; for what else in effect
is the hindering of us to work and labor in our Callings, without which it is
impossible to subsist? and it is plain, that the end and design of that Act,
was to provide against a mischief of that time; when several set up Masters,
who had never served to their Trades, and by that Ignorance and small abilities
in them, caused great inconveniences.

Surely if Christian Charity did not oblige us to the contrary, we might not
improbably believe, that these men that harass and torment us, have little or
no Religion, (since they delight to afflict them that are afflicted for it) or
mis-affected to the good of the Prince and his People, that act so directly
contrary to the intentions of the one, and trouble the quiet and repose of the
other, or else persons inclined to favor the Romish party, since they do to
us here, as they do in our own Country: but we hope that those persons will
cease that usage, and consider that one of the main Duties of a Christian, is
to give Bread to the hungry, and that Hospitality is a Virtue greatly
recommended.

FINIS.
