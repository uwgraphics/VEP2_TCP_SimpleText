Godly new ballad, entitled, A dozen of Points.
A Dozen of Points you here may read,
VVhereon each Christian soul may feed.


THe gift is small, a Douzen of Points,
wherewith i would wish you knit your joints
^eep well the same, and credit me,
^hy life most pure and just shall be.
^he first Point's this, I wish you keep,
^s that at night before you sleep,
^ee still you ask God forgiveness,
Of all your sins and wickedness.
The second Point is this, I say,
Then thou do see the cheerful day,
^rise and praise the God of might,
That has defended thee all night.
The third is this that thou should require:
and on thy bended knees desire,
^he God of Heaven to be thy stay,
For to preserve thee night and day.
The fourth does bid thee to beware,
and to avo^^ the subtle snare,
For Satan with his crafty power,
Does seek men's souls for to devour.
The fifth good counsel does thee give,
And warn thee well whilst thou does live,
To keep thy conscience clear and pure,
Then God will bless thee to be sure.
The sixth of these my Points, do will,
That thou devise no subtle skill,
Whereby to work thy Neighbors woe,
Take heed, I say, and do not so*
The seventh says, defraud no man,
But deal as justly as you can,
The widow and the fatherless defend,
So God will bless thee to the end.
The eight does bid thee more or less,
Still to beware of drunkenness.
For drunkenness is abhorred of God,
On whom he lays his heavy Rod.
The ninth says, Fornication fly,
Those wicked Harlots will make thee dye,
Thy body they will consume, I say,
And bring thy soul unto decay.
The tenth does say do not forswear.
False witness against no man bear:
Let no affection sway thy mind,
The eye of justice so to blind.
The eleventh enjoins thee not to desire
Thy Neighbors goods for to require;
But the ten Commandments observe,
So shall thou stand and never swerve.
The twelfth says serve the God of might,
And truly serve him day and night,
Obey the King as it is thy part,
And to thy Country bear a faithful heart.
See these my Points thou do possess,
Even when thou thy self does rest:
Keep well each one in his degree;
And knit them fast, and credit me.
The Angel Gabriel, his Salutation to the blessed Virgin Mary.
Tune is, the blazing torch.


WHen righteous Joseph weded was,
to Isreal's Hebrew Maid,
A glorious Angel came from heaven,
who to the Uirgin said,
Hall blessed Mary full of Grace,
the Lord remains in thee,
Thou shall conceive and bear a Son,
thy Savior to be.
That Is wondrous strange, quoth Mary then,
I should conceive and breed,
Being never touched by Mortal man*
but pure in thought and deed:
Fear not (quoth Gabriel) by and by,
it is no work of man,
But only God ordain^d at first,
before the world began.
Which heavenly message she believes,
and did to Jury go,
Three months with her friends to stay,
Gods blessed will to show,
And then returned to Joseph back,
her Husband meek and mild,
Who thought it strange his wife should be,
untouched, thus grown with child.
Wherefore, thought he, to shun the same
he thought her to forsake,
But that Gods Angel in his sleep,
Gods mind did undertake.
Fear not just Joseph this thy wife,
is still a spotless maid,
And no consent to sin, quoth he,
against her can be laid.
For she is a pure maid and wife,
the mother of Gods own Heir,
The Babe of heaven, and blessed Lamb,
of Isreal's flock so fair:
To save lost sheep to Satan sold,
whom Adam lost by fraud,
When first in Edens Paradise,
the Lord had him bestowed.
Thus Mary with her husband kind
together did remain,
Until the time of Jesus birth,
as Scripture does make plai^
