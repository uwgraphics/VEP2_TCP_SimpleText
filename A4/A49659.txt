THE Last Will and Testament OF Father Petre's.
[1]
IN his Holiness's Name,
With Amen I proclaim
My Last Will and Testament following;
Who in Body am Well,
But in Mind monstrous Ill,
While in dismal Despair I am wallowing.
[2]
My Soul I bequeath
To the Regions beneath,
It has long to the Devil been due;
To be tortured with Pain
Worse than I did ordain
To inflict on the Heretic Crew.
[3]
My Body a Pledge
I give to the Sledge,
To ride on it to Tyburn in State;
And there in a Cart
Before I depart
All my Villainous Actions relate.
[4]
When the Rout I Have harrangu'd,
To submit to be Hanged,
And e're Dead to be Cut down, and Quartered;
While each Blockhead and Whore
Dips a Clout in my Gore,
To proclaim to the World I am Martyred.
[5]
My Politic Head,
With my Quarters, when dead,
Each one to be Perched on a Pole;
Thus by Prophetic Spirit,
According to Merit,
I Have disposed of my Body and Soul.
[6]
And next, I declare,
Not to mention an Heir,
My Executor wholly and full;
That hopeful young Spark,
Though at present in the dark,
Yet will shine like the Moon at the full.
[7]
My Funeral Charge,
As it will not be large,
So 'twill take up less room in my Will,
But was it much more,
Since I dye on this score,
He Will never be troubled with Bill.
[8]
It may do the Youth good,
For all his High Blood,
It Is full Threescore Thousand complete;
As 'twas gained by a Fool,
So I leave't to a Tool,
While the Church and Relations I cheat.
[9]
My Books, though not many,
For I never loved any,
He may keep for his private occasions;
They Are of Riddles and Dreams,
From whence I took Themes
To furnish my self with Orations.
[10]
The rest of my Stuff,
Since he has enough,
I bequeath to a pretty young Sinner,
'Twill furnish a Room,
To practice at home,
And encourage a hopeful Beginner.
[11]
I Will not give him the trouble
To pay the Priests double,
To pray me from Purgatory;
For that, like the rest
Of our Creed, is a Jest,
Just as true as the Song of John Dory.
[12]
For if there is a Hell,
I deserve it so well,
I need not despair of the Place;
And none but an Ass
Will believe that the Mass
Can ever restore him to Grace.
[13]
I confess there are Fools
Which our Church daily gulls,
And particularly with this Notion,
Who when they do pray,
Know not one word they say,
It Is their Ignorance helps their Devotion.
[14]
But I Am wide of my Text,
Being damnably vexed,
To see how we Jesuits are fooled;
And your Prospect of Peace
Does my Torments increase
More than losing my Life and my Gold.
[15]
On our Brotherhood all
May my last Blessing fall,
And on every Monk, Friar, and Priest;
May they, e're it is too late,
Partake of my Fate,
And become every Heretick's jest.
[16]
I would have enlarged,
But my Conscience discharged,
I Will here make an end of my Sermon;
And wish all this throng
May be damned, old and young,
And so drive away, honest Carman.
