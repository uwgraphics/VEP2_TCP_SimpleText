Advertisements touching the use and purpose of this Book, to my People.
1. THere be two parts of a Ministers office that undertakes the instruction of
Gods people: the one to deliver sufficient matter of distinct knowledge unto
Christian faith: The other, to lay down, and diligently to inculcate
Principles of sanctification, whereby a Christian may be directed in point of
duty and holy life, and enabled to discern between the state of Nature and the
state of Grace. Both these I have endeavored; the former, by drawing out the
general heads of Christian doctrine into particulars: the latter, by laying
down trials, and principles of sanctification and holy practice.

2. I intend this Book for the instruction of those that are to be admitted to
the Lords Supper, wherein they shall be publicly exercised three years: the
two former years to be hearers, and the last year to be answerers in it. In
which time it is hoped, that the meanest capacity will be able to attain the
sense, and understanding of the matter. And when they have been thus diligently
instructed, and the Congregation satisfied of their competent knowledge in the
doctrine of Christ; then upon a day appointed for their admission to the Lords
Supper, the said Catechumenes (upon their own motion and desire to be admitted)
shall make profession of their faith and repentance Ezekiel. 20.37. and in their
own names, and with their own mouths undertake that Covenant of Faith, and
obedience unto Christ, which at Baptism we all entered into, and stand bound to
perform.

3. I have prepared a several chapter for every week of the year, and
endeavored to make the answers as weighty and perspicuous as I could, both
which, as I conceive will be more delightful and profitable to the learner. To
every answer I cause the^ to read the proofs, one or more, as the time and
matter requires; within three quarters of an hour each Chapter will be
dispatched: if any thing be more lightly passed over one time, it may be more
largely insisted on the next.

4. The number and length of questions, will not be burden some to the^ that
be long exercised therein. The answers themselves are not long, if you observe
that they end where this mark [beginneth, and that all that is included within
this mark [] is added for explication, and not to lode the memory. And if you
express the sense of the answer in other words of your own, the answer will
be the better accepted.

5. There is some repetition of the same matter in the doctrine or
justification by faith, the Offices of Christ, the difference betwixt the Law
and the Gospel, which was not an oversight, but of purpose, the better to root
those main points in weak understandings.

6. This training up of our Children and Servants in a form of wholesome words,
will, I hope, through Gods blessing, be a means to prevent that gross
ignorance in them, which now reigns in aged people. The like fruit may be
hoped in the free Grammar School. The Lord grant you to grow in grace, and in
the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that both he that sows
and he reapeth, may rejoice together; and when we shall be parted by death, may
have a joyful and happy meeting in Heaven, and be united to our blessed and
glorious head for evermore.

AMEN.

CAP. I.
Of the state of Man by Creation; and of the Covenant of Nature.

WHat should be the first and great care of every man in this World?

Ans. To (a) know God betimes; to serve him aright; and to (b) provide for the
eternal salvation of our poor souls. (a) Eccl. 12.1. 1 Chronicles 28.9. (b) Luc.
10.42. John 6.27. Esa. 55.2. 1 Timothy 6.18, 19.

Q. What is man's chiefest happiness in this world?

A. It is to enjoy God by faith, to walk with him, to know our selves to be in
his favor here, and that we shall for ever live with him after death. [Without
this we are as miserable as the Beasts] Genesis 15. 1. Lam. 3.24. Eccl. 2.1, 11,
13. No earthly thing can make one happy Jer. 9.23, 24. Eccl. 12.13. Math. 16
26. 1 Cor. 15.19. Ephesians. 2.12.

Q. How shall a man attain to this true Happiness?

A. Only by the Scriptures, which are able to make us wise to Salvation. Ioh.
5.39, 46. Luke 16.29, 31, John 14.6. 2 Timothy 3.15.

Q. How are we assured that the Scripture is Gods-Word?

A. Not only by the Testimony of the Church, which cannot universally deceive,
but especially by the Testimony of the Spirit, working strange and
supernatural effects in us by the Word, giving us such joy, contentment, and
satisfaction touching spiritual and eternal things, by way of taste and
feeling, as is not possible for humane reason to do: Ioh. 4.42. Ioh. 6.68, 69.
1 These. 1.5. 2 Pet. 1.18, 21. 2. Cor. 4.6.

Four heads of Christian doctrine.
Q. What be those Parts or heads of Christian Doctrine delivered in Scripture,
the knowledge whereof makes us happy?

A. There be four general heads of it. innocence misery of man. redemption by
Jesus Christ, and of the means to partake of Christ. 4. How the redeemed ought
to live. [These Truths bring us to Humiliation, Justification and
Sanctification.] Act. 20.20.

Q. God in the beginning created Adam and Eve; in what state did he make them
at first?

A. God made them upright after his own likeness, Of the state of Man by
Creation.
i.e. in an holy and happy estate, free from sin and misery. Genesis 1.27. Col.
3.10. Eccles. 7.29.

Q. Wherein consisted the Image of God, in which man was created?

A. It stood in two things: First, in that Dominion, Honor and Excellency
which Adam had over the creatures. Genesis 1.26. Genesis 2.20. Genesis 9.6. [This was
external.] Joh. 10.34. God is the great King and Lord of all things, and all
in Authority do bear his Image. 1 Cor. 11.7. Romans 13.4.

Q. Wherein chiefly did that Image of God consist?

A. In Holiness and Righteousness, wherein man was like unto God himself,
their whole souls and bodies being filled with the fullness of Grace. Ephesians.
4.24. Col. 3.10.

Q. If Adam had not sinned, should he have died?

A. No: For death came in by sin, as the wages of it. Romans 5.12. Genesis 2.17.

Q. Also if he had continued upwright he should have been saved without the
help of a Mediator?

Of the first Covenant made with Adam.
A. It is true; for so God Covenanted with him, and in token thereof Gave him
to eat of the tree of Life. Genesis 2.9, 16. Genesis 3.22, 24. Rev. 2.7.

Q. Declare more plainly the Covenant made with Adam before he fell.

A. It was a Covenant of Works, wherein life was promised, upon condition of
his continuing without sin in perfect obedience. Romans 10.5. Gal. 3.12. Rev.
22.14. Do this and live.

Q. But could Adam at that time have been saved by his own inherent
righteousness? was he able to keep that Covenant?

A. Yes: For Adam was the Son of God, perfect in holiness and
righteousness, and Heir of Heaven, even as the holy Angels are. Luk 3.38.
Genesis 1.27, 31. Adam had a whole will no ignorance, no corruption to strive
against the Spirit.

Q. Can any man, since the fall, be saved by that Covenant?

A. No: Because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and
therefore must look for salvation by another, that is, by Christ Jesus. Romans
3.22, 23. Romans 8.3. Heb. 8.8. Gal. 3.10.

Q. Must any be judged, that is, stand or fall by that Covenant of Works?

A. Yes, all unregenerate persons; all that be out of Christ, be under the Law,
and must answer for themselves: for all the world, by the Law of their
creation, are bound to be holy and perfect, as God made them at first, and must
be judged according to that Covenant, unless they come to be in Christ. Gal.
4.5. Romans 3.9.19. Joh. 16.9. Romans 2.12. Ephesians. 2.12.

Q. Then all that have not Christ be in an ill case.

A. They be so; they have nothing to plead for themselves before the judgment
seat of God, [nothing to stand between the justice of God and their sins.] Ephesians.
2.12. Acts 17.30.

CAP. II.
Of the fall of man, and his sinful state.

Second head of Christian doctrine.
Q. HOw came sin into the World, seeing God made man upright?

A. By the first sin of Adam and Eve, who being deceived by the Serpent, did
eat of the forbidden fruit. 2 Cor. 11.3. Genesis 3.3, 4. Romans 5.12, 19.

Q. How did sin come upon all by that one man's sin?

A. Two manner of ways. First, by imputation, the Lord in justice imputing the
guilt of that first sin to all his posterity. Romans 5.14, 15, 18, 19. 1 Cor.
15.22. By one man's disobedience many were made sinners: as soon as he sinned
that first Covenant was broken, and the state of Adam and all mankind in him,
was changed into a state of sin, and misery. [In Adam all die, (i) the sentence
of death was passed on all in Adam, when as yet there were no more men in the
World. 1 Cor. 15.45, 47. There were two head men by whom all fall and rise:
Adam was the head of the Covenant of Nature, if he had stood, none of us had
fallen: And so Christ is the head of the Covenant of Grace, if he were not
risen, we cannot rise; we rise or fall with him, verse. 16, 17. As the
Righteousness of Christ is imputed to them that be of Christ by spiritual
regeneration. ( Esaias 53.10.) So is the sin of Adam imputed to all that come
of him by natural generation; For as all the Elect are justified first in
Christ their Head, as in a common person and surety, when he rose again from
death, and thereby received as it were Gods acquittance in full discharge of
our debts. 1 Timothy 3.16. And 2ly, the^ are justified in their own Persons when
as they come by Faith actually to be members of Christ: In like manner all
mankind was condemned in Adam, as a common person representing all mankind, and
as a radical person containing all that Nature which was to be derived to all
generations of men, Act. 17.26. Every one of us would have done as Adam did, if
we had been in his place. And we are in our own Persons liable to that sentence
of death, so soon as we exsist, and have our sour, sinful being from that
poisoned root.

Q. But does it stand with the justice of God to impute unto us Adams sin?

A. Yes; because Adam was the head and root of all mankind; we were in his
loins when we sinned, we were part of Adam in him, and of him. As the Children
of bondmen are bondmen, the Children of a Traitor are tainted in blood, till
they be restored in blood; so it was with us; our Father became a slave, sold
under sin, and such are we his children, till Christ make us free: Adams
sin was the sin of mankind, he stained and corrupted our Nature Romans 5.12.
Hos. 2.2. If adulterous Brats complain why they are cast out, the Lord bids
them plead with their mother; so we must plead with Adam: This is just in our
Law.

Q. How secondly, did sin enter upon all by that one sin?

A. By propagation; the lump and root of mankind being corrupted, so are the
branches. Romans 11.16. Genesis 5.3. Job. 14 4. [with our nature Adam propagated sin
and corruption] God made Angels all at once, and therefore the fall of some of
them did not draw all into the same condemnation: But God made all mankind in
one man to be multiplied by generation, and so that root dying and being
poisoned, all that come of him are likewise dead and poisoned. We were in Adam
two manner of ways. 1. Legally, as Parties contracting with God in that first
Covenant, and so were to stand or fall with our Head. 2. Naturally, we were in
his loins, so that whatsoever befell the humane Nature, it is Common to us; of
which nature we are a part: All the seed of man was in Adam, and therefore all
that seed being corrupted in Adam, we that come of him must needs be corrupted
also: we are a generation of vipers, Mat. 3.7. a seed of evil doers. Es. 1.4.
and young Serpents are worthy to dye, because of their kind, and the poison
somnesse that is in them. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Job.
14.4.

Q. What then is the state of every one that is borne into the world?

A. Very miserable, and in no wise to be rested in, if ever we mean to be
happy, Ephesians. 4.18.

Q. Why so?

A. By reason of sin and wrath, whereunto from the birth we are all subjected.
[That which is of nature, is common to the whole kind, if thou be a man it is
so with thee.] Ephesians 2.3.

Q. How long does a man continue in that sinful and cursed estate?

A. Until he be regenerate and borne again, and made a member of Christ. Joh
3.3.

Q. What is there in sin that makes one thus miserable?

A. Two things. First, the stain of sin. 2ly. The guilt of sin. [The one
makes us ugly creatures, 1. Sin it self.
the other accursed.]

Q. What mean you by the stain of sin?

A. It is that filthiness whereby the precious soul, being turned from God,
is defiled and become unclean. Math. 15.20. 2 Cor. 7.1.1. Jam. 1 21. Every sin
leaves a spot upon the soul, even those sins which men think they get credit
by; as the Pox or Leprosy does upon the body] therefore sinners are compared to
Vipers, to Dogs, and Swine, etc.

Q. Is it such a matter to be a sinner, if there were no punishment to follow?

A. Yes; for two reasons. 1. Because the wretched soul has lost his
excellency, being deprived of the favor of God, and of supernatural Graces,
Reason is man's excellency and Grace a Christians
which is the greatest loss of all. [When the soul is become a filthy stye,
then God departs. It Is worse to be a these or a madman, then to be in prison;
to be Nebuchadnezzar amongst beasts, then Daniel in the lions den; the
privation of supernatural good, is a supernatural misery.] Esa. 64.6. Levit.
26.30.

Q. Why Secondly?

A. Because the sinner can do nothing that is pleasing to God; the best things
he does, God abhors them all. Esa. 1.10, 15. Hag. 2.13, 14 Romans 8.8. Esaias.
66.3. Prove. 15.8. Tit. 1.15. [Every thing is marred and and defiled by them,
being dead in sins.]

Q. What is the guilt of sin?

A. It is that quality in sin, 2. Guilt and punishment ^f sin.
by which we are bound over to answer Gods justice, for offe^ding his Law.
[Though the act of murder or theft be past, yet the offender is liable to
justice twenty or thirty years after; so does sin, it lies at the door, it
calls for vengeance, as for its wages, etc.] Genesis 3.9, 10. Iam. 1.15. Genesis
18.20. Every sinner is a vile and filthy person: But that is not all; He is
also a guilty person, under the curse and wrath of God. Gal. 3.10.

Q. What be the punishments every sin makes one liable unto?

A. They be three. 1. The sinner is in bondage, and subject unto wrath and
fear all his life long: [Cursed in his basket and store; all the sorrows of
this life are parts and steps to the greater death; his sins are treasured up.]
Ps. 7.11. Joh. 3.36. Joh. 27.7, 14. Job. 15.20, 21. Job. 20.5, 11, 14. Heb
2.15. Deuteronomy. 28.15, 16, 17. Mal. 2.2. Zach. 5.2. Romans 2.5.

Q. What 2ly?

A. At his death he is stripped off all his comforts, and the wretched soul is
brought naked and singly to the bar of Gods justice: [The sinner while he
lived and flourished, was deceived and befooled; now death unbefooles thee, and
makes thee see what a fool thou were.] Heb. 9.27.

Q. What lastly is the punishment and misery that sin brings?

A. After death to be tormented with the Devil and his Angels, for evermore,
Rev. 21.8. 2 These. 1.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3.19. [This is the woefulness of a sinner
once come to his place, and this misery is everlasting, unabatable, etc.] 1
These. 1.10. has delivered us from wrath to come.

CAP.
Of the kinds and degrees of sin.

WHat is sin?

A. It is any transgression or swerving from Gods holy Law and will; it is any
declining from that Holiness and uprightness wherein God at first did make
man. Romans 4.15. 1 John 3.4.

Sin is either Original, or Actual


Q. What is original, or birth-sin? Of Original sin.


A. It is that hereditary corruption of our nature, wherewith, through the
disobedience of Adam, all his posterity, August. Confess. Art. 2.
(naturally descending from him) are infected, and are subject to the wrath of
God, and to the power of sin, being void of all righteousness, untoward and
unable to do any thing that is truly good, and prone to all manner of evil.
Or thus; Original sin is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man,
that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very fair
from original righteousness, and is inclined to evil; and therefore in every
person, born into the World, it deserves, Gods wrath and damnation. Rom
5.12,16. Romans 3.23. See 39. Art. of Chapter of Engl. Art. 9.

By that first sin, our first parents fell from their original
righteousness, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the
faculties and parts of their soul and body, and were the objects of Gods wrath
Now those sad effects of Adams first sin, did not rest and stay in their own
persons only, but are conveyed to all their posterity, so that from the birth
we are defiled with sin, void of goodness, prone to evil, and deserve Gods
wrath. And this pravity and nautinesse of our corrupt Nature, because we bring
it into the World with us, is called Original sin: See this opened in the
several Branches.

Q. 1. Are all that be borne into the World, guilty of sin, and subject to Gods
wrath?

A. Yes, by reason of Adams fall, in whom, and with whom we all sinned 1 Cor.
15.22, 49. Romans 5. 12. 14, 15, 16.

Q. 2. Are all likewise, from the birth, corrupted and defiled in their souls
and bodies?

A. Yes; we are all as an unclean thing Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3. Psalm. 51.5. Job
14.14. Romans 7.24.

Q. 3. Are we all borne into the world void of all goodness.

A. Yes; and till we be regenerated, we cannot do any thing that is truly good.
[Being mere moral and natural men.] Romans 7.18, 23, 24. John. 3.6. Ephesians. 4.18.
Math. 7.17.

Q. 4. Is this the condition of all that come of Adam?

A. Yes, of all, except Christ; and Christ is excepted, because he was
conceived by the Holy Ghost. Luke 1.35.

Q. 5. Why is this guilt and corruption called hereditary.

A. Because we have it by nature, before we know how to do good or evil. Esa.
1.14. Math. 3.7. and not by imitation.

Q. You see what Original sin is: What is Actual sin?

A. It is any thought, word, Actual sin.
or deed in our own persons against any part of Gods Law, together with any
evil motion of our hearts, before or after the consent of our will. Romans 7.19.
Jam. 1.14.

Actual sins be either of Omission, or, Commission.


Q. What is a sin of Omission.

A. It is, to leave undone any duty which we are bound unto, by Gods word; or
when we fail in the manner of doing the same. Mat, 25.35, 40. 2 Cron, 30.18. 1
Cron. 15.13. Esa. 1.15. Esa. 58 3. We must take heed how we hear, Lu. 8.18.
How we pray, Jam. 4 3. How we receive the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11.28. How we
give Alms, Mat. 6.8

Q. What Is the danger of sins of Omission?

A. The servant that does not his Masters will, shall be beaten. Besides, sins
of Omission make way for sins of Commission, they harden and estrange the heart
from God. Luke 12.48. Jam. 4.17. Mal. 1.8.

Q. What is sin of Commission?

A. It is, to do any thing which we should not do. [To do contrary to that
which is commanded or forbidden.] 1 Timothy 1.9, 10. Levit. 26.23. Ezekiel. 18.24.

Again, sins be either of Ignorance, or Knowledge.


Q. What is sin of Ignorance?

A. When a body does evil and knows it not. 1 Timothy 1.13. Genesis 20.6. John.
16.2. Acts 3.17.

Q. Is that a sin?

A. Yes: (a) ignorance is it self a sin, it is a (b) cause of other sins; (c)
and sins committed through ignorance are not thereby excusable. (a) Hos. 4.1,
14. 2 These. 1.8. Luke 12.48. (b) Ephesians. 4.18 Jer. 5.4. Psalm. 14.4. (c) Psalm.
19.12. 2 Pet. 3.5. Luke 23.34. Levit. 5.17, 18.

Q. What is sin against Knowledge?

A. It is, when we go against our own knowledge in any thing: when we know to
do well, and do it not. Romans 1.18, 21, 23, 32. Romans 2.21. 1 Kings 15.5. Luke
12.47. Jam. 4.17. Jer. 44.16, 17.

Q. What Is the danger of sinning against knowledge?

A. God usually gives up such persons to impenitency, hardness of heart, and
to a reprobate sense. Romans 1.21, 24. a Tender Conscience is a sweet Blessing.

CAP. IV.
Of the differences and degrees of sin.

A Gain; sins be either Voluntary, or Against ones will.


Q. What is voluntary sin?

A. When we sin of our own accord, (i.e.) when sin proceeds from the
disposition and inclination of our hearts, without force of temptation, Heb.
10.26. Joh. 8.44. he sins of his own. Romans 6.12.

Q. What is sin involuntary, or against ones will?

A. When contrary to the bent and disposition of our hearts, we be overtaken
unadvisedly, or through force of temptation? [and when there is no liking or
allowance of the evil which we fall into.] Romans 7.15, 16, 19. Luke 22.33, 57.

Q. What is a sin of infirmity?

A. When we be overtaken in some s^ contrary to our desires, purpose, and
endeavors. Gal. 5.17. John. 13 37. Romans 7 21, 22, 23.

Q. What say you of smaller sins, an^ sins to which we are inclined by nature
or custom; and sins into which men fa^ suddenly; Are they to be accounted
sin of infirmity?

A. No, unless we can say, that the desire, bent, and purpose of our hearts is
against them, the least and suddenest distempers and failings, are reigning
sins if they spring from a root within us, or b^ excused, defended, and made
light of Romans 8.4. Romans 6.16. 1 Samuel 15.21.

Q. What is a sin of presumption?

A. When a man will venture to do evil, upon a conceit that he shall repen^
and do well anough for all that. Number* 15.27, 31. Deuteronomy. 29 19.

Q. What is reigning sin?

A. Sin reigns when corruption remain in us unmortified, and there is not
whithi^ us a principle of Grace set up against it. [S^ that the evil proceeds
from an habit an^ disposition of the soul, where sin reigns Sin may
perhaps be outwardly resisted and restrained: as by laws of men, shame, etc.
But where sin does not reign, there it is resisted by a contrary principle of
Life and Grace, which striveth against the flesh, Gal. 5.17. as when one
stream is resisted by another.] Romans 6.12, 14. 1 John 3.10. Romans 8.2.

Q. How may we judge of a reigning sin?

A. Two ways. 1. Not by the grossness or smalnesse of it: nor yet by men's
violence in sinning: but by the power and sway it has in us, overbearing all
motions and commands of the Word that cross it. [When we are led by any lust,
or can plead for it, that is a reigning sin.] 2 Pet. 2.19. Romans 8.6, 13, 14.
Luke 16.10, 13.

Q. What 2ly is a sign that sin reigns in a Man?

A. When sin is not a burden to thee; when thou art unwilling to hear of it,
or to be discovered and reproved, that is a sign that sin reigns in thee,
Mat, 14, 3, 4. 1 King. 21.20.

Again sin is either against the Law, or Gospel.


Q. What is sin against the law?

A. Any breach of any one of the ten Commandments. Romans 2.12, 14. Romans 1.28, 29.

Q When do men sin against the Gospel.

A. As many as reject and disobey the Gospel calling them to repent, and to
believe in Jesus Christ for salvation, they sin against the Gospel; and so do
all that make bold to sin, because there is mercy in Christ, and also all that
slight and despise the means of Grace. Act. 7.51. 1 John 3.23. Luke 7.30. Act.
13.46.

Q. Infidelity then, and Impenitency, be sins against the Gospel; What is the
danger thereof?

A. Such persons must of necessity perish, there being no help left for a man
that rejects Christ: [they sin against the remedy.] John. 3.18. Luk 13.3. John.
16.9. Ioh. 8.24. Mar. 16.15, 16. Heb. 10.26.27.

Q. What is the sin against the Holy Ghost?

A. It is a [totall] renouncing of Christ, after some knowledge and taste of
the good word of life. Heb. 6.4 6. Heb. 10.28, 29. Mar. 3.28, 30. [Ignorant
persons, nor unbelievers, nor backsliders, returning unto God, do not sin
against the Holy Ghost.]

Q. Why is this sin never to be forgiven?

A. Because they think basely of Christ, and have no mind to return by
repentance, [they give the lie to the Spirit; as if Christ's blood were no more
to be accounted of then common blood, and not able to save.] Heb. 10.29.

Q. Is any, the least sin, venial in its own nature?

A. No; all sins, even the least, be in their own nature damnable, and will
damn us, if we repent not of them. Romans 6.23. Heb. 2.2. Mat. 12.36.

CAP. V.
How to convince men that they be under sin, and under the curse.

SEeing all unregenerate persons be thus wretched; how is it, that the most
neither feel, nor fear any such things by themselves?

A. 1. Because they are dead in sins and trespasses. Ephesians. 2.1.

Q. Why 2ly?

A. 2. Because they judge themselves by false rules, and so think themselves to
be something, when they are nothing. Gal. 6.3. Rev. 3.17.

Q. What be those false rules whereby they deceive themselves?

A. Many think, that because they are (a) baptized, and profess the faith of
Christ, and (b) live in good order, a civil, harmless life: Whatsoever is
short of Regeneration, is short of salvation.
perhaps (c) better then others, or better then themselves have done
heretofore: that therefore they be in good case: and yet an Hypocrite may do
all this. (a) Math 3.9 Romans 2.17, 25, 29. Romans 10 3. (b) Mat. 19.20. (b) Luke
18.11. Phil. 3.4, 7. Mat. 7.21.

Q. What is the true glass whereby to judge of our spiritual state aright?

A. The Scripture: which shows how bad we are indeed, and what we want: and
what manner of people we ought to be, if we mean to be saved. Jam. 1.25. Gal.
3.22. Mat. 5.20. Joh. 3.3. 2 Cor. 5.17. Act. 26.18.

Q. O but men will confess that they are sinners: and were it not for Christ,
they should perish: But how may it be made appear to their consciences, that
for all this their confession, they are under the Law, and not under grace?

blind and will conceits they have of God and of Religion*

Q. What be those blind conceits of carnal people

A. They think, that it is a folly a to be singular and precise, and that they
have b ever had faith and a good heart toward God -- c that it was better when
there was less preaching, and less knowledge, (such conceits discover a
graceless heart) a Mat. 5.47. b Mat. 19.20. Romans 7.9. Phil. 3.6, 7. c Jer.
44.17, 18.

Q. What other blind conceits discover them to be out of the way, and in a
state of darkness?

A. They think it presumption to say, a man may be a assured of his own
salvation, [and yet that he is in an ill case that doubts of his salvation] and
that it is no such b hard matter to repent, to have a good heart, and to save
God: and that c petty sins are not to be stood upon (as omission of duty,
lesser oaths, humouring of men and times, etc.) a they say they do their
best, and what would you have more?] All that thus think, do show that they
are poor deluded souls. a 2 Cor. 13.5. 2 Pe. 1.10, 11. b Ephesians. 1.19. Ezekiel.
11.19. c Luke 16.10. 1 Samuel 15.13, 14, 20. Mat, 12.36. Jam. 5.12. d 2 Cor.
10.18. 1 Cor. 44.

convinced that they be under the Law, and not under grace?

A. By the blind rules they walk by; for they (a) walk in darkness, being (b)
led by carnal reason, custom, example, and motions of their own hearts, and
not by the Word and Spirit of God (a) 1 Ioh. 1, 9 (b) Romans 8.13, 14. Ephesians. 2.2.
Ier. 44.17.6. And if the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch.
-- a Blind rule is a blind guide.



A. Because they were never converted; neither do they see why, or from what,
such as be borne and bred up in the true Religion should be converted. such
people are yet in their natural state] Ioh. 8.33, 34.36. Ioh 3.4, 7. Luke
15.7. Act. 3.19.



A. Because sin is no burden to to them; they were never pricked in their
hearts, not soundly humbled under their natural condition. [A man may find
many faults in himself, by common grace; but to feel and bewail the
rotte^nesse and sink of iniquity, that is in our hearts* the contrarieties that
be in our nature against God, and the workings of corruption; this we cannot
discover, but by the sanctifying Spirit of God.] Romans 7.7, 9.

Q. How fifthly does it appear that men want Grace?

A. Because they discerns not between precious and vile; as between the state
of Nature, and the state of Grace; between civil honesty, and saving Grace.
[Let them tell what the differences be] Number. 16.3. Eze. 22.26. Esa. 5.20. Joh.
3.4. 1 Cor. 2.13, 14. Spiritual things must be spiritually discerned; you must
not hear a Sermon as you would hear a speech, etc.

Q. How sixthly may this be proved?

A. Because they cannot bring you one promise out of the Scripture, nor one
mark of a saved one, of which they can say, this does belong to me: [But the
less they know of the Word of God, the better they think of themselves; and
the less they search their own hearts, the greater is their assurance: These
are deluded ones.] Sound Christians can bring promises and evidences, that they
are in the state of Grace: such as these, Romans 8.1, 2, 13. 1 John 3.14. 1 John
5.1, 2. 1 These. 5.5, 6.

Q. How lastly may a carnal person be convinced to be under sin?

A. Because they are not in Christ: this you must know, that it is not enough
for a man to do his best, and what he can: but if he be not in Christ, the Law
lays hold on him, he is under the curse: [No body is safe by doing his best:
Ephesians. 2.12. 1 These. 1.10.
the Law is a cruel Master, it looks not what we can do, it accepts not of
repentings, etc. but unless we be in Christ Jesus, it curses all our
imperfections.] Gal. 3.10. 1 John 5.11, 12.

Q. This is the case of man by nature, and of all the sons of Adam. What must
we do to escape wrath?

A. We must get into the Covenant of Grace made to us in Christ the promised
seed. Gal. 3.13, 26. Romans 10.4 Gal. 4.4, 5.

CAP. VI.
Of the Covenant of Grace; and our Redemption by Christ.

Third head of Christian doctrine.
Q WHat is the Covenant of Grace?

A. It is Gods free Charter and Grant, wherein he bestows remission of
sins, and the Kingdom of Heaven, in and for the death of Christ Jesus: [or
it is a contract between God and man, concerning reconciliation and life
everlasting, to be given and received by faith in Jesus Christ.] 2 Cor. 5.19.
Genesis 17.4, 7. There is Gospel in that. Romans 4.16, 17. Gal. 3.8. Deu. 26.17,
18. [The matter, covenanted, is life, the conveyance, it is a instrument and
mean to Ephesians. 15. Romans 5.21. Romans 3.22, 24 Ephesians. 2.8.

Q. What is the true difference between the Covenant of Works, and the
Covenant of Grace?

A. The Law, or Covenant of Works offers salvation to them that keep it
perfectly in their own persons, [that is, to them that be without sin, and
have a righteousness of their own, a personal, perfect, perpetual
Obedience.] Romans 10.5. Luke 10.28.

Q. Explain that farther.

A. The Law considers not what we can do now, neither does it accept of
sorrows for doing amiss: but it is satisfied only with a full and complete
obedience [If thou say I do my best, etc. that is no content to the Law: the
Law requires that all our works be holy, without any touch of the flesh.] Romans
7.14. 2 Cor. 3.7, 9. Gal. 3.10. It curses every failing.

Q. How does the Gospel offerus salvation

A. By the righteousness of Christ the Mediator; so that the humbled soul,
resting on Christ by faith, is justified, and ^ peace with God, though we be
not perfectly holy. Romans 3.25, 26, 27. Gal. 2.1. 2 Cor. 5.19. Romans 4.16. 1 Timothy
1.15. [This the privilege of the Gospel, that when we fail, yet if we
repent, and turnet God, God accepts our persons, and the greatest sin shall not
condemn us; (the Law knows no such thing.)] Gal. 3.12.

Of justification by faith in Christ Jesus.
Q. 1. Then Christ does not justify us ^ giving grace and ability to keep the
Law

A. No, for then Justification were a ^ works, and not of Grace: besides, there
no such (b) ability given to any living [Grace is given whereby we subdue or
corruptions, The Covenant with Adam was of works, though all he had was given
him.
and strive to please God, b^ not to fulfill the Law perfectly] (a) Ephesians. 7, 8,
9, 10. (b) 1 John 1.8, 9. Act. 5.31. Ac^ 15.11. That which I fetch with my
pen^^ is not a gift; but our righteousness is (...) gift. Romans 5.17.

Q. 2. Does he save us by joining (...) merits to our works, as if we were
justified partly by works, and partly by fai^^ in Christ?

A. No; we are justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law; and Christ
will not have any to bejoyned with him in that business. Romans 3.21, 27, 28.
Romans 11.6. Esa. 64.6. Jer. 23.6 Esa. 63.3. Romans 4 5, 6. Heb. 7.25. Heb. 9.26
Gal. 5.4. To a sinners justification, Christ is all in all* or none at all.

Q. 3. Does the New Covenant save as, by changing the condition of works into
faith, and sincere obedience; as if the act of believing and obeying, should be
in stead of perfect obedience to the Law?

A. By no means; The righteousness by which we are justified is, 1. The
righteousness of a God. 2. Imputed to us, residing in the person of Christ. 3.
Every way able to answer the Law. See Phil. 39, 2 Cor. 5.21. To 3.21, 22, 26.
But our faith and sincere obedience is. 1. But the righteousness of a man 2.
Inherent, no^ imputed. 3. No way able to answer the Law. The New Covenant does
not change works into works; works perfect incomplete, i^to works
imperfect* But it changes works of our own performing, into works performed
for us by Christ.
for faith does not justify, as it is a grace wrought in us, and working in
us; but as it is an instrument whereby the soul lays hold on Christ: ['Tis
the object of faith that saves us: God gives Christ, and thou must receive
him, and the hand to take him is faith. Heb. 10.10. Romans 9.32. with Romans 10.3,
4. Joh 6.35. Joh. 1.12. 1 John 5 11, 12. Col. 1.20. Romans 4.5, 6, 7, 16. The
righteousness of Christ is the only righteousness by which we stand
justified before God: and Faith is the only Means by which Christ's
righteousness is made ours: and this faith does justify, not as it acts upon
our heart^ to subdue lusts, but as it acts upon Christ's blood: as the meat
that is eate^^ does feed, and the medicine received does cure the disease: even
so he that eats me, shall live by me, says Christ, Joh. 6* 57.

Q. You say that you cannot be save by the Law: What then is the only way left
to inherit eternal life?

A. Christ is the way, the truth, and the life: He was made sin for us, that
w^ might be made the righteousness of Go^ in him. John. 14.6. 2 Cor. 5.21. 1
Cor. 1.3^ [This is the Covenant of Grace: this (...) the Word of eternal
life.] Joh. 6.68.

Q. When was this Covenant first mad^ with mankind.

A In (a) Paradise, immediately afte^ the fall of Adam: and it was renewed (b^
with Abraham, declared by Moses (c) an^ the Prophets, till at last it was
confirm by the death of Christ the promiser an^ testator (a) Heb. 11.4. Genesis
3.14. (b) Gen* 17.4, 11. (c) Exodus 24.8. Heb. 9.19, 20. Ga^ 3.16, 17.

Q. Were the Fathers, before the comeing of Christ, saved by faith in him?

A. Yes: we and they do all drink of the same Spiritual Rock, which is
Christ: being all children of faith and of the promise. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3. Romans
4.12. Romans 9.8. Gal. 3.29. Heb. 11.4. Heb. 9.15. Romans 1.1, 2. with 1 Pet. 3.18,
19. 1 Pet. 4.6.

Q. Then the Old and New Testament be all one for substance?

A. They are so: Christ is the substance of both: and they are but several
ways of setting down the Covenant of Grace: the one teaching to believe in
Christ that was to come: the other showing more clearly all things fulfilled in
Christ now come, [according as was promised and prefigured.]

Q. By this it appears that the Covenant of Grace is a most free Covenant, not
grounded upon any condition on our parts: not upon any thing that we can do,
or suffer.

A. It is a most free and gracious Covenant: all the promises be made good to
us in Christ: Ephesians. 3.12. 2 Cor. 1^.20. 2 Timothy 1.^.
and we have nothing to do but to embrace Christ: and that grace also God
promises to work in us. The Covenant of works was conditional, grounded on
man's own obedience: This New Covenant, whereby we are restored again into
Gods favor, is called a Covenant of Grace; because the remission of sins, the
favor of God, and life everlasting, are the free gift of God, given us in
Christ, not for any thing in us or done by us, but for the only obedience o^
Jesus Christ the Mediator, Ephesians 2.8. To. 5.21. When once we have Christ by
Faith, we are made New Creatures, to bring forth fruit unto God. Ephesians. 2.10. Rom
7.4. But we can challenge nothing of justification and life, as a debt, or as
from the hand of justice, but only as as mere gift of grace Go^ does perform
all things to us; not for anything is us, but for his Christ. And tho^
conditional expressions, If ye mortify the deed of the flesh, ye shall live,
etc. such promises do tell us who shall live not why they shall live. Lastly,
that first Covenant is mended; Christ the Mediator o^ the New Covenant makes it
good, by enabling, us to perform the condition thereof, which Moses could not
do: he gave the Law, but could not give grace^ etc. Jer. 31.33. Heb. 8.9, 10.
Deuteronomy. 5.27, 29. Heb 7.22.

CAP. VII.
Of promises to Christ the Mediator, the Head of the Covenant of Grace.

IN the Covenant of Grace there be three parties contracting and covenanting.
1. God, the party offended. 2ly, Man, the party offending, and to be
reconciled. 3ly, Christ the reconciler and peacemaker between them both.

Q. The first party contracting in this New Covenant, is, God himself: The
first Party in the New Covenant.
What has he done for Mankind?

A. The Lord has done three gracious Acts for us; His goodness and love
toward us appears in three things.

Q. 1. What is the first gracious act of God in this Covenant of peace?

A. It is the free giving of his Son to take our nature, that he might redeem
us. It was the Fathers will he should have a body, and the Sons willingness to
undertake it. Heb. 5.4, 5. Heb. 10.5, 7, 9. Joh. 3.16. Esa. 9.6.

Q. 2. What is the second gracious Act of God in this New Covenant?

A. God has established the Covenant of our Redemption in and with his Son
Jesus Christ: 2 Cor. 5.19. God in Christ reconciling, etc.
[God did not send his Son empty into the world, but furnished him with
Testimonies and promises of his favor for the comfort of Christ himself, and
o^ us his people. Joh. 10.36. Heb. 1.6. Ther^ was a Covenant betwixt God and
Christ our head, touching the work of Redemption; the Lord promising some
things ^ Christ, and requiring some things o^ Christ.] 1 Timothy 3.16. Gal: 3.16,
19. Ge^ 12.3.

Q. How many sorts of promises there in the New Covenant?

A. Two sorts, some be made to Christ the Mediator: and some unto all suc^
persons as do, or shall embrace Christ offered unto them.

Q. What things did God promise^ Christ Himself, Of Gods promises to Christ.
as our Head and Medi^tor?

A. Three things. 1. God promised to ^ to him a Father; to fill him with the
Holy Ghost, and with power to go through with the work of our redemption. Heb.
5, 6. Act. 10.38. Ep 1.22. Esa. 11.2. Esa. 49.

Q. What 2ly does God promise to him

A. 2. God promises him acceptance, vict^ry, and success in all his
undertakings (...) man, Mat. 3.17. Ioh. 5.20, 21. Esaias 42.6. and 53.11. Act.
2.27.

Q. In what particulars shall Christ have success, and power to bless his
people?

A. In five particulars. I God says to him, Thou shall a teach them, 1.
Conversion. 2. Adoption. 3. Sanctification.
and turn them to the Lord. 2ly Thou b shall make them my sons and
daughters. 3ly And thou c shall have the spirit to bestow on them. a Mal 4.6.
Luke 1.16, 17. Ioh 6.45. Esaias 61 1, 2. b Ioh: 6.40. and 1.12. c and 15.26 Luke
24.49.

Q. In what else shall Christ have success?

A. 4ly Thou shall a give them peace whilst they live in this world. 4. Peace
in our justification. 5. Glorification.
5ill And b raise them up at the last day to eternal glory. a Ioh: 10.16, 28,
29. and 14.27. and 16.33. b Ioh. 6.37, 40. Rom 8.11.

Q These are Gods promises to his Son: What did God require of him when he gave
him to be Head and Covenant to his people?

A. God said, Thou must a have a body prepared thee, wherein to do my will;
Thou b must be a servant, a man of sorrows, to bear man's transgressions; thou
must die, and be made an offering for their sins. a Heb. 10.7. Gal. 4.4, 5. b
Esaias 53.5, 6, 10 Phil. 2.8. Heb: 2.10. Luke 24.46.

Q. Christ was content to do all this. What lastly, did God for him upon the
performance thereof?

A. He highly exalted him above every name, and anointed him with the oil of
gladness above his fellows; thereby testifying, that he is well pleased and
satisfied with Christ's performances for us. Phil. 2.9 Heb. 1.3, 4, 5, 9. Psalm.
45.7. Esaias 53.12. 1 Timothy 3.16.

Q. What have we to consider in this work of God toward mankind?

A. His sweet and unspeakable love; that when it was not in the power of any
creature to devise a way, he provided a price out of his own store to redeem
us, Esaias 59 6. Ephesians. 3.10, 18. 2 Cor. 5, 19: to himself, etc.

Q. Why did God thus article with Christ our Head?

A. It is for our consolation and assurance, that God does capitulate with
Christ our head, in the name of the elect; because now all is sure, God cannot
break with his own Son, 2 Cor. 1.20, 21. Gal 3.16. Ephe. 1.3. Joh: 20.17. [He
is first Christ's Father, and then ours, 1 Pet: 1.21. John. 16.10. Christ will
see the Covenant performed on both parts, viz: all that God promises to us,
shall be made good to us; and all that man ought to do, he has done for us,
and in us, our righteousness is placed in the person of Christ, and so it is
in a safe hand, where we shall be sure to find, and have it, when we have most
need of it. Our righteousness is not in our own keeping, as it was in the
first Covenant.

CAP. VIII.
Of Christ offered to Sinners, as yet unconverted; and of the ground of a
Sinners going to Christ.

Q. WE have seen the promises made to Christ the Mediator. What is the third
gracious Act of God the Father in this New Covenant?

A. The Lord offers Christ to all sinners, and with him, all things that
pertain to life and godliness. 2 Pet. 1.3. Romans 8 32. Luke 24.44. Mar. 16.15.

Q. Show particularly what promises God has made to mankind, Of Gods promises
to mankind.
in and with his Son Jesus Christ?

A. Some belong to sinners that be as yet out of Christ; that so of
unbelievers, they may be made believers. And some be peculiar to them that do
embrace Christ, [and be in covenant with him.]

Q. Are there any promises made to a man not yet in the state of Grace, to
unbeliever?

God considers not what thou have been heretofore; Come in now, embrace Christ
and live.
A. Yes: Christ, with all his riches and promises, is offered to poor sinners,
of what sort soever they be absolutely, without any former condition in
themselves; and freely, for just nothing. [Any that will may take him.] Esa.
55.8. Rev. 22.17. Luk 14.16, 21, 23. Joh. 7.37. Esa. 61.1, 3. Ezekiel. 16.6. Buy
without money, etc.

Q. Are such invited to take Christ, as have nothing in them but sin and
wretchedness? May they meddle with Christ?

A. Yes: And he is fittest for Christ, that does most loath himself, and sees
least goodness in himself. Mat 9.13. Luke 18.9, 11, 13, 21.

Q. Declare that more largely.

A. All that come to Christ, must come with an heart a emptied of all conceits
of goodness; having a vile esteem, not only of their sins, but of their
best righteousness b and moralities, and performances of their unregenerate
time. a Phil. 3.4, 6, 8. Luke 1.53. Mat. 19.20, 21. Math. 13.44. b Math. 3.9.
Esa. 64.6. Romans 7.9, 18. Jer. 9.26. Romans 2.28.

Q. Some sinners be more notorious then others: May all come to Christ?

A. Yes; every one that is weary of his sins, and willing to be friends with
God. [No man's sins do shut him out from Christ: Christ calls sinners, the
Devil makes sin to be a bar to shut out a sinner from coming to Christ.]
Mat. 11.28. Luke 15.2, 7, 21, 22. Esa. 55.7, 8.

Q. Upon what grounds may a sinner be bold to go to Christ to find mercy?

A. God does not only offer Christ, with all his merits, but also a inviteth,
and have been heretofore. Mat. 11.28. b 2 Cor. 5.20. c 1 John 3.23. Luke
14.23. d Joh. 6.37. Luke 15.19, 20. This is the key of the Gospel to let
sinners into Christ; to make a believer of an unbeliever: It is a cable cast
out to us, whereby to pluck our selves to shore, as men do that are fallen
into the water.]

Q. What is the poor sinners duty now?

A. To take Christ thus offered, and pressed upon him by God: But if thou
reject him, thou do justly perish: [Thou must accept Christ for thy Lord and
Savior.] John 16.8, 9. Luke 14.18 24.

Q. O but what comfort has the soul to go to God, till we know our selves to
be in Christ, and in the state of Grace?

A. Promises are not offered to believers only, but laid as the foundations of
Faith: we go to God, not from being pardoned, but to be pardoned; not from
assurance, but for assurance: And for your so doing, you have grounds and
comfort enough in Gods promises, and Christ's call: Thy assurance is not the
ground of thy going to God, but Gods invitation, and promises, Romans 10.12.
Mark. 16.15. Ephesians. 1.13. Heb. 11.6. The sad soul, though he go to God
trembling, yet he goes believingly: It is faith that sends the soul a begging
unto God.

Q. All that seem to fly to Christ, do not accept of him aright: How may I
know that I do it aright?

A. As the Wife takes the Husband to be her head, to stick to him, to obey him:
so must thou take Christ to be thy head and husband, thy King and Savior, upon
any terms: [If thou can say, I will have Christ what ere it cost me, that
is a true accepting of Christ. [ Luke 14.28, 33. and 16.13. Mat. 10.37. [this
is the whole nature of faith, to know him, to accept him for our Lord and
Savior, What Faith is.
and to rest on him. Ephesians. 1.13.

Q. What follows hereof?

A. By this we have an entrance and right unto all the promises made to the
Elect in Christ, 1 Pet. 1.21. Ephesians. 2.18. 2 Pet. 1.11.

and give you peace: if any thirst, I will fill him with good things, etc. And
because all this shall be sure to you, I will frame your hearts to love me; I
will be your teacher; you shall be able to discern between precious and vile;
when you fall, I will not suffer you to fall away: I will hear your prayers, I
will give you victory over Satan, and after all I will bring you to glory. This
portion you shall have with my Christ.]

Q. How does God confirm all these promises to us? In whom are they sure?

1.2. 2 Timothy 1.1.

CAP. X.
Of Christ the Mediator of the New Test^ment; and first of his wonderful
person, God and man, and the Benefits flowing from that personal union.

YOu have seen what God has do^ for us, viz. given his Son; offered hi^ to
sinners, with rich and large promis^ to them that recieve him. The secon^ party
in the New Covenant is Christ the Mediator. The second party in the New
Covenant.
Of this Mediator we are to consider two things: 1. His person. 2. H^
undertaking and office.

Q. All the promises of God have the Yea and Amen in Christ: Who is Christ*

A. Jesus Christ is the a eternal So^ of God, of the same b substance wit^ the
Father, God from everlasting; c wh^ in the fullness of time took on him on
nature; d so that he is true God and tru^ man in one person. a Mat. 16.16. b
Heb 1.3. Joh. 1.1, 3. Joh. 10.30. Rev. 1.8. Esa 9.6. Joh. 5.18. Phil. 2.6. c
Gal. 4.4, ^ d Romans 1.3. Romans 9.5. Col. 2.9. Man 22.43.

Q. What is necessary that Christ on peacemaker should be man?

A. Yes, for three reasons. First, because he that redeemeth, and they that be
redeemed, must be both of one kind and nature, that so Gods Justice may accept
him in our stead [a right to redeem; therefore Angels that fell are not saved,
because he took not their nature.] Heb. 2.10.11, 14, 16. Ruth. 4.4, 6. 1 Cor.
15.20, 21.

Q. Why secondly?

A. That he might be put under the Law, and die; the which as God he could not
do. [He was to pay our debt, and therefore to enter into our bonds.] Heb. 2.9,
10, 14. Rev. 1, 5. 1 Pet. 2.24.

Q. Why thirdly?

A. That he might be a merciful, and faithful High Priest in things
pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. Heb.
2.17, 18. Heb. 4.15. Heb. 5.2. Our Savior was taken from among men, that he
might have compassion them that be tempted, and out of the way.

Q. Did Gods justice require him to death? was it necessary that Christ should
dye for us?

A. Yes; Sin calls for death, as for its wages; and he that will redeem a
sinner, must dye for him: [He must pay all o^ debt, and that is a price for a
sinner* Math. 26.39. Romans 8.32. Heb. 9.12, 22, 26 1 Pet. 3.18.

Q. Why must the Mediator be all God?

A. 1. That he might be able to over come death. Act. 2.24 John 10.18. C^^ 2.15.

Q. Why 2ly must the Mediator be God

A. 2. To make his obedience and sufferings efficacious and acceptable for us
All the Angels in Heaven, if they should suffer in Hell for evermore, cannot
sati^fie for one soul. Heb. 9.12, 14. Heb. 10.^ 9. Mic. 6.6, 7. 1 Pet. 1.18.
Psalm. 49, 7, 8. [N^ mere creature can stand before the wrat^ of God to overcome
it; a finite creature cannot satisfy an infinite God.]

Q. Say the same again in plain terms.

A. All that Christ did and suffered ^^ therefore meritorious and precious,
because it was the suffering and obedience of on that is God: [The blood of
God, the righteousness of God.] Acts 20.28. 1 Cor. 2.8. 2 Cor. 5.21. Romans 3.22.

Q. How can that be, seeing God cannot suffer, nor yet be obedient to any there
being none greater then God?

A. Is it so; because God and man be one person: his humane nature is united to
the person of God; by reason of which personal union, that which is proper to
the humane nature, is applied to whole Christ, [to the man Christ Jesus.] Luke
1.43. John 8.58. John 3.13.

Q. Then Jesus Christ the Son of God, and the Son of Mary, are not two persons,
but two natures in one person.

A. It is true; for the humane nature was taken into the subsistence of the
second person in the Blessed Trinity, being from his conception prevented from
a personal subsisting of it self, like other men. God took man into himself,
and joined it to himself; and so God and man be one Christ] Luke 1.35. Heb.
2.16. Joh. 1.14. Joh. 17.21, 22. [Man and wife be one by civil bonds, yet not
one person, Christ and we are one by spiritual bonds, yet not one person; but
God and man be one person of Christ, Mat: 1.23. Emmanuel.

Q. Why must the Mediator be God and Man in one person?

A. He must be man, that he might dye; and he must be God, that he might be
able to overcome death; and he must be both in one person that the sufferings
in the humane nature, might have worthiness and merit to save us. 1 Pet. 1.19.
Esaias 53.10, 11.

Q. You see that the worthiness o^ Christ's sufferings depends on that blessed
union of man to the Godhead: What other benefit flows from thence?

A. From that personal union are communicated to us all the graces and
privileges which we do enjoy, or look for hereafter. [all our riches and
happiness is first in Christ our head, and from Christ to us.] Ephesians. 1.3, 4. 1
Cor. 3.22, 23 Ioh. 17.21, 22, 23. and 15.9. and 1.16. Col. 1. 13, 15, 17, 19
Rom 8.11, 17. [All things are ours; because we are knit to Christ and Christ is
Gods: from that blessed and glorious Head of ours that dwells in the glorious
Godhead; from thence descend all grace to the brethren. God is first the Father
of Christ, then our Father. Christ is that Jacobs Ladder, that joins Heaven
and Earth together. John 1.51. and 20 17.]

Q. Is it not a great comfort that our Mediator is our brother, and also one
with God?

A It now is, and ever will be, an infinite contentment to the poor soul, to
behold our blessed Head and Mediator dwelling in those everlasting burnings,
set in glory at Gods own right hand above all created natures: [From whence he
now governes the Church, and will hereafter glorify it with his own glory.]
Ephesians: 1 21, 22. Romans 8.34. We must look upon all things done to Christ, and by
Christ, as a common person, and head of the Elect, uniting us unto God,
communicating unto us all spiritual good things; triumphing over all the
enemies of our salvation; preparing mansions for us against we die, and in the
mean while making intercession for us, until he has brought us to the
enjoyment of himself in glory, John 14.2. 1 Cor. 3.23. and 17.21, 22, 24.

CAP: XI.
Of Christ's Priestly office, and the parts thereof, viz. satisfaction and
intercession.

HE that shall bring sinners to Heaven must do three things. First, he must
make satisfaction to God for their sins. Secondly, he must effectually teach
them to know God. Thirdly, he must rule and deliver them from all opposite
power. All this Christ does undertake and perform in us and for us: And
accordingly we are taught in Scripture, that he has ^ threefold office;
namely, 1. Of Priest, to make reconciliation, Of Christ's threefold office.
by the offering up o^ himself to God for us. 2. Of a King, to conquer our
enemies, and rule in ou^ hearts. 3. Of a Prophet, to teach us the will of God.

Q. What is Christ's Priestly Office?

1. Priestly.
A. Christ's Priestly office is, to pacify his Fathers wrath, and make an
atonement for the sins of the people, by the offering up of himself a
sacrifice for sin Heb. 5.1. Heb. 2.17. Levit. 5.17, 18. Number 16.47. Heb. 9.26.

Q. What be the parts of Christ Priestly office?

A. Two, namely, to make 1 Satisfaction for the people. 2 Intercession for the
people.
[And so was the Office of Aaron, and the Priests, to be mediators between God
and man; and to make atonement for the sins of the people, and to pray for
them. Heb. 9.7, Heb. 5.1.

Q. We have offended and wronged God: Of Christ's satisfaction
Did Christ make any real satisfaction to God for the same?

A. Yes: He did not barely entreat for us, but he paid in such a price, and
gave such contentment to Gods Justice in our behalf, that the Lord does smell
a favor of rest to our souls. Romans 3.25, 26. 1 Timothy 2.6. 1 Pet. 1.19. with 1 John 2.2. Number. 19.9. with Heb. 13.11, 12. Levit. 16.20, 22. Esa. 53.5, 8.
[Christ does not barely entreat, but as an advocate, he pleads a satisfaction
made: Expiation and satisfaction is the taking away of an offense, by doing or
suffering something, by some work or price which the party offended will
accept of. As 2 Samuel 21.3. 1 Cor. 6.20. Heb. 9.12. Philem. v. 18.

Q. How did Christ make such satisfaction for us.

A. By the offering up of his body a sacrifice for sin, according to the will
of God, by which we are consecrated and reconciled to God for ever. [The Father
craved no more but once offering for our ransom.] Heb. 10.5, 9, 12. Ephesians. 5.2.
with Genesis 8.21. Romans 8.34. Christ's blood is the price of souls.

Q. Is that a true and full satisfaction for sin?

A. Yes: Gods Justice is no looser by pardoning sin for Christ's sake, seeing
our sins are visited to the full upon Christ our surety; there is man for
man, soul for soul; the precious death of his righteous Son, instead of a
sinful creature. 1 Pet. 3.18. 1 John 17.9 Joh. 11.50. Romans 8 32. In Hell there
is suffering enough but no satisfaction; the debt is never p^^d.
Gods Justice is better contented in Christ's sufferings for a time, then in the
creatures for evermore; and for the sins of the Elect, then for the sins of
the damned.]

Q. If God be satisfied, then we are discharged from the curse of the Law, and
all our debt to Gods Justice

A. We are so^ because Christ our surety has fully answered the Law for us; so
that nothing remains to be charged on us. Gal. 3.10, 13. Romans 8.33, 34.

Q. But how did Christ answer the Law for us?

A. By a bearing all that punishment which is due to breakers of God Law; and
by b fulfilling all that obed^ence which it requires of us. a Phil. 28. To.
5.19. b Mat. 5.17. Joh. 8.29. Mat. 3.15. Romans 8.3. We that are sinners stand
bound to God in a double debt. 1. Of satisfaction for sins past. 2. Of
obedience for time coming: This the Law requires of us, and thus much Christ
has performed for us.

Q. What is the second part of Christ's Priestly office.

A. To make intercession for us, Of Christ's intercession.
Rom 8.34. Heb. 7.25.

Q. What mean you by Christ's intercession?

A. Christ stands between God and us; he presents us and our prayers to God,
and pleads his merits for our acceptance. [Christ appears in the presence of
God for us, as the high Priests did with the names the twelve Tribes, in the
Holy of Holies.] Heb. 9.24. 1 John 2.1. Rev. 8.2, 3. Exodus: 28.28, 29, 38.

Q. What then be the parts of Christ's intercession?

A. They be two. 1. To present and tender to his Father his own blood, which
he shed for our sins: And 2ly, To make requests for us. Thus did the high
Priest, (who was a Type of Christ) enter into the Holy of Holies [which was a
figure of Heaven] with the blood of a Bullock, and a Goat, [which did signify
Christ's bloud] and with Incese: [which did signify his prayers for the
people.] Thus did the High Priest when he went into the Holy of Holies, to make
atonement and reconciliation for the people. Lev. 16.5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19.
And thus does Christ our High Priest for us now in Heaven. Rev. 8.2, 3. Heb.
9.12, 23, 24. Christ carried his own blood into Heaven.

Q. What is the effect and fruit of this part of Christ's Priestly office?

1 Pet. 2.5. Heb. 7.25. Heb. 9.14.
A. By this applying and pleading of his sacrifice for us, both our persons, and
our services are accepted with God. Exodus 28 38.

Q. What follows of all this?

A. Therefore we must go to God only by Christ, and not by any Creature, Saint,
or Ang^ll: It Is Christ's office, not theirs, to appear in our behalf before
God. Heb 4.14, 16. with Heb. 5.4, 5.

Q. How does it appear that he is a Priest to you?

A. Because he gives me peace of conscience in his blood, and has made me a
Priest, to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God by him. Rev. 1.6. 1 Pet 2.5.
Romans 12.1.

CAP. XII.
Of Christ's Kingly, or Ruling office. Prophetical, and Teaching office.


ALL the Benefits obtained by Christ's Priestly Office, are conveyed unto us by
his Kingly and Prophetical office.

Q. Is Christ the King of the Church?

A. Yes: 2. Of Christ's Kingly office.
Christ is the only King over the Church: It is such an Honor, that God
thinks it fit for none but his Son. Heb. 1.8, 9. Col. 1.15, 18. Christ is the
first borne of every Creature; He is the Head and Husband of the Church, and
therefore he alone is fit, he alone is able to gather a Church, to rule his
Church, and to deliver it from those mighty Principalities and Powers which
fight against our souls. Mat. 2.2. Rev. 19.16. 1 Timothy 6.15. Rev. 15.3.

Q. What kind of Kingdom, or dominion has Christ over the Church?

A. It is not of this world, nor like the Kingdoms of earth: But it is a
spiritual Kingdom, ordering the business of the soul, and the affairs of
Heaven. Col. 1. 13. Rev: 1.18. and 3.7. All things belonging to it are
spiritual; the means of gathering and governing it, are spiritual; the
weapons of our warfare, are spiritual; the blessings and privileges are
spiritual; the enemies of it are spiritual, etc.

Q. What be the parts of this spiritual Kingly office of Christ?

A. They be four. 1 To deliver us out of the hands of our spiritual enemies;
to turn us from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, and
so to translate us into the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Act: 26, 18. Col. 1.13.
Luke 1.74.

Q. What be those spiritual enemies out of whose hands Christ does deliver us?

A. Four. 1 a Sin. 2 b Satan. 3 c The curse of the Law. And Lastly, d Death:
All these be enemies to our salvation, and over them all Christ does give us
the victory: a 1 Pet: 4.2. 1 John: 3.8. Mat: 12.20. Rom 6.7. b Romans 16.20. 1
Ioh: 4.4. c Rom: 7.1.4. and 8.33. d 1 Cor. 15.55, 57.

Q. What is the second part of Christ's Kingly office?

A. To give us Laws and Rules to order and govern us (being thus gathered) in
the ways of truth and righteousness. Esaias 9.6, 7. Gal: 6.16. Mat: 28.20.

Q. Then they wrong Christ in his Kingly office, that challenge a power over
the conscience, to bind it with sin, or duty?

A. They do so; because it is Christ's prerogative to give Laws to the
conscience, Esaias 33.22. Mat. 23.8, 10. Iam. 4.12. Men may order the outward man
by their Laws, Col. 2.11.21, 12.
but the conscience is Christ's peculiar, they may not meddle with that, to bind
where Christ has set free; And where Christ has bound, no man can set us
free, 1 Cor. 7.24. 2 Cor. 11.20 Gal. 5.1.

Q. What is the third part of Christ's Kingly office?

A. To subdue our lusts; to rule in our hearts by his Word and Spirit, and to
keep us in obedience to his Laws, Psalm. 110.2, 3. and 45.5. 2 Cor: 10.4.5.
Luk: 19.14, 27. Ezekiel: 34.23, 24.

Q. What is the fourth part of Christ's Kingly office?

A. To defend and preserve us amidst all tentations, unto his Kingdom of
glory. Christ does take order with the Enemies of his Church and Kingdom: he
discovers and confounds their plots and devices: He restraines their rage, and
sets bounds to their malice, and at last he casts them into the lake that
burns with fire and brimstone. Rev. 2.10. Luke 18.7, 8. Esa. 43.2. Amos 9.9.
Ezra 6.8, 11, 22. Esth. 3.8, 13. with Esth. 6.1, 6. with Esth. 8.5, 8, 11. with
Esth. 9.1, 22. Rev. 19.20.

Q. By what means does Christ gathe^ him a Kingdom, and carry on the
Government thereof?

A. a Not by the arm of flesh, b bu^ by spiritual weapons, viz. His Word,
Sacraments, and the exercise of the keys (which we call discipline) a 2 Cor.
10.4. Esa. 11.4. Ephesians. 6.11, 12. b Jo^ 20.23. Mat. 18.17, 18.

Q. Then it is not lawful for Christians by force of Arms, to erect Christ's
Kingdom? much less is it lawful for Christian people to rise up against
civil Magistrates, for the Cause and Kingdom o^ Jesus Christ?

A. It is utterly unlawful, a because Christ's Kingdom is not of this world,
(...) therefore his servants may not fight: ^^ Christ's Spiritual Kingdom does
not overthrow Cesars temporal power, an^ therefore Christ has commanded a^
humble subjection to all civil Powers. a Joh. 18.36. Mat. 26.52. b Mat. 22.21.
Romans 13.1, 2, 4, 7. Tit. 3.1. Act. 23.5. 1 Pet. 2.13, 15, 16. It is a singular
wickedness, to make Christ's Name and Gospel a pretense to shake off Temporal
authority, or to make it a Condition of our yiedling civil obedience unto them.

Q. How shall I know that Christ is a King to me?

A. By two things. 1. By the obedience I yield to his Laws. Joh. 15.14.

Q. How secondly?

A. By the victory he gives me over my sins: if sin reign in us, Christ is
not King. [Christ sets up his Word in our hearts; he makes us a willing and
obedient people; the lusts, and principles, and maxims of the World rule not
in us.] Psalm. 110.3. 1 Pet. 2.9. Col. 1.13.

Q. Christ is the great Prophet of the Church, to teach, instruct, exhort, Of
Christ's Protheticall office.
and comfort his people. Joh. 1.9. John 6.45. What be the parts of Christ's
Prophetical Office?

A. Two: 1. To reveal his Father, and make known his will to us. Joh. 1.18.
Luke 1.78, 79. Ephesians. 3.9. Deuteronomy. 18.15. with Joh. 10.3, 9, 11. 1 Cor. 1.21.

Q. What is the second part of Christ's teaching office?

A. Effectually to persuade the heart to receive the Doctrine taught; [to open
their eyes, unstop their ears, and cause their heart to attend.] Esa. 35.4, 5.
Joh. 6.45. Act. 16.14. Rev. 3.18. Christ does not only hold forth the light,
but he gives us eyes to see it.

Q. Be there not other Prophets and Teachers of the Church.

A. Yes; Christ uses the Ministry of men, but all the efficacy and power of
their teaching is from God. 1 Cor. 3.7. Mat. 11.25.26, 27. Mat. 13.13. 2 Cor.
3.3. Gal. 2.8. 2 Cor. 4.6, 7.

Q How shall I know that I am taught of God?

A. When the Word which we hear is followed by us, and obeyed: [else thou have
heard a mere man; man may teach you to know the definitions of faith, of sin,
of repentance, etc. but Christ alone teaches you to believe and repent; Christ
gives the discerning, the taste to judge between things that differ.] 2 Cor.

CAP. XIII.
Of Man to be reconciled to God in the New Covenant; Man is the third party in
the Covenant of Grace.

GOD has given his Son to be a Covenant of the people, The third party in the
New Covenant.
( Esa. 42.6.) Made sure promises to him, etc. And Christ thus brought into the
world, furnished with grace and power, is offered to sinners, with large
promises to them that receive him. It follows to be considered.

Q. To whom do those promises of life and salvation belong? Who may take
comfort in them?

A. Only they that be in covenant with God. Ephesians. 2.12.

Q. When is the soul in covenant with God?

A. When the heart consents to take Christ as he is offered to us in all his
Offices; resigning up, and engaging our selves to be wholly his: [God takes us
for his people, we take him to be our God.] Deuteronomy. 26.17, 18. Jer. 30.21, 22.
Genesis 15.1, 6. Zach. 13.9. Joh. 1.12. The soul does not mislike the person, nor
the Portion, nor the terms on which Christ is offered to us. The believer
takes Christ for his Savior, for his Teacher, for his Lord and Ruler.

Q. What manner of persons are in covenant with God?

A. Such as believe the Gospel, repent of their sins, and walk uprightly
before God. Genesis 17.1. Mar. 1.15. Acts 20.21. These three things are required
of all that be in Covenant with God.

1. Of Faith.
Q. What is the nature, and proper act of faith?

A. It is a grace, whereby we do acknowledge and accept of Christ for our Lord
and Savior, and rest on him alone for salvation. [Or it is a grace, whereby
the soul does rest and rely on the promise of life and salvation made in
Christ Jesus.] Ephesians. 1.12, 13. Romans 10.14. Romans 15.12. Tit. 1.1.2 Psalm. 2.12.
Psalm, 18.2:] Trust has for its object, the promises of God; and it is not
every promise that is the object of faith, as it justifies, but the promise of
life only: Christ is the proper object of faith as it justifies, and trusting
is the proper act of faith. To seek, and thirst after Christ, and rest on him,
that is Faith.] Heb. 10.38.

Q. Many say they trust on Christ, and yet deceive themselves: Show some signs
of true faith.

A. There be three signs of true faith. 1. It makes me to strive against
unbelief. and all other lusts; purging the heart, and working out the
filthiness of it, as a spring does the mire and dirt that is cast into it: [or
as the stomach expels poyson] faith and lusts cannot lodge and dwell together.
Mar. 9.24. He. 10.38. Acts. 15.9.

Q. What is a second sign of true faith? What gracious affections do show
true faith?

A. True faith makes us to prize Jesus Christ above all things; the soul will
sell all gladly, and part with any content for Christ's sake. Mat. 13.44. Psalm.
45.10. Heb. 11.24, 25. Genesis 22.12. Heb. 11.8.



A. Because it is not a dead faith, but it works by love, that is, whatsoever
sin we resist, and whatsoever good thing we do, we do all out of a love to
the Lord Jesus: [We so love God, that we hate evil for Gods sake.] Gal. 5.6.
Ioh. 21.16. Iam 2.17, 18.

Q. What, secondly, 2. Of Repentance.
must they do that be, or would be in covenant with God?

A. They must repent of their sins, and change their lives, Mot: 3.7, 8. Act.
2.38.

Q. Why must they also repent that be, or would be in Covenant with God?

A. Because it is necessary that they that be in Covenant with God, must break
their league with every sin: friendship with God cannot stand with friendship
with any sin, 2 Cor: 6.17, 18. Jam. 4.4. 1 John 2.15.

Q. What is Repentance?

A. It is a grace of Gods Spirit, whereby we are grieved for offending o^ God,
b and do turn from sin, c ou^ of an inward and spiritual d^slike and
hatred of its filthiness; a Mat. 26.75. 2 Cor. 7.10. b Esaias 1.16, 17. 2 Pet.
2.22 1 Cor. 5.7. Act: 3.19. Ezekiel: 36.26, 27, 31 c Esaias 33 22.

Q. What be the parts of repentance*

A. Two: mortification, whereby we die to sin: and vivification, whereby we
are quickened to a life of grace, Gal. 5.24. 1 Pet. 4.1, 2, 3. Romans 6.6, 7. and
8.2, 10, 13* Ephesians. 4.22.24. Luke 3.11.

Q. Then profane persons, that be at sometimes grieved and ashamed for some
sins, are not esteemed to repent, unless they be renewed to a life of grace?

A. It is true; Because their sorrow for sin is greater then their conscience
of sin, and therefore it is but a fleshly sorrow. 1 King. 21.19, 20, 27. Mat.
27.3, 4, 5. Re. 16.10, 11. Hos. 7.14. Es. 58.5, 6. Jer. 8.5. Ez. 36.15, 31. the
stone sweats, but is not soft: So, etc.

Q. How then may I know my repentance to be true?

A. By three signs. Sam. 24.5. Job. 34.31, 32. Hos. 14.2.

Q. How Secondly?

Psalm. 119.136. Act. 17.16. 2 Pet. 2.8.

Q. How, Lastly, is true repentance known?

Paul. 2 Cor. 7.11.

Q. What say you of confession to a Priest, and satisfaction: Are not they
parts of repentance?

A. No; we need not confess all our sins to men, and we cannot satisfy God
by bearing penance: [Our sins are not a jot better done away by performing
all the penances in the world.]

CAP. XIV.

a Psalm. 5^.6. Joh. 4.23. Heb. 20.22. b Psalm. 119.80. Psalm. 32.2. Rev. 3.2. 1 Timothy: 1.5. Psalm. 12.2. c 1 Samuel 12.24. 2 King: 23.3. Psalm. 119.2. Hos. 10.2.
Psalm. 15.2. d 1 Corinthians. 5.8. 2 Cor: 1.12. Mat. 5.8. 2 Cor. 2.17. The upright
and sincere Christian is, 1. Really and in Truth such as he seems to be. 2. He

King: 8.18.

Q. This Covenant with God when is it broken?

A. It is not broken by particular failings, but by unfaithfulness; that is,
when the heart departs from the Lord secretly or openly, choosing and joining

29.18. Hos. 4.16, 17. Ezekiel. 33.31. Hos. 2.2. Es: 66.3. 2 Chronicles. 15. with 2 Chronicles. 16.7. 10, 12. 2 Chronicles. ^9.3.

Psalm: 119.57. 2 Chronicles. 25.17. Ezr: 6.21. Jer: 30 31, 32.

Q. Why be these Graces required in Gods people? Why must they repent, and walk
in new obedience?

A. Because God is an holy God, and therefore his people must be holy, and
severed from the pollutions of the World. 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. Act. 7.3. Lev.
20.26. Zach. 14 20, 21. 2 These. 2.13. [God receives not to glory, who are not
first partakers of Grace.] Heb. 12.14. Mat. 23.25.

Q Might not God as well bring us to Heaven without sanctification; forgive our
sins, and more ado?

A. No: Because Christ is unto us sanctification, as well as redemption; that
so he might deliver us from all the evil of sin; that is, from the power of
sin, as well as from the guilt of sin: Grace is no burden to him that has it;
nay it is a greater mercy to bring us to Heaven, through sanctification and
adoption, making us his Sons, then absolutely to forgive our sins. [As it is a
greater honor to be the Son of a King, then his favorite.] 1 Cor. 1.30. Gal.
2.17, 18.

Q. What follows of all this Doctrine of the New Covenant, as to the wicked?

A. It follows, That no wicked, graceless, impenitent person, has any thing
to do with the Covenant of Mercy and Peace. Esa. 4.3, 4. Mar. 7.23. 1 Ioh.
1.6. Rom 8.9. Rev. 21.27.

Q. What comfort arises hereof to the godly?

A. They are hereby assured, as by a witness within themselves, that God is
their God, and they his children: The heart pondereth the promises, and sees
himself taken into Christ, and his name written in Heaven.] 1 John 5.10. 2
Pet. 1.10, 11. 2 Cor. 1.22. [These graces are not matter of conjecture, but of
experience and feeling, they find that they obey Gods call, hear his voice,
believe, repent, etc. these Graces are as the seal sealed; the Spirit of God is
the seal sealing, which makes that holy stamp and impression on our hearts.]

Q. But my faith and graces be weak, and I often fall.

A. If they be sound, in truth and sincerity, it is enough: Our graces do not
save us; it is Christ that saves, who is made unto us righteousness, etc. 1
Cor. 1.30. But these Graces evidence our Being in Christ, 2 Cor. 5.17. and our
future Glory, being made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of Saints in
light. Col. 1.12.

fruit and profit of them upon his Elect. How does it appear that Christ is a
Christ to thee? or that Christ is thy Christ?

A trial whether we be Christians.
A. Because, in some measure, I am made partaker of Christ's anointing, that is,
of his fullness I have received Grace to know him, to conquer my corruptions;

CAP. XVIII.
Of the Incarnation of the Son of God.

Which was conceived by the Holy Ghost.

THE conception of Christ stands in three thing. 1. The framing his Body of the
Virgin Mary. 2. The seperating of original sin from it. 3. The uniting of
that Nature to the Godhead in the instant of his conception.

Q. Christ is God equal with his Father from all Eternity: How came he to be
Man?

A. In the fullness of time he took flesh of the Virgin Mary, and was born of
her, as we be of our mothers; a perfect man, as we are: so that there is true
God, and perfect man, in one person* Joh. 1.14. Gal. 4.4. Phil. 2.6, 7. Heb.
2.17. Esaias. 7.14. Joh. 3.13. Romans 9.5.

Q. Why did he take man's nature on him?

A. That he might be put under the Law to stand in our room; and in our nature,
to satisfy for our sins; [at his Incarnation he entered into our bonds; as
being God, he could neither suffer death, nor be made obedient to the Law.]
Heb. 2.14. Heb. 9.22. Heb. 10.5, 10.

Q. How was he conceived?

A. Not by the power of nature, as we are of two Parents, but by the power of
the holy Ghost, which did frame his body of the substance of the Virgin Mary,
and united it to the Godhead, Luk 1.35. Joh. 3.13. Ephesians. 4.9.

Q. All that be borne of women be sinners: How came Christ to be conceived and
borne without sin?

A. Because he was conceived by the power of the holy Ghost, who did separate
original sin from his nature. Luke 1.35. that holy thing. Heb. 7.26. Heb.
4.15.

Q. Why must Christ be without sin?

A. Because else he could not save sinners, Heb. 7.27, 28. Else he must, like
the High Priest, offer for his own sins, as well as for the peoples.

Q. Why was he borne of a Virgin?

A. To answer the Prophesies; that hereby it might appear, that he was the
true Messiah spoken of by the Prophets. Esaias 7.14. Ier. 31.22. Heb. 7.3.

Q. Why of that Virgin, of the stock of David and Abraham?

A. Because the promised seed was to come out of the loins of Abraham:
[Salvation is of the Jews.] Genesis 12.3. Genesis 22.18. Gal. 3.16. Joh. 4.22.

Q. What do you believe in this Article?

A. That the eternal Son of God, remaining God, did take my nature on him, and
in that nature did satisfy for my sins: [In which, being now advanced to Gods
right hand, he does execute, as Mediator, all things belonging to the Kingdom
of God.]

Q. How does the true belief of this Article affect our hearts?

A. In that wonderful Person I admire Gods infinite wisdom and love, in
contriving and working man's salvation: [As he is in himself a wonderful
Person, so he is to me: I look to the man that is Gods fellow, and dwells in the
everlasting burning.] Ephesians. 3.8, 9, 10. Zach. 13.7.

Suffered under Pontius Pilate.

Q. DID Christ suffer for himself?

A. No; He was no debtor to the Law; and therefore what he suffered was for us,
and in our stead, as our surety. Esa. 53.4 5, 6. Heb 9.9. 1 Pet. 3.18. 2 Cor.
5.21. Heb, 7.22. Mat. 3.14, 15. Dan. 9.26. Romans 4.25.

Q. What did Christ suffer in our stead?

A. The whole punishment due to out sins, the whole wrath of God in his soul
and body, which we should have suffered, Esaias 53.4, 10. Mat: 26.38, 39. Rev.
19.15. 1 Pet: 2.24. Psalm: 22.14. Romans 8.32.

Q. When did he suffer all these things?

A. Especially in the garden, where he swet clots of blood, before any hand was
laid on him; and on the Cross, by the space of six hours, Luk: 22.43, 44.
Mat: 27.46. Psalm: 22.1, 6. Mar: 14.33, 34. Phil. 2.8 [So heavy was the wrath of
God, that an Angel came to comfort him, yea he roared as a man forsaken, etc.]

Q. What is the virtue and efficacy of his sufferings?

A. By his stripes we are healed, Es: 53 5. Heb: 9.14, 26, 28. Col: 2.14. Heb:
10.2, 10, 12, 14. [In him we all died, and were condemned, and his death took
away our condemnation, 2 Cor: 5.14.] Rom: 8.3.

Q. For whom did Christ suffer all this?

A. For his Body, the Church: [Christs blood is of value to save all men; but
it was not intended for them that perish: Christ stood not in their stead, for
then they should not dye themselves.] Ephesians: 5.25. Joh: 10.15.

Q. How know you that you have a part in Christ's sufferings?

A. Because the life and power of sin is killed in me, and I now live to him
that died for me. [Sinne is of all things most odious to me.] 2 Cor. 5.15. Romans
6.3, 6. 1 John 5.6 The merit of Christ's death reaches unto God, to satisfy and
pacify him; and the virtue or efficacy of it reaches to our souls, to
mortify and kill sin in them, 1 Pet: 4.1, 2.

Q. Who was Pontius Pilate?

A. The Roman Judge that condemned him, because he said that he was the Son of
God, the King of Israel, Joh: 19 7, 8, 12, 15, 19, 21. Mat: 20.19. [a sign
that the Messiah was come, because the government was taken from them, and now
in the hands of a stranger, Genesis 49.10. Joh: 18.31.] Rev. 11.8. where Christ
was slain.

Q. Why was he thus legally condemned, and not killed privily.

A. Because that death alone is satisfactory to the Law, which public
authority does inflict on Malefactors; [for though Christ were no Malefactor,
no guile was found in his lips; he was innocent by the Judges own mouth, yet
he was numbered amongst the transgressors.] Esaias 53.12. Mat. 20.18, 19.

Q. What kind of death died he?

A. He was crucified; which was a painful, shameful, and accursed death, Ioh.
19.18, 31. Phil. 2.8. Deuteronomy. 21.23.

Q. Why that kind of death?

A. Because he was to remove the curse from us, therefore he was to be made a
curse for us. Gal. 3.13.

Q. Dead: Why died he?

A. Because death is the wages of sin; and sin is not remitted without shedding
of blound, Romans 6.23. Heb. 9.22. 1 Cor. 15.56, 57. Heb. 2.9, 14.

Q. Buried: Why so?

A. That he might sweeten the grave to us, and be God both of the dead and of
the living, Mat. 12.40. Romans 14.9. 1 Cor. 15.55.

Q. Descended into Hell: When Christ gave up the Ghost, his Body was put into
the Grave, and his Soul went into Paradise, being commended into the hands of
God, as the soul of Steven, and other the faithful are; and as the soul of
the converted thief was. What then is meant here by Christ's descending into
Hell?

A. His Soul went not into the place of the damned; but thereby is meant, his
abiding prisoner under the dominion of Death the space of three days. Bp.
Ushers answer to the Irish Jesuits challenge. c. 8.
[As Jonas was three days in the Whales belly, and saw no corruption. But
David does, etc.] Compare Psalm. 16.10. with Act. 2.27, 31. Act. 13.34.35. Romans
6.9. Mat. 12.40.

Q. What is the substance of that you believe in this Article?

A. I believe that Christ suffered the whole punishment belonging unto sinners,
both in his Soul and Body, when he offered up himself a curse and a sacrifice
for sin; and that by his sufferings Gods wrath is pacified toward me, [and all
the spiritual enemies of my salvation are thereby vanquished.]

CAP. XX.
Of Christ's exaltation and sitting at the right hand of God the Father.

The third day he rose again from the dead.
Q. DID Christ still remain in the the grave?

A. No the third day he rose again: Luke. 24.3, 6. Act. 2.24. Act. 1.3. 1 Cor.
15.4, 8.

Q Why was it needful that Christ should rise again?

A. 1. Because else we were still in our sins; else it does not appear that
our sins be satisfied for. 1 Cor. 15.17. 1 Pet. 1.3, 21. [Christ was not
only to suffer Death and the Law, but to conquer them; which he had not done,
if he had been still holden of death; and we must have looked out for another
Savior that could conquer it. The debtor comes not out of prison, till he has
paid the utmost farthing, etc. If any one sin had been unsatisfied, Christ had
no risen from the dead.]

Q. Why else must Christ rise again?

A. That he might apply effectually unto us the merit of his death, 1 Cor.
15.16, 54, 55. Romans 4.25. Rev. 1.18.

He ascended into Heaven.
Q. What became of Christ after he was risen?

A. After he had spent forty days in teaching his Apostles the things
belonging to the Kingdom of God, he went up into Heaven in that same body
which had been crucified and buried. Act. ^.3.9, 10, 11. Ephesians. 4.10. Luke 24.51.
Ephesians. 1.20, 22.

Q. What good is that to us?

A. 1. It assures us, that he has finished the work of our redemption (which
his Father gave him to do) in an acceptable manner, John 16.10. John 17.4, 5.
Heb. 9.12, 25. Heb. 10.12. If Christ had not fulfilled the Law, and satisfied
for all out debt; if he had not in all things well pleased his Father, he had
never got into Heaven: But now God welcomes him to Heaven, and bids him, Sit
thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy Footstool. Heb. 1.3,
9, 13.

Q. What else does it assure us of?

A. 2. It assures me, that seeing Christ is entered into Heaven in our name,
and has taken possession for us of the purchased inheritance, that therefore
he will bring us thither in his appointed time, Ioh. 12.26. Ioh. 17.24. Heb.
6.20.

Sits at the right hand of God.
Q Where is Jesus Christ now?

A. In Heaven at Gods right hand, in great glory and power. Act. 7.56. 1 Pet*
3.22.

Q. God has no right hand, nor left hand: What then is the meaning of it?

A. It signifies that Honor and Power which Christ received of his Father
when he had finished the work of our redemption, Heb. 1.13. Mat. 22.44. Ephesians:
1.20, 22. 1 Cor: 15.24, 25.

Q. What does Christ do there?

A. He makes intercession for us, that is, he presents our prayers, and pleads
his merits for our acceptance, Heb: 7.25. and 9.24. To: 8.34. [He enters our
appearance, and causes that no wrath issue out against us, though our sins cry
for vengeance.] God never said to Saint or Angel, Sit thou at my right hand,
Heb: 1.13.]

Q. Do we not want him more to be with us here on earth?

A. No; He does us more good in Heaven, appearing for us in the presence of God
upon all occasions, [and yet he is here with us in his Majesty, Headship, and
Grace, though not in his Body,] Joh: 16.7. Joh: 14.28. Our business lies in
Heaven with God; and it is best that Christ be there, Heb: 4.14.

Q. How does this affect the Heart of the believer?

A. It comforts me, in assurance that it shall not go ill with the Church, or
any Member thereof, as long as Christ is at Gods right hand [Pull Christ from
Gods right hand, and then you may overthrow the Church and children of God]
Psalm: 110 1, 2. To: 8.34. Ioh: 10.28. 1 Pet: 1.21. Heb: 2.8, 9. There in a
course taken to put all things fully under him.

CAP: XXI.
Of the last judgment.

From thence he shall come to judge.
Q. SHall this World ever have an end?

A. Yes; and then Christ shall come in great glory to judge the World. 2 Pet:
3.10, 11. 2 Timothy: 4.1. Mat: 16.27. Mat. 26.64.

Q. Who shall be Judge?

A. The same Chirst that was pierced. Act. 17.31. Ioh: 5.22, 27. Zach: 12.10.

Q. Whom shall he judge?

A. The quick and the dead, that is, all men that ever were, or shall be.

Q. Who be meant by the quick?

A. They that be found alive at the last day, 1 Cor. 15.51. 1 These: 4 15.

Q. Who by the dead?

A All that have departed this life from the beginning of the World, they shall
come again with their own bodies, Rev: 20.12. Joh. 5.28, 29.

Q Whereof shall they be judged?

A. All men shall give account of themselves, as their works and ways have
been. 2 Cor. 5.10. Romans 2.5, 6, 12, 16. 1. Cor. 4.5. Eccles: 12.14.

Q. What sentence shall be passed on the Godly?

A. A sentence of pardon and absolution for Christ's sake. Mat. 25.32, 34. Ephesians.
5.23, 27.

Q. What on the wicked?

A. A sentence of condemnation, for their own sakes. [And then shall be made an
everlasting separation between men and men, between godly and wicked, between
chafe and wheat; the one to everlasting joy, the other to everlasting
punishment with the Devil and his Angels for evermore.] Mat 25.41. Mat. 24 40.
Mat: 13.30, 38, 41, 49. Here we live together, and work together, and eat
together, and Pray and Hear together: but then the separation shall be made,
the Godly shall be taken, and the Wicked left, and cast in to the furnace of
fire.

Q. What follows of the true belief of this Article?

A. It makes me careful so to order the matter, that I may be found of Him in
peace; not willingly going on in any course in which I would be loath to be
found at the last day: [I would not at that day stand and appear among
Non-residents, Usurers, Swearers, etc. and therefore I hate those courses now.]
2 Pet. 3.11, 14. 1 Pet. 1.17. 2 Cor. 5.9, 11, 12. Mat. 24 46, so doing.

I believe in the Holy Ghost.
Q. Who is the Holy Ghost?

A. The third Person of the blessed Trinity, equal, and of the same substance
with the Father and the Son, proceeding from the Father and the Son, 1 Ioh.
5.7. Mat. 28.19. John. 15.26. Ioh. 14.26. Ioh. 16.15. Gal. 4.6. Esa. 48.16.
with Rom: 8.9.

Q. What is the office and work of the Holy Ghost in man's salvation?

A. It is to make us holy, to sanctify, wash, and renew our hearts and lives;
filling us with all spiritual graces, and thereby sealing up the love of God
unto our hearts, Matthew. 3.11. Ioh. 3.5. 1 Cor. 6.11. Tit. 3.5. Romans 8.16. 2
Cor. 1.22. The work of the holy Ghost is to be a Sanctifier and a Comforter.

Q. What do you believe in this Article?

A. I believe, that as Christ redeemed the Church, so the Holy Ghost
sanctifies it; and that through sanctification of the Spirit, I shall receive
the inheritance purchased by Christ; [or, I depend upon him for sanctification
and salvation] our salvation being among those works of God which are
external, that is, terminated in the creature; it is the work of the whole
Trinity, Ephesians. 1.5. Act. 20.28. Rev. 1.4, 5. only as there is an order in their
subsistence, so there is in their operations,] 2 These. 2.13. Tit. 3.5.

Q. How may it appear that you believe in the Holy Ghost?

A. 1. Because my hope and confidence for mercy, is not separated from, nor
greater then is my care to be sanctified: Trial of this faith.
or because I desire sanctification of the Spirit, as well as justification by
Christ. Romans 8.1.13. Psalm. 51.9, 10.

Q How else may this be known?

A. Because I will not grieve the holy Spirit of God, but do endeavor to
follow and be led by the motions, counsels, and directions of the Spirit, and
not of the flect, Romans 8.14. Ephesians. 4.30 [I beg the Spirit to do all my works in
me, a spirit of revelation and renovation; a spirit of consolation and
confirmation, etc.

CAP. XXII.
Of the Church of God.

I believe the holy Catholic Church.

Q. THE gathering of the Church is a fruit of Christ's death and exaltation:
Tell me what is meant by the Church of God?

A. The company of Gods Elect, called and separated from the rest of mankind,
and united unto Christ their head by faith 1 Cor. 1.2. Gal. 1.15. 1 Pet. 2.9.
Heb. 12.23. Ephesians. 5.23, 25, 26. The rest are the Church by calling and
profession only.

Q. From what are they called? And unto what are they called?

A. From sin, and the power of darkness, unto Faith and true Repentance;
from love of the world, to the love of God; from carelessenesse, to conscience
of pleasing God. Col. 1.13. 1 These. 1.9. 1 These: 4.7. 1 Pet. 1.14, 15. Act.
26.18.

Q. By what means are they called?

A. Outwardly by the Word preached, which inwardly is made effectual by the
Holy Ghost to their conversion. 1 These. 1.5. Act. 16.14. 1 Cor. 3.6, 7, 9. 2
Cor. 3.3. [There is an outward calling, and an outward joining to the Church.
Mat. 20.16. 1 Ioh. 2.19. Romans 9.4, 5. But this saves none without the inward
calling, and spiritual ingrafture into Christ. Ioh. 15.2.19. Gal. 1.15. 1 Pet.
2.5. Ephesians. 2.19, 20, 21. Col. 2.19.

Q. These called ones, How be they distinguished?

A. Part of them be in Heaven, The Church Militant and Triumphant, what it is.
having a finished their blessed course, and are called the Church triumphant:
And part is yet on Earth, b combating and striving with corruptions, fears and
temptations from within, and from Satan, and are therefore called the Church
Militant. a Rev. 7.13, 16, 17. Rev: 14 13. Heb. 12.23. 2 Timothy 4.7, 8. b Ephesians.
6.13.

Q. Why is the Church called holy?

A. Because it is made holy by the Word and Spirit; so that no ungodly person
is of the Church, though he be in the Church Romans 2.29. Romans 9.6. 1 Ioh. 2.19.

Q. Why is it called Catholic?

A. Because this company is gathered, not out of one place or people, but out
of all Nations, Languages and Peoples, and in all ages of the world. Rev. 7.9.
Rev. 5.9.

Q. What be the signs by which the societies of men, professing the faith of
Christ, may be known to be the true Churches of Christ?

A. The true Church of God on earth is known by two marks; 1. By the purity of
Doctrine and Faith which they hold and teach. 2. And by the purity of Worship
preserved amongst them from pollutions of Idolatry, and Superstition: [Pure
faith, and pure worship, show a true Church.] Jude verse. 3. Acts 24.14. Hos.
2.2, 4, 5. [Papists call themselves Catholics but falsely being both
Heriticall in Doctrine, and Idolatrous in Worship: a Catholic is a right
believer: All true believers in the world make but one Catholic Church; as
there is but one Christ, one Faith, one Baptism, one Heaven, and one way to
life eternal, Ephesians. 4.5, 6. Heb. 11.40. Those people that maintain Heresy, or
Idolatry, are not the true Churches of Christ. Col. 2.16, 19. 2 Cor. 6.15 Rev.
18.4.

Q. Do you believe in the Church?

A. No; there is no trust nor help in man for matters of salvation, Ps. 49.7,
8, Mic. 6.7.

Q. What then do you believe?

A. I believe that God ever had, and ever, will have, to the end of the world,
a company of faithful people to serve him; and that I am one of the number.

Q. How do you know that you are one of the Church?

A. Because I am not of the world, but have separated my self from the evil
manners, and sinful courses thereof; and do now hear and follow the voice of
Christ. Joh. 10.16. Gal. 1.4. Romans 12.2.

CAP. XXIII.
Of the Communion of Saints.

Q. WHat mean you by the communion of Saints?

A. I mean, that this holy People have a spiritual fellowship with Christ
their Head, and one with another. [The members of the Church are coupled
together with Christ their Head, and one with another] Ephesians. 4.4, 6. 1 John 1.3.

Q. Wherein have they a fellowship with Christ their Head?

A. In all the privileges and riches which God has bestowed on the man
Christ; as in his sufferings, in his graces, righteousness and Kingdom.
[Christ is a Son, so are we; Christ is justified from our sins, so are we: As
Christ the first borne is, such are we in relation unto God] Romans 8.17. Joh.
14.19. Ephesians. 5.30, 32. Joh. 17.24. Joh. 1.16. These places show, that the true
believer has a fellowship with Christ in his Sonship, in his Life, in his
Graces, in his Kingdom.

Q. By what bonds is this spiritual union betwixt Christ and your soul made
up?

A. They be two; one coming from Christ to us, and that is his a Spirit,
whereby he does apprehend and quicken us; the other going from us to Christ,
and b that is our faith, whereby we embrace and hold him fast. [By these two we
are knit unto Christ, and so partake of all his riches.] a 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. 1
Cor. 6.17. Romans 8, 9. b Ephesians. 3.17. Heb. 3.14. Romans 11.20.

Q. How does it appear that you have communion with Christ the Head?

A. By this I know it; because I have the same Spirit of Christ, whereby I am
conformed and made like unto him in all things; his will and ways, his friends
and foes be mine, [even as if the same soul were in two bodies, they would
move alike, and affect the same things.] Col. 2.19. 1 Ioh. 4. 13. 1 Ioh. 1.6.
Joh. 17.21. Romans 8.14. Exek. 10.17. Phil. 2.1, 5.

Q. Wherein have the Saints a fellowship one with another?

A. In faith and love. Ephesians. 2.19.20.

Q. In faith: How?

A. They are all partakers of one Hope, one Spirit, one Faith, one Baptism,
and all go one way to Heaven. [And are all confederate with Christ, to serve
him according to the covenant of faith and obedience, against all sects,
heresies, mis-believers, and loose livers whatsoever.] 1 Cor. 10.1, 4. 2 Pet.
1.1. Ephesians. 4.5, 13. Phil. 1.27. Zeph. 3.9.

Q. In love: How?

A. By that one Spirit, whereof all partake, we are united together in love; so
that all the faithful do love a and esteem each of other, and b communicate
each to other in all good things, ever wishing well to the prosperity of Gods
Church and cause in all the World. a Philem. v. 16, 17. 1 Ioh. 5.1. 1 Pet.
2.17. b Act. 2, 42, 45, 46. Act. 4.32. 1 Cor. 12.13, 25. Psalm. 137.6.

Q. How are the members of the Church called Saints, seeing in many things they
sin?

A. Because they are made holy in part, and are perfectly holy in Christ, [We
must be Saints here, else we shall never be Saints in Heaven.] Ephesians. 1.1. Heb.
12.14.

CAP. XXIV.
Of forgiveness of sins.

Q. WHat is sin?

A. Any transgression of Gods Law. 1 John 3.4. Genesis 3.11.

Q. What is the punishment due to sinners?

A. Eternal death, the curse of God for ever in Hell fire. Romans 6.21, 23. Mat.
25.41.

Q. Are you a sinner?

A. Yes: I was borne in sin, and do daily break Gods holy Laws. Psalm. 51.5.
Romans 5.14. There is sin in Infants.

Q. Shall you then be damned in Hell fire?

A. I deserve damnation; but I believe that through Christ my sins shall be
forgiven me. Rom 8.1.

Q. Are sins forgiven in this life?

A. Yes: now or never. 1 John 2.12. Col. 1.13. Mat. 9.2. Rev. 2.17. Romans 5.5.
The conscience is now absolved, and it shall be hereafter declared solemnly
before Men and Angels. Act. 3.19.

Q. What is forgiveness of sins?

A. It is a free and full discharge of a sinner from the guilt and punishment
of sin; so that in Gods sight they are as if they had never been. Esa. 43.25.
Mic. 7.18, 19. Romans 8.33, 34. The afflictions and miseries which the Godly
endure in this World, are not punishments for sin, in a way of justice, and
satisfaction for sin, (as if they were the cause why sins are forgiven to us)
1. Because Christ alone has borne the chastisement of our peace, and none of
the people with him. 2. Because the afflictions of the Godly are for the good
of the party afflicted, and not in a way of revenge, to satisfy divine
justice. 3. And not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed
in us.

Q. Who does forgive sins?

A. God alone, who is offended and dishonored by them. Mar. 2.7, 9. Lu. 23.34.
Men do forgive one another the Trespass, but not the sin, as it is sin.

Q. Why, and for whose sake, does God forgive sins?

A. For Christ's sake, without respect to any thing that we can do, or suffer.
1 Job. 2 12. Act. 2.38. Ephesians. 4.32. Romans 3.24.

Q. Why for Christ's sake?

A. Because he being surety of the New Covenant, has in my nature, room, and
stead, answered the Law, and pacified Gods wrath. 2 Cor. 5.21. Heb. 7.22.

Q To what manner of persons is remission of sins granted in the Gospel?

A. To them only that believe, and repent, and amend their lives, and turn
from the evil of their doings. Luk 13.3. Mar. 16.16. Ezekiel. 18.21. Esaias 1.18.
Act. 16.31. Joh. 5.24.

Q. Do you think in your conscience that your sins in particular be forgiven?

A. Yes; that is it I believe in this Article: namely that I am of the number
of those that have their sins forgiven them. 1 Ioh. 5.13 Romans 10.9.

Q. What signs be there that your sins be forgiven you? How will you know it?

A. By three signs. 1. Where sin is forgiven, it is subdued and purged out.
[The issue of our corruption is stanched and dried up, when once we have
touched Christ by faith, and have his blood sprinkled on our consciences. Mar.
5.29. Act. 3.26. Romans 6.11, 14. [ Peace, without Grace, is not of Gods sending,
it is a false peace: but if we be healed and cleansed of sin, we are forgiven,
though we fear the contrary. Col. 2.13.]



A. The persuasion that God has forgiven me, begets in my heart a strong love,
and high prizing of Jesus Christ. Luke 7.42, 47. Zach. 12.10. 2 Cor. 5.14.



A. It makes me ready to a forgive others, and to b pity them that go on in
their sins impenitently, as I my self have done heretofore. a Ephesians. 4.31, 32.
Mat. 18.32, 33. b Luke 22.32.

CAP. XXV.
Of resurrection of the flesh, and everlasting life.

Q. SHall they that be dead live again?

A. Yes; at the last day every one shall come again with his own body. Act.
24.15. Jude. v. 14. Job 19.24, 25, 27. Dan. 12.2. Mat. 22.32. Joh. 11.24. 1
Cor. 15.12.

Q. Shall the very same body live again and be raised?

A. Yes, the same bodies, made free from all defects and weaknesses, unto which
we are now subjected. 1 Cor. 15.43, 53. Phil. 3.2 1. Joh. 5.28, 29. Rev. 20.12.

Q. How doch the belief of the resurrection work upon you?

A. It makes me keep a conscience void of offense before God and men,
continuing in well-doing with courage and patience. [I will not be corrupted
with worldly honors or pleasures.] Act. 24.16. 1 Cor. 15.33, 34, 58. 2 Cor.
9.10. Heb. 11.35.

And the life everlasting.
Q. When a man dies, his body goes to the grave: Does the soul die with the
body, like the beasts?

A. No; the soul is an immortal substance, and separated from the body at
death. Eccles. 12.7. 1 King. 17.21. Luke 23: 43, 46. Mat. 22.32. 2 Cor. 5.6, 8.
Luke 12.5.

Q. Whither then go the souls of them that depart hence?

A. To Heaven, or to Hell, to everlasting life, or to everlasting death;
immediately after their dissolution. Luke 16.22, 23. Heb. 9.27. Col. 1.20. Rev.
14.13. Rev. 6.9. Phil. 1.23. 2 Cor. 5.8.

Q. Then there is no Purgatory, or third place, where, as in a prison, by
enduring exquisite torments, the souls that were not fully purged in this
life, do make satisfaction for venial sins, and lighter faults; or for their
temporal punishment due to their mortal sins, which they have committed?
from which Purgatory they say they are delivered by the prayers of the living,
and the Popes indulgencies; or at least at the day of judgment, if they chance
to lie there so long.

A. No; for as there be but two sorts of men, godly or wicked, sheep or goats,
regenerate or unregenerate: so there be but two places provided for them, where
they remain in an unchangeable estate of bliss, or woe: [All a wicked men, of
what profession soever, being punished with everlasting perdition from the
presence of God: and b all the faithful are present with the Lord, their
souls being fully purged from all spot of sin; and the fault c quite remitted
through the blood of Christ. a 2 These. 1.9. Mat. 25.41, 46, Romans 2.9. b 2 Cor.
5.6, 8. Rev. 14.13. c 1 John 1.7. Ephesians. 5.27.

Q. What is meant by life everlasting?

A. It is the glorious state of the Elect after this life, wherein they do
immediately enjoy God and Christ for ever, in a most holy, happy, unutterable
and unchangeable communion. 1 John 3.2. Rev: 22.4. Rev. 21.3, 4. 1 These. 4.17.
Psalm. 16.11. 1 Cor. 2.9.

Q. For whom is eternal life prepared? To whom is it given?

A. To them that walk with God, a finishing their course in fear and
holiness; and b endeavoring to glorify God here on earth. a Mat. 5.8. Heb.
12, 14. Joh. 10.27, 28. Rev. 21.27. Rev. 22.14. b Ioh. 17.4. 2 Timothy 4.8. Mat.
25.21.

Q What do you believe in this Article?

A. I believe that at the last day my soul and body shall be joined together
again, and that in both I shall enjoy the presence of God for evermore. Tit.
1.2. 1 These. 4.17. 1 Ioh. 2.25.

Q. Why do you think that you shall enjoy this blessed life?

A. Because the life of grace is already begun in me, which shall end in
glory. 1 John: 3.3. Mat. 19.28, 29. Romans 6.22. Phil. 1.6. 1 Pet. 1.23

Q. May a Christian be assured of everlasting life, before he depart this
present life?

A. Yes he may, and that upon sure and infallible grounds, out of Gods Word,
wherein we clearly see Gods promises and purposes toward them that be
effectually called. [Faith is a sure knowledge of a thing upon the authority of
divine revelation, which cannot deceive, nor be deceived.] Joh. 3.36. 1 John:
5.11.12. 1 John 4.10, 14, 19, 24. Ephesians. 1.14. 2 Cor. 1.22. 1 These. 1.4, 5. 2
Pet. 1.10. 2 Cor. 13.5.

The office and work of faith is twofold; to 1. Justify the person* 2. Purify
the heart.


CAP. XXVI.
Of the fruit and office of faith, viz. to justify, and of the means how faith
is wrought.

Q. WHat Benefits redound to thee of this belief?

A. Two. 1. By Faith I am righteous before God, and heir of eternal life; not
because my faith of it self can make me righteous, but because the
righteousness of Christ is my righteousness before God; and I cannot apply it
to my self by any other way then by faith. [God offers us life and
righteousness in Christ; and faith is the hand by which we recieve that gift.]
Romans 4.5, 6. Joh. 6.35. 1 John 5.11, 12, 13. Romans 3.24, 25.

Q. Say the same in other terms.

A. When I say, we are justified by faith, I mean the object of faith, Christ
Jesus. [The only way and mean to embrace Christ, and to rest on the promises
of the Gospel, is by faith:] Phil. 3.9. The only righteousness by which a
sinner stands just before God, is the righteousness of Christ; and the only
means, to partake of that righteousness, is by Faith, Romans 9.32.

Q. It seems then that faith is a most excellent gift of God, which brings
us into the possession of Gods rich mercies, and tender love revealed in the
Gospel?

A. It is so; and therefore above all things we must labor for the grace of
faith. John 6.29. Joh. 3.18. Act. 16.31. Heb. 4.2, 11. Heb. 3.12, 14, 19.

Q. Can we attain it of our selves by our own strength?

A. No; a it is the gift of God; our hearts are b slow to believe, being
naturally inclined to distrust God, and to trust in the creatures; and
therefore c God by his holy Spirit draws our hearts to embrace his gracious
promises. a Heb. 12.2. Ephesians. 2.8. b Luke 24.25. Mar. 9.24. Number. 20.12. 2 Chronicles.
16.7, 9. Mat. 14.31. Luke 18.9. c 1 Cor. 2.9, 11. Joh. 6.44, 45.

Q. Why must we strive, seeing it is Gods gift?

A. Yes; because God has appointed means whereby he will bestow all graces on
us; and therefore if we seek him in those means, we shall find him; and if we
neglect those means, it is a sign we have no grace, nor can we ever hope to
have any. Mar. 4.24. 1 Cor. 3.7, 9. Romans 10.14, 15. Prove. 2.1, 2, 3. Mat.
13.44. Act. 16.14. 1 Cor. 12.6.

Q. Why secondly must we strive?

A. Because faith and all other graces be contrary to our corrupt nature, and
therefore we must give the more diligence to attain the same at Gods hand. [As
he that plants a graft contrary to nature, must use the more care; and because
we cannot cure our selves, we must seek and beg some one to put us into the
pool when the waters be moved.] Phil. 2.12, 13. Esaias 26.12. Heb. 6.11, 12. Romans
11.24. 2 Pet. 1.10.

Q. By what means does God usually work faith in us?

A. By two Means. 1. By the knowledge of the Law, convincing us of sin. Mat.
3.2, 3. Ioh. 16.9. Romans 4.15. Gal. 3.22, 24. This is but preparative. Hos.
10.12.

Q. But what is the chief means by which God does work faith in us?

A. By the preaching of the Gospel, by which it is also increased. [And
therefore if we desire to have faith, we must hear and obey the Gospel; the
Word of the Kingdom must be rooted in our hearts and affections.] 1 Pet. 1.23.
2 Cor. 10.4, 5. Romans 1.16. Luke 8.13, 15 Gal. 3.2.

Q. How does the Doctrine of the Gospel bring about the heart from security,
and false confidences, to believe on Christ for salvation?

A. Two ways especially. To rest in any thing short of Christ; is a false
confidence.
1. By inviting us to come unto Christ: The Spirit does convince us of sin, and
damnation, and that we have need of the righteousness of another to save us.
Luke 13.3. Joh. 16.9. Joh. 5.45. Joh. 8.24. Phil. 3, 3, 8.9. Matt. 9 13. [By
the law is the knowledge of sin: but to make us fly from the Law, and to be
dead to it, and to seek salvation by a righteousness without us, this is the
work of the Gospel. Romans 7.4. The Gospel inviting, commanding, and calling
us to Christ's righteousness, it does cause us to renounce and forsake all hope
of righteousness by works of the Law; the Gospel puts a spirit into the
letter of the Law: The Gospel awaking us, and bidding us to repent, and go to
Christ for salvation, does make use of the Law, to show us our danger and our
insufficiency to save our selves, and consequenly, a necessity of believing in
Christ.

Q. How secondly does the Gospel work the heart to believe?

A. 2. By showing us such a fullness and al sufficiency in Christ, that of him,
and in him, we have all things needful for salvation: [it shows and assures
the conscience, that God is satisfied, and well pleased with us in Christ.]
Act. 13.32, 33, 34. John 1.16, 17. Col. 1.13, 14, 19.

Q. What follows thereof?

A. Therefore they that meddle not with the Scripture, and regard not the
Ministry of it on the Lords day, but slight it, or scoff at the preaching
thereof, show plainly that they have no faith, Romans 15.4. Romans 10.14, 17.

CAP. XXVII.
Of the second office and work of Faith, viz. to purify the heart, and work
by love: Here follows the life of a believer, and the first end and use of the
Moral Law.

Fourth heal of Christian doctrine.
Q. WHat is the second office of Faith?

A. To purify the heart, working it to an obedient walking in all the
Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, [so that I shall not profess one
thing, and do another] Jam: 2.17, 21, 26. Act: 15.9. [it is ever purging out
corruption.]

Q. The rule of obedience, in general, is the whole written word of God, and
more summarily the moral Law, contained in the ten Commandments: Tell me now;
Is the Law of the ten Commandments still in force?

A. Yes; and whosoever does, or teaches otherwise, shall be least in the
Kindome of Heaven, that is none at all, Mat: 5.18, 19. Rom: 3.19, 31. Rom:
7.12. As touching the ceremonial Law, that which was a sin or duty then, is
not a sin or duty now under the Gospel; and therefore the ceremonial Law is
not in force now, as to our practice. But as touching the moral Law, that
which was a sin then, is a sin now, as lying, perjury, etc. which shows that
the moral Law is still in force now, under the time of the Gospel.

Q. Is the Law given that we should look for life and solvation by it?

A. No? because by it all the world is guilty before God; [If we were without
sin, we should be saved by the Law: but being all wretched sinners, the Law
curses us and we must look elsewhere for a worthiness to answer Gods
judgment.] Rom: 7.4, 6. Rom: 3.20. 23. Gal: 3.17

Q. To what use then was the Law given?

The first use of the Moral Law.
A, There is a twofold use of it. 1. To convince us that we are under sin and
wrath, that so we might be brought to seek salvation in Christ alone. Gal.
3.19, 24.

Q. How does the Law force a sinner unto Christ?

A. There be five effects or operations of the Law, whereby it drives one to
Christ. known in its true greatness and sinfulness, both for the extent and
danger of it. [By the Law we come to know our selves to be greater sinners, and
in worse case then we could imagine, we find and feel that to be sin, which
before we knew not; and many things to be greater evils, exposing us to greater
wrath then heretofore we conceived; as our natural corruption, the first
motions unto sin, etc.] Rom: 3.20. Romans 7.7, 8, 9, 13. Rom: 5.13.

Q. What is the second work of the Law forcing us to seek Christ?

A. It shows us how far short we come, and how unable we are to do any one
thing that is good, in any measure, manner, and degree, as is required. [Many
think they are holy, and please God well enough, because they know not the
holiness and rigor of the Law.] Romans 7.11, 13, 18. Mat. 19.18, 20.



A. By it we find and feel the emnity and contrariety that is in our nature
against God: Tell a man of his sin, or duty, O the heart is sad upon it, the
Law is a burden to him, the heart rebels against it, and could even wish there
were no such Law, yea no God to take vengeance. [ Sin is a burden to a
regenerate person, but Gods Law is not grievous to him. 1 John 5.3. On the
other side, to a carnal man, sin is pleasing, and duty a burden: the duties
of the Law being brought and pressed on the soul, do show how hollow and
rotten we are, which otherwise we should never have mistrusted by our selves.]
To. 7.9, 9, 10, 13. Romans 8.7.

Q. What fourth work of the Law brings a sinner to Christ?

A. It works wrath, that is, it lays the curse upon us; it proclaims the
judgment of God against us for every sin: [It curses every disobedience; it
tells every soul of us, thou art a domned creature, etc.] To. 1.18. Romans 4.15.
2 Cor. 3.7, 9. The Law is full of rigor. do it, or dye: This is the case of
all that be out of Christ, the Law curses them.



A. When we see that we are shut up, and cannot wind our selves out of Gods
wrathful hands; the soul even drowned with sorrow and fear, is constrained to
go to Christ, upon the invitation of the Gospel: The soul does hereupon
consult and advise with it self, what to do to be saved, and so at length
resolves to go to Christ; this is one use of the Moral Law, viz. to make us
see, 1. How vile we are. 2. How weak we are, 3. How wicked we are; what enemies
to God and goodness. 4. How cursed we are. 5. And so to consult within our
selves, and to resolve to go to Christ, as that prodigal did, Luke 15.17, 18.
and those Lepers. 2 King. 7.3, 4.

Thus the Law and the Gospel work together for our salvation: it is not in me
to save you, says the Law, therefore seek further: It is in me to save you,
says the Gospel, therefore rest in me. Act. 2.37. Mat. 11.28. Romans 8.15. And
so the soul is converted and drawn unto Christ by the Gospel, being driven
from the Law, by the Law it self.

CAP. XXVIII.
Of the second end and use of the Moral Law.

Q. WE have seen the first maine use of the Moral Law: What is the second?

A. To be a perpetual rule of obedience and holiness. Second Use of the
Moral Law.
[and it is therefore called the Moral Law.] Mat. 19.17. Romans 2.25. Romans 7.12.
Heb. 8.10. 1 Timothy 1.5, 8. Jam. 2.10, 11. The Law shows us what is good, and
what is bad.

Q. Our obedience is but in part here: What be the properties of that obedience
which God will accept of his servants?

True obedience, what.
A. 1. It must be a free, a loving, submitting of the b inward and outward man
to the c whole will of God, with an intention d and desire to please and
approve our selves to him in every thing we do. [This is the nature of true
obedience; a the ground and rule of obedience, is the will of creature obeying,
is the inward manner is free, without compulsion; d the end and aim of all, is
to please God, not men, or our selves; and by these properties true obedience
is differenced from mere civil honesty, and restraining grace in hypocrites] a
Mat. 15.9. Esa 1.12. b Romans 6.13, 17. c Psalm. 40.8. and 119.6, 80. Mat. 5.20.
Jam. 2.10. d H. s. 7.14. Zach. 7.5, 6 Romans 14.6. Joh. 5.30. John 7.18. Esaias
10.7. Mat. 6.6.

Q. Is there any worthiness in our works to procure to us Gods favor?

A. None at all; our best works done before we be regenerate, are utterly
corrupt, and cannot please God. [The evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit.]
Joh. 3.6. Romans 8.8. Mat. 7.18. Phil. 3.8.

Q. But what say you of the works we perform after regeneration?

A. Though God in mercy, for Christ's sake, do accept of our endeavors to
please him, yet our very best works are stained with many imperfections. [And
therefore have need of forgiveness, etc.] Luke 17.10. Romans 7.21. Esa. 64.6.
Tit. 3.5. Mat. 20.10, 14. When the Scripture speaks of rewarding our works,
Mat. 10.42. and Mat. 6.6. It is a reward of Grace, not of Debt; Neh. 13.22.
Remember me, and spare me. The rewards of God must needs be full of Grace,
seeing he promises to reward Begging and praying: and a cup of cold water,
which is of little worth.

Q. It seems then that God does receive us into his favor, without any
consideration of our works, of his mere mercy in Christ alone, imputing his
righteousness unto us, and not our frailties.

A. It is most true; for we are saved by faith in Christ, without the works of
the Law. Romans 3.28. Romans 11.6.

Q. But does justification by faith make men despisers of good duties contained
in Gods Law?

A. By no means; for faith is the very life and root of all good works. [And
the reason, why many do not perform works of obedience, is, because they have
not faith] Heb. 11.7, 8, 17, 25, 27. Iam. 2.22. Luke 17.3, 5. Esaias 7.4, 12. 1
Pet. 3.5. The more faith, Faith answers all objections, it removes carnal
reasoning, and so brings the heart to obey in all things.
the more obedience. Gal. 5.6.

Q. The Law being the rule of obedience, we ought to be careful to know it,
and to lead our lives by it.

A. Yes: For both he that knows it not, and he that obeyes it not, shall be
beaten with many stripes. Luke 12.47, 48.

Q. How many Commandments be there?

A. Ten: Ten words. Deuteronomy. 4.13.

Q. What sorts of duties does the Law of God contain?

A. Two sorts. 1. Duties that immediately concern Gods Glory and Worship, in the
four first precepts. 2. And duties that more immediately respect our
Neighbors good, in the six last. Mar. 12.29, 30, 31, 33. Mat. 22.37, 40. Thus
are the Ten Commandments divided.

Q. What motives are there to stir us up to the keeping of this Law in all the
points of it?

A. Two. 1. Because God is the Lawgiver; God spoke every one of those words;
and where God has a voice to speak, we ought to have an ear to hear, and an
heart to obey: God sets his stamp upon them all. Iam. 4.12. Heb. 2.2. Rom:
7.12. The law is holy, just and good.

Q. Why secondly must we carry an awful regard to this Law?

A. Because he is Jehovah, our God, our maker, our deliverer, and therefore may
justly challenge obedience at his creatures hands. [Love and fear ought to
keep us in obedience] Mal. 1.6. Es. 5.4. Deuteronomy. 10.12. Jer. 2.9, 13, 19. Mic.
6.3. Esaias 43.23, 24. Deuteronomy. 7.6, 11. Deuteronomy. 26.17, 19. [the strongest and
sweetest bond of obedience is that relation between God and us.]

CAP. XXIX.
Q. THe first Table of the Law of God contains four Commandments: What is the
sum and substance of it?

A. The first Table of the Law teaches and requires, 1. That I cleave unto
God with my heart. 2. That I worship him with my soul and body, in the duties
of Religion, and Divine Worship. 3. That I honor him with my Tongue and Life.
4. And that I carefully keep his Sabbaths.

Of the first Commandment. Thou shall have no other Gods, etc.
Q. WHat is the purpose of God in this first Commandment?

A. That we should take Jehovah, the only true God, for our God, and set him up
in our hearts in his due place, that is, above the creature; Of spiritual and
inward worship.
to love and fear him; to serve, trust and obey him. [We must reserve unto him
all that pre-eminence of honor, fear, love and trust, which is due to him as
a God, and not to give any part thereof to the creature. To honor a King as if
he were but a private person, is not to give him his due, because it is beneath
his place: God must have his full pre-eminence in our hearts.] Mar. 12.29, 30.
Mat. 4.4, 10. Thus does Christ expound this Commandment.

Q. What particular duties are commanded under this general, that so God may
be thy God?

A. Five. 1. I am hereby bound to know God in his Nature, 1. Knowledge.
Will, and Attributes, else I shall never love him, nor trust in him. 1 Chronicles:
28.9. Romans 12.2. Ioh. 17.3. To. 10.14.

Q. What, secondly? 2. Trust.


A. We are bound to believe on him, to depend and stay our selves on him for
every good thing we need, not being disheartened in our duties, nor stepping out
to false helps in evil times. Jer: 17.5.7. 2 Chronicles: 20.20. Psalm: 31.6, 7.
Psalm: 11.1, 2. Job 31.24. Jonah 2.8. Dan: 3.16. Dan: 6.23.

Q. What, thirdly, is here required?

Q. I am bound to love and delight in him as the chiefest good, above father,
3. Love.
lands credit, profit, or life it self. Mat: 10.37. 1 Samuel: 2.29. Mat: 19.22,
29.

Q. What fourth duty?

A. I am bound to fear him, 4. To fear him.
to stand in awe of his Majesty, not daring to offend him in any thing for any
respect. [The object of godly fear, is the evil of sin, the offending of
God. 1 King: 8.3, 12. Esaias 51.12. Esaias 8.2, 13. Jer 2.19 [In all these God must
have his full pre-eminence; for if we love, fear trust, or delight in any
thing against God, or above God, then that is our God,]

Q. What fifth duty is required?

A. I am bound to acknowledge him, and to make outward profession, 5. To
confess him,
that God is the Lord whom we serve; that he is governor, preserver and
rewarder of all men; the searcher of all hearts; and that no God can do as the
does: [There is none other to whom any of these can be applied.] Dan: 4.37. 1 Chronicles: 29.10, 11. Esaias 26.13. 1 Cor: 1.31. Mar: 8.38. Jer: 10.6, 7.

Q. What is the thing here generally forbidden?

A. The thing here forbidden, is, the giving of any divine honor to the
creature; the setting up of the creature in our hearts, to withdraw us from God.

Q. Tell me particularly who be the transgressors of this Commandment?

A. Seven sorts of persons. 1. All ignorant persons, Ignorance of God.
that either (a) naturally, o^ (b) carelessly, or willingly remain ignorant of
God, and his will concerning us. (a) Ephesians: 4.17, 18. (b) Job 21.14. Ioh 3.20 2
Pet: 3.5.

Q. Who else?

Disobedience.
A. They that have knowledge severed from obedience; such as profess to know
God, but in their works and ways deny him. [These do not take Jehovah for
their God.] Tit: 1.16. Rom: 1.^8.

Q. Who thirdly do sin against this Commandmemt?

A. All Atheists, and Idolaters; that is, Atheism and Idolatry.
all such as think there is no God, or that there be more Gods then one; or
that God is like to any thing made by Art, in Carving and Painting -- Also
whosoever do give any divine honor, worship, and service to any Creature: All
such persons be either Atheists, or Idolaters; They fancy to themselves some
other God. Romans 1.23. Act. 14.15. 1 Cor. 8.3, 6, 10. Rev. 19.10. Rev. 22.9.

Q. Who fourthly?

A. All superstitions persons; that is, Superstition.
such as ascribe any spiritual or supernatural effect (good or bad) to
ceremonies, and observation of things; the observation whereof has no ground
in nature, nor divine institution. [as to the crying and flying of birds,
bleeding at the nose, the hare crossing us in our journey, etc. Also in
Religion, ascribing supernatural and spiritual effects, worth, excellency, or
acceptablenesse, to ceremonies devised by man; as to anointing with oil,
signing with the cross, sprinkling with Holy Water, consecration of Temples,
Vestme^ts, Altars, etc.] Mar. 7.4, 5, 8. Col. 2.21. 1 Samuel 4.3. Ezekiel. 21.19,
21. Jer. 10.2, 3. It is Gods prerogative to give grace, and also to institute
any sign or token of Grace, or to make any thing to be an effectual means of
applying any spiritual good to the soul; and therefore it is an injury done
to God, to ascribe that which is due to him, unto men's inventions, etc.

Q. Who, fifthly, be the transgressors of this Commandment?

A. All such as seek to Wizards, Wiches, Conjurers, Soothsayers, or to Saint or
Angel for help. Seeking to Witches for help.
[All that step out of any unlawful shifts in distress, etc. all these do
forsake Jehovah, and cleave to the creature.] Deuteronomy. 18.9, 10. Act. 8.10, 11. 1 Chronicles. 10.13, 14. Esaias 47.12, 13.

Q. Who, sixthly?

Unbelief and despare.
A. They that doubt and despair of Gods truth and love made known, and will
not commit their souls and estates to him. [It is a sin to doubt and refuse
any part of Gods truth and promises; the highest degree of unbelief, is
despair.] Esa. 7.9. He. 3.19. Mat. 6.30. Joh. 20.25. Mat. 8.26. Job 27.10. Job
15.22. These deny God the Honor due to him.

To be ashamed of God and godliness.
Q. Who, lastly, be transgressors of this Commandment?

A. All that be ashamed of God, and deny him here before men in any degree; as
in his Word, Ways, Worship, Children and ordinances, Joh. 12.43. Luke 22.57. 2 Timothy 4.16. Mat. 11.9. 2 Timothy: 2.12.

Q. What follows hereof?

A. That if we do not make conscience of these duties, and care to avoid these
sins, we be under the Law; that is, under the sentence of it, to be judged by
it. [Where sin reigns, the Law reigns, and is in force against thee.] Romans
6.14.

CAP. XXX.
Of the second Commandment. Thou shall not make unto thee any graven Image.

Q. WHat is the purpose of God in this Commandment?

A. To preserve his outward worship pure and undefiled, from all superstition
and Idolatry, from all inventions of man, and to keep us to that entire manner
of worship which himself has appointed: so is this Commandment expounded in
Scripture* Number. 15.39. Deuteronomy. 12.30, 32. Psalm. 106.38, 39. Esaias 8.20. whatsoever
is made use of, for the tendering up our Homage unto God, or for the conveying
of any spiritual efficacy from God into the hearts of his servants; it must
have an institution from God, else we sin against God, who alone has power to
give any grace, and to appoint the means of obtaining it. The first Commandment
requires, that we worship the only true God, and that we do not give his
properties and honor to another: the second Commandment prescribes the true
manner of worshipping that true God.

Q. Well then; here we are forbidden to worship God after our own wits and wills
What is particularly forbiden in this kind?

1. Images for religious use.
A. 1. The making of any Image, either of God, or of any Creature, for
religious use, that is, to help us in our worshipping of God. [The likeness
and representation of any thing whatsoever, is a false help und mean of
worship.] Exodus 32.1, 4. Ps. 106.20. Jer. 10.8, 14, 15. Ezekiel. 8.10. Jer. 50.38.
Jer. 51.17, 18, 19.

Q. Is it unlawful to make an Image of the Trinity, or of any Person in the
Godhead?

Pictures of God unlawful.
A. It is utterly unlawful, and a great dishonor, to figure the incorruptible
God, by the shape of a base and corruptible man, or bird, or other creature.
Deuteronomy. 4.15, 16, 17, 18. Romans 1.23. Act. 17.24, 29, Esa. 40.15, 18, 19. Hab.
2.8. [It abuses our understandings: the party thinks there is some good in an
Image, else he would not make it; and that is a lie: He lies that shows me a
Toad, and says it is the picture of an Angel; so, etc. All the pictures of
Christ in the flesh, as that on Christ on the Cross, and resurrection, are
lies, false in their representations, and false in the conceit of any good by
them.]

Q. Is it unlowfull to make the image of a man, or Angel, or other creature,
to help us in the worship of the Creator?

A. It is utterly unlawful to make, or to have the likeness of any creature
for religious use, to serve God thereby, in, at, or before it. [To think that
by doing any part of worship before an Image, one shall please God the better,
or that it will be a mean of good unto us; this is to rob God of his due: What
promise of Gods presence, audience or acceptance before an Image, do you find
in the whole Scripture? etc. Esaias 42.8. 2 Kings 18.4. 1 Ioh. 5.21. Rev. 9.20.
Ezekiel. 8.10, 11. Act. 7.43. 1 Chronicles. 14.12. Deuteronomy. 27.15, the congregation are
bound to curse this man. v. 26.

Thou shall not bow down to them, nor serve them.
2. All outward respect done to Images. vid. Catechis. Romans part. 3. c. 2.
Q. What is forbidden in those words?

A. 2. We are forbidden to give any honor, or outward reverence, to any Image;
as, to come before it, to make our prayers, to bow the knee, to put off the
cap, or to show any token or reverence unto it. [It is a cursed thing to do
any honor to an Image in word, by speaking favorable of it; or in deed, as to
put off the hat to bow the knee, to give money and offerings for the
maintenance of it, or to be at the feasts held in honor of the creatures,
etc.] 1 King. 19.18. Hos. 13.2. 1 Cor. 9.7, 10. with 1 Cor. 10 14, 20, 21. Dan.
3.5, 11, 18. Exodus: 32.5, 6. Ezekiel. 18.6. Judge. 6.31. Esaias 66.3. 2 Chr. 25.14. we
must not kiss the Calves, nor bless an Idol.

Q. What, thirdly, is here forbidden?

3. All helping forward of Idolatry.
A. All outward service, tending to the honor, worship, and service of Saints,
Angels, Images, or any other creature whatsoever. [As the building of Temples,
dedicating of Days, Altars, Garments, Priests, Feasts to them, and raising of
money for the maintenance thereof.] Hos. 8.14: Hos. 10.1, 2. 1 King: 12.32, 33.
Esaias 46.6. Exodus 32.2.

Q. Under this gross sin of making and worshipping of Images, are condemned
all other superstitious corruptings of Gods worship without an Image. Now, How
is Gods worship corrupted without an Image?

A. By will worship; that is, all such means and manner of divine worship, 4.
Will Worship, and humane traditions.
as is not prescribed by God, but brought in by man: [It is will worship to
observe what God has not commanded, and to forbear what God has not
forbidden, for conscience sake.] as going to God by Saints, worshipping of
Angels; vows of continency, placing of holiness in meats, days, garments,
and places. Lastly, the inventing or using of New Sacraments (as the Popish
Mass, and the five new Sacraments) Adoration of the Altar; and of the
consecrated Elements of Bread and Wine; together with all religious Ceremonies
and Rites in and about the worship of God, wherein is placed any holiness,
virtue, necessity, or efficacy: All such manners and forms of worship be
obhorred of the Lord. Col. 2.18, 21. 23. 2 Chronicles. 28.3.4. 1 King. 12.33. Ier.
19.5.

Q. Why are such things unlawful?

A. Because they be imposed or taken up for Conscience sake, and made the
matter of Gods worship, according to the Traditions and Commandments of men,
without any Authority of God. Mat. 15.9, 20. Esaias 29.13. Mar. 7.4, 7. Act.
17.25. To place holiness, or sin, or duty, in any invention, and ordinances of
Men, is a superstition of deluded and seduced souls.

Q. What is the thing commanded in this precept?

A. That we worship God with a pure worship, that is, by those means, and in
that manner, as God himself has prescribed. (as has been showed in the first
question) Tell me next:

Q. What be the chief Parts of Gods outward worship under the New Testament?

A. They be four. 1. The a Preaching and hearing of the Word. 2ly, The
exercise b of Prayer, public and private. 3ly, The c administration of the
Sacraments. 4ly, And singing of d Psalms. a Act. 2.42. Luke 4.16. Act: 13.15.
b 1 Timothy 2.1, 8. Act. 16.13, 16. 1 Cor. 1, 2. c 1 Cor. 11.23. d For singing of
Psalms read. 1 Chronicles. 16.7, 9. Act: 16.25. 1 Cor. 14.26. with 1 Chronicles. 25.3.
Col. 3.16.

Q. In what manner must this worship of God be performed?

A. First, for the inward man; Care of the inward man in Gods worship.
each part of Gods worship must pe performed, 1. In a faith, with feeling
affection, b 2. And with a clean heart. 3. Not c resting in the work done, but
desiring to please God, and expecting a blessing by them. a Romans 14.23 2 Chronicles.
17.6. Psalm. 63.1, 2. Psa. 84.2, 6. b Ezekiel. 33.31, 32. Mat. 15.8. Ezekiel: 14.3.
Psalm. 50.16. Esaias 1.11. Job 16.17. c Ier. 7.4, 10, 11. Hos. 7.14. Zach. 7.5.
Mal. 1.7, 8, 13, 14. Mal: 3.14. 1 Pet: 2.2. [Exercises of Religion must be
performed, not only as a duty, but as a means of grace.]

Q. How must Gods worship and service be performed by the outward man?

A. With such humility and reverence, And of the outward man.
as becomes people that have to do with an holy Lord God. Heb. 12.28, 29. 1
Cor. 11.22, 28, 29. Act. 20.9. [It is a sin either to disuse or to neglect the
outward worship of God, or to perform the same carelessly. Reverend Gestures of
the Body, as Kneeling, Bowing, lifting up of Hands and Eyes, putting off the
Hat, etc. are forbidden to be given to an Image; therefore they are commanded
to be given unto God.] 1 Cor. 15 13. 2 Samuel 6.3, 7, 8.

Q. What duty is here required, as an help, to further the outward worship of
God.

A. We must provide all such means, by which the worship of God may be erected,
defended and maintained. Mal. 1.10. 1 Cor. 9.13, 14. [We must plead for
Religion, and be at cost for it: take away Arts, Tongues, Schools, Colleges,
and Maintenance, you will soon have no preaching, nor any worship of God.]
Helping service is forbidden to Images, bur required for Gods Worship.

Q. Why should we be so careful to avoid Images and Will Worship?

A. Because such persons be indeed haters of God; however they say, they do it
with good intentions, and in greater honor and reverence to God. [As the
unchaste Wife does not love her husband, what ere she profess.] Prove. 6.34, 35.
Hos. 2.2, 13. 2 Chronicles. 19 3. Esaias 30.1. God will visit this iniquity of the
Fathers upon the Children to the third and fourth generation of them that Hate
him.

CAP. XXXI.
Of the third Commandment. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain, etc.

Q. WHat is the drift of this third Commandment?

A. To provide for the glorifying of Gods great name, in our tongue and doings;
that we so behave our selves, as God in all things may be glorified. [This
Commandment directs us to an holy use of all Religion, and of every thing upon
which God has set his name.] 1 Pet. 4.11. Levit. 10.3. Joh. 2.16. Ezekiel. 22.26.
Mal: 1.13. Ezekiel. 8.12. Ezekiel. 18.2, 19. Deuteronomy. 28.58. Mat. 5.16. Mat. 6.9. Joh.
11.4. Joh. 15.8.

Gods name is taken in vain, either In an Oath, Or, Without an Oath.


Q. How many ways is it taken in vain in an Oath?

A. Four. 1. By vain, and needless, and customary swearing in men's common
talk: Oaths cannot come unawares from a gracious heart, much less ordinarily.
Eccles: 9.2. Iam. 3.12. Mat. 5.34.37. Ier. 6.7.

Q. How, secondly?

A. By false swearing; as when we a affirm a falsehood, or deny and conceal the
truth, b or falsify what we have promised by oath. [This is called perjury.] a
Zach. 5.4. Mal. 3.5. Lev. 5.1. Zach: 8. 16, 17. b Psalm. 15.4. Ezekiel. 17.16, 18.
with Judge: 9.20, 56, 57. 2 Samuel 21.1, 7. with Josh. 9.15. Men are perjured,
when they go from what they have promised by Oath, as well as when they swear
an untruth.

Q. How, thirdly?

A. By wicked swearing, that is, when by an oath, or vow, we bind our selves to
do evil, to do any thing against charity, piety, justice, duty. [As that I
will not come to such a man's house, or that I will be revenged on him: Also all
sinful combinations, Covenants and Oaths, to hide evil, or to set up any
pretended good, contrary to Authority, Law, and duty; or contrary to any former
Oaths and Protestations All this is wicked swearing: for Gods ordinance must
not be a bond of iniquity.] 1 King. 19.2. Act. 23.12. 1 Samuel: 25.22. Hos. 10.2,
3, 4. See Iunius and Diodate in loc.

Q. How, fourthly, do men take Gods name in vain in an Oath?

A What they swear by the creatures, as many do by their Faith and Troth, by
the Mass, by their Drink, or, as I live, etc. [vainly, customarily, or in
passion.] Mat. 5.33, 34. Jam, 5.12. For these things men are damned. Amos 8.14.
Zeph. 1.5. Esa. 45.23.

Q. But is it not lawful to swear before a Magistrate, for the maintenance of
truth, justice, and peace among men? Three conditions in an Oath.


A. Yes: First, provided that we swear in truth, (the thing sworn, or vowed,
must be a known truth.) Secondly, in judgment. (as becomes a wise Christian.)
Thirdly, in righteousness. (not to the hurt of another.) Jer. 4.2. Exodus: 22.
10, 11.

Q. Is it not lawful to make a vow and promissory Oath, whereby we bind our
selves to God, to perform the thing that is gone out of our mouths?

A. Yes; it is with these two conditions: Of a vow.
First, that the thing vowed and promised be lawful to us, and within our
power and callings to perform. [Else we take Gods name in vain, if we bind our
selves to do that which is not in our Power, or not lawful for us in our
places to perform [And therefore to vow single life, absolute and blind
obedience to superiors, as Popish Priests do; or to vow any thing against our
duty, callings, former Vows and Oaths, they be all unlawful, and to be
broken.] Number. 30.3. Jer. 44.25. Psalm. 24 4.

Q. What second condition is required in a vow and solemn protestation?

A. Because all lawful Vows must be performed: therefore we should foresee
and consider, how meet, lawful, and profitable, the Oath will be before we
swear, that so we may safely perform our vows [Our promissory Oaths must be
with much caution and condition: It is a sin not to perform a lawful Vow.]
Josh. 9.14, 15. 1 Samuel 14.44. J^sh. 2.19. Genesis 24.5. Judge. 11.31. a rash vow.

Q. How is Gods name taken in vain without an oath?

A. First, by foolish, light, unreverent speaking of Gods a Will, Titles, and
Attributes; or of his b Word, and c works. [As in foolish admirations, O Lord,
O sweet Jesus, Lord have mercy upon us, I never saw the like! Secondly, When
gamesters thank God for their good luck. Thirdly, when men jest with
Scripture-phrases. Fourthly, when men speak reproachfully of Gods decrees. as
if I be predestined, I shall be saved; if not, I shall be damned, do what I
can, etc.] a Romans 9.19, 20. b Joh. 6.60. Jer. 23.34. Act. 17. 32. c Genesis 4.24.
Mar. 3.22, 29, 30. Esaias 36.20, Mic. 3.11. Zach. 11.5.

Q. How, secondly, without an oath?

A. When men have cursings and imprecations in their mouths. [As a pox, or a
plague on thee, the Devil take thee, etc. It is a sin to wish a curse to our
selves, or others; as, God damn me, would I were hanged, etc.] 1 Samuel 17.43. 2 Samuel: 16.7.

Q. How, thirdly?

A. When we apply the name Jesus, or any other name of God, or any sentence of
Scripture, to Charms, sorcery, or other supernatural uses. [As to drive away
Devils, to do cures, to sanctify creatures not sanctified by God; as to
baptize Bells, etc. this is a false application of Gods Word.] Act. 19.13.

Q. How, fourthly?

A. When men go about to imitate the miraculous, and extraordinary works of
Christ, and the Apostles. [As the Popish exorcisme; ex tempore, Prophesying of
men called and ungifted; laying on of hands to give the Holy Ghost; to make
empty signs, without effects following, etc. This is a misapplication of Gods
power, without promise or warrant; exposing of Religion to contempt, and a
taking of Gods name in vain.] Act. 19.13. Act. 8.18, 19. 1 Cor. 14.31, 32.

Q. How, fifthly, is Gods name taken in vain without an Oath?

A. When we perform any part of Gods worship carelessly and perfunctorily. As
when we pray without understanding and good sense, or for fashion and
ostentation; when we preach without preparation, and for civil complement, or
vaingloriously; when we receive the Sacrament, because it is the use at certain
times in the year, etc. Now is Gods name taken in vain by us, though we seem to
honor him.] Jer 48.10. 1 Cor. 14.11. See Eccl. 5.1, 2. Mal: 1.13. 2 Timothy 2.15.
Phil. 15.16. Luke 8.18.

Q. How, lastly, is Gods name taken in vain without an Oath?

A. When we put Gods Name, Cause, and Religion, upon our own worldly, carnal,
and base ends and enterprises. [When Religion is made a cloak to carry on, or
to cover any vile and unjust actions, then is Gods name taken in vain.] Jer.
7.9, 10, 11. Mic. 3.11. Mat. 23.14. 2 Samuel 4.8, 11. They put the name of God
upon their wicked murder, saying, the Lord has avenged thee of Saul: with 1 Samuel 26.8.

Q. Why must we be careful of this Law?

A. Because God holds all prophaners of his name, for most vile persons; who,
though they escape punishment amongst men, yet shall not escape Gods wrath.
[They are under the Law, in whomsoever any of these sins reign.] God will not
hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

CAP. XXXII.
Of the Sabbath day we consider, the 1. Institution, 2. Change, and 2.
Celebration of it.


Remember the Sabbath day.

Q. WHat is the purpose of God in this Commandment?

A. God will have every seventh day set apart, and observed to his honor and
worship, in the duties of Religion, and not spent to our pleasure or profit.
[It must be separate from. other days.] Eze. 22.26. Esaias 58.13, 14. The
Sabbath was instituted chiefly for the public worship of God. Exodus, 34.21.

1. Q. Is this Law of keeping one day of seven, for an holy ^est, still in
force?

A. Yes; it has been from the beginning, and shall continue to the end of the
world; The Morality of the Sabbath.
and it is not in the power of man to alter this proportion of time. [as to
make the day of rest to be sooner or later, as on every fifth, or on every eight
day.] Genesis 2.2, 3. Hell. 4.3, 4. Exodus 16.22, 25. Mat. 5.18. [God created seven
days, and no more, and God rested from the beginning.]

2. Q. Touching the change of the day. The observation of the Lords day for the
Sabbath: Is it from Heaven, or of men?

A. It is of God, who changed the day, though not the number of the day, to the
first of the week, called the Lords day. Act. 20.6, 7. 1 Cor. 16.2. Rev. 1.10.
Joh: 20.19, 26. [This is a rule; look what has been continued down to us by
the uninterrupted practice of the Churches in all ages from the Apostles times,
and the first link of that chain, that is, the example, practice, ground,
reason, and analogy thereof is found in Scripture: that is, to be acknowledged
of divine authority, and not merely of man: Now such is this of the Lords day,
and baptizing of Infants; the Commandment limits out the quotient, and God by
particular designation has pointed out the day, from which none but God can
again alter it.]

3. For the celebration of the Lords day, two sorts of duties are required of a
Christian: Some Before the day come. When the day is come.


Q. What is required of us before the day come?

A. We must remember it, that is, we must be mindful of it before hand; so to
contrive and order our affairs and affections, that they may not hinder us in
the Lords work, on the Lords day. Ex. 16.5, 23.

Q. What follows hereof?

A. Therefore it is a sin, first, to reserve some od choares, or journies, or
merry meetings, to that day: secondly, to encumber our selves with more
business then we can conveniently dispatch in six days. [As to take in more
work, more writing, more Merchandise, etc. In this kind, Brewers, Tailers,
Millers, Treaders of Wine-fats, and men of other occupations do greatly
offend, as many as do not order their business to end with the week; that so
their calling may stand still, and their hearts be fitted to meet God in his
Ordinances.]

Q. When the day is come, What is our duty?

A. It is twofold: First, we must rest from all businesses of our callings, in
heart, in act, and in tongue, both we and ours. [The law is spiritual, and
binds the inward man.] Neh. 13.15, 16, 17. Exo. 34 21. Exodus 31.15, 16. Jer.
17.24.

Q. What, secondly?

A. This rest must be an holy and sanctified rest; it must not be a brutish
rest. [There is a difference between the rest of an Ox, and of his Master.]
Esa. 58.13.

Q. What duties are required to an holy rest?

A. Four: First, we must prepare our selves for a public worship in the
morning, by examination of our wants and ways, and by Prayer, both by our
selves alone, and with our families, for Gods blessing on the ordinances, for
the edification of our selves and others. [They that come without praying, go
away usually without a blessing] Exodus: 19.10.

Q. What second duty is required?

timely, reverently, and with our company, if we have any. Act: 15.21. Luk: 4
16. Ezekiel: 46.10. Act. 10.33. Psalm: 42.4. Heb. 10.25.

Q. What thirdly?

A. I must religiously join with the Congregation in the duties there
performed; as in a Prayer, b praising and singing, c attending to the Word read
or Preached, and d participation of the Sacrament. Eccl. 5.1. 1 Cor. 14.26, 27.
a Act. 16.13. Mat: 81.19. 2 Chronicles: 5.13. Col: 3.16. c Act: 13.15, 16. Luke
4.20. d 1 Cor. 11.21. Act: 2.42. Act: 20.7. [It is a fault in the congregation
to divert our selves from the exercise in hand, to private reading, or talking,
or gazing about; we must make one in every exercise of Gods worship.

Q. What fourth duty is required to the sanctifying of a Sabbath?

Assembly is dismissed, I must spend the other time in meditation, and reading
of Gods word, in prayer, and conference of that we have heard, to the
edification of our selves and families. Act. 17.11, 12. 1 Cor. 14.35. Genesis
18.19. [These be the duties of the day.]

Q. Is all work simply unlawful to be done on the Sabbath day?

Three sorts of works lawful on the Sabbath day.
A. No; works of mercy to a man or beast; b works about the worship of God,
and works of true necessity, may be done. [God will have mercy rather then
sacrifice: It is therefore lawful to ring bells to call the people together; to
travel to a Sermon, to dress our Meat, to Milk our Kine, to set watch and
ward, and such things as belong to the meet comfort of man's life: man is not
made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man.] a Luke 13.11, 15. Luke 14.1, 5.
Exodus 12.16. 1 King. 8.65. Mat. 12. 1, 7, 11. b Mat. 12.5. Neh. 13.19 Joh.
7.23. 2 King. 4.23.

Q. Why must we be careful of this Law?

A. Because if we make conscience of the Sabbath day, we shall be blessed in
our souls, and in the labors of the week days. [Tis a blessed day; the day
is not capable of blessing, or a curse, in it self, but to the observers of
it, it is a day of blessing.] Esaias 56.4, 6. Neh. 13.18. Jer. 17.24, 25.

CAP. XXXIII.
Of the fifth Commandment. Honor thy Father and Mother, etc.

THis Cemmandement shows our duty, as we stand in relation one to another; as
the duty of Children, Servants, Wives, Subjects; and the reciprocal duties or
Kings, Husbands, Masters, Parents. Ephesians. 6.2, 4, 9.

Q. Who are meant hereby Father and Mother?

A. Not only our natural Parents, but all such as God has linked to us, and
set over us, in office and authority, or other preheminency above us, Esaias.
49.23. Job. 29.19. 2 King: 5.13.

Q. What is meant by honoring of them?

A. It is to render unto every one his dues, that is, such respect as is due to
his place, calling, or other dignity and pre-eminence which God has bestowed
on him, and will have to be acknowledged in him. Romans 13.7. 1 Pet. 2.13. 1 Pet.

THE duties of Husband and Wife: some be common to them both; some peculiar to
the Man or Woman alone.

Q. What be the duties of Man and Wife, common to them both?

A. Five: First, for our choice; we must marry in the Lord, that is, with such
as join with us in the faith and worship of the same true God. 1 Cor: 7.39. 1
King. 11.2, 4, 7, 11. 2 Chronicles. 21.6. Genesis 24.3, 6. 2 Cor. 6. 14, 15.16. Mal.
2.11.



A. To pity and do good each to the soul of other; to bring one another from
error and darkness, to be heirs of the grace of life. 1 Cor. 7.16. 1 Pet.
3.7.

Q. What, thirdly?

A. Mutual helping each of other in counsels, care, and bearing the burden of
the family; especially they must, as yoke-fellowes, join together in setting up
Religion in the family. [They must draw in one yoke, and one way, in all good
things: the burden must not be cast on one, through the sloth, niceness,
voluptuousness and pride of the other.] Gen: 2.20, 24. 1 Samuel 25.17, 24, 25.

Q. What, fourthly?

love and loyalty, whereby they must love and delight one in another above all
others, b bearing one another burdens and infirmities. [As sickness,
silliness, poverty frowardness; and not by rigorous, churlish and hardening
ways to vex one another.] a Heb: 13.4. Gen: 20.16. 1 Cor: 7.12, 13. Ephesians. 5.28,

Q. What is the duty more peculiar to the Wife?

A. She must be a sober minded in all things, discreet, b keep at home, c
obedient to her Husband, and of a gentle and meek spirit. It is a false
commendation of women to be of a great spirit, to take upon them over their
Husbands, to ruffle it, and bring him under; leave that for Zipporah and
Vasthi. Exodus: 4. 25, 26. Hest. 1.12, 17.] a Tit. 2.4, 5. b Prove. 7.11. 1 Timothy
5.13. c 1 Timothy 2.12. Genesis 3.6. Col. 3.18. d Prove. 31.26. 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. A
cheerful, courteous, modest, mild spirit becomes a Christian Woman; a Christan
Wife must not be sullen, nor taunting, not bitter, nor captious and
untractable, nor domineering, nor vain, in false adornings of hair, naked
breasts, costly attire, and such like shows and witnesses of an ungoverned and
unsanctified heart.]

Q. What is the duty more peculiar to the Husband?

A. To dwell with the Wife according to knowledge, giving honor to her, as to
the weaker vessel, that is, not overbearing any thing contrary to her credit,
place, and comforts; but fitting employments, according to her abilities;
making up in love and wisdom, what is defective in her weakness. 1 Pet. 3.7.
[What beautiful Christians should we be, if we were careful to perform and
show the power of Religion, in discharge of the duties that belong to us in our
several relations; he is an hypocrite that is forward in common duties of
Christianity, and is not alike careful of the particular duties belonging to
his relation and calling.]

There be other relations of men who ought to give honor one to another; as
Pastors and People, young and aged, rich and poor, etc.

Q. If I live under a Pastor or Minister of Gods Word, What is my duty to him?

A. The Peoples duty to their Ministers is threefold, First, to a esteem them
very highly in love, for their works sake. provide them liberal and
honorable maintenance, to uphold the dignity of their callings. a 1 These.
5.12, 13.2 King. 4.10. Gal. 4.13.14. Jer. 38.4, 9. b 1 Cor. 96, 10, 13, 14. 1 Timothy 5.17. That double honor is spoken of their maintenance; it is a sin to
make him a poor despicable man. Gal. 6.6. in all good things.

Q. What is the third duty of people to Ministers?

A. To suffer themselves to be guided and amended by their wholesome and
faithful doctrines. Heb. 13.17. 2 Timothy 4.15. [These are not duties of curtesy
and good nature, but of conscience before God, who will require a strict
account of all the derision, slanders, hard usage, and up-risings against their
Ministers persons, calling, doctrines, and godly admonitions, as if it were a
glory to keep them under, or to carry on a foolish disorder against them, etc.

Cor. 4 11, 12, 13. Jer. 26.15.

Q. What is the Ministers duty to the flock?

A. before them in a (a) blameless conversation. (b) feed them with wholesome
doctrine, (a) plainly, diligently (b) and faithfully, separating between sheep
and goats; between precious and vile; having (e) compassion on the ignorant,
and them that be out of the way. (a) 1 Timothy 4.12. Tit. 1.6. Levit. 21.4, 21.
(b) Tit. 1.9. 2 Timothy 3.16. Jer. 23.28. (c) 2 Cor. 4.2. 2 Timothy 2.2, 25. 2 Cor.

Q. There be whom God has made eminent above us in gifts of mind, birth, age,
or estate; and we must honor whom God has honored: What is our duty to such?

be found in the way of righteousness. Lev. 19.32. Prove. 16.31. Esaias 3.5. Dan.
2.48. 1 Timothy 5.1.

Q. And what is their duty back again to Inferiors?

A. They must not disdain, nor despise others that be below themselves in
gifts or estate, but rather to be beneficial to them, by their countenance,
good example, and best use of their gifts. Jam. 2.2. Job. 29.15, 16, 17. Luke
8.3. 1 Timothy 6.17. Tit. 2.2. [All tallents are given for use; as the eye
recieves not sight for it self, nor the stomach meat for it self, but for the
body.]

Q. Because all men are to be honored, and we must not do any thing whereby
our brother is set at naught: Tell me how equals ought to behave themselves one
toward another? [As fellow servants, fellow-Ministers, fellow-Citizens.]

A. They must be courteous one to another, and respectfull, giving honor one to
another, not provoking, envying, or disgracing one another. 1 Pet. 2, 17. Romans
12.10. Mat. 23.6. Gal. 5.26.

Q. Why must we be careful of this Law?

A. Because God has annexed outward blessings to the conscionable performance
of the duties herein contained, namely, long life, and wel-being. [It shall be
well with thee, and thou shall live long.] We must take all outward promises
with this condition, viz: so far as they shall be expedient for the health of
our souls, and not to the hurt of them; Gods children have long life, health,
etc. or the blessing of them.]

Racha. Genesis 4.5. Mat. 27.39. Psalm. 22.13. Genesis 21.9. 2 Samuel 13.15. [All
disdainful and scornful carriages; as the fleering of the countenance, laying
out of the tongue, grinding of the teeth, biting the nails, shaking the head,
stamping with the foot at one, or any other gesture and carriage, whereby thy
brother is set at naught, is a sin against this commandment; this is to say,
Rache.]

Q. How secondly?

speeches; as a railing, b scoffing, c brawling and chiding, d accusing,
upbraiding e and threatening, etc. These show the venom and rancor of the
heart, and are the murder of the tongue; this is to say, Thou fool.] a Psalm.
59, 7. 2 Samuel 16.8. b Mat. 27.40, 43. 2 King. 2.23. c Ephesians. 4.31. Tit. 3.2. d

others. a 1 Samuel 31.4. 2 Samuel 17.23. Mat. 27.5. b Genesis 4.8. c 2 Samuel 12.9. 1

35.31, 33.] Judge. 9.24.

Q. How else do men become guilty of murder in the sight of God?

neglect the means of life and health; or else by b surfeiting and drunkenness
impair our own or another health; or c else do desperately cast our selves
and others into dangers, and sins, which are punishable by death. a 1 Timothy
5.23. b Romans 13.13. Hab. 2.15. c 2 Samuel 23.15, 17. Joh. 11.8, 9. d 1 King: 2.23.

31.29. c Exodus 2.13. Jer. 26.24. a Luke 10.37.

Q. As there is a life, so there is a murdering of the soul, as well as of
the body and he is a Murderer that kills his own soul, or the soul of
another. Act. 20.26. What does God require of us in this regard?

A. That we should not a plunge our selves, or others, into sin and heresy, by
rejecting or corrupting the food of souls, Gods Word, nor by any other
seducement whatsoever; but b rather to bring our selves, and others, to a love
of the truth, and laboring after the bread of life. a Ezekiel. 33.8, 9. Ezekiel.
34.4. 2 Cor. 7.2. 2 Pet. 3.16. Tit. 3.11. b Jam. 5.20. Ioh. 4.10, 14, 26. Jude

Q. How secondly?

adultery of the tongue: Here then is condemned the reading and singing of
lascivious books and poems, use of lascivious pictures, etc. The memory must
not be loaded, nor the tongue exercised, with such vain, loose, broad speeches.
He that would be free from adultery, must make conscience of wanton words and

others, or plotting their damage. Psalm. 73.3, 21, 22. Deuteronomy. 22.1.

dishonesty: [He covets and desires more then he dares to pray for: that is a
Covetous person.] Ezekiel. 33.31. Eccles. 4.8. Prove. 28.20. Ephesians. 5.5.

Q. Thus of things forbidden. What does the Lord require of us in this
Commandment?

discredit. credit. Esaias 63.8. Col: 3.9, 10. Rev: 22.15. Joh: 8.44.

Q. But is a jesting lie, and lying for the profit of another unlawful?

A. It is; no occasion or pretense can make a lie to be lawful. Job 13.7, 8.
Rom: 3.7, 8. Gen: 20.9, 12, 16. 1 King: 13.18. Hos: 7.3.

Q. Show some other particulars wherein we sin against this Commandment?

A. The grossest and most harmfull kind of lying is in judgment, and bearing
of witness, when either the Judge, Witness, or Pleader, shall deny, conceal,
pervert, and dissemble the truth, or countenance the wrong [It's a sin to
shrink from the truth, when Religion, Justice, or Charity, do call for the
maintaining of it. Jer 9.3.] Deuteronomy: 19 18. Mic: 7.3. 2 Timothy: 4.16. Prove: 24 11,
12.

Q. How secondly, is this Law broken?

A. By backbiting, slandering, harsh and unjust censures of others; or any way
raising or taking up an evil report against our brother. Psalm: 15.3. Exodus:
23.1. 2. Sam: 16.2, 3. Neh: 6.6. Levit: 19.16. Mat: 7.1. Mar: 3, 22, 30. 2 Samuel:
16.3.

Q. How, thirdly, do we sin against this Commandment?

A. By dissimulation, and equivocation; that is, when we are made to believe
one thing, and another is intended; or when men's words do bear a double
sense. [So that there is one proposition reserved in the mind of the
equivocator, which crosses that which is uttered by the tongue: it is a sin
to dissemble and equivocate.] Ier. 8.9. Psalm. 12.2. Psalm. 15.3. Mat. 26.72.

fourthly, do we sin against this Commandment?

A. When we speak the truth in malice, that is, with an intent and desire to
hurt and disgrace another. [As Doeg did.] 1 Samuel 22.10. with Psalm. 52.2, 3.4.

Q. Out of the heart proceeds false witness. Mat. 15.19. How do men offend in
heart against this Commandment?

Inwardly.
A. Two ways: First, by evil surmisings, and ungrounded suspicions, a
thinking hardly of others without a cause. [That is, upon some b weak matter,
or weak (c) evidence; as upon hearsay, jealousy, uncharitable collections,
etc. all which proceed from want of love.] b Mat. 9.3, 4. Ioh. 7.24. Ioh. 9.16.
b Romans 14.3. 1 Timothy 6.4. c 2 Samuel 10.3. 1 Samuel 22. 8, 10. 2 Samuel 16.4. 1 Samuel
24.9.

Q. How, secondly?

A. When we can rejoice in the disgraces of another, being glad to hear him
evil spoken of; or else to be grieved for their good esteem. [This also
proceeds from want of love.] Mat. 21.15. 3 Ioh. v. 10, 12. 1 Samuel 18.7, 8.

Q. These be things forbidden: What does the Lord require of us in regard of
our brother?

A. First, Duties required.
that we speak the truth in love no more, nor no less then the truth. [Without
wrenchings, fetches, doublings; without flattery or detraction.] Ephesians. 15. Psalm.
12.2.

Q. What, secondly?

A. To defend a our brothers good name, as far as may stand with good
conscience; and if we have b wronged it, to repair the same. [ Recanting that
which has been falsely said; explaining that which has been doubtfully said,
and praising or justifying them in that wherein they have been unjustly
condemned] a 1 Samuel 19.4. Ier. 26.9, 16. Prove. 25.23. Prove. 24.11, 12. b 1 Samuel
24.17. 2 Samuel 19.19, 20.

means must I defend my brothers good name?

A. We must a construe things in the best sense; and when they cannot be
altogether excused, yet we must b acknowledge other good things to be in them.
[That their honesty be not quite trodden under foot, etc.] a 1 Cor. 13.7. 1
Pet. 4.8. b 2 Chr. 19.3.

Q. How do men sin against their own good names?

A. Two ways: First, when we speak more or less of our selves then is true,
making our selves better or worse then we are, dissembling the good or evil
that is in us. [When men lessen faults, or greaten their virtues; or on the
contrary, do augment their sins and unworthiness, and debase Gods goodness
in any kind toward them, or in them, that is a false testimony of our selves;
boasting or bragging and selfe-condemning, they be both of them evil.] Gal.
2.13. Exodus 4.10. 1 Samuel: 21.14, 15. Prove. 13.7. Prove. 27.2. Prove. 20.6. Acts.
12.22.

Q: How, secondly, do we wrong our own good names?

A. When we deserve a an evil report, or else (b) suffer an evil report to
rest upon us unjustly. [Both these do wound a good name.] a Ge. 34.30. 1 Sa.
2.24. Phi. 4.8. b Act. 24.12. Mar: 3.23, 24. Job 27.5.

Q. By what means may a Christian preserve and defend his own good name against
slanders and false accusations?

A. There be two ways: clear himself of the slander before men by a modest
and dispassionate conviction of the defamer. mouths by an holy and blameless
conversation. a 2 Samuel 19.26, 27. 2 Cor. 11.5, 12. b 1 Pet. 2.12, 15. Tit.
1.11, 13.

CAP. XL.
Tenth Commandment. Thou shall not Covet, etc.

HEre God takes order with the first motions and inclinations to evil, The
scope.
though they never come to the consent of the will, and purpose of the heart.

Q. Thou shall not covet: What is here forbidden?

A. The first motions unto sin, the lusting of the old man, though we never
purpose nor consent unto them. [All evil inclinations and motions of the heart
before consent, as vain thoughts, sudden passions and affections, and all
lusting of the old man against the will of God. [So Paul expounds this
Commandment. Romans 7.7, 23. Jam. 1.14. Gal. 5.17.

Q. What is the particular coveting here forbidden?

A. Discontentednesse with that we have, wishing and longing after that which
is another. [As when we be not content with that place and condition which we
hold in the Family, Church, or Commonwealth; but the heart is still rising,
wishing, woulding after the condition of another; as would I were a Master, or
a Minister, or a Tradesman, rather then a Minister, etc. This unquietness of
the spirit, this sickness of the desire, repining, rising, and saying within
our selves, O how well could I live, if I had such a field, such a Wife, such a
Servant, etc. these motions be contrary to that complete contentment which is
here requirey.] Under this particular concupiscence of the heart, coveting that
which is another, all evil motions and desirings of the like kind are
forbidden; namely, all lustings against the Law of the mind; all the rising,
enmity and Rebellion that is in our nature against the things of the Spirit;
the sudden passions and perturbations of the mind; also the rolling of vain
thoughts in the mind, as thoughts of pride, revenge, the moving of the heart
toward any evil object, though without any settled approbation of the same.
But tell me:

Q. Are these thoughts and motions sinful, if we do not consent unto them,
nor purpose to put them in practice?

A. Yes, they are: The very risings of corruptions within us, are sins to be
repented of: [They are as the scum and boiling, of the pot, the rising of the
mud, etc. A lame horse, if he move, he will halt in going: An instrument out of
tune will jarre in the sounding, and that is a fault; there is something
wanting that should be unto perfection; so in our very natures, there is a
jarring and a swerving from the Law of God, and that uprightness, wherein God
created man; and these swervings are the fruits of sin; and the causes of
sin in us, as Jam. 1.14, 15.] Romans 7.21, 23, 24. Genesis 8.21. Ephesians. 4.22.

Q. What say you then of evil suggestions and thoughts that arise in our
minds, as thoughts of Blasphemy, etc. are they sins?

A. If they be cast in by Satan, Of Satanicall injections.
and not yielded unto by us, they be Satan's sins, and not ours: [To be tempted
is no sin, for Christ was tempted, and had evil thoughts cast into his mind by
Satan; but to yield to the temptation, that is our sin.] Mat. 4.6. Mat. 16.23.

Q. How may it be discerned whether the evil motions do arise from our own
corrupt hearts or from Satan?

A. Two ways: 1. If the motion or temptation he unnatural, (that is) if
thoughts arise which tend to the destruction of our natural well-being, or of
our spiritual and eternal well-being, it is then from Satan, and if we
consent not to such thoughts, they are not our sins but Satan's: Perhaps thou
have thoughts to curse God, to wish there were no God, thoughts perhaps of
despair, or to kill ones self or others, etc. these be Satanicall injections;
for nature loves it self, and so does grace our new and spiritual nature,
and therefore if we resist and dislike such motions, they be not sin to us.
Matthew. 4.9. Matthew. 16.23. 1. John 4.3. Mat. 3.28.

Q. How else may that be known?

A. By the manner of their coming, if they seize upon us with terror and
affrightment, suddenly and unexpectedly, so that the soul is burdened and
groaneth under them, willing to be rid of them, it is a sign they come from
Satan; [And such thoughts and tentations are our trials and afflictions, but
not our sins; evil thoughts which agree to nature and to our dispositions,
(as that of David's numbering the people, and Judas selling his Master,) though
Satan cast them into our minds, and stir us up thereunto, yet they are our
sins as well as Satan's.] Matthew. 4.10. Christ had indignation against that
motion.

Q. What does this Law forbidding all concupiscence, inform us of?

A. Two things: First, it shows the infinite purity of Gods Law which requires
a conformity to his will, not only in our wills, affections and actions, but in
the very frame and temper of the soul: [That no evil motions arise against
God.]

Q. What, secondly?

A. It shows the impurity of our nature, which is so great, that for it alone,
(though we never harbored an evil thought) the Lord might justly abhor us
for ever: [And therefore these inward workings of corruption, the untowardnesse
and contrariety of our natures against God, are to be bewailed and crucified,
if we desire to be sound in repentance. Job. 15.15, 16, Ephesians. 2.3. Psalm. 51.5.
Ier. 17.9. Ephesians. 4.22. Romans 6.6. Romans 7.21, 24.

Q. Is every soul bound to make conscience of the Law, in forbearing the sins
forbidden, and doing the duties commanded?

A. Yes: To his power he must keep it all, else he is under the Law, and not
under Christ. [And consequently must perish for ever.] Romans 6.14. Romans 2.25.
Gal. 5.24.

Q. Are there, besides this Law of God, other Laws and precepts of the Church
to be observed of Christians for conscience sake: [As to observe Saints days,
keep fasting days, make confession to the Priest at certain times in the
year of all our sins, hear Mass upon holy days. Canisius Cat.]

A. No there is nothing to be added to the written Word of God, it being in it
self most holy, perfect, and sufficient to make men wise to salvation, Deuteronomy. 4.
2. Rev. 22.18. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. [Man has no power to make Laws to the
conscience; civil constitutions they may make for outward orders sake; which
we are to observe, if they be agreeable to the Word of God, not otherwise.

Q. Are there Evangelicall counsels of perfection, distinct from precepts,
which if we keep voluntarily, do help forward our salvation, and increase our
glory? [As that of poverty, single life, blind obedience to superiors?
Canitious Cat.]

A. No, the Lord has left us a liberty in some things, but our choice therein
is no part of perfection, and other things named for counsels, are not left to
our curtesy, but are duties to be performed as occasion requires. [The only
service and sacrifice which God accepts, is, obedience to his will in his
Word, and God refuses whatsoever a man takes in hand besides.]

Q. Well then, there is but one Law under which we stand, and the end of that
Law is, as has been said, to drive us unto Christ. Tell me what must we go to
Christ for?

A. For three things. mercy, to forgive our sins. strength and victory over
our sins. acceptance of our will for the deed. [For the Law justifies no
transgressor, the Law gives no grace to keep it self, the Law accepts nothing
but complete obedience.] a Romans 10.4. b Joh. 1.16. 2 Cor. 3.6. Gal. 3.2. c Ephesians.
1.6. Heb. 13.15. 1 Pet. 2.5.

Q Our faith is unperfect and so is our obedience, what is our duty in regard
of the imperfection of both?

A. We must strive to increase and grow in grace by a diligent and constant use
of all those means which God has set apart and sanctified to that end. [If we
have a dimnesse in the eyes, or a lamenesse, we will try twenty ways to help
it, so, etc. and to this end, only the ways of God are available, and must be
used in their place, one ordinance helps another.] 2 Pet. 2.18. Heb. 6.11, 12.
Luke 17.5. 1 These. 4.1, 10. Prove. 1.24. Job 17.9. He that has clean hands,
shall be stronger and stronger.

CAP. XLI.
Of the means of Working and increasing faith and 1. of Hearing the word of
God.

THere is a threefold use and benefit of the means of grace, viz. 1. To work
faith and conversion. 2. To increase graces begun. 3. To seal up the
assurance of all to our hearts.

Q What be those means which God has sanctified and set apart for the begeting
and increasing of his saving graces in us?

A. Three: First, the exercise of the a word Read and Preached. Secondly,
prayer b public and private. Thirdly, and the use c of the Sacraments. a Romans
10.13.14. Act. 8.31, 35. Act. 13.15.27. Act. 15.21. b Luke 11.9, 13. John
16.23. Act. 16.13. c Luke 7.30. 1 Cor. 10.16, 1 Cor. 11.17. Mat. 3.6.7. Mark
1.4.

1. Of hearing the word of God.

Q. How may I hear the word of God to my comfort and salvation?

A. Some things are required, 1. Before we come to Hear. 2. Some things in
Hearing. 3. And some things after we have Heard.

Q. What is required before we come?

A. Before I come, I must set my heart and mind in frame by due preparation.
Exodus 19.10, 11. 1 Samuel 6.20. Acts 10.33. Luc. 8.18.

Q. Wherein Stands this preparation to right hearing, Of preparation before
Hearing.
or reading the word of God?

A. In three things: emptied of all stumbling blocks of iniquity, I must
receave it in an honest heart, (that is) with a teachable and tractable heart,
resolving to practice whatsoever is taught me out of Gods word [I must not set
up any imaginations, reasonings, or purposes, which may make me to be offended,
and stumble at the Word, being disobedient: but I must submit every opposite
desire to the obedience of Jesus Christ.] Ezekiel. 14.7. Ezekiel. 33.32. Mat. 19.22.
Ioh. 5.44. Ier. 4.3. Act. 10.33. Luke 8.15. Rom: 6.17. Iam. 1.21. 1 Pet. 2.1,
2, 8. Lord here I am before thee as they clay, fashion me to thine own mind
and will.

Q. Wherein, secondy, stands right preparation?

A. We must not come heavily, and for forms sake, but with an hungring and
thirsting after the good knowledge of God, desirous to grow by it in grace and
goodness. Esa. 2.3. Luke 1.53. 1 Pet. 2.2. Job. 23.12. Psalm 19.10, 11.

Q. Wherein, thirdly, stands this preparation?

A. We must pray for the Spirit, and blessing of God, to accompany the outward
Ordinances, without which they are uneffectuall. [Many men know these
directions: but did thou ever put them in practice? Did ever set thy self
by hearing to get wisdom, and be healed?] Prove. 20.12. Luke 24, 45. Esa.
48.17. Psalm. 119.18.

Q. 2. In hearing, What must we do?

A. The Word must be heard with reverence, and attention, and mingled with
faith, that is, I must believe that it is true, and true to me. [As if I hear
a promise, or a duty, or a mark of grace, I must take it to my self, as true
and good to me.] Heb: 4, 2.3. Luke 4.20. Act. 13.46.

Q. What help have you thus to prepare and dispose your heart?

A. I must consider, that it is not the will a and word of man, but of God, by
which also I shall be judged; and therefore if I b resist it, I stand not out
against man, but against God. [Untill I give Gods Word a divine authority over
my heart, I am but an hypocrite, I can never believe, etc.] a 1 These. 1.4, 5.
with 1 These. 2.13 b Zach. 7.12. Act. 7.51. 2 Chr. 34.19, 21. Ezra 9.4. [This
consideration would free the heart of impatiency, and contempt of the Preacher,
of pride of our own hearts, and other carnal affections, which make the Word
unfruitful unto us.

Q 3. What must me do after we have heard?

A. Two things: First, we must meditate and confer of it, and examine it, (as
the Bereans did) that so the rules of Gods Word may be rooted in our
understanding, memories and affections. Acts 17.11, 12. Luke 2.51. 1 Cor: 14.35.

Q. What secondly?

A. We must be careful to turn hearing into practice, for not the hearer, but
the doer of the word is blessed. Matthew: 7.24, 26. Jam. 1.22, 23.25. Psalm:
119.105. Prove. 9.21, 22. Luke 11.28.

CAP. XLII.
Of Prayer, which is the second means of Grace:

PRayer is an excellent means to obtain all good things spiritual and
temporal at Gods hands, Iam. 1.5. Luke 18.1, 2.

Q. What is Prayer?

What it is.
A. Prayer is a wrestling with God or a making known of our requests to God
with supplications for good things according to his will, and giving him the
praise of all the good we have. Gen: 32.24. Hos: 12.4. Phil: 4.6. Neh: 1.8.
There be many things required to the making of an acceptable prayer, to a right
manner of calling upon God, which shall be set down as follows.

To whom must we make our prayers?

A. Only to God in the name and mediation of Jesus Christ, Christ bids us pray
to our Father in heaven. Col. 3.17. Ephesians. 3.12, 14. 1 Timothy 2.5. Rev. 8.3.

Q. What is it to pray in the name of Jesus Christ?

A. It is not only to say those words, [through Jesus Christ our Lord Amen;] 2.
Through whom.
but it is by faith to plead the grace of the Covenant made with us in Christ:
[to make him the great Master of Requests in Heaven; it is an interposing and
pleading of Christ's merts with the Father, to speed our desires.] Acts 4.29,
30. John 16.23. Heb: 3.15.

Q. Why must we call upon God alone, and not upon any creature, either Angels,
or Saints departed?

A. Because God alone searches all hearts, knows all griefs, hears all
prayers, and is alone able to satisfy our desires, and supply our wants. [To
pray to one does suppose in him these two things: 1 Omniscience (that is)
knowledge of all hearts, of all our wants, desires and groanings. 2.
Omnipotence (that is) power in his own hands to help, Catechismus. Rom part 3.
c. 6.
and these are peculiar to God alone] Psalm. 65.2. 1 Kings 8.39. with 1 Kings
18.26. Acts 1.24. Esaias 63.16. Psalm. 50.15.

Q For what things must we pray?

A. Such things as stand with God Will, and promise to grant: [Look what God
promises us, 3. For what.
and in what manne^ he promises any thing, the same things and in such manner
must we beg them i^ prayer: some things God has promise^ absolutely, and some
things with reservatio^ to his Fatherly wisdom, as the things themselves, or
the want of them, or the contrary to them, shall make most for the praise of
his grace, and for final and spiritual good.] 1 John 5.14. Romans 8.27.

Q. For whom must we pray?

A. For a all men, the dead b only exempted, 4. For whom.
and such as have sinned against the Holy Ghost. a 1 Timothy 2.1. 1 Samuel 15.35
Ier. 28.6 Romans 10.1. b Eccl. 9.6. Luk^ 16 26. c 1 John 5.16. [The state of the
dead is unalterable; besides, we have no example, precept, or promise of prayer
made for the dead.]

Q. In what manner must we pray unto God for these things?

A. To a right manner of praying three things are required. 5. In what manner.
1. It must proceed from the heart renewed by the Spirit, and assisted by the
Holy Ghost in the very act of prayer, Ephesians. 6.18. Jude v. 20. Gal. 4.6. with
Romans 8.15, 26. 1. In the Spirit.
[ Spiritual prayer is not only opposed unto lip-prayer, as when the tongue is
exercised without the heart and affection, but also unto heartiest prayers of
unregenerate persons; a natural man cannot pray though he cry from the heart as
they did, Ion. 1.5. Hos. 7.14. Psalm. 78.34, 36. He must be a spiritual man that
can pray aright, and also he must be assisted in prayer by Gods Spirit, else he
will make unmeet requests and loose his prayers. Iam. 5.15, 16.

Q. How shall I know when I pray in the Holy Ghost?

A. By three things: 3 things in spiritual prayer.
sense and apprehension of spiritual wants and evils which destroy the work of
grace, and hinder Christ's Kingdom in us, do chiefly stir us up to prayer:
[That is, prayer in the Holy Ghost, there is a natural, and there is a
spiritual good and evil.] Psalm. 4.6, 7

Q. How, secondly, may it be known?

A. By the kind of our importunity: the desire is not filled, nor the heart at
rest, unless God answer us with spiritual favors and mercies, no not
although all outward good things be granted. [The natural man regards but
little Gods w^^l, or his good will; he is at rest with natural good things,
natural good things fill a natural desire. etc.] Exodus: 33.1.2, 15, 17 with
Exodus: 34.9, Psalm: 105.4.

Q. How thirdly?

A. In spiritual prayer, not only the wit, tongue and memory, and such like
good parts of nature are exercised, but the graces of the spirit, as humility,
hope, repentance, faith, etc. [This is prayer in the Spirit,] Psalm: 66.18. Job:
16.13, 14, 17. Job: 22.27, 28. 2 Chronicles: ^0.6, 7, 10, 12. Ezra 9.6. Psalm. 85.^5,
8. Neh. 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 11.

Q. What second thing is required to a right manner of praying?

A. We must pray with feeling of our wants and earnestness to obtain. [Sense
of our wants and misery begets fervency We cannot be earnest for things which
we find no need of, 2. With fervency.
or think to be due to us.] Jo^, 3.8. Rom: 8.26. Heb: 5.7. Iam: 5.16. Ier 29
13. Dan: 9.3.8, 18. Luke 18.1, 5.

Q. What third thing is required to a right manner of praying?

A. We must pray in faith (that is) in full assurance that the thing we ask is
according to gods will, 3. In Faith.
and that we shall obtain our requests so far forth as is expedient and best
for us. [We must not doubt of the things we ask, whether we may pray for them
or not; nor yet of Gods hearing and answering us therein, we pray for many
things conditionally, but not doubtfully, etc.] Iam: 1.6, 7. John 5.15. 2 Cor:
12.9.

Q. What ground of assurance have we that we shall be heard?

A. Gods promise of giving such and such things, and of hearing us when we beg
them in and through Christ's mediation. [there is a twofold promise: first, God
promises to give us his spirit, to give an heart of flesh, to give strength
against temptations and troubles, etc. Secondly, and he has bid us call upon
him for the same with promise to hear and answer us: and this is the ground of
our confidence.] Luke 11.9, 13. Psalm. 50.51. Heb. 4.15, 16.

CAP. XLIII.
Of the parts of Prayer, and of the Lords Prayer.

Q. WHat be the parts of Prayer?

A. Three: First, a particular confession and aggravation of our sins and
misery before God, 1. Confession, or d^prication.
with grief and shame of heart, and with a purpose to leave them. Luke 18.13.
Psalm. 51.3, 4, 5. Prove. ^8.13. Ez. 9.6, 14. 1 John 1.9. Psalm. 32.5. Luke 15.21.
1 Timothy 21.


Q What be the other two parts of Prayer?

A. 2. Petition a and supplication for good things to our selves or others, 2.
Petition, and Intercession. 3. Thanksgiving.
and 3. Thanksgiving, wherein b we give God the glory of his own
excellencies, and of all the good done to us. a 1 Timothy 2.1. Acts 12.5 Luke
23.42. b Hab. 1.12, 13. Number 14.17 Mic. 7.18. Rev. 5.13. 1 Chronicles. 29.11.14.
Psalm. 103.1, 2.

Q. Do all Gods Children call upon their Father in Heaven?

A. Yes, as the Child will Crave, and make his moan to his Parents, so the
Children of God be of a spiritual craving disposition, whereby the soul
hangethup on God to receive good things from him [ Prayerlesse people be dead
and graceless people.] Gal. 4.6. Zach. 12.10. Psalm. 79.6. Job 27.10.

Q. When, and how often must we pray?

A. We must pray continually (that is) constantly Morning and Evening, and also
upon special occasions. These. 5.17. Luke 18.1. 1 At set times, Acts 3.1. Acts
10 2, 9. Acts 16.13, 16. Ps. 92.1, 2. And it is a good thing so to do: Psalm.
55.17. with Dan. 6.10. special occasions, Dan. 9.2 Acts 12.5. Luke 6.12, 13.

Q But does the Spirit of God come at, and keep set hours of prayer? Can
prayer at set times, be prayer in the spirit?

A. Yes, for the spirit of Grace is continually abiding in us, and with us, and
therefore the spirit of supplication also: David and Daniel, Peter and John,
did (...) want the spirit of Prayer, when they kept the hours of Prayer.

Q The Lords Prayer consists of a Preface and a Body of Petitions; and there
be six Petitions of the Lords prayer: How be they divided?

A. In the first three we beg such things as do most immediately concern
Gods glory: In the three latter, such as concern our good.

Q. What learn you from this, that Christ teaches us in prayer to call God
Father?

consider God in our minds as a Father to us in Christ Jesus. Esaias 63.15, 16.
Luke 15.18. Math: 11.25. John. 17.25. With holy confidence.

Q. Why Father, rather then any other name or title of God?

and gives us boldness in prayer, coming to him as a Child to his Father, of
whose good will he is well persuaded. Math: 7.9, 11 Ephesians: 3.12. Psalm: 103.13,

glorious manner in Heaven. Ier: 23.24 Psalm: 11.4. Acts 7.49.

Q. Why is God set forth unto us by this title, Father in Heaven?

A. To show his excellency, presence and power, every way able, present and
ready to hear and help us, as being the best Father, the Lord and Master of
all things. [1. He is the best Father, as heavenly things are better then
earthly, 2. He is, wherever we are, 3. And he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth,
and from heaven does command blessings.] Lam. 3.41. 2. Chron. 20.6. 1 Kings
8.39. Mark 9 22, 23. John 11.22 29, 40 [This does wonderfully help our faith
that our God is able to forgive sins, to subdue Satan, to save a soul; and we
may expect any thing at his hands better then from an earthly father; yea if
some father of ours were in Gods place in Heaven, there were not so much
comfort in it; the Lords bowels, tenderness, sweetness, freeness, be as far
beyond and above all the love and compassion of the best natural Parent, as the
Heaven is above the Earth. Esaias 5.7, 8, 9. Psalm 123.1. Psalm. 115.3.

Exodus 3.14. Exodus 34.5, 6, 7. Es. 26.8.

Q. When is Gods name polluted and profaned?

A, Three manner of ways: 1 When we think or speak of God, of his Word, or

his works more meanly then of their Idols; they used his word and days as
common things.]

Q. When is Gods name hallowed or sanctified?

A. When it is known and acknowledged to the most holy, and accordingly set
forth by us. [ God does sanctify us by making us holy of unholy and unclean;
we sanctify God, not by making him holy, but by acknowledging him to be so, in
our hearts, words, and deeds, doing all things so, as God may be honored and
magnified by us and in us.] Rev: 5.13. Levit: 10.3. Mat: 5.16. 1. Cor: 10 31.

whatever become of us.

Q. What do we pray for here?

magnified, known, acknowledged, and glorified throughout the world. [If he
punish sinners, if he pardon sinners, if he work deliverances, perform

Mercy, Truth, Wisdom and Holiness may be seen and magnified by all men.]
John 12.28. Rom: 9.3. Psalm: 67.2. Hos: 2.8. We must not Ascribe our Riches our
Victories, our Deliverances, our Peace, our Punishments, nor our Sufferings,
either to our own Wit, or Strength, or to chance and fortune: We must not
Ascribe the Glory of any thing we are, or do to our selves, nor to any
Creature; But in all things God must be acknowledged to be Just, and Holy, and
Wise, and Good, and Righteous,

Q. Thy name, (comparatively) and in opposition to every other name, What does
that import? What do we pray for in that?

A. We pray that we may set up Gods name and glory above our selves, above men,
above Idols, and false gods, that above all adverse power it may be lifted up
and glorified: [ His Truth above every truth, his Mercy above every mercy, etc.
Whatsoever becomes of us or of the World, that God may be magnified and
glorified] Exodus 32.32. Number. 14.12, 13, 16, 27. Psalm. 115.1. Acts 12.22, 23.

A. It signifies that spiritual rule and dominion which God has given to
Christ over the Church to Rule and save it, and over the enemies of the Church
to subdue them. The Kingdom of Christ is begun here in Grace by his ruling in
our hearts and finished hereafter, in our Re^iging with him in glory for
evermore. Heb. 3.5, 6. Es. 52.7. Zach 9.9. John 18.36, 37. Ps. 2.6, 8. Ps.

Q. What be the parts of that spiritual Kingdom and Dominion?

A. Two: the first is that power, by which he a gathers to himself a Church
and people by his Gospel, by which also he b rules in their hearts and
consciences, and b preserves them to his Kingdom of Glory. [Christ is King of
souls, he sets up his Kingdom of grace in men's hearts.] a John 11.52. Ephesians.
4.11, 12. Rev. 19.15. Mat. 13.19, 47. Luke 17.21. b Ps. 110.2.3. Ephesians. 3.17. c
John 17.11, 12, 24. John 16.33. John 10.29. Jude v. 1.

Q. What is the second part of Christ's spiritual Dominion?

19 20.

Q. When does this Kingdom come?

A. When sin and Satan are cast out, and the Gospel of Christ is set up in
our hearts, and families, and Countries. [When we are turned from the power of
Satan to God, when Christ's word rules in our hearts, then is his Kingdom
come to us.] Col. 1.13. Acts 5.31. Luke 11.20, 22. 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. 1 Pet. 2 9.

Q. When does this Kingdom go away?

A. That the Gospel of Christ may be set up in its power and purity in all
hearts, and in all places, that God would protect and increase the number of
the faithful till the time come that the Kingdom of grace here begun, be
finished in the Kingdom of glory. 2 These. 3 1. Col. 4.3. Psalm. 122.6. Romans
10.1.

Q. What do we pray against?

A. We pray that God would destroy the kingdom of Satan, and all devices
against his Church and Gospel, and that all wickedness may be beaten down more
and more, [Till this Kingdom be finished in the glory of the Saints, and
final destruction of the enemies.] ps: 68 1, 18. Rev. 12.10, 11. We pray
against the dominion and power of the Devil, the World and the flesh. Rom,
6.12, 13, 14.

Q. What follows hereof?

A. Therefore they be Christ's enemies, and they cross their own Prayers, that
submit not to the Gospel of Christ, that discountenance, or any ways hinder
the Preaching and spreading thereof, or be friends and favorers of bad men and
bad causes. [Such as the silencing and vexing of Godly, quiet Ministers, or
depriving them of due maintenance, preferring the unsound, etc. any inlet to
profaneness, setting up a Chair for Satan against the Pulpit of Christ;
these and the like persons do pray for Christ's Kingdom, and fight for
Satan's; among swearing, railing loose, riotous persons, families, and
Parishes, whose Kingdom is there set up? Christ's or Satan's?] Luke 19.14, 27.
Acts 4.18.

CAP. XLV.
The 3d Petition. Thy will be done.
Q. WHat do we pray for in this Petition?

in a doing and in b suffering. Psalm. 143.10. Jam. 1.22, 25. b Luke 22.42. Acts
20.24, Acts 21.14.

A. Gods will is that which God in the Scripture has willed and commanded us
to do. Mat. 7.21. Romans 12.2. 1 These. 4.3. 1 Pet 4.2. 1 Pet. 3.17.

Q. When is Gods will done?

the things which are pleasing unto him Joh. 14.21. 1 John 5.3. Mat. 21.29, 31
Joh. 6.38. Heb. 10.7. [We desire that Gods will may take place, and that there
may be but one will between God and us.]

hearts, or other men's carnal wills Ephesians. 2.3. 1 Pet. 4.3. John 8.44. Luke 12.47.

that be repugnant to his good pleasure, may be subdued.] Mat. 20.39. 1 Samuel 3
18. 2 Samuel 15.26. Ps. 140.^, 1 Samuel 15, 13, 20, 22.

Q. What follows hereof?

A: Therefore like hypocrites they cross their own prayers, who pray they may
do Gods will, yet endeavor it not; nay perhaps live in known sins, against
check of conscience, setting up their own ends, profits and contentments, above
the will of God. [Be honest, else never pray it, etc.] Mat. 19.22. Luke 16 11.
Ezekiel. 14.7. Acts 8.23. Luke 12.47.

Q. This day, or day by day, Why are we to beg it every day, and but for a
day?

A. To teach us, that as God keeps and feeds us a day by day: And as every day

up helps to bring the creatures to us for our support and comfort [He gives

Ier 37.21. Dan. 1.15. [So the way be Gods way, in which any help comes,
whosoever is the instrument to convey it, God is the giver.]

Q. When is bread taken away?

A. When God does curse the earth and our labors, that they shall not yield
their increase, or else does curse his blessings to us, that they shall dot do

14.13. Hos. 9.11, 12.

Q. What do we pray for in this Petition?

A. That God would preserve us from outward miseries and wants, and so bless
the ^arth and our labors, that we may have such a measure of outward things,
as is needful for us, and that through his blessing they may be for our good

natures, and content our minds, or do us any good.] 1 Kings. 8 35, 37. Prove.
10.22. Prove. 30.8. Ps. 106.15. 1 Kings 17.14. 1 Chronicles. 29.12.

Hos. 2.^. 1 Chronicles. 29.14.

CAP. XLVI.
The 5th Petition. And forgive us, etc.
Q HEre we pray for the forgiveness of our sins and transgression Why be our
sins called debts? Mat. 6.^2.

A. Because they make us debtors to the Law and justice of God, to make
satisfaction for the offense done to him: [As ^ Felon is a debtor til he have
satisfied the Law.] Col. 2.14. Mat. 5.26.

Q How are we freed and discharged of this debt?

A. By Gods free grace and pardon, accepting us in Christ, when we had nothing
of our own to pay. [When we had nothing to pay, God provided a price out of
his own store.] Luke 7.42. Mat. 18.25, 27. Ephesians. 1.7. Christ has cancelled our
Bonds Col. 2.14.

Q What is forgiveness of sin?

A. It is a free and full discharge of a sinner from guilt and punishment,
whereby a sinner is received into favor with God. [Forgivenesse of sin is not
the abolishing of sin and corruption, by infusing an^ habit of charity and
holiness, (as Papists teach) but it is the receiving of a sinner into favor,
not in pu^ing unto him any blame.] Esa: 43.25. Esa. 44.22. Mich 7.18. Exodus:
34.7.

Q Does God forgive all men their sins?

A. No: only such as believe and repent, and walk by the rule of new obedience
Mark 1.4, 15. Gal. 6.16.

Q. What then is the substance of that we beg in this Petition?

A. We beg that God would give to every one of us faith and repentance, by
which we may be accepted into his favor, in, and for Christ's sake; having all
our sins freely and fully done away by him. Ps. 5^.1, 2, 7, 9. Dan. 9.17, 18,
19. The best have need every day to pray, forgive us our sins.

As we forgive.
Q. Why i^ that condition added?

A. Because no man can have assurance that God has pardoned his sins, unless
he find in himself a disposition to forgive his brother [The love of God shed
abroad in our hearts, begets in us compassion toward our brother, when he has
offended us [No unmercifull cruel man can be assured of mercy] Matthew: 6.14,
15. Matthew. 18.33, 35. Col: 3.13 Rom: 12.19.

Q How shall I know that I do indeed forgive my Brother?

A. By two things; First, if I dare not wish him ill, nor do him hurt, though
it lay in my power, no, nor yet rejoice when evil befalls him, though I had no
hand in it. Job. 31.29, 30. Prove. 24.17, 18. Ps. 35, 13, 14. Levit. 19 18.

Q. How 2dly shall I know it?

A Because it is a trouble to me to think ill of another; and I am glad to see
any good thing in my enemy, any cause to think better of him, any ground or
hope of reconciliation [A Christian is gentle and easy to be entreated, and
though some be so perverse and spiteful that one dare not trust them, yet we
can be glad of any good thing in them.] 2 Thessalonians. 3.14, 15. Jam. 3.17. Psalm.
120.6, 7.

Q. What do we learn from these two words, forgive our debts?

A. Two things. First, the dangerous nature of sin; our sins and our names
are entered into Gods debt-booke together, and we are every hour liable to be
arrested, and brought to an account before God. [What a case is he in that has
Bailies watching him in every place and corner. etc. Matthew. 5.25.

Q. What else do we learn?

A. It shows our inability to satisfy for the least sin, we have no price
to pay, we must be forgiven, or else cast into prison for the last farthing.
Romans 4.7. Mica 6.7.

CAP. XLVII.
The 6th Petition. Lead us not etc.
IN the former Petition we prayed to have our sins forgiven, now we pray that
we may be kept from sin for time to come.

Q. What do we learn from the order and connection of these two Petitions?

A. All that pray aright to have their sins forgiven, must be as earnest to
be kept from sin for time to come, Ps. 15.7 Romans 7.24. Psalm. 19.13. Carnal
people can pray for mercy, but the Godly will pray for Grace as well as mercy.

Q. What is here meant by Temptation?

A. Any thing whereby a man is enticed and drawn into sin. Jam. 1.14. 2 Cor.
11.3. 1 These. 3.5. John 13.2 Prove. 1.10, 11. There lies a Temptation in most
things we have to deal withal: as in Meats Drinks and Apparel, in Wealth, in
Poverty, in Preferments, in Examples, in Counselles, in fear of Men, in love of
life in our Pleasures, yea in our very callings And unless the Lord do
graciously keep us, we shall be enticed and drawn away.

Q. What is it to be (...) Temptation?

A. To be tempted is to be assured and provoked unto evil; but to be led into
temptation is, when we are deceived and overcome of the evil. [When we yield to
the evil motion, the snare is laid and we are caught.] 2 Samuel 11.2, 4. Mat. 16,
35, 69, 70. 1 Timothy 6.9.

Q. How does God lead into Temptation?

A. When he does not support and strengthen us against the evil, but leaves
us to our own wit, strength, or lusts, or unto Satan. 2 Chronicles. 32.31. 2 Chr.
10.15. 1 Kings 22.22. 2 Th. 2.11. To. 1.24. Job 1.12.

Q. How does God enable us to resist temptation?

A. Three ways, discern an evil motion. 2 Cor. 2.1^. Mat. 16.13. Neh. 6.11 13.

Q. How, secondly?

A. By making us ^^a ^ full over our slippery hearts, and (...) c^^tions of
faling. M^. 26.1 Prove. ^8 1 These. 5 22.

enable us to resist Temptations?

A. By fortifying us with says and courage whereby we clea^e to God against
all the world. Mat. 4.7. it is written: Ephesians. 6.11.

Q. What do we pray for in this Petition?

A. That God would give us spiritual wisdom and strength to discern and
overcome all temptations unto sin; and if at any time he suffer us to be
tempted, yet that he would not leave us to our selves to be deceived and
overcome of the evil. [We pray that God will hold us up, and deliver us from
the power of all spiritual enemies.]

But deliver us from evil.
Q. What Is here meant by evil?

A. The evil one, (that is) Satan and all his wiles, and subtilties. John
17.11, 12, 15. 1 John 5.18. Job 2.6.

Q. What do we pray against in these words?

A. That seeing we desire to be kept from sin, we desire also to be kept from
the power and wiles of the temptor: [That God would discover his wiles; and
help us against him, Genesis 20.6. 1 Samuel: 25.33. Zach. 3.2. Rev. 12.13, 16. Psalm.
17.4, 5.

Q. What must they do that pray to be kept from temptation?

A. In a due sense of our own weakness we must shun occasions of evil, we must
not cast our selves upon temptations: [For else we are not true to our own
prayers] Judge: 16.15, 17. Prove. 7.8. Genesis 34.1. Eccles. 2.3.

For thine is the Kingdom, etc.
Q. These words are for matter and form, a thanksgiving, What do we ascribe to
God therein?

A. We acknowledge that Kingdom a over all the world, and b power to do what
he will, and c glorious excellencies do belong to God our Father in Heaven: And
we ascribe the praise thereof to him. [The excellency of Grace, Majesty, Mercy,
Power, any thing whereby one may be magnified and extolled is the Lords
peculiarly, and transcendently.] 1 Chronicles: 29.11. Rev: 4.10, 11. a 1 Timothy 1.17.
Psalm: 103.19. Dan: 5.21. b Psalm: 115.3. Psalm: 62, 11. Rev: 4.8, 9. Deuteronomy. 32.31.
c Esaias 6.3, 5. Esaias 43.7. Rom: 9.17.

Q. What is required to an holy and right praising of God?

A. Two things. 1. We must labor to have our hearts a affected with his
glorious excellencies and greatness, Conditions in right Thanksgiving.
as being the fountain b of all the good we are, or have. a Esaias 12.4. Psalm:
126.2, 3. b 1 Chronicles: 29 11, 12. Psalm: 116.12, 13, 14. Mic. 7.18

Q. What 2ly must we do, If we desire to praise God aright?

A. We must endeavor to Live and Dye unto him who loved us first: we must use
all mercies which we receive from Him, unto his Honor and service. Psalm:
50.23. Ps: 18.1, 2. Rom: 14.8. 2 Cor. 5.15. Rom: 12.1, 2.

Q. Wherefore is this clause added to the end of the Lords prayer?

A. To teach us that the hearing and answering of our Prayers is grounded on a
Gods own goodness, b greatness, and c glory: [and by them he is engaged to
hear us. We must press God with the interest of his own glory, power and
Kingdom, for hearing and helping of us.] a Ezekiel. 36.22, 32. b Mic. 4.8. Dan.
3.16, 17. 2 Chronicles. 14.11. c Ier 14.8, 21, 22. Exodus: 32.11, 12. Josh. 7.9.

Q. What must they do that ascribe all these to God?

A. We must set a up God in our hearts as ^upream King, make him our Rock and
Fear, not b giving any part of his glory to any creature. a Matthew. 10.37. Luke
12.5. Ier. 10.7. Esa. 8.12, 13. b Dan. 2.30.

Q. [For ever,] What does that word import?

A. That Gods a Kingdom, power and glory, in, and over the Church, is
everlasting; it fails not: and that the Church shall b ascribe the same unto
him in all ages, and throughout all eternity: [When all Kings and Kingdoms
shall cease: when we are dead and gone; yet Christ remain^ a King of the
Church, and shall be magnified in it.] a Dan. 7.14. Esa. 50.2. Esa. 46.3, 4. b
Ephesians. 3.21. Rev. 5.13, 14 according to that ancient doxologie used in the
Churches of Christ, Glory be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy
Ghost, Hooker Pol. lib. ^. 8. 42.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Romans
11.36. Rev. 5.13.

AMEN.
Q. What does that Word import?

A. Amen being set after any prayer or thanksgiving, it does imply our consent,
confidence, and desire, that the thing shall be as is uttered Deuteronomy. 27.15, 16.
Jer. 11.5. Jer. 28.6. 1 Kings 1.36. 2 Cor. 14.16.

Q. What follows hereof?

A. That we must understand, attend unto, and affect the things prayed for;
else how shall I say Amen? They that pray in an unknown tongue, or gaze up and
down, or fiddle about their clothes and other matters, and complements in time
of prayer, do not bear a part in Prayer, and their Amen is fruitless and
vain. 1 Cor, 14.16. Rev. 22.20.

CAP. XLVIII.
Of the right Use, and Abuse of the Lords Prayer.

Q. HOw may a Christian make a right use of the Lords prayer?

A. We may use it both for a Rule of prayer, to measure our requests, and make
other prayers by; and also for a prayer it self, as it was delivered by
Christ. [Christ puts matter and words into our mouths: Christ taught his
Apostles to pray, as John taught his Disciples, (that is) He did not only give
Rules of Prayer, and a pattern, but a form for them to use,] Mat. 6.7, 9. Luke
11.1, 2. If you ask, May we pray our Father etc? our Lord Christ gives the
Answer, when you pray, say, Our Father etc.

Of set Forms Prayer
Q Is a Set Form of Prayer lawful, either of our own making, or delivered to
us in a book?

A. Yes, it is, else Christ and the Prophets would never have delivered set
forms to be used by the Church. [God appointed Forms, and therefore forms be
not ^ themselves unlawful: the prayer is not evil, because it is a formed
prayer.] Number: 6.23, 26 Joel 2 17. 1 Chronicles. 16.7, 35. 2 Chronicles. 29.30 He gives
the form, he sets them the words to be used: and it was at a solemn Fast too.

Q. But is a set form of Man's making lawful to be used by us?

A. Yes, If the prayer for matter and substance be lawful; and such as
concerns us, we may safely use it. [We may use the words of Moses, Daniel,
Nehemiahs prayer.]

Q. Is stinted prayer lawful; (that is) set prayer, to which one is confined;
and tied to use no other? Of stinted prayer.


A. That Is unlawful both in public and private: he that confines himself to
book-prayers, or to the prayers of others with whom he joins, or to set
prayers of his own devising, can never discharge the duty of right praying. Ps.
50.15. Jer. 14.7, 21. Ezra 9.6. Dan. 9 5. They changed their Prayers with the
occasions.

Q. Why so?

A. Because (...) prayers must be made according to our necessities; and
neither book, nor men with whom we join in prayer, can express all o u wants
and griefs; nor I my self this day, what I shall need pray for to morrow. [Yet
it concludes not that set prayer, or prayer with others, for so much as it does
contain of meet matter to be asked, is hereby unlawful; Because by such
prayers we are not sti^ted, but have liberty, both the Ministers in their
Congregations, and our selves in private, to enlarge our prayers as caus^
requires. There is adds between law^^ll and sufficient: such a measure of
Petitions is sufficient for the public, or the family which is not sufficient
every way to all my occasions: and that prayer may be sufficient at one time,
which is not at another.]

Q. But in praying must we not exercise the spirit of prayer? And can that be
done in a set or book prayer?

A. Yes, the spirit of prayer is, when we beg in faith, with feeling and
fervency with sights and groans; and that is done when we join with others,
or use set forms as well as in sudden, and ex tempore conceived prayers. [As a
Beggar in true want, beggs hard if there be any hope of obtaining; and yet
peradventure the next day, or to the next man, uses the same words, or to the
like effect: the varying of a phrase does not make it the spirit of prayer.]
Mat. 26.39, 42, 44. with Heb: 5.7. 2 Cor. 13.14. with 2 These. 3.17, 18. Col.
3.16. [The songs are not less spiritual, because set and taken out of the
book, if our hearts be affected with the matter.] Eccles. 5.2. Job 22.27, 28.

Q. When is the Lords Prayer abused?

A. When people say it over without understanding and affection, or else make
vain and needless repetitions of it: [both these are a taking of Gods name in
vain] 1 Cor. 14.15. Mat. 6.7, 9.

Our duty after Prayer.
Q. What is our duty after we have prayed?

A. 1. We must Practice what we pray for: our actions must not cross our
prayers. We must not pray and still rebel against God. Hos. 7.14. We must
join our endeavors with our prayers, Genesis 32.9, 11, 12. with Ps. 13.30. 2
These. 2.2. with 2 Cor. 11.2, 33.

Q. What 2dly must we do after we have prayed?

A. 2. When we have prayed, we must observe how well our prayers have sped, how
God does answer our requests, Psalm. 85.8. Luke 18.5. [There is expectation of
answer from God to fulfill our desires; if you knock at ones door ye listen
for an answer: if you prefer a Petition, you will look what answer is
returned: so etc.

Q. How shall I know whether my prayer be heard or not? How shall I comfort my
self in that case?

A. There be four Rules: First, think not thy prayers denied, though they be
delayed. [God deals after diverse manners with his servants; sometimes he
answers presently, Dan. 9.21, 23. Esaias 65.24. Sometimes he seems to stop his
ear, and to deny us for diverse reasons; as 1. Because he loves to hear the
voice of his children crying unto him: 2. Perhaps thou art not ready for the
blessing, 3. Perhaps it is better thou should want it. 4. Perhaps thou
take a wrong course to obtain it. 5. Perhaps thou prescribest to God; and
God will give thee the blessing in a way more for his glory, as Christ did.]
John 11.3, 6, 15, 40. Genesis 25.21.

Q. What second rule have you?

A. If God give some better thing in stead of what we beg, or strength to bear
the want of our desires, we must not take our selves to be denied. 2 Cor. 12.9.
Genesis 17.18. 2 Samuel 12.23, 25. Deuteronomy. 3.26. Psalm. 3. 4, 5. Psalm. 138.3.

Q. What third rule to judge of Gods acceptance of our prayers?

A. When after prayer we find our hearts to be drawn to God, and our spirits
upheld to continue praying, returning to that duty with fresh delight and
hopes, that is a sign we are heard. [It is a sign the beggar fares well,
where he goes often. It is a good sign, when we still go to God as to our
best friend.] Psalm. 116.1, 2. 1 Samuel 1.18, 28.

Particularly touching forgiveness of sins, how shall I know that my prayer
is heard?

A. If I get a victory over my sin, if the sense of Gods love does work in me a
love to God again, and to the things of God; [that is a sign our prayer is
heard]. Luke 8.46, 47. Luke 7.47.

Q But if we find no token of Gods answering our prayers, what is to be done?

A. We must search if there be any accursed thing that may hinder our prayers;
and also we must be humbled for our failings in the manner of our duty. Josh.
7.7, 10, 11. 1 Chronicles. 15.13. Iam. 4.3 Luke 9.54.

CAP. XLIX.
Of the Seals of the Covenant.

Q. WE have spoken of two means of working and increasing faith, viz. the Word
and Prayer: By what means is God wont to seal up to our hearts the assurance
of our reconciliation with himself?

A. Two ways: 1. Inwardly by the testimony of the Holy Ghost, witnessing with
our Spirits that we are Gods children. Of the witness of the spirit.
2. And outwardly by the Sacraments, Romans 8.16. 2 Cor. 1.32.

Q. How does the Spirit of God inwardly witness to a man his salvation?

A. Two ways: first, by imprinting holiness and the stamp of grace on the
heart thereby showing us our right to the promises of life: [as the seal
leaves its impression on the wax, so does the Spirit. And look where grace is
printed, there is the spirit that wrought it: and we have that seal to show
for our salvation.] Gal. 5.18, 22, 23, 25. Gal. 6.16. Romans 8.13. 2 Cor. 3.3. A
seal makes things to be autehntick and warrantable: Deeds and writings once
sealed are good in Law, and we may plead our right by the seal: so etc.

Q. How secondly does the Spirit witness with our Spirits?

A. By cheering, strengthening, and clearing up the Conscience to see, and
acknowledge, and to certify our hearts of the truth of Grace, so as to make us
able to say, I have true faith, and true hatred of sin, etc, [The spirit
says, They that are called; are certainly saved. Now the conscience
enlightened does say, It Is so and so with me. This is the answer of a good
conscience, and the witness of two is true, Gods Spirit and our spirits: as
conscience awakened can tell David, thou have done ill in the matter of Vriah,
so the conscience enlightened and cleared can tell Peter, and make him say with
confidence, Lord thou know, and I know that I love thee, John 21.17.] Ephesians.
1.13. 1 Pet. 3.21. 1 John 2.20, 27. 1 Cor. 2.11, 12. 1 John 5.20.

Q. But put case our conscience cry peace without any such impression, and
character of grace on the heart; What then?

A. Then it is a false cry, it being but the single testimony of our own
deceived and several from the true testimony of the Spirit of God, which ever
agrees with the Scripture. [The Spirit of God does not cross the word, it
does not bless whom the word curses, nor curse whom the word blesses; and if
our own hearts do so we know it to be a false testimony, and a deceived
spirit.] 1 John 5.6, 8. Psalm 51.9, 10.

Q. Put case I find some works of the sanctifying Spirit, and yet feel
unquietness in my own conscience?

A If upon examination thou find any sin in thy soul, pull it out and cast
it from thee, but if there be no sin that hinders thy peace, then thy
conscience ought to acquit thee. [Thou art in safety, and in Gods favor by the
spirit of sanctification, whereby thou do cleave to thy God amidst all fears
and doubts.] Esaias 50.10. Job 27 1, 4, 6. Job 13 15. Thus of the inward
Testimony of the Holy Ghost; follows the outward.

Q. How does God seal up our Redemption to us outwardly?

A. By the Sacraments, which to the worthy partakers are particular tokens and
pledges of Gods favor and good will toward us in the death of his Son. [In
the word God speaks generally; but* becomes home to each particular believer in
the Sacraments.]

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. A Sacrament is a seal of the righteousness of faith, What a Sacrament is.
or it is a token of the Covenant between God and us, Genesis 17.10, 11. Romans
4.11. A Sacrament has two uses. 1. Of a sign promisory to represent. 2. Of a
seal to exhibit, and put us in possession of the things granted by Gods
Covenant.

Q. Must we be in Covenant with God before we can partake of the Sacraments?

A. Yes: for else the outward signs do not profit: Abraham was first in
Covenant with God, and then he received the sign of Circumcision. [Even as we
use first to agree upon the conditions before we seal and deliver the deeds]
Genesis 15.6, 18. with Genesis 17 7, 10, 11. with Romans 4.10, 11. Acts 8.13, 21, 37.
As in Covenant, and Contract of Marriage, there is first a consent of the
parties, and then the writings are sealed, so it is in this covenant of Grace,
both we and our Children must be in Covenant with God, before the Sacraments
which are the seals of the Covenant can belong to us, Some are in Covenant
with God, only by outward profession, and thing signified, as Acts 5.3. 1 Cor.
10.3, 5. 1 Cor. 11.27. Romans 2 25. others are really in both the sign, and the
things thereby signified, as Acts 2.41. 1 Pet. 3.21 Our Children are taken into
Gods Covenant, and so have the sign of Baptism, Howbeit when they come to
age, they must perform the condition of their Fathers Faith, else they forfeit
all.

Q. The Sacraments of the Old Testament were two. 1. Circumcision and 2. the
Passover: of the New Testament be likewise two Sacraments. Baptism and the
Lords Supper; How do they differ the one from the other? The New from the Old?

A. Not in substance, for Christ is the substance and end of all Sacraments;
but only in the manner; the Old did lead unto, and fet forth Christ's death
which was to come, the New do set forth Christ already come, 1 Cor. 10.3, 4. 1
Cor. 5.7. Exodus 12.13.

The parts of a Sacrament.
Q. How many parts be there in a Sacrament?

A. There be two parts in every Sacrament: 1. Some outward and bodily sign: 2.
And some spiritual benefit signified thereby

Q. What is the spiritual thing signified in every Sacram^nt?

A. Christ crucified, or the doing away of sins, in, and for the death of
Christ: [it is not every grace represented by an outward sign, that does make
a Sacrament, but the benefit of Christ's passion is that grace which is set
forth in every Sacrament. [ Col. 2.11, 12. Mark 1.4. Matthew. 26.28. 1 Cor
10.16. 1 Cor. 5.7.

Q. What follows hereof?

A. Therefore those other five Sacraments of the Papists, viz Confirmation,
Penance, Orders, Matrimony, extreme unction, are falsely called Sacraments of
the New Testament, as being neither ordained by Christ, nor having such
Sacramental signs and significations. [A Christian needs but two things to his
being, viz. a new birth, and a growth in Christ, both which are set forth in
the other two Sacraments; besides, those five are not common to all Christians
that be in Covenant with God, nor yet peculiar to the Christian Churches.]

Q. Who is the Author and ordainer of all Sacraments?

The Author.
A. Only the Lord God: None but God can forgive sins, and bestow spiritual
graces, and therefore none but God can make signs and seals thereof. [As he
alone can sign and seal a deed that has the right to sell the land: All
signs and Sacraments of man's devising cannot teach or help devotion, but only
delude and breed superstition. It is a foolish thing to make a significant
sign of that which is not in our power to give.] Mat. 28.19. 1 Cor. 11.23.

Q. What is the efficacy of Sacraments? Do they justify the receiver, or work
in us that grace which they signify, if the party him self do not hinder it by
some gross sin? And Efficacy.


A. No: Sacraments are signs of Gods grace and favor toward us, but not the
working causes thereof: [For then the sign should be before the thing whereof
it is a sign, which cannot be. Sacraments serve as it were to put us in
possession of the Covenant, as a sealed deed formally delivered does of an
house or land that is sold: Remission of sins, and oher blessings of the
Covenant, are not in the Sacraments, as Heat is in the fire, or as a medicine
in a box; But as a Key given in token of possession, or a deed whereby Men are
enfeoft in any House or Land, are in Law sure Pawn^ of the things promised; so
are the holy signs, given to the beleiver. Remission of sins and
sanctification of our hearts is from God alone through the blood of Jesus
Christ; yet for the applying thereof unto us, there are diverse means
established, as Act: 2.38. Mat: 3.7. Mar: 1.4. Mat. 26.28. 1 Cor. 10.16. Cor:
5.19 Act: 8.22. Ja: 5.15. Mat: 18.18. Ioh: 20.23. All these are Acts instituted
by God, Sacraments are not physical, but moral instruments by which God
bestows what they represent: the use of them is in our hands the effect' in
Gods; for the use we have his Commandment, for the effect his Conditional
promise. The Sacraments are not bare resemblances and memorials of things
absent, nor naked signs of Grace received before, but means effectual, whereby
God delivers into our hands the Grace signified by them. Ho^ker Pol. l. 5. S.
57.
and executed by us for that purpose. And therefore although the dead soul,
that has no inward motion of faith to receive the benefit offered, nor any
disposition of heart answerable to the thing that is done outwardly, these
means avail nothing. Gal. 5 6. Yet on Gods part offering, and on man's part
duly receiving and embracing them, the outward sign, and the spiritual
benefit thereby signified do ever go together: hence it is, that in the
Scripture, that which is proper to the thing signified, is sometimes ascribed
to the sign; as Acts 22.16. Arise, and be Baptized, washing away sins, with
1 Cor: 10.16. 1 Cor: 11. 24, 25. The which is well expressed Art. 25 of the
Church of Eng. Gallica Confessio fidei Art 34.37. Harm. of Confessions.
That the Sacraments be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace,
and Gods good will toward us, and in such only as worthily receive the same,
they have a wholesome effect. By the Sacraments, God does quicken, strengthen,
and Confirm our faith, ibid.

CAP. L.
Of Baptism.

Q. WHat is Baptism?

A. It is a Sacrament of our engrafture into Christ out of old Adam. entrance
into the Church, witnessing unto us, that whereas we were before strangers from
God, a God does now receive us into his family and people, and we again b give
up our selves together Cor 12.13 Gal. 3.27. Ephesians. 2.11, 12, 13 b Mat. 3.8, 11.
Romans 6.3, 4.

Q What Is the owtward sign in Baptism?

A. The dipping or sprinkling of water in the name of the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, Mat. 28.19. for dipping see John 3. 23. Mat. 3, 6 16. Acts 8.38 And
for sprinkling, read Ac^ 16.33. in Houses: Mark 7.4. with Heb. 9.10, 19, 20,
21, 22. Heb. 12.24.

Q. What is the spiritual thing signified by this sprinkling of water?

A. The clensing of the soul from all sin by the blood of Christ sprinkled
on it, Acts 2.38. Rom: 6.3. Col: 2.12, 13. Baptism teaches and signifies
unto us that in Christ we, who were dead in sins, are quickened, and washed,
and all our sins forgiven, by the mighty operation of God. Ephesians: 5.26. Tit: 3.5.
In and by Baptism God does two things: instruct us touching Christ crucified,
that our sins are washed, and our souls cleansed from all sin by his blood. 1
John 1.7. Rev. 1.5. 2. He does apply the same in particular to the party
Baptized, Acts 22.16. word of command [go and Baptize them] and of the word of
promise of a benefit to worthy receivers [Be Baptized for remission of sins,
Acts 2.38.] They do tell us that Christ is ours, given to us, and his blood
sprinkled on us, and by this means, (it being a word of promise (and every word
of promise is a word serving to beget faith) the spirit of God does stir up
faith, strengthen and confirm faith in us: God does not put any such virtue
into the signs, as to pardon our sins and make us Holy, ex opere operato,
neither does God so tie his presence to the water, as if where the Ministers
Action is, there God is also, and at the same time; for many have the sign,
that never have the thing, as Simon Magus, Judas, etc. and some have the
benefit of Baptism long after, as Infants when they come to age: But none have
the benefit of Baptism* but such as come by Faith to behold Christ crucified
in and through the outward signs, and so use the signs as means of applying
Christ to their own souls for remission of sins. See Art. 27. of Chapter of Eng.

Q What is it to be baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?

1. Goes par- of the Covenant,
A. Two things are meant by it: First, thereby is testified to the party
Baptized, that he is received into the flock and family of God. [God does
avouch him for his child, God does bind himself to us; and make over his
Covenant to us. Genesis 17.7.

Q. What secondly?

2. Our part.
A. The party that receives Baptism does enter into an Oath and Covenant, to
take the Lord for his God; thereby binding himelfs to believe, and serve that
true God who is Father, Son and Holy Ghost. [We are then enrolled, and
written among the Sons of God, Genesis 17.1. Gal. 3.27. 1 Cor. 1.13.15. We
avouch God to be our God.] Deuteronomy. 26.17, 18.

Q. Is it thus with all that are baptized? Do all receive those benefits?

A. No, only they that have, or come to have faith to believe the promises, and
repentance to forsake sin, Gal. 5.6. 1 Pet. 3.21. Acts 8.21, 23 Mark 16, 16.
[In Scripture they are reputed aliens and strangers from the covenants of
promise, who have not the sign of the Covenant: 2. And they that reject the
signs are reputed to reject the Covenant it self, Ephesians. 2.11. Genesis 17.14. Luke
7.30. 3. So they that receive the sign of the Covenant, joining themselves to
the people of God, are in Scripture reputed to be of the household of faith, and
Saints confederate with the Church of God, Esaias 56.3. Heb. 9.13. 4 But really
and effectually they only receive the benefits which come to have the
conditions of the Covenant, viz. Faith, and repentance. Act. 8.21, 23. 1 Cor.
10, 3, 5. Act. 3.26. 1 Pet. 3.21. The duties of them that be Baptized.
The duty of all that be Baptized is reduced to three heads. 1. To Renounce The
devil, the World, and the Flesh. 2. To Believe in Jesus Christ, and to
maintain the Faith once delivered to the Saints against all Sects and Heresies
whatsoever. 3. We promise to walk obediently in all Gods Commandments.

Q. Are the conditions of faith and repentance required in all that are to be
baptized?

A. Yes, in all that be Baptized when they be of ripe age; but in little
Children it is sufficient that they show forth faith and repentance when they
come to age.

Q. May little Children be Baptized?

1. Practice.
A. Yes: the Apostles did baptize whole households, in which number were their
Children: [As Abraham and his household were circumcised (that is) He and his
Children, for Ismael was but thirteen years old when he was circumcised, Genesis
17.25. And there is reason for it; because there is the same relation from the
believing parents to the children already born, as to them that shall be born;
and therefore if the children of Stephanas and the Jailer, which were borne
after their conversion, ought to be baptized by virtue and privilege of the
parents faith, why not also the children that were already born, seeing they
are the children of believers: moreover this practice of baptizing Infants by
the Apostle is gathered from that Phrase, Heb. 6.2. (laying on of hands) which
was a ceremony used in prayer for them that had been-Baptized in their Infancy,
See Calvin Inst. lib. 4. c. 16. 4. de Confirmatione.
when they were Catechized in the doctrines to be known and believed by grown
men that were admitted to Baptism Calv on Heb. 6.2.] Acts 16 33. 1 Cor. 1.16
Genesis 17.25.

Q. Why are Infants of believers to be Baptized?

A. Because they belong to the covenant of grace, 2. Promises. and Commandment.
and be of the number of Gods people, and are inheritors of the blessings which
God promised to the seed of the faithful. 1 Cor. 7.14. Rom: 11.16. Acts 2.39.
Mark 10.13, 14, 15. Genesis 17.7, 9, 12, 14. with Gal. 3.16. Romans 4.11, 12. In
those Scriptures Note five things. 1. That Infant-membership, and Admission by
an outward Gospel Covenant, wherein Blessedness was promised in and through
Christ the Promised seed. Gal. 3.8. with Genesis 12.3. and that Covenant is to
endure to the end of the World. Gal: 3.16, 17. the persons with whom God made
the Gospel Covenant, it was Abraham, and his Infant Seed and so with believers
of all Nations, who have as much right to that promise, (I will be thy God, and
the God of thy seed) as Abraham had. 4. There is a command to mark the
Infant-children of the Covenant, Genesis 17 10, 12. The which command is no where
reversed, but rather established* Mat. 28.19. Baptize al; Infants are not
excepted, but rather included in that Promise. Act 2.3^. And though the sign
of the Covenant be changed, yet neither is the Covenant it self, nor the
commandment, to Mark Infants, reversed. 5ly Note what Christ did, and the
reason why he did it. 1. what Christ did, He said, forbid them not to come unto
me -- And albeit Infants did not knew what was done unto them. yet Christ gave
them both his blessing and an outward sign of it, He laid his hands on them.
2. Next Christ gives a reason why he did this, because to them belongs the
Kingdom of Heaven, and remission of sins. Now if Christ esteem it a
sufficient reason, why Infants should be admitted to the signs of his
blessing, because the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them, then who shall dare
forbid them? or debar them from baptism, the first sign of the Covenant of
Grace?

Q. What if the immediate parents be believers only in show, may their
Children be baptized?

A. Yes, for, First, the profession of the faith is sufficient: 2ly Children of
professors have right to Baptism by virtue of the first Covenant with Abraham,
in whom we have as true an interest as the Jews ever had, Acts 8.12, 13, 37.
with Acts 10.47. Gal. 3.29. Romans 11.17. [So that the wickedness of the
immediate parent does not prejudice the right of the child: for then Hezekiah
should not have been circumcised, because he had a wicked father. No covenant
or condition of man's making must be set above the covenant and conditions set
by Christ, to make them void to believers.] Godly parents have sometimes
graceless children, and Carnal Parens have sometimes gracious children.

Q What can Baptism profit Infants, seeing they have no faith?

A. Very much: for as men by deed and seal convey lands to heirs that shall
be borne, as well as to them that be already born, so does God by his Promise,
which takes its effect in due time. [As Gods Promise that Abraham's seed should
inheri-Canaan, did not take effect till 430 years after, yet then it spoke and
failed not. And as our children are taken Tenants, and made members of some
Manor or Lordship by the delivery of a white wand, or the like ceremony, when
they be little; the which Tenements they enjoy when they come to age: so does
Gods covenant of peace and Grace made in Baptism, take its effect in due
time.] God is the great Landlord of Heaven, he puts our Childrens life into
that copy, etc.

Q. What if they do not perform the condition when they come to age?

A. Then they can have no good of their Baptism, 1 Pet. 3.21. Neh. 5.13. [God
will shake them out of his Church.] Romans 2.28. As you put a child's life into a
Living, when he is of age he enjoys it: But if he refuse to do Homage, or to
pay the Lords rent, then he forfeits his Living: so etc.

CAP. LI.
Of the Lords Supper.

Q. WHat is the outward sign in the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine given and received as Christ has ordained.

Q What is the thing signified and remembered in, and by them?

A. The death of Christ, when he offered up his righteous soul a sacrifice for
sin, [gave his body to be broken, and his blood to be shed for sinners,] Esaias
53.6, 8, 10. Luke 22.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25, 26.

Q. The Bread and Wine then are not turned into the very body and blood of
Christ by the consecration of the Elements, as if Christ should be there bodily
present?

A. No, by no means: Against Transubstantiati-
for the Heavens must contain his body till he come again for our full
redemption. And it is as impossible for Christ's body to be in Heaven and Earth,
and in ten thousand places one of us. [This conceit of Papists is not only
against our senses of sight, and taste, and feeling, but also against an
Article of Faith, namely, the trueness of Christ's humane nature in his
Incarnation; and against that Article of Christ's sitting at the right hand of
God; Gods Omnipotency does not make a true body to be in many places at the
same instant of time.] Act. 3.20, 21. Luke 24.6.

Q Show some other reasons against Transubstantiation, and the real presence
of Christ in the Eucharist.

A. The Bread which is broken in the Sacrament cannot be his very body, because
his very body is whole, and the Sacrament sets forth Christ broken for us:
[Therefore it is a remembrance, not a transubstantiation.] 1 Cor. 11.24. We set
forth his death, we do not kill him again.

Q. Show a third reason.

A. All that eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his blood, in the Scripture
sense are saved; But all that eat of the Mass are not saved: [Therefore the
Mass and the Scripture-eating agree not.] John 6.51, 53, 54, 57.

Q. Show a forth reason against the bodily eating of Christ.

A. Because. if one should eat a piece of his flesh, (as his finger, or foot,
etc.) that would not profit, Ioh. 6.52, 61, 63. What if the Soldier that
pierced him, had tasted of the blood which came out of his side, could that
have done him any good? surely no, for our redemption stands in the
satisfaction which by his dying he made unto the Law: and the means by which we
eat his Flesh and drink his Blood, is not with the Mouth and Teeth but Faith in
the heart.

Q Then Christ is not offered up a Sacrifice for the quick and dead in the
Eucharist, [as the Papists teach.] Catechismus Romans part. 2. c. 4.

A No: for as Christ cannot dye and suffer often, so neither is he offer^d
often. But by one sacrifice of himself once offered, he has put away sin for
ever. [He has perfected for ever them that are sanctified, by once dying, else
were his sacrifice weak and imperfect, like the sacrifices of Aarons Priests.
Our duty in the Sacrament is to receive him by faith, not to offer him in
sacrifice to God. In the Sacrament God offers Christ to us: we do not offer him
to God. Heb. 9.25, 26, 28. with Heb. 10 10, 11, 12, 14 Romans 6.10. Ioh. 1.29.
The offering of Christ once made, is a perfect redemption, propitiation, and
satisfaction for the sins of the whole World, both original and Actual, and
there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone, Art. 31. of Chapter Eng.

Q. What follows hereof?

A. Therefore the Mass is a very Idol and they that use it, Papists be
Idolaters.
or adore it, or ascribe to it the virtue of Christ's sacrifice, are very
Idolaters. The sacrifice of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the
Priests did offer Christ for the quick and dead, to have Remission of Pain and
Guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceipts ibid.

Q. What then is the meaning of these words; This is my body?

A. Paul tells us, it is the Communion of the body and blood of Christ; (that
is) an ordinance wherein the faithful have exhibited to them a fellowship in
the merits and virtue of the Sacrifice of Christ's death,] 1 Cor. 10.16, 17.
Exodus 24.8. [as the Cup is called the New Testament, and Christ is called our
Passover, 1 Cor. 5.7.] The Lords supper is a Sacrament of our redemption by
Christ's death, insomuch that to such as worthily, and with faith receive the
same, the Bread which we break, is a partaking of the body of Christ, and the
Cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ. Art. 28. of the Church
of Eng.

Q. What is the end and use of this Sacrament? The Use of the Lords Supper. 1.


A. There be three especial uses of it. 1. By it as by a token or pledge from
God the worthy Receiver is assured that he has a part and share in Christ's
death. [The Lord Christ established the New Testament by his own death: all the
good things contained in the New Covenant are made sure by the death of Christ
the Promiser, and he bids us eat of that bread, and drink of that Cup, in
remembrance of the same.] 1 Cor. 11.25, 26. There is a Sacramental Union
between the signs, and the things signified, such an union as is between a
sealed will, and the Legacies bequeathed by the same: He that has a Lease
sealed knows that he has more then paper and wax: so it is in this business.

Q. Do all that come receive such a pledge of Gods favor?

A. No, only they that be worthy receivers; the rest receive mere bread and
wine, and so profane Gods ordinance, and procure judgments to themselves, 1
Cor. 11.27, 29. The Wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, are in no
wise partakers of Christ, but rather to their condemnation, do eat and drink
the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing: Art. 29. of Chapter of Eng.

Q. What other end and use is there of this Sacrament?

A. It is a badge of our Christian profession, wherein we with believing and
thankful hearts do remember the love, and show forth the virtue of Christ's
death: And also profess our selves to be the people of Christ, against all
Atheists, Sects, Heretics, misbelievers, and loose-livers whatsoever; we are
hereby obliged to stand for Christ against all the world, 1 Cor. 10.20, 21. 1
Cor. 11.25, 26. 2 Cor. 6.15.

Q. What third use is there of it?

A. It is a Bond and Pledge of that Love which Christians ought to have one to
another, and of their joynt-fellowship in Christ the Head. 1 Cor: 10.17. 1 Cor.
12.13, 14. 1 Cor. 11.18, 21, 22. John 13.2, 4, 14, 34.

CAP. LII.
Of right participation of the Lords Supper.

Q. WHo ought to be partakers of the Lords Supper?

A. Only such as have bin Baptized, and are able to make profession of their
faith, and to examine themselves; that is, Such as are able to discern the
Lords body.] Exodus: 12.43, 44, 48. 1 Cor. 11.28. Ezra: 6.21. Ezekiel: 44.7.]

Q What must a man examine himself in?

A. Whether he be a true Member of Christ or not; Of self-examination.
[For none else can partake worthily of the Sacrament of Christ.] 2 Cor. 13.5.
1 Ioh 5.12. Ephesians. 5.23.

Q. How may that be known?

A. If I have a sound faith, and true b repentance, and am c quickened to
newness of life and d love of the brethren, I am assuredly a member of Christ,
a Rom: 11.17, 20. b Gal 5.24. Mat. 3.8, 10. c 2 Cor: 5.17. John 15.4, 5. d 1
Pet 1.22. 1 John 3.14. [For further trial of these graces I refer you to my
other small Catechism, entitled, An help for Young People, etc. Anno Dom.
1640. and it may be fitly bound with this.]

Q. A Christian that has these graces, may yet through carelessness come to
the Lords table unworthily; for preventing whereof what must we do before we
come? Before we come.


A. We must stir up those graces in us, and labor to see our a need of
Christ, and to b cleanse our souls afresh from every new pollution wherewith we
have been defiled, a Math. 5.6. Luke 1.53. b 2 Chronicles. 30.17, 18. Matthew 5 23 24.
1 Cor. 11.17, 18. Levit 15.31. Number: 9.6, 7, 10, 1 Renewed faith and repentance
is needful.

Q. How ought a Christian to behave himself in the act of receiving?

1. In the time of Receiving.
A He must discern the Lords body (that is) he must not use the^ as common
bread and wine, but consider in them their spiritual relations, and so receive
them as tokens of the covenant. Wax sealed, and set to a deed, though for
substance it be Wax still, yet for use it is to you more then wax, and of more
value then all the wax in the Merchants shop: So this Bread and Wine by Christ's
institution are seals set to his Testament, and with them Christ gives us his
Body and Blood for remission of sins, by whom as by Bread and Wine, our
spiritual hunger is satisfied, our Graces strengthened, our spiritual Life
preserved unto Life eternal.
[We use our ordinary bread and wine for natural uses, viz. to refresh and
nourish our bodies, but this bread and wine for spiritual ends and uses.] 1
Cor: 11.12, 29, Levit: 10.3. In the use of this Sacrament Bread and Wine, we
must behold the love of the Father giving his Son to death, the love of Christ
in laying down his life for his friends, and the merit, and al sufficiency of
Christ's blood to take away al our sins.

Q. How may this be done?

A I must see and consider in the signs the things signified, and apply both
to my own soul in particular, giving thanks to God for Christ, and for my
redemption by him. [This particular application of faith is to eat Christ:
Christ gives me to understand that his body was broken for me as the Bread is:
and as certainly as I behold the bread of the Lord broken to me, and the cup
communicated to me, so we have a true right to him; and he is as truly ours as
our meat and drink are ours.] John 6.33, 35, 36. Heb. 9.20. Luke 22 20.

Q. What must a Christian do after receiving?

A. We must pay our vows, (that is) we must be careful to perform our
covenant which now we have renewed with God in Jesus Christ, 3. After Receiving.
Psalm. 50.14 2 Cor. 6.1. 2 Cor. 7.1. 2 Pet. 1.4. Romans 2.25.

Q. How may we find that we have made a right use of this Sacrament?

A. When we are more refreshed with the feeling of Gods favor toward us, and
do grow in newness of life. [As the right use of food is to outgrow
sickness, and gather strength for the better performance of actions of our
natural life; so when we are more lively and zealous, and get more strength
against our corruptions, and Tentations, or any ways grow in the new creature,
then have we not received in vain.] 2 Chro. 30.25, 26. with 2 Chro: 31.1. 1
Cor. 11.17. when we are bettered by it, then have we received aright.

Q. There be some to whom this Sacrament does not at all belong, they have no
interest in the matter; who be they?

A. The ignorant and disobedient, that is, such as cannot give account of their
faith, or by their wicked lives show themselves utterly unworthy: [They come
not within the judgment of charity.] Ezr 6.21 2 Chro: 30.17, 18. God had
smitten them, etc. Ezekiel. 44.7. 1 Cor. 5.6, 13 Infants and natural Fools, and
all persons that cannot examine themselves, nor discern the Lords body, as also
all open impenitent sinners, all such persons must not meddle with the Lords
Supper* ^ Cor. 11.28, 29. 1 Cor. 5.7, 13.

Q The least sin that a man knows by himself unrepented, i^ a just cause to
keep himself from the Sacrament; But are all the sins we kn^w by other men a
just cause for us to keep them from the Lords Supper?

A. Not only such offenses as are openly known, and scandalous to the
congregation; [The rest do profess with their mouths, and if they do not
believe with their hearts, and repent indeed, they are no better then Judas,
who seemed to be one of the rest, but was not. It is not our own private
knowledge or suspicion of the parties unsoundnesse that must put him off,
unless the party be accused and admonished of his sin by them that have
authority in the name of Christ for the good of the party, and the satisfaction
of the Congregation to restrain them; Christ knew Judas from the beginning,
yet etc.] John 13.11, 18. 1 Cor. 5.1, 2. It is reported, etc. Mat. 22.2, 10,
11, 12. Mat. 18.15, 17.

Q. Is not the rest of the congregation polluted by the mixture of unworthy
persons with them?

A. No, The wicked do not pollute the Godly at the Lords Supper.
unless they be consenting unto their wickedness; for Judas b did not defile
Christ; The wicked among the Jews did not make the ordinances of Circumcision,
of preaching in the chair of Moses, of the Passover, and of Sacrificing,
unclean unto the godly of those times; Christ himself held Communion with the
Church of the Jews, which at that time was marvilously corrupted both in
Doctrine and Discipline. a 1 Cor. 5.2, 6. with 2 Cor. 7.11. Clear in this
matter, else not, Luke 2.22, 24. Luke 3.21. John 2.13. 1 Samuel 2.16, 24. 1 Cor.
11.17, 29. to himself, etc. b Mat. 26.20, 21. He sat down with the Twelve,
Judas as he was employed in the Apostleship with the rest, so he was admitted
also with the rest unto the fellowship of all divine worship and ordinances* to
teach us, that neither is the Sacrament the worse, nor are the Comunicants
polluted; albeit some unworthy and undiscovered Hypocrites be in company with
them at the Lords table; the Pollution of the Sacrament remained with Judas
alone. The state of the visible Church is like to ten Virgins, whereof some
were wise and some foolish. Mat: 25.1. To a great house. 2 Timothy: 2.20. 1 Cor.
11.33. with 1 Cor: 3.3. 1 Cor: 10.17, 21.

Q. Then it is Christ's will that evil livers should be excomunicated, to the
end they may be brought to shame and repentance?

Who to be Excommunicated
A. It is so; scandalous persons if they obey not the admonitions of the Church
but remain obstinate, ought to be cast out and kept from the Lords Supper. Mat
18.18. John 20.23. 1 Cor: 5, 3, 4, 5, 13. 1 Timothy: 1.20. Wicked and obstinate
persons are to be banish^d from the fellowship of the faithful Authority (and
in the name) of Jesus Christ. Dispensed by the office and judgment of the
Ministers of the Gospel. consent of the Congregation. 1. Who to be admitted.
1. All that profess repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
Christ, are to be admitted if they offer themselves, as Judas; Simon Magus,
Ananias and Saphira, and those several divided parties at Corinth. (which are
for that cause called Carnal; 1 Cor. 3.3.) and surely they did judge one
another unworthy, If a company of Men should agree in some evil Action, and we
join with them then we were partakers of their evil; But when Christians
Agree to serve the Lord Jesus, if some join that do it not as they ought, they
join with us in our good, not we in their sin, or unworthiness.
and therefore did communicate apart. 1 Cor. 11.18, 21. Yet Paul bids them all
that were divided into factions, to Tarry one for another. v. 34. that so their
eating together might testify and maintain their Christian charity and unity
in the body of Christ. Neither is there any danger to the Godly by the company
of them that do thus profess Faith, Repentance, and new Obedience, though in
deed and in truth they be not such as they profess; Because in such a mixed
congregation all do join in an acknowledement that men are saved by Christ's
blood (and that is true) 2. And we all join in profession of Christianity, and
in a solemn vow and promise of living holy and Christian lives for time to
come [and that we may do lawfully, and sincerely with them who are not
sincere, but mere outside professors.] And therefore such mixture of good and
bad in that ordinance, can be no sufficient warrant and ground, either for the
Minister to refuse to do his office, or for the people to refuse to partake of
this Ordinance. 2. Who should forbear to come.
2. Howbeit all carnal persons who are conscious to themselves of their
ignorance, or hypocrisy, that they are not in truth what they seem to be, or
are privy to themselves of living in any sin, ought in good conscience to keep
themselves back from the Lords table. 3. Who must be kept back.
3. And all such Persons as are grossly ignorant of Christ, or else are guilty
of gross errors, and scandelous sins, inconsistent with Faith and Repentance,
they ought to be kept back by the discipline of the Church.

Q. Thus of the public; Are there any private helps of a Christians
conversation and communion with God?

A. Yes, Many, as private reading, prayer, self-examination, calling our ways
to account, trials of the grounds of our hopes, private fasting and
humiliation, holy medidation, of the worth of things heavenly, and the vanity
of things earthly, of the Attributes of God, of promises, etc. also private
admonitions, and comforting one of another. Holy resolutions against the
corruption of the times, of our own hearts, etc.

AN APPENDIX,
Containing and Explication of certain Theological Terms and Phrase,
frequently used in English Books and Sermons, and be either not mentioned, or
not sufficiently explained in the foregoing Treatise.

GRACE, signifies in Scripture two things: 1. Gods free favor and love to
man: 2. The effects thereof in us; thus faith is a grace, etc.

Predestination, is the eternal purpose of God touching the everlasting state
of men, wereby of his own free will he ordains some to Salvation, and others
to destruction.

Election in the eternal purpose of God, whereby, according to the counsel of
his own will, he chooses some to salvation out of the corupted mass of
Mankind; not because he foresaw they were or would be better then otners, but
because it so pleased him; to the praise of his rich grace.

Reprobation is the like eternal purpose of God, whereby he leaves others in
their sins, to perish for ever; to the praise of his glorious justice.

Vocation signifies that work of grace whereby God calls his elect out of
their sins, to receive the Gospel, that is, unto faith and repentance.

Conversion signifies Gods turning of a sinner from darkness to light, from
sin to grace, from love of the world to love of God, from carelessness to
conscience of pleasing God.

Justification signifies Gods gracious act accepting of a sinner into his
favor, not imputing unto him his sins, in and for the righteousness and
death of Christ: or it is Gods gracious act whereby he reconcileth an humbled
sinner to himself, forgiving his sins freeely and fully for Christ's sake.

Regeneration is the begetting of a spiritual life of grace in the soul, by
the seed of Gods word received into the heart, and made effectual by the holy
Ghost, whereby we are become new Creatures, to bring forth fruit unto God, the
fruits of holiness and righteousness.

Sanctification signifies the clensing of our Natures: and it is the grace of
God infused into our hearts, whereby of unholy people we are made holy in our
thoughts, words and actions.

Adoption signifies Gods making Sons of us that were not Sons before: or it is
the translation of Sinners from a servile condition under sin and Satan, to
be the Sons of God, in and with Christ to enjoy the privileges and
inheritance of Sons.

Glorification signifies the state of Gods children in heaven.

Redemtion signifies Christ's delivering of our Souls from sin and wrath by
paying of a price, even the price of his blood for us.

Mediation signifies that gracious work of Christ setting himself between God
and us, making peace, and procuring our acceptance with his father, both of
our persons and actions.

Propitiation signifies the removing of wrath, and making of God favorable to
us in Christ.

Christ's active obedience signifies his perfect fulfilling of the Law for us.

Christ's passive obedience is his suffering of death, and undergoing of the
punishment due to our sins: by both which he satisfied the justice of God in
our behalf, being put under the Law, that he might save them that were under
the Law.

By the Law is meant the covenant of Works, the way and offer of salvation to
them that perfectly fulfill the Law of God in their own persons.

By the Gospel is meant the covenant of Grace, that is, Gods gracious purpose
and promise of bringing men to salvation by Jesus Christ.

The Old Testament is the doctrine of salvation through Christ, taught by Moses
and the Prophets, and set forth under certain figures and ceremonies, shadowing
forth the death of Christ, and the benefits of Christ, who was then to come.

The New Testament is the same Doctrine of salvation by Christ, taught nakedly,
without such figures and shadows, showing expressly the death and benefits of
Christ already come, and exhibited in the flesh.

Leveticall we mean any Ordinance about Gods public worship, delivered by
Moses, till the Messiah should come.

By Legal we understand that which the Law of Moses does require, as legal
righteousness is such a complete righteousness in every circumstance as the Law
does require.

By Evangelicall, we understand that which the Gospel does require and accept:
as Evangelicall righteousness is the righteousness of the Mediator accepted
on our behalf.

Legal perfection is to be free from sin in every kind and degree thereof.

Evangelicall perfection is to be free from guile and hypocrisy, when in
uprightness of heart we frame our selves to the whole will of God.

Legal repentance is a sorrow for sin arising from fear of wrath: such a
sorrow the Law can work.

Evangelicall repentance is such a sorrow for sin as arises from love of God,
and hatred of sin, which the Spirit of Adoption begets in us, because we
displease our Father, and dishonor our God.

By the Image of God in men, is meant, to be like God in holiness and
righteousness.

By the fall of man is meant the first sin of Adam and Eve, whereby they fell
from that state of holiness, and happiness, wherein they were at first
created, and plunged themselves and their posterity into sin and misery.

By Flesh in Scripture is meant the unregenerate heart of man, and that
remainder of corruption which is found even in regenerate persons, whereby they
are hindered from doing the good they would.

By Spirit is meant the new Man, the renewed he^rt and soul of Man which
opposes it self against all sin.

When we speak of a natural Man and of the state of Nature, we do not mean
Heathens or Fools, but all, even the best and wisest among Christians, that be
not regenerate and effectually called; forasmuch as they be in no better case
then Heathens.

When we speak of a Spiritual Man, we mean one that is regenerate and led by
the Spirit of God, minding Spiritual things in the first place, and temporal
things in a spiritual manner.

When we speak of a Carnal Man, we mean them that are led by Carnal and
corrupt Principles and do follow after Earthly things with greatest
earnestness and delight; and Spiritual things in a formal and careless
manner.

A Sincere Christian is one that walks with God and to God uprightly, making
conscience of every duty, and of every sin, according to that measure of
knowledge which he has received, and does not hide his eyes from any part of
Gods will, neither is willingly ignorant of any part of his duty.

An Hypocrite, in Scripture, is not one that does profess Religion, and
separate himself from the sins of others; but it is any one that knows
Truth, and does not obey it sincerely and universally; but is partial, and
halting with God in points of obedience: approving himself to man, rather then
to God.

By Civil honesty, which we teach cannot bring men to heaven, we do not
condemn justice and honesty in men's dealings; But we mean mere civil honest
men, that is, deluded, and formal Christians, who being free from gross sins,
and outwardly conformed to good orders, do flatter themselves in a moral
righteousness without faith, or any assurance of their particular interest in
Christ, or any endeavor to attain thereunto.

By Common Graces, we mean such gifts of Gods spirit as be common to the elect
and reprobate, as gifts of Miracles, of Prophesying, and other abilities to
spiritual duties.

By Saving Graces we mean the special work and fruits of the renewing Spirit
which whosoever has received, is undoubtedly saved.

By Restraining Grace we mean that power of Gods word on the conscience,
whereby men do outwardly forbear evil, though they do not inwardly hate it.

Humiliation is the wounding, and casting down of the conscience with fear,
in a sense and apprehension of the curse of God belonging to our sinful state,
all former hopes of being in Gods favor and in a good case; being now
discovered to be utterly false and unsound.

Self-denial signifies the renouncing of our own righteousness and
worthiness as also our own desires, reasons, wits, wills, and dearest
contentments for Christ's and the Gospells sake, that so we may preserve faith
and a good conscience according to the rule of the words whatsoever cross
shall happen to us in so doing.

Spiritual Combat is the struggling between the flesh and the Spirit, between
Grace and Corruption, in the same faculties of the soul of a regenerate person,
our new nature inclining us to good, and to please God, our corruption
inclining to carnal contentments.

By the World, unto which we must be crucified, we mean the sinful courses,
opinions, ways, and fashions of the world.

Lust in any evil motion and inordinate desire of the soul after any thing;
as after riches, honor, revenge, food, preferment; therefore covetousness is
Lust, and so is pride, anger, and other motions of the flesh.

Concupiscence signifies the habitual indisposition of the heart to that which
is good and its pronenesse to that which is evil; as also every evil motion
of the heart that swerves from the Law of God: All this is called evil
Concupiscence.

By Principles and Principled, we mean the rules and grounds wherewith men are
seasoned and guided in their course; as carnal Principles are carnal grounds
and rules; spiritual Principles are spiritual considerations moving and
guiding in a business.

Heretic is one that departs from the true Faith; and obstinatly cleaves to
error in Doctrine.

Shismatick is one that unnecessarily makes or causes others to make a
separation from any true and found Church to the disturbance of the outward
established peace thereof.

By Will Worship we mean any thing that is brought into Religion, and made
matter of conscience by man's device or authority without warrant from the word
of God By Superstition we mean the ascribing of Holiness, or any spiritual
and supernatural virtue, to any creature, gesture, place, day, words, or
actions which is not given to the said creature by Creation or divine
institution.

When we commend Good works we mean not only the works of charity and
outward pomp but the whole course of obedience in our thoughts, words, and
actions as the word of God requires of us.

By Christian Liberty we mean not a liberty to sin, as if we might sin more
freely and safely because of Christ's death; but we mean that liberty which
Christ has obtained to us against the bondage of the Law, condemning all that
do not fulfill it: And also our freedom from the ceremonies of Moses Law, and
from all human ordinances, so that they do not bind, in conscience.

Perseverance signifies a constancy and cotinuance in faith and obedience to
our end.

Apectacy is a total and final departure from the faith once professed.

Backsliding is a falling again into our old sins for a time, out of which
we recover through Gods grace, being renewed again by repentance.

By Spiritual Desertions we mean that trouble of mind, which arises from
loss of assurance, and feeling of Gods favor; occasioned usually by our
backsliding in to some sin or great carelessenesse and unevenness in our
walking with God.

By Temptations we mean sometimes allurements to sin, and sometimes the
exercise of our faith, wherein Satan labors to question our Sonship and
interest in Christ: This kind of Temptation is usually called distress of
mind.

Despair is finally to doubt of Gods favor and mercy, refusing to rest on it.

Presumption is a conceit that we are in good case when we have no solid
grounds to think so; it is also a venturing to practice this or that without
warrant of Gods word.

Assurance is the well grounded peace of conscience awakened and enlightened,
and quieted upon good grounds that his sins be forgiven in Christ Jesus.

When we pray that God would Sanctify any of his dealings to us (as crosses,
afflictions, preferments, deliverances, or any other outward mercy) we pray
that God would give grace with outward mercies, holy wisdom, and gracious
hearts to make right use of them, that in all things we may be brought nearer
to God in the exercise of faith, humility, thankfulness and better obedience
for time to come.

Laus Deo.
TO THE READER.
THe foregoing TREATISE (Christian Reader) entitled Principles of Faith and
good Conscience, is so called, because it does contain, not only points of
Faith, and positive Truths touching the chief Heads of Religion, but also the
most material points of Practical Divinity, (properly so called,) that is, to
show the work of Grace in the Conversion of a sinner, and in the hearts of them
that be converted, and how a Christian may judge of his spiritual estate to
Godward. As in cap: 4. 5. 8. 13. 14. 18. etc.
I have had some thoughts of publishing a just Treatise touching the state of
Nature, and of Grace, the Translation of a sinner from the state of Nature to
the state of Grace, from death to life, together with the Causes, Order, and
effects thererf; And this may be done, if God be pleased to give me Life,
Liberty, and Peace to the Church. In the mean time, Accept, and make use of
this short Discourse intended for the good of the Ignorant, and the comfort of
weak Christians, [The marks of Gods Children.] Blessed are the Pure in heart
-- Blessed is the man, in whose spirit there is no Guile, so says the spirit,
Psalm. 32.2. and Mat. 5.8.

Marks of Gods children drawn out of Gods word.
Of saving knowledge.
Q. WHat is the first Mark of a Child of God?

A. Saving knowledge is a mark whereby Gods Children may be known from all
others. John 17.3. 1. Mark
This is life eternal to know thee, the only true God, and whom thou have sent
Jesus Christ.

Q. What be the properties of saving knowledge?

A. They be four. The trial of it.
1. Saving knowledge makes us to see our own Ignorances, and strayings. Prove.
9.10, 12. Ephesians. 5.8, 13. Romans 7.9. Psalm. 119.130. Pro. 20.27.

Q. What is the second property of saving knowledge?

A. It makes a man ashamed to do evil; and vile in his own eyes. Ephesians. 5.8,
12. 1 These. 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Romans 6.21. Ier. 31.19.

Q. What Is the third property of saving knowledge?

A. It is a guiding light, especially in those things that belong to our own
Peace and duty. Psalm. 119.105. Romans 2.20, 21. Mat. 7.5.

Q. What Is the fourth sign of saving knowledge?

A. It is not an idle, but a working knowledge, making a man to abstain from
evil, and exercise himself in that which is good. 2 Pet. 2.20. Jer. 22.16.
Ps. 119.104. Job. 28.28. Hos. 8.1, 2.

much, and yet are not bettered by their knowledge in Holiness and Christian
life; Also they that by their knowledge can guide others, and yet do not take
to heart the thing that belong to their own peace and duty, their knowledge is
but vain: Romans 2.20, 21. Romans 1.18. 2 Timothy 3.5. Lastly all such persons as be
in darkness and perceive it not; All such are blind, and miserable, and
wretched, and naked, and think that they have need of Nothing, when as indeed
they have nothing of Grace or Heaven; All such people are without knowledge,
and therefore without God in the world: Rev. 3.17. Gal. 6.3. Jer. 6.15.

Q. Whats's a second mark of Gods children? 2. Mark.


A. All Gods children are taught of God? Ioh. 6.45. Esaias 54.13.

Q. How do you know your self taught of God?

A. 1. The trial*
Because I am made to know things a above my Nature and to b love and embrace
things which be contrary to my Nature a Mat. 13.11. 1 Cor. 1.21. with 1 Cor.
2.12. Ephesians. 1.17, 18. b Mar. 8.34, 35. Luck. 14.26, 27.

Q. How secondly do you know it?

new judgment of men and things, I can look upon sin and duty, with such eyes
as Christ beholds them with, that is, I look upon sin, as upon a Toad or
Serpent to avoid it; And upon duty with a loving eye. Ezekiel. 11.19. Heb. 8.10,
11.

Then it follows, that they who know no more then Nature can teach them, and
will believe no more then Reason can comprehend: Also all such persons as do
err in their hearts, and say within themselves, I desire not to know my sin,
or duty, I love not to obey. Heb. 3.10. Such as Hate to be reformed. Ps. 50.17.
And love darkness rather then light. Joh. 3. 19. Such as have not Gods LaW
written in their hearts. Heb. 8.10. Ier. 32, 40. They that are pleased with
sin, and displeased with duty; All such persons are not as yet Taught of God. 1
Ioh. 5.3.

Of the Love of God.
Q. What Is a third mark of Gods child.

3. Mark.
A. All Gods children do love God with all their hearts; if any man love God,
the same is loved and approved of God. 1 Cor: 8.3. Mat. 22.37.

Q. How do you know that you love God withal your heart?

The trial.
A. By four things. 1. When the heart is not divided between Two, he has not
Two to please: God has the whole soul. Esaias 8.12, 13. Luk 16 13. Number. 14.24.

Q. How secondly may it be known that you love God with all your heart?

A. When I love God above all men, and all things: All men and all things must
be loved in God, and for God, but nothing against God, nor above God. Mat.
10.37. 1 Samuel 2.29. Number, 24.11. Exodus 32.32.

Q How thirdly may it be known?

A When I strive to Honor and serve Him to the very utmost and best I can, and
not as little as we can. 1 Chronicles. 13.8. 1 Chronicles. 29.17. Act. 20.24. 2 Kings
23.25. Mar. 12.42, 43, 44.

Q. How Fourthly may this be known?

A. This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and his
Commandments are not grievous unto us. 1 John 5.3. Joh. 14.15, 21. Joh 15.24. 1 John 3.4, 5.

all their hearts, whose hears are divided between God and Men, between God and
profit, between God and credit, or any other earthly thing: Much less do they
love God aright, who set up the love of men, the love of themselves, the love
of riches, Honor, etc. above the love of God, above the will of God, above the
Glory of God, or above the Commandments of God. Lastly they do not love God
aright, who serve him as little as they can, something they will do, just so
much as they think will serve the turn, but their hearts are not lifted up in
Gods service. 2 Chronicles. 17.6. They do not stir up themselves, nor lay on
their Tallents to the honor of God: whereas we must be zealous for Gods cause
against sin and wickedness, zealous for Gods Truth against error Iud. v. 3.
Earnestly contend for the faith against Sects and Heresies whatsoever.

A Christian must love God for Himself, for those excellencies and perfections
of Goodness, Mercy, Grace, Holiness Truth, etc. that be in God: We must not
love God only for his gifts, or for our profits sake; But as a child loves his
Father though he be but poor, and as a man loves his Wife, better then her
Portion, so must we love God. Ps. 119.57. Psalm. 4.6, 7. Psalm. 73.25. There is
none in Heaven or Earth that I desire in comparison of thee.

Of Zeal for God.
Q. Show a fourth mark of Gods child?

4. Mark.
A. Gods child is zealous for God, for his Truth, and Glory. Because thou art
neither hot, nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth; Be zealus therefore
and repent. Rev. 3.16, 19. 2 Cor. 7.11. Act. 17.16. 2 Pet. 2.8.

Q. You have said that they that love God, must be zealous for God; Tell me
what be properties of true zeal?

A. They be three. 1. True zeal must be exercised always in a good matter,
The trial.
and without respect to the eye of man. Gal. 4. 18. 1 King. 9.10. Iud: v. 3.
Luke 13.15.

Q. What secondly, is the property of true zeal?

A. True zeal burns inward, our own sins and corruptions first and most. Mat.
7.4.

Q. What Is the third property of true zeal?

A. True zeal is accompanied with meekness, justice, mercy: and many other
graces. Jam. 3.16. Luke 9.54, 55: Luke 13.15.

Then it follows, that all such persons as in their zeal do forget to show
mercy, justice and Truth, as Saul did 2 Samuel 21.2. and as Paul did Act. 26.9,
11. And they which can be earnest against other men's sins, and favorable
toward their own; as Romans 2.1, 22. And lastly they that be earnest and zealous
in a Trifle, or in a groundless cause, as the false teachers at Galatia were,
Gal. 4.17. Such zeal does not commend them unto God?

Of love to a Christian for Gods sake.
Q. What is a fifth Mark of Gods children? 5. Mark*


A. By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if you have love one
to another: John 13.35. 1 John 3.14. 1 John 5.1.

Q. How may it appear that you love a Christian because he is borne of God, or
because he is a Disciple?

A. By four signs. 1. By this we know that we love the Children of God, when
we love God, The trial.
and keep his Commandments, 1 John 5.2. That is, we love Gods children because
we love God first: Our love to them must proceed from our loving of God, seeing
we love them for Gods sake.

Q. How Secondly may Christian love be discerned?

A. When you love a Disciple, in the Name of a Disciple, and a righteous man,
in the Name of a righteous man, that is, because they belong to God, and
because of the Image of God in them: Mat. 10.41, 42. 2 Ioh. v. 1, 2.

Q. How thirdly is Christian love evidenced?

A. When you love a Christian more for the Image of God in him, then for
Kindreds, or profits sake. Among your children, or Neighbors, or Friends and
acquaintance, you will love them best and most, in whom you percieve the Grace
of God to shine. Gal. 6.10.

Q. How Fourthly.

A. If you have true love, you will do righteous things to your Brother; But
he that does not righteousness, is not of God neither he that loves not his
brethren. 1 John 3.10, 18.

Cor: 6.8.) And they that do like their Children, or Neighbors, or Servants,
or acquaintance, the worse for their goodness sake, And lastly they that are
Partial in their love, and will embrace only such of the Godly, as be of their
own side and opinion, but can scorn and abuse others every jot as Godly, if
they differ from them; then, I say, it appears, they do not love them in the
Name of a Disciple, nor in the Name of a righteous man; But they love
themselves, their own ends and Fancies in them, and not Christ in them, nor
the Image of God in them. We must love where God loves, God loves all his
Children of what side soever they be, though not their sins and Failings, and
so must we do Luke 9.49, 50. Rom: 14.3, 6. Mark: 9 38, 39. The weak and the
strong Christian, they were both of them true fearers of God: Wicked men that
are yet in the flesh, they hate and dislike Godliness where ever they see it,
and he that is born after the spirit, loves godliness where ever he sees it.

Of Hungring and thirsting after Christ, and His Grace.
Q. Show a sixth mark of a child of God?

A. They are blessed that hunger and thirst after Christ, 6. Mark.
and after the graces of his spirit. Mat. 5.6. Es. 55.1. Rev. 22.17.

Q. What be the signs whereby spiriall desires after Christ may be discerned
from natural desires?

A. They be four. 1. If your souls do indeed hunger and thirst after Christ,
The trial.
and his righteousness, then you will desire him for spiritual ends and uses;
as for Reconciliation with God, for sanctification, for spiritual Healing and
cleansing of your souls; as your spiritual Physician: Mat. 9.12. Mar. 1.10.
Luk: 18.41. Ps. 51.1, 2, 9, 10. Carnal people can desire mercy, but not Grace:
they desire Happiness, but care not for Holiness; they can desire Christ as a
Priest to save them, not as a King to Rule in them.

Q. What is a second sign of spiritual desires or hungering after Christ?

A. If you do indeed thirst after Christ, you will be restless and
unsatisfied till you find him: Nothing but Christ can content the spiritual
appetite and desires of the soul: Nothing but Christ can still the cry, and
quiet the call of conscience. Give a hungering soul Gold, or preferment, or
Pleasures etc. These things cannot satisfy a spiritual desire: the soul must
have Christ, or nothing: spiritual desires are restless desires, till they
can enjoy the things they want: Ps. 143.6. Can. 5.4, 8. Ps. 42.1, 2.

Q. What Is a third sign of spiritual desire after Christ?

A. Spiritual hunger and thirst is a conquering desire, it makes the soul to
prize Jesus Christ upon any terms: the thirsty soul must have Christ, what ere
it cost: As the Egyptians said to Joseph, Buy us and our land for Bread ( Genesis
47.19.) and we will be servants unto Pharaoh: so to the hungery soul, every
bitter thing is sweet; Christ is welcome upon any terms. Mat. 16.25. Mat.
13.44, 46. Mat. 19.21, 22.

Q. Wha'ts a Fourth sign of spiritual desire after Christ?

A. Spiritual hunger and thirst is a laboring desire; the Hungry soul will
take any pains for the bread and water of life. It does not rest in wishing,
but it will strive and seek, and knock: True desire puts forth it self in
endeavourings Can. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. Psalm. 63.1.2. Spiritual desires are not lazy,
cold, heartlesse wishes.

Then if you take little Pains to get Grace, and the assurance of Christ's
love, or if you prize any thing more then Christ and his Grace and favor, or
if your minds be quieted without Christ, and cured by false Remedies, as by
worldly Counsels, worldly Pleasures, or by forgetting your sins, etc. Lastly if
you desire Christ for natural ends, as for mercy, and not also for Grace and
Holy Communion with him, then I say you did never truly Hunger and Thirst after
Christ, and his righteousness: you have had perhaps some light, vanishing
wishes for Heaven, but never any sound, and settled desires. Luke 14.15, 18.
Mat. 19.21, 22.

Of Christ in us.
Q. What is a Seventh Mark of one that is the Child of God?

A. If any one be Christ's, then Christ is in you, and abides in you: Romans 8.9,
10. 2 Cor. 13.5. Ephesians. 3.17.

Q. How will you know that Christ is in you?

A. Two manner of ways. 1, The trial.
If Christ be in you, you will be fashioned like unto Christ, you will be Holy
members of that holy Head, and living members of that living Head. Romans 8.10.
If Christ be in you the body of sin is dead, and the spirit is life because of
righteousness; you cannot be dead members of a living head, nor unholy members
of an holy head: A true Christian is the very Picture of Christ, Christ is
fashioned in him. Gal. 4.19. Ephesians. 4.22, 24. Joh. 2.6.

Q. Say the same in other words?

A. If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature, 2 Cor. 5 17.

Q. How secondly, will you know whether Christ be in you or not?

A. Hereby we know that he abides in us, by the spi^^t which he has given us.
1 Ioh 3.24.

Romans 8.9. Also If you be not like unto Christ if you walk contrary unto him,
and his example in the Family, Church, or State, it is because Christ is not in
you of a Truth: for he that says, He abides in him, ought himself also to
walk, even as Christ walked. 1 Ioh. 2.6. 1 Pet. 1.15. Phil. 3.18.

Of the spirit of Christ in us.
Q. Show an Eight mark of a child of God?

8. Mark.
A. Because you are sons, God has given the spirit of his son into your hearts,
whereby ye cry Abba, Father. Gal. 4.6. Rom, 8.9, 11.

Q. But how will you know that you have the spirit of Christ in you?

The trial.
A. Three ways. 1. Because it is unto me a spirit of illumination: It begets
in me spiritual senses, and understanding by which I know him that is True; it
enableth me to discern things that differ: As the Ear tries words; and the
Mouth tastes meat, Job. 12.11. ^^ does the spirit of Christ give us a
discerning taste, a discerning heart, and ear; It makes us able to discern
light from darkness, sweet from sower; It makes us to Relish and savor the
things that be of God. John 10.4, 5, 27. with Ioh. 14.17. 1 John 2.19, 20, 26,
27. 1 Cor. 2.14.

Q. How secondly will you know it?

A. Because it is unto me a spirit of Sanctification; for the spirit of
Adoption, whereby we call God Father, is always in us, and to us a spirit of
sanctification, It is a spirit of Burning to consume Lusts, and a spirit of
Quikning to newness of life. 1 Cor: 6.11. Gal: 5.24. Rom: 8.10, 13.

Q. How, thirdly, will you know it?

A. By the Fruits of the spirit, which are these, Love, Joy, Peace, Long
suffering, Gentlnesse, Goodness, Faithfulness, Meekness, Temperance, etc.
Gal: 5.22, 23. Ephesians: 5.9.

Then it follows that all such persons as walk in the flesh, and show forth
the fruits of it, which are these, Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
laciviousnesse, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, Wrath,
seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revilings, etc. Also all
such persons as have not received the spirit of Christ to enlighten their
Minds, make them wise to discern precious from vile. -- And to purify their
^earts and lives: All such persons as do ^ot show forth the fruits of the
spirit in their conversation* they are all of them without Christ because they
be void of ^is spirit, and the fruits thereof.

Of Christ Ruling in us.
Q Show a Ninth marks of one that is the child of God?

6. Mark.
A. All that have Christ for their Savior, must take him also for their Lord
and King to rule in their hearts: Christ is the King of Saints. Luke 19.27.
Rev. 15.3.

Q. How do you know your self to be a Subject of Christ's Kingdom?

A. 1. Every Subject of Christ's Kingdom is a child of light, and he is
careful to walk in the light. 1 John: 1.6, 7. 1 John 2.6. Satan's Kingdom is a
Kingdom of darkness; Christ's Kingdom is a Kingdom of light.

Q. How, secondly, may it be known?

A. Every Subject of Christ's Kingdom, will yield obedience to the Laws. and
Mind of Christ. Job: 15.14. Mal: 1.6, 8.

Q. How Thirdly may it be known?

A. I know that Christ is my King, and I his Subject, by the Victory I have
over my own sins; I also am made a spiritual King, I dare not hold up any
spiritual weapon against Christ, nor against his word, nor on the behalf of
any sin whatsoever, and in whomsoever. 2 Cor. 10.5. Romans 6.17, 18.

Power of darkness, and under the command of sin, and they that do not yield
universal obedience and subjection to the Laws and will of Christ, all such
persons do not belong to Christ's Kingdom of Grace, and therefore shall never
reign with him in glory.

Of Being led by the Spirit of Christ.
Q Give a tenth mark of a child of God?

A. As Many as are led by the spirit of God, 10. Mar.
they are the sons of God. Romans 8.14.

Q. How will you know that you be led by the spirit of God?

A. Three ways. 1. Because I am under the command of the spirit: The trial.
I will not grieve the spirit of God, but cherish it, and suffer my self to be
guided by it; as Soldiers are by their Captain, and Commanders, who say to
one, do this and he does it, to another do that, and he does it, so is the
Christian under the Conduct and command of the spirit to follow it, even
against Nature, and Carnal reason; as for example, to love ones enemy, to pray
for them that dispightfully use us, to bless them that curse us, etc. Ephesians.
4.30. Romans 8.13.

Q. How secondly will you know it?

A. Because the Considerations and Motives which sway my judgment and choice
in any business, are spiritual: As ( If I were to give my voice in the
election of a Minister) if I cast about how I may pleasure a friend or kinsman,
or what I shall get or loose by this or that way, then it is clear, you are led
by a carnal spirit because the consideration^ which sway, and prevail with me
are merely polytick and worldly: But if you consider who is most likely to win
souls to God, to advance his Truth and Gospel, etc. then are you in that
business led by the spirt, because the considerations moving you, are
spiritual. When there is a conflict between Nature and Grace, the spirit of
God will sway you for gracious purposes against the pleadings of flesh and
blood. Gal. 1.16. Ephesians. 4.16. Heb. 11.24, 25.

Q. How thirdly will you know it?

A. Because I am led by a True Gods spirit does not lead us blindfold, but it
shows us, and leads us in the ways of God.
light, and a straight rule, Gods spirit does never lead one blindly, nor by a
false Rule* Gods spirit is not like to an Ignis fatuus, to lead into by-pathes
of error and mischief, Gods spirit it guides us in the path of Gods word, Gods
spirit and Gods word are ever joined together. Es. 29.18. Ps. 25.5, 9. Ps.
27.11. Ps. 119.35. Ioh. 16.13. Esa. 59.21. Prove. ^.23.

bypath of error, and in the broad paths of destruction and unpapinesse,
(following the ways of unrighteousness, Pride, Covetousness Envy, Murder,
Lying, Covenant-breakers, perjured persons, without natural affection,
implacable, unmercifull, murderers of Fathers, Lawless, disobedient, etc.)
and yet say that they are led by the spirit of God, This is the spirit of your
Father the devil, and not the spirit of God. 1 Timothy 1.9, 10, Romans 1.30, 31. 2 Timothy 3.2, 3, 4. Ioh. 8.44.

Also they that are swayed by worldly considerations, by selfe-ends and
interests, they that walk by cruked rules, and dark lights, and are not afraid
to quench the spirit of God, and to check good motions of of the spirit, to
follow their own Imaginations, etc. Such persons are not led by the spirit, of
God, they are not under the command and conduct of the holy spirit.

Of the spirit of Truth and Error.
Q. Show an eleventh mark of Gods children?

A. Gods children are led by his spirit into all saving Truth, 11. Mar.
so that they cannot damnably err, or be deceived. Joh. 16.18. Mat. 24.24. 2 Timothy 2.19. 1 John 2.27.

Q. How shall we know the spirit of Truth from the spirit of error?

The trial.
A. By three things. 1. He that is of God Hears us; He that is not of God,
hears us not, hereby know we the spirit of Truth, and the spirit of error. 1
Ioh. 4.6. with John 8.47. He that is of God, hears Gods words delivered by
the mouth of his Ambassadors; hence it is clear, that it is a false spirit,
that says, ye need not hear us, for my sheep hear my voice, speaking in my
servants to the end of the world. Joh. 10.27. with Luke 10.16. He that
despises you, despises me. The Spirit of God never persuades any man to
forsake the public ordinances. Mat. 10.41. but to receive and honor a
Prophet in the name of a Prophet. 1 These. 5.12, 13.

Q. How Secondly, may the spirit of error, or a false Prophet be known?

A. You shall know them by their fruits, that is by the Fruit of their
doctrine, for if their doctrines tend to loosnesse, or Libertinisme, or to
withdraw from duty, or to overthrow what God has established, and to dissolve
the Bonds of Order, Peace, Unity, Obedience to Lawful Superiors, or to the
overthrowing of the Common Rules of Right and Wrong which are established by
Scripture and wholesome Laws, for certain such teachers are not of God; the
reason is, because Gods spirit does never cross it self, we must believe no
spirit against the voice of the public spirit, which speaks in the
Scriptures. 2 Pet. 1.21. Mat. 7.15, 16.

Q. How thirdly, may the spirit of Error be discerned?

A. If their Doctrines and Teaching do agree with the form of sound words,
and with the Principles of the Christian faith once delivered to the Saints (as
with the Articles of the Creed, the Confessions of Faith of other reformed
Churches, and the purest Ages) then is to be suspected for its Novelty and
singularity, yea to be rejected as false; because Truth will still Agree with
Truth, and Light with Light. But whatsoever is contrary to light, is darkness
2 Timothy 1.13. with 1 Timothy 6.3, 4. 2 Ioh. v. 10. 2 Cor. 11.4. Gal. 1.8. Iud. v.
3. 1 Cor. 14.32, 36, 37. Came the word of God from you? or to you only?

consent not to wholesome words, or if the fruit of that Doctrine and Teaching
be bitter, tending to Licentiousness, Rebellion, and Confusion, if any Man
shall turn you away from hearing the faithful Ministers of Jesus Christ, this
is from the spirit of Error, this favors not of the spirit of God.

Of Mortification, or Crucifying the Lusts of the Flesh.
Q. Give a twelveth mark of one that is a Child of God?

12. Mar.
A. They that are Christ's have Crucified the flesh with the Affections and
Lusts Gal. 5.24.

Q. How know you that your Lusts are crucified?

A. By three things. 1. If sin be crucified in you, The trial.
then your corruptions will be a burden to you, and you will gladly be rid of
them, As when the Foot or any other member of the Body is dead and Gangrened,
we are willing to have them cut off, though as long as they were sound and
alive, we did cherist them: so though formerly you did cherish your Lusts, yet
when they are mortified, and crucified, you will cut them off, and cast them
from you, yea though it be a right hand, or eye. Mat. 5.29, 30. Romans 7.24. Gal.
5.17.

Q. How, Secondly, may this be known?

A. If your Lusts be mortified, then you will take part with the word of God
against your selves, against your dearest sins, you can welcome a reproof,
even when it cuts to the quick, and meets with your inmost corruptions. Ps.
141.5. 2 Samuel 12.13. 1 Samuel 3.13, 18.

Q. How; Thirdly, may this be known?

A. If sin be dead, and the Flesh crucified, then you will not mind the things
of the flesh, nor obey it is the lustings and motions of it. Romans 8.5. Romans
6.12, 12, 13, 22. Romans 13.14.

provision for the flesh to fulfill the lustings of it; Also such persons as
are unwilling to part with their deer sins, yea fret at the word that reproves
them and fall out with the Minister of God, instead of failing out with their
own sins, All such persons have not as yet crucified the flesh with its
affections.

Of Obedience and Sanctification.
Q. Show a thirteenth mark of Gods Children?

A. Sound, and sincere obedience is a mark whereby Gods people may be known
from all others. 13. Mar.
Romans 6.16, 17, 1. Joh. 3.9. 1 Pet 1.2. Ps. 15.2. 1 Chronicles. 26.17.

Q. What be the signs and properties of a sincere and upright Christian?

A. They be Five. 1. It is a sign of an upright heart, The trial.
when I make conscience of secret sins, and secret duties, Mat. 23.25, 26, 27,
28. Ps. 18.21, 22, 23.

Q. What is a second sign of an upright heart?

A. When I strive against Hypocrisy, I would not be an Hypocrite. Job. 34.32.
Ps. 139 23, 24.

Q. What Is a third sign of sincere obedience.

A. When our obedience is Universal, and Regulated, making greatest Conscience
of the greatest and waightiest matters of the Law and will of God: We must not
stick at lesser matters, and swallow greater. Mat. 23.23. Ps. 119.6, 104. Mat.
5.20.

Q. What Is a fourth sign of an upright heart in point of obedience?

A. The sincere heart will strive to do all things, not as pleasing men but
God, which tries the heart: The servant of Christ must not be a Man pleaser. 2
These. 2.4. Ga. 1.10. Ioh. 8.29.

Q. Yea but who is a man-pleaser?

A, 1. If ye confer with flesh and blood, and consult with self ends and
interest, when your duty lies before you, whether you were best to do it or
not, then you are not upright before God: A sound Christian must be through for
God, still approving our selves to God through good and ill report, through
Plenty and want, through honor and dishonor, etc. 2 Cor. 6.4.8. Gal: 1.6.

Q. What, Secondly, is a sign of an hyhocriticall Man-pleaser.

A. If you fear more to offend a Man then to offend God, it is because the
heart is not upright before God. Es. 15.7, 12, 13. Job. 32.21, 22. Luke 12.1,
2, 4, 6.

Q. What is a Fifth and last sign of an upright heart?

A. If you will be sincere, you must not seek your own glory, but the glorly of
him that sent you, and imployes you: Ioh: 3.29, 30. Ioh: 7.18. He that seeks
his glory that sent him, the same is True.

so order and alter their opinions, and Principles, as may exalt themselves,
and humor times, and serve Turns -- Also they that strain at a Gnat and
swallow a Camel, that is, stick at a circumstance or Ceremony, and swallow
greater matters of the Law, [To busy ones self; and strive to be expert and
cunning in those truths which concern ceremony and matter of Church
discipline, and yet neglect matters of Faith Repentance, Mortification, and new
Obedience, is a shrewd sign of hypocrisy.] Lastly, they that can take liberty
to secret sins, and study to hide their sins, regarding more the eye of man,
then the eye of God, such people are nor sound in their obedince.

Of Sanctification, How it differs from civil Honesty.
Q. Show a fourteenth mark of Gods children?

A. All Gods elect are given to Christ as his peculiar ones to be Redeemed,
Sanctified, and fitted for Glory. Ioh. 17.6, 8. Col. 1.12, 13. 2 These. 2.13.
Heb. 12.14. Ioh: 3.3. John 13.8. Gal. 6.6.

Q. Wherein does sanctification and the true change of a Christian consist?
wherein does it excel the highest pitch of the best moralized Hypocrite, and
formalist in the World? The trial.


A. In Four things. 1. In the Change it self, Sanctification is not only an
accidental outward change of the Actions (as of the Sow that is washed. Pet.
2.22.) But it is a change of the very frame and disposition of the heart, the
very nature is changed, he is made a new Creatures, Ezekiel. 36.25, 26. A new
heart will I give you, etc. A Swine that is washed, is a swine still, and his
nature is to wallow in the mire; But a sanctified person, of a swine is made a
sheep, and he hates to wallow in the mire.

Q. Wherein Secondly, does sanctification excel moral honesty?

A. In the root or seed of graces: The graces of sanctification have a root
within us, even the spirit of life which is in Jesus Christ, Romans 8.2. 1 Pet.
1.23, 24. 1 Ioh. 3.9. His seed remains in him, and our graces are the fruits
that spring up of that seed and root, Ioh. 15.16. But the seeming graces of
unregenerate and merely civilized people, they have no such root, but they are
like the Corn upon the House top, which makes a fair show, yet it has
neither root, by seed, nor fruit in the ear. Psa. 129.6, 7. Luke 8.13.

Q. Wherein, thirdly, does Sanctification excel moral Honesty?

A. The true convert does receive the word in power, and in the Holy Ghost: he
gives the word a divine power and authority over his conscience, and over his
actings: He receives the word with an honest heart, even with patience though
it cross and cast down his contentments, and particular interests: you will
not dare to resist any Truth that you hear, if you have true grace in you. 1
These. 1.5. Luke 8.15. Ps. 119.161.

Q. Wherein, fourtly, does Sanctification go beyond moral Honesty?

A. In the motives to obedience: The sanctified person, whatsoever he does, he
does it out of duty pressing the conscience, and out of love inclining the
Affection. This is the true ground, and motive of sound obedience to do a duty
out of a pure Conscience of Love and faith unfeigned, this is acceptable in Gods
sigh. 1 Timothy 1.5. Ephesians. 6.7. 1 Ioh. 5.2. whereas the Hypocrite has ever an eye
to himself: Self Ends and self respects do usually keep up the course of his
duties.

truly sanctified which cannot give the word a divine pre-eminence in their
souls to reform their hearts and lives. Ezekiel. 33.30, 32. -- Neither are they
Truly converted that can Hate one sin and allow another. Es. 58.3. Romans 2.22.
Not they which outwardly are washed but are not inwardly changed and renewed.
Nor lastly they which have some outward shows of goodness without a seed of
Grace in their hearts; seeing all the good they do, and all the evil they
forbear does proceed from restraining Grace, and outward respects moving and
setting them on work, all this does not amount to saving Grace. Observe this
for a Truth, such Christians as have no better Principles of acting and
performances then moral Education can furnish them with; Also such as content
themselves with a Negative goodness, as to say, I am no Papist, nor Thief,
nor Whoremonger, etc. Also they that can stay in such duties of the first and
second Table as may preserve the credit and esteem of Moderate, well bred,
civil honest men in the places where they live, yet are not equally careful
and conscionable of the duties of Piety and Religion, but remain all this
while unacquainted with the grounds of Faith and pure worship of God, and so
the good things they do, they do them without knowledge and conscience of, or
respect unto their injunction in the word of God; All such persons are as yet
but strangers to the life of Grace: they have not as yet exceeded, what a
Pharisee, or a Heathen may do.

Of Restraining and Renewing Grace.
Q. Show farther, for conclusion, some differences between Restraining Grace,
and Renewing Grace, 15. Mar.
for all Gods children are renewed in the spirit of their minds, The trial.
Ephesians. 4.23.

A. 1. Restraining grace, if it be only restraining, has painfulnesse in it,
and an inward discontent as the Bridle that keeps them in: Gods word is as
Cords and Bonds to them Ps: 2.3. Mark: 6.20. Herod feared John etc. But now the
heart truly renewed desires to be restrained. Job. 34.32. That which I see
not, Teach thou me. Ps 19.13. Ps: 119.32.

Q. How Secondly, may restraining Grace be known from Renewing Grace?

A. Men Merely restrained will stretch their liberty as far as they can, and
when Means of restraint be removed, they will grow loose and licentious: as
Joash, did when Jehoiada was dead. 2 King. 12.2. with the 2 Cron: 24.17, 18.

But the heart that's renewed and truly sanctified, will not do all that he
may, he will rather do less, he will deny himself some things which he might
do, especially if it be not expedient for time, and place. 1 Cor: 10.23. 1
Cor: 6.12.

Q. What Is a third difference between restraining, and renewing grace?

A. Men merely restrained do abstain from evil for fear of Wrath, or fear
of Laws, and shame in the world; or perhaps one sin keeps in another, as the
ambitious person, will avoid Drunkenness, because men of a debaucht life are
not fit for high places. So the presence of a Godly grave man, does stop the
mouth of a vain swearer, etc.

But the heart that is renewed, eschews evil because it is displeasing unto
God: He will oppose and resist sin, out of an inward Principle of Grace, and
hatred of sin, the spirit of God in them, lusts against the flesh: etc. Gal.
5.17.

General Rules of Holy life and Conversation.
1.
EVery Christian may and ought to be assured of his own Salvation. 2 Pet. 1.5,
7. 2 Cor. 13.5.

2.
No man can be assured thereof but by the word of God working spiritual and
supernatural effects, and changes in the understanding, in the Heart and
affections: By the which change our effectual vocation and future salvation is
witnessed and sealed to our consciences. Gal. 6.7, 8, 15. 1 John 1.6, 7.

3.
It is not enough for a Christian to be Baptized, to be bred up in the true
Religion, to come to Church, to cry Lord, Lord, and to live civilly, unless
thou have a sound Faith which works by love, unless thou be a New Creature:
Outward Profession will not serve the turn, nor stead thee to salvation
unless thou find inwardly those effects which the word and Sacraments
express outwardly. Romans 2.25, 28. Gal. 5.6. Jer. 9.26.

4
Repentance does not stand only in an outward forbearance of sin, but there
must be also an inward loathing and hatred of sin, together with a striving
against the corruptions of our hearts, there must be a new frame of heart, and
soul, making us to do all things. 1. By new Principles of obedience, viz.
Faith and Love 2. By new Rules, viz. the word of God: and 3d for new Ends,
namely how God may be honored, and our own final and external peace procured.

5.
A Christian must look to find in himself some singular thing which cannot be
found in an Hypocrite, nor in the best moral Man in the World. Mat. 5.47. And
seeing there are but few that shall be saved, we must strive to go the narrow
path that lead to life. Luk: 13.24, Luk: 6.33.

6.
A singular love and affection is to be borne toward all that fear God, even
because they fear God and have Gods Image on them. Mat: 10.41.

7.
A special regard must be had of the Lords day, to spend the Lords day in the
Lords work, and not in wordly pleasures or profits Es: 56.6. Es: 58.13.

8.
A precise conscience must be made of the least sin by every one that desires
to stand in the favor of God, as of lesser Oaths (by ones Faith and Troth) and
also of Idle words. Ps 119.6. Mat. 12.36. Jam. 2.10.

Sins of Omission are to be avoided as being more dangerous then sins of
Commission: The heart is wonderfully hardened and estranged from God by neglect
and omission of good duties.

10.
A Christian must exercise Justice Truth and Fidelity toward all men, even the
worst, not daring to wrong any man in the least pin, or farthing. Luk: 16.10.
Mat. 16.26. Ezekiel: 22.13, 14. Es: 63.8.

11.
A Christian must make Conscience of doing good things in a good manner, that
is with the spirit, and with the affections of the inward man, and unto
spiritual ends, viz. to please God and edify his own soul.

12.
A Christian must separate from the sinful Manners, Customs, Courses,
Fashions, and ways of the World: He must not fashion himself to the World:
All familiar society with wicked men is to be avoided. Romans 12.2. Es. 8.11, 12.
Ier. 15.19. Ps. 1.1. Ephesians. 5.7, 11. Phil. 2.15. Ps. 26.4, 5. Mat. 24.49. 2 Cor.
6.17.

13.
A Christian must neither fear nor please man against God, he must not fear
their threats, nor their reproaches, nor yet prize their favors, and so forget
God his maker. Es. 3.22. Es. 51.7, 12. Luke 1.26, 27. Heb. 12.4. Of Callings.


14.
A Christian must live in some honest calling, and be conscionable therein,
doing the duties thereof, as the work which God sets him about, And not like
the Ox or Horse, who do their work, but not in knowledge nor obedience to
God. we must do the business of our callings faithfully and obediently as
unto God, studying to honor him, and to adorn our holy profession in that
rank and place wherein God has set us.

15.
A Christian in his calling must exercise the graces of the spirit, viz.
Patience, Justice, Equity, Mercy, Truth, Faith, and Dependence on Gods promises
and providence in all his ways: our general calling of Religion and
Christianity, must be expressed in the use of our particular callings. He that
is not Godly and good in his calling, is good no where:

16.
A Christian must enter upon the duties of his calling with Prayer, craving
Gods blessing and strength, his pardon for failings, his protection in our
ways, And also his grace to preserver us from those snares and Temptations
unto which in our callings we are most subject, and exposed, whether it be unto
Idleness, frowardness, uncheerfullnesse, discontentednesse, distrustfulnesse,
covetousness, vain glory, etc.

17.
A Christian should labor to see all things in God, and from God, the fountain
of Wisdom, Power, Goodness, and Mercy; we must labor to see and meet God at
every turn. Ps: 73.13. Ps: 22.17.

18.
A Christian must never prosecute any earthly thing so as for perishing things
to lose spiritual and eternal things Mat: 16:26.

19.
Never be thou so passironately addicted to any cause, work, or end (be it
never so good) as to carry it on by unlawful means and ways, God is all
sufficient in his own ways. And it is better to suffer any evil of
affliction, then to do any evil of sin: Resolve to stick to Gods ways what
ever the issue may be.

20.
Never meddle without a warrant or calling, nor above thy strength. Ps. 131.1.
Let it never be said to thee in reproach, who art thou? Who gave thee this
Authority, or who required this at thy hand?

21.
Do the most necessary duties of thy calling first and most.

22.
Never lock up thy comfort in the Creature, but let God be thy portion and thy
exceeding great reward: (Use the World, as if thou usedest it not.)

23.
A Christians recreations must be. 1, Harmless and without offense to others,
and without scrupulosity to our own consciences. 2. They must not master us
nor overrule our affections, but our recreations must be such as we can use for
refreshments without loss of the graces, of Patience, Charity, justice, Truth,
etc. and without wasting of our precious time, and Estates: We must not
exchange better things for sports.

24.
God has given us all things plentifully to enjoy, yet with moderation; a
Christian must never eat nor drink to make the head heavy, nor the heart heavy.

25.
A Christian must not be ashamed of God and Godliness here before men; Grace
is a Christian crown.

26.
A Christian must prepare to meet with crosses and reproaches in the World for
a good conscience sake, and yet not be discouraged thereby. Es: 8.18. Gal.
4.29. Ps. 14.10. Ps. 38.20. Pro: 29.27. Act. 28.22.

27.
A Christian can never be sound in Religion that does not prize and highly
esteem the Public Ordinances, and Ministers of God: We must delight to meet
God in his Ordinances, and we must give up our hearts to be ruled and directed
by them.
