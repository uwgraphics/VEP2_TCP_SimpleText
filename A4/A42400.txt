A WARNING TO ALL THE WORLD, BY ANNE GARGEL.
A Warning to all Priests and People; the Lord is burdened with your
iniquities, the Lord God will overthrow your table of Idols, and the
imagination of your hearts shall be confounded; the Lord God will call to an
account your Abomination, and the workers of iniquity shall be confounded; the
Lord is going about to search all hearts; the Dominion of the ungodly, shall be
overthrown, and the wisdom of God revealed to the simple, and the prudence of
the Serpent brought to naught; the subtle shall be confounded in their own
snares, and the wisdom of the eternal God shall stand for ever; the pure in
heart shall see God and live for ever, and the Adulterous Woman shall be
confounded: Long has the Heritage of the Lord layen wast, through the
abomination of the Harlot; but now shall the innocent judge the Whore, her
reward shall be doubled and her pride brought to naught, and the Merchants of
the earth shall howl over her, their profession shall be taken away; the
abominations of all hearts is known to the Lord, their wisdom is accursed: The
bitter Root shall be removed, and the Plant of the innocent shall stand, and the
wisdom of God shall guide the pure; the Eternal Plant of the Lord shall live
for ever. Mind the wisdom of God to guide your minds; the Light of Christ
that shows sin and evil, by it to be guided, til the imaginations of your
hearts be destroyed, and subtilty cease, and the dead shall rise, and wisdom
set up. In stead of the Lord you have obeyed subtilty, and the Lamb layen
slain under the abomination of your hearts: Now shall the Lord arise and call
to an account the heathen, and the innocent that has been slain shall judge
the Whore, and reward her double. The Righteous soul of Lot was grieved at the
abomination of Sodom; the Lord alone delivered him, by the wisdom of God he
was preserved, and the whole world was overthrown. Abide in the wisdom of God,
O ye simple, that the innocent may be preserved, and the power of God known to
confound all your enemies, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life; that
the bands of iniquity may be loosed, and the Prisoner set free, and the Lamb
upon his Throne. The Heritage of the Lord has long lain wast, the seditious
seed of the Devil has ruled. No longer will the Lord bear with your
abomination, he will confound your wisdom, and bring to naught your pride, the
simple shall confound your wisdom, and your shame shall be made manifest to all
that dwell in the light of the Lamb; your deceit is known to the pure God; he
shall confound your wisdom and bring to naught your pride, the workers of
iniquities shall be blasted, and their Paths consumed; and the Throned in the
hearts of the innocent; he that denies God shall be ashamed in the day of his
power, when he comes to reckon with all flesh; the Potentates of the earth shall
be confounded, and their glory brought to naught. In the presence of the Lamb
can they not stand, for the Lord alone shall be exalted; O ye bubbles: why do
ye rebel against God? why is your hearts exalted against the innocent that
calls for purity? the light of the Lamb discovers the deceits of your hearts,
and will judge you in secret when you rebel against God the pure God sees you
all, nothing is hid from the Lambs presence; his presence is pure and holy, and
no unclean thing can stand before him; wherefore return to the Lord, dwell in
that which discovers sin; then shall the wisdom of God be made manifest, and
his power known to cleanse your hearts, and to make manifest the works of the
Devil to be the enemy of your souls, that long has been exalted above the
innocent, and the pure God has not been known; your wisdom has been exalted,
and the innocent burdened, and the Lambs Power not known; Pure is God, and will
bear your iniquities no longer, your Tables of Idols shall be overwhelmed, and
the righteous shall reign: In the Day of the Lords Power shall his enemies be
made his Footstool, and the worker, of iniquity shall be confounded; and over
all shall the Lamb reign; he shall bring to confusion the counsel of your
hearts, and the builders of Babel shall be destroyed. Blessed is that man that
fears the LORD, by his wisdom shall he be guided. Dwell in wisdom all ye
simple of the Lord, til Purity is Throned, and the glory of the Lord is seen to
confound your wisdom, that has been exalted against God, that the Lamb may
judge and bring to naught the haughtiness of man: And all that has been exalted
against the innocent; The (...) God has born your iniquities, long and patient
has the Lord been, but now the innocent shall reign, the whole earth shall
witness his Power, and the wisdom of God shall be made manifest, the
haughtiness of man shall be confounded; the Lord shall guide the hearts of the
simple, and dwell with them of low degree; the Ceaders shall be cut down, and
the plant of the Lord shall stand, and his wisdom shall guide the heart of the
innocent, who dwells in the Light of the Lamb, by it to be guided; the exceeding
wisdom of God will dwell with the poor, and the rich shall be sent empty away; he
that is abased shall be exalted, he dwells in the hearts of the lowly, and the
lofty to him is not known; he that waits on God for wisdom, shall renew his
strength, and the pure in spirit shall see God and live; the proud he beholds
a far off, therefore shall your haughtiness be judged of the Lord, and
innocence shall overspread the Nation, and the Lamb shall be Throned for ever
in the hearts of the obedient: Obey God all ye Ceaders, let the imaginations of
your hearts be confounded; your shame shall appear to all men; the Lord shall
establish the heart of the innocent, who by him is guided; the eternal God is
wisdom, and his Peace is end loss; and Purity shall possess the hearts of
those that fear him; his glory shall never decay, his Plant of renown shall
stand for ever: The Root of the Devil shall be abased, that proceeds from the
lust and concupiscence of man that was by Adams fall, the fall of Adam makes
desolate: The resurrection of the Lord is pure, and purity possesses the light
of the Lamb; the lambs purity is peace, and the worlds glory is shame;
therefore be ashamed you ungodly beasts, and mind the light of the lamb you to
guide, that your bodies may be cleansed from dead works, to serve the living
God, and cease from vanity, and obey the living God, who has given every one a
Talent; the Lord shall be clear of your blood at the latter day, when a
reckoning shall be made with all flesh, to consume his enemies who has trodden
on the innocent, and lent his ear to the wicked, by it to be guided, while the
Heritage of the Lord has lain wast; therefore shall the Lord consume his
enemies, and bring to naught their wisdom, and the Lamb shall be throned in
the hearts of the simple for ever and ever. Blessed is the man that fears the
Lord, he shall be as a Lanthorn to his paths.
