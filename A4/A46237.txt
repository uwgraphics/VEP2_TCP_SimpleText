THE Jacobites Exultation Upon their conceived hopes of the Present PLOT.
I.
NOW, now the Stubborn Whigs may Rot,
Their Cause is quite undone,
We have at last contrived Plot,
Exceeding Forty One.
We'll make the Bigosts all believe,
If they would happy be,
They must Mack-Ninny's Right retrive;
Then high Boys up go we.
II.
From Pulpit tall our Priest shall bawl,
What wonders have been done,
How Whigs the Father did Enthral,
And how they served the Son.
For though the giddy Vulgar Rout,
No difference can see,
We'll impudently face it out;
Then high Boys up go we.
III.
Though we our Duty have forgot,
To testify our Zeal,
We'll swear King Will* into Plot,
Against the Commonweal.
The Dutch and He do both combine,
That way to set us free,
But we'll restore the Scottish Line;
Then high Boys up go we.
IV.
No cost and labor we'll refuse,
For Valiant Jemmy's Right,
We'll Flatter, Lie, Collogue, Accuse,
And any thing but Fight.
We'll swear Dissenters hate the King,
And English Monarchy,
Though to the Throne they did him bring;
Then high Boys up go we.
V.
Our Matters so we'll bring about,
They shall no more complain,
And as we lately Preached him out,
We'll Pray him in again.
We'll make our Pulpit ring aloud
Of Truth and Loyalty,
With this Device we'll shame the Crowd;
Then high Boys up go we.
VI.
Our Prayers and Tears we all do know
With Orange did prevail.
To cut the Oceans stormy Brow,
With twice three hundred Sail.
And as they served do bring him over,
To set the Nation free,
So they will bring James to his old Shore;
And high Boys up go we.
VII.
Our Holy Primate in his Den,
Lies close as Mouse in Cheese,
To each Petition cries Amen,
For such good Days as these.
When rambling Jeams again shall come,
What wonder will it be,
That he who is pawned his Soul to Rome
Should set God's People free.
VIII.
Thus do the Holy Brotherhood,
Their Villainies maintain,
To Treason Invocate the God
They every Day profane.
Then since they are grown so vile and lewd,
And there is no hopes they will mend,
The Dee'l himself take all the Brood,
Henceforth World without end.
