Great News FROM NOTTINGHAM. The Fifth of December, 1688.
WE have an Account from Hull the 4 th. Instant, That Major Coply having
advised with some Soldiers in the Garrison, which he could trust, and with the
Mayor and some Aldermen; who called in the Seamen to their assistance,
resolved to secure themselves and that Garrison from the Papists; accordingly
the Major with his Assistants (when it was his time to go the Rounds) seized on
the Guards, and went immediately after to the Deputy-Governour's Lodgings, the
Lord Langdale, whom he found at supper with many Gentlemen, and abundance of
Priests and Jesuits, all which he secured, and then declared for the Protestant
Religion.

Advice also came the same day from Newcastle, That the Gentry there had pulled
down the Trinkets in the Mass-House, and would have secured the Priests, had
not they run away. And its said, JackPudding and his Brethren being come to
that City, have taken the Chapel for their Playhouse.

On the second Instant, came into this City Her Royal Higness the Princess of
Denmark, with a great Guard of Gentlemen of the Counties of Essex,
Buckingham-shire, Hartford-shire, Northamptonshire, and Somersetshire.

The Right Reverend Father Henry Lord Bishop of London, attended Her Highness:
His Lordship has since his coming almost Raised a large Troop of Horse, all
Persons of Quality, which he Commands himself. Here is also a Troop or two of
Dissenters, Officers as well as Soldiers, with their Chaplain, almost Raised.
Here are thirteen or fourteen of the Nobility in this City, of which the Earl
of Devon is Principal: The Gentry and Commonalty come in in great Numbers, and
so does the Militia both Horse and Foot. The Papists are all Disarmed. And
there is likewise brought here two Load of Arms form the D. of Newcastle, and
some Arms from the Earl of Huntingdon. We have at least 2500 Horse, well
Mounted and Armed, in this City, besides Foot.
