AN EPITLE OF PVBLIVES LENTVLVS Written to the Senate and people of Rome,
concerning the true description, and portraiture of JesusChrist, gathered out
of an old nanuscript book, in the library of the College of Brasennose IN
OXFORD.
IN the time of Octavius Caesar; when it was accustomed that those who were
governors of provinces, and countries under the Senate, and people of Rome,
did certefie the Senators who were at Rome of all strange events, and
novelties, which happened in their several Countries, and climats of the
world: Publius Lentulus at that time, being in Iuric the governor over that
Country, wrote unto the Senate and people of Rome in these words.

THere arised in my time, and yet there is a man of great power and virtue,
whose name is Jesus Christ, who is called the Prophet of the truth: and of his
Disciples is called the son of God: he raises up the dead, and heals
maladies, and diseases of the people, he is of stature tale, and comely, of
countenance grave, whom who so beholds cannot but love, and withal fear him,
his hairs are of the color of a ripe filbird, plain and smooth almost to the
ears, from the ears curled and somewhat paler, and brighter of color;from
the shoulders tossed and carried with the wind, being divided in the midst of the
head after the manner of the Nazarits: his forehead smooth and passing fair,
his face without any the least stain, or wrincle, beautified with a moderate
ruddinesse, his nose and mouth very well proportioned, having his beard full
and copious, of the same color with his hairs not very long, but forked in
the midst, his look quick and cheerful, his eyes shining and clear: he is
merry but with modesty, and gravity, whom never any man knew to laugh, but
often to weepcin reproof he is terrible, in admonishing mild, his hands and
arms comely to behold, in talk sober, distinct, and modest, beautiful,
fair, above others the fonnes of men.

Farewell
