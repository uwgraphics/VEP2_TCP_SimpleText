Whereas by our late Proclamation, We have assured all and every the
inhabitants of the Province of Vlster who would give testimony of their
obedience to our authority by taking the late Oath for observing the
Cessation, that they should be received into our protection, and be safe in
their persons and goods, in pursuance whereof we have given protection to many,
who now taking advantage of the advance of Owen o Neyll into Leix, have joined
with him, to prejudice those faithful Confederats, who propose no other end
unto themselves, then the common good of the Catholic Religion, and
settlement of this Nation: We therefore taking the same into our
Consideration, and holding it requisite to apply a timely remedy unto so great
a mischief, Do hereby declare, and publish, that all and every person and
persons, who shall join with, or adhere unto, supply, relieve, or assist the
said Owen o Neyll with Men, Arms, Victuals, or other accommodation whatsoever,
shall be from henceforth put out of our protection, and accordingly proceeded
with. Whereof all and every General, Commanders, Officers, and all other
persons concerned, are to take notice.
