famous Foundation of the Charter House.

give credence to him, to bring in by Sea, being furnished with a complete Navy,
to his Majesty and the Parliament 20. Millions of Money.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS AND OTHERS Assembled in the High Court of
PARLIAMENT.
The humble Petition of Tobias Hume, one of the poor brethren of that famous
Foundation of the Charter House.
Right Honorable and Noble Lords,
I Do humbly entreat to know why your Lordships do slight me, as if I were a
fool or an Ass: I tell you truly I have been abused to your Lordships by
some base fellows; but if I did know them, I would make them repent it, were
they never so great men in your sight; for I can do the Kings Majesty and my
Country better service then the best Soldier or Colonel in this Land, or in
all Christendom, which now it is a great wonder unto me, that your Lordships
do suffer so many unskilful Soldiers to go over for Ireland, to do the
Kings Majesty's service, that are not able to lead a Company, neither do they
know what belongs to a Soldier; and yet for all this, your Lordships leave me
out, that am able to do the Kings Majesty better service then all the
Soldiers that are now to be sent over for Ireland: So that if your Lordships
please to pay for the making of a hundred or six score Instruments of war,
which I am to have along with me, if you please to send me for Ireland, and
make me Commander of all those men that are now to go over for Ireland, I will
undertake to get in all Ireland in three or four Months at the farthest, or
else if I do it not, I will give them leave to take off my head, if my
Commanders will be as forward as my self, and yet I will do all things with
great discretion. And I do here protest, I will do my King and my Country
most true and faithful service, and give the first onset upon the Rebels in
Ireland, to the honor of all England: and therefore if you will not believe
me, it is none of my fault, when I speak the truth: But if you will not give
me the command of all the soldiers that go for Ireland at this time, I will
not go for Ireland, but I will go for another Country, where I will have a
greater command then all this which I have desired from your Lordships. But I
yet live in hope that you will be pleased to believe me, and help me that live
in great misery, by reason that I have maintained a thousand Soldiers in this
City to do the King service in Ireland, and this I have done seven weeks
together, which has made me very poor, so that I have pawned all my best
clothes, and have now no good garment to wear.

And therefore I humbly beseech you all Noble Lords, that you will not suffer
me to perish for want of food, for I have not one penny to help me at this
time to buy me bread, so that I am like to be starved for want of meat and
drink, and did walk into the fields very lately to gather Snailes in the
nettles, and brought a bag of them home to eat, and do now feed on them for
want of other meat, to the great shame of this land, and those that do not
help me, but rather command their servants to keep me out of their gates, and
that is the Lord of Essex, and the Lord of Devonshire; but I thank the good
Lord of Pembrooke, and the Lord Keeper, and the Earl of Hartford, and my Lord
Major, and some other Knights, as Sir John Worstenholm and others do help me
sometimes with a meals meat, but not always, for I eat Snailes and brown
bread, and drink small Beer, and some times water, and this I have thought
good to make known unto your Lordships, hoping that your Honors will help me
now with some relief, or else I shall be forced presently to run out of the
land to serve another King, and do him all the great service, which I would
rather do unto my own most gracious King, who would not suffer me to want, if
I had money to bring me unto his Majesty, for I would do him true and
faithful service in Ireland, and can do him very great service; if his
Majesty want money, I will undertake to fetch his Majesty home twenty millions
of gold and silver in ready coin in the space of twelve or fourteen weecks:
If this service be not worthy of meat and drink, judge you that are grave and
wise Lords of the Parliament, for I will make no more Petitions unto your
Lordships, for I have made many, but have not got any answer of them, and
therefore if your Lordships will neither entertain me, nor give me money to
buy me meat and drink, I will go with as much speed as I can into other
Countries, rather then I will be starved here. For I protest I cannot endure
this misery any longer, for it is worse to me then when I did eat horse flesh,
and bread made of the bark of trees, mingled with hay dust, and this was in
Parno in List-land, when we were beleagured by the Polonians: but now to
proceed further, I have offered to show your Lordships my instruments of war,
and many other things which I can do fit for the wars, and yet other base
fellows are set forward before me that cannot do the Kings Majesty that great
service which I can do him, and therefore I say it is a great shame to all this
land, the Lord of Pembrooke, the Lord Craven, and many other Lords and Knights
and Gentlemen both in this Country and other Countries beyond the seas, as
Grave Maurice, the Marquess of Brunningburgh, and lastly the King of
Swetheland, they all know that I am an old experienced Soldier, and have done
great service in other foreign Countries, as when I was in Russia, I did put
thirty thousand to flight, and killed six or seven thousand Polonians by the
art of my instruments of war when I first invented them, and did that great
service for the Emperor of Russia; I do hereby tell you truly I am able to do my
King and Country the best service of any man in Christendom, and I will
maintain it with my art and skill, and with my sword in the face of all my
enemies that do abuse me to the Lords of the Parliament and others, and if I
did know them* I would fight with them where they dare, and also disgrace them,
I speak this, because I do hear that some of them have disgraced me unto some
of the great Lords of the Parliament. Let those soldiers argue with me, and I
will make fools of them all for matter of war, although they have persuaded
the Lords to slight me, and therefore I say again, they are not able to do
the King that good service which I can do him, both by sea and land.

And so I humbly take my leave of your Lordships, being very desirous to speak
with all the Lords of the Parliament, if they will vouchsafe to speak with me
before I go out of this Land, for I am not able to endure this misery any
longer, for I want money, meat and drink and clothes, and therefore I pray
your Lordships to pardon my boldness, and help me with some relief if you
please, or else I must of necessity go into other Countries presently, and so
I most humbly take my leave for this time, and rest

Your Lordships most humble servant to do your Honors all the good service I
can, for I have many excellent qualities I give God thanks for it. Tobias Hume
Colonel.

FINIS.
