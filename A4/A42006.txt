A few plain words to the Inhabitants of ENGLAND
O England, England, thy Visitation is nigh over, thy day is well nigh past,
thou have been an Adulterous Nation, and have run up and down to change thy
way, and has loathed the Honey and the Honey Comb, and would not take counsel
of the Lord, but have committed the two great evils in forsaking the Lord the
living Fountain, from which thou might have received life, and peace, and
have diged unto thy self broken Cesterns wherein life, and peace is not
retained; Oh England, England, thy sorrow is coming, and thy destruction is
near, pain shall seize upon thee as a Woman in travel, anguish and trouble of
Spirit shall take hold of thee, and thou shall weep and mourn with sorrow of
heart, and there shall ^e none to comfort thee, but thou shall be a hising to
all Nations round about thee, thou shall be called no more the Lady of
Kingdoms, thy valient men shall fail thee, and thy mighty men shall become
weak, and thy strong men shall lose their courage, they shall be amazed one at
another, thy mighty shall stumble at thy mighty, and they shall both fall
together, and there shall be none to deliver thee; Oh England, England, oh that
thou would have took counsel of the Lord the holy one of Israel, thy maker
that formed thee in the womb, that brought thee forth, and made thee become a
strong Nation, even a terror to all Nations round about thee, who have heard of
thy fame, when thy God the God of Jacob was on thy side, then there was no
Enchantment nor evil divinations, nor no weapons that were formed against thee,
prospered, but with thee did thy maker make War against them that were more
wicked then thee, and thou wast as his battle Axe; with thee thy God did
overturne the Horse and his Rider, and thy name was famous amongst the Nations,
and a dread to the foraigne Countries, and an astonishment to the Heathen, that
knew not thy God: Oh England, England, how have thou forgot thy God that has
done thus wonderfully for thee, and by thee, and have not walked answerable
according to thy great mercys that thy God has bestowed upon thee, but has
waxed fat, and kicked against thy maker, and has forgotten him and have
gloryed in thy shame, and has minded earthly things, and have exalted thy own
horn and art joining thy self to Idols, and have hated his reproof, and have
cast his righteous Law behind thy back, and have promised liberty to others
when thou thy self have been a servant to corruption, being departed out of his
counsel, and art become vain in thy imaginations, and so now darkness is come
over thee, and thick darkness has covered thee, for thou have rejected his
light even Christ Jesus, by which thou might have known salvation, and
might have been reconciled to thy Maker, and might have known perpetual
peace, but instead of answering the Lord according to his great mercys bestowed
upon thee, thou art turned against him, and them that purely stands in his
counsel, who keeps the word of his patience, and has the testimony of his Son
Christ Jesus, who for departing from iniquity are made a prey of by thee, and
now thou art bereaved of sense, and art cursing that which God has blessed,
and art laying the sword upon the Righteous, and art making decrees against the
upright, and now the proud are called happy and they that tempt the Lord are
delivered and the Innocent lies oppressed, and none lays it to heart: Oh,
Desolation, desolation shall come upon thee, leanness shall enter into thee,
feebleness shall surprise thee, thy knees shall smite together, and thy life
shall be a burden to thee, because of the desolation that is coming upon thee,
because of the Abominations that are committed in thee, oh if the things which
have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom and Gomorah, surely they would
have Repented; Oh, England, England, my Native Country, I am in sorrow for thee
because of the destruction that is coming upon thee, from which none can
deliver thee, ye the Overflowing Scourge is coming which is in the hand of the
Almighty, which will not spare neither thy Noble, nor thy Ignoble, that are
gone out of his Counsels, and are committing Adultry with other lovers, and art
covering thy self but not with the pure spirit of the Lord; therefore Woe, woe
and misery shall come upon thee, and thy Sacrifices shall be spread as dung on
thy face, ye all that thou do is abomination to the Lord, and all thy
Worships which thou have and art inventing he abhors, and it is all abomination
to the pure God, and he is weary to bear them, for thou live in all
unrighteousness, yet thou makes mention of the name of the Lord to take away
thy reproach, but thy covering is to narrow, the Lord has beheld thee, ye all
thy Actions are naked and bare before him, and from the wrath which is coming
upon thee thou can not escape neither can thou be delivered from the stroke
of his hand, neither shall thou save thy self, neither each deliver his
brother, but all within thy borders that are gone out of the Counsel of the
Lord, shall be cut off from amongst thee, and these things shall come upon thee
because of thy Iniquitys, thou have for a long time mocked the Lord, as if he
was such a one as thy self, thou have drew near to him with thy Lips but thy
heart has been excercised with all unrighteousness, pride and oppression, and
all wickedness has abounded in thee, and though thy God has strove with thee
from time to time, by his good spirit in thee, but thou have not regarded but
has rushed into Iniquity as a horse into the Battle, and he has also raised
and called his Children from amongst thee to bare testimony against the evil
that is committed in thee, and them thou have whiped and stoned, and cast into
Prisons, even many until death, and ye thou have not hearkened unto the Lord,
but have strengthened the hands of the evil doers, and have made the hearts of
the righteous sad whom the Lord has not made sad, and have cried peace, peace,
but, now behold sudden destruction is coming upon thee, therefore now all who
fears the Lord, come out from amongst them, and be ye separated from them, that
he may preserve you, for there are a few, ye a remnant that are come out of
thee, that worships the true God in his spirit which they have received from
him, and them will the Lord leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord, and shall not do Iniquity
nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths, for
they shall feed and ly down, and none shall make afraid: Oh England, England,
the Land of my Nativity thou must drink deep at the hand of the Lords wrath
poured out without mixture, from the presence of the Lamb, ye all who have
received the mark of the Beast must go into the Lake for ever, and ever, even
all but those whose names are written in the Lambs Book of life; this is true
and shall stand though the full end be not yet.

THe sixth of the second Month, 1660. in the night season was showed me a
Vision as I lay upon my bed, in the silence of my spirit; I saw a Book opened,
and looking into it, my heart was greived, and my Spirit in me was troubled,
yet nevertheless in it I read, and in reading the glory of the world was
presented unto me, and much of it I might enjoy, if I would join with the
Princes thereof; and on the contrary if I would not join with them, that I
should be tormented and persecuted exceedingly, then I pondred in my heart, and
seriously consider what the end of this matter might be, and I looked and
beheld they that were with the Princes of this world were an exceeding
numberless number of the great ones of the Earth, and a great and mighty people
were they and furious to behold, then I waited to see further in the things,
and I looked and behold they stood upon a dry place, and I turned my head and I
saw a great Pit and in it was no water, then it was showed me, that if I joined
with them, then I should fall and perish, for want of water; Then another Book
was opened and in it I saw a few which were come from amongst the Princes of
the Earth, and they were but a few, then I turned to see what was their
strength, and by what they were preserved and supported against so mighty a
people, and I looked, and beheld they stood together, and in the midst of them
was a River of water a^ clear as Crystal, and they all drank of the River, and
was refreshed, and they would not go from it, then some that were amongst the
great Multitude that were a thirst came and drank, and were satisfied and never
returned more to the great number, then I turned to the small number, where the
water was and I drank and was satisfied, then I was to call to them of the
great number, and tell them where they might have water, that they might never
thirst more, then I (tasting of the water) said certainly it is good to be
here, soon after the numberless number sought to destroy the few (who drank of
the River and were satisfied) but they could not hurt them, for the Lord was
with them, but the numberless number, who drank not of the River fell into
their own Pit, and perished for want of water, then said I is there any God
like unto our God, nay, praise him for evermore.

AS a mighty Host in Pharaohs Coast, so do the wicked rise,
But in the strength of the living God we do them all despise,
Who as a beseiged City so do they us beset,
Yet in the power of the Lamb the victory we shall get,
For our weapons they are tried though not visible to behold,
Which is the Spirit of the mighty God, this makes us very bold,
And with this spirit we Pray, and with understanding Sing
Unto the living God, who is be come our King,
His word is in our hearts with his Septer he does us sway,
And by his power has us preserved unto this very day,
Worthy worthy is he to Reign, whose strength is ever sure,
And does remain World without end when time shall be no more,
Therefore let Sion now rejoice, let Jerusalem be glad,
For the Lord has bowed down his ear and their cry he has heard,
Although in Prisons close, and in Dungeons they are shut,
Yet the Lord the mighty God he does not them forget.

To you Travelers in Sion, and to you Mourners therein to you I send Salvation.
FRiends you I have remembered, and the remembrance of you has been sweet unto
me, and this is the word of the Lord unto ye despised ones, who have chose the
Lord the God of Jacob to be your God which came unto me in the night season
when my heart was fixed on him, and my mind stayed in his invisible gift, and
as I meditated on him in the night watches, Thus says the Lord there is
counsel with me I am the instructor of the simple, and will be strength unto
the weak, and my people shall know that I am God, and that there is none
besides me; for my left hand shall be under them, and with my right hand will I
uphold them; I will be as a rest in a weary land unto them, and as a refuge in
the day of battle, and though they be feeble I will support them, and weak yet
will I give them strength, and I will never leave them nor forsake them, and my
Covenant concerning them shall never be broken, if man could break my Covenant
with the day, that there should not be day and night in its season, then might
they disanul the Covenant that I made to Abraham and his seed for ever, but the
seed shall endure for ever, and shall abide as the Sun before me, yet for all
this they who have chosen me shall not go untryed, for I will suffer them to
be tried that they may be proved yet will I preserve the faithful and the
upright hearted, whose eye is at my glory, unto them my name shall be famous
because my power which is the higher power, they shall feel in their inward
parts from which they shall speak well of my name, and though their Enemies be
many who as Jeroboam the Son of Neba^ would cause them to sin, saying their
Imaginations are the Gods which brought us out of Egypt, but all ye that is
upright hearted they shall never prevail against you, for there is no
Enchantments against Jacob, nor Divination against Israel but I behold it, and
with my Light will show it unto you, and will preserve you out of the path that
leads to the Chambers of Death, and will honor you amongst the people, and
Crown you with my Life that is immortal, and will sill your souls with joy, and
your hearts with gladness, even with a greater joy than that of Harvest,
therefore all ye weak ones, whose faces are set toward Sion and have turned
your backs to Babylon, the City of Confusion, and from all her Merchants, lift
up your heads for the day is come and coming that the Lord will comfort the
Mourners and give them beauty for ashes, and a Garment of praise for the Spirit
of Heaviness, for it is praises that becomes my house and with the high praises
shall the upright be filled from the feeling of my life in their inward parts,
and though their Enemies be many, and the Wicked arises against them as a
mighty Flood and seem to overflow them, yet will I scatter them as with an East
wind, and I will plead with them in my fury, and in my hot displeasure will I
take vengeance at mine and your Enemies, and I will preserve you, and will
reward you double into your bosoms that are faithful unto me, therefore none be
cast down, for neither Walls, nor Locks, nor Bars can separate me from you, but
I will asuredly be with you and will secretly uphold you, and will get my self
a name in you, by which Salvation ye shall know me, to be unto you as Walls and
Bulworks, and ye shall count nothing dear to your selves, that ye may finish
your course with joy, so blessed are ye upright, ye shall stand in your lot at
the end of the day but the deceitful and Rebellious shall dwell in a dry Land,
and this is a faithful salvation to you all from a lover of Truth and
Righteousness, and a follower of the Lamb.

Your Friend Thomas Green.
Given fourth the 14 th. of the 6 th. Month 1662. in Colchester to be Read
amongst Friends,
When my Meditations were on my God, and my heart was closed and joined to his
eternal quickening spirit, and in it was waiting, then I cast my eye to behold
my suffering brethren; who suffers for the testimony of my God, and for keeping
the word of his patience, then a pity in my heart arose toward them w ho are
daily made a prey upon by unreasonable men, then said I Lord how long, how long
will it be before thou restrain the wicked and say unto them enough who daily
tread upon thy heritage, and lies in wait to devour them and swallow up them
quick, who have chose thee, the Lord of Jacob, the God of poor distressed
Israel, to be their God; Thus says the Lord the mighty God of Jacob fear not,
fear not neither be thou troubled, for I will deliver my seed, though at this
time its very small and lies as amongst the clods of the Earth; I have heard,
I have heard its cry, and its request, I do regard and my ear has listened,
and I have taken notice of my Childrens mournings, and their tears, I have
beheld, and uprightness in their hearts I have found, and their desire is to do
my will, and to answer my requirings, for my love has gained their hearts, for
I have searched them, and tried many of them to the bottom, and I have found my
excellent Spirit as in my servant Daniel, and its much regarded by them, and
their delight is to be guided by it, and they love me more then earthly glory,
and have chose me to be their God; Surely says the Lord the mighty God of
Jacob, I will never forget them, though the Mountains may depart, and though
the Hills may be removed, yet my loving kindness shall never depart from those
that fear me, nor my Covenant of mercy from my Seed for ever, though Hell and
Death combind together and cry a Confedracy, yet they shall never prevail,
neither shall they lay my Heritage wast: Therefore now let all the upright in
heart rejoice, and let their souls praise the living God who will be avenged of
their Enemies, and of all that rise up against them, and will scatter them as
with an East Wind in his feirce indignation which is already kindled, for the
Lord is awakened to jealousy, and now is come to preserve his little Flock
that they may know his power, and feel his everlasting Arm to be revealed in
them, for now will he be Salvation to the Righteous, and gladness to the pure
in heart: The Time, the time, the time, the set time is come, that the Lord is
come to comfort the poor desolate ones, and he will abide with them for ever,
and in the Arms of his tender mercy will he preserve them to his own glory,
and to the comfort of their souls for ever, who in the life of the Lamb abide,
Crowned with immortal life shall they be, and in time shall sing the song of
Moses, and the Lamb even the Song of deliverance, and triumph in their hearts
over all that is contrary to the Lord, blessed are the faithful, and happy for
ever shall they be that abides unto the end, and have always hold of the life
that's eternal, with that to be kept, so will they finish their Course with joy,
and lie down in peace in the Kingdom of Righteousness; Let it be so says my
soul in the name of the Lord,

Amen.
THE END
