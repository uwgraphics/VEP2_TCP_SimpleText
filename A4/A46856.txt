15. God has delivered over unto the Pope the power and rule of Heaven and
Earth. Ext. Jo. 22. tit. 5. did. 22. c. omnes.

16. The whole World is the Pope's right and inheritance; therefore if
Emperors or Kings have at any time given any Privileges or Lands, to any Pope,
(as they say Constantine did to Sylvester) they did not give that which was
their own to give; but only restore that which was formerly taken from them by
tyranny and injustice. Aug. de Anconade potestate Ecclesiastica, part. 1. q. 1.
ar. 1.

17. The Pope is above all Principalities and Power, and every name that is
named, not only in this World, but in that which is to come: and that he is the

G. Valentia.

CHAP. II. Of the Papal Grandeur, or Greatness.
1. WHen the Emperor goes to be crowned by the Pope, he, as soon as he
espyeth his Holiness, is to kneel and worship him bare-headed, then to approach
nearer and kiss his feet; and the same is to be done by the Empress when she is
crowned: Sacrarum Ceremoniarum, lib. 1. fo. 22. edit. Romans

2. When the Emperor is crowned at the public Procession before the people,
he is to go to the Pope's House, and then to hold the Stirrup till his Holiness
mounts on Horseback; and then like a Lacquey must he hold the Pope's Rosinant
some ways by the reins. Ibidem, fo. 25, 26.

3. This piece of Service must the Emperor, King or Chief Potentate perform
when the Pope is chosen, in his Procession to the Lateran Church. Ibidem.

4. If there be two Kings present, then the Pope does command the one of them
on his right side, the other on his left must lead his Palfray along by the
Bridle. Ibid. 17. And therefore when Frederick Barbarossa held the left Stirrup
of his Holiness as he alighted from his Horse, his Holiness Pope Adrian the
Fourth took great displeasure, because he held the left Stirrup of his Saddle
and not the right; which if he had intended to have honored us, he would have
held the right, which ought to have been holden. Funcii Chronicon. Bar. de vita
Pontific.

5. The best Layman though he be Emperor or King, must carry Water for the
Pope to wash his hands in, and must carry up the first Dish of meat to his
Table. Ibidem, fo. 20.

6. If the Pope will not ride on Horseback, but be carried in a Chair, then
four of the greatest Princes, yea though the Emperor be one of them, must put
their Shoulders to the said Chair, and so carry him some space: Ibidem, lib. 1.
fo. 17. By this all the Emperors, Kings and Princes of the Earth must learn to
obey, fear and reverence him.

7. When his Holiness is Elected and carried to the Lateran, he takes up as
much Money as he can in his hand, and throws it amongst the People, saying,
Silver and Gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee. Ibid. fo. 17.
Act. 36.

8. We must bow at the Name of the Virgin Mary, and of the Pope, as well as at
the Name of Jesus. Par. Crassus de Ceremoniis Card. and Episc. lib. 1. c. 22.

9. Whosoever obeys not the Command of the Pope, shall die the death.
Ribadeniera, lib. 1. de Principe, c. 17. p. 108.

10. The Cross has precedence before the Eagles or Ensigns of the Empire; the
Sword of Peter before that of Constantine; and the Apostolic Seat judges, and
is above the Imperial power. Baronius in Paraen. p. 9.

11. That the Pope cannot be judged by any person; for it is written, That the
Spiritual person judges all things, but he himself is not judged, 1 Cor. c. 7.

12. All the Princes of the Earth must do honor and reverence to the Pope as a
great God. Blondus lib. 3. Romans instaurat,

13. An appeal can be made from the Council to the Pope. Johannes de Sylva de
Beneficiis, part 4. p. 4. n. 28. T. 15. part 1. fo. 109.

14. No appeal can be made from the Pope to the Council. Jacobatius de Council.
ar. 1. n. 36. T. 13. part. 1. fo. 352. 16. 26. fo. 270.

CHAP. III. Of the Power of the Pope.
1. THE Pope can do all things that God himself can do, only sin excepted.
Jacob. de Griffiis decis. aureae. part. 1. c. 31.

2. The Pope has no limits or bounds in the whole World, but those which it
self had. Jacob. Fuligattus vita Card. Bellarm. lib. 3. c 5.

3. He has power of making sin more sin; and that which is no sin, to be sin.
Bellar. contra Barclasum, c. 31.

4. The Pope can give Empires and Kingdoms to whom he pleases, and depose the
possessors of them. Jul. Ferrettus de re and discip. militari, p. 516. Celsus
Mancinus de juribus Principum, lib. 3. c. 3. p. 76. Greg. de Valentia, To. 3.
disp. 1. 4. 12. punct. 2. col. 439. 443.

5. The Pope may depose Kings by his power, if they be either negligent in the
administration of their Government, or do not extirpate all Heretics out of
their Dominions. Hostien. Sum. lib. 5. tit. de Haeretic. 8. quae poena. S. 11.
Johannes de Tuzz. Cremala sum. de eccles. c. 14. propos. 44. Panormitanus, lib.
5. Decret. de Haeretic. c. 13.

6. If a King turns Heretic, he has no right to his Kingdom, and so no man
ought to think it strange if the Pope depose him. Dom. a Soto. in 4. sentent.
did. 25. q. 2. a. 1. n 3. Alphons. a Castro de justa hereticorum punitione.
lib. 2. c. 7. col. 12. 45. 1246.

7. If Kings will not be obedient to the Church, then may the Pope by his great
power from Heaven very justly turn them from all their Royalties and
Government; and the Subjects themselves, if the Pope bid them, must take up
Arms against them. Gre. Nunnius Coronel. de vera Christi Eccles. lib. 9. p. 345.

8. The Pope can quit Subjects from the Obedience and Allegiance which they owe
to their Kings. Joh. Maria Bellettus disq. clerical. part. 1. p. 282. p. 109.
Panormitan. in Decret. de Haereticis. c. 13.

9. If the King does tyrannize, and does not execute his Office duly, or when
there is any other just cause for so doing, then the people may dethrone him,
and elect another. Em. Sa. Aphoris. 5. principis. 9. 2. Molina de just. tom. 1.
Tract. 2. disp 29. col. 213, 214. Jacob. Simonica de Cathol. Inst. 7. 9.. 257.

10. The Pope may make an Ordinance contrary to the Epistle of St. Paul. Char.
Ruinus Cons. 109. n. 1. Vol. 5.

11. The power of the Pope is greater than that of the Apostles, having power
to derogate from the sayings and words of the Apostle. The Decis. of the Rota
at Rome. Decis. 1. n. 3. Antonius Maria in addit. ad decis. novas, n. 9.

12. The Doctrine of the Pope is the infallible rule of Faith, and the Holy
Scripture has taken its force, and does take it from his Holiness; and he that
does not believe this is an Heretic. Silvester Prieras in epitom. resp. ad
Luther. c. 7. To. 1.

13. The Pope is he by whom Kings reign, according to that which is said, By me
Kings reign. Fr. Bosius de temporal. Eccles. Monarchia. lib. 1. ca. 3. 11. And
therefore Henry the Fourth Emperor, being excommunicated by Pope Gregory the
7th, he puts off his Royal and Imperial Habiliments with his Wife and young Son
barefooted and clothed in Canvas (being made a Spectacle to Angels and Men to
admire at) in a most bitter Winter, and most dangerous kind of Travel, comes
to Canasium, where the Pope then resided; Fasting and Suitor like from Morning
till Evening he danceth attendance; for three days he patiently endures this
lamentable affliction, being often told his Holiness was not at leisure to
attend his Suit, and denied admittance; but after great importunities and
solicitations, and giving Oath and security for his good behavior for the
future, he is absolved. Nauclerus, p. 36. Urspergensis, Platina in vita Grego.
7. By this the Power and Supremacy of the Pope is to be seen over Emperors and
Kings.

14. The Pope may do, what God does. Decret. de Major. et obedient. c. solicit.
6.

CHAP. IV. Religion, Prayer, Faith, Charity.
It Is in the Precept of Prayer, as in that of Faith, Hope, and Charity, there
is no certain time wherein this Precept obliges directly; but only indirectly,
to wit, When its necessary to acquire some good, or to remove some evil. He
that prays not to God in a temptation against chastity, sins only against
chastity; for he sins not in omitting prayer, but because of the danger he is
in to violate chastity. Tamber. decal. c. 4. sect. 2. n. 5.

So that we are not at any time obliged directly to pray unto God any more than
to love him, believe, or trust in him; but indirectly, and as it were by
accident, when we have need, as in a temptation, or the like.

2. In our private prayers which we make to God, it is not necessary to use any
attention; nor are we obliged to attend: for this obligation goes no further
than to venial sin; and those prayers which are made by command, in that case
none is obliged upon pain of mortal sin, to an inward attention in saying his
Office, provided he rehearse it outwardly and entirely. Fliut. Mor. q. q. Tom.
2. tr. 23. c. 8. n. 252.

3. Whatsoever distraction or evil thoughts there are in the mind of Man in
Prayer, and when he rehearses the Divine Office, though it be voluntary, if it
comes of negligence and not of contempt, it is but a venial sin: when it comes
from a formal and deliberate contempt, yet we fail not in satisfying the
Church, and discharging our Duty. Escobar. tr. 5. exam. 6. n. 157. p. 679. For
it is not necessary to satisfy the command of the Church, to have any inward
attention; but it is sufficient to give some outward respect, and behave ones
self decently. Coninck 3. part q 83. art. 68. 247. n. 286. n. 301. p. 286. The
outward act of prayer, which is done with the outward circumstances which it
ought to have, is a true exterior action of the virtue of Religion, though it
be done with voluntary distraction, which is it self a sin. Coninck, ibidem.
For the outward adoration which is rendered to an Idol, is a true and outward
act of adoration, and of idolatry; though he who makes this adoration
outwardly, has no intention to adore the Idol. Bauny in his Sum. chapter 13. p.
176. So we must believe that they pray who recite the Office, though without
intention, yet not without exterior decency and composure such as the action
requires. Bauny. ibidem.

4. Christ commands us to receive Baptism, a Tyrant forbids us to receive it,
upon pain of our lives; we are obliged not to receive it. Escob. lib. 1. Theol.
God Commands one thing, and a Tyrant another; we must obey the Tyrant rather
than God.
mor. sect. 2. 67. problem. 29.

5. In receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, it is not necessary to have
actual devotion; for he who is voluntarily distracted in the receiving the
Sacrament, provided he contemns it not, puts no obstacle to the effect of the
Communion, because he sins not mortally. Fillut. Tom. 1. mor. q q. tr. 4. chap.
6. n. 163, 164. p. 87.

6. If actual sin be committed in the very Communion it self, it hinders not at
all from the receiving the grace of the communion; because this Sin makes not
the person unworthy of the participation of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ;
for there is nothing but mortal sin that is capable of causing this
Unworthiness. Fillut. ibidem.

7. He who has sinned mortally, and has remorse for his sins, and has
confessed them, may absolutely communicate, though the very night before, or
even a little before the Communion, he has sinned mortally. Filut. tr. 4. c.
8. n. 224.

8. If a man after he has communicated many times in a bad state, comes to be
converted, he shall receive in an instant all the graces which were due to so
many Communions, though they were received in an unworthy manner. Mascarenhas.
tr. 1. de Sacr. in genesis disp. 4. c. 5. n. 211. From this admirable doctrine it
follows, That a man may become most holy in an instant, and will surpass in
holiness, many of those who have lived in innocence, when he was plunged in
Sin; and the greater and more sins he has committed, the more holy he is.

9. It Is not necessary that the Priest who finds himself guilty of mortal sin,
should confess himself before he administers the Sacrament. Discast. tr. 2. de
Sacr. d. 3. d. 10. n. 200.

10. The Priest may administer the Sacrament to one who sins publicly,
provided that he does not receive it publicly through contempt of the
Sacrament or of Religion, but for some other end; and that he threaten the
Priest with death or loss of reputation, or to do some great wrong to him in
his goods; and this is rather to permit sin in another for some just cause,
than to cooperate therewith. Escob. lib. 4. Theol. Mor. c. 3.

11. In extreme necessity we are obliged to do alms of such things as are not
necessary unto life, though they be needful to support us in our condition.
Escob. tr. 5. Exam. 5. n. 43. p. 632. By Extreme Necessity, we must understand
that on which the life of man depends; so that if he be not assisted, he will
surely dye: in this case we are obliged to give that which is superfluous.

12. A person who has abundance, after he has satisfied all his own
necessaries, and those of his own family, having yet a superfluity, is not
obliged in a public Famine to give unto the Poor, nor to any one whomsoever, if
he see him not in eminent danger to die with famine. Escob. tr. 5. exam. 5. n.
47. p. 633.

13. We are not obliged to assist or give alms unto the poor with any notable
diminution of our wealth, honor or life. Tolet. lib. 4. Inst. Sacerd. c. 10.
n. 5. p. 635.

14. We may fulfill the Precept of Alms, by lending only, without giving any
thing. Tolet. lib. 8. c. 85. n. 2. p. 1242. And that unless in extreme
necessity, (in evident danger of death) Alms are not commanded under mortal
sin. Ibid. And in that case we are not obliged any further to provide for them,
if we have not Wealth to spare, and Riches which are superfluous; which very
few persons believe they have, because Covetousness and Ambition make all men
in a manner necessitous: so that it is clear by the doctrine of these Doctors,
the Rich are not obliged to give Alms, but out of their superfluity; and not
then, but in case of great necessity. Those things which may exalt us unto a
better condition, as Honor, Preferment or Places, are not to be accounted
superfluous. Granad. 22. controver. 4. d. 2. lib. 4. n. 18. So that rarely it
happens that we can have superfluous goods; and so by consequence we must
rarely give alms. Tamb: lib 5. decal. c. 1. sect. 1. n. 14.

15. Amongst Christians there are few who are damned for failing to exercise
the works of corporal mercy, none being obliged thereunto under mortal sin,
unless in the utmost and greatest necessity of his Neighbor, which happens
very rarely, so as to impose any great obligation on any particular person.
Less. lib. 13. de perfect. divin. v. 22. n. 142. And though we are not to give
Alms, but in the greatest necessity, yet when that happens, no person is
particularly obliged to provide against it; because the obligation is to assist
our Neighbor in general to all those who have means to do it, but none in
particular; so that a poor man may die of hunger in the view of many persons
who may and ought to assist him, while they expect and attend one another, none
being bound in particular to satisfy an obligation which is in common to them
all.

16. It Is certain, there is no obligation to love our Neighbor by any intern
al act of the Will, expressly terminated in him; whence it is, if you hate him
not, and for his sake observe the outward works of good will, you love him
sufficiently. Suarez. c. 5. d. 1. lib. 4. n. 4. Filut. Tom. 2. mor. q. q. tr.
22. c. 9. n. 283. p. 92. Of 32 Parables, which is the most frequent manner of
Christ's discourse, (...)i would contr. (...)oh. 13. 34. (...)o. c. 15. v. (...)2,
17. Mar. (...). 22. v. 40.
he applies but one for the recommendation of the love of our Neighbor, in the
person of the distressed poor man abused by Thieves betwixt Jericho and
Jerusalem. Sermond. tr. 2. p. 121.

It Is no mortal sin to have such a hatred against our Neighbor, as not to be
willing to keep company with him, to have such and so violent an aversion from
him, as upon no terms or occasion to be willing to speak with him, nor help him
in his business, nor at all to forgive him, when he acknowledges his fault,
and offers satisfaction. Bauny's Sum. p. 81.

17. There is no absolute Commandment to love God, because every Command
carries some threatening with it to keep them in their duty to whom it is made,
and then some penalty or punishment against those who violate it; now the
Commandment which God gave us to love him, contains neither threat nor
punishment, and so by consequence it is no Commandment truly so called. Sermond
in his Defense of Virtue, Tr. 2. p. 28. God commanding us to love him, contents
himself that we should obey him in his other Commandments: for God has not
obliged us absolutely to testify our affections to him, otherwise than by
yielding obedience to him. Ibid. p. 11. And God has not commanded us so much
to love, as not to hate him. Ibid. p. 19. And all those which in Scripture are
vulgarly called Commands to love God, they are Advices and Counsels, but not
Commands. Ibidem, p. 20, 21. God ought to be content that we love him a little
as we please, because to love him more, and to a certain degree, is only an
Advice; it suffices that we love him much under what we could, if we would;
because the least degree of love, is enough for him, and to satisfy the
Commandment. Amic. Tom. 4. d. 23. sect. 2. n. 21, 22, 19.

Whereas it is said we must love God above all things; we must not extend these
words (All things) to the rigor in its utmost extent, and according to its
natural sense, so as it comprehend under it all Creatures, but that we must
understand (by all things) only those which are evil, contrary to God, and
which destroy the friendship we have with him by Grace; (that is to say) mortal
sin only. Amic. Tom. 4. disp. 29. sect. 2. n. 16.

And if we be obliged to love God, we are not obliged to love him above three
or four moments in our life, whereof the first is when we begin to have the use
of Reason; Secondly, at the point of death. Thirdly, every fifth year during
life. Filut. Tom. 2. mor. qq. tr. 22. c. 9. n. 286, 290. p. 93. The rest of our
time we may love God or the World as we please.

18. If a man has committed any mortal sin, he is not obliged to contrition
and sorrow for the sin before the article of his death. Filut. Tom. 1. qq. mor.
tr. 6. c. 8. n. 198, 199, 157. So that (according to this doctrine) who is in
mortal sin, may with a safe Conscience persist voluntarily all his life in a
state of enmity and aversion to God, and delay his Conversion until the point
of death, demanding only forgiveness of God, when he is ready to die and can
offend him no longer.

19. If a man being at the point of death, endeavors to do what he can, and
having in his mind only an act of attrition present, he says unto God these
words, Lord have mercy on me, with design to pacify him, he shall be
justified, God himself supplying the want of absolution. Escob. tr. 7. Exam. 4.
n. 122. p. 819.

20. Faith and Charity are not such supernatural Graces and Virtues as the
World takes them to be; for a man may be a Martyr and merit the Crown of
Martyrdom, not only without any act of Charity, but also without any act of
Faith; and though he suffers without love to God, and though he never thinks of
him, it is sufficient that he be killed out of hatred to the Faith, though he
have not so much as a thought of confessing it; as it happens in a sudden
eruption of Barbarians, one is killed in his sleep through hatred of Faith.
Connick 3. par. q. 66. de baptis. a. 12. n. 136. p. 8. Celot. lib. 3. c. 3. p.
125.

21. It matters not, if death had been proposed to this man, the fear it would
have brought on him, would possibly have forced him to forget God; yet because
this conditional supposition produces no real thing in the man, it cannot hurt
him. Connick 3. par. q. 66. de baptis. p. 139. So then to be a Martyr, it is not
at all necessary to have so much as a conditional will to die for God, if
occasions were presented, that the contrary disposition, rather to forsake God
than lose his life on this occasion, cannot hurt him; and by consequence it is
not bad, nor hinders a man from being in a state to receive a Crown of
Martyrdom, if he die without ever thinking of it in this disposition by the
hand of a Tyrant.

22. He who outwardly recites the Office of the Church, does perform the duty
of Prayer, though he does it without any inward intention or devotion, so as
the outward appearance and Precept be observed, which such an action requires;
for the outward action wherewith we attend on God, is of the same nature, and
appertains to the virtue of Religion. Bauny in his sum. c. 20. p. 335. And the
duty of prayer is satisfied though there be no intention. Escob. tr. 5. exam.
6. c. 13. n. 136. p. 677. For he that does in substance, that is to say,
outwardly, that which is commanded, satisfies truly the Commandment of the
Church, though he has no will to accomplish it, but rather the contrary.
Layman. lib. 1. tr. 4. c. 4. n. 6. p. 49.

23. The Blessed Virgin is more easy entreated than Jesus Christ, therefore
her protection is more assisting and helpful to us. Fr. de Mendoza virid. lib.
2. probl. 2.

24. There is as great efficacy, as to Salvation, in the Virgin Mary's Milk, as
in our Savior's Blood. Andr. Rivet. Apol. lib. 2. c. 5. p. 248. Idem, lib. 1.
c. 19. p. 155. Idem, Jesuita vapul. c. 14, 15. p. 3, 307, 808.

25. A man may be saved without ever loving God in all his life. Let. Provinc.

26. It Is lawful to consult a Conjurer. Addit. myster. Jesuit. p. 111. And that
an expert Conjurer in diabolical arts is well worthy a reward. Let. Provinci.
p. 116. And a Fortune Tellers is not obliged to restitution, if he has

CHAP. V. Of Sin.
1. HE that from the impression of an inveterate custom, as it were die a sort
of impetuous necessity, is transported to do evil, as to speak words of
Blasphemy, sins not at all; because a man cannot sin without rational knowledge
and deliberation. Layman, lib. 1. tr. 2. c. 3. n. 6. p. 20. An evil custom
takes away the use of reason, and so by consequence it does not augment but
diminish sin* nay, sometimes it takes it away; so that man who has these evil
habits, is in a better condition than he that has them not: and by often
sinning, is put into a condition or state of not sinning any more.

2. Perjury, which one commits through natural inadvertency, or because of the
custom he has to swear, is no mortal sin, though he who does it, has his will
effectually addicted to sin by an evil habit. Filut. Mor. Tom. 2 tr. 25. c. 1.
n. 27. p. 173. By this admirable doctrine, although a man perjure himself, he
having not a full knowledge, or transported with some violent habit, it is no
mortal sin in him.

3. If a man customarily curse his Horse, Dogs, Hawks, or other Creatures,
which are without reason, setting aside choler by which he suffers himself to
be transported, it is no sin at all; because this evil custom is become natural,
and makes him do it without any passion, and even so as he perceives it not,
therefore he commits no sin, in the most strange curses and execrations.
Bauny's sum. c. 6. p. 73. c. 5. p. 66.

4. Those who in their Youth, have committed many actions of a vicious nature,
which they did not believe to be such, are not obliged to confess one word of
them, when they know and understand their nature. Bauny in his sum. c. 40. p.
650, 651. Because when they were committed, they had not the full use of
reason, and knowledge, and at most they were but venial sins, if any sin at all.

5. If any one shoots an Arrow by which he hits his enemy, supposing invincibly
that it was a Beast, he is altogether innocent of this man's slaughter, though
he was in such a disposition, that if he had known that it had been his Enemy,
he would have killed him with more joy. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c. 16. n. 13.
p. 70.

6. The pleasure which is taken in an action of mortal sin, which is done in
sleep, drunkenness, madness or through ignorance, is no sin. Filut. Mor. Tom.
2. tr. 21. c. 8. n. 290. p. 26. Ignorance is a great Asylum for innocence, for
it does not only protect men from the greatest sins, but it gives them liberty
and power to rejoice and take pleasure in them as good actions, when one comes
to know them or call them to remembrance.

7. He who knows that it is a mortal sin to commit an action, but knows not
that it is a sin to command another to commit it, through invincible ignorance,
is excused from sin in doing it. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c. 16. n. 19.
Therefore if a Peasant should hear it spoken by a man reputed to be Pious and
Knowing, that it was a sin to steal, and commit fornication outwardly, but that
it was lawful to desire the one or the other, in this case the interior act is
exempt from all sin, because of invincible ignorance. Ibidem.

8. To sin mortally, it is not enough to see the evil that is done, and the
danger incurred in doing, but he ought to have a full and perfect knowledge, and
besides this, both time and means to deliberate on it; therefore such actions
which are committed out of ignorance, evil habits, or passion, are not mortal
sins; it is not enough to commit a mortal sin, to consider and to will with
deliberation the evil that is done, but this consideration and deliberation
must be full. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c. 16. n. 21. Therefore when there occur
in one and the same action two sorts of different wickedness, it is not
sufficient to perceive one, to make him guilty of both, but we must have or be
obliged to have an actual knowledge of the other; Therefore when a man lies with
a woman whom he knows to be not his Wife, but is invincibly ignorant that she
is his Kinswoman, he is guilty of Fornication, but not of Incest. Sanch. op.
mor. lib. 1. c. 1. n. 8. p. 2, 70. Amic. Tom. 3. d. 17. s. 8. n. 172. p. 205.
Escob. tr. 2. Exam. 1. c. 3. n. 8. p. 275.

9. He who does some unlawful act, knowing well that it is forbidden, but not
remembering it to be such when he does it, is exempt from mortal sin; because
forgetfulness or negligence which is the cause we think not of it, the evil we
are about to do, is not imputed for sin, if it be not voluntary: and it is not
voluntary, if we bethink us not to consider that we are obliged to examine what
we are about to do. Layman. lib. 1. tr. 12. c. 4. n. 6. p. 20.

10. To sin, it is not sufficient to do the evil that is forbidden, or not to do
that which is commanded by the Law of God, Nature or the Church; but it is
necessary to have a knowledge of the evil that we do, and an intention to do it:
By this rule we are free from the greatest sins, so we have a good intention in
committing of them, or that we have no evil intention: we may wish evil or
death to our Neighbor, without sin, when we are induced thereunto by some good
motive, as that he is given to suing; or that he is a person of good reputation
for his well living, and therefore does eclipse our credit. Bauny's sum. c. 6.
p. 73.

11. He who does maintain an Heretical Proposition without believing it, or who
shall be a Communicant or Auditor amongst Protestants without having his Heart
there, but out of pure derision, or to comply with the Times, and to accomplish
his designs, he ought not to be esteemed a Protestant therefore; be cause his
understanding is not infected with their errors. Bonacina. d. 3. q. 4. n. 7.

12. He who has knowledge of the Law, and is ignorant of the penalty which it
ordains against those who violate it, does not incur the penalty which he is to
By this maxim, he that does not know that Hell is the punishment of mortal Sin,
shall not be in danger of going thither.
undergo if he obey not. Tambur. Decal. lib. 1. c. 2. sect. 10. n. 12.

13. God cannot command or forbid a matter that is in it self slight under the
penalty of mortal sin. Em. Sa. verb. Praecept. n. 1. p. 575. Amit. Tom. 5. a.
5. de lege humana. s. 8. n. 194. p. 64.

14. He that has a will to commit all venial sins if he were able, sins only
venially. Escob. tr. 2. exam. 1. c. 12. n. 57. p. 385.

15. To make an action evil and unlawful, is required first to make it appear,
that the reasons which prove the malice of the action be demonstrative; that
is, that they be such as whereunto no probable answer can be given. Secondly,
that the reasons which prove this same action to be good and lawful, be not so
much as probable. Thirdly, that the Opinions which maintain that this action is
good, has not sufficient authority to be held probable; all these must be
observed, otherwise the action is not evil. Caram. fund. p. 138.

16. To tell a lie in Preaching on any doctrinal Point, is but a venial sin.
Escobar. tr. 7. exam. 4. n. 107. p. 816.

17. To perform the most sacred actions, as to administer the Sacraments, or to
receive them, or to celebrate the Mass for vainglory, is but a venial sin,
though vainglory be proposed as the principal end. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c.
3. n. 1. p. 9.

18. When a slight thing is commanded, the commandment obliges not unto mortal
sin, although that be the intention of him who commands. Em. sa. verb.
praecept. n. 1. p. 575.

19. The greatness of the sin ought to be estimated from, and according to its
matter and subject. Escobar. Sanch.

20. No person is obliged to avoid the next occasion of sin, when thereby some
great loss will befall him; in this case it cannot be said that he wills this
occasion, but permits it only; because that he withdraws not from this
occasion, is not that he would absolutely abide in it, but because he would
decline the damage which this withdrawing would bring on him. Sanch. in select.
disp. 10. n. 20. For this reason a man is not obliged to put away his
Concubine, if her company be very advantageous to him, and in departing with
her he lose any great benefit.

21. A thing is not the next occasion of sin, unless it be vicious and a sin of
it self. Bauny's Theol. mor. par. 1. lib. 4. de poenit. q. 14. p. 94.

22. To sell a Woman paint, which he knows she will use to draw young men to
unchaste love, it is lawful; otherwise he would lose a Customer, and suffer loss
and damage: So to build the Temple of an Idol, or to sell an Idol it self, or
to sell an Infidel a Lamb, which he knew he would use in Sacrifice to an Idol,
is no sin. Tamb. lib. 5. decal. c. 1. s. 4. n. 38, 34, 35, 36.

23. All the breaches of the first and second Table of the Decalogue are no
sins at all, when they are committed by any out of ignorance, surprise or
passion. Mist. of Jesuit. add. p. 125. London. 1658.

24. It Is no sin to contract a Marriage by personation, as if it were in a Play
upon the Stage, by using equivocal expressions in the Church, when one is
forced thereunto by great fear. Add. Mist. of Jesuitism, p. 45.. 24.

So that you may learn how comfortable and holy these Sacred Doctrines of the
Jesuits are, and how far their Gospel does exceed that of Jesus Christ; for he
has made the way to Heaven so narrow, and the Gate so straight, that few can
enter in: whereas by the indulgence of these holy Fathers the way to Heaven is
made so broad, that the people may safely go thither without jostling one
another, and may with less pains go to Heaven than to Hell; and indeed let men
do what they will, they cannot (according to their pious doctrines) go to Hell;
for none go thither but for mortal sins: and how difficult a thing it is to sin
mortally, you may observe by what has been delivered unto you; and in case
they go to Hell, these great and learned Doctors have a holy knack, and
mysterious exorcism to fetch them out.

CHAP. VI. Of Directing the Intention of good and bad Intentions.
1. TO do evil, there must be an evil intention; but to do good, it is not
necessary to have a good intention. The Commands of God and the Church may be
satisfied by an outward execution of what they ordain, though it be done
without intention to fulfill them, or with an evil intent; and contrary to the
Commandment, and even with an express intention not to fulfill it, and on the
contrary, to render a man guilty of having violated the Commands of God, and
the Church, it is not sufficient to violate them, but it is required to have
thereof a formed design and express intention.

2. Ecclesiastics satisfy the Precept of the Church in saying Prayers, when
they sing or read them, though they do it without any inward intention or
devotion; provided they observe outward modesty and decency: nay the Precept is
satisfied, though the intention be express and formal not to satisfy it.
Bauny's sum. chapter 20. p. 335. Escob. tr. 5. exam. 6. c. 13. n. 136. p. 677. So
that the outward appearance is more necessary to Prayer, and to the actions of
Religion, then the inward motions of Piety; because they can subsist without
this inward motion, but not without external show: and we may perform the duty
of Prayer, though we have a formal design not to obey the Church, and to
despise its Commandment.

If a man fast for vainglory, or to content his sensuality in eating and
drinking Wine; and so act contrary to the intent of the Church, yet he does not
violate her Commands; for he that does in substance, that is to say, outwardly,
that which is commanded, satisfies truly the Commandment, though he has no
will to accomplish it, but rather contrary. Laym. lib. 1. tr. 4. c. 4. n. 6. p.
49.

3. If a man hears a Sermon, or be present at the Divine Office of the Church,
a bad intent thereunto joined, as an intent of looking on a Woman dishonestly,
is not contrary to the commandments of the Church, neither does he therein
sin, but fulfill the Precept of hearing Prayers. Fillut. mor. qq. Tom. 2. tr. 5.
c. 7. n. 2, 12. p. 128.

4. If a man speak never so dishonourably and irreverently of God, it is no
Blasphemy, if he had not a formal intent to blaspheme God and dishonor him.
Bauny's sum. c. 5. p. 66. Bonacina. d. 3. q. 8. p. 2. n. 2.

5. No man is responsible for the evil effects which are adherent to any
action, except he formerly intend and procure them; therefore though a Woman
knows that a man loves her dishonestly, she sins not, how often soever she
presents her self before him, and in his view, so as she has not an intent to
stir up the dishonest love which he has toward her. Fillut. To. 2. tr. 28. c.
10. n. 232. because he that loves her dishonestly, does rather take this
occasion of offense from his own malice, then she gives it him by the use of
her own right and liberty.

6. If a man be to do an act, and makes protestation that his intention is not
to do any evil; let the act be never so wicked, it is no sin in him. Bauny's
sum. c. 14. p. 219. Therefore to kill an Heretic, if your intention be to
propagate the Roman Catholic Faith it is no sin; and an Usurer who gives his
Money to interest to make profit thereof, may deliver himself from Usury and
Restitution, with protestation that it is not in his intention to make any
usurious contract, but to lend it him for his good, and that he would do
nothing therein against God and his Conscience. Bauny. ibidem.

7. A Mother which desires the death of her Daughters for want of Beauty or
Portions, because she cannot make them according to her desire, or because
perhaps by occasion of them, she is ill treated by her Husband; this good
intention of the Mother is sufficient to excuse the Mother from all sin, who
desires the death of the daughters. Bonacina. d. 3. q. 4. n. 7.

8. If a Servant by the command of his Master goes and tells a Woman with whom
he knows his Master intends to commit Adultery, that his Master will be found
at home such an hour; or if by the command of his Master he follows a Damosel
to see and enquire where she lodges, if by his command he does not only open
the door, but show her where his Master is, if he aid his Master to get up by
the Window to enter the house where he is to commit the sin, the Servant by
directing his intention, may free himself of any such or the like sin; by
intending that he did it for some good end, as for the just reward which he
expected, or for fear of the loss of his Master's favor, or some other damage:
and protesting that he is not pleased with this sin of his Master. Tamb. lib.
5. decal. c. 1. sect. 4. n. 30.

9. You may desire the death of an Enemy who might do you much hurt, not of
hatred to him, but to avoid the damage and hurt which he would do you; you may
also rejoice in his death, because of the good which you receive thereby. Em.
Sa. verb. charitat. n. 8. p. 65. And all this may be done without sin, by that
excellent Science of directing the Intention.

10. To lie with a Woman (by the rule of directing the Intention) whom he
represents to himself as under a condition, and as if he were married to her,
is a thing which is not ill, and which on the contrary is good. Sanch. op. mor.
lib. 1. c. 2. n. 34. p. 9. Fillut. mor. Tom. 2. tr. 21. c. 8. n. 269. p. 27.

11. It Is lawful for persons of all qualities, conditions and sexes, to go to
the the Stews or places of common prostitution, (intending to convert Women)
though it be very probable (as frequently before) they will there commit sins
themselves. Mist. of Jesuitism. p. 146, 147.

12. If any man has done me an injury or wrong, I may pursue him, not with an
intention to be revenged of him, or to render evil for evil, but out of an
intention to preserve my honor. Reginaldus in praxi. lib. 21. n. 62. p. 260.
There is no more to be done, than to divert the Intention from the desire of
Revenge, which is sinful, to incline it to a desire of maintaining our honor,
which is allowable; and by this means you may acquit your self of all
obligation both toward God, and toward Man, for you satisfy the World by
permitting the action, and satisfy the Gospel by purifying the intention.

13. A man may accept of a Challenge and fight a Duel in maintenance of his
honor; and come to the place appointed, not with an express intention to fight
the Duel, but only with that of defending himself, if he, by whom he was
challenged, comes unjustly to set upon him; for what hurt can there be for a
man to go into the Field to walk there, in expectation of another, and to
defend himself if any one sets upon him? it is no sin at all; for when the
intention is directed to other circumstances, the Challenge is not at all
accepted; for the acceptance of a Challenge consists in the express intention
of fighting, which such a man has not. Provincial Letter. 7.

14. In the Indies in China, they allow their proselyte Christians to commit
Idolatry by this craft, viz. that of enjoining them, to hide under their
clothes an Image of Jesus Christ, to which they teach them by a mental
reservation to direct those public adorations, which they render the Idol.
Cachins. Choan. Succum. Myster. of Jesuit. lib. 5. p. 53, 54.

CHAP. VII. Of Adultery, Fornication.
1. VIrgins have power to dispose of their Virginity without the consent of
Parents; for when that is done with the consent of the Maid, though the Father
has just cause to be troubled at it, yet neither she, nor the person to whom
she has prostituted her self, has done him any injury, nor as to what
concerns him, violated any Law; for the Maid is in possession of her Virginity
as well as of her body, she may dispose of it, as she pleases, and to whom she
pleases, death or mutilation of member only excepted. Bauny's Sum. p. 148.

2. It Is no sin to let a House to a Whore, though he knows she will abuse his
House to sin; because he let his House to lodge in, and not to prostitute her
self therein. Molina de Inst. and Jur. To. 2. tr. 2. disp. 500. p. 1122. Gre.
Valentia. Tom. 3. d. 5. q. 21. Escob. tr. 3. Exam. 9. c. 4. n. 28. 8, 9. p. 155.

3. To lie with a married Woman is not Adultery, if the Husband does consent
thereunto. Addit. to the Mist. of Jesuit. p. 110.. 3.

4. If a Woman presents her self to the view of a man whom she knows to love
her dishonestly, does not commit any mortal sin, because she is not obliged to
deprive her self of the liberty of standing at a Door or a Window, or to walk
forth into the Town. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c. 6. n. 16 p. 19.

5. To lie with a Woman considered as ones Wife, is no sin; for the pleasure
that the Will takes in a thing which is represented to it as good, is no mortal
sin. Escob. tr. 3. Exam. 9. c. 4. n. 28. Therefore the Will may without mortal
sin, not only desire this action, considered in this manner, but may regard it
simply with pleasure. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c. 2. n. 34. p. 9. Filut. mor.
Tom. 2. tr. 21. c. 8. n. 269. p. 27.

6. An Ecclesiastic is not faulty who procures an abortion, if he doubts
whether the fruit of the Womb were quick. Mist. Jesuitis. addit. p. 93.. 13.

7. That which one receives for being a Pander to a debauched person, or for
committing of Fornication, he is not bound to any restitution, but may
conscionably be detained, if the fact be already done. Filut. mor. 22. Tom. 2.
tr. 32. c. 4. n. 103. p. 364.

8. If a drunken or madman lies with a Woman, it is no mortal sin, because
there was no use of reason, and the action without liberty, and therefore
indifferent as the coupling of Beasts. Filut. mor. tr. 21. c. 5. n. 290. p. 34.

9. If a Peasant has heard it said by a man that is in reputation for a
knowing or honest man, That Fornication is sin, but the desire of it is lawful;
this interior act of Concupiscence is exempt from sin, because the opinion was
probable. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c. 16. p. 71.

10. There may be a dispensation granted for Fornication, because it is not
evident that it is forbidden by the Law of Nature; and it is probable that it is
only by the positive Law. Tamb. lib. 7. decal. c. 1. s. 2. n. 1. And so it may
be made lawful when Authority shall think it convenient to take away the
prohibition, which alone renders it evil and criminal.

11. A man may be invincibly ignorant that Fornication is a sin; and in that
case if he does commit Fornication, it is no sin, because invincible ignorance
excuses from sin, therefore a man in state of ignorance may commit Fornication
without sin. Fillut. mor. Tom. 2. tr. 30. c. 2. n. 50. p. 389. Azor. Tom. 1.
lib. 1. c. 13. p. 34.

12. Masters and Maid Servants, and Cosins of both Sexes living together, and
mutually induced by that means unto sin, if their relapses be but once or twice
a month, they may continue therein, when they cannot avoid them without
finding the World matter of discourse, or running into some inconvenience
thereby. Mist. of Jesuit. p. 146.

13. If the Concubine be very useful to the Fornicator to cherish him, and to
keep him in good humor, so that without her he lives in Melancholy, and has
great distaste of the food which is prepared for him; he cannot be obliged in
this case to put away his Concubine, because his satisfaction in these
circumstances are more worth than any temporal good. Sanctius in select. disp.
10. n. 20.

14. If you be desired by your Friend to carry a Present to be given on the
account of dishonest love, unto a Concubine, to whom he sends it, you may carry
it without sin, if you have a just cause of fearing a considerable loss. Tamb.
lib. decal. c. 1. s. 4. n. 30. as the loss of your Friend.

15. Absolution may be given a Woman who entertains at her house a man with
whom she offends frequently, if she cannot handsomely send him away. Bauny's
Theol mor. p. 1. tr. 4. de poenit. q. 14. p. 94.

16. It Is lawful for a married woman to retain to her self the price of her
Adultery; and the reason is excellent, because the Husband is not so Master of
the body of his Wife, that he has a perfect dominion over it; but he has only
the power to use it according to the Law of Marriage, which certainly takes not
from the Woman power to gain something by prostituting her Body. Tamb. lib. 1.
decal. c. 2. s. 6. n. 12.

17. If a Concubine dies or withdraws her self, it is lawful for the Man to take
another Maidservant, what fear soever he has of falling into sin with her, if
he cannot find some other who is capable to assist him in his affairs and
conveniences; for if this reason dispense with him for not putting her away
whom he has already taken, it will give him a right to take her whom he has
not as yet. Sanct. select. disp. 10. n. 20.

18. By the Bull Cruciata, a man may be dispensed with the vow he has made not
to commit Fornication or any other sin. Addit. to the Mystery of Jesuitism. p.
95.. 25.

CHAP. VIII. Of Murder.
1. It Is lawful for an honorable person to kill an assailant who would strike
him with a Cudgel, or give him a box on the ear to affront him, if he cannot
otherwise avoid the disgrace. Lessius de Justitia and Jure, lib. 2. c. 9. dub.
8. n. 41. p. 83. otherwise the reputation of the innocent person would be
perpetually exposed to the affronts of the insolent. Azor. Inst. mor. par. 3.
p. 105. Hurtado de Mendoza 22. disp. 170. s. 16.. 137.

2. If a man endeavor to deprive me of my honor before a Prince, Judge or
person of great quality, by accusing me of some feigned crimes, and I have no
other way to divert this loss of reputation, it is lawful for me to kill him
secretly. Less. lib. 2. c. 9. dub. 12. n. 77. p. 81. And the same may be done
against him, though the crime be true, so it be hid and secret. Bannes. q. 64.
a. 7. dub. 4. And Molina gives the reason, because it is lawful to employ all
sorts of means, and to make use of all sorts of ways, and of all sorts of Arms,
to do that which is necessary for self-defence. Molina. de Just. and Jure. Tom.
4. tr. 3. disp. 2. n. 5. p. 175.

3. To defend our selves from an affront which would be given us, it is lawful
to prevent the aggressor by killing him, in the same manner as when a man
endeavors to deprive us unjustly of life or member, it is lawful to kill him
before he execute his design. Amicus, Tom. 5. de Justi. and Jure, disp. 36. s.
7. n. 106. p. 542, 410, 407.

4. It any person does unjustly detain your goods from you, you may kill him
when you cannot without great trouble and difficulty recover them by the way of
Justice. Less. de just. and jure, lib. 2. c. 9. dub. 11. n. 70. Dicast. lib. 2.
tr. 1. disp. 10. dub. 5. n. 46. This is an excellent invention to cut off all
Suits, there is no need of Judges or Counselors; but any may do themselves
Justice; and instead of sending a Sergeant to arrest the party who detains the
goods, he may send one to take away his life.

5. If any person shall take from you an Apple, or any thing to the value of
five shillings, and will not restore it, if it will be a shame to you not to
take it out of the Thief's hand, you may endeavor to take it from him, and
even kill him if it be necessary. Less. de Just. and Jure. lib. 2. c. 4. c. 9.
d. 11. n. 68. p. 88.

6. If a man has committed a crime which is not publicly known, and he
understands that another has a design to inform against him, before a
Magistrate, if he fears lest his Accuser should cause him to be condemned to
lose his life, or goods, he may lawfully kill him. Molina de Just. and Jure,
Tom. 4. tr. 3. n. 39. p. 121. Dicast. lib. 2. tr. 2. disp. 12. par. dub. 2. n.
410.

7. It Is no Murder to kill excommunicated persons. Great. cause. 23. q. 5. c.
omnium and exam. fo. 460. Edit. Paris. 1531.

8. It Is lawful to kill all those who do us wrong, and all other persons who
offend us, though we be assured that they shall be damned by dying in that
state. Escob. tr. 1. exam. 7. c. 2. p. 1154. s. 1. n. 21. And this right does
not only appertain to one private man, against another private man, but to a
public person; to a Subject against his Prince or Superior; to a Son against
his Father, or the Father against the Son. Amicus de Just. et Jure, disp. 36.
s. 5. n. 76. p. 407.

9. If any person shall endeavor to take away from you your Estate unjustly by
foul practices and vexatious Suits at Law; it is lawful to accept or give a
Challenge; nay, a man may dispatch his enemy at unawares; nay in such
occurrences a man need not confine himself to the ordinary ways of Duels, if he
can secretly murder his adversary, and thereby put an end to the business; for
by that means he shall not only avoid the hazard he may be in, by exposing his
life in sighting, but also not participate of the sin which his enemy would
commit by the Duel. Sanch. Theol. mor. lib. 2. c. 39. n. 7. Provinc. Letter, 7.
fo. 90. So if persons shall conspire to ruin you, or shall unjustly hinder your
Creditors from paying you what they owe unto you, it is lawful for you to kill
them. Less. de Just. and Jure, lib. 2. c. 11. n. 67. p. 88.

10. A man may lawfully kill (by ambush and behind his back) an Informer that
prosecutes us in any Court, provided there be a right direction of the
Intention; he may lawfully kill the false witness which such a prosecutor
produces against him; and the Judge also, if there be any correspondency
between him and the witness. Molina, Tom. 4. tr. 3. disp. 12. Reginaldus, lib.
21. c. 5. n. 57. Tannerus, tr. 3. disp 4. q. 8. n. 83. Provinc. Letter, 7. fo.

11. A Priest is obliged to kill a Detractor. Mist. of Jesuit. p. 94. 97.

12. If a man has made use of a woman, he may kill her if she offer to
discover what passed between them. Mist. of Jesuitism, p. 18.. 6. Caramuel.
fund. 55 s. 7. p. 551.

13. When he who is assaulted be a person whose life is of importance, and
necessary to the weal public and others, whether it be in Temporals or
Spirituals, he is obliged under mortal sin to kill if he can the aggressor in
defense of his life. Molina de Just. Commutat. tr. 3. d. 14. p. 1754; because
he cannot give away the right of those who belong unto him, to whom his life is
necessary, being obliged to maintain and defend them; therefore he sins
mortally in not killing the aggressor if he can, for the preservation of his
life.

14. He commits not the sin of Manslaughter, who kills him who invades him
unjustly, though he gave him an occasion to assault him. Amicus de Just. and
Jure, disp. 36. dub. 5. n. 25. p. 538. And when it is lawful to kill an invader,
it is lawful to desire his death, as a means necessary for our defense. Dicast.

15. It Is lawful to kill him who says to you, You lie. Bandellus, lib. 3. disp.
24. n. 24. Provincial Letter. 7. fo. 93.

16. An Adulterer may lawfully kill the Husband of a Woman with whom he has
committed adultery, if her Husband, having surprised him in the fact, does
assault him. Molina de Just. and Jure, Tom. 4. disp. 14 p. 1765. Tamb. lib. 16.
decal, c. 1. sect. 1. n. 7. This is an excellent way for an Adulterer to
expiate his crime, by making away the Husband's life, after he has taken away
the Wifes honor.

17. A Thief being entered into a House to steal, may in consequence kill him
who would kill him for his Theft, if he cannot escape death. Molina de Justitia
and Jure, Tom. 4. p. 1766. n. 2.

18. If a Thief fly away on Horseback, he may be pursued with a Weapon, or
killed with a Pistol-shot, when after he has been threatened to be killed, he
cease not to bear away what he has taken; and though he be not threatened nor
admonished thereof, because time permit not, and there is danger never to
recover what he carries away. Dicast. lib. 2. tr. 1. disp. 10. dub. 5. n. 46.

19. It Is not against charity to kill a Thief who robs me of things which I
cannot recover at Law without much trouble. Dicast. ibidem.

20. If an honorable person be assaulted, and in danger to lose his
reputation, if he fly, though by flying he might preserve his own life, and his
who assaults him, he is not for all that obliged to fly; but it is lawful to
kill him, who invades him unjustly in defense of his life and honor. Mol. Tom.
4. p. 1778. For when a man has only his honor to defend, he is not obliged to
fly, because he is to set more by his honor, than money or goods; therefore
there is no reason to oblige Christians to lose possession of so precious a
thing as Honor; by flying from him who assaults them so unjustly.

21. It Is lawful to kill a slanderer or false witness secretly in an affair,
wherein not only life, but even outward goods also of great importance are in
question. Amic. Tom. 5. de Just. and Jure, disp. 36. sect. 4. n. 76. p. 537.

22. If any one assault you, and makes use of an innocent person to shelter
him, you may kill him, that you may hit him who invades you. Escob. tr. 1. exam
7. n. 52. p. 121. If a man fly from his enemy and cannot escape but through
some strait way, wherein he will crush to death some Infant or lame person, he
may kill or ride over him, though he be assured that he will die thereof;
because every man has right to defend himself, and his meeting with or
interposure of an innocent person does not take away his right. Less. de Just.
lib. 2. c. 9. dub. 9. n. 57. p. 86.

You may observe how highly this new Theology of the Jesuits has obliged the
World, in granting this liberty to defend men's lives, honors and goods against
any aggressor, which the Gospel of Jesus Christ has denied unto them. By this
Indulgence people are kept in obedience from invading the rights of others, and
peace established amongst them, for fear of offending, when the person
offended, is both Judge, Party, and Executioner; by their divinity you may kill
an Enemy, a Slanderer, a Thief, an Informer in false crimes, and even in true
ones, but secret; and which is yet more, an innocent person, and from whom you
never received any displeasure; an Infant, a Prince, a King, without excepting
Fathers or Mothers; you may Challenge into the fields, assassinate publicly,
kill by surprise, cause to die secret, by poison or otherwise, for preservation
of the life, honor or goods, and even for the least thing, as for an Apple;
and all these without sin or punishment; what mortals can desire more, we know
not.

CHAP. IX. Of Theft.
1. THeft is no mortal sin, if he that steals does believe that his Father,
Master or he from whom he steals the goods, would have given him them, if he
had asked him, or if he had known he had need of them, or when he makes no
account of the goods which are stolen from them, or when he is of such a
disposition, that he would not have him that had stolen them from him, obliged
therefore to any great punishment. Less. de Just. and Jure, lib. 2. c. 41. d.
9. n. 79. p. 496.

2. Theft, which Men and Maidservants commit in Meats and Drinks, are no great
sins, though insensibly they amount unto a notable value; if they steal them
only to eat and drink them, themselves. Less. de Just. and Jure, lib. 2. c. 12.

5. He who takes what is another, does him no wrong if he made no use of it,
or was not like to use it; neither is he obliged to restitution. Em. Sa. verbo,
Furtum. c. 6. p. 292.

6. He who steals frequently by little at a time, so to gather together a
notable sum, is not obliged to restitution when it is not done with intention to
steal this great sum. Exam. Sa. verb. Furtum, n. 8. Escob. tr. 1. Exam. 4. n.

7. Where a man has by many petty Thefts proceeded unto a great sum, he is not
obliged under pain of damnation to restore any of it, because he only sinned
venially. Bauny in his Sum. c. 10. p. 143. By this a man may enrich himself
with the goods of another, provided he takes not too much at once.

8. If a man finds any thing which does belong to another, he may appropriate
it to himself; and though the true owner appears afterward, he is not obliged
to quit the possession of it; and if he shall alienate or spend it without
fraud or unjust contrivance simply and honestly, the Owner comes and presents
himself, he is not obliged to restore any thing unto him, but what he has put
out to use, and whereby he is become more wealthy. Bauny in his Sum. c. 13. p.

CHAP. X. Of Deceit.
1. AVintner who has better Wine than ordinary, for that he may not sell it by
reason of some public order, above the common price, he may recompense
himself therein by mingling water therewith, because those who buy this Wine
have no prejudice thereby. Escob. tr. 3. exam. 6. n. 70. p. 423. The same may
be done with grain, he may mingle so much of Rye with his Wheat to reduce it to
the quality of common grain which is sold at the same price with his. Amicus de
Just. and Jure, disp. 21. sect. 6. n. 87. p. 282.

2. A Treasurer, a Factor, Solicitor, a Servant, and such like, may Traffic
with their Master's Money without his privity, and retain the profit for
themselves. Escob. tr. 3. exam. 4. n. 95. p. 392.

3. A Tailor who has been accustomed to buy Cloth or Silk by command from
another to make his clothes, goes on this occasion most commonly to a Shop of
a Merchant, who for this reason sells him a good pennyworth; the Tailor may
retain to himself the benefit of his good Market; because the Merchant finds
his advantage therein, therefore the Tailor ought to have his advantage
thereof. Secondly, because this practice is past into a custom. Fillut. Tom. 2.
tr. 35. c. 6. n. 149. Escob. tr. 3. exam. 6. n. 60. p. 421.

4. If the Magistrate has regulated the Price and Weights of Flesh, and the
Measures of Wine, so that the price is not sufficient for the charge, and for
their pains, and the ways of those who sell these Merchandises, they may
diminish the weight and the measure so far, as is necessary, to satisfy all
these things. Amicus, de Just. and Jure, d. 21. sect. 6. n. 87. p. 282. And
being examined by a Judge, whether he has sold it too dear, or has changed
the Weight or Measures, he may say he has not, and assure him, That he has
sold according to the price appointed, and that he has observed the weight and
measure intending, according to the money that he has received. Sanch. op.
mor. lib. 3. c. 6. n. 29. p. 28.

5. If one thinks and probably believes that the price which is set upon any
Merchandise, is unjust, and that for this reason, he who sells recompenses
himself for this injustice by selling by false Weights, or by some other way,
being afterward examined by a Judge upon these facts, he may deny all upon
oath. Escob. tr. 1. exam. 3. n. 34. p. 75.

6. If a man has run into debt to supply his debaucheries, he may frustrate
all his Creditors, and continue to live in luxury, by renouncing his estate;
for he that renounceth his estate with safety to his Conscience, may retain so
much thereof, as is necessary for him and his Family to live in honor. Escob.
tr. 3. exam. 2. n. 163.

7. If a man gets money unjustly, and mingles it with his other the like money
which did belong unto him, insomuch that one cannot distinguish them; by this
means he gains to himself the property of the money, and is become the just
owner and lawful possessor of it: Therefore if a Merchant or Tradesman has
received more money of his Customers than is due to him, if he mingles this with
his other money that they cannot be distinguished from each other, the party who
has paid this money comes to the Merchant and demands it, he is not obliged to
repay it; because that he received it in payment and so took it on good
account, and in honest simplicity. Esc. tr. 3. exam. 2. n. 107. p. 362. Vasquez
de Restitutione, c. 9. sect. 2. dubium ultimum.

8. When Children are grown up and are employed by their Fathers in their
Shops, Trades, or other their Affairs, if their Fathers do not content them and
give them a just recompense for their pains, it is lawful for them in conscience
to take so much of their Father's Goods secretly for their recompense according
to the proportion of their labor and pains. Escob. tr. 1. exam. 10. n. 31. p.
163. So that Children are permitted to estimate and rate their own labor and
pains, and pay themselves with their own hands; and this estimation depends on
their own Judgments and Wills.

9. Cheating is lawful by virtue of the contract Moliatra: as when a man buys a
Commodity for 30 l. to be paid within a year, and then sells it immediately to
him of whom he bought it, for half so much money. Mist. of Jesuit. p. 10.

He who prudently makes use of these Maxims of the divinity of the Jesuits,
may do all his affairs by deceit, and yet not pass for all that for a Cheat;
and it is but reasonable, that if a Butcher, Vintner, or other person be ill
husbands, or an ill chapman, or suffer himself to be cheated or buy too dear,
that the Public pay for all this: for if the Merchant be an ill buyer, he may
be a wicked seller; and cheat in selling, because he was cheated in buying.

CHAP. XI. Of Oaths, Promises, mental Reservations, and of Equivocations.
IN conduct of affairs to be well instructed in the subtilities and inventions
of the Jesuits are of great use; which may be referred to equivocations in
words; and want of intention in Oaths and Promises: The one is a means to say
what you will without lying; and the other an expedient to swear and promise
all things without being obliged to perform any thing.

1. A man may make a promise without any intention to promise; but in case he
had an intention to promise, but no intention to perform, then he is obliged to
his promise, but not obliged to perform what he promised; the same of an oath.
Sanch. op. mor. lib. 3. c. 10. n. 7, 8. p. 42. Gr. Valentia. 22. d. 6. q. 6. p.
1.

2. A man may make a promise without any intention to promise, and so he is not
obliged to perform; because he had no intention to promise: and therefore if he
be asked if he made any such promise, he may with a safe conscience say, No;
intending that he had not promised by any promise to oblige him; and by
consequence he may also swear; for otherwise he should be constrained to pay
that which he owes not. Fillut. Tom. 2. tr. 25. n. 323. p. 161. And therefore
he may safely say, That he owes not that which he has promised, and that he
lies not, in forswearing it; because, in promising and in swearing, he had no
intention to promise or swear, no more than to perform what he promised.

3. If you have made a promise or an oath, and you doubt whether you had an
intent to oblige your self; it is probable you are not obliged to keep it. Tamb.
decal. 1. c. 3. sect. 7. tit. V. n. 6.

4. To feign in an important matter, and to vow only with ones lips, is but a
venial sin, because it is only a lie which contains no irreverence toward God.
Tamb. decal. 3. c. 12. sect. 1. n. 3.

5. If to promise without an intention to promise, and to promise without an
intention to do what is promised, be not sufficient, the better to carry on
designs, and to cause your projections to prosper, and to gain belief, it is
lawful to add an oath.

6. He who desires not to swear, (the better to obtain belief) may find out
many ways to speak, and to affirm, which passes commonly for oaths, but
indeed are not; as for example, If I swear by God, wherefore do you not believe
me? If this be not, I have no faith in God, I renounce God. This is as true as
the Gospel; Before God this is so; God knows it is so; On my faith, by my faith,
God be my witness; I may swear by God, by Jesus Christ; I will swear by God;
though the ignorant, and those who do not look nearly to them, take these
speeches for oaths, but they are not, because they assert nothing, and they are
imperfect discourses, and have no determined sense. Escob. tr. 1. Exam. 3. n.
17. p. 72. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 3. c. 2. n. 16, 17, 19, 20. p. 8.

7. When one is resolved to swear, you may choose words of double meaning, and
make use of a mental restriction the better to effect your ends; and this is
warrantable according to the most Learned Doctors amongst the Jesuits: for no
man is obliged by virtue of his oath, beyond his intention; for an oath cannot
oblige in conscience beyond the intent of him which swears; and by consequence
he that has no intention to swear, cannot be obliged to any thing at all.
Sanch. op. mor. lib 2. c. 10. n. 12, 13. p 49.

8. The art of mental restriction or reservation, is an art of great use, and
must be well studied, and none can teach the Theorie or Practice of it so well
as the Jesuits; they being the great Doctors of the faculty of Equivocation.
This doctrine shall be illustrated by some few Examples; If a promise by oath
to pay a certain sum of Money, be drawn from a man unjustly, or by force, he
that swears in this manner, may use an equivocation in these terms; I swear to
you, I will, give this money; intending that he would give it to him, to whom he
swear, or to some other; because these words may receive either of these two
senses. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 2. c. 10. n. 37. p. 29.

If a Woman be excommunicated for departing from her Husband, because she knows
of some secret impediment which makes the Marriage void, being at the point of
death, she is obliged, that she may receive absolution to swear, That if she
recover her health, she will return to her Husband; she may promise and swear
it, intending in her mind, If I be obliged thereunto, or if it shall please me
at that time. Sanch. lib. 3. c. 6. n. 40. p. 30.

9. If in the tongue in which one express an oath, the name of God signify
diverse things, it will be lawful to swear by the Name of God, taking it in some
other signification: According to this rule a man may safely swear by the Name
of Jesus Christ, because there are others named Jesus, besides the Son of God,
and that this word, Christ, is attributed to diverse Persons in Scripture, and
that not only Christians, but to Jews.

10. When one is required to make oath unto a person in a case in which he
believes that he is not obliged to swear; he may do it without fear of Perjury;
he may make use of the one or the other of these two expedients; First to take
the words wholly he uses in swearing, and which are false in their true sense,
in a quite different sense, such as he pleases, provided it be true: Secondly,
to give no sense at all to his words, and to take them materially, that is to
say, as sounds which signify nothing. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 3. c. 6. n. 10. p.
24.

11. If a person be ignorant, and cannot make right use of mental reservation,
upon occasion, he may swear plainly without obliging himself in any sort
whatsoever, provided he has no intent to swear, nor to perform that which he
swears. Escobar. tr. 1. exam. 1. n. 37. p. 76.

12. To establish this knowledge of equivocation in the World, and to facilitate
the practice of it amongst all sorts of people, the Jesuits have delivered to
their disciples diverse excellent rules, and examples for the perfecting of them
in this mavelous art of equivocation; therefore, if you be asked, If you have
eaten of such a dish; you may answer, I have not eaten of such a dish;
intending in your mind, to day; though the intention of him that asked, was to
know it you had ever eaten of it. Fillut. op. mor. Tom. 2. tr. 25. c. 11. n.
327. p. 204.

If one enquire whether the Prince be at Court, he may say and swear it too,
without any great sin, that he is there, (though he be not there) intending
that he is there in picture. Escob. tr. 1. exam. 1. n. 35. p. 76.

If one demands of a man to borrow money, which he indeed has, but which he
will not, and which he is not obliged to lend; he may swear that he has it not
at all; meaning not to lend him, or meaning not in another place than in that
where he laid it up to be kept. Fillut. op. mor. Tom. 2. tr. 25. c. 11. n. 15.

If a Witness be interrogated juridically if he know a thing; provided the
Judge ask him not whether he has heard it spoken; he may swear he knows it
not, having only heard it spoken. Fillut. op. mor. Tom. 2. tr. 25. c. 7. n. 5.
p. 32.

If he be interrogated by a Judge, Whether he had done such a thing? he may
safely swear he has not done it, when he has done it; intending in his mind
some other thing, which he has not in truth done, or some other day than that
on which he did it, or some other circumstance as he pleases, so it be true; he
does not lie, neither is he forsworn. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 3. c. 6. n. 15. This
is a rare way to justify all manner of lies, and perjuries: The greatest
Impostors may make use hereof to maintain themselves in these crimes.

And it is always justifiable when necessary, or advantageous in any thing that
concerns a man's Health, Honor or Estate. Zanch. op. mor. p. 2. lib. 3. c. 6.
n 12. Provinc. Letter. 9.. 129, 130. Fillutius assigns a way much more secure
than the former, to avoid lying; and that is when a man having said, I swear I
have not done such a thing, he adds, whispering to himself, this day. Fillut.
tr. 25. c. 11. n. 331. This is to speak truth toward himself, and lie to
others. Men will be often at a loss if they have not this Science.

13. It Is not enough to know the Rules of any Mystery, if it be not known how
to reduce them to practice.

Therefore there are two Rules given by the Jesuits, that men may have change,
and make use sometimes of one, and sometimes of the other.

The first is, to have an intention to pronounce the words materially, that is
to say, as if they signified nothing; and to take from them in his mind their
proper signification not desiring they should have any at all. And that this
method may be made easy to understand, take this example: If a man be
interrogated by a Judge if he did such a fact; he may safely swear he did it
not; with this mental restriction (this day), though he did it at another day.
Fillut. op. mor. Tom. 2. tr. 25. c. 12. n. 328. p. 204.

The second rule or method is, To have an Intention to compose ones discourse,
not only of words, which are audibly pronounced, but also of those which are
secretly reserved in ones mind, it being free for those who speak, to express
their thoughts wholly or in part. Fillut. ibidem.

14. It Is lawful in our defense at all times to make use of equivocation,
though he who does examine us, do press us and make us swear not to use them,
but to answer him without making use of equivocation: he may safely swear,
understanding secretly that he does it as far as he is obliged to speak
clearly, and to expound himself, or by forming some other thought, which may
make him answer true. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 3. c. 6. n. 45. p. 30.

If any one be examined by a Judge if he did such a thing; he may swear he has
not done it; intending his answer, Not in that manner as the Judge examins him
maliciously, but in the manner he ought to examine him in the quality of a
Judge. Sanch. ibidem.

15. When a Prince commands a Subject to do such a thing when he receives his
orders, he promises to obey him; though he be resolved to do nothing of that he
shall command him, by making use of this mental restriction, saying in himself,
I will do this not as you command me, but as you ought to command me. Sanch.
ibidem.

16. A Wife or Children being called before a Judge to declare and confess what
they have put aside or taken out from, or usurped of the movables or Goods of
the deceased, are not in conscience obliged to confess, or declare the same;
but because they may be brought to swear, they may make use of this expedient
that they may not lie, and so doing forswear themselves, the prudent Confessor
may teach them that they are to frame a conception in their mind, according to
which they may form their answer and oath, which they may make by the command
of the Judge, to justify and make him believe their innocence. Bauny his Sum.
c. 11. p. 156.

17. One is discharged of his oath, though in doing what he swears to do, he
has an express intent not to do or fulfill it. Less. lib. 1. c. 37. d. 10. n.
59.

18. If I swear to do such an act, and have no intention to swear, though I do
not perform the act, I am not forsworn, because an oath depends on the
intention of him who swears. Em. Sa. verb. Jurament. n. 1. p. 295.

19. If a man lies in using equivocation without any necessity obliging him
thereunto, and swears to confirm this Equivocation, he does neither lie nor
commit perjury; because he that speaks and swears in that sort, has no
intention to speak or swear falsely. Fillut. To. 2. tr. 25. c. 11. n 331. p.
205. This Maxim is of admirable use to license the Lies and Oaths which some do
make use of ordinarily to deceive others, and those who forswear themselves
before Judges.

20. Oaths, which are made without actual advertency and consideration, which
of themselves are sufficient to a mortal sin, are not of themselves new sins
properly, because of the custom of swearing, how great soever they be, though
no retraction be made of them. Sanch. mor. par. 1. lib. 3. c. 5, 8, 28. p. 21.

21. If one commit Perjury through natural inadvertency, or because of an ill
custom he has to forswear, it is no mortal sin; because he does forswear
himself without perceiving it at all. Fillut. mor. To 2. tr. 25 c. 1. p. 173.

22. When a man blasphemes customarily without having full knowledge thereof, he
does not sin mortally. Fill. ibidem.

23. It Is a less sin to swear in common talk by the holy Name of God, than it is
to eat an Egg in Lent. Sanch. Fillut.

24. It Is lawful as well in Judgment as out of Judgment, to swear with a mental
reservation without any regard to the intent of him who obliges a man to swear.
Mist. of Jesuit. p. 10.

25. To call God to witness to a light inconsiderable Lie, is not so great an
irreverence, as that a man should or must be damned for it. Mist. of Jesuitism,
p. 10. s. 5.

CHAP. XII. Of the Doctrine of Probability.
1. THat Opinion is probable which has one only Author of Reputation, or one
reason to maintain it; and that which is supported by a probable opinion, is
simply good and lawful; and a man may safely in Conscience act by it. Em. Sa.
verbo Dubium. n. 3. p. 183. Nay, though many Doctors do positively hold the
contrary, yet if any one Doctor who has examined and weighed the Reasons of
those who hold the contrary, does say, That the action is good and lawful; the
opinion is probable, and you may in Conscience act by it. Therefore if a
Priest, of whom I have a good opinion for his integrity and parts, shall tell
you; It Is lawful for you to burn a City or any other place, though it be
against the Principles of Justice or Charity; yet to you it is probable, and so
you may safely fire the City without sin: And the most universally condemned
Crimes may become lawful to you for to act, if a Priest in whom you have a
Confidence for his Learning and Honesty, shall tell you they are lawful. Escob.
in praefat. Theolog. problemat. And in case you have a great desire to do any
thing, and can find no opinion to rely on, and to assure you it is probable;
it is enough that you are probably assured, that the opinion is probable; so
that probability is not only sufficient to excuse sin, but probability of a
probability. Tamb. lib. 1. decal. c. 3. sect. 3. n. 126.

2. When two opinions are probable, the one as well as the other, we may justly
prefer in the practice that which is less probable, though not so safe, if you
like it best, or may be more acceptable to others. Azor. lib. 2. c. 16. p. 126.
Dicast. de Confessione, tr. 4. d. 9. d. 8. n. 134. A Councellor at Law may
counsel his Client that advises with him, not according to his own opinion,
but the contrary which other Counselors hold probable, if it be more
favorable and acceptable to the Client, though he does know and believe
assuredly that the opinion of the other Councellor is false in the Theory, and
therefore not to be followed in the Practice. Layman. lib. 1. tr. 1. c. 5. Nay,
a Learned Councellor may give to Plaintiff and Defendent, counsels quite
contrary according to contrary probable opinions. Layman. ibidem. Sanch. op.
mor. lib. 1. c. 9. n. 20.

3. It Is lawful in Conscience for a man to quit his own proper opinion, though
more probable to follow the probable opinion of another though less sure;
because, he who believes an opinion probable, acting according to that opinion,
ought not to be deemed as rash and imprudent: Upon this Principle Pilat acted
when he put Jesus Christ to death, quitting his proper Judgment, by which he
believed him to be innocent, to follow the opinion of the Jews, who maintained
that he was worthy of death. Nay, Pilat herein, according to the Jesuits, ought
to be justified, because he followed a probable Opinion, and more than
probable, because it was not the opinion of one Doctor, but of all the Doctors
and Priests of the Jews, That Jesus was a Malefactor and deserved death. Matthew.
25.

4. When one believes assuredly that an Opinion is false, and that we cannot
follow it directly in the conduct of some person, we may send this person to
those who hold with it, and counsel him to follow their advice. Layman. lib. 1.
c. 5. p. 7.

5. If you meet with two contrary Opinions, you may follow them both in
different affairs, and even in the same affair also, acting and giving contrary
counsels, now after the one, and then after the other. Layman. lib. 1. c. 5. p.
6.

6. A man may hold an opinion probable, when he is persuaded that he himself or
some other can answer the reasons upon which that opinion is grounded; and it is
safe in Conscience to act according to such a probable opinion. Sanch. op. mor.
lib. 1. c. 9. n. 6. p. 28.

7. When a Superior and those which are under his charge be of different
opinions, the Inferior is not bound to obey his Superior: and therefore when a
Subject believes according to a probable opinion, that the Commands of his
Prince are unjust, or that he exceeds the bounds of his Jurisdiction, he may
disobey him, because it is lawful for all men to follow a probable opinion.
Escob. in praem. Exam. 3. n. 31. p. 30.

8. The privileges of Probability cannot only dispense with an Inferior for
the obedience which he owes to his Superior, but may elevate him above his
Superior, and to oblige the Superior to obey his Subject. Upon this Principle a
Confessor is obliged to follow the probable opinion of his Penitent, and quit
his own opinion, though more probable; because the Penitent grounding himself
upon a probable opinion, has a right unto absolution. Escob. in praem. Exam.
3. c. 6. n. 27. p. 25. And the Confessor is obliged to absolve the Penitent
against his own proper opinion, when the Penitent following the Maxims of a
probable opinion, believes that he may do that, which the Confessor believes he
may not do, according to his probable opinion. Amicus. Tom. 3. disp. 15. sect.
2. n. 90. p. 212.

9. It Is probable that an Excise is justly established by a Prince; it is
probable on the other side; that it is unjust; you being at present appointed by
the Prince to collect this Impost, require it according to this Opinion, which
maintains that it is just, and therefore it is lawful for you to levy it without
doing any injustice: but if to morrow, or the same day, you being a Merchant,
may secretly defraud this Impost or Excise, following the Opinion that it is
unjust. Tamb. lib. 1. Theol. c. 3. sect. 5. n. 1, 2, 3. p. 21.

10. A man may, relying on an Opinion sweet and indulgent, but probable,
disobey his Prince or Superior in a thing in which it is probable that he is not
obliged to obey, but it is more probable that he is obliged to the Prince or
Superior following the Opinion which is more safe, judges that he ought to
obey, and therefore that he has sinned; the Prince or Superior has reason to
command obedience, the Inferior has reason not to obey, both founded upon
probable Opinions; inthis case the Prince or Superior is rash, if he judges
that the Inferior sins, because it is not probable, that he sins who follows a
probable Opinion, and so it being probable, that the Inferior has not sinned;
the Prince or Superior shall be unjust, if he treats him as guilty; for where
there is no fault, there is no punishment. Cat. in Com. in Reg. 6. Bernard.
lib. 1. n. 65.

11. He who believes that it is more probable that we cannot in Conscience
follow that of the two Opinions which is most probable, may yet follow it
himself, if he believes that it is also probable that he may follow it. Sanch.
op. mor. lib. 1. c. 17. p. 30.

12. It Is probable, that the loss of Reputation may, and may not be compensated
with Money; therefore this day, you being defamed, desire satisfaction in Money,
and to morrow or this day you having defamed another, may safely deny to allow
him the same compensation. Tamb. lib. 1. Theol. c. 3. sect. 5. n. 1, 2, 3. p.
21.

13. A lawful Prince does publish Just Laws for his Subjects to obey, and they
have no cause to complain thereof; or just reason to refuse them: the Subjects
do sin, and it may be said they do not sin at all; for there is great Authority
and Reasons on each side to make both Opinions probable, and to give liberty to
which the Jesuits please; but the more safe, and more probable is to disobey.
Esc. Tom. 1. lib. 5. s. 2. c. 14. prob. 13. p. 160.

But Priests and Ecclesiastics, must be exempted from obedience to the Laws of
Princes; for they are not Subjects of necessity and obligation, but only out of
respect and good example toward Princes Laws, which regard the Government of
their States, and which derogate not from the Ecclesiastic State. Escob. Theol.
mor. To. 1. lib. 5. c. 15. prob. 19. p. 162.

14. All probable Opinions are of themselves as safe the one as the other; but
the more pleasant, though they be less probable, are always more profitable and
more safe, because they are more easy, and by consequence more favorable to
Temporal Interest. Cat. in Com. in Regal. Sancti Bernardi. lib. 1. d. 6. n. 58.
Idem, Theol. fundam. p. 134.

15. As it is impossible that an Opinion which has the approbation of many
Learned Doctors should not be probable, so it is impossible to reject it; none
of their Propositions can cease to be probable, if the contrary does not become
an Article of Faith. Layman. lib. 1. c. 5. p. 2.

By these Maxims, following a probable Opinion, you are exempted from all sin:
you may act, do, or say what you please, and you are safe. The Gospel of Christ
made men sinners, but these make them all innocent. If there be two persons
which do the same thing, he who knows not this doctrine, sins; and he who does,
sins not. If things and actions should be measured by the Scripture and the
Fathers of the Church, they could not be done without sin; therefore it was
necessary that the Jesuits should by their Prudence moderate things so, that
those things which persons could not act by the Law of God without sin, they
may safely do and act by these Maxims. They have discovered many new ways to
Heaven, which were heretofore unknown to the Church and Jesus Christ himself,
who has not spoken any thing of them in his Gospel; if he does, it has been
only to condemn them. Following the Principles of these good men, you will find
it is not only easy to be saved, but it is almost impossible to be damned; There
can be no affair of Conscience so troublesome or so desperate, for which
Expedients may not be found; nor any Crimes so black, which may not easily be
excused and justified; there was never a better contrivance invented in the
World, than this of probable Opinion; for there are but two Conditions required
to make an Opinion probable; First, that it be founded on Reasons in some sort
considerable, which will be very easy; for no man has formed an Opinion, but
does believe that the Reasons which he brings are good enough to support what
he maintains. The second condition, That there be no convincing reason for the
contrary; which is no less easy than the former; for a reason may be
convincing in respect of one man, which is not to another: and an obstinate man
will always think his Reasons best; but in case you cannot answer the reasons
on the contrary, you may persuade your self some other more Learned may do it;
and so it does remain probable, and you may safely act in Conscience by and
according to it, though that which you act or do be against the Divine Law, and
condemned by God in Scripture. Sanch. op. mor. lib. 1. c. 9. n. 17. p. 30.

CHAP. XIII. Of Judges and Witnesses.
1. IF the right of the parties seem equal on both sides, the Judge may take
money or a present of one party, to give advantage whether he pleases, because
he may do favor, and this favor may be valued by money, and because for the
most part the Judge loses the friendship of one of the parties. Esc. tr. 3. ex.
2. n. 111. p. 363.

2. If the opinions are so doubtful and divided, that its in the power of the
Judges to follow which he pleases; if one of the parties make him a present to
gain him to his side, the Judge does not offend against Justice in receiving
that which is given him to follow one of the two Parties rather than the other.
Esco. tr. 6. Exam. 6. n. 44. p. 743.

3. A Judge giving Judgment, may follow a probable opinion, leaving that which
is more probable; nay he may judge against his own proper opinion, as did Pilat,
who condemned Jesus Christ, after he had declared publicly, that he believed
him innocent. Escob. in proem. Exam. 3. c. 3. n. 10. p. 25.

4. When the right of the Parties is not clear, or when it happens that there
are different opinions concerning the sense of the Law; when the one opinion is
as probable as the other, it is in the power of the Judge to choose which he
pleases, and to follow it in his judgment. Sanch. lib. 1. c. 9. n. 45. And he
may, if it gives no scandal, judge one while according to one opinion, and
another time according to another opinion. Ibidem. For if he may choose of two
probable opinions, that which he pleases, it follows, That he may follow
sometimes the one opinion, and sometimes the other, as he pleases; but if one
of the two opinions be more probable than the other, the Judge may pronounce
judgment according to that he likes best, and even to follow that which he
believes to be less probable. Ibidem. And the Judge does not herein behave
himself imprudently or rashly, guiding himself as he does by a probable
opinion. Ibidem.

5. If a person who has born false witness through ignorance or inadvertency,
which occasions the condemnation of a man, and the loss of life or member to
another; he is not obliged after that he understands the truth, to retract his
false testimony, for fear of exposing himself to great evils. Tolet. lib. 5. c.
59. Dicast. lib. 2. tr. 2. disp. 8. dub. 7. n. 92. For it is lawful to kill an
innocent person, after we have slandered him, rather than to expose our selves
to danger by retracting; though it is not so much the offense or Hangman, as
the false witness which puts him to death:

6. If a Witness corrupted by Money, hide or retire himself before he has been
legally examined or cited into the Court; he is not obliged to restore the money
he received in this manner. Dicast. lib. 2. tr. 2. d. 4. dub. 8. n. 156.

7. If a man is accused of a Crime which cannot be legally proved by the
Accuser; he may not only deny the crime, but say, That the Accuser lies and
slanders him. Tamb. lib 9. decal. c. 2. sect. 2. n. 2. For it is no lie to say
unto a man he lies, when he knows that he speaks truth, and to slander an
accuser as a slanderer, where he accuses us of a crime which we have committed,
of two accusers the one speaks the truth, the other lies; the one objects a
true crime, and the other a false, yet in that says the truth is the liar; and
he who objects a true crime, is a slanderer; which is admirable divinity, and
may be made use of in conduct of affairs.

8. If a man cannot defend himself against a false and unjust Witness but by
slandering of him, he may without sin impose on him so many false Crimes as
will be necessary for his defense. Tamb. lib. 9. decal. c. 2. s. 2. n. 4, 5, 6,
7. If he does it, he sins not against Justice, and by consequence he is not
obliged to restitution. Ibidem. So that by this Maxim to defend our selves from
true but secret crimes, and whereof there is no public proof, we may say to
the honestest man in the World, who would inform against us in a Court of
Justice, That he is a Sodomite, Heretic, Excommunicate, etc. And we may for
proof of this Slander, make use of false witnesses, counterfeit false Deeds and
Writings, and corrupt public Notaries to subscribe them, without committing of
any injustice at all, though the Scriptures do forbid it as a Sin. So that you
may observe the Pious Care of these holy Fathers, in framing Maxims stable to
all times, persons and things. The Gospel of Christ may be useful to some ends
and designs, but being not equally serviceable to all, many times it is to be
laid aside; for if you make too much use of it, it will give a check unto your
actings, and obstruct your designs if you act according to its directions.

9. A false Witness, is he who charge one with a false Crime; an unjust
Witness, is he who accuses one of true Crimes, but secret, and which he cannot
prove according to the form of Justice. That Witness is to be held for a
slanderer, who cannot prove the crime which he accuses one of; and by
consequence having accused unjustly, he is obliged unto restitution. Dicast.
lib. 2. tr. 2. d. 12. p. 3. dub. 18. n. 285.

CHAP. XIV. Of Restitution and Satisfaction.
1. THey which by Traffic, Merchandise, Usurious Contracts or Bargains,
believing them to be good, have gained great Wealth, being invincibly ignorant,
that such manner of dealings were forbidden, and unlawful, are not obliged to
make Restitution of those Goods so gotten, although they have so gained them,
they not being informed of the injustice of such Contracts. Bauny in his Sum.
p. 156.

2. If you entreat a Soldier to beat his Neighbor, or to burn the Farm of a
man who has offended you; if the Soldier does these Outrages, you are not
obliged out of your Estate to repair the damage, which proceeds from thence;
for no man is obliged to restore, if he has not viola^^d Justice; and he does
not, who submits himself to another's pleasure, and only entreats of him a
favor. Bauny in his Sum. c. 11. p. 200.

3. A person who is indebted for very great Sums of Money, to the prejudice of
his Creditors gives away part of his Goods; he to whom the gift is made, is not
obliged to restore any part thereof to his Creditors, if he be not constrained
thereunto by Law. Bauny in his Sum. cap. 11. p. 200.

4. There is no natural Precept which obliges us in this Life to make
Satisfaction for Temporal pains. Fillut. mor. tr. 6. c. 9. n. 213. p. 159.

5. God punishing sins in Purgatory, when satisfaction is not made in this
life, the Sinner may without injustice refer satisfaction unto the other life.
Fillut. Ibidem. And though the Sinner defers satisfaction until the next life,
he loses not by this, neither Bliss or the Love of God; and though he retards
the enjoyment thereof, yet the loss made by this delay may be repayed. Ibid.

6. That which one receives for doing any dishoncst action, as to cause a man
to be killed, for committing of fornication for defaming our Neighbors, for
bearing of false witness, may in conscience be detained, and is not subject to
restitution, if the action be done. Fillut. mor. Tom. 2. tr. 32. c. 4. n. 103.
p. 364. But if the action be not done, you ought not to pay him till he has
performed the action, as if a man promises to pay unto Titius 100 l. to
assassinate Caius. till he has done the fact; he can require nothing, and if
he has executed it, common right requires that you pay him what you promised
to him. Layman. lib. 3. tr. 4. c. 6. n. 8. p. 377. For the pains which he has
taken, and the danger which he exposed himself unto for your sake, deserves to
be well recompensed with money.

7. A Judge who has taken money for an unjust Judgment, is not obliged to make
restitution, no more than a Murderer who has taken money to commit a murder.
Lessius de Just. et Jure, lib. 2. c. 14. disp. 8. n. 54. p. 145. But if the
Judge has taken money to give a just sentence, he is obliged to restore that
which he has received, because he has done no more than he ought to have
done; but in giving an unjust Judgment, he runs the hazard and loss of his
place, and so is not bound to restore that which he has received.

8. This Divinity of these good Fathers is very indulgent, and merciful to
Sinners; for by their Doctrine, this Judge does deserve a reward; but by the
Laws of God, a most severe punishment.

9. If a man has done wrong unto another, he is obliged to make restitution,
if he did it not expressly on design, and with knowledge. Escob. tr. 3. exam. 2.
n. 8. p. 348. For only Sins of malice oblige us to restitution, and not those
of Infirmity or Ignorance.

10. Where it is impossible to make restitution without diminishing ones retinue
and expense, so as to be taken notice of; he is not bound to restitution.
Escob. tr. 3. exam. 2. c.. 4n. 37. p. 353.

11. Whatsoever wrong a man has done or caused to be done, to ones Neigbour to
hinder his wealth, or to procure his hurt, no restitution is to be made if he
has used no violence, but only Prayers, Promises, Presents to deceive him or
cause another to deceive him or wrong him. Escob. tr. 3. exam. 2. n. 160. p.
370.

12. A man is not obliged to restore what he has stolen, by trivial and
inconsiderable Theft, whatsoever the total sum thereof may amount unto. Add to
the Mist. of Jesuitisme. p. 112.. 16.

A Summary Account of the Sacred Doctrines, Holy Principles, and Pious Maxims,
contained in this Gospel, necessary for all Christians to understand, and which
will much advance Devotion and Holiness of Life.
CHAP. 1. 2. 3.
1. THe Bishop of Rome is God.

2. THe who is not obedient to the decrees of the Pope, is a Heretic.

3. The Pope is Lord of all temporalties upon Earth.

4. No man ought to say unto the Pope, Why do thou thus?

5. The Pope may dispense with or against the commands of Christ or the
Apostles.

6. The Pope's Will is a Law.

7. All Nations and Kingdoms are under the Pope's Jurisdiction.

8. God has delivered over unto the Pope, the power and rule of Heaven and
Earth.

9. The whole World is the Pope's Inheritance.

10. The Pope has an almighty infallabilitie and cannot err.

11. The Pope can do all that God himself can do, only Sin excepted.

12. He has power of making Sin, to be no Sin; and that which is no Sin, to be
Sin.

13. He can give Empires and Kingdoms to whom he pleases, and depose the
Possessors of them.

14. The Pope may depose Kings by his power, if they be either negligent in
their Administration of their Government, or do not extirpate all Heretics out
of their Dominions.

15. If a King turns Heretic, he has no right to his Kingdom; and no man
ought to think it strange if the Pope depose him.

16. If Kings will not be obedient to the Church of Rome, then may the Pope by
the great power from Heaven, very justly depose them; and the Subjects
themselves if the Pope commands them, must take up Arms against them.

17. The Pope can quit Subjects from their Obedience and Allegiance which they
owe to their King.

18. The power of the Pope is greater than that of the Apostles, having power
to derogate from the Sayings and Words of the Pope.

19. The Doctrine of the Pope is the infallible rule of Faith, and the holy
Scripture, has taken its force, and does take it from his Holiness, and he
that does not believe this is an Heretic.

20. The Pope is he by whom Kings reign, according as it is said, By me Kings
reign.

CHAP. IV.
21. THere is no Precept which obliges us directly to pray to God to love,
believe or hope in him, but only when it is necessary to acquire some good, or
to remove some evil.

22. He who prays not to God in a temptation against Chastity, Sins only
against Chastity; for he Sins not omitting prayer, but because of the danger he
is in to violate Chastity.

23. In our private Prayers which we make to God, it is not necessary to use any
Devotion or Attention; nor are we obliged thereunto: and in those which are
made by command, we are not obliged unto any inward intention, provided that we
rehearse them outwardly, and behave our selves decently and with respect.

24. Whatsoever distractions or evil thoughts come into our minds when we are
at prayer, if they be not on contempt, but negligence, the sin is but venial.

25. Christ commands us to receive the Sacrament of Baptism, a Tyrant forbids
us upon pain of our Lives, we must obey the Tyrant rather then Christ.

26. In receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, it is not necessary to
have actual Devotion; for let one be distracted with evil thoughts in the
receiving the Sacrament, provided he contemns it not, yet he is a worthy
receiver, and only sins venially; and so if he commits any sin, in the
Communion it self.

27. He who has sinned mortally, and has remorse for his sins, and has
confessed them to a Priest, may well Communicate, though a little before the
Communion he has sinned mortally.

28. If a man after he has communicated many times in a bad state, comes to
be converted, he shall receive in an instant, all the graces which were due to
so many Communions.

29. It Is not necessary that the Priest who finds himself guilty of mortal sin,
should Confess himself before he Administers the Sacrament.

30. A Person who has abundance, after he has satisfied all his own
necessaries and those of his Family, having yet a superfluity, is not obliged
in a public Famine to give unto the poor, nor to any one whomsoever, if he see
him not in eminent danger to dye with Famine.

31. The precept of giving Alms may be fulfilled; by lending only, without
giving any thing.

32. Rich men are not obliged to give Alms but out of their superfluity, and
not then, but in case of great necessity; those things which may exalt us to a
better condition, as to Places or Preferment, are not to be accounted
superfluous: Therefore Alms are rarely to be given; for it seldom happens that
we have goods superfluous.

33. There is no obligation to love our Neighbor; it is sufficient not to hate
him.

34. There is no absolute Commandment to love God; but when in Scripture we are
commanded to love God, they are but Counsels and Advices, and no Commands; for
God has not commanded so much to love him, as not to hate him; and he ought to
be content that we love him, as little as we please, and it suffices that we
love him much under that we could if we would; for the least degree of love is
enough for him.

35. If we be obliged to love God, we are not obliged to love him above Three
or Four Months in our Life; whereof the first is when we begin to have the use
of Reason. 2. At the point of Death. 3. Every Fifth year during Life. For the
rest of our time we may love God or the World, as we please.

36. If a man has committed any mortal sin, he is not obliged to contrition or
sorrow for that sin before the Article of his Death.

37. A man may be a Martyr not only without any act of Charity, but also
without any act of Faith; and though he suffers without love to God, and though
he never thinks of him.

CHAP. V.
38. HE that by custom is transported to do evil, as to Swear or Blaspheme,
sins not at all, because a man cannot sin without reason, but by an ill custom
the use of Reason is taken away; so that he who sins out of those ill
habits, is in a better condition than he that has them not; and by often
sinning, is put into a state of not sinning any more.

39. Perjury which one commits through natural inadvertency, or because of the
custom he has to Swear, it is no mortal sin.

40. Those who in their Youth, have committed many actions of a vicious nature,
which they did not believe to be such, are not obliged to confess them, when
they know their nature; because when they committed them, they had not the full
use of Reason; and at most they were but venial sins, if any sin at all.

41. The pleasure which is taken in an action of mortal sin, which is done in
sleep, drunkenness, madness, or through ignorance, is no sin.

42. He who does some unlawful act, knowing well that it is forbidden, but not
remembering it to be such, when he does it, is exempt from mortal sin; because
forgetfulness or negligence which is the cause we think not of it, the evil we
are about to do, is not imputed for sin, if it be not voluntary, if we do not
consider that we are obliged to examine that we are about to do.

43. God cannot command or forbid a thing that is in it self slight, under the
penalty of mortal sin.

44. He who has knowledge in the Law, and is ignorant of the penalty which it
ordains against those who violate it, does not incur the penalty.

45. He who has a will to commit all venial sins, if he were able, sins only
venially.

46. No man is obliged to avoid the next occasion of sin, if some great loss
will thereby befall him.

47. A thing is not the next occasion of sin, unless it be vicious and a sin of
it self.

48. To tell a lie in Preaching on any Doctrinal Point, is but a venial sin.

49. All the breaches of the First and Second Table of the Decalogue are no
sins at all, when they are committed by any man out of ignorance, surprise or
passion.

CHAP. VI. Of directing the Intention.
50. TO do evil, there must be an evil Intention; but to do good, it is not
necessary to have a good Intention.

51. Ecclesiastics satisfy the Precept of the Church in saying Prayers, when
they read them without any inward Intention or Devotion, so they observe
outward Decency.

52. If a man speaks never so dishonourably and irreverently of God, it is no
blasphemy if he had not a formal intent to blaspheme God and dishonor him.

53. If a man be at Prayers, and has a bad intent thereunto joined; as an
intent of looking on a Woman dishonestly, it is no sin.

54. If a man be to do an act, and makes protestation that his Intention is not
to do any evil; let the act be never so wicked, it is no sin in him.

55. A Mother may wish the death of her Daughter, because she cannot match her
according to her desire for want of a Portion.

56. You may desire the death of an Enemy, who might do you much hurt; not of
hatred to him, but to avoid the damage he might do you.

57. To lie with a Woman, when he represents to himself, that he is Married
to her; it is no evil, but good.

58. A man may accept of a Challenge to Fight a Duel, not with an intention to
fight the duel, but only of defending himself.

CHAP. VII. Of Adultery or Fornication.
59. TO lie with a Married Woman is not Adultery, if the Husband does consent
thereunto.

60. A Virgin may dispose of her Virginity, and prostitute her self without the
consent of Parents, and it is no injury to them.

61. To lie with a Woman considered as his Wife, is no sin.

62. If a drunken or Madman lies with a woman, it is no sin; because he has
not the use of Reason.

63. There may be a dispensation granted to commit Fornication, because it is
not forbidden by the Law of Nature.

64. Men and Women being together, and by that means induced to sin, if their
relapses be but once or twice a month, they may continue therein, if they
cannot separate without some inconvenience.

65. It Is lawful for a woman to retain to her self the price of her Adultery.

CHAP. VIII. Of Murder.
66. It Is lawful for an Honorable Person to kill an assailant, who would
strike him with his Cudgel, or give him a box in the Ear.

67. If a person endeavor to deprive me of my Honor or Reputation before a
Person of great Quality, by accusing me of some Crimes; I may kill him, and the
same may be done against him, though the sin be true, so it be hid and secret.

68. To desend one's self from an affront which would be given us, it is lawful
to prevent the aggressor, by killing him.

69. If a man does detain from me my Goods, and I cannot in course of Justice
receive them without much trouble; it is lawful for me to kill him, though the
Goods be but an Apple, or to the value of five shillings.

70. It Is no Murder to kill an Excommunicated person.

71. It Is lawful to kill all those who do us wrong, though we be assured that
they shall be damned dying in that state.

72. If any person shall endeavor to take away from you your Estate unjustly
by foul practices and vexatious Suits at Law; it is lawful for to kill him.

73. A man may lawfully kill by ambush and behind the back an Informer that
prosecutes in any Court, and likewise the Witness which the Prosecutor
produces; and also the Judge, if he holds a correspondency with the Witness.

74. If a man has made use of a woman, he may kill her, if she offer to
discover what passed between them.

75. He commits not the sin of Manslaughter, who kills him who invades him
unjustly, though he gave him an occasion to assault him.

76. It Is lawful to kill him who says to you, You lie.

77. An Adulterer may lawfully kill the Husband of a woman with whom he has
committed adultery, if her Husband, having surprised him in the fact, does
assault him.

78. It Is not against Charity to kill a Thief who robs me of things which I
cannot recover at Law without much trouble.

79. It Is lawful to kill a Slanderer or false witness secretly in an affair,
wherein not only Life, but even outward Goods also of great importance are in
question.

CHAP. IX. Of Theft.
80. It Is no mortal sin in him who steals, that does believe that his Father,
Master, or he from whom he steals the Goods would have given him them, if he
had asked him, or if he had known that he had need of them, or when he makes no
account of the Goods which are stolen from them, or when he is of such a
disposition that he would not have him that had stolen them from him, obliged
therefore to any great punishment.

81. Theft which Men and Maidservants commit in Meat and Drink, are not great
sins, though insensibly they amount unto a great value.

82. A woman may take and purloyn money from her Husband to Game withal, and
upon diverse other occasions.

83. The Poor in extraordinary necessity may steal from the Rich with a safe
conscience.

84. He who takes what is another, does him no wrong, if he made no use of
it, or was not like to use it.

85. He who steals frequently by little at a time so to gather together a great
Sum, is not obliged to restitution, when it is not done with intention to steal
the great Sum.

86. If a man finds any thing which does belong to another, he may appropriate
it to himself though he knows the Owner, and he demands it.

87. It Is lawful for Servants to steal from their Masters, to make their Wages
proportionable to their Services.

88. A Son may with a safe Conscience steal Money from his Father.

89. A Religious Person or Priest may quit his habit, and go and steal; as well
as go incognito to the Stews.

CHAP. X. Of Deceit.
90. A Treasurer, Factor, Solicitor or Servant, and such like, may Traffic
with their Master's Money, without his privity, and retain the profit for
themselves.

91. If a Tax be imposed upon Wine, the Vintner having better Wine then
ordinary, to recompense himself may mingle water with wine; and he that buyeth,
has no loss thereby.

92. A Tailor who is employed to make Clothes for another person, buys a good
Bargain of Cloth of a Merchant of whom he uesth to buy; the Tailor may make
his benefit of this good penyworth, and make his Customer pay what it is truly
worth.

93. If the Magistrate regulate the Price and Weights of Flesh, and the
Measures of Wine, so as the Price is not sufficient for the Charge, Pains, and
the ways of those who sell these Merchandises; they may diminish the Weight
and Measure so far as it is necessary to satisfy all these things; and if they
be examined before the Magistrate concerning the same, they may deny all upon
oath.

94. If a man has run into debt to supply his Debaucheries, he may frustrate

he may with safety to his Conscience retain so much thereof, as is necessary
for him and his Family to live in honor.

himself the property of the Money, and may justly detain it.

96. Cheating is lawful by the Contract Moliatra.

CHAP. XI. Of Oaths, Promises, Mental Reservations and Equivocations.
97. IF a man makes a promise without any intention to promise, or makes a
promise without any intention to perform; in neither case he is obliged to
perform what is promised, though an oath be superadded, because he had no
intent to oblige himself either by his promise or his oath.

98. If you have made a promise or an oath, and you doubt whether you had an
intent to oblige your self, it is probable you are not obliged to keep it.

99. To seign in an important matter, and to vow only with one's lips without
any intention, is but a venial sin; because it is only to lie, which is no great
irreverence toward God.

100. He who desires not to swear (the better to obtain belief) may find out
many ways to speak and to affirm, which commonly passes for oaths, but indeed
are not.

101. When one is resolved to swear, you may choose words of double meaning,
and make use of a mental restriction, the better to effect your ends; no man is
obliged by his oath beyond his intention, so by consequence if you have no
intention to swear, you are not obliged.

102. The art of mental restriction or reservation is of great use, and must be
well studied; if a promise by oath be drawn from a man unjustly by force to pay
a certain Sum of Money; he that swears in this manner may use an equivocation
in these terms, I swear to you, I will give this Money, intending to give it to
him to whom he swears, or to some other; because these words may receive either
of these two Senses.

103. If in the Tongue in which you swear, the Name of God signifies diverse
things, it will be lawful to swear by the Name of God, taking it in some other
signification.

104. When one is required to make oath unto a person in a case in which he
believes he is not obliged to swear; he may do it without fear of Perjury,
though that he says be false.

105. If a person be ignorant and cannot make use of mental reservation upon
occasion; he may swear plainly without obliging himself in any sort whatsoever;
provided he has no intent to swear, nor to perform that which he swears.

106. This art of Equivocation in the conduct of affairs is of mavelous use,
and the Jesuits have given many Rules and Examples for the facilitating of it.
If one desires to borrow money of a man, which indeed he has, but which indeed
he will not lend; he may swear he has it not at all, meaning, not to lend him.

107. It Is lawful in our defense at all times to make use of Equivocations,
though he who examines us, does press us, and makes us swear not to use them;
yet he may safely make use of them.

108. One is discharged of his Oath, though in doing what he swears to do, he
has an express intent not to do or fulfill it.

109. It Is a less sin to swear in common talk by the Holy Name of God, than
it is to eat an Egg in Lent.

110. If I swear to do such an act, and have no intention to swear, though I do
not perform the act, I am not forswern, because an Oath depends on the
Intention of him who swears.

111. If a man lies in using Equivocations, without any necessity obliging him
thereunto, and swears to confirm this Equivocation, he does neither lie nor
commit perjury; because he that speaks and swears in that sort, has no
intention to speak or swear falsely.

112. If one commit Perjury through natural inadvertency, or because of ill
custom he has to forswear, it is no mortal sin; because he does forswear
himself without perceiving it at all.

CHAP. XII. Of the Doctrine of Probability.
113. A Probable Opinion is that which has one good Author, of Reputation, or
one Reason to maintain it; that which is supported by a probable Opinion is
simply good, and we may lawfully and safely in Conscience act by and according
to it.

114. Where two Opinions are probable, the one as well as the other, we may
justly in the practice prefer that which is less probable; though not so safe,
if you like it best, or may be acceptable to others.

115. It Is lawful in Conscience for a man to quit his own opinion, though more
probable, to follow the probable opinion of another, though less sure.

116. If you meet with two contrary Opinions, you may follow them, both in
different affairs, and even in the same affair also, acting and giving contrary
counsels now after the one, and then after the other.

117. A man may hold an opinion probable, when he is persuaded that he himself
or some other can answer the reasons upon which that Opinion is grounded; and
it is safe to act in Conscience accordingly.

118. He who believes that it is more probable, may yet follow it himself, if he
believes that it is also probable, that he may follow it.

119. All probable Opinions are of themselves as safe the one as the other; but
the more pleasant although they be less probable, are always more profitable
and more safe.

CHAP. XIII. Of Judges and Witnesses.
120. IF the Right of the Parties seem equal on both sides, the Judge may take
Money or a Present of one Party, to give the advantage to whether he pleases.

121. If the Opinions are so doubtful and divided, that it is in the power of
the Judge to follow which he pleases; if one of the Parties make him a Present
to gain him to his side, the Judge does not offend against Justice to receive
that which is given him.

122. A Judge giving his Judgment may follow a probable Opinion, leaving that
which is more probable.

123. If there be two probable Opinions, the Judge may give Sentence according
to which he pleases; and one while he may judge according to one opinion, and
another time according to another opinion.

124. A person who has born false witness through ignorance, who occasioned
the loss of life, after he understands the truth, he is not obliged to retract
his false testimony, for fear of exposing himself to punishment.

125. It Is lawful to kill an innocent person, after we have slandered him,
rather than expose our selves to danger by retracting.

126. If a man be accused of a Crime which cannot be legally proved by the
Accuser; he may not only deny the crimes, but slander the Accuser, and may
impose so many crimes upon him as will be necessary for his defense; and he
sins not against Justice.

127. A false Witness is he who charge one with a false Crime; but an unjust
Witness is he who accuses one of true Crimes, but secret, and which he cannot
prove.

CHAP. XIV. Of Restitution.
128. IF any man has by Merchandise, Usury, or otherwise, being invincibly
ignorant, gained a great Estate; though afterward he be informed of the
injustice, he is not obliged to restitution.

129. There is no natural Precept which obliges us in this life to make
satisfaction for temporal pains.

130. A Sinner may refer Satisfaction without injustice, unto the other life,
if he makes not satisfaction in this.

131. A person who is indebted in great Sums of Money, and gives away part of
his Goods, to the prejudice of his Creditors; he to whom the gift is made, is
not obliged to restitution.

132. That which one receives for doing of an unjust action, as for bearing of
false witness, for killing of a man; he is not subject to restitution.

133. If a Judge has taken money to give an unjust Judgment, he is not obliged
to restitution; but if he has received money to give a just Judgment, he is
obliged to restore what he has received.

134. If a man wrongeth another out of ignorance or infirmity, he is bound to
make restitution.

135. Where a man cannot make restitution without diminishing his retinue or
expense, he is not bound to make restitution.

136. Where one has done wrong to another not by violence, but by Promises,
Prayers or Presents; he is not obliged to restitution.

137. A man is not obliged to restore what he has stolen by trivial and
inconsiderable Thefts, whatsoever the total Sum may amount unto.
