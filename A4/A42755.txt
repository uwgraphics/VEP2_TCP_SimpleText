THe Parliament by an Ordinance of November. 24. 1642. enabled Ferdinando Lord
Fairfax, to receive Money, Plate, Horse, and Arms upon the Propositions, for
which the Public Faith was to be engaged.

Col. Gill upon that Ordinance lent Ferdinando Lord Fairfax 60. li. upon the
Public Faith, and raised a Troop of Horse completely armed with Swords,
Pistolls, Back, Breast, and Pot, wherein he disbursed 600. li. a great part of
which Moneys he borrowed upon Interest.

Col. Gill served under the command of the Lord Fairfax as Captain, and Major
of Horse, until his Arrears amounted unto 1657. li. 16.s. 3.d.

The Parliament by Ordinance of the 22 May, 1647. provides for the payment of
one third of the Arreares of the Northern Officers, to be accepted by them for
the whole in full satisfaction.

Col. Gill one of those Officers, his Accounts being audited, and so stated,
that the 600. li. advanced by him in Horse and Arms upon the Public Faith,
was accounted amongst his Arrears, was then in a straight, conceiving that the
Parliament intended not to give one third in full for his Money lent, yet being
in necessity for moneys by reason of his losses in serving the Parliament, was
willing to accept of one third in full for his Arrears, and to receive one
third of his 600. li. lent, but not for satisfaction; therefore upon the 27 of
May, before he took an Assignement for any money, five days after the said
Ordinance passed, he petitioned the Committee of the Northern Association,
showing that he could not accept of one third for the whole of his 600. li.
lent, and that the Ordinance mentioned only Arrears, and desired that his Case,
with his losses and sufferings, might be represented to the Parliament; the
Committee ordered, That his Petition should be reported to the Parliament.

Thereupon Col. Gill received his Petition and Accounts from the Clerk of the
Committee (as appears by a Note of the Clerks hand) and put them into the
hands of Mr. Bryan Stapleton to report to the Parliament, as he has already
testified. After two years expectation of reparations for his losses and
sufferings, and the 400. li. the remaining two thirds of his 600. li. lent
money, the Act of Parliament passed for doubling upon Deans and Chapters Lands,
and Col. Gill was advised, and did believe, that without offense he might
double the money that he had lent upon the Public Faith, and he did double
the 400. li. (the two remaining thirds of the 600. li. lent in Horses and
Arms) which with the Interest allowed, amounted to 600. li.

NOw if any conceives that Col. Gill has gained by the Commonwealths Service
in receiving one third of his Arreares, and Troop, and doubling two thirds of
his 600 li. lent in Horses and Arms with Interest, he humbly offers the
abovesaid Account, That by his receiving one third of his Arreares and Troop,
(whereof he lost 387 li.) by the Parliaments transferring the same from the
Excise to Deans and Chapters Lands, and by his doubling the two thirds of his
Troop, and Interest for the same, he never yet received in money his 660 li.
lent upon the Public Faith.

Col. Gill humbly craves your favor to consider, That he has been a constant
sufferer for the Parliament from the beginning of the War to this day, and has
upon his credit advanced great sums of Money for their Service, and lost his
Estate and Calling which was, and would have been of great advantage to him,
and he desires that he may not be ruined in his attendance upon your Honors,
he having waited near nine Months after a heavy sentence given against him,
and nothing can more certainly ruin him and his Family then a further long
attendance, under the sentence given against him; He beseeches you therefore
that the report of his Case now resting in the hands of Col. Downs may be
speedily heard, and he humbly hopes he may yet be thought capable of doing
further service for the Common wealth.

GEORGE GILL*
