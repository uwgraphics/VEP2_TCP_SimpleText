A Lamentable BALLAD on the Earl of ESSEX.
The Tune is, Essex's last Good night.


ALl you that cry, O hone, O hone,
come now and sing, O hone with me,
For why our Jewel is from us gone,
the valiant Knight of Chivalry:
Of rich and poor beloved was be,
in time an honorable Knight,
When by our Laws condemned to dye,
he lately took his last good night.
Count him not like to Champion,
those traitoreus Men of Babington,
Nor like the Earl of Westmorland,
by whom a number were undone:
he never yet hurt Mother's son;
his quarrel still maintains the right,
Which makes the tears my face down run,
when I think on his last good night
The Portugals can witness be,
his Dagger at Lisbon Gate he slung,
And like a Knight of Chivalry,
his Chain upon the Gate or he flung;
I would to God, that he would come,
to fetch them back in order right,
Which thing was by his honor done.
yet lately took his last good night.
The Frenchmen they can (...),
the Town of Gourney he took in,
And (...) to Rome immediately,
not caring for his (...)
With Bullets then he pierc'^ their skin,
and (...) them fly from his (...):
(...) there that time did credit win,
and now has taken his last good night.
And stately Cales can witness be,
then in his Proclamation right,
He (...) command them all straightly,
to have a care of Infants lives,
And that none would hurt Men or (...),
which was against their right;
Therefore they prayed for his long life,
which lately took his last good night.
Would God be never had Ireland known,
nor set one foot on Flanders ground,
Then might we well ^^^oy'd our own,
where now our Jewel will not be (...),
Which makes our (...) still abound;
(...) with (...) tears in our sight,
To hear his Name in our ears to sound,
Lord Deverux took his last good night.
Ash Wednesday, that ^isnral day,
when he came forth his Chamber (...),
Upon a (...) there he saw,
his head man standing him before:
His (...) all they (...) deplore,
shedding salt tears in his sight,
He said farewell to rich and (...),
at hi, good morrow and goodnight.
My Lords, said he, you stand but by,
to see performance of the Law,
It is I that have desive'd to dye,
and yield my self unto the (...);
I have deserved to dye I know,
but never against my Country's right,
Nor to my Queen (...) then (...),
upon my death, at my goodnight.
Farewell, Elizabeth, my gracious (...),
God bless thee with thy Council all;
Farewell my Knights of Chivaley;
farewell my Soldiers stout and tall,
Farewell the Commons great and small;
into the hands of Men (...),
My life shall make attends for all,
for Essex bids the World goodnight.
Farewell dear Wife and Children (...),
farewell my kind and tender son,
Comfort yourselves, mourn not for me,
although your fall be now begun,
My time is come, my glass is run,
comfort your self in former light.
(...) by my fall you are undone,
your Father bids the World goodnight
Derick, thou know at Cales (...)
thy life, lost for a Rape there done,
As thou thy self cannot (...)
thine own hand (...) and twenty hung,
But now thou see myself (...) come,
by chance into thy (...) light,
Strike out thy blow, that I may know,
thou Essex loved at his good night.
When England coun^^ me a Papist,

I never worshipped (...) nor angel in h^^.
nor the Virgin Mary, (...)
But to Christ, which for my (...),
trickling with sols years in his sight,
Spreading my acins to God on high,
