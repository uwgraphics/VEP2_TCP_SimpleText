Q. What profit have thou by Baptism?

A. I believe that by Baptism my Acts. 22.16 etc. 38

blood of Christ being sprinkled upon my soul by the Heb. 10.22. Acts 15 9.
hand of faith, does wash me from all my sins.

A. As I receive the Math. 26 26.27. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25.
bread and wine into my body, to become wholly mine, so I believe that my Soul
receives withal Christ Jesus with 1 Cor. 1.30. 2 Cor. 5.2
his death and righteousness to the Romans 4.1 Ephesians. 1.13.
sealing up of my everlasting Salvation.

Q. Seeing that they which receive these mysteries unworthily, eat and drink
their own condemnation: how ought thou to prepare thy self to the right
receiving of them?

A. First I must 1 Cor. 11 28. 2 Cor 13.5
examine my self whether I 2 These. 2 15. 1 Cor. 16.13.
stand strongly in the true says of Jesus Christ, or no. Secondly, whither I
find my heart Mat. 26.75 2 Cor. 7.9.10.
inwardly grieved for my sins, with an Psalm. 51.17. Romans 7.24
hatred and loathing of the same. Thirdly, if any offense be betwixt others and
me, that I Mat. 5.24 Heb 12.44
reconcile my self unto them, and Mat 8.22
forgive them even as Christ has forgiven me.

FINIS.
OPen our eyes, O Lord, that we may see the wondrous things of the Law: that
by them as by a Glass we may see our own weakness, and by our weakness our
wickedness, and by them both our accursedness: then cause thy sweet comforts
and consolations contained in thy Gospel, to shine into our Souls, by a true
and lively faith in Christ Jesus: beseeching thee, that our dry and stony
hearts may by the sweet Dews and Showers of thy Heavenly Spirit, be so moystned
and softened, that as good ground they may ever be yielding forth good fruit,
to the glorifying of thy name, to the suppressing of sin, and increasing of
Virtue, through Christ our Savior. Amen.
