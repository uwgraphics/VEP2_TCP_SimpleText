Reformation of Church Government in SCOTLAND, cleared from some mistakes and
prejudices.
WHile we, the meanest of many our Brethren, The occasion.
for a time separated from our particular callings and stations, and sent forth
into this Kingdom for a more public employment, are in all humility and
patience, waiting what the Lord who is about some great Work in his Church,
(for which are raised so great Commotions in these and other Kingdoms of the
earth) will be pleased to do for Reformation of Religion; the great Work of the
honorable houses of Parliament, and the reverend Assembly of Divines; and for
Uniformity in Religion, so much desired by all the godly in the three
Kingdoms: Unto whch an entrance is made by a solemn League and Covenant. We
find our selves bound against the prejudices and mistakings of some, who in
the dark are afraid of that which they know not, and suffer their affections of
love and hatred to run before their understanding; and against the
mis-representations and indirect aspersions of others, who do so commend their
own way, that the reformed Churches thereby suffer disparagement; To give that
testimony unto the order and government of the Reformed Churches, and
particularly of the Church of Scotland, which they do well deserve, and to
honor them whom the Lord has so highly honored, in advancing the Kingdom of
his Son, in the converting and saving of so many souls, and in opposing and
suppressing a world of corruptions, Heresies, and Schisms, by his wonderful
blessing upon their order and Government.

In this our humble testimony and true relation, Our intention.
unto which we are at this time thus necessitate, we shall endeavor nothing
but a simple and innocent manifestation and defense, without desire or
intention to give the smallest offense to any who fear God, love the Truth, and
desire to walk in truth and in love with their Brethren. This our profession,
we are confident will find credit with all that know us, and have observed our
ways since our coming into this Kingdom, which have been, and (so far as the
the truth will suffer us) ever shall be, to unite, and not to divide; to
compose, rather then to create differences; which we conceive also to be one
principal end, of the calling of the Assembly of Divines, and which all the
members of the Assembly, against all particular interests, are after a special
manner engaged to aim at and endeavor.

The order and Government of the reformed Churches in the beauty and strength
thereof, The Government of the Reformed Churches is known.
as it is not hid in a corner, wrapped up in a Mystery, or covered under a
cloud of darkness; but is known to the Nations and Kingdoms of the earth,
openly professed and practiced in the eyes of the world, and clearly seen, as a
City that is set on a hill, in the light of the Sun at noone day; So is it
commended, and already confirmed by a long tract of time, and the experience of
many years, and has been countenanced from Heaven, and blessed from above,
with the preservation of the truth and unity of Religion, against Heresies and
errors in Doctrine, Idolatry and corruptions in worship, and all sorts of
Sects and Schisms, wherewith it has been continually assaulted: How goodly
are thy Tents: O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles O Israel, etc. It has made the
Church of Christ terrible as an Army with banners, and like a strong and fenced
City, against which the Adversaries have despaired to prevail, but by making a
breach in this wall, and where they have gained ground or gotten any advantage,
either the wall has not been built, or being built has been broken down, or
not vigilantly kept by the Watchmen.

The Instruments which the Lord used in the blessed Work of Reformation of the
Church of Scotland (we speak not of the reformers of other Churches) were not
only learned and holy men, The Reformers of the Church of Scotland.
but had somewhat in their calling, gifts, and zeal to the glory of God, more
then ordinary: Their Adversaries were not able to resist the wisdom and Spirit
by which they spoke; some of them had a prophetical Spirit, manifested in
diverse particular and wonderful predictions, and some of them were honored to
be Martyrs, and sealed the truth with their blood: So that in them, in the
people of God converted by them, and and in the Reformation brought about by
the blessing of God upon their labors, against all the Learning, Pride,
Policy, and abused power of the time, there was to be seen a representation
of the Primitive and Apostolic times, and a new resurrection from the dead.
After them also did the Lord raise up in the Church of Scotland many burning
and shining lights, men of the same spirit, mighty in converting of souls,
walking in the same way, and who communicated their Counsels and kept
correspondence with Divines of other Nations, and with the greatest and purest
lights in the Church of England, in the point of Reformation and settling of
Church Government, which at that time was the common study and endeavor of
both, and wherein they and their Successors continued till the times of
defection, which made an unhappy interruption of the work. What men are like to
do in after times we cannot foresee; but we have not seen or heard of any to
this day, farrer from partiality and prejudice in the matters of God, then
their ways witness them to have been; and were they now living we believe
there would be none in the reformed Churches, so far swayed with partiality or
prejudice, that would deny them this testimony.

They had no other rule and pattern of Reformation but the word of God, The
rule and pattern of their Reformation.
and the practice of the Apostolic Churches in the Word. All the books of God
are perfect, the book of life, the book of nature, the book of providence, and
especially the book of Scripture, which was dy^ed by the Holy Ghost, to be a
perfect directory to all the Churches, unto the second coming of Jesus Christ;
but so that it presupposes the light and law of nature, or the rules of common
prudence, to be our guide in circumstances or things local, temporal, and
personal, which being Ecolesiastico Politica, are common to the Church with
civil societies, and concerning which, the Word gives general rules to be
universally and constantly observed by all persons, in all times and places: Of
things of this kind a godly and wise Divine gives two rules: One is, that the
Physician cannot by sending his letter to the Patient appoint the diet and
bath, the pulse must be touched, and as it is in the proverbiall speech,
gladiatorem oportet in arena capere consilium. The other is, that in things of
this kind, when the change is not to the better, it is both without and against
reason to make a change; without reason, because when the change is made unto
that which is but as good, the one and the other in reason are equal: Against
reason, because the change it self in such a case, is an hinderance to
Edification, savoureth of the love of Innovation, and derogateth to the
authority which makes the Constitution.

What they had once received, Their certainty in matters of Religion.
not upon probable grounds in way of conjecture, but upon the warrant of the
Word, and by the teaching of the spirit, with certainty of faith, that they
resolved to hold fast, and did hate every false way contrary unto it. They did
not in the matters of Religion rest upon a Skeptical or Pyrrhonian uncertainty
(the charge of the Orthodox Divines against the tenets of Arminians and
Socinians) which keeps the mind uncertain unstable, is a fountain of
perpetual alterations in the Church of God, an open door to all heresies and
schisms to enter by, and a ground of despairing to bring questions and
controversies to a final issue and determination. And for us, as upon the one
part, we not only conceive, that no man attaineth so full assurance of faith,
in any matter of Religion, but he may receive increase of his faith, and
therefore should always have his mind open and ready to receive more light
from the Word and Spirit of God: but also do ingenuously acknowledge (as we
have formerly professed) that we are most willing to hear and learn from the
Word of God, what needs further to be reformed in the Church of Scotland: Yet
God forbid, that we should never come to any certainty of persuasion, or that
we should ever be learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth; we
ought to be resolute and unmovable in so far as we have attained; and this we
take to be the ground, as of other practices, so also of Covenants and Oaths,
both assertory and promissory, in matters of Religion.

As they held it not sufficient, Their consent with other Reformed Churches.
to receive or retain some such practices, as other reformed Churches judged
warrantable; for thus they should have rested upon some few principles and
beginnings of Reformation, and might have differed as much in other things from
the Reformed Churches, as they agreed in some things with them; so can it not
be satisfactory, that any Church should only practice some things, universally
received in the Reformed Churches. (1) All Christian Churches, although very
different in ordinances and practices, yet do agree in some things, (2) If our
desire of Uniformity with other reformed Churches, and the reverend esteem we
have of them, draw us to conform to them in some things; upon the same reason
we ought to join in all things wherein they do all agree amongst themselves.
(3) Differences about Negatives and the denying of profession and practice in
other matters wherein they are all unanimous and uniform, may prove no less
dangerous and destructive, then differences about Affirmatives. The Arrians,
Socinians, and many others, do err dangerously in denying some positive points
and received principles of the doctrine of the reformed Churches, concerning
the Person of Christ, and his Offices. The Antinomians also (if we should
mention them) do also agree with us in the principles of Grace; but in their
superstructures and conclusions, run in a way destructive to the doctrine and
deductions of the Apostolic and reformed Churches, and to the principles
received by themselves. (4) Such Churches as make profession of differences
only in Negatives, or in denying some practices received in the reformed
Churches, have received, and do hold some positive practices of their own,
which the reformed Churches do not allow, and which to them are negative. Of
this (would we suffer our selves to descend into particulars) we might give
diverse known instances: now if they do not allow of the reformed Churches, in
so far as they do not admit of these their positive practices, how shall they
think that the reformed Churches can allow them in the like? for the rule is,
Wherein thou judge another, thou condemnest thy self, for thou that judge
do the same things.

They did honor Luther, Calvin, and many others, They are not to be called
Calvinians.
whether their Predecessors or contemporaries, who had heart or hand,
especially in an eminent degree, in the blessed work of Reformation: for their
direction, they made use of the light which such notable servants of Jesus
Christ did hold forth, in doctrine and discipline, and in all thankfulness
they did desire and wish, that their names might be had in eternal
remembrance: Nor was it possible that so great an alteration as the corrupt
state of the Church required could be effected, and not carry some remembrance
of the instruments: but for this to call us Calvinians; and the reformed
Churches, Calvinian reformed Churches, is to disgrace the true Churches of
Christ, and to simbolize with the Papists, who call themselves The Catholic
Church, and hold the rule delivered by Hierome against the Luciferians: If any
where we find men professing Christianity, called by the particular names of
men, know them to be the Synagogue of Antichrist, and not the Church of Christ.
The separation may be well allowed to be called Brownists, and others from the
matter wherein they err, and part from all, not only the reformed, but
Christian Churches, as the Monothelites of old, and the Anabapists now, may
bear their own names. They who apprehend any danger in names (as there is a
great deal of danger in them) ought not to appropriate unto their own opinion,
that which is common to all the reformed Churches, nor to join with Papists in
giving names of Sects unto the reformed Churches; and they who conceive no
evil in so doing, ought not to offend, that names are given unto them,
especially since their differences from the reformed Churches, must be designed
under some name and notion, and in this case charity commands the mildest
names, such as hint most clearly at the difference, and are farrest from
reproach, to be attributed unto them, as most discriminative and tolerable.

Nothing was farrer from their thoughts and intentions, Their Reformation was
not framed to State ends.
then to frame in their own forge a Lesbian rule, answerable to any particular
form of civil policy, or complyable with State ends. That they looked with
singleness of mind to the rule of Scripture, we give these three evidences
(1) The great pains they took in searching the will of God, and after they had
found it, their grievous sufferings from the civil authority in defense
thereof, of both which afterward in the own place (2) The restless objection
and continual opposition of politic men and Court Sycophants against
Presbyteriall government, as incompatible with Monarchy, and their manners (3)
And the necessary assertion of the true policy of the Church by Divines in both
Kingdoms (between whom there was no notable difference) demonstrating that it
was in it self unalterable, because divine, and yet complyable with every
lawful kind of humane policy and civil government, and able to keep a whole
Kingdom or state in a right and sure way of Religion. The Reformers not
biased, but benefited by education.
Our chiefest reformers, had indeed their education in other Churches, which
was the goodness of God to them and us: there did they see examples of
Reformation, and conversed with other reformers, by whom they were taught from
the word in the ways of God, and thence did they bring (as the Romans their
laws of old from Greece and other Nations) models of Church Government, that
comparing one with another, they might fix upon that which was builded upon the
foundation of the Apostles. Like as we account it no small happiness, that we
have bin educated in the Church of Scotland, and are acquainted with the
practice of Church Government there, which gives us much light and confidence
against such scruples and doubtings as are powerful enough to suspend the
assent of others, who by reason of their education in other Churches, are
strangers unto it. Nor do we know a reason why education in sound doctrine and
true worship, should be accounted a matter of thanksgiving to God, and yet
should glory in this, that we are not by education engaged in any one form of
of Discipline and Church Government, but left to our selves to be molded by
our own private thoughts.

They intended and designed from the beginning, They intended Presbyteriall
Government from the beginning.
the Government of the Church by Assemblies and Presbyteries, although they
could not attain that perfection at first in the infancy of Reformation, but
gave place to necessity, which in such cases is universal, and in this they
followed the example and practice of the Churches planted by the Apostles,
which if not at first, yet afterward were of greater number in one City, then
did or could ordinarily assemble in one place for the worship of God, and
therefore had a plurality of Pastors and Officers, which made up a common
Presbytery for governing the whole: They set up such Officers in the Church, as
were both necessary and sufficient for the Church, Pastors, Teachers, ruling
Elders, and Deacons: They did not permit such as are called Laymen, and
intended to continue such, to preach or prophecy in the Congregation, nor did
they admit of any other ruling Elders, but such as are solemnly elected and
ordained, although they do maintain themselves upon their own means, and attend
their own particular Callings, which is not incompatible with their Office,
especially they being appointed in a number competent and proportionable to the
number of the people, and quantity of the Congregation; And their
Ecclesiastical charge, not being pastoral, nor requiring any great meditation
or study apart, but such as they may easily attend, without neglect of their
own particular affairs.

What shall be rendered unto the Magistrate by others, What they give unto the
Magistrate.
whose particular tenets are not yet known either to the Church or Magistrate,
unless it be in a hid and secret way, unto which we are not privy, we cannot
determine: but the doctrine of the Reformed Churches, concerning the honor and
obedience due to the Magistrate, is openly known by their confessions of faith,
and long continued practices; and this much we know, that the principles both
of Civil and Church Government, are laid out in Scripture, and therefore the
one cannot be contrary to the other, or they inconsistent between themselves.
Nor do we measure the power of the Magistrate by the principles of
Presbyteriall Government, but both of them by the Word, and therefore deny not
unto the Magistrate what God gives them; and more then this dare we not
profess, for any respect to our selves, or to the form of Ecclesiastical
Government professed by us: How much, and for what ends, the Pagans and
Infidels of old, the Papists, Prelates, and Arminians of late, have labored to
make the way of Christ hateful to Princes and Magistrates, is too well known,
and has been bitterly felt, yet God has cursed this policy in the end. There
may be good reason to express our judgment of this or other points of duty
from Scripture: but to avouch when we are not challenged, and that only in the
general, by way of comparison, That we ascribe more to the Magistrate, then
the reformed Churches do, they being faithful to their own principles of
Ecclesiastical Government, may suffer a harder construction, then we our
selves would willingly under-go, or put upon the intentions of men, who seek
not their own things, but the things of Jesus Christ.

As the blessed Instruments of Reformation proceeded by no other rule but the
Word of God, Their diligent search for true Church Government, and the good
hand of God upon them.
so did they with great judgment and learning, which they had in a measure
above others, examine and frame all things diligently and exactly according to
the rule; and although the Reformers in England were either altogether, or for
the greater part taken up with the Doctrine; yet in the Church of Scotland it
was otherwise. After the doctrine was established, which was speedily done,
they were exercised in Conferences and Assemblies, with debating the matters of
Discipline and Government above the space of 20 years, which endured much
opposition from authority, from worldly men, and from the adversaries of the
Truth, both Prelaticall on the one hand, and upon the other hand Separatists,
of which sort some came into Scotland from England, which was unto them a
whetstone to quicken them, and to make them the more circumspect and exact in
their way, which lay in the middle, betwixt Episcopacy upon the one hand, and
popular confusion on the other. It pleased the Lord, whose presence and
blessing they sought after in these days with frequent prayer and humiliation,
both in private and in the public National Assemblies, so to assist and lead
them in all truth; that the Church of Scotland was honored from abroad, both
from England and other Nations, with the testimony of such a Reformation, as
other Churches accounted to be the greatest happiness upon earth, and when
they were wishing after a Reformation, they made it the measure of their
wishes. We would willingly shun comparisons, were we not brought upon this
strain: We do upon very good reason judge the Church of England in the midst
of her Ceremonies, to have been a true Church, and the ministry thereof,
notwithstanding the many blemishes and corruptions cleaving unto it, to have
been a true ministry, and shall never deny unto them that praise, whether in
debating controversies with Papists, or in practical Divinity for private
Christians, which they do most justly deserve. Upon the other part, we are
neither so ignorant nor so arrogant, as to ascribe to the Church of Scotland
such absolute purity and perfection, as has not need or cannot admit of
further Reformation. Yet that there is a wide difference betwixt the one and
the other, acknowledged also in the Common Covenant; We bring two famous
witnesses from the Church of England to prove: The one is Brightman; Loath
would I be (says he, speaking of the Church of Scotland) to provoke any man to
envy, or to grieve him with my words: Yet this I must say, There is no place
where the Doctrine sounds more purely, the worship of God is exercised more
uncorruptly, where more faithful diligence of the Pastor does flourish, or
more free or willing obedience is given by the people, nor yet where there is
greater reverencing of the whole Religion amongst all orders. And afterward*
Neither does it only keep the Doctrine of salvation free from corruption, but
it does also both deliver in writing, and exercise in practice, that sincere
manner of government whereby men are made partakers of salvation, Revel. of the
Apocal. cap. 37. The other is Cartwright: Yea, the Scottish Nation, which were
some years behind us in the profession of the Gospel, the first day almost
that they received the truth, did by many degrees in the way of purity outstrip
us. These two witnesses, unto which we might add many other from the reformed
Churches in other Nations, bear testimony, that there is no such thing in the
Church of Scotland, as might prove her to be no Church, or bar Communion in
worship with her, as the Liturgy, Ceremonies and Prelacy in the Church of
England; or that the Corruptions of the one and the other are of the same
kind, equally destructive of the essence of a Church, and equally impedetive
of Communion and worship. All visible Churches, which have been, or shall be at
any time on earth, consist of persons good and bad, Sheep and Goats, Wheat and
Tares, such as walk Christianly and such as walk inordinatly: Which therefore
must also be the condition of the Church of Scotland, yet the order of the
Church, admits not either ignorant or openly profane and scandalous
persons, to the participation of the Lords supper: If any Pastor and particular
Eldership be negligent in their duty, it is their fault, who are to bear
their own guiltiness, and ought not to be imputed to the order of the Church,
which stands in force against it. We may be very confident, that the godly
people, who did transplant themselves out of this Island, (the fame of whose
piety and zeal shall never suffer detraction or the smallest diminution from
our thoughts or words) might have lived in the Church of Scotland, enjoying the
pure Ordinances of God, with peace in their consciences and comfort to their
souls, and would have willingly come into Scotland, when they went into
New England, could they have been free of the usurpation and tyranny of Prelates
and the Prelatical party, which at that time did reign and rage in that
Kingdom, vexing the Godly Ministry and people there, with many and bitter
sufferings.

The two extremes of the true form of Church Government, The defense thereof
against adversaries on both hands.
which stands in the middle way betwixt Popish and Prelaticall Tyranny, and
Brownisticall and popular Anarchie, were contrary one to another, and have
their own degrees of Tyranny or Anarchie in themselves, which is the cause of
their sub-divisions, fractions, and differences amongst themselves: but both
sides agree, and strongly join in opposing the true Government, which standing
constantly, and without variation between the one and the other, is contrary to
both. This is the true cause (nor could it be otherwise) that on what hand the
invasion was hotest, there the defense was strongest. Against Prelacie which
had many friends, and therefore made many enemies to Presbyteries, the
Presbyteriall power and pens were long pleading: No sooner is the Prelaticall
party, by the power and blessing of God, begun to be subdued in this Island;
but arises unexpectedly, The opposition on the other hand, waiting the
opportunity, stronger then it was before, which moved some of our Divines of
late, to write on this hand in defense of the government of the reformed
Churches, as others had done before them in other Churches. In France Beza, and
against Morellius Sadeel. Two National Synods also of the reformed Churches in
France, the one at Orleans in the year 1561. Another at Rothel 1571. And in all
the reformed Churches, governed by Presbyteries and Assemblies, the positive
grounds of the Government are laid open, which work equally against Adversaries
on both sides, and have been applied against them prove nata as they did arise
or show themselves. If so much have not been written upon one hand as the
other, in a polemicall and Anaskeuastick way, let it be attributed unto the
Adversary, which was but obscure and weak, and from whom small danger was
apprehended* it being laid for a common ground by them all, That where a whole
Nation is converted to the Christian faith, every particular Church is not to
be left to it self, as if it were alone in a Nation, but that Christ had
provided a way, and there is a necessity of a common National Government, to
preserve all the Churches in Unity and Peace.

It is the Will of God, Their sufferings for the true Church government.
and has been always the constant course of Divine providence, that when his
servants have been diligent in searching the truth, and zealous by professing
and preaching, to hold it forth unto others, that they confirm and seal the
truth, which they have believed and professed with their confession and
suffering. The Church of Scotland had many Confessors, diverse Pastors brought
before the Lords of Council, the High Commission, Diocesan Synods, were
removed from their places, deprived of all the means of their livelihood; some
confined, others imprisoned: a third sort brought into England, whence some of
them were never suffered to return, all of them for the Government of the
Church. Others for the same cause were proceeded against by the criminal
Judge, condemned of Treason, sentenced to death, and after long imprisonment,
before and after the sentence, could find no other mercy, but perpetual
banishment, wherein the greater part of them ended their days, without any
Congregation, or Company of their own Nation, rich or poor, to comfort them.
So many of these witnesses as were suffered to live in their own Land, did not
undergo any voluntary exile; but in much poverty and affliction, went up and
down, teaching and confirming the good people, and waiting for a spring time,
wherein the face of God might again shine upon his Church and (to use their
own expression) some buds might arise out of the stumpe of Church government
left in the earth. Had they at that time abandoned the poor oppressed Church,
when they were put from their places, and deprived of their liberty, and had
carried away with them such of the people as were of their mind, they had (if
we would judge according to ordinary providence, and the course of second
causes) opposed the poor desolated Church for a prey to Episcopal oppression,
and made the case of Religion in that Kingdom desperate: Or if they should
have returned upon a revolution of extraordinary providence, they would have
preferred the sufferings of their Brethren left behind them in the midst of
the fiery trial, unto their own exile, and would have been loath to have
impeded or retarded the late Reformation, with any thing they had brought with
them from abroad: so many as returned from constrained banishment, having in
all Unity of mind, and heart joined in the work of Reformation.

The Church of Scotland, Their exercising of that true Church government for
which they had done and suffered so much.
as all other reformed Churches, has used the power of the Keys, and
Churchcensures of all sorts, especially the gravest of excommunication, with
such sharpness and severity, and yet with such caution and moderation, as it
has been very powerful and effectual, to preserve the Name of God from being
blasphemed, the Church and people of God from contagion, and the Delinquents
brought under censure from destruction; which are the ends proposed by them in
executing the censures or the Church, and where such scandalls arise, whether
in matter of opinion or practice, as are apt to make the Name of God to be
blasphemed, are dangerous for the Church, and waste the Consciences of the
sinners themselves, being accompanied with obstinacy and contempt of
Ecclesiastical Authority, they do apply this last remedy, according to the
order prescribed by Christ, against scandalous transgressors; To limit the
censure of excommunication in matter of opinion, to the common and
uncontroverted principles; and in the matter of manners, to the common and
universal practices of Christianity; and in both, to the parties known
light, is the dangerous doctrine of the Arminians, and Socinians, opens a
wide door, and proclaims liberty to all other practices and errors, which
are not fundamental, and universally abhorred by all Christians, and tends
to the overthrow of the Reformed Religion: which we wish all sound and sober
spirits to abstain from, lest it render them and their profession suspected of
some such opinions and practices, as in charity we judge to be far from
their minds and ways.

Two main objections are made against the principles and practice of the order
and government of the reformed Churches, This government necessary for Churches
living together.
for which the Church and Kingdom of Scotland, have done and suffered so much
of old and of late. One is, that there is no need of the Authoritative power of
Presbiteries and Synods, and that the exhortation of particular Churches one to
another, the Protestation of one against another, and the withdrawing of
communion one from another, may be a sufficient remedy, and no less
effectual against all offenses, then excommunication it self: especially if
the Magistrate shall vouchsafe his assistance, and interpose his authority,
for strengthening the sentence of Noncommunion?

To this we answer.

1. That this Objection supposes a case, which has not been found in the
Church of Scotland for the space of above fourscore years, and which we
believe was never heard of in any of the Reformed Churches, except those of the
separation: the pronouncing of Non-communion or Excommunication against a whole
Church. Our excommunication has been executed, and but seldom against
particular members, never against a whole Church, and we think never shall
be, and therefore this imaginary fear of that which never falls forth, is
not considerable: Rules are made for ordinary and usual cases.

2. What shall be the remedy where the censure is mutual, and two or more
Churches mutually protest, and pronounce the sentence of Non-communion one
against other? unless there be a common Presbytery, or Synod made up of the
whole, which may decide the controversy, and give order unto the several
Churches. This Non-communion may prove a mean of division, rather then union.

3. In this Exhortation, Protestation, and Non-communion, there is no more to
be found, then one particular member may do against another, which yet is
acknowledged to be unsufficient for removing of offenses, unless the
authority of the Church, of which both of them be members, shall interveine:
Were it in the power of particular members to submit, or not submit, as they
please, there would be as great difference and division amongst members, as
now there is amongst Churches.

4. What shall be done if the Magistrate be negligent or care for none of those
things? or if his Authority cannot be obtained? or if he be of another
Religion, and foment the difference for his own politic ends? has not the
wisdom of the Son of God provided remedies in the Church for all the
internal necessities of the Church, and constitute it a perfect body within it
self.

5. By what probability can it be made to appear to any Rational man and
indifferent mind, that no Authority shall be as valide as authority against
the obstinate, that via admonitionis, and requisitionis, is equal with via
citationis, and publicae authoritatis: There cannot be so much as trial and
examination of the offense without Authority, unless the party be willing to
appear: that persuasion and Jurisdiction, that the delivering over to Satan,
and thereby striking the Conscience with the terror of God, by the authority
of Jesus Christ, which has the promise of a special and strong ratification
in Heaven, and any other Ecclesiastical way whatsoever, which must be
inferior to this, and depend only upon persuasion on the one part, and free
will on the other, can be supposed to be a like efficacious. No man will say,
but in civil matters, it is one thing to have ado with our neighbor, who
has no more authority over us, then we have over him; and another thing to
have to do with civil power which has authority over both.

The other Objection is: This government agreeeth with the liberty and
equality of particular Churches.
That by this Authority and Order of Government, one Church has power over
another, which is contrary to that liberty and equality Christ has endued his
Churches with, and is no other but a new Prelaticall dominion set over the
Churches of Christ?

To this we answer.

1. That we are very far from imposing or acknowledging any such collateral
power of one particular Church over another, nay not of the greatest, in all
respects whatsoever over the smallest, for God has made them equal one to
another. The power which we maintain, is aggregative of the Officers of many
congregations over the particular members of their Corporation: even as a
member of the Natural body is not subject to another; but each one of them to
the whole Man consisting of them all: And as one Member of Parliament, one
Counselor; or to go lower, one member of a company, is not subject to
another, but every one to the whole College: The same may be said of towns
and cities: so is it with particular congregations combined in one Presbytery.
All the Reformed Churches acknowledge the Independencie of one particular
Church upon another.

2. It is as miserable a mistake to compare Presbyteries and Prelates together:
for the courts of Prelates are altogether foreign and extrinsecall to the
congregations over which they rule, and then indeed the Metropolitan Church
usurpeth and tyrannizeth over other Churches: but the power of Presbeteries in
intrinsecall and natural, they being constitute of the Pastors and Elders of
the particular congregations over which they are set: So that another without
themselves does not bear rule over them; but all of them together by common
consent do rule over every one, which is a most mild and free form of
Church Government: it being no more contrary to the liberty of a particular
Church to be ruled by a common Collegiate Presbytery, or Ecclesiastic Senate,
then it is for a Member of a particular congregation to be ruled by his own
particular Eldership.

3. Were this way of government as well known by experience unto others, as it
is unto us, it would be accounted rather Subsidium, then Dominium, and would
be looked at, rather as auxiliary to particular Ministers and Elderships, then
authoratative over them, especially since they neither ordain nor depose
Ministers, they discern no censure, nor sentence of Excommunication of any
Member, without the knowledge and consent of the congregation which is
particularly concerned therein: whatsoever their authority be, the Minister and
particular Eldership are advised, assisted, and strengthened, rather then
commanded, enjoined, or forced: which the particular Churches should much
rather choose, then through want of counsel and assistance, suffer themselves
to run rashly upon Deposition or Excommunication, and afterward either be
brought to the neighboring Churches to the public confession of their error,
which lesseneth their authority afterward, or to have the sentence of
Non-communion pronounced against them, which must be the cause of Schism or
scandal.

So much for the present have we said, This government useful and beneficial
to all sorts of persons.
not for confutation; but merely for justifying our own, and other Reformed
Churches, against such misrepresentings and mistakings, as in matters of
Religion are too frequent in this place at this time, to the perverting and
abusing of simple and unstable minds, which will never be brought to a
consistence and unity, without this true order and government of the Church,
and the blessing of God from heaven upon his own ordinance. Were Magistrates
and civil powers acquainted with the power thereof, they would find their
authority increased, their work more easy, and their places more comfortable
thereby. Such as are most adverse to this order and government (if they allow
no material difference in doctrine, worship, or practice) might enjoy their
peace, and all the comforts of their Ministry and profession under it, without
controlment, from that authoritative power which they so much apprehend. The
Church of England which God has blessed with so much learning and piety, by
this Reformation and Uniformitie with other Reformed Churches, which all of us
have solemnly sworn and subscribed, sincerely, really, and constantly through
the grace of God, to endeavor in our several places and callings, should be a
praise in the Earth.

FINIS.
