To the READER.
Christian Reader, and all Sober People, that have Read Roger Williams his
Book, and may come to Read this Answer,
THough we are sorry, we have this occasion, that R. W. has given us, to give
forth this Reply and Dispute with him of his Slanderous Proposals (we cannot
look upon them otherwise, but so; and therefore for Truth's sake, as it is in
JESUS, and for the Name of Christ and true Christianity have we been
constrained to Answer him, as we have done both in Dispute and in this:) Yet we
have so much Charity to believe, that all the Professors in New England are not
of his Judgment; and those that are, they are like to bear their own Burden,
whether they are Priests or Magistrates. But of all the Books I ever read, I
never saw so much Foul Language and Contradictions (which would swell up a Book
too much, if we should let the Reader see them all distinct) And also so many
false Conclusions and Inferences, that he has made, and Invented Words and
Principles to be ours, which we never Heard of before, neither ever were in our
Thoughts: and then, when he has done, he Raileth at them and us. If a Man had
sold himself to Work Wickedness, and (Inspired with a dark Power and Spirit) to
invent Falsehood against an Innocent and Suffering People, Roger Williams has
done it; who abuses his Pen, abuses the Press, abuses his Neighbors; and he
living in a Peaceable Government: Which when the People called Quakers had the
Government, they never molested him. AND so it is not only the Quakers, but
other Sorts of People, that he flies out against; which we question, whether
ever he had so much Modesty, as to speak to any of their Faces: But this has
been his Work, to defile Peoples Minds with his Lies, Slanders, Falsehoods and
Forgeries of things against us, which we do Abhor: as may be seen in his Book.
And that which we desire is, That the Lord may give him REPENTANCE, and all
that join with him, if it be his Will, and it be not bid from his and his
Consederates Eyes.

And let but the Reader read Roger Williams's former Books, and compare them
with this, that he has written now, and see, how he Contradicts himself: and
see, what a great Occasion he and his Brother take against J. B. for calling
him Old Man, or saying, He would not bear upon the Old Man, because of his Age,
and that he pitied him, etc. when he brought his false Charges against us, and
could not make them good. But let the Reader see all his foul Language in his
Book (who styles himself an Orator to the King, and let the Reader judge,
whether he is worthy of that Title, out of whose Mouth are come so many.
Corrupt Words, Accusing or Blaming us for saying in pity to him, That he was an
Old Man? But let the Reader see, if such Language becomes Gray Hairs?) together
with his Forgeries, that he has Forged and Published against an Innocent and
Suffering People. And if the New England Priests and Governors have tolerated,
and aided and assisted him in the Printing of his Book against us, we cannot
expect any otherways, who have been our Persecutors, and some to DEATH; and so
we must leave him and them to the Lord, and Vengeance is his, and he will
Reward every one of them according to their Words and Works: Which certainly he
will do, and none shall escape the Omnipotent Hand of God. And our Hope, and
Trust and Confidence is in the LORD, the Living God, and we do not fear, what
Man can do unto us: for had we, we had never stood your WHIPPING-STOCKS, your
GALLOUSES to DEATH (whose BLOOD Cries to God through the Nations) and your
CUTTING OFF EARS, and your HOT BRANDING-IRON, and your Cruel Mockings, and
Threats, and SPOILING of GOODS, and besides all the Lies, and Slanders and
Forgeries, that have been Forged against us; So that Christ's Saying is
fulfilled among you, They shall speak ALL MANNER of EVIL for his Name's sake
against his People: so it is not One Manner, but ALL MANNER. But we can Triumph
in the Love of God and the Lord JESUS Christ; and desire the Lord to Forgive
you (if it be his Will) for all your Wickedness, that ye have done and spoken
against us, and that ye may all come to see your selves, Whose Servants ye have
been? and Whose Work ye have been doing? and Whom ye have followed? And what
Spirit ye are of, not to be of Christ's, who came to Save Men's Lives, and not
to Destroy them.

And we must further Declare, that we cannot Trust our Bodies and Souls in the
Hands of such, that do not know, what Spirit they are of themselves, and have
not Power over their own Raging and Persecuting Spirits; who are Like unto a
City, whose Walls are broken down. But our Trust is in Christ, who is the Chief
Shepherd, whom we are turned to; who Feeds us in his Pasture of Life: Our
Bishop to Oversee us, and our Prophet, that God has raised up, like unto
Moses, whom we do Hear, etc. And our Counselor and Leader, that God has
given us: our Priest, that has Died for us, and Risen for our Justification;
and at the Right Hand of God: who is our Mediator (the Man Christ Jesus)
betwixt us and God; and is the Author and Finisher of our Faith: And is our
High Priest over the Household of Faith, and does Sanctify us, and Wash us with
his Precious Blood; that he may present us to God without Spot or Wrinkle, or
Blemish, o^ any such thing: Who Rules in our Hearts by Faith, and in his Grace
and Light, Power, and Spirit and Truth, that comes by him; That in the Spirit
we come to sit down in him, as the Saints did of Old, our REST, yea, in
Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus: And so can praise God through JESUS Christ,
YEA and AMEN, the First and the Last.

A New England Firebrand Quenched: OR, An Answer to a Lying, Slanderous Book
Printed at Boston in the Year 1676. by one Roger Williams of Providence in
New England; which he Dedicateth to the KING, with Desires, That (if the
most-High please) Old and New England may flourish, when the Pope and Mahomet,
Rome and Constantinople are in their Ashes, etc.
R. W. ANd in his Title Page he begins thus: George Fox dug out of his
Burrowes; Or an Offer of a Skirmish upon (R. W 's) 14 Proposals made this last
Summer 1672. unto G. F. present on Rode-Island; Tit. p
and that (G. F. slily departing) the Disputation went on as aforesaid. And in
his Narration of the Conference or Dispute he again asserts, that he challenged
G. F. by writing, and all his Friends then met at Rode-Island; and that then G.
F. withdrew. And farther in his second Page says, he sent his Paper of
Proposals unto G. F. at Newport. R W 's Contradiction.
And in the 4 and 5 pages he says, he sent his Paper to Capt. Cranston, Deputy
Governor of Rode Island. And further scornfully says; The old Fox thought it
best to run for it, and leave the work to his Journey-men and Chaplains, etc.
And in the 22 and 23 Pages he further says, Within some few days, after the
Deputy Governor had delivered his Paper to them, the strange Quakers, ( as was
agreed with G. Fox) etc.

Answ. How dare R. W. to Dedicate such palpable Lies to the King? For this R.
W. never spoke to G. F. nor did G. F. receive any Letter from this R. W. and
yet he impudently says (p. 23) As was agreed with G. F. Nor did G. F. receive
any of these 14 Proposals from him, though he says, These 14 Proposals were
made last Summer unto G. F. and that he dug him out of his Buroughs: Which
Proposals G. F. not only never received, but never saw, nor so much as knew of
them; though R. W. scornfully and falsely says, G. F. slily departed; and that
G. F. has plucked in his Horns, as J. T. did, etc. But in this does R. W.'s.
wickedness farther appear, in that J. T. might have received Letters from him;
but G. F. never received any from him, nor knew.

R. W. farther says, He sent his Proposals to G. F. to Newport; and yet page 4
says, He sent them to the Deputy Governor Cranston. [But G. F. never so much
as received, or saw any such Proposals from the Deputy Governor, or knew of
any such thing, when he went off the Island.] And yet R. W. says ( page 5) That
G. F. knew, he was furnished with Artillery out of G. F.'s own writings, and
that he knew the Consequence that would follow; and therefore the old Fox
thought, it was best to run for it, and leave his Journey-Men, etc.

An. This also is untrue, for G. F. knew nothing of his Accusations, or
pretended proof, which R. W. vainly calls his Artillery; nor that he ever read,
much less objected any thing against G. F.'s Book. Oh! how dare thou Roger
Williams, publish such false lies to the World, when thou know in thy
Conscience, that G. F. had never any Writing, or Letter, or Proposals from
thee: neither did he ever exchange a word with thee. The Lord God of Heaven
knows it, and the Deputy Governor knows, that I received none of thy
Writings or Papers of Proposals by him. Behold all sober people the foundation
of this man's Attempt, the beginning of his work; and since the foundation of
thy Book is a notorious lie, the building upon such a foundation of lies is not
like to be otherwise: which lies thou have made thy refuge; as throughout thy
Book may be evidently seen. For except a man had sold himself to work falsehood,
and make lies; he could not have done more wickedly, and have uttered falser
charges then thou have done. But the Lord God which knows them, and sees thy
evil design in them, will sweep them away with the besom of Destruction, and
clear his people from thy manifest false tongue. And I doubt not but the Deputy
Governor will testify for me, that I am clear of this charge; and that I
never saw, nor knew that which R. W. writ, and sent to him.

But which is strange, though G. F. was several weeks at Rode-Island, and at
Providence (where it seems, this old Priest R. W. dwells) and in all that time
he never spoke to G. F. nor writ to him of any such thing: but sends its like,
these his Papers to the Deputy Governor; what was in them (as I said) I knew
not, they being delivered to him, after I was gone of the Island, as he writes
himself.

For his dating of his Letter, what was that to G. F? for J.T. tells R. W. of
his misdating of his Letter, as R. W. confesses himself in his 11 p. wherein he
writes to J. T. Your second Letter I received misdated as well as mine. But by
this all may see the wickedness, that is in the Bottle of this R. W. by what
does flow out of it in his Book, to wit, A malicious spirit against G. F. who
was never concerned with him by word or writing, much less did G. F. ever do
him wrong. And yet he says, G. F. well knew, what Artillery he was furnished
with out of his own bald writings, (as he scoffingly calls them) etc. when
never a word of this is true: though he presumes to present it to the King for
Truth concerning G. F.

R. W. Again he says ( p. 4, 5) that it was concluded and agreed in a Juncto at
Newport, that his Letter should not be delivered to the Deputy Governor, until
G. F. was gone.

Ans. This also is an abominable falsehood, the Lord knows it, a groundless
untrue imagination of his own; for there was no such Agreement or Consultation.
Is this man fit to write of Religion, that lies? a vain man! What is he, and
his designs, that they should require Consultations and Junctos? So let the
honest Reader Judge, from whence R. W. had all these lies, if not from his
Father the Devil, who is out of Truth: but with the Truth is both his Father
and he Judged. And this is R. W.'s Landscape (as he calls it) of the Battle
fought betwixt him and the Quakers. But G. F. never spoke with him, nor
received any Challenge from him: and yet this man can boast, and says G. F.
slily withdrew and fled (Which untruth is more then slily suggested; for it is
impudently asserted by R. W.) But it is well known by many in that Country,
that G. F. was long enough upon Rode-Island; that if R. W. had any mind to have
written to him, or spoken to him, he might have easily had an opportunity. But
it was R. W. that was slily in his buroughs then, and kept in his Horns, who
had nothing to say to G. F. to his face, whilst he was upon the Colony and
Province of Rode-Island.

And it seems but reasonable, that he should have written to G. F. as well as
to the Deputy Governor, if he had a mind, that G. F. should have seen it: but
the Lord, who is over all knows and sees his creeping and lying Spirit, and
from whence it does proceed. And though he may deceive some with these his
lies, and very vain boasts, as that G. F. knew what he had against him, what
Artillery he had gotten, and what Consequences would roll down the Mountains
upon him: (these are R. W. his own expressions) yet G. F. stands in his
innocence in the power of God over it all; nor can such Trash deceive any, that
are of a sober and temperate Spirit, and make Conscience of what they believe.
But this lying Spirit would be seen to defend the Protestant Religion; but it
is his own Religion (if he has any) that is out of Truth, that he would defend:
And this is like the persecuting Spirit of the professors of New England, as
will be further manifested in time.

R. W. And all that read his Epistle, may see, how he goes about to flatter the
King, Epistle to the King.
[but the Lord knows his heart, and the hearts of you New England Professors
were and are manifest] And all that read his Epistle to the King, may see, what
mere flattery it is, who says; That because he heard it affirmed, that the King
had one of most of the Quakers Books, therefore says R. W. he will present the
King the Protestant Truth more justly, then his Popish and Arminian Opposites
did offend his Royal Eyes with smoke out of the deep Pit.

Ans. Does not R. W. here abuse the King? and yet hopes for Patronage under
him. But does R. W. think, that the King will not see through his flatteries
and vain applauses?

R W. And after this, Roger, thou tells the King, The Pope and the Quakers
pretend to Enthusiasme and Infallibilities; and then thou boasts, that thou
have detected much of their Impostures: and then thou desire, His Royal
Spirit may he preserved from both their cheats, which is the Oracle of Hell in
their mouths.

Ans. Ah! R. W. do thou think, the King will not see through thy words here
again? But for the Oracle of Hell, thou should have looked at home for it, as
thy following words will manifest it. But is New England such a Glory to the
Protestant Name, as thou boasts of, and would have the King believe? the King
knows you better, who have Hanged, Cut off Ears, Burnt with hot Iron, Banished,
Whipped so many of the true Protestants, and King's Subjects too: did ever the
Papists do worse?

R. W. And yet thou say to the King, If the Most-High please, Old and
New England may flourish, when the Pope and Mahomet, Rome, and Constantinople
are in Ashes.

Ans. How now Roger, what a selfish Prayer is this? Do thou think, that God,
or Christ or the King, or any at White Hall will hear this Prayer? is this a
Loyal Subject, or an Affectionate Orator at the Throne of Grace? But why
would thou have Rome and Constantinople in the Ashes? why would have these
two Cities in the Ashes? What hurt do these Cities to thee and the New England
Priests and Professors? And why would thou have the Pope and Mahomet burnt?
and not only so, but the Cities of Rome and Constantinople also? what smoke is
this, that is come out of thy Pit? Wast thou not speaking but now of the Popish
and Arminian Opposites, that did offend the Kings Royal Eyes? and why would
have Rome and Constantinople, and Mahomet, and the Pope in Ashes to smoke and
offend the King's Eyes? But do thou think that either God, or Christ, or the
King, or any true Protestant will receive thy unmerciful, unnatural and wicked
Prayer? Here the King and his Council may see, what Spirit the New England
Priests are of, by Roger Williams their great Orator.

For if the Pope and Mahomet be Enemies, were not thou to love them according
to Christ's Doctrine? where is thy Christianity now Roger? And if the Pope or
Mahomet have destroyed any for Religion, art not thou as bad as they? nay
worse, because thou professest thyself a better Christian: And yet thou would
not only have Pope and Mahomet burnt to Ashes, but their Cities also; which
include hundreds of thousands of People, and some Protestants too, that may be
there. But here it is plain, (as in Luke 9.) that thou do not know, what
Spirit thou art of; as Christ told James and John, better men then thee, when
they said, Will thou, that we command Fire to come down from Heaven, even as
Elias did? but Christ turned him about, and rebuked them, and said, You know
not, what Spirit you are of; for the Son of man is not come to destroy men's
lives, but to save them. And so R. W. thou do not know thy own Spirit; and
therefore art very unfit to direct other Men's. But if R. W. had been such an
Orator, and able Minister of Christ, he had better have gone and Preached
Repentance to the Pope and Mahomet, and not to rail against them behind their
backs; as he does here against G. F. and others, who never had to do with him.
And would not many people suffer besides Papists and Mahometans, if Rome and
Constantinople should be burnt? would this cause Old and New England to
flourish? this is rising by the Ruins of others. Is this his Christian Practice
and Doctrine, and way of Converting the Nations to God? but how short is R. W.
of the Royal Law of God, To do unto all men, as he would have them do unto him.
But the People of God (called Quakers) are not of R. W.'s mind; for they have
the mind of Christ, and would have the Pope and Papists, and Mahometans to
r^pent: and do no^ ^^sire to see Rome nor Constantinople in their Ashes; but in
the Truth, as it is in ^ESVS. But all may see, what is in this New England
P^iest's heart (his mouth has published it, and spoken it to the King^ who has
not the Spirit, nor words of a true Christian, which is, To love Enemies, and
pray for them; not Persecute, and burn to Ashes them that evilly entreat them.
O this wicked, envious, destroying Spirit, that would depopulate the Earth to
satisfy it is evil mind, the Lord rebuke it! But now, would New England
Professors and R. W. their Orator like it well, if the Pope and Turk should
pray, that New England, and he and them should be burnt to Ashes?

And R. W. says in his Epistle to the people called Quakers, Epistle to the
Quakers.
From his Childhood (now above Threescore years) the ^ather of Light and Mercy
has touched his soul with a love to himself; to his only begotten the true
Lord Jesus, to his Holy Scriptures, etc. His infinite wisdom has given him to
s^e the City, Court and Country, the Schools and Universities of his Native
Country, to converse with some Jews, Turks and Papists, and all sorts of
Protestants, and by Books to know the affairs and Religions of all Countries.

Ans. Roger, if thy Judgment and knowledge be no better of Jews, Turks,
Papists and Protestants, and Religions, then it is of the People of God called
Quakers, thy Knowledge and Judgment is little worth for all thy great boast.
Thou tells us of thy Knowledge: and if th^s be the end of thy Threescore-years
work, it is sad, to publish so many falsehoods to the world against the People of
God (which thou had not from the Father of Lights) and at this Age to desire
Pope, Turk, Rome and Constantinople were in Ashes; which thou received not from
the God of Mercies, nor his only begotten the true Lord Jesus, nor from the
Holy Scriptures, but from the Father of lies, the destroyer, who appeared
against the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, and against Adam and Eve in
Paradise. And Roger, we desire, that thou may see a day of Repentance, if it
be not hid from thy eyes.

R. W. Thy Conclusion is: Be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee, Mat. 9.
and it is one of the joyful^t sounds that ever came to poor sinful ears. How to
obtain this s^und from the mouth of the Mediator that spoke it, is the greatest
Dispute betwixt the Protestants, and the bloody Wh^re of Rome: this is also the
great point betwixt the Protestants and your selves ( to wit, the Quakers.)

Ans. As for the Papists we leave them to answer R, W. themselves, but we never
had this Dispute before, how to obtain this sound from the mouth of the
Mediator (to wit, Christ Jesus) that is to say, be of good cheer, thy sins be
forgiven thee. Now, if R. W. or any of his dark Company does not know, how to
obtain this sound from the mouth of Christ the Mediator, (which he says, is the
Dispute betwixt the Papists and them, and them and the Quakers, though they
both hear the sound or report of it) if this be the Question, we tell him and
them, by faith* as they did in Matthew. 9. and by believing in the Light, which
comes from Jesus, which Jesus has enlightened them withal, with which they
may see their sin; and by believing in it see Christ their Savior and
Mediator, and hear his Heavenly voice, saying, be of good cheer, thy sins be
forgiven thee. Which the Quakers have heard, and so are his Sheep, and know his
voice, and follow him; who gives them Life Eternal, and would have none to
perish, Joh. 10. So we are to hear him, (and not to turn away from him) that
speaks from Heaven, etc. Heb. 12, 25, 26.

R. W. And further he says: As also in Order to this to know, what man is (to
the utmost) now by Nature? and what the true Lord Jesus is? and other
Controversies discussed in this Book, not unworthy this your serious Weighing
(as Mary did) in the Hearts and Spirits etc.

Ans. He may see by the Scripture, how the Apostle has made known, what man is
now by Nature in his fallen State, to wit, d^ad in Sins and Trespasses, Ephe.
2. and what a Wicked man's State is? and how man is Saved? And Moses declares,
how Man and Woman were before they fell; as may be seen Genesis 1. And Christ
himself declares, how he and the Father is known by Revelation, wherein Christ
said, I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, for thou have hid these
things from the Wise and Prudent, and have revealed them unto Babes: even so
Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. And no man knows, who the Son is,
but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and to whom the Son will
reveal him, Luke 10, 21, 22. And (mark) it seems, we must weigh R. W's words,
as Mary did Christ's, and in our Hearts and Spirits: Nay Roger, we shall not
make thy words equal with Christ's; for they are easily savored to come from
another Spirit then Christ's, as thou have manifested in thy Book.

R. W. And when thou have told us, what the Jesuits, and the Pope do, then
thou say, Satan pretends to exalt and deifie you, under the Name of God, and
Christ, and the Spirit, etc. but his end is, as Peter tells us, to exalt
himself, and fill his Hellish Paunch with Souls.

Ans. This R. W. had better have kept to himself, who pretends so much of God,
and Christ, and the Spirit, etc. for it suits his own Condition the best, and
not the Quakers. But Roger, where does Peter use any such Expressions in the
Scripture, as, Satan to fill his Hellish Paunch with Souls? this is the first
time it was Scripture. Where does Peter use any such Language? is not this to
abuse Peter's Scripture, and that blessed Spirit, from whence the Scripture
came? thou should not charge such Unsavory words upon Peter, and tell us,
that Peter tells you so? Therefore do not belie Peter, a Holy Apostle, as thou
have done us. And we charge thee to mention the Chap. and Verse, where Peter
has told thee, and you New England Priests such words, as Satan to exalt
himself, to fill his Hellish Paunch with Souls? for we do not read, that ever
Peter spoke these words; but they are of thy own forging.

R. W. Thou say, I have used some sharp Scripture Language, but not as
commonly you do, passionately and unjustly. I sometimes call you Foxians, ( as
Nicolaitans from Nicholas, and^.) because G. F. appeared the greatest Writer
and Speaker, etc. among you.

Ans. Here, have thou not given thyself the lie? is this Scripture Language, to
call the People of God Foxians? And how dare thou parallel the People of God
in scorn called Quakers, with the Nicolaitans, whose Principles and Practices
we do abhor? but this is thy Passion and Unjust Dealing. But if we should tell
thee, thou art a Scoffer, and a Mocker, and a Nick-namer, this is not
Passionate nor Unjust, when we find thee so doing. And when we have told you
Persecuting Priests of New England, who Hanged, and Banished, and Cut off Ears,
that you were in Cains Nature and Jezabels, and the Beast, and the Whore, that
drunk the blood of the Saints, and killed the Lords People, this was just, and
true enough to tell you, what you were, and whose work you are doing, to wit,
the Murderers and not Christ's; for your works show it.

R. W. And thou say, Sure it is, that he subtily run for it (to wit, G. F.)
he ordered, that my Letters to our Deputy Governor ( in which my Proposals to
G. F. were) should not be delivered to the Deputy, until G. F. was some hours
under Sail, that he might say, he never saw my Paper: though it is as clear as
Noonday, that he knew all matters by Copies, Letters and Relations perfectly,
many days before his departure.

Ans. Here is the manifestation of a wicked lying Spirit. First, that he is
sure, G. F. run for it: And next, that G. F. ordered, that his Letters should
not be given to the Deputy Governor, till G. F. was some hours under Sail: and
thirdly, that G. F. might say, he never saw his Paper: and lastly, that it is
as clear as Noonday, that G. F. knew all matters by Copies of Letters and
Relations perfectly, many days before his departure. These are four great
Lies: for G. F. knew not, what was in thy Papers Roger, neither had G. F. seen
the Copies of those Proposals; neither did G. F. hinder their being delivered
to the Governor. Nor did G. F. ever receive any Letters from R. W. or go away
for fear of him or them; nor was it a likely thing, that he should, when he
knew nothing of them: for as I said before, when I was at Providence, where
this Roger lives, he came not at me. And if he had any thing to have spoken to
me, he might easily have done it, or have written to me, and have sent the same
Copies to me, he sent to Captain Cranston; and not have made a clamor against
me, belying of me to the world behind my back, when I was gone. But this is
like the Fruits of his Spirit, but not the Spirit of Christ, and his Disciples.

R. W. And whereas thou say; G. F. knew, that I was furnished out of his own
Writings with Artillery.

Ans. This is notoriously false; for G. F. never knew, that thou had any of
his Books, as before.

R. W. And thou seem to flatter John Stubs, and John Burneyat, and rail'st
against W. Edmondson, and say, W. E. was nothing but a bundle of Ignorance
and Boysterousness; but J. S. and J. B. were Ingenuous.

Ans. Yet all these three were Constantly on thee at once, as thou say;
where was their Ingenuity then? here is thy Contradiction and Confusion.

R. W. And thou say often over, that John Stubs said in Public, That thou
did not interrupt us. And thou say: You shall never persuade Souls (not
bewitched) that the Holy Spirit of God should persuade your Women and Maidens
to appear in Public (Streets and Assemblies) stark Naked.

Ans. We do believe thee, in that dark, persecuting, bloody Spirit, that thou
and the New England Priests are bewit^hed in, you cannot believe, that you are
Naked from God and his Clothing, and Blind. And therefore has the Lord in his
power moved some of his Sons and Daughters to go Naked; yea, and they did tell
them in OLIVERS days, and the Long Parliament's, That God would strip them of
their Church-profession, and of their Power as Naked as they were. And so they
were True Prophets and Prophetesses to the Nation, as many Sober Men have
confessed since; though thou and the Old Persecuting Priests in New England
remain in your Blindness and Nakedness. But it is, as it was of old, The
Prophet is a Fool, and the Spiritual Man is Mad.

R. W. And whereas thou say, It is hard to persuade a Fox, or a Woolf, that
he is so.

Ans. Now this is thine and the New England Priests and Professors condition.
For we grant you, that you have the Sheeps-Cloathing; but you have showed the
W^lfs Nature in Worrying the Lambs, and sucking their blood* and tearing their
Fleece. And are in your filthy Dreams, that thou tellest us of: and that thou
art more acquainted with such Dreams, that thou tells us of, then thou art with
Christ Jesus; for thy words savor not of his Spirit.

R. W. And then thou say, All that I can hope for (without Gods wonderful
mercy) is, to give my Testimony in my Generation: for ( as Solon on speaks of
the Whore) Few or None of you will return.

Ans. Nay Roger, We see, where thou and the New England Priests and Professors
are, the Lord has called us from among you, your Wolfish Nature, who feed upon
the husk, like the Prodigal: and it is the Wonderful Mercy of God, who has
called us by his Grace, to hear and follow his Son. And so, it is not like for
us To turn to you: but as the Lord says to his Prophet, Turn not thou to them,
but let them turn to thee: and therefore we cannot forsake the Living Mercies,
and turn to your broken Cisterns, that cannot bold water. And as for Solomon's
speaking of the Whore, apply that at home Roger. For do not thou after all
thy Lies wipe thy mouth? and did not all your Persecuting Priests and
Professors, after they had Hanged and Cut off Ears, and Banished the Lords
Servants, wipe their mouths too? and is not this the Mark and Die of the Red
Whore? But God sees your hearts and mouths, and so does his Holy People, which
are built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, to wit, Christ
Jesus: and we know what your foundation is, and your building too, they are
Lies and Bloody.

R. W. And thou say, I have proved, and will prove (if God please) that
Spiritual Pride about Spiritual matters is the Root and Branch of your whole
Religion; and that the King Eternal, who did cast out proud Angels out of his
Palace, will hardly open his Gates to Proud and Scornful Dust and Ashes.

Ans. Roger, This is, as I said before, thy own Condition, and the New England
Priests and Professors: Oh! that your eyes were open that you might see it! And
so, what thou measurest to others, it will be measured to thee again, pressed
down and running over: and the God of the World will fail thee in thy proof,
and has failed thee, and deceived thee; as he did thy Mother Eve, and thy
Father Adam. For this is the Mouth of the Pit, that thou speak of, and
Lucifers boast in thee against the Children of the Lord, that are daily in
Jeopardy of their Lives: and some of them have lost their Lives amongst you in
New England in Obedience to the Command of Christ, their Savior. But now,
since the Indians have risen upon them, they have confessed, how greatly they
have fallen; as you may see in the Declaration 1675. but it is well, if it
prove better, then Pharaoh's Confession. But the Lord God has ope^ed his Gates
of Life and Mercy to us, that obey his voice; and Christ has opened the Book to
us, which you cannot shut; Glory to his Name forever. And though we have the
same Portion from thee, and such as thou art, as the Prophets, Christ and the
Apostles had, the will of the Lord be done; and as Christ said, If they did so
unto the green Tree, what would they do unto the dry? and we know, they hated
Christ our Lord and Master without a Cause: and so you do us. -- But R. W. may
say, He does not Persecute with his hands. But let him read p. 200. of his
Book, wherein he declares himself, That a due and moderate Restraint and
Punishment he would have inflicted upon us, yea, though pretending Conscience:
and he would not have this called Persecution. But would R. W. be so served
himself? No: but now he lives in a Peaceable Government, where he cannot
Exercise his Cruelty, and he has not the Sword in his hand, but is in a
Restless spirit, who grudgeth at the Liberty of others, and cannot be content
with his own; short of the Royal Law of God, That would do unto all, as they
would have others do unto them.

R. W. And then thou begins with a Flattering Epistle to R. Baxter and J. Owen,
Epistle to R. B.
our Old Persecutors, and tells them of G. F.'s silly and scornful Answers.

Ans. Scornfulness we deny; and thou may look at home for that, in whose
Chair thou sit. And as for Silliness, Truth was always so called by that
Spirit thou art of.

R. W. And thou say, Through your sides (to wit R. B. and J. O.) the Devil
by his Claws of this Wily Fox has tore at the heart of the Son of God; it is
no wonder then, if he tear at the heart of his Love Letters, and the true
Professors of his Name, who are Innumerable in Abraham's bosom, and the rest
travailing uprightly thither. -- As to the matters in difference betwixt your
selves and me, I willingly omitted them, etc.

Ans. Here you may see, though there is, and has been great Difference betwixt
R. W. R. B. and J. O. yet all these have written against Gods People, that are
in the Truth. And as for the Devils Claws, and Tearing at the heart of the Son
of God, and Tearing at the heart of his Love Letters, and the true Professors
of his Name, that are in Abraham's bosom, and them that are travailing up
thitherwards, I say, all these are Lies, and come from an E^vious Spirit. For
the Son of God is our Life: and all that profess him in Truth, and are his
followers, and all his Love Letters, that he, and his holy Prophets and
Apostles have given forth, we esteem them more then such as thee, that make a
Trade of them. For is it not well known, what sufferings the People of God had
in Oxford in the days of J. O. are they not upon Record? and was not Thomas
Goodayr cast into Prison through R. B's means, when he was railing against the
People of God, and T G. said but hum? But it is well, if they come to Repentance
for what they have done, for Imprisoning and Persecuting us, and the rest of
their Tribe in the day of their Power, when they had both the Sword and the
Bag. And so R.W. and the rest of the New England Priests have been One with
them in the Spirit of Envy and Malice against the People of God, like the Wily
Foxes, whose Blood lies at all your doors.

R. W. And after thou have flattered R. B. and J. O. thou bids them Remember,
he that loves his life, shall loose it. -- And of the 5 Bishops and 22
Ministers, and many other precious believers in the Lord Jesus, that were
sacrificed in the flames for his ever-blessed sake against that Monstrous Man
of Sin, and bloody Whore of Rome. These Foxians fancy is but a feather to those
high Pico's etc. the Pope and Mahomet, whom some of you may live to see flung
into the Lake, that burns with fire and brimstone.

Ans. Here you may see, what a desire and a Spirit is in this R. W? has not be
manifested the same mind, that is in Mahomet? and is in the Bloody Wh^re, and
the Man of sin, etc. that is the Destroyer? And why would thou have them To
live to see any flung into the Lake of Fire? for this is not like the mind of
the Lord, that would have All men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of
Truth: neither was it the mind of the Martyrs, that prayed for their Enemies;
nor the mind of Christ, that Commands to pray for Enemies, and Persecutors, and
love Enemies. But all may see, what a Devilish and Unchristian mind is in this
R. W. whose desires are to R. B. and J. O. That they may see Mahomet and the
Turk, and the Whore of R^me, and us (that he joins with them, etc.) flung into
the Lake of Fire, that burns with Brimstone. Now, would R. W. and the
New England Priests be served so themselves, who are found in this Nature? How
does R. W. say the Lord's Prayer, The Lord forgive us etc? and so, is not his
Eye double, and full of Darkness? Roger, give over Railing against the Quakers
(and the Pope and the Turk) in the Woods, and in a Peaceable Government; but
rather go and preach Repentance to them, and see, if thou dare say those
Words to their faces (in the Streets at Rome, or in the Streets at
Constantinople) that thou have written here behind their backs. For Christ
tasted Death for Every Man, for Turk and Pope; and what can thou tell, but
they may Repent? therefore why should thou desire them To be in Ashes, or To
be flung into the Lake, that burns with Fire and Brimstone? For it is Christ,
that will Reward every man according to his Works, that has dyed for all men,
and tasted death for all men; out of whose Command and Doctrine thou
manifestest thy Spirit to be. And take heed, that which thou speak of others
to see, that it does not come upon thy self, that the same place is not thy
portion: for it will be sure enough, except thou repent. And thou have had
enough of outward Burning and Consuming to Ashes in the Province, where thou
live, since thy Book was written. And as for the Five Bishops and Two and
Twenty Ministers, thou and you New England priests are in the same Nature, that
persecuted them.

R. W. says, That you (viz. R. B. and J. O.) more and more should study the
Prophecies and the Signs of the Times, etc. and that you ought to be Instant
and Constant at the Throne of Grace, etc.

Answ. R. Williams, etc. you are to Study to be Quiet, and keep the Royal Law,
To love your Neighbors as your selves; and Give over Slandering, and Lying and
Persecuting God's people with the Tongue and Hand, and Desiring to have them
punished for their pure Conscience to God: for Christ says, Let the Tares and
the Wheat grow together, till the Harvest (which is the End of the World,) etc.
much more let the Wheat grow. For you are not like to Study the Prophets, nor
the Signs of the Times, when you do not know, what Spirit you are of your
selves; as Christ says (in Luke) to such, as would have had fire to come down
from Heaven upon them, that would not receive Christ: Nay, you are worse, for
you would kindle fire on Earth to burn them, that would not receive you.

R. W. And in thy Narration of the Conference thou say; I have read over G.
F's Book in Folio against (as I think) above Six Score Books and Papers written
by Pious and Able Pens against them (the Quakers. page 1.2.
) And this Summer hearing of his Coming into New England, the poor Cheated
Souls, the Quakers, expecting his Coming as the Coming of an Angel of Light
from Heaven, I read over his Book afresh (as in the presence of the Eye of God)
with a single Eye, etc. and more clearly finding his Answers so weak, silly,
Antichristian and blasphemous, yet so imperious and scornful, so cursing and
damning etc. all, that bow not down to their New-upstart Image, etc.

Answ. Roger W. All that read thy words may see, it has been an Evil Eye, that
thou have read G F's Book withal; and Herod and Pilate, Pharisees and Sadducees
are agreed against the Lord's Christ and his people. For these are Pious to
thee and Able Penmen Now, that Once thou wast in Difference, but now do join
withal, merely because they have Written and Printed against, and persecuted
God's living Witness: as in the Days of Oliver there were several persecuted
and Imprisoned to death, besides what were PVT TO DEATH in New England by that
Generation, which practice was Antichristian. And thou being joined with that
Spirit, and envious against the people of God, that receiv^d G. F. Willingly in
New England, therefore with thy Evil Eye thou readst his Book, and brought
forth thy Monstrous Birth of Lies: and that which G. F. did write, which thou
call Silly or Weak, is come upon them. And as for Blasphemy, Imperious,
Scornful, Damning, etc. thou may keep these words at home, which are the
fruits of thy own spirit, as thy Book shows. -- But what this New-Vpstart
Image is, that we would have All bow down to, thou have not manifested to us:
for He, that we would have All people to come to, is CHRIST JESUS, and to
receive him; whom all that are called Christians, profess in words. For as John
says, He that has the Son, has Life, and he that has not the Son, has not
Life: he that believes in the Son of God, has the Witness in himself, etc.
AND THIS IS THE RECORD, that God has given to us Eternal Life; and this Life
is in his Son (1 John 5.) who is the Brightness of God's Glory, and the Express
Image of his Person or Substance, and upholding all things by the Word of his
Power: when he had purged by himself our Sins, sat down on the Right Hand of
the Majesty on High (Hebr. 1): and do thou call this the New-Vpstart Image,
and blasphem'st against it? And how dare thou open thy Mouth, and talk of the
Holy Spirit of God and the Lord Jesus, and call him an Vpstart Image? who is
manifest in the people of God called Quakers, and dwells in their hearts by
Faith, which he is and has been the Author of.

R. W. And thou would make people believe, what thou have done, has been
for the Honor of Christ, for thou say; My Spirit rose up within me, and I
believe, the Holy Spirit of God, etc. quickened my Spirit to the present
Undertake, etc.

Answ. If thou did believe in the Holy Spirit of God, thou would not be
Against it in God's people, nor Blaspheme it, nor Tell Lies, nor Call for Fire
from heaven.

R. W. And thou say, Therefore for his Holy Name's sake, after my Spirit was
quickened, etc. I undertook this Service; and for the Name of the most-Holy,
Only Begotten, the True Lord Jesus, the God-man and Mediator, etc. and for the
Honor of the Most-holy Spirit of God so horribly torn in pieces by this foul
Spirit of the Quakers.

Answ. How dare thou take the Holy Name of the Lord Jesus or God into thy
Mouth, and the Mediator, etc? and his Holy Spirit into this foul Mouth, and
speak so despitefully against him in his people? this is not an Honor to
Christ Jesus. And is not this Blasphemy in thee to say, That the most
Holy-Spirit of God can be torn in pieces by a foul Spirit? for where did ever
the Prophets or Apostles use any such Expressions? It Is said, They Resisted the
Holy Ghost; but where is it said, They Horribly tore the most-Holy Spirit of
God, or Jesus Christ the Mediator in pieces? We do charge R. W. to make it
good (and all the Persecuting Priests in New England) by Scripture, wherever
Christ and the Prophets or Apostles said, That the most-Holy Spirit of God etc.
could be so horribly torn in pieces by a foul Spirit? For R. W, aggravateth the
words to the hight, and as high as he can: for his Words are these; The
Most-holy Spirit of God etc. so horribly torn in pieces by this foul Spirit of
the Quakers. First, we say, he is a BLASPHEMER, till he bring a proof out of
the Scripture for it; which we know, he cannot do. Secondly, we deny his false
Charge. For we own the Lord God, and the Lord Jesus Christ and his Holy Spirit
to be our Helper, and there is none but he, that has been our Preserver to
this day; that has upheld us in all our Persecutions both with Tongue and
Hand: and this (we can say) is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our
Savior, who would have All men to be saved, and come to the Knowledge of the
Truth. R. W. is far from the Apostle's mind, who desires (in his Epistle) That
Rome and the Pope, and Mahomet and Constantinople may be turned into Ashes; and
that R. B. and J O. may live to see them cast into the Lake, that burns with
Fire and Brimstone: but we are of the same Mind with the Apostle, who says;
There is one God and one Mediator betwixt God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus,
who gave himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due Time: Which is
testified to us, the people of God called Quakers, Glory to God forever! who
can love our Enemies, and pray for our Persecutors. R. W. it is thy Foul
Spirit, that is torn in pieces; and therefore thou have brought forth this
Shattered Birth, which thou blasphemously Fatherest upon God's Spirit: and let
the people Judge, whether it was the Spirit of God in R. W. that says, That
the Spirit of God can be Torn in pieces by a foul Spirit? this is to set the
foul Spirit above the Spirit of God; and how can the Spirit of God mortify it?

R. W. And further thou say; For the Vindicating of many of the precious
Truths of the Old Christian Purity, and for the sake of so many precious Souls
lying slain and bleeding before me, I made this Offer to G. F. and his
Followers, etc.

Answ. Thou have not Manifested that Spirit to Vindicate the precious Truths of
the Old Christians Purity; but thou have Manifested the Spirit of the Chief
Priests and Pharisees against Christ and his Spirit, which is manifest in his
people. And thy Spirit has not so much care of Slain, Bleeding Souls, but is
the Spirit, that does SLAY, and makes to BLEED. And for thy Making an Offer to
G. F. when thou never spoke to him, nor writ to him, is not this a shame for
such an Old Man, (that is above Threescore Years Old) to publish such Lies to
the World! I tell thee Roger, This Lying Spirit will never Vindicate the
precious Truths of the Old Christians Purity, but is against that Spirit, that
Vindicateth them, for it is Impare. -- And thou do Confess, that G. F. was at
Providence, and spoke publicly; and thou say It was free for thee to have
heard him, and opposed him: But why did thou not, seeing thou live at
Providence, where G. F. was? but there thou kept in thy Horns.

R. W. And to Excuse the Matter, thou say; But going the last year to one of
their General Assemblies at New-port, and having begun to present some
Considerations about the True Christ and the False, and the True Spirit and the
False; and being cut off in the midst by the sudden Prayer of one, and the
Singing of another, etc.

Answ. So here thou may see, it was Thy Spirit, that was Cut by the Spirit
of God, that led them to Pray and to Sing in Order: and this thou call the
Spirit of Confusion; and thus thou judge of things thou know not, with thy
Doting Spirit. For the True Christ we know, who is our Shepherd: and the False
Spirit or Christ is easily savoured in thee, which was Cut off by the Spirit of
Prayer and the Spirit of Singing from the True Spirit of Christ.

R. W. And then thou say: I resolved to try another way, and to offer a fair
and full Dispute, etc. To this Purpose I drew up my Thoughts in 14.
Propositions: and knowing, that Newport was the Chief Town on Rode-Island, and
Providence on the Main, and that G. F. had spoke on both places, and bewitched
many with his Sorceries, I sent this Paper following to G. F. at Newport.

Answ. R. W. here are more of thy Lies, which proceed from thy Father of Lies,
which was a Liar from the beginning, and abode not in the Truth. For thou
say (page 4.) This Paper above said (to wit, of thy Lying and Scandalous
Proposals) I sent enclosed in a Letter to my Kind Friend Capt. Cranston,
Deputy Governor: and yet thou say (page 2) Thou-sent this Paper following
to G. F. at Newport ( Thy Offer of a Dispute on 14 Propositions: R. W's
Contradiction.
) now, Let all the Honest-hearted see, if thy own Pen and Spirit does not give
thy self the Lie? And as for thy slandering Tongue in saying, That G. F.
bewitched many at Providence with his Sorceries: -- Roger, as for Witchery and
Sorcery thou may keep it at home, it is thy own spirit. For G. F. did turn
many to the Lord Jesus Christ (both at Providence and Newport) and to Hear him,
with whom God is well-pleased: and they might know Christ to be their Shepherd
to Feed them, and their Bishop to Over-see them, and their Prophet (that God
has raised up like unto Moses, whom they were to hear) who would open to them
the things of his Kingdom: and to know Christ Jesus their Counselor, and
Leader and Priest made higher than the Heavens; who had offered up himself for
them, and would present them to God without Spot or Wrinkle ( Hebr. 7.) And
these 14 Propositions are from thy Vain Thoughts.

R. W. Again thou say; I drew up my Thoughts into fourteen Propositions.

Answ. And indeed, thy Fourteen Propositions are but so many Fictions from thy
Evil Thoughts, and not from the Spirit of God, nor Christ; but by the Spirit of
Christ they are favored and judged by all the True Christians, that fear God
and honor the Lord Jesus Christ in his own Light and Spirit.

R. W. Thou complainest, That One called thee Blind Sot; and that thou durst
not send thy 14. Proposals to G. F.

page 4.
Answ. So he might well enough, for R. W. never Sen^ them to G. F: and what is
this to G. F? And thou say, J. T. took a Copy of them (to wit, thy Papers)
and read them in their Meeting: Still what is that to G F, who saw them not,
nor heard of them?

R. W. And thou say; In the Juncto of the Foxians [a Scoffer and a Mocker]
at Newport it was concluded for Infallible Reasons, that his Holiness G. F.
should withdraw, seeing there was such a Knot of Apostles of Christ Jesus now
at Newport together, etc. and it was agreed, that my Letters should not be
delivered to the Deputy Governor, till G. Fox was gone.

Answ. These be all horrid Lies, the Lord God knows, as W. Edmundson and John
Burnyeat, and the Rest that where there, know, that there was no such
Agreement. Therefore thou stuffest thy Book full of Lies to feed others withal,
and abusest both the Press and the Minds of people with Lies. -- And as for thy
scoffing Words of His Holiness, I shall leave them to the Sober Christian to
judge of this scoffing Spirit.

R. W. And thou say, That one said, that G. F. was the Eternal Son of God.

Answ. But who that One is, thou do not name. As for the people of God, they
are the Sons of God (as Job. 1, 6): and Job. 38, 7, All the Sons of God shouted
for Joy. And, As many as receive Christ, he gives them power to become the
Sons of God, even to them, that believe in his Name (Romans 8* 14:) They that are
led by the Spirit, are the Sons of God ( verse. 19.) And (Phil. 2, 15) That ye
may be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God, without Rebuke, etc. and,
Behold, what manner of Love has the Father bestowed upon us, that we should be
called the Sons of God (1 John 3, 1, 2.)

R. W. Next thou tellest the Reader, What a Great Conflict thou wast in, before
thou came to the public, etc.

Answ. I do believe thee, that the Judgments of God were upon thee, which thou
wrestlest against: and thy Greatest Conflict is yet to come for thy false Birth
of Lies and Slanders, thou have brought forth in this Travail.

R. W. Thou further say: My Ancient Neigbour J. T. being bit by such
In^ectious Teeth, fell upon me, as a Man would fall upon a Toad or a Serpent,
page 5.
etc. he was but newly bitten by them (to wit, the Quakers) and for forty
years pretended no small Love to God and me. He first gave fire upon me in this
following Letter, etc.

Answ. Let all the Sober Christians read and see, what an Unsavory Spirit and
Language this Old Man R. W. has! Thou confessest, He gave fire; which fired
thy Combustible Stuff. And now this Old Man J. T. being lately turned to the
Lord Jesus Christ, his Teacher and Savior, his Way, Truth and Life, thou
Roger, Scoffingly say, He is bitten with Infectious Teeth, and fell upon
thee, as a man would fall upon a Toad or a Serpent. What a foul spirit is there
in thee, and what Ungracious Words flow from it! but we cannot expect any other
from such a Corrupt Tree.

R. W. (In his Answer to J. T's Letter) says, My Ancient Loving Friend (J. T.)
page 6, and page 9, Your Old Unworthy Friend R. W. And then J. T.'s Letter to
R. W. again; page 6
and then R. W's to J. T. again: and (page 15) R. W. calls J. T. (his Ancient
loving Friend) White Devil, and says in these Words: But it is not the Light
of Truth or Reason, or Scripture, or Experience, or the Testimony of the
Prudent, that will satisfy this White Devil of this pretended Light and Spirit
within, etc.

Answ, Now Roger (who pretends much of God, Christ and Scripture Language)
calls his Neighbor J. T. (his Loving Ancient Friend) a White Devil: but
where did ever any of the Prophets or Apostles call any of their Ancient
Friends a White Devil? but all may see, such kind of Rusty, Cankered Language*
(as this his Book is stufft up withal) which is uttered, proc^edeth from his
Ill Fountain, (as Jam. 3.) I do not believe, that J. T. only pretends to a
Light and Spirit within, or any of the people of God called Quakers; but really
have received the Light and Spirit of Christ: but thou and they, that have not
the Spirit of Christ, are none of his (as the Apostle says, Romans 8.) And what
are all thy Notions of Experience good for, when thou scoffest at the Light of
Christ and the Spirit within, and call Light Darkness, and Darkness Light,
as thy Forefathers, the Ancient Apostate-Jews did, that had lost their sense,
and became blind and hardened.

R. W. Again thou say: Can Reason imagine, that after much struggling within
my self, and the Birth of my Propositions and Resolutions I can so suddenly
strike sail and bear up, page 7.8.
and Immediately stifle and smother, and burn my Conceptions? etc.

Answ. Thou had better to have Burnt it, and stif^'d it and smothered it,
then to have brought forth such a false Birth or Brat of thy own Conceptions:
for it will be no honor to them, that be of thy Spirit, being Lies and
Ignorance are the Ground thereof.

R. W. And thou say; Knowing, The Quakers Spirit is a ready Ditch and Gulf,
that readily sucketh and draws into it Souls, etc. ( page 6).

Answ. Roger, This is thy own Condition, as thou writest to J. T. and thou
know it not; but art wilful desperate and blind.

R. W. Thou say, Thou hoped'st, that thou had Conjured down (at least for
the present) that waspish Spirit [of J. T. thy Ancient, page 9
Loving Neighbor, whom thou call a White Devil.]

Answ. But it seems, that thy spirit deceived thee. Thou must not think with
thy foul spirit (from whence comes thy Evil Language) to Conjure God's Spirit,
or to Limit it; but be sure, that God will Limit thee, when he pleads with
thee for all thy Lies and Slanders: therefore Repent. -- And well might J. T.
say to R. W. How Childish, yea how Foolish do thou show thy self in thy First
Proposition [and he might have said, In the Rest] what G. F. and all his
Friends disown; Yea, and abhor all R. W's Lies and Slanders, though he may
boast of his Experiences and Education: but he has manifested, what spirit it
is. -- And as for all R. W's Railing words to J. T. and his Comparing W. Harris
with the Quakers, J. T. and the rest of the Sober Christians in the Colony of
Rod^-Island know R. Williams and him, and can best answer him: for it is like,
in his last Letter he does belie J. T. and W. H. as he has done us.

R. W. But in his `22. page there is something to be noted: page 22.
R. W. says, I have been acquainted with Death, and have familiarly discoursed
with the Grave and Pit of Rottenness, etc.

Answ. I do believe thee, that thou art more Acquainted with this Pit of
Rottenness and Death, and the Power of Death, and have Discourst more with
them, than with God and Christ, and more acquainted with them, than with the
Quakers Principles.

R. W. And whereas thou conceivest and flatterest thy self, Waiting for a Wind
to transport thee into Abraham's Bosom.

Answ. Oh Roger! this Prince of thy Airy, Windy Doctrine of Lies (except thou
repent) will transport thee into Misery, as he has now into Folly.

R. W. And whereas thou say: I pray you to know, that I believe, there is a
Black Familiar, that haunts the Quakers; it may be, he whispers to you, that
within forty days ye shall be rid of me, except I repent: he may see into the
Crazy temper of my house, etc. Or God may suffer him by some Immediate
Revelation to employ some malicious Soul to Murder me, that this foul Liar and
Murderer may extol and predicate himself in print, etc. that he was a True
Prophet, applauding and triumphing against a Blasphemer of your Goddess, etc.

Answ. What hard, wicked and malicious thoughts (which all come from this foul
spirit) has R. W. of J. T. which he calls his Ancient, Loving Friend and
Neighbor! And now by this all the Sincere and Vpright-hearted, that fear God,
may see, whether this be a fit spirit in R. W. to take the Holy God, and his
Holy Son, and the Holy Law into his Mouth? though I believe, J. T. or any of
the people of God would lay their Necks under his feet for his Eternal good.
And as for his Black-Familiar spirit, that he believes, haunts the Quakers,
the Quakers are delivered from it by Jesus Christ their Savior, who through
Death destroyed Death, yea the Devil, the Power of death, etc. Glory to his
Name forever. But R. W. has manifested this Black-Familiar Spirit, that he is
possessed withal, as his Father Cain was, or else he would not have such wicked
Thoughts in him [ That God should suffer J. T. to set some to Murder him under
a pretense of Immediate Revelation;] and then go and print such things, and
Father them upon God: we do abhor his foul, blasphemous, lying Spirit and his
Practice, the pure God of Heaven knows, and his Son, who has taught us, He
came to save men's lives, and not to destroy them; and we are known in the
Hearts and Consciences of people, that we are not of that spirit and mind,
which R. W. maliciously rendereth us of. -- And as for his scoffing words,
God's and Goddesses (as he calls God, Christ and his Light) he may keep those
words to himself: for our Trust is in the Lord God, the Creator of all, and
our Faith is in his Son Jesus Christ, by whom all things were Created; who was
prophesied of by the Prophets, who came according to the Prophecies, and
Suffered, and Rose again, and is at the Right Hand of God. And our Glorying is
in the Lord alone (1 Cor. 1, 31.) and we have Confidence in the Lord, and the
Lord is our Helper, ( Heb. 13, 6;) and we have tasted, that the Lord is
Gracious. And we know, that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as do Evil: and
God has not called us unto Uncleanness, but unto Holiness, praised be the Lord
for ever! And we are taught of God and Christ, To love enemies, and to love one
another, as may be seen by the Apostle's words (1 These. 4.) Oh! that ever such
a foul spirit should take the Holy God and his Holy Son, and his Holy Prophets
and his Holy Apostles words into it is mouth! And thou might better have
applied this following Scripture: But to the Wicked God says, What have thou
to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou should take my Covenant into thy
mouth, seeing thou hate Instruction, etc? Thou give thy mouth to Evil, and
thy tongue frames Deceit; and thou sit and speak against thy
(Neighbor, or against thy) Brother, etc. These things have thou done, and I
kept silent; thou thoughtest, I was altogether such an one, as thy self: but I
will reprove thee, and set in order before thine Eyes. Now Consider this, ye
that forget God, lest I tear you to pieces, and there be none to deliver,
(Psalm. 50.) Thou art one of them, that Whettest thy Tongue, and Bendest thy Bow
to shoot thy Arrows of bitter words; but God will shoot at thee (as thou may
see Psalm. 64) if thou repentest not.

R. W. And thou often scoffingly and boastingly say, That G. F. shunned the
Dispute, and pluck'd-in his Horns (as page 22. and in other places:) and (page
7) thou say, Thou will not Answer, as G. F. answered H. Wright's Paper, with
a scornful and shameful Silence.

Answ. Better be Silent, than tell Lies, Roger; (but thou art found to be a
Liar in the thing, as may be seen in the End of the book:) but these are all
but Boasts from thy Conceited Mind; why did thou not print the paper, that
it might have been seen? And as for all thy Childish Boast of G. F.'s Going
away from the Dispute, and leaving his Chaplains, (as thou scoffingly call
them) thou should have sent thy papers to G. F. or have written to him, when
he was at Providence, or at New-port, or have spoken with him, that thou had
such a thing in hand; and then if he had departed before the Dispute, thou
would have had some Ground to have boasted against him, and not to forge
Lies, and print them to the world to defile their minds. And to send thy papers
to the Deputy Governor, and never send them to G. F. this was done rather,
that thou might boast, when G. F. was gone: but this is thy Mystery of
Iniquity, and that false Birth, thou wast striving to bring forth; which now
thou have published to the world to defile their minds.

R. W. And thou say (after thou have rambl'd in the 23. and 24. pages) Thou
had a Strange Assurance given into thy spirit from God in Answer to thy poor
Requests, page 23. p. 24. p. 25.
etc. that by Moderation and Patience thou should conquer the Immoderate and
Impatient, etc. [Here Roger, thou praisest thy self:] but ( page 25) thou
fall'st a Railing against W. Edmundso^, and say, That he was very Ignorant
of Scriptures or other Learning, etc. and fit to make a Braggadocia, etc. and
he would often vapor, and preach long. And when thou had patiently waited,
till the Gust was over, and beganst to speak, he would stop thy Mouth, etc.

Answ. Here again thou praisest thy self, and scoffingly condemnest W. Edm. And
is this the Scripture Language, to call him a Braggadocia? who is a Known Man
of Integrity to the Lord? and an Able Man in the Scripture? and a Minister of
Christ? whom thou falsely chargest to be Very Ignorant of the Scripture, and fit
to make a Braggadocia? who could not endure to hear thee cast thy Lies and
Slanders upon the people of God without Rebuking thee? And often thou
mentionest the Most-High, and take the Name of God in thy Mouth, and would
make people believe, that thou had an Answer from God in this Work: but we
know, what God it was, that put thee on, and brought forth this Birth in thee;
for it was the way of all the Enemies of God to use the Name of God against the
Prophets, and against Christ and his Apostles, as thou do against us. And so
the Lord and his people knows thy false Conception, that thou have brought
forth; and it will be for the Establishing of the Elect, and for the Confirming
of them that serve and fear the living God, and to the Confounding thy self.

R. W. And thou say: My End was the Vindicating of his Most-holy Name, which
my Soul saw, was trodden in the Dirt by Satan clothed with Samuel's Mantle,
etc. And, I had in mine Eye the Vindicating this Co^^^y for receiving such
persons, whom others would not; page 26.
we suffer for their sakes, and are accounted their Abettors, etc. and that
thou might give a public Testimony against their Opinions, etc.

Answ. Here all may see, what is in this Man's spirit, that he must give a
public Testimony against such, as the Colony received (to wit, the people of
God called Quakers) and how that you suffered for their sakes, and were
accounted the people of God called Quakers, their Abettors. And is it not here
clear, that thou would have them off the Island, and out of the Colony, and
not let them have their Liberty in it? and to set the Magistrates against them,
and not to be Received, as they do not Receive them in Other places? and yet
the King lets them have their Liberty as well as thee? And thus thou have
brought forth the Birth of the Flesh, that persecuteth them that are born of
the Spirit; and art short of the Royal Law, To DO UNTO ANOTHER, AS THOU
WOVLD'ST HAVE THEM DO UNTO THEE.

R. W. And thou, who would bear a Public Testimony against our Opinions,
etc. (as thou call'st it) in such a Way and Exercise, as thou Judged'st it
incumbent upon thy Spirit and Conscience to do it (in some regards) more than
most in the Colony. I may also truly say, that, etc.

Answ. Here R. W. Boasts and Sets up himself, I do believe, More than any
of the Colony with his false Conception: for why should not the people of God
called Quakers have as much Liberty in the Colony, as Roger Williams, seeing
both God, and the King and the people own them in the Government, and allow of
them? And why cannot this Man be quiet with his own Liberty in his own Opinions
and Imaginations, but he must grudge at others? but the Governors have not
grudged at him for his; but he may preach as long as he will, if people will go
to hear him: but I think, he is an Old Doting Man, and few mind him; for I did
not hear, that he preached to any, when I was at Providence. And he may think,
by publishing this Book of Lies to get some Followers: It Is like, he may get
such, as are given up to believe Lies, but none, that fear God and follow
Christ Jesus. And for thy saying; Thou vindicatest his Most-holy Name, which
thou saw, was trodden under foot in the dirt by Satan, etc. And if it be the
Name of the Most-High God thou meanest, or the Name of Christ Jesus ( in whose
Name his people has Salvation, and not by any other Name under Heaven. as Act:
4, 12.6.17, 18,) this Name neither thou, nor Satan can never Tread into the
Dirt; though thou art forbidden To take the Lord's Name in vain, (as Pro. 30,
9: Exo: 20, 7.) And how do thou prove by Scripture, That the Name of the
Most-high can be trodden in the Dirt? thou say, thy Soul Saw it; give not
thy Soul the Lie.

And thou say, It was thy End, to Vindicate his Most-holy Name: Nay, Roger,
never with Belying and Slandering of his people; but in this thou take the
Name of the Lord in vain. For Isaiah says; Behold, the Name of the Lord comes
from far burning with his Anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his Lips are
full of Indignation, and his Tongue as a Devouring Fire, ( Isa: 30, 27:) and
therefore do not thou Blaspheme the Name of the Lord (Levit 24, 11.) And (
Prove: 18, 10.) The Name of the Lord is a Strong Tower, the Righteous runs
into it, and is safe: and thou say? The Name of the Most-high thou saw
trodden in the Dirt by Satan; Now, Can Satan tread this Strong Tower into the
Dirt? and we know, the False Prophets (like thee) often mentioned the Name of
the Lord (in the days of Jeremiah and other Prophets) with a Lying spirit, (as
thou may read Jerem. 23, and see thy Condition, and how they used their
Tongues.) And Micha says ( Chap. 5, 4) He shall stand and feed in the strength
of the Lord, in the Majesty of the Name of his God, etc. so here is a Majesty
in the Name of the Lord, which is far above Thee and thy Dirt and Satan, and
Blind Eyes. And David says, They that know thy Name, will put their Trust in
thee; for thou art Lord ( Psalm. 9, 10:) and, O Lord, how Excellent is thy Name
in all the Earth! ( Psalm. 8.) And David says, Thy Name* O Lord, endures for
ever, and thy Memorial, O Lord, throughout all Generations* ( Psalm. 135, 13:)
can this be Trodden under foot according to R. W's false Doctrine? I am a Great
King, says the Lord of Hosts, and my Name is Dreadful among the Heathen, Mal:
1, 14: and Isa: 63, 16, Thy Name is from Everlasting: and, Thy Name i^ as
Ointment poured forth, Cant. 6, 26. And in the Name of Christ the Apostles Cast
out Devils, and healed the Sick, etc. and if R. W. means Christ's Name
Trodden in the Dirt by Satan, His Name is called the Word of God; and the Word
of God, (that lives and endures for ever) cannot be Trodden under foot
neither by him, nor his God- Satan (Revel: 17, 13).

R. W. Thou say; I had many Thoughts of beginning such an Exercise with
prayer unto God for his Presence, etc. and thou say a little before in the
same page, (when thou have made a speech of Nicholas Davis being drowned, etc.)
Some of these Blessed Ends it has pleased God to propagate by this Occasion
all this Colony over; and all of us round about have put forth our selves in
Disquisitions and Searchings after the true Grounds of Christian Religion and
Worship.

Answ. If this was the Cause of your Searching after the true Grounds of
Christian Religion and Worship, what have thou been doing all this while Roger?
how could thou go to Dispute of such things, and had them to Search for?
which we do believe thee, thou had them Then, and have them Yet to seek* and
can not find them with this Dark, Envious Spirit, and thy Thoughts, which
thou Thought to Begin with Exercise of Prayer; etc. but thou knew'st, very
well, that the people of God called Quakers, could not receive thy Prayers from
thy Many Thoughts; they were not like from a Lying, Slandering Spirit.

R. W. Thou say, Thou have Cause* to Judge, that the Word QVAKER was given
to us from that strange Possessing of our Bodies of Quaking and Shaking. page
27.


Answ. Gervase Bennet, Justice of Darby gave us that Name, because I and we bid
him and his Company, Tremble at the Word of God, (in 1650, when he cast G. F.
and others in prison.)

R. W. Further he says, It is true, that they are (to wit the Quakers,) the
Offspring of the Grindletonians in Lancashire.

Answ. This is also false; the Grindletonians and the people in Lancashire know
it.

page 28.
R. W. And R. W. says, The Ranters are but the Quakers Daughter. And page 29.
thou say, That some Parliament Men told thee, that they themselves went to
one of the Quakers Meetings about Charing Cross; but they were so frighted with
the Shaking of their Bodies, of the Chairs and Stools, etc. and call it,
Satan's Counterfeit Motions.

Answ. These are Two Horrid Lies: for all the Ranters and people up and down
England know, this Charge of thine is false; and is like the rest of the Lies
of thy Book. For many of the Ranters are come to be Sober in the Fear of God,
and are turned to the people called Quakers; but not the Ranters come from the
Quakers, neither Are they their Daughter: this has been the spirit of the
Devil, that moved thee, and not the Most-High. And thy Book, that is so s^uft
up with Lies, it will do little hurt, where we are known here in England. --
(The 2d. Lie:) And the Quakers never had any Meeting about Charing Cross: this
is another Forgery, that thou have published; the people, that lives about
Charing Cross, will testify against thee.

R. W. And thou bring John Toldervy and Theora John, and thou say, The
horrible Shaking of the Quakers, -- We are tossed and tumbled up and down, etc.
(page 29.)

Answ. As for Th. John, all people that knew him, know, he was no Quaker: and
John Toldervy the priest did give forth a Book in his Name, wherein they much
abused him, as thou do now; but J. Told. has cleared himself in his own
Book, which is an Answer to the Priest, that abused him, called, The Foot out
of the Snare. And does R. W. think, to feed the Sober Christians in England
with such Lying Stories, as these? Nay, they may serve his New England
persecuting Priests. -- And R. W. Thou often mentionest the Father of Spirits,
and the Most-high, who stirred thee up to this Work: but thy foul Mouth is not
worthy to mention the Name of the Lord.

R. W. The People called Quakers are not True Quakers according to Scripture.

Answ. The Lord God of Heaven and Earth knows, that thou speak falsely of
us here. And thou have made a great Noise, but provest nothing; but have
brought several Lies to prove thy own (as thou may see page 27.29). -- For
the same Word of God and Power, by which all things were made, have we known
the Operation in our hearts of it, and Tremble at it; which thou have not
konwn: for if thou had, thou would not have brought this false Charge out
against us.

R. W. Thou say, The Tumultuous Spirit of the Quakers (...) Disputing; --
and the Reason is, That Three of the Speakers consulted openly, and whispered
and uttered themselves, one immediately speaking after the other, and sometimes
all together, as one man against me, (page 26.).

Answ. The Auditory knows, whether thou speak Truth in this: and what!
must not Whisper one to another before R. W?

R. W. Thou say, Thou wast first commanded this Work from Heaven, (page 25.)

Answ. We desire all, that read thy Book, to mind thy Many False Charges, and
thy Unsavory Expressions; and then they may Judge, whether Thy Command came
from Heaven or from Hell: for No Lie is of the Truth, nor comes not from the
God of Truth; but from the Father of Lies. -- The First Part of thy Work thou
undertook was, To prove us No True Quakers according to the holy Scriptures:
Which thou did not then in the Dispute, (as I am satisfied, the Generality
of the Hearers can bear Witness,) neither have thou yet done it in all thy
Writing by the Scripture, nor yet by any Sound Argument; but go on to Charge
and Accuse us, as if One of thy Accusation must prove Another, (unless this way
can prove it:) so No Proof.

R. W. And with this thou beginnest in page 28. and say, Thou wast the more
confirmed, when thou saw our foul spirit to transport us not only in Lying
Doctrines, but also in Lying Quakings and Tremblings, and Lying Preachings
through the Streets, Repent, Repent, etc.

Answ. Now let all Observe, what he calls Our Lying Preachings? as if to
preach Repentance by the Command and Power of God now were a Lying Preaching;
which is one of the things, that Christ sent His forth to preach: and let the
Wise consider, whether our Days and Generations do not need this Preaching, Yea
of Nay? -- And this is still a false Charge, to say, He saw our soul spirit to
transport us into Lying Doctrines; But has not yet made out these Doctrines:
and again, With Lying Quakings and Tremblings; but has not proved it: so, it is
but still his False Charge. -- And further, as thou did then in the Dispute,
so now, thou make a great a do with our Men and Women going Naked: We told
thee then, we owned no such Practice in any, unless they were called unto it by
the Lord, as a Sign of the Nakedness of the Professors of Our Age, who want the
Covering of the Spirit. And though thou would exclude Signs, Christ being
come; was not Agabus a Sign to Paul, when he took his Girdle, and bound himself
with it?

R. W. And thou further Chargest us, That Rantism is our Ugly Child and
Daughter, and rose from our Bowels: and with the Practice of the Ranters in the
Streets, and in their Religious Meetings.

Answ. Now let all consider, whether this be a proper Way, to prove us No true
Quakers, to charge that upon us to be Our Child, and to proceed from us, which
was, before any bore the Name of Quakers in England? as many people know: and
therefore not like to proceed from us.

R. W. Thou grantest, That David, Moses, Daniel, Habakkuk and Paul Trembled;
and the Corinthians received Titus with Trembling; and, Working out Salvation
with Fear and Trembling: and so grantest Trembling upon the Bodies of God's
people (as thou say) in some Extra-ordinary Occasion ( especially, in
bringing Great or Old Sinners unto God, page 30.) but R. W. thou say, The
Quaking and Shaking Motions of the Quakers thou will prove, proceeded not from
these holy Affections proper to God's Children.

Answ. In the First place we would have all observe this, whether the People of
God called Quakers, had not this Occasion (which he speaks of) when God did
visit them, being found Sinners, and some Great and Old Sinners? therefore the
Occasion he grants Trembling and Quaking proper upon, the people called
Quakers might well meet with in their Conversion and Turning to God: as also
afterward in their Going forth to preach the Gospel; as it was with Paul, when
he came among the Corinthians, who was among them in Weakness and Fear, and
much Trembling, (1 Cor. 2, 3.)

(R. W.) In the Next place, let all, who read his Book, observe, how he proves
his Charge: He says; They proceeded not from those holy Affections proper to
God's Children (but why? page 29.
) They were Horrid and Monstrous Motions and Gestures.

Answ. What would he have said of David's Roaring, and Crying and Trembling?
and Habakkuk's Shaking? and of the Holy Men, who rent their Cloths? and many
such things. Here we have his own Judgment; but how does he prove it? he
says, By Abundance of Notorious Instances: and so brings the Motions,
Shakings, Ecstasies, the Workings of Satan upon his Servants as Baal's Priests
and the people Possessed mentioned in Scripture and other Histories, and the
Barbarians) to prove it. Now let all consider, what Proof this is, to prove us
to be No True Quakers? what have we to do, with what the Devil does upon his
Servants, unless he can prove us to be of them? What is that to us, what Baal's
priests did? or what the Barbarians do? must we answer for their Wickedness? or
does this make us Guilty? the same he may allege against the Holy Men of God.

(R. W.) He further tells us, The Devil will be God's Ape, page 30.
and suborneth and instituteth a Bastard-Quaking and Trembling in the Body in
Imitation of David and Moses, etc.

Answ. Here he still grants, There is a True Trembling: but this does not
prove ours False; though the Devil may beget a false Imitation, and be an Ape,
as he says.

(R. W.) Another Argument he brings, to prove us No True Christian-Quakers,
page 31
Because we did not Tremble at the Word of God in the Holy Writings or
Scripture: and blames G. F. for Not Calling them the Word of God, but for
Accounting Christ the Word, according to Revel. 20. But he confesses, that G.
F. grants, the Scripture is True, and Inspired from the holy Spirit of God,
and to be God's Words.

(Answ.) Observe, He speaks of Trembling at the Word in the Writings or
Scriptures: what Scripture has he for this? We know, that the Scripture says,
The Word is nigh, in the Heart and Mouth, that Word, which the Apostle preached
( Romans 10, 8;) but we do not read of the Word of God in the Writings.

(R. W.) Page 32.33. he goes on still Accusing us and the Papists, p. 32.33.
and puts us together for Slighting the Scriptures. And tells us of a
Papist in Ireland in the time of the Massacree, who found a Bible; and with
Indignation ( the same, he says, he believes, is in most Papists and Quakers)
^ung it into the Kennel, stamped upon (...) and said; A plague of God take this
Book! this has caused all the Quarrels amongst us.

(Answ.) Now Observe, how he goes on to prove his Charge against us, by
Charging us (from his own Groundless Belief) with This Indignation, that he
says, was in this Irish Papist against the Bible: and so goes about the
condemn us for the Actions of others, that we never knew. And yet (in the same
page and in many other places) he confesses, That we owned the Scripture, and
says: The Sum of all was (in the Dispute,) that we Owned the Scripture; but
yet the Spirit, that gave it forth, was above it. Let wise men, that know us,
Judge, whether this way of His Dealing with us to prove his Charge, be
Christian-like or no, for him To Charge upon us the Actions of others, not of
us? -- And whereas he Endeavors, to prove the Scriptures to be the Word of
God (though he grants, they are not in so many Terms and Words mentioned:)
That we forbear to speak to now; being fully Answered in the Answer to his
Appendix, where the Single-hearted Reader may be satisfied.

(R. W). He gives an Account, how he came to give his Book such a Title; page
34
which came from a Guess of his own, and a Conceit and Thought, that Sprung
from this Guess, as he says. And then, when he has done, takes Boldness, to
Father it upon the Finger of God, and his Overruling Hand: and then in that
Conceit to Judge G. F. and Ed. Borough to Conspire against Christ with dark,
subtle, Hellish Conjurings and Imaginations.

(Answ.) Still let all observe, upon what Ground we are Charged and Judged? and
so he goes on in his Boasting.

(R. W.) He quoteth G. F. Answering J. Stallum, ( G. F.'s fol. 155.) who said [
To say, p. 35.
The Light in every Man gave forth Scripture, and will open Scripture to us, is
palpable Darkness, and contradicts Scripture.] G. F. Ans. [All be in Utter
Darkness, and know not the Scripture, until they come to the Light, that Every
man was in, that gave forth the Scriptures: for the Light lets them see, to
what it was spoken; and Christ the End of them.] R. W. Answers and says: The
English of the Answer is, that Every man, that is, All Mankind, Men and Women
if they will, can give forth Scripture, or write Holy Scripture.

(Answ.) Now let all that are Wise, judge, whether this be not a Gross
Perversion of G. F's words, to say, That all Men and Women can give forth or
write holy Scriptures, if they will: but G. F. does not say, The Scripture was
given forth by the Will of Man. And so all may see, how he still goes on
Perverting and Accusing falsely, as if G. F. had said, Holy Scripture had or
might be given forth by the Will of Man; which he says, is not known, till Man
come to the Light. -- And as to his Unlearned Question, whether the Light
comes into Mankind at the Conception, or at the Birth, or when else? we leave
him to what is written, Joh. 1, 9. Christ is the True Light, that lights
every Man, that comes into the World. So, it is Evident, ALL ARE LIGHTED, that
come into the World: and the Believers witnessed it to Shine in their Hearts.
And Abraham saw his Light or Day; and in it David saw more Light, which was
before Christ came in the Flesh. John says, In the Word, which was in the
Beginning, was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men. This in Answer, to what
follows in the same page.

(R. W.) He again Compares us with the Papists, Common Protestants, p. 38.39.
Jews, Mahometans and Pagans; and begins again to upbraid us with our Men
and Women's going Naked, as if it were a thing Ordinarily or Commonly allowed
amongst us in their Wills, without the Motion of God: and would bring this as
his Main Proof, to prove us No True Quakers.

(Answ.) I have already answered to this: and in his own Book it may be seen,
how that we own no such Practice, unless the Lord upon an Occasion should call
for it as a Sign, (as before said) as may be read in our Answers to him, quoted
by himself ( page 39.) But this Way is, to Charge and Accuse us with all his
Might; as if that were the Way to prove his Charge against us. -- And he
tells of Our being on High in our Desk ( page 37) when (as the people there
at Rode-Island, that was at the Dispute, know, that) it was but upon a Common
Seat, as was at the other End, where he sat, and on both Sides.

(R. W.) He also charge us with Exalting Cursed Nature.

(Answ.) Now, I desire the Serious Reader to weigh well, when thou read his
Book, whether by all, that he has said, he has Proved his Charge? or whether
in stead of Proving this One, he has not Charged many more, and left both it
and them Vnproved? and so gone off, as a false Accuser. And as for Exalting
Cursed Nature, R. W. with the New England Priests had better to have kept it at
home.

Now further observe: that in the Conclusion of the First Day we having a
Discourse upon the Commands of God upon the aforesaid. Occasion, as, Of
Abraham's Offering his Son, R. W. said; They could Discern and See in those
Days, That Abraham's Command To kill his Child, page 40
was the Command of God: which we cannot now in these Days do. We asked, what
they Discerned by? was it not the Spirit of Revelation, that they Tried and
Discerned by? He confessed, It was: but said, We have it not so Now, nor is it to
be Expected. Then we desired, seeing the same Spirit was not to be Expected,
with what did he Try our Spirits? and how did he know, Ours not to be the same,
as theirs was, seeing, he had so Charged and Condemned us? he said again; They
had that Way of Discerning of Spirits, which none has now. But as he says in
his Book, We must attend to the Scripture Only; and to use the Weapon, It Is
Written, It Is Written, against Satan's Immediate Inspirations and Temptations;
p. 41.
and this he calls Christ's Weapons, by which he resisted the Devil: and so
bids us, Follow his Example, and to use the Weapon of It Is Written, It Is
Written. If this be All, or the Only Weapon, It Is Written, the Devil, when he
comes to tempt, may Use the same: for he did use it to Christ, as Matthew. 4, 6.
he said, It Is Written, he has given his Angels Charge over thee, etc. So all
may see, R. W. is not for the Apostle's Weapons, his Helmet, his Shield, his
Breast Plate, his Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, which he said,
was N^gh in the Heart etc.

A Question was put to him; Whether the Anointing, which the Apostle John
directed the Saints unto, to Try the Spirits by, was not the same, that Abraham
understood and knew the Mind of God by? But this Question he never would
answer, although he promised, that he would Answer it the Next Day; yet though
it was often urged, he still evaded, and would not answer: for if he had, and
confessed) then he knew it must follow, That the Saint's being directed to the
same, that was Abraham's Guide, Discoverer, and that by which he tried the True
from the False, it could not be the Scripture, but that which was, before the
Scripture was written, And yet, though he could not deny it, not would not
grant it, the thing is True, Abraham saw his Day, whom the Apostle says, the
Saints were in; and they that had him (to wit, the Son of God) had Life. And
thou and the New England Priests, that have not the same Discerning as Abraham
had, are out of the Faith of Abraham, and so no Children of Abraham, but of
that Father, that Christ told the Jews they were of.

The Second Day of the Dispute the Question aforesaid was put again to him,
and he was desired to answer, according as he promised the Evening before, but
would not, and so evaded: and made a great Narration, and began to tell us of
Certain Bow-men, that bent their Tongues, p. 42.
like Bows. So the Discourse upon this aforesaid Matter he has let fall in
his Relation, as he has done a great part of the Dispute; and instead thereof
has put in his own Guessings, Conceits, Imaginations and Inventions divised in
Secret, when there was none to oppose him: and brought forth at last as a
Monster to reproach, belie and slander the Innocent. As all may see, that read
his Book, how Invective and Bitter he is: and whether he is not one of that
Generation, which Jeremiah speaks of, That bend their Tongues, like Bows for
Lies, I leave the Sober Reader to Judge, that does read his Book. And so, take
some few Observations of his Manner and Way of Proving his Second Position,
viz. That the CHRIST we profess, p. 43.
is not the TRUE LORD Jesus CHRIST.

R. W. He tells us, We were not Christians, nor Professors of the Christian
Religion: p. 44.
We might with Jews, Turks and Papists profess One God; yet Christians we could
not be. And to prove it he says, That the Description and Character, which the
Holy Scriptures give to the True Lord Jesus, no way agrees with the Image,
which we have set up.

Answ. Which Image and Idol (as he calls it) is Christ the Light, his
Spiritual Appearance in Man: so that we find, he labors to set up Christ in
his Appearing in that Body, which was prepared for him, (wherein he suffered
without the Gates at Jerusalem) in Opposition to Christ Spiritually dwelling in
his people. As if it could not be Consistant with his then Appearing in that
Body, and taking that Flesh upon him, and becoming a Sacrifice therein for Sin,
that he should afterward Appear in his people, and be in them the Hope of
Glory: and be their Life; and they to become his House or Temple, and he to
dwell in them: and to be their Head, and they to be his Body, and Members in
particular, and of his Flesh, and of his Bone: and they to Eat his Flesh, and
Drink his Blood, which he said, All must do, or they had No Life in them: and
he to be formed in them, and he to Sup with them, and they with him: which is
all according to the Scripture, (as you may read Rev. 3, 20. Gal. 4, 19. Ephesians.
5, 30. Read John 6. Romans 12, 5. Col. 1, 18.24, 27. Ephesians. 1, 22, 23. 1 John 5,
12. 1 Cor. 12, 27. Col. 3, 3, 4. 1 Cor. 6, 19. Hebr. 3, 6.) -- Now who reads
these Scriptures, may see, that the Apostles and Primitive Christians did
witness Christ within, and the Light within, even that Light, which gave the
Knowledge of the Glory of God (as may be read 2 Cor. 4, 6.) And now this
Appearance of Christ R. W. fights against (Reprobate-like) as if those, that
own him Now in this his Spiritual Appearing, and are Witnesses thereof, must
needs own him in Opposition to his Appearing in that Body, wherein he suffered.
And so does Labor, to make us Deniers of Christ, that suffered at Jerusalem,
and was born at Bethlehem; though he often confesses, We own him in our words:
and our True Christianity has manifested it self against that Antichristian
Spirit, that you are in in New England. -- But he ( R. W.) though he says, He
has not the same Spirit, that Abraham had, and the Holy men of God, by which
things were revealed to them, yet he has taken upon him to Judge our Hearts
and Intents contrary to our Words; and there-upon does condemn us through his
Book: and this way he goes To prove his Charges, and has Confidence to say,
He has produced such Grounds, as shall never be shaken, (as page 41.)

( R. W.) Now, let all observe, how R. W. appears against Christ's Appearance
according to the Experience of the people of God in the Scripture, viz. Christ
within [which he calls, Our Christ] he says, is but half a Christ, a Light,
an Image, a Picture or a Fancy of a Christ, p. 45
made up to the Godhead and their Flesh: Christ within, an Imagination, an
Image, a Christ in the Mystical Notion, but in reality Nothing.

(Answ.) He may as well say, The Christ the Apostle witnessed, was Made up of
the Godhead and their Flesh, for they are the Apostle's Words, he thus
quarreleth against ( Ephesians. 5, 30:) for we are Members of his Body, of his
Flesh and of his Bones.

( R. W.) In the same page he Confesses, That we say, Christ was Born at
Bethlehem, and died at Jerusalem: but he says; We intend in Truth and Reality
no other Birth, nor Life, nor Death, etc. but what may be extant and wrought in
the Heart of man.

( Answ.) Behold, how this man Judges of our Intents contrary to our Words,
and we say, contrary to our Intents! for we never intended so. But we always
believed, that he was SO born, and did SO suffer, as the Scripture does
declare; and by his Life or Spirit within us we are confirmed in this Belief:
and so it is not in Opposition to his Appearance at that Day in that Body. So
we are not in a Bog and Swamp (as he says) between Christ within and Christ
without; our Understanding is clear, it is his own State.

(R. W.) He also charge us To preach the Lord Jesus to be Our selves, p. 46.
and says, Though we speak of Christ without, that died at Jerusalem, agreeing
with Christ within. Our Meaning is Mystical: and he says also, Ask them,
What Is become of the Person, that Suffered at Jerusalem? and we are forced to
say, He is within: and says, We answered so at Newport in Rode-Island.

(Answ.) That we deny, that we ever said, That Person, that Suffered at
Jerusalem, was within us: and appeal to the Sober people, that was there,
whether he has not wronged us in this Charge. -- And That we preach the Lord
Jesus to be Our selves, We deny; and lay it upon him, as a false Charge: let
him prove it, if he can.

(R. W.) He querieth, Do we not hold the Light within Every man to Be all, to
Suffer all within, that Christ without is, or did or suffered without.

Answ. I say, No: it comes FROM HIM, and witnesses TO HIM.

R. W. And ( page 43) thy Second Position is, That their Christ was not the True
Lord Jesus Christ. To which we

Answer: This thou have not proved, though thou have Uttered many False Words
against us: but this Position will be Thy own Condition, and the N. Engl.
Priests. For does the True Lord Jesus Christ give thee Command to Desire
Magistrates to Punish the people of God? and does the True Lord Jesus Christ
lead you New-England-Priests to CVT OFF their EARS, WHIP, HANG, SPOIL Goods and
BANISH of his people? O No: for Thou and You, that do Evil, hate his Light, and
will not come unto it, because it Reproves you. And so you love the Darkness,
and do the Works of Darkness, and the Works of the Prince of the Air, that
rules in you; and not the Works of Christ. -- And again, how can you own the
True Lord Jesus, and own not him the Light of the World, which Lights every
man, that comes into the World? and can thou and you believe in the True
Lord Jesus, who says, Believe in the Light, that you may become Children of
the Light, and thou call that Light (...) Frantic Light, and an Idol? And
therefore thy Position is come upon thy self, Not to own the True Lord Jesus (
in his Light, which gives the knowledge of him) who died without the Gates of
Jerusalem: and like the Jews in Words professed God, so do thou Christ, and
deniest the Light, that gives the knowledge of him. (2 Cor. 4.)

R. W. Thou say ( page 35.) I had observed and prepared many Quotations out
of G. F. 's Book, but they desired not to bear them read, as in the following
Day's Conference they were read by my Continual Importunate Urgings. -- And (
page 47.) thou say, That they were willing, I should Produce out of G. F.'s
Book, etc. And ( page 48.) Thou say, The Truth is, they were Gravelled with
those Considerations; and they were Willing, that G. F.'s Book and his Answers
should answer for them. And when I began to open and compare the Assertions of
the Opposite, and G. F.'s his Answer, they would cry out, like a Galled Horse
winching; Why do thou make Observations upon G. F.'s Words? G. F.'s Words
need not thy Expositions: Let G. F.'s Words alone, they are able to speak for
themselves.

Answ. R. W. How dare thou affirm, That we desired not the Quotations read of
G. F.'s Book, when all the people knows, that we Called for them so often?
And ( page 35.) thou make it Thy Importunate Vrgings the Occasion of the
Reading of them; but ( page 48) thou make Our Being Gravelled the Occasion of
our Desiring to have them read of our selves: which is altogether false (and to
say, That we were Gravelled or Unwilling to have them read.) But our Calling
for them was to Clear that, which thou said, was in them, which was not: and
therein thou have Gravelled thy self, which spoke that, which G.F. had not
spoken; with Charging G. F. to say that in his Book, which was Evident to all
the people there, was not in it, when we came to read it. And how dare thou
say, Thou compared'st the Assertions of G. F.'s Opposites, and G. F.'s Answer,
when thou wast making Observations and Expositions upon G. F.'s words, and
giving Meanings of them, because they did not serve thy Design? but what
Observations and Expositions did he ever make of G. F.'s Opposites Words? And
when thou wast reproved and told, That G. F.'s Words were Able to speak for
themselves; thou scoffingly said, That we were like a Galled Horse winching,
etc. but this is thy own Condition R. W. So the Reader may see thy Folly and
Contradiction; in one page laying it upon Thy Continual Importunate Urging, and
in another page upon Our being Gravelled, and Willing to have it answer for us.

R. W. Thou say, G. F. picketh out some particular Lines, Sayings and
Sentences, and out of the Book of his Opposites to his utmost Advantage, p. 47
etc. and for Instance bring Samuel Eaton (from G. F.'s fol. page 3.) saying
[ The Saints have not Christ in the Flesh.] And G. F.'s his Answer, [Contrary
to Christ's and the Apostle's Doctrine, who said, They were of his Flesh, and
of his Bone; and they should eat his Flesh: and they that eat his Flesh, have
it in them.] From whence R. W. Affirms, That Christ Jesus had such a Body, as
might be Really and Materially in the Saints: and that it is Clear, that We are
one with the Papists, etc.

Answ. R. W. Is not this thy own Condition, of which thou accusest G. F. in
Picking out here and there out of his Book, what thou thought, would make
for thy Purpose and Advantage? but did it not Make against thee in the Dispute
to the Sight of the people, that was not prejudiced? and cannot the Saints feed
of Christ's Flesh and Blood, and be of his Flesh and Bone, except they have the
Whole Body of Christ Really and Materially in them? and for thy Affirming, That
Christ had such a Body, as might Really and Materially be in the Saints, we
deny: G. F. speaks no such words; it is thy own. And the Quakers Feed upon
Christ Jesus Spiritually; for Christ says, His Words, that he spoke, were
Spirit and Life: but we know, the Papists feed upon Bread and Wine, which is
not the Flesh and Blood of Christ; and so that is thy Envy, that leads thee to
Join us with the Papists.

R. W. And To feed upon Christ Spiritually, or Eat Christ Spiritually, (thou
say) wholly destroys his Material and Fleshly Being.

Answ. R. W. This is thy Ignorance of Christ, who is at the Right Hand of God,
and cannot be Destroyed, and dies no more. And if To feed upon Christ
Spiritually, is Wholly to destroy his Material and Fleshly Being; then Thy
Feeding upon Christ Fleshly, does it not Destroy his Material and Fleshly
Being? What must we Observe from this? Thy Feeding upon Christ Fleshly, and not
Spiritually, does not destroy his Material and Fleshly Being: and is that a
Feeding upon Christ by Faith?

R. W. And R. W. Thou bring (from G. F.'s fol. p. 4.) Sam. Eaton his
Sayings; [ The Saints do not see Christ, the Heavens contain him.] And G. F.
Answ. [The Apostle says, They Sat with Christ in Heavenly Places: So he is
Contrary to the Apostle. And Christ was in them, and walked in them, and God
dwelt in them: and Christ in you, except you be Reprobates.] R. W. Replieth: I
said, That as the Papists were up Ridiculously and Odiously with Hoc est Corpus
Meum, This is my Body; so they with the Light within you, that Lights every
man, Christ within you, except you be Reprobates. And therefore to Allege
Christ within, and their Sitting in Christ in heavenly places, is but
Irrational Nonsense and Jesuitical Equivocations. p. 48.
And, The truth is, they were Gravelled with these Considerations. --

Answ. Let the Reader Judge, whether R. W. does not call Christ's and the
Apostle's Doctrine Irrational Nonsense and Jesuitical Equivocations, and the
Papists Hoc est Corpus Meum, up Ridiculously, and terms it Ridiculous and
Odious with the Papists. For is not this the Apostle's Doctrine, Christ within
you? did not the Apostles preach Christ within people, or the Light within
people, to give them the Knowledge? as may be seen Col. 2. and 2 Cor. 4. and
Ephesians. 2. how the Saints Sat in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus? And we do
grant, That the Heavens do contain the Man Christ: and thou do confess, That
we do believe, that he Died, Rose and Ascended; and then (thou say) in that
Sense and Respect the Saints cannot now Sit Bodily with Christ in Heavenly
Places. O Deceit! Is there any such word in G. F.'s Answer? If they F^ed
Spiritually, must they not Sit Spiritually? it is thou, that art Gravelled, and
in the Swamps and Bogs thou tell us of.

R. W. Thou bringst John Bunion (from G. F.'s fol. p. 8.) saying, p. 49.
[ The Lord Jesus Christ is a far in his Bodily Presence.] G. F. Answ. [And yet
he says, The Lord is at hand. And the Apostle said, He was in them; and Christ
said, He would dwell in them.] R. W. Thou say; G. F.'s Book was brought
forth, the same with mine: and J. B. took it, and went along with me in the
Quotations: and ^ read, and always Endeavored to make my Proof out of the
Allegations. But W. Emmondson kept strict watch, and stood Sentinel, that no
Observations of Senses or Meanings should pass: and he was resolved, to keep
out the Fire and Light of Christ Jesus. And so thou fall'st a railing and
flattering thy self.

Answ. R. W. Why do thou find fault with W. Edm. who Kept a strict Watch over
thee, that thou should not Pervert, and Wrest and give Meanings to G. F.'s
Words, which they did not intend, and otherwise, then they spoke themselves? as
thou confessest, he said, Let G. F.'s words alone, they are sufficient to speak
for themselves.

R. W. For thou bringst (Fol. p. 9.) John Bunyon Affirming, [ That the Son of
Mary, God man, is absent from his Church.] G. F. Answ. [Contrary to Christ's
Words, I in them, and they in me, and I will be with you to the End: so that
thou are one of the Blind Prophets: and contrary to John, who says, We are in
him (to wit, in the Son of God) that is True. And thou say, He (to wit,
Christ) is Absent from his Church: the Apostle said, He was the Head of his
Church, and dwelt in the Saints by Faith; but of Your Church we believe, He is
not the Head, but will Grind you to Powder. [And Mark, what is become of you
now, when you were up in Oliver's Days? are not G. F.'s words fulfilled? etc.]
And thy words and thy Doctrine are corrected by Christ and the Scriptures. And
Christ says, Where Two or Three are gathered in my Name, I will be in the
midst of them: and the Saints are Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone ( to
wit, as the Apostle says.] R. W. Replieth: p. 50.
Here half an Eye may see, how he gives no other Presence or Absence of
Christ, but Invisible and Spiritual: and subtily affirms, that Christ Jesus
has no Bodily Presence at all, etc.

Answ. Let the Sober Reader Judge and see in G. F.'s Answer, how R. W. abuses
G. F.'s Words in his saying, G. F. Subtily affirms, That Christ has no
Bodily Presence at all; because he witnesses his Spiritual Presence.

R. W. He Brings J. Bunyon (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 10.) saying: That [ Christ
was not in his Disciples, when he said, I am the Light of the World.] G. F.
Answers, [And so corrected by Christ, I in you, and you in me.] -- And
further he brings (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 12.) J. B's words [ The Body of
Christ is out of the Sight of all his Saints.] G. F. Answ. [ And the Apostle
says, They sat in Christ in Heavenly Places: and the Saints are Flesh of his
Flesh, and Bone of his Bone, that were his Church, which he is the Head of his
Body.] So far R. W. brings his Words; but these following he has left out,
and then calls them Short Answers, to wit [Every one that Eats his Flesh,
knows his Body given for the Life of the World; and the Body of Christ is not
out of the Sight of his Saints, that are the Church. Therefore you Ministers
and Teachers, that say, Christ's Body is out of the Sight, are not Saints;
neither are you His Church which is his Body: neither Eat you his Flesh; how
can you Eat, it being out of your Sight? nor know that which is Given for the
Life of the World. But you are Out of the Sight of his Church, which is his
Body.] And was Christ and his Body out of the Sight of Stephen, when he was
stoned to Death, when he saw Christ standing at the Right Hand of God? ( Act.
7, 26, 27.) And was Christ and his Body out of the Sight of the Seven Churches,
who walked in the midst of the Seven Golden Candlesticks* which were the Seven
Churches? (Rev. 1.2.) Or was he out of the Sight of John, that writ the
Revelations? and is he out of the Sight of them, that are the Holy City? (
Revel. 2, 22.) -- R. W. Replieth: In which, and all his Book over, though he
own a Christ without, that died at Jerusalem in Word, yet he allows in Effect
no other Body, but what is Mystical, etc. so that with Notorious Juggling and
Jesuitical Impudence etc. they leave him in his Body no more Blood to shed,
then is in a Spirit, etc.

Answ. Here R. W. does Confess, That G. F. owneth that Christ, that died at
Jerusalem. And yet he Contradicts himself, and says, He allows to Christ
no other Body, but what is Mystical and Spiritual: and yet himself says, That
Christ is the Head of his Church, as a Man's head is to his Body; and then, how
can it be Out of his Sight? -- But what must we understand by R. W.'s words?
That Christ is in Heaven with a Carnal Body* does not the Scripture speak of
Spiritual Bodies? and must not the Saints be made like unto his Glorious Body?
and is that Carnal? is it not Mystical to all the World? And the Apostle says
(speaking of the Resurrection) It is Sown a Natural Body, and rises a
Spiritual Body: and if the Saints must be raised a Spiritual Body; and Christ
in Heaven with a Carnal Body, how does this consist togegether, R. W? There is
a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body: and who is it, that has a
Spiritual Body? is it the First Adam, or the Last? for The First Adam is of the
Earth, Earthly, and the Second Man is the LORD FROM HEAVEN; and so has not he
a Heavenly Body? seeing, as the Saints have born the Image of the Earthly, so
they must the Heavenly? And therefore, how is now Christ in Heaven with an
Earthly, Carnal Body? (as some priests have affirmed against us, which has
been the Reason of these Discourses) 1. Corinthians. 15. But John in his Revel.
tells thee, That Christ walks in the midst of his Churches: and John
tells thee, what Christ's Eyes and his Feet are like, ( Revel, 2.) if thou
have an Ear to hear; and ( Revel. 1, 12, 13, 14.) of his Head, and his Hair and
his Countenance, which John fell down at: and do not thou say, That we deny the
Body of Christ; who own it, as the Scripture declare it. And what must we Infer
from R. W's words, that says, We leave no more Blood in Christ's Body to be
shed at all, then in a Spirit? what! must Christ come down from Heaven at the
Right Hand of God, and shed his Blood again? how proves R. W. this? prove
this, we Charge R. W. and all New-England-priests, by Scripture. Now, the
Saints Eating his Flesh and Drinking his Blood, and his Blood Sprinkling the
Consciences, that is Scripture: but to say, that Christ has yet to Shed his
Blood, that is Ignorance. Now, if this be R. W.'s and the New-England-priests
Doctrine, That Christ has his Blood to Shed, we tell him and them, that He
has Shed his Blood without the Gates of Jerusalem for our Sins, and risen for
our Justification; and was Dead, and is Alive, and Dies no more, but Lives
for Ever: and we Eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, through whom we have Life.

R. W. He brings ( G. F. Fol: 17) En^ch Howet saying: That [ It is Blasphemy
to say, that Christ is in Man, as God-Man. [And R. W. says, G. F. Answers,
like a Cuckoo in one silly Note.] G. F. Answ. [ How are they of his Flesh and
of his Bone? and does not the Scripture say, Christ in you, and, God will dwell
in you and walk in you? and are not his Saints of his Flesh and of his Bone?
and are they not Partakers of the Divine Nature?] And R. W. Replieth, and
Conf^sseth, that the Saints by Receiving of Christ Jesus, and by Believing in
him, did partake of the Divine Nature. -- And further R. W. says: Some have
been so Bold Bayards, as to say, they are Christ and God, as much as he; that
Died at Jerusalem; Christed with Christ, and Godded with God.

A^sw. These are R. W.'s own words, he has not brought forth his Author; if he
had had them from a Quaker, we should have heard his Name in print: but let the
Reader see, whether there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer to E.H? And then
he tells a Great Story of the Nicolatians and Rant^rs, which he might have
kept at home.

R. W. And R. W. tells, That the Humane Nature, and Soul and Body of Christ
Jesus is so cross, p. 51.
and opposite and contrary to their New Whimsical Christ, the Light within,
etc. and how that G. F. cannot endure the word Humane: and how the word Humane
is a Bugbear to G. F. in all his Book. For thou say, The word Humane
signifies pertaining or belonging to man: so Humane Soul or Body is no more,
but such a Soul and Body, as all Mankind have, etc (1 Corin. 10.)

Answ. We charge R. W. and all his New-England-Priests, where ever the Prophets
and Apostles give that name HVMANE to Christ's Body and Soul? And the word
HVMANE is not a Bugbear, nor Odious to G. F: but for thee and the priests to
give such Names to Christ, our Lord and Savior, which the Scriptures do not
give, and yet say, the Scriptures are the Rule, that is Abominable. And there
is no such word in 1. Corin. 10. that calls Christ's Body and Soul HVMANE:
and whether is Christ's Body Celestial, or Terrestrial, or which Glory does he
bear? seeing there is a Glory of the Celestial, and a Glory of the Terrestrial
Body? (1 Corin. 15, 14.) And G. F. does grant, and all the Quakers, that Christ
was made like unto us, Sin excepted, and had a Body and Soul, or else how could
he suffer? and is risen; the same that did Descend, is Ascended, as the Apostle
says. And Christ said, he was from above, and ye are from beneath: and ye are
of this world, and I am not of this world, ( Joh. 8:) and his Light within,
thou call here Dagon, their Monstrous, Horrible Idol of a Christ called
Light within. O! this Light and Christ within R. W. cannot endure to hear of;
that Evil Spirit, that dwells in him, makes him thus to blaspheme it! But we
must tell thee, None knows Christ, but as he Revea^eth himself by his Light
within: for Christ says, No man knows the Father, but the Son, and he, to
whom the Son will Reveal him.

R. W. brings Daniel Gawdry (in G. F.'s folio 282.) saying we shall not see
Christ, as he is, until he come to Judgment* and then, and not before we shall
see him.] G. F. Answ. [You, where you are, see him not, nor know him as he is,
we do believe you; but the Saints, the true Church, whom he is Head of, whom he
is in the midst, and in whom he is. And Christ told his Disciples, They had
known him, and they knew the Son of God, and had the Son, and they had the
Father also: and he that has not the Son, has not Life; and they had handled
and seen him. And the Hope in it self is Pure; and that is it, which purifieth
man, and makes him pure, as He is Pure, etc.

Answ. And are not these Christ's and the Apostle's words? but R. W. puts in
an IN more than G. F. and then he cries Nonsense, and Silly Lines: and he
Leaves out (as you may see page 282. in G. F.'s Book, where he leaves out*
Daniel Gawdry's words, how he contradicts himself. For after D. G. has said,
We shall not see Christ, as he is, till he come to Judgment; then, and not
before, we shall see him: and then D. G, says; Every man, that has this Hope,
purifieth himself: And what Hope is this? is not this Christ in him, the Hope
of Glory? and do not thou see him? And when R. W. says, He was not desirous
to trouble the Auditors with more Quotations: but still they urged, Have thou
any more? so it is like, thou wast Gravelled? but do not thou Contradict thy
self? before thou said, how thou Vrged'st them to bring out the Book?

R. W. And thou say; That G. F. affirms, etc. That Christ Jesus is as much
now seen visibly, p. 52.
as ever he shall be seen, etc. and then he falls a Railing, and cries out,
Deluded Soul. [But let the Reader read G. F.'s Answer to G. D. and see, if
there be any such words there, as R. W. has forged, who says, G. F.
affirms, etc] And thou Observest in G. F. 's Answer; That he cannot keep out
of his Burrow of confounding a Visible Eye and a Spiritual, a Visible and an
Invisible Seeing: and then fallest a Railing.

Answ. But let the Reader see, if there be any such Confounding in G. F.'s
Answer, that R. W. speaks of? But Christ says, No Man knows the Son, but
the Father; nor the Father, but the Son, and he to whom he Reveals him: Is
this Revelation or Sight a Visible Eye? seeing Christ says, Flesh and Blood
has not Revealed the Son of God to Peter, but the Father, that is in Heaven?

R. W. Thou say, Though we use to please Children and Fools with the Words
of Christ dying at Jerusalem, we see him in the midst of us, he is the
Invisible Head of the Church in God, etc.

Answ. Roger, these are Words of thy own, That we use to speak so, as to please
Children and Fools: for we do Really own Christ's dying at Jerusalem. And why
dost-thou scoff at Christ, he being in the Midst ^f his People by his Spirit?
and is that Visible? or is Christ in the Midst of People upon the Earth, as a
Man Visible? or is he in his Church by his Spirit Ruling and Ordering it, who
is the Head of it? And does not Paul tell thee, That the Church is in God? and
why do thou scoff at this, and say, We please Children and Fools with such
Speeches? for God's Saints being walking upon the Earth, how does Christ
exercise his Prophetical Office, his Kingly Office, his Priestly Office, etc?
does he it Visibly, or by his Power and Spirit? and so we do own Christ, as the
Scripture sets him forth.

R. W. Brings Richard Mayo ( G. F.'s Folio p. 276.) saying [ That he did
believe in a Christ, that died at Jerusalem; but not in a Christ within.] G. F.
Answ. [He that does not believe in a Christ within, does not believe in a
Christ, that died at Jerusalem: and he that does not believe in a Christ
within, and preach Christ within, is a Reprobate, according to the Apostle's
Doctrine, ( Col. 2. 2 Cor. 13.) And he is not in a True Belief of Christ
without, who believes not in Christ within; but is in the Devil's Belief, and
believes as the Devil's do.] R. W. Replieth: A humble Soul may see, how this
Subtle Traitor under the golden Name of Christ, and Christ within in the Heart
he Stabs at the Heart of the True Lord Jesus, who suffered for poor Mankind in
Man's own Nature at Jerusalem. Secondly, I observe his Virulent, Venomous Mind
and Pen stabbing, damning and reprobating all, that truly believe in the true
Lord Jesus, whom he confesses to have been a Real Man dying at Jerusalem, etc.
except they can believe, that he is now no where to be found, but in Every
Man's Heart, that comes into the world, that is, No where.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer to R.
M? And what must we Observe from R. W.'s words here? If Christ, which is in
Heaven, that does enlighten every Man, that comes into the World, and dwells
in the Hearts of his Saints (of them that Receive him, yet He) is No where (as
R. W. says); and Preaching Christ in people, except they be Reprobates (as the
Apostle did preach the True Lord Jesus Christ, him that died at Jerusalem) if
this be Virulent, Venomous and Stabbing, Traitorous, Reprobating and Damning
all, that truly believe in Christ, let the Wise in Heart Judge! and read Col.
2. and 2 Cor. 13. But R. W. we Charge thee and the New-England-Priests, to make
good by Scripture, That the True Lord Jesus Christ (who suffered at Jerusalem,
and is at the Right Hand of God, that) his Heart can be stabbed, and that he
must die again, who dies No More: No, R. W. he is out of your Reach; though ye
may Stab at him in his Members. O! that ever thou should take the Name of
Jesus in thy mouth, and call G. F. Subtle Traitor, that Labors in the Lord,
and Preaches the Name of Jesus Christ, his Death and Sufferings, who is
manifest in his people. But Roger, why did thou not bring in R. M.'s
Doctrine, who says, The Gospel was not the Power of God, no more then a
Rose-cake, which he laid his hands upon in the Window? (Fol. 278.) but this
thou have left out, thou thought, it would make against thee. And then thou
say [p. 52^ That they were Worthy of Christian Esteem and Honour] which were
our Opposers and Persecutors, like thee and the New-England-Priests.

R. W. He brings (from page 246. Fol.) Christopher Wade saying, etc. and
brings him again in the same page; p. 53.
and brings the same Author (from G. F.'s Fol. 248.) and again (from Fol.
249;) and again in the same page the same Author; and once more in the same
page, where he brings but bits and pieces of G. F.'s words, and leaves some
out. And R. W. thou scoffingly say (as the Reader may see, that reads G.
F.'s Book) Thou art Occasioned to follow this Fox in his Holes and Burrows, p*
54.
to hale him out before God, Angels and Men, as a most-Greedy and Audacious Fox
and Wolf, not sparing the Son and Lamb of God, nor his precious Lambs and Sheep.

Answ. These are Ungracious Expressions R. W; and thou must know God, and
Christ, and his Angels, before thou can bring any before them: and art
blasphemously calling the Christ of the Quakers, a Whimsical Christ. And did R.
W. bring these Quotations in the days of his Dispute? for these are but empty,
scoffing words, as Fox in his Burrows and Holes, most-Greedy, Audacious Wolf;
thou may apply them at home, and to the New England priests. Thus far we can
say, The Son of God is come (as John says) and we are in him; who has given
us Eternal Life, and an Understanding to know him, and loves all his Lambs.
And it is the New-England-priests, that have Not spared the Flock, the Precious
Lambs and Sheep of Christ, and SHED THEIR BLOOD: and thou would Devour them
(if it were in thy Power) who persecutest them with thy Tongue. But God and
Christ is above thee: and thou shall know, Christ (whom thou call the
Quakers Whimsical Christ) will Judge and Reward thee in the End for thy Evil
Speaking against him.

R. W. Says: That the Notion of Christ within, Opposite to Christ without, is
a most Frantic, Whimsical, Gross and Blockish Fancy. For though he grant,
Christ etc. yet making him only Spiritual, and such a Christ, as is Whole
Christ, God and Man in every man in the World, he makes Christ to be but a
Whimsical Christ; and that Man, that died at Jerusalem, but a Babilonian Fancy.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such Sayings in G. F.'s Answer, as
R. W.'s here, That the Whole Christ, that died at Jerusalem, God and Man in
every man in the World, etc? this is thy own Babilonish Fancy. We say, Christ,
that died at Jerusalem, Lights every man, that comes into the World: and
they that believe in the Light, receive Christ in them; and he that has the
Son, has the Father, as the Scripture says. But he that hates the Light of
Christ (as thou do,) hates both the Son, and the Father, and receives him
not; and that will be both thine and their Condemnation: and so God Revealing
his Son in the Apostle, and in his Saints, and their preaching him in the
people, is not in Opposition to Christ without, that died at Jerusalem.
Frantic, Whimsical, Gross, Blockish Fancy, R. W. might have kept these
Ungracious, Unsavory words (which savor not of the Spirit of God) at home for
his own food, and his New England priests.

R. W. He brings ( G. F.'s Fol. 222.) the Author of Hosanna the Son of David,
etc. saying: [Christ is without his Saints in Respect of his Bodily Presence.]
G. F. Answ. [They are Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone, and they Eat
his Flesh and drink his Blood. And how have the Saints his Mind and Spirit, and
he in them, and they in him, and sit with him in heavenly places? And he is the
Head of the Church; how then is he Absent, ye Poor Apostates from him, who feel
not Christ within you? And he is in the Saints, and they feel him.] R. W.
Replieth: I Observe this Viperous Tongue saying to the Unknown Heavenly Author,
etc. [ Old Persecutor, he should have said, of the people of God:] and then R.
W. falls a- Railing instead of Answering, and says; What is this, but a
Hight of Devilish Pride going before Destruction and Condemnation? this proud
Swelling Bladder pufft up with a Tympany of Wind -- what a huge Swelling Show
he makes, etc. what Brutish Impudency! a gross Frantic Papist, etc. [And
these Unsavory, Ungracious words Roger might have kept at home, for they be
his own.] And R. W. thou say, G. F. will not distinguish between Christ's
Spiritual Presence* and his Bodily; he will not consider the Difference between
Christ's Spirit and Body, etc. between their Sinful Flesh and Bones, and the
Sinless Flesh and Bones of the Man Christ Jesus, etc. between God manifested in
the Flesh and Bones of that Man Christ Jesus, and manifested in the Flesh and
Bones of Believers in him: and then fallest a- railing, etc. and say, -- the
Self-conceited into the Dungeon of such Black and He^lish Ignorance.

Answ. This is thy own Wilfulness, that can not receive a Distinction in thy
Self-conceit and Dungeon, and Black, Hellish Ignorance. For have not we said
over and over and was it not declared to thee in the Dispute, That we own God
Manifested in the Flesh and Bones of the Man Christ Jesus, and Suffered and
Died at Jerusalem, that is Risen, and is at the Right Hand of God? and that
also he is Manifest by his Spirit in his Saints? And as Christ says, They must
eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, if they would have Life in him, who is that
Bread, that comes down from Heaven, whose words were Spirit and Life? and does
not the Apostle say, The Saints were Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone?
and what! must we deny the Apostle's words, and Christ's Doctrine here, because
thou gain-say'st it? But why did not thou bring Hosanna's words (which thou
call'st, Heavenly Author) who says G. F.'s fol. 221.) The Evil done can never
appear to be Evil by the Light? now is not this Contradictory to the Apostle,
who says, Whatsoever is made manifest, is by the Light, etc.? And further thy
Heavenly Author says, [ It is not in the Power of the Light, to call any
thing, that is done, Good or Evil:] Is not this to Contradict the Apostle, who
says, Whatsoever Reproves, and makes Manifest, is Light? R. W. leaves out
his Heavenly Author's saying in this, for this was not for his Purpose, nor
none of the rest: if he had Considered it in the Fear of God, he would not have
left it out, but have judged it.

R. W. He brings (from page 217. Fol.) the Saying of an Adversary of the
People of God, p. 55.
viz: [ To say, Christ within, is never to mention Christ without.] G. F. Answ.
[There is none knows Christ within, but he knows him without, the same
yesterday, and to day and for ever. And there is none, that knows him, but
they know him within, revealed of the Father: which is beyond Flesh and Blood.]
And R. W. Replieth, and falls a railing, and says: This foolish Fox ( for
all his hiding Craft) is here found out: he professes against his will a
Christ, that died at Jerusalem, and therefore is he forced to name a Christ
without, etc. and then falls a- railing.

Answ. As for his Ungracious, Unsavory words, they are not worth mentioning:
let the Reader see, if G. F. ever denied Christ ( that died at Jerusalem) in
any of these pages, that he has brought, or in any of the Quakers Writings?
And thou have confessed, that we own Christ, that died at Jerusalem; and now thou
say, He is forced to name a Christ without: He suffered without; but does G.
F. say, as thou say, That he was born yesterday and to day? and, He died
yesterday, and he dies to day, and he dies for ever? are any of these words in
G. F.'s Answer? but did the Apostle say, Christ died to day, and yesterday,
etc. when he said, Christ, the same to day, yesterday and for ever?

R. W. But R. W. thou say: Such a Christ, as Really and Bodily died at
Jerusalem, they scorn, and hate, and fly from, as the Devils did, crying out,
etc.

Answ. Roger, thou addst Lie unto Lie. For that Christ, that died at Jerusalem
Bodily, we own; and it is thou, that scornest it, hate that Light and fliest
from it, as the Devils did, who hate the Light of Christ, which his Children
believe in, and become Children of Light. And we do tell thee, that Our Christ
Suffered upon a Material Cross in the Flesh (according to the Scripture)
without the Gates at Jerusalem Really, and is risen and manifest in us by his
Spirit. And a great deal of scornful Expressions thou have in this page, which
are not worth mentioning.

R. W. And thou bringst ( Fol. p. 211.) John Burton's saying, [ That that Man,
that was Crucified, his Body is now in the Presence of the Father, and Absent
from his people, as touching his Bodily Presence.] G. F. Answ. [Doth not the
Apostle say, He is the Head of the Church? and does not the Apostle say, They
are of his Flesh and Bone, and sit in heavenly places in Christ? and Christ
says, they must Eat his Flesh, and HE IS IN THEM.] R.W. Thou Reply and
say: G F. does plainly deny Jesus Christ to have such a Body, as could be
born of a Woman, wrapped in swadling-cloths, etc. as could be hungry, weary,
sleep, etc. buffeted* whipped, nailed to the Gallows, die, be buried, arise and
ascend up visibly into these Visible Heavens, p. 56.
now in the Presence of his Father, and Absent from his people on Earth
touching his Bodily Presence.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if G. F. speaks any such words; who owneth Christ
Jesus: and he and the people called Quakers deny his false Charge. And how
can thou own that Christ, thou speak of, that was wrapped, and in the
Manger, and buffeted and nailed to the Cross, and is risen, and at the Right
Hand of God, and not own his Light, by which he enlightneth all men, etc? for
we do abhor thy words in the Light, and Power and Spirit of Christ Jesus, who
was wrapped in swadling-Cloths, and in the Manger, and was an hungry, etc.
buffeted, whipped and nailed to the Cross, died, risen, and is Ascended far above
all the Heavens, and now in the Presence of his Father; yet manifest in his
Saints, by his Spirit, who Eat of his Flesh, and drink of his Blood, by which
they have Life in him, and sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. But
did ever the Quakers say, That Christ's Bodily, or Humane Presence (as thou
call'st it) is here now upon the Earth, as an Outward Man?

R. W. (From p. 210. fol.) He brings J. Borton's (our Old Adversary's saying,
[ Christ went away into Heaven from his Disciples; and so not within them.] G.
F. Answ. [Did not he say, that he would Come again to them? and did he not say,
that he was in them (to wit, I in you, and you in me? read John, for Christ
said it in his Prayer.) And did not the Apostle say, Christ is in you, except
ye be Reprobates? and, The Hope of Glory? And was not he revealed in the
Apostle, and so in him? and did not the Apostle preach Christ within, as well
as without? and you will have us preach him without, and not within: so, is not
this to keep people Reprobates?] And again R. W. brings (from Fol. the same
page) [ Those Believers, that are in the Body at this day, are Absent from the
Lord.] G. F. Answ. [Doth not the Apostle say, Christ is in them, except they be
Reprobates? and, he is in them the Hope of Glory? And the Saints had fellowship
with God the Father ( John 1:) and God will dwell in them, and walk in them?
And, he that believes, believes in him (to wit, God and Christ?) and so not
Absent:] who are grafted into him, and abide in the Vine. So all the Priests
Work has been to preach Christ Absent, and out of his people, that the Devil
may rule in the Hearts* not Christ. -- And he brings the same page (fol.
210.) [They say, He is absent from them, as touching his Flesh.] G. F. Answ. [
Does not the Apostle say, They are of his Flesh and of his Bone? and they that
Eat not his Flesh, have not Life in them? and they Sit in Heavenly Places in
him? and he that Eats his Flesh, has it in him?] Again (in the same page
Fol.) R. W. brings the Priest's saying [ There is not any Heaven within* into
which the Man Christ is Ascended: or, can any man contain a Man four foot long?
p. 57.
] G. F. Answ. [Christ is a Mystery; and is not he to be Revealed within, who is
a Mystery? He, who did Ascend to be Revealed, and made Manifest in his Saints
in Flesh and Spirit, that did Descend; which is now Manifested, that the World
wondereth at: that is Ascended far above the Heavens, who is the Saints Life,
Living Bread and Drink (to wit, from Heaven.) And where did ever the Ministers
of Christ use such Expressions, as thou do? which shows, that Christ to
thee is a Mystery.] R. W. Replieth: In all these four Passages G. F. expressly
denies, that Christ is Ascended into Heaven from his Disciples; that Believers
now in the Body are Absent from the Lord, etc.

Answ. These things are Answered before: but R. W. adds Lie to Lie. How often
has G. F. confessed, That Christ is Ascended into Heaven, and yet made manifest
in his Disciples? and how can he be Absent, that dwells in them, and walks
in them, and rules in their hearts by Faith, and sit in him, etc? And the
Kingdom of Heaven is within; and does not Christ Rule there by Faith? but did
ever G. F. or the Quakers say, That Christ a Man of Four Foot Long rules in
Peoples Hearts; which R. W. brings here? And as for an Image, and Picture,
and Imaginary Christ, (which he calls the Light within) R. W. that is thy own
Condition, Picture and Image, who blasphemest against Christ and his Light, and
at the Quakers, who own the True Lord Jesus Christ, that has enlightened them,
as the Scriptures own him.

R. W. Brings John Burton ( G. F. Fol. page 206.) saying [ A false Christ
has a new false Faith, to apprehend this Crucified Christ within.] G. F. Answ.
[Which is contrary to the Faith of the Apostles, which preached CHRIST (that is
Crucified (to wit, without the Gates at Jerusalem) WITHIN, and not another; and
him that is raised up from the Dead, and is risen, the Lord Jesus Christ
within, the same yesterday, to day and for ever, by whom the World was made: it
was he, that is manifest in the Saints, and not another; for the other is
Antichrist.] And R. W. has Crucified the Son of God to himself a fresh: and is
not this Within, R. W. that makes thee to rail so against his Light? -- And R.
W. bingeth the same page and Priest saying: [ It is a Scripture of the Devil's
making, to apprehend this Crucified Christ within] G. F. answers [Now I say,
if there be any other Christ (but he that was crucified) within (to wit,
Revealed within in the hearts of his people) he is a false Christ: and the
Scriptures hold forth this, and the Devil never made it; but he and his
Messengers are against it. And he that has not this Christ (that was crucified
and risen (to wit, Revealed) Within, is a Reprobate, though Devils and
Reprobates may talk of him Without.] And R. W. replieth with Railing, and
says: For these subtle Foxes and their words discover (as the Sun at Noonday)
that as plainly as ever Absalom and Achitophel etc. rose up etc. against David,
p. 58.
etc. as Judas etc. Alexander etc. and Himeneus, and Julian the Apostate denied
David's Antitype, the true Lord Jesus, so under a Cloak and Color of Christ
Crucified within do their Rebellious Traitors bear Arms against the Mediator
betwixt God and Man, the man Christ Jesus, etc.

Answ. R. W. thou might have applied all this at home; for thou spoke forth
thy own Condition, and not the Quakers: for there are no such words in G. F.'s
Answers to his Opposers, as thy Evil Spirit has Invented. And thou
Contradictest thy self: For though (say thou) it be Scripture Phrase, that
we are Crucified, Dead, and Buried and Risen with Christ; yet (thou say)
what a poor Proof is this, that Christ was Born and Crucified, etc. yesterday
and to day within us? These words are thy own Lies; there are no such words in
G. F.'s Answer, neither did he ever say so, nor Quakers.

R. W. And thou say, There is no other Birth, nor Life, nor Death, nor
Grave, but what is within us: and all are Reprobates and Devils, that bow not
down to this painted, devouring Monster.

Answ. R. W. These are thy own Painted, Monstrous words, not ours, which we
never heard of before; neither be there any such words (the Reader may see) in
G. F.'s Answer to the Priest. And then thou boastest, what thou have done; but
little cause have thou to boast, who make Lies thy Refuge: for Christ's
Birth, Death, Grave, and Crucifying, and Jerusalem without us, and the Man
Christ Jesus, the Mediator between God and Man we own; and do abhor thy words.
Cloak and Color thou may keep to thy self, and thy Dunghil-Righteousness,
thou speak of; and these are Evil Fruits, that come from thy Evil Tree: and
if thou had had the least Fear of God before thy Eyes, thou would have
never published such Slanders and Lies of God's people, which are clear of them.
But we cannot deny God, who has Revealed his Son in us, that was Crucified
without the Gates of Jerusalem, who was Dead, and is Alive, and lives for
Evermore: and not (as thou lyingly say) Crucified yesterday, and to day
within us. But such as thou art, Crucify him to your selves a fresh (as the
Apostle tells thee) and put him to open Shame, and rail against such as will
not Crucify him to themselves a fresh, as thou do: no, we love the Lord
Jesus Christ, our Savior and Mediator better.

R. W. Thou bring Thomas Moor ( G. F. Fol. page 35.) saying [ Christ is
Absent from us, while we are in this Mortal Body.] G. F.'s Answer. [Contrary to
the Apostle, who says, The Life of Christ is manifest in their Mortal Flesh.]
And ( Fol. p. 36.) the same Author saying [ Christ is distinct from every one
of us, and without us in our particular persons.] And G. F. Answers, [The
Apostle says, Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates; and they were
of his Flesh and of his Bone. And they Ate his Flesh and drank his Blood; then
it was in them: and he is Distinct from none, but Reprobates, who hate the
Light.] R. W. In thy Reply thou say, Thou wondrest not so much at this
Thunder, p. 59.
etc. and that all are Reprobates with him, that bow not down to his Carved
Image, as thou did wonder at thy Opposites, who had said, they would not
follow G. F. but in the Truth, etc.

Answ. Well, if we said so, thou have not made out to the Contrary yet, that we
follow him out of the Truth? what! because thou say, It Is Thunder, and Fire
and stinking Brimstone to say, They are Reprobates, (as the Apostle did) that
have not Christ in them? and because he will not say, as T. M. (one of thy
Worthy Christians) Christ is Absent and Distinct from us, while we are in this
Mortal Body? I tell thee, we have more Esteem for, and are better Witnesses of
the Ancient Primitive Doctrine, then thus at once to deny that Christ, and his
Appearance and Dwelling in his people, which the Apostle preached ( Col. 1.)
then with thee and thy Worthy Christians (as thou call'st them) to thrust him
out of our Bodies, which are his Temple, and have him always Absent. Then how
should he Dwell in us? and how should he be Our Life? and how should we F^ed
upon him? and how should our Hearts be Sanctified by him? and how should we be
His, seeing the Apostle says, He that has not the Spirit of Christ is none of
his? And, If Christ be in you, the Body is dead, because of Sin: and, If the
Spirit of him, that raised up Jesus from the Dead, dwell in you, he shall also
quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit, that dwells in you ( Romans 8, 10,
11.) and as G. F. Answers, That the Life of Christ is manifest in our mortal
Flesh, and manifest in our Body (according to the Apostle's words 2 Corinthians. 4,
10, 11.) Now R. W. would thou have us Deny G. F. in this, and not to Plead
for him? why do thou not speak out, and say, Thou wonderest, that we will not
deny the Apostles, but plead for them? for did not they preach this Doctrine?
and did not they preach Christ within after his Resurrection, and said, he was
their Life; and they that had him not, had not Life? And did not the Apostles
say, they were Of his Flesh and Bone, etc? why should thou wonder, that we
own G. F. in holding according to the Scriptures? And do not thou often in
thy Book say, G. F. owneth that Christ, that died at Jerusalem? (as page 50.
thou say, he Owneth Christ without, and that died at Jerusalem? and page 52.
thou say, He confesses him to have been a Real Man dying at Jerusalem:)
now, whether we may with more safety take his own words to be his mind* or take
thy sayings, He Intends so, contrary to his words? for this is thy way of
proving him and us all to deny Christ by thy Meanings, that thou bring'st
Contrary to our Words, all may see, that read thy Book. See page 45. where thou
say, That Quakers say, Christ was born at Bethlehem, and died at Jerusalem;
but intend in truth and reality no other Birth, Life nor Death, but what may be
Extant and wrought in the Heart of Man: Here ( as in many other places of thy
Book) all may see, how Contrary to our Words thou Judge our Intents;) and
from this Ground (which we say in the presence of God, is false, and nothing,
but thy own Inventions) thou thus Judge and Condemnest us as Deniers of
Christ's Coming and Suffering in the Flesh for Sin: but here we find thee in
the Bog and Swamp lost between Christ within and Christ without, which the
Apostles preached, their Gospel being hid from thee, thy Eye being darkened. --
And R. W. thou say, Thou wondrest, we should be so blinded and hardened, as
to plead for G. F. in all particulars: And in the same page thou say, Thou
do not Remember, that any of thy Three Opposites answered to any of thy
Observations on Fox's Principles, Answers and Evasions. -- Is not h^re a
Palpable Contradiction? first, to say, We did so much plead for, and excuse G.
F; and then to say, Thou do not remember, We gave any Positive Answer? if so,
what did we plead? Thou say, All our work was, to keep our selves within our
burrows.

R. W. He brings Francis Higginson's Saying [ Christ's Humane Nature etc:] G.
F.'s Fol. 71.) G. F. Answ. [Where does the Scripture speak of Humane? the word
HVMANE where is it written, that we may search for it? Though we do not deny,
that Christ according to the Flesh, was of Abraham; but not the word HVMANE:
and Christ's Nature is not Humane, which is Earthly; for that is the First
Adam.] R. W. replieth and says, This Ignorant, simple Cavil ( as I have before
proved it to be from 1 Corinthians. 10.) is often brought by G. F. in his Book in a
horrible Equivocation, Let the Reader see, if there be any such word, as Humane
Nature of Christ, in 1 Cor. 10?
to overthrow and destroy that Humane Nature, that Flesh and Body, of the Lord
Jesus, who yet had such a Body (they say) that died at Jerusalem.

Answ. Do not thou here Contradict thy self, in saying, We say, That he had
such a Body, that died at Jerusalem? they are not G. F.'s words, the Humane
Body of Christ, it is the Priests; for we own the Flesh and Body of Jesus
Christ: and as for Equivocation, thou may keep it at home. And Christ says,
his Flesh and Blood is Meat indeed: and he is the Bread of Life, that came from
Heaven; and is it Humane Flesh R. W. that the Saints eat? and is it Humane
Blood, the Saints drink? but thou should have proved this by Scripture in
plain words. And does not Christ say, That he is from above, and ye from
beneath: I am from Heaven, and ye are from the Earth? and, as is the Earthly,
such are the Earthly; and as is the Heavenly, such are they also, that are
Heavenly? The First Man is of the Earth, Earthly; the Second Man (Mark, Man) is
the LORD FROM HEAVEN (1 Cor. 15, 47, 48.) and Christ is of the Seed of Abraham
according to the Flesh: This is according to Scripture. But

R. W. says, This is a Mental Reservation, according to their Flesh, God in
their Flesh, and Christ in their Flesh s^ffering at Mystical Jerusalem within
them.

Answ. R. W. read in any of the Quakers Books, or let the Reader see, whether
there be any such word in G. F.'s Answer, as, Christ's suffering in Our Flesh at
Mystical Jerusalem?) these are R. W.'s words, which he has forged (as the
Reader may see, he often forgeth many words, which were never spoken by us) and
then he cries out, Traitorous (and Blasphemy,) Mental Reservation: which
indeed is his own Condition. For we declare, that God was manifest in the Flesh
of Christ, and Christ Suffered in the Flesh without the Gates of Outward
Jerusalem, and is Risen, and is at the Right Hand of God: and nevertheless
Christ is manifest in our mortal Bodies, and God dwells in us, and walks in
us, and we are his Temple. And now, we cannot deny this, which is the Apostle's
Doctrine; though R. W. opposes the Apostle's words, and says, That we deny
Christ without, and God manifest in the Flesh, his Sufferings at Outward
Jerusalem, Death and Resurrection, which we own. But this is his Wickedness and
Wilfulness; and he puts us in his Bear's Skin to set his Dogs at Us, to make
people believe, That We do not believe, Christ died at Jerusalem, because we
say, that he is manifest within Us, 2 Cor. 4, 10, 11. And we are of the Seed of
Abraham and Isaac, and are in Christ Jesus* the Light, in whom all Nations are
Blessed: and thou that art not in him, and He in thee, art in the Serpent's
Nature, and Reprobate, as thou speak of.

R. W. And thou bring'st Act. 13. At Antioch Barnabas and Paul in a Synagogue
of the Jews made the Humane Nature of the Lord Jesus, page 60.
(as also in other places) the great Subject of their Discourse and Preaching,
etc.

Answ. And had Christ no Body, till Paul and Barnabas made it their Discourse
in the Synagogue at Antioch? Nay, it was God, that prepared him a Body, before
Paul was converted, or Barnabas either: and Act. 13, 38. speaks no such thing
of Christ's Humane Nature, there is no such word there; let the Reader see, how
thou have added to the Scripture. For is not Christ the Spiritual and Heavenly
Man, (1 Cor. 15?) Therefore do not rail and say, we deny the Body of Christ,
because we deny thy Term or Title Humane, of thy Imagination.

R. W. Thou tellest of a Diabolical Christ and Fancy within us, begotten by the
Devil on a proud, lazy Ignorance.

Answ. This is thy own Condition, and thy own Christ R. W: for the True Christ,
that lights every Man, that comes into the World, with the True Light, which
gives us the knowledge of him, we own and honor. For how can thou and the
New-England-Priests own the True Christ, and do not own his Light, which
lights every Man, that comes into the World? you are not like to Own the
true Christ. And Roger, sometimes thou call'st the Scriptures the Word,
sometime the History, sometimes the Word of God; and art Angry with the
Quakers, because they will not call them the Word? and yet thou say, I could
not prove, wherein the Scripture was called the Word of God: So it is clear, R.
W. will call them that, which he cannot prove; and yet the Scriptures are his
Rule, and not the Spirit.

R. W. He brings Thomas Collier's Sayings ( G. F.'s fol. page 37) [If the
very Christ of God [ R. W. says, Christ, God-Man] be within those, that are
called Quakers, he cannot come down from Heaven.] G. F. Answ. [Here he stands
against the Promise of Christ, That he shall come and dwell in you, and walk in
you; and I will come again unto you. And, He has revealed his Son in me, says
the Apostle: and thus thou T. C. and J. B. are ignorant of plain Scripture; the
Scripture declares it. And the Apostle said, Know ye not, that Christ is in
you, except ye be Reprobates? and, The Spirit of the Father speaks in you.
And how Contrary art thou to the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles!]. And then
R W. Replieth, and tells a Great Story, and says: That G. F. plainly denies
the expected Personal Coming of the Lord Jesus.

Answ There is no such thing in G. F.'s Answer, the Reader may see; but how God
and Christ will dwell in his Saints. But G. F. does not say, That Christ, a Man
of Four foot long is dwelling in the Saints ^ page 57.) for God and Christ
dwells in his Saints by his Spirit. -- And where did ever G. F. say, That
Christ, God-Man, dwelt in him? where is any such Expression in his Book, Christ
God-Man? where does he find these words in Scripture? though God, and the Man
Christ Jesus is owned, as the Scripture speaks.

R. W. And when John Stubs was speaking to thee, what the Hebrew Word of
Everlasting Father Signified, thou said, page 61.
Some had rendered it, the Father of Ages, or an Age; but then thou told'st
John, It was not a Seasonable Time to spend time about Translations. And thou
say, J. Stubs understood Hebrew, Greek and other Languages as well as thy
self, and better too; [and did J. Stubs tell thee, he understood Hebrew, Greek
and other Languages as well a thou, and better too?] and then say, Thou wast
about to say, how wonderfully they were changed from their former Principles
and Practices, etc.

Answ. No such thing, Roger: but it seems, here It was not a Seasonable Time,
when J. S. had Gravelled thee, though thou begunst thy self with Hebrew; and
yet, when thou were stopped with it, it was not a Seasonable Time.

R. W. And thou say: They have professed to thee, that they have no need of
Books, no, not of the Scripture it self, [but who those are, thou have not
named;] for they had the Teacher within them, that gave forth the Scripture,
etc. now they are persuaded to study the Scripture and the Translation of it,
etc.

Answ. Thou, that Studiest the Scripture and outward Translations without the
Spirit, that gave them forth, thou will not understand them, no more then
Antichrist and the Wolves in Sheeps-Cloathing. And it was always our Practice
to Study the Scriptures with the Spirit, that gave them forth (as thou may
see in the End of G. F.'s Fol:) so we are not Erred from our First Principles,
as thou Scoffingly speak, nor did we ever Neglect and Slight them as Useless
and Needless, as thou maliciously say. --

R. W. And thou scoffingly say, What Simplicity is it in us, to stoop down
to Pen an Ink, when the Light is sufficient to bring us to Heaven, to guide us
Immediately and Infallibly, etc.

Answ. We tell R. W. that Pen and Ink, and Fallible Translations will not guide
him nor his New England-priests to Heaven: and therefore do not scoff at the
Sufficiency of the Light, for in the Light we see more Light. Nor do not mock
at the Immediate and Infallible Teaching of the Spirit of God; for They that
are lead with the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God: for the Spirit of God
leads into all Truth; and that is Sufficient.

R. W. And thou say again: The truth is, they look at the Scriptures still,
but as the Ceremonies, which the Apostles dispensed with for a Season: they
care no more for the Scriptures, than the Papists do.

Answ These words R. W. has forged himself, and they are none of ours; he
might have applied them at home. And we have Esteem of the Scriptures, and know
them by the Spirit, that gave them forth; and to what End.

R. W. And then thou railest at W. Edmundson, who said unto thee, p. 62
Thou kept them long, but proved nothing: [and that he truly said; but thou
manifestest thy own Folly.] And thou say, W. E. fell into a down right
Speech or Sermon: [but why did thou not print the Sermon?] And thou say,
He declared, how notoriously thou had wronged them, in laying and publishing
so many false, and some of them dangerous Charges against them; and how they
had been so patient toward thee, and suffered thee to produce so many
Allegations out of G. F.'s Book, and yet they spoke nothing for thee R. W. but
G. F.'s his words cleared him from all thy Unjust Challenges and Charges. And
That W. E. Appealed to the people, how willingly they had showed themselves to
own the Scriptures, and to have all their Teachings and Differences tried by
the Scriptures. And so W. E.'s words will stand upon R. W. and all his
Teachers, (as ye may see page 62* 63.) -- And when W. E. mentions the
Preaching of the Light (of Christ,) Roger puts in his Margent, And his Vain
Extelling of their Idol Light.

Answ. Now, is it not Clear, that R. W. (who calls himself Orator) denies
the true Christ, the Light of the World, which Lights every man with the true
Light, that comes into the World, who blasphemously calls this Light, an
Idol? --

R. W. And then thou Scoffingly say, How J. Stubs began a large Speech or
Sermon: [but both J. S.'s. and W. E.'s Sermon (if they were Large) thou have
printed them very Short.] And then thou say, W. E. that Pragmatical,
Insulting Soul Stopped thee, p. 63.
so that thou openly complained'st of Incivility.

Answ. But why should not we have Liberty to Speak, as well as thou? And the
people knows, how many Long Speeches thou made, but nothing to the purpose,
what thou promised'st to prove out of G. F.'s Book; which was quite the
contrary: and thou could make nothing Good out of it for thy Purpose R. W.
as was Evident, when G. F.'s Book was brought forth. And when W. E. did Appeal
to the People, thou have not showed, that the people was dissatisfied with W.
E.'s Appeal: and were not W. E.'s and J. S.'s their Speeches (which thou
scoffingly call'st Sermons) to the Matter of the false Charges, which thou
could not make Good?

R. W. And thou Say: Is it comely, when persons are Disputing, to fall upon
our knees, and Answer an Argument with a Prayer. p. 64.


Answ. But did there any of the Quakers do so at this Three-Days Work at
Newport? let the people there Judge, whether R. W. speaks the Truth in this?
for we Remember no such thing done there by any. But set the Case, they had;
what! does R. W.'s Spirit so Envy Prayer? and W. E. might very well say, Why
should we sit here? when thou had kept them there to hear thy Lies Two Days
together, and had proved nothing to the Purpose: therefore we had a great
deal of Patience to bear thee so long, to multiply thy false Charges and
Blasphemies against Christ, and his Light and Holy Spirit, as thou did; as
may be seen at large in thy own Book. And thou say, That We Spoke so much:
but let the Reader see, whether thou have not here Spoken a great deal more,
than we all, as thy own Book testifies.

R. W. And again thou say, That We be not Able to Answer, nor to Bear thy
words.

Answ. This the people knows, that heard our Answers and thy Words, whether
we did not Answer to thy false Charges, and disproved them out of G. F.'s Book
(which thou brought) and by Scripture.

R. W. Thou say, Thou took'st a little Boldness, and told'st us, that if
Paul himself was present, and Jesus Christ himself in their Bodily Presence (
which we confessed, he died in at Jerusalem) yet we would say unto Christ and
Paul, Thou have falsely Charged us; and, Paul and Christ had proved nothing: and
Paul and Christ should be a Blasphemer and Beelzebub, because he brought glad
News of the Truth from Heaven to them.

Answ. R. W. These are False Charges of thine, and Great Boldness and
Wickedness: and did thou Say all these words in the Dispute? let the people
Judge; for we do not remember, thou did. And do thou compare thy self with
Paul and Christ Jesus here? and must we look upon thy foul Slanders and Lies as
News from Heaven? Nay; for thou deniest him and his Light, who is the Good News
from Heaven, that is God's Salvation, that Old Simeon rejoiced at. But R. W.
what must we Infer from thy words? That Jesus Christ himself in our Bodily
Presence, etc. as thou say? Is not this so much as to say, That Jesus Christ
was not in R. W.'s Bodily Presence at New-port in the Dispute? which we do
believe him, it was not the Motion of the Spirit, nor the Spirit of God and
Christ, that moved him to that Work; but the Father of Lies. For we can say,
that we felt the Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ manifest in our Mortal
Bodies, carrying us on in his Work at that Time (Glory to his Name for Ever!)
by his Light, Power and Spirit: but it is like, R. W. did not feel him, who
scoffeth at his Spiritual Appearance in his people. So as for Blasphemer and
Beelzebub he might have kept at home.

R. W. Thou make a great Noise (in page 64, and 65,) and say: As we have
denied the Person of the Lord Jesus, so we deny his Offices: when it was
demanded, Wherein? thou said, Thou had many things to declare; and then
tell, What the Papists hold: and say; The Quakers set up a Voice or
Motion within them, overtopping the Voice of Christ Jesus in the Scriptures:
page 65.
and some of us maintaining, that the Light within is that Great Prophet, that
was to come, which Moses Prophesied of. And that we are notoriously guilty of
High Treason against the King of Kings, the Lord Jesus, etc. and rob him of his
Crown, etc.

Answ. The Person of the Lord Jesus Christ we own, and all his Offices in his
Church, which he exercises by his Light and Spirit, which Light R. W.
Blasphemously calls an Idol; and therefore he is not like to own and see
Christ in his Offices in his Church, how he exercises them there. And our
Motions of God's Spirit and of Christ are owned with the Spirit of Christ, and
the same, that gave forth Scripture: and so it will not Overtop or Over-pour
it self. And thou, that have not the Spirit of Christ, art none of his: and the
Spirit of Christ in Our Age owneth the Voices and Motions given forth from it
self in Ages past, and does not Overtop and Over-pour them, as thou vainly and
foolishly say. And the Great Prophet, which Moses spoke of (to wit, Christ,)
IS COME, and has enlightened us with his True Light, which is in our Hearts,
that gives us the Knowledge of him: and thou, that call'st this Light within (
that gives the Knowledge of Christ, which comes from him) an Idol wickedly,
thou deniest this True Prophet in blaspheming his Light within, whom we
maintain. For this Great Prophet says, I am the Light of the World; and so is
the True Light, that Lights every Man, that comes into the World: and so,
thy Thoughts, that thou have contracted, of Notoriously guilty of High Treason
against the Lord of Lords, and KING of KINGS, Christ Jesus, is thy own.

R. W. Thou say: They Rob him [Christ, the KING of KINGS] of his Crown, and
Life and all.

Answ. R. W. and the Priests of New England, Can the Lord Jesus Christ, the
King of Kings and Lord of Lords (who is Ascended far above all Heavens, and at
the Right Hand of God, who is now manifest by his Spirit in his people) be
robbed of his Crown, and Life and All? can R. W. and you New England Priests
take away his Crown of his Head, and Life and All? is this the True Christ,
that can be thus Robbed, that R. W. pleads for? We must tell him, that the
True Christ, the King of Kings, the Lord of Glory, he cannot Rob him of his
Crown and Life; for no Robbers can Ascend, where Christ is: and here he
speaks, like a Man that doteth; and is this the New-England-High-priests
Orator? For does not Christ Encourage his Saints to lay up Treasure in Heaven,
where the Thieves come not? but by R. W.'s Argument, as far as in them lay,
they can Rob him of it. Thou say, As far as in them lay: but we must tell
thee, this cannot he said, and thou speak vainly; though thou may
Crucify him to thy self a fresh. And R. W. has not proved this Assertion,
That we go about to do any such thing; but it is his own Assertion, that
calls his Light an Idol: and we might very well Deny all thy Proofs, seeing
that thou could make none of them Good out of G. F.'s Book,

R. W. Thou say, We deny that Visible Kingdom and Church and Institutions,
which he (Christ) as King over all his Subjects, has Sovereign Right unto, and
most faithfully and wisely Ordained to continue, till his Coming again. And
thou say, Thou Told us, that G. F.'s his Book and all our Books and
Professions denied any Visible Church of Christ at all, and Visible Officers,
and that we maintain, the Church was in God.

Answ. Christ says, His Kingdom is not of this World, but an Everlasting
Kingdom. And how will thou prove, that Christ's Kingdom is Visible? is it not
Spiritual, and rules in the Hearts of his people? and is not that a Spiritual
Rule? He Rules the Nations with a Rod of Iron; is that Outward? His Kingdom we
do own* though all his Subjects, his people (as to the Bodies) be Visible, and
his Church; yet he Rules them by his Invisible Power and Spirit. And does G.
F.'s Book, that thou brought, and other Books or any of the Quakers
Profession prove, that the Church of Christ (or Outward Congregations, to wit,
the Bodies of his people) [were Invisible? though we do maintain, That the
Church is in God (as the Apostle says 2 These. 1.) And we Worship God in Spirit
and in Truth; and is not the Spirit Invisible? and though the Outward Bodies of
the Saints and Officers of the Church are Visible, but the Holy Ghost, that
makes them Officers and Overseers, is Invisible: and is not Christ's Baptism
with the Holy Ghost and Fire Invisible? and is not this within? And Christ
says, If any one hear my Voice, and open unto me, I will come in to him, and
Sup with him, and he with me: Is this Supper Visible? ( Revel. 3, 20.) And as
for Outward Bread, Water and Wine, art thou in that Practice thy self?

R. W. And thou say, J. Stubs demanded of thee, why thou Charged'st us of
being Guilty, and not Living in Church-Ordinance thy self?

Answ. J. Stubs had Good Reason to ask thee this Question, seeing thou live
not in the Practice, nor under the Exercise of none thy self, as we understand.
And whom has R. W. Fellowship withal? or of what Church is he a Member of? but
is not R. W.'s (like wild Ismael) his Hand against every man? the Bond-Woman's
Son cast out of Abraham's Family, the Father of the Faithful? and well might J.
Stubs reprove thee, who live in none, and opposest us, that do. And thou
go over and over with thy Tautologies of Christ, the King of Kings his
Visible Kingdom, and how that we turned all to Notions and Fancies of an
Invisible Kingdom: Roger, are not the True Christians Christ's Army and
Officers, though they outwardly be Visible? are the Weapons of Christ's
Ministers and Officers Visible? yet do not they say, Their Weapons are
Spiritual, and not Carnal? and is Spiritual Visible? And does not the Apostle
say, The Kingdom of God stands not in Words, but in Power and Joy in the Holy
Ghost? and is the Power of God, and the Holy Ghost Visible, in which the
Kingdom stands? prove thou and the New England priests this by Scripture;
though the Saints Bodies, that possess this, are Visible: and thou may take
thy Notions and Fancies to thy self of God and Christ's Kingdom.

R. W. After thy Search thou say, Thou do believe, that some come nearer
to the First Primitive Churches, and Institutions and Appointments of Christ
Jesus, then others, as in many Respects, so in that Gallant, p. 66.
and Heavenly and Fundamental Principle of the true Matter of a Christian
Congregation, Flock or Society (viz) Actual Believers, True Disciples and
Converts, Living Stones, etc: This was, and I hope is the Principle of the
New-English Church.

Answ. How now Roger, art thou Flattering the NEW-ENGLAND-CHVRCH, and Daubing
of them here with thy Untempered Mortar to get Favor, who have so long lived
in the Woods and Wildernesses, like Ismael? but let us Examine this
NEW-ENGLAND-CHVRCH with their Heavenly, Fundamental Principles, and try th^se
Actual Believers, True Disciples and Converts, Living Stones etc. which thou
say, Come nearer to the First Primitive Churches, and Institutions and
Appointments of Christ. And yet R. W. professes, That if his Soul could find
Rest in Joining with any of the Churches professing Christ Jesus, now Extant,
he would readily and gladly do it. How now Roger, can thou not Join with
those Actual Believers, True Disciples and Converts, Living Stones, to wit. The
CHVRCH in NEW ENGLAND, which was, and hopest she is, and comes nearer to the
Primitive Churches, and Institutions and Appointments of Christ's Gallant and
Heavenly, Fundamental Principle? Why! can not thou Join with this R. W. that
thou have extolled so high? But Roger, as we said before, we must Try this
CHVRCH of NEW ENGLAND by the Fruits, as Christ Commands us, whether she be
not the Whore, and False Prophet and Strumpet, and Antichrist, and the Beast,
that has her Power from the Dragon, that made war with the Saints, and the
Whore, that drunk the B^ood of the Saints, and the inward^y Ravening Wolves,
that devour the Sheep in the Sheeps-Cloathing, and inwardly Ravened from the
Spirit of God, and the Light, which comes from Christ Jesus; which thou
call'st an Idol: and so have denied the True Lord Jesus Christ.

And Christ says, We shall know them by the Fruits; and so we must try them by
the Fruits as Christ says. For Do men gather Grapes of Thorns* or Figs of
Thistles? And now, let AMERICA and EVROPE whom the Sound of the Fruits of this
CHVRCH of NEW ENGLAND is come into, see, if they be such, as R. W. has
Uncharacterized them to be? Have they not manifest themselves to be the Thorny
Trees ( not the Vines) and the Thistles ( not the Fig Trees) by their Pricking
and Tearing of God's Chosen? Have they not manifested themselves to be the
Wolves Worrying and Devouring of God's Lambs and Sheep? and have they not
HVNTED them with their Outward Dogs up and down the Woods? Have they not WHIPPED
and TORN the very Bodies of Men and Women on Whip-stocks, till they Tore the
very Pa^ of the tender Breast? Have they not WHIPPED WITH PITCHED ROPES the very
Body to a Yelly. Have they not HANGED FOUR OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD upon the
Gallows, and BANISHED MANY upon PAIN of DEATH? Have they not made FINES, that
none should receive God's people, nor a Book; and said GREAT FINES, upon
Masters of Ships, that they should bring none into the Country? and IMPRISONED
Multitudes, and CVT OFF the EARS of such, as came to visit the Prisoners, to
see, what God's people lacked in their* Doleful Prisons? Have they not BVRNT
and BRANDED with a Hot Iron? Have they not SPOILED MVLTITVDES of the Lord's
peoples Goods, and been Worse, then ever the Bishops were in Old-England? FINED
them five Shillings a day, that do not come to Hear them; whereas they know, in
England the Law was but Twelve Pence? And all this for their OBEDIENCE to
CHRIST JESUS.

Whose BLOODY, CRVEL, MVRTHEROVS ACTIONS will be -- CHRONICLED TO POSTERITY!

And these are R. W.'s Living Stones, Actual Believers, True Disciples,
Converts, Heavenly, Fundamental Principles of the true matter of a true
Christian Congregation, Fle^k and Society; and these come nearer to the First
Instititutions and Appointments of Christ Jesus, as R. W. says -- Now, we
charge Roger Williams and his New-England-Teachers and Church, to show us,
wherever the Living Stones, the Converted, that were in the Fundamental
Principles of a Christian, and the Disciples of Christ Jesus used all or any of
these Carnal Weapons to Hang, Burn, Whip, Spoil Goods, Cut off Ears, as R. W.'s
Converts have done in New England? and also we Charge him and the
New-England-Priests, to show us a Scripture, wherever Christ and his Apostles
did command to WHIP, HANG, BVRN with a Hot Iron, CVT OFF EARS, BANISH on PAIN
OF DEATH, SPOIL GOODS of the people of God, Lay GREAT FINES upon Masters of
Ships, and such, that received the people of God, as the NEW ENGLAND Priests
and Professors have done, which are R. W.'s Converts, Living Stones, Actual
Believers, True Disciples? And now, is not here the Mark of the BEAST, and the
WHORE, because God's people would not drink their Cup, and because they would
not receive the Beast's Mark, they in that RED DRAGON'S power have made this
War against them.

And these are NEW ENGLAND's CONVERTS and BELIEVERS! And these are them R. W.
says, That can give an Account of the Grace of God, that has appeared unto
them, and wrought that Heavenly Change in them: And if this be R. W.'s HEAVENLY
CHANGE of the New-England-Church, as he calls it, and in his Account, with
all these Devilish, Wicked Fruits of the Old Man, and Carnal Weapons in Cain's
Spirit, and Judas with his Sword and Staves against Christ's Followers, which
has been a Shame to Christianity, and a Dishonor to the Name of Christ, and a
Scandal to Religion, yea, the very Profession of the Name of Christ; and have
Caused his Name to be Blasphemed among the Heathen: Yea, the Turks, Jews, and
Papists and Indians may HISS AT THEM, as many have done already. And we do say,
That they know not themselves, what Spirit they are of; for Christ came not to
destroy Men's Lives, but to save them: and he Rebuked such, that would have had
Men's Lives destroyed. So it is Clear, you that have Destroyed Men's Lives, are
not of God, but of the Devil: for does not he Destroy Men's Lives? and does not
the Devil signify a Destroyer? And so it is Clear, that you have not the Mind of
Christ, nor his Spirit; and so None of his: for his Spirit and Mind leads
into no such Actions or Practices; but to Love one another, and to Love
Enemies, as he commands. And if this be a HEAVENLY CHANGE in R. W.'s Account,
then we must needs judge him Blind, and knows not, what the True Heavenly
Change is, nor True Converts, nor Fundamental Principles, nor True Disciples
and Believers: and therefore no wonder, though he has Judged us, as he has
done in his Book; who calls Darkness and its Works Light, and Light Darkness.

R. W. And thou say; There is a Time of Purity and Primitive Sincerity, a
Time of Transgression and Apostasy, a Time of Coming out of Babilon's Apostasy,
etc; a Time of many Flocks pretending to be Christ's, and saying, Lo here, and
Lo there, etc. a Time when Christ Jesus his Doves cry, etc. and when thou have
gone on by way of Preaching, thou say, Thou do not know, that there was
made any Reply to this by thy Opposites --.

Answ. Roger, this was beside the Matter: Thou should prove the Charges. We
did not come there to hear thee Preaching; but to Prove thy False Charges: but
when thou could not, thou fell a- Preaching to us. And well might W.
Edmundson and J. Stubs tell thee, Thou had spent so much time, and say, They
had other Business in hand, than to Attend upon thy False Charges, when thou
should have made them good, and fell a- Preaching to them (as in page 66.)

R. W. And thou say; Thou used'st all possible Brevity, [but the Reader may
see, how thou wentst beside the Matter in thy Preaching:] and thou say; I
rather chose thus to Apologize for my self, p. 67.
than downright to blame them, on whom (they saw well enough) I laid the Blame
of our Long Proceeding.

Answ. Surely Roger, if thy Heart were not hardened, thou durst not thus speak,
as to Lay the Blame upon us of our Long Proceeding; when as all the Sober
People, that was there at the Dispute, know well, that our Long Proceeding was
upon the Occasion of thy Long, Impertinent Speaking, and not bringing that,
which was Material for the Proof of thy Positions. And since thou have taken
thy own Time now at Large to write further for the Proving of them, let Sober
People Judge, whether in all that thou have yet done, thou have Proved any of
thy False Charges? And so i^'s-Evident, that our Long Proceeding was upon no
other Occasion on our sides, than our Long, Patient Waiting upon thee to prove
thy Charges and False Accusations; which thou did not then, nor have not yet
done it.

R. W. And thou say; Thou spoke nothing, but the Eternal Truth of God: and
thou said; The Words I have spoken, shall Judge you at the Last Day; and
then thou did withdraw.

Answ. R. W. how dare thou take the Words of the Lord in thy Mouth, and speak
of the Eternal Truth of God with a Dark Spirit, and say, Thy Words shall Judge
us in the Last Day? when thou have uttered so many Lies and False Charges, and
make thy Lies and Slanders Equal with Christ's- Holy Words, and call'st his
Light a Fancy and an Idol? which will be thy Burden at Last, except thou do
Repent; which we fear, it will be Hid from thy Eyes. And any False Prophets or
Persecutors, or the D^vil may use the Words of Christ against his Children, the
Lambs of Christ, as thou have done here, and so Abuse and P^rvert the
Scriptures as to a wrong End, to which they were never spoken: but Alas Poor
Man! thy Words are nothing to us

R. W. Thou call W. E. Proud Mouth, because he called upon thee to make good
thy False Charges; for we had used Long Patience to hear thee, and we would not
endure any Long and Tedious Discourses.

Answ. And well we might say so, to hear thee tell a Tale of the Turk and the
Pope, as many times thou have done over and over in thy Book here to no
purpose, when thou should have Proved thy Charges. -- And thou say; Our
own Souls know, and the Auditory, that thou used'st to be Brief; When Our own
Souls know the Contrary: for W. E. might well tell thee of the Quarter of an
Hour at Providence, when thou forgottest thy self, and fel'st a Rambling and
Doting beside the Matter.

R. W. Thou say; Thou wast told at Providence, that thou knew, p. 68.
that we would not stand a Disputation; for if we did, we would not Continue
without great Advantage, etc. and break off Abruptly, as our Spirit hurried us.

Answ. Was not this thy own Condition R. W.? And we had Advantage enough upon
thee, for thou could make nothing good.

R. W. And thou say; Thou wast Queried at Newport by some, Why we did not
proceed on the First Day? and then thou say; That we do not Cordially own
that Day ( for the Quakers work upon it) but we wisely resolved to have the
whole First Day to make up the Breaches, stop Leaks, dress Wounds, that might
be in the foregoing Agitations against our Consciences and Credits. And, It is
doleful, that Men of Excellent Parts, and of Great Knowledge in the Scripture,
should yet so lie under the Sentence of Gospel-Justice, that they cannot but
Deceive, as they are Deceived; that they cannot but Believe Lies, and Tell
Lies, Horrible and Blasphemous Lies as Confidently, as the Purest Truths; and
suck-in, and pour-out the Poison of Dragons, the Great Red Dragon, the Father
of Lies, etc.

Answ. R. W. this thou might very well have kept at Home with the Red
Dragon, which rules in thee and the New-England-Priests and Professors, who
are under the Sentence of Gospel-Justice and Judgment; though thou may talk
of the Scripture. And thy Lies, thy Horrid, Blasphemous Lies, they did not (as
thou scoffingly say) make Leaks, neither make Breaches among us; but we are
confirmed in the Lord against them, knowing the Tree by its Fruits. And what
Quakers those are, that Work the First Day, thou have not named them: so this
is like the rest; and we shall not say much to it, till thou do name them.
But we Meet together on the First Day of the Week, as the Primitive Christians
did; and so bestow it better, than to Hear thy Lies and Blasphemies: any other
day would serve R. W. But we do not understand, that R. W. makes any
Conscience, or has such a Zeal either for God or that Day, as to Meet to
Worship God upon that Day: and who do thou Meet with? or have thou not driven
all People from thee with thy Dark Spirit? Thou call W. E. Braggadocia; thou
migh'st have kept that at home.

R. W. Tells a great story of his Brother sending a Letter to be read in the
Assembly -- And W. E. told thee, p. 69.
That we did not come to hear Papers read; but how thou could make out thy
false Charges.

Answ. It seems, both thy Brother and Thou were offended, because it was not.
And thou confessest thy self, thy Brother judged us as Insultors and
Dominerers; therefore we had little Reason to take Notice of his Letter, or
give any Credit to it. And we had Just Cause enough either for Hitchcock or
him, or any others (that came to ask Questions that Time in the Disputing with
thee, who had Challenged us and all the Comers) when we saw, they came to
make Inter-ruptions, to desire them to set their Hands to the Charges, and so
to have joined with thee, that we might have kept to the Matter in Hand; or if
they would not, it was Uncivil for them to make Inter-ruptions, when we had
thee to deal withal, for to hear thee prove thy false Positions and
Accusations. And if they had had the Civility and Patience, and stayed, till we
had done with thee; and then appeared like Men, they might have been Heard and
Answered in Season: but to come and make a Brabble, and ask strange Questions
beside the matter in Hand; This we do not count to be Civil, though ye may
count it so. But we knew, that thou would willingly accept of any to make a
Noise, for to ease thy self, and take thee off from proving thy false Charges.
And as for thy Brother, thy Religion and his is both Alike.

R. W. And thou tellest of a Paper containing the Sight of Sin, and the Sight
of the Lord Jesus; these two were the Two Daggers, which stab at the Heart of
their feigned Christ and Light within.

Answ. Here Roger has discovered himself and his Blasphemy in Denying the Lord
Jesus Christ and his Light: And often he brings the word STABBING,
manifesting his Evil Spirit. And the Feigned Christ thou might have kept at
home; for the Real Christ we own with the Light, that comes from him, by which
we see Sin and See our Savior, which saves from it.

R. W. And thou say, Thou art not of thy Brother's Conscience, that thou
ought to have Admonisht the Quakers, before thou had so publicly, p. 70.
etc. since they proclaimed their Sin as Sodom on the Housetop, etc. and so
go on in Railing and Slandering: and say further; Nor do I think I
charged them too deep or too sharply, etc. for I know, the Foxes and the Wolves
( the Able Leaders amongst them) do not run away with Pigs and Swine only; but
Lambs and Chickins of Christ are carried away in their Soul-bloody Jaws, etc.
and so fallest a-railing, etc. tellest of Blind Leaders and Chapmen, that by
feigned words make Merchandise upon men's Souls, 2 Pet. 2.

Answ. R. W. and his New-England-Priests might have kept a great part of this
at home. But is R. W. too high for the Command of Christ, First tell thy
Brother, etc? but what are these Sins, we proclaim as Sodom, and the Housetop,
that the Quakers hold? we do abhor his false Charges here, we own no such
things And whereas thou think, thou do not Charge us deep enough; thou
have, nor could not make good the things, thou have Charged us withal. And as
for Wolves, Soul-Bloody Jaws, Firebrarnds, blind Leaders, Foxes, Chap-men, that
by feigned words make Merchandise of men's Souls, (2 Pet. 2.) If there be any
such in the World, they be in New England, their Fruits have declared it.

And R. W.'s his Brother's Letter begins page 71. and ends page 75: which
R. W. highly extolleth, and says; This is the poor Letter Condemned Unheard,
etc. who like the Men of China Judge all the World to have no Eyes, p. 75.
except the Men of Europe, to whom they grant One Eye; and that is more, than
our Proud Pharisees will do to any, that bow not down to their Gross
Phylacte^ies.

Answ. These are thy scoffing words: but R. W. is Judging the Chinaes as well
as us. And it is false to say, we Condemned the Letter Unheard: but we count, It
was not Time for thee to bring-in the Letter; but to make good thy false
Charges. For thy Brother was a Party: though he would not subscribe to thy
false Charges; yet would busy himself, and make himself concerned. But its
like, thou may Charge the Chinaes falsely, as thou have done us: for thou art
full of such Tales and Stories. And many times, when thou should have proved
the matter, thou tell us of Papists, Arminians, etc. and truly, thy
Brother's Letter is not worth the taking Notice of.

Rob. W. He says; I write not to Charge nor to Admonish, etc. ( p. 71.) and
thou say, Thou would not have us to take it as a Charge; and then say,
That we never dealt Faithfully (page 72.) [Now let the Reader Judge, whether
this is not a High Charge and a Judgment too.] And 2ly say, That we assumed
and presumed beyond the bounds of Moderation and Christianity; [yet we must not
take these as Charges:] and further say; Our Expressions and Behaviors in
our Actings were not for Edification of the Auditors, but Advancing of self;
and that we limited the Holy One of Israel: we break the Apostolical Command;
we dealt not Faithfully and Christian- like: ( page 73.) [And if these be not
Charges, let the Moderate Judge.]

Answ. And should we suffer any to speak, and make a Confusion and Cavil
(except they would Join with thy Brother in the Matter) and yet would not own
the thing; but only Speak to Interrupt, and to Put by, and to Bring-in New
Matter, taking up only Time, and to hinder the Matter in hand? For thou would
make us believe, that thou Vnderstood'st the Order in Courts of Judicature
(page 73.) in Temporal Matters: but where, and in what Court are such things
allowed, that when a Man has a Cause or Complaint against another, that many
are suffered to Oppose, yet will not to join with the Complainant? will not the
Court look upon such, as being Disorderly and Busy-Bodies, and cry, SILENCE IN
THE COURT? And though it was proffered fair to you, or to any, that if they
would have owned and joined with him in all or any of the Positions, we offered
them Liberty to speak, what they would. Which is Clear, that you manifest your
selves as Disturbers, who would not own or speak to the Matter in Hand: For
it is known, that several there did speak to bring in other things beside the
Matter; as R. Hitchcock, and many others. And was not R. Hichcock Answered
fully in Season? and so might thou have been, if thou had^t had Patience,
and appeared in the Meeting to have spoken in Season, when we had done with thy
Brother.

Robt. W. And thou tellest us a Story of a Man's Wife being big with Child,
which came with him to the Archbishop, and he gave her Liberty to speak to the
full: [What is this to the purpose? for did not she speak to her Husband's
Concern? So if thou would have taken thy Brother's Concern, thou might
have spoken too.] But thou say, It appeared to thee, that thy Brother had
assumed and presumed too much, being so large and high Proposals.

Answ. And if this was the Ground, why thou could not join with thy Brother;
then thou might have had so much Moderation and Patience, and waited, till
we had done with him; then thou might have been Answered, and Drunk of Our
Common Wine Press freely, which is open to all. But thou wast so great with
Child, (but not of the Man Christ Jesus) to bring forth these false Charges
(which thou would not have us to take as Charges) wherein thou did abuse
both our Liberty and thy own, in not having the Patience, till we had done with
thy Brother: and then we might have Answered thee, if thou had appeared, and
demanded it. For what need we a Letter from a Man, that was there present, that
had Opportunity to speak? And as for True Liberty infringed, and Insulting
Spirit of the Quakers, Truly, thou and thy Brother might have kept this at
home; who went about not only to Insult over us, but with his false Positions
and Charges to put us in his Bear-Skin, that the Dogs of New England might have
worried us.

Rob. W. And because thou say, Your Indecorum Behaviors both in words and
gestures unto your Elder Fellow Servants and Aged Father, complaining, as not
performing your Duty, as Young Men according unto Rule of honoring Gray Hairs,
etc. saying often, Thou Old Man, thou Old Man, thereby to provoke to passion,
(page 74.)

Answ. Is not Wisdom called Gray Hairs? wherein did we break the Rule? And what
was our Indecorum-Behaviours, Words and Gestures? and where did we Not perform
our Duty? did we not suffer him patiently, and bear him, till he went quite
beside the Matter, and spent Two Days with Two Positions, and did not prove
them neither? hearing his long Tales and Stories to no purpose? And pray thee,
read thy Brother's Book and see, what Names and Evil Language he gives us?
whether he be a Good Example to Young Men and us? where thy Brother writes to
J. T. (page 6.) calling him his Ancient, Loving Friend (an Old Man at
Providence;) and ( page 15.) he calls his Ancient, Loving Friend (to wit, J.
T.) WHITE DEVIL: and thou art offended at us here, because we call him OLD MAN,
thereby appearing to provoke to Passion. And so, if these be not Charges (which
thou would not have them to be so) let the Sober judge! which thou wast with
Child to bring forth. -- But as to our saying OLD MAN to thy Brother, it was
not in Dis-respect to his Person, nor to set at Naught his Old Age (for we have
learned better;) but it was a True Title to him, and not Dishonorable, nor by
us given in Derision, though thou and thy Brother take it so; who has it in
his Book, and tells the World of it, and wrongeth us. -- And thou do Extol
His exceeding Great Patience; but wrong'st us in Charging us with seeking to
take an Advantage against the Aged, and say; Contrary to Covenant, by Three
or Four baiting him at once, etc. This is another false Charge: but let the
Vnprejudic'd then there judge! -- And as for Charging thy Brother with
Blasphemy, and for him to prove it; Let the Ingenuous Reader but read over his
Book and see, whether he has not manifest a Great Deal more of Blasphemy and
not proved that, which we Charged him withal, nor his own Charge.

R. W. Whereas thou say; It is acknowledged by Auditors, that as the
Complainant brought substantial Proof (so far as he proceeded) so you the
Defendants also brought substantial Defense, etc. but (thou say) who shall
judge? you will not suffer the Gospel-Rule, that the Standers-by the Spirits of
the Prophets shall Judge, etc.

Answ. This is not True, and a False Charge, though thou would not have us
take it so: for we did refer over and over (the People knows) the matter to
the Judgment of the People there, And is it not a Contradiction, that thou
say; The Complainant brought substantial Proof (so far as he proceeded) and
that the Defendants also brough^ substantial Defense, (in what was substantial?)
that were the Standers-by to Judge, Whether he had proved his false Charges?
And many more Charges there are, which thou would not have us to take as
Charges, in thy Paper, which indeed is not Worthy to be taken Notice of: but
let the Vn-prejudic'd people in Rode-Island, that was there, Judge, whether
thou have not wronged us! And did not a stranger speak aloud there, and said; I
am no Quaker; yet I see, that Mr. Williams has rather proved against himself,
and not for himself?

R. W. And does not R. W. say; The Spirits of Just Men made Perfect ( the
Quakers say, p. 76.
Here; and we say, In the Life to come?)

Answ. And does not the Apostle say (to the Heb.) YE ARE COME to the Spirits of
Just Men? and was it not HERE, while they were upon the Earth? And Isa. 11. 1
These. 2. Romans 8. and Act. 8, 19.10.14.16. what are all these Scriptures? who
denies them? And Gal. 5. Joh. 3. what is all this to the Purpose? for here thou
go on in way of Preaching: And all these Scriptures do not prove thy false
Chorge. For thou say;

R. W. The Holy Spirit of God was given forth by Means; but the Quakers pretend
in G. F.'s Book and other Books, That their Spirit was without Means. p. 77.
And thou bring, The Lord opened Lydia's heart, etc. and Christ's Breathing
upon his Apostles, etc.

Answ. Did not the Apostles receive the Holy Ghost by his Breath? and what! was
that Mediate? and were not the Apostles Able Ministers of the Spirit? and was
that Mediate? And that, which Opened Lydia's Heart, was that Mediate? And did
not Peter Preach Christ Jesus and his Light; and the Holy Ghost fell upon them?
and was not the Light of Christ within them, that received it? And was that
Mediate or Immediate, that bid Cornelius send to Joppa? And what was that, when
the Apostle (which was a Minister of the Spirit) was Preaching Christ Jesus?
was it not something within them, that answered to the Apostle's Preaching,
(that pricked the Heart) that made them cry out, What they should do? was not
this the Light Within, that lets them see, that they had Done Evil? according
to the Apostle's words, Whatsoever does reprove and make manifest, is Light:
and if they turn at the Reproof, this is Repentance? And what was that, that
Saul Kikt against, when he was a Professor (like R. W. and the
New-England-Priests and Professors) and Persecuted God's people? and is not R.
W. and all his New England Persecuting Priests and Professors kicking against
it now? and therefore they will not receive Christ Jesus. But we never denied
the Means of the Spirit of God to work withal; but your Means, which are
without the Immediate Spirit of God, and the Light of Christ Jesus, which thou
Blasphemously call an Idol. And go about to prove, that the Spirit of
Christ is not the Spirit of Christ, which Leads us, and Mortisieth us, and
Circumciseth; in which we Worship the Living God, as Christ commands: and
this Spirit thou go about to prove a False Spirit; which will prove thy own
Destruction, if thou repentest not. And so our Assertions are no Contradictions
to the Spirit of God; they are thy own.

R. W. And thou bringst (page 6. in G. F.'s folio) Samuel Eaton's Saying [ The
Prophets and Apostles drew people to an Outward Word.] G. F.'s Answ. [Now, is
that which Lives and Endures for Ever, p. 78.
Outward? Did they not bring them to Christ and the Power of God, which is the
End of Words, which is Immediate?] -- And in the same page Samuel Eaton [ Is
not the Gospel an External Way?] G. F. Answ. [No: The Gospel is a Living Way,
which is revealed within; and is the Power of God to Salvation. -- And in the
same page: S. E. [ Are not these seduced, who are drawn off from the External
Means, by which the Spirit is given, and Faith wrought to wait for the
Receiving of the Spirit without any Word to convey it to them? [he means,
External] which Spirit when they have, it is not the Spirit of Truth, but of
Delusion.] G. F. Answ. [The Spirit and Faith is not conveyed to any Man
without the Word (to wit, Christ) and they are seduced, which rest in the
External, from the Eternal. And the Spirit is not given by External Means; it
is God and Christ, that gives it: Neither is Faith wrought by External Means.]
R. W. Replieth: I Observe, how the Wisdom of men is Enmity against God, and how
witty this Fox is, to catch himself and others in the Traps of Eternal Howling:
how does he here confound the Audible Words or Preachings of God's Mercy in
Christ Jesus with the Inaudible, Invisible, Mystical and Metaphorical Word
Christ Jesus himself. 2ly Who sees not his gross and impudent Denying of the
Spirit, and Faith to be conveyed by Means from God unto us?

Answ. Let the Reader see R. W.'s Reply here, if there be any thing in it to
prove, That we have not the Spirit; and, That the Spirit, by which we are
acted, is not the Spirit of God? And what must we infer from R. W.'s words
here, and S. Eaton, R. W.'s Third False Charge.
the Priest? That the Spirit is given by External Means? and, That the Faith is
wrought by External Means? and The Gospel, the Power of God, is an External
Way? and That the Apostle directed people to an Outward Word, and not to God
and Christ the Eternal Word, the Word that lives, and abides and endures for
ever? but then how is God the Giver of the Spirit? and how is Christ the Author
and Finisher of their Faith? And how is the Gospel (the Power of God, which was
Revealed to the Apostles) an External Way? and does any know the Gospel, the
Power of God, but by Revelation? And was it not the Wisdom of Man, which was
Enmity against God, that with-stood the Preaching of the Revealed Faith and
Gospel, and called it foolishness then, and now? And as for Traps and Eternal
Howling, Gross Impudency, etc. R. W. might have applied and kept at home.

R. W. Brings Enoch Howet, ( G. F. Fol. 15) saying: [ There is nothing in Man
to be Ministered unto, but Man.] G. F. Answ. [How then Ministered the Apostles to
the Spirit, or sowed as to that? and Christ Spoke to the Spirits in prison. And
Timothy was to stir up the Gift, that was in him: and, the Spirit of the Father
speaks within them; and the Light, that shines in the heart, and gives
Knowledge, etc. And, The Son of God is Revealed in me, says the Apostle, Here
the Scriptures are for Correction of thee, and Reproof of thee, who say,
There is nothing to speak to in Man, but Man -- When the Apostle says, That
which may be known of God, is manifest in Man, for God has shown it to them,
(Romans 1.) And the Apostle was manifest to Every Man's Conscience in the sight
of God: and that was of God, which the Children disobeyed.] And R. W. replieth,
saying: I was forced to omit the Allegations out of G. F.'s Book then by me and
ready: [And why so, R. W? Why could not thou have let the people heard them
and judged them?] And again he replieth: As in his late Book Exalting his
Heathen-Light above the Scriptures (and say) he simply and profanely joins
the Philistian Priests and Egyptian Conjurers with Holy Job and his Friends,
page 79.
etc. so here he confounds and jumbles together the Natural Powers and
Faculties, and Humane Light in all Mankind with the Grace of God, etc.

Answ. These Charges are all false; and G. F'.s Book will clear it self: for
his Book proves, That Men have the Light, that have not the Scripture; and
that some reject the Spirit of God and his Light, which have the Scripture. And
it is plain, that Job had the Light and Spirit of God. that had not the
Scripture: and so it was G. F'.s Proof, That Men may have the Spirit of God,
which have not the Scripture. And the Priests would make us believe, That the
Light, Faith and Spirit of God come from the Scripture and External Means; but
Christ the Light (who enlightneth every Man, that comes into the World, which
is called the Life in the Word, Joh. 1.) thou and the New-England-Priests and
Professors have not proved this a Humane Light: and so, it is thou, that have
Jumbled all together here, Conjurers, Philistians, etc. and not G. F. And as
for Simply and Profanely Jumbling, thou may keep it to thy self.

R. W. says; His Scope is (Abominably and Horribly!) to make the Holy Spirit
of God capable of being Preached unto, to be Converted and Turned unto God,
yea, to Refuse and be Damned; for it is not Man (he says) that is Preached
unto.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if G. F. says so, That it is not a Man, that is
Preached unto. And as for thy Abominably and Horribly, thou may keep to thy
self: for G. F. does not say, The Spirit of God must be Converted and Turned to
God, or else Refuse and be Damned; These are thy own Abominable Words: but, The
Ministers of the Spirit Sow to the Spirit, etc. and, The Spirit was in Man,
which Men and Women must take heed unto. And do not the Prophets and Apostles
tell People, how they have Erred from the Spirit, and Quenched and Vexed it,
and Grieved it and Rebelled against it, and Resisted the Holy Ghost? (read
Nehem. 9. Act. 7.) and they that Rebel against it and Quench it, and Vex and
Resist the Spirit of God, they go from God, from that, that would Convert them
then, into Damnation, and not the Spirit of God, as thou Blasphemously say.
And so, it is the Spirit of God, that Converteth Man, them that walk in it: and
R. W. this is thy Sottish Paraphrazing of G. F.'s Words.

R. W. says; How Sottish and Blind does this Deceiver proclaim himself in the
Christian Doctrines of Preaching, Conversion, Faith, and the Grace and Spirit
of God, confounding Gold and Dross, Pearls and Pebbles, Harps and Harrows (as
all one) together.

Answ. R. W. This is thy own Sottish and Blind Condition, that call the
Light of Christ (which lights every Man, that comes into the World) an Idol:
and how can thou See without it, but art Blinded altogether? And let the
Reader read G. F.'s Answer and R. W.'s Reply, and see, if there be any such
thing (as he Blindly asserteth here) in his Words, that G. F. proclaims, as
R. W. says? for none of us can Preach the Doctrine of Christ, Conversion,
Faith, Grace and Spirit truly without the Light, that shines in the Heart, and
gives the Knowledge of them.

R. W. He brings ( G. F.'s Fol. p. 136, 137.) Thomas Moor saying; [ Nor are
we to wait for a further Revelation to us to be given forth, than the
Scriptures: for the Word of God came not first Immediately to the Gentiles, but
to the Apostles.] G. F. Answ. The Apostles, that Preached the Word of God, it
was Immediate, to whom-so-ever they Preached it; for they Received it
Immediately:[and R. W. puts, READ it Immediately, and cries, Nonsense:]
for the Word it self is Immediate; for it is the Savor of Death to Death, and
of Life to Life. And none knows the Scriptures, but by the Spirit, that does
Reveal them: so all that witness the Spirit of God, witness Revelation, and the
Revealing of the Scriptures to them by it, and the things of God laid up for
them, that love God; which the Eye has not seen: but the Eyes may see the
Scriptures outwardly. And, None knows the Son of God, but the Father, neither
knows any Man the Father, but the Son, and He, to whom the Son Reveals him:
And so People may have the Scriptures, but not the Revelation of the Son of God
by them. For the Pharisees had the Scriptures, but not the Holy Thing they
testified of [to wit, CHRIST) who hated the Light, like R. W.] Most of this R.
W. has left out; and endeavors (but to no purpose) to prove, That We have
not the Spirit of God: But the Reader may see, how we are maintaining of it
against him and the Priests, that deny it in God's People. And it is the Work
of R. W. instead of Proving, That we have not the Spirit of God, To oppose it
in his People. -- But R. W. says in his Reply; As if all, that Receive G. F.
his Book simply pretended to be from the Spirit of God* Received it without G.
F. his Brain, and Hand and Pen or Paper* etc. Or, because a King delivers his
Mind to his Secretary, and commands him to pen it in a Proclamation, etc.
therefore the King'^ Word or Will comes to every Man immediately without any
such Means, as the Secretary's Composing, his Clark's Transcribing, the Use of
Printing, Letters, etc. to talk after this sort, what is it, but to talk
Frantic and Bedlam, and without the Guidance of a Common, Rational Spirit.

Answ This R. W. brings to prove, That We have not (...) Spirit of God: which
is quite Contrary. For he knows him^self (and the New England Priests, as
Dark as they are) That the King's Declaration or Proclamation ( which his
Secretaries writ^ and send to all his Subjects) Natural Men may understand; b^^
the Proclamation or Declaration of God and Christ Natural Me^ cannot perceive,
but by the Spirit of God. For the Apostle telle^^ them, They do not know him:
and the Pharisees, and such as Crucified him, it is said, They did not know
him, the LORD of LIFE, which has Sent out his Declarations by his Apostles.
Yea, many of the Apostles could not understand some of his Declarations in
their Young Days, till Christ opened their Understandings: and they, that did
Receive, what Christ declared, Received Him. -- And as for thy Scoffs, that
say; G. F.'s Book received without his Brains, etc. this is thy own Frantic
Bedlam-Stuff; thou may keep it at Home.

R. W. Brings Sam. Eaton (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 5.) saying; [ Though all the
Saints have the Spirit of Christ dwelling in them, which is Eternal and
Infallible; p. 80.
yet that this Spirit should do all, which Saints do, and should say all, that
Saints say, and should judge for them both Persons and Things after an
Infallible Manner; and that they should neither Say nor Do any thing by any
Understanding of their own, but the Spirit, All this we deny.] G. F. Answ.
[Which is Contrary to the Apostle, who says; As many as are the Sons of God,
are led by the Spirit of God. And Christ says; That he Acts all in them and
for them, who says; Without me ye can DO NOTHING: and, The Fruits of the
Spirit, etc. and, The Spiritual Man judges all things. And that is it, which
leads the Saints to divide and discern all things both Temporal and
Spiritual: the Spiritual Wisdom of God, which gives them Spiritual
Understanding, which Men must Rule withal; but not with their own, which comes
to naught. And ye, which have not that, which is Infallible to Judge in you,
know not the Spirit of Christ; neither can ye Judge of Persons or Things, that
have not the Infallible Judgment, nor have the Spiritual Man (to wit,
Infallibly.) Neither have ye the Word of God in your Hearts, nor Christ, which
is Eternal and Infallible: All which the Quakers have to Judge Persons and
Things.] But R. W. has le^t out many of the Priest's Words; as follows. He
says; [ That which is within them, is not Eternal or Infallible.] When the
Quakers asked him, Whether it was so or no? he said; [ Nay, that which Judges
in them, is not Eternal and Infallible: (and) They Ass^rt no such thing as
that, concerning Themselves.] So let the Reader see, how this Priest
Contradicts himself. And further this Priest says; [ There is an Immediate
Voice, which we never heard; which is Within:] this R. W. leaves out. And he
says; [ The Gospel is the Letter:] this he leaves out, ( Fol. p. 4.) The
Priest says; [ Though we believe, that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the
Saints; yet we assert, That the Spirit of Christ be distinct from the Saints (
Fol. p. 1.) These Contradictions R. W. never medleth withal. And S. E. says; [
Such a Voice, which comes Immediately from Heaven, we have not Heard: and such
an Inspiration, as this from God, we have not Received, nor do we wait for it,
Fol. p. 3.] Now, how can these Men have the Spirit of God then, which R. W.
striveth to maintain their Doctrine against G. F? and instead of proving, That
We have not the Spirit of God, he proves himself and his Priests without it,
that he seeks to Defend. -- But R. W. Replieth, and begins with Railings:
Mahomet, etc. and runs on and says; These Foolish and Filthy Dreamers, etc.
[And are these the Fruits from the Spirit of God?] and tells us a great Story,
Preaching upon what Mahomet says, and of Masters of Ships and Navigation, and
Families, and Princes and Governors, etc.

Answ. What is all this to the Spiritual Man, that Judges all Things? and to
prove, That We have not the Spirit of God? And the Saints are led by the Spirit
of God to Divide and Discern all things about both Temporal and Spiritual: and
the Spiritual Wisdom of God, which gives them an Understanding, which Men must
Rule withal, that be in it; Does G. F. therefore say, That Natural Men do
nothing with those Spirits? And because Natural Men do something with these
Spirits, must therefore the Spiritual Man, that Judges all things, be denied
the Immediate and Infallible Spirit of God to Judge of Persons and Things? For,
was not the World made by the Word and Wisdom of God, yea, all the Natural
Things or Temporal? and I ask R. W. and his New-England-priests, Whether they
can know them without the Wisdom of God? or Judge truly of their own Persons
both Before the Fall, and In the Fall, and in the Restoration After the Fall
without the Infallible Spirit of God? And does not Christ make All things New?

R. W. And whereas thou speak of the Meanest Youth or Wench of the Quakers,
if but a pretended Quaker, what-soever they say or do, is by an Infallible,
Eternal Spirit, etc. but how horribly their Spirits, p. 81.
etc. Miscarriages (in many Sinful Practices) and Apostacies, etc. and so going
on arailing.

Answ. These Fruits show some of thy bad Spirit. Does G. F. speak of Lads and
Lasses, that run into Miscarriages, and Sinful Practices and Apostacies, to
favor those their Ill Actions with the Infallible, Eternal Spirit of God? Nay,
this is thy own Lie R. W. thou may take it thy self; for all such Evil,
Sinful Actions both in our selves and others we deny, as being erred from the
Spirit of God: the Spiritual Man Judges all such things. And did not John
Stubs say well; Ye have an Unction, and need not, that any Man teach you; ye
KNOW ALL THINGS?

R. W. And then R. W. replieth, and tells of a Leading of a Beast by a
Halter, and the Leading of Man with Reason.

Answ. But what is this to the Leading by the Spirit of God and Unction? that
is beyond thy Dark Reason, and Judgment and Doting Spirit. And with thy dark
Reason thou can not Judge of false Prophets and Seducers, but receive them:
it is the Spirit of God and the Anointing, that must Judge of such things. And
what is all thy Preaching good for?

R. W. [Now he can not prove, That we have not the Spirit of God, he falls of
asking Questions, and saith] Whether this Leading, or Anointing or Teaching of
the Spirit be by means of Praying, Preaching, Reading, etc.

Answ. The Spirit is the Means of the true Prayer and true Preaching, and opens
to Man, what he Reads: as the Spirit of God opened the Scriptures to the
Eunuch through Philip. And the Apostle says, The Spirit helps our
Infirmities.

R. W. And thou say; If Motions without the use of these be pretended,
Reason tells us, that a Rational Soul must be able to Try, whether the Spirit
pretending be true or a lying Spirit? and that it must have some Rule or
Touchstone, etc. Thou further say, That the Rule must be thy own Reason, or
some Testimony of Unquestionable Witnesses satisfying my Reason; or some
Heavenly-Inspired Scripture or Writing, which my Reason tells me, came from
God. Reason also tells each Rational Creature, that it is very Suspicious to be
a false, lying and Devilish Motion, which slights the Holy Scripture, etc.

Answ. Here thou have made thy Reason both Rule and Judge to judge both Rule
and Touchstone, and to Try them: and have not thou said, The Scripture was the
Rule and Touchstone? -- And do thou not Admire the Devil for his great Wit
and Reason? ( Append. p. 108.) and was that Reason in the Devil, that tempted
Christ to Worship him and to Destroy himself, or Unreasonable (seeing thou
Admirest the Devil's great Reason, and say, Reason must be Judge; and make
no Distinction betwixt thine and the Devil's?) And had not the Pharisees and
Chief-Priests so much Reason as thou, and yet judged Christ to be Beel zebub,
and said, By the Prince of Devils he casts out Devils? And the Apostle tells
thee, That the Natural Man does not perceive the things of God: And had not
Pilate so much Reason, as thou (think thou) who asked Christ, Wha^ was
Truth? And if the Holy Scripture was the Means, the Rule and Judge to try
Motions, then Abel, En^ch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses had none. Now, an
Heavenly-Inspired Scripture (which thou speak of) that is by the Spirit, by
which they are known again; and not by the dark Spirit and Reason (for No Man
knows the Things of God, but by the Spirit of God,) which Reason thou here
set above both the Spirit that Inspireth, and the Scripture Inspired or
given forth by it: and so have made the Reason the Chief Judge; which the
Apostle did not, but the Spirit.

R. W. Thou say: It is best to take James's Counsel; If any Man want Wisdom,
let him ask of God, etc. If so, then Reason tells us, that except we suffer our
selves to be led ^s Beasts by Satan as the poor Quakers are) we must come to
the Use of Means, p. 82.
or a Mediate Leading and Teaching: and then what is become of these Hellish
Fancies of only Immediate Teachings and Inspirations.

Answ. This is R. W.'s Proof to prove, That we have not the Spirit of God. And
R. W. calls the Immediate Teachings and Inspirations (of God) Hellish
Fancies: Now, would not he have dotingly said this to the Apostles, had he been
in their Days? -- And so, what must we understand from R. W.'s words? He and
his New England- Priests must come to REASON, and a Mediate Leading and
Teaching, etc. and to Mediate Means: So, it must not be the Inspiration and the
Immediate Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, to Lead into all Truth. So, his
Leading is Mediate, his Means are Mediate, and his Teaching is Mediate, and not
Immediate; and yet he must Ask Counsel and Wisdom (as James did) from God, and
yet it must not be Immediate and Inspired into him, but Mediate. -- And if Evil
Spirits have such a Great Reason (as R. W. says, Append. p. 108.) and he
Admireth them so; and Reason tells R. W. that except we suffer our selves to
be led as Beasts by Satan, etc. and yet, Evil Spirits have great Reason: and
let the Reader see, what Distinction thou have made between Satan's Reason, and
thy own and the New-England-Priests, and who is thy Leader? -- And as for the
Poor Quakers, the Light and Spirit of God, which proceeds from the Father and
Son, is their Comforter, and will lead them into all Truth. And so Hellish
Fa^cy thou may apply at home, who fightest against God's Immediate Teaching
and Inspiration. And what do thou talk of the Spirit of Wisdom or Knowledge;
and talkest of Reason, that must be Judge? ( Isa. 11. Luke 11.) And as for
Dreamers, thou may keep to thy self. And R. W. I must tell thee, None know
the Scriptures and the Mysteries of Christ by their own Spirits, nor their dark
Reason, but by the Spirit of God.

R. W. And thou say; The Scripture in John [Ye know all things] we expounded
Literally, etc. and say; Then why are not the Quakers Omnipotent and
Almighty, as well as Omniscient or knowing all things?

Answ. Why does R. W. take James's words Literally, and not John's? As for
Omnipotent and Almighty, and Omniscient or knowing all things as God, the
Quakers hold no such thing, and there is no such saying in G. F's Answer. Yet
the Saints know all things concerning their Salvation and Election, and
concerning the Devil and his Angels, that will deceive them: and they knew knew
all things so, that no man needed to teach them; and they knew God and Christ:
and J. Stubs's words will stand. And did we speak no more to thee, but the four
Lines thou set in page 83? Why could not thou put down our Words? page
83.
And why can thou not take John's words Literally, as thou take James's,
who says: The Light, which Lights every Man, that comes into the World;
which is Life in the Word, etc. which Light thou Blasphemously call an Idol?

R. W. And thou say; I desire to know, what is meant by the Word WITHIN?

Answ. That which Paul preached (Romans ^0.) which is as a Fire, and hammereth
down Sin and Evil, sharper then a Two-edged Sword; which was the Word of Faith,
which he preached* and we. And thou come to learn of us, What is meant by the
Word Within? It opens the Understanding; it opens the Eye of the Soul, and
changes the Affections, where it is lo^ed and done, as James tells thee: but
if thou be a Sayer of the Word, and Do it not, thou deceivest thy own Soul.
And how now R. W! is this thy Proving, That we have not the Spirit of God, To
come and learn of us, What is the Word of God within? this is quite beside the
Matter: and well might W. Edmundson call thee back again, when thou wast
Rambling on beside the Matter.

R. W. Now thou say, It is said, that God has shined in our hearts.

Answ. But thou do not speak, as the Apostle does, who says; God, who
commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, has shined in our hearts to give
the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus (2
Cor. 4, 6.) Now, what must we understand from R. W.'s means or meanings here
from the Scripture? That God shines in the Heart to give the Knowledge of God?
if we had said so, would not he have cried out, Blasphemy? and God commanded
God to shine out of Darkness? O! R. W. take heed of such dark means!

R. W. And then thou contradictest thy self, and say, -- The Seat of the
Light and Knowledge of God, etc. Further thou say; Though Fox makes it (the
Light) to be Natural, and born with every Man, etc. and go on a- railing,
call it Their Natural Hellish Darkness: and upon this thou make false
Conclusions upon thy own Invented Words (which G. F. has not spoken.)

Answ. Let the Reader see, if G. F. any where has made the Heavenly Light of
Christ Natural? etc. John, the greatest Prophet born of a Woman makes not the
Light Natural, that came for a Witness to be a Witness of the true Life in the
Word, which was the Light, that Lights every Man, that comes into the World.
For R. W. may read such as he is, of the same Spirit, saying, John has the
Devil: and such were not like to own the Light (no more then R. W.) which he
bore Witness of.

R. W. Thou say, That to hearken to, to turn to, to lissen to any Voice or
Motion within in Heavenly things in matters of Supernatural Light is as
proper, as in matters of Law to go for Counsel to a Cheating Thief or Rogue, in
matters of Health to a known, page 84.
Cheating Mountebank, as to turn within to a Man's Heart, which is the
Arrantest Jugler and Cheater in the World.

Answ. Why how now Roger! have thou not fulfilled W. Edm.'s Words here, who
said, Thou wast a Blasphemer? And is this the Proof to prove, That we have not
Spirit of God? and is R. W.'s heart such a Juggler and Cheat, as he compares
to the Thieves, Rogues and Mountebanks? But come R. W. Though Men's hearts are
wicked (as Genesis 6. etc. and dark and deceitful (as in Jer.) and (thou say)
as God is Light and no Darkness, so in them is Darkness, and no Light: so that
to hearken to any Voice, or to Lissen to any Voice or Motion within in Heavenly
things and matters of Supernatural Light is, as thou said before, etc. But
let us Consider; Is there no Light in R. W? nor in his New-England-Priests? nor
no Voice nor Motion in him or them in Heavenly things, in Matters of
Supernatural Light? then how can he judge us, That we are not in the Spirit of
God, and that our Spirit is not the Spirit of God, whereas he has no Savor of
it? and how can thou otherwise, but call the Light of Christ a Fancy and an
Idol, when thou have no Voice or Motion within in the Heavenly things in
Matters of Supernatural Light? But we tell R. W. that Christ has Enlightened
him, though his Darkness cannot comprehend it: and Christ has poured out his
Spirit upon all Flesh, though he quenches it and grieveth it; though he says,
There is no Motion in him, and so of others as he falsely judges. And did not
the Holy Men speak forth the Scriptures, as they were Moved by the Holy Ghost,
and was not that within them? and did not the Light shine in the hearts of the
Corinthians, to give them Knowledge, etc. and was not that Within them? And so,
thou have proved thy Spirit to be Satan's, and not the Holy Spirit of God,
which we are led by. And as for Jugglers, and Cheaters and Mountebank (thou
speak three times over in this page) thou might have kept at home, R. W.
And do not thou Contradict thy self, and say, That God has shined in our
Hearts; and no Voice nor Motion there (R. W.) to hearken or lissen to? and yet
God shines there to give Knowledge? etc.

R. W. Thou bring Isa. 59; That we own: but what is this to prove, That we
have not the Spirit of God, that proves, That the Word and Spirit of Christ
should be in the Mouth of his Seed, p. 85.
and in the Mouth of his Seeds Seed, which we are? that proves not, that we
have not the Spirit of God; who are true Believers, and call upon the Name of
the Lord. -- And

R. W. Thou further say, That G. F. should not say, that the Word and the
Spirit are all One (as Commonly he says) and, The Father and Son are One, etc.

Answ. For Christ says ( Joh. 16, 30.) I and my Father are One. Then the Jews
took up stones to stone Him for Blasphemy: and is not R. W. and the
New-England-Priests ready to stone us for holding forth Christ's Doctrine?
manifesting, that he has not the Spirit of Christ, which is offended at us,
that we say, Christ and his Father are One. We do not say, The Word, that
lives, and abides and endures for Ever, is the Scriptures; though the Word
owneth the Scriptures, which gave them forth in the Holy Men of God. And Christ
says himself, I and my Father are One: He does not say, I and my Father are
Two and Distinct,

R. W. For thou say, That we join not the Word and Holy Spirit together; but
tread upon the Word under a Cloak of Advancing the Spirit.

Answ. The Word is called the Sword of the Spirit; and how can they be divided?
we do not divide them. And the Word of God cannot be Trodden under Foot under a
Cloak of Advancing his Spirit; for the Word of God is as a Hammer, and a Fire
and a Sword: and thou and the New-England-Priests may as well Tread upon a Fire
and a Sword, as Tread upon the Word of God; though thou and you may Tread upon
the Scriptures. And therefore thou have manifest thy Ignorance and Dotishness
of the Word of God and his Spirit, and know not it, nor ours: neither art
thou like to try ours, that have no Motion in thee of Heavenly Things.

R. W, And thou Instancest, that we have not the Spirit of God, from our
Reviling, etc.

Answ. By the same Argument thou have proved thy self, that thou have not the
Spirit of God. But thou must not call Truth's Speaking Reviling: for when thou
speak Lies, we tell thee, who is the Father of them. We tell thee, when thou
call the Light of Christ Frantic Fancy and an Idol, we tell thee, it is
Darkness in thee; that is no Reviling: as Christ to the Pharisees said, They
were Blind; and cried Woe against them. Nor the Apostle did not Rail against
Elimas and Simon Magus. And as for Monks and Friars, and Oister Women thou
might have kept at home. -- And as for Priest Wiggan, the Woman's Words were
true upon him; whom God suddenly Cut off by an Eminent Hand. And our Going
Naked, and the Lord, who has moved some to Go Naked (a Figure of your
Nakedness) as he did Isaiah, this does not prove, That we have not the Spirit
of God: which has been fulfilled upon the Priests and Magistrates in England;
and has been fulfilled upon you in a Measure, and will be more.

R. W. And to prove our Spirit not to be the Spirit of God, he Charge us with
Irrationality and Vnruliness, which is Contrary to the Wisdom, Rationality, and
Order and Holiness of the Spirit of God: this (says he) is Apparent from their
Bitter and Frantic Reviling.

Answ. Now, Let all that read his Book, Consider, Whether this Argument, that
he has brought, To prove Our Spirit not to be the Spirit of God, he has not
sufficiently manifested His Spirit not to be the Spirit of God, by the
Irrationality and Vnruliness of it in his Apparent, Bitter Reviling, the like
scarce to be read of, Exceeding in words the Devilish Inquisitors, Monks and
Friars, etc. spattering out Diablo, Diablo, etc. (as he speaks of.)

R. W. Thou tellest us of a Dumb Spirit and Dumb Meetings; p. 86.
and then (3 lines after) thou Contradictest thy self, and say; Their
Monstrous Singing and Tuning. etc.

Answ. What R. Williams! Dumb Spirits and Dumb Meetings, and Sing too? this
proves thee in a Dotish Contradiction; and not, that we have not the Spirit of
God. For we are not like thee, that can Speak, when thou will; for we Speak
or Sing, as the Spirit of the Lord gives us Utterance. And thou have No Motion
of Heavenly Things in thy Heart, who can speak and write, when or what thou will, (as page 83.)

R. W. says: The Holy Spirit of God is subjecting it self to be tried,
commanding all Men to Search the Records, and commending the Bereans for
examining Paul's Preaching and Spirit by the Scriptures: etc. and this is the
True M^aning of -- The Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets, etc.

Answ. This does not prove, that we have not the Spirit of God; but that we
have it. For did not we show these Scriptures, and read them to thee and the
people? does not the people, that was there, know this? And R. W. is a-
searching the Scripture's meaning of -- The Spirits of the Prophets being
Subject to the Prophets: R. W. gives no Scripture for this to Search for. And
what Scripture had the Prophets, before Scripture was written, for to Search,
by which they might know their Subjection? and therefore he is a false Spirit,
according to his own Judgment. For, were not the Spirits of the Prophets
Subject to the Prophets, before Scripture was written? though we own all the
Scriptures given forth by the Spirit of the Lord. And if Searching the
Scriptures be the Meaning, The Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the
Prophets; Then Antichrist, Jews and such, as have a Form of Godliness, and
deny the Power, may Search the Scriptures without the Spirit of God. And then
that is R. W.'s True Meaning, The Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the
Prophets, when they are in the Spirit, like the Whore and Jezabel, like
New England, that DRINKS THE PROPHETS BLOOD. -- And

R. W. says, Hence it pleases God, to give Rules for the Trial and Discerning
between the True Spirit and the False, page 87.
1 John 3. and 4.

Answ. R. W. If thou look into the former Chapter, thou may there see, what
the Apostle directed the Saints to, upon the Occasion of them, that would
seduce them, which he says, is the ANOINTING, which was within them, by which
they were to Know all things: And so, if they were to Know all things by it,
they were to Try Spirits by it. Thou Cavil^st at G. F.'s words, and say, The
Quakers, if they knew all things, were Almighty: Prove by Scriptures, that the
Almighty God is THINGS, who is the Creator of ALL THINGS, and therefore
Incomprehensible. Yet we know, To know God and Jesus Christ, that he has sent,
is Eternal Life; and there is a Difference between Being God, and Knowing all
things, that he has made. And the Apostle says, We are of God; and he that
knows God, hears us: and, Hereby know we the Spirit of God, and the Spirit
of Error: and, Hereby know we, that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
has given us of his Spirit. (1 John 4.)

R. W. Thou say, We dare not come to the Light and Search: and comparest us
to a Thief, Galled Horse, Deb^ers, Jugglers, etc. Spirits escaping in a Mi^t
and by the help of dark Lanthorns --. and so go on a-railing.

Answ. Now, we can leave this to the Judgment of the people in Rode-Island,
how often we have called for Scripture! and called for Scripture from thee to
prove thy false Ass^rtions. So that we were so far from Shunning to be Tried by
the Light and Scriptures, as thou have con^est several times in thy Book;
though now thou give thy self the Lie. So the Galled Horseback was thy self,
that could not endure the Robbing by the Scripture, nor Christ's Light neither.
And as for Juggling, and Thief and dark Lanthorn thou migh'st have applied at
home; for its thou, that wilt not come to the Light of Christ, that call it
an Idol. And

R. W. Thou say, Thou have been often visited by the Quakers, crying, Repent,
Repent, Hearken to the Light, etc. and call it a Cuckow's Note, etc.

Answ. What would R. W. have said to Christ and his Apostles, that preached
Repentance; and did they harden themselves against it, like R. W? and the
Apostles turning people from darkness to Light, were they not to Hearken to it?
or else what were they to turn them to? and this thou scoffingly call
Cuckow's Note: and this is no Proof, That we have not the Spirit of God. -- And
thou bring Muggleton's and Reeve's Cursings; But let R. W. and the Reader
and the New-England-Priests read in R. W.'s Book, and Appendix p. 119. and see,
if he be not found in Muggleton's Spirit in his Cursings, and worse Blasphemies
and false Judgment.

R. W. And thou bring W. Edmundson, who said; The Spirit of God was above
the Scriptures; and so not the Trier.

Answ. And what must we infer from this? Therefore the Quakers have not the
Spirit of God? no Proof. But R. W. What! is the Spirit of God under the
Scriptures? is not that above it, that gave them forth, and leads into all
Truth of them? And

R. W. Thou say, That W. Edm. said, Men will not come to the Light, left they
should be reproved, because their Deeds are evil: (and thou said,) This is
the true Cause of your quarreling against Scriptures, and of exalting the
Spirit above them.

Answ. This is false: For we do not quarrel against the Scriptures, nor W.
Edmundson, who uses Christ's words. And therefore ye are a Dark People, ye
New England Professors, that cannot use Christ's Words, but it must be counted
the True Cause of quarreling against Scriptures. -- And this is a false
Balance in thee, that thou call True, that say, We set up our own
Spirit, yea, the Spirit of Satan to be God, and Christ, and Spirit and all --
But R. W. this is thy own Spirit, and the New England priests, that will not
hear, nor come to the Light of Christ, lest it should reprove you: for if thou
did thou would tremble to speak these words. For we have known the
Reproofs of the Light, which gives the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of
God in the Face of Christ Jesus: And we do not set up our own Spirits above the
Scriptures.

R. W. Thy Fourth false Charge is, That the people called Quakers do not own
the Holy Scriptures -- And then thou tell a great Story of a Twofold Owning
the Scriptures, page 88.
etc. and say, The Jews and Papists did not more disown the Scriptures upon
the Account of the Pope's Traditions and Interpretations, than the Quakers did
upon the Account of their Light, page 89.
and Spirit and Interpretations also* And thou say, It Is true, the Quakers
in the Dispute professed to be tried by the Scriptures; which the First Quakers
among us wholly denied, but only by the Spirit within.

Answ. As for all his Stories of the Jews and Papists they may answer for
themselves. But what are the Quakers Interpretations of their Light and of the
Scriptures? why have thou not set them down? do thou find Fault with us,
because we take them Literally? (as in page 88.89) have thou so soon forgot thy
self, and tell us of Interpretations? And we own the Scriptures Truly and
Really in our hearts with the Spirit of God, that gave them forth: but we will
prove, that R. W. and the New England Professors do not Really own the
Scriptures, and that they are not in the Spirit of God, that gave them forth;
thy Unsavory Words, and calling Christ's Light a Fancy and an Idol, and
would have the Magistrates to punish us; and the Magistrates and Priests in
New England their Persecutions instead of Loving Enemies, and doing unto all
Men, as they would have them to do unto them, have declared it. So it is plainly
proved, that ye are neither in the Royal Law, nor in the Gospel; nor do not
Really own the Scriptures, that do not practice them. Love thy Neighbor, as
thy self: Love one another, Love Enemies, Are the Commands of Christ; but thou
call the Lord Christ Jesus his Light a Fancy and an Idol: and therefore thou
art not, nor can not be in his Spirit, that call his Light an Idol; and so
None of his, but a Ravening Woolf. -- And we always did own the Scriptures, and
have said, We and the Priests would be tried by the Scriptures; and to see,
which was in the Practice of Christ and his Apostles by the Fruits. And so we
are Faithful Witnesses for Christ and his Light, as John was; for we are Come
for Witnesses, and do bear a True Witness for Christ and his Light, which
enlighteth every Man, that comes in the World; which is the Light of the
World. -- And the Occasion, that we must speak this over and over, is, because
thou bring'st it so often.

R. W. And thou tell us of an Irish Papist, that flung the Bible in the
Kennel, and kicked it, saying, The Plague take this Book. [And what is this to
us? is it not a shame to print such Fruits of a Wicked Spirit over and over?
which we abhor.] And thou say, That John Burnyeat took a Bible, and r^ad
publicly, Luke 1. How the Scripture was a Declaration: and yet thou say
(and Contradictest thy self,) that we would not endure the searching of the
Scripture (as page 78. See his Margent.) And thou go on to no Purpose, page
90.
and say, Still they sied to this Borrow, The Spirit, that gave forth
Scripture, is greater than the Scripture.

Answ. Why R. W. and the New-England-Priests! is not the Spirit above the
Scripture? Cannot the Devil get Scripture, and the Wolves and Antichrist, but
can they get the Spirit of God? would ye have the Spirit less than the
Scriptures, which was before they were written, and gave them forth?

R. W. thou say, Thou maintainest the Inward Breathing of the Holy Spirit
more than we.

Answ. But where is it R. W? do not thou say ( page 83.) There is no Voice or
Motion within Man, that is to be hearkened unto, turned to or lissen'd to in
Heavenly and Supernatural Light? -- And

R. W. Thou say, We ought in all our Preaching, Hearing and Reading, etc.
beg the Help of the Spirit, etc.

Answ. But R. W. Are ye to Preach and Pray of Heavenly Things without the
Spirit of God or a Motion in you? and can a Man Hear or Read the Scriptures
with understanding without the Spirit of God? which we affirm, They cannot
truly. And if the Spirit of God, then must be a Motion within hearkened to: and
so R. W. overthrows his own Assertion, and proves himself a Doter. -- Then

R. W. Tells a Story of Babilonian, Assyrian and Popish Tyrants, Devils, etc.

Answ. What are all these (he might have kept them at home) to prove, The
Quakers do not own Scriptures?

R. W. And thou say, This Record is the Outward and External Light,
Lanthorn, Judge, and Guide and Rule, etc.

Answ. Now, but can an External Rule, and Judge, and Guide guide the Eternal
Spirit of God? does not the Spirit of God Lead into all Truth of it? But R. W.
that seem to own the Scriptures, and ye New England-Priests, where is it
written, that the Scriptures are called an External Judge and Guide? let us see
Chapter and Verse for it: do not tell us of a Gall'd-back-Horse; but give us
Chapter and Verse, and abide the Search. But are not ye New-England-Priests and
Professors gone beside this External Judge, Rule and Guide, so that ye neither
walk according to the Light of the External Guide (as thou call it) the
Scriptures, nor according to the Light of Christ? for the Light of Christ thou
call'st a Fancy and an Idol. And thou art made to confess, That God and Christ
were before Scripture: and then why would thou set the Scriptures above his
Spirit? And then thou tell us in a Way of Preaching of John Baptist, p. 91.
what he said of Christ; All this we own, and the Scriptures that speak of him:
but how can thou own the Scriptures, and not John's T^stimony, who came for
a Witness to bear Witness of the true Light? And we also can say, God sent us
amongst you.

R. W. And thou tell us of Prating of the Light (and say) If they slight
the Outward, Standing Record and Witnesses of God in them, there is no Light in
them.

Answ. That is thy own Condition, thou slightest both Scriptures and Light,
which John bore Witness to, as the Scriptures testify.

R. W. says telling us of subscribing to the Papists, or else (he says) ye
must study the Scriptures and search the Originals, etc.

Answ. R. W. may subscribe to the Papists. How can he search the Scriptures and
study the Originals without the Light of Christ? no more than They can see
without the Light of Christ; than a Blind-Man can see to read the Writings. And
so without the Heavenly Light of Christ thou can not Judge of pretending
Christ's, Prophets, Doctrines, Churches and Spirits, nor see, what is in thy
self.

R. W. Thou say, That the Quakers do affirm, that the Scripture is within
them: and, What is the English of that? but that the Light, which they and
every Man in the World has within them ( the Christ, the Spirit, which every
one has) is the Scripture.

Answ. Who did ever hear any of the Quakers say, or in G. F.'s Book here, That
Christ, the Light and Spirit in Man was Scripture (to wit, Writings, or Paper
and Ink?) Though this we must needs tell R. W. That is Scripture within, when
God writes his Law in the Heart, that is Heavenly Scripture: that is the Table
in the Heart, that every true Christian reads; that is Law there. And every
one, that has the King's Declaration, he has not the King in his House; so
every one, that has the Scripture, has not Christ: but he that has the Word,
has Christ the Scripture declares of; so that he has both the Declaration
and the Word it self (to wit, Christ in his Heart:) then he has the Comfort of
Scriptures. And we own the Scriptures to be Love Letters, and can bless the
Lord God for them; and have the Comfort of them, though thou may say, what
thou will.

R. W. And then thou say: The Light, Christ [ which enlightneth every Man,
that comes into the World] and the Spirit [the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth
which leads into all Truth, p. 92.
which proceeds from the Father and from the Son; which we have received from
the Lord Jesus Christ] this Light, this Spirit (thou say) thou have proved
Hellish Darkness, the Spirit of Satan, a false, lying Christ.

Answ. Thou have proved thy self a Blasphemer, and thy own false Light, and
Spirit and Antichrist to be so: and God will Judge thee for these Words! And
what do thou talk of God's Dispensation, when thou blasphemest after this
Manner against the Light of Christ, his Spirit and his Son; or talkest of
Believing in him (that Individual Person of Christ Jesus) and not in a Fancy
within? -- Romans 15. is owned, and John. 20. is owned: and do thou ever think
to receive Blessedness and Life from Jesus Christ at the Right Hand of God, and
can not endure to hear talk of him within, and call'st his Light a Fancy and
a lying Christ (in the same page) and Hellish Darkness? But we own no other
Christ, than him, that was born of the Virgin and conceived by the Holy Ghost;
and by the Holy Ghost we call him LORD (which we know, no Man can do, but by
the Holy Ghost) And how can thou call him LORD, which have no Voice nor
Motion within in Heavenly things in Matters of Supernatural Light? And then
thou fallest a-railing; Pharisees, Jesuits, Quakers, Atheists, etc. but this
thou might have kept at Home. -- And as for the Breath or Wind of the Devil
in the Lips of Atheists, Jews, Ranters, Papists, etc. thou might have kept
at Home: for it are not the Quakers, but your selves, that puff and blow with
your Evil Breath against Christ Jesus his most Holy Light, which shines more
precious, than the Sun in the Firmament, and is revealed in our Hearts; that
gives the Knowledge of him, and stands against all your Black Storms, and
Persecutions and Persecutors, and shines more and more to the Perfect Day:
Glory to God for Ever!

R. W. And then thou tell us a Famous Story in Turkey of a Woman appearing
in the Heavens with a Book in her Hand, page 93.
etc. and the Two Witnesses: Item, the Book in Revelations, and queriest,
Whether it be the Book of the Revelations, or the Whole Bible or Scripture?

Answ. If we must teach R. W. (who says, We do not own the Scriptures) we
Answer; That neither these Two Witnesses, nor John did eat up the Outward
Bible, to wit, Paper and Ink. Neither did he Eat up the Revelations in Paper
and Ink, for it was joined to the Bible (I believe, History may tell thee) a
great while afterward: for the Book of Revelation was Revelations in him,
before he spoke them forth; and then after it was printed. -- And as thou
bring Tindal, thou may stop thy Mouth for him; for he owneth Christ and
his Light which enlightneth every Man, that comes into the World. And thou
tellest us the Story of the Jews, of their Curious Writing the Old Testament;
And all this is nothing to prove R. W.'s Saying, We disown the Scriptures: and
he is confounded in this over and over. For he says, J. B. showed him
Scriptures, and called unto thee for Scriptures: and pray thee R. W. how many
Scriptures did thou show to us, when we were in the Dispute, to prove thy
false Charges against us? but told'st us Several Stories, as thou do now.

R. W. Thou tell us of the First Protestants Affection to the Scriptures; p.
94.
and then rail'st and say, The Papists and Quakers slighting the Scriptures.
-- [ R. W. might have put in the New-England-Priests with him; and not the
Quakers, which have an Esteem of the Scriptures, and practice them more than
they.] And then thou tell us of Christ's Martyrs or Witnesses Love to the
Scriptures in the Days of Q. Mary; of Ridley, Bishop of London, etc. and as the
Fire grew Hotter, etc. they spent Hours and Nights in Prayer and Holy
Conference upon the Scripture.

Answ. What is this to R. W. and the New-England-Priests? So have the Quakers
spent Hours, Nights and Days; yea, in New England and other Places the Lord's
Spirit stirred us up the more, as the New-England-Fires grew Hotter and Hotter,
till they came to HANGING and BLOODSHED. And then we saw, They that were born
after the Flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit: and the LORD
alone knows, what Suffering we have had amongst you, who is our Only
Protector, Preserver and Vpholder to this Day! We gave our Backs to our
WHIPPERS, and our EARS to be CUT OFF! and to BRANDING with an HOT IRON! Did we
ever lift up a Hand? did we not suffer, as Lambs and Sheep among you Wolves and
Foxes, that professed the Scriptures, as the Papists? O! that the Lord would
open your Eyes, and thy Eyes R. W. (that is all the Hurt we wish you) that thou
might see a Day of Repentance of thy Evil Work! who abusest the Press,
desilest peoples Minds, blasphemest against Christ and his Light! But when we
Consider, it was the Portion of the Righteous in all Ages to suffer Affliction
by the Birth of the Flesh, that it was not only given us to Believe, but also
to Suffer (that it was the Day of the True Lord Jesus Christ) yea, and by such
a people, as New-England's Great and High Professors, that R. W. extolleth so
high (that could not stand in Persecution themselves, but fled into the
Wilderness; as though they had learned of the Wolves and Bears there to Devour
the Lambs and Servants of Christ) it was no New Thing to us, to suffer by such
proud Pharisees, that profess God and Christ in Words, and Pesecute him, where
he is Manifest.

And R. W. most- Impudently and Maliciously says, That James Parnel Murdered
himself; which here is something following to Clear that Martyr and Witness of
Jesus from R. W.'s lying Tongue and his fellow-Persecuting Priests.

A Short RELATION of JAMES PARNEL'S Imprisonment, Sufferings and Death, (which
R. W. slandereth and Printeth against.)
One Henry Barrington a Justice said, That James Parnel was Guilty of his own
Death (which he had ( as he says) from One Smith's Mouth) And after he said;
He put those words (concerning James Parnel's being Guilty of his own Death) in
Himself; because there was a Letter (he said) at White, Hall, which was given
in by One Davis, which said, That the Jailer through his Cruel Usage was Guilty
of James Parnel's Death. -- So here ye may see the Wickedness of the Justice to
Cover the Murdering of the Innocent: and see the Goaler's Cruel Usage of this
James Parnel, and R. W.'s Malice. After they had put up James in a Close Hole,
and made an Order, and stuck it upon the Door, That every One, that came to see
him, should spend Four Pence in Beer: but James's Friends being not Free to
serve the Goaler's Lusts, the Goaler's Wife run at them with a Knife, and would
have taken their Hats from them. And several of James's Friends and Relations
came for to visit him, but were denied, and not suffered to Worse Usage than
Paul had among the Heathen-Romans, Act. 28.30. and at Malta.
sp^ak to him: and when he had Victuals, the Goaler's Wife set others to steal
his Uictuals from him. And the Jailer suffered the Prisoners to break James's
Box, and take his things out of it: and when they were reproved, they said;
That the Goaler's Wife was the First Inventer of the stealing of his Victuals
from him: and so they were Imboldned the more. And the Goaler's Wife Swore
several times, THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HIS BLOOD; and told James's Friends so. And
as for his Fasting Voluntarily, the Witnesses deny it, that were with him, when
e was Weak.

But the Ground of the Taking of James Parnel was: There was a Fast held at the
Town of Great Cox-Hall in Essex upon the 12 day of the 5th. Month. 1655. where
there were about 9 or 10 Priests and 4 Justices, and many of the Independent
and Presbyterian Faction. And this James Parnel hearing, that they Railed
against the Truth and the People of God called Quakers, he went to the
Steeple-House: and there was one Priest Wells an Independent. And when this
Priest had done, James spoke a few words unto him as concerning his Railing
against the People of God called Quakers: and all these Priests having the
Justices on their sides, they interrupted the Youth James Parnel. And after a
While, when he had spoken, what was upon him from the Lord to them, he went
away; and many Sober People went after him out of the Steeple-House. And as he
was passing away to his Friend's House, a Justice called Wakering, came behind
him, and said, He Arrested him in the Name of the Protector. So after, when
their Fast was done, they made a Mittimus, and sent him to Colchester-Goal.
Now, here are some of the Names of the Persecuting Priests, that had a Hand in
James Parnel's Blood.

First, Priest Wells of an Independent Company at Brantry; and Priest Shams, a
Teacher of the Independent Company at Great Cox-Hall: and Priest Sparrow, a
Teacher of an Independent Company at Halstead: and Priest Steltam, a Teacher of
an Independent Company at Tarling: and yet all Parish Priests. And the Jailer,
when they sent him to Prison, would not let him have so much as a Truckle-bed:
and they Chained this youth among the Thieves and Murderers day and night, and
led him Eighteen miles to the Assizes, and had Irons upon one of his hands: as
you may see in the Book of his Life in the 243. and 244. pages.

And the Jailer put him into a little Hole, called the Oven, up in the
Castle-Wall ( after he returned from the Assizes) and would not suffer him a
little Char-coal: and so for Want of Air his Naturals grew weak; and they not
suffering him to have a Bed, and his Friends being denied to come at him. And
the Goaler's Wife did not only Beat him her self several times, and Swore, she
would have his BLOOD; but set others to beat him: and so, he was forced to Lie
on Stones in a Wet Season another time.

And when he was so beaten and abused with the Goaler's Wife and her Company,
they would not suffer his Friends to give him a little Meat to pluck up by a
Rope in a Basket, he being too weak to come down out of the Oven. And the
Ladder was Six Foot too short to reach the Hole: and therefore there was a Rope
ti^d above the Ladder, for him to swing up into the Oven. And though so Weak,
and so Stupiffed in ^is Joints, yet he must Swing down and up that Rope to the
Ladder, and fetch his Food; or else he must Famish t^ the Hole: For ^^ese
Hard-Hearted Priests and Justices, and the Jailer agreed together ( as by these
Proceedings appears to destroy him. For when Some of James's Friends proffered
to the Justices and Jailer forty pound Bond, it would not be accepted; though
they proffered Body for Body, to let him have a little Liberty. And one time,
when he got down into the yard to get a little Air, the Jailer Locked him in the
Yard all night, it being in Cold Winter. -- And so after a time climbing up the
Ladder, he being grown very weak, he mist the Rope, that he was to swing down
by; and so fell down from the top of the Ladder, and hurt himself: And so grew
weaker and weaker; they not suffering his Relations and Friends to give him
necessary things, nor suffer him to walk to the Castle-door. And therefore said
James, If I die* they have this Body. And all Means were used that could be
^ound, that the Justices and Jailer might be clear of his Innocent Blood; but
no Mercy could be found among them. And when he died, he said; I DIE
INNOCENTLY: and so fell asleep in Christ Jesus. And at his Departure there were
some of his Relations, Anne Langley, and Thomas Shortland, who through great
Trouble got to him; and heard him speak these words aforesaid; I MUST DIE, AND
I DIE INNOCENTLY. And after he was dead, the Wicked Priests and their
Confederates went, and made a Book, and said; That James Parnel fasted himself
to Death. And this is the Food and Lies, which Roger Williams and the Priests
of New England feed upon, that Old Jezabel's Fast; the Fruits of it were for
Persecution and Blood: And James Parnel's INNOCENT BLOOD LIES ON THE HEADS OF
THEM!

And much more might be written; but the Testimony of many sober good
Christians in Cox-Hall, and Colchester and Essex, with the several
Certificates, that are in print (which is too large to Instance here) of the
Innocence of James Parnel, and of the Cruelty of his Persecutors may testify.
And also beside Mayor Beard (which was one of the Jury upon James Parnel)
afterward much Lamented his Death, and the Barbarous, Cruel Sufferings of
James Parnel, and was sorry, That ever he should have a hand in his
Persecution; which he saw, was stirred up by the Priests. But this is no
strange Work with the Presbyterian and Independent Priests, Matthew. 28.13, 14,
15.
to say, James Parnel fasted himself to Death; when the Priests, their
Forefathers, said; That Christ's Disciples stole him away by Night, while the
Soldiers slept. And this was the Work of their Day, to make Lies their Refuge,
and to sow them abroad, like Roger Williams, and the Whore, that Solomon
speaks of; to Wipe their Lips, as though they were Clean. And this may serve
Roger Williams and the Persecutors of New England, which have BANISHED, and
WHIPPED, and CUT OFF EARS, and HANGED the Servants of the Lord; and then Wipe
their Mouths and say, They are Clean, or Good Christians, and they have done
Christ Good Service in so doing. But Christ rebukes such, and tells them,
They know not, what Spirit they are of: for he came not to D^stroy Men's Lives,
but to Save them.

R. W. Thou say, We ( after the Devil's Method) make use of the Scripture as
a Shield or Buckler, to fence our selves against the Scripture; p. 95.
and as a Sword, to run through the Heart and Bowels of the Scriptures, the
Saints, and Christ and God himself, etc. and then fall'st a-railing.

Answ. Jer. 22. 2 Kings 17. 1 Cor. 11. These Scriptures do not prove this; nor
that we Disown Scriptures. Now R. W. and ye New-England-Priests, can the Heart
and Bowels of Christ be run through with a Sword? who can but tremble to hear
those Words! We do charge R. W. and the New-England-Priests (that say, The
Scripture is their Rule) to give us Chapter and Verse for these Words, that we
may see, where they be written? that we may Search for them. Is the
Incomprehensible God and Christ his Son (whom he has given all Power in Heaven
and Earth unto and at the Rig^t Hand of God) so light unto you, and of so low a
Value? does R. W. own any God or Christ, but whose Bowels and Heart may be run
through with a Sword? and is not that a false God and Christ? We tell him, the
true Christ and the living God is far above his Reach and Sword? and his unholy
Hands. And is not this Blasphemy to say, The Living God and his Son Christ
Jesus (who is at the Right Hand of God) can be run through with a Sword? we
tell him, He dies no more: but such as thou art, Crucify him to themselves a
fresh, Imprison and Persecute him in his people, as Christ says in Matthew. And
we own the Scriptures, and the Saints and the true Christianity; and not for
this wicked End* as thou wickedly speak. And as for thy Ladders and
Scaffolds, and a many such Ill favored Comparisons, that thou have in thy
Book, might'^t have kept them for thy self, with all the rest of thy Ungracious
Expressions.

R. W. The Merchants desire to see Effects, etc. the Jews, Pharisees; the
Papists and the Quakers do not own the Perfection.

Answ. But R. W. where are thy Effects of thy Religion and the rest of the
Priests? where are the Effects of true Christianity? where are the Effects of
the Fruits of a Good Spirit? for this is not the Language of the Spirit of God,
but of the Evil Spirit; is but of the Effects of the Pharisees and Papists thou
speak of, which are Envy, Bloodshed and Murder: And ye persecuting his
Servants with Tongue and Hand, and HANGING his people, these are not the
Effects of the Good Spirit, but of the Evil One; as the Apostle has described
it in the Scriptures.

And as for the Effects in the Practice of Religion in any Duty, that may
appear (for with whom do thou Meet, and Pray and Preach? or whether or no
thou art not found in the Manner of them, whom the Apostle condemns, and
exhorts the Saints not to have Fellowship withal, Heb. 10, 25.) we think,
thou may forbear to upbraid any, thy self bringing forth so little Effects,
but Effects of an Evil Heart and Unbelief, according to the Apostle's words.
And is not the Authority of the Scripture the Holy Ghost, that moved the Holy
Men of God, that spoke them forth, which lead the Disciples in all Truth of
them? which we witness. For do not thou say, They are of no Value, without
the Spirit of God set them home to the Heart? (as in Append. p. 94.) And so, if
they be of No Value, then that which makes them Valuable, is the Power and
Spirit of God: and then that must be the Authority of them.

R. W. But thou say; The Quakers and Papists call the Scriptures a Dead
Letter [and say, They are of no Value, etc. as before.]

Answ. And as for the Papists, thou had better joined them to thy self; they
are nearer thee, then we are. And where did we ever Throw Dirt at the Holy
Scripture, and said; It was a Nose of Wax, and a Leaden Rule? let the Reader
see, if there be any such words in G. F'.s Answer, or any other Books. And
truly, if any make a Nose of Wax of them, twisting them up and down, it is thy
own Condition; thou giving Meanings of them this Way and that Way, and find
fault with us, because we take them Literally. And 2 Cor. 3. that is nothing to
the purpose: If the King gives a Pardon for Death in Writing; this comes to a
Man, p. 96.
and preventeth his Execution. But what must we infer from R. W.'s Words here?
That every Man, that has the Writings of the Scripture, has the Pardon of
Eternal Death? and why does he cry against Papists then and all others? for
they have the Scriptures, therefore they have the Pardon. So in this R. W.
stops his own Mouth, and shuts out Revelation of the Son of God, which
Scripture speaks of, and Revelation of Faith, Revelation of Grace, Revelation
of the Gospel, Revelation of the Spirit, which is the Seal of all Believers of
the Pardon from Eternal Death by the Blood of Jesus Christ and the Witness with
themselves, by which they can set to their Seal, that God is True in all his
Promises, and Figures and Shaddows of his Son Christ Jesus, Blessed forever!

R. W. Brings ( G. F. Fol. p. 47.) Joshuah Miller saying, [ It is an Error
(if not Damnable) to say, Christ is the Means; and that there is no other Means
of Salvation.] G. F. Answ. [And Christ says, No man can come to the Father,
but by me: and he is Able to save to the uttermost; and, He shall be my
Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, says the Lord. And (says the Apostle) God
is in Christ reconciling the World to himself: And, He that has the Son, has
Life: the Father and Son are one; and there is no Salvation in any other.] And
R. W. replieth and says, His Adversaries would not Suffer him to meddle with
the Sense of G. F.'s words: [But G. F.'s words are Plain enough; and what does
he give a Sense of that? where is your Nose of Wax now?] Yet he thinks not,
that a man of Wisdom would call it an Error, to say, That Christ is the Means
to Salvation. Then he falls a-railing and says; For this Wretched Juggler
(to wit G. F.) subtily confounds the Instrumental Causes of Salvation with the
Efficient in God the Father, p. 97.
the Meritorious in God the Son, Christ Jesus.

Answ. How can this be? when G. F. says, God was in Christ reconciling the
World to himself? and God says, He shall be my Salvation to the Ends of the
Earth? And the Apostle says, ( Ephesians. 1, 17.) In whom we have Redemption through
his Blood, Forgiveness of Sin, according to the Riches of his Grace. And --

R. W. says, I know, this Juggler means not a Christ, nor his Blood, nor his
Death, as we mean, but an Imaginary Christ, etc.

Answ. This Knowledge of thine, and this Means of thine is false, the Lord
knows it; and the Imaginary is in thyself. -- But --

R. W. says, Christ's Messengers are said to Save.

Answ. And what then? is not this through Christ?

R. W. Secondly, Thou say; The Scriptures are said to make Wise to Salvation.

Answ. But why will not R. W. put in, THROVGH FAITH? as though the Scriptures
can Make Wise to Salvation without Faith, Thou say --

R. W. A Man may be God's Means to Save his Wife, and she her Husband.

Answ. And is not this Means FAITH, which Christ is the Author of? And thou
say --

R. W. That we are Saved by Hope, Faith, etc.

Answ. But does not Paul tell thee, That this Hope is Christ, and Faith he is
the Author of? And thou say --

R. W. Saved by Baptism.

Answ. And what! without FAITH? And --

R. W. Women are Saved by Childbearing.

Answ. But what! without Faith by Christ? And what! are all Women Saved by
Childbearing, all that are in the World, with their Bastards? for thou do
not say, Some Women; and thou do not put in FAITH. But can they grow up in
Christ the Savior without Faith? And then thou say --

R. W. All these Subtly and Wickedly G. F. sets at Variance with the
Meritorious Salvation by Jesus Christ.

Answ. G. F. Sets them not at Variance; but he says again, There is no
Salvation in any other Name under Heaven, but in the Name of Jesus Christ: And
thou that say, There is, give the Apostle the Lie, and do not own the
True Lord Jesus.

R. W. Thou tellest of a Man saving his Brother by a Rope, and a Midwife
saving a Woman in Childbed.

Answ. What is this? this is Outward from a Natural Death: but it is Christ
Jesus, that Saves his People from Eternal Death through Faith in him; which is
more, than from Outward Death. And --

R. W. Thou say; To talk of this Immediate Christ and Spirit without
Scriptures, without Preaching and other Holy Means, is as Silly, as Impious, as
Blockish, as Blasphemous, and as Bedlam and Frantic, as Wicked and
Antichristian.

Answ. R. W. has not described, what his Means are? But Reader, is not the
Means the Faith in Christ Jesus? and is not that Revealed? and is not the Means
the Holy Ghost, that Proceeds from the Father and his Son, that leads all
True Believers into all Truth? And they are not the True Preachers, that are
not in the same Holy Ghost, that gave forth the Scriptures, and all their Means
are good for nothing; seeing the Apostle says, That no Man knows the Things
of God, but by the Spirit. And so as for thy Ungracious Words, Silly, Impious,
Blockish, Blasphemy, Frantic, Wicked, Antichristian and Bedlam, thou may
keep to thy self; and so all thy Means, that have No Motion of Heavenly Things.
And all they, that be in the Faith of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, that leads
into all Truth, which the Ministers of the Spirit they have their Means from
Christ, in whose Name is Salvation; and Preach Christ, and not themselves: and
such we are One withal, and such cannot but own the Scriptures. So the Holy
Means are in the Holy Spirit: but what is this to the Means of all your Priests
and Thee, who ownest not the Light of Christ, but call it an Idol? -- And
thou talkest of an Immediate Christ without the Scripture: Will R. W. say, That
Christ and the Spirit is in the Scripture? is not Christ in Heaven? and the
Spirit of God was in them, that gave forth Scripture. And Christ says, Search
the Scriptures, for in them ye think, ye have Life; but ye will not come to me,
that ye might have Life. But we tell R. W. We, and whosoever else owneth the
Lord Jesus Christ, own the Scriptures, and cannot deny them, nor none of his
True Preachers, which carry their Message from Christ for the Good of People:
and such the World receives not, that come in the Name of the Lord; but such
as come in their own, they will Receive.

R. W. And again thou bring a Comparison of the King's Pardon sealed with
his Broad Seal to a Condemned Rebel: (which thou often bring'st over and over.)

Answ. What do thou think to prove by this? That the Scripture is the Pardon,
or is the Evidence? if it were, then the Papists, (that thou Comparest us so
often to) and many Wicked Men might have Pardon and Remission. But is it not
the Spirit, that Seals? (according to Ephesians. 1, 23.4, 30) and is it not
Christ, that Brings the Glad Tidings of Life unto the Soul, and by his Holy
Spirit bears Witness? (according to Romans 8.) and is not the Assurance thus
known?

R. W. brings Hosannah, etc. ( G. F.'s Fol. page 221.) saying, [ The Sure
Word of Prophecy the Apostle speaks of, is the Prophecy of Scripture.] G. F.
Answ. [Doth the Scripture shine in a Dark Place, until the Day Dawn? and are
they them, that must be Taken heed unto, as to a Light? Can any see the
Scripture, or know the Scripture, but by the Light within? cannot a Cain, a
Balaam, a Korah bring Scripture, that is gone from the Spirit of Prophecy
within; and then put the Letter for it?] R. W. Replieth, and begins with
Blasphemy and Railing, and says; I know, that Fox makes their Idol Within,
called Light, to be the More Sure Word of Prophecy; and his Usual Proof is, p.
98.
The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy, etc. And why must all the
Prophets or Messengers of God, who from the Beginning of the World were God's
Mouth and Pens concerning the Birth, Life and Death of Christ, etc. here be
^ast out from the Word of Prophecy?

Answ. What! cannot R. W. endure to hear talk of the Scriptures? are not John's
Words (in Revelation) The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy? and
thou deniest it, both Scripture and Spirit, who say; I Usually bring this
Proof? And Peter's Saying, We have a more Sure Word of Prophecy, which ye do
well to take heed unto, as unto a Light, that shintth in a Dark Place, until
the Day dawn, and the Day Star arise in your Hearts: This the Apostle lets them
see the Sufficiency of that Light, till they came to the Day-Dawning and the
Day-star-Arising. And what is this Day-dawning and Day-star-arising in the
Heart? if it be the Outward Scriptures of the Prophets, prove it by Scriptures.
And is this Day-Star-Arising in the Heart, and Day-Dawning and Idol? as thou
call the Light within an Idol, a More Sure Word of Prophecy, than the Voice
which was Heard in the Mount? And this is not to Cast away the Prophets: and
Peter, who directed the Saints to this Sure Word of Prophecy, (the Light, that
shines in a Dark Place) did not Cast out the Prophets* that Prophesied of
Christ's Birth, Death, etc. (as thou Dotingly speak;) no more do we, but own
them all. And Luke 1. and Romans 16. and the Apostles, that had this Light
shining, (this More Sure Word of Prophecy) they saw the Fulfilling of the
Scriptures in Christ Jesus; which none does without the Light of Christ, by
which he is seen. And --

R. W. Thou say; The Written Word or Prophecy of the Prophets is a more Sure
Word and Evidence to us, etc. than the Voice from Heaven, of which Peter here
speaks, etc.

Answ. Now what must we Observe from R. W.'s Words here? That the Written Word
or Prophecy of the Prophets shines in a dark place? Now R. W. says, that the
Scripture is the Rule and Touch stone; We do Charge him and the
New-England-Priests to make this Good by plain Scripture, and give us Chapter
and Verse, and a Rule for it either. And Secondly tell us, Where is this Dark
Place? and what it is, that this Written Word or Prophecies of the Prophets
shine in? (seeing he says, That the Scripture avails nothing without the
Spirit; (and yet, they are more) and then how can they Shine, when they avail
nothing?) And whether he does not now oppose Peter's Doctrine, who calls it a
Light, that shines in a dark place? and the Day-dawning, which shines in the
heart? so, if the Light be the Written Word, that shines in a dark place;
whether or no the Day-dawning and Day Star be the Written-Word? And this Light
(that shines in a dark place, which we are to take heed unto, until the Day
dawn, and the Day Star arise in our hearts) this Light and Day Star does own
all the Prophets from the Beginning of the World concerning the Lord Christ,
who fulfilleth them. And --

R. W. thou say, How sure is the Quakers Light, their Word of Prophecy? a
Sober Mind cannot but admire that Face and Forehead of Brass and Adamant, etc.
So that they blush not to prefer such a simple Image, a mere Baby and Child's
Puppet of their Immediate Word of Prophecy before the Word, the Mind and Will
of God by the Mouth of all the Prophets, etc. And do not thou say -- What
Cursed Opinions, horrible Uncleannesses, Bloody Murders and Slaughters have
been conceived and brought forth from the Spirit within, and Revelations from
Devilish Lights and Spirits, etc.

Answ. Let all the Moderate and Sober Christians Judge here of R. W.'s words,
and what work he has made against Peter's Doctrine, who says, That they have
a More sure Word of Prophecy, which they do well to take heed unto, as unto a
Light, till the Day dawn, and the Day Star arise in their hearts: which we do
own and stand unto. Now he calls this a Simple Image, a Mere Baby, a Child's
Puppet; and he would make this Light and Spirit the Author of Murder and
Bloodshed, and Cursed Opinions, and likewise the Author of Devilish Lights and
Spirits: see, how he blasphemeth Peter's Doctrine with Devilish Lights and
Spirits, Murders, Slaughters! he might have applied it at home to his own
Spirit and the New-England-Priests and Professors, (as in page 98.) -- And thou
bring Rev. 19. The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy: and then in
the Margent thou say [ The workings of Satan by his Spirit and Inspirations
in all Ages] but not by the Testimony of Jesus, p. 99.
the Testimony of Prophecy R. W. but by such a Spirit, as thou art in. And thou
say --

R. W. Does not the Angel forbid John Worshipping of him? etc.

Answ. But has R. W. and his New-England-Priests forbidden this Worship? and
art not thou offended in speaking the Word Thee and Thou to every Body, and for
want of the Hat and Knee? etc. and thou have publicly declared thy self, that
we might be punished for not doing these things. But would not thou and the
New-England-priests and Professors be honored with Hat and Knee? and yet John
was not to bow down to the Angel.

R. W. And thou go on Railing, and say; And shall we say, that the Angels
too are Quakers? and Christ has Enlightened them also, as well as every Man?
etc.

Answ. where did ever we say, the Angels were Quakers? is there any such thing
in G. F.'s Reply to Hosanna, let the Reader see. But were not all things made
by Christ Jesus? and did not Christ, who is God, who made them, enlighten them?
if not, how should they see their Work they are to do, who are called
Ministering Spirits, Flames of Fire, etc. ( Hebr.)

R. W. And then thou tellest, G. F. mentions Cain and Balaam and Ko^e.

Answ. And very well he may Use it to thee, and to our Old Persecutors, and
such as thou and the New-England-Priests, who gainsay the Light of Christ, and
the Law of the Spirit (which makes us free from Sin and Death) as Core did the
Law of Moses: And we have not mist you, for you are worse, then Core, who did
not call the Law of God an Idol and a Fancy; as thou have called the Light of
Christ over and over in thy Book. And all the Prophets of God from the
Beginning of the World, they spoke from an Inward Sight and Light of God in
their hearts, which is heard, known and seen by the Light and Spirit of God in
the heart, which leads into the Truth of them: and thou, that would not
hear the Light within, and take heed unto in the dark place; thou would not
hear the Prophets and Christ Jesus, from whence it comes: And so Remember
Dives. And --

R. W. goes on Railing and says, G. F. is so used to Cursing, etc.

Answ. But let the Reader see, Whether there be any such words of Cursing in G.
F.'s Answer in page 97? -- And so, as for Horrible Wickedness, their Lying
Father, Ugly Spiders, Poison and blind Dreamer, thou might have applied to
thy self. And --

R. W. thou say, What a madness is it for this Blind Dreamer to ask, Whether
the Scripture shines in a dark place, until the Day dawn, and the Day Star
arise in the heart? etc. and then thou say, p. 100
All the subtle Foxes in the World must know, that if they attend unto
Whisperings and Peepings, and leave the Written Law, etc. and other Prophecies
of Scripture, etc. for all their Childish Vapourings and Prating of their
Light, the Eternal Father of Lights proclaims them to be Children of howling
Darkness, and that there is no Light within them. And thou say, He that
shall find a spark of true Light etc. in this their Fantastic Light, he shall
find the Living among the Dead, and prove the Prophets of God, and God, (whose
Word was Spoken) to be Liars, for saying, There is no Light within them.

Answ. All this Blasphemy and Railing is not so much against the Quakers, but
against Peter's Doctrine, to wit, the Light, which the Saints did and were to
Take heed unto, until the Day dawn, and the Day Star arise in their hearts. And
R. W. goes about to give Peter the Lie, and would seem to prove it by the Law
of God and his Prophets; but by this he has proved himself a Liar, and one
that hates the Light. And he brings Esa 8; but let him see, it is said in
the Margent there, And there is no Morning in them, if they speak not according
to the Law and Prophets; so we may speak to him. And R. W. this is not in him,
who speaks not according to the Law and Prophets, Christ and his Apostles:
for the Light, that Peter speaks of, that shines in Darkness (which they are
to take heed unto, until the Day dawn, and the Day Star arise) this was before
the Morning; they were come to the Morning. And so he gives Peter the Lie, and
John the Lie, and abuses Esaiah's Words, what John says, This was the true
Light (which he bore witness to) that Lights every Man, which was the Life in
the Word: and R. W. with all his Evil Speakings witnesses against it, and
calls it a Fantastic Light, a Childish Vapor, and Whispering and Peeping;
but he might have kept this at home. And [ The Father of Lights (he says)
proclaims us to he Children of howling Darkness, and that there is no Light
in them.] Answ. The Father of Lights proclaims no such thing, nor his Son;
but says: Every One, that does the Truth, comes to the Light; and every one,
that does Evil, hates the Light, and will not come to it, because it reproves
him: And this is R. W.'s Condition.

R. W. asks,, What Light have the Papists, Jews and the Devil, when they
bring Scripture to Christ? -- and so falls a railing.

Answ. But if the Jews and Papists do hate the Light, like R. W. yet I never
heard the Jews and Papists call it an Idol, and a frantic Light, as R. W.
does: and we say, neither he, nor the Papists or Jews can see neither the
Scriptures, nor Christ without the Light. And we never did say, That Christ did
enlighten the Devil himself with his true Light; for Christ says, There is no
Truth in him: but R. W. says, That there is something of God, that is, from
the Power and Wisdom of God, in the fallen Spirits and the Devils themselves;
which we Charge R. W. and all his New-England-Priests to give us Scripture for
those Words (as in his Append. p. 5:) and therefore why does R. W. ask G. F.
What Light has the Devil himself? And thou say, The Devil brings a
pertinent Scripture and Promise to Christ Jesus, as ever the Papists or
Quakers: This R. W. might have kept at home, with the Jesuitical, Diabolical
Reservations, and venomous and poisonous, with his Unsavory, Ungratious words.

R. W. brings Enoch Howet ( G. F. Fol. p. 14.) his sayings [ The Scriptures
to be the Only Weapon, whereby Christ overthrew the Devil.] G. F. Answ. [Who
bruiseth his Head (to wit Christ) was, before the Scripture was: yet the
Scripture is for Correction and Doctrine, furnishing the Man of God in his
place. And Christ the Seed was, before the Scripture was: and all that have
Scripture, and not Christ, cannot Overcome the Devil (ye and the Papists doing
his Work.) For they that Overcome him, it is with the Power of Christ [for
Christ says, Without me ye can do nothing:] and those have the Scriptures of
Truth, which the Devil is out of.] R. W.'s Reply: How does Christ's bruising of
Satan's Head, and being before Scripture was, disprove, etc. and so falls
a-railing; p. 101.
Who sees not Fox in his Borough?

Answ. R. W. does not or will not state G. F.'s words right, as he has spoken
them; as the Reader may see, viz: [ As Christ, who bruiseth his Head, being
before Scripture was] who bruiseth his Head by his Power, and destroys Death,
and the Devil, the Power of Death: who is manifest in Time, etc. And --

R. W. says; As for G. F.'s saying, [They that have the Scripture, and not
Christ, cannot overcome the Devil.] (And R. W. Replieth) What News does he tell
the World, which no body denies? and yet thou say again; How does this
deny, that Christ Jesus overcame the Devil by Scripture? [ which is the Sword,
the Only Sword, and is called a Sword, Append. p. 88.]

Answ. But R. W. thou must show us a Rule for it in Scripture, Chapter and
Verse, That the Scripture is the Sword, the Only Sword: and yet thou say (
Append. p. 94.) That it ( the Scripture) does not avail without the Spirit of
God. And how does this hang together R. W? That they that have the Scripture
without the Spirit, cannot overcome the Devil: and yet, The Scripture is the
Sword, and the Only Sword, by which Christ overcame the Devil? and, The
Scripture does not avail without the Spirit; and yet it is thy Only Sword? [and
in thy Book called Experiments (Epist. to Lady Vane the Younger, 1652) thou
say, That the Two-edged Sword is of his (God's) most Holy Spirit, which
pierces between the very Soul and Spirit, etc.] But these things are Answered
more Largely in the Appendix.

R. W. says; Is all Scripture or Writing given forth by Inspiration of God,
and is profitable ( though G. F. alleges the Scriptures by Halves) for
Correction and Doctrine, etc. and, Then it clearly follows, that as Christ
Jesus overcame the Devil by the Scriptures, so etc.

Answ. Christ was the Power of God: and the Devil brought Scripture to him and
said, It is written; but Christ overcame him by the Power, who is the Substance
of the Scriptures: And Christ through Death destroyed the Devil, the Power of
Death; and was that by Scripture? And G. F. does confess, he does not write all
the Scriptures, which thou Scoffingly call Halves; neither does R. W. write
all the Scriptures, nor half neither: And Christ did not Overcome the Devil by
the Scripture, when he corrected him by Scripture in his Power and Spirit. And
the Apostle says, All Scripture given forth by Inspiration of God, is
profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in
Righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, and thoroughly furnished to
all good Works (2 Timothy 3.) and this he does not say to the Men of the World,
that be in the Evil Work, like R. W. and his New-England-Priests and Professors
are.

R. W. And thou say; So, by the same Weapon this Subtle Fox and all other of
Satan's Foxes must be corrected, confuted, caught and destroyed (except they
repent) for ever.

Answ. What! must the Scripture destroy us? and that which is of no value
without the Spirit of God R. W? but this is Answered (as I said before) Largely
in the Appendix.

R. W. And with Scoffing words to no purpose thou say; How he runs in and
out of his Holes, etc. As for the Quakers Power here pretended in Opposition to
the Scriptures, etc. and, Thus sometimes a Devil of Drunkenness, Swearing,
Stealing runs away from the Sermons of the Quakers, as a Naughty Devil,
sometimes as the Chiding and Conjuring of a good Witch, that he may get the
faster hold by etc. Self-Conceit and Contradiction to the Scriptures, p. 102.
by Will Worship and superstitious Inventions against the Holy Institutions and
Commands of the true Lord Jesus Christ.

Answ. R. W. and his New-England-Priests and Professors might have all those
Ungracious, Unsavory Words kept at home. But what is this good Witch he
speaks of? for we own the Holy Scriptures, and the Commands etc. of the true
Lord Jesus Christ, and his Worship in Spirit and Truth: And if thou had
Overcome the Devil by the Only Sword of the Scripture, we should never have
such Railing Expressions from thee, which proceed from him. -- And thou tell
a Story of the Devil, and how a Child lies down and cries; but thou might
have kept this at home, with all the rest of thy Railing Language: for thou,
who have him so often in thy Mouth, its like, thou art more acquainted with
him, than with Christ and his Light. And R. W. must not be called a Railer; not
He, but it is We must be the Railers: but see, if he finds any such words here
in G. F.'s Reply to Enoch Howet. And --

R. W. brings Francis Duke ( Fol. page 189.) saying, [ When Christ told the
Devil, that Man should not live by Bread alone, bu^ by every Word, that
proceeds out of the Mouth of God; That wa^ Be^ieving the Scripture: and this
Word of God in the Scripture was the Ground of Christ's Faith; and so to all,
that are his.] G. F. Answ. [Many may have the Scripture, and never hear the
Voice o^ God, as the Jews, Joh. 5. and they said, they believed the Scriptures;
though they were out of the true Belief. But receiving the Word from God, is as
they, that gave forth the Scriptures, which Man lives by, and not by Bread
alone; and so knows him, who was, before Scripture was given forth. And for
saying, That the Scripture was the Ground of Christ's Faith; he was, before the
Scripture was writ, and so fulfilleth their Words, and is the Author and
Finisher of the Saints Faith, which was, before the Scripture was given forth:
he by whom the World was made, is the Author of the Saints Faith, that bruiseth
the Serpent under his Feet, etc.] And R. W. Replieth, and falls arailing and
says; How Notorious for Tautologies are these Brutish Clamors! shall we
believe their Notorious Lies? etc. and so goes on railing and cries,
Childish, etc. Ancient, Doting Women, etc. so full of Idle Repetitions: and
cries, How brutish and impious, viz: That a Man may have the Scriptures, and
yet not be in the Belief; therefore the Word of God was not the Ground of
Christ's Belief? and again; The Devil and the Wicked Men may have the
Scriptures, and not Believe in them; and therefore Christ Jesus and the Saints
Believe them not neither.

Answ. This is a False Inference of thine, as to say, Christ and the Saints did
not believe the Scriptures; the Reader may see, there is no such thing in G.
F.'s Answer: and do not thou confess, That (many) they may have the
Scriptures, and not overcome the Devil? (p. 101.) But did those Jews, that
Persecuted Christ, and his Apostles and Prophets, Truly Believe in Christ? --
Now, as for Tautologies, and the Doting Woman, with Idle Repetitions thou
may apply to thy self: for how often in thy Book do thou call over and
over the Light of Christ an Idol, a Frantic Light? And read page 109. in
Append* and there thou may see thy Tautologies; Quakers, Papists, Papists
and Quakers, Papists, etc. where he mentions the Quakers and Papists a matter
of Twelve times over, as though R. W. would fill up his Book with it: and let
the Reader see most of the Pages throughout his Book, whether he has not done
the same. And R. W. may note, how often David and the Holy Men of God go over
the same thing; and the Apostles mention often the Name of Jesus: and if R. W.
and his New-England-Priests do say, That these are Notorious Lies, that which
G. F. says (as the Reader may see in his Answer) viz. [" Many may have the
Scriptures and hear not the Voice of God.] This is a Notorious Lie by R. W. (as
in Joh. 5.) [And the Jews would say, They Believed Scriptures; though they were
out of the True Belief and Receiving Christ, the Word of God: and Christ in
plain Words told them, They were of their Father, the Devil;] This is another
Lie of R. W. and the New-England-Priests. [But Receiving the Word from God, is
as they, that gave forth the Scriptures, (that received his Word, which Man
lives by, and not by Bread only;] And these R.W. calls Notorious Lies: [and
so knows him, that was, before Scripture was given forth (to wit, Christ] and
these R. W. says, are Notorious Lies. [And they say, that Christ was, before
the Scripture was writ, and fullfilleth the words, to wit, the Scripture:] This
is a Notorious Lie; shall we believe those Notorious Lies? says R. W. [and is
the Author and Finisher (to wit, Christ) of the Saints Faith.] Shall we believe
these Notorious Lies? etc. And --

R. W. thou say, Shall we believe their Notorious Lies, that the Light
within gave forth the Scripture? and that they speak and write, as they are
moved by the Spirit, when their Writings are so weak? etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G. F.'s Answer, That
the Light within us gave forth Scripture? but it was the Holy Ghost in the
Prophets and Apostles, that gave forth Scriptures; and with the Light of Christ
we see them, and are led into all Truth by the Holy Ghost. And again, as for
Tautologies, R. W. may read his page 84. of his Book, and see, where he 11 or
12 times goes over Juggler and Cheater, Juggler and Cheater, etc. in one and
the same page.

R. W. begins with Railing: Let Heaven and Earth hear and abhor the
Sophistry of these Deceivers! they would fain have no such Christ as Man, p.
103.
a Christ without, an Outside Christ, etc. And then thou contradictest thy
self and say, That We confess, that there was such a Man or Person, who came
according to Gal. 4.

Answ. Which we really believe: and we do not Cloak nor Cross our Principle in
saying, That Christ was before the Scripture; but thou wrongst G. F.'s words
again. For his words are not, That Christ bruised the Serpent's Head before the
Scripture was; but, Christ was, before the Scripture was; who bruiseth the
Serpent's head: for all things were made by Christ, (as the Reader may see page
102.) And does not Christ say, Before Abraham was, I am? And as for Sophistry,
and Deceiving, and speaking of an Outside Christ, those are thy own Railing
Words, not ours; and does not become an Old Man, nor Christian.

R. W. Let any of these Jugglers answer, if they speak honestly; If there was
really such a Man called Jesus at Jerusalem? etc.

Answ. R. W. begins with Railing here: but seeing, he querieth of us, we
shall answer him and all the World. We do believe, there was Such a Man, who
was born in Bethlehem, Christ Jesus, suffered without the Gates of Jerusalem,
after the Scripture was written: who was tempted of the Devil, and the Devil
brought Scripture to him; and Christ Reproved him with Scripture, and Overcame
him by his POWER. And Christ died and rose, and fulfilled the Prophets, and at
the Right Hand of God: who is the same that Descended, the same that Ascended.
But where does R. W. prove by the Scriptures, (and the New-England-Priests)
That the Scriptures were the Ground of Christ's Faith? this we must have
Scripture for, before we can receive it from R. W. and his New England priests,
to wit, That the Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith, and the Ground of
the Saints Faith: and yet he says, The Scripture avails nothing; is of no
value without the Spirit, etc: ( Append. p. 94.) And further we say: If the
Scripture was the Ground of the Saints Faith, and the Scripture avails
nothing without the Spirit; How was it, that the Pharisees and the Papists
(whom thou mentionest so often) had not Faith from that Ground? for they all
say, they believe Scripture. But what must we Observe from R. VV.'s Words here?
That the Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith? and yet he will
acknowledge, Christ was before Scripture; and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Abel,
Enoch and Noah had Faith, before Scripture was written. And now, if Christ be
the Author and Finisher of the Saints Faith, and they are to look unto him, I
query, Whether he be Scripture, if it be the Ground of the Saints Faith? And
the Spirit of God, which lead his Saints to give forth Scriptures, leads into
all Truth of them. And the Spirit and the Scriptures are not at Odds one with
another, neither did we ever set them so, as thou us in Effect chargest:
neither can the Children of God know the Scriptures given forth by the Spirit
of God, but by the Spirit of God within (which thou scoffingly call a Secret
Whispering Voice within, contrary to Scriptures.) And the Voice, that owneth
not the Scripture, is not the Voice of the Spirit of God, that gave them forth
both before Christ's Coming in the Flesh and since. And --

R. W. As to the Spirit's Leading into all Truth the Sons of God, thou
answerest and say; Is not Fox here in his Borough, not distinguishing
betwixt the Extra-ordinary Leading of the Holy Apostles appointed to be the
Eyewitnesses of Christ's Death and Resurrection? etc.

Answ. What must we Infer from R. W's. Words? That because the Leading of the
Apostles and Preaching the Resurrection of Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost, that
others therefore were not reproved by the holy Ghost? and must not every Son of
God be led into all Truth to know Christ and his Resurrection? but G. F. does
not say, that all were Messengers and Apostles, etc. (1. Cor. 12.) And thou
^urther say; Yet all God's Children are Regenerated and Sanctified; p. 104.
[and do thou not say in another place, They must have a Combat all their
Life?] and thou say, That God's Children are Guided and Built up together an
Habitation; etc. And then R. W. must not the Spirit of God be within? and if
so, then thou ownest the Quakers Principle, and confessest that, which thou all
this while have been fighting against. And as for what David said, if he had
been in thy Day, thou would have cried against him, as thou do against us,
who said; I have hid thy Word in my Heart.

R. W. And this is the Devil's ( the Old Fox) his Devilish Subtlety, to make
the Cloak of the Spirit's extra-ordinary Assistance, etc. and the Angels
Extra-ordinary Protection a Ground of Christ Jesus and his Servants flinging
themselves down from the Pinnacle of the Temple: and thou pretendest to tell us
from God, that this will be the Break-neck of the People called Quakers
(without Repentance) every Soul of them.

Answ. How now R. W! have thou not here given rash Judgment against the
Assistance, and Protection and Sufficiency of the Spirit of Christ and his
Grace, which God says, is Sufficient to Paul in his Trouble? And have not thou
broken thy own Neck here, and falln down from the Pinnacle, who do not look
at the Grace of God, and his Light and Spirit to be Sufficient? Is it
sufficient to condemn them, that Err from the Spirit, and turn the Grace of
God into Wantonness? And God sent an Angel, and brought the Children of Israel
out of Egypt: and ( Exodus 23, 20.) Behold! I send an Angel before thee, to keep
thee in the Way: (verse. 23.) For my Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee,
etc. and Chap. 22, 24: And behold! my Angel shall go before thee: And was not
this Angel sufficient to bring them into the Land of Canaan, if they hearkened
unto him? and is not Christ Sufficient by his Light, Power and Spirit to bring
us out of Spiritual Egypt? and Christ says to his Sheep, that hear his Voice;
I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shall never perish; neither shall any
man pluck them out of my Hand (John 10, 28.) But R. W. how can thou say, Thou
passest thy false Judgment upon us from the God of Truth; and yet say, There
is no Voice nor Motion within to be lissen'd, or hearkened unto in Heavenly
Things, in Matters that are Super natural? (page 83.)

R W. Thou say; Our Principles and Practices are f^ll of Contradiction and
Hypocrisy.

Answ. Our Principles and Professi^n are Holy and Pure; and Contradictions and
Hyppocrisy thou might have kept at Home: for we Profess the Lord Jesus
Christ, and all the Prophecies and Things in the Law, that Figured them forth;
and the Things in the Law, as truly, as the Prophets and the Apostles did
Profess him: and own all that is Written in the Scriptures from Genesis to
Revelation. And we own the Worship in the Spirit and Truth, and are in it, that
Christ set up Sixteen-hundred Years since; and the Religion, that the Apostle
describes above Sixteen-hundred Years since, which is Pure and Undefiled
before God: And the One Faith, which Christ is the Author of; and the One
Baptism, and the One Spirit into One Body: and One God and Father of All, who
is above All, and through All, and in you All, as the Apostle speaks. And the
Lord Jesus Christ, who was Born of the Virgin, Conceived by the Holy Ghost;
etc. and Preached, and Suffered under Pontius Pilate, before whom he made a
Good Confession: and Died, and Rose again, and is at the Right Hand of God; and
remains in the Heavens, till all things are Restored: etc. who will Judge the
World in Righteousness, and Reward every Man according to his Works; and
therefore no Salvation in any other Name, but in the Name of Jesus, etc. And
let New-England-Professors see, if our Principles and Practice, Life and
Doctrine has not Out-stript theirs; let the Witness of God in them Answer! And
--

R. W. says; He told us of False Gods, and Worships and Prophets, etc. [but
this is nothing to the Purpose to prove his False Charge: for we are Not to
Believe thee and the False Prophets; but to Try them:] but thou say; We must
Try them with Fire it self.

Answ. Yea R. W. Ye and the New-England-Priests did Try us, God's True
Prophets, with FIRE; whom ye Tried with your HOT IRON, when ye BRANDED them,
and your GALLOWS, when you HANGED them: And so ye are TRIED not to be in the
true Principles and Profession of the Apostles and of Christ. And did not
thou say before, That the Scripture was to Try? and what R. W! is the Scripture
now become a FIRE? where is that written? But the Counterfeit, and the Dross,
and the Devil himself, as black a Fiend, etc. the Spirit of Darkness, Samuel's
Mantle, thou speak of, and Sheeps-Cloathing, and Deceiving and Covering your
Black Spirit withal; and then thou say: Thou told'st us, 'Twas Common for
the Papists and Turks; and Judas betraying his Master with a Kiss, and a many
such like Words (but we do remember few:) but this is nothing to prove our
Principles and Profession, what others were. And --

R. W. Thou say; Thou Remembrest, thou told'st us, That Paul tells Timothy
of some, that speak Lies in Hypocrisy; [What is this to us? this is thy own
Condition; this is no Proof:] and of Such, p. 105.
as knowingly ( for Devilish and Wicked Ends, and Preferment and Profit) take
the Leading-Staff in the Hand, etc. and then thou Tell of the Pope's and
Cardinals, and of Judas his Gain, that betrayed Christ, etc. of the Sechemites
and their Successors; of Nebuchadnezar's Idolatry, etc. And further, thou
Tell us of such, that the Lord Jesus Christ has positively foretold of,
that they should think to do God Service, to Kill himself in Killing his
Servants.

Answ. But R. W. gives us no Scripture for this, To Kill himself in Killing
his Servants; (except he means them in New England, that Crucified Christ
first to Themselves, and then Killed his Servants:) but all this is nothing to
us. Here thou do Confess and Wonder, that We bore all this Load of Stories,
which was to no purpose: therefore thou might very well Wonder at their
Patience: but R W. had not W. E. and the rest (which thou scoffingly say,
Broke out) Reason to call thee to prove thy Charge, when thou had run so far
beside the Matter? And we are, as we were, when we First came amongst you. And
--

R. W. Thou say, Thou told'st us, that we were Charged with denying the Man
Christ Jesus. p. 106.
But --

( Answ.) We say, thy Charge is False: For we own Christ, that died at
Jerusalem, more than thou and the New-England-Priests, as we said before; and
there is no such thing neither in G. F.'s nor in any of our Books. And let the
Reader see, whether there be any such Words in G.F.'s Book? It is R.W.'s own
false Charging to prove his Assertions. And our Books hold forth (without
Juggling, as thou Falsely Chargest us) Church-Ministry, Baptism, etc.
Resurrection, Eternal Judgment, Eternal Life now, and in the World to come.

R. W. And thou say; We deny any Church, but that Invisible.

Answ. The Church is in God; but their Bodies are Visible (1 These. 1.) And so
thy Principles are False, and thy Profession, that is not according to the
Apostle's. And that, which keeps us together in the Fellowship and Unity, is
the Spirit; which, as it does Move us, we Pray, we Preach, we Sing, as the Holy
Men of God did, who spoke, as the Spirit of God gave them Utterance: And this
is according to the Primitive Sense, Principle and Profession; though thou
may say Monstrous and Dissimulation. And we do pro^ess we have an Unction;
and Christ enlightneth every one, that comes into the world (and this as in
John 1.2.); and this is according to Sound Principle, and the Profession of the
Holy Men of God: and thou deniest this, and art in a false principle and
profession, contrary to the Apostle's.

R. W. And further thou say, That Christ, and the Spirit, and the Kingdom of
Heaven is in them ( as the Pharisees had, and the very same the Saints have.)

Answ. These are thy false professions and principles, and not ours. But that
which we do profess, we shall manifest; Know ye not, that Christ is in you,
except ye be Reprobates? And, He that has not the Spirit of Christ, is none of
his: And thou that deniest this to the Saints, art of a false principle and
profession, contrary to the Apostle. And Christ said, The Kingdom of Heaven was
in the Pharisees ( Luke 17.); but neither Christ nor We say, That Christ was in
them, as he was in the Saints: and the Pharisees, and their going from, and
hating the Light, which Christ has enlightened them withal, they are condemned
by the Light, and not Justified.

R. W. And then thou Scoffest at the Quakers She-Apostles and He-Apostles sent
into New England, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, p. 107.
and Turkey, etc.

Answ. Yea, they are gone thither, where R. W. and the New-England-Priests
durst not show their Heads (though they may Rail against the Turk and Pope
behind their Backs,) your Spirits are too Cowardly: And by all this thou have
not disproved our principles and profession. And we believe, if R. W. had been
in the Days of the Apostles, he would have joined with the Scribes and
Pharisees against Christ Jesus; and have Railed against Christ and his
Disciples, and against Mary Magdalen and other Women, that preached the
Resurrection of Christ Jesus.

R. W. Thou say, We profess the Scriptures to be the Words of God, and not
the Word ( and therefore We are in a false Principle and Profession.)

Answ. Are we? Is this thy Proof? And does not the Scriptures (which thou
say, is the Rule and Touchstone) themselves call a Declaration the Words of
God and Christ? Nay, do not thou call it an History? And so thou, that
call the Scriptures with other Names, than the Holy Men of God have called
them, thou art in a false profession, not we; who speak otherwise than the
Scripture speaks. And where did ever we say, If all the Scripture was burnt,
we have the Scriptures within us? We charge thee to make this good by any of
our Books or Writings; until then, we look upon thee as one that has Slandered
us to the World: And we abhor thy words, as Burning the Scriptures; and yet we
must not deny Knowing the Scriptures by the Spirit of God within.

R. W. And so thou say, By deceitful Owning and not Owning, as G. F. in his
late Book Exalting the Heathen --

Answ. This is thy false Charge: for we Really Own the Scriptures. And G. F.
Magnifieth the Lord, and Exalts that of God in the Heathen, which was
condemned by such, as thou and the New-England-Priests, that have no Scripture.
As, let the Reader read over the Book called Heathens Divinity, and let him
see, whether he does Exalt the Heathen, or the Lord on their behalf.

R. W. And thou say; How full are their Books against Persecutors.

Answ. And well they may be, for we have felt the stroke of it, even to DEATH
in New England; amongst whom there is manifest, both their Profession and
Principle to be False, and not according to the Primitive Church.

R. W. He brings ( G. F.'s Fol. 170.) John Stallam, saying: [ The Magistrate
is not to level the Law with the Light in every Man's Conscience. Again, If the
Magistrates be in the Light, and discern the Mind of Christ, and discern his
Law, is he to Compel all the Nation and Commonwealth to come to the Practice
of his Light?] G. F. Answers: [The Magistrate of Christ, the Help-Government
for him, he is in the Light and Power of Christ: and he is to subject all under
the Power of Christ into his Light, else he is not a Faithful Magistrate, (to
wit, the Higher Power.) And his Laws are Agreeable, and Answerable according to
that of God in every Man: p. 108.
When men act contrary to it, they do Evil. So he is a Terror to the
Evildoers, and discerns the Precious and the Just from the Vile: and this is
a Praise to them that do well.]

[ I Query of R. W. Whether the Fundamental Laws are not according to the
Spirit of God and Scripture? whether it is not said, The Laws of England hang
upon these two Hinges? and then, Whether Magistrates must not be according to
the Laws? And the Higher Power never did the Prophets cry against, but the
Corruption in Magistrates: neither does G. F. as here was testified in OLIVER's
Days, when these Priests-Opposers said, That we denied Magistrates. But R. W.
Must not the Christian Magistrates be in the Light of Christ? and must they not
punish Evildoers; to wit, Adultery, Fornication, Theft, Murder? etc. and are
not these Actions Contrary to Christ? And then, if they punish these things; do
not they subject unto the Light of Christ? For our Principle is, To bring all
people from those, and other Evils: Or, must not these Evils be punished, and
the Magistrate of the Laws keep down such Evils with his Higher Power? etc. But
what is this to matter of Religion, seeing R. W. says, That they are a Praise
of them that Do Well? Such as Do Well, walk in the Light, and walk in the
Spirit, that mortifieth Sin; and worship God in Spirit and Truth: Such the
Magistrate is a Praise unto, and does not Punish; except they turn their Sword
backward, (as the New-England-Priests) and let Evildoers at Liberty: But more
of this hereafter.] But let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G.
F.'s Answer to John Stallam, That G. F. intends there, p. 139.
that Magistrates, in Christ must fight for their Christ against all Opposers.

Answ. This is R. W.'s false Surmising Charge: but these are the
New-England-Men, that Fight for their Religion and false Christ. But G. F.
says, The Magistrates in the Light are for the punishing of the Evil doers, as
the Apostle says. And will not R. W. have the Christian Magistrates enlightened
by Christ? and to have the Higher Power, that they may punish Drunkards,
Perjurous persons, Whoremongers and Thieves? etc. for such is G. F. speaking
of: he does not speak of Religion, and the worship of God, as the unprejudiced
Reader may see his Words.

R. W. Brings (Fol. G. F. p. 221) Hosannah, etc. saying: [ They know not
Absolute Perfection, that are admitting of Measures and Degrees; or come to the
Day of the Bright Morning Star: and the Bright Morning Star is not Risen.] G.
F. answers [Did not the Apostle speak, that they were Children of the Day,
and the Night was over, and knew the whole Body; and yet said, he would not go
beyond his Measure? and does he not speak of the Stature, and Measure and
Fullness of Christ? were they not come to Perfection* and spoke Wisdom among
them that were Perfect?] And R. W. Replieth, and falls a-Railing (his Wonted
Course) Monstrous Pride, etc. and then thou ask, whether Paul speaks of
his Measure in Holiness, or no?

Answ. What should it be in else? But R. W. is this thy Way to prove thy false
Assertions by asking of Questions? But let R. W. show these Words [ Omnipotent,
Omnipresent, Omniscient] in G. F.'s Book, or any other of our Books, where we
say, That we are in Power Omnipotent, Omnipresent and Omniscient, as he
charge us? And G. F. speaks of the Perfection, that God, and Christ and the
Apostles exhort unto. And thou make a great Story about Perfection; but to no
purpose. And Paul (says he) spoke Wisdom among them that were Perfect; but not
that Wisdom of this World, which denies Perfection. And as for all thy Railing
Expression and Unsavory Language, they are all returned home again to thee;
thou had better, to have kept them within. And where does G. F. say, That a
Child though Perfect, is equal to a Man? or a Cup is equal to a Tun or Pipe? p.
110.
all this thou might have kept at home: this is no Proof against our
Principle and Profession. As for Bl^ckish, Blasphemous Fallacy and
Contradictions R. W. thou might have kept at home thy Railing Expressions,
it does not become thy Gray Hairs; but that the whole Body may be known, which
serve to Complete the Saints into an Entire Stature (see Ephesians. 3, 18, 19. Col.
2, 10. and 4, 12.) and yet here may be a Growth still ( Ephesians. 4.13, 14.)

R. W. brings Hosannah, etc. ( G.F. Fol. p. 222.) saying [Christ is without
his Saints in Respect of his Bodily Presence.] G. F. Answ. [How are they Flesh
of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone? How can they Eat of his Flesh, and Drink
his Blood? And how have they his Mind and Spirit, and he in them, and they in
him? and sitting in Heavenly Places? And he is the Head of his Church; and how
then is he Absent, ye poor Apostates from him, that feel not Christ! But he is
with the Saints, and they feel him.] And R. W. replieth, and asks; Is this
Eating of the Flesh of Christ, and Drinking his Blood Corporal (or Visible) or
Spiritual?

Answ. Why! Do not thou know R. W. Christ says, His Words are Spirit and
Life? And is this thy Proving, when to prove thy Charges, thou art asking
Questions? We tell thee, None can eat the Flesh of Christ without Faith. And
thou further Beggest Questions concerning a sitting in Heavenly Places in
Christ Jesus: We tell thee, the Apostle speaks, We sit together in Heavenly
Places in Christ Jesus ( Ephesians. 2.) and, He that Sanctifies, and they that are
Sanctified, are all of One (the Hebr. tells thee.) And we hold, that Christ
is the Head of the Church, as the Apostle did; and we do not direct you to the
Pope: But we bid you, Repent, and turn you from Darkness to Light, and so to
Christ; whom ye must come to know, Christ the Head. And did not the Heavens
open, so that Steven saw Christ by the Holy Ghost, at the Right Hand of God?
And what Body was that, that some did Eat (as the Apostle says) as ate and
drank Unworthily, nor discerning the Lord's Body? and then must not the Lord's
Body be discerned by True Believers? and was not this after Christ was
Ascended? And the Ground of R. W. and the persecuting Priests is, They would
neither have Christ, nor his Light to be within them; nor to feed upon his
Heavenly Bread, which comes from Heaven, which he calls his Flesh; nor drink
his Blood, which is the Saints Food, upon which they Live. And the Jews said of
Christ, How can we eat his Flesh? and so persecuted the Apostles, which were of
his Flesh and Bones.

R. W. falls a railing, and says; An Adulterous Wretch accuses Joseph of
Whoredom, etc. who was a Pattern of pure and holy Chastity: p. 111.
For, whom do these Whorish Brood of Foxians brand for Apostates, and fling
among them Firebrands, Arrows and Death?

Answ. This is R. W.'s and his New-England-Priests and Professors Condition; he
might well have kept this at home, who is Adulterated from the Light and Spirit
of Christ Jesus, and calls it an Idol. And now flingeth his and their
Firebrarnds at such, as be in the Purity and holy Chastity of Joseph, against
the Children of God, whom we are. That Spirit in the Whorish Egyptians, the
Whorish Jews, you the Whorish New England Men and R. W. casts his Firebrarnds
after us; but that, which the New-England-Professors BRANDED them withal, their
Marks are to be seen this Day! And these Railing Expressions do not prove R.
W.'s Assertion; but prove his own Principles false, and his Profession Railing.
And the Souls under the Altar, those that kept the Testimony of Jesus, as we
have done against Deluders (as thou speak of) and the First Churches, and
the Apostles of Christ, they did not call the Light of Christ an Idol; but they
saw Christ, who was Ascended into Heaven, and yet was manifest in them by his
Spirit. And the Apostle says, They came to sit down in Heavenly Places in
Christ Jesus (though he was Ascended into Heaven;) and was not this in Spirit?
And --

R. W. thou say, They mean no such Individual Man or Person, but a Mind and
Spirit; and such a Christ, as has no Individual, Bodily Presence, as we and
all men have.

Answ. Christ has no such Sinful Body, as all men have; If so, I would have R.
W. prove it by Scripture. But does not the Apostle say, He is made like unto
us, Sin excepted? But that by R. W. is left out; he would have his a
Corruptible Body, as himself (as we shall see hereafter, whether he does not
maintain Christ to have a Corruptible Body.) But we query of R. W. whether it
is not the Work of him (and all those Priests, that Opposed us in Oliver's
Days) to shut Christ and his Spirit, his Light and his Presence out from the
Saints? as is clearly seen: as one of these Priests Scoffingly and Carnally
said, How can a Man of four foot long be within us? And this is false for thee
to say, That we would have all the Saints of God to be Apostates, and fall from
God and Christ: Paul says, Christ is a Mystery; and so he is a Mystery still
to them, to whom he is not Revealed. And --

R. W. Thou say, If of G. F. when he is in New England, one should say, He
is in London in his Bodily Presence, and that his Friends feel'd his Bodily
Presence there, because they feel his Love and Affections there in their Minds
and Spirits, etc.

Answ. Is this a fit Comparison R. W? Does not the Apostle say of Christ, That
He is Ascended above All, that he might fill All? etc. and does not the Apostle
say, That they, that have no^ the Spirit of Christ, are none of his? And is not
he called the Heavenly Man? and is not he, as he is called the Heavenly Man,
the Head of the Church? is not he called the Second Man, the Lord from Heaven?
and the Apostle says; As we have born the Image of the Earthly, we shall bear
also the Image of the Heavenly: and now, The Saints shall bear the Image of the
Heavenly; my Query is, Whether Christ must bear the Image of the Earthly in
Heaven? (1 Cor. 15.) And --

R. W. Thou say, I will turn my Thoughts higher: O thou most Glorious Sun of
Righteousness, Truth and Holiness! shine forth, and let it be seen, how the
Devil calls the Lord Jesus Beelzebub.

Answ. But R. W. Do not thou Call the Lord Jesus Christ an Idol and a
Frantic Light? THOU art the Man. And do not thou say (in this page) his
People are Horrible, Egyptian, Canting (Languague,) Juggling, Whorish Brood,
Adulterous wretches, Whoredom, Firebrarnds? so thy High Thoughts are in the
Dirt; not fit, to take the Name of the Lord Jesus in thy Mouth. And --

R. W. Thou say, They boast with the Bloody Papists, and other Traitors and
Rebels against thee.

Answ. This thou might have applied to thy self and the New-England-Priests,
for it is thy own: for we have shed none of your BLOOD, the Lord knows it!
And when did we break down your Altars? and Burn your Temples and your Altars?
etc. R. W. Is not all this a false Profession and a false Principle? and is
this to prove our Profession and Principles full of Contradiction and
Hypocrisy? This is thy own Profession. And we do Challenge all you
New-England-Professors and Priests, what Altars have we broke down? and what
Temples have we burnt? etc? this is a Lying Spirit R. W. that leads thee, not
the Spirit of Christ.

R. W. Thou say, They cry up a false and Hellish Christ within them, p. 112.
etc. Christen him with the Name of Light.

Answ. R. W. Thou can not tell, how to invent Wicked Words enough against
the Lord Jesus Christ, that Died at Jerusalem, and is Risen, at the Right Hand
of God; who enlightneth every Man, that Comes into the World: surely, thy
Spirit would have Roared against the Apostle, if thou had been in his Day.
Now it is clear, thou neither ownest Scriptures, nor Christ there: And instead
of proving our Principles and Profession false, thou manifestest thy own to be
Wicked; and not so Wicked against us, but against the Lord Jesus Christ and his
Light, which he Lights every Man, that Comes into the World, withal. For (I
say) if thou had been in the Apostle's Days, he Preached Christ within the
Hope of Glory; and his Work was To present every Man Perfect in Christ Jesus:
and the Apostle said and told them, Christ was in them, except they were
Reprobates: and Christ said, I in you, and you in Me, etc. and prayed the
Father, That where he was, there they might be to behold his Glory: And what
do thou think, the Saints must behold his Glory now? And this Christ thou
call False and a Hellish Christ: O Wickedness! thou will find him a Heavy
Stone! Nay, do not thou call him a Conquered Slave? an Angel of Light? art
thou not worse than the Jews, that Crucified him, and Pilate? did they ever
give him such Names, as thou have done the Only Begotten Son of God? is this
thy N. England-Profession of the Only Begotten Son of God full of Grace and
Truth, which is manifest in his People? the LORD DELIVER all good Christians
from them! For we can expect no other Work, but what they have done (if R. W.
and their Principles be one concerning Christ Jesus, the Holy One of Israel)
but to HANG, BANISH, and WHIP, and BRAND with an HOT IRON, and SPOIL the GOODS
of the Members and Followers of Christ Jesus! Surely, all their Consciences are
not so seared with an Hot Iron, as R. W.'s is against the True Lord Jesus
Christ; who casts a Flood of Wickedness against him and his Light: but we
expect no other, it is nothing to us.

R. W. Brings James Brown, that says, [ The Kingdom of Heaven that is in the
Saints, is not in the Pharisees. (Fol. G. F. p. 259.] G. F. Answ. [That which
is in the Saints, is in the Pharisees in a Measure, though it be but as a Grain
of Mustard Seed, or as a Little Leaven: (But this is fully Answered in the
Append. where he brings it there.) And R. W. Replieth, and brings ( Luke
11.12.) Christ's Saying, If I by the Finger of God cast out Devils, no doubt,
the Kingdom of God is come upon you: And this R. W. Maliciously brings to
Oppose Christ's Words cited, when the Pharisees demanded of Christ, When the
Kingdom should come? he answered them and said; The Kingdom of Heaven comes
not with Observations, neither shall they say, Lo here, or Lo there: for
behold, the Kingdom of God is within you, (Luke 17.) Now, whether must we
believe Christ or R. W? And this he brings to Disprove our Principles and
Profession not to be True; and has here manifest his own Profession and
Principle not to be according to Christ. And --

R. W. Thou say, That the Pharisees expected a Temporal Kingdom: and yet
thou say, Christ's Visible Kingdom is his Church. And the Apostle tells
thee, His Kingdom stands in Power, etc. and the Holy Ghost; and what is
Visible, but Temporal? And we do not say, That the Pharisees had such a Kingdom
as the Saints, in Joy and Peace with the Holy Ghost; for their Darkness could
not comprehend the Light, therefore they were not like to receive such a
Kingdom. And what Kingdom was this in the Pharisees, if it was not a Measure of
the Seed, which Christ Sows in all Grounds, and of the Spirit, and of the
Light, which enlightneth every man that comes into the World?

R. W. And whereas thou Scoffingly say, What do We talk of Measures, but
that We are all one in Quality and Equality? etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such Words in G. F.'s Answer? R. W.
cannot bridle his Tongue, and keep in the Rule. But --

R. W. Thou say, What a Stinking Work do these proud Pharisees make of
Christianity! how justly, etc.

Answ. This R. W. might have applied at home, his Stinking Work and proud
Pharisees, etc. What! must not we own Christ's words, nor Scripture? Were not
they Fools, blind Guides and Pharisees, that would not own Christ's Doctrine?
and so it may be said Still of R. W.

R. W. Asks the Reason, Why this Seed does not Grow, and this Leaven does not
Spread within the Pharisees? Can a Nation be Subject to the King of England or
Spain, p. 113.
etc. and yet not know how? nor have no Knowledge or Feeling of it at all? Can
there be such a God, such a Spirit, such a Fire, ^ea, but such a Mustard Seed
or Leaven, such a Teacher, and yet not grow, not prevail, nor prosper, nor be
perceived? ye Fools and Blind! And so goes on a-railing to the end of page 113.

Answ. Here thou have manifest thy self to be as Blind as the Pharisees,
concerning the Doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven within, as Christ preached.
For is it not the same Seed, that is sown upon all Sorts of Grounds by the
Seeds-Man; though Christ tell^th thee, Ye are Thorns and Stony Hearts, and what
ye do to the Seed? And is it not the same Light, that enlightneth every man
that comes into the World, which the Saints believed in; which Thou, and the
Pharisees and the New-England-Professors hate, and thou call an (...)? So
thy principle and profession is False, and not agreeable to the Primitive
profession and principle.

And is not the same Grace, which brings Salvation, appeared to All Men,
which the Wicked turn into Wantonness, and walk despitefully against it? And is
not the same Spirit, which is poured out upon All Flesh, by which the Sons and
Daughters Prophesy? etc. but if thou quenchest the Spirit, and turnest the
Grace of God into Wantonness, and the Carnal Mind choke the Seed, and err from
the Spirit, then thou may say; Why does it not Grow? Why does not Leaven
Spread? Why does it not Spring? Why don't it Grow? and, Why are they not
Subjects to the King? and yet thou art building the Tombs of the Righteous. And
all such, that err from the Spirit, turn the Grace of God into Wantonness, and
hate his Light, and by their Carnal Mind choke the Seed, and are Rebels to the
Kingdom of Heaven: and go, read the Talent of the Slothful Servant. However,
thou have improved the Devil's Talent, and hidden the Lord's, thou and the
New-England-Priests; and therefore ye persecute him with your Tongue and Hand:
and a many Unsavory Words, that are in this page, which are not worth
mentioning. And so in all this thou have proved thy self not to have the Spirit
of Christ Jesus; but an Opposer of his Doctrine, and proved thy own profession
and principle False, and contrary to Christ's and the Apostle's words.

R. W. Thou say, That the Quakers Religion is Heresy, p. 114.
and they themselves Heretics in the Matters of God's Worship.

Answ. The Religion we maintain, which the Apostles above 1600. years since set
up, which is Pure, etc. and therefore we forsake yours. And the Worship of God,
which Christ set up 1600. years ago, this we in Practice maintain: and we do
not differ from the Servants of God, the Prophets and Apostles; but we have
Unity with them in the Faith and Spirit of God, Glory to the Lord God for ever!
And we believe, we Shall prove thee in the Heresy thou speak of; which thou
confessest, John Stub stood up and said, That Heresy was defined by some, to be
an Opinion obstinately stood in against the First Christian Purity: and this
thou confessest too. First thou say R. W. That our Religion, Way or Sect was
False, etc. and upon this Ground R. W. will prove, Our Religion is not only
Heresy in Matters of Worship, but also in Doctrines of Repentance, Faith, etc.
Now come on R. Williams, make good thy Charge, and see, if thou have not thrown
thy self in the same Condition, as thou chargest us.

R. W. Thou say, First, as to Worship We deny the Converting or Gathering of
Saints into Visible Congregations, affirming the Church to be Invisible, the
Ministry Invisible, the Baptism and Supper Invisible.

Answ. Let the People in New-Eng^and Judge, whether we do not Gather people
into Visible Assemblies? let their Meetings there speak. And though we do say,
as the Apostle says (1 These. 1.2. 2 These. ^.) The Church is in God the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ; yet the Saints Bodies were Visible upon the Earth:
and thou that deniest this Doctrine, deniest this Primitive Doctrine; and so
hold another Opinion, than the Apostles did: And the Ministers of Christ are
Ministers of the Spirit, though their Bodies be Visible, while they be upon
Earth. And we never said, That Outward Assemblies, or Outward Men, which did
eat Outward Bread and Wine, (which is Visible) were Invisible; this is a Lying
Charge from a Lying Spirit: But the Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with the
Spirit, which is the Baptism of Christ, we charge R. W. and his
New-England-Priests to prove that Visible, and by Scripture. But whom has R.
W. Converted in New England? who are his Assembly? if he cannot show them, his
Epistles, as the Apostles could, then he is gone away from the Institutions of
the Lord Jesus Christ and his Messengers, etc. and comes under his own Charge,
and not we: And where is the Assembly of R. W.'s, and with whom? And we tell R.
W. that he must come to Repentance from his Dead Works, and Faith toward God,
before he comes to know the Christians true Religion. And whereas --

R. W. speaks of the Two Doctrines of Laying on of Hands, and of Baptismes,
concerning the Circumstances of which God is pleased to permit his Children
lovingly differing and discussing, etc.

Answ. If these things, Baptism, Laying on of Hands, etc. Anointing with Oil
and Washing the Saints Feet be laid aside and practiced not by R. W. and his
New-England-Priests, and if that were Institutions, and delivered by Christ and
his Apostles for practice in worship or doctrine to be held up in the Church;
Then if you be gone from the practice of these things, then are you fallen and
gone away from the Institutions of the Lord Jesus Christ delivered by him, his
Apostles and Messengers, and so fallen into that, which thou chargest the
Quakers with: and so proved thy self a HYPOCRITE, to Charge others with Neglect
of that, which thou do not practice thy self.

R. W. Thou say; Repentance, it was an Heavenly and Saving Work of God upon
the Soul, etc. and it was preached by Moses and the Prophets, p. 115
by John Baptist, by Christ Jesus and his Apostles, Luke 24. And Christ sent
his Apostles to preach the Gospel to all Nations, etc.

Answ. This disproveth R. W.'s Charges against us. For as the Lord has
commanded us to preach Repentance, yea, in New England (as the people well
knows) yea, and to himself (as he has confessed) and to other Nations; but he
and his New England Priests, like a Company of Hard-hearted Jews, stopped their
Ears to it. But does R. W. and the New-England-Priests go into all Nations, and
preach Repentance and the Gospel according to his own Charge? if not, he and
the New-England-Priests are gone away from the First Institution of Christ, his
Apostles and Messengers; and your Repentance is no more than the Papists thou
speak on, who remain in your Persecuting Spirit Unrepented of. So it is no
true Repentance: and your principle and profession is no sound principle or
profession, whilst thou would have God's people PVNISHED; and the New England
Priests Persecute them: Those Christians, that are come to true Repentance,
they Love one another, and they Love Enemies; and their Repentance is beyond
yours, and the Scribes and Pharisees, which do Persecute. So it is clear, that
thine and the New England Professor's Repentance is no true Repentance, whose
Hands are full of BLOOD and Cruelty, and whose Tongue is full of Persecution.
And --

R. W. Thou say; The Protestants protested against this Repentance of the
Papists and Quakers.

Answ. And why against the Papists? but is it not clear, that R. W.'s and his
New-England-Priests and Professors Repentance is but like the Papists, Readiness,
Ahab's and Pharaoh's, and the Philistians and Judas's? For have not ye
Protestants in New^England manifested your Swords and Staves against the people
of God called Quakers, that have warned you to Repent? and HANGED, BVRNT with
an HOT IRON, CVT OFF EARS and SPOILED the GOODS of the people of God? and your
Repentance is not come so far as Judas's was, to make Restitution of the GOODS
you have SPOILED. And because R. W. lives under a Government, where he cannot
have the Magistrates to punish us; yet he says, he desires, that we might be
punished: So it seems, he wants Magistrates; yet we must be Punished, though
it be in Matter of Conscience. But Christ and the Apostles give him no such
Command: and therefore his Repentance is a false Repentance; and he is out of
the Spirit, that Christ and the Apostles were in, which was to Love Enemies,
and Overcome Evil with Good, if there were such a thing. And it is plain (and
true) that the Church of New England is the Whore, because the BLOOD of the
Saints is found in her: But God will reward her, and them that are in her and
cry her up! And --

R. W. Thou say; For all their Craking of Fear and Trembling* etc. there
has appea^ed no Sense of Godly sorrow, etc. and Brokenness of Heart in them
for their Sinful Nature, etc. but immediately upon their Bowing down to Satan,
p 116.
and Owning him as a Light, and Christ and Spirit within, etc.

Answ. R. W. Thou in the Spirit of Horrid Blasphemy against Christ, his Spirit
and Light within art not like to be Sensible of our Sorrows and Brokenness of
Heart! And here have not thou manifest thy self an Vn-repented Man, worse than
Judas? For did ever Judas or the Papists, nay the Turks call the Lord Jesus
Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of the Father (who is full of Grace and Truth, R.
W. is turned an Atheist.
who says himself, he is the Light of the World) did they ever call Christ,
and his Light and his Spirit Satan? and they, that Bowed down to Christ, a
Bowing down to Satan? O Blasphemer! what an Age of Darkness and Blasphemy are
the New-England-Priests come into, that hold ^orth such a Doctrine! And here is
it not clear (let all that fear God, see) how R. W. is Degenerated, and his
New-England-Priests (if this be their Doctrine) from the Doctrine of the
Apostle, as he falsely charge the Quakers? For the Apostle turned people from
Darkness to Light, etc. (this he confessed in his Examination, as may be seen
in the Acts) and opened the Eyes of the Blind, etc. and after that he had
preached Christ's Death and Resurrection, and at the Right Hand of God, and
many come to believe, he preached Christ within them, except they be
Reprobates; and told them, that the Light that shined in their Hearts, gave
them Knowledge. And so thou go on with many false Accusations; which are
Answered in other places. And --

R. W. Thou say, Why should they say Thee and Thou to the Aged, Learned,
Holy and High?

Ans. This R. W. brings, that we are gone from the Institutions of Christ and
his Apostles (as in page 114); but we Charge R. W. and the New-England-priests,
where Christ and the Apostles instituted, that we should say YOU to a Single
person? But who are these Learned, Holy and High? Is it R. W. and his
New-England-priests, that set themselves in the place of God, and call
themselves Holy and High? but it is himself* that is the Aged. And was not our
patience manifest, in bearing thy Cankcred Spirit, which uttered forth all
these railing words against us, let the people Judge?

R. W. And thou say, Why should they not s^t Silent? even Scores and
Hundreds of them ( possessed with a dumb Spirit) as in a Form and Order of
Christian worship, waiting for the Spirit.

Answ. R. W. Had better been Silent, who has brought forth such an Evil work;
and to have VVaited upon Christ, as we do, who speak, as the Spirit gives us
Utterance. Which was the practice of the Church of the primitive Times, which
thou art erred from; and now scoffingly call Dumb Spirit, because thy
Railing Spirit were not fed with words according to thy Will. And this is a
False Charge of thine [ We wait for the Spirit] But we VVait for the
Signification and Motion of the Spirit; for the Holy men of God spoke, as they
were Moved by the Holy Ghost: But thou say, There is no Voice nor Motion
within, that is to be turned to, lissen'd to, or hearkened to in Heavenly
Things (as page 83.) And now, Is not R. VV. gone into the Darkness, and from
the Way of all the Holy Prophets, and Holy Apostles, and Holy Men of God, that
Spoke, when they were Moved by the Holy Ghost? And is not R W. in the Steps of
the Jews, that Christ speaks to, that had neither heard the Voice of the
Father at any time, nor seen his Shape?

R. W. Thou say, The Protestants both English, French and Dutch have
manifested against the Papists, and therein against the Quakers, That
Repentance is a Turning of the whole Soul from all Sin as Sin to all of God, as
God.

Answ. What must we infer from his words in this place? If that R. W. and his
New-England-Priests and others be Turned so from all Sin by the Repentance to
God as God, that they are as Pure as God, as Holy as God, as Righteous as God?
and yet he finds Fault with this in the Quakers? But we must try R. W. by his
Fruits, and his Protestants, (especially in New England) if their Repentance
and his be not like to the Papists? and how dare R. W. speak of this
Repentance, when he Blasphemeth so much against the Light of Christ, and
calls it an Idol and a Frantic Light? But that which he casts upon us, is
come upon himself; who like the Pharisees of Old their Conversion and Sin is
from one Sin to another: and their Swelling Pride of a Dropsy and Tympany,
etc. (as he scoffingly speaks of) of his Conceited Faith, Repentance,
Justification, Sanctification, Mortification, etc. all this he might have
applied at home, and to his New-England-Priests, who all along proves himself
and his New England Professors to be the very people in the things, he Charge
upon us. And it were well, if ye could see nothing, but Hell and Damnation in
your selves, as thou speak of! but this ye cannot See, until ye come to the
Spirit and Light of Christ, which thou call Blasphemously an Idol and a
Fancy: and therefore art not like to See the true Savior, the Lord Jesus
Christ and his Light. And thou say --

R. W. How do they Superciliou^^y and Pope-like belch out as from Hell, God, I
thank thee, that I am not like these Publicans. p 117.


Answ. R. W. and his New-England-Priests might have kept this at home, with his
superciliou^^y, as he calls it (if he had found such a word in G. F.'s Book,
he would have roared and made some work at it, and shown it in print:) but
Roger has not hit our Conditions, but himself. And --

R. W. Thou say: How instantly do they rail, revile, condemn and curse,
breath out Fire, etc. as Fire and Brimstone from the mountains in Sicily, etc.
against all that oppose them; far from the Teaching of Christ and his first
Messengers, as Lambs, etc.

Answ. Let the Sober Reader look in R. W.'s Book and see, how he Condemns
himself and his Practice. But how does R. W. Rail against the Papists and
Mahomet, yea, Protestants too, as Formal! and has not R. W. and his
New-England-Priests done more than Breathing out Fire from the Mountains of
Sicily, who have Hanged, and Burnt with an Hot Iron? O! he and they might shame
(if they had any in them) thus to upbraid the People of God called Quakers, and
to tell them, they be in Cain's Nature, and Core's and Balaam's, and the
Pharisees, and Jezabel's and the Whore's, that drinks the Blood of the
Saint's, when Y^ have done it; and persecute for Religion, like Nebuchadnezar:
this is not Railing. And to tell R. W. when he calls the Light of Christ an
Idol and a Fancy, and tellest him, he is a Blasphemer; this is not Railing: And
when R. W. says, A Bowing to Christ his Light and Spirit is a Bowing to Satan,
(as in page 116.) to tell him, he is a Blasphemer against Christ's Light and
Spirit; this is not Railing. But we do not matter, what he and the
New-England-Priests say against us: but it wounds our Souls and Spirits, to
hear the Son of God, in whom he is well pleased, to be thus blasphemed by such,
that falsely calls himself a Christian! And Christ did not Rail, when he cried
Woe against the Blind Scribes and Pharisees, calling them Whited Walls, and
said, They were of their Father the Devil: nor the Apostles, who called such as
he, Evil Beast and Slow-Bellies, and cried Woe against such, as went into the
Way of Cain. Neither did they Rail against Elymas and Simon the Sorcerer, which
Spoke Truth unto them. But thou, that give us Names, to the Lambs and
Children of God, and have no Motion within of Heavenly things of Supernatural
Light, art degenerated from the Spirit and Practice, the Saints were in in the
Primitive Times: I and J. B. do maintain and preach true Repentance toward
God, and Faith in Christ Jesus, as the Apostles did. And thou say, He
continued above half an hour, though not so long as W. Edmondson in preaching
this Doctrine: But why did not set it down? and thou confessest, They
delivered many holy Truths of God ( p. 119)

R. W. Thou go about to Prove, Our Faith is False.

Answ. But we shall see, if R. W. has not proved his own and his New England
Priests and professors Faith contrary to Christ's and the Apostles, and the
Faith of God's Elect, which Christ Jesus is the Author and Finisher of. And is
not R. W. erred from this Doctrine and Faith, who maintains with Fr. Duke,
The Scripture to be the Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints? (page 102,
103, 104.) and so erred from the Apostles in the Primitive Times, who said,
Look unto Jesus, the Ground, Author and Finisher of Faith: He did not bid them,
Look to the Scripture, the Ground, Author and Finisher of Faith; but to Christ.
And --

R. W. thou say, That thou would demonstrate by Instances out of G. F.'s
Book all along, that he confounded and made all one both Faith and
Justification, etc. and made Believing in Christ but a mere Babel; p. 118.
and fallest a- railing, because that G. F. says, He that has Faith, has
Repentance, has Justification, Sanctification, etc.

Answ. But do not thou Confound thy self? for thou say, That Repentance is
a Turning of the whole Soul from all Sin as Sin to all of God as God (as this
is R. W.'s Form of Words:) and yet R. W. have not they then, that have
Repentance, Faith, Justification and Sanctification? And G. F.'s words are, He
that has Faith, has Repentance: Can any have Faith without Repentance? or any
Justification without Repentance and Faith? or any have Sanctification without
Repentance and Faith? and thou would have Justification and Sanctification
without Faith and Repentance; Thou may keep thy Babel to thy self. And Christ
Jesus, that preached Repentance, says, Believe in the Light, that you may
become Children of Light: and this Light thou call an Idol and a Fancy; and
so have plainly manifest, thou art no true Believer in the Lord Jesus Christ,
nor true Christian: and who would have Faith, Justification and
Sanctification without Repentance, have neither true Faith, Justification,
Sanctification. And so as for Babel, Nonsense, Confusion, Monstrous thou may
keep at home.

R. W. And thou say, Thou told'st us, that we and the Papists talk of Faith,
and G. F. talked much of Faith.

Answ. As for the Papists Faith, thou and the New-England-Priests might have
applied at home. But for the Saints Faith, it is the True, which Jesus Christ
is the Author of: and we have received it from him, and not from Men. And thou
in disproving our Faith, thou have proved thy self out of the True Faith in
Christ, which thou opposest.

R. W. And so thou say, They have put out the True and Living Faith; and have
put in a painted or Glass-eye in the Room of it.

Answ. This is thy own condition, who deniest the Faith in Christ Jesus, that
he is the Author and Finisher of: Which in all this Work thou go about to
overthrow, but thou can not.

R. W. And thou say, True Faith is Receiving of Christ Jesus as only King,
Priest and Prophet: it is believing on and receiving of Christ distinct from
God, Joh. 14. And, This true Lord Jesus Christ the Quakers turn into a mere
Fiction, Dream or Imaginary Christ in the Mind of Man, etc. And thou fall'st
a-railing, and tellest us, We are like the Papists, and say; The Quakers
Transubstantiation is worse, then the Fantastic Transubstantiation of the
Papists.

Answ. How can R. W. receive Christ Jesus as a Priest, King and Prophet, and
believe in him, who call'st the True Light of Christ an Idol, which John bore
Witness unto? Or be a Believer, as Christ Commanded and said, Be a Believer in
the Light; and he calls this Light a Fancy? So no Believer in the True
Christ, nor no Receiver of Christ, King, Priest and Prophet. Neither is R. W.
in the True Faith, which Christ Jesus is the Author and Finisher of, who
maintains, The Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints; yet
he says, Christ is before Scripture: And he confesses, that Abel, Enoch, Noah,
Abraham, etc, had Faith before Scriptures; and again he says, That true Faith
is Receiving of Christ. But let R. W. and his New-England-Priests prove by
Scripture, That God (the Creator of all things) and the true Lord Jesus Christ,
his Son (whom we believe in according to Scripture, as the Prophets and
Apostles did) can be turned into a Fiction and Dream: let him make this
Blasphemy good by Scripture, if he can. And R. W. who calls himself Orator,
did the Apostles turn Christ into an Imaginary Christ, Dream and Fiction, when
they preached Christ in you, except ye be Reprobates? and is this Worse, than
the Papists Transubstantiation? prove this by Scripture: And thou art
degenerated and the New-England-Priests (if this be their Doctrine and
Preaching) of Christ and the Apostles in the Primitive Times.

R. W. And then thou say, that we say, All Spirit, and no Body; and so not
consisting of Flesh and Spirit: and yet thou contradictest thy self and say,
We are of his flesh, etc, And then thou fall'st a-railing, and thou say, That
we say, All must die and rot, and never rise again (and say) So you have
blown up and Juggled away the Flesh of Christ Jesus, both his and your own
altogether. And further thou say, We can give no Account of the Flesh of the
Man Christ Jesus: and thou fallest a-railing.

Answ. Do not thou see, how thou Contradictest thy self? but instead of
proving thy false Charge, thou have uttered forth many more false Charges.
Where did ever we say in any of our Books, That we shall not rise again, or,
That Christ is not risen? The same that Descended, is the same that is
Ascended, and at the Right Hand of God: did not we confess this before thee at
Newport? and yet thou Wickedly say, That we can give no Account of; when we
gave Account according to Scripture, as the Apostle says. And did not we say,
that we believe the Resurrection, as the Apostle did? and as we have born the
Image of the Earthly, so we shall bear the Image of the Heavenly? 1 Cor. 15.

R. W. And thou say, The Quakers, which grant Christ Jesus to have been born,
lived and died, as we, etc. [and here thou overthrowest thy Babel of false
Charges:] And then thou Contradictest thy self and say, p. 119.
And yet now Transubstantiated into a Spirit and the Quakers Flesh; so that in
the upshot the Christ, in whom they believe, is vanished ( by an Hellish
Chemistry) into themselves, etc.

Answ. R. W. How far art thou degenerated from the Apostles Doctrine! did the
Apostles say so, when they preached Christ within and said, They were Flesh of
his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone? And Christ says, Except ye eat my Flesh, and
drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you, etc. and would thou keep us from our
Heavenly Food, by which we have Life? And art not thou worse then the Jews,
that loaded the Manna from Heaven, who addest Lie unto Lie to prove thy false
Charge? but the Father of Lies has set thee at Work, and the Day will come,
when Christ will reward thee, who Blasphemest him!

R. W. And thou say, They do believe on themselves, and that lying Spirit
within them.

Answ. R. W. Thou can not speak Truth, thou art not like indeed: this is
another false Charge. For we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, as he has
taught and the Apostles, and deny Our selves and thy Lying Spirit within thee.
And we know thy condition, where thou art and the New-England-Priests, better
than thy self: and if you had been good, we would not have forsaken you. And --

R. W. Confessed, That J. B. had delivered many Holy Truths of God: and yet
thou say, At this there was a deep Silence, a^ If I had turned a Proselite;
at least it pleased them to be applauded.

Answ. Nay, R. W. we saw the Subtilty of the Serpent in thee: And if I B. had
spoken many Holy Truths, why did thou not join with them? it seems, thy
spirit could not join with Holy Truths. And then thou speak of Repentance,
and Being saved by the Blood of Christ Jesus, and of Living soberly and
righteously: Then how comes all this Ungracious Language from thee, if thou
art to live soberly and righteously? these are but Words R. W. And how can
thou be Saved by the Blood of Christ and Repent, and not believe in the Light,
as Christ commands, by which thou must see thy Sin and Evil Heart? And so
thou have proved thy Faith and Repentance to be Antichristian, and not at all
disproved ours. And so thy Faith and Repentance may go along with the Papists,
as thou speak of, who opposest the Faith of God's Elect, that purifieth
their hearts: and that is thy false Faith, that purifieth not the heart.

R. W. And thou scoffingly say, That we might have preached (to wit, I B.
and I S.) this Doctrine of Faith and Repentance before the Pope at Rome at his
Chapel.

Answ. Here R. W. scoffeth at True Faith and Repentance, and makes himself
unsensible of it: but its very well, he has manifested himself to be so much
One with them, and the New England Professors. But some of us have preached
Repentance and the Faith of Christ at Rome (where neither he, nor his
New England Priests dared to show their Heads) and suffered there Death for it;
though thou and the New-England-Priests may rail at them behind their Backs.
And so thou might have applied at home the Sayings of the Lord Jesus Christ,
Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniquity, I know you not: whose Light thou
call an Idol.

R. W. And thou say, Thou had intended to Charge us with the Falseness of
our Hope, Love, Peace and Joy, which they often Crake (thou say, p. 120
etc.) their Heaven consists, and all the Eternal Life to come they look for,
they are now in present and full Possession of.

Answ. Why did not R. W. do it there, what he Intended? But where does R. W.
prove these Lies, That our Heaven, etc. and all the Eternal Life, that is to
come, that we say, We are now in present full Possession of it? he has brought
no Proof for these his Lies. From the Seed, which Christ has sown in their
hearts, some brings forth Thirty, Sixty, Hundredfold in this Life, and in
the World to come Life Eternal: So these Words of his we turn back as R. W.'s
forged Lies. And as for true Love, Hope and Faith, he and his
New-England-Priests have banished that long ago.

R. W. Thou say, What Scripture is more Common in their Mouths and Pens, etc.
than Col. ^. Christ in you, the Hope of Glory? Whereby they insinuate Two of
their grand Deceits and Lies. 1. That there is no other Christ, but what is in
every Man in the World: 2. That there is no other Glory to be hoped for, or by
or with the Lord Jesus Christ, but what is in the Saints, etc.

Answ. The Reader may see R. W.'s Contradiction here in this very Scripture:
but still he is forging Lies, which we never heard of a fore. Christ in you,
the Hope of Glory; Mark, of Glory: And are not the Saints to grow up in the
knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ unto a Perfect Man? and do not our Writings,
and has not our Mouth and Pens declared it? So as for Deceits, thou might
have kept this at home. But R. W. and the Rest of the Priests, which G. F. has
brought, could not endure to hear of Christ Within us, the Hope of Glory; but
ye would only have him Without, and so keep people in the Reprobate State. And
how can R. W. have him Within, when he calls his Light an Idol and a Fancy?
And So R. W. thou tell of Hopes like unto Spiders; but this thou might
have applied to thy self with the Hope of the Hypocrite, not to us.

R. W. And R. W. thou say, Do they not overthrow the very Nature of Hope,
which they prate of, and give the Spirit of God the Lie, which tells us, That
Hope is not of things in Possession, etc. (Romans 9.)

Answ. When did we tell to R. W. this Lie? he has forged it himself. And so as
for a Dead and Painted Hope thou might have kept thy self; for our Hope,
which is Christ, makes not ashamed: for we are Saved by Hope. But Hope that is
seen, is not Hope, etc. (Romans 8.) But R. W. brings Romans 9: but let the Reader
see, if there be the Word Hope in the Chapter. But the Living Hope (as Peter
speaks of) we witness (1 Pet. 2, 3.) We, whom Christ has begotten again to a
Lively Hope, ou^ Faith and Hope stands in God; and Christ our Hope of Glory
ankers our Immortal Souls, (see Col. and Hebr.) And our Hope is Steadfast, that
keeps us above all the Waves, and Storms and Floods, that R. W. and all the
New-England-Persecutors can cast upon us; for we have the Hope of Eternal Life
and Glory, as Paul writes to Titus: and we know, we are the Sons of God (1 John 3.) as the Saints did, that were the First Fruits.

But let us return again to Try R. W. and his New-England-Priests their Love,
Faith, Hope, and Peace, etc. whether they are not degenerated from the Love of
the Primitive Christians, and the Apostles and Messengers. First, does not the
Apostle say, Faith works by Love? and, Christ Jesus is the Author and
Finisher of Faith? and is not Faith called a Shield? now, is not R. W. and his
New England Priests degenerated from this Faith and this Shield, that works
by Love? have not their Fruits Manifested them by their HANGING, BURNING with
an Hot Iron, BANISHING and SPOILING the GOODS of God's people? and R. W. would
have them PUNISHED for Matter of Conscience. Nay, have not ye proved your
selves to be the Tinkling Cymbals, Sounding Brass? (1 Cor. 13.) have not they
persecuted such, as would not run after the Sound of their Tinkling Cymbals and
Sounding Brass? Charity suffers long and is Kind: have ye not been Unkind and
full of Envy, out of this Charity, Vaunting yourselves, pufft up and rejoicing
in Iniquity? And how did the Mayor General Vaunt and boast, when he told the
Prisoners, How Mary Dyer hanged like a Flag, when ye had Hanged her! This was
your Charity, and your Joy, and your Love to Enemies and to Christians. So
neither your Faith, Love, nor Hope, nor Peace nor Joy is according to the
Primitive Christians, your Practice shows your Error from them. And likewise
ye are not in the Wisdom of God, which is pure, gentle and peaceable, etc.
which the Apostles were in as in Jam:) and are gone into a Devilish and
Destroying Wisdom. And so Christ in the Saints, the Hope of Glory, has not
been yours, his Nature neither appears in R. W. nor in the New England
Priests and Professors.

R. W. And thou say, Can the Eternal God in any Literal Sense be called the
Hope of Israel? Jer. 4.

p. 121
Answ. Does not Jeremy call him the Hope of Israel, and the Savior? and was he
not so? and was not God Isreal's Savior, and was not his people to Hope and
Trust in him for it? and the Hope of Israel (to wit God) is the Hope of all his
peoples Comforts and Mercies, etc. And the Saying of the Apostle, If in this
Life only we have Hope, etc. is owned: and so, we have both the Hope in this
Life, and that which is to come.

R. W. And when thou have uttered a many false Charges, thou say; It Is true,
they will pretend to own Scriptures, Christ, Resurrection, Judgment, Faith,
Hope, Repentance, etc. and as true and sound, as any Protestants.

Answ. Pretended, is thy own Thrust-in: for we do really and more truly own
Christ's Resurrection, Judgment, Faith, Hope, Repentance and Scriptures, then
such Protestants, as thou and the New-England-Priests do. And --

R. W. thou say, It was reported, that some of us at our Death have used
these words, Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit; and some have Judged Charitably of
i^ ( our going presently to Christ Jesus:) but R. W. says; But as to the Truth
and Bottom, however they blind the World and weak Followers, etc. and so thou
go on railing, with more false and lying Charges, which we never thought on.

Answ. Here R. W. has manifest his false Love and false Charity: for when a
man is Dying in a sense of the Lord, and desires the Lord Jesus to receive his
Spirit, does he think, that men will dissemble at this Time, and do it in
Hypocrisy? what a senseless Man is R. W. and what a Malicious Spirit has he
manifested here! And we own the Resurrection, as the Scripture speaks: And is
not the Soul a part of God's Breath, which he has breathed into man? and have
not thou confessed thyself, That it goes unto God?

R. W. And thou say, p 122.
This Saying, Lord Jesus receive my Spirit, is no more then, Lord Jesus,
receive thy self.

Answ. These are R. W.'s Forgeries: for where does he prove it out of any of
our Books? and so goes on with Railing and scoffing at God's people on their
Deathbeds, when they say, Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit; and therefore thou
say, their saying is, Lord Jesus, receive thy self. Well R. W. thou may do
the Work, that thy Father sets thee about: but we do abhor thy forged Words!

R. W. brings John Bunyon ( G. F. Fol. p. 127.) his saying [ It is a
Counterfietlng (as thou call it) of a New Birth, to follow the Light,
wherewith Men coming into the World, are enlightened.] G. F. answers [Which
none comes to (the New Birth) but who comes to the Light, wherewith every
Man, that comes into the World, is enlightened; which believing in is a Child
of the Light, by believing and receiving Christ they come to receive Power to
be the Sons of God.] (And R. W. quoteth his Book for G. F.'s fol. 127. where
there is no such thing in that page: but we have so much Charity, to overlook
R. W.'s mistake, and not rail at him, as he does at G. F.) But this is fully
Answered in the Appendix, where he brings it again in his page 5, 6. (As for
the Word Counterfieting, whether it be the Printers or the Orator's Mistake, we
shall leave that) But thou confessest here, that Christ is the Author and
Finisher of Faith: and in another place thou say with F. D. That the
Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints (page 102, 103. in thy
Book.) And thou ask, If this Light be Christ the Mediator.

Answ. We tell thee, Christ enlightneth every Man, that comes into the World:
and John tells thee, that This is the True Light, which enlightneth every
Man, that comes into the World, which is the Life in the Word, which became
Flesh, etc. And thou art no Believer, according to Christ's words, until thou
believe in his Light.

R. W. And thou say, Fox says, this Turning to the Light within is the
New Birth, and call it Our New Light (as they falsely and foolishly prate. p.
123
) But (Isa. 8.) they have no true Light, but a false and painted Light within
them.

Answ. Thou abusest Isa. 8. as well as us: He does not say of a False, Painted
Light within; but read the Margent, and thou will see, it says, There is no
Morning in them: and there is Light, before they come to the Morning. But thou
call it a New Light and a false New Birth; Here thy Malice appears against
Christ's Doctrine: So thy Doctrine is false, and thy Preaching. For Christ
says, Believe in the Light, that ye may become Children of the Light: so its
clear, thou art no Preacher of Christ, nor Messenger, nor know not
Repentance, that speak so much evil of them, that turn people from Darkness
to Light, as the Apostle did; and believe not in the Light: so thou art no
Child of Light, but art in thy own false Birth. And so it is thou, countest it
false and foolish Prating, to bid thee Repent and believe in the Light, that
thou may become a Child of Light: But the Light is true, thou shall find it,
that believe not in the Light, but call it a Fancy; which will be thy
Condemnation.

R. W. And he brings G. Willington's saying, [ That he is Justified by Faith
alone without Good Works. p. 124.
] G. F. Answ. (Fol. p. 44.) [What! without the Faith that Works by Love? have
thou concluded those Works the Works of Popery, which are the Works of Faith,
that works by Love, which Faith gives the Victory? For Faith and Works by
Love is owned; and he that believes, is ceased from his own Works, as God did
from his, and has entered into his Rest. And Faith gives Victory over all the
Popish Murdering Spirits; and both thine and their Works are out of it.] R. W.
Replieth and falls a railing, That G. F. makes true Justifying Faith to be
not one hairs breadth more, than the Faith that may be to God in the First
Covenant.

Answ. In this thou wrongest G. F.'s words, as the Reader may see; And Romans 3.
Therefore we conclude, that a Man is Justified by Faith, and not by the Works
of the Law: but R. W. leaves out James's, who says; Show me thy Faith by thy
Works: and these are the Works of the Gospel. But R. W. thou believe, There
is a God (and the New-England-Priests) thou do well, the Devils also believe
and tremble: For as the Body is dead without the Spirit, so Faith without Works
is dead. (Jam 2.) And so it is clear, R. W. and his New-England-Priests and
Professors profess Faith, but it is Dead, without the Works of Faith, which
Works by Love and purifieth the Heart: but your Dead Faith Works by Envy,
Malice, Persecution, Bloodshed and Murder. And so Poor Bancrupts ye may apply
to yourselves. And if ye were in the Grace, which comes by Jesus, your
Practice and thy Words would have been more Gracious: which testifies, you are
not in the Grace of God, which the Apostle was in; but have turned it into
Wantonness.

R. W. Brings Joseph Miller's Saying [It's an Error to say, we are Justified
by that which Christ does in us.] G. F. (Fol. p. 47.) Answ. [Contrary to the
Apostle, who says, We are Justified by Faith in his Blood: And the Faith is in
the Heart; and the Blood is in the Heart, that purifieth it: And the Mystery of
Faith is held in a pure Conscience. And the Word of Faith is within ( Romans 10)
and Faith gives Victory over the World; and that which gives Victory,
Justifies: and Christ is within, who is Justification, Sanctification, etc.
and if either of them is found within, thou art in an Error, and not fit to
talk of these things, thou understandest not.] R. W. Replieth and says, Grant
that in a true Respect and Sense Faith is within, and the Blood, etc. And then
he says, p. 125.
Will it therefore follow, twice over.

Answ. And does G. F. say, that they were not Without, before they were Within?
or else, how should they come Within? and does G. F. say any such word, that
they are one, in his Answer? So as for thy Babilonish Mystery, Jumbling and
Blending thou might have kept at home; who have confessed to the Truth, and
can not own it.

R. W. And thou say; It Is true, Christ dwells in our hearts by believing
(the Apostle says, by Faith) Ephesians. 3. and (thou say) Consequently his
Cross, his Manger, his Grave, his Literal Bloodshed are Within, etc. and his
Spear, Soldiers, Highpriests, Scribes, Pharisees, Pilate, Romans, Jerusalem
are literally within us.

Answ. This is thy own Brutish Fancy, (as thou call it) to talk at this
Rate, which neither we, nor the Apostle preached such a false Doctrine: and
therefore thou may take it home again, as a Forging by thy own spirit: And
cannot Christ be preached by the Apostles and his Servants now in the Hearts of
his Saints without all these Outward Things, as thou Maliciously bring here?
And the Reader may see, there is nothing in G. F.'s Answer for him to bring
these Words: For we own the Man Christ Jesus really, shedding his Blood without
the Gates of outward Jerusalem, etc. And a many Unsavory Words thou have here,
which thou may take home again. -- But can Christ Jesus be blown up, and
Vanish together with the Scriptures, (as thou affirmest, and according to thy
Consequence here?) O no he is Ascended far above thy Blowing up. But thy
Antichrist may be blown up, who call the Light of the true Christ an Idol
and a Fancy. And --

R. W. brings John Bunyan ( G. F. Fol. 10.) saying [ It is not Faith and
Works, that Justifies a Man before God; but it is Faith and Good Works, which
justify in the Sight of Men only: and such Works will not justify in the Sight
of God. And he says, That Works are only to justify their Faith to be true
before Men.] G. F. Answers [ Abraham was not justified only to Men by his
Obedience, p. 126.
but to God: and where is Faith, there is Justification, which works by Love.
And the Saints Faith and Works were not only to justify them in the Sight of
Men: For the Work of God is to do what he says, and his Will, which who does
not, are not justified in so doing; but are to be beaten with stripes. Who seek
to be justified by their Faith and Works in the Sight of Men, are in a Dead
Faith and Works both: for such seek to please Men more than God.] And R. W.
Replieth, and falls a-railing and says; G. F. maintains a Covenant of
Works.

Answ. But there is no such thing, as the Reader may see; but the Faith, which
works by Love, as the Apostle speaks of, the New Covenant: and this R. W.
(who is so Envious) cannot see. But he maintains the Faith of Christ Jesus,
and also the Faith of Abraham: and the Apostle says, They are of Abraham, who
walk in the Steps of the Faith of Abraham, who is the Father of the Faithful.

R. W. And thou say, The Work of God according to Christ's Doctrine is, to
believe in him, whom God has sent. It is true, it is the Command of God to
keep his Commands; but since the Deadly Fall of Man none, not one being able,
etc.

Answ. What! None can keep the Commands of God neither in the Old Testament,
nor in the New, that comes to Christ and does the Work of God, To believe in
his Son, whom God has sent? then None loves God, nor believes. For is not
this the Command and Work of God, to believe in his Son? What! are the Commands
of God in the New Testament only to be talked of, because they did not keep
them in the Old? Now, does not the Apostle say, The Law is fulfilled in one
Word; Love God, and thy Neighbor as thy self? We know, R. W. and his
New-England-Priests etc. have not kept this Command: for if they had Loved God,
they would not have killed his people; for Love does not kill, nor Envy. And
also R. W. if he had Loved God, and kept in his Love, we should not have had
this Envious, Evil Work brought forth. And --

R. W. says, They that do not God's Will, are not justified in so doing. And
therefore R. W. concludes, They that do God's will, are justified in so doing,
and that their Sins are pardoned; as Paul and David by pardon of Sin describe
justification. p. 127.
And thou say, That there is diverse Significations of this Latin Word
Justification.

Answ. What is this to the Purpose, as to Christ's words, They that do not the
Will of God, are un-justified in so doing? And wa not Paul's etc. Sin pardoned
by Christ through Faith, who Justified him? But do thou justify the Papists,
and the New England Priests and Professors Drinking the Blood of the Saints?
and thy self, who would have us to be punished? so, thou would have us
Beaten; and the New England Men did Beat us, because we did not do your Wills.
But you cry, Pardon of Sin by Christ Jesus, and are doing the Devil's Work, and
not Christ's Will and Command, which is, To love one another, and to love
Enemies. Thou say --

R. W. Does it follow therefore, that they that do not Steal, Whore, Murder,
etc. by this abstaining from Sin, and by this their Work they obtain their
Pardon, and stand by this their Work Legally right and justified in the Court
of Heaven.

Answ. R. W. Are they Justified, that Run on in their Sin, Stealing, Whoredom
and Murder? which the true Faith, that Christ is the Author of, leads from,
purifieth from, and gives Victory over such Evils; and sees Christ the Author
of their Faith, whom he has bought with his Blood. And so our Doctrine of true
Repentance and Faith, Love, Hope, Joy and Peace is according to Scripture and
the Primitive Church, and not R. W.'s nor his New-England-Priests. And we have
Examined Our selves, and proved ourselves by the Light of Christ Jesus, and
found him within us: and he is come, and we are no Reprobates; and has given
us an Understanding, and we are in him, Glory to God for ever! And as for
Counterfeit Christ, painted Faith and Hope, and dolefully Counterfeited
perishing Salvation, etc. R. W. might have kept at home; for it will fail him
in the End, which he speaks of: And this is thy own Condition, that thou
speak of the others, such as believe Lies for Heavenly Truths.

R. W. And thou say, Thou had purposed to have showed, how the Quakers have
followed the Cerdonians, the Priscillians and Valentinians, the Old Gnostics
and Manicheans.

Answ. R. W. might have kept these for himself, who calls the Light of Christ
Jesus a Fancy and an Idol: but where did any of those call it so? for we follow
Christ Jesus, and neither him nor them. And --

R. W. thou say, Thou confinedst thy self to the Terms of thy Position, and
declaredst the Quakers to be Downright Papists in many points.

Answ. Well, we shall see, what Points they are? and see, whether he and his
New-England-Priests are not nearer to the Papists, then the Quakers are.

R. W. Brings (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 214.) the Elders and Messengers of the
Churches, p. 128.
saying [ We are conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity.] And G. F.
Answ. [ David does not say, YE, who are conceived in sin, but [ I]: and R. W.
says, John was sanctified from the Womb; and the Scripture speaks of such,
as were Sanctified from the Womb, and Children that were Clean, etc. and this
is fully answered in Answ. to App. page 134, 135] And --

R. W. says, That the Protestants say, that their natural Births and
Conceptions are all defiled with Sin.

Answ. And so say the Papists. But what does R. W. and his New-England-Priests
say to Paul? [For the Believing Husband is sanctified by the believing Wife;
and the unbelieving Wife is Sanctified by the believing Husband: For else were
their Children Unclean, but now are they Holy.] I ask R. W. and his
New-England-Priests, Whether or no there be any such Believers in New England?
or, Whether they believe this Doctrine of the Apostle, or preach this? if not,
then are they degenerated. And this does not deny the New Creating of the Soul
and Spirit in Everlasting, Unchangeable Holiness and Righteousness after the
Image of him, that Creates him after him, etc. But R. W. if the Papists
confess, They are born in sin; and Paul says, The Believers Children are Holy:
How do the Quakers, and the Believers and the Apostle here Jump into one thing
with the Papists?

R. W. thou say, The Quakers are in one step with the Papists as to the power
of Nature in spirituals; and that every Man etc. in the World has a Sufficient
Light within him to see God and Christ, etc. Contrary to the Protestants, who
from the Holy Scripture maintain Natural Blindness and Darkness, and Man's
Natural Deadness: and that our Wisdom cannot discern any Spiritual thing, etc.
and that our Wisdom is Enmity to God.

Answ. Did ever the Quakers say to the Contrary, but that ye and the New
England-Professors were in this Condition? and ye might have taken the Papists
with you, and not to have joined them with the Quakers. And in this Condition
and Birth ye are still; though ye may make a Profession of God and Christ, the
Fruits of that Birth show it self forth. And indeed, how can ye be any other
ways, who call the Light of Christ Jesus a Fancy and an Idol, which John bear
witness to, and Christ said, Believe in the Light, that ye may become Children
of the Light. So here it is clear, that your Birth is not Changed: but (as thou
say) your Wisdom is Enmity, and ye are in Natural Blindness and Deadness, as
to Spiritual things. But we never heard, that the Papists did own the Heavenly
Light of Christ Jesus, that lights every one, that comes into the World, the
Life in the Word; for they persecuted us for preaching of it, as the
New-England-Professors have done. And whatever Christ has profer'd you, still
how can ye see it, except ye believe in the Light? -- And thou comparing us
with the Papists, thou have but manifest thy own Folly: for thou say; --

R. W. The Papists speak more like Men, and yield, that Men* and Women have
left them (since Adam fell) power to listen to, p. 129.
etc. and say, The Quakers talk ( like Brutes) of no Means, but Immediate
Revelation of the Spirit; and the Protestants affirm, that we have not a good
Thought, but from God, etc.

Answ. Let the Reader Judge, who speaks like Brutes? for if the Papists
listen to that, which is left them in Adam (as thou say) and ye say, ye have
not a good Thought, but what ye have from God; how have ye any thing that is
Good from God, but by that which Reveals it from God? which thou grantest, is
the Quakers Means. For the Apostle says, No man knows the things of God, but
by the Spirit of God (2 Cor. 3. Phil. 2. Romans 10. 1 Cor. 4.) And so now thou,
that deniest the Immediate Revelation of the Spirit of God to be the Means (and
the New England Professors) ye are as dark as the Papists: and so thou have
proved thy self a Nearer kin to them, then the Quakers. And thou confessest,
That God opened Lydia's Heart (Act. 16.) Was not this by his Immediate Spirit
and Revelation, by which she received the Gospel? And this is the Quakers
Means; but not R. W.'s it seems, who says: There is no Voice, to Motion
within to be lissen'd to, as often has been quoted. And do thou and the
New-England-Priests believe, There was no Motion nor Voice in Lydia's Heart,
when the Lord opened it, by which she gave Attention to the Gospel, and
received it from Paul?

R. W. Thou say, The Papists and Quakers maintain a Falling away from Grace.

Answ. And yet thou say; The Truth is, none of them seems to know it
experimentally: Then how can thou maintain, They fall away from that, they do
not know Experimentally? But as for the Papists, let them Answer for themselves.

R. W. And thou say of the Protestants, Though they grant great Fallings and
Desertions of the Children of God, yet they hold the holy Seed of God, the Holy
Spirit and Word of God, that Incorruptible and Eternal Seed, of which they are
begotten, never finally and totally to be Eclipsed.

Answ. Where did ever Quakers say, that the Holy Spirit of God or his Eternal
Seed ever fell away, of which his people are begotten, or that they fell away,
that came to that State? for I tell thee, If the Righteous fall, they shall
rise again. But neither the Papists nor thou (as ever we could meet withal) did
believe, that the Grace of God, which brings Salvation, has appeared to all
men: and is not that Saving, which brings Salvation? which the Wicked turn
into Wantonness, and walk despitefully against the Spirit of Grace. But what
does R. W. say of them, that had tasted of the good Word of God? (Heb. 6) I do
not believe, that ever he or the New-England-Priests came so far. And how can
R. W. talk of Falling away from Grace and Light, and is yet in the Fall, and
calls Christ's Light an Idol? and so not come to it.

R. W. And thou say, Thou told'st us, that the Papists and we were
Confederates in their Endeavors to raze the Heavenly Records, p. 130.
and to rob the Saints of the Holy Scriptures. [This is a false Charge: for we
esteem of the Scriptures more then thou and the New-England-Priests and they.]
And thou say, The Papists own the Snriptures to be the Word or Will of God,
etc. but the Quakers will not vouchsafe it the Name of the Word of God.

Answ. Here then the Papists differ, and are one with thee and the
New-England-Priests; and are Contrary to the Prophets and the Apostles, who
call the Scriptures WORDS, and Christ Jesus, who says, they are Words: and his
Name is called the Word of God, and not scoffingly (as thou call'st it) our
Simple Pretense, but really he is so. And thou, that give the Title to the
Scripture, which belongs to Christ, which the holy Men of God did not, art
degenerated from both Spirit and Speech.

R. W. And thou say; The Papists horribly abuse the Scrip^ures, and call it a
Nose of Wax, etc. and so do the Quakers, ^riumphing over it, etc. as over a
Dead Letter, a Carcass, etc.

Answ. R. W. These are thy own forged Words: Where did ever the Quakers call it
a Dead Carcass, and triumph over the Scriptures? for thou say thy self, The
Letter profits nothing without the Spirit. And the Apostle says, The Letter
kills, but the Spirit gives Life: and was he therefore a Papist?

R. W. And thou say; The Papists prefer the Vulgar Latin Copies before the
Hebrew, and say, Do not the Quakers simply and brutishly bind themselves to
the bare Letter of the Common English?

Answ. Here the Quakers and the Papists Dis-agree. And do not thou say, That
the Scriptures are the Word of God? which we say, are Words? And must not we
own Scriptures, as they call themselves? for do not thou say, They are the
Touchstone? and if the English Copies be not true, why do thou tell us, The
Scriptures are the Touchstone, and the Rule, and the Word of God? and why have
not thou and the New-England-Priests mended them all this time? And do not
thou say, That Ravius proclaims above a Thousand Faults to be in our Last
Translation? How now R. W.! and yet are they the Touchstone? and the Rule? and
the Word of God? how dare thou say, they are the Word of God, if there be a
Thousand Faults in them? And how dare thou say, They are the Touchstone, the
Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints? (as in thy Book page 102.) and the
Priest says, They are the Means of Faith: yet thou do extol this Man,
calling him a most-Famous Hebraician, that says, There be above a Thousand
Faults in the last Translation of them. And --

R. W. says, The Papists set up a Judge in Controversy above the Holy
Scriptures, p. 131.
etc. and the Quakers say the same of their Spirit, etc.

Answ. But how can thou call it the Holy Scriptures, if thou say, There be
a Thousand Faults in them? And is not the Spirit above the Scriptures, that
gave them forth? and the Word of God, which was before they were, as thou have
confessed? But the Quakers are not agreed with the Papists here; but the Papists
are agreed with you: If the Spirit of God be not the Judge, and not to be set
above the Scriptures, ye and the Papists are of one Spirit; but not in that,
that gave forth the Scriptures, and the Word of Wisdom, which was, before they
were Written.

R. W. And thou say; The Papists will not deny, to make the Scriptures the
Rule to be tried by it; yet their Church and Pope must Interpret it.

Answ. That is like to you, that do Interpret them, and give Meanings, and find
Fault with us for taking it Literally: so ye and the Papists are agreed. And
then thou fall'st a-railing: But we tell you both, that the Holy Ghost
proceeds from the Father and the Son; the Spirit of Truth is that which
leads into all Truth.

R. W. And thou say: The Papists generally use not the Scriptures in their
Devotions in their Mother Tongue, but in Latin, (which thou call the Whore's
Tongue of Italy:) And then thou tellest a long Story of Luther, and say, The
Papists and Quakers slight the Holy Scriptures.

Answ. But here thou can not Join the Quakers with the Papists, for we do not
use in our Devotion to speak the Scriptures out of our own Language: Neither do
we justify the Papists in ^o doing.

R. W. And thou say, The Quakers at first took off themselves, p. 132.
Families and Assemblies from any use of it, (to wit, the Scriptures.)

Answ. This is altogether false, all people knows, it is, that knows both our
Families and Assemblies.

R. W. And thou say, The Papists and Quakers say, If the Scriptures were
consumed, and quite taken out of the World, there would be no Loss, etc.

Answ. This also is false, the Quakers never said so; they never had such a
Thought in their Hearts, that we know of. But No man knows the things of God
in the Scriptures, but by the Spirit of God: and the Spirit of God leads us
into all Truth of the Scriptures both to the Comforting of our Assemblies and
Families.

R. W. And thou say, The Quakers and Papists love the Scriptures no better,
then Goliath loved David's Stone.

Answ. And we may say to thee, Thou love the Scriptures no more, then thou
love the Light of Christ, who call it a Fancy and an Idol. But by the
Scriptures and the Spirit of God, that gave them forth, we have proved thee,
That thou neither love the Scriptures, nor the Spirit of God, which gave them
forth: which we love and esteem.

R. W. Thou say, The Papists and Quakers Shake hands in the most Hellish
Doctrine of Justification, by what Christ works within us.

Answ. Is the Apostles Doctrine Hellish and Popish, who are Justified by Faith?
and does not Christ work Faith within? how does it purify the Heart? And this
Faith within owneth Christ, it does not deny, that he died without the Gates of
Jerusalem for all men. And where do we put Justification for Sanctification?
and is not this Sanctification wrought within Men? And where do either ye or
the Papists confess, that Christ is the Author and Finisher of Faith? for thou
wrongst the Papists. For if they confess, that that Faith, that purifieth their
hearts, gives them Victory and Access to God, they need not plead for a
Purgatory, when they are dead; nor thou for a Body of Sin and Death to the
Grave.

R. W. Thou say, The Quakers are Papists in that Infallible Spirit, etc. [to
wit, the Spirit of Truth, which Christ and his Father has sent to lead us in
all Truth.]

Answ. This Holy Ghost the Papists have denied to our Faces: and therefore thou
Abusest the Papists. And ye have confessed, ye have not the same Holy Ghost, that
the Apostles had; and therefore they and the New-England-priests are of one
Nature, for they have said the same: And this Spirit shall reprove the World of
Righteousness, etc. as Christ says. And if all men did believe in the Light,
and not turn the Grace of God into Wantonness, nor grieve the Spirit, which God
has poured out upon them, it would Teach them and instruct them: And that we
do exhort people to, that they may escape the Dreadful Judgments of God, who
will Judge the World in Righteousness. And then thou scoffest against our
Preachers, etc. But we have preached the Everlasting Gospel in New England and
other places; and it had been very well, if thou had turned to the Spirit of
God within thee, that thou make slight of.

R. W. Thou say, The Quakers are Papists in a high, Lofty Conceit of
Perfection, p. 133.
when in Calvin's time this Spirit came from Hell, etc.

Answ. Do not thou Contradict thy self and say, The Papists hold a
Purgatory? then how are they like the Quakers, that hold Perfection? And so
they are near thee, that must have a Combat or a Fighting all thy Life, and no
Overcoming. And how dare thou to say, The Spirit and Doctrine of Perfection
came from Hell in Calvin's Time? etc. for it is the Doctrine of Christ and his
Apostles to his Saints and Followers.

R. W. And thou say, The Quakers in the latter Years in Lancashire came from
the Grindletonians.

Answ. This is also false, the Grindletonians know otherwise, and the people in
Lancashire.

R. W. And thou say, The Quakers and Papists are great Friends in their
Notions and Practice of Revelations, etc. and Inspirations.

Answ. How can the Papists own true Revelation, that own not the same Holy
Ghost, as they were in, that gave forth Scriptures? So their Dreams and Visions
are like thine; and so not like the Quakers, who know the things of God, that
are revealed by the Spirit of God. And thou that scoffest at Revelation,
Inspiration, etc. know not the things of God, but art in the Natural, dark
State thou speak of. And --

R. W. Thou say, What a Noise we make about Uncovering the Head, Knee,
Wearing of Lace, etc. and saying of You and Thou, and Music, and Painting; and
thou call it Idle, Popish Trash and Trumpery.

Answ. These are thou and thy Protestants, that make such a Noise about them:
Nay, would thou not have us to be punished for doing those things? (p. 200.)
And What must we infer from all this? R. W. would have his Music, and the Head
Uncovered and Knee bowed to him, and Wearing of Laces, and You instead of Thou
said to him: and he is offended at us, because we deny such things; and so are
the Papists, his Brethren. And we tell R. W. and his New-England-priests, that
they never shall know true Religion, till their Flesh be Silent to know, what
it is, to Tremble at the Word of God, and to work out their Salvation with Fear
and Trembling: for it is God, that works in us both to Will and to Do. But
this Voice and Motion has R. W. not known nor heard yet.

R. W. Thou say; The Papists and Quakers are Brethren in Iniquity in their
Affirming, that the Pope is not the Antichrist.

Answ. And how can this be? when G. F. said, Antichrist was come in the
Apostles Days, and the World went after him? And thou and ye
New-England-Priests, and the Papists, that are inwardly Ravening from the
Spirit, and Grace, and Truth in the heart, and Anointing, and Word and Faith
there, though ye do profess Christ and the Apostles Words in the
Sheeps-Cloathing, and drink the Blood of the Saints (as the Papists and
New England have done) must needs be the Whore and Antichrist, your Fruits
have declared it (and thou art Stirring up the Magistrates to punish us) who
were the Livery of the Bloody Whore.

R. W. Thou say, The Papists change their Names; and why the Quakers guided
by the same Hellish Spirit and Fancy, are so tender about owning their Old
Names.

Answ. Let the Reader see how Angry this Old, Doting Man is: where had any
Quakers changed their Names, as the Papists have done? this is no Comparison.
But I must tell thee, as John said, He that overcomes, has a New Name. And
Our Names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life; and does R. W. think, this is
the Old Name? nay, this is not: And yet we do not say, we are weary of our Old
Names, which our Parents have called us by. But will R. W. say, that was a
Hellish Spirit, that changed Paul's Name, and therefore was he like a Papist?
And if thou do call the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth, a Hellish Spirit,
and so blasphemest against the Holy Ghost, remember Christ's Sentence.

R. W. Thou say again, The Papists and Quakers are led by one Spirit of
feigned Holiness, etc. Monkish Solitariness, etc. must be sequestered from
Wordly Business; p. 134.
is the Beggars Life: -- and, Paul wrought night and day with his hands; which
I never read of any of these Lying Apostles, Quakers, in all their Travails to
have done.

Answ. All people may Judge thee here Led with a Lying Spirit. For of whom has
our people Begged? and where are our Nuns and our Fryaries? thou fillest up thy
Book with such Lying Stories: The Spirit of God Leads us to no such things,
no more then he did the Apostles. But R. W. to prove us, that we are not
According, etc. (as thou say) because thou have not read, that we labor night
and day in our Travails, as the Apostles; and therefore our Doctrine, our
Practice, our Faith and our Religion must not he according to the Apostles:
Herein he has proved all his Priests in New England not to be in the Doctrine
of the Apostles, which have so much a Year, which the Apostles had not; and
that you are gone from the Religion, Practice and Profession of the Primitive
Messengers and Teachers. And it is known, that we have Labored night and day in
our Travails, though he has not read it: and have not been Chargeable to any,
and coveted no Man's Gold nor Silver. And let him enquire in Rode-Island and
Long Island, whether J. B. did not work there; or no?

R. W. (Thou might have kept that at home, to say) The Quakers Tongues and
the Papists are both spitting and belching out Fire from one Fire of Hell.

Answ. And this is thy own Condition; let any read thy Ungracious Words and
see, if the Papists can be worse?

R. W. Thou say, The Protestants hope and speak Charitably of the Salvation
of many of the Papists. p. 135.


Answ. But ye shall hear R. W.'s Charity, viz: If it please the most-High, Old
and New England may Flourish, when the Pope and Mahomet, Rome and
Constantinople are in Ashes, (in his Epistle to the King) And further (in his
Epistle to Baxter and Owen;) The Pope and Mahomet, whom some of you may live to
see flung in the lake, which burns with Fire and Brimstone. Here is R. W.'s
his Protestants Charity.

R. W. And thou say, G. F. and the rest, they Judge all that differ from
Christ, that is, themselves. --

Answ. This is a scoffing Word, to say, That Christ is Ourselves; for he
teaches us to deny Ourselves, who Lights every Man that comes into the
World. And they that hate the Light, hate Christ, from whence it comes; and
are not the true Believers, and have not Unity with Christ or with us (who walk
in the Light) or amongst themselves either. So with the Light they are
condemne^, that hate it* (Joh. 3.)

R. W. Thou say, The Quakers and Papists are Fire brands both in the matter
of Persecution, etc. and thou say: The Protestants cried out against all
Persecution -- and further: I say, the Quakers most vehemently cry out against
Violence, against Creatures; but against their Corruptions and Corrupt
Principles.

Answ. Is this good Sense R. W.? those are thy own words. And further, this is
a false Charge, as to say, The Papists and Quakers are Fire brands both in the
matter of Persecution: For this thou should have applied to the New England
priests, whose BLOODY HANDS have been embroiled in the BLOOD of the Lambs of
Christ. And therefore thou and the Papists are one, and not the Quakers, as
thou have proved them all along thy self, and the priests and Professors in
New England to be one with the Papists, and not the Quakers. For whom have we
IMPRISONED? whom have we WHIPPED? whose EARS have we CVT OF? Whom have we
BANISHED? and whose GOODS have we SPOILED, because they would not hear us? nay
R. W. Christ has given us better Weapons.

And we do believe, that the Word of the Lord, that we preached amongst you, is
Cutting: but thou art afraid, we shall get an Outward Sword. O! we have better
Weapons to maintain our Religion, the Lord has abled us withal; the Shield of
Faith and the Sword of the Spirit, etc. And what! is Cain, that killed Faithful
ABEL, now afraid? Well he may: but we leave God to revenge the BLOOD of his
Faithful Servants, which has been drunk in New England. And there is no such
thing neither in G. F. nor E. B: nor J. Stubs maintains, that any should be
punished for Religion, Conscience, Faith or Worship, as thou falsely chargest;
but that Magistrates are to punish Evildoers: and as Christ says, He that
does Evil (to wit, any Murder, Theft, Adultery, etc.) hates the Light.

And as for our Agreement with Papists, Arminians, Pelagians, etc. This is like
the rest of thy false Charges and Comparisons. And what do thou talk of
Election and Predestination, p. 136.
etc. when thou call the Light of Christ an Idol? For these are Mysteries to
thee, who art not come to take heed unto the Light, that shines in a dark
place.

R. W. And thou tellest us of the Protestants Doctrine: of a Certain Number of
God's Elect, that are Chosen and drawn by Mercy out of the Lump of lost Mankind.

Answ. Now, if they be drawn by Mercy, must not this be by the Spirit of God
within? And is not this contrary to thy own Doctrine, to say, There is no Voice
nor Motion within of heavenly things and supernatural Light? And thou speake^^
(...) his Call in Time, by his holy Word and Spirit, etc. And is not this
Spirit and Call within! then is there not a Voice and a Motion? And how can
thou talk of the New Birth, and believe not in the Light, to become a Child of
Light? Those things indeed ye New-England-Protestants hold in Talk, but not in
Possession.

R. W. And thou say, The Quakers are Brethren with the Socinians, etc. in
making Christ a Type and Figure -- an Example, how Christians ought to walk;
not that the Blood, that was shed upon the Cross at Jerusalem, was a sufficient
Price and Satisfaction etc. for the Sins of the whole world.

Answ. It Is like, thou wrongest the Socinians, as thou do us: For we tell
thee, thy Charge is false, and a Lie in thy Mouth. For we say, Christ is the
Substance of all Figures and Types: but does not the Apostle say, He left us an
Example, how Christians ought to walk, even as he did? But R. W. and his
New-England-priests cannot endure to hear talk of this Walking and this
Example; This is Socinian, this is Quaker's and yet the Apostle's Doctrine: and
thou, that deniest this, art degenerated from the Apostle's Doctrine, Practice
and Walking. For even hitherto were ye called, because Christ also suffered for
you, leaving you an Example, that ye should follow his steps (1 Pet. 2:) So we
can commit our Case to God, who judges righteously, and does not heed thy
false Judgment.

And so we own the Lord Jesus Christ both his Birth, Suffering, Death,
Resurrection; though thou falsely drawest this Consequence upon us, That the
Body, and Blood and Death of Christ is nothing but a Fancy. We have heard thy
Foul Words and Slander, the Lord knows, there is no such thing in our Hearts:
and if thou had the Fear of God in thy Heart, thou would never have
published such things, to defile peoples minds with such Lying Imaginations of
thy own Brain. And thou shall know one day, that the Lord will return Judgment
upon thee for all thy Hard Speeches against us.

R. W. And as for Devilish, Jesuitical Tricks thou might have kept at home,
p. 137.
who say; G. F. buggles at the Word Humane, as at a Ratle-snake.

Answ. Nay, he does not: but to give a New Name to Christ, which the Scripture
does not give, which thou say, is the Rule -- And we do not find the Word in
the Scripture: and therefore, why can not thou keep Scripture-Terms?

R. W. Thou say: Yet then examine them, (as I have done) what is become of
him? then he is vanished into a Spirit and Ghost.

Answ. R. W. had not a Word to say to G. F. when he was at Providence: where
was the Spirit and Ghost then (as thou call it?) but railest upon him behind
his back. And art thou like to Examine us or our Principles without the Light
of Christ, that call it an Idol? Nay R. W. thou know not thy own
Condition, and therefore thou art not like to Examine ours.

R. W. says, The Sabellians and Quakers are one, confounding Father, Son and
Spirit in one.

Answ. Then thou may say, Christ confounded the Father and the Son, when he
said, I and my Father are one: and that John confounded the Father, Son and
Spirit, when he said; The Father, the Word and the Spirit are one.

R. W. says: There it much Judaism in the Quakers Religion: And then thou
tellest of their Zeal ( as the Quakers) in the works of Righteousness; and, to
pacify God, they put Dirt, and Dung, and Swines Blood and Dogs Necks upon God's
Altar, etc. and Washing of Cups and Platters, etc.

Answ. Where does R. W. prove this, that the Jew put Dung and Dirt, and
Swines-Blood and a Dog's Neck upon God's Altar? let us see Scripture for it,
which is his Rule: And where do the Quakers do so? he should have quoted their
Books: those are false Charges without any Proofs. And as for outward Washings
of Cups and Platters, etc. truly, he is not come so far as the Jews and
Pharisees; for his and his New-England-Priests Outside is not Washed, they have
not so much as a fair Outside. For where did ever the Jews BANISH any of the
Christians upon PAIN of DEATH, and CVT OFF their EARS, and SPOILED their GOODS,
as the New England Priests have done? Nay, have not they Outstript the Jews in
their WHIPPING and in these things? where did ever the Jews BRAND any with an
HOT IRON? we challenge them to prove it by Scripture. And how dare thou speak
of the Father and the Son, and Pardon of Sin, and the Spotless Lamb, when thou
B^asphemously call his Light an Idol and a Fancy? And both yours, and the
Papists and the Jews Ceremonies we are come from, who Worship God in Spirit and
Truth.

And then thou fall'st a scoffing at Women-Ambassadors, etc. Thou might as
well scoff at those Women, that carried the Message and glad Tidings of the
Resurrection of Christ. p: 138.
And then thou speak of our Brutish Salutations of Strangers, Acquaintance
and Friends: and then thou contradictest thy self and say; Some of them will
say, How do ye do? and, Farewell: and when did any of us say, that we put
Holiness in these Tw^ Words? this is thy own Application.

R. W. And thou tellest of a New Way of Feeling and Grabling the Hand instead
of Kissing, and call it an Immodest Way.

Answ. Well! have not the New England Men made a Law against Kissing? And what!
does our Taking one another by the HAND offend thee, that thou call this a
New Way of Holiness? And did not Christ Take the Damsel by the Hand? Took the
Blind by the Hand? ( Mark 5.8.9.) Jesus took him by the Hand? ( Luke 8.) Took
her by the Hand? And ( Act. 9.) did not Peter take Dorcas by the Hand? Did not
the Captain take the Young Man by the Hand? ( Act. 23.) And what! is this a
Crime in R. W.'s Eye, that we Take one another by the Hand?

And was not the Word FAREWELL commonly used in the Scriptures? Does not the
Apostle say, Farewell? ( Acts 15, 29. and 18, 21:) Bad them Farewell? and (
Act. 23, 30.) Farewell? and (2 Cor. 13, 11.) Finally Brethren Farewell? Thou
art Offended, when we say nothing; and Offended, when we say, Farewell: what a
Discontented, Doting Man art thou!

R. W. And thou say: The Quakers dis-respect the Superiors: and some of you
have heard, the Quakers Children said to their Father and Mother, George thou
lie, and, Mary thou lie; a Language, which deserves little less than Death.

Answ. But thou have not mentioned, whose Children these were? nor where they
lived? nor who gave thee this Report? But R. W. says, It deserves little
less, than Death: But if R. W. and his Wife do tell their Children, That Christ
(that died for our Sins, and is our Mediator between us and God, who has
Enlighted us; and Christ says, Believe in the Light: And so if R. W. tells
his Children, that this Christ) is a Fancy and a Whimsical Christ, and his
Light is an Idol: and if his Children should say, He spoke not true, but it was
a Lie of his Father the Devil; then these Children for so saying must deserve
Death? for telling, They Lie and speak not the Truth, seeing it was a Lie, and
not the Truth, that they held forth? when such as R. W. are drawing them from
the true Christ, that died for their Sins? But we do not own nor love any such
thing, that Children should give their Parents the Lie, or be Uncivil or
Irreverent to them.

And we have all Men in Esteem, as they are God's Creatures: and them that Rule
Well, we say, they are worthy of Double Honor. But we ask R. W. and his
New-England-Priests, Whether all the Honor lies in Bowing the Knee, and
putting of their Hats? and saying You instead of Thou to a single Person? if
so, make it good by Scripture: and whether Superiors or Inferiors cannot be
honored without these? ( Secondly) What was the Honor, that the Chief Priests
and Pharisees did seek one from another? and Christ told them, How can ye
believe, while ye seek it? And what is the Honor, that comes from God? And --

R. W. Thou say of Their Crying down of Musicians and Music, so Excellent a
Gift of God, etc.

Answ. We do charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests to show us any Scripture
in the New Testament from Christ and his Apostles, where they said, That
outward Music was an Excellent Gift of God? For did not all the Outward Music
in the Time of the Law and Prophets type forth the Heavenly Music and the
Melody, that the Saints had and have in Christ in his Grace and Spirit? And
further we charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests, if that they had Music
and Musicians in the Church in the Primitive Times, Tell us the Names of those
Musicians, and the Outward Instruments, they Played upon?

And thou art offended at our Tuning and Singing, and call it Fantastical;
and it is like, it is Unprofitable to thee, who call Music the Gift of God.
But had thou been in the Days of the Apostles, their Singing with Grace, and
making Melody in their Hearts, thou would have called it Fantastical and
Absurd, as thou do now.

R. W. And thou say, We condemn Carving, Embroidering and Painting, page 139.
and say, It is commended by God himself in Scripture.

Answ. Here R. W. is one with the Papists, and cries against us as much as
they; and if it be not for Images, it is for the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride
of Life: And this R. W. cries up, as Commended of God; and that Quakers
condemn it. Though there was Carving, etc. in the Old Covenant of Works: But we
charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests, where God and Christ commended to his
Apostles and Disciples Embroidering, Carving and Painting in the New Testament?
and name the Names of those Carvers and Painters, etc. among the Church of the
Primitive Times. Here R. W. is one with the Papists both in his Music, and
Carving and Painting, in saying, They are commended by God, and a Gift of God.
And does not Christ the Substance End all those Outward Things in the time of
the Law in the Old Covenant?

R. W. And thou say, We cry out against Ornaments of Garments, and otherwise
against the Order, God has set in his Works, and the Variety of his Gifts for
Necessity, for Convenience, for Delight, etc.

Answ. How now Roger! art not thou one with the Papists here? Now, we charge R.
W. and his New-England-Priests to make it good by the Scripture in the New
Testament, where Ornaments of Garments are called the Order of God? and that
they should set forth his Works, and that Variety of his Gifts for Necessity,
for Convenience, for Delight? This is a Brave Ranting Doctrine of R. W.'s for
the Lust of the Eye, for the Pride of Life; which is not of the Father.

And art not thou degenerated here from the Apostle's Doctrine in the Primitive
Times, That the Women should adorn themselves in Modesty of Apparel? etc. not
with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or Costly Array; but plaiting the
Hair? And Gold and Pearls and Costly Array sets out the Creature, and are
for Delight and Convenience: But the Apostle does not say to the Christians,
that those are for Convenience. But R. W. is angry with the Quakers, because
they Cry against such things (1 Timothy 2, 9. and 1 Pet. 3.4.) Who is Adorning,
let it not be that Outward Adorning of plaiting the Hair, and the wearing of
Gold, or of putting on of Apparel; but let it be in the Hidden Man of the
Heart. Now here ye may see, these things are forbidden by the Apostle; and R.
W. says, for Convenience, for Dilight. And here all may see, how he is
degenerated from the Apostle's Spirit and Doctrine, like unto the Vain People,
Papists and Jews; and how he opposes us, that stand for the Doctrine of the
Apostle: In this he will have Proselites enough, for Delight and Convenience,
his Vain Doctrine, Contrary to the Apostle.

And these are some of the Proofs to prove us to be Like unto the Papists,
Arminians, and Socinians and Judaism, and that we are not as they were in the
Primitive Times: which all these will receive this Doctrine from R. W. very
Joyfully; and so he is nearer to them, than the Quakers, which testify against
all such things. And so J. B. and W. E. might well tell thee, how thou have
charged them, and Proved nothing: and so, these things are left to every Man's
Conscience to Judge, whether R. W. has proved his Charges, or proved himself
to be the Man found in those things, which he has falsely charged upon us; the
Lord God and the Witness in People knows it! And --

R. W. Thou say, Thou asked'st us, where was the Man Christ Jesus now, that
we confessed was Born in Bethlehem, and died at Jerusalem?

Answ. We say, He is, where the Scriptures say He is, to wit, at the Right Hand
of God. He that Descended, is the same also that Ascended; and yet Manifest by
his Spirit in his People ( Ephesians. 4, 10.) To this --

R. W. says, Then musl his Body be Ubiquitary ( as the Transubstantiators and
Consubstantiators are forced to hold) then must his Monstrous Body come from
within his Saints, yea, from within all Mankind to Judgment.

Answ. This R. W. might have told to the Apostles, if he had been in their
Days, and compared Paul's Doctrine with the Papists Transubstantiation, who
told the Saints, that Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates. And what
must we Infer from this Doctrine? That Christ cannot be within his Saints by
his Spirit (who is at the Right Hand of God, and fills all things) but he
must be within them, as a Man of four foot Long, as the Priest says?

And whereas thou say, That then his Body must be Ubiquitary (that is Every
where;) thou may as well tell the Apostle so, who says, He that Descended,
is the same also that Ascended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all
things. And was not this Christ, that must Judge the World according to the
Gospel?

R. W. And thou tell us of a Woman, Elizabeth Williams, that the Lord opened
her Mouth, and saying: This Man has discharged his Conscience, page 140.
he has fully proved, what he undertook against you; and the Words which he
has spoken, shall Judge you at the Last Day. And then thou go on pleasing
thy self.

Answ. But what! has this Woman set R. W. in the Room of Christ? and must his
Words Judge us? and must we believe, that R. W.'s Words, Lies, false Charges
and Slanders are equal with Christ's Words? So she has proved R. W. the
Antichrist, his Words must Judge us. But R. W. how could the Lord open this
Woman's Mouth, when thou say, There is no Voice nor Motion within in
Heavenly things? etc.

But how can R. W. tell us of the Father of Lights, when he calls Christ's
Light an Idol and a Fancy? And so, as for Deceived and Deceiving Souls R. W.
had better to have kept this at home.

R. W. Thou say, Thou presented'st a Paper to us at Providence ( which thou
had presented, p. 142.143.
at Newport) Anabaptists moving for the Reading of it.

Answ. And Wm. Edmond. might very well call upon thee to make good thy Written
Charges; for thou had written already more, than thou could make good: and
thou bringing in of fresh Matter to spend time, and to put by what was already
in hand. For the Business we had with thee was, to make good thy false Charges;
which thou neither could nor have: and we said well, If the Letter contained
Matter tending to prove thy (false) Charge, it should be read. Then ( R. W.
says) he put it up at the Motion of Capt: Holden. Now the Reader may see, that
we proffered fair, viz: If that it concerned the Matter of thy (false) Charge,
it should be read. And --

R. W. Thou say of John Green asking, Whether R. W. be here as a Delinquent
charged at the Bar, or as a Disputant upon Equal Terms? and thou say, We
waved this as well, as we could.

Answ. He might have seen, that R. W. charged us; and therefore it was but
Civil in all people, for to have heard him to make good his Charges, who
charged so many horrid false Charges against us (or joined with him, which we
offered fairly to them) and showed their Civility to us as strangers in the
Country. For it was he, that Summoned and Arraigned us; and not, that we
Arraigned him: which the Vnprejudic'd Reader may see in his Book over and over,
how he has Arraigned us, and Judged us and Condemned us; but was turned back
upon his own Head. So it had been but Civil for any of the people, that took
his Part, to have Joined with him; or else to have Ceased, differring any New
Matter, till he had done. And --

R. W.'s Seventh false Charge and Position is, viz: [ The people called Quakers
in Effect hold no God, p. 144. Se^ ^ow is W. d^tes ^ere!
no Christ, no Spirit, no Angel, no Devil, no Resurrection, no Judgment, no
Heaven, no Hell, but what is in Man.]

And R. W. brings in Alexander Ross ( G. F. fol. 273.) saying: [ It is horrible
Blasphemy to say, The Scriptures are not the Word of GOD; and to say, The Soul
is a Part of God.] G. F's Answ. [The Scriptures are the Words of God (Exodus 20.
and in the Book of the Revelations:) and Christ is the Word, in whom the
Scriptures end; and he fulfilleth them. And it is not Horrible Blasphemy to
say, The Soul is a Part of God ( to wit of his Breath) for it came out from
him: and that which came out from him, is of him, and rejoiceth in him.] And
these four Books of the Revelations was a Mistake in the Printer (though that,
which was the four Books of Moses, was Revealed to him.) R. W. Replies: G. F.
imagins such a God and Godhead, as maybe d^vided into parts and pieces, etc.
[And this is Answered in the Appendix (p. 108.109.110:) but nevertheless
something we shall say to it.]

(Answ.) And does the Apostle divide God into parts and pieces, when he says;
There is One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all and in
you all? (Ephesians. 4.) And do not thou confess, The Soul is immortal? and
say; It Is true, in a secondary way ( a Posteriori) as they say, The Spirits
of Men and Angels are as a Lamp lighted up by the Most-High and Infinite
Majesty never to go out (page 49.) And John Stubs read the Words of G. F. and
said: The Reason was to be weighed, which G. F. used, which was; [For it came
out of him ( to wit, out of his Breath) and that which came out of him, is of
him, and rejoiceth in him.] And to this End he desired, the words in Genesis 2.
might be viewed; which he turned to and read, viz: God breathed into Man the
Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul. And then Samuel Garton said [ If
it be affirmed, that God can be divided, and that Man was a part of God; the
Godhead was destroyed, and the Soul of Man:] But we say no such thing, neither
does G. F. say any such Words But does R. W. and Garton say, That it cannot be
a part of his Breath, by which Man became a Living Soul? and is not the Soul
called the Breath of Life? and does not Robeson say, That the Soul properly is
the Breath of Life, which God did breath into him at his First Creation? that
is his Immortal Soul, which is his Principle of all Breath, Motion and Life in
him. (p. 150.) And there is no such word in G. F.'s Answer of the Divine
Essence, as the Reader may see.

And all the Scriptures, that speak of the Soul, we own; and Christ's saying,
They may kill the Body, but not the Soul: yet God is able to cast both Soul and
Body into Hell; Who is to be feared.

And we own God, who is over all, and in us all, as well without us, as within
us: God, who is a pure, holy Spirit, and Christ at the Right Hand of God (who
has all power in Heaven and Earth given unto him) we own him without and
within, and his Kingdom as well without as within; who is God over all, who is
blessed for ever!

And we own the Angels, who behold the Face of God: and where and in what Book
did ever R. W. read, that we said, The Angels were within us? for if they be
Ministering Spirits, they must Minister to our Souls within us. For are they not
Ministering Spirits, sent forth to Minister to them, who shall be Heirs of
Salvation? ( Heb. 1.)

And Resurrection, and Judgment, and Heaven and Hell we hold without us, as
well as within us, according to the Scriptures. And we must tell thee, all
these Lies thou have of the Father of Lies as well without thee, as within thee.

R. W. And thou tell us a Story of One desirous to give Thanks at Dinner,
asked roundly, To whom should I give Thanks? p. 146.
etc. And thou say: Calvin relates, that one Quintinius, a Leader this Way,
being demanded, how he did? etc. answered resolutely, How can Christ do but
well? and yet at that time he was Sick.

Answ. Now Mark: Instead of proving R. W.'s Charges, he is telling of Stories;
which may be as false upon them, as his Charge is upon us. But R. W. says; In
his time a Leader this Way (to wit, the Quakers) etc. But the Lord knows and
his own Conscience, whether he does not wrong us! and Wm. Edmond. might well
reprove him. And then thou say; Thou would not trouble us with Proofs but
out of our own Writings: and yet thou can not keep out of these Old Stories.
Then --

R. W. Brings Magnus Bine (G. F. Fol. 88.89.) and this is

Answered in the Answer to the Appendix, where he brings it there (in his
page 47.) And well might Wm. Edmond. say to R. W. Let G. F.'s Words and thy
Meaning alone: and keep to his Words. And --

R. W. says: The Fullness of God is one thing, and another thing our (and all
his Works and Creatures) Partaking of that Fullness, p. 147.
etc.

Answ. Who says to the Contrary? But must not the Saints grow up to a Perfect
Man therefore? and unto the Measure and Stature, and the Fullness of Christ?

R. W. And thou say: To partake some Drops of the Ocean of his Wisdom,
Power, Goodness, etc. is not to become the Ocean of the Power, etc. it self.

Answ. But they may come into the Power. But let the Reader see, how he
perverts G. F.'s words all along and his Meanings: And we do believe, thou
wrongest Sam. Fisher as well as thou have us.

R. W. And when G. F. speaks of the Fullness of the Godhead dwelling in
Christ, thou say: He means the Body of the Quakers, etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer. And
that 1 Timothy 3. God is manifested in the Flesh, we own, as the Apostle speaks
it: and S. Fisher's Book neither thou nor J. Owen could ever answer it; though
some of you pervert some of his words.

R. W. And thou bring Magnus Bine, etc. which is also Answered in the Answer
to the Appendix p. 108. -- And thou say: In these few Lines let him that has
his Senses, make Common Sense and English of some of them.

p. 148.
Answ. But let the Reader see in R. W.'s (if he be finding Fault with others*
how he spells Bishop, with Bist-(in his page --) but I can look over such
words, and never heed it.

R. W. Thou go on in thy Railing, and say; The old Serpent has taught
them, in so much that these bewitched Souls say and print, that this World is
God and the Godhead, etc.

Answ. The Reader may see, there is no such word in G. F.'s Answer; neither did
we say any such word at the Dispute at Providence, the people knows it. And
then thou call'st us Horrible and Blockish: thou might have applied this to
thy self, and to that which thou assertest upon us; which are thy own words,
not ours. -- And G. F. asks you the question concerning the Soul: but why
does not R. W. Answer it, and tell, what the Soul is? as the Reader may see in
page 147: in the Book. --

And then thou tell a Story of the Manichees; when this is nothing to the
purpose to prove thy Charge; but to fill up the Book and Time. And the Apostle
says, Beware of Dogs: and ( Cant^: 2:) Beware of Foxes (which thou bring:)
Then the Lambs must beware of such as thou, and of the New-England-Persecutors.

R. W. And thou say: You are to fly, etc. from these brutish Fancies,
brutish Barkings and Blasphemies against the infinitely Glorious and
Inconceivable Excellencies of God, etc.

Answ. Then they must Fly from such as thou, who call Christ's Light an Idol
and a Fancy: and therefore thou art not able to know neither Christ nor his
Godhead.

R. W. And thou qoutest ( G. F.'s Fol. p. 67) Fran. Higginson saying, [ That
one should say, He was Equal with God.] G. F. Answ. [And in the Catechism of
the Assembly of the Priests called Divines, which they have put forth to the
Nation, in which they have laid down (for young Children, and old Men and all
to Learn) That the Holy Ghost and the Son are Equal in Power and Glory with the
Father. Yet if any one come to witness the Son of God to by Revealed in him, or
any come to witness the Holy Ghost in them, as they did that gave forth the
Scriptures, or witness the Mind of Christ, or witness that Equal with the
Father, that Equality which you speak of; ye Priests destroy that which ye have
put forth to the Nation, and cry out; Horrible Blasphemy, etc.] R. W. Replieth,
and begins with Rai^ing and says: The Quakers say, that they are Equal in
Power and Glory with the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit, etc.

Answ. Now let the Reader but read G. F.'s Answer and see, how horribly he
abuses it! does he mention WE? but only the Holy Ghost, and Christ and the Son
of God to be Equal with the Father, according as the Priests said; and yet they
are against this Son and the Holy Ghost to be in Man and Woman.

And the Reader may see, how he has changed a many words in G. F.'s Answer, to
instead of or, and Equality for Equal: and so has changed the sense, and
cries out, Horrible Blasphemy; as ye may see in G. F.'s Answer: And besides he
has left out many of his words. An^ how can they, who are Witnesses of the
Holy Ghost, and Witnesses of the Son; how can it be meant, they be Equal, when
they are but the Witnesses of it? The Reader may see, if R. W. has not do^e
this on purpose, to wrong G. F.'s words.

R. W. Brings ( G. F.'s Fol. p. 282.) Da^. Gawdry saying, [Surely, they
cannot be Perfect here or hereafter in Equality, but only in Quality.] G. F.'s
Answ. [Christ makes no distinction in his words, but says; Be ye Perfect, as
your Heavenly Father is Perfect; page 149.
and be ye Merciful, as He is Merciful: and as He is, so are we in this World.
And that which is Perfect and Merciful, as he is Perfect and Merciful, is one
in Quality with the same thing.] And R. W. Replieth and says: The Quakers
challenge an Equality with God; and cries, Horrible Blasphemy!

Answ. But let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G. F.'s words in
his Answer? but using Christ's words, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is
Perfect; and Be ye Merciful, as He is Merciful: and as He is, so are we in this
present World. Now if these words be Blasphemy, then R. W. may as well call
John's and Christ's words Blasphemy: But none of those Stories proves his
Assertion. And there is not the word Equality in G. F.'s Answer, which R. W.
has basely thrust in. And --

R. W. Brings ( G. F.'s Fol. p. 248.) [ To say, that God is substantially,
etc.] Thou bring Names, and there is no such thing in that page; as the
Reader may see in G. F.'s Folio aforesaid. -- And then thou say: That the
Quakers make themselves Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Answ. All people may see, we have need of great patience, to hear all thy Lies
and false Charges; for it is thy own Confession. Thou say, that G. F.
Answers, That God will dwell in Man: and the Saints had Unity with the Father
and the Son; and this is Scripture, as in John 1. And how dare thou enviously
say upon these words of G. F.'s, They make themselves Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost? And thou say, We make no Distinction between Christ Jesus himself, and
his Saints or Believers in him: when often we declared, Christ in us, the hope
of Glory; and, Christ in you, except ye be Reprobates. And how did the Apostles
make the Saints the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who preached this Doctrine? R.
W. might as well charge the Apostles, as the Quakers.

R. W. And thou say, We make no other work of Redemption and Justification,
but what is wrought in our Spirits, Minds and Fancies, called within them.

Answ. R. W. we say, Christ is made unto us Redemption and Sanctification; we
make him not, God has made him so to us: For we know him so by his Light
within; and do thou pervert our words? And thou might as well have Charged
the Apostle with such sayings, as us, who says (1 Cor. 1, 30.) But of him are
ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and
Sanctification and Redemption: This we witness; Glory to God for ever. And --

R. W. Brings Christopher Wade ( G. F.'s Fol. p. 246,) saying [ God the
Father never took upon him Humane Nature.] G. F.'s Answ. [Contrary to
Scripture, who says, GOD was in CHRIST, page 150.
reconciling the World to himself. And art Ignorant of the great Mystery, GOD
manifest in the FLESH: and his Name is called the Everlasting Father. As for
the word HVMANE, which is From the Ground, it comes from thy own Knowledge,
which is Earthly: and Christ took upon him the Seed of Abraham and David,
according to the Flesh, and this is Scripture-Language] R. W. Replieth and
says: page 151.
The Bottom of this is, to deny the Lord Jesus to be a Man, etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see and read G. F.'s words, how he wrongeth him; for G.
F. speaks no such thing. And does not Christ say to his Disciples, when they
asked him, Show us the Father: and he Answered them and said; Believe not
thou, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak
unto you, I speak not of my self, but the Father that dwells in me, etc. (
John 14.) And --

R. W. Brings in Priest F^rgison ( G. F.'s fol. p. 293.) saying [ That
Christ, the Father and the Holy Ghost are not one, but they are Three,
therefore Distinct.] G. F.'s Answ. [This is a denying of Christ's Doctrine, who
says, I and my Father are One; and the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and
the Son, and he was Conceived by the Holy Ghost, and they are all One, and not
Distinct, but One in Unity. And that which comes out from him (to wit, the
Holy Ghost) leads the Saints into all Truth (and that was it, that ever was
given forth from the Spirit of Truth) and so up to God, the Father of Truth:
and so goes back, from whence it came.] R. W. Replieth and says, That G. F.
calls that Blasphemy, which the most-Holy and Eternal Lord calls Heavenly
Truth: he has like some Witches, etc. so inured himself, etc.

Answ. Why R. W? because he speaks Scriptures? art not thou like the
Pharisees, that could not endure to hear Christ say, That he and his Father was
One? And John said, They were One; will thou call him a Notorious Wretch?
Indeed, thy Spirit will call Christ a Deceiver. But R. W. and his Priests say,
They are Distinct: give us a Scripture, that says so, and that they are not
One; and How far are they Distinct one from another; then thou say something.

R. W. And thou say, That the Scripture tells us concerning these Mysteries,
that in this Life we know but in part, as through a Glass, darkly, etc.

Answ. Let the Reader read 1 Cor. 13. and see, whether R. W. has not adds [
In this Life] to the Apostle's words? and the Apostle does not mention [ in
this Life:] So here thou abusest the Apostle's words, as thou do ours. And we
know, Christ says, My Father is greater than I: And what then? does this deny
Christ's words, who said, The Father is in him, and he and the Father is One?
nay, do not your own Books say, They are One and Equal?

But thou wast finding Fault with the Socinians: nay, all the Proofs and
Evasions thou bring'st concerning G. F. and M. F. is nothing to disprove
Christ's words, who says, He and the Father are One. page 152.
And what do thou talk of the Four Points; of the Pather, Son and Spirit,
etc. Fall and Redemption, etc. of the Church Officers, Baptism, etc. and
Resurrection, Eternal Judgment, etc. Art thou like to see them, when thou
call Christ's Light a Fancy and an Idol? For all these we own, as Scripture
declares, both within and without, and therefore thy Charge is false.

R. W. And thou bring'st in Tho: Collier (in G. F.'s Fol. p. 38.) saying [ The
Kingdom is not come, nor the Refreshing from the Spirit of the Lord.] G. F.
Answ. [Which shows, they are like unto the Pharisees, Unconverted, gazing
here and there: and Christ told them, the Kingdom was in them. And they that
are not turned to the Light, which comes from Christ the Refresher, whereby
Refreshing might come, are not come to Repentance yet.] And R. W. Replieth and
says; Who sees not, that G. F. speaks not here of the Kingdom of Christ in
the future and to come, and the times of Refreshing; but that he cuts off all
future hopes and expectations to come.

Answ. The Reader may see, this is a false Interpretation upon G. F.'s words:
for did Christ Cut off all Future Comfort to come to his Saints, when he said,
The Kingdom of Heaven was in them? And they that turn to the Light, receive
Refreshing from the Lord. And G. F. says; They that turn not to the Light,
which comes from Christ the Refresher, whereby Refreshings might come, Receive
not: And how can R. W. say, G. F. cuts off all future Hopes and Expectations to
come? But what should we expect from him, that calls Christ's Light a Fancy
and an Idol?

R. W. says; That the Scripture tells him and Experience, that the Hypocrites
have no solid Peace and Joy here, nor solid Hope or Joy of Glory to come, p.
153.
etc.

Answ. Roger, this is thy own Condition: and if thou did not abhor the
Thoughts of a Judgment to come, thou would never have spoken such words. --
And Foolishly, Atheistically, Childish Dreams of no Heaven and Refreshing,
which thou speak of, thou might have applied to thy self. --

And let the Reader see, if G. F. say, There is no Heaven or Hell, or Torment
in us? etc. is there any such saying in G. F.'s Answer here? These are words of
thy own Forging: and then thou have charged them upon us, and criest; Foolish,
Childish Dreams, etc. which are thy own Sayings, and not ours.

R. W. Brings John Clapham ( G. F.'s Fol. p. 101.) saying: [ To witness
Heaven and Hell, and Resurrection within, is the Mystery of Iniquity.] G. F.'s
Answ. [Which shows, thou never knew'st Heaven in thy self nor Hell there, nor
Christ's Resurrection and the Life, which they are Blessed, that are made
Partakers of the first Resurrection, on them the Second Death shall have no
Power. And the Scripture does witness Heaven within; and if Christ, that was
offered up, the Resurrection and the Life, be not within thee, thou art a
Reprobate.] R. W. Replieth and says: If G. F. would speak of Heaven, and
Angels, and Hell, and Devils, and Resurrection, and Life to come by way of
Allusion and Similitude, or by way of First Fruits or Taste of them, he might
profitably do it.

Answ. All ye, that do not know a Resurrection of Life to come by Christ Jesus,
and know not the Kingdom of Heaven within you, how can ye know it without you?
And know Hell and the Strong Man cast out there, how will ye know the Eternal
Judgment, which is upon the Devil and his Angels? upon the Wicked (cast into
Hell, and the Lake which burns with Fire and Brimstone) which go to the Devil,
who is out of the Truth; who are gone from the Spirit of God, his Grace, his
Truth in the Inwards parts, and his Light which thou call a Fancy and an
Idol, which will condemn thee: and thou shall know a H^ll, which thou so much
pleadest for without thee. And we are not Revolted from the true Christians
Faith and Religion, that was in the Apostles Days, but thou, that deniest this,
art. And --

R. W. in the same page brings Some Nameless Author ( G. F.'s Fol: p. 214.)
saying: [ To say, the Heaven and Glory is in Man, which was before Man was,
they are s^ttish and blind.] G. F. Answ. [There is none have a Glory and a
Heaven, but within them, which was before Man had a being]

And he brings Tho: Pollard's Saying: ( G. F. Fol: p. 81;) [ For a perfection
of Glory to be attained to on this side the Grave, I utterly deny.] G. F. Answ.
[Where Glory is in the least Degree, it is in Perfection; and who have not
Glory, and do not Attain to Glory on this side the Grave, they are in a sad
Condition. For the Saints rejoiced with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory; and
they witnessed the Hope of Glory within them, while they were upon the Earth
(Col. 1:) and of that Hope they were to give a Reason, that was within them.
And they Saw the Glory of God, and of the Father; and so came to be Changed
from Glory to Glory, till they came into the Image of God. And the Apostle saw
etc.] And so ye may read at large in G. F.'s Fol: which is to large to be set
down here: but R. W. has taken about three lines of it, and left out the rest.
And --

R. W. replieth: As the Swinish Epicures and Dives's of this World, (whatever
they formally and loosly profess) have no solid Hope of Peace and Joy to come
after this Life: and therefore ( like Brute Beasts) practically confess it,
saying in their Hearts and Lives; [ Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we must
die, etc.]

Answ. What is this to the purpose for G. F.'s Answer? R. W. might have put
himself amongst his Company, and Judged himself, as well as others, for it is
his own Condition.

p. 154.
R. W. thou say, Thou know, that same of the Quakers will not believe,
that G. F. and others of them deny the Resurrection, etc.

Answ. And why should they believe a Lie, as thou do? and why should not we
stand by G. F.'s words, when he speaks Scripture? and thou that do not,
deniest Scripture, and the Light of Christ, and call'st it a Fancy. And the
Resurrection we own according to Scripture.

R. W. And here thou bring the Ninth false Charge, viz: All that the Quakers
Religion requires externally and internally to make Converts or Pr^selytes,
amounts to no more, then what a Reprobate easily may attain to and perform.

Answ. This is false: for Reprobates do not believe in the Light, and become
not Children of Light, and rec^ive not Christ in them, from whence the Light
comes.

R. W. And thou hopest, many of us will come to Abraham's Bosom. [But then why
do thou rail at us? And how can we come to Abraham's Bosom, and Attain to no
further, then to what a Reprobate may?] And then thou say: Thousands may have
gotten, all their Religion requires or performs, yea, all that their Principles
call for outwardly or Inwardly, and yet not be accepted but rejected from the
holy presence of God.

Answ. How now Roger! and yet come to Abraham's Bosom? O Roger, thy Darkness
cannot comprehend the Light, that see not our Condition, no more then thou
see the Saints in the Apotles Days; thou would have said the same of them,
had thou been in their Day. We know our Assurance of God, and our
Acceptance through Jesus Christ, his Beloved Son, through whom we have peace
with God: and we do know the Son by Revelation, and God that sent him, which is
Eternal Life, Blessed be his Name for Ever! And are grafted into him, and built
upon him, the Rock and Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles: and thy words
are but Chaff.

R. W. And then thou tell a story of Perkins, and appliest that to us, which
he spoke of the Papists: But thou had better to have applied this to thy
self. And thou fall'st a Judging the Common Protestants and Quakers, and
tell of their Great Reformations and Joys, etc. their enduring great
persecution and burning of their bodies, p. 155.
etc. and yet be far from the true Protestant Religion, either in the true
Doctrine and Principles, or in the true Life and Practice of it.

Answ. How can Roger Williams tell? why does he Judge such, that they were not
in the true Religion? -- Who was this Protestant? not in New England, nor R. W;
he never felt the Flame, nor was BRANDED with an HOT IRON: his Religion will
not lead him to undergo such suffering, (for why did he not stand, but go in
the Woods, when he was tried in Boston-Colony?) But R. W. would make people
believe, he was a High Protestant beyond all these; but plainly, he is nothing
but a Railer, as his Book does make manife^t. But let the Reader see, how he
has lost himself, and gone from G. F.'s Answer And --

R. W. Terms our Faith to Rotten Nature, etc: and our Prayyers, and Fastings
and Sufferings to Women's fil^hy Clouts, and dung of Men and Beasts, put into
the Balance of God's Infinite Justice, instead of the Infinite Righteousness
and Satisfaction of the Son of God, etc.

Answ. As for the Papists, they may Answer for themselves; but our FAITH Jesus
Christ is the Author and Finisher of: we had it not from Men nor Rotten Nature.
And we Pray, as we are moved by the Spirit of God; and ^ast, as we are ordered
by his Divine Wisdom: And our Sufferings amongst the New-England-Professors
have been for the Truth and the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, in whom
our Poor Souls have had Satisfaction. And we know Christ's words to be true,
Blessed are they, that Suffer for Righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom
of Heaven (Matthew. 5.) And for all thy Ungracious Words the Lord will rebuke
thee in one Day; and in that Day of thy Torment remember, thou have wronged us.

R. W. And thou scoffingly say, That if a Notorious Drunkard be convinced,
and come to hearken to a Spirit within, to say Thee and Thou, and thinks
himself Equal and above all his former Superiors, etc. he is Justified,
Sanctified, etc. and so holy, that he cannot sin in Thoughts and Words, etc.
Thus they pretend Repentance, Faith, and a Change of Heart, because they have
changed their Talk and Garments.

Answ. The Spirit of God within leads to no such Sudden Thing; neither is the
Work so easily done, as R. W. here would foist into the minds of the World, to
make them load the Truth: neither shall he find it so easy himself, if ever he
should see a Day of Repentance. And the Spirit of the Lord leads to Humility,
and that is a good Spirit that Leads to Modesty in Apparel, and to True
Words, and from Evil Thoughts, and from Drunkenness. For after a Man is
restrained from Actual Sins without him, then he comes to know the putting off
the Body of it within, and cries as Paul did to Christ: for no Man can help
him then, but He that did help Paul, who Thanks God in Victory in the end. But
why should R. W. be so against the Spirit within, in saying THEE and THOU, and
putting off our needless Apparel, seeing it was the Practice of the holy Men of
God in the Scripture? has not he proved himself, that he is degenerated from
the Spirit, Life and Practice of the Primitive Church?

R. W. And thou say, John Bradford said unto God, Lord thou art Heaven, and
I am Hell.

Answ. And was not this Hell within him, think thou? and if so, why do
thou find Fault with the Quakers?

R. W. Then thou fallest on a preaching; but to no purpose to thy Position, nor
G. F.'s answer. -- And do thou not say, p. 156.
The Blood of God does Cleanse and Redeem (thee)?

Answ. And yet do thou not find Fault with the Quakers, for mentioning the
Blood of God? And the 2 Cor: 7. does not evidence thy True Repentance from a
Pharisee's. And --

R. W. Thou say, That no Papist nor Quaker by their Grounds could get up
this Jacob's Ladder, much less upon Higher Grounds or steps of casting off Self.

Answ. As for the Papists, they may Answer for themselves: and the Quakers Cast
off Self by the Light and Power of Christ, by which they see it; and by which
Light they see Christ, who is their Way to God. R. Williams, thou inventest
words, and then thou fightest against them, which are none of ours. And the
Quakers never said, That the Activity of Nature could advance and clime up any
higher then it self: for Natural Man (we do tell thee) knows not the things
of God; but they are Revealed by the Spirit. And so it is clear, thou art in the
Rotten Nature thy self, thou speak so much of, that hate the Light of
Christ, which call the Light of Christ a FANCY, which gives the Knowledge
of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus; who remains in the Heavens,
until all things be restored: and he is lifted up, and is drawing Men after him
with his Light, Power and Spirit.

And J. Stubs and we might well say to thee, Thou countest our Religion an
Easy Religion; but thou never trod'st in it. We know, where thou art, in the
Broad Way; for the Narrow Way is not so Easy: thou have not found it yet,
though thou may talk of it. For thou and the New-England-Priests are but
Holders of Opinions and Sayers, Pharisee-like: the Scriptures and your Religion
is but in your Lips, but ye never came into the Possession with God's Spirit of
that, of which they speak. And your Formalities, that ye have performed, have
but been with your own spirits, (that is clearly manifest) and the Evil Spirit,
by which ye have been led to Persecute God's People. And so have manifest your
selves, that ye are not in the S^irit of Christ, nor have his Mind to love
Christians, and to Love Enemies: worse than Ham, who laid open his Father's
Nakedness, for thou invent'st words to make us Naked to the World: But the more
we are Clothed; the Lord clotheth us: Blessed be his Name for ever!

But R. W. is talking of this body's and the other body's Religion, and of
Arminians, Papists and Socinians Religion; but he has not told the World, what
his own Religion is: and so W. Edmondson might very well tell thee, Thou
knew not, what true Religion was (as in thy page 157.) And --

page 157.
R. W. Thou say: Our Religion is like the Papists which is easy and
agreeable with Nature.

Answ. Had our Religion been Easy and Agreeable to Nature than your Corrupt
Nature had not Persecuted us, nor HANGED, nor WHIPPED, nor BVRNT us with your Hot
Iron: but our Religion is that Religion, which James speaks of, which is Pure
and Undefiled, etc.

R. W. And thou say, It is easy to persuade the Quakers, to change one foul
Devil for another.

Answ. Nay, ye New-England-Priests and Professors find it not so Easy, when ye
cannot do it with your HANGING, and WHIPPING, and BVRNING, and BRANDING with
your Hot Iron, and CVTTING OFF EARS: and it is thy own Condition To prate of a
Narrow Path, ( and changing one Devil for another, as thou speak of) but
never came into it.

R. W. And then thou tell a story of the Papists Whipping themselves: [What
is all this to tell such Tales and Stories, to prove thy Charge and Reply to G.
F?] And then thou tell a Story of Mahomet having Thirteen parts of the
World, being divided into Thirty: etc. and the Church of Rome, the great Whore.

Answ. What is all this to the purpose of proving thy false Position against a
Great People (as W. E. said to thee without Boasting) a great people, that thou
had slandered? But your New-England-Priests ( Pharisee-like) have WHIPPED the
Servants of God, instead of Whipping themselves. And --

R. W. thou say: It is to thee, and may be to all men Wonderful, p. 158.
that since the Religion of the Quakers is so Easy, etc. that Ten Thousands
more of People, etc. have not listed themselves under this New Mahomet, etc.

Answ. This is Scoffing R. W: and we must tell thee, neither thou nor Mahomet,
nor the Ten Thousands will find our Way so Easy; which is the Straight Way,
that leads to Life (For as Christ says, We are hated of all Men for his sake
(Mat. 10, 23.) His words are true) And is the New and Living Way, which the
Primitive Christians walked in: which any tenderhearted Christians may see and
savor, that thou art led by a foul Spirit in the broad Way, scoffing at them,
that are in the Narrow Way.

R. W. And thou say: It Is true, we pretend two Horns like the Lamb. [Where
is there any such Pretense in G. F.'s Reply, which thou will maintain thy
Slanders by?] And thou say: The Quakers only want a Sword, to subdue as many
Proselites, as Mahomet and the Pope: The Quakers some prate subtily, some
Childishly against Carnal Weapons, etc.

Answ. R. W. How does this hang together? do we Prate subtily and Childishly
against Carnal Weapons? and yet do we Want a Sword? Nay, we do tell thee, we do
not Want one; for we have the Sword of the Spirit, the WORD of GOD: and we have
and do deny outward, Carnal Weapons to convert people to Religion by, but those
are your Weapons of New England, their Fruits have declared it, whose Souls cry
under God's Altar; How long, O LORD! etc. And therefore let thee and them Dread
God's Vengeance from Heaven. So with your Carnal Sword ye are like Mahomet and
the Papists; for thou say, thou would have us Punished: and that must be
by such, as have the Sword.

And so thine and your Pretenses are Opposite to the Meek and Patient Spirit of
true Purity and Holiness: And what is your Principle then? AND how can thou
say, We are Led by a Dumb Spirit? when thou say (in page 133.) Our Apostles,
and Messengers and Preachers sent into New and Old England? etc. and yet thou
contradictest thy self and say, We are Led by a Dumb Spirit. And as for
Dogged, thou and thy New-England-Priests might have kept it to themselves. AND
thou talkest of Shameful Pride and Vapouring, and Mouthful of Cursing and
Railing, and to march under the Christian Name and Colors; This is thy own
Condition (see Append. p. 119.) Spitting out the Venom (as thou say;) There
thou may see thy self: thou art worse than Balaam, and as bad as Balak.

R. W. Thou say, It Is wonderful, how their Spirit professing to be
Protestants, can so wickedly strike in with the Bloody Spirit of the Papists
against the Witnesses and Martyrs of Jesus. page 159.


Answ. R. W. has not proved any thing of his Charge, not by G. F.'s words,
neither out of other Books: but because J. Parnel calls them Your Records,
this does not prove, that we Strike in with that Bloody Spirit of the Papists
against the Witnesses and Martyrs of Jesus; But it is thou and the
New-England-Priests, that have drunk in that Bloody Spirit, and have drunk the
BLOOD, as they did in Queen Mary's Days, etc. And had those Martyrs been in
your Days, Men and Women, that preached Christ, ye would have served them, as
ye serve us now: And -- Our MARTYRS of JESUS will be
Recorded to POSTERITY --
against you; for the Martyrs bore this same Testimony in many things, as we do.

And again thou speak over and over of our Women going stark Naked: but this
is Answered fully in other places.

R. W. Thou say: Thou wonderest, how any Godly Soul, how any Learned, etc.
who have studied the Primitive Copies of Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, can yoke
with such rude Bablings and Repetitions of simple, ignorant Praters.

Answ. R. W. might very well have applied this to himself: for let him look
back (and the honest Reader) and see his Simple Repetitions and Ignorant
Prating over and over; and therefore are we constrained to speak the same
things over and over: and then in some places we have left the same things,
because we have Answered them so often. And so its true, I do not know, where
Any Godly Soul, either in New England or here does Join with R. W. for he has
not discovered, what Fellowship he is of.

R. W. Thou say: The Hebrew, Greek and Latin, etc. which Helps most of the
Leaders of the Quakers want.

Answ. But what Fruits have either the Papists or R. W. and his
New-England-priests brought forth by these Helps, seeing ye are found in the
Spirit, that Crucified Christ? What Help was the Latin to the Romans, when they
persecuted the Martyrs of Jesus in the Ten Persecutions? What Help was the
Hebrew to the Jews, who Crucified Christ? What Help was the Greek to the
Grecians, seeing Christ faith, It is the Spirit of Truth, that leads into all
Truth? and, No Man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God? and, No
Man knows God, but by Revelation; And therefore what Helps are those Natural
Languages to any people concerning their Salvation? But R. W. have not thou
been poring and doting about the Natural Languages, till at last thou art grown
so dark with thy Helps, that thou call the Light of Christ an Idol and a
Fancy? And if we must study the Hebrew, Greek and Latin, as thou have done,
it is to no purpose: and may be some of the Quakers know these Languages better
than thou.

R. W. Thou tellest a great Story of the Ranters, (and thou seem to Join the
Quakers with them; but thou can not, when the Lord has separated them by his
Holy Spirit) where thou say, p. 160.
Thou have known the Ranters almost Sixty Years: -- and thou say (p. 28.)
The Ranters are but the Quakers Ugly Child and Daughter, and Rantism rose from
their Bowels. -- and then again thou say (p. 27.) The Quakers are but a
New-upstart Party or Faction, risen up little above 20. Years since in the
Northern Parts of England, Lancashire.

Answ. Now, let but the Reader read his pages, and see his Confusion and
Contradictions, and how he has Lost himself in his Accounts, in proving the
Ranters the Quakers Daughter; who confesses to his own Knowledge, He has
known the Ranters nigh 60. years ago: and says, The Quakers are but a
New-Upstart Faction, little above 20: Years since, so he has made the Child
(the Daughter) according to his own Knowledge, nigh 40. Years Elder then the
Mother. This is like the Rest of his doting Proofs, to prove our Religion
false. -- And as to the Adamites, and Monstrous Religion, thou might have
kept that to thy self, which the Spirit of God abhors.

R. W. Thou say: These Moderate Times have not driven the Quakers to bow
down to their Spirit for Fear of Persecution, etc.

Answ. This ye know well enough in New England, where it concerned our Lives in
the Heat of your Persecution; we could not Bow to your Image, no more then the
Three Children could Bow to Nebuchadnezzar's.

R. W. Thou say: Some are false and rotten in their Profession, and ready to
fall and tumble, when any strong Wind of Temptation blows upon them. p. 161.


Answ. This is the New-England-Priests and Professors, and R. W.'s own
Condition. For how did thou stand in Boston-Colony? And how did ye stand in
New England? And how have ye Received God's Servants, but with your WHIPS and
GALLOVSES? etc. And so the Lord has tried your spirit, and we have stood your
Tempests and Winds of Persecution, and did not Tumble down. And Christ bids his
Disciples, Take heed of the Leaven of the Scribes and Pharisees; Truly, so his
Disciples must still of you, who are found in that Leaven. And many things thou
writest here, which thou might have applied to thy self. And --

R. W. Thou say; They that are taken by the Quakers Bait, are such as never
Loved truly the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, (as the Scripture speaks)
neither within nor without, etc.

Answ. This is like the Rest, Roger: for we declare, None can Love the Lord
Jesus Christ in Sincerity and in Truth ( as the Scripture speaks on) within
and without; but such as own the Light of Christ, which he has enlightened them
withal, and believe in his Light. Then there is a Belief in the Heart, and with
the Mouth a Confession is made to Salvation: and this is not Opposite to Christ
without, as thou falsely speak.

And thou say: And some will plead with Christ at the Last Day, etc. Yea, R.
W. that will be a Sad Day to thee, when thou art rewarded according to thy
Works; who call'st his Light an Idol and a Fancy.

R. W. Then thou say: I told the Quakers, that their Theora John pretended
to write after the Spirit, etc. a Volumn in Hebrew, etc.

Answ. What is this? Why do thou call him Our Theora John, when he never was
no Quaker? But this is like the rest of thy Proofs. And then go on with thy
If's and thy And's to no purpose.

R. W. Thou say: It was a famous Principle of the first New England
Reformers, viz: p. 162.
To be Christianly careful, that their members gave Christian Evidence (so far
as Godly Eyes of Charity could reach) of the truth of their Conversion and
turning unto God; which (thou say) for ought thou know, is not changed by
their Successors.

Answ. Which if so, that the Successors Evidence be the same, that the First
New England Reformers was; then it cannot be the Evidence of a True Christian:
as witness their Fruits of Persecution and Cruelty in BLOODSHED, which never
was an Evidence of a true Church of the true Lord Jesus Christ; but the
Evidence of the false Church, the Whore, that drunk the Blood of the Saints, as
the Church of New England has Evidenced and proclaimed to Christendom and the
Indians also.

R. W. says, That our Religion, Principles and Practice arise to no higher,
then what a Reprobate may attain unto.

Answ. What! because New-England's Religion, Principle and Practice has ris^n
no higher, then what a Reprobate may attain unto? therefore he Judges, that
ours Attaineth no higher, than his own. And poor Man, how can he do otherwise,
when he blasphemeth against the Light of Christ, which We are commanded by
Christ to believe in, and to receive him in us; and so no Reprobates.

R. W. Brings forth his Tenth Position: That the Popes of Rome do not swell
with, and exercise a greater Pride, then the Quakers have expressed and would
aspire unto; although many truly humble Souls may be Captivated amongst them.

And R. W. Thou say: Thou have a spacious Field to walk in, the Pride of
Christ Jesus his pretended Triple-Crowned Vicar, and the Pride of the New
Papists pretending to be Christ himself. [and under the Papists he means us.]

Answ. As for the Papists (as we have often said) let them Answer for
themselves. And where did ever any of the Quakers pretend to be Christ Jesus?
we charge R. W. that he show it; there is no such thing in G. F.'s Answer,
which he quoteth to prove his false Charges. But as for his calling us New
Papists, truly, this hits himself and his New-England-persecutors, whose Image
they have born; their BLOODY HANDS and their Laws declare it, they be in the
Spirit of the Old Papists, and not we, who suffered Death by both of them both
in Rome, in France and in New England: and we may very well call it NEW ROME.

R. W. And thou tell us of the Devil's Pride and Condemnation in Spiritual
Gifts, Privileges and Excellencies: this was the Devil's Break neck, and will
be of the Pope's and Quakers, etc.

Answ. R. W. and do not thou say (page 154.) Thy Hope is, that many of us may
come to Abraham's Bosom? and now do number us with the Devil's Pride, and our
Necks must be broken with him and the Pope? And under the Devil's Condemnation?
R. W. might have applied this at home better, and to many of the
New-England-Church, then to the Quakers. But R W. and the New-England-Priests,
we would have you make good by Scripture, what Spiritual Knowledge the Devil
has, and Spiritual Gifts and Privileges, and Spiritual Excellencies? For
Christ says, There is no Truth in him (the Devil;) and then what spiritual
Knowledge, spiritual Gifts, spiritual Privileges and spiritual Excellencies
has the Devil? describe them, and let us see, where they be written in the
Scriptures, that Christ and the Apostles said so much of the Devil, as thou
have done?

R. W. Thou say: As to the Quakers, they know, it is not yet time to put on
the Eagle's and the Lion's, but the Sheep's and Foxe's Skin, and say; But if
-- let loose, the Quakers Spirit -- would scorn to come behind the Pope. p. 163.


Answ. Thou and the New-England-priests might very well have applied this at
home, who have gotten the Sheep's-Skin; but have been the Wolves and Foxes,
devouring the Lambs. But it is the Pope's Spirit, (and not the Quakers) who
have shed the Blood of Christ's Martyrs: So have the New-England-People SHED
our BLOOD for the Testimony of Jesus. But we and the Reader may understand,
that their Guilty Consciences are afraid of an Eagle to be let loose upon them:
And is not the Fourth Angel pouring out his Vial upon your Head, that makes
thee to Blaspheme? and the Fifth upon the Seat of the Beast, that you Gnaw your
Tongues so, and Blaspheme the God of Heaven? So it is clear, that ye are not
Come behind the Pope's Spirit, who have SHED the BLOOD of the Lambs of Christ:
And so the Comparison is true between you and the Pope, and not the Quakers,
whom thou wickedly slanderest.

And W. Edmond. saying, That thou had slandered many people both in Old
England, etc: Did this fright thee? This was not a Boasting of our Numbers, as
thou scoffingly say, W. Edmond. was a fit Man to make a Bonifacius or a
Hildebrand, and J. S. also, etc. and all of them are ready to cry up Diana,
whom all Asia and the World worshippeth.

Answ. Now let the Reader see, whether R. W. speak Truth or no? Do All call
Christ the Light (with which he Lights every Man that comes into the World)
and God (whom we worship in Spirit and Truth, as Christ commanded above Sixteen
hundred Years since) Diana, whom the World worshippeth? What an Enmity is in R.
W. against Christ, his Light and the Worship of God! (as John 4.)

And as for his Saying Bonifacius and Hildebrand, which W. Edmond. and J. S. is
so fit to make, This he might have very well applied at home to his
New-England-Priests, and see his Boniface there, and BLOODY pers^cution ready
made: J. S. they cast him in the Goal; and Nicholas Alexander a Justice of
Peace of Jamaica, when they came to visit their Friends, they cast him in the
Goal: And this was their Entertainment in New England.

R. W. And thou say: In their first Creeping ( like Hercules) out of the
Cradle, how does this Spirit dare the Spirits of Kings, etc. to Thou and Thee
to the Faces of Mighty Monarchs: with what ^r^zen, Faces, etc.

Answ. The Reader may see, what a plague the word THEE and THOU is to R. W! yet
was the Language of Christ and the holy Men of God both to Superior and
Inferior. And R. W. who calls himself an Orator, what! has he not read his
Accidence and Grammar, Plural and Singular? Is the Practice of this called
Brazen Face by R. W? Then why do they teach the Children Plural and Singular?
AND for their First Creeping ( like Hercules) etc. Plainly, this might the New
England-priests and professors very well applied to themselves: What
Protestations of Religion have they made in their First Creeping out? And how
at last they threw it all down, and turned it into Persecution both among
themselves and Strangers.

R. W. And thou art offended, because we do not Bow our Knee, and Uncover our
Heads (which thou call'st Reverence,) etc.

Answ. Is not R W. worse then the Turk here, and more fonder of his
superstitious Honor? For does not the Turk say: The Christian spends most of
his time in showing of his Bare Head? But where did the Apostles or Christ
command, that the Christians should Put off their Hats one to another, and Bow
their Knee, and say YOU to a Single Person? We do charge R. W. and the
New-England-priests to give some Scripture for it, seeing they make so much to
do about it. And W. Edmond. saying Whist, Whist, upon this thou scoffingly
call'st him Pope Edmondson: Nicholas Easton, p. 164.
the Governor was not offended at it; and what should R. W? but only proud
Pharisee-like, seeking the honor one of another, and is off^nded, because he
has it not. And if the Honor was sought, which comes down from above, this
would be laid into the Dust. BUT has not R. W. who looks so much at Putting
off the Hat, and Bowing the Knee, proved himself to be Like the Pope here, and
not the Quakers who Put off the Hat and Bow their Knee neither to him nor the
Pope, and neither King nor Governor are offended at it? So R. W. has proved
the New-England-priests and himself like the Pope, and not the Quakers, with
his Hat and Knee.

R. W. Thou say, That the Pope sits in the Temple of God, as over the
Churches and Consciences, etc.

Answ. So does R. W. and his New-England-priests BRAN^, HANG, WHIP and SPOIL
the GOODS of such, as will not Bow to the Image of their Religion, etc.

R. W. And thou say, That We do not regard; as the Ap^stle and the Bere^ns,
the Holy Scripture.

Answ. This is false: for we trying you by the Scriptures, makes you so to
Rage, whose words and practice is Contrary to them, and therefore you cry so
often for Meanings. And it is the Spirit of Truth, that proceeds from the
Father and Son, that leads into all Truth, and leads us into the Truth of
the Scriptures.

AND why should not we send Word to our Friends of Coming into the Country?
etc. this does Torment thee: Yea, and the Lord will Torment you more; who is
gathering his people, and drawing them to his Son, and bringing them from your
Barren Mountains: and he has set his Shepherd over them, Christ Jesus. Read
Ezekiel: 34. how ye have Marred Pastures and Foul'd Springs, and Thrust the Sheep
with your Shoulder. And --

R. W. is offended, because our Meetings are Established in New England. And
thou tell of Laws, Papers and Decrees, but thou have not produced them. And
it was always our Practice, as thou scoffingly say, [ There was not Liberty
for all to speak, as the Spirit gave them Utterance, till G. F. came into
New-England] That is false. And our Unity stands in the Holy Spirit of God,
which is the Bond of peace; if any go from it, they are reproved. And why
did not thou produce the Decrees, thou say, G. F. gave forth, p. 165.
of loosing from that brutish and dogged Behavior, etc. and commanding them to
be more Sociable and Man-like?

Answ. This is Untruth: for G. F. gave them no such Command: this is a base
Reflection upon thy Neighbors, for they were Sociable and Manlike before. And
as for brutish and dogged, Roger may keep at home: for he had not so much
Civility, as to speak to G. F. when he was at Providence; but snarling behind
his back, Base and Vn-manlike. And did not we Bow and Uncover our Heads in
Prayer, etc. before G. F. came to New England?

R. W. But thou say of G. F. uncovering his Head, and Bowing to the people,
and passing through the midst of them with his Hat in his Hand, with much
Respect and Civility: and he blames others, that did not so, etc. Therefore
thou Concludest, that either the Former Spirit or the Latter is not of God --

Answ. According to thy forged Lies or false Reports. Neither did G. F. Uncover
his Head, nor Bow to the people, when he past through them; it is not his
Practice: though he might take his Hat in his hand, when he was Hot, and walked
through the people. And G. F.'s putting off his Hat was in Reverence to the
Lord, the God of Heaven, and not to Man.

R. W. Thou say, The Pope lifts up himself as God over the Scriptures, and,
He is Sole Judge, etc: and dispenses of Oaths and Marriages, etc.

Answ, Might not R. W. have kept this at home, with his New-England-Priests,
that They must be the Interpreters of the Scriptures, and so Over the
Scriptures? For does not R. W. cry out against us for Want of Meanings, and
says, We take it Literally, and we are Fools and Silly, and will not own your
Meanings? And therefore do not thou claim the power of the Expounding, as the
Pope does. AND are not the New-England-Priests and Professors both the
Dispensers of Oaths and Marriages ( Pope like?) But we neither Swear, nor Marry
none, but are Witnesses to them.

R. W. For do not thou say, We admit of no Interpreter, but Our selves?

Answ. Nay R. W. It is not Self, that Interprets Scripture: we tell thee, they
were given forth from the Holy Ghost, and it is the Holy Ghost, that leads
into all Truth of them: which the Papists and ye cannot endure to hear of; and
so are of one Birth, that persecutes him that is born after the Spirit.

R. W. And thou say, That we said, We would be tried by the Scriptures; and
yet (thou say) We admit of no Interpreter, etc.

Answ. Then the Scripture it self is not the Trier, but the Meaning, which the
Interpreter gives, must be the Judge, according to thy sense: How is the
Scripture the Judge then, as thou say? And so the Meaning is set up, and not
the Spirit, and this makes the Confusion in the whole World: and is not this
One with the Pope? And we say, The Spirit of God is the Interpreter of its own
words, that gave them ^orth.

R. W. And thou say over and over, That the Papists and Quakers said, that
there would be no Loss if the Scriptures were gone out of the World.

Answ. These are but thy own words, to prove thy false Charges, that thou
say: We most horribly and hypocritically trample the Scriptures under our
proud Feet.

R. W. And whereas thou say, Tha^ the Quakers and Papists most Insultingly
lift up themselves against the Servants and Children of God all the World over,
p. 166.
that bow not to their Images.

Answ. R. Williams has mistaken himself; it is he and the
New-England-Professors, and the Papists: for never did the Quakers force any to
their Religion by WHIPS, etc: So they are Brethren in Iniquity. And so the
tender Babes have been TORN, and received MARKS in their Backs with your WHIPS,
and the BRAND with your Hot Iron, and your CVTTING OFF EARS, and your Immodest
STRIPPING of Women and Maidens at your Whipping-posts. NOW we do Charge R. W.
and all his New-England-Priests, where ever Christ, or the Apostles or the
Church in the Primitive Times did Strip Men and Women, Young and Old, as ye
have done? O! ye have been a Shame to Christianity among the very Indians!

R. W. says: And say not the Quakers ( as the Pope, etc.) All that believe not
in their pretended Light, their Repentance, Holiness Zeal, Preaching, etc. is
nothing.

Answ. The Papists do not own the Light; for Papists do not believe in the
Light, that lights every Man, that comes into the World, no more than thou,
and you of New England. And so in this thou can not compare us with the
Papists, but thee, that call the Light of Christ (which Christ bids us
Believe in, that we may become Children of the Light) an Ido^ and a Fancy: But
thou and they, that do so, are in a blind Zeal, and cannot see Repentance. And
what is your Holiness and Preaching good for without the Light of Christ, that
shines in the Heart, that should give the Knowledge of him? AND we do profess
and preach Christ, that Died without the gates of Jerusalem without us, and yet
is manifest to us by his Spirit, and dwells in our Hearts by Faith (Ephesians. 3)
yea, it is for his sake, that the Birth of the Flesh Persecutes us: and so we
follow the Lamb, his Leading.

AND so as for Apollo's Worshippers, by whose Priests the Devil gave Oracles,
R. W. might have applied at home, who owneth no Voice or Motion of Heavenly
things in him; and therefore how can he Worship God in Spirit and Truth? AND
this Hebrew Child, the Lord Jesus Christ, will stop thy Mouth, as he did the
Devil's, whom Apollo Consulted withal (as thou say) for neither he nor thou
have proved your Lying Charges: And G. F.'s words stand against thee clear from
thy Charges:

R. W. And why do thou say, We upbraid all other Ministers and people for
being out of the Infallible Spirit? page 167.


Answ. Do not your Ministers, and People and Professors Confess; Ye have not
the same Immediate Holy Ghost, as the Prophets and Apostles had? So then, are
not ye Fallible ( Pope and Papist-like) and not true Ministers and Overseers
made by the Holy Ghost* who are not led by the same Holy Ghost as the Apostles
were? and so degenerated from the Apostles Spirit in the Primitive Times: And
J. Stubs witnessing the Unction and saying [as in John, etc.) Hereby we know,
that we dwell in him, because he has given us of his Spirit ( John 1.] and W.
Edmondson, they did not proudly boast of the Spirit (as thou scoffingly say)
but they spoke, what they knew.

R. W. says: The Apostles were Eyewitnesses of the Resurrection of Christ,
etc. but who are you? etc.

Answ. Yea, but Who are you? and who art thou, that call the Light of Christ
a FANCY?

R. W. And thou say, That G. F. said at Providence, that he opened the Eyes
of the Blind.

Answ. But thou did not hear him say so, for thou wast not there: and yes, he
and we do, turning them from Darkness to Light. But thou, that call the
Light a Fancy, stoppest their Eyes? As for the Pope's and Balaam's (thou
migth'st have put in Balak too) Saying, This he and his New England Priests
might have applied to themselves, and not to the Quakers: for they have not
only railed and cursed, but HANGED; outstript Balak and Balaam.

AND as for the Quaker in London and She-Apostle, that called some Devil in
New England; That was not of God, that SHED his Servants BLOOD, nor that Envyes
them. page 168.
-- AND the Quaker at London carrying Dung in to the Priest; It was to show
him, that it was Like his and your Profession: who ventured his Life. But you
New-England-Professors could cast him into your Prison at Boston: That is your
Entertaining of Strangers at Boston.

R. W. Thou say: It is the great point of horrible Pride both among Papists
and Quakers, exalting Dung and Dirt of their own Qualifications, ^xcellencies,
Graces, etc. and so go on railing and say, That we count the Business of
this Christ ( as the Pope said) but a Fable.

Answ. This is false, the Lord knows it! It never entered in our Hearts. And
thou that art to prove thy false Charges with such horrid Lies, add'st Lie unto
Lie: and therefore what are your Qualifications and Excellencies, but Dung and
Dirt? which thou might have applied to thy self, and not to us. And let the
Papists Answer for themselves: And R. W. should go to Rome, and tell them so;
but there he dare not show his Head.

R. W. And thou say, That We exceed the Pope in our Doctrine of Perfection.

Answ. Yes Roger, and Thee too; who say, Thou must have a Combat to the
Grave, and be Fighting all thy Life time: and give the Apostle the Lie, who
said, He had Fought a good Fight, etc. and then he was not Fighting.

R. W. Thou say: G. F. mak^s a^ the Saints born of God.

Answ. What is a Saint R. W? The Apostle tells thee, He that believes, is born
of God. ( John 1, 5.) So thou manifestest, that thou art not a Believer, that
opposest his Doctrine. (But these and many other things are Answered; which he
brings over and over to fill up this Book.)

R. W. Thou say: They can prove, that the Three, that bear Record in Heaven,
and the Three that bear Record in the Earth, and the Scripture is within them,
they made it, etc.

Answ. R. W. Thou art a Forger of these words (which thou bring to prove thy
false Charge) and to say, That we are the Father, Son and Spirit; when we never
spoke such words: neither are such words in G. F.'s Book, neither did we ever
hear such words before, as thou have invented. What! because Christ says, He
and his Father are One: And, We have the Spirit of Christ, and he dwells in
us, and, We are the Temple of God; Does it follow, that the Apostle had
preached this Doctrine, and said, The Saints were GOD? And because John says,
There is Three, that bear Record in Heaven, etc. and therefore does it follow,
that They are the Three? Well! but R. W. thou may do thy work: and those
Lies may be Food for the Persecutors in New England, but not for the Children
of God.

And H. B. affirming, that which he spoke to you, was that God gave him, etc.
But what was his Ridiculous Folly acted amongst you at Barbados and London
since, that thou have not set it down? page 169.
And thou should have put down his Name at large; for we do not know, who it
is, thou speak of. But R. W. would have us to know, that His Words were from
God, yea, and his Sisters; but his Words and Spirit are favored not to be from
GOD.

AND J. Stubs spoke Truth, That it is our practice to pay Tribute to Caesar,
and Honor, to whom Honor, etc. But --

R. W. says: It was against our Principle and Practice, to show Respect to any
Person.

Answ. That is false: and thou know, much Respect was showed unto thee, and
Patience; yet thy Peevish Spirit was offended, because we called thee Old Man.
AND there are no such Words in G. F.'s Writings, that say, That we are the
Higher Power, the Dignities, the Most-High GOD; but that every Soul must be
Subject to the Higher Power. O. R. W! how dare thou speak those Forged Lies
without Shame, Blushing and Trembling, if thou ha^'^^ any Fear of God in thy
Heart! Do the Magistrates in Rode-Island profess any such thing, which have the
Government, or the Governors? And where did we desire Tribute of R. W. or the
New-England-Professors, or the whole Creation? We charge thee and them, to
Answer it: mention the Person and Time. And we are the same as ever we were. --

AS for Juggling and Dissembling, thou may keep at home: and it would be
well, if thou and the New-England-Priests and Professors could find a Day of
Repentance. For have not the New-England-Priests and thou taken the Authority
of God to Judge and Rule over Men's Consciences, which is the Seat of GOD?

R. W. And thou scoffingly say, That we read the Fourth Charge, as willing
to be out of Pain.

Answ. R. W. thou appearest to be Light, Frothy, Scoffing and Scornful, and not
like an Aged Man, that should be a Good Example to the Younger. And so thou
have plainly proved thy self and the New England Priests to be the Swellers,
thou speak of (in the Third false Charge, at Providence) exercised with
Pride; and that your Religion, Principles and Practice rise no higher, than
what a Reprobate may attain unto; Who hate and scoffest at the Light of
Christ, and call it an Idol: which thou must believe in, before thou art a
true Christian; or else it will be thy Condemnation.

R. W.'s (Eleventh) False Charge: The Religion of the Quakers is more
Obstructive and Destructive to the Conversion of Souls and People, than most
Religions, that are at this Day extant in the World.

Answ. Our Religion is the pure Religion and undefiled, which was in the
Apostles Days: and thy Religion and the New-England-Priests, (that call the
Light of Christ a Fancy, which John was a Witness to, and Christ said, Believe
in) is Destructive to people both to Conversion and Salvation. For how can they
see Christ their Salvation without the Light of Christ? And how can they see
the True Religion from the False without the Light of Christ? And therefore we
tell thee, without the Light of Christ thou know neither our Religion, nor
thy own, nor others in the World, which in thy Darkness thou would seem to
be a Judge of.

AND then to prove thy false Charges, thou bring'st us a great Story and Tale
of the Pagans, and the Pope's and Mahom^ts Worship, and the Jews, Who art as
Ignorant of theirs, as thou art of the true Worship, page 170.
Christ set up above Sixteen Hundred Years since.

R. W. And thou tellest, How the Protestants have revolted and separated
themselves from the Papists, and have cried up the Lord Jesus in the Scriptures.

Answ. But how is R. W. and the New England-Priests revolted and separated from
the Popes, when they are found in their Envious, BLOODY Spirit? And how does R.
W. cry up Christ in the Scriptures? Is Christ in the Scriptures? (to wit, in
the Writings?) Christ says, They testify of him; and what Sense is this, to
say, Ye cry up Christ in the Scriptures? The Apostles and the Quakers Preach
Christ at the Right Hand of God, which the Scriptures testify of. And Christ
says, And it is Written of me; he does not say, He is in the Scriptures: And
the Apostle does not say, Christ is in the Scriptures; if he does, let us see,
where it is Written? and keep to the Form of sound Words.

R. W. And then thou tell us a Story of the Episcopalians, and Presbyterians
and Independants, etc.

Answ. As though R. W. was a Judge of all these and many others, and yet
denies any Voice or Motion of Heavenly things within himself, and calls the
Light of Christ an Idol. Yet in all this he has not discovered his own
Religion, and what he is of himself? for we do not understand, that he is
settled or joined with any of these Protestants Religion in any way of Worship,
except by his Slanderous Book he may get into Favor with some Loose and
Persecuting Spirits.

R. W. And thou say, Those Religions differ each from the other, as the
Quakers do from the Papists.

Answ. And does not R. W. himself differ with them all? And R. W. if the
Papists and the Quakers differ, do thou say so? which wast making us one all
this while?

R. W. And thou say, That we are more Destructive to the Souls of Men, p.
171.
than the Papists, who wildly profess all Ordinances and Ministers to be
Invisible; and yet are found to be as Visible and Open as any.

Answ. Here is a false Charge; we never professed, but the Bodies of the Saints
and Ministers were Visible: but being Able Ministers of the Spirit, the Spirit
is Invisible. And we do believe, thou have more Love to the Papists, than to
us; and that we are more Destructive to thine and your Hypocritical Way and
Worship, than the Papists. But as for Destructive to the true Religion and the
Souls of People, this the New-England-professors and thou might have applied at
home, who call'st the Light an Idol; by which Light they should see their Sins,
and know their Savior, that died for their Sins, and saves them. AND it is in
vain for thee to tell of Repentance, and Faith, and Saving of Souls, and the
Worship of God in the Spirit and Truth, and know of no Voice nor Motion of
Heavenly things within thee to be hearkened unto; All thy Religion, and thy
Worship and Profession has been but from the Lips and the Mouth, not from the
Heart. And we never Cracked of Quaking and Trembling, as thou scoffingly
say; but we do Work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling: It is God,
that works in us both to will and to do according to his pleasure. And all,
that come to Worship God in Spirit and in Truth, they must come to the Truth
in their Hearts, the Spirit of God there, to mortify their Evil Nature, etc.
and this they will not find Easy.

R. W. And then thou say: The Turks and Papists ( to thy knowledge) take
more pains in their Religion, than the Common Protestants; and thou Confessest,
they do all but paint and gild over Nature's old and rotten Posts.

Answ. This is thine and New-England's Condition, far of a true Faith and
Repentance; and that thou and you cannot see, that call the Light of Christ
a Frantic Light and a Fancy: And did Paul, that turned people from Darkness to
Light, etc. turn them to a Fancy? And --

R. W. Thou say; The Quakers come not near that Care of New England (I am
sure, at first) for the personal true Repentance and Holiness of their Churches
and Congregations: and in the Margent thou say; That the Quakers Conversion
is not comparable to the Way of New England.

Answ. What ever their Conversion was at the first, this we know, that the
Church in New England are not now true Converts; they are not turned from dead
Works to serve the Living God: Nay, they are not turned from the Cruelty,
Persecution and Envy of the Unconverted Jews and Heathens (as their Fruits at
large have manifested it) Then they are degenerated, from what they were at
first. Therefore the Comparison will not hold between the Quakers Conversion,
who like Lambs have suffered even unto DEATH, and yours, who Cruelly have
persecuted even unto DEATH: Therefore their Conversion is made no Conversion.

R. W. And then thou fall'st a-Railing again at our speaking THEE and THOU,
etc. and bowing down to a dumb Image and Worship, etc. and that we say, we are
God and Christ.

Answ. Which is Answered over and over, and thy false Charge denied: for we
never of our selves said any such thing; but God and Christ dwells in us. AND
why art thou angry so much at THEE and THOU? and yet thou confessest, It is
according to the Accidence and Grammar?

R. W. And then thou tellest us a Story of the Papists and Arminians
Flattering, etc. Flatterers.

Answ. Which thou better might have applied at home: and well might W. E.
say, We dealt plainly with thee, and you and all Men.

R. W. And thou say, Thou Intended'st to add, that the Quakers pretended to
be as fine Flower sifted* out from the Common Protestants, p. 172.
Independants and Baptists; And so go on a-Railing.

Answ. Thou do not know, what thou say, for we Pretend no such thing: for
we are the Offspring of the Lord, and of Abraham, who walk in the Steps of the
Faith of Abraham.

R. W. And thou said: As the Whore of Rome deceived whole Towns and Cities,
etc. so the Painted Quaker (as a drunken Whore) should follow the drunken Whore
of Rome ( drunk with the Blood of Jesus, etc.) etc.

Answ. R. W. here thou have falsely charged us, and speak a false Divination
of thy own Brain, and not from the Lord. But let the Quakers, and the
New-England-Professors and the Papists be examined, and see, who has DRVNK
BLOOD? and who is the Painted Whore? whether it be not R. W. and his
New-England-Professors? BUT R. W. Is the Whore of Rome Drunk with the Blood of
Jesus? (as thou say) Is the Saints Blood the Blood of Jesus, that cleanses
from all Sin? For John says here, Drunk with the Blood of the Saints; but does
not say, Drunk with the Blood of Jesus: We charge R. W. and the
New-England-Priests to make this good, that the Saints Blood is the Blood of
Jesus. For thou say, Drunk with the Blood of Jesus for the obtaining of the
Smoke of a Tobacco-Pipe, etc. We do believe, thou wrongest the Papists here (as
bad as they are) for to be Drunk with the Blood of the Saints (which thou
call Jesus) for the obtaining of ( the Smoke of a Tobacco-pipe) Riches, etc.
show us the Chronicle for this.

R. W. And after thou have told several Stories of David and Absalom, Joab and
Achitophel (which is nothing to the purpose to prove thy false Charge) thou
say; We and the Jesuits will be found at last to be Apostles, p. 173.
Messengers, Emissaries of Satan, sent out from Hell to predicate the Goodness
of rotten Nature, Hell and Damnation, that false Hellish Gospel: And so go
on railing.

Answ. R. W. might have kept this at home, and his New-England-Professors, who
have proved this already, from whence they came, with his Jesuits in their
bloody Practice; and not blasphemed the Everlasting Gospel, and say, It comes
from Hell: Which was Revealed to the Apostle, and Revealed now again; which is
the Glorious Gospel, CHRIST, which has brought Life and Immortality to Light,
and preserves us in Life and in Immortality. And this Gospel he cannot damn;
though he endeavors it with his Rotten Nature. And if he Saw but himself to
Know, whose Image he was, and whose Work he was a-doing; he would dread the
Lord God, that hears his Words, and sees his Work, and will reward him
accordingly.

R. W. And thou say: The Devil knows, that after the VVitnesses have done
their Work against Antichrist, and after their Slaughters, the Lord will send
his Messengers abroad, etc.

Answ. The Lord God has sent his Messengers abroad with his Everlasting,
Glorious Gospel, whom ye, like BLOODY Butchers, have slaughtered some of them
in New England; and your Gospel needs a Rope-maker's Shop to make WHIPS and
HALTERS, and needs a Smith's Shop to make you Swords, and Chains and
BRANDING-IRONS: which manifests, it is not the Gospel of the LORD JESUS
CHRIST.

But New Jerusalem is come down from Heaven among the Sons of God; and it is
you, that have been stirred up against them with your outward Swords and
Staves, like Mahomet or the Jesuits, (or Papists) who fish for smoke of this
World's Sodom, thou speak of; and not the Quakers.

R. W. And thou say: Cursed is that Charity, that puts out the Eye of
Reason, etc. and the Eye of true Affection to Christ Jesus.

Answ. And have not thou in this Cursed thy self, who call his Light, which
opens this Eye, which comes from him to see him, an Idol? And Christ said,
Believe in the Light, etc. and what think thou, this was an Idol, he bid
them believe in?

R. W. And thou say: As to the Saving of Souls, it was a Thunder from the
Heavenly Mouth of Christ Jesus [ They that t^ke the Sword, shall perish by the
Sword] As if he should say The Sword is not a Saving, but a Destroying Tool, in
Soul-humbling and Soul-Saving: making worlds of Hypocrites, but not true
Protestants and true Christians, and Followers of the true Lord Jesus.

Answ. HERE Roger Williams, who is going about to prove his false Charge upon
the Quakers, has proved himself and his New-England-Priests one with Mahomet
and with the Papists: he has proved them to be Hypocrites, and not true
Protestants, and no true Christians, and no true Followers of the Lord Jesus
Christ, no Soul-Savers by their Carnal Weapons: and proved them Disobedient to
the Commands of Christ Jesus from his Thundering, Heavenly Mouth, as he calls
it. For have not the New-England-Men forced and compelled by the Sword to
Religion? let their WHIPS, STOCKS, their GALLOVSES, their BANISHINGS upon Pain
of Death, their Cutting off EARS, their BVRNING and BRANDING with an Hot Iron
speak their Hypocrisy, and declare, that they are no True Followers of Christ
Jesus, nor no True Christians, nor no True Protestants, R. W. proves himself
and his New-England-Professors no true Christians.
but Destroyers and Makers of Hypocrites: nor no Soul-savers, (according to
R.W. his own Doctrine) and he amongst them; who would have the Magistrates to
PVNISH us. ( page 200.)

And is not this Destroying Tool still in your Hands, by which ye make
Hypocrites, and no true Protestants, nor Christians, nor Followers of the Lord
Jesus? And our Weapons is the Sword of the Spirit, the WORD of GOD: and this
R. W. calls Fantastic, and Weakness and Madness. And thou say --

R. W. Thou know, that the true Lord Jesus, his Holy Father and Holy Spirit
is as odious both to Jesuits, p. 174.
and most Papists and Quakers, as the Devil, yea, infinitely more than the
Devil himself.

Answ. R. W. These are Horrid Lies, and thou have spoken thy own Condition, who
call the Light of Christ Frantic* Therefore thou art not like to know Jesus
Christ, nor the Father, nor his holy Spirit. And as for the Papists, they may
Answer thee themselves: Thou do not matter, what thou say, thou think,
Thy Tongue is thy own: who vent'st all those Lies against us. For had we not
Loved Jesus Christ, and the Father, and been in his Holy Spirit, we had never
had such Language from the Evil Spirit in thee. And Fisher, Stubs and
Pennington, and Bishop, their Words and Books will stand as a Testimony against
thy persecuting Spirit in New England, and for the true Lord Jesus.

AND who are they, that Kill with Tongue, Pen and Sword, etc. that the
Inheritance may be theirs, but even R. W. and his New-England-priests? But let
the Pharisees and the Jews Judgment Answer them. And the True Lovers of the
Lord Jesus Christ will shine forth more and more, and the Lamb and his
Followers will have the Victory, but not with Carnal Weapons.

R. W. Thou say, That the Sufferings of the Quakers are no true Evidence of
the Truth of their Religion.

Answ. R. W. has marked himself, and his New-England-Priests and Professors.
For did ever such as persecuted the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles,
persecute them as true Men, and as their Religion was True? And have ye
New-England-Priests and Professors persecuted us with Tongue, Hand and Sword,
as True Men? or looking upon our Religion to be True? Now, have not they
clearly demonstrated themselves to be of the Lying Birth, born of the Flesh in
a blind Zeal? And the Apostle says, It was not only given us to believe, but
to suffer for the Name of Jesus: So this does Evidence the True Belief, which
does not persecute any for Religion.

R. W. And thou say, Thou could find no Jews, Papists or Protestants,
that did so magnify and so exactly insist upon their Sufferings, as the
Quakers did. And yet thou contradict'st thy self and say, p. 175.
That Paul did more particularize his Sufferings, then any other Saints in the
Scripture.

Answ. Here thou have contradicted thy self, and wrongest us: for we do not
Magnify our Sufferings; we Magnify the LORD, that upholdeth us in our
Sufferings. But it is like, it troubles thee and the New England Men, that our
sufferings are drawn up, and that ye are made manifest, that ye are no True
Christians, nor True Followers of Christ Jesus. And it is like, ye would not
have had us to print our sufferings, that it might not come to the Light, which
ye did in the Dark. And we know, the End of Paul's speaking of his sufferings
was, to manifest them that were not Real; but they were not Persecutors, as the
New-England-Priests are. But thou would have told the Prophets, Christ and
his Apostles, Their sufferings for their Religion for the Word of God and for
Jesus sake were no true Evidence of the true Lord Jesus Christ, of the Word of
God, and of the true faith or true belief.

R. W. And the Quakers Sufferings (thou say) are not to be compared with
Paul's.

Answ. And why? And yet we set down exactly every hour's Imprisonment, every
Stripe in Whipping (as thou say?) But this proves, that ye are the Birth
of the Flesh, and NO TRUE CHRISTIANS; but persecute with an outward Sword,
according to thy own Judgment.

R. W. And thou say. We publish our Sufferings to the World in print, as if
they were a Sign hung out, with this Inscription, etc. and then scoffest.

Answ. It is a Certain Evidence, that thou and you are in a Persecuting Spirit,
and the Lord supported us over your Murdering Spirit. AND thou art offended,
because G. Bishop has printed so much: Nay, thou will have more, as long as
thou continuest in this Birth of Persecution, and calling Christ's Light an
Idol, Frantic and a Fancy: here ye not only do persecute, but blaspheme. And
what G. Bishop has writ, it was not in a Childish Vapor, Ostentation and Vain
Glory (as thou say) but to manifest your Un-mercifulness and Cruelty: which
seems, it troubles thee and the New England Persecutors, that true
Christians and the World should know of your BLOODY Persecution. But why does
R. W. write such a Catalogue against the Pope, and yet would not have a
Catalogue of their own BLOODY doings manifest? who are ^ound in one Spirit,
drinking of Blood. But read, what the Apostle says: Even after that we had
suffered before, and were shamefully entreated (as ye know) at Philippi, we
were bold in our God to speak unto you (1 These. 2.) So that we our selves glory
in you in the Churches of God for your Patience and Faith in all your
Persecutions and Tribulations (2. These: 1.) And did not Jeremiah and all the
Prophets Record their Sufferings? and the Apostles Record the Sufferings of
John, and Christ and their own? (as ye may see in Acts)* though (I say) not
all; and we have not Recorded all our sufferings in New England. AND ( Act: 5,
40.) when such as your Spirit in New England had called the Apostles, and
beaten them, they commanded, that they should speak no more in the Name of
Jesus Christ: And they departed, rejoicing, that they were counted worthy to
Suffer for the Name of Jesus Christ: And yet they ceased not to teach and
preach Jesus Christ. R. W. would have said, They glory in their Sufferings;
Nay, they are Blessed, that Suffer for Christ, for theirs is the Kingdom of
God; We know it: but they that persecute, have not this Blessing, nor the
Kingdom.

And all these Sufferings We have suffered both for Christ within and Christ
without. p. 176.
Neither are our sufferings like either to Papists, nor you in New England; for
all ye (I know) will persecute others, though ye Suffer your selves. And it is
known by many, that our sufferings are, as the Primitive Church's sufferings,
who do persecute none, and make none to suffer; but only we suffer as Lambs.
And it is known, that never a Lamb worried or tore a Dog, or a Wolf or a Fox;
and therefore they are Wolves and Foxes, that may suffer, and yet make others
to suffer: and this is nothing. Yet in all our Sufferings we have Love still to
our Enemies, as the Disciples of Christ, and true Christians; and do pray for
our Enemies, who persecute us: And here in this we differ from all the
Persecutors or Suffe^ers in the World. And though we do give our Bodies to be
burnt, and our Goods so the Poor; yet still we retain the Love, which is the
Supreme over all, or else our sufferings are nothing. But this does not clear
R. W. and the New-England-Priests and Professors, but that they are the Birth
born of the Flesh, and that they are no true Christians, no true Protestants,
no true Followers of Christ (as R. W. confesses) but Hypocrites, and Makers of
Hypocrites, (p. 173.)

And R. W. brings E. B.'s Epistle, ( G. F. Fol. Epist. to the Reader, p. 12.)
which speaks of the Cruel Persecutors and Professors, Priests, and
Magistrates in Oliver's Days, whom the LORD has over-turned according to our
Prophecies to them. And Going NAKED -- As VV. S. went Three Years Naked;
sometimes in Sackcloth and Ashes, and his Face all Black; and so Black should
be the Persecutors; and so should they be stripped, as he was: which came to
pass. (And Paul Numbered his Stripes (as 2 Cor. 11.) but it would be hard to
Number ours, that we received in New England.) And the Mayor of Cambridge
received him in (and Several Persons of Quality took him in) and put his Gown
upon him; and did see, there was more in the thing, then the blind, dark Spirit
in R. W. that prints it over and over in his Book: who remains still in his
Envious spirit. Which some in New England have done the same, and have gone as
a SIGN, and a Shame of your Nakedness of that which ye professed; yet in the
Innocence of God's holy Spirit: Which they rather had chosen Death in their own
Wills, then to have gone, as they have done. And God* Almighty will Judge R. W.
for his Hard Speeches against them.

AND yet for all these Sufferings and Persecution ( Pharaoh^ like) as the Jews
Outward did grow, so the Jews Inward do grow for all the Persecutions of the
Spiritual Pharaohs: And Christ Jesus, the Captain of their Salvation, does lead
them in the Land of the Living; whose Praise is of God, and not of Man. And we
would have all the World to know, and all the New-England-Professors with R.
W. that we seek not the Praise of Men: and do expect no other, but that they
should speak all manner of Evil of us; that they might fulfill Christ's words.

R. W. But we do perceive, that R. W. is troubled, That we should print our
Sufferings, and give forth such a Catalogue of them. p. 177.


Answ. To evidence God's supporting Power and Hand, that does support them: and
to manifest New-England's BLOODY Hands; though we Appealed Three-Times to
England, but ye BLODY Persecutors regarded it not (although R. W. now in his
Epistle seems to Flatter the KING) yet in time ye may be reckoned withal,
when ye have filled up your Measure; the Al-seeing God will Reward you! And the
LORD GOD alone, who has been our Protector, and Helper and Supporter, (and we
had none in the Earth to help us, but him; and) HE is the Revenger of our
Cause: And so we leave it to him.

And Deuteronomy: 13: The false Prophets with the Signs and Wonders R. W. with his
New-England-Priests may keep at home, with all the rest, that is got up since.
Yet the Christians were not to do unto the false Prophets and Blasphemers, as
they did in the time of the Law; which was, To run them through, and Stone them
to Death: If so, Christ and the Apostles might have Run many false Prophets and
Blasphemers through, that blasphemed against him. But he told them the
Judgments, and Condemnation and the Misery, that would come upon all them,
that sin against the Holy Ghost: as R. W. is found in Blasphemy against the
Holy Ghost, and the Light of Christ, and calls it an Idol. Christ came not to
destroy men's Lives but to save them. And --

R. W. Brings ( G. F. fol. p. 64:) Jerem: Ives saying [ The Writings of the
Scriptures may be burned; but the Word of God contained in them may not b^
burned.] G. F.'s Answ: [If he had said, The Word, that it speaks of, or
testifies of, he had spoken proper, like Scripture; but to say, The Word of
God is contained in the Writings, and the VVritings say, It testifies of
Christ the Word, there is a Proof to thee, that the Quakers are sent of God,
who speak to thee of the Scriptures right as they are.] So R. W. has taken a
few of G. F.'s words, and left out the Ground and Reason of the Matter. And R.
W. brings his words to no purpose, meaning to maintain his false Position by.
And then thou tellest a Story of the Jews, Papists, Manasse Ben-Israel: and
Paul in his mad Conscience, etc. (p. 178.)

Answ. And in Paul's mad Conscience thou and the Priests and Professors in New
England, and the Papists are in, who bel^eve not in the Light of Christ, that
ye may become Children of Light: And so ye are in the Unconverted State, like
Saul.

R. W. And then thou tell a great Story of David slaying Uriah, and the best
Kings of Judah suffering the High Places and Asa's Imprisoning the Prophet, etc.

Answ. But did not that Prophet Suffer truly for the sake of the Word of God?
And so did the Apostles: And have not we amongst you? Yet we tell you, the
Word of God is not Bound.

R. W. And then thou tellest us of Peter's rash Using the Sword (to wit, the
Outward.)

Answ. But Peter did not Use it always: it has been the Devil's Aim in you all
To Afflict, to Punish one another to Death, page 179.
and Destroy about Religion; which was not the Practice of Christ and his
Disciples. And how can we slight the Saints, or Fellow Sufferers in all Ages,
when our Brethren Souls cry under the Altar (as the Martyrs of JESUS did of
Old) whom ye have HANGED and put to Death? And --

R. W. brings G. F.'s Fol. (p. 51, 253, 99.) Who forbids to receive into
their Houses --

Answ. Such as bring not the Doctrine of Christ, as John says Who-so-ever
transgresses, and abides not in the Doctrine of Christ, has not God.
Therefore if any come unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not
into your Houses, neither bid him God speed. Now, how can we Bid R. W. and the
New-England-priests GOD SPEED in their Persecutions with Pen, Tongue and Hand?
Yet we can receive them as Men, but not as Christians in the Doctrine of
Christ, nor his Believers in the Light, as Christ commands; for that he
calls an Idol. And how can thou be Received in our Houses as a Christian?
And how can we Receive any of the New-England-Persecutors as Christians, which
have so persecuted with the Sword, which thou say, are no true Christians
nor Followers of Jesus? yet as Men we can, but not as Ministers of Christ. And
had thou been in the Days of the Sufferings of the Martyrs, thou would
have spoken then as much against John Fox and the Martyrs, as thou do against
us: as the Papists now speak against them, and would not look upon them then,
as true Sufferers, no more then thou and the New-England-priests and professors
look upon Us now, as true Sufferers.

R. W. And whereas thou say: As it is possible for God's own Children to
hold (and that obstinately) false Principles, so it is possible, for other of
God's Children as obstinately to afflict and punish those others to Death, etc.

Answ. This is contrary to Scripture to affirm, That any of God's Children, who
are born of the Spirit, can be found in such a Practice, as to punish God's
Children, and true Christians with Death (according to thy own Assertion) or
any other upon a Religious Account. For though the Apostle says; He that was
born after the Flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit; yet we
never read, that he that was born of the Spirit, did persecute him, that was
born of the Spirit, that was a Child of God: And so in this thou have affirmed
a false Assertion. And so our Sufferings differ from the Persecutors, as Light
from Darkness: For we maintain the Purity of the holy Scriptures and the Words
of God there, against all the vain Traditions, vain Meanings and vain
Imaginations of Men, and say, They are plain to all, that have an Understanding
of them by the Spirit of God.

And we have not suffered, as for Childrens Baubels, Fantastical Traditions of
Men, Inventions and Dreams, nor Earthly* Dignities, etc. but for the Pure Life
of Truth and the Name of JESUS (the Lord knows it!) by such, as got the Form
of Godliness, and the Sheeps-Clothing; and persecuted the true Sheep, that
heard Christ's Voice. And we do not Endeavor to Trample (as ye and the Pope do)
the Bodies of Saints under Feet. And John (in Revel.) he speaks of his
Sufferings and Tribulations, which we h^ve a Fellow-Feeling of: which our
Persecutors, page 180.
that cannot own the Light of Christ JESUS, have not, who scoff at us: and so
he would have done at the Apostle John, if he had been in his Days. And so as
for Fierce, Heady, Proud, Conceit R. W. might have kept at home.

R. W. And thou say: No question, some of them have a Notion of Wrath yet to
come: and therefore rather then to endure Fire of Hell, they will give up their
Lives to the Flames, and others of them Fast 40. Days, etc.

Answ. R. W. thou have manifest thy persecuting Birth and Ignorance both of us
and the holy Men of God: for it is not in Wrath we suffer, but in Love to God
and his Son. And ye Foul and Adulterous spirits would make Rapes of his
Virgins; and before they will loose their Dignity and their Testimony of JESUS,
they will DIE in Love to their Savior, that died for them And why do thou
scoff at Fasting? many of us have Fasted 30. or 40. Days together. And thou
often tellest of a John Fox; but I must tell thee and the New-England-Men, ye
have no Lot nor Part in that neither, who are Persecutors, in the Spirit of
them that persecuted them. And did not the Martyrs turn their Sufferings unto
the Glory of God? and so have we; though Ungodly Men, ( like Wolves,) have
hunted us ( like) Innocent Lambs and Christ's Chickens. And when ye have done,
we have said, The Lord forgive you, if it be his Will! And have not ye been
Unthankful for your Peace and Liberties, and forgotten the time, when ye were
called to an Account? And now ye are at Ease your selves, persecuting others
with Pen, Tongue and Hand. And it is known, the Quakers have Confessed their
Sins to him, that is able to forgive and pardon them, and has died for them;
therefore they do not come to the New-England-priests and R. W. and make them
Popes to Confess their Sins to them: who are Miserable Comforters, and will
tell them, They must have a Warfare with their Sins, while they Live, till they
go to the Grave.

R. W. And thou say: Some of them say, they can sin no more against God,
then God can sin against them.

Answ. It Is like, this is some of the Ranters; had it been the Quakers, R. W.
would have told their Names in print. But (however) R. W. might have put their
Names in print, and where they lived, then we might have known the truth of his
Assertion, and where they had been: for we deny all such Blasphemy and
Blasphemers.

But does not R. W. say often, That Repentance is a turning the Soul to God as
God from all Sin? (in his 6. false Charge) But is not your Confessing of Sin
like Pharaoh's and Judas's? For have not ye been Confessing these 20. or 30. or
40. years, but when will ye Forsake? Pharaoh was such a Confessor, as ye are,
and yet persecuted, so your Confession is Just like Pharaoh's. -- But has R.
W. and the New England-Priests and Professors showed any Meek or Patient
Spirit, or Thankfulness either? But we do not say, but they said over these
Words, (and so R. W. says) as the Papist Parrot said over the Pater Noster;
but ye have Persecuted the Meek, Patient, Thankful Sufferers of Christ Jesus:
And ye like a Frozen, Hard-hearted People have not been Sensi^le of his People,
nor God's Mercies to you.

And as for a People (thou speak of) professing Christianity, so Fierce, so
Heady, High-minded, Hardened, Censuring, Reviling, p. 181.
Cursing, Damning, Savage, Barbarous, etc. R. W. might very well have kept this
at Home.

And G. F. and G. B. do not Spit out Fire and Brimstone against
New-England-Persecutors; but tell you, what will be your Portion: and our
Desires are, that you might Repent.

R. W. And thou say; Some of their Predictions have and may come to pass, as
do also of Conjurers and Witches.

Answ. Nay R. W. ye shall find it the True Spirit and Power of God, and the
New England People; and not like Readiness Cause, that went to the Witch. But R.
W. we do very well remember* how the New-England-Professors Searched Two Women
of the Servants of God, under pretense of being Witches, to the Shame of all
Modesty and Christianity. But the Proverb concerning the Cow with Short Horns,
we have found the New-England-Priests and Professors Horns Long enough; but
thine is Short enough, because thou live under a Government, which does not
Persecute for Religion. But it has pleased God to put a Hook in your Jaws,
that ye take no more the Lives of the Saints of God. And --

R. W. Thou say: When the Devil is a Fisher, longing for troubled and
bloody Waters; yet God has graciously proved so many of the bloody Prophecies
of th^se VVaspish Prophets and Prophetesses, etc.

Answ. R. W. might have applied this at home, and his New-England-Priests, and
his Sister with him (as in p. 114. her Prophecy there.) AND what has R. W. and
New-England-Priests and Professors been Fishing in? and whose Fishers are they?
let their BLOODY hands and GALLOVSES speak, to be Persecutors of the Lambs of
Christ Jesus, and Kickers against the Pricks ( Saul-like) they pricked their own
Heels.

R. W.'s Thirteenth false Charge [These many Books and VVritings are extremely
poor, lame and naked, swelled up only with High Titles, words of Boasting and
Vapor.] I could never pick out any Wheat (of solid, rational heavenly Truth)
out of their Heap's of Chaff, and Dreams and Fancies of New Christ's, New
Spirits, etc.

Answ. No more then the Chief Priests could pick out of Christ's and the
Apostles Doctrine, who looked upon him as a Babbler and pestilent Fellow, and a
Setter-forth of New Gods. And we do believe, that those Persecutors never read
our Books for any Good, with any good mind, but that which is Chaffy: It was
not like, that the Persecutors with tongue, pen and hand should read the
Persecuteds Books for any Good.

R. W. And W. E. said; The Word was as a Fire, and a Hammer, p. 182.
etc. and thou say: The Word, that we meant, was but a Painted Fire and
Hammer, and never broke, nor burned up Sin.

Answ. It Is like, R. W. never Felt nor Heard the Word of God yet, at least,
Received it: and it is not like, when he is pleading so much for his Hat and
Knee, and his Honor. But the Saying of Christ is come upon thee; I know you,
that ye have not the Love of God in you; and ye have not the Word of God
abiding in you: for whom God has sent, him Ye believe not: (John 5.) But thou will feel it a Hammer and a Fire, the Pharisees and all. The Jews might have
said so to the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, who preached the Word to the
Persecutors; they might have said, It is a Painted Hammer, and a Painted Fire;
for it does not burn us, nor it does not break us: But what is become of those
Jews? And what will become of R. W. and of those New-England-Priests, who do
not Resist only, but Persecute? And Peter and Jude telling the Saints of Clouds
without Rain, and Trees without Fruits, and Wells without Water, and Wandering
Stars, and Waves of the Sea casting up Mire and Dirt; This R. W. and the Church
in New England might have kept to themselves, and truly applied: For what else
have they brought forth? And he might have put in Korah, Balaam and Cain, who
Killed his Brother about Religion. And the Reader may see, what Abundance of
Mire and Dirt he has Cast up in his Book against God's People from the Wave of
his Sea. And we do believe, Christ and his Spirit is New to him, who calls
his Light an IDOL.

R. W. And again thou bring'st Theora John, and say; Let that Monster of
Delusion be viewed, whose Bodily Raptures and Frantic Writings of the Quakers
Principles, and of the Jews, etc.

Answ. R. W. has brought this Man oftentimes over to stuff up his Book, as
though he wanted matter: and it is known to all in London, that knew him, that
he was never a Quaker. And yet this R. W. (who has sold himself to work
Wickedness, and given up himself to Lie) often brings this Theora John as a
Quaker; which is known, he was no such Man. So with one Lie he brings to
prove another: But R. Williams, the Lord will reward thee! And as for John
Chandler, thou have produced nothing out of his Writings.

R. W. And thou say, Thou have read Nicholas and Naylor, Howgil, Borough,
Farnsworth, Fox, Dewsberry, Pennington, Whitehead and Bishop. --

Answ. It Is like, for an Evil End: out of them and G. F.'s thou have not proved
thy false Charges. And so, the Old Serpent (thou speak of) has been too
Crafty for thee, and brought thee to the Brim of the Lake, that burns with Fire
and Brimstone (which thou appliest to us) and thou have Stuff enough to kindle
it R. W.

R. W. And G. F. saying Fol. p. 282.) You where you are, page 183.
Sees him not, instead of See: (and page. 19.) The Churches Was to hear,
instead of were. --

Answ. What a great piece of Business of one Word, was for were, and one Letter
[ s] is too much: And this R. W. has found out in a Book of 374. pages. This
was, and the single s he has made a great Clamor about it up and down the Book
(though he has committed the same Error (in his Twenty Nineth page of his
Book) where he says: Till these Gusts was over, instead of were over:) And R.
W. do thou not think, that these two small Faults might have been overseen in
the Press? Which had thou had either Modesty or Charity, thou might have
past it over, and not cried out against it in thy Book so often over, Lame,
Nonsense, Silly, etc. And we could make a Catalogue of Errors and Gross Errors
in thy Book, both of False Spelling and Nonsense, and let thee see, how thou
have Spelt several of our Friends Names, and other Names and Matters in thy
Book (as instead of Jerem. Ives thou have spelt Jews: here are two Letters
wrong in one word, which has but four in it, p. 178.) Which are so many, that
we shall not trouble the Reader with them. But let the Reader read, and he may
find enough: whether it be his own Fault, or the Printers, we shall leave that.
-- AND for these Two small things, that thou have found out in his great Book,
thou scoffingly call Proud Brute, Proud insulting Souls and Spirits, and
Boys English, and G. F.'s Ignorance of English. And this thou have published to
the World, that all may see thy Folly. But we shall not rail so at thee.

I will Instance one or two Passages in the same page, where R. Williams is
reproving of G. F. for false English with all those foul Expressions, where
thou say (speaking of the Kingdom of God) It consists in Peace and Joy in
the Holy Spirits; Where it should be Spirit. And in the same Line thou say:
As they Impiously and simply speaks [instead of speak.] We instance but these,
because it is the very same page, where R. W. is throwing all those Names upon
G. F. for Two Literal Mistakes. And so thy Proud, Insulting Soul and Spirit is
thwarted and crossed in thy own page: and whether this be ^oys English or no, let
the English Judge. -- And what thou bring'st from page 300. and 110. (of G.
F.'s Fol.) is false; for there are no such Scriptures in those places.

BUT thou have not only wronged the English, but the Hebrew and the Greek
(which thou boastest so much of) and more Materially, then G. F. As the Reader
may see (B. p. 112.) Where instead of Metapuroteresios (which is ^alse Greek)
thou should have said, Meta parateresios ( -- (...)) -- And whereas thou
say (in the same page) viz. [ The Greek word (...) in some of the Margents
is rendered Among, that is* Unto you, Upon you: as Luke 11. If I by the Finger
of God cast out Devils, surely, the Kingdom of God is come upon you.] -- But
the word (...) is not in that place cited by thee (to wit, Luke 11.) but ((...)
or (...)) And the proper Signification of the Word (...) is Within, and not
Among. Scapula in his Dictionary brings diverse Authors proving, (...) Within
that it signifies INTRA, that is Within, but none, that it signifies Among.
etc. -- And thy Ignorance of the Hebrew thou have showed (page 200, etc.)
asserting, That the Hebrew and Greek signify no more Thou than You, etc.
Whereas it is known, they both distinguish the Singular from the Plural, and do
not mean ye or you, when they say thou; nor thou, when they say, ye or you, as
those that skill those Languages, do know, etc.

AND it is not proved, that G. F. or we ever despised any that were Good or
Godly, as the Scripture speaks.

R. W. Thou say: There is no God, no Christ, no Spirit, but what is within
them.

Answ. Thou say so often over and over in thy Book but these are not our
words; but thy own Forgeries. For we own One God (as we have often said) the
Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all (Ephesians. 4.)
And G. F. and we are in the True Love and Fear of God, etc. and do not puff at
any, that be in the Knowledge of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ: but we would
have them to mind the Grace of God, that has appeared to them, and the Light
and his good Spirit, that they have grieved; and believe in the Light of
Christ, which thou call an Idol. And we know, Sweet Odors cannot come from a
Spirit of Persecution. But --

R. W. says: p. 184.
But -- G. F. will be found to adore an Image and Crucifix for the true Lord
Jesus, etc.

Answ. Nay R. W. thou art nearer that Condition, who call the Light of the
true Lord Jesus an Idol; which we never heard the Papists, that adore Images
and Crucifix, did: He is better built upon the Foundation of the Prophets,
Christ and the Apostles.

R. W. Thou say: For does not this proud Censor know, that Men may be true
Saints in their persons, --

Answ. So not in their hearts: if they be true Saints in person, is that
Sufficient?

R. W. -- and yet be subject to sudden Falling Fits?

Answ. But R. W. and the New-England-Priests, did David walk with God with a
perfect heart, when he committed Adultery and Murder? And whether these
Actions did not defile his Pers^n? And if so; then how can they be True Saints
in their Persons? Surely, R. W. would be a Saint and a Ranter (and the rest of
the New-England-Persecutors.) And R. W. was finding Fault with the Ranters; but
I never heard any bring such Sayings of the Ranters before R. W. AND thou
speak of Peter denying, etc. But the Scripture says, If the Righteous fall,
they shall rise again: but the Wicked shall fall into Mischief. And R. W. it
appears, that he was never out of the Fall yet, who says; There is no
Motion, nor Voice to be heard within of Heavenly things and supernatural Light:
and calls the Light, which John bare Testimony of, a Frantic Light and an
Idol.

R. W. And thou say: After Christ's Ascension Peter played the Hypocrite,
and the D^ssembler.

Answ. But where does Paul call him a Hypocrite and Dissembler, as thou do?
Read Gal. 2. and let him see, if Paul there calls Peter Hypocrite? And --

R. W. Thou bring the Fathers in Godliness, and famous Kings in God's
Church, of their Incivilities of many Wives, and Impiety of Worshipping, etc.

Answ. How can thou say, these are Fathers in Godliness, when thou chargest
them with Incivilities and Impieties? For Godliness cannot be Impiety, and
Uncivil thou can not make Godly, when they acted these things. But the
Prophets writing these things (as the Apostle says) were writ for Examples and
Warnings, that we should not follow such things: for the End of the Prophets
and Apostles Writings of such as fell and rise, was, that God's People should
shun such Impieties and Evils; and not for the Wicked to make use of the
Scriptures to plead for Sin and say, Such a one did such a Sin, and strengthen
themselves in the Evil. But the Apostle says, They were for our Examples, to
the Intent, we should not lust after Evil things, as they also lusted. So here
the Apostle does not grant any Allowance for the Best to Sin: as thou by the
Conparison of the Goldsmith seem to infer, who gives his Allowance (as thou
say) to the best Gold, etc. But God gives no such Allowance, Christ's
Command is to the Contrary.

And G. F. in all his Book never called them, that were truly Humble and Able,
Godly and Conscientious, Vipers, Serpents, Cains, false Prophets, Pharisees,
dumb Dogs, etc. Reprobates, etc. But must we not tell a Pharisee, that he is a
Pharisee? Persecutors, they are Persecuting, like Uipe^s and Serpents? did not
Christ call them so? Yea, such were the Great Church of the Jews, (like the
New-England-Church.) And does not the Apostle say, Christ is in you, except ye
be Reprobates? And thou, that call the Light an Idol, and Christ within a
Fancy, and so, art not thou a R^probate? And have not the New-England-Priests
and Professors manifest themselves, to be like them, that Killed their Brethren
for Religion and about Sacrifice? And greedy, dumb Dogs, does not Isaiah call
them so, that can never have enough? the Shepherds, that cannot understand?
they all look to their own Way, every one for his Gain from his Quarter? Let
all People look, whether all the New-England-Priests do not seek for their Gain
from their Quarter? And are not they Dogs? and have not they TORN the FLESH of
the Lambs of the true Lord Jesus? And are they not Dumb as to God? for thou
say, There is no Voice nor Motion within in Heavenly things, in matters of
Supernatural Light to be listened to or hearkened to?

R. W. Thou say again, That G. F. denies the Scriptures to be the Word of
God.

Answ. This has been answered over and over. We tell thee, what the Scriptures
say of themselves, to wit, The WORDS of GOD: ( Exodus 20. Revel. 22.) And thou
therefore say, Thou can not prove them in plain words of Scripture, that
they call themselves the WORD. And if thou wast an Orator (as thou say) thou
would not speak such a thing over so often, because of which we are fain to
Answer thee in so many pages: And do not Scriptures signify Writings.

R. W. And thou say: G. F. says, that every Man in the World has that
Spirit, that gave forth Scriptures --

Answ. This is Answered over and over. But R. W. does not the Holy Spirit, that
leads the Saints into all Truth, reprove the World of Sin? etc. ( John 16,
8.) though they do not or will not receive it.

R. W. -- And that all Saints are Acted by the Spirit Immediately, that moved
the Prophets and the Apostles.

Answ. And what then? will R. W. deny the Saints from having the Spirit to Act
them, as the Apostles and Prophets had?

R. W. Thou say: All this tends to nullify and vilify the Holy Scriptures.
p. 185.


Answ. This is thy Ignorance: Can any Confirm and Establish the Scriptures
without the Spirit, that gave them forth? But what must we Infer from R. W's.
words? That he and his New England- priests have not the Spirit, as the
Prophets had, that gave forth the Scriptures, to lead them into all truth? And
That the Holy Ghost does not reprove the World? And this to prove himself and
his New-England-Teachers degenerated from the Doctrine and Spirit of Christ and
his Apostles; and only to have the Form of Godliness, and denying the Spirit
and Power thereof?

R. W. And thou say again: G. F. says in his Book, The Scriptures are not
the Word of God; and speak Concerning every Word, that proceeds from the
Mouth of God.

Answ. Then they are Words, if they be Every Word: and Every Word of God is
fresh Food to us. And his Saints we know; but your Imaginations we cannot feed
upon. And --

R. W. Also the word Trinity, and Sacrament, Oh! how Zealous is this Fox for
the purity of Language! Why may not the word Humane be used, as well as
Sabbath? etc. which are Hebrew words, as well as the word Bap^ism, etc. which
are Greek words.

Answ. But where does thou read in the Scripture, the word Humane and Trinity?
Let Us see, where it is written? for thou say, It Is the Rule and Touchstone,
give us Chapter and Verse, that we may Touch it. And so, it is thou, that have
Catched here and there G. F.'s Sentences, like a wild Indian (as thou speak
of) but in all thou have done, thou have not proved thy false Assertions. And
--

R. VV. says: Any sober Soul may read in most of their Books, and in G. F.'s
Book such Tautologies and needless Repetitions, page 186.
that may even turn the Stomach, and make him ab^or to touch a Quakers Book.

Answ. Truly R. VV. of all the Books that ever we have read, we did never read
so much of Tautologies over and over the same thing (and so much of false
English, whether it be the Ignorance of R. Williams the Orator, or the Printer,
we shall leave it) and therefore we are fain to Answer thee over and over the
same thing, as we were to Answer the priests in Oliver's Days the same thing
over and over. And therefore in this if any one is to be found Fault withal, it
is the priests and R. VV. But --

R. W. says: G. F. had many Bullets flying about his Ears, etc.

Answ. But none of those Persecutors Bullets (nor thine) touched him nor us
neither; ^ot we were (and are) Armed with the Breast Plate of Righteousness,
and with the Armor of Light, and the Shield of Faith, and the Helmet of
Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, the WORD of GOD: and the Armor of
Light, which thou say, is simply called Light: R. VV. can scarcely speak of
the Light of Christ without scoffing (at it.)

R. VV. says: He cannot but observe, that all along he notoriously nibbles ar
words, and quarrels at words. (p. 185.)

Answ. Now R. VV. Is this good English, Nibbles a^ words? And so R. VV. might
have applied this at home, This proud Bladder is big with Simon Magus: And High
and Haughty R. VV. might very well have applied this at home also, who is
Puffed up and Swelled up against the true Lord Jesus Christ, and his Light and
his people, in whom Christ rules. And --

R. VV. brings Henry Haggar (G. F. fol. p. 253.) saying, [ You call all Men
Dead and Carnal in the Serpent's Nature, in what Form soever they differ from
you.] G. F. Answers: [All that are not in the Light (to wit, of Christ, that
Lights every Man, that comes into the World, which is the Way to the Father)
Differ from us: such be Dead, such be Carnal in the Serpent's Nature: For none
comes to the Life, but who comes to the Light, in what Form soever they be.
And such as Differ from us, Differ from Christ: For none comes from under the
Serpent's Head and Nature, but who comes to the Light (to wit, of Christ.] For
how can they be in Unity with God and his People, and hate the Light, and call
it an Idol, as R. VV. does? But R. VV. falls a railing and says: This proud
Soul -- What Julian the Apostate, what Duke D' Alva, what Wolsey could have
spoken more Imperiously, Insultingly and Bloodily, then this Wild Fox has done
against all the true Servants and Witnesses of the Most-High, etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see the Railing of this Orator. But who are these
Witnesses, that R. W. speaks of? Such as are not in the Light of Christ
Jesus, which enlightens every Man, that comes in the World, They are not in
the Way to the Father, which is CHRIST the Light; then they must be such, as
Differ from Christ and his Saints in the Light: and how can these be True
Witnesses? but must be like R. W. that says, The Light of Christ and the Light
within is a Fancy, a simple Light, a frantic Light, an Idol. So R. VV. might
have kept his Flood of Fire and Brimstone at home, for it touches us not.

And G. F. plainly makes a Distinction of such as hate the Light, hate Christ;
that have Errred from the Light, and quenched the Spirit: They have the Name
and Titles, that Christ gave to them. p. 187.188.


And 1 Cor: 6: 1 Timothy: 9. are owned, as they speak: And the Dreadful Voice of
God in Job has not knocked out our brains, but opened our Understandings. And
we do not make a Noise about our Bibs, and Aprons and Muckingers; These words
thou might have kept at home, who find Fault with us, because we own the
Apostle's Doctrine: and so thou might as well have found Fault with him, who
taught the Saints Concerning Apparel; but this Doctrine R. VV. slighteth.

R. VV. And thou say again: God is not properly a Spirit, no more then he is
Light.

page 189.
Answ. Yet Christ says, The Father is a Spirit, ( Joh. 4.) And that Message
the Apostles bore of God, they said; In him was Light, and no Darkness: In this
thou art Erred from Christ and his Doctrine ( Joh. 1.)

R. VV. And 1. Cor: 6: Ephesians. 2. These we own, as they speak: And thou
confessest, That God dwelled in his Temple of Old, as a Man in his House, and a
King in his Palace.

Answ. And does not he Dwell now in his Saints by his Light and Spirit? But the
Quakers never said, That the House, the outward Man is God: But how can thou
say, That God or Christ dwells in Man, when thou call'st his Light an IDOL?
-- But Henry Haggar is fully Answered in the Answer to the Appendix (p. 163,
etc.) where he brings him. And --

R. VV. brings Sam. Eaton ( G. F. Fol: p. 2.) saying [ That the Scripture is
to Judge of Doctrines and Manners.] G. F. Answ. [The Jews had not an Infallible
Judgment, that had Scriptures; but stood against Christ the Light, and Judged
him to be a Devil: and that Judgment was not Infallible. And that Doctrine and
Manners of theirs was not Right, which stood against Christ, the Light.] And R.
VV. thou bring'st David's Saying, The Word is a Light to our feet, and a
Lanthorn to our paths.

Answ. But R. VV. was the New Testament written then, and many of the Prophets?
And if not; What Word was it then, that was a Lanthorn and a Light to David?
Was it not the same Word, that came to Jacob, before Scripture was written? Why
does Christ say, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have Eternal
Life; and they testify of me: but ye will not come to me that ye might have
(Eternal) Life? And were not the Jews in the Ditch, and are still with R. VV.
and the rest of Persecutors of Christ the WORD, that became Flesh? And did not
the Apostles preach the Word, that was made Flesh, to the Jews and Heathen? And
were not the Jews mad against the Apostles, that preached the Word, and had
Scriptures? and against Christ the Word? And did they not say, Christ was a
Deceiver? (as thou say now, his Light is a Fancy, and a Whimsical Christ
within?) SO we may see through all Scriptures of the Prophets, in the Days of
Christ and the Apostles, in what a Rage they were against the Word of God,
though they had Scriptures, which testified of him, the WORD. And we bid you,
Search the Scriptures, and see, if they do not Testify of Christ's the WORD.

And could the Jews try the Prophets, and Christ's and the Apostles Spirit by
Scripture, that would not come to Christ the Word? p. 190.
May not the Devil, and Antichrist and all the false Prophets of the World get
Scriptures; and persecute Christ and his Followers?

R. VV. brings Priest Eaton ( G. F. Fol. p. 3.) saying [ That God did not
intend Immediate Teaching, nor to give out any Immediate Voice in After-ages,
which should direct and guide Men in the way of Salvation.] G. F. Answ. [Which
is contrary to Scripture, which says; All the Children of the Lord shall be
taught of the Lord: and ( Joh. 8, 47.) He that is of God, hears God's Word;
and that is Immediate, and lives and abides for Ever. And there is no
Fallibility nor Delusion in the Revelation of God, but all Fallibility and
Delusion is out of it.] And R. VV. replies and grants, That God speaks
Mediately unto us by the Light of Nature within us.

Answ. And R. VV. says: (p. 38. in his Book) There is no Voice nor Motion
within to be hearkened unto or listened to in heavenly things, etc. But R. W.
where does the Apostle say, That God speaks Mediately to us by a Light of
Nature within us? And Ephesians. 4. proves it not, and Job 33. But --

R. VV. Thou say, The Private Prayers, and Fastings and Meditations of the
Saints Day and Night are Holy Means, p. 191.
in and by which the Eternal God speaks Peace, etc.

Answ. And what! No Motion and Voice within heard of Heavenly things in the
dark Heart R. W? How do thou Contradict thy self! What are all thy Prayers
and Meditations and Fastings good for then? And Paul heard a Voice and saw
Light; and the Jailer knew the Earthquake: And Cornelius heard a Voice.

R. VV. And thou say: The Immediate Teachings of God by Dreams, etc. and by
Voices and Motion, the holy Scripture mentions many, before and since the
Coming of the Lord Jesus, etc.

Answ. Here R. VV. confutes Samuel Eaton the Priest, and confutes himself,
which says, There is no Voice nor Motion to be heard within of Heavenly
things: And then how can he say, The Immediate Teachings of God by Voice, etc.
before the Coming of Christ and since the Scripture is full of; and yet nothing
of it himself? And then, whether to these Voices people must not hearken, which
thou call the Immediate Teaching of God? For thou say --

R. W. But whether it be a Christian Obedience, or Diabolical Laziness to fling
off all Means ( as G. F. all a long teaches) to sit still and listen to an
Immediate Teaching, that is (I say) to the Devil's Whisperings, etc.

Answ. R. VV. Art not thou Lazy, and followest a Diabolical Spirit, and
followest the Devil's Whisperings, that Obeyest not the Immediate Teaching of
God by his Voice, which thou confessest, before Christ's Coming and since? And
what! do thou call the Immediate Teachings the Devil's Whisperings? Which we
deny. And G. F. does not deny all Means, nor Cast it off; for if No Man knows
the things of God, but by the Spirit of God, Then this must be the only Means.

And (1.) We do not say R. VV. That all, that pretend to Revelations, are the
Revelations of God. (2.) And we do not say, That all that pretend Light, that
it is the Light of Christ; but Diabolical Darkness, as R. VV.'s is, who calls
the Light of Christ a Fancy. And (3) Thou can not Receive any true Revelation
and Teaching of God without hearing Voice or Motion: neither can thou weigh
them with thy Natural Reason; For the Natural Man does not perceive the things
of God: For the Prophets, that taught the things of God, were looked upon as
Mad, as thou do upon us. And ye cannot Try Revelations nor Inspirations by
the outward Letter, no more than the Pharisees, which judged the Revelations of
the Son of God, and persecuted his Apostles, who preached the Revelation of the
Gospel.

And how do thou differ from Mahomet or the Papists, and the Powhows, that
have No Voice or Motion within in Heavenly things in matters of Supernatural
Light? And seeing, thou have No Voice nor Motion in Heavenly things within
thee, how can thou do otherwise, p. 192.
but to take the Whisperings of the Devil within thee? -- And yet thou bring
Scriptures to make use of for thy own Ends, as the Devil and Antichrist dos,
to MVRTHER and Destroy the Lambs of Christ with his Murdering Spirit: and from
that he has Motions enough within, and Voices to do Wickedness. And what Voice
or Motion was that in R. VV. to have us to be PVNISH'D? or Voice or Motion in
the New-England-Priests, that WHIPPED and put some of us to DEATH? Is not the
same in Mahomet? but is not the Voice of Christ, that Came to SAVE Men's Lives,
and not to destroy them.

R. VV. brings Samuel Eaton ( G. F.'s Fol. p. 4.) saying, [ The Gospel is the
Letter, etc.] G. F.'s Answ. [The Apostle says, It is the Power of God unto
Salvation to every one that believes; and The Letter Kills: and many may
have the Form, and deny the Power, and so stand against the Gospel, which is
the Power of God.] But why did not R. VV. put in Priest Eaton's Saying, That
Timothy was Commanded to preach, and yet had not heard, nor seen, nor handled
any thing of Christ? ( Fol. p. 4.) And why did not he put in those words of the
Priest, There is an Immediate Voice within, which we have never heard, and do
not know it within our selves Experimentally; and we believe and hope, that we
shall never know it? ( Fol. p. 5.) AND then ye shall never know it. -- And R.
VV. replieth and tells us, What the word Gospel signifies, English and Saxon
[This is nothing to the purpose:] And further he says: This Wise Cunning Man,
(G. F.) etc. and says, I know the trick of these Old Cheaters and Jugglers,
etc.

Answ. And what R. VV! Was the Apostle a Juggler and a Cheater, who said, The
Gospel was the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that believes (Romans
1.) and a subtle Deceiver? (as read thy page 192) And is not this Good News
Glad Tidings to every Believer, that knows the Gospel to be the Power of God
unto Salvation? p. 193.
And R. VV. do not thou call the Light, which Christ has enlightened us and
every Man, that comes into the World, withal, a Fancy and an Idol?

R. VV. And then thou say; These bewitched Souls will not own Figurative
Speeches.

Answ. Yes; this is false: for we own all, which the Scriptures call so; but
does the Apostle call the Gospel, which is the Power of God unto Salvation, a
Figurative Speech? and if so, what did the Power of God Figure forth? prove it
by Scripture. And can the Jews receive the Gospel, but by the Power of God? and
then by Revelation: And we question, whether R. VV. and his New-England-priests
ever knew the Gospel; for if he did, we should not have such foul Language of
him. And we own the Gospel (Romans 2.) as the Apostle calls it, ( Romans 1.)

For the Gospel is not called the Power of God Figuratively, but Properly,
according to the Apostle's words: and if the Declaration of the Gospel can be
called the Gospel, that is Figurative; as when the Description or Map of
England is called England. And G. F. had good Reason to oppose the Priest
calling the Letter the Gospel, because thereby they would assume to themselves
the Privilege of being Preachers of the Gospel, because of their preaching the
Letter (which at best is but Figuratively so, while they are both Strangers and
Enemies to that, which is really the Gospel, to wit, the Power of God.) -- AND
as for Paul's calling the Gospel HIS GOSPEL, it makes nothing for R. VV.'s
purpose; no more than David, calling God HIS GOD; which any Saint may do: For
David meant God Really there, and not Figuratively. And Paul was a Minister of
the Power of God, and of God and Christ, and the Spirit, and therefore God and
Christ, and the Power, and the Spirit may in a true Sense be said to be HIS, as
freely given him of God.

And the Story of the Three Foxes is wholly Impertinent, and serves only to
show thy Folly and Malice. Where did we deny a Distinction in such a Case, that
Fox a Beast, should be distinguished from Fox a Man? And how appliest thou that
to the present Matter? And is not thy Malice great to upbraid G. Fox with his
Name, while thou commendest John Fox as an Heavenly Man, having the same
Surname? How is it a Reproach to the one, and not to the other?

Thy Comparison of the Traitor and the King's Pardon, as applied to the Gospel,
etc. is Lame and Silly, because thy Pardon to the Traitor is positive and
particular; and there needs nothing further, but the Writing and the Seal to
make it Effectual. But the Letter is General and Conditional, and a Testimony
only of the Gospel, which is the Power of God, which brings the true Pardon,
where it is received in the Soul, which the Letter does not. R. VV.'s Example
of G. F.'s writing News to his Friends, may be the same way Answered, and shows
his light and malicious Mind.

And whereas thou acknowledgest, That some may have the Letter and Form without
the Power (as G. F. affi^meth there) thou have thereby over-turned thy self:
For so some may have the Letter, p. 194.
and want the Gospel, which is the Power of God: and such (whatever they
pretend to,) are but still Pictures, and not Members of Christ.

The rest of thy work to thy Fifth Instance (page 195.) is nothing but Falsehood
and Malice, as to say, That G. F. preaches an Imaginary and Allegorical
Christ; That he accounts himself or others call him the Only True Christ: Which
is returned upon thy head as Lies. Neither do we Divide the Letter from the
Meaning, nor the Instrument from the Husbandman; We refuse not to call Good
News, Good News. But we know, it is one thing to talk of good things, and
another thing to enjoy and possess them.

And as for thy malicious Talk, That we would be glad to have the Bible Burned;
We return it upon thee as a malicious Lie, and dare thee to prove it. We honor
the Scriptures in their Due Place, and by them can prove R. VV. and such as he,
to be false Teachers and Enemies to Christ and his Gospel.] And --

R. VV. Brings in John Bunyan (G. F. Fol. p. 10.) [ It is not Faith and
Works, p. 195.
that Justify in the Sight of God; ^ut it is Faith and Good Works, which Justify
in the Sight of Men only, etc.] And G. F. Answ. [ Abraham was not Justified to
Men only by his Obedience, but to God; and where Faith is, there is
Justification, which works by Love. And the Saints Faith and Works were not
only to Justify them in the Sight of Men; but the Work of God is to DO what he
says, and his Will: which who do not, are not Justified in so doing; but to be
beaten with Stripes. Who seek to be Justified by their Faith and Works in the
Sig^t of Men, are in a Dead Faith and Works both] -- This R. VV. has brought
in his Book p. 150. and 195. and also he brings it p. 125. and 126. in the same
Book (which is fully Answered page 142, 143.) -- And in p. 125. he calls him
John Bunyar; and page 195. he calls him John Bunian, and yet they are both one
Man's Sayings (as the Reader may see in G. F.'s Fol. p. 110.) and he himself
quotes them both of this page. And if G. F. should have said Bunyar for Bunyan,
as R. VV. (who calls himself Orator) does, he would have cried Simple, and
Lame, and Tautologies, to Answer the same Man's words Twice over in one and the
same Book. -- And R. W. thou say: For what is Justification, but a Pardon
written, and sealed and declared from the King of Heaven to poor, condemned
Traitors? That this Pardon may be merited by any Price, that either we or any
in the World can offer, is denied by true Protestants, etc.

Answ. What must we understand from R. W.'s words? but that Every one
(Protestant,) Papist, Arminian, as he cries against, etc. that has the
written Scripture (which they may purchase for a small Price) has both Pardon
and Justification without Faith and Spirit. And then the Papists, Arminians and
Socinians (that he cries so much against, as well as us) have the
Justification, and written Pardon and Seal, though they know not the Son and
Father, but by Revelation. Then why does the Apostle say, They are Justified by
FAITH? and what is this, to overthrow James's words, that says; Our Father
Abraham was Justified by WORKS? Was this in the Sight of Men R. W. or in the
Sight of God? Which Works were wrought by Faith. And the Apostle tells thee,
that As the Body is dead without the Spirit, so is Faith without Works (Jam. 3.)

And the Apostle says ( Romans 3, 28.) Therefore we conclude, that a Man is
Justified without the Deeds of the Law; being Justified freely by his Grace:
But this does not prove Abraham's being Justified by his Works only, but by his
Faith: And does not the Apostle say; Have ye received the Spirit by the works
of the Law, or hearing of Faith? Now, where is this Voice to be heard, if not
within? And many may cry out of their Sins, and may have the written Pardon or
Justification; and may have the outward written Pardon (which thou call
Justification) and some may cry out of their Sins, and some may not be sensible
of their Sins.

But thou confessest, it was the Lord, that opened Lydias Heart, to give
Attentions unto the Gospel, and so receive a Pardon: Therefore, as the Apostle
says, No Man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God; nor the Son,
nor the Father, but by Revelation, Christ says. But do any receive that
Pardon, but who receive the Light, which Lights every Man that comes into
the world, by which they see their Sins, and him, that pardons them? Seeing
the Pharisees and the Jews this Day, who have the Scriptures, do not receive
this Pardon; seeing the Jews have the Scriptures now, or may have them. And the
Pharisees in the Days of Christ would not receive this Pardon or Justification,
who did not believe in the Light of Christ, as he taught, as ye may see it;
seeing Christ said to the Jews, If ye continue in my words, etc. and, Ye shall
know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you Free: And so they are so now.

And those professing Jews could say to Christ's Face, They were of Abraham,
because they had the Scriptures; but Christ told them, They were of (their
Father) the Devil, and his Lust they would do: As R. VV. and his
New-England-Priests say, They are Christians; but whose Works have they done,
and still do? But If the Son therefore shall make you Free, ye shall be Free
Indeed.

And if all the Righteousness of the Best Men (as R. VV. says) to wit, good
Thoughts, good Words, good Actions, Alms, Prayers, Preachings, Sufferings, be
but as Women's Menstruous and Filthy Clouts, then why does Christ say; Let your
Light so shine before Men, that they may see your good Works, and glorify your
Father, which is in Heaven? And does not the Apostle say, He has Created us
unto Good Works? And what! are the Works of the Saints in the New Covenant so
bad, as the Transgressors were in the Old Covenant (seeing thou have made no
Distinction, but Jumbled all together?) But these are thine and the New England
Persecutors Best-Mens Works.

R. VV. brings Enoch Howet's Saying (Fol: G. F. p. 16.) It is an Expression
of a dark, deluded Mind, to say, that God is not Distinguished from his
Saints.] And G. F. Answ: [But God and Christ is in the Saints, and walks in
them: and he is a Reprobate, page 196.
and out of the Apostle's Doctrine, that denies it.] And R. VV. says: I Reply
to this Canting Gypsy;

Answ. And that is all that he says here, who cannot endure to hear of God and
Christ dwelling in his people. But may not he as well call the Apostle Canting
Gypsy, who preached this Doctrine? (as 2 Cor. 13: and 1 Cor. 6. and 2 Cor: 6.)
And --

R. VV. brings in Ralph Farmer p: 74. [ That God the Creator is distinct from
all Creatures: That Christ being God only in One Person, remains distinct
from all Men and Angels.] Let the Reader read G. F.'s Fol. p. 74. and there is
no such thing in that page: And therefore he has not done, as becomes an
Orator, as he calls himself to the King. Nevertheless R. VV. has given an
Answer to these words (which are not found in the page in G. F.'s Book, that he
quoteth) and says; Is there no Distinction between Infinite and Finite?

Answ. We never said, that the Finite was the Infinite; but this does not
prove, that God and Christ is Distinct from his people, and does not dwell in
them. And --

R. VV. says: G. F. says, his Opposite is a Reprobate: R. VV. asks Why? And
he says; The only Reason G. F. gives, is, because he licks not up the filthy
and Hellish Poison of Fox's Childish and Hellish Blasphemy against the Eternal
Godhead; and cries, poor Dust and Ashes.

Answ. And let the Reader see, It is, because G. F. says, God and Christ will
dwell in his Saints, and walk in them, according to the Apostle's Doctrine. Aad
this Doctrine of Christ and the Apostle he calls Hellish Poison, Childish and
Hellish Blasphemy against the Eternal Godhead: Now let the Gentle Reader see,
how this Man raileth and doteth against the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles
with a Venom under his Tongue! And again --

R. VV. brings Joseph Kellet ( G. F. Fol. 22.) saying [ They be all alien^ted
from God, and Enemies unti^ Faith [but these are R. VV.'s words instead of
until; this should be Nonsense in G. F. but with R. VV. (who calls himself
the King's Orator) it must be Good Sense: who found fault with G. F. because
there was an [^] to much; though this might be the Printers.] G. F. Answ. [So
they have denied their Schoolmaster, which is until Faith; which will keep
them out of the Alienation, which is the Law, as Paul speaks of.] And R. W.
replieth and falls a-railing with many Filthy Words, --

Answ. Which are not worth mentioning here. And Paul Romans 8. Is not this, as
Solomon says, The Legs of the Lame are not Equal, to Contradict thy self? (
Gal. 3.) And then thou go on in a kind of Preaching, but nothing to the
purpose; who cavil'st against the Apostle's words, and manifestest another
Spirit, and can not disprove them. And where-as thou alledgest, That G. F.
his words are uncertain, as Whether the Alienation is the Law? etc. If thou
werest not wilfully Prejudicate and Blind, thou might understand, that the
last word [ Which] is Relative not to the Word Alienation, but Schoolmaster:
for Paul says, The Law was the Schoolmaster unto Christ: and who were under
this Schoolmaster, were not in the Alienation, because they had a Belief in
him to come, although not, as when he was come.

R. W. Thou bring ( G. F. Fol. p. 27.) Baxter's Sayings [ To say, that any
is Perfect and without sin, is the Devil's Speaking in Man.] G. F. Answers
[Contrary to the Language of the Apostles and Christ, page 197.
who bid them, Be Pefect: And the Apostle spoke Wisdom among them that were
Perfect, and said, They were made free from Sin, And it is the Devil's Speaking
in Man, that speaks for Sin, while Men are upon the Earth; for the Devil
holds him up, that makes Men not Perfect: which Truth makes Men Free again
from the Devil, and speaks in Man, and says, Be Perfect.] Here R. W. says,
[ that Be Perfect] and G. F. says [ that Are Perfect:] but is, that Be
Perfect, according to the Grammar, seeing, thou find so much Fault with G.
F?] And R. W. says: The Perfection signifies no more, then Sincerity and
Uprightness.

Answ. Then is R. W. or any of his New-England-Priests and Professors Perfect
in Sincerity, and Vprightness and complete Fullness in its Kind? What Fullness is
this?

R. W. And thou say: Sometimes it is Fortified, Strong and Armed, and
sometimes its the Fullness of the Godhead, to whose Incomprehensible Ocean not
one drop can be given, nor one drop can be taken from him.

Answ. And does not the Apostle say, Of his Fullness we have received Grace for
Grace? And, Grace, and Truth comes by Jesus Christ; and is not this in the
Hearts of God's people? And Christ says, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly
Father is Perfect. And then thou say --

R. W. We are not exhorted to be Equal with God in Holiness, page 198.
for this is to be Equal with God ourselves.

Answ. But Christ, who said, Be ye Perfect, as your heavenly Father is Perfect;
and the Apostle said, Be ye Perfect, In his saying so, he does not say, that
they should be Christ themselves, and sit down in the Throne of God or the
Godhead, and thrust out the Eternal God.

Ah! poor Mortal, in the Imaginary Fancy! (as I may well say) can the Eternael
God be thrust out of his Throne? Is not this Blasphemy to say, that the Eternal
God can be thrust out of his Throne? If this be R. W.'s and the
New-England-Priests Doctrine, that the Eternal God can be thrust out of his
Throne, if ye hold such Principles of God, the Eternal, Living God, R. VV.'s
Blasphemy.
before whom all Nations are but like a Drop of a Bucket (and if they are but a
Drop, and yet if he can be Thrust out of his Throne by so few people, this is
gross Ignorance and Blindness to mention any such thing. And thou say --

R. W. There is a Generation, that are pure in their own Eyes, yet are not
cleansed from their Filthiness.

Answ. Roger, this is thy own Condition: And what! Do thou bring this to
oppose Christ, who says, Be ye Perfect, as your heavenly Father is Perfect?
And the Apostle says, We speak Wisdom among them that are Perfect, 1 Cor: 2,
6: And Paul does not contradict himself in Phil. 3.

R. W. And thou say: G. F. and we do not know the Battle, etc; between the
Old Man and the New; for Satan having possession, all is in peace.

Answ. This R. W. might have applied to himself, who knows not our Condition,
which we have gone through, nor the New Man, that is born after God: for how
can he, when he believes not in the Light, by which he may become a Child of
Light, but speaks evil of it? And therefore he is not like to know the battle
betwixt the New and the Old. And --

R. W. Thou say: It has been ever known, that all God's Children are like
High and Glorious Queens and Empresses, who wittingly endure not (as the holy
Scripture speaks) that such an Ugly Fiend as the Devil should touch them, no,
not in an Evil Thought.

Answ. R. W. why do thou deny here the people of God called Quakers, who
witness Sanctification and Redemption by Christ Jesus, and Freedom from Sin
here? But Roger, How can those high, glorious Queens and Empresses, which thou
call God's people, who cannot endure the Evil Fiend, the Devil, to touch
them, no, not with an Evil Thought (how can thou say then, they) have a
Combat or a Battle all their Life Time, and Cry out like Paul, Who shall
deliver me? And make good the great Mystery ( Append. p: 6.) How the Seeds of
all Sin are in the Newborn, and the Seeds of all Grace. And G. F. and We have
Esteem and Love to all that profess Holiness and Sincerity, who are begotten of
the holy Spirit.

R. VV. brings ( G. F. Fol. p. 28.) Rich: Baxter's Saying, where G. F.
tells [ How the same Author preaches an External Word.] G. F. Answ: [Which
the Scripture speaks nothing of, nor the Prophets, nor Christ; but says, The
Word that lives, and abides and endures for Ever: and of the Scriptures of
Truth, that cannot be broken; and of God's Words and Christ's Words, and that
is not External. This is not agreeable to Sound Words, that cannot be
Condemned; but that is like his Doctrine, that knows not the Eternal. But the
Ministers of Christ did not tell people of an External Word, but of an ETERNAL
WORD: but ye being made by the Will of Man, speak to the people of an External
Word.] NOW whereas R. VV. in Answer to this says, That the Word ( whether
External, Internal or Eternal) is a Simitude, because God has no Mouth, nor
Tongue nor Words, --

Answ. He shows his Ignorance of God and Divine things: for God in his Words
is more truly Real, then those things of Man, that are obvious to the outward
Changes; and therefore are rather to be called a Similitude of God's words,
then God's a Similitude of Man's words. The like Ignorance he shows in his
Comparing of Kings and Generals of Armies; p. 199.
which Comparison is Lame: For God as an Omnipresent Being, can and does
signify his Mind unto all his Children Inwardly by his Spirit, which the other
cannot do; and therefore must of necessity make use of outward Words and
Writings. The like gross Ignorance he shows, in stretching this Comparison to
a Sentinel's making the General stand, if he forget his Word; Which cannot be
applied to God without great Blasphemy. Neither do we deny, but that the Mind
of God is outwardly expressed in Words in many things in the holy Scriptures;
and therefore, as R. VV. says, That Christ, and Paul and Apollo sp^ke and
Disputed from the Scriptures (neither do we deny, but the same may be done, as
we our selves often do) which yet will signify nothing without the Leadings and
Guidings of that Spirit, from whence the Scriptures come. By which Spirit we
are fully satisfied, they were guided in their Testimonies and Disputing from
the Scriptures; and so are the Faithful in this Day.

R. VV. brings ( G. F. Fol. p. 32.) Ellis Bradshaw saying [ The Quakers
Spirit does teach them to honor no Man.] G. F. Answ. [That is a Lie: for it
Teaches them to have all Men in Esteem, and to Honor all Men in the Lord. Yet
they are convinced by the Law to be Transgressors, if they Respect Men's
Persons: And the Saints are not to hold the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with
Respect of Persons, as ye do.] This last Sentence, which was the Reason of G.
F.'s Assertion, he has deceitfully kept out; and yet now has little to say,
but his Saying, That is a Lie.

Answ. Which being Really a Lie (in Ellis Bradshaw) it is neither contrary to
Christianity nor Civility to say, it is so. But Reader, mind but, how often R.
VV. uses the Word Lie? And yet he finds Fault with G. F.

It is also false, that ever the Quakers were against Taking by the Hand, or
true Courtesy; though to Bow, and Uncover the Head (whether half or whole) they
are against, page 200.
and look upon as in Apostasy, if done by any of them: Neither can R. VV.
prove, that so to do is true Civility. -- It is false in him to insinuate, that
to assert, That in Christ there is neither Bond nor Free; as if used by us to
destroy the Mutual Relation of Master and Man, Father and Child: Which is
false, and might the same way be alleged upon the Apostle. --

Such Respective Words and Titles, as the Scripture owneth and commands
(especially under the New Covenant) we deny not; if R. VV. thinks we do, let
him prove it. And as for his Charges of our Uncivil and Inhumane Behavior, he
only affirms it, saying, God knows it: but gives no manner of Proof for
his Calumny,

And if the English Bibles and Grammar (as R. VV. confesses) make use of Thou
to a single Person; why should R. W. quarrel with the Quakers for following the
English Bibles and Grammar? -- With the like Confidence and without Proof he
does affirm, That the Hebrew and Greek signifies no more You then Thou: For
all those, that understand those Languages, know, that they distinguish the
Singular and the Plural, as well as the English. And albeit Every Nation, etc:
have their particular Proprieties of Speech; yet that does not destroy the Real
Distinction of Singular and Plural, universally acknowledged in all Languages.
And therefore to accuse those as Ridiculous, that use this Distinction is in R.
VV. but a manifesting of his own Folly; as likewise a sufficient Evidence of
his M^lice and Wickedness to declare, It Is no Persecution, to punish Men, who
for Conscience sake cannot comply with his mind or Corrupt Custom in these
matters.

R. VV. undertaketh to prove, That the Spirit of the Quakers tends (1) to
reduce people from Civility to Barbarism.

(Answ.) And albeit he braggs here, page 201.
that W. E. and the rest in the D^spute stood upon Coals, and overdrive him,
for fear he should prove it; yet now he has Leisure enough, to write what he
pleases without Interruption: He produces no solid Reason for it. The words
of Paul (Ephesians. 4.) and Peter (1 Pet. 3.) Be Pitiful, be Courteous, we own;
neither does he prove, that we are otherwise. But did the New-England-Priests
and Professors obey this Command, when they HANGED, etc. the Innocent? Were
they led by the Spirit of Christ Jesus, which R. VV. says, leads to
Courteousness, Gentleness and Sociableness to the greatest Opposites? Did they
not in so doing behave themselves more like the dogged, proud, sullen
Pharisees, R. W. speaks of (and also like himself in his Book) then the
Disciples of Jesus? With the like foolish Confidence he affirms, --

(R. W.) That the Quakers Spirit leads to bring into that Barbarity, which the
English were wearing out among the Indians; and that, page 202.
because they past by people sometimes without speaking to them, saying, They
are like the Popish Saints in a Procession.

(Answ.) But is Silence become such a Crime amongst the Christians, who know,
that they shall be brought to an Account for every Idle Word? If this were all,
for which the Indians are to be blamed, it were no hard matter, to prove them
therein to be more Innocent, then many of those Idle Talkers, that go under the
Name of Christians. And it remains yet for R. W. to prove, That Silence in such
Cases, or a Refusing to comply with Men in the Common Sort of Salutations,
proceeds from a Brutish Spirit: which for R. W. to affirm, and not to prove, is
pitifully to Beg the Question.

AS for his Story of the Quakers Nakedness, the Account he himself gives of W.
Edmondson and J. Stubs, their Answer for it shows, there is nothing of
Barbarity or Immodesty in the Case. And for as much as --

R. W. says, That such a thing cannot now be admitted as a Sign, because Signs
and Figures are ceased under the Gospel.

Answ. The Objection is no ways valued: For that will not hold forth, as if we
were under a shadow of Dispensation, typifying some other Dispensation to come;
but only a particular Sign by a particular Matt^r of Fact by way of Prophecy:
As the Case of Agabus (Act: 21, 11.) taking Paul's girdle, and binding himself*
as a Sign of his Bonds to come. Which Instance R. W. confesses J. Stubs gave,
does sufficiently witness.

The Second Branch of --

R. W.'s Fourteenth Position or Charge is this: The Spirit of the Quakers tends
to bring in an Arbitrary Government. His Proof consists in these Three things,
p. 203.
1. That God wrote Laws for Israel some by his own Inconceivable Finger, and
some by Moses his Inspired Penman: for that it pleased him, not to leave their
Wisest Kings and Governors without Written, Known Laws, with Rewards and
Penalties anexed.

Answ. What then Roger? Did not God promise, That in the last days he would
pour out of his Spirit upon all Flesh? and That all should know him from the
Least to the Greatest? Is thy Eye Evil, because God's Eye is Good? Is God's
Promise become Erroneous and the Complete Liberty and Freedom of the
Gospel Spirit Offensive and Dangerous to thee? Or will thou compare the State
of the Law with that of the Gospel? Is not a greater than Moses, come? Is not
he the great Penman of the Gospel? Does not he write his Heavenly Law in the
Hearts of them that, believe in him?

R. W. But thou say: The Finger of God, that wrote these Laws, is
Inconceivable. [How then can thou understand it or them?] But thou further
arguest; If the Quakers are guided in all they say and do, by the Immediate
Spirit of God ( as I proved, Fox maintained) then if they obtain Higher or
Lower Governors of their Spirits, surely it shines clear, that there is no
need of Laws for them to Rule and Act by; they have the Holy Scriptures within
them, their Teacher within them, and all that they speak, the Voice within
them, etc. So, I said, much more might be said of Men's Laws and Writings, that
surely they had no need of them.

Answ. When and where did G. F. say, That every thing, that was done by a
Quaker, was done by the Immediate Motion of the Spirit of God? and when and
where did he maintain it? For there are many outward, indifferent Matters,
which true Christians called Quakers, have a true Understanding and Liberty
from God to do; and not to place those things upon the Immediate Motion of
God's Spirit within them, which yet is not against the Mind of God: (See what
Paul says 1 Cor. 7, 6, 12.) --

But a vain and foolish Argument have thou brought, indeed no Argument; but
rather a Repetition of thy Charge. Howbeit this I say; Christ never leads his
people to disobey Just Laws, but to fulfill them (and Unjust Laws are to be
obeyed at no times; yet all true Christians do patiently suffer, when for good
Conscience to God they are oppressed by them, according to the Conmand and
Example of Christ) And how does this destroy Righteous Government and Laws,
that fulfilleth all Righteousness? Law is added because of Transgression; where
Transgression is removed, the Law has no power: And is this thy Evil and
Arbitrary Government, thou chargest upon the Quakers, when To take away Sin,
and finish Transgression, is the very End of Christ's Coming? Roger, what is
become of thy Wits? Is Not to need the Law, to Rebel against and break the Law?
and to Obey Christ the great Lawgiver, the way to Destroy Free Government, and
to set up an Arbitrary and Oppressive Government? The Law is a Schoolmaster,
and it leads to Christ; and all Just Government is owned in it is place. But
are those, that are come to Christ (and to God the Judge of all, and the
Spirits of the Just men made perfect, and to the General Assembly of the
Firstborn) against Free and Righteous Government, which is the End of all Just
Government, and the Perfection of all Just Government? Nay, they do and leave
undone the things commanded or forbidden in all Righteous Laws by the Divine
Nature, which they are Partakers of.

And Roger, we must tell thee, that all those, that obey the Spirit of God, and
keep to Christ, their Lawgiver and Teacher, are in that Love, that fulfills
the Law; because they are in that Image, which was before Transgression was,
for which the Law was added. And art not thou a Wicked Man (yea, and God will
recompense it upon thy Head, if thou repentest not) to make our Fulfilling all
Just Laws a Subverting of Just Laws, and a Destroying of Just Government! as if
we were for a Boundless, Lawless, Wicked Life, and not, that we were Come to
him, by whom Princes Reign, and Kings decree Justice.

(R. W.) But upon W. E.'s Saying [What do thou R. W. fill peoples Ears with
strange Notions, as if the People of God called Quakers, were a Lawless people?
We are for Righteous Government and Righteous Laws; we are not for any to rule
by Force. p. 204.
] Thou reply, That W. E. mistook Thee; thou did not intend a Government
by Force, but by Will or Pleasure, as Arbitrium signified.

(Answ.) To which we say: That where there is no Force, there is no Fear of
Slavery; and such an Arbitrary Government no body was ever afraid of. But it
was an Arbitrary Government with Force, Roger, that used WHIPS, and an HOT
IRON, and HALTERS and GALLOVSES in New England. O thou Wicked Man, look at
home, and do not thou bespatter the Innocent, who have Joined with Persecutors,
and taken part with the Blood-thirsty Generation! The Lord give thee
Repentance, if it be not hid from thine Eyes for Ever! -- But Roger, do thou
not accuse the people called Quakers, for holding, That they are Acted by the
Spirit of God, and not by their own Spirit? If so, it is the Arbitrium, or Will
and Pleasure of their God, and not by their own Wills and Spirits, that they
are Acted by: And what Harm is this to Just Government? or how does this set up
Man's Will and Power? O thy Blindness! thy Darkness! and thy Confusion!

(R. W.) Now to the Third Branch of thy Fourteenth Position, viz: That the
Quakers Spirit tends to the sudden Cutting-off of people, yea Kings and
Princes, that oppose them.

(Answ.) But what Proof have thou for this? Answer us. Thou tellest us* Thou
cravest our patience, that thou must profess thy Fears -- And what have we to
do with thy Fears? What Proof is this, that we are Guilty? If we should say, R.
W. is a Thief or a Drunkard: And when we are called to prove it, we tell him,
We fear, he is a Thief or a Drunkard; We ought rather to fear, he would Take
the Law of us for a Scandal against him. But --

(R. W.) Thou clearest us presently after in these words, viz: I told them, I
thought, they had no such thing in their Thoughts or Eye at present; but if
Power of the Sword come into their hand, it was easy to imagine, that whom
their Spirit (infallible) decreed to Death, Peasant or Prince, if it were
possible, he must be Executed.

(Answ.) Now all people behold, where is the Charity, the Justice, the Reason
of this Man! He Charge our Spirit with Death of Prince and Peasant, Which
takes in all Mankind from the Throne to the Dunghill: when he comes to prove
it, He Fears so, and, It is easy to Imagine so: But it is beyond a Fear or
Imagination either, that R. W. would (if he could) expose us to the Club of the
Peasant, and to the Sword of the Prince, and render us unfit to live in the
World; as has been already hinted. But Roger, do the Magistrates, called
Quakers, where thou live, give thee any Proof for this Charge? or any Ground
for this Ugly Fear and Bloody Imagination? No such matter: However, thou have
no Ground for So Fearing and So Imagining in these words, viz: --

(R. W.) For why might they not say, that Abraham with an Impulse was killing
Isaac, Moses the Egyptian, Ehud Eglon, Samuel Agag, p. 205.
and Paul Ananias and Sapphira? etc. Also the wonderful Actings of Tho.
Munster, J. Becold, Pseiffer and Knipperdolling in Germany.

(Answ.) When did ever any of the people called Quakers, do any of these
things, or follow any of these Examples? which thou might have better
applied to thy own Spirit and the New England Professors. Must thy Fear and thy
Imaginations serve thy Turn? Is it a good Argument, Because Evil Men have
pretended God for Evil Actions, therefore All that act in the Name of the Lord,
must needs be Guilty of the same Designs, and their Spirit tend to the same
Evil Consequences? THEY that have not the Spirit of Christ* are none of his;
This is according to Scripture: Now, how know thou, that we have not the
Spirit of Christ? Thou can not tell by the Visible Fruits (for thou say; I
Charge the Quakers with no Matter of Fact: Nay, thou further say, Thou
did, not Think, We had any such thing in our Thoughts or Eye at present?)
The Spirit of God never Revealed it to thee, for thou deniest Revelation: The
Scripture tell's thee no such thing; and thou confessest, that no such Fact or
Fruits appear? What wicked Presumption is this to Judge an Innocent people with
thy envious Imaginations of thy own Heart?

But Roger, how come thou to jumble Abraham and Munster, Moses and
Knipperdolling together? Did they proceed upon the same Authority? Have not
thou served Abraham and Moses, as thou do Us (in Joining Abraham with the
Wicked) with thy false Cain's Fears, who thus enviest thy Brother, and have
proved thy self a Man-s^ayer (1 John 3.) Is this good Equal Measuring, Weighing
and Joining? Abraham in that Case gave one of the greatest Instances, and of
Self-Denial and Obedience to God; was that Munster's and Knipperdolling's Case?
Again, Art not thou an Unreasonable Man, that under the pretense of Confuting
Men's Principles, make Principles, that thou may Confute them, which are
not theirs? Do thou not know, that it is one of our Principles, That he, that
kills with the Sword, shall perish by the Sword? That Men ought to Love their
Enemies? Yea, that it is a standing and Foundation-Principle of the Gospel, to
SVFFER, and not to Revenge? And that it is not the Way of the Spirit of God in
these Gospel-Days, to Exercise the Children of God in such things, as either
were connived at, or suffered or commanded, before Christ Came, the Heir and
Lord of all things, that brought Life and Immortality to Light: Who is greater
than Abraham, or Moses or Samuel, yea, all the Prophets and all the Apostles
too.

But Roger, we never read yet, That Paul killed Ananias and Sapphira, nor yet,
that they died by a Visible Force; but by that Power and Spirit, which Early or
Late will over-take thee for all thy Ungodly Speeches and Calumnies, if thou
repentest not.

But Roger, thou have writ thy own State, and the State of the
New-England-Priests: And it is a Wonder, ye do not Kill one another, as ye have
done the People of God called Quakers; for Thou and They, that own the
Scripture to be your only Rule, and ^eny the Eternal Spirit to be necessary
(which alone gives to savor Spirits) ye may in your Imaginations to Imitate*
Abraham, offer up your Children, and think, Ye Act Moses upon the Egyptian,
when ye kill those, that are not of you. And no question, but ye made the poor
Quakers the Egyptians, and the Agags, when you WHIPPED them, and BVRN'D them and
HANGED them, to Justify your selves in your Wickedness: But the Lord has
Discovered you, and he will Reward you!

As for thy Charge against James Parne^ (which thou bring'st over and over)
viz: That he was moved to fast 40 Days, and perished the 11 Day: It is utterly
false, there was no such thing. But after some of thy Generation about
Colchester (for all their Cries and Pretenses for Liberty of Conscience, and
after all the Blood, that had been Spilt in the Nations about it) had beaten
him, and bruised him, and shed his Innocent Blood, and cruelly entreated him
(as has been already said) he like a Lamb laid down his Innocent Life. O! this
Harlot's Spirit, that would kill the Living Child, to be Revenged on the true
Mother! which would lay it is own Abominations to the Charge of God's Elect, and
suggest that against the Innocent People of God, which daily leads those into,
that Partake with it, and are Joined to it.

For thy Story of Henry the Fourth of France, that was stabbed by a Friar
pretending a Vision of Angels, What is that to us? who deny Friars, false
Visions and all Stabbings to Death whatever; yea, and maintain, that God's
Spirit leads no man to any such Work: But Roger, Let thou, and the
New-England-Priests and all your Brethren elsewhere look at home. page 206.
For thy Story and Anger against William Harris (who is thy Neighbor) he is of
Age, and able enough to Answer for himself.

(R. W.) The Last Point and Branch of thy 14. Position is this, viz: Their
Persecuting Spirit. -- The Proof thou bring for this Accusation, p. 107.
is a passage out of G. F.'s Book (p: 170: Fol:) viz. That the Magistrate ought
to subject the Nation to his Light, else he is not a Faithful Magistrate.

(Answ.) But Roger, Though thou have given his words very Imperfectly, this
proves nothing of thy Charge. And to the end the Reader may see, that thou have
here-in used thy Fears and Imaginations (as before) and not in a Real Proof,
here are all G. F.'s words in that page upon that Subject following:

The Magistrate of Christ, the Help-Government for him, he is in the Light and
Power of Christ; and he is to subject all under the power of Christ, into his
Light, else he is not a faithful Magistrate: And his Laws here are Agreeable,
and Answerable according to that of God in every Man; when men act contrary to
it, they do Evil. So he is a Terror to the Evildoers, discerns the Precious
and the Just from the Vile: And this is a Praise to them that do Well.

Now is there one word of Persecution here? Or can R. W. think himself a
Christian, and look upon it to be Persecution for Christ's Magistrate by
Christ's Light and Power to subject all under the Power of Christ, and to bring
all into this Light of Christ, Or can he think such an one an Unfaithful
Magistrate? Or are those Laws and the Execution of them Persecution, that are
Agreeable and Answerable to that of God in every Man? These are G. F.'s words:
Such Magistrates, such Laws, such Power, and Light and Subjection is G. F. for,
and no other. And O Roger! Can thou expect to escape the Judgment of the
great God, when the very words of G. F. relate not to Opinion, Religion, and
Faith and Conscientious Worship (which Persecutors employ their Power to Impose
or Restrain) but to Well or Evil-Doing, Common Justice, Righteousness, Truth,
Industry, and those Virtues, that are so necessary and commendable between Man
and Man. Wherefore (says G. F.) The Magistrate is a Terror to Evildoers, and
a Praise to them that do well: who discern the Just from the Vile. And thus do
G. F.'s own words at length prove the Innocence and Soundness of his mind in
writing them; And the Malice and Envy of R. Williams in mis-representing and
mis-construing them.

But Roger: How does Terrifying Evildoers destroy Government? When we speak of
Punishing Evildoers, then thou turnest it to Persecuting Conscientious
Dissenters: And when we speak of being made Free by the Light and Spirit of God
from the Impositions and Traditions of Men, thou construest it presently, that
we are against Law and Government, and set up an Arbitrary Government of our
own: And thus To the Unholy all is Unholy. One while we are accused of being
against Magistracy, another while for being for Magistracy: But the Lord has
delivered us out of thy Hands, and in some measure out of the Hands of thy
Generation; and will do more and more for his own Seed's sake.

( R. W.) The 2. Proof thou give, that we are of a Persecuting Spirit, is
this; Was there ever any known (professing the Fear of God in so high a
Measure) so sharp and Cutting in their Tongues even to Eminently Knowing and
Conscientious Persons, p. 208.
Thou Liar, Serpent, Cain, Judas, Hypocrite, Devil?

( Answ.) The Tongues of God's People have in all Ages been as a Fire and a
Sword to the Wicked; and if thy Eminent Persons were as well Known, as thou
say they are Knowing, we knew what to say to thee. For since thou have
thought best to conceal them, we shall only say, that Liar, Serpent, Cain,
Judas, Hypocrite, Devil are Names given to the Evil One and his Children by the
Spirit and People of God; Yea, they are the Form of sound Words, which thou and
thy Generation wince and spurn at: And therefore many of our Dear Friends, Men
and Women have been bitterly Bruised and Beaten by and at the Instigation of
such Professing Priests, as thou art, when they have been so called. And we do
believe, the Word of the Lord has Cut you, which makes thee to cry out, They
are CVTTING Words: But the Spirit of the Lrod will Cut you more, and will
Answer the Witness of God in you, and make you to Confess, GOD is JUST. And R.
W. and his New-England^Priests need not to fear Carnal Weapons, to be hurt by
from us. Well, but thou proceedest in these bitter words and say^st: --

(R. W.) Shall we rationally question, whether their Hands ( like Simeon's and
Levi's) will not be as Fierce and Cruel, if the Most-Holy and Only Wise permit
Whips and Halters, Swords and Faggots so fall into their Hands?

( Answ.) It may be as Rationally questioned of the People of God in this Age,
as of God's people in former Ages: And God will reckon with thee, thou Ungodly,
Unjust Man, that insinuatest these wicked things against a Suffering as well as
Harmless People! This Spirit, thou art led by in Writing against us, would BVRN
us, as it led thy Forefathers to Burn the Martyrs in Smith-field: For ye are
all of CAIN'S Race, and ye are found in his Steps, and shall have Cain's
Reward, if You repent not.

Nevertheless thou Instancest Sam. Fisher and Edw. Borough, to prove this most
Uncharitable Saying of thine. But this thou might have applied to the
New-England-Professors, who have been in the Practice of it; their Fruits have
discovered them to the World: and so it is like, they are afraid, the same
Measure to be measured withal, as they have measured to us; but Vengeance we
leave to God for him to repay it. -- And is this a Proof, that we would Whip
and Hang, and Burn and Destroy people for their Religion? Did S. F. and E. B.
mention Whips, Halters, Swords and Faggots? Were the Soldiers to overcome the
Pope and his Followers with such Tools and Instruments, as they are? Or was it
not rather to destroy those destroying Courses? But Roger, if this be the Sign
of a False Religion, what have thou to say for thy New England Brethren, into
whose Hands the Only-Wise God has permitted Whips* Halters and Swords to fall?
What Use have they made of them? Is not this to measure us by your selves?
Because ye have been False to God, your own Consciences, and your own
Principles, therefore we must be so too? Witness thy following words, which are
the last Proof alleged by thee, to manifest our Persecuting Spirit; they are
these:

(R. W.) Have we not known the Deceitfulness of Men's Hearts fly out into
greater Matters than Persecution? Hasael earnestly asked, whether the Prophet
thought him a Dog, that he should do such matters? etc.

( Answ.) What is this to the Business Roger? Are we Hasaels? or art thou the
Prophet? or have thou a true Prophetical Spirit, that thou can tell us, We
shall be, what thou thy self (page 204.) twice confessest, we are not? But thou
have another Instance to prove us Persecutors, saying:

( R. W.) Pendleton vowed, his Collops should fry, ere he would to Mass, in Q.
Mary's Days; and yet to Mass he went, and Persecuted others also, that would
not bow to the Image, as he had done.

( Answ) What Proof is this, that we must Change our Principles, and turn
Persecutors? Either this Instance concerns us not at all, or else it must be
applied thus: Persecution is no more our principle now, then it was Pendeton's,
when he was a Protestant; and as he turned not Persecutor, till he turned to
Mass, so we shall not turn Persecutors, till we turn to thee and the
New-England-Professors: For the plain Meaning of this Instance of thine is,
That though we have good Principles, and resolve to stand by them; yet we may
turn from them, and Persecute our own Friends, who keep to them: which thou
say, was Pendleton's Case.

But Roger, is not this thine and the New-England-Priests Case? And is not this
Measuring us by your selves (as before mentioned) with your false Rule, your
false Yard, and that R. W. though he is not a Thief, yet he may be a Thief?
Which he may be, before the Quakers turn to their Principles and Practice: For
we see them plain enough; and had they any Good in them, we should never have
forsaken them. For did not ye ( Pendleton like) renounce and deny the Hierarchy
of the Church of England, and severely plead against the Persecution raised by
the Bishops against you in former Times? And did not ye Vow, If God gave power
into your hands, ye would not do, as ye have been dealt by? And have not ye
done the same things, and far Worse? Bitterly WHIPPED, BEATEN, BURNED with an HOT
IRON, BANISHED and HANGED a poor and Conscientious people, (which are the
Christians in Nature, and the Followers of the true Lord JESUS Christ) because
they would not bow to your Image in New England, after ye had fled from the
Bishop's Image in Old-England? Like to the Scribes and Pharisees, that praised
the Prophets, and blamed the Forefathers, and committed greater Wickedness
themselves, by putting to Death the LORD of LIFE and GLORY?

O Roger Williams! That thou might yet know the things that belong to thy
Eternal Peace! That thou might yet find a place of Repentance for thy poor
Soul, and feel the Mercies of the Lord in thy Eternal Salvation! O that thou
had been Wise, and had not done these things! Verily, thou art Treasuring
up Wrath against the Day of Wrath! And if thou come not down into the Dust,
and mournest for these things, thy Day will always be Darkness, and thy End
EVERLASTING DESTRUCTION.

In the Year M DC LXXVIII.

A NEW ENGLAND* Firebrand Quenched: Or, an Answer to Roger Williams APPENDIX.
Wherein he has taken and picked up some of G F's. words, and some of G. F's
old Persecutors here and there, that Writ against him, and the People of God
called Quakers, what he thinks he can pick out for his own Advantage, who is of
the same Spirit, as they that Writ against us, and Persecuted us in Oliver's
days.
R. W. IN the 2d. page of the Appendix thou say, that G F. writes, that the
Saints know all things as God, etc.

And then thou tells, p. 2.
what the Devil pretends he does, and offers to reveal so much to some
Conjurers: And then thou say, What hinders, but if the Quakers be
Omniscient, and know all things, but they should be also Omnipotent and do all
things? for Paul so writes, Phil. 4. etc. And R. W. says, I know, they say,
they are one with God and Christ, and they know all things, and can do all
things; and yet this sense which literally is so proud and Blasphemous etc.

Answ. Roger, Why do thou abuse the Quakers? For where does G F, or any of
the Quakers write and say, They know all things as God? or, that they are
Omniscient, or Omnipotent? And why do thou find fault with G F, who brings
the Apostles words to the Saints; But ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and
ye know all things, etc. and, Let that therefore abide in you, which you have
heard from the beginning: and, If that, which ye have heard from the Beginning,
shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. And,
These things have I written unto you, concerning them that seduce you; but the
Anointing which you have received of him, abides in you, and ye need not that
any man teach you: but as the same Anointing teaches you of all things, and is
Truth, and is no Lie; and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him,
etc. Here John explains his own words better than R. W. can do; and such as
continue in the Son of God, they continue in the Father, and know the
Antichrists and the Seducers, to shun them, 1 John 2. -- And do thou not
wickedly bring, That the Devil pretends, that he knows all things, and offers
to reveal so much to his Conjurers? and do not thou bring this in Opposition
to John's words, who exhorted the Saints to the Anointing within them, which
will teach them to know all things? and had thou been in John's days, thou
would have said as much in Opposition to him, as thou have done to G. F. who
brings but John's words. And John says, That which we have seen and heard,
declare we unto you, that ye also might have fellowship with us; and truly, our
fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ: and must not this
Fellowship be witnessed by the true Believers in Christ Jesus? But it is like,
thou art more acquainted with the Devils pretenses, and what he reveals to his
Conjurers, then with that, which the Apostle John did declare, which he had
seen and heard: and therefore I believe, if R W. declared nothing, but what he
has seen and heard from the beginning, as John did, he would have little to
say, 1 John 1. And as for Paul's saying, I can do all things, as R. W. brings;
but R. W. has left out Christ: for the Apostle says, I can do all things
through Christ, who has strengthened me; and so can all that walk in his
Spirit: for without Christ they cannot do any thing that is good. And Christ
says, I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches; and he that abides in me, and I
in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing,
John 15, 5. And thou say (to take the Apostles words) he can do all things,
etc. and the Saints know all things (according to John's doctrine) and say,
Yet this sense, which literally is so Proud and Blasphemous, etc. Here thou
have judged the Apostles to be Proud and Blasphemous, which directed the Saints
to the Unction within from the Holy One, which taught them all things. And the
Apostle could do all things through Christ that strengthened him.

R. W. And thou say, Does not the Spirit of God ( Prove. 28.) open this to
us, saying, Evil men understand not Judgment, but they that seek the Lord,
understand all things, (ver. 5.) that is, God Answers their Prayers, and
enables them to do all, that he calls them to, when the proud and scornful are
rejected.

Answ. It Is well thou will confess so much, though thou have added to Salomon's
words: But I question much, whether ever thou heard God, or Christ's Voice
immediate from Heaven by his Spirit? For Salomon's words are true, as he
speaks, and gives a better sense, then thou can.

R. W. Thou say, Therefore (I believe) it is, that the most Holy, most Just,
and Wise Lord leaves these poor, proud, scornful souls to seek Wisdom, and not
to find it; to be ignorant, knowing nothing, as God's Spirit speaks; and to
discover their ignorance in so many fundamentals of Christianity, and in so
many practices immodest, irrational, more then Savage, as I have proved against
them.

Answ. No such proof have thou proved. And here thou fall'st a railing in thy
false judgment: but as Christ says, With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be
judged. Thou think, thou art plucking a Mote out of our eyes, but sees not
the Beam in thy own: and truly Roger, thou have hit thy own Condition, and mist
us. As for proud, scornful and savage, etc. and immodest practices, these are
but thy railing Expressions, a wave of the Sea, which thou had better have kept
at home, and applied to thy own Spirit; for we can praise God through Jesus
Christ, for what he has revealed unto us: And I strange, that thou dare take
the most-Holy Just Lord in thy mouth, and utter such foul Languages against his
People. And who those many are, that practice Immodesty, which thou tell the
World of, thou have neither mentioned their Names, nor their Immodest
practices; therefore it is a slander. And wherein are we Ignorant of the
fundamentals of Christianity, seeing we believe all that is written in the
Scriptures concerning God and Christ?

R. W. And thou say, The Quakers confessed their Light to be Conscience, and
J. Bunion denies plainly, that Conscience can justify. And R. W. replies and
says, That Conscience looks back of a man's mind or spirit upon it self in
point of justification or pardon of sin; and Conscience looks upon a cursed
rotten nature: And J. Bunion calls the Light Conscience, A poor
Dunghill-Creature, that will convince of sin (as in G.F's Folio, page 10.) [Oh
how does R. W. and J. Bunion contradict each other! the one says, It will not
justify; the other says, In point of Justification or pardon of sin.] And thou
says, that Adam and Eve's Conscience^ condemned them, p. 3.
and they confessed the Fact: and thou say, That poor Conscience, which every
man, Jew or Gentile, Civilized or Pagan comes into the world with, etc. and the
first man and woman their Consciences condemned them, etc. and thou further
say, Could this their Condemning Conscience (especially with mincing of sin,
as all natural men's Consciences do) I say, could t^is Conscience or Confession
pardon their Sin, renew their Hearts, and be their Justification (or clearing)
and Salvation?

Answ. Have not thou Answered thy self in the Second page? Do not thou say,
that Conscience in point of justification looks upon a man's mind and spirit,
etc. in point of Justification or pardon of sin, and yet thou call'st it a
Natural Conscience, and Adam, and Eve, and every man has it? and thou say,
that Abimelecks Conscience justified him from the Fact of Abraham 's Wife; and
Joseph's Conscience justified him etc? And thou wrong'st the Quakers in saying,
that they confess their Light to be Conscience: In this thou perverts their
words, and thou would have it so; for G. F's words are, The Light, which you
call Conscience, which is the Light of Christ, as you may see all along in his
Book. And thou calls Conscience Natural; and J. B. calls the Light (wherewith
Christ enlightens every man that comes into the world) Conscience, and a poor
Dunghill-Creature; which never does G. F. nor the Quakers call it Conscience,
nor Natural, but as you call it. And where did ever any of the Apostles call
the Conscience ^ poor Dunghill-Creature, or that was Natural, that Condemned
Adam and Eve? and is the Light, which Christ said Believe in, and that the
Apostle turned people to from darkness, a poor Dunghill-Creature, and a Natural
Conscience? is not this your ignorance of Christ's and the Apostles Doctrine?
And if Conscience stands in point of Justification or pardon of sin, have not
thou here set it up in the room of Christ and his Blood? for we say, it is
Christ, that justifies and pardons sin, and his Blood, that sprinkles the
Consciences from the dead works to serve the Living God. And G. F's. words will
stand, which the Apostle brings, Romans 2. and that which will accuse them, or
excuse them in the day, when God shall judge the secrets of all men by Jesus
Christ according to my Gospel, that was that, which may be known of God, which
was manifest in them, which God had showed unto them. So, this was not a
Natural Dunghill-Conscience, but it was something of the Spirit of God in them,
that brought them to do the Law of God: For the Apostle says, He is not a Jew,
that is one outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward: and sets up
Circumcision in the Spirit, and the Heart above that in the Letter ( Romans 1,
19. cap. 2. throughout) And the Apostle says, In the Beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the Beginning
with God, all things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made
that was made: And in Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men; and the
Light shined in Darkness, and Darkness comprehended it not. And John said, He
was not that Light, but he came for a Witness to bear Witness of that Light;
and that was the true Light, which lights every Man, that comes into the
World: and the Word became flesh, and dwelt amongst us, etc. Now, you bear
witness against this Light, and some of you calls it a Natural Conscience, and
some calls it a Dunghill-Creature, and some a Created Light; and R. W. calls
it an Idol, and a mad frantic Light. And John the Divine says, In him was
Life (to wit, the Word, by which all things were made and Created) and this
Life is the Light of Men; and he bore witness to it, that all Men through him
might believe. And Christ says, Believe in the Light, that you may become
Children of the Light, John 1, 12, 36. and we must tell you, that this Light is
the Condemnation of them that hate it, and whose Consciences are ^eared, and
does evil. And so, the Light of Christ Jesus is a further thing, then
Conscience, for it lets a Man see his Sin, and his Savior Christ Jesus, that
saves him from Sin: and they that believe in the Light, as Christ commands, are
grafted in Christ, and are past from death to life, and have the Witness in
themselves, as 1 John, and Romans 11. And after Adam was condemned for Sin, and
the Jews were condemned by the Law of God for their Transgression, yet Christ
was promised to Adam, that the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents
head, that led them into Sin: which came according to the promise of God, and
the Prophesies of the Prophets; and as the Apostle says, When the fullness of
time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to
Redeem them that were under the Law, etc. And so there is no Salvation by any
other name, but by the Name of Jesus, who suffered for our sins, and rose again
for our justification, Romans 4, 25. Romans 5. And we are justified not by the
works of the Law, but by the Faith of Christ Jesus, which Faith he is the
Author of, Gal. 2. and, we are justified by the Grace which comes by Jesus,
Tit. 3, 7. and, we are justified by the Blood of Christ, Romans 5, 9. And so,
Christ is our Justification, Sanctification, and Redemption, Glory to his Name
for ever.

R. W. says, That after Abimelech 's and Joseph 's Conscience was justified,
etc. and further he says, Was this the pardon of Abimelech 's Sin, his
Justification, after the canting Language of this poor Fox? and all the Foxians
that I have seen, (and I have read all that I could come at) Oh! how little do
these poor Beasts seek, what infinite Justice, infinite Punishment, infinite
Payment is? what Conscience truly pacified is upon true pardon of Sin, and true
peace of Conscience sprinkled with the Blood of that only Lamb of God Christ
Jesus.

Answ. God said unto Abimelech, that he should restore unto Abraham his Wife,
and Abraham should pray for him, and he should live: and he did restore Abraham
his Wife, and Abraham did pray for him, and God did heal Abimelech and his
Family, as in Genesis 20. And thou art made to confess, that his Conscience
justified him from the Fact: and this was before Christ was come in the Flesh,
and Crucified, and shed his Blood for the Sins of the world; which sprinkles
the Consciences and the hearts from dead works to serve the Living God, and
whose Garments are made white with the Blood of the Lamb, etc. And we having an
High Priest over the House of God, Christ Jesus, let us draw near with a true
heart (the Apostle says) having our hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience,
and our bodies washed with pure water, Heb 10, 20, 21, 22. and Elect, according
to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification, through the
Spirit unto Obedience, and sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus Christ. And we are
come to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling,
Glory to his Name for ever: and hearken to him, who speaks from Heaven, who is
our Shepherd. -- But what is G. F's. or the Quakers canting Language, which
thou Scoffingly calls Poor Beasts? thou have not instanced it. But thou have
read our Books with an evil eye, by which thy body is full of darkness, or else
thou might see, how often we mention in our Books, that Christ has bought us
with a price, which is his Blood; and how that all dyed in Adam, and how that
Christ dyed for all, that they that live, might live to Him; and that all might
believe in Him, who dyed for them; and if they do not, they are Condemned with
the Light which they should believe in. For it is Christ, that Lights every
Man that comes into the world, and says, he is the Light of the World, and is
to be followed in his Light; and thou and they that hate it, and give it other
names, with it are Condemned.

R. W. And then thou tell a story of the Indians, how they will confess,
when they are falsely charged of stealing, etc. And then thou say, If this be
all G. F. says, he beats the Air, and has no Enemy: and say, No, no, it is
a Conscience, Justification within, a. Christ shedding his Blood within ( in a
subtle Op^osition to a pardon without, from the King of Heaven, for the sake of
his Son without us) and this is the business, which these Traitors to the King
of Heaven aim at etc. And this their present honesty shall pay the old score of
a cursed Nature, and millions of Treasons and Rebellions in Omissions and
Commissions against the God of Heaven.

Answ. Roger W. What an envious, malicious Spirit appears in thee here, and
what wickedness have thou uttered forth to the world! When did ever any one
hear any of the Quakers, who confess the Blood of Christ sprinkled in their
hearts, and Christ reigning in their hearts by Faith, say this in opposition to
Christ, that dyed at Jerusasalem, and shed his Blood there for sin, who is our
Justification, Sanctification, and Redemption? But this I say to thee, Thou
that art against Christ's being within his Saints, and he sprinkling their
hearts with his Blood, by which they are washed, as the Apostle says; so I say
to thee, Thou art a Reprobate. And so for Traitor, and Treason, and Rebellion,
etc. I say, thou may keep them to thy self, in whom reigns a Rebellious
Spirit. For the Apostle bids the Corinthians Examine themselves, etc. and,
Prove your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be
Reprobates, 2 Cor. 13. now, the Apostle here did not deny Christ dying and
shedding his Blood without the Gates at Jerusalem, no more then the Quakers:
and thou may read thy Condition in Heb. 6. of such as Crucified the Son of
God afresh, and put him to open shame.

And as for the Indians Plea, I believe many of them are more Innocent, than
thou art, and have less to answer for at the day of Judgment. And as for thy
telling of G. F's. beating the Air, thou might very well applied this at home,
in whom the Prince of the Air rules, which has led thee to utter forth so many
Slanders and Lies against God's People, and Christ's true followers. And if all
be justified, that confess Christ dying at Jerusalem, without he be manife^t
within them; and yet the Apostle says, They are Reprobates, if Christ be not
within them; come R. W. how can thou answer the Apostle here? And the Apostle
says, By one Offering Christ has perfected for ever them that are Sanctified:
and so it is Christ, that does perfect and sanctify, who offered up himself
without the Gates of Jerusalem for Sin; who rules in the hearts of his People,
Glory to God for ever. And so, He it is, that has bought us with his price,
his Blood. And as for all thy Lies and Unsavory words, that thou have mentioned
here, indeed they are not worth mentioning: and it would be well, if thou did
see thy self in that Cursed Nature thou speaks of; but thou art so full of
Enmity, which blinds thy eyes, that thou cannot comprehend the Light, though it
may shine in thy darkness.

R. W. p. 4.
And then thou tells us of a Story or Similitude of Q. Elizabeth; and then in
thy Application thou say, The old Friend is Conscience, who will go with us,
but can be a thousand Witnesses against us, etc. It follows then clearly, that
the young Prince is the true Lord Jesus Christ, and not vanished away in a
Light in every dark Dungeon in the world; but Conscience says, he is literally
ascended up into Heaven, and will as literally make his speedy return again to
judgment.

Answ. Here thou have extolled Conscience very highly. But what will a ^ear'd
Conscience do? will a ^ear'd Conscience do this? or the Jews Conscience? or all
Men's Consciences in the World? or a poor Dunghill-Conscience, as J. B. speaks
of? and have not thou set up Conscience here above the Light of Christ, which
lights every Man that comes into the world, which Christ says, is the
Condemnation of them that hate it? -- And is it not Blasphemy in thee to say,
That the Light of Christ may vanish away in every dark Dungeon in the world?
For as the Apostle says, The Light, which shines in their hearts, gives them
the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus:
which Light is Life in Christ the Word, and by it Christ is known, and it comes
from him the true Lord Jesus, who suffered and rose again, and remains in the
Heavens, till all things be restored, as the Apostle says. And as John in his
Revelation (speaking of Christ) says, Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is
with me, to give to every man according to his works. And so it is clear, that
the same Christ is seen by the Light, that suffered and is risen, who will
judge the world in Righteousness: and so take heed Roger, for the Judge stands
at the door, Jam. 5, 9 for he will return to judge thee for all thy hard
speeches. And the Apostle says, He commanded us to Preach to the People (to
wit, Christ) and to testify, that it is he, that was ordained of God to be
Judge of the quick and dead, Act. 10, 42. because he has appointed a day, in
the which he will judge the world in Righteousness by that Man, whom he has
ordained; whereof he has given Assurance unto all men, in that he has raised
him from the dead (to wit, Christ) and we have this Assurance, Act. 17. And
this Light is the condemnation of the world, of them that hate it, and do not
believe in it: and this thou shall know to thy Condemnation, though thou may
Blasphemously call it an Idol, and say, It will vanish away.

R. W. And thou say, that G. F. takes not the Light in the same sense his
Opposite does (to wit, J. B.) ( the common trick of Cheaters;) and further
says, that I. B. (his Opposite) takes it not for the Heavenly Light, Sun,
Moon, etc. nor the Earthly Light, nor Fire, etc. nor precious Stones, etc. nor
a Metaphorical Light in Peoples minds, differing from Beasts, etc. nor the
Light of Peace and Joy etc. called in Scripture Light, etc. nor the Light of
the Holy Scripture and Preaching, p. 5.
and Offering of a Savior to poor lost Sinners; but for that awakening and
saving Light, convincing all Men's Conditions to be Miserable and Damnable; of
Grace and Mercy offered and applied to a Soul by the good News of a Savior
some-way heard of, and the holy Spirit, the Finger or Power of God.

Answ. Here thou seems to help off thy Brother J. B. but thou have made it
worse with thy Confusion. Thou say, He takes it not for the Light of Peace
and Joy etc. called in Scripture; nor the Preaching and Offering of a Savior
to poor lost Sinners etc. and here thou mistakes thy self and J. B. For it was
the true Convincing and Saving or Condemning Light, which lights every Man,
that comes into the world, which John came for a Witness, to bear witness unto
to poor lost Sinners; and the Light which Paul turned People to from darkness,
that our discourse was about. And is not the Awakening and saving Light, the
Light of Peace and Joy, and Prosperity called in Scripture Light? And is there
any Light, but the Light of Christ, that lets people see their miserable
Conditions, and their damnable state? by which Light they see their Savior,
that saves them from their Sin? and by believing in the Light, they are grafted
into Christ, that dyed for their sin? And does not the Scripture say, As the
Law came by Moses, Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ; and is not that within
in the heart?

And thou say, Of Grace and Mercy applied to a soul by the good News of a
Savior some way heard of, and the holy Spirit, and Finger, or power of God.
And what must we understand from thy words here? Thou have heard of the News of
a Savior, and the Finger or Power of God: and this must be applied to a soul.
And will thou come no nearer to Christ, nor his Grace, Mercy, nor the Spirit,
nor the Power of God, but thy Applying? But does not the Apostle say, He that
has not the Son of God, has not Life? and does not he say, If any Man has
not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his? and They that are led by the
Spirit of God, are the Sons of God? And as many as receive Christ, he gives
them power to become the Sons of God? And it was Grace, that established their
hearts, and seasoned their words; and it was the Grace, that was their Teacher,
and brought their Salvation: And may not all the Papists, and others that thou
speaks of, apply to themselves as much as thou do, and yet be Reprobates,
and hear the News of a Savior, etc? For first People may hear the News of a
Savior; but then to receive him, as Christ says, He that receives me,
receives him that sent me. And John says, He that has the Son, has Life;
and he that has him not, has not Life: and then what good does thy Applying
the News of a Savior to thy lying slanderous Spirit? And John says, The Son
of God is come, and has given us an understanding; and we are in him that is
true, even in his Son Jesus Christ: and this is the true God, and Eternal Life;
Glory to his Name for ever.

R. W. And thou say, that G. F. says, That the saving Light is in all
Mankind, only persons do not mind it; and so, Jesus Christ is Crucified and
Slain in them, and God, and Christ, and Spirit, and Light, etc. are all
captivated and hindered from working, yea, altogether Killed and Slain in them,
because the Soul does not mind them, and hearken to Christ in them. And then R.
W. (when he has invented the aforesaid words himself) cries; Ah poor, simple,
brutish Imagination, that ever it should enter into the thoughts of Men
professing to be Christians, or of Men professing to know more, then the Wolves
or Foxes in the Wildernesses!

Answ. Christ Lights every Man, that comes into the world, with the Life in
him, the word, and says, he is the Light of the world; and says, Believe in
the Light, that ye may become Children of Light, and he that believes, is
saved, and he that does not, is Condemned. And the Condemnation is the Light,
that is come into the world; which Light is Saving to them that believe in it,
and Condemning to them that do not believe in it, but hate it; whose deeds be
evil, etc. Joh. 3. But R. W. is a Forger of many Lies: for where ever did he
read in any of the Quakers Books, or in G. F.'s Answer to J. B. that the
Quakers should say, that God, and his Spirit, and his Light, etc. and Christ
(who has all power in Heaven and Earth given to him, and fits at the Right Hand
of God, and dies no more, and death has no more dominion over him) that we say,
That God is Slain and Crucified, and Christ, and his Spirit, and Light is slain
and Crucified, yea, altogether killed and slain in us, etc. and Captivated, and
hindered from working; and the reason is, that the Soul does not mind to hearken
to Christ within? Now, we charge these upon R. W. to be Horrid Lies. For Christ
was Crucified according to the flesh; but the Scripture does not say, that the
Eternal God dyed, nor his Eternal Spirit. And David, when he sinned, was
afraid, that God would take his holy Spirit from him: and therefore we charge
R. W. with these Lies and Slanders, which were never in our thoughts* And
Christ says to John ( Revel. 1.) I am he that lives, and was Dead; and
behold, I am alive for Evermore, and have the Keys of Hell and Death: though we
say, as the Apostle said of some, that Crucified to themselves the Son of God
afresh, and put him to open shame, like R W; and as Christ says to Saul, why
persecutest thou me? etc. and as Christ says, Math. 25. I was in Prison, and
naked, and sick, and hungry, etc. and I say unto you, In as much as you have
done it unto one of the least of my Brethren, ye have done it unto me, etc. --
And as for poor, simple, brutish Imaginations, and Men professing
Christianity, or Men professing to know more, then the Wolves and Foxes in the
wildernesses, These Expressions R. W. may keep at home; for it suites his own
Abusive spirit the best, and not the People of God called Quakers. And R W.
confesses, that there is something of God in the Disobedient and Reprobates: we
do believe, it does Judge him sometimes; and its like it might struggle with
him, before he brought forth this Birth of Confusion.

R W. Thou say, There is something of God, that is from the power and wisdom
of God in the fallen Spirits the Devils themselves.

Answ. But R W. has not proved this doctrine of his by Scripture. The Wisdom of
God is gentle and pure, and the power of God, is pure and holy; and something
of God is pure: Is this something of God of his divine being, wisdom, and power
in the fallen Spirits the Devils R W? for thy words are, There is something of
God, that is from the power and wisdom of God in the fallen Spirits the Devils
themselves; but no proof from Scripture thou have brought. For Christ said unto
the Jews, Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will
do; he was a Murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because
there is no truth in him (mark, no truth in him, to wit, the Devil) when he
speaks a lie, he speaks of his own; for he is a Liar and the Father of it.
Mark this R W. Christ says, there is No Truth in him (to wit, the Devil) and
God is the God of truth; and that which is of him, or of his power and wisdom
is True; which thou say, There is something of God, that is from the power
and wisdom of God, etc. in the fallen Spirits, and the Devils themselves (mark,
in them) and Christ plainly says, There is no truth in the Devil: Is not
something of God (to wit, his power and wisdom) Truth? so do thou not here
oppose Christ's doctrine, as well as ours? and we charge him and the N. England
Priests, to make this good by Scripture.

R W. And whereas thou say, G F. means God himself (pressed down as a Cart
with sheaves) the holy Seed Christ Jesus (under the clods) the holy Spirit in
Prison: for the Soul is a part of the Essence or being of God himself. But that
there is here a word or title of color to any of this dirt, and filth flung in
the face of the Majesty of Heaven?

Ans. Here R. W. surely wants matter, when he gives his meanings to G F's
words: and when he has done, he says, This dirt and filth flung in the face of
the Majesty of Heaven. --

R W, This is thy own dirt and filth: but in the face of the Majesty of God in
Heaven thou cannot fling it; he is too high above thee, or any one else to
fling so far dirt and filth in his face. Oh R W, that ever thou professing thy
self to be a Christian, should utter forth such words! And it may be seen
Amos 2, 13, how the Lord said to the transgressing Jews, I am pressed under you,
as a Cart is pressed, that is full of Sh^aves; and this was not Flinging dirt
in the face of the Most High: and may not the same be said to the Christians,
and to you Priests and professors in N. England that rebel against Gods
Spirit, that they press it, and quench it? And does not Christ say, I was in
Prison, and ye visited me not ( to wit, in his members) and what, must not
these Scriptures be owned? -- And does not Christ say, he is the Seeds-man,
thas Sowes the good Seed in all grounds: and is not the same Seed Sown upon the
Thorny ground, etc. as well as the Good? and does not this spring through the
goo^ Earth, and bring forth 30, 50, etc? -- And did not God breath into Man the
breath of life, and he became a Living Soul, and is not that part of his
breath? etc.

R W. And thou say, This Scripture Romans 1, 2. speaks of the works, or
working of the written Law in their hearts [here thou art made to confess the
truth.] But (thou say) What is this to the second writing, or the holy
Scriptures, or writing inspired into the hearts by the most Holy Spirit? yea,
or what is this to a third writing of their names in Heaven in the Lambs book
of Life? and what is this to a fourth writing of the New Covenant consisting of
sin, and a new heart, a heart of flesh, in which the Law was written, as
formerly in tables of stone?

Ans. The New Covenant does exceed the Old; for the one was in Tables of Stone:
and they had their Offerings and Sacrifices, etc. and the Priests Lips were to
preserve the peoples knowledge. But Christ is come, our High Priest, which ends
the Priesthood of Aron: and so, he is the New Covenant promised ( Heb. 8) And
the Lord says, ( Jer. 31, 33.) I will put my Laws in their minds, and write
them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
People [and this writing is with the Spirit or Finger of God.] And they shall
not teach every man his Neighbor, and every man his Brother, saying, know the
Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the greatest: And I will be
merciful to their Unrighteousness, and their Sins and Iniquities I will
remember no more. So, the First Covenant waxes old, and decays; but this is
an Everlasting Covenant, the New Covenant; and Christ is an unchangable Priest,
[who is holy, harmless, separate from Sinners, and made higher then the
Heavens. And so they that know Christ to be their High Priest know him to be a
more greater and perfect Tabernacle, then that made with hands: and all the
true believers in him can say, he is the Treasure of Wisdom and Knowledge. And
such as be in Christ Jesus are New Creatures; and the old things pass away,
whether they be Jews o^ Gentiles. And the Church of Christ, which is in the
New Covenant, the true Believers, is come to Mount Sion, and unto the City of
the Living God, and to New Jerusalem, and to Jesus the Mediator of the New
Covenant, and to the blood of Sprinkling, etc. and to the general Assembly, and
Church of the First born, which are written in Heaven: and here the Saints did,
and do know the Heavenly Genealogies, and their Names written in the Lambs book
of Life before the foundation of the World, glory to his Name for ever. And
such can say, that the Blood of Christ ends the blood of Bulls and Goats; and
he, the offering, ends the offerings in the times of the Law: and so, Christ is
the end of the Law for Righteousness sake to them that believe -- And the work
of the Law written in the hearts, which does the work of the Law, is not
opposite to the written Law; for it Judged them, that had the written Law, and
did not live in it. And the Children of the New Covenant can say; If the
Ministration of death written and graven in stone, was glorious, etc. how shall
not the Ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? for if the Ministration
of Condemnation be glorious, much more does the Ministration of Righteousness
exceed in glory: for even that, which was made glorious, had no glory in this
respect, by reason of the glory that excells it, etc. 2 Cor. 3. So, we can
praise the Lord through Jesus Christ, who is come, and has ended the Priesthood
of Aaron, and his Temple and Tithes, and his Services; who said to his
Discipl^s and Ministers, Freely ye have received, freely give. And Christ is
our New and Living Way to the Father; praises be given to the Lord God for
ever. And what do thou talk of these 4. Writings, and have No motion in
Heavenly things within thee R W? -- And then thou tells us of a New Covenant
consisting of Sin, and a new heart, and a heart of flesh. Answ. All the
Believers in the New Covenant have a new heart, and a heart of flesh; and
Christ takes away the stony heart, and the Sin. And as Daniel says, He shall
make an end of Sin, and finish transgression; and bring in Everlasting
Righteousness, and make reconciliation for Iniquity, and^. Dan. 9.

R W. And then thou say; And yet we poor men of Jabesh Gilead must leave the
Testimony ( as Gilead imports) and suffer Nahash (the Serpent) to put out our
Eyes --

Answ. This is thy own Condition, if thou could see it: and truly R W. thou
art blind enough without putting out of thy eyes.

R W. And further thou say, -- and must believe, that every man has the New
Covenant Christ Jesus, and the Kingdom of God with the Pharisees in every man's
heart; and yet he never knows of it.

Answ. Nay, thou do not believe this. Neither do the Quakers say, that every
man has Christ Jesus, the New Covenant: for them that hate the Light of
Christ, hate him, the New Covenant; and do not believe, that it is he that does
enlighten them, and has dyed for their sins without the gates of Jerusalem.
And Christ says to such; If ye do not believe, that I am he, ye shall dye in
your sins: and that is a sad dying; for such are they, that hate his Light,
etc. And Christ said to the Pharisees ( Luke 17.) when the Pharisees demanded
of Christ, when the Kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said; The
Kingdom of God comes not with Observations, neither shall they say, Lo here,
or Lo there; for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you. Now, says R W, the
Pharisees, etc. never know of it; and therefore Christ has taught them, where
to know it. But we do not read, that the Pharisees made such slighting words
against Christ's doctrine, as R W. does: but we must believe Christ's words
before his. And we do charge R W. and his N. England Priests to make it good by
Scripture A New Covenant consisting of sin.

R W. And thou brings J. Bunion, who says, It is a Counterfeiting of the new
birth for men to follow the Light within, wherewith men comeing into the world
are enlightened withal. And then R W. goes on, and says, There is two Opinions
of the Light, and says, it is not enlightening Every man [but let him look in
his Latin, how it says there? p. 6.
] And then he says, There is two Opinions, how Christ lights every man:
First, as God in the Creation; Secondly, as God Man and Mediator. And again
thou say, that it must be read in this sense, that Christ Jesus the True
Light coming into the world lights every man, that is in the world, freely,
that will receive him; even as many (whomsoever) look up to him: the stung
Israelites to the brazen Serpent, etc. And that the mere phrase imports no
more, then a Light held forth to all the world; as the Sun in the Heavens; and
Christ's followers are called by Christ the Light of the World.

Answ. Why do thou abuse the Scriptures and would ^o about to darken them
with thy Meanings and Opi^^ons and thy dark Sense? For though thou take this
Scripture, as it speaks [ The followers of Christ are the Light of the world]
yet thou would not take John's words ( chap. 1.) as he speaks them. For thou
say, he lights every man etc that will receive him, even as many
(whosoever) took up to him [which is true in a sense] These are thy words, and
not John's. For John says, That was the true Light, which Lights every man,
that comes into the world; and the Light shines in darkness, and darkness
comprehends it not; and they that hate the Light, and love darkness more then
Light, and will not come to the Light, because it will reprove them, these are
enlightened with the same Light, as they that loves it, John 3. But do thou
see thy own Contradiction? for thou say, Christ Enlightens every man, as
God-man and Mediator, etc. and then thou say, That he enlightens every man,
that will receive him, even as many as look up to him: and therefore by thy
words, they that do not receive Christ, and look not up to him, are not
enlightened by Christ. So in this thou contradicts thy self, and speaks contrary
to the Apostles doctrine, who says; That was the true Light, which lights
every man, that comes into the world; that ^^in'd in darkness, and darkness
comprehended it not. And therefore in thy darkness thou can not comprehend
the Light: so, for shame give over abusing the Scriptures. -- And how is the
World Condemned with the Light, if it be not enlightened? The Sun is a Light or
a public Minister to all men; except they be blind, they may see it: but
Christ enlightens every man, and is the Covenant of the Light, which God has
given to be Salvation to the ends of the Earth. But they* that love the
darkness rather then Light, it is their Condemnation, as before: and them that
receive Christ, he gives power to become the Sons of God. And thou say The
lord Every man, etc. is used not Absolutely but Comparatively etc. so taken in
many places. and bringst 1 Col. 28 which the Apostle speaks of; We warning
every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom* that we may present every one
perfect in Christ Jesus, and say; which cannot Literally be true. And yet
thou take [ That the followers of Christ are the Light of the world] to be
literally true, and not the other: and this is thy Ignorance of the Scriptures,
and the power of God. For the Apostle says; We warning and teaching every man,
etc. For did not Christ bid his Disciples Go, and Preach the Gospel in all
Nations unto every Creature Matthew. 28, 9. Mark. 16, 15? and will thou say, that
this is not Literally true? thou, that lies at home and opposes Christ and the
Apostles doctrine; who warned every man, and taught every man, that they might
present every man perfect in Christ Jesus? And this they labored, and strove
and traveled for, that were imperfect in Old Adam, to present them perfect in
Christ Jesus: and the Apostles words are true and plain to the understanding of
them, that has the Spirit, that gave them forth; but not to thee. And so
John's words are true ( Joh. 1.) Christ enlightneth every man, etc.

R W. And thou say; Christ as a Mediator enlightens none but the Elect: and
art finding fault with the word [ All] and say: Fox runs, etc. willingly
ignorant about the word [All] And thou say; That Christ as a Mediator of the
New Covenant enlightens none, but whom the Father gives him, unto whom he gives
repentance, and opens the door of Faith and gives them to believe, etc

Answ. Here still thou art in opposition to the Apostles doctrine, and
Contradicts thy self. For do not thou say a little before, How that Christ
enlightens every man, as God in the Creation? 2dly. as God man and Mediator:
and now thou say; Christ the Savior, enlightens none, but whom the Father
gives him? etc. And how now R W. what a Babylon art thou building here in thy
Contradictions? but still the Apostle of Christ his words will stand over thy
head, Christ is the Light of the world, and the True Light, which lights
every man, though they hate it, and the darkness cannot comprehend it. And they
that hate the Light, hate Christ the Mediator, and the New Covenant, from
whence it comes: and they that love the Light, which Christ enlightens them
with all, they Love Christ, and believe on the Light, and become Children of
the Light, and come to Repentance: and come to Christ their Mediator, who is
their Door, and the Author and Finisher of their Faith. And such Believers in
the Light, as Christ Commands, become Children of the Light, and are grafted
into Christ, and suffer with Christ: and such are the Elect. And so G F. does
not Confound the Elect and the World to either, and does not bring in a
Counterfeit New Birth, nor a Counterfeit Christ, nor a Counterfeit Salvation,
as thou falsely charges; but this is thy own; and belongs to thy self, who
speaks falsely of the Scriptures, and contrary to John 1. and preaches another
doctrine then he has done; which the world may believe thee, but the Elect
will not.

R W. And thou say, All Mankind being fallen from God, God g^ve the word to
Abraham, etc. and made promises both to his Natural and Spiritual Seed: p. 7.
hence came the distinction of the Jews and Gentiles, etc. And then thou
say, It pleased God to make two Bargains or Covenants, the first was of
Justice, etc. and the second was of Mercy and Pity, etc.

Answ. But where do thou read in the Scripture of Bargains? why can thou
not keep to Scripture Language? But here thou confesses, that the promise of
God is general, both to the Spiritual and Natural Seed. The first Covenant is
plainly to be understood; and so is the second with them that be the true
Believers in Christ Jesus, and Children of the New Covenant: and they that
dis-obeyed the Law in the Old Covenant, received punishment; and so do they
that dis-obey the Gospel. For the Apostle says, When the Lord Jesus shall be
Revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking Vengeance
on all them that do not know God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power 2 These. 1. And so thou
call'st the Old Covenant and New Covenant, Bargains: and yet thou'I say in
another place, the Scripture is thy Rule; and yet can not speak
Scripture-terms. And then thou say, It is common with the holy Spirit to
speak figuratively in the holy Scripture, etc. But the Spirit that gave forth
the Scripture, has not called the two Covenants, as thou do, Two Bargains.
For we know, the one Covenant is of Works, and the other is of Grace: and the
Apostle speaking of the two Covenants* says, The one is from Mount Sinai,
which gendereth to Bondage, etc. but Jerusalem which is above, is the Mother of
us all (true Christians). Thou may read Gal. 4. and the Hebrews, and see
there, how he describes the two Covenants better then thou can.

R W. And thou say, It is one thing for God to offer this Covenant or
Bargain ( wherever the sound of this Gospel or glad News comes) and another
thing, to receive and embrace it, as all the Elect do; and another thing, to
work freely, and give freely the Means and Power to fulfill this Covenant, as
God does by the Merits of his Son, and his own powerful working of Repentance
and Belief in the hearts of all his Chosen.

Answ. What! will R W. lay the fault upon God concerning all the rest of the
world, that disobey his Gospel, and hate his Light, and turn his Grace into
wantonness, and quench his Spirit, and make Shipwreck of Faith and a good
Conscience; and disobey the Gospel, and deny the Lord that bought them, and
Crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh? Had not these the free Gospel and
Mercy of God? if not, how will God Judge the World in Righteousness by Christ
Jesus according to the Gospel, which the Apostle calls the power of God, etc.
Romans 1? And how will Christ beat them with many stripes, that know the Will,
and do it not? -- And they are the Elect, that receive Christ; whom he has
given power to become the Sons of God: and are grafted into him, and walk in
him.

R W. And then thou goes on, and tells of the King pardoning, and of a Bargain
between two Chapmen, etc. and of a Marriage of a man and a woman, p. 8.
though they be absent each from other, and may in a figurative sense be called
a Bargain or Covenant, and yet not literally, and properly, as the Quakers
would have their Christ to be.

Answ. What dark stuff is this? For the Saints, that are Married to Christ by
his Spirit, and receive him, they are his Sheep, that hear his Voice; and
according to his promise, he will dwell in them, and walk in them. And, the
Saints are grafted into him: and, Abide in me, and I in you, faith Christ, John
15. And Christ says; I in them, and thou in me: and Father, I will, that they
also, whom thou have given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my
Glory, which thou have given me, John 17. And the Apostle says, that Christ
rules in their hearts by faith; and he will come and Sup with the Saints, and
the Saints shall Sup with him. And the Apostle says (Ephesians. 5.) As the Husband
is the Head of his Wife, so is Christ the Head of his Church: as there is a
nearness in Nature, there is a nearness in the Spirit; and he that has not the
Spirit of Christ, is none of his. And Christ Jesus is our New Covenant, and
Pasha-Lamb, our Passover, which has ended the Jews; and is our hope of Glory,
and Mediator to God, who pardons the Sins, and blots them out: through whom we
can praise God. And as for thy two Chapmen, and Bargains, and absent Marriage*
thou may keep at home, for they that are Married to Christ, do enjoy him in
his Light and Spirit.

R W. And whereas thou speak of Gods Inviting gently to come to his Heavenly
Wedding and Supper, etc. and the Kingdom of Heaven is taken by Force, etc. it
is not him that wills, nor runs, but in God that shows mercy; and the
rest he justly hardens, that God may be All in All.

Ans. We are sensible of Gods tender Mercies to all Mankind in his Gospel, and
how he Invites to his Wedding-supper. But the Rich Professors think, they have
enough, that they have gotten by their willing and Running: but we know, it is
not him that wills or runs; but the Election obtains the promise. And Jacob was
the Second birth, and Esau was the first birth, hated: and let R W. look into
himself, and see, if there be not the Nature of Esau and Pharaoh in him, that
is hardened? And how must God be all in all, and invite them to his Supper, if
he does not enlighten All?

R W. And then thou tell of God walking in the midst of his Creation with
his two feet of Mercy and Justice; and how he wrote the Covenant of Justice in
Tables of Stone, etc. and how he writes with the fingers of his Mercy and Grace
his Mind and Will in the Tables of flesh, and hearts of his Chosen. And, Many
offers of Bargains and Marriages are made, which never are embraced, etc. but
in the New Covenant God gives a new heart to his Chosen; and gives not, and is
not the Covenant to any, but his Chosen all the world over, even to the ends of
the Earth.

Answ. If God walks in the midst of his Creation, where is it, if it be not
in the midst of the hearts of people in his Light, doing Justice upon the
Unrighteous? and if he writes his will in the Tables of the fleshly hearts,
then therein they do know his will; and then that Scripture or writing must be
in them, according to thy Assertion, which I question, whether thou will own
thy own words again, or no. -- And thou say; Many Offers of Bargains and
Marriages are made, but never embraced. With what are they made? with the
Spirit of God, and never Embraced? -- Thou say; A Marriage may be between a
man and a woman, when they are absent each from other. But can a Marriage be
made with Christ without his Spirit, and belief in him? and he that believes,
is grafted into Christ: and he that has not the Spirit of Christ, is none of
his; and then how is he Married? And we know, that God has given a New Heart
to his Children in the New Covenant of Light* but they that hate the Light,
hate the Covenant.

R W. And thou say; It is a monstrous dream of the Quakers to say, That God,
and Christ, Spirit and Covenant is in All Mankind.

Answ. And yet thou say, that God is All in All. And thou say, God walks
in the midst of his Creation with his two feet of Mercy and Justice, and
therefore I query, where it is, that God walks? whether it be not in the hearts
of the Creation (to wit, his people)? and if so, who is the Monstrous Dreamer?
is it not R W? And we must tell him and them, That hate the Light of Christ,
hate Christ, though he stands at their doors, and knocks. And thou abusest the
Doctrine of the Prophets, and the Apostles, who say, Christ is not the New
Covenant of Light, given to none but the Chosen, who enlighteneth every Man,
that comes into the world, to the Condemnation of them that hate it, and the
Salvation of them that believe in it.

R W. Thou say, It Is true, if G, F. mean, that the knowledge of God in a
sense is offered to each man's Conscience in the world; though more expressly and
gloriously, where he sends his Messengers, Wisdoms Virgins, etc.

Answ. G.F. means as he says, according to the Scripture as he brings. But if
it be proffered to each man's Conscience in the world by his Messengers, is not
there then the Light of Christ in the Conscience, for them to understand
Wisdoms Virgins, or his Messengers, that be full of the power and Spirit of
God? or else how will God judge the world in Righteousness, according to the
Gospel, the power of God? And do not thou contradict thy self here again,
that say, He gives none the New Covenant, but to the Chosen?

R W. And then thou say, But to say, the Covenant or Bargain, and the
Mediator of a New Bargain, and the Applyer of it, the holy Spirit is in every
of Mankind, and if they will turn to it, etc. and yet persons know no such
thing, nor never heard of it; and none never had it so, as to be saved by it,
but these Foxians, etc.

Answ. How now R W. had none never the New Covenant, but we (whom thou
scornfully calls Foxians) as to be saved by it? I cannot believe thee, but that
Christ sent his Disciples into all Nations to Preach the Gospel, and the New
Covenant: and yet thou say, That none never had it so, as to be saved by it,
but we? And again thou say, Yet persons know no such thing, nor never heard
of it: and before thou say, That the knowledge of God in a sense is offered
to each man's Conscience in the world; and what! never heard of it R W? But is
not the Mediator of the New Covenant, Christ (which thou call'st New Bargain?)
were not the Disciples to Preach him to all Nations, and to every Creature? who
dyed for their Sins, and was risen again for their Justification; who
enlightens every man that comes into the world, that they might see him their
Mediator?

R W. And then thou tell a story of a man having fits of the Gout, and a
woman having the pangs of Childbearing; yet neither of them knowing any such
matter, or how she had any such Marriage, Covenant, or Husband, etc.

Answ. And truly, thou might very well applied this at home. And why should not
every man that comes into the world, be enlightened with Christ the New
Covenant, or Bridegroom, according to John 1? And the Lord says (speaking of
Christ) I have called thee in Righteousness, and I will hold thine hand, and
will keep thee, and will give thee for a Covenant of the people: for a Light of
the Gentiles, etc. and they that love the Light of Christ, that shines in their
hearts, it will give them the knowledge of Christ their Husband, and become
Children of Light, and do know, how they are Married to him in truth and
righteousness. But they that hate this Light, which lights every man, etc.
they are not like to come into the New Covenant, nor to the Marriage of Christ.

R W. And thou say, G F. cares not for the Jews, nor Gentiles, no more than
the Fox cares for the Lambs and Chickens, but to make a prey of them; p. 9.
though he pretends Love to all Mankind, and tells them, they have Christ and
the New Covenant, and the Spirit within them, etc. and he means not the
Covenant of works, but of grace, etc. he means that Christ, that dyed at
Jerusalem, etc. but when it comes too, they mean no other Christ but a Spirit;
this Spirit will be found to be an Evil Spirit, etc. (as one says) upon them.

Answ. Here thou have published more of thy Lies and Slanders against us to the
world, the Lord God knows. For our Love to Jews, and our Love to Gentiles has
been manifest; and our labor in the Lord has been much for them, and to them,
and to all Mankind, and not pretense (as thou scoffingly say) but in real
truth. And as for Caring no more for Jews or Gentiles, than Foxes for Lambs and
Chickens, to make a prey of them; and our pretenses of Soul-kindness to be
Soul-cruelties; this R W. thou might have kept at home, and the New England
Priests. -- And for telling all Mankind, that they have Christ in them, etc.
in this thou wrongest us. For we turn them to the Light, which Christ has
enlightened them withal, that they might with it see Christ, and receive him,
and come into the Covenant of grace: and so we turn them, as the Apostle did,
from Darkness to Light, etc. And where was this Darkness? and where was this
Light? for did not the Apostle, which turned both Jews and Gentiles to the
Light, turn them to the Covenant of Grace? And the Lord says; I will give thee
for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou may be my Salvation to the ends of
the Earth; and does either Jew or Gentile know their Salvation, but by this
Light of Christ? -- And where thou slightingly say twice, he means the New
Covenant, and he means Christ that dyed at Jerusalem; and when it comes too, he
means no other Christ, but a Spirit: and then thou bring'st in Humphry Norton,
but bring'st no proof what he says; therefore that is turned back upon thee.
But where did thou ever read in any of the Quakers Books, that they said,
That it was a Spirit, that dyed at Jerusalem, as thou say we mean? And then
thou say, This will be found an Evil Spirit ( as one says, etc.) and this
is thy own lying Evil Spirit, that is out of the truth: for Christ Jesus, that
was born of a Virgin, the man Christ Jesus, who suffered according to the
flesh, and dyed without the Gates of outward Jerusalem, and was buried, and
rose again, and sits at the Right Hand of God, and yet manifest in his People
by his Spirit; is gathering us by his Spirit to his Heavenly Jerusalem, Glory
to his Name for ever.

R W. And thou say, That G F. slights the Scripture with a But; It is but a
Declaration of the Saints Faith; and, he slights he Novelty of it, saying,
There was Faith, before there was Scripture: and then thou say, It Is
wonderful, what an aching Tooth against the holy Writings of God, the old
Serpent, and all the Wolves and Foxes of this world have ^ad, who have more or
less damned and cursed it, and longed to have it out of the world.

Answ. We own and esteem the Holy Scriptures of truth, which the holy Men of
God were moved to give forth by the Holy Ghost; but we cannot own them to be
the means and Author of our Faith: for Christ Jesus is the Author and finisher
of our Faith, which is the Gift of God; as they that gave forth Scripture,
said. And thy Slanderous tongue belyes us in saying, What a Toothache we have
against the Scripture, or the Holy Writings of God, or that we would have them
out of the world, or ever cursed them, or slighted them; but we Esteem them,
and can bless the Lord for them. For the Jews had Scripture of the Old
Testament, who were not in the Faith of Moses and the Prophets; and Christ bid
them Search the Scriptures, for they testified of him, (Joh. 5, 39, 40.) but
they would not come to him, that they might have Life, who is the Author of
their Faith. But they thought to have had Life in the Scriptures, as I K. and R
W. think, the Scripture is the means of Faith; and then do not you throw out,
and leave off God and Christ, and holy means, and Author of Faith, etc? And
does not the Apostle bid them Look unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their
Faith, Heb. 12, 2? and God deals to every man the measure of Faith, Romans 12, 3.
so let God and Christ have their Glory. And had not Abraham and Enoch Faith,
before the Scripture was written? and is the Scriptures the means of Faith, or
Christ? or but a Declaration of Faith? or is it Faith it self, R W?

R W. And thou say, The Jews, Turks, and Papists, etc. and Quakers make use
of it (the Scriptures) for their ends.

Answ. But why did thou not put in thy self, and the New England Priests?
thou might have left out the Quakers, for thou belyest them. For do not your
Priests make a trade of them for their Bellies, or their own ends? for if the
Priests Means were taken away, there would be little Using or Preaching of the
Scriptures by them. But all that fear God, know that thou wrong'st us in
saying, that we make use of them for our own ends; as the Lord God knows. For
we prove by Scripture, that Jesus is the Christ, and Preach him freely, as the
Apostles did; and have suffered Persecution, and Spoiling of Goods, and Death
it self amongst you New England Priests and Professors: and yet thou would
have the Magistrates to Punish us, manifesting thy Birth of the Flesh, as it is
said before.

R W. And further thou say: None can rightly use it but as a Blessed Candle,
Lanthorn, or Torch sent down from Heaven into this dark Dungeon of the world,
to guide us out unto the saving knowledge of God, and Eternal Blessedness with
him.

Answ. Where does the Apostle call the Scripture of the New Testament, a
Candle, a Lanthorn, or Torch? I say, that none can Use the Scriptures aright,
but with that Holy Ghost, that leads into all the truth of them, and gave
them forth through the Holy men, which received them from God, and spoke them
forth, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost: and we can praise God for them,
who have the comfort of them, and the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ. And have
not thou here set up the Scriptures instead of Christ, for Saving knowledge,
and a Guide, and instead of the Holy Ghost? and the Jews which had the
Scriptures, resisted him that gave the Saving knowledge.

R W. says: How does this follow, that if God has appointed the Holy Writings
as means, that God and Christ are thrown out?

Answ. As being the Author and Finisher of the Saints Faith, when as you make
them the Means, and not God and Christ. And if the Scriptures be the Means of
Faith, then what Means had Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses,
before the Scripture was written, if the Scripture be the means of Faith?

R W. Thou say. Cannot there be a Harmony between the First, and all
Subordinate Causes?

Answ. Yes, if thou meanest the Scriptures of Truth.

R W. And further thou say: Did Moses throw out God, because he took the Rod
in his hand, when he wrought all those Wonders? and did Solomon, because he
used so many Means in Rearing the Temple ( as Moses about the Tabernacle? p. 10.
) Or Sampson, when he used the Jaw Bone of an Ass? or Christ throw out his
Father, when he made use of Clay and Spittle?

Answ. Solomon's Temple, and Moses's Tabernacle, and the Jaw Bone of an Ass
were not the Author and Finisher of their Faith, nor a Means of their Faith:
for had not they Faith in God before? and Solomon and Moses did that, which God
commanded them. And will thou say, that Clay and Spittle was the Author of the
Faith of Christ, and none of these threw out God, or the Father, as being the
Author of their Faith? for those things were done by Faith.

R W. And thou say: O what a throwing Spirit -- who toss and throw the
Eternal and the Invisible God, and his only begotten Son in their wild fancies,
as if they were Wool and Feathers of Lambs and Chickens, which these Foxians
have devoured.

Answ. As to Devouring Lambs and Chickens of Christ, thou might have kept this
at home, for it is thy own work. And we must tell thee, that the Eternal
Invisible God cannot be tossed; nor his only begotten Son, who sits at his
Right Hand, cannot be tossed at all, much less like Wool and Feathers, as thou
wickedly speak: and in this thou have manifested, that thou have little
knowledge of God, or Christ, who say, They can be tossed like Feathers. And
is this the Mad Doctrine of the Priests in New England? let the Reader see, if
Nebuchadnezar, and Darius had not more Knowledge of God then R W. who says,
God may be tossed like Feathers, read Dan. 4, 3, 34. and c. 7, 14, 27. Isa. 40,
28. Psalm. 41, 13. Psalm. 19, 2. 1 Pet. 1, 11. 1 Timothy 6, 16.

And as for thy Throwing Spirit, and Wild Fox, thou may keep it at home; for
our desires are, that all may come to Christ, their Savior and Salvation, and
not have them devoured by such a Spirit as thine is. And thou must not think,
that the Eternal God can be tossed like thy self, this is a base Language; but
the Lord will rebuke thy Spirit: and it is a shame to the New-England-Priests
(if they have any) to encourage this Orator in Printing this Unworthy stuff. --
And the Quakers do not deny, that the Scriptures are a Record of Heaven, and a
Record of the being of the Eternal Power and Godhead, and of the Practice of
the holy men of God, and the death and sufferings of Christ, and of the holy
Men of God, etc. And is not the Scripture a Declaration of the Faith of God,
and of Christ, and the holy Men of God? Luke 1.

R W. And thou say: For, is it not a writing, or Record of Heaven?

Answ. These are thy own words. For the Quakers say, The holy men of God spoke
forth the Scriptures, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost: and they do
believe, that the Scriptures are a True Record of the glorious works of his
Creating and Forming the Earth, and the Sea, and all things therein, and of
Making Man and Woman in his Image; and of the Fall of Mankind from their
glorious First State in Paradise, which, R W. says, some talk Idly to be Every
day; Roger, go and tell them of it to their faces, and not backbite them.

R W. And thou say: Which mysteries the Quakers have only from the
Scriptures.

Answ. For the Apostle says: Through Faith we understand, that the Worlds were
framed by the word of God; so that things which are seen, were not made of
things which do appear, Heb. 11. now, what will R W. and his Company say to the
Apostle here? And we say, that the Scripture does declare of the Promise of the
Father of Mercies, and of Christ a Restorer and a Redeemer of fallen Mankind,
who is a Maker-up of the breach; and how that the Seed of the Woman should
bruise the Serpents head, that made the breach. And the Scriptures are a Record
of all the Travails of the Children of Israel, with all their Types and
Figures, which Christ is the Substance of; who set up his worship in Spirit and
in Truth above 1600. years ago, Joh. 4. And we say and believe, that the
Scriptures are a True Record of Christ's fulfilling the Promise of the Father,
and Prophets, and of his Birth, Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Resurrection,
Ascension of the Son of God, the Man Christ Jesus. And it is a true Record of
the Believers in the Light of Christ, before he was Crucified, and after his
Ascension; and of his glorious Church in the Primitive times, which he was the
Head of. And we believe, it is a true Record of the Apostasy, of such as are
erred from the Faith, and from the Spirit, and inwardly ravened, and become
Antichrists, and went forth from the Apostles: and such as went in Balaam's,
Cain's, and Korah's way, and became Raging waves of the Sea, casting up mire
and dirt (like R W.) spoken of in Jude; and became Gainsayers of the Truth,
and Killers about Religion, like Cain, and the New England Priests and People.
And R W. etc. would have us punished: and here you appear with your Horns, like
them that are spoken of in the Revelations, against the Lamb and his followers;
but the Lamb will have the Victory, Glory to God for ever. And the Writing in
the Revelations is a true Record of the Whore drinking the blood of the Saints,
and the Beast making War with them; which Beast rise out of the Sea, and out of
the Earth, and so not from Heaven: and the Beast received his power from the
Dragon (and so not from God nor Christ) by which he persecutes his Saints. And
of the Witnesses Rising, and of the Church's going into the Wilderness, and of
the Beast taken, and the Dragon, and the false Prophet cast alive into the Lake
of Fire, and of the burning up of the Whore, and of the Marriage of the Lamb;
and the Everlasting Gospel Preached again to all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues,
and People: and of the Heavenly Jerusalem, and of the Nations of them that are
saved, shall walk in the Light of the Lamb, etc, And does any come into this
City, but by the Light of Christ? and the Scriptures are a true Record of such
as are without the City, Whoremongers, Dogs, and Liars, etc. like R W. that
has so belyed the People of God. And the Spirit, and the Bride says, Come to
this City and Tree of Life; and Let him that hears, say, Come: let him that
is a thirst, Come; and whosoever will, let him take of the water of Life
freely. And we believe all that is written in the Scriptures of Truth, and can
sing Hallelujah, and praise the Lord for all his Mercies, that he has revealed
to us through his Son. And the Scripture is a true Record of the Joys of the
Saints in this life, and after this life; and of the Torment of the wicked, as
Christ says, Go ye Cursed, etc. in his day of Judgment.

p. 11.
And thou say: It may be, G F. and the Quakers will say, they grant all this.

Answ, Yes, and more too, which is not mentioned here.

R W. Says: I question, whether you speak bona fide and in truth, without
Jesuitical Equivocations.

Answ. We abhor thy words; and thou may keep thy Jesuitical Equivocations to
thy self. For we speak the Truth, as it is in Jesus, and in the Faith, that he
is the Author of: and we do believe in our hearts, that we have more Esteem for
the Scriptures then thou, or any of the persecuting Priests in New England, or
their Professors. For how can you have an Esteem on the Scriptures, and be in a
persecuting Birth and Spirit, which they were not in, that gave them forth.

R. W. And thou say: What means this But ( The Scriptures is but a
Declaration of the Saints Faith?) O blind Guides, that undertake to guide men
through the Washes upon Life and Death. And then thou tell a Story of K.
John of England's Treasure, which thou may apply to thy self: and thou
say* what is your But, but the Jews, and Papists, and Quakers Cry, Crucify
him, hang up Christ Jesus; burn up the Scriptures, and all Bibles, Old and New
Testament, etc.

Answ. Here thou rankest us amongst the Jews and Papists, who art nearer them
thy self. And it is thou, that guidest People into the Washes, as thou call'st
them, if thou say, the Scriptures are the Means of their Faith, and not
Christ, who is the Author and Finisher of it: and we say, the Scripture is a
Declaration of the Saints Faith, (and not the Means, and Author, and giver of
their Faith) and how they received it; though the Scriptures declare of many
more things then the Saints Faith, both of God and Christ, etc. which the
Saints believed. And we abhor thy words in saying, That we Cry, Crucify
Christ, or hang him up, burn the Scriptures, and all the Bibles, the Old and
new Testament; We abhor thy thoughts and thy words. The Lord of Heaven knows,
that we have an Esteem of the Scriptures, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
have bowed to his Name, and can say, There is not Salvation by any other Name
under the whole Heaven, but by the Name of Jesus, who has bought us with a
price, his Blood: who is alive again, and lives for Evermore, and is ascended
above all at the Right Hand of God, too high for you to Crucify, or hang him
up; though you may Crucify him in his Members, and to your selves afresh, as
the New England Professors have done. But we Challenge R. W. and the
New England Priests, to prove it by Scripture, that Christ can be Crucified and
Hanged up again: and whether this be not contrary to Scripture, which says, He
is alive again, and lives for evermore?

R. W. And whereas thou say, what is the Saints Faith? you acknowledge none,
but the Faith of the wild Souls, called Quakers, etc.

Answ We acknowledge the Faith, which Jesus Christ is the Author and Finisher
of, and contend for it, which purifies our hearts, and is our Victory: in which
we plese God, which gives us access to God.

R. W. We poor Jews, and Papists, and Protestants, though we own the
Scriptur^s, some a part, and the rest all; yet we are all but Infidels, Devils,
etc.

Answ. The more is the pity: but take heed Roger, lest thou be not wilfully so.
And what! do the poor Jews and Papists own the Sciptures? and before thou
said, The Jews and Papists, etc. cried, burn up the Scriptures, and all the
Bible of the Old and New Testament, and yet Own the Scriptures some a part,
etc? Here Roger gives himself the Lie in his Contradictions.

R. W. And thou say again: What is this Saints Faith? this Fox's and the
Quakers Faith? is it any thing else, but a mere Babel and Confusion of God and
Faith, Christ and Faith, Spirit and Faith, Light and Faith, Justification and
Faith, Sanctification and Faith, Salvation and Faith, etc. and this is in every
one of Mankind in the world, if they will believe it?

Answ. Thou have made a Babel here, and say, it is the Quakers; but it is thy
own: and thou art a Scoffer at the Saints Faith, which Christ is the Author of.
And none knows Christ, nor their Sanctification, nor their Justification, nor
their Salvation, but by believing in the Light of Christ Jesus, who is the
Author and Finisher of their Faith: and the Quakers do say; Such as hate the
Light of Christ, which they should believe in, they hate their Sanctification,
and Justification, and Salvation, and Christ, the Author and Finisher of the
Saints Faith. So, thou speak falsely of us, if thou say, that we say, It
is in all Mankind: for they that hate the Light, receive not Christ the Author
and Finisher of their Faith.

R. W. And thou say, Neither Abraham, nor any Man had Faith, before it
pleased the Eternal and Invisible Deity to disclose himself by Word, or Sight,
or Dream, or Motion, etc. at several times it pleased him to spe^k, and last of
all by the Best and Clearest of all, his only Begotten Christ Jesus.

Answ. So thou do acknowledge, they had Faith from God, before the Scripture
was written. And thou do grant, that they had Motions, Sights, and Dreams
then; is not God the same now, who speaks by his Son, whom the Saints are to
look unto for the Author and Finisher of their Faith? R. W's. Contradiction:
and the Saints had Faith before Scripture was.
and if the Scripture be the Means, they are to look to the Scripture. For the
Apostle says, The Righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith: so,
can thou know Gods Righteousness or Faith without Revelation? But has God
spoken to thee by his Son? have thou heard his Voice Immediately from Heaven?
and yet thou say before, That the Scripture was the ground of Christ's and the
Saints Faith.

R.W. And thou say, When it pleased the Incomprehensible Majesty to command
his appearances by Words, Visions and Dreams, etc. to be written to st^nd upon
Record (for all Generations) shall we be such Fools and Franticks, as to say,
It was his word, when God spoke it to and in his Prophets; p. 12.
but now it is written, it is but Pen, Ink, and Paper, it is now but a dead
Letter; it is not Gods Word, God has but One Word, Christ, and the Scriptures
are his words? Oh the Audacious blockishness of the foul Spirit in these wild,
mad fancies of the Quakers.

Answ. Is not God the same now? do not his Young men see Visions, and his Old
men dream Dreams? and his Sons and Daughters Prophecy, as in Joel and Acts?
And when Moses Recorded, what God had revealed to Abraham and others by Visions
and Dreams, and said, ( Exodus 20.) God spoke all these Words; and do thou
say, Moses was Audacious and blockish, and a wild mad fancy, because he did not
call them the Word of God, but words? And Jerem. 35, 13. Hearken to my Words,
says the Lord; Isa. 51, 16. I will put my Words in thy mouth, Jer. 5, 14. I
will make my Words in thy mouth Fire: and Mark 10, 24. The Disciples were
astonished at Christ's Words: Luke 24, 8. and the Believers remembered the Words
of the Lord: and Christ says, Unto every man that hears the Words of this
Prophecy, if any man shall take away from the Words of this Book. So, were all
these Audacious and blockish, in a foul Spirit, and a mad, wild fancy, that
called them words, and not the Word? For the Scripture says, In the Beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word: and Christ his
Name is called the Word of God, Joh. 1. Rev. 19. therefore let God and Christ
have their Due, and the Scriptures have its due, which are recorded by the holy
men of God, and are profitable, etc. And the Saints that have Christ, have the
comfort of them. And does not the Apostle say, That they were made able
Ministers not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the Letter kills, but the
Spirit, gives Life? and does not the Apostle say, If the Ministration of Death
written and graven in stones, etc. and further the Apostle says, For as much
as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ, written not with
Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in the
^^eshly Tables of the heart? and do thou call those Blockish Expressions,
which we have often used? Poor man, thou know little of the Saints
Conditions. And we have an Esteem of the Scriptures: blessed be the Lord for
all his Mercies.

R. W. And thou say, They dare not ( though what dares not their Hellish
Spirit against the King of Heaven, etc?) and many words thou usest to prove the
Scriptures to be the words; and usest the Kings Name and Declarations, etc: and
then thou say, The bottom, and the truth is, the Spirit by which the Quakers
are acted, would be glad, that there were not such a Person called the Word of
God, nor such a writing, declaring so sweetly, so plainly, so fully, and so
Heavenly of him.

Answ. These be all Lies of thy own forging. And as for Hellish Spirit against
the King of Heaven, it is within thy own breast: for we can praise the King of
Heaven, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and own the Person of Christ
by the Spirit of Christ, that he has given us as fully and plainly, and as
Heavenly as the Scriptures declare him; whose Name is called the Word of God,
but not the Scriptures, Rev. 19. And we are built upon him, who was the
Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, and all Believers; praises to the Lord
for ever.

R. W. And thou say: G. F. is in his borough of the various sense of the
word Form.

Answ. Because G. F. says [The Apostles work was to bring People off the Form
(to wit, the Jews) to the Substance Christ, and they that keep People in the
Form without the power, was an Error, and was not in the Apostles work] Which
is true. And as for thy various sense of the word Form, which has respect to
Nature, to Arts, to Civil, Natural and Divine matters, G. F. mentions not such
things: and the Apostle would have them to live in the power of the Form of
Divine Matters.

R. W. And thou say, Shall I now (like a Fool, or a Mad Man) cry down all
Natural, Civil and Divine beings? are not all the Internal and External Forms,
Shapes, and Beings of the Creation in Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, of Angels,
Sun and Moon, Men, Birds, Beasts and Fishes, etc. glorious --?

Answ. Does G. F. cry down any of these Forms or Shapes? I say, thou art a Mad
Man, if thou do. And what is all this to the Apostle's saying, who says,
Having the Form of Godliness, but denying the Power, from such turn away; that
they might live in the Substance Christ Jesus. And yet the Form of Godliness
the Apostle does not bid them turn away from.

R. W. Thou say, G. F. runs to the Picture, or Forms of these forms, and
says Childishly, That the Form or Picture without the Life is nothing. And
then thou say, Who knows not that?

Answ. And then thou have answered thyself Childishly, as thou Scoffingly
confesses. But does G. F. mention Picture in his Answer?

R. W. Thou say: But to come to worship, was there not a Form, or manner of
Circumcision? the Passover? the Tabernacle? the Temple?

Answ. Yes, among the Jews. But do thou follow that Form? and must the
Christians follow that Form, or Christ? and does not the Apostle say: If you be
Circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing Gal. 5? and is not the Jews Temple
and Tabernacle abolished by Christ?

R. W. And whereas thou say: Did ever the Servants of God, when they
inveighed against the Customarines^, the Carelessness, the Pictures, and the
mere formality of the worshippers (Jews or Christians) inveigh against the
worship it self, and the Appointments of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ?

Answ. The true Prophets judged the Jews, when they lived in the Form without
the Power, and told them, their Service was no more then Cutting off a Dogs
neck: though the Prophets owned their worship, till Christ came. And then the
Believers in Christ denied the Jews worship, and Altars (which they offered
upon) when Christ was offered up once for all: and denied the Circumcision;
though it was death to a man, that was not Circumcised among the Jews. And they
that have the Form of Christianity, and deny the power, though they turn away
from them, they do not turn away from Christ Jesus, nor from the worship, which
Christ has set up in Spirit and in Truth; nor from the Christians Form of
Godliness. And it was the Labor of Gods Servants, to bring People to the
worship of God it self; and to bring them off their dead and mere formalizing
of them without the power, and their Pictures.

R. W. And thou say: What a shameless falsehood is it, that any of Gods
Messengers brought Gods people off from those Heavenly Fabrics, p. 13
which God erected by their Ministry, or Service all the world over.

Answ. Those Services and Offerings in the time of the Law, it was no Shame nor
falsehood to bring them off them to Christ the substance. And it is no Shame nor
Falsehood to turn away from them, that have the Form of Godliness, and deny the
power now among Christians, as the Apostle commands.

R. W. And thou say: May not Gods Messengers now cry out against the Apish
Imitations, and the Formalities of the Papists (so horribly and bloodily)
abusing Prayer, and Preaching, and Baptism, and the Lords Supper, etc. but
like the Assyrians or Babilonians, all these Christian Appointments must be
broken and tumbled down with Axes and Hammers, etc.

Answ. The Axes and Hammers, as thou speak of, are the New England Priests
and Professors Weapons, with their Whips and Goales, and Gallowses. For, have
the Papists been more bloody in this Age, then you have been? or the
Babilonians? or Assyrians? and though you cry against the Papists, yet you use
their Weapons, which you call Apish Imitations and Formalities. But God's
Messengers Weapons are Spiritual, who declare against the vain Formalities
either in Prayer or Preaching: yet they own the true Preachers (which are able
Ministers in the Spirit) and true Pray^ng in the Spirit; and the One Baptism,
Ephesians. 4. And as the Apostle says to the Corinthians, They were Baptized by
one Spirit into one body, 1 Cor. 12, 13.

R. W. And thou say: This is Treason and Rebellion in any Atheists, or
whomsoever; but more abominable Hypocritical in these Pharisaical Quakers, who
cry out against the Apish Imitatours, and yet themselves practice Preaching,
Praying, Congregations, Singings, Conventings, and Addings to, Castings out,
etc. full well (as the Lord Jesus speaks) abrogating the word and appointments
of God, that they may set up and establish their own Traditions, etc.

Answ. Thou have not told the Reader, what our Traditions are? which Christ
told the Jews. But here of all thy Abusive Expressions we are clear of, thy
Treason and Rebellion, and abomin^ble Hypocritical and Pharisaical; which words
suit thy own Spirit, and thou may apply them at home. And our Religion and
Way, and Preaching and Praying, and Singing is according to Scripture: and we
are gathered in the Name of Jesus Christ, where we find him in the midst of us
a Prophet, a Priest, and a Bishop, and a King to rule in our hearts; who
exercises his Offices in his Church. And if any professes the Truth, and does
not walk in it, such we deny: and the Believers are Added to Christ's Church
daily, praised be the Lord. And why do thou, and you Priests of New England
separate your selves from the Papists, and call her the bloody Whore of Rome,
when you are found in her Spirit, and not in the Spirit of the First Primitive
Christians?

R. W. And whereas thou say: G. F. cries out against all Scriptures and
common Sense, and against all Forms.

Answ. These are more of thy Untruths. For he owns all Holy Scripture, and does
not cry against all Forms: but such as have the Form of Godliness, and deny the
power, turn away from such. And he, and the Quakers own God's ways, and manners
of Gods worship in Spirit and Truth.

R. W. And thou say, G. F. cries up a Christ within, a Scripture within, and
a Church within, and Ministers within, and Baptism and Supper within, yet
practices the most of these (so many as their Idol requires, and will serve his
turn) as outwardly and visibly, as any in the world.

Answ. Is not Baptism of the Spirit within, that burns up the Chaff within?
how dark art thou! and have not the Ministers of the Spirit the Spirit within?
And does not the Apostle Preach Christ within the Saints? and does not Christ
say: I stand at the door, and knock, and if any man will hear my voice, and
open the door, I will come in to him, and will Sup with him, and he with me,
Revel. 3? But where did ever the Quakers say in any of their books, that the
Church or Congregation was within them? and these are thy own forged words, not
ours: and is not the Spirit and the Truth within, in which God is worshipped?

R. W. After thou have commended R. Baxt^r, our old Persecutor, thou say: It
has been his Observation (viz.) that the Churches of the Independents and
Baptists have been the source and spring, whence have flown the Generation of
the Quakers. And then thou contradicts him, and say; For my self I have
observed the contrary in these parts.

Answ. Nay, the Quakers spring is from that Fountain of Life, which the
Primitive Church was in, Glory to the Lord God for ever! who are built upon the
Rock and Foundation Christ Jesus. And R. W. do thou say, That the Quakers
sprung from the Ranters and Grindletonians? what Babel is this!

R. W. And whereas thou say: Although some rotten Professors, or weak souls,
though true, have been bewitched by these Soul-Witches, p. 14.
yet generally (where they have any Liberty) the National Church fills up their
numbers.

Answ Here thou judge others as well as the Quakers: but it is best to pply
it to thy own Spirit, and to see thy self first, and your own Rotten profession
at home. And where they have any Liberty, thou say; but we know thy Spirit,
and the New England Priests and Professors, that call Light Darkness, and
persecute the Truth: that is it, you would not have to Have Liberty, and call
it the Soul-witches; and therefore the Soul-witches thou may apply at home.

R. W. And thou say: W. Edmonson boasted of their Numbers (viz.) their
Religion is so Easi^, never coming near the Roots of Rotten Nature; but so
wonderfully agreing with it, and changing one Devil for another.

Answ. If the Quakers have Changed one Devil for another, as thou say, they
are changed from your Religion of New England, and them that upheld it, and
from thee; then thou do acknowledge, that thou and the New England
Profession was a Devil, and the Independents, and the Baptists according to
Baxter: but thy Fore fathers the Jews said, That Christ Jesus (our Lord and
Master, whom we are Changed to) that he had a Devil, and by the Prince of
Devils cast out Devils. And as for the Roots of Rotten Nature, that thou and
you may apply to your selves, which your Religion is made up of, which thou
would accuse the People of God withal, which are in the pure Religion,
James 1, 26, 27. but thou have manifested thy Religion with thy Unbridled
Tongue. And W. Edm. did not boast of our Numbers, for that is the Abuses of thy
Tongue: but we can praise the Lord through Jesus Christ, who adds to his Church
daily.

R. W. And then thou say, Thou adorest the Infinite power, etc. that they
were not ten thousand-fold more, etc. then they are: and then thou say, I
can demonstrate, that if G. F. ( for all their Hypocritical prating against
Carnal Weapons) get a Sword (as Mahomet did) most of the Popish and Protestant
and Pagan- world will easily be brought to dance after him.

Answ. This is from thy Evil Thoughts, and Cains Fear; G. F. and the Quakers
abhor thy words. But this is your Condition in New England; and because the
People of God will not dance after them, therefore they have Hanged them, and
Banished them, and Spoiled their goods. For the Lord and his Son knows, that
Our Weapons are Spiritual, that he has armed us withal: and if ever thou
had set foot in the pure Religion, which the Primitive Church and the
Quakers walked and walk in, thou would not say, It is so easy. But thou
speak Evil of that which thou know not, and utterest forth the malice and
envy of thy heart. And we do pray to the Father to send forth Laborers into
his Vineyard; and that is his Work and not Men's: and can praise the Lord at the
Conversion of Sinners. And as for Hypocritical prating, that is thy own.

R. W. And thou say to M. B. Was there ever a Child of God in this world,
but he was a Nazarite, separate from worldly persons, etc. as he comes to see
them, and endures not, that the Evil One should touch him?

Answ. If this were your Faith and Practice both of New England, and all our
Old Persecutors, then we should be One with you. But have not all our Opposites
both here and in New England persecuted us for worldly Maintenances, which
Christ nor his Apostles never did; who said, Freely ye have received, freely
give? And if you could not endure the Evil One to touch you, then you would be
a People free from sin.

R. W. And then thou make a great Ramble, and call'st it Considerations
touching the Separate Churches: and say, Has not Gods Jealousy raged
against the Jewish Whore-mongers, who defiled his first Bed? and will he wink
at the Christian-Adulterers and Adulteresses either in worship or Conversation?

Answ. Nay: therefore has the Lord sent forth his Servants to bid you Repent;
whom you have persecuted: for you are fallen from the Tenderness you were in at
first, that the Lord knows.

R. W. Thou say: With what Conscience can I (a National Protestant) separate
from my Father the Pope, or my Mother the Church of Rome, and my Brethren and
Sisters the Papists, etc. and yet must not be a Christian for other Souls to
see further degrees of that Separation necessary; I must bring up the foot of
every man's Light, Sight and Conscience to my last.

Answ. Here thou acknowledgest The Pope to be thy Father, and the Church of
Rome to be thy Mother, and not the Primitive Church or Jerusalem that is above,
which is the Mother of us all: but thou would bring all to thy dark Last;
and so would every persecuting Spirit, and dark Conscience. And why do you talk
of Separating from your Mother or Father the Pope, when you are found in their
Spirit? but the Quakers would have every Man and Woman to turn to the Grace and
Light of Christ Jesus, and not bring them into a Form without the power, as
your New England Professors have done. And we labor to bring all People to
Christ Jesus; and if thou call him the Last, thou have given him a New Name:
but the New England Priests bring People to their Last and dark Conscience, as
is manifest.

R. W. Thou say: This is my main ground of my Controversy with the proud
Quakers in themselves, and condemn others.

Answ This is false: for we tell them, the Light is their Condemnation that
hate it. But we must walk in the Light, as Christ Commands, who has
enlightened us; by which Light we see you, where we have left you.

R. W. And thou say: But they magnify ( with the Papists and Arminians)
Cursed rotten Nature, their Converts and Proselytes have but a painted, p. 15.
Formal Repentance, Faith, etc. only if they can come to their Church, and Thou
and Thee, and disrespect all Superiors, then are they high Saints, and cannot
sin.

Answ. All these be Lies, and it is thy own Condition. And as for the Papists
and Arminians, they may answer for themselves: for Repentance, which is a
Returning from Sin to the Lord, is not Formal, and the Faith, which Jesus
Christ is the Author and Finisher of. And we do not say, Such as can say Thee
and Thou, are free from Sin; neither do we say, that they are High Saints, that
dis-respect all Superiors: for we say as the Apostle said, We must honor all
men; and, They that rule, are worthy of double honor. And we do challenge
thee, and all the Priests in New England, and all our Opposites that thou have
quoted, to show us, Where ever Christ or his Apostles for men to keep on their
Hats, and say Thee and Thou to them, dishonored them, and dis-respected
Superiors? so, the ground of thy Controversy is false. And whether that is the
Honor and the Respect, that they must show to all men, and to Superiors, as to
say You to a single Person, and put off his Hat to him? and whether this be the
Honor from above? and whether the Honor the Pharisees looked for, was not
some Outward Gesture, so distinguished from the Christians Honor? -- And as
for Converts of Cursed Rotten Nature, thou might have kept that at home; for
the Converts that we own, are such as are turned from Darkness to Light, and
from the power of Satan to God.

R. W. And whereas thou say: This was the Heavenly principle of those many
precious gallant Worthies, the Leaders and Corner-Stones of New England, they
desired to worship God in purity, according to those persuasions in their
Consciences, which they believed God had lighted up.

Answ. Here thou flatterest New England Persecutors, who have drunken the Blood
of Gods People, Whipped, Banished, and Spoiled their goods, because they would
not follow their Bloody Spirits Worship out of Truth: for thou might have said
as much for the Spirit of the Church of Rome. For the Professors of New England
have lost their Tenderness, that was first in them, and despised that
Birthright, Esau-like; and their Written and Printed Laws against the People of
God are abhorred, and make their Names stink in Europe, yea, and in America.
For thou will confess, the Devil is a Murderer, and Christ is a Savior, and
did not come to destroy men's Lives, but to save them: and therefore it is
manifest, whose Work thy Gallant Worthies and Leaders have done, and Thou, who
art joined in a Confederacy against God's People, uttering sorth thy Lies
against them in a peaceable Government, where thou have not power to Persecute
them.

R. W. And thou say; They desired such for their Fellow-worshippers, as they
(upon a Christian Account) could have evidence of to be true and real
Worshippers of God in Spirit and Truth also.

Answ. The New-England-worshippers, and the Joyners with them, their Practice
Evidenceth them in their Persecution not to be in God's Spirit nor his Truth.

R. W. And thou bring Priest E. B's. words, which says [The Spirit of God
does not teach to judge before the time] and others say [Saints shall not
judge, while they be upon the Earth.] And G. F. Answering says, [But the
Spirit did teach the Apostle to Judge, and his Time was come; and he told some
that they were of Old ordained for Condemnation, their Damnation slumbred not:
and then it was their time to Judge.] And because the Printer mistook, and put
in [ high] for [ their] and [ not] which should not have been in, but [ then]
which was the Printers mistake, therefore thou cryest Nonsense, etc. But (thou
say) to the point: The great Jugler has taught G. F. and his Foxians to
outface Death and Judgment, to keep the great Sessions, and call all the world
to their Bar and Judgment.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F's. Answer? but
repeating of the Apostles words, that makes him to break out into such an
Outrage and Gust (as he calls it.) Therefore was the Apostle a Cheat, or a
Jugler, and out faced Death and Judgment, etc. because the Spirit of God did
teach him to Judge as before? And as for his terming of us like Mugleton with
his Curses; when a little before in the same page he says, A Cursed Rotten
Nature are the Quakers Converts: and art not thou of the same Spirit as Reeve
and Mu^leton, who have been as great Enemies to the Quakers, as thou art?

R. W. And thou say: It Is true, there is a Lawful judging, not according to
the rashness, or pride (as the Quakers is) but according to the righteous
Judgment. And say, The Spiritual man judges and discerns all things, that
looks into the Cause and Nature of things, Times and Persons: but what is
this to the Natural Death of all Mankind?

Answ. Reader, has G. F. mentioned any thing but the Apostles words? does he
mention the Natural Death of all Mankind? or showed any Rash Judgment here? or
called the World before the Bar of Judgment, as R. W. says, who has puffed out
a great deal of Air about it, and when he has done, he beats it? But it seems
he grants, That the Spiritual Man judges and discerns all things (but who it
is, and where he judges, he has not manifested or declared) and yet he
finds fault with G. F. for saying so ( page 80.) And as for Pride and Rash
Judgment, he might have kept that at home, and not applied it to the Quakers.
And the Apostle said, O Death where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy
Victory? the Sting of Death is Sin, and the strength of Sin is the Law: but
thanks be to God, who has given us the Victory through Jesus Christ.

R. W. And thou say: I know, the Foxians will turn this Scripture, p. 16.
and that Golden Chain, Heb. 6. the first Christian principles and Eternal
Judgment into Mysteries.

Answ. Here again thou wrong'st us. For we own Heb. 6 as it speaks; and we do
believe, they are Mysteries to thy Lying Spirit. For sometimes thou say, we
take them literally; and now thou say we turn them into Mysteries: thus thou
Contradicts thy self.

R. W. And that they now judge the secrets of Men by Paul's Gospel, Romans 2.

Answ. Is there any such word in G. F's. Answer to E. B. Priest? For the
Apostles words are, In the day, when God shall judge the secrets of men by
Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel: and this thou wickedly applyest to the
Quakers out of thy dark, airy mind, and then thou beatest the air.

R. W. And thou say, Therefore by looking on a man (to wit, the Quakers)
they can discern the Inward parts, what each person is.

Answ. The least Child of God may easily discern, what thou art, by what comes
out of thee, what is in thy Inward parts. And does R. W. think, that the Saints
did not know one another hearts, when they were of One heart, mind, and soul,
etc? and were the Epistles of Christ, etc. written not with Ink, but with the
Spirit of the living God in fleshly Tables of the heart? etc. and God that
given his Church a Discerning with the same Spirit in our day, as he did in the
Apostles.

R. W. And thou say: The Lord is no^ come (says Enoch, and Jude) in Ten
Thousand of his Saints; and now is the day appointed, in which God judges the
world by that Man Christ Jesus [ which Man they are] of which the Word of God
has approved, in that they are raised from the dead in souls and bodies to
keep the Eternal Judgment: though thou say, some of their young Scholars
will not believe it; but they spare not to own their High Court of Justice.

Answ. Where did thou ever read in any of the Quakers Books any such
Language, that say, the Quakers are the Man Christ Jesus? this is thy Forgery:
for let the Render see if there be any such word in G. F's. Answer to E.
Bradshaw in thy 15th page? And thou say, They are the Man Christ Jesus (to
wit, the Quakers) but have showed no proof for it: but how can thou make the
Saints to be the Man Christ Jesus? Yet for all thy Lies we cannot deny, that
Christ is in us. and has quickened us, which were dead in Sins and Trespasses
(as Ephesians. 2.) and Christ quickening our mortal bodies by his Spirit, that
dwells in us, Romans 8. and by his Spirit we can judge of such a Spirit as
thine is, by its fruits; whose Spirit is Eternal, which we received from
Christ, which thou Scoffingly call High Court of Justice. And Christ that
rules in the hearts of his Saints, he gives them a Judgment and Discerning to
forsake the Evil, and cleave to the Good.

R. W. And then thou tells a Tale in Hartfordshire, and termest us, Like a
Company of Drunken Sots, that kept a Court there, and had like to have brought
themselves to the Gallows.

Answ. But this may suit thine own and the New England Spirits best, that have
been Drunk with the Blood of the Saints: the Quakers are clear from thy Lies
and Slanders, and they do not touch them. And thou shall know Christ coming to
Judgment; who will reward thee according to thy works.

R. W. Thou say, That the Quakers confess, that Christ was a Real Man, as
any of us, etc. and thou say, They could not give an account, what was
become of him, at Newport.

Answ. There are more of thy Lies. For we tell thee, as we told thee, He is
risen, and at the Right Hand of God, Luke 22, 6, 9. Act. 2, 25, 23. Act. 5, 31.
Act. 7, 35, 36. Romans 8, 34. Ephesians. 1, 20. Col. 3, 1. Heb. 1, 3, 13. Heb. 8, 1.
Heb. 10, 12. 1 Pet. 3, 22. and if thou will not believe those Scriptures, thou will not believe us, where the Man Christ Jesus is: and yet Christ rules in
the hearts of his Saints; and this is a Mystery to thee. And it is like he is
not Come unto thee; for how should he? when thou art so Ignorant of his Light,
which he ligheth every Man that comes into the world withal: for how can any
come to Repentance and be Converted, and hate the Heavenly Light of Christ?

R. W. And then thou runs on, and have proved nothing, and say, That their
Pride, Scornfulness, rash Revilings, rash Cursings, Superstition, new
Inventions, their Blasphemies and Hypocrisies, Inhumanities, Impudencies, etc.
are such --

Answ. This R. W. and his Fellow-Priests might have kept at home; for he has
made a great Noise with words, but nothing signified. Did not the Patience of
the Lambs of Christ manifest otherwise, when they Hanged them, and Burned them,
and Cut off their Ears, and Whipped and Banished them? did they not suffer like
Lambs? What was their Reviling Languages? why did not thou and the Priests
of Boston Print them? for if they had Reviled, it is like we should have heard
of it before now.

R. W. And thou say: -- such, that render them so far from being the High
Saints and Judges of the World, that they fall under the Judgment of all sober
and modest persons.

Answ. Nay Roger, they must be such as thou and the New England Professors are,
that Judge us and not the Modest nor Sober persons neither in Old England nor
New: and thy Judgment and the Persecutors Judgment touches us not. And the
Apostle tells thee, The Saints shall Judge the World. 1 Cor. 6, 3.

R. W. [On G. F's. Answer to T. C.] If God please to appoint the Words the
Apostles used, to be still the Means of Conversion to the end of the World, p.
17.
that then he has thrown out himself? etc.

Answ. What! can any come to Conversion with the words of the Apostles without
the Spirit? may not all the Wolves in the World, false Prophets and
Antichrists get the Sheeps-Cloathing on the Outside, and use their tongue and
say: Thus says the Lord and the Apostle? like R. W. and those that would have
cast out Devils in Christ's and Paul's Name? But does not the Apostle say, He
that has not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his, Romans 8, 9. and therefore
how can any Convert any person with the Apostles words, and they having not the
Spirit of Christ are none of his? I confess, R. W. and the New-England-Priests
may bring them into a Form without the power; from such People are to turn
away, as the Apostle says to Timothy.

R. W. Thou say; Is not this God's Covenant with Christ and all Christians,
that his Word and Spirit should be in their Mouths to all Generations? Woe be to
all these wild, frantic Inferences, which disjoyn and separate, what the
Most-powerful and Wise and Holy has joined together.

Answ. We witness, that the Word and Spirit was, and is, and shall be in the
mouths and hearts (which thou have left out, and can not endure to hear of
it there) of all true Christians to all Generations; but what is this to
Convert People with a Means without the Spirit and the power of Christ in their
hearts to Salvation? But thou think to join the holy Men of God's words with
thy dark Spirit, which were not given forth from it: and wild frantic
Inferences thou may keep at home. And we do not Dis-joyn the Word, nor the
Spirit from the Scriptures; for it will own its own Words, and has Unity with
them, as thou falsely chargest us to Dis-joyn or separate: and all your
Converting of people with the Saints words without the Spirit of Christ in
their hearts, is but to make Proselites like Parishes.

R. W. And thou say: May there not be many Agents employed by one glorious
Efficient? as in Moses building the Tabernacle, etc. and Abraham sending his
Servant to Espouse a Bride to his Son, etc. Does not rather this mad Soul throw
out Abraham and Solomon, etc. yea his own brains (in a mad, proud frolic) all
overboard together?

Answ. Because Moses builded the Tabernacle, and Solomon builded the Temple,
and Abraham did such and such things, and Circumcised, therefore must all
Christians do the same? yea, and without the Spirit, as Moses, and Abraham and
Solomon was in? and thou that art without this Spirit, that they were in, art
in thy Mad frolicks thou speak of, and Throwest thy own Brains overboard,
and not the Quakers, that would have people to be led with the Spirit of Christ
to Conversion; who is the End of Solom^n's Temple, and Moses Tabernacle, and
makes his People his Temple, etc.

R. W. And as for that of Paul telling the Corinthians, that they were Gods
Husbandry and Building, etc. and as thou say, That Paul was a prime
Husbandman, and a Master Builder, etc. and that they were Messengers, and
Co-workers, and Laborers together with God.

Answ. We know this; but it was not without the Spirit of Christ: this was not
Saul, when he was a Literal Professor, like you.

R. W. And Paul Preaching, the Lord opened Lydia's heart; and Philip Preaching,
and the Lord opened the Eunuch's heart: and thou quotest John 14. for Barnabas,
that a great Multitude of Jews and Greeks believed.

Answ. What is all this to the purpose? All that have been, are, or shall be
Converted since the Gospel's Ministration, are Converted by the Apostle's Words
without his Spirit, as thou seem to say, are they? for we know, that Philip,
Paul and Barnabas were in the power and Spirit of God, and able Ministers of
the Spirit. And thou bring John 14. and Barnabas, that A great Multitude,
both of Jews and Greeks believed; and there is no such saying in John 14. for
if G. F. had done so, thou would have cried, Lame, Silly and Nonsense; but
if the Fault was in the Printer, we have so much Charity as to overlook it.
And then thou say; The Lord opened Lydia's heart: Then it is not the
Apostles words without the Spirit. And then thou bring Paul planting, Apollo
watering; which we do believe, with the Spirit of God, and wrought those
Miracles by the power of Jesus: but what is this to Plant or Water with the
Apostles words without the Spirit of Christ? for God gives increase to them
that are in his Spirit.

R. W. And thou say; G. F 's. his throwing God overboard, and his own
Reason and Sense.

Answ. Thou have not proved G. F, throwing out God; this is Blasphemy to say,
That God can be thrown overboard, who have over-thrown thy self. But thou and
the Priests, that would Convert people with the Apostles words, and leave out
the power and Spirit of God, do but beget people into a Form without the power:
and because G. F. says [That they cannot Convert people without the power and
Spirit of God, etc. though they may have the words of the Apostles] and the
Priest says [ That they are Converted by the Words of the Apostles] and G. F.
says [ In this they throw out the Spirit and power of God, by which the
Apostles did Convert] and about this thou make a great Rail against G. F. and
say, G. F. is throwing out God overboard, and his own Reason and Sense; and
yet thou confessest, The Lord opened Lydia's heart, and the Lord opened the
Eunuch's heart: so here thou Contradicts thy self. And we own God and Christ,
and use their Words and the Apostles by the Spirit, that leads into all
Truth, and do succeed them in the Spirit: and so are the Living Stones, and
built up together in the Church of God, which Christ is the Head of.

R. W. Thou say, There have been many Conversions to the Christian Name in
these parts of the world called Christendom: p 18.
and then thou Instancest, These (Conversions) the Papists brag to have
effected in all the 4. parts of the world; and how these were brought^ in
sometimes by the Sword, and sometimes by Marriages, etc.

Answ. How is it you N. England Priests and Professors would Convert the
Quakers? is it not by the same Bloody Way? as Instance, Whips, and Stocks, and
Swords? and are not these the Beast's Horns, and the Whore from the true
Church, and not Christ's Wife?

R. W. Thou tell us of the Waldenses, and Wicklevists, and Hussires in
Bohemia, and Lutherans and Calvinists, etc. that came out from this Bloody
Romish Whore (144000. Virgin Protestants thirsting after the Blood of Christ
only for Salvation.)

Answ. What is all this to R. W's. purpose, That people should be Converted
with the Apostles words, and leave out the power and Spirit of Christ,
according to G. F's. words to T. C? And Roger, why do thou cry out against
the Romish Bloody Whore, when thou and the New-England-Spirits, that thou
Commendest, are the same? for, where did ever Wickl^ff and Hus^ Hang any, or
Cut off the Ears of any, as your N. England Professors have done? And you that
would have us punished, are you like Virgin-Protestants, who thirst after the
Blood of Christ for Salvation? what! can you both thirst after the Blood of
Christ and after the Blood of his people, as the New England Priests have done?

R. W. And thou say, The Father of Spirits has stirred up some Witnesses in
all Protestant-Nations, to Preach against Formal, National Conversions, and
against the Formality and Profaneness of the common Protestants.

Answ. Then why art thou against G. F's declaring against Conversions without
the Spirit of Christ, and power of God, as he does to T. C? have not thou all
along been Contradicting thy self? and fightest against that which thou here
professest, like a blind Man, or one that doteth? And wast not thou Bragging a
little before of the Church in New England? and now thou tell of the Papists
bragging? and are not all these (thou speak of) Formal Conversions, brought
into the words without the Spirit and power? for there is no true Conversion,
nor Translation, but from Death to Life; and that is by the same power and
Spirit of Christ, that the Apostles were in, and the Church in the Primitive
Times.

R. W. And thou say: The Formality and Profaneness of the Common
Protestants ( all one in Life, and sometimes worse than the Papists) etc.

Answ. Roger, thou and the New-England-Priests and Professors may take it, and
apply it at home, and see, if you can find a place of Repentance; for yet you
hate to be Reproved. -- And as for the One hundred-forty-four-thousand spoken
of in the Revel., that sung the New Song, etc. which no man could learn, etc.
which were Undefiled, etc. which were Redeemed from the Earth, and which
followed the Lamb, etc. is R. W. and the New-England-Priests, and our Opposites
(that he brings) like unto these in the Lamb's Spirit? no such matter: for if
they were, they would not Persecute, Imprison us, and Cut off our Ears for
Visiting our Friends in the Prisons, and not bowing the Knee, and the Hat, and
saying You to them; and Persecute us, because we could not put in their mouths,
and give them Maintenance. So, here they manifest, that they are of the Earth,
and of the Bloody Whore that R. W. speaks of: so, they are not of their
Purity (which is spoken of in Revelations) neither in Life, nor Doctrine, nor
Worship, nor Church, nor follow not the Lamb, who says, Freely ye have
Received, freely Give.

R. W. Thou say (after thou have told a Story of the Jesuits) The
Pharisees, p. 19.
who by Land and Sea sent forth their Emissaries to make Converts to God, etc.

Answ. Is not this your own Work? seeing that G.F. says, Th. Coll. has thrown
out the Spirit and power of Christ, which is to Regenerate and Convert; and
say, That you can no more Convert by the Apostles Words, then the Pharisees
without the Spirit of God, and Power of Christ, that the Apostles were in? and
yet thou railest against G. F. for saying so. But have not thou Contradicted
thy self in saying, How the Pharisees Converted? when they in their Conversion
opposed Christ the Light?

R. W. Thou say, That Christ sent forth his Messengers with Glad News of a
New Bargain or Covenant of God with the Sons of men, viz. It pleased the God of
Heaven not to be thrown out ( as this Fox frantickly barks) etc.

Answ. Where does G. F. say (if it be him thou meanest) That God did throw out
his Apostles or Messengers with the New Covenant and Glad Tidings, which Christ
sent forth? And have not thou been barking against Papists and Pharisees, and
Formal Professors Converts? and are not they brought into a Form of the
Apostles words without the power? and into a Profession of Christ without the
Possession of him, like you Priests and Professors of New England? And G. F.
says; The true Conversion is by the power and Spirit of Christ, [which T. C.
leaves out] and so, do thou not see how thou Contradicts thy self? for were
these Virgins (thou speak of) Converted with the Apostles words without the
Spirit and power of Christ? Dare any of the New-England-Priests or professors,
or R. W. say, That you are sent out Immediately by Christ, as the Apostles
were? nay, Priests will say, They have No Call to this work to go Freely: but
they would find a Call to great Benefices.

R. W. And thou say: For slighting of this Pearl of this Glad News or Gospel
pub^ished by God to the world by Writing, or Preaching, Professing, Suffering,
etc.

Answ. This is from a false Birth: for we slight not the writings of the
Gospel, etc. nor the Preaching, Professing and Sufferings of the Apostles, but
receive them with Joy in the Spirit of God; etc. But it is you that slight
them, that do not Obey them, and persecute with Tongue and Hand them that do
obey them.

R. W. And thou say: It has pleased his Infinite Justice to Plough the
world with Popery, a Religion (a Bastard-Christianity) suited, etc.

Answ. Look thou and the New England-Priests at home, and shake hands with them
Roger: and let New England read their Laws, and read thy Book and theirs, and
see, if you have not Ploughed worse then they these late years.

R. W. And as for thy saying (A Bastard-Christianity) suited (as the Quakers
is) to Rotten Nature, and sit to carry the world after them, as Mahomet and the
Pope have done.

Answ. Nay Roger, you in New England have the Weapons, as the Pope and Mahomet
have in your Rotten Nature, your practice plainly declares it. For the Quakers
Weapons are Spiritual and not Carnal; and therefore thou do abuse them,
though it does not touch them.

R. W. And thou tells of Two great Worders in the world ( pretending to be
Christ's Messengers to the Nations) the Jesuits and the Quakers: their faces
look diverse, but they both carry Firebrarnds in there Tails, to burn up the holy
Scripture, all truly holy Christians, etc. and thou say, We are like Absalom
Beautiful, and fit to play Soul-Thieves, and steal the hearts, etc. from the
true David, the Lord Jesus Christ.

Answ. Thou might have kept a great part of this at home, for we do abhor
thy Lies. For whom have we wronged? or whom have we Burnt? except it be the
Fire of God's Word that is Entered among you, and burns your Esau. stuff. And
as for Burning the Scriptures, we abhor thy words: and did not thou say, The
Papists Owned the Bible, and the Jews part of it? and now thou fay'st, They
Burn it? how do thou Contradict thy self! But Gods Living Free Messengers we
have been to New England, etc. but you have Spoiled our Goods, Banished, Whipped
and Martyred to death, and Burnt our Books, which quote a many good Scriptures.
And as for Absolom's Beauty, you may look at home among your Whited Walls, and
fair Outside Professors: but they begin to look black with your Murdering
Laws. And it is thy own Spirit's work to draw Souls from the Lord Jesus Christ
with thy Lies, as the Old Serpent drew Adam and Eve from God's Teaching: and
you exceed Sampsons Foxes, that carried Firebrarnds in their Tails, for you
have Carried them in your Hands, by which you have Branded the people of God.
And we do Esteem the Scriptures, and the Practice of them better then you.

R. W. And thou say: They are fortified with the Faces of Men, and the Hair
of Women, like the Locusts, Rev. 9. such Pretenses, and such Illuminations, and
Appearances, and Assurances, and Confidences, and Feelings of Experiences, etc.
that it is God's Infinite Power and Wisdom, etc. to preserve the Scriptures a
Standing Record, of what the first Messengers and Churches, and first Doctrine,
and first Christians were; or else the world would fall down and adore Images,
etc.

Answ. It is by the Lord's Power and Wisdom, that the Scripture has been
preserved; yet we see such that have the Scriptures, and fall down to Images,
and others to the Imaginations of their own hearts, that are not in the Spirit,
that gave them forth. And as for those Locusts, that came out of the smoke of
the Bottomless-pit let R. Williams and the New England Professors keep that at
home, and apply it and their Experiences at home: but as for the people called
Quakers, it is that, which the Lord has wrought in them by his Spirit, and
opened to them by believing in the Light; that so they are become Children of
the Light, which you were and are Strangers to, and hate. And God has Sealed
us, and set his Mark in our Foreheads: but your Mark is easily seen to be of
the Beast's, that makes War with the Saints. And did Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob fall down to Images, before Scripture was written? for, as the Apostle
says, None can call Jesus Lord, but by the Holy Ghost: and though some people
have the Scriptures, yet they fall down to Images. But it is the Holy Ghost,
that brings them to fall down to God, and bow to Jesus their Lord, that leads
them into all the Truth of the Scriptures, that brought the Prophets and
Apostles to testify against them that Bowed to Images; yea, though they had
the Scriptures* as in the days of Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and other Prophets.
And our Experiences and Assurances are of the Lords Christ.

R. W. And thou say: Thou know, the Counsels of the Father of Lights are
very deep; yea, the Revelation needs a Revelation, and the Prophets, and
Canticles, and Daniel, etc.

Answ. And thou confessest, this must be by the Spirit of God, etc. and in this
thou confounds thy self, who have been Railing against G. F. and the Quakers,
who says: T. C. has left cut the power and Spirit of God to Regenerate and
Convert, and that the Scriptures cannot do this without the Spirit or power of
Christ; and that it is the Spirit, that does Convert both Jews and Gentiles to
God: and this is the Quakers principle, according to Christ's words; I will send
you the Spirit of Truth, that will lead you into all Truth: as you may see in
John. And so it is all this while, thou have been Confounding thy self, and
Beating the Air.

R. W. And whereas thou speak, How that Jews and Gentiles must yet enquire
with Tears of Blood after the Blood of a Savior: p. 20.
sure they shall not awake out of their pits of Rottenness without some Means
and Messengers, etc.

Answ. And yet these have the Scriptures, and are not Converted: and yet thou
railest against G. F. because he says, They cannot be Converted and
Regenerated by the words of the Apostles, but by the power and Spirit of God;
and because that G.F. says, That I.K. in saying [The Scripture is the Means]
he throws out Christ and God, the Author and Giver of Faith (as page 9). Yet
now R. W. says, There must be a Messenger from Heaven to awaken Jews and
Gentiles; surely, this must be a Spiritual Messenger then: and here he
Contradicts himself, and throws down all his Railing stuff against G. F. as
aforementioned. And yet There is no Voice and Motion to be heard of Spiritual
things within?

R. W. And thou say: Surely, there shall be no other Words in their Mouths,
then what were in the Mouths of the first Messengers, and according to Christ's
prayer, etc.

Answ. We answer, Nay; The very same Word and Words, both in thy and your
Mouths, when you are Converted (if ever you be Converted) which now thou have a
Form of without the power; and Hold the Truth in the Unrighteousness: and so
that in John 17. and Isa. 59. and Act. 26. we own. And the Apostles which
Preached Christ Jesus, said no other Words, then what Moses and the Prophets
foretold, Act. 26. That Jesus Christ should come according to the Prophets:
and He is come, and has given us an Understanding, and we are in him.

R. W. And thou say: Therefore Fox and his Foxians, that tell us, They have
all by the Spirit, and need no Record, are Thieves and Robbers, whom Moses and
the Prophets, etc. and the Apostles abhorred to think of.

Answ. Moses and the Prophets were led by the Spirit of God, and saw Christ,
who fulfilled the Scriptures of the Prophets, etc. and the Apostle said: No man
knew the things of God, but by the Spirit of God: are not the Scriptures the
Things of God? And why do thou belie G. F. and the Quakers (if it be them
thou meanest) and say, that they say, They need no Record? which is false:
for There are Three, that bear Record in Earth, and Three, that bear Record in
Heaven, which they have need of. And there is a Record of the Son of God, and
there is a Record of John concerning Christ: John bore Record, saying, I saw
the Spirit descending from Heaven upon Christ, Joh. 1, 32, 34. and the Father
bore Record of the Son, Joh. 8. and God is the Record of his people, Phil. 8.
Joh. 1, 5, 7. And there is a Record of the Old and New Testament, which we have
the Comfort of: for we never read, that either Moses, the Prophets or Apostles
did abhor the Spirit of God to be their Leader, and call them Thieves and
Robbers: but those are Thieves and Robbers that do not hear the Voice of
Christ, but climb up another way to know the Scriptures, then by the Light and
Spirit of Christ.

R. W. And thou bring I. Deacon, who says [ The Enjoyment of Immortality is
not, till they have put off this body: G.F. 's Fol. page 40.] And G. F.
Answers, That [ Immortality was brought to Light through the Gospel, and the
Word of God: and Christ was in them, and was not that Immortal? And the Apostle
says: -- Christ Jesus, who has abolished Death, and has brought Life and
Immortality to Light through the Gospel, 2 Timothy 1.10.] -- R. W. (Upon G. F's.
words) says: That G. F. affirms an Immortality (that is, A Not-dying of the
Soul and Body.)

Answ. Now, let the Reader see, if he have not abused G. F's. words? and
whether he says any such thing, or no? for Christ says: They cannot kill the
Soul, though they may kill the Body. Yet R.W. says again, that the Quakers and
others say, All flesh is grass (speaking of the body) and yet he says, that G.
F. affirms, The Body cannot dye: what Contradictions are these R. W?

R. W. And whereas thou say: As for the Body, the Quakers say, When the Soul
is gone into God ( yea, the Soul of Judas, as well as the Soul of Peter, as
some of them say,) etc.

Answ. But what some of them are, thou have not quoted; though over and over
thou maliciously speak this in thy Book. Neither do I believe, that ever
thou heard any of them say so (may be, some Ranters said so, which he Fathereth
upon the Quakers,) for if thou had, thou would have quoted the Book, or
have named their Names, as thou have done G. F's. and belyest his words:
therefore we have good ground to believe thou wrongest others. And thou usest
many words to no purpose, about that what others say.

R. W. And thou say: -- Whatever these Foxians brutishly fancy of no
distinction between God and themselves, p. 21.
their Light and his, etc.

Answ. This is a False Charge. For we make a Distinction betwixt God and our
selves; for by his Gospel and Power Life and Immortality is brought to Light in
us, by which we see over the Devil, that has darkened us: so, In the Light of
Christ we see Light.

R. W. And thou confessest, That Christ has brought Life and Immortality to
Light through the Gospel [In this thou contradictest I. D. the Priest] and
say, But this is but the joyful Condition of the Souls and Bodies of the
Godly, their Souls and Bodies raised up with Jesus to a spiritual holy Life in
this world, and the Souls going to Jesus, and their Bodies sleeping in Jesus,
etc.

Answ. Here thou have made a pretty good Confession in words, if thou knew,
what thou say. But how do thou mean, when thou say, The Body sleeps
in Jesus; and yet, It turns to Rottenness? does that which sleeps in Jesus,
Rot? And the Apostle says: Thou Fool, that which thou sowest, is not quickened,
except it dye: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that Body, which
shall be, etc. but God gives it a Body, as it pleases him, 1 Corinthians 15. Thou
confessest, That Life and Immortality is brought to Light through the Gospel;
and because G. F. says so, thou say, He affirms an Immortality, that is, a
Not-dying of the Soul and Body: The Soul is Immortal; but G. F. does not speak
of the Body there.

R. W. says: As to this Immortality of G. F. all that can be known of his
mind, is H. Nichol's and the Nicolaitans mad fictions and fancies of their
becoming God and Christ.

Answ. Reader, see, if there be any such words in G. F's Answer to I. D. that
he should number us with the Nicholaitans mad fictions and fancies, as he
calls it; he had had better to have kept it at home, if this be his Charity.
And this Love, that he has to some of us, is not like the Love, that David had
to Absalom, but more like Ahitophel's, (which thou speak of) who neither
Loved David nor Christ Jesus; this Spirit of thine cannot in Sincerity, that
has spoken so Evil of God's people.

R. W. And thou say: I fear, instead of their fancied Immortality before the
Grave, they will meet with a dreadful Mortality, or Death of Soul and Body to
all Eternity.

Answ. This thou fear not for good, as thy words do manifest in thy 119.
page. Here R.W confesses Immortality in this Life; and yet he denies it unto
us.
But do thou not say before, That the Souls of the Godly, going to Christ
Jesus, etc. and now do thou fear, the Souls of the People of God, called
Quakers, shall meet with a Dreadful Mortality, or Death of Soul and Body to
Eternity? It Is like thou would have it so: but we tell thee, and all our
Envious Persecutors with tongue and hand, That Christ has brought Life and
Immortality to Light through the Gospel; and our Souls rejoice in him, and can
magnify God our Savior, blessed be his Name for ever, Hallelujah! But Roger
Williams, take heed, that which thou fear of the Quakers, come not upon thy
self; for it will be much, if it do not, for thou will find Misery, before thou
dye, for thy hard speeches against God's People.

R.W. And thou bring'st I. M. which says [ The wise Heathen- Philosophers had
a greater measure of Light in them (which is the first Adam) then I can think
any man has now.] --

And G.F. Answers [Which shows, that he knows nothing of Christ, the
Second Adam, the Quickening Spirit. He knows no New Creature; for they, who
are in Chirst, are New Creatures: nor None of Christ the Covenant of God, of
Light, of Life, of Peace, who was Glorified with the Father, before the world
began; which is beyond the first Adam: and has shut himself forth, not to be
as high as his Heathen-Philosophers. And many witness Christ In them, in this
Age, as in the days of the Apostles; which is above the Heathen-Philosophers.]
-- And R. W. replyeth to G. F. and says: It pleased God (in all Ages) to stir
up the spirits of some Men (as the Philosophers amongst the Greeks, etc.) to
improve that Excellent Light of Reason etc. above other men.

Answ. What is this to the Light of Christ, in Opposition to the Second Adam in
this Age?

R. W. And thou say, The Question then follows: If this Light of Knowledge
were Christ, p. 22.
as God, and King, and Mediator, why is it, that None of these Excellent men
knew Nothing of God, nor Christ, nor Spirit, etc. but only of the first
Creation? Can such a Court be kept, a Palace furnished, and such Royal and
Heavenly Guests be Entertained, and no body know any thing of it? etc.

Answ. What are all these words to the purpose, but that thou grantest I.M's.
Argument, That the Wise Heathen- Philosophers had a greater Light ( which is
the first Adam) then you, or any man can have by the Second Adam? if not, why
do thou Oppose G. F? And thou confessest, that All Jerusalem was moved, and
on an uproar, when Christ was born, or came to Jerusalem: and does not the
Apostle bid the Saints, Beware of Philosophy? etc. And the Apostle says also:
Certain of your Poets have said, that we are of his Offspring ( to wit, God's)
and Act. 17. Then certain Philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics
encountered with Paul, and some said; What will this Babbler say? and others
said, He seems to be a Setter-forth of strange Gods, because he preached
Christ Jesus and his Resurrection: Now, if R. W. and I. M. have no more
Knowledge of Christ, then these Philosophers, etc. in their Light of their
Carnal Reasoning, (which was Darkness to the Light of Christ) they may give
over talking of Christ. And these knew not God, nor Christ as King and
Mediator, which is known by his own Light: and such Philosophers or others, if
they did Know God or Christ, it was by his own Light. For that which G. F. does
affirm, is true, as concerning of Christ and their Knowledge in the
New Covenant: and Christ Enlightneth every man, that comes into the world, as
he is the Word, God. And the Spirit of man being the Candle of the Lord, he
Enlightneth their Spirit, their Candle, by which they might see him, as he is:
and as Christ says, No man knows the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the
Son Reveals him, etc.

R. W. Thou say: The utmost Reason of these Excellent Men (to wit, the
Philosophers) it is known I say, that the Activity of the highest Reason in
this world falls short in two grand particulars. (And thou say) 1. As to
the Creatures: for some of them must needs fall short, when Plato granted a
Creation, and a kind of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the Creation of it.
Aristotle pretends to see further then Plato and all his Arguments, and
Asserteth, The World to have no Beginning nor Ending.

Answ. What must we Infer from this, but that thou set up the Knowledge of
the Philosophers above thy own and others, and maintainest I.M's. Principles
and his Doctrine [That the wise Heathen- Philosophers had a greater measure of
Light in them, ( which is the first Adam) then I can think any man has now,
says I.M.] And are not these Philosophers contrary to Moses in Genesis, who
said, In the Beginning God Created the Heavens and the Earth? and thy
Philosophers, that thou bring, say, That the World had No Beginning nor
Ending, etc. and does not this oppose Christ's words? and 2 Timothy 9. Before the
World began? and Tit. 1, 2. Before the World began? And Christ says, The
Harvest is the End of the World, Math. 13, 39, 40. Math. 24, 21. Since the
World began. Now, let R. W. and the Philosophers read these Scriptures, and see
what work they are making about their great Knowledge? but if any of them did
know the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, they knew it by the Spirit,
and had it by Revelation, as some of the Heathen had: but it is very like, that
Many of the Heathen- Philosophers had more knowledge in the Creation, then R.
Williams. -- And then thou go on and tellest what the Philosophers say of
the Sun, and of the Globe, etc. but we tell thee, the Scriptures are a better
Book, then their Books concerning God and his Son, and his Creation.

R. W. And that which Paul speaks, Romans 1. thou say, That by the Creation
some come to know, there is an Eternal Power and Godhead: and thou say,
that Paul tells us, the World by wisdom knew not God, which must he Expounded (
or else swallow a Contradiction, as the Quakers guise is), etc.

Answ. Thou can hardly speak without Railing. For these Scriptures (1 Cor.
1. and Romans 1) need no Expounding; for they are plain, as they speak: for its
true, That the world by their wisdom knew not God. Some knew the Eternal Power
and Godhead: for the Apostle says, Because that which may be known of God, is
manifest in them, for God has showed it unto them; though they glorified not
God, etc: so with This of God in them, which God had showed unto them, they
knew Him, and his God head and his Creation, Rom, 1, 19, 20. So, the Guise thou
may apply to thy self, who have lest out That of God, which he has showed
unto people, who was their Teacher. Are these the wise Philosophers of R. W.
and I. M. that have more Light then any man now, that say, The world has No
Beginning nor Ending? and is this your Court and Palace furnished with such
Heavenly guests? etc. but to know God and Jesus Christ, that he has sent, is
Eternal Life. And then thou confesses, That a Natural man cannot perceive the
things of God; and yet, The Philosophers had a greater measure of Light, then
any man now?

R. W. And thou say, Yet this Foolish man makes every man's heart in the
world a Court of Heaven, p. 23.
a thing which all men may abhor to think of: and yet thou confessest, That
there is that of God in the Children of Disobedience and Reprobates. ( Appen.
p. 5)

Answ. But let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F's Answer to
I. M. as, The Court of Heaven is in every man's heart? But for all R. W's.
Railing, we cannot deny Christ's Doctrine, who said, The Kingdom of Heaven was
in the Pharisees: and Christ enligteth every man, that comes into the world,
Joh* 1. And it is very like, thou do Abhor to hear or think of this, whose
Foolish heart is darkened, and thy Wisdom is Enmity, hating God himself, as the
Scripture concludes, which thou may apply to thy self. Yet we believe,
Christ has enlightened thee, which will to be the Condemnation of them that
hate it.

R. W. Thou say: Moses built the Tabernacle, and Noah the Ark, and Solomon
the Temple, etc. which thou confessest, were the gifts of God to them. Then
thou call them the Excellent gifts of Nature, that reach not Heavenly and
Spiritual things, and say, What are all these to the Enlightening of my soul
with my Natural, Undone and Damned Condition? to a sight of Sin as Sin? etc.

Answ. Noah by Faith builded the Ark (as in Hebrews) and Moses saw Christ the
great Prophet; and God spoke to Solomon and David, who saw Christ, and called
him Lord: and if thou do confess, that this was a Knowledge beyond the
Heathen- Philosophers, yea, and such as said, The world had neither Beginning
nor Ending, then thou have overthrown thy own words, which thou have been
opposing G. F. withal. And was it by a Natural gift, that Noah built the Ark,
and Moses the Tabernacle, and Solomon the Temple? was it not by the Faith and
Command of God? were these done with Natural parts and good Education, as thou
speak of? how dark art thou in the Scripture! -- And the Temple, and the
Ark, etc. were Figures of the things of the Law, which Christ is the substance
of, who enligh^^eth every man, that comes into the world: and thou art as dark
about Christ, that enlightneth every one that comes into the world, as thou
art about the Temple, who call them Excellent Natural gifts in Noah, Moses
and Solomon.

R. W. And thou go on, and say, What are those to a sight of my utter
Inability to pay (or all the Creation for me) one farthing to God's Justice,
etc?

Answ. It Is Christ, that has Shed his Blood, and Tasted Death for all men, and
Enlightens all men; and he is above the Heathen Philosophers in the first Adam:
and so, all must believe in him the Light, (who has enlightened them) for Life
and Salvation. And many more slighting words there are in thy pretended Answer,
which are not worth mentioning. And how do thou Magnify the Gifts of God to
many, whom thou say, neither thou nor G. F. is worthy to hold the Candle to;
when thou art setting up the Wisdom of the Heathen- Philosophers, with the
Light in them ( which is the first Adam) above, then any man has now (as I. M.
thinks)? And what is this to know Christ and the New Creature, and he the
Quickening Spirit, and the New Covenant? for they that Magnify Christ, will do
as John did, Bear witness to Christ, who enlightens every man that comes into
the world.

R. W. And thou say: Who knows not, how full the world is of Admirable men
and women, that are not Christians? and yet what a base Esteem has this proud
Spirit of all men, yea, of all Christians too, that dance not after his foolish
pipe, etc.

Answ. Here thou abusest G. F. and the Quakers again (if it be them thou
meanest) who hold forth the Universal Love of God to all Mankind through
Christ Jesus, who shed his Blood and dyed for all, and enlightens all, and his
Grace has appeared to all: and we exhort them to Believe in the Light, that
they may become Children of the Light. And the Grace of God will teach them,
and bring their Salvation, if they do not turn it unto Wantonness: and do
thou call this sound Doctrine Foolish Pipe?

R. W. And whereas thou bring I. M's. words [ The Prophets are more certain,
then any other Revelation.] And G. F. Answers [Was not the Son of God Revealed?
p. 24.
etc. and did not he Come in the Volumn of the Book to do the will of God? and
so they that had the Prophets and the Law (to wit, the Jews) knew not the Son,
etc.] And R. W. Answers and says, To pass by G. F*s. Un-English and
Nonsense, etc.

Answ. It Is like, this may be Nonsense to him, though there may be some fault
in the Printer; but Charity would have past this by, as I have often done in R.
W.'s. Book.

R. W. And thou say, that G. F. knows not, that the Question is not here,
whether Christ be the End of the Law and the Prophets? etc. and whether Christ
was not more Revealed at his coming? etc: but whether the Written Word of the
Prophets, of which Peter speaks, be not a more sure word of Command and
Comfort to us, then any now to be expected? etc.

Answ. I. M. says, The Prophets are more certain, then any other Revelation;
and what is this to R. W's Questions? And I say, Christ being revealed, which
is the End of the Prophets and the Law, etc. He is a More and a Certain
Revelation, etc. for he is the Salvation and the Foundation that the Law Typed
forth, and the Prophets Prophesied of; for he is the Substance. For many may
have the Law and the Prophets in words, as the Jews had, and not receive the
great Revelation of Christ Jesus: and many have the New Testament of the
Apostles and Christ; but Christ says plainly, None knows the Father, but the
Son, and to whom he Reveals him, though they may have the Prophets, like
Jews, and know him not. -- But thou say: But whether the Written words of
the Prophets, of which Peter speaks, be not a more sure word of Command and
Comfort to us, then any now can be expected? What is this to the Revelation of
the Son of God? And thou wrongest Peter's words; for Peter says also: We have
a more sure word of Prophecy, (not of the Prophets, as thou have thrust in)
whereunto you do well, that you take heed unto, as unto a Light that shines in
a dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day Star arise in your hearts. And is
this Sure word of the Prophets of Command and Comfort to you, more then any can
be expected? what! do thou not own Christ the End of the Prophets, a greater
Comfort and a Revelation then the Prophets, who is the Foundation of the
Prophets and Apostles? But what dark place is this, that the Light shines in,
that people must take heed unto, until the day dawn, and the Day Star arise in
their hearts? for we say, that all the Prophets of God did foretell of Christ,
which the Apostles and Peter preached, Christ the Fulfilling of them, praised
be his Name for ever!

R. W. And thou say, That God called his Mind his Word, his works his Word,
his writings his Word, and his Providence of Mercy and Judgment his Word in a
way of Condescension to our Capacity, etc: And this thou comparest with Rulers
and Masters of Ships word, etc. or Records and Deeds with Hands and Seals, etc.
And then thou say, The word of God in the mouths of the Prophets, written
for after-generations, etc. and then thou tellest, that the Jews have their
Talmud, and The Turks their Alcoran, and the Pope his Decretals, and the
Protestants the Written Word or Scriptures.

Answ. Thou have made many Words here, if God's Work (his Creation, etc.) be
his Word, and if Scriptures (which signifies Writings) be his Word: and thou
confessest, the Word was in the Prophets; which is true, none opposes that.
But the Scriptures of Truth are called the Words of God (as Exodus 20. and in
the Revelations) and Christ calls them Words, Joh. 5, 47. And if any man hear
my Words, Joh. 12, 47, 48. 14, 23. -- John 15, 7. My Words abide in you: Jer.
5, 14. I will make my Words in thy mouth fire. Isa. 51, 16. I will put my Words
in thy mouth. And Job. 42, 7. After the Lord had spoken all these Words. So
here you may see, they are called the Words of the Lord; and Christ's Name is
called the Word of God. Now the Apostle says, Through Faith we understand,
that the worlds were framed by the Word of God; but where does R. W. prove,
that God's Works are called his Word? he has given no Scripture for this. And
why do the Schoolmasters make Books for Children, and tell them, that
Scriptures signifies Writings (as in the English Schoolmaster, and other
Books)? and you say, They are the Word, and give them the Title, that belongs
to Christ: and why cannot you give them the Title, that the Holy Men of God
gave to them, which gave them forth, who called them the Holy Scriptures of
Truth? And thou need not tell us, What the Pope, and the Jews and the Turk
have: and the Jews had the Scriptures of Moses and the Prophets, but would not
receive Christ the Word.

R. W. And thou tellest of a written Pardon, sealed with a broad Seal of a King
or State, p. 25.
and say; What a fancy is it for a Condemned wretch first to hearken to a
Pardon within, to a King within, a Writing within, a Seal within, and to slight
the true Pardon in the King's way to be Conveyed from without to the Mind and
Spirit within? and to lose his pardon and deliverance, as thousands of poor
cheated souls must do.

Answ. The King's written Pardon to Condemned men sets them free, but the
Written in Scripture does no^ set men free, nor Pardons men's Sins and
Trespasses: but it is Christ, that dyed for their sins, and shed his Blood for
them; and this the Scriptures testify of, that he has purchased them with his
Blood, and he is the Offering for Sin. And if the written Scripture be the
Pardon of Sin of the Condemned World, as the King's written Pardon is for
Condemned persons, then all that have the Scripture, have their Pardon by thy
meaning: but page 64. thou say, The Scriptures avail nothing, without the
Spirit of God set it home upon us; so here thou contradicts thy self. And
Christ says, Search the Scriptures, for they testify of me, and in them you
think to have Eternal Life, but you will not come to me, that you might have
Life. So the Life is in Christ, and he that has Christ, has Life; and they
that have not him, have not Life: and they that have not the Spirit of Christ,
are none of his, though they may have the Scriptures. And they who had their
Garments made white, it was by the Blood of the Lamb, and not by written
Pardons: and they that are the true Believers in Christ the Light, and are in
the New Covenant, as Heb. 8. he blotteth out their Sins and Trespasses, in whom
God writes his Law in their hearts. And 1 Cor. 15, 3. Christ dyed for our Sins
according to the Scripture: so it is not a written Pardon, though the
Scriptures declare this. And Christ dyed for the Ungodly, Romans 5, 6. Christ
dyed for us, 1 These. 5, 10: So he it is that Pardons. And the Apostle said,
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all Acceptance, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save Sinners, of whom I am chief, 1 Timothy 1, 15. so it is
God and Christ, that does Pardon and Forgive Sin, Col. 2, 13, and Luke 5, 20:
and they that witness this, their Sins are forgiven them. For the true
Believers are Sealed with the Spirit of God (and the Spirit of God is within)
and hear the Voice of Christ their Shepherd, Thy sins are forgiven thee; and so
have their Testimony of pardon within: and so come to be built upon Christ the
Rock and Foundation. So it is one thing to have the Writings, and another thing
to have the Seal of the Spirit of Christ, as they had that gave forth the
Scriptures: and they that are Sealed with it, have the comfort of God and
Christ, and the comfort of the Scriptures, etc.

R. W. And thou bring'st R. H. which says [ It is against the Light of Nature
for Women to preach, etc.] And G. F. Answers R. H. and says [Contrary to the
Apostle's Doctrine, and the mind of God and the Prophets, who said, God would
pour out of his Spirit upon All Flesh, and his Sons and Daughters should
prophecy. So that he is a Limiter of the Holy One, and a Quencher of the
Spirit, and in Darkness: and this is above the Light of Nature.] And R. W.
Replyeth and says, What is the Light of Nature, but that Light, in which every
man comes into the world with ( as the Quakers speak) which differs from the
Light of Beasts, etc.

Answ. What is this to G. F's. Answer? for G. F. and the People of God in Scorn
called Quakers (which thou in Scorn call Foxians) do not say, That the true
Light, which is the Life in the Word, which enlightneth every man that comes
into the world (which is a Light to be revealed to the Gentiles, as Simeon
speaks) is a Natural Light, or Light of Nature. For this is the Supernatural
and Light from Heaven, which John speaks of in the Scripture; and as God
said, I will give him for a Covenant, and a Light to the Gentiles, and he shall
be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth: and where does John or the Apostles
call the true Light (which is Life in the Word, which Lights every man that
comes into the world) a Natural Light or Light of Nature? And then thou go
on, and tellest a great Tale of the Natural Light in man, which is nothing to
the purpose to G. F's Answer.

R. W. And then thou say; It Is true, that in Religious and Christian matters
there is no respect of persons with God, p. 26.
as of man before the woman: otherwise then to Order Natural and Civil. And
thou say: It Is true, the Wisdom of God prefers some Women before
thousands of men, etc. as Lady Jane and Q. Elizabeth, etc. And (thou say)
Christ appearing to Mary Magdalen, and other Women, and sending them to carry
the first Tidings of his Resurrection to his Apostles, etc. and Mirjam and
Huldah, etc. Prophesying before Christ's coming: and at his coming ( according
to Joels Prophecy) his Spirit on his Daughters as well as his Sons, etc. and
yet this favor of God toward Women destroys not the Order, which the God of
Order or Nature has set in those Bounds, Limits and Distinctions between Male
and Female, etc. Though the Holy Scripture were silent, yet Reason and
Experience tells us, that the Woman is the weaker Vessel, that she is more
fitted to keep and order her House, etc. And the Lord has given a Covering of
longer hair to Wom^n, as a sign of covering Modesty and Bastfulness, Silence
and Retiredness, and therefore not so fitted for Manly Actions and Employments.

Answ. Here does not R. W. contradict himself? Though the Apostle does say,
That the Woman is the weaker Vessel; and it is so known: yet is not Christ and
his Spirit as strong in the Female, as he is in the Male? For thou say,
There is no respect of persons with God, as the Man before the Woman; and God
prefers some Women before thousands of Men, as Lady Jane and Q. Elizabeth,
and Deborah: and yet thou say, Women are not so fitted for Manly Actions and
Employments; These were Manly Actions, and Godly of Q. Elizabeth and Deborah.
etc. And then thou say^st, She being the weaker Vessel, she is more fit to keep
and order her House and Children, etc, in Silence and Retiredness, etc. but in
this thou confoundest thy self; for these were Fitted with Manly Actions: and
Mary Magdalen, and other Women that first declared the Tidings of the
Resurrection of Christ to his Apostles, those were Godly Actions. Neither was
Mirjam and Huldah forbidden in the time of the Prophets, nor Philip's four
Daughters in the time of the Gospel; neither did any say to them (as R. H.
does) It was against the Light of Nature for Women to Preach. And the Spirit of
God, by which these Famous Women were led then and now, does keep Gods Order
and Distinction in the Sex of Male and Female; and they know a time to speak,
and a time to be silent: and it teaches them Modesty, and to know the Fruits
of the good Spirit, which leads them to Prophecy.

R. W. And thou say, Therefore, because of Joels Prophecy, or be^cause we
must not limit or quench the Spirit, as G. F. says, there is no ground in Gods
ordinary course of Nature to permit Women to pretend to be Apostles and
Messengers to the Nations, or Preachers and Teachers in the public Assemblies.

Answ. And Reader see, if he has not abused G. F's. words, who brings the
Apostle's, and the Holy Men's Doctrine. I say, All those that Quench the Spirit,
and hate the Light of Christ, and have the Form of Godliness, and deny the
power, they are to be turned away from; they are not Fit to preach neither in
Nations, nor in public Assemblies: but those that are led by the Spirit of
God, Male or Female, are not to be Limited and Quenched. -- And were not Mirjam
and Huldah Prophets in the Assembly? and to whom did Philip's four Daughters
Prophecy? and did not Mary Magdalen Preach Christ's Resurrection to the
Assembly of the Apostles. And the Apostle says, Every Woman that Prays and
Prophesies with her head Covered, etc: where did these Women Prophecy and
Pray, if not in the Assemblies of the Corinthians? 1 Cor. 11. And yet R. W. (
in his 140. page) justifies a Baptist-Woman (she being his Brother's Wife) her
Loud speaking or Preaching in the Assembly at Newport at the End of the
Dispute, she saying; R. W's. words shall judge you at the Last day. So he
Contradicts himself.

R. W. And thou say: Because we find no such Commission (to wit,
Women-Messengers and Speakers in Assemblies) given by Christ Jesus, or any such
practice amongst the first Believers.

Answ. What! No such Commission given by Christ? had not Mary Magdalen and
other women Commission? and such as Prophesied? as 1 Cor. 11: and Phebe, a
Servant to the Church? and Priscilla? do not thou Contradict thy self here
again? And thou sayd'st before, A Woman was not so fit for Manly Actions; and
yet thou bring Lady Jane and Q. Elizabeth whose Actions were Manly and
Godly: and do thou not Contradict thy self here again? for thou do not
make a Distinction of Women here in this Head.

R. W. Thou say, The Lord has set a preventer, etc. with the Reasons to the
Corinthians, and to Timothy to Answer those Scriptures with a flam, viz. That
Eve the Transgressor, and Women that be Tatlers, p. 27.
are forbidden, and the Woman Jezabel, etc. And, why may not Women be Lord
Mayors, and Bailiffs, and Sheriffs, etc. and Generals and Commanders, etc.

Answ. What is this to the purpose? because Eve the Transgressor, and Tatling
women and Jezabel are forbidden to Teach, does the Apostle forbid Sons and
Daughters to Prophecy? does not the Apostle Preach to the Jews of Sons and
Daughters Prophesying, which was the practice among the true Believers, though
not among you? And do not thou say, There is no Respect of persons with God,
as of man before a woman; and yet thou say, The Lord has set a Preventer to
prevent the Women of such unnatural boldness? and Eve in Transgression, and
Tatling Women and Jezabel, that disobey the Lord; such are Forbidden; for, are
they like to exercise the Office of the Spirit of Prophecy? -- And Women-
Mayors, and Bailiffs, and Sheriffs (as thou Scoffingly bring'st) what is this
to Sons and Daughters Prophesying? for thou dare not say, but that Deborah
and Q. Elizabeth were Commanders and Rulers, which the Lord called them to:
which is not very common to Women. And R. W. why had thy Sister such Unnatural
boldness to Preach so loud, and pass such a Sentence without thy Reproof at the
end of the Dispute at Newport? which Unnatural Boldness thou have justified,
and put her in Print.

R. W. And thou say: That Reason, that the Spirit gives to the Corinthians
for the Vailing of Women in public Assemblies, makes much more for their
Vailing and Silence in matter of Prophesying and Praying, etc.

Answ. The Apostle says no such thing, (1 Cor. 11.) that women should be
silent either in Praying or Prophesying but he shows them, how that they were
to Pray and Prophecy Covered: and therefore thou wrongest the Apostle and the
Scripture in saying, It makes much more for their Vailing and Silence in
matters of Prophecy, and Preaching and Praying. For the Apostle there makes a
distinction of men and women exercising their gifts, and the Man praying
Uncovered, and the woman praying Covered: he gives the Reason, and explaineth
it himself to him that has an Ear.

R. W. And thou tellest the world a Story of Two Mary's, that came from London,
and bid thee Repent, and Hearken to the Light within, etc. And thou ask them
the ground of their Travel and Employment; and they alleged Joels Prophecy,
etc. And thou say, These Women animated the Seamen to Fight, and
Prophesyed, that an hair of their head should not perish; and then thou say,
They were slain, and Tidings came on this whole matter, etc.

Answ. But R. W. who told thee this Story? for their Names thou have not
declared to the World. And if Two Mary's did bid R. W. Repent, and hearken to
the Light of Christ within him, he stands in need enough of it; for had he
Repented, and come to the Light of Christ, he would have been out of this Evil
work. And as for his saying, the two Marys told him the ground of their Travel,
they alleged was Joels Prophecy: and this is like unto that, They Animating
the Seamen to fight, etc. but these are Scoffing words, which do not become an
Old Man, much less a Christian, to tell such Stories to the world.

R. W. And then thou say; In some extraordinary Case, as in Abraham's Case
with Isaac, etc. but we must not tempt God. But if God has poured out his
gifts of Knowledge and Utterance upon some women more then others, they have
three large Fields to walk in mentioned in the Scripture, (viz) Of their
Instructing their Children. (2.) As occasion justly calls them from home, of
Instructing other women, especially the Younger. (3.) Of confessing boldly the
Name of Christ, when he suffers Tyrants to bring persecution on them.

Answ. Are these the Large Fields the Scriptures mention for Sons and Daughters
Prophesying? and must it be the Occasion, and not the Spirit, to cause the
Elder women to Instruct the Younger, as Occasion calls them from home? and is
it not their Duty? and do thou make this a Comparison with Abraham in the
Case of Isaac, as thou say? surely no; for it is the Duty of all Christian
Women in their Families, To instruct their Children. But what is this to
Daughters Prophesying? for did not Priscilla Instruct Apollo as well as Aquila?
and does not the Apostle speak of Women that Labored with him in the Gospel?
(Phil. 4) and were these only their Families, or as occasion justly called them
from home? Did Mary Magdalen and other Women preach Christ's Resurrection, As
occasion called them from home, or as Christ sent them? and did not they
confess and preach Christ at other times, as well as in times of Persecution?
and all true Christian Believers, that Believe in the heart, with the mouth
they will make Confession unto Salvation, Romans 10.

R. W. And thou bring T. H. that says [ The Sight of the Godhead without
Faith in Christ, p. 28.
is the foundation of all false Worships.] And G. F. Answers to T. H. [Can any
see the Godhead, or have a sight of the Godhead, and not see Christ, and have
Faith in Christ? and who has Faith in Christ, do not they see the fullness of
the Godhead, and dwell in Christ? And were not their minds turned To that of
God in them, which declared the Invisible things of him from the Creation of
his Eternal power and Godhead, which the Apostle found fault withal, etc. Romans
1? let all Examine and Judge, and Read the Scripture and try.] -- R.W. Replyeth
to G. F. and says, I have Conversed with all the Indians of New England, etc.
and I have read Romans 1. often, and I find, that first theris generally in all
Mankind in the world a Conviction of an Invisible and Omnipotent, and Eternal
Power and Godhead: and thou say, That this Conviction does arise from the
Creation, etc. And then thou tellest what men hold, etc.

Answ. Do not thou here speak contrary to the Apostle's Doctrine? for does
not the Apostle say, Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in
them, and God has showed it unto them? why do thou speak contrary to the
Apostle's Language, and say, It rises from the Creation? And must not that,
which Is general in all Mankind in the world, be the Spirit of God, which
Convicteth them of the Invisible and Omnipotent, and Eternal Power and
Godhead? (and yet thou say, There is no Voice nor Motion to be hearkened to
in Heavenly things, in matters of Supernatural Light. p. 83.) for the Apostle
says, That, which may be known of God: so it is Of God, which God has showed
unto them; therefore God will Judge the world in Righteousness, who acts
contrary to that, which he Shows them, Romans 1, 19.

R. W. says, I find not, that every man or men ( by all their Natural Light or
Wit, or Christ within) could find out, how the world, or himself, man or woman
were Created; though]. Naylor tells us in Print, that if never a Letter of
the Scripture had been writ, yet their Spirit could tell them all things.

Answ. We do believe thee, that thou and All men in their Natural State, or
Natural Light cannot find out the worlds, nor how they were made, etc. because
that Solomon says, The world is set in thy heart, etc. Eccles. 2. And whereas
thou say, Nor the Light of Christ within; In that thou speak Ignorantly:
for the true Light of Christ, which is Life in the Word, by which All things
were made, this Light, that shines in their hearts, gives them the Light of
the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus the Word, by whom
All things were Created. -- And as for I. N's* saying, that If they had not had
the Scripture, yet the Spirit of God teaches them all things; and why not? Did
not the Spirit of God teach them all things. that gave forth the Scripture? and
is not the Spirit of God the same, which led the holy men of God to give forth
Scriptures, which the Holy Ghost now leads into the Truths of them? -- And the
Apostle says, By Faith we understand, the worlds were made by the word of God,
etc. Heb. 11. and so by the same Faith it is understood now: in the same Faith
Moses describes it, who saw him that was Invisible, and saw Christ, who is the
Author and Finisher of this true Faith; which Faith thou and the
New-England-Priests are erred from, as is manifest.

R. W. Thou say, All men confess, that the Will or Mind of God is pure; and
as they could come to know it, it is to be adored and kept and observed: and
that it was ever, and is wickedness to sin against it.

Answ. Then must not this be the pure Spirit of God, that makes them to
confess to his pure Will or Mind? and to confess, that it was ever sin and
wickedness to sin against it?

R. W. And thou say, None ( for all the Light and Spirit in every one) could
ever find; how Sin, and Death and Sorrow came into the world? nor how such
Inclinations and Dispositions of sin came into themselves?

Answ. Then thou art out of the Faith, and Spirit and Light, that Moses was in,
and the Apostles; for the Apostle, that turned people from the Darkness to the
Light of Christ, Explaineth it ( Romans 5.) And do not thou think, that he saw
it with the Spirit of God within, and the Light of Christ which lights every
man, that comes into the world? and that Moses did not see it with the same
Light of Christ, and the Spirit of God, because thou say, None ( for all the
Light and Spirit in every man) could find it? And such that did understand
Visions and Dreams, and the Scriptures, etc. it was by such, as Obeyed the
Spirit of God; and the Spirit of God Revealed such things to them.

R. W. And further thou say, Thou find in all Men a Conviction, p. 29.
that God is just and powerful, and does bring Plagues and Punishments upon
persons for gross sins, as Adultery and Murder, etc.

Answ. And before thou confessest more General, That it was ever, and is
wickedness to sin against it (to wit, the Mind of God, page 28.) And will not
this Teach them to Resist the Devil, that Teaches them to Forsake sin? and
will not that Teach them to Glorify God, as he is God, if they obey it? and
what is all this, that thou have spoken in thy Answer here to the purpose? for
sometimes thou grantest what G. F. says (in Rom.) and then thou speak
slightingly of the Light of Christ, and call it Natural, which is from the
Spiritual man. But all that see their Happiness, and their Blessedness in the
world, that is without End, they must see it by the Divine Light of Christ and
do Resist the Devil with the Faith, that Christ is the Author of.

R. W. And thou say Hence ( according to G. F. 's Opposite) all Man kind
have invented so many false Gods, false worships, etc. yet out of no more Love
to God, then the Lamb bears to a Lion, etc. and then thou quotest the
Philistines, Samaritans and Sechemites, etc.

Answ. Thy words are General, All Mankind all the world over. What! did
Methuselah, and Jared, and Lamech, and Abraham, and Moses, and the Prophets and
the Apostles Invent? did they Invent any False Gods? for thy words are, All
Mankind have Invented so many false Gods and Worships all the world over.
What! is there no part of the World free? has not God his Seven Thousand
still, as he had in the days of the Prophets, that Do not bow their knee to
Baal? 1 King. 19. And did not all those that Invented all those false ways and
worships, go from that of God In them, which God had showed unto them?

R. W. And then thou say: The Sechemites for fear of Lions, or hope of Gain
will be of any Worship or Religion, as most this day in the World will be; yea,
all and every soul, except to whom ( in and from the Holy Scriptures) the Holy
Spirit Reveals the Incomprehensible Mystery of a Mediator.

Answ. Then they are not All Mankind. And as for Being of any Religion for
hope of Gain, that thou and the Priests might have kept at home: for the Gain
that Gods Servants got, that were sent to preach the Gospel among you, was
Gallowses, Whips, Prisons and bad Language. And they that own the Holy Spirit
to Reveal Christ the Mystery, the Mediator (which Holy Spirit leads into all
Truth) they will own us, and not them that talk of it, and live out of it.

R. W. And then thou bring'st I. H. his saying [ The Justification and
Redemption by obeying the Light within is a Mystery of Iniquity] G. F. Answ.
[He that believes, is justified from all things, and comes not into
Condemnation; for he has the Witness in himself: and that lets him see (to
wit, the Light of Christ) the Redeemer the Savior; the Light, which walking in
it he is cleansed from all sin. So no Mystery of Iniquity; for the Mystery of
Iniquity is out of the Light: and none sees Justification and Redemption, but
with the Light which comes from Christ, who has enlightened them] To this R W.
Replyeth, and begins with his Foul Language, and says, This is subtle; but
being examined, it will be a Mystery of Hellish Iniquity, and lighter then
Vanity it self.

Answ. Poor Man! he might very well have kept this at home. And then he goes
on and says, G. F. confounds Justification, and the Light of Christ, and
Faith and Obedience ( after his Babilonish wont) all in a Juglers Box within
together; so that the English of it is, Faith is Christ, Obedience is Christ,
Justification is Christ, etc. And then thou say, It is true Figuratively.

Answ. If it be True Figuratively, why do thou call it Babilonish and
Juglers Box, and Lighter then Vanity, and Hellish Iniquity? but G. F.'s words
are plain enough, as they speak; but thou, that art in the Hellish Iniquity,
and the Juglers box, etc. may Cavil at them.

R.W. And because that G.F. says [None see Justification and Redemption (
which comes from Christ, who has enlightened them) but with the Light within]
R. W. says, That G. F.'s words may be in plain English thus rendered [None sees
Christ and Christ, p. 30.
but with the Christ within, which comes from Christ, who has Christed him.

Answ. Now Reader see, if G. F.'s words speak, as he Maliciously says. For,
can any see Christ Jesus their Sanctification, Justification and Redemption,
but by the Light, which Christ has enlightened them withal? for with the same
Light they see their sins, and Christ their Savior and Redeemer, etc. -- And
thou say, It is a Mystery, or a subtle Trick of Hell, to call Faith
Obedience, and Obedience to the Light Justification, etc. Reader, read G. F.'s
words, and see, if G. F. has either mentioned the word Obedience, or Faith (p.
29.)? So R. W. Inventeth words, and then he called them a Mystery, and a subtle
Trick of Hell, to call them, as he has invented them; which is his own subtle
Trick of Hell, for there is no such word in G. F.'s Answer. And then he calls
it True sense, and says, True Sense (as Money) answers all things; but we
cannot deny the Apostle's Doctrine, how that Christ is made unto us Wisdom and
Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption: and thy Distinguishing of
Heavenly matters is like thy Distinguishing of G. F.'s words, as has been
showed before in thy Contradictions.

R. W. And then thou say, It is another Gospel, and yet not another: but is
a Dream and dead Picture of an Image or an Idol, to put-in our Obedience and
Working.

Answ. What Contradictions and Confusions are these! and what work make thou
about Obedience! for G. F. has not mentioned the word Obedience; but thou
fightest with thy own words: but seeing thou make such work with Obedience,
read Romans 1, 5.6, 16.16, 19. and 2 Cor. 7, 15.10, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1, 2.

R. W. And then thou say, I know, they Father this Bastard upon the
most-Holy God himself, saying, It is His Obedience, His Righteousness and His
Working in the room of the Death and Bloodshedding, the Sufferings and Merits
of the Lord Jesus.

Answ. I did never hear so many foul words, and such Perversions from any man
in my Life! the Reader may see in R. W.'s own Book, there is not the word
Obedience in G. F's. Answer, which he replyeth to. And we do say, that Christ
Jesus was Obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross, Phil. 2: and the
Apostle says, As by the Disobedience of one Man many were made Sinners, so by
the Obedience of One (to wit Christ) many were made Righteous. And the Saints
are Obedient to Christ's Faith and Spirit, etc.

R. W. And then thou go on, and tellest of Laban changing wages, etc. and
then thou tellest us of the Papists and Jews etc. and the Bargain of Do this
and Live; and a Bargain of Saving our selves, and a Bargain of Flying out of
our selves only to Gods Mercies in the Mediation of Christ Jesus: and then
again render our selves so Holy, so Obedient, so Righteous, so Loving, so
Chaste, so Meek, so Patient, so Temperate, that in thought, word or deed we sin
not. And this our Holiness is Christ, and God, and Spirit, and Justification,
etc.

Answ. Reader did thou ever hear, how he has jumbled things together here?
Where did Christ and the Apostles use these words, as Making of Bargains with
his People? it is like, R. W. thinks, he is Wiser then they, that gave forth
the Scriptures, and their words are too simple for him to speak: but R. W.'s
Scoffing Expressions here do not touch us; he may apply this at home. And this
we say, Every one that follows Christ, must Take up his Cross, and deny
himself, he that will be his Disciple: and they must Die with Christ, if they
Live with him; and suffer with him, if they Reign with him: and his Spirit
teaches Temperance, Patience and Holiness, yea, to deny that which is Unholy
both in Word and in Thought. And the Righteousness of Christ Jesus is our Fine
Linen; and it is God and Christ, that does justify by the Spirit, who art
thou that do Condemn? And where did we say, that Our Holiness is Christ and
God? though we cannot deny Christ to be Our Holiness, etc. who deny
Self-holiness.

R. W. And thou say, I know, the Writers of the Quakers make this high
Obedience to be the Crown of some high Saints among them, as the Papists do;
and that others come not so high, are taken by the fleshly Spirit, and Repent
and Confess, and be more watchful, as they say, in a Contradiction of J. Naylor.

Answ. These are most horrid Lies; and Reader see, if G. F. speaks any of
these words in his Answer to T. H. as to the Crowning of high Saints ( like the
Papists) for their Obedience, or Making their Obedience a Crown: for it is the
Lord Jesus Christ, that Crowns his Saints, that believe in his Name, and grow
up in his Grace and Truth. And as for a Fleshly Spirit, and Repent, and
Confess, this you may apply at home; for we own no Repentance nor Confession.
but what is made by the Spirit of God, in which we have Unity: and for
Exhorting to the watchful, that is Christ's Doctrine. And it is no
Contradiction to say, He that is born of God, cannot sin: for the Apostle John
explaineth this in his Epistles better than thou can, which the Quakers own;
which thou make a great Jumble about. For the Apostle says, He that
believes, is born of God, and overcomes the world: and is not that the world
in men's hearts? and he writes to Young Men and Fathers, which had Overcome the
Wicked one; and to Little Children, that they sin not: and if any man sins,
we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is a
Propitiation for our sins; and not for our sins only, but for the sins of the
whole World, 1 John 2.

R. W. Thou say, Yet again ( in a horrible Mystery of Iniquity) they exclaim
against the Protestants for saying, A Child of God cannot fall from the true
Grace Finally or Totally.

Answ. Here are no such words in G. F.'s Answer to T. H. Or how hangs this
together? thou say, They say, He that is born of God, cannot sin; then how
Can they Fall from the true Grace? But what say thou to them, that Crucify
the Son of God afresh, and do despite against the Spirit of Grace, and turn it
into Wantonness? and these are such, as do not Own the True Grace of God, which
is their Teacher, though it has appeared to them; nor do not Believe in the
Light of Christ Jesus, but hate it. And If the Righteous Fall, they rise again;
but the Wicked Fall into Mischief.

R. W. And thou say, Here is a Mystery of Hellish Iniquity, in that they
confess, such a Man, Christ, to have been, and his Bloodshedding, p. 31.
the Types, and real Predictions and Figures of him, a real Death, Resurrection
and Ascension; yet upon the point ( by a Devilish Chemistry) evaporate all
these, and leave nothing but a Christ within, as God and Man, whose Name is now
Light, etc. Motions within --.

Answ. As for Hellish Mystery of Iniquity, and Devilish Chemistry, thou may
keep at home: for according to the Scriptures of Truth we do believe Christ
Jesus his Birth, Sufferings, Resurrection, and Ascension; who fulfilled the
Prophets, and the Types and Shadows of him. And what! must we not call God and
Christ, as the Scriptures call them? for God is called the Light; and Christ
says, I am the Light. And though Christ is Risen, and Sits at the Right
hand of God, yet he does dwell In his Saints, his Temple, according to the
Apostle's Doctrine, as you may see, 1 Cor. 6. and 2 Cor. 6. -- And what! must
not God's people Obey the Motions of the Spirit of Christ and his Light, and to
take heed to it? by which they may see Christ their Savior, and Justification
and Salvation, and the Lord their Righteousness? and the Apostle stirred up to
Perfection and to Holiness, which all the Saints are to follow.

R W. And thou say, It is a Hellish Mystery of the Devil, to Cosen poor
souls with a Notion of the Difficulty and Hight of their profession, and of
Worshipping God in Spirit and Truth; which they say, no body in the world does,
but they. -- Spirit within --.

Answ. Our good Profession, which we make, is of Christ Jesus our Lord and
Savior, who has enlightened us to follow him and his Worship* that he has set
up in Spirit and Truth: and they that quench the Spirit, and hate the Light,
and will not come to Truth, cannot worship God in Spirit and Truth, John 3.4.
And this Truth and Spirit of God is Within people; and thou or they, that draw
people from the Truth in the Inward parts, and Spirit within, you draw them
into the Hellish Mystery, and Cosen poor souls (as thou speak of) for coming
to Christ and his Worship. -- And whereas thou say, Thou toldest them of an
Image in the Bed, but David was gone etc. but this is thy own Condition. And
then thou say, That their Religion is one of the Easiest in the world. Nay,
thou never trod the Path, thou do not know what it is; the Gallowses, and
Goals and Whip-Stocks manifest, whether Our Religion be Easy.

R. W, And whereas thou tellest us, What will delight our Ears and Minds, to
wit, various Tunes of Music, etc.

Answ. But that which Delights Us, is the Lord Jesus Christ, and his Holy
Ghost: and the Joy of the Lord is our Strength. And that which thou applyest to
Us, thou may keep at home; it is thy own, and none of ours.

R. W. And thou say, If a poor soul give way an Inch, and lets in one
thought of yielding to the Voice of a Spirit within, they are filled and
ravished with Curious Notions of Justification, Holiness and Righteousness, God
and Christ, and the Spirit within them.

Answ. How endlesly do thou speak against the Voice of the Spirit of God in
his People! And the Apostle exhorts, Not to walk after the Flesh, but after
the Spirit, Romans 8, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 26, 27. Romans 12, 11. and 1
Cor. 6, 20, 34. 1 Cor. 12, 13. Gal. 5, 5, 16, 18, 25. Ephesians. 4, 3, 5, 9. Phil. 1,
27, That you stand fast in one Spirit: Phil. 2, 1, If any fellowship of the
Spirit etc: and those are the Poor souls, that do not hear, what the Spirit
says to the Churches. And they that Obey the Voice of God and Christ, must
Obey the motions of the Spirit: and the Holy Spirit leads to Holiness, and to
him that Justifies freely by his Grace; and without Holiness none shall see
the Lord. And does not the Scripture say plainly, that God says, I will be
your God, and ye shall be my People, and that he would dwell in them, and walk
in them, 2 Cor. 6? and does not the Apostle say, that None can call Jesus
Christ Lord, but by the Spirit? and is not that within?

R. W. And thou say, They can now Thou the King, and they need no
Scriptures, nor Teachers.

Answ. May be thou art offended, because we say Thee and Thou to thee; for I
never heard the King was. And such Teachers as thee, we have No Need of, we can
praise the Lord: and the Scriptures we have the Comfort of them, and can praise
God for them.

R. W. And thou say, Thus, as in a Dream, their great Debts of Thousands and
Millions are paid and dis-charged.

Answ. Yes, by the Blood of Christ Jesus, who dyed for our Sins; and is risen
again for our Justification. And we can praise God, that we are come out of
your Cage (that thou speak of) and can say, The Turtle-Dove is heard in our
Land: and Christ does Deliver us from the Devil, of Hell and Death, and gives
us the Victory. -- And what, if some have been Rapt up into Paradise (as Paul
was) and speak and see Unutterable Joys (which thou Scoffingly speak of the
People of God) and what is this to them, that Followed Absalom? And thou
speak of Jewels fallen into the Dirt; truly this is thy own Work, that art
flinging thy Dirt at God's People*

R. W. And then thou say, As I hope in the Parishes of the Protestants and
Papists also, who being only Ignorant, (as the Disciples were) of main points
of Christianity, yet aim uprightly at God, truly love him, and labor to
increase in the Knowledge and Grace of Christ.

Answ. How now R. W. What! art thou now flattering the Papists and the
Parish-Protestants? and before The Papists would burn the Bible? And do not
thou say, Old and New England may flourish, when the Pope and Rome are in
Ashes? and such, as have True Love to God, and labor to increase in the
Knowledge and Grace of Christ? and yet, The Papists will burn the Bible? And as
for all the sober Protestants, they will be ashamed of thy foul words; and if
they read thy Book, they will see, how thou have abused us with foul words, the
Lord knows.

R. W. And thou bring'st Jer. Ives's saying, [ There may be a Light to Convince
of Sin, and not yet within man] -- G. F. Answ. [There is no people Convinced of
Sin, but they are Convinced within themselves, and with the Light within them.
p. 32.
It is the Light, which makes manifest to a Man, when he is Convinced: it
answers to something, and reaches to something in their particulars; though
the words be spoken without them from the Light]. R. W. Replyeth against G.
F.'s words (which are very good Truth) and cries; It is doleful Business to
read and hear, how Satan ( in his Chains of Darkness) yet has Liberty to
appear abroad, as an Angel of Light from Heaven, thus Vaporing and Swaggering
under the Cloak and Colors of Light --.

Answ. R. W. cannot endure to hear talk of the Light of Christ; but like the
Jews, who said, That Christ by the Prince of Devils cast out Devils. And how
does R. W. prove, that it is the Devil, that is as an Angel of Light from
Heaven in his Transforming, and not the Light of Christ in us? for Christ
says, he is Out of Truth; but we know, that this Light and Spirit leads Into
all Truth. And we do believe (according to the Scriptures of Truth) that the
Light (which enlightneth every one, that comes into the world) is the Life in
the Word, by which all things were made: and Christ, who said, I am the Light
of the world, was Glorified with the Father, before the world b^gan. And they
that believe in the Light of Christ, do become Children of the Light, and no
man can Come to God, but by Christ the Light, and to Salvation, but by the
Light of Christ, which gives them the knowledge of it. -- And this Light of
Christ R. W. calls a Devil in Samuels Mantle, and a Dragon, and a Devil of
Darkness, the God of this world, Vapourings, Crackings and Cheatings; and, He
labors to keep all in Blindness, or to beat out the Eyes of those, whom God
has truly enlightened: this is thy own Condition R. W. And thou say, That
God was Light, etc. then why do thou rail against the People of God called
Quakers, for professing, That God and Christ is Light?

R. W. And thou Scoffingly say, That the Quakers confess, That the Natural
Man perceives not the things of God; only they say, that beside Natural Light
and Reason; there is the Holy Seed, God and Christ within every Son; and to
this Spirit and Seed in Prison they preach. And Fox in our Discourses alleges
and affirms, God (in every man) to be a Cart laden with Sheaves, pressed
under, and as it were in Prison, etc. Blasphemous wretches, etc.

Answ. Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer to Jer. Ives,
as R. W. brings here? And whereas he says, Fox in our Discourses alleges,
etc: G. F. had never no Discourse with R. W. And whereas he says, That God and
Christ is the Seed within in all men, Those are not our words: for we say, that
Christ is the good Seeds man, that Sows the good Seed on all sorts of ground.
And to say, That the Eternal God is in Prison, these are his own Blasphemies:
and, The Natural man perceives not the things of God, that is true; and is his
own Condition. -- And as for the Lord's saying, He was pressed under the
Transgressing Jews, as a Cart with Sheaves; and therefore R. W. says, that the
Quakers say, God was in Prison: which is false. And we say, That which may be
known of God, is manifest in Every Man, which God has showed unto them: which
we tell all people of, as the Apostle did, and turn them to the Light and
Grace, that comes from Jesus, that they may turn to God and Christ, from
whence it comes. And thy Ungodly, Railing words touch us not.

R. W. And thou confessest, All Light or Truth Natural, Civil or Divine, it
comes from without, and is received by an Internal Faculty, p. 33.
according to the Capacity etc. of it: from thence it is conveyed to the Court,
etc. to be Examined.

Answ. What! is not this Court (or Guard, or Captain within) the Light of
Christ within to know Truth from Falsehood? And then thou say, That G. F.
urges [There must be a Receiver, and something that Answers,] and thou
say, That Natural Truth, or Moral etc. are soon received by Moral
Understandings. G. F. does not speak of Morals here, but the Light of Christ,
which Convinces, which is Supernatural, that brings the Christians (that
love the Light) to Discern Spiritual and Heavenly things from Natural. And
therefore Christ said, The Spirit of Truth should lead them into all truth: and
the Apostle says, Whatsoever does make manifest and reproves, is Light. And
what is all this to the purpose that thou speak ( page 31, 32 and 33)? and
who denies, but that the Natural receives Natural, and the Spiritual
Spiritual? for thou seem sometimes to grant, and sometimes to oppose: for
that, which G. F. speaks, is concerning the things of God.

R. W. And then thou tellest us, How that Christ asked his Disciples, how many
Loaves they had? [But what is this to the Light of Christ? those are Natural
things]. And then thou tellest us, How that Christ asked his Disciples, whom
say they that I (the Son of Man) am? and thou say, This was a Divine and
Supernatural Question; and for the outside and truth of the Fact, the Devils
could answer as well as the Disciples.

Answ. This R. W. might very well have kept at home, and his New England
Professors. For had R.W. and them known, that there had been a Christ, if the
Scripture had not declared it? for, have they the same Revelation, as Peter had
of Christ, Beyond flesh and blood? And was not this Revelation Within Peter by
the Spirit of God? and did not he see it with the Light of Christ, and with
that, which thou confessest, that will say, The Mind of God is pure? etc. (as
in thy 28. page) and then thou Grantest the Quakers Principle, which thou do
Oppose. And thou say, All true Believers hearts do receive and wel-come all
truly Divine and Heavenly Doctrines; Then there is the Light of God within to
receive them, if they do not hate it: and if they quench the Spirit, they are
not like to receive them; but choose the evil, and hate the good.

R. W. And then thou say, G. F. talks of something within, which is
preached to.

Answ. Thou abusest G. F.'s words, for G. F.'s words are, Reached to, as the
Reader may see.

R. W. And thou say, That the Natural Man perceives no Spiritual matter;
but when he is born again, then he acts and works, etc.

Answ. Here again thou abusest the Scriptures, and Christ's words, and
contradictest thy self. For thou say, There is a Conviction in all Mankind
in the world of an Invisible, and Omnipotent, and Eternal power and God head
(page 28.) And Christ says, Believe in the Light, while ye have it, that ye
may become Children of Light; and he that believes, is born of God: which
Christ shows, that they have the Light, before they be born again; or else
how can it be the Condemnation of them, that do not believe? And Natural men,
that hate Christ's Light, and grieve his Spirit in them, they are not like to
perceive the things of God. p. 34.
And then thou ramblest on and tell, what the Protestants say, but to no
purpose to G. F's. Answer.

R. W. And thou say; G. F. says, There is a Something, a Seed, though but
as a Grain of Mustard Seed, a Seed of God, of Christ, of the Spirit, to which
Christ the Word is preached: and then thou say, Horribly abusing the
Scriptures.

Answ. Now Reader see, if there be any of these Words in G. F's. Answer to Jer.
Ives? and see, if he has not abused G. F's. Words? And why does he scoff at
the Preaching to the Spirit? for, did not the Apostle Preach to the Spirit? and
sow to the Spirit? and of the Spirit reaped Life Eternal? and was not this
within People? And is not Christ the Seeds-man, that sows his Seed upon all
Grounds? And does not Christ compare the Kingdom of Heaven to a Grain of
Mustard Seed? read Matthew. 13. R. W. cannot endure, that G. F. should speak
Scripture.

R. W. And thou say, They maintain, though Men be dark and dead; yet Christ
within is Light and alive in them, and them only.

Answ. Here again thou wrong'st our Words; though we say, That Christ
enlightneth every one that comes into the World, which is the Life in the
Word: and this is the Condemnation of them that hate it. And they that receive
the Light, receive Christ; from whence it comes, that has Englightned them.

R. W. And thou say, G. F. his lying Cheats of a Sufficient Light within to
lead to God and to Salvation, a Teacher within etc: And thou further say, It
is a simple Superfluity, to hold a Candle of Out-ward Words to awaken and
englighten such a glorious all-sufficient Sun within.

Answ. Here thou do not know what thou say; thy Enmity against the Light
of Christ has blinded thee. We say, The Light of Christ is no Cheat; it is
Sufficient to believe in: for, He that believes, is Saved. And the Light that
shines in the Heart, gives the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of
Christ Jesus; and it is Sufficient to take heed unto, Until the day dawn, and
the Day Star arise in their Hearts. And the Jews, though God poured out his
Spirit upon them, and they transgressed, God sent his Prophets to turn them to
his Spirit, which they had grieved and erred from, and so to God. And Christ
sent his Apostles, to turn them to the Light etc; and so do God's Messengers
now (though they hate them and it) to the Intent, that they may turn to Christ,
the Sun of Righteousness, from whence it comes. And all the Believers in the
Light are in fellowship with it, and can declare, What Christ has done for
their Souls; and praise God in the Assemblies.

R. W. Thou ask, Where is this Something of God ( yea, God and Christ?) and
say; If he Answer in the Understanding, he grants it Dark etc; if in the
Heart and the Affections etc, he confesses, all there is hard and dead.

Answ. They that hate the Light, and will not come to the Light, because their
Deeds be evil, and because it will reprove them; they Know all this with the
Light. And they are like to have their Understandings darkened and hardened, when
they hate the Light; that should soften them; so, their Understandings are
darkened: and Christ does quicken them, that are Dead in Sins and Trespasses,
that believe in this Light. And thou say, It is God and Christ, which the
Quakers do not say; but it is the Light of Christ, that they may believe in it,
and be graffted into him.

R. W. And thou say, Christ the Sun of Righteousness arose with saving rays
or wings of Salvation; but the blind Jews could not own him for their Messiah.

Answ. This is thine and your own Condition, Transgressing Christians, who will
Not own Christ the Light, who enlightneth every one that comes into the World.
And thou say, Though no Man sees it [to wit, Christ that lightneth every
Man, that comes into the VVorld]: Though R. W. and the New-England-Professors
Sees it not (because their Darkness cannot comprehend it), yet the Believers in
the Light See it, and Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, from whence it comes;
and receive him, the Messiah, though thou, and the Jews will not. And they that
come to the Light of Christ, they See how Christ enlightneth all Men, that come
into the World, by the Life in the Word; and how the Word was made Flesh.

R. W. And thou say; What is this to a mixture of Light and Darkness?

Answ. Nay, we must tell thee, that the true Light does not Mix with Darkness:
though it shines in darkness, darkness does not comprehend it; but the Light
comprehends darkness. And what was that the Pharisees closed their Eyes to, and
stopped their Ears, and pricked Saul, and made him kick again?

R. W. And after thou have rambled to no purpose, thou say; When God in his
own Means ordinarily works the Will to hear, p. 35.
to turn, to believe, to pray etc. And being thus turned with Ephraim etc.

Answ. The Apostle says; It is not him, that Wills. And is it the Will of
Man, that hears? and was it not the Spirit of Ephraim that Heard, seeing God
had poured out his Spirit upon the House of Israel? and Christ says, He that
has an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches. And thou have
not seen thy Undone Condition yet! And if thou wast in a Mourning lamenting
state, thou would not be in this Work; who say, When he turns our
Wilderness etc, into a Garden: it seems, It is Not Yet; which we do believe
thee.

R. W. And thou say; Then we bring forth sweet Fruits, Flowers etc: and,
When he turns the Wolf into a Lamb, then we are meek, innocent, and patient.

Answ. Mark, When; it seems, it is Not Yet: and therefore, have these Weeds
and Wolfish Nature appeared etc. in New England, that have Worryed the Lambs;
who have showed forth such an Impatient, Vnmeek, and Vn-innocent Spirit, not to
be the Spirit of Christ; and so, No true Christians.

R. W. And thou say; But to talk of the Preaching to the Spirits in Prison
etc: and the Seed of God in Prison etc: when the Lord speaks of his warning and
moving Men by Noah 's Preaching in the Old World (as may be evidently evinced)
is like the profane Teaching of Parrots to prate of Grace etc: and as the
Parrot in France could say her Paternoster, her Creed etc: and yet knew as
much of the working of God in the Soul, as the Popish Teachers.

Answ. Do thou think, the Popish Teachers knows no more of the Grace of God,
which has appeared to all Men, than a Parrot? and do not thou Contradict thy
self, and say, That the Papists aim uprightly at God, and truly love him,
and labor to increase in the Knowledge of Grace? ( Page 31.) And (in thy
Epistle to the King and Baxter) would thou not have the Papists etc. in
Ashes, burnt with Fire and Brimstone? and now, That their Teachers know but as
much as a Parrot, of the Grace of God working in their Souls, (and that is)
Nothing at all? -- And why do thou show thy self so dark, and so envious
against the Seed of Christ being in Prison? for, does not Christ say [ I was in
Prison etc?] and was not that his Seed? and [ Why persecutest thou me?] and was
not that Christ in his Members? And why do thou compare Christ's Preacking to
the Spirits in Prison by his Spirit in the days of Noah, to a Parrot? like
unto the Parrots profane Preaching in France etc? And all may read (1 Pet. 3,
18, 19.) how Christ preached to the Spirits in Prison by his Spirit in the
days of Noah; Peter does not say, that it was Noah, but it was Christ: and the
Prisoning comes by Disobedience. And does not Christ say to the Prisoners,
Show your selves forth? and so, it is not Means Ordinary (as thou speak of)
for People To Believe in the Light, but a great Work of God; and that makes
you so stumble at the Light.

R. W. And thou say; They often say, God is All.

Answ. Does not the Scripture say the same, That God may be All, and In All, 1
Cor. 15? and Ephesians. 4. One God the Father of All, who is above All, and through
All, and in you All? but thou can not speak our Words right.

R. W. And thou bring Jer. Ives's Words, who says; [ It is a known Error to
say, That a Man was in Hell, and in Heaven] And G. F. Answ. J. I. and says
[Who in this shows his Ignorance of Scripture* For it gives Testimony of
Men, that did witness, that they had Been in Hell, in the Nether-most Hell; and
witnessed again, that they were In Heaven, and Sat in Heavenly Places in
Christ Jesus: and such were In Heaven, as is spoken of in the Revelations.] And
this Truth according to the Scriptures, R. W. calls a Lame, cheating Answer,
who cannot speak without Reviling: but let the Reader judge. And R. W. says,
That G. F. and Millions more, talk of Heaven, as the Parrot; but this he might
have applied at Home.

R. W. And whereas thou say; They talk as the Parrot of our Forefathers,
some from the Scriptures, and some out of Reasons Light talk of Places of Joy
Eternal for the Righteous, and Misery for the Wicked.

Answ. What R. W! have thou a Parrot, that has as much Light and Reason to
talk of these things, as G. F. and Men? And did not thou say before, Thou
find all Men to confess, that the Mind or Will of God was pure, and to be
observed? and that it is ever wickedness to sin against it? and now to say; G.
F. and Millions talk like a Parrot? what! is not Reason and Light in Men beyond
the Parrots Knowledge? Truly, Enmity has darkened thee, and thou art ignorant
of thy own Condition; therefore, thou judge others with thy Contradictions.
And thou tellest the Parable of Dives and Lazarus ( Luke 16.); but take heed,
thou do not know, how soon thou may be in Dives's state, who art so much
against the poor Lazarus's, that believe in the Light of Christ Jesus, and have
no Helpers, but God and Christ: and thou needs not tell us, what the Intent of
Christ's speaking of Dives and Lazarus was etc.

R. W. And thou says, He knows (to wit, G. F.) the state of Sorrow and
Bitterness is called Hell, and the state of Death and the Grave is set out by
the Word Hell etc: and so to either of these he wickedly applies the Third
state, of which the Lord Jesus so clearly speaks, p. 36.
viz. the State of the Ungodly after this Life, in the Life and World to come.

Answ. Here thou pervertest G. F's Words. For, in his Answer he does not speak
of the World to come* and the Wicked are turned into Hell, Psalm. 116. Psalm.
139. Jonah 2.
after they die; but as David spoke, Though the Gates of Hell took hold of him;
and as Jonah cried out in the Whales Belly in Hell, in Misery. For thou say;
G. F. knows, the state of Hell is Sorrow and Bitterness, and Death and Grave;
and yet thou say in thy Contradiction, G. F. talks of Heaven and Hell, as
the Parrot: R. W. does the Parrot know, that Hell is called Sorrow and
Bitterness, Death and Grave?

R. W. And thou say; That he (G. F.) knows, the Visible state of the true
Profession of Christ is called Heaven. [But can every Visible Eye see this
Heaven?] And thou say, Such as have an Interest in Christ Jesus, have sitten
down with him in those Heavenly Mansions, into which he is entered bodily, and
gone to prepare for their Reception and Coming.

Answ. If thou and the New England Professors were in this which thou speak
of, they would not persecute the People of God called Quakers. And then thou
tellest of the Third Heaven, the Place of Paul's Rapture of Joy and Blessedness
etc, when these Heavens and Earth are burnt up and consumed. What! are the
Heavenly Mansions and Glories to be burnt up, which they that have an Interest
in Christ, have sitten down in him in those Heavenly Mansions? for we know,
what Heavens and Earth the Apostle tells of, that must be Burnt up and
Consumed.

R. W. And thou say; It Is like, G. F. has been occasioned to these thoughts
by the Papists Fables about Heaven, and Hell, and Purgatory.

Answ. No such matter.

R. W. And then thou go on with a great Story of the Papists (which thou
had better to have kept at home), and thou say; G. F. knows, how that the
Papists get a great world of Money of these Notions of Heaven and Hell etc.

Ans. And G. F. knows, that the New England Priests get a great deal of M^^* as
well as the Papists, by telling People of Heaven and Hell; and make a trade
with the Scriptures, as the Papists do, with their Inventions.

R. W. And thou say, G. F. not believing these Fables, he fancies, that Hell
is some Apprehensions in the Mind of Wrath to come, and that is Hell and Wrath
it self: and having had flashies of Pride and Peace in their Minds, these are
the Joys of Heaven.

Answ. Then this is above the Parrot ta^king of Heaven and Hell; for has the
Parrot had such Apprehensions? And as for Pride and the Fables, keep at home
Roger; for we have known (as David and the Holy Men of God did) what Hell is?
and the Righteous passes through in this Life: and it is well, if thou have
have not made Agreement with Hell, Isa. 15.18. And has not Hell enlarged her
self by thee, and such as speak so much Evil against the Light of Christ, and
the Believers in it? and see, if thy TONGVE BE NOT SET ON FIRE OF HELL, Jam. 3.
and the Wicked, that Christ speaks of, That must go into Hell, thou shall
know that (I warrant thee) except thou Repent, Mark 9, 43, 45, 47. And thou,
and the New England Priests and Professors, may read your Conditions Matthew. 13,
15. how the Jews compassed Sea and Land to make a Proselyte; and when he was
made, they made him twofold more a Child of Hell etc* like you New England
Priests: and was not this to get him into a Form of Godliness without Life and
Power, and oppose Christ in his Light? But we can say, The Lord Jesus has
delivered us from the Wrath to come, 1 Thessalonians. 1, 10: and, God has not
appointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who
dyed for us, awd we shall be saved from Wrath through him, (and so from Hell)
who are justified by his Blood, Romans 5, 9: and therefore, do not thou Treasure
up Wrath unto thy self against the Day of Wrath etc, Romans 2. And the Believers
in Christ do Enjoy in this Life an hundredfold, and in the World to come Life
Everlasting: so, our Joys are not Flashies of Heaven and Hell; neither do we
Cheat poor Souls (as thou falsely accusest us) with such Flashies; but do
believe according to the sound Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles.

R. W. And thou say (after thou have rambled a great while^t no purpose)
They do allow a time more or less, before they come into the perfect Heavenly
State, etc.

Answ. We say, There is a Growth from a Child to a Young Man, and to a Father
in the Truth; and God accepts of the Faithfulness of all. And as for Satan
enticing into proud vanities, thou might have kept at home.

R. W. And thou say; p. 37.
They have a mad Fancy of their Souls going into God, and becoming more God etc.

Answ. This is thy own mad Fancy: and let the Reader see, if there be any such
thing in G. F's. Answer? But this is a Word of thy own forging, and not ours,
to say. Our Souls becoming more God; but to say, Our Souls go to Christ, who is
the Bishop of them, that is true: and why should they not, who has Bought us
and them with his Blood? And do thou not Contradict thy self, in saying,
Their Souls go to Jesus? ( page 21, and page 37.)

R. W. And thou tellest of a State of Eternal Joy to the Righteous after this
Life, and a State of Eternal Misery, to the Ungodly etc.

Answ. Thou need not to tell us of this; though thou say, The exact
Knowledge of Particulars exceeds the present Sight of our Mortal Eyes, and the
Hearing of our Ears etc. Can these things, or the Joy of the Holy Ghost be Seen
with Mortal Eyes, or Heard with Mortal Ears? for does not Christ say, He that
has an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches? And is it by
the Sight of the Mortal Eye, and the Hearing of the Mortal Ear, that sees and
hears the Joy and Comfort of the Holy Ghost, or the Spiritual Ear in this
Life? And the Apostle says, Ye have your Fruits unto Holiness, and your End
everlasting Life: now, did not the Apostle See and Hear this with a Spiritual
Eye and Ear, what the Saints did Enjoy both in this Life, and in Everlasting
Life, Romans 6? for what can thou See with thy Mortal Eye, or Hear with thy
Mortal Ear, but that which is Mortal? A Natural Man perceives not the things
of God (as thou have confessed) but the Apostle says, The Eye has not seen,
nor the Ear heard etc. the things which God has prepared for them that love
him; but God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for his Spirit searches
all things, yea the deep things of God.

R. W. And then thou runnest on and say, The first Fruits* and a Taste both
of the Heavenly Joys, and the Torments of the damned are given by God in this
Life; to the first in that Solid Peace and Joy, which they have in God; to the
other in that Horror and Despair, and Enmity against God.

Answ. This last R. W. may apply home to himself. For if ever he had known the
First Fruits of the heavenly peace, which God's people has in God, he would
never have written such a book against his people: but it is like, his Torments
are begun in this Life.

R. W. And thou say, There is three sorts of men especially will seek, there
is an Hell to come, above other sinners: The Voluptuous and Luxurious etc:
whose God is their belly etc. the devourers of the poor etc: The proud pufft up
with foolish confidences boldly crying, Lord open to us etc.

Answ. R. W. might have applied a great deal of this to himself, who has Hell
so often in his mouth against the Redeemed of the Lord.

R. W. And thou bring Jer. Ives, who said: [ The Pharisees were far enough
from having the Kingdom of heaven within them]. And G F. Ans. [Contrary to
Christ's words, who said, It was within them.] And R. W. replyeth and says, The
Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of heaven is one.

Answ. Who says to the Contrary? And then thou say, Of the Kingdom or
Government of God and Christ in the Soul, and the Government of God in his holy
Providence in the World, and his Government in the Churches and Saints, and the
Glorious State to come after this Life. Who says to the Contrary of this? not
the Quakers.

R. W. And then thou say, That his Journey-man G F. is a sit Instrument to
destroy all these, and to erect in their steed a dull, proud, dogged Confusion
or Babel within under the Name of God, Christ, Spirit, Light, Faith,
Righteousness, Resurrection.

Answ. All these be Lies. For let the Righteous and Honest Christian Judge, can
the Government of God in his holy Providence be destroyed? or Christ's
government in his Church be destroyed, when Christ says, The Gates of Hell
shall not prevail against his Church? Can Gods Glorious government and state
after this Life of his people be destroyed (which R. W. says, His Journey-man
G F. is a fit Instrument to destroy all these)? We say, Nay: But thy
Antichristian Religion may be destroyed -- And as for dull, proud, dogged
Confusion etc: under the Name of God, Christ, Spirit, Light, etc: which thou
talkest of without Life, is thy own Confused Babel, that may be destroyed. But
Christ, who is the Quickening Spirit, and the Author of Faith, and the Lord of
Righteousness, and the Resurrection, him thou can not destroy; he dies no
more: and he has enlightened us, and given us Faith, who is the Lord of
Righteousness and our Resurrection yea, now and at the last day.

R. W. And then thou tellest us, Christ knew, That the Jews and his own
Christian Followers were leavened with a Worldly Notion, that their Messiah
should be a Glorious Temporal King etc; and he tells them, That they were
mistaken; and says, That his Kingdom should not be such a Kingdom; p. 38.
but that it was within them. Hence the Kingdom of Heaven is a spiritual,
inward, and soul-Kingdom concerning God, and the Soul and Spiritual matters.

Answ. And this thou confessest, was to the Jews and his Christian Followers,
which were Leavened with a worldly Notion: And why do thou oppose G. F. there
for bringing his Words, who said, The Kingdom of Heaven was within the
Pharisees?

R. W. And thou runnest on and say; Sometimes it was In them, and sometimes
(thou say) it was Among them in the Streets; and make a pitiful Jumble
about Christ's Words in his saying, The Kingdom of God was within them. And
thou say, That the Kingdom of God, that is, God and Christ, and the Spirit
were literally in the Pharisees, and so in every Hyprocrite in the World etc.
though they know it not.

Answ. Did no^ thou say before, That the Kingdom of Heaven is spiritual,
inward, and a Soul-Kingdom? and that Christ said, It was within the Jews, as
thou say? And does not Christ say, That the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto
Leaven, or a Grain of Mustard Seed? and cannot this Kingdom be in the
Pharisees, except (as thou say) God and Christ must be literally in them?
-- And whereas thou say, Though the Pharisees knew it not; No more does
thou, (though it be in thee, as it was in the Pharisees) who jumblest things
together in this manner: and is this the Dividing the Word aright?

R. W. And then thou say; What Agreement is there betwixt Christ and Belial,
Light and Darkness, Righteousness and Unrighteousness?

Answ. No, there is no Agreement, nor the Spirit with the Flesh. Yet we must
not say, That the Light and Spirit is not within Man; for we do believe, thou,
that have not known this, have known little War in thy self.

R. W. And thou say; Whereas it is most improperly and impiously objected,
That the Light shines in Darkness etc.

Answ. Here thou chargest John and the Translators to be improper and impious,
not only the Quakers: here thou railest against John the Evangelist, (besides
thy Railing against the Quakers) that he speaks Impiously and Improperly; who
says, The Light shines in Darkness, and the Darkness comprehends it not.
And there thou, that abusest John and the Scripture, what are thy Words good
for?

R. W. And then thou ramblest on in thy Confusion, and say; But the Light is
at the Window, and the Eye etc; but the Eye, the Door is shut: and the Man
within is not only a sleep, but dead and rotten in Nature's Filthiness and
actual Transgressions and Abominations.

Answ. This is thy own Condition R. W. who have read it, whose Darkness cannot
comprehend the Light; but it comprehends thee in thy Darkness. But what Man
is this within, that is dead (to wit, within Man) and is rotten? how do thou
describe him? and him, that he is within? but thou, that hate the Light, then
Christ may knock at thy door, when Sin is gotten in, in thy Heart; and thou
love it better, than the Light of Christ. And John does not say, That the
Light is at the Window or Eye (as thou do) but In shines in Darkness: and
thou in thy Darkness think to give a better Meaning of John's Words, that he
himself; No, no.

R. W. Thou say; It is against all Color of Reason to imagine, that the
Lord Jesus should tell the Jews and Pharisees, and the rest of his bloody
Enemies (who some weakly, and some maliciously opposed his Kingdom and Coming
to rule by his Grace over them) that his Grace was King within them, what ever
their Hearts or Tongues said, or Hands did etc.

Answ. This is R. W's. Sense, who is confounded, as the Pharisees were with
Christ's Doctrine. And yet before he contradicts himself, and says; That the
Kingdom of Heaven was in the Pharisees, and Jews and Disciples a Spiritual,
inward and Soul-Kingdom etc: and thus he confounds himself with his own
Colors and ^easons.

R W. And thou say; It is contrary to what G. F. and his Clamor, that the
Kingdom of God consists in Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy
Spirit, as opposite to the Kingdom in the Pharisees and all Hypocrites, p. 39.
as Hell to Heaven.

Answ. And why so? why may not the Kingdom of Heaven be compared to Leaven, and
a Grain of Mustard Seed, as the Kingdom of God, which the Saints are Heirs of,
that stands in Righteousness, and Peace and Joy in the Holy Spirit? Dare
thou say, That the Kingdom of Heaven that was within the Pharisees, was of the
Nature of Hell, or as Hell to Heaven? prove this by Scripture. And where was
that Holy Ghost, that Stephen told the Jews, they did resist, as their Fathers
did? and what was that, that pricked Saul, and made him kick again? But thou
Contradictest thy self here again, to what thou say ( page 38.) That
Christ's Kingdom in the Jews, Pharisees and Disciples was an inward
Soul-Kingdom within them, thou say there R. W.

R. W. thou go on, and make a great Gust (as thou call it) but to no
purpose; and thou say, The thing is so notoriously childish and ridiculous,
that a King should affirm, He was an Actual King in his Enemies Country, where
the Whole was up in Arms against him etc.

Answ. What Childish talk is this? Is not a King a King, though the Country be
up in Arms against him? and is not Christ King, though all do not obey him? and
did not Christ shed his Blood, and dye for all Men, though all Men do not live
to him? And does not the Reign, who says, All Power in Heaven and Earth is
given to him? and the Apostle says, They that Suffer with him, shall Reign
with him, 2 Timothy 2? And do thou not wickedly charge Christ to be Notoriously
Childish and Ridiculous, for saying, The Kingdom of Heaven was within the
Pharisees? (and thou say the same, page 38.) For thou and the Pharisees
being blind, would not receive Christ, the King, to Rule in their Hearts: and
therefore says the Apostle to the Saints, Let Christ Rule in your Hearts by
Faith. -- And then thou tellest a Story of a Lamb and a Wolf, and a Man
pretending to love a Woman in the way of Marriage, and she abhors to hear of
the Motion: This thou may apply at Home. For, God so loved the World, that
he gave his only begotten Son; that whosoever believed in him, should not
perish, but have Everlasting Life.

R. W. And then thou go on, and Contradictest thy self, and say; It Is
true, the Motions of War and Love are made and offered from the King Warring
etc.

Answ. But they rejected these Commands of Christ. And then thou say; But
that this Government and Kingdom should be within them, is nothing but impious,
impudent and childish Prating. But what are thy Words to the purpose here?
Christ does not say, That he Governed in the Pharisees, as he Governed in the
Saints: but it is Wickedness in thee to say, That Christ's Words are Childish
prating, and impious, which said, The Kingdom of Heaven was within the
Pharisees, Luke 17. And this Childish prating is thy own, and Contradictest thy
self, who says, That the Kingdom of Heaven is a Spiritual, inward
Soul-Kingdom, and was in the Pharisees, Jews and Disciples: So, thou have been
Fighting against that, which thou have granted.

R. W. And thou bring Thomas Weld's Saying, [ How clear the Scripture is,
Faith comes by Hearing, and not by Minding the Light within.] And G. F. Answ.
[Doth any Man know Christ but by the Light within? And is not Christ the Word?
and can any see without Christ the Word? Does it not make manifest? nay, does
it not give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of
Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 4.) from whence Faith comes? And so, Faith comes by
Minding the Light within, Christ the Author of it; and brings to look at him,
and hear him.] Very good Truth to them that know it. -- R. W. Replyeth and
says; My Eyes have seen a poor distracted aged Woman, walking in State,
boasting of her Majesty, Jewels and Crown, with a Straw in her hand for her
Scepter. And thus this poor and mad Soul walks even like Nebuchadnezar upon his
Babel; All is Christ, and he is Christ, Christ is Faith and all.

Answ. This confused Babel thou may apply to thy own Condition, of the
Distracted Woman, for it is not ours. And let the Reader see, if he has not
abused G. F's. Answer to T. W? Does he say, All is Christ? and, He is Christ?
and, Christ is Faith? for G. F. says, Faith comes from Christ, and the Light
comes from Christ, and Christ is the Author and Finisher of it.

R. W. And thou say; He slights this so known and unquestionable Record,
Faith comes by Hearing etc, and Romans 10. concerning true Salvation, true
Worshipping, Praying, Believing, Preaching, Sending; which Holy Writing Fox
dares not seriously and impartially, and in the Fear of the most-High consider,
as to the various means and ways of God's sending unto Man.

Answ. As for God's sending unto Man, all such we own; for they Preach Christ
the Word. For the Apostle says, The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth, and
in thy Heart; and this is the Word of Faith, which we Preach: and thou
confessest, that the Lord opened Lydia's Heart, and then she received the
Word, Christ, which the Apostle Preached. But what is all this to your
Teachers, that Preach, and never were sent? and as many of you confess, you
never Heard the Voice of God and Christ from Heaven immediately? but thou have
wronged G. F's. Words, and have not set them right down, as they are in the
Book ( Folio). And can any Man believe, preach, pray or worship God, or see
their Salvation without the true Light of Christ Jesus, which comes from him,
the Word?

R. W. And thou say; For all G. F. his Scepter of Straw, his mad Fancy of
Light, that works Faith etc.

Answ. These are thy Railing Language, and abusing of G. F's. Words: for his
Words are not, Works by Faith; but Christ Jesus, who is the Author of Faith,
is the Light of the World. And then R. W. asks, p. 40.
What is Faith etc? It is (I say) the Gift of God; and thou may see, how the
Apostle describes it Heb. 11: and Christ, who dyed for the Sins of the World,
enlightneth every Man, that comes into the World, that they may believe in
him, that dyed for them. And then thou ramblest on, but to no purpose, in Reply
to G. F's. Answer.

R. W. And thou ask, What is Preaching, but a Publishing etc, or declaring,
what the Will or Mind of the King Eternal is, which he has revealed to the
Patriarchs, Moses and the Prophets from the beginning of the World? and what
did Christ Jesus declare to the Apostles, but that which Moses and the Prophets
did say should come to pass etc? and was not this Proclamation of Good News to
be made over all the World, and first at Jerusalem etc?

Answ. Who gain-sayeth this? the Quakers do not. But what is this to G F's
Answer to T. W. or to R. W. and all his Priests in New England? for did ever
they Hear the Eternal King's Voice immediately from Heaven, and Preach this
good News, as the Prophets and Apostles did, freely, as they had received
freely, to give, Act. 26. Luke 24. and as you may see in the Evangelists? But
they have gotten the Form of Godliness, and deny the Power thereof, and
persecute them, that be in the Power of Godliness.

R. W. And thou talkest of Four sorts of Hearers of the Glad News, that
received and believe with a false and overly, loose and Sandy Belief.

Answ. This is thy own Condition R. W. and the Priests in New England. And as
for those, that Receive Christ by believing in the Light, are grafted into him,
and united to God. And as for the Men of Samaria hearing the Woman, who
preached Christ to them, A Man that told her all, that ever she had done; this
may shame thee and the Priests in New England, that did not receive God's Sons
and Daughters, which Preached Christ to them, That told them all, that ever
they had done; and would have turned them and thee to Christ: and instead of
receiving them, you persecute them with Tongues and Hands.

Answ. And thou say; I know, these poor Foxians do hear a kind of a Motion
within them. [Then that is more than the Parrots, which thou speak of page
35: and so in this thou confoundest thy self.] But thou say; It is but as
poor Women, that go with False Conceptions, or with Tympanies of Wind and
Water, or with the Mole, that will resemble the Motion of a True Child: but
after all their Thoughts and Fancies by Day and Night, after all their Seeming
Feelings, Persuasions, Experience and Preparations this False Conception, False
Faith, False Christ, False Light shall vanish in shame and grief, as did Q.
Mary's after the Thanksgivings and Bell-Ringings for her Deliverance.

Answ. This is R. VV's. and the New England Priests and Professors Condition;
he knows it better, than the Quaker's Condition. For do not their Laws and
Persecutions declare it to the World, to be the Birth of the Flesh, that has
so Persecuted, Hanged and Whipped God's People, who are Born of the Spirit? Is
not their Faith proved false, and not that, which Christ is the Author of,
which works by Love? and is not their False Light, or False Christ made
manifest, who destroys Men's Lives about Religion? for the Quakers true
Christ said, he came To save Men's Lives, and bid them, Love Enemies And so R.
VV. and the New England Professors their False Birth of all their Experiences
appears to be but like a Tympany of VVind and Water (as he speaks) that
vanishes away: and all their Preparations with their Elders and Members, and
their persecuting Priests, that helped to beget this Birth, is it not all
passed away into Persecution with Tongue and Hand, and not the true Birth? and
into Grief, and Shame, and Sorrow? and did not the Indians say, That their own
God, they Professed, fought against them? And as for R. VV. bringing Q. Mary,
let them, that are concerned, answer for that: and thou art not to Speak Evil
of the Dead.

R. W. And whereas thou say; ( For my self) I dare these Self-Confident to
particularize any one Scripture, where the Spirit of God directs any poor Soul
to listen or hearken to a Light and Voice within him, affirming, that this is
the Hearing, by which Faith is wrought etc? I ask for some Solid Instances,
where Souls have been truly Converted (the whole Soul unto God) by any such
Notion; p. 41.
and not by some External Means, and out-ward Hearing of this Glad News and
Gospel.

Answ. In this thou have showed thy Ignorance of the Scriptures, and the Holy
Men of God Conditions. For did not the Jews hear the External Means and outward
Hearing of Christ and his Apostles, and yet were not Converted to God? Now, we
Challenge thee, and all the New England Priests, Where ever any one was
Converted to God by an Outward and External Hearing, to answer this by plain
Scripture? And whereas thou have said, Listening to the Light; but our Words are
commonly Take heed to the Light (as the Apostle does) until the Day dawn, and
the Day Star arise in your Hearts: and was not the Light the Means to take heed
unto? And what External Means had Abraham, that saw the Day of Christ and his
Gospel? and what External Means had Moses, when God spoke to him, or Outward
Hearing of Man's Preaching to him? And what External Means had Mary Magdalen
and other Women, when the Lord sent them to Preach the Resurrection? And what
External Means had Daniel, when he Heard the Voice of God? and was not this
Voice of God within? though we deny none, that God and Christ speaks to and
sends. But did not the Word come to Jacob? and was not that the Author of
his Faith? and was not he Converted? and did not all the Holy Men of God speak,
as they were Moved by the Holy Ghost? And does not Christ say, He that has an
Ear, let him hear, what the Spirit says to the Churches? and is that an
Outward Hearing or External? And does not the Apostle say; No Man knows the
things of God but by the Spirit of God, which Reveals them? and does not
Christ thank his Father for Revealing his things to his Disciples, and hid them
from such Wise, as you are? And can any come to Christ, but whom the Father
draws? and is that by an External and Outward Hearing? And does not the Lord
say, He opens the Mouth of Babes etc? And did not the Lord open Lydia's
Heart, to hear Christ, that Paul Preached, who was a Minister of the Spirit?
and did not he and the Apostles Sow to the Spirit? and was that an Outward and
External Means? And does not the Lord say, He will put his Laws in their Minds,
and write them in their Hearts; and he will be their God, and they shall be his
People: and they shall not teach every Man his Neighbor, and every Man his
Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me from the Least to
the Greatest, says the Lord: and is this your External Means (in New England)
and Outward Hearing, who persecute the Children of the New- Covenant, (that are
Taught of God) for not following of you?

R. W. And thou say: I ask, if it be not a Ridiculous Contradiction, to fill
the World with a Sound of their New He- and She- Apostles?

Answ. We say, Nay, who are sent of God, and have heard God and Christ's Voice,
as the Prophets and Apostles did. And you, who are feeding of your External
Means of your Outward Hearing, and hate the Light of Christ, and are Erred from
the Spirit, that gave forth the Scriptures, persecute us, as your Forefathers
did Christ and his Apostles.

R. W. And thou say; I ask, if this Light within (without and opposite to
the Hearing without, which is the Question) be the Means of Faith, how is it
possible, that so many serious, enquiring Men in all Ages should not per^eive a
Breath of this VVind, no, not in their own Bosoms? and that Famous Paul should
be Conscientiously and fully persuaded, that he ought to do many things against
Christ Jesus?

Answ. Have not thou here manifested thy Ignorance again? for the Light of
Christ within is not opposite to the Ministers of the Spirit, and such, as turn
them from Darkness to Light etc. And the Apostles bid the Saints, Look unto
Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their Faith, not unto them: and is not He the
Word, the Apostles Preached, and told them, it was nigh in their Hearts to
hear it and do it? And Moses describes the Righteousness of the Law etc: but
the Apostle says, The Righteousness of Faith, which speaks on this wise
(mark, Speaks) say not in thy Heart, who shall ascend into Heaven? that is,
to bring Christ down from above; or who shall descend into the deep? that is,
to bring Christ from the Grave etc: but what says it? The Word is nigh thee
in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth; and this is the Word of Faith which we Preach.
Now mark, the Apostle Preached the Word of Faith in Peoples Hearts and Mouths;
and was not this Word in Abraham's Mouth? and Jacob's Mouth? and Moses Mouth?
and the Prophet's Mouth? and do thou say, Enquiring Men in all Ages should
not perceive a Breath of this Wind? and because thou and the Priests in
New England do not perceive a Breath of it, therefore thou judge others, like
thy self. And how could all the Prophets see Christ without the Light, which
was Life in the Word, by which all things were made? -- And whereas the Apostle
says, How should they hear without a Preacher, and how should he Preach,
except he be sent; what is this to your Preachers, that never Heard the Voice
of God, and run, when God never sent them? And the Apostle says, But have they
not all heard? (mark) yes verily etc: so, Then (says the Apostle) Faith comes
by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God. And Paul, who was fully persuaded,
he ought to do many things against Christ Jesus etc; showing, that he had heard
of Christ with his External Ears and outward Means, and had heard the Prophets,
that spoke of Christ; yet was a Persecutor of Christ in his Members in his
False Conception, like thee, and the Priests in New England. And though Paul
heard Steven's Sermon, yet he was not Converted; but at his Conversion Christ
told him, It was hard to kick against that, which had pricked him: for Christ
knew, what had pricked him, that made him kick again, when he was a Persecutor
of Christ in his Members, like R. W. and the New England Priests and
Professors: and it is the way of the Persecutors about Religion, to kick
against that, which pricketh them.

R. W. And thou say; Therefore it is Grace, that does All; and yet thou
say; This is something, but reaches not home, [but what this something is,
thou have not told the World.] And thou say; If all Men in the world have
this Light, (which is sufficient without Hearing) why should not some
(especially the Wise and Enquirers etc.) perceive it, or something of it? as
Paul did not, until he heard something (and because God had a purpose to make
an Extraordinary Use of him) etc.

Answ. What is this to R. W. and the New England Priests, who are Strangers to
this Work? And Christ, who enlightneth every Man, that comes into the world,
he says; Learn of me etc: and God says; This is my beloved Son, HEAR YE HIM.
Yea, the Saints heard the Apostles, which were Ministers of the Spirit; but was
the Apostle therefore the Author of their Faith, and Finisher? or, were the
Apostles the Word, which they Preached? And as for thy Wise and Enquirers, some
ask and have not, because they ask amiss: but as Christ Enlightneth every Man,
that comes into the sworld; so, if they do not hate the Light, in that Light
they will ^ee more Light, and see Christ, their full Satisfaction. And thou
say, It is Grace, that does All: If so, what do the Scriptures and the
Teachers do then? which are thy only Sword, Weapon, Rule etc; and thy outward
Means, which thou have been busying thy self about? -- But R. W. the Scripture
says, Grace and Truth comes by Jesus Christ, which shed his Blood, and tasted
Death for every Man: and this Grace of God, which brings Salvation, has
appeared to all Men; and God said to Paul, It was Sufficient. So, it is
Sufficient to Teach People, and bring their Salvation, if they do not turn it
into Wantonness, and walk despitefully against the spirit of Grace: and such
are not like (though they do enquire) to perceive, that deny that, which they
should perceive withal.

R. W. And thou bring T. P. saying, [ To say, the Officers of the Church are
Invisible, it is plain of their Father the Devil]. G. F. Answ. to T. P. and
says, [The Holy Ghost made the Officers of the Church Overseers; and that made
the Officers the Overseers to be Invisible. For they saw with an Invisible Eye,
and so, they were in the Spirit, which is Invisible, and not in the Flesh, else
they could not be Overseers in the Church of God: and you are the Visible
Apostatized from them]. -- And R. W. replyeth, and says; This is one of the
most impudent Fooleries, that either Fox or (as the Proverb is) any Dog could
be impudent in.

Answ. Here you may see, how R. W. begins with Railing Language, which he
had better applied to his own Spirit, which comes from it: but he has not
proved out of the Holy Scripture his Lying Proverb.

R. W. And thou say, G. F. acknowledges a public Assembly of Christians, as
well as of other pretending worshippers Turks, Jews etc. and also he
acknowledges the Ministers, p. 42.
Officers and Overseers of their Assemblies.

Answ. Does G. F. here mention the Overseers made by the Holy Ghost of the
Turks and Jews, but them in the Apostles days? why do thou abuse his Words?

R. W. And thou say, G. P's. Reason is notoriously silly and impudent: why?
Because G. F. says, The Church is in God, and the Overseers are made by the
Holy Ghost.

Answ. Does not the Apostle say, The Overseers were made by the Holy Ghost?
and, the Church was in God, as Act. 20, 28, and These. 1? and is this Doctrine
of the Apostles notoriously silly and impudent? why? because you are not in the
same Holy Ghost, and your Church is not in God, as theirs was.

R. W. And thou say; Are the Secrets of God always secret, and never to be
Revealed? the Child in the Womb, the precious Stones etc. when brought forth,
are no more Invisible, than the Sun in the Firmament.

Answ. Were not the Children in the Womb, or precious Stones Invisible, before
they were brought forth in themselves? how proves R. W. and the New England
Priests that to be like unto the things of God? The Secrets of God are Revealed
by his Spirit, which is Invisible: and so, they are Secrets to them still, to
whom they are not Revealed by the same Spirit. And this Spirit, that does
Reveal the things of God, does make them Overseers.

R. W. And thou say; The Christian Profession and Professors, how-ever they
were wrought and prepared, and by diverse Means by God's Spirit; yet etc.

Answ. But what these diverse Means are, R. W. has not told the World. But what
is this in opposition, that the Holy Ghost made not Overseers in the Church in
the Apostles days? it is nothing to that.

R. W. And thou say; Yet the Lord Jesus Christ compares them to the most
Visible, Conspicuous, and Glorious Things and Persons, to the Sun and Moon in
the Heavens, and the Heavens and Stars also; to Mountains and Cities etc. and
to Kings, their Houses and Palaces etc.

R. W. What is all this to oppose the Apostle's Doctrine, and say, The Holy
Ghost did not make them Overseers? which is the Consequence of R. W's.
Jangling. For we do grant, what the Lord Jesus Christ does compare his Holy
People to in Scriptures; but that is not thy State.

R. W. And thou say; Although the Lord Mayor of London, and the several
Officers of the City are not made and ordained in the public Streets; nor
Generals etc. are they not therefore Visible etc.

Answ. What a Story is this! who opposes thee in this? who says, They are not
Visible? But what is this to oppose the Apostle's Doctrine still, who said, The
Holy Ghost ( that is Invisible) made them Overseers? Will R. W. say, It is the
Holy Ghost, that makes all Mayors, and Generals, and Officers, which are
Visible Officers by Visible Commissioners? else what does he bring this
Comparison for? The Work of Christ's Overseers is Spiritual; it is with a
Spiritual Eye and a Spiritual Discerning, and by a Spiritual Power, and to
watch over the Invisible Spirits of People, the Souls of Men and Women.

R. W. It is most true etc. that the Church is in God: [and then thou
Contradictest thy self, and say,] And is it not also true in one Sense
[that, is, thy Sense, not the Apostle's 1 Thessalonians.] We live in God, and move in
God, and have our being in God etc.

Answ. What Roger! one while a Church, and not in God, and yet Live in him, and
move in him, as thou confessest? Thou say, The whole Creation is Gloriously
Visible. Who says to the contrary of that, which is Outward?

R. W. And thou say; The Saints, their Assemblies and Officers are in God
Visible to the world etc. though in an Heavenly Spiritual Sense, transcending
the being of the Creation.

Answ. And yet R. W. brings J. M. to Contradict himself; [in his Append. page
21.] and says; The Wise Heathen- Philosophers had a greater measure of Light
in them ( which is the first Adam) than any I can find now. And R. W. opposes
G. F. for setting up Christ the Second Adam, and his New Covenant, and his New
Creatures above the First Adam and the Heathen-Philosophers; and now [ in his
42 Page] he confesses, This transcends the being of the First Creation: Why
did thou oppose G. F. then ( in thy 21 Page) and there Contradict, what thou
say in page 42? But where does the Scripture say, That the Saints, and their
Assemblies and Officers are in God Visible? for God is a Spirit, and they that
are joined to the Lord, and are in the Lord, it must be by the Spirit: for none
knows his things, but by his Spirit, that is Invisible. And G. F. never
denied, that the Bodies of the Saints and Officers, and Assemblies were Visible
now, and in the Apostles days, and they were and are to be seen with Visible
Eyes; or else how could they have been persecuted in the Apostles days, and in
New England? if you had not seen Quakers there, you could not have Hanged them.
-- And thou say; It is most true and most sweet; that the Church is in God:
yet again, G. F's. Reason is notoriously Silly and Impudent, [because he says
to the Priest, R. W. defends, that the Church is in God:] So Roger, put thy
Words together and see, what Sense thou can make of them?

R. W. Thou say; Yea, G. F. and his etc. for all their being in God, and
some of their proud and silly Answerings in Courts, that they Live in God, and
Dwell in God etc.

Answ. See R. W's. Contradiction before in the same page, where he says; We
live in God, and move in God, and have our Being in God etc: we must not now
confess this (that he just now owned) without being called Proud and Silly. But
why! must not we tell, where our Living and Being is, before your Courts? and
are not they Silly and Proud (as thou speak) and live not in God, that
cannot endure to hear People tell you, where their Living and Being is? And yet
thou say; They disown not their own Visible Congregations etc. Why should
they disown their Visible Assemblies, or Teachers, or Overseers? which are
gathered together in the Name of Jesus, and are Ministers of the Spirit; and
are made Overseers by the Holy Ghost, that is Invisible: and their Singing and
Praying in the Spirit they own. As for those Audible Performances thou speak
of, the Saints perform their Worship, Praying, Preaching etc. by the Spirit: is
the Spirit and Truth Visible, in which God is worshipped? let R. W. and all the
Priests prove that by Scripture, if they can.

R. W. And thou say; Why does this poor notoriously Visible Cheater thus
prate of Invisibilities, especially in times of Peace and not in Elias his
Case? p. 43.


Answ. What! must they not talk of Faith, by which the Invisible God is seen?
nor the Word of God, which was made Flesh, by which all things were made? nor
talk of the Holy Ghost, which made Overseers? And did not the Apostle say, Ye
are not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit, (Romans 8, 9.) and yet all these were
upon the Earth? but thou art dark, not knowing the things of God. But you
Professors, that prate so much of Visibility, are Invisible enough at Times,
running away and flying your Testimony: but the things that are seen, that are
Temporal, your striving is in: and so thou pleadst for Visibility. And though
we are for God's Invisible things, against your Carnal envious Minds; yet, have
we not been visible in Trials and Persecutions? did we hide from you?

R. W. And thou bringst M. Bine, which says [ The Scriptures may be understood
by the Help of Tongues.] And G. F. Answ. [All Scriptures were given forth by
Inspiration: and so without the same Inspiration it is not understood. Again,
Pilate had the Scriptures and Tongues, and yet did not understand the
Scriptures nor Christ the Substance of them: and this you have set up since the
Apostasy, your Tongues, you Raveners from the Spirit.] -- R. W. replyeth and
says, That G. F. confesses, that every Syllable or Title in the Scripture is
the Word, or immediately revealed Will of God, against his and the Quakers
common Song, has God any more Words than one?

Answ. Does G. F. speak these Words in his Answer? did ever G. F. or any called
Quakers deny, but the Scripture was given forth by Inspiration, and was
Revealed from God and Christ to his Prophets and Apostles, which were the
Words of God and Christ, and he the Word? And, Thou shall not kill, and steal
etc. was not that Revealed to Moses, and the Words of God? for Christ says; I
am the Door, and, I am the Bread of Life; he does not say, That he is an
outward Door, or outward Bread, that is made of Corn. And was not the Promise
of God Revealed, and his Commands? and must they not be known by the same
Spirit, to answer them in Man etc?

R. W. And thou say; I observe, the end of G. F. ( and especially of the old
Fox and Serpent that acts him) is, to destroy the coming of God's Holy Records
and Writings to poor lost Men to their Salvation.

Answ. Are the VVritings to Salvation to lost Men? is not Christ their
Salvation? May not the Devil and the Pharisees have the VVritings, and yet be
Enemies to Christ the Salvation? did not the Jews think to have Life in the
Scriptures, which testified of Christ, and would not come to him, that they
might have Life and Salvation? And do not thou say (in the same Page) That G.
F. confesses, how all Scripture was given forth etc; and now, do thou
Contradict thy self, and say; His end is, to destroy the Scriptures? No, no;
We love the Scriptures: and thou might have kept all thy bad Words at Home.
-- And thou say; He may foist and whisp in, what his Hellish Malice pleases
to their Damnation. -- Roger, this is thy own Condition, and not the Quakers,
as thy Lies have manifested.

R. W. And whereas thou say; If no Knowledge of the Tongues, in which the
Most-wise, Holy Lord penned his Letters or Writings to us, then no Preaching of
the Doctrine in them to the world without some New miraculous way, then no
Translating and Reading of them, which is, that the Devil in all Ages and at
this day aims at with all his might.

Answ. Does G. F. deny Tongues in themselves here, which are natural things?
and what must be inferred from thy Words, but that Men may understand the
Scriptures with Natural Tongues? then I query; How was it, that the Pharisees,
and the Grecians, and all other Languages did not understand them? and how is
it, that Christ says, He thanketh the Father, that he has revealed these
things unto Babes? And the Apostle says, No Man knows the things of God, but
by the Spirit: and G. F's Answer is, That all Scripture was given forth by
Inspiration; so without the same Inspiration it is not known: and if this be to
deny the Scripture, let the Righteous judge. And as for all thy bad Words here
against us, thou might have kept them at home.

R. W. And whereas thou say; I charge upon this proud Ignoramus, and all his
blind Disciples etc. the horrible Crime of Unthankfulness and Ingratitude; for
were it not for Tindal burnt to Ashes, and other Heavenly Spirits set on work
from Heaven to dig out the Knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, and turn it into
French, p. 44.
Dutch and English etc, how should these Seraphical Doctors know, whether there
were such a Creation of Heaven and Earth, and a Man and his Wife, which we
talk of.

Answ. Do thou not Contradict thy self (in thy 22 Page), when Plato grants
a Creation, and a kind of Father and Son, where thou set up the
Heathen-Philosophers? and do thou not say, what Aristotle confesses of the
Godhead? and what Scripture had they? and do thou not say, Thou find in
all Mankind a Conviction of the Eternal Power and Godhead? And does not the
Apostle say, He understood by Faith, the World was made or framed by the Word
of God, Heb. 11? and does not John say the same Joh. 1? And is not God the same
now to his People in Christ, as he was to Moses? and does he teach his People
in the New Covenant short of Moses? And as for thy Charge of Unthankfulness
etc. keep it to thy self: for we can praise the Lord for the Scriptures, and
such as honest Tindal, that did translate them; who was burnt and persecuted by
the same Bloody Murdering Spirit of New England, that killed our Friends. But
what have thou to do with W. Tindal? hear him in our Defense against thee and
thy Brethren, saying: It is impossible to understand in the Scriptures more
than a Turk, for who-so-ever has not the Law of God writ in his Heart to
fulfill it. Again: Without the Spirit it is Impossible to understand them ( W.
Tindal's Works p. 319, p. 80). What is this, if People have the Scriptures in
all the Languages, and yet oppose that, which must lead them into the Truth of
them, or inspire them to know them? and though they have the Scriptures in all
Languages, can any know Adam and Eve's State in Paradise, except they be
brought thither by Christ? And it is true, they may have an outward Knowledge by
reading of Adam and Eve etc; but in this thou confoundest thy self, and say,
A Parrot may talk of Heaven and Hell, and the Grace, and so, may not a Parrot
be taught to talk of Adam and Eve? (read thy 33 Page). And then R. W. tells
of a Question put to a Soul, and the dreadful end of that Party; but he has
particularized no body: so, it is like the rest of his Stories.

R. W. And then thou chargest the Quakers with Laziness, because they do not
study the Original Language themselves, saying; It is a shameful Trade, and
deceitful, when Persons have money in their hands, to take up all on Trust. And
further thou say, I never knew any of these Foxians so inclined; but
according to the Lazy Fool under the Fig Tree etc.

Answ. R. W. Contradicts himself: he says, ( page 43.) John Stubs vapour'd
and said; He understood as many Languages as I: [and in another place] That he
understood the Greek, Hebrew, and Latin. And the Quakers have their Schools,
that teach all these Naturals: but what is all this to know Christ and the
things of God, which are Revealed by his Spirit? And Christ says, Flesh and
Blood had not revealed him to Peter, but his Father: and was not Peter's and
the Jews Language Hebrew, that opposed Christ? And as for all thy foul Words,
thou might have kept them at Home* for they are not worth Answering. But we
challenge R. W. and all the New England Priests to prove by Scripture,
wherever Christ or his Apostles charged one of their Believers with the
Horrible Crime of Laziness, for not studying the Original Languages, as the
means, by which they might know the Scriptures and Christ, without the
Revelation of Christ and his Spirit?

R. W. And thou say; I judge, that G. F. with his Wild Spirit cannot prove,
that Pilate had the Hebrew, Greek and Latin.

Answ. That is not the Matter in hand: for G. F. his proof was, That the
Scriptures are known again by the same Inspiration: and that is thy part and
the New England Priests, to disprove, that Pilate had not the Hebrew, Greek and
Latin, which he caused to be set up upon Christ, when he Crucified him.

R. W. And thou say; Thou knows, that the Devil abounds in Tongues, and can
speak all Languages; and I know and have seen his Inspirations, Three thousand
Verses, in a show very Heavenly inspired by him, by an English Woman of this
Country.

Answ. But what this English Woman is, thou have not named in thy long Story of
her. And it is like, thou art more acquainted with the Devil and his Works, than
with Divine Inspiration: and if he knows all Languages, what is this in
opposition to G. F, that says, The Scripture is known by the same Inspiration,
that gave them forth? But I believe, the Devil and thee art little acquainted
with this Inspiration; if thou werest, thou would not give G. F. so much foul
Language, that holds it forth. And it is like, this Woman thou speak of,
is one of your own People; for if she had been a Quaker, we should have had her
Name in Print before now. And the Apostles were Inspired by the Holy Ghost with
Tongues: and if the Lord should Inspire any now, I question not, but you would
say, It was of the Devil. But we charge thee and the New England Priests, to
show us by Scripture, where Christ or his Apostles commanded to set up Schools,
and to Study Tongues and Languages, and then go to Preach? for the Scripture
says, That they had sometimes Interpreters (as 1 Cor. 14): and if they had
not, they were to be silent.

R. W. And whereas thou say; Thou art sure, that we talk (like little
Children) without the least Knowledge at all (generally) of any thing but the^r
Mother English; p. 45.
and yet so proudly and imperiously vapouring and triumphing etc: and yet thou
say; I perceive, that John Stubs was a Scholar; and had Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin; [He was a Quaker, that disputed with thee.]

Answ. And what Contradictions are these R. W! And what can thou tell, what
they do in their grave Consultations? what does Roger make himself here? But
what is all this as knowing the Scriptures again by Inspiration? and the
Quakers can praise God, for what they are through his Grace. -- And then thou
tellest a Story of Theora John, and say; The Quaker's Inspirations are like
unto his: Nay, this thou might have kept at home; for we own no Inspiration,
but by the sam Holy Ghost that gave forth Scriptures.

R. W. And thou say; G. F. is no wiser in affirming, that the Tongues came
in place ^f the Spirit since the Apostasy: for before the Apostasy the Lord
furnished his Servants with the Understanding of several Languages
miraculously; and with the Apostasy those Heavenly miraculous Gifts ceased.

Answ. And therefore you have studied the Tongues in the Apostasy, and set them
up in place of the Spirit: but are not the Gifts of the Spirit known again out
of the Apostasy? And is Inspiration known by studying Natural Languages? and
what is this to the purpose of the Apostles knowing Tongues by Inspiration? G.
F. opposes not that; by which Inspiration they gave forth Scriptures: which
Inspiration makes wise. And thou confessest, The Devil can speak all
Languages: so if you study to know all Languages, they are but Natural things,
and are you any thing wiser with your Natural Languages than he? for can any
know the Prophet's, and Christ's and the Apostle's Words, and Christ, but by
Revelation of the Holy Spirit and Inspiration -- the things of God?

R. W. And thou say; In the Apostasy the Father of Spirits gave to his Two
Witnesses Power, and Authority, and Ability etc.

Answ. But prove this out of the Revelations, that the Lord Commanded them to
set up Schools and Colleges to learn Languages to set up Ministers: for the
Papists (that thou speak of) had Schools and Colleges to make Ministers,
before Calvin and Luther rose; and so have you. And as for the true Protestants
and Martyrs, that suffered Persecution (as we have done by the same Spirit of
New England) we own all those true Protestants* and how the Lord upheld them in
their Testimony: and this is nothing to you Pro^essors of New England, who are
found like these Foxes and Popish Spirits, worrying the Lambs, and speaking
evi^ of things you know not.

R. W. And thou say; Thou will not discourage the weak^st English Man or
Woman (in Christian Humility) to sound forth the Praise of God in Writing,
Speaking and Printing in English, what they have Experimented of the Son of God
etc: And then thou Contradictest thy self, and have been speaking against
He-Apostles and She-Apostles of the Quakers, speaking by the same Spirit: and
thou say; But when they lift up their Horns on high ( or their Brutish
Ears, as Foxes do, instead of Horns) then I must tell G. F, that although he
prattles amongst the English, and they be cheated with his dying Spirit etc.

Answ. As for Cheating and dying Spirit, R. W. may keep at home, with the
Brutish Ears thou speak of, and his and the New England Men's Horns. For it
is with the Holy Spirit of God, that we do exalt the Horn of our Salvation;
through which Spirit we have had Experience of his Son, and of his Light,
Faith, and Mercy and Grace manifested to us: and this we have been moved of the
Lord to Speak, Write and Print; which has made the dark Spirit in thee and
the New England Priests to rage and persecute. And it was not a Simple
Pretending (as thou scoffingly say) of some of our going to the Turk and
Pope; but a Motion of God, whether they will hear or forbear. But R. W. may
Rail against them behind their Backs in his Tongues and Languages, but before
their Faces he dare not show his Face: and therefore the Laz^ Spirit he had
better applied at Home.

R. W. And then thou say; They must either be furnished with the Gifts of
Tongues Miraculously etc; or else they must fling off their Lazy Devil, and
Study the Tongues of other Nations, to whom they carry their (pretended) Glad
News.

Answ. Is the Devil Lazy, and can speak all Languages, as R. W. says? Must the
Quakers study the Tongues to Preach the Glad News? and what, if they have them
already? Did none speak by Interpreters? read 1 Cor. 14. And what, if they can
speak all these Tongues, and be out of the Spirit of Inspiration, that gave
forth Scriptures, and Reveals the Son, it would but bring People into a Form,
like the New England Professors and others, and to speak of Heaven, and Hell,
and Grace (as thou say) like the Parrot (in thy 35 Page). So, compare this
with thy 45 Page and see, what a great rambling thou have made against G. F.'s.
Words to no purpose, who says, [The Scripture must be known by the same
Inspiration, that gave them forth]; and for all thou have said, thou have not
disproved it. And the Glad News of Christ and his Gospel was and is Preached by
his Spirit: for the false Christ's and Wolves may get the Sheeps-cloathing, as
you Priests have done, and have worryed the Lambs in New England.

R. W. Brings M. Bines ( fol. 86.) saying [ Notwithstanding thy passing
through the First and Second Resurrection (as he says) there remains a Torment
for thee at the last Day, p. 46.
and Woe. And G. F. Answ. [They are blessed, that have Part in the First
Resurrection, the Second Death has no Power over them; but are made free from
Wrath that is to come, and are passed from Death to Life: and are translated
into the Kingdom of the Son of God; and are in Union with the Son of God and
the Father both]. R. W. replyeth and says; G. F. arrogates to himself and his
Foxians, a passing through the First and Second Resurrection; he triumphs in
their Blessedness pronounced to their First Resurrection, viz. of Communion
with God, and Freedom from Wrath to come.

Answ. The Reader may see, how R. W. falsely applies the Priest's Words to G.
F, which speaks of the First and Second Resurrection: but does G. F. mention
the Word of passing through the Second Resurrection? For does not John say in
the Revelations (and is it Arrogance in him?) Blessed and Holy is he that has
part in the First Resurrection, on such the Second Death has no Power; for
they are Priests of God etc, ( Revel. 20)? And does not the Apostle say ( Romans
5, 9,) We shall be saved from Wrath through him (to wit, Christ etc)? and,
Thanks be to Jesus, which has delivered us from Wrath to come (1 Thessalonians. 1,
10)? and ( Chap. 5, 9) God has not appointed us to Wrath? And the Saints had
Fellowship with the Father and the Son (1 John 1)?

And R. W. says; That G. F. is in his Borough of Words of diverse
Significations etc. Nay Roger, G. F's. Words are plain; and thou art in thy
Borough, that see them not. And then thou say; G. F. wrests and winds,
what is for his wicked Ends. This is false, and thy own Condition; and wherein
does he wrest, when he speaks plain Scripture?

R. W. And thou say; You shall never take him in distinguishing and
defining, what is the First and Second Death, and what is the First and Second
Resurrection.

Answ. What need he, when John has plainly de^ined and distinguished it in his
Revelations?

R. W. And thou say; The Truth is, as soon as they hearken to this Familiar
Spirit, they are so elevated, that they be in Heavenly Glory: the Resurrection
is past, and ( with K. Agag's Dream) the Bitterness of Death and Wrath is past
for ever with them.

Answ. This thou might have applied at home, with thy Familiar Spirit, thou
speak of. And do thou not here again abuse G. F's. Words? does he say
here, That the Resurrection is past? and are they not the Priest's M. B's.
Words of Passing through the First and Second Resurrection? But where does the
Scripture say, They that have part in the First Resurrection, there remains a
Torment for such at the last day and VVo, as the Priest says? thou should
have made this good by Scripture. And as for the Thorns and Thistles, thou
may keep them at home, which grow in thy own Nature.

R. W. And thou say; If we talk of Escaping Wrath to come, and of Enjoying
Blessedness, we must prove it to others, as well as to our selves.

Answ. Roger, thou and the New England Professors have no more Ears to hear it,
than the Jews had to hear Christ and his Apostles, who said, Chirst had a
Devil: and Paul was a Babbler, and a Pestilent Fellow.

R. W. And thou tellest us; That the Expectation of the Jews and the Mahometans
expecting a Catnal Blessedness to come, is false: and We must prove, Papists
and Common Protestants ( for all their Prayers and Alms etc.) are under that
Sentence, Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniquity.

Answ. Thou did very well Roger, to confess thy self ( at last) to be One of
them; and we do believe, thou have spoken forth thy own Sentence. But do thou
believe, that none of the Papists and Common Protestants will repent? and Jews
and Mahometans? Cold Charity, Roger!

R. W. And thou say; The Lord Jesus being asked about the great Point of
Salvation, he seems to answer two things, 1. That the Most will hang their
Souls upon the Hedge, and venture like the Highways and Hedges etc.

Answ. We do charge R. W. and the rest of the Priests in New England to make
this good by Scripture, where ever Christ said, They hanged their Souls upon
Hedges, and ventured like the Highways ways and Hedges? or else acknowledge,
thou have abused Christ's words, as well as G. F's.

R. W. And thou say; Some will endeavor to seek to enter (I judge) both
^ews, Mahometans, Pagans, Papists and Protestants, and shall not be able.

Answ. And why did thou not put in thy self and the persecuting Professors
in New England? And why shall they not enter? is it not, because they do not
believe in the Light, as Christ commands? therefore they do not Enter into
the Rest because of Unbelief (as in Hebrews)?

R. W. And thou say Of such, as are sensible of the Narrowness of the Way,
and Streightness of the Door, and the Infinite Necessity incumbing, p. 47.
and the Infinite Excellency inviting, that fling away Preferments, Profits and
Pleasures, and choose to enjoy the Mediator, as lost and damned in our selves,
and follow him from his Cradle and Manger to his Cross and Gallowses, and
laboring to draw other poor drowning Souls out of the Pit of Eternal
Rottenness and Howling with us.

Answ. If R. W. and the New England Professors were in this, as he says, he
and and they would never have been so Envious (as they have been) against the
People called Quakers; for R. W's. Words, and the New England Priests and
Professors Actions give them the Lie. For he is persecuting God's People with
his Tongue, and desires, they may be punished: and the others have Hanged them
upon their Gallowses, and Banished and Whipped, and Spoiled Goods. And if this be
a Spirit, that follows Christ in his Cross, in his Straight way from his
Manger, and Cradle and Cross to the Gallowses, who rebuked them, that would
have had Men's Lives destroyed; and told them, They knew not, what Spirit they
were of, and said, He comes not to destroy Men's Lives, but to save them; let
all the Sober Christians judge.

R. W. And thou say; The Spirit of God tells us of three sorts of perished
Souls, 1. Those without the Law, of which are Millions of Millions innumerable.
And yet thou say ( Append. p. 28.) There is generally in all Mankind in the
world a Conviction of an Invisible, and Omnipotent and Eternal Power and
Godhead; and thou find, all Men will confess, that the Mind of God is pure
etc. that it was ever and is wickedness, to sin against it. All Mankind having
the Law etc.

Answ. How stand these together Roger, and with Rom 1, and 2, which thou
say, The Spirit of God tells thee, that those without the Law are Millions
of Millions innumerable? For if thou meanest the Outward written Law, whether
that of God in the Gentiles was not one with it, which did the things contained
in the Law?

R. W. And then thou say; 2. Such as had the Law and Will of God revealed
to them in the Covenant of Work etc. 3. Of such, to whom Infinite Pity has
vouchsafed the Joyful Tidings of the Son of God his Mediation and Intercession
etc.

Answ. Art not thou and the New England Professors like unto the Jews, that had
the Law of God, and did it not? that have the Joyful Tidings of the Son of God,
his Mediation and Intercession etc. who dyed for Enemies, and ye persecute his
Friends, like the Jews, that persecuted the Prophets, that had the Law? But
what is all this to G. F's Words, [Blessed are they, that have part in the
First Resurrection]? thou have gone beside the Matter, which thou took in hand
to reply to; for thou find fault with G. F. for not defining and
distinguishing, what the First and Second Death is; and yet thou have not done
it thy self.

R. W. And thou tellest us of a Story of the Papists, and Protestants against
the Papists etc.

Answ. This thou might very well applied to thy self and the Professors in
New England, that are crying against the Bloody Papists, and ye have been as
Bloody in this Age, as they.

R. W. And thou say; These Quakers pretend the Highest, but no otherwise,
then Thou O Capernaum, which art exalted etc. And thou say; Tire and Sidon,
Sodom and Gomorrah, and the poor Jews and Mahometans, yea the Papists and
Common Protestants shall have an easier Cup to drink, than these (thou here and
often elsewhere call Foxians) that are so high, pure and lofty, yet abound
with Luciferian Filthiness.

Answ. R. W, as thou Judge, thou will be Judged; thou would have it so: but
none of these things thou have proved, but misapplyed Christ's Words; which is
to thy self. And as for Capernaum, Tire, Sidon and Sodom etc. it may be well
said to thee and the New England Professors, who would neither hear Christ nor
his Servants, but slew them. And as for our Cup, trouble not thy self with it,
who know the Cup of Christ's Suffering, and the Cup of Salvation; who learn of
Christ to be Meek and Low, and to deal truly with Hypocrites. And as for
Luciferian Filthiness, thou might have kept that at home. And Christ does
teach and exhort, and makes his People Clean by his Blood; and they can praise
God for it, though thou scoffest at God's Work and them: and we know, that
Christ has taught thee none of this foul Language.

R. W. And thou bringst M. Bines (Fol. G. F. p. 89.) saying [The Saints are
neither in the Fullness of the Godhead, nor in part; away with this Blasphemy,
that says, this is]. G. F. Answ. The Work of the Ministry was, To bring People
to the Knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect Man; to the Unity of the
Faith, to the Measure and Stature of the Fullness of Christ; and Christ would
dwell in the Saints, and God would dwell in them. And thou say, They have no
part of the Fullness of the Godhead; but John says, Of his Fullness we all have
received, in whom dwells the Godhead bodily. And ye be all in the Blasphemy,
that be out of this part of his Fulness]. R. W. replyeth to G. F. and says; It
was an Horrible Crime, which the Jews, though maliciously and falsely objected
against the Lord Jesus, that he being a Man makes himself God.

Answ. Who denies this, but the Jews did so? and what is this to the purpose?
but was Christ ever the worse for their Blasphemy? or his Servants the worse
for thy Railing against them, and for New England Professor's persecuting of
them?

R. W. And whereas thou say; What shall we say to these Brutish,
Blasphemous vile Worms of the Earth, Yesterday creeping out of their Holes,
Slaves, Hell Hounds (as we all by Nature are) so horribly to set their Faces
(as David speaks) against the Heavens, p. 48.
vapouring themselves to be in the Godhead, and that also Bodily: so that what
was applicable to the Body of the Son of God, is proper and applicable unto
them etc.

Answ. Let the Reader read G. F's. Answer and see, if there be any Color for
him to forge these Words, That which was applicable to the Son of God, we
should take to our selves? Or, is there any thing, that G. F. says, The Saints
are in the Fullness of the Godhead? but as the Apostle said, What was the Work
of their Ministry, which was for the perfecting of the Saints etc. and the
Edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and
the Knowledge of the Son of God, and unto a Perfect Man, and unto the Measure
of the Stature and Fullness of Christ. And John says (1 John 16.) Of his
Fullness have we received Grace for Grace. And the Apostle speaking of Christ
says; He has put all things under his Feet, who gave him to be Head over all
things to the Church, which is his Body, the Fullness of him, that fills all
in all: And the Apostle says; To know the Love of Christ, which passes
Knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the Fullness of God ( Ephesians. 1, 23;
and 3, 19) And the Apostle says; In him (to wit, Christ) dwells all the
Fullness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are complete in him, which is the Head
etc. ( Coloss. 2, 9): was the Apostle a Blasphemer, and a Hell-hound etc. that
spoke these Words? and does not the Apostle say, That God will dwell in his
Saints? read Coloss. both the 1. and 2. Epist. And as for Setting Face against
Heaven, with all thy bad Words and Languages thou might have kept at Home.

R. W. And thou say; See the horrible Egyptian Darkness, the Lord has
justly poured upon these feigned Goshenites, they exclaim against us for using
the word God-man, and ask us, where we find such a Phrase in Scripture? [and
why should you not prove by the Scripture, what you do say?] And thou say;
They rest not in the Title Immanuel, God with us; nor the Fullness of the
Godhead bodily in Christ [that is Scripture-Language]. And R. W. says; But
Sacrilegious Robbers (in effect) Arrogate to themselves to be God-men and
God-women, the Godhead dwelling in them Bodily.

Answ. We do charge R. W. or any of the New England Professors, to show out of
our writings, and name the Persons, that ever spoke any such Language; but as
the Scripture says* Christ dwells in his Saints, and they shall sup with him;
and they are the Temples of God. And this the Scripture declares, which we are
Witnesses of, praised be the Lord for ever.

R. W. And thou say; Whereas G. F. here says, The Work of the Ministry was,
to bring the Saints to a Perfect Man; he grossly abuses that Heavenly Ephesians. 4,
which concerns the Fullness and Perfection of all the Elect of God etc.

Answ. Then were not the Ephesians concerned? And does G. F. mention the
Ephesians only in his Answer? are not his Words general? so the Gross Abuse is
thy own, and not G. F.'s.

R. W. And thou say; Applying it to every particular deluded Convert of
theirs, as being as much Holy, as much God as Christ Jesus etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see G. F's Answer, if R. W. has not grossly Abused his
Words here again? for there are no such Words in his Answer of the Saints being
as much God, as Christ. But does not the Apostle say, That we may present every
Man Perfect in Christ Jesus, Col. 1. 28.? And He spoke Wisdom among them that
were Perfect, 1 Cor. 2, 6? And Col. 4, 12, That ye may stand Perfect and
complete in all the Will of God. And does not God and Christ exhort to Holiness
and Perfection? and Without Holiness none shall see the Lord. And Christ says;
Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is Perfect, (Matthew. 5) and must they not
be perfect in their Love and Measure of the Spirit of God, which they have from
him the Fountain, who are Sealed by his Holy Spirit of Promise, Ephesians. 1, 13:
and 1 These. 4, 8? And does not Peter say, Ye are a Royal Priesthood, and Holy
Nation, (1 Pet. 2, 9)? and does not the Apostle Paul call the Saints Holy
Brethren (1 Thessalonians. 5, 26, 27)? And their hands were to be Holy, that they
lifted up to God (1 Timothy 2). And (2 Timothy 1) the Lord called them with a Holy
Calling: and (1 Pet. 1) Be ye Holy in all manner of Conversations; Be ye Holy,
for I am Holy, says the Lord. So, is not the Vessel to be Holy, and Potle,
that holds the Heavenly Treasure of his Spirit, which they have from the Holy
God, the Fountain? But to say, The Saints are as much God, as Christ,, I ask
thee, how the little Vessels or Potles can contain him, who fills Heaven and
Earth? But what is thy end in all this? that thou would not have God and
Christ dwell in his Saints by his Spirit, and by his Faith.

R. W. Thou say; I may use the Exprobrations of Moses against Korah, Dothan
and Abiram; Is it not enough for you, but ye will seek the Priesthood also?

Answ. This thou might well have applied to thy self, and the Priests of
New England, and not to the Quakers: for it is through the Grace and Mercy of
God, that we are, what we are.

R. W. And thou say; Is it not enough, that the Most-High Potter has made
us Men and Women, and not Serpents and Toads, and not Pagans, Turks, Jews,
Papists, but English Protestants.

Answ. Are not the New England Priests and thou in the same Nature and Spirit
(that the Turks, Pagans, Jews and Papists) that persecute with Tongue and
Hands, yea to DEATH, as witness the New England Laws? and did not Christ call
the persecuting Jews Serpents, and of their Father the Devil, that did not do
the Works of Abraham? and what may be said to you, that do not do the Works of
true Christians?

R. W. And further thou say; We must also be Infinites, Eternals,
Omniscients etc.

Answ. If thou chargest this upon the Quakers, we say, they are Words of thy
own forging; and do challenge thee to make it good out of the Quakers Writings,
or name the Persons that said so: which we know thou can not.

R. W. And further thou say; Will not the infinite Favor of Leave, to drink
of some Heavenly Drops of the Infinite and Inconc^ivable Ocean of his Goodness.
satisfy and content us; but we will be Gods with the Devil, and our first
Parents, we will be the Inconceivable Ocean it self.

Answ. I never did hear such Lies before come out of a Man's Mouth, that any of
the People of God used any such terms, as, They were the Inconceivable Ocean it
self, and that they would be Gods. They might say, they were God's People, and
he would dwell in them; and, Christ was in them, and all their Springs were in
him: and this is according to Scripture. But let the Reader see, if there be
any such Occasion in G. F's. Answer for him to use this forging Language. And
if thou werest one of those proud Rebels (thou speak of) that was fetched
from the Gallows by the Smile of a Prince, thou would never have used these
Expressions against us. But thou say; They must be the Prince and King
himself: Thou have not proved this; though we must tell thee, Christ makes his
Redeemed Saints both Kings and Priests, to Reign over the Devil, and offer up
Spiritual Sacrifice to God, ( Revel. 1).

R. W. And thou say; The Pagans of the World, as they are wild to all
Civility, so to all Divinity, and Heavenly matters. And then thou tellest a
great Story, p. 49.
what they Worship, Lions, Dragons etc. And such as cried out of Paul and said,
he was a God etc. And thou say; They apprehend a Doity, (it is like thou
meanest a Deity, if thou had Printed it right) etc.

Answ. And what is all this to the purpose, to prove, that the Saints did not
receive of Christ's Fullness, and grow up to a perfect Man? For may be some of
us have read the Story of these things, as well as thou: but thou should have
brought Paul's Answer to those.

R. W. And thou say; It pleased the Most-High etc. often to meet with
Pharaohs, Absoloms, Nebuchadnezars, Hamans, Herod's of this World, with Nations,
Cities, Armies for their Pride, as he did with Sodom with remarkable Strokes of
Judgment etc.

Answ. Let thee and New England take heed of this, who boast your selves
against God's People, Sons and Servants; take heed, that God's Remarkable
Stroke do not come upon you: for be sure it will, if you do not find a day of
Repentance.

R. W. And thou say; Paul in danger to be pufft up in Voices and Questions
out of the Whirlwind etc.

Answ. But it were well, if R. W. saw himself, then he would not be against the
Quakers, who say, God's Grace is sufficient both to teach and bring Salvation.

R. W. And thou say; Till we more and more come to see, how Perfect we are
in Dirt and Stink, and Filth and Death and Hell, Crawling like Monsters of
Pride and Self-conceitedness upon this Earth etc.

Answ. It seems, you do not see your Stink to the full yet, of Filth, Death
and Hell, and your Crawling, monstrous Pride of Self-conceitedness: and how
should you without the Light of Christ, which gives the Knowledge of Christ,
and his Blood, that cleanses from Sin, and makes their Garments white.

R. W. And thou bring'st M. B. (Fol. 90.) saying, [ There is a kind of
Infiniteness in the Soul, which cannot be Infinite in it self]. And G. F.
Answers and asks the Question [Is not the Soul without beginning, coming
from God, returns to God again, who has it in his hand? which Hand goes
against him that does Evil; which throws down that which warreth against it.
And Christ the Power of God, is not he the Bishop of the Soul, which brings
it up unto God, which came out from him? and has this a Beginning or Ending?
Is not this Infinite in it self more then all the World?] R. W. replyeth, but
he does not answer G. F's. Questions, that he asks; but falls a railing,
and says, That the Soul or Spirit of Man should be boundless or without
limits, without Beginning or Ending, and cries, A blasphemous Monster,
begotten of Hellish Pride the Father, and Hellish Ignorance the Mother: And
thus Roger falls a Railing instead of Answering. And then thou say; For
Infinity and Infiniteness in that Sense can be no other, but the Infinite and
Eternal Power and Godhead, transcending the Capacity of Men or Angels to
receive it, or conceive the Nature of it.

Answ. Did not the Apostles receive Christ by his Spirit, in whom the Eternal
Power and Godhead dwelt? how did they preach Christ then both in his Flesh and
Divinity? But what is this to G. F's. Question? he does not say, That the Soul
is God or Christ, and his Eternal Godhead; but he asks the Question, Whether
the Soul did not come out from God, that is, from his Breath, who breathed into
Man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul? and whether or no the
Souls of the Righteous do not return to Christ and God?

R. W. And thou say; It is true in a Secondary way (a Posteriori) as they
say, the Spirit of Angels and Men are as Lamps, lighted up by the most-High and
Infinite Majesty never to go out or be extinguished in Joy or Sorrow etc.

Answ. And do not thou call the Spirits of Men the Soul? now if the Lighted
Spirits of Men etc. by the most-High and Infinite are never to go out, as thou
confessest, that the Spirits of Men etc. are Lighted, and never go out; are
they not Infinite then in a Secondary way?

R. W. This Notion dazles the most sober and steady Eye and Brain etc. [If G.
F's. Question dazzle the Eye and Brain, it is like it does thine.] And then thou
tellest a Story of Emperors, and the Sun and Moon, and Days and Nights etc.
And thou say; All have their Hitherto and No further, p. 50.
by the Infinite Eternal Arm [The Quakers do not deny that]. And thou say;
Of all the Opinions of the Soul's Being and Rise, this of Infinity, making it
God himself etc. and this is to destroy Souls, and the Infinite God himself.

Answ. How can G. F's Question destroy Souls or destroy God? for can he be
destroyed? no; he is a DESTROYER of the Destroyer: for G. F. in his Question
does not say, the Soul is God. Mag. Bine affirms, that there is a kind of
Infiniteness in the Soul; but what kind of Infiniteness it is, R. W. has not
explained: whether it be Infinite in it self, or Finite. And Job. 22, 5, Is not
thy Wickedness great, and thy Iniquities Infinite? R. W. will not say, that
this Infinite Wickedness was God, because he uses the Word Infinite. And
Habbakuk says; Ethiopia and Egypt were her Strength, and it was Infinite (
Nahum 3): now thou can not say, that this was God, because he uses the Word
Infinite: neither can thou say, The Soul is God, because M. B. says, There
is a kind of Infiniteness in the Soul. And G. F. asks, Whether it be not
Infinite in it self, and more than all the World? And does not Job say, In
whose Hand (to wit, the Lord's) is the Soul of every living thing, and the
Breath of all Mankind (Job. 12.9)? And is not Christ called the Bishop and
Shepherd of the Souls of the Saints (1 Pet. 2, 25)? and if Christ be the
Shepherd and the Bishop, is not he both the Nourisher and Feeder of the
Immortal Soul? And what! do not thou confess, the Soul is Immortal: and that
which is Immortal, is not that Everlasting? and now would it be well for G. F.
to conclude and to say, that R. W. says, The Soul is the Everlasting God,
acording to thy own Argument? nay, G. F. has more Charity. And does not R. W.
acknowledge the Soul to be Immortal, and the Souls of the Godly going unto
Jesus? and their Bodies uniting to the Spirit in Eternal Life? Well then, what
does R. W. make of the Bodies of the Saints, who is so offended at G. F's.
Question, because he asks, whether the Soul be not Infinite in it self? and
yet R. W. says; We use to say Hyperbolically, that such and such a doing is
Infinite Pride. But if G. F. should have said, Thou make Pride God, thou
would have been offended, who art offended at this Question, who asks,
Whether the Soul be not Infinite? and thou call him a Blasphemer: and yet
thou say, Pride is Infinite. And we know, that the Word Infinite properly
belongs to God: David says, His Understanding is Infinite: and thou say;
God proclaims his Infinite Power and Wisdom etc. Now my Question is to R. W
and the Priests of New England: Whether the Prophets and Apostles of God did
receive any of his Infinite Wisdom and Power by his Spirit from above, though
God be Infinite and Incomprehensible in himself in all his VVisdome and
Goodness and Justice? And did not God say, That Job was Perfect, though he
abhorred himself in Dust and Ashes? And thou confessest, that God is not only
Infinite, but Infinity it self, Omnipotency it self, VVisdome it self, Goodness
it self, Justice it self in all their Eminencies etc. But G. F. does not say,
the Soul is so: and if thou did own this in deed and in truth, thou would
not speak against the Quakers. And a great deal of Rambling thou make
concerning the Soul, but thou have not Answered G. F's. Questions, Whether the
Soul be in God's Hand? Whether Christ be the Bishop of it? And whether the
Souls of the Righteous Christ brings to God? or whether the Soul did come out
from God's Breath?

R. W. brings R. S. who says, [ The Mystical Body may be sometimes subject
to Distempers, and Humors, and Wants.] And G. F. answers, p. 51.
and questioneth [Are you Judges? can you judge of the Mystical Body, which the
Saints are Baptized into? are there Humors, Wants and Distempers in the Body,
which the Saints are Baptized into? are not the Wants, Distempers and Humors
in your Bodies? Do you here in this divide the Word aright? or distinguish
things in the Ground, and speak right of things? and yet ye would not be
judged, and say, Judge not: and is not Mystical Spiritual?] -- R. W. replyeth
and says, W. Edm. affirmed, God was a Spirit literally and properly.

Answ. Will thou say, That God is not a Spirit, as literally and properly as
the Scripture declares him? And thou say again, That W. Edm. showed but
little Philosophy and Divinity. Does not the Apostle bid the Saints, Beware of
Philosophy? and if they had known God and Divinity by it, the Apostle would not
have bidden them, beware of it, surely. And thou say, That W. Edm. affirmed,
that properly and really that Scripture of Wolves coming in Sheeps-Cloathing,
was to be understood Literally without Meaning. And what meaning will thou give
to Christ's Words? are not Men called Wolves really, that worry Christ's Sheep
about Religion? for Christ does not say, They are Wolves with four Feet; and
when Christ spoke Parables, he said, He that has an Ear, let him hear: and
sometimes he expounded them to his Disciples. And the Scripture calling God a
Father and a Husband, and Christ a Rock: and Christ's Believers are called a
Body, a House, a Flock, are they not really so? for it does not say, They are a
Flock of Sheep as outwardly, or other Creatures, nor an outward House etc. --
And then thou go on with a great Tale, and tell, What the Papists hold,
and what is amongst them. Roger, though thou and you of New England are
separated from the Church of Rome, yet you are found in the same Old Spirit of
Persecution.

R. W. And whereas thou say; By God's holy and wise Permission the Devil
sends out his old known Spirit of pure Invisibles, and pure Immediate, p. 52.
and pure Worshippers in Spirit and Truth.

Answ. Roger, do not Blaspheme against the Holy Spirit of God. For is not God's
Spirit and Truth Holy and Pure, in which he is Worshipped? and is not God's
Holy Spirit Invisible, or is it Mediate?

R. W. And thou say; This Spirit (to wit, of the Quakers) being Cozen German
to, or Sworn Brother in Hellish Equivocation with the Jesuits etc.

Answ. These are thine and the New England Priests Conditions, as your Fruits
have declared it: for the Quakers obey the Commands of Christ, who says, Swear
not at all.

R. W. For thou say; The Quakers Churches, they are (as they Childishly
vapor) Bodies without Wants or Distempers etc.

Answ. Reader see, if there be any such Words in G. F's. Answer: for G. F.
speaks of the Mystical or Spiritual Body, he does not speak of Naturals, nor
Bodies of outward Families, or Bodies of Nations and Cities, or Armies: Nor
Visible Churches, nor the Body of Visible Churches, but the Spiritual Body. For
does not the Apostle speak of a Spiritual Body, and a Natural Body? and so it
is God, that does supply both. And G. F. does not speak of the outward Bodies
of the Saints; for is that Mystical?

R. W. And then thou say; What known Divisions and Passions about J.
Naylor's and others Cases? what Envyings, Cursings, Apostasies and Moral
Idolatry: p. 53.
as that of Covetousness in this Colony known notoriously?

Answ. Thou have not particularized who they be, and what is their
Covetousness, who is known so notoriously (as thou say) in that Colony;
therefore we look upon this as a Slandering of thy Neighbors: for we question,
whether thou have admonished them (if it was so) before thou told the World.
And as for Cursings, and Envyings and Divisions, thou might have kept that
amongst you New England Professors: but if any one do not walk, as becomes the
Gospel, we do Admonish them. And if there be any Difference about outward
Matters, according to the Apostle's Doctrine, we do end it amongst our selves,
according to Truth and Righteousness, 1 Cor. 6; and God has given us Judgment
in such Matters, as well as Spiritual.

R. W. And thou say; I have fairly Collected, that the Spirit of the Quakers
tends to Incivility and Barbarism; and to sudden Assassinations, Murders and
Persecutions.

Answ. This is thine and the New England Spirits, whose Persecution is known,
for you have proved it already. And thou would have us punished, and yet thou
would not have it called Persecution (as in thy 200 page). Is not your Law
standing, by which you Murdered God's People; and do not your Laws, and thy
stirring up to Punishment, Collect or declare your own Spirit not to be the
Spirit of Christ? for where would it have any to be punished for Matters of
Religion and Conscience toward God? And so as for thy Lies and abusive
Speeches, we can say, The Lord forgive thee, if it be his Will.

R. W. And thou say; I believe, that I have, and can further make it good,
that the Eternal Father of Mercies stops millions of Mischiefs in the world
daily, which the Natures, Grounds and Principles of Men ( and the Quakers
Spirit also) now to turn and overwhelme the world withal.

Answ. Here thou have manifested thy self to be of the Spirit of them that
opposed Paul, who said, he was a Pestilent Fellow, and a Turner of the World
upside down. And as for the Principles of Men beside the Quakers, they may
answer for themselves: and thy Slanders may serve such, as are given up to
believe Lies; but sober People that know us, will not receive nor believe thy
Lies: but it will make more to believe the Truth, which thou can not stop.
But let the Reader see, if R. W. in all his Rambling Reply has said any thing
to the Spiritual or Mystical Body, which was G. F's. Question.

R. W. And thou bringst J. Clapham his saying, [ Men may be called of Men
Masters, and it is but a Cavel to deny it: and they may deny to be called
Father, as well as Master]. And G. F. Ans. [Thou have in this denied the
Doctrine of Christ, and slighted it, who says; Be not ye called of Men Master,
for ye have all one Master, which is Christ, and ye are all Brethren: and thou
have showed thy self out of that Brotherhood. And there is a Birth to be born,
which calls no Man Father upon Earth, which thou art ignorant of]. And R. W.
replyeth and falls a Railing, and calls it G. Foxs's lame Answer.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if it be not Christ's Doctrine; which he might as
well have called Christ's Doctrine Lame, which he Preached to his Disciples.

R. W. And thou say; Among other Foolish Passions and Affections haunting
all Men ( and the Quakers especially) these two are notorious, (viz.) Pride,
and a lazy Ignorance; these two are the Sir and Dame of most of these Wild
Monsters.

Answ. R. W. might have kept this at home, for it is his own Condition, who
kicketh at Christ's Doctrine, that G. F. brings, who says; Neither be ye
called of Men Master, for one is your Master even Christ, and ye are all
Brethren. And he manifests himself to be in the steps of the Pharisees, who
love to be called of Men Rabbi. And so for his Foolish Passion and Pride etc.
and Lazy Ignorance, and wild, Monstrous Spirit he may apply at home; who does
not obey Christ's Doctrine. -- And we know, that those Opposites have written
against Christ's Doctrine, (who love to be called of Men Masters) and against
us, because we hold it forth. -- And is it Scornful Pride, and a Robbing all
Mankind of their due, to obey Christ's Doctrine (as thou speak of)? for thou
say of their due Respects and favorable Glaunces of God's Care, of Order
and Prudent Distinctions and Differences amongst the Sons of Men in Families,
Cities, Nations, Armies, Natives etc. Answ. Does G. F. mention any of these,
either Families, Cities, Nations, etc? for G. F. speaks, how Christ taught
his disciples, that they should not be called of men Masters: And did Christ
Rob them of all these titles, and break God's care or order, when he said, Be
not yet called of men Masters?

R. W. Thou say: Sure he cannot but Remember, and his own, and all the Light
in the Quakers (if seriously minded) will tell them, that in robbing all the
world of their several due, moderate and sober Titles and Respects, they do it
but by a Judgling Hocas Pocas, a back door, etc. rob all others of their
Points, Ribbonds and Laces etc.

Answ. You may see, what work R. W. makes here agaiast Christ's doctrine to
his disciples, and how like the Scribes and Pharisees and Hypocrites he
appears? it is like, R. W. and the New England Priests are offended, because
the People called Quakers do not call them Masters. And thou say; The Pope
and the Quakers are compared. Nay, R. W. is nearer unto them, who pleads to
be called of men Master, like the Papists; for their Jesuits and Priests are
called of men Master, and plead for it, as thou do, and call them Civil
Respects: and therefore it is plain, that thou art found in their Spirit.

R. W. And then thou say; The Dogged and Scornful Quakers are far from,
their Spirit being prouder than the Papists. And thou Contradicts thy self and
say; p. 54.
The Pope and Quakers compared.

Answ. For the People of God called Quakers, obeying the Doctrine of Christ,
cannot call your Teachers Masters; and if you did not love it Pharisee-like,
you would never make such work about it: and Christ has interpreted, what the
Master signifies. And did Christ only condemn the Pharisees, and not such as
your Teachers, for being called of Men Masters? did not he teach his own
Disciples the contrary?

R. W. And thou say; The Foxians itch, of being called of Men Masters etc.
in Religion, undervaluing and slighting others.

Answ. These are False Charges, as our Practice declares it.

R. W. And then thou tellst a Story of James Naylor, and what one should call
G. F.

Answ. But who that One is, thou have not declared. And as for James Naylor, he
Repented, and the World knows it: therefore it is no Credit for thee to
Publish that.

R. W. Thou say; Half a Humane and sober Eye may see, that in all his
Declamations against the Pharisaical or Popish, or Foxians Rabbis etc.

Answ. These are Railing Accusations. For where do the Quakers own that Title
Rabbi, as they are Preachers of Christ (as thou and the Pharisees and the
Papists do) thou speak of, in a Religious Account, as they were Teachers?
but in a Civil Account, as Fathers, Masters and Mothers by Children and
Servants, we never deny this in a Civil account, but practice it. But what is
this to oppose Christ's Doctrine, and not to obey his Command, which thou art
now Fighting against? we believe, many a Priest could have wished, that
Doctrine of Christ had been torn out of the Bible, it cutteth your Pride so.

R. W. And thou say; How childishly does Fox Answer this his Opposite, viz.
That although it be unlawful to call Master, yet not unlawful to call Father:
for there is a Birth, which his Opposite is ignorant of.

Answ. We say, Yes, and thou too. But do thou say, It is Childish for Christ
to say, Call no Man Father upon the Earth, Matthew. 23, 9? is not this
Childishness or Ignorance in thee, to oppose his Doctrine? And did not the
Disciples of Christ believe in the Light, and so became Children of Light? and
as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God? ( John 12, Romans
8) And this is according to true Christian Regeneration and Change.

R. W. And thou say; Paul said, Though you have ten Thousand Teachers, yet I
have begotten you. Sure it is, their Immediate denies the Mediate.

Answ. What is all this to the purpose to oppose Christ's Doctrine in Matthew.
23? But R. W. has left out Paul's Instrument, through which he begot them, to
wit the Gospel, which the Apostle says, Is the Power of God unto Salvation
(Romans 1, and 1 Cor. 4, 15): and he told them, That they had not many Fathers in
Christ: and why did thou leave out that?

R. W. And thou say; How simple is that Consequence, that because God is an
Extraordinary Father, therefore I may call all Men Fathers, p. 55.
but not Masters, when God is both Father and Master; and both Titles are
forbidden in a true Sense etc.

Answ. And yet thou will not obey them thy self, but railest against the
Quakers that do: and God is the Father of his People, and Christ is the Master
of his Followers. But come R. W. and the New England Priests, show us a
Scripture out of all the New Testament of Master Matthew, Mr. Mark, Mr. Luke,
Mr. John, or Mr. Peter, and Mr. Paul, and Mr. James etc? and if Roger Williams
and the Priests of New England will be called of Men Master, how is it, that
they do not give the Title Master to the Apostles, when they read their
Epistles, or to the Evangelists? And have not thou written in thy Book, and
applauded thy self to the World, how that one called thee Master Williams? and
so have set forth thy Title to the World, in opposition to Christ's Doctrine.

R. W. Brings W. Thomas's saying, [Men are saved, but not by Christ within
us]. G. F. (Fol. 106) Answers W. T. [How is Man's Salvation wrought out, but
by the Power of Christ within? How is the Old Man destroyed, but by Christ
within? how is Justification felt, but by Christ within? Here he quotes G. F's
Words falsely, saying [Seeds we manifest] to mak^ them Nonsense, which are not
G. F's Words.
And the Seed Christ made manifest, that suffered without, is made manifest
within, there is Redemption and Life. He that has the Son of God, has Life:
Redemption to God out of the First Adam; and who feel Christ within, feel
Salvation; and who do not, are Reprobates, though they may talk of him.] -- R.
W. replies to G. F. and says; This Subtle Fox is in his Borough, confounding
( under the Term Christ) the Person of Christ, and the Love and Spirit und
Grace or Fovour of Christ, as if they were all one.

Answ. Let the Gentle Reader judge, Is not the Love, and Spirit, and Grace and
Favor of Christ to be manifest within, who suffered without? But let the
Reader read my Words here, and mine in R. W's. Book, and compare them together
and see, how many he has left out. And see the Abusive Words of R. W.'s. who
says, Confounding under the Term of Christ the Person of Christ. etc. And how
can G. F. say, That Christ suffered without his Person without the Gates of
Jerusalem, who yet is manifest within his People, according to the Apostle's
Doctrine? And it was the Favor of Christ and the Love of God, that Christ
should die for Sinners; and it is the Love and Favor of God, that he should be
made manifest in his People.

R. W. And then thou tellest a story of a King, and General or Admiral, which
is to no purpose: And the writings of G. F. where they come, there is not G. F.
except he be there.

Answ. But what is this to the purpose, that Christ, that suffered without the
Gates of Jerusalem, must not be manifest in his people by his Spirit? Many may
have the Scriptures, that speak of Christ, but if they have not the Son, they
have not Life; as John says. And if thou owned'st that in the Truth, which is
spoken of Ephesians. 2. and Gal. 2. thou would not oppose the Quakers.

R. W. And thou confessest, Faith is given of God, etc. and this Faith and
belief is wrought by Christ Jesus, and finished by him; and may with a good
sense be called Christ himself.

Answ. Let the sober Reader see, if G. F. do mention in his Answer (or any
where else) that Christ is Faith; but the Author and Finisher of it. And how
can Faith be wrought in Men's Hearts, if Christ the Worker of it, be not there
also by his Spirit? And then thou go on in thy Story, and tellst us a Story
of Humph. p. 56.
Norton, That he resolved Christ only into a Spirit etc. This is like the rest
of thy Slanders; for we do not believe thee, that Humphry Norton owned not the
Man Christ Jesus: but the Question is, Whether R. W. and the New England
Priests will own Christ to be a quickening Spirit? And as for Paul's saying to
the Corinthians, He was absent in Body, yet present in Spirit; this will prove,
that Christ by his Spirit is in his People, though he be at the Right Hand of
God.

And then thou tellest us a Story of Soldiers to no purpose against G. F's.
Answer, of Christ being manifest in his Saints, that suffered without. And can
any see Christ Jesus at the Right Hand of God, but by his Spirit and his Light
within? did not Stephen see him by the Holy Ghost, and was not that within? And
that is true, which was sent to them that stood gazing, As they saw him go, so
should he come; (as in Acts 1, 10, 11,) which also said, Ye men of Gallilee,
why stand ye gazing up into heaven? the same Jesus, which is taken up from you
into Heaven, shall come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into Heaven. And
did not Christ, appear to his Disciples after his Ascension? and to Paul? and
was manifest in his Saints? and will come and Reward every man according to his
Works, (as in Revelations.)

And thou go on, and usest many words, but to no purpose. And if Christ be
felt in the bruised Reed, and the smoking flax, and the poor in Spirit, and to
feed the Hungry and Thirsty, is not this all within? and is not he the Hope of
Glory manifested within his People? and does not the sup with the Saints, and
the Saints sup with him the Heavenly Supper? And does not he stand at the door
and knock? but you will not open, and cleave to his Light, and receive him. And
without his Light you may seek Day and Night, and grope in the dark, and never
find him.

R. W. And thou say. There is a false Feeling of Christ, a false Conception
in a Woman: and how many are bold to cry, Lord, Lord open, for we have
Prophesied in thy Name.

Answ. Truly Roger, this is thy own Condition and the New England Priests and
Professors, in the False Feeling and Conception, that do not believe in the
Light, as Christ Commands; but persecute them that believe in the Light, and
truly feel, and are become Children of the Light, and have brought forth the
true Birth, and are graffted into Christ.

R. W. Thou say; I will not say as G. F. has said, All that have not my
Feeling or Working of Christ, are Repr^bates.

Answ. G. F's. Words are the Apostle's Doctrine, who says, If Christ be not in
you, you are Reprobates etc. (2 Cor. 13) and therefore he bids them, Prove and
Examine themselves; and so it is every true Christian's Duty.

R. W. And whereas thou say; Yet this I say, as Solomon, A Whore is loud and
clamorous: [Truly R. W. thou art of her: for I never heard so many clamorous
Words from a Man's Mouth in my Life, as from thine: but it is well thou have
showed thy Spirit, which will be abhorred by all sober Men and Women.] -- And
then thou say; The Devil spoke as Holy and Heavenly Words, as Angels could
have spoken, yet it was but the Devil in Samuel's Mantle.

Answ. R. W. this is thy own Condition; for thou may bring the Scriptures,
as the Jews and the Devil did, that tempted Christ, and oppose him, as the Jews
did in they days of his flesh, as he being the man Christ: So now thou opposest
his Divinity, and the divine Light, which is the Life in the Word, which Light
his believers believed in, and which Light shines in their hearts, and gives
them the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 4.)

R. W. And thou bring'st Giles Ferman ( G. F. Fol. 117.) Saying [Paul Swore
after Christ, and the Angels Swore: I wonder Paul should so forget himself, p.
57.
and Sin so fearfully in Swearing. So the Quakers Light that denies Swearing,
is of Satan, and not the Light of Christ.] G. F. Answers to G. Ferman [Christ
the Light (which Satan is out of) who is the Oath of God, ends all Oaths
Sworn by Prophets or Angels whatsoever: and who Swear, be fallen into the
Condemnation of the Devil. And it is no where said, that Paul Swore; but such
as thou art, matter not what you speak: So that spirit, that Preaches for
Swearing, is not the spirit of Christ. But the Spirit of Antichrist Preaches
up that, which Christ and the Apostles Preached down, and Preached condemnation
to them that Swear.] R. W. Replyeth. [though he has left out, [ Preaches
Condemnation to them that Swear] of G. F. words, and also has left out, That
which thou preachest up, to wit Swearing, Christ and the Apostles Preached
down. So here and there thou have taken some of G. F's Words] And further thou
say, that G. F. dare not deny, but the Angel and Paul Swore after Christ;
and yet thou say, that Christ put an end to Swearing, and that it is not
said, that Paul Swore, and call it G. F.'s old Song.

Answ. Here thou contradicts thy self; for G. F. says, It is no where said,
that Paul Swore. And if the Angel did Swear, is it not said in the Scripture, I
will bring forth my Begotten into the world, let all the Angels worship him;
that says, Swear not at all? But what is this to the purpose? the Command was
to men, not to Swear, and to the Apostles; to whom Christ and the Apostle
forbids all Swearing.

R. W. And thou say; If the Attestation in the Name of God be the formality
of an Oath, then if ever any man Swore in this world, Paul did, Saying to the
Corinthians, I call God to Record on my Soul: etc.

Answ. Roger does not speak plainly, whether Paul Swore, or no, but is in his
Ifs. And we know, that this, which Paul speaks to the Corinthians, will not
be taken for an Oath.

R. W. And thou tellest us, How Nations used to Swear, and appealed to the Gods
etc: And how they used to put Creatures in the Room of God, as the Jews did:
And some write out of a Superstitious Reverence, in forbearing the Name of God,
and indeed the Reasons that Christ gives, look that way.

Answ. Christ and the Apostles forbid all Oaths (as in Mat. 5. and Jam. 5.) not
only to Creatures, but the Oaths that were to be performed to the Lord.

R. W. Thou Say: There seems to be a very fair Color put on an universal
prohibition of Swearing by Christ Jesus, by his Apostle James, Swear not etc.
[Is it no more, but a seeming fair Color? are not Christ and the Apostle's
words real?] and yet R. W. says, I must proclaim against G. F. in his lame and
simple Return to his Opposite Concerning Paul and the Angel: p. 58.
and further thou say, Why may not Paul and all the Apostles etc. and all
the Angels of heaven, and all the Saints of God upon the Earth in Paul's words
call God to Record upon their Souls etc. in case of Truth?

Answ. Yes, they may, and G. F. does not deny it: and if thou say, that was
an Oath, thou art both Lame and Simple, and have not proved it so. And as I
said before, Christ forbidding Swearing, and the Apostles, it was to men that
had Oaths and Shaddows, yea and all Oaths were forbidden, as well as the true.
And the Angel Swearing (in the Revelations) was, that time should be no longer
etc. (Rev. 10.) but what is this to Christ's forbidding men not to Swear at
all? And this we can say Instead of an Oath, and have proffered to Rulers and
Magistrates, that If we break our Yea, Yea, and Nay Nay, then let us suffer the
same punishment, as they do, that are perjured persons: for our NOT SWEARING
is in obedience to the Command of Christ and the Apostle's Doctrine, who says,
Swear not at all.

R. W. And thou say: As the fear of God is put for the whole worship of God,
so also is Swearing in the holy Scripture.

Answ. This is but R. W's Saying so; but he has brought no Chapter and Verse
for it, nor tells us, where it is written so? but speaks contrary to Christ
and the Apostle's Doctrine, who says, Swear not at all. And where does R. W.
prove, that God commanded Swearing, before Moses was born?

R. W. And thou say. Thou know, the Foxians make Baptism etc. And ere
long, if they continue to hearken to Samuel within them, they will account
Prayer and Preaching but Types and Shaddows.

Answ. These are Scoffing and Jearing expressions, as any sober people may see.
And John says, that he must decrease, and Christ must increase, that comes
after him, who is mightier then he, that was preferred before him (who is
Mightier in birth and in power etc.) and he shall Baptize you with fire and the
Holy Ghost, and he shall increase. Now I query of R. W. Whether he has known
John? whether his Rough way be made Smooth, and his Crooked way straight, and
his Mountain be down? and whether he does believe, that Christ Jesus is come
after John? And what reason has R. W. to say, that the Quakers will look upon
preaching and praying to be Types and Shaddows, if they hearken to Samuel
within them? do these words savor of the Spirit of God, let the sober Reader
Judge.

R. W. And thou say, That Swearing is as real worship of God, as preaching
etc: and the fear of God and Swearing by him is put for his whole worship.

Answ. And were not Offerings and Sacrifices the Worship of God in the time of
the Law? and does not Christ say, before Abraham was, I am? who says, Swear
not at all? and does not Christ end the Offerings and Swearing as well before
the Law, as after the Law, and so all Oaths? For the Apostle that forbids
Swearing, Exhorts to prayer: and therefore thou Preachest a false Doctrine,
to bring people into Evil and Condemnation, that preachest up Swearing, against
Mat. 5. James 5.

R. W. And thou say; It is a gross fancy to Imagine, that the Lord Jesus in
Mat. 5. gave New Commands to contradict the holy pleasure of his Father
Concerning Oaths etc.

Answ. Christ there expounds the Law, and tells them, how they were not to
forswear themselves, but perform their Oaths to the Lord in the Old time: and
what Old time was that? But Christ says, I say unto you, Swear NOT AT ALL: so
this was the true Oath of God, that he forbids amongst the Jews, which was a
part of their worship. And Christ, he puts down their Worship at Jerusalem,
which the Jews went there yearly to worship; and sets up a worship in Spirit
and Truth: and do thou say, that the Jews worship lay in nothing but the fear
of God, Swearing, and Prayer? and were they not to obey many other things in
their Worship? And for all frivolous Oaths Christ reproved the Jews, and the
Law forbad false Swearing, as well as Christ: and what the Prophet under the
Law called Swearing, the Apostle under the Gospel calls Confessing, (Phil. 2,
10, 11.)

R. W. And thou say: A Sober Eye may see, that Christ intends only to reduce
them to an Holy Swearing, only by God's way.

Answ. Thou have not proved this out of the New Testament, but they proceed
from thy own dark Imaginations. And are thy own Traditions contrary to the mind
of Christ and the Apostle, who denis all Swearing, and sets up Yea and Nay
in the Lieu of it? and he plainly forbids that Oath, that the Jews were to
perform to the Lord in the old time.

R. W. And thou bring'st F. H. and say; The Quakers plainly Confess Swearing
in cases Lawful.

Answ. In this thou abusest F. H. and the Quakers: but to use those words, as
F. H. and the Apostle do, is not Swearing. And had thou been in the same
tenderness of Usher or the Waldenses, thou would not have pleaded so much for
Swearing. And do not thou tell in one place of thy Book, how thou
Suffered'st, because thou could not take an Oath (but now it seems, thou
art hardened) as in page 60. wherein thou say, thou could not yield to the
formality of an Oath; and it seems, now thou can Swear, and deny Christ and
the Apostle's Doctrine, and plead for it.

And why should the Parliament and all Lawiers search well and appoint a
Committee to examine, if their Laws upon New appearances from Heaven have not
need of Rectifying? p. 60.
etc. And (as R.W. says) If Swearing be a part of God's worship etc then did
not R. W. Sin in not Swearing in the Chancery in England, in leaving off a part
of God's worship, which he says, Swearing is? But in this you may see, how R.
W. Contradicts himself, and has manifested, what Love he has to Christ and
his Apostles, who perverteth their words (as he does G. F's) and Slights their
Doctrine, who says, Swear not at all.

R. W. And thou bring'st T. Moor saying [ It is not properly, nor in a full
sense, that God is manifested in the flesh of his Saints.] (but Roger has
quoted no page for this.) G. F. Answ. [The Saints are the Temples of God, and
God dwells in them: and they come to witness the Flesh of Christ, and they
glorify him in their Souls and bodies, and the Lord is Glorified in their
bringing forth much fruit, and they witness his Seed (to wit Christ) the one
Offering for Sin to be manifested within. And such are not Reprobates, that
witness the One Offering, Christ Jesus; and they that have not him within, they
are Reprobates.] R. W. replyeth and says, A great design of the Devil in all
Ages has been to Cavil at, and hinder God's Love to mankind.

Answ. What! does this hinder the Love of God to mankind, and to have Christ
manifest within them, which is God's Love to the World? And is it not the
Devil's design, to deceive Man and keep his house, and will suffer him to talk
of Christ as long as he will, but will not suffer the strong one to be bound
and cast out? And they that are Married to Christ (who bruiseth the Serpent's
head) are they not of his flesh and of his bones? and they that have the Son,
can praise God for his Love to fallen mankind.

R. W. And thou say: Against this Lord Jesus Christ this old Serpent hisseth
and rages before his birth, at his birth and after his birth etc.

Answ. We, who have Christ formed in us, have felt the Rage of the Old Serpent
in this Age both in R.W. and the New England-Priests and professors, as Christ
and the Prophets and Apostles did in their Age by the professors of Christ in
words, as the Jews professed him to come in words.

And whereas thou rank'st the people of God called Quakers amongst the
Libertines, Manicheans, Adamites, Ranters etc. these R. W. and the
New-England-Priests might very well applied at home, p. 61.
who have manifested your Order in the Dragon's power, thou speak of,
persecuting with Tongue and Hands, as Michael the Archangel, when Contending
with the Devil he disputed about the Body of Moses, durst not bring against him
a Railing Accusation, but said, The Lord Rebuke thee. And now art not thou with
thy Railing Accusations disputing about the Body and Flesh of Christ? as thou
may see in Jude and Zach: 3.

R. W. And whereas thou tell us, What the Arrians hold [But thou had
better to see, what thou held'st and did possess of Christ thy self.] And
thou say, But with Christ's Manhood and the Scriptures the Devil and the
Papists and the Quakers for the most part of them could with all their heart
make an Everlasting parting. The Devil 's End is, to destroy this Savior and
Salvation to poor lost man; she Quakers pretend, their End to be the Exalting
and Glorifying God in the Flesh of his Saints.

Answ. As for what the Papists and the Devil do, thou may apply that at
home, who so often have the Devil in thy Mouth. And as for parting Christ Jesus
from his Godhead, that is not our work; for he is called the heavenly man, the
Second Adam, a quickening Spirit. And the Scripture we own: and also are to
Glorify God with our Souls and bodies, which are his. And we tell thee, the
Devil cannot destroy our Savior Christ Jesus, for he destroys the Devil and
his Works: but it is like, he may destroy your Imaginary Christ or Antichrist,
and set up another; for Christ was dead, and is alive, and lives for Evermore.
(Revel. 1, 18)

R. W. And thou say, that G. F. plays upon the various meaning of the word
Flesh; he plays also upon those holy Scriptures, viz: God is glorified in the
Souls and bodies of his Saints. etc.

Answ. As for saying, G. F. plays, that thou might have applied at home; for
his words are Scripture-phrases. For must not all the Children of the New
Covenant witness their bodies the Temp^es of God, and him to dwell in them, and
wa^k in them by his Spirit? and they to bring forth fruits of his Spirit, and
to Glorify God in their bodies and Souls etc? And we do know, what the
Protestants do hold, and what you do hold in words concerning Christ, who
persecute us, that do possess him: and you had better possess him, and let him
Rule in your hearts by Faith, and not the Dragon, the Old persecutor. For we
own Christ in the promise in the prophecies, who was born of a Virgin, his
Sufferings, Resurrection, in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily;
and of his fullness have we Received Grace for Grace (Col. 4)

R. W. And thou say; That G. F knows, his Opposite intends such a
manifestation of God in the Flesh, that renders the one Single person Christ
Jesus the head of the Church: and that they hold, there is as much difference
between that one Individual person Christ Jesus the Head, and his Followers, as
between our heads and our bodies etc.

Answ. If you hold this, this is a Nighness betwixt Christ and his Church; but
do you possess it? And G. F knows his Opposites in the other Power's days; it
was a wonder to them, to hear of Christ's dwelling in people: so G. F. knew
their meaning very well. And must not God, that was manifested in the Flesh of
Christ, that one Single person, must not he and his Father be manifest in his
people by his Spirit, and he to dwell in them Now, as he did in the Apostle's
days?

R. W. And thou say; How poor and lame is it, that because the Saints are
God's Temple, therefore they must be God himself? p. 62.


Answ. Let the Reader see if there be any such words as these, in G.F's Answer:
for G F's. words are, The Saints are the Temples of God, and God will dwell in
them (as 1 Cor. 6. and 2 Cor. 6.) G. F. does not say, The Saints are God, as
thou have falsely forged. And does not the Apostle Exhort the Saints* that
Christ may dwell in their hearts by Faith? (Ephesians. 3.) and therefore thou say,
They say, they are Christ himself: Let the Reader see, if there be any such
word in G. F's. Answer? and whether he has not abused G. F's. words here also?
Must not Christ dwell in his people? and are not the Saints bodies members of
Christ? and are they not Christ's Temple for to dwell in? And does not the
Apostle say, Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price? etc. is this to
affirm, They are Christ himself? Or does it hence follow, That those
particulars affirmed of the man Christ Jesus (1 Timothy 3.) are inverted, and
dreadfully turned upon their proud, devilish Flesh, because God was Manifested
in the Flesh etc? (1 Timothy 3, 16.) see, what false Charges and Inferences he
frames! But does not Christ destroy the Devil, and proud Flesh in people? for
does not the Apostle say, If Christ be in you, the body is dead, because of
Sin: but the Spirit is life, because of Righteousness. (Romans 8.)

R. W. And thou say: The Devil is manifest in their Flesh, Condemned of the
holy Spirit of God, abhorred of the heavenly Angels, the world shall abhor
their Memory, and except Repentance they shall descend with all the Enemies of
the true Lord Jesus into the Lake, that burns with unquenchable fire etc.

Answ. R. Williams might have applied this Judgment of his, to his own Spirit,
and the professors of New England, of the Devil being manifested in their
Flesh* whose work of Lying, Murder and Persecution they have done; and its
well, if they do see a day of Repentance, that they and he may escape the Lake.
Thus we do Confess with the Apostle, The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ
Jesus has made us free from the Law of Sin and death: for what the Law could
not do, in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sending his own Son in the
likeness of Sinful Flesh, for sin Condemns Sin in the Flesh, that the
Righteousness of the Law might be fullfilled in u^, who walk not after the
Flesh, but after the Spirit, (Romans 8.) And as for R. W's. saying, The world
abhorring of our memory etc. we know, the World hated Christ our Lord and
Master, and so it is no marvel, if such worldly minds, as R. W. is, hate us.
God Loved his people, yea all his Saints are in his hand, and they sit down at
his feet, and receive his words, and his Angels do pitch their Tents about
them: and we know, that their Ministering Spirits are sent forth to Minister to
them, that be Heirs of Salvation (Deuteronomy. 33. Hebr: 1.)

R. W. And thou bring'st Tho. Moor saying [ Christ is distinct from from every
one of us, and without us and our particular persons.] And G. F. Answers T.M.
[The Apostle says, Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates; and they
were of his Flesh and of his Bone, and they eat his flesh, and drank his blood,
then it was within them. And he is distinct from none, but Reprobates, who hate
the Light.] And is not this truth according to Scripture? for the Apostle
says, We are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bone (Ephesians. 5, 30:)
and (2 Cor. 13) Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates. And does not Christ
say, he is the Living bread, that comes down from heaven? and Whosoever eats my
flesh, and drinks my blood, has Eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the
last day; for my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed; he that
eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him: and is
not this Scripture? R. W. Replyeth to G. F. and falls a Railing (as he used
to do) and says, G. F's. words carry two faces, one to God, and another to the
Devil.

Answ. As for that word, face to the Devil, he might have kept it at home, for
it is his own. And as for the Papist's Transubstantiation, which he calls
Rome on Hell, let them answer for themselves, we have nothing to do with them:
and Christ says, his words are Spirit and Life, and flesh profits nothing. And
as for thy saying, that the Quakers have printed, that their flesh and blood is
as good as Christ's and of as much virtue etc. These are more of thy Lies, but
no book nor page have thou mentioned for this.

R. W. And whereas thou bring'st Act. 20. and say; Hence many of them
contend, that God's blood and God's flesh redeems them. p. 63.


Answ. What! must they not use the Apostle's Expressions, who said, Take heed
unto your selves, and to feed the Flock, which the Holy Ghost has made you
Overseers to feed the Church of God, which he has purchased with his own
blood? And in Contradiction to thy self thou say, That God paid his blood
to redeem thee (page 156): but I must tell thee, Christ as God, did not die;
but Christ suffered according to the Flesh.

R. W. And thou say, Gods Flesh redeemes us.

Answ. Was not Christ God? and does not the Scripture say ( Romans 9, 5.) Christ
is God? but God is a Spirit. And where did ever the Quakers print or say, it
was God's Flesh? it is called, the Flesh of Christ: but what, if the Quakers
use the Apostle's words, Great is the Mystery of Godliness! God was manifested
in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit etc. (1 Timothy 3).

R. W. And thou say, That their blood and their sufferings are God's Flesh
and Blood Redeeming and Saving etc.

Answ. The Reader may see, there are no such words in G. F.'s Answer. For I
say, It Is Christ's blood, who dyed at Jerusalem, that saves; and yet the
Saints cannot deny, but that they are Christ's, and Christ is God's, and their
bodies are his to dwell in. And thou tell of One, that would not speak all
at once; but who it is, thou tell us not: so its like, thou have Abused him,
as thou have done others.

R. W. And thou say: These Foxians are God and Christ, Spirit, Resurrection,
Life and Heaven.

Answ. These are more of thy Lies and Forgeries, let the Reader see, if there
be any such thing in G. F's. Answer, and whether thou have not abused his
Answer. And must not Christ dwell in his people, who is the Resurrection and
the Life, and his Kingdom be in them? and does not he dwell in all his true
believers? And did not Christ appear again to his Disciples according to his
Promise? and Christ says, He that loves me, and keeps my words, my Father
will Love him, and we will come unto him, and make our Abode with him (John 14)
And that of Joh. 16. is true, as Christ speaks, and the true believers do
behold his Glory (as in Joh. 17).

R. W. And thou say, I know, these poor Foxians say, that he did come again
to them (to wit Christ) and I know also, that a man may feel this Lie with a
pair of Mittins: for I know, the Comforter came not unto them upon his
Resurrection, ( for then he was forty days with them) but after his Ascension.

Answ. As for poor and Foxians, thou might have kept to thy self, and Lie
(for thou call'st it Uncivil for G. F. to speak the word Lie, and is it Civil
for thee?) with the Mittins. And we know, that Christ after his Resurrection
appeared unto his Disciples, and that the Holy Ghost came to his Disciples
after his Ascension: but what is all this to the purpose, to disprove G. F's.
Answer, That Christ does not dwell in his Saints now, and that the Holy Ghost
is not in them now? And we do believe of Christ's birth, sufferings, Death and
Resurrection, and Manifest in people, who will Judge the world in Righteousness.

R. W. And thou say, That we maintain Christ's Second Coming to be
Spiritual. [And does R. W. maintain his coming to be Carnal?] And thou say,
They count all gazing fools, that look after a man; for Christ is come unto
them in Spirit, and in them he maintains his great Assizes, and now passes
Judgment upon men by them etc.

Answ. Does not Christ dwell in his peoples hearts by his Spirit? and does not
he there Judge down Sin and Evil, that is in the hearts of Men? and does not he
give a Judgment to his Saints to Judge the Evil of the world? (read 1 Cor. 5)
And must the Saints deny this Judgment, that he gives his people, because
Christ will Judge the world in Righteousness, and reward every man according to
his works? Nay Roger, thou must feel it for belying and vilifying his people.
And if you look after Christ, as a Carnal Man, may they not call you Fools? who
is called the Second Adam, THE LORD FROM HEAVEN.

R. W. And thou say: If these poor, filthy dreamers lived without food and
Physic etc. without procreation etc.

Answ. We may say to thee, as Christ said to the Devil, Man lives not by bread
alone, but by every word, that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And as for
thy saying, Without procreation, and bringing forth of Children without the
Stinks of Nature etc. and a great deal of such Rambling stuff, which thou have
filled thy book up withal, thou may keep at home: and where did ever the
Prophets or Apostles use such Language concerning Marriage, which is an
Ordinance of God, or of Nature, which is good in it self? And as for thy
speaking of Eating of the flesh of Christ, until they b^come Christ himself,
which thou say, is Simple, Monstrous and Blasphemous etc. let the Reader
see, if there be any such words in G. F's Answer, or if they be not words of
his own forging, and Lies. But we cannot deny our bread from Heaven, for all R.
W's. Lies and Slanders, for which we can praise God for it, as the Apostles
did, who are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. And thou tell of
Manicheans, and of a Frantic Spirit: As for the Manicheans, these thou
might have kept at home.

R. W. And thou say, This Frantic Spirit says, Is not Christ in us? how is
he distinct from us? what need you ask me, how I do? can Christ be sick? can
Christ do but well (speaking of themselves) And thou Observest God's wonderful
Stroke in this world upon three sorts of persons etc. p. 64.


Answ. It were well, if R. W. did see the Stroke of God upon himself, and let
others alone, to stand or fall to their own Master. And Reader, is there any of
these Expressions in G. F's. Answer to Tho. Moor? for he has not named any,
that has spoken such words, as he has forged here. And was that a Frantic
Spirit in the Apostle, who said, Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? but
does not Christ say, I was thirsty, hungry, naked, in prison, a stranger and
sick etc. whether this was not Christ in his members? and if so; then whether
R. W. and the New-England-Professors have not been persecuting him all this
while, as the persecuting Jews did, who looked on him as a Deceiver? And as for
the other Scoffing words, we leave them, they are not worth mentioning, (as in
the 62, 63, 64 pages may be seen).

R. W. And thou bring'st S. Hamond (Fol. 186) who says, [ What Warrant have
you to go out to the Quakers? shall a Man go hear the Jews and Popish Mass,
because Paul bids, Try all things? No, no.] And G. F. answers, [Paul bids
us, Quench not the Spirit; and where the Spirit is not quenched, they may try
Papists, Jews, Protestants, who quench not the Spirit: But who quench the
Spirit, and draw People from the Light within, they draw them from that they
should See withal: then you stuff them up with Old Authors and Lying Stories,
as you Print abroad.] R. W. instead of Replying he asks Questions, Whether
the Jews, Papists or Idolaters have the Holy Spirit? and whether they may go to
hear God speaking in his Holy Promise among them? etc.

Answ. Have not the Jews the Old Testament? and the Papists the Old and New, as
well as thou to speak of? And do not they hate the Light of Christ, and quench
the Spirit as well as thou, and persecute them that believe and walk in it? and
I ask R. W, Whether he can judge of them, without hearing of them, or reading
of their Books? And does not the Lord say, He would pour out of his Spirit upon
all Flesh, as well as thee, though they grieve it? and lights all as well as
thee, though they and thou hate it.

R. W. And thou say; May I hear a Papist, a Jew or an Idolater, a False
Worshipper etc. when I am convinced, that they speak not from the Holy Spirit?
etc. Or, May I go to worship God with them, when thou believe, they worship a
False God.

Answ. If thou wast convinced with the Holy Spirit of God, as we are, then thou
could not join with any false Worship, nor hear them to uphold them in it:
for with the Spirit they are tried, and not followed, in which Spirit of Truth
God is worshipped. But is it not Sam. Hamond's and R. William's Intent here,
that they would not have the People to hear the Quakers, and to worship God in
the Spirit and Truth? Though the Apostles went up and down into all Nations to
Preach the Gospel, yet they did not join with their Worships, and hold them
up: and they that are convinced of the Falseness of them, they have tried them.

R. W. And thou say; May I hear a False Prophet, or be present at any False
Worship, but with Actual Reproving of them, and laboring to reduce them etc.

Answ. If thou werest in the true Spirit out of the false, lying, slandering
Spirit, thou might Admonish and Reprove, if thou wast in the Spirit of God,
as the Apostles were in: but how comes it to pass, that the New England
Professors, who are the Pesecutors and False Prophets, cannot bear such, as
Actually reprove them? And why do the New England Professors make the Quakers
pay Five shillings a day, that do not go to hear them, when they are convinced
and have proved them, and tried them that they do not speak from the Spirit of
God, and know them to be in the same Persecuting Spirit, that the Jews and
Papists were in?

R. W. And thou say; Thou wast stopped by a Sudden Spirit of Prayer in a Woman
at Newport, and an Unseasonable Spirit of Prayer in a Man, which forced me to
stop, and occasioned me to take this way and Dispute with them.

Answ. And why could not R. W. have had Patience to have stayed, till they had
done Prayer? but he has showed his bad Spirit against Prayer, who calls it
unseasonable. And I do believe, that the Spirit of God, that led the Man and
Woman to pray, stopped thee, and therefore thou have brought forth this bad
Birth of Lies and Slanders, which thou have cast upon God's People: and before
thou come to try False Worships, or Prophets, or Preachers, thou must deny
the False Spirit in thy self.

R. W. And thou say; I ask, May any Soul out of Curiosity go to hear a
Strange Preacher, in whom I have not Faith, that he is sent from God? p. 65.
especially if there be not a Free Liberty for my Quaeries, and Objections and
Searchings, as the Bereans did.

Answ. Does not R. W. find fault with G. F's. Sense of English, who says, I or
any Soul? but others may have Liberty to go, where thou have not Faith. But if
R. W. and the New England Priests and Professors do practice this Question,
which he asks, then why do not they practice the Royal Law, To do to another,
and let them have the same Liberty, as they would have themselves, which G.
F's. Opposites (which R. W. seems to maintain) would not grant? for Tho.
Good-year was cast into Prison for saying HVM, when R. Baxter was Preaching in
Oliver's days. And why is there not so much Liberty then amongst the
New England Professors and Meeting-Places, but they must be FINED for not going
to hear a Preacher, on whom they have no Faith, nor Liberty to object and
quaery, nor search, as the Bereans did? if R. W. and the New England Priests
granted this Liberty to others, as they would have themselves, their Foundation
had been down ere now: and they needed not to have made Laws, to HANG, WHIP,
BANISH and IMPRISON. And we do take heed what we hear, and how we hear, and
what we join unto, with the Light and Spirit of God; though we are commanded to
try all things, and hold fast that which is Good. And why do thou say, it was
the Unseasonable Spirit of Prayer? because it crossed thee in thy Imaginations
and Evil Work then, which thou now have brought forth?

R. W. And thou say; What do we mean by the Spirit's Quenching? can the
Spirit of God be Really quenched?

Answ. Have not thou often quenched the Motions of it, by following thy
Imaginations, and thy own dark Spirit, and not being led by it? and therefore
does the Apostle Exhort the Saints, Not to quench the Spirit. And when thou
come to obey it, either in Praying or Prophesying, or Rejoicing, or Giving of
Thanks, or Proving all things with it, then thou will know, what it is to
quench it, and to see thy self in the Spirit of the Jews, who were so much
against Christ and his Apostles, and thought, they did God Service in so doing:
and that Light of Christ which thou hate, and the Spirit of God which thou
quenchest, will be thy Condemnation, except thou Repent. But if the
Thessalonians should have asked Paul, Can the Spirit of God be quenched, as
thou do? they that go from the Motions of it, quench it as to themselves, and
come to be led by an Evil, false Spirit, as leads thee; and such come to err
from it and grieve it: but they that obey the motions of it, do receive from
God his Heavenly Refreshings, and are sealed with the Spirit of Promise, Ephesians.
1, 11.

R. W. And thou say; Why do these Lazy Souls so horribly slight Reading and
Studying Books, yea God's Book, as one of their Chief said to me, laying his
hand upon the Bible of Junius, Art not thou past these yet?

Answ. What this One is, he has not named; if this One had been a Quaker, it is
like we should have had his Name in Print: and so this is like the rest of his
Lies. And we do read the Scriptures (if he do mean that to be God's Book) and
also may be some of us have Read other Boo^s, as well as he: and as for his
Scornful Expressions of Proud and Lazy Souls, and Horrible Slighting, these are
the Fruits of his bad Spirit, which he may apply at home. And what good has it
done R. W. all this time, Reading and Studying Books, or God's Book, and bring
forth no better Fruits?

R. W. And thou say; And why do they worship a Dumb Devil in their Dumb
Meetings, and stand still and listen, and lie upon their Beds of Laziness for
Revelations and Notions etc.

Answ. Let the Gentle Reader see, if this be not from R. W's. malicious Spirit.
For first, he has not proved, that we Worship a Dumb Devil in Dumb Meetings;
for he says ( page 64, and 65) That at the General Assembly of the Quakers at
New-port he was stopped by a Woman's Praying and a Man's Praying: Now is not
this a plain Contradiction? and has not R. W. confounded himself here, and his
Evil Birth he has brought forth? We do Wait upon the Lord God in his Spirit
and Light, who Reveals his things unto us by his Spirit: and he does Teach
and Instruct us in the Night-season, and gives us of his Songs, and to stand
still and see our Salvation, and to worship God in the Spirit and Truth, which
thou and the Devil is out of: and to Look unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher
of our Faith. And why do thou scoff at our Listening unto the Lord? for does
not the Lord say; Listen, O ye Isles, unto me, and hearken unto me ye People
afar, for the Lord has called me from the Womb, from the Bowels of my Mother
has he made mention of my Name etc. ( Isai. 49, 1). And as for Lazy
Revelations and Notions, thou must keep that at home, for they are none of
ours; who are Diligent in serving the Lord. And G. F. does not slight any Old
Authors, (who has labored in God's Service, and broken the Ice) as thou
falsely say; but such, as draw People from the Light of Christ within, that
they should see withal, and then stuff People with Old Authors and Lies, which
they Print abroad, as thine is here. And thou say, W. Edm. did frequently
call thee at Newport, Old Man Old Man; which (it seems) thou countest as a
great Disgrace to thee; but that is not to be compared with all thy soul and
ungracious Words in thy Book against us. And do thou see thy self, and how
thou call thy Neighbor White Devil? and what Abusive Names thou have given
to the People of God in scorn called Quakers?

R. W. And thou bring in John Burton (Fol. 206) saying [ It is a Scripture
of the Devil's making, to apprehend Christ within]. G. F. Answers, [If there
be any other Christ, but he who was Crucified, within, he is the False Christ:
and the Scripture holds sorth this, and the Devil never made it; but he and his
Messengers are against it. And he that has not this Christ (that was Crucified
and Risen) within, is a Reprobate; though Devils and Reprobates may talk of him
without.] And R. W. replyeth, p. 66.
and tells a Story of Pagans, Mahometans and Christians and Jews, of their
Dispute about Christ, which is to no purpose.

Answ. The Quakers do acknowledge the Birth, Death and Resurrection of Christ;
and it is to no purpose for thee to allege the contrary (and his Doctrine and
Preachings, and his Apostles) and all this is true.

R. W. And thou say; Certain it is, that he that shall turn over all the
former Relations and Histories, and all the Writings of the Apostles, and
predicate a Christ, that was Risen within, and Crucified within, in opposition
to that Jesus of Nazareth without etc.

Answ. Here do not thou Confess, that that Christ, which dyed at Jerusalem,
must be within People, and not opposite? but what Sun of Righteousness is he*
that shall arise with Healing in his VVings to them that fear God's Name? (
Mal. 4).

R. W. And thou tellest, What the Protestants do believe of the Birth, Life and
Death of Christ etc. and of applying the Promises and the New Covenant etc. and
bargain in his Blood for a New Spirit and a New Heart etc.

Answ. Do not ye believe, that G. F. and the People called Quakers do not know,
that R. W. and the New England Professors and these Persecutors, and his old
Opposers do apply the Promises and the New Covenant to their old Heart and
their Persecuting Spirit? But where is the New Heart, and where is the New
Spirit? and how do ye dye with Christ, and how are ye made Conformable to his
Death? do not the Children of the New Covenant (that are born again of the
Immortal Seed, and are Heirs of the Promise) feel the Blood of Christ in them,
to sprinkle their Consciences etc. and make their Garments white? But where
does Christ or the Apostles use that Expression of a Bargain in Christ's Blood?
where is thy Rule for it in Scripture?

R. W. And thou say; G. F. is believing in a Christ Crucified within, in
opposition to Christ Promised and Prophesied of, brought forth, Living and
Dying, so preached, so believed on; and what a Forehead of Hell must he have,
that calls all those Reprobates and Devils, that talk of Christ without, etc.

Answ. Now, let the Reader see, how R.W. abuses G. F's, Words! For G. F. does
not say, The Devil and Reprobates may talk of a Christ without; but G. F. is
proving, that it is Christ, that was Crucified, and is Risen (to wit, at the
Right Hand of God); it is he, that is to be within his Saints. And we know,
that the Devil and his Messengers cannot endure to hear tell, that Christ
should Rule in the Hearts of his People, because he destroys the Devil from
Reigning: and we know, that the Devil may suffer R. W. to apply to him Christ's
Sufferings, Death and Resurrection and Promises, so that he will not have
Christ to Reign* in him. And we own Christ, as was promised and prophesied of,
and his Birth, Life, Death and Resurrection, and yet manifest within us; who
will Judge the World in Righteousness, and Reward every Man according to their
Works, Glory to God for ever! And as for Forehead of Hell, it becomes R. W.
best; the Sober mind-minded who read his Book, may see his Fruit, (as ye may
see page 66).

R. W. And thou bring The Elders and Messengers of the Churches in Wales
saying, [ We are Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity]. And G. F.
answers (Fol. 214) [And David does not say, YOU, who were Conceived in Sin,
but [ I]: and W. P. says, John was sanctified from the Womb; and the
Scriptures speak of such, as were Sanctified from the Womb, and Children that
were Clean. And so you do not speak, as the Elders and Messengers of the true
Churches, or Men dividing the Word aright; but you are one against another,
though you are all against them you call Quakers, that be in the Truth.] R. W.
replyeth, and falls a railing and says; G. F. discovers to any Intelligent
and Savoury Spirit not only a weak and deluded Soul, but a Popish and Arminian
Poison about the State of all Mankind in the First Birth, p. 67.
a strong Presumption, that he never felt, what the woeful Estate of all Mankind
by Nature is, and what to cry out in his own particular with David, I was
Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity: which Cry is one of the first
Soul-Cries of every Child of God.

Answ. Let the Reader judge betwixt R. W. and G. F. For G. F. does not speak of
the State of all Mankind, but of John Baptist, and such as the Scripture
speaks of, that were Sanctified from the Womb, and such Children, as the
Scripture speaks of, that were Clean (as 1 Cor. 7.) that Paul speaks of:
did John and those that were Sanctified and Clean, cry out to God, that they
were Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity? prove this, or else
confess thy unsavory Spirit and weak deluded Soul. And as for Pope and
Arminian Poison, thou may keep that to thy self. And the Estate of Mankind by
Nature I have known; yet I must put a Difference, as the Apostles and Holy Men
of God have done, and will not say, as thou and thy Messengers of such, as were
Sanctified from the Womb and Clean, That they were brought forth in Sin and
Iniquity. And what is all the Work of R. W. (in his 67 and 68 pages), who
tells of the Pelagians, and the Forces of the Prince of Orange against them?
and David's crying out, that he was Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in
Iniquity? this does not p^ove, that John was Conceived in Sin, and brought
forth in Iniquity, nor prove, that Jeremiah was not Sanctified in the Womb, (
Jer. 1): but here thou have justified the Persecution and the Force against
Pelagians. p. 68.
And thou have rambled over a great deal, and tellest of the Spots of the
Leopards, and the Blackness of the Negroes: and Genesis 6, Psalm. 51, and Romans 5,
all this does not prove, that Jeremiah and John, nor the Children that were
Clean, were brought forth in Iniquity.

R. W. And thou say: These Rotten and Crooked dispositions in every Child
bring forth wild Asses-fruit in Youth etc.

Answ. Wherein did Jeremiah and John Baptist, or such as were Clean or
Sanctified in the Womb, bring forth such Fruits, as thou speak of? prove it
by the Scripture. For thou say, Every Child; here the Child Jesus has not
escaped thy Censure: was not he called a Child? (Luke 2, 27) who was the Holy
One.

R. W. And thou say; The Experience of all the Saints of God in the Holy
Scripture, who maintained a Battle between the Flesh and the Spirit all their
days etc. ( Gal. 5) like the two Houses of Saul and David, in Abraham and
Isaac, Paul and Peter; and Paul crying out, that the Good that he would, that
he did not etc.

Answ. All these Scriptures do not prove, that Jeremiah and John, that were
Sanctified in the Womb, and the Children that Paul speaks of ( Cor. 7, that
he said, were Holy) that they were Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in
Iniquity, because David said, He was. Neither does Gal. 5. say, That the Saints
have a Battle between Flesh and Spirit within them all their days: neither does
the Scripture say, that there was a Battle between the House of Saul and David
all David's days; for David said, All that is within me, praise the Lord: and
his Sins were removed as far, as the East is from the West. Neither did Abraham
nor Isaac say, that they had a Battle in them all their days, nor Paul, nor
Peter; but Paul said, there was No Condemnation to them, that were in Christ
Jesus, who walked not after the Flesh* but after the Spirit: though he had
cried out, That Good that he would do, he did not; but after he says, The Law
of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus has made me free (mark, me Paul free)
from the Law of Sin and Death. Nay, did not he say, They were more than
Conquerours? and does not he say, That he had fought the good Fight, and kept
the Faith? then he was not Fighting, when he had Fought, and was a Conqueror.
And Paul says, I am Crucified with Christ (mark, I AM), and Christ Lives in
me; and the Life that I now live in the Flesh, is by Faith in the Son of God
etc. is not the Faith Victory? And thou fallest a railing, and speaking of our
Conditions, which thou art ignorant of, and thy own, and have abused both the
Scriptures and Us.

R. W. And thou bring John Jackson ( G. F. Fol. 217.) saying, [ False
Prophets and Christ's, and Deceivers many should come, if it were possible, p.
69.
to deceive the very Elect.] And G. F. Answ. [Yea, Christ said, They should
come, to the Apostles; which before their Decease they did come, and went forth
from them, which Christ said, should inwardly Ravin, and get the
Sheeps-Cloathing: which since the Days of the Apostles all the World went
after them, as thou may read in the Revelat: And now are People but coming
from them to the Rock, and now shall the Everlasting Gospel be Preached to them
that dwell upon the Earth, over the Heads of the Beast; and their False Prophet
and they shall be taken, and the Lamb, and the Saints shall have the Victory.]
R. W. replyeth and says; That great Fox the Pope of Rome, and his Foxians (
the Worshippers of the Beast) maintains, that Antichrist is not yet come.
[This is nothing to my Answer]. And thou say; That G. F. etc. cries out
[Anti-Christ, why, he is come and gone long ago], as if False Christ's might not
be then, and now too.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if he has not wronged G. F's. Words; and see, what
Sense thou can make of R. W's. Words. For G. F. does not say, Why, he is come
and gone long ago (to wit, Antichrist) etc. these are thy forged Lies: for we
say, Thou and the New England Priests are in the Spirit of Antichrist, as your
Fruits have manifested: Act. 20, and Matthew. 7, and 2 Pet. 2, and 2 Cor. 11, and
Jude have sufficiently discovered you. And thou runnest on in a long Tale of
Pope and Protestants-to no purpose; but why does R. W. and the New England
Priests cry against the Pope, and are found so much in this Spirit?

R. W. But thou say; What Ignorance does this little Fox, this great Boaster
discover in saying, Now are People come forth from them (to wit, p. 70.
Antichrist) etc.

Answ. Herein thou have discovered thy own Ignorance of both the Scripture and
the Spirit, and Power of God and the Gospel. For we must tell thee and the
persecuting Priests, that the Gospel is Preached again freely, as it was in the
Apostle's days, and People are coming again to the true Lord Jesus Christ by
the Light and Grace of his Everlasting Gospel, from such False Teachers, as
thou and the rest of the Persecuting Priests.

R. W. And whereas thou tellest of the Jews and Romans mocking and murdering
Christ Jesus etc. just as the Pope and the great Fox, and these little Foxians
pretend to be sole Heir unto the Crown of Heaven, p. 71.
and all others Reprobates from their Heavenly Majesty.

Answ. Let R. W. look at home amongst his New England Priests and Professors,
who have mocked and MVRTHERED the Members of Christ: and do not thou
encourage them to Persecute and Punish them? (as in page 200) what could your
Father the Pope do worse, or the Romans, or the Jews? And blessed be the Lord,
we are Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, and do know the Crown of Life: and we do
know, that thou, that do encourage to Punish us, and the Priests, that
Persecuted us, and they that MVRTHERED us, are in a Blind Zeal and Reprobate
Spirit, and Rebel against the Commands of Christ, that said, Love one another,
and Love Enemies: and Christ said, He came to Save Men's Lives, and not to
Destroy them.

R. W. And thou say; The Protestants maintain, that the Pope is the
Antichrist, the Man of Sin, (page 70).

Answ. If R. W. and the Priests and Professors of New England do bring forth
the same Fruits, that the Pope has done, are not they Antichrist?

R. W. And thou bring John Jackson ( G. F. Fol. 218) saying, [" I hope, you
will not Condemn the Generation of the Righteous, because they are not
Perfect.] G. F. Answ. [That which Condemns, is Righteous; it Condemns that
which is not Perfect: and that which is Righteous, is Perfect; and the
Generation that is Righteous, is not to be Condemned.] R. W. Replyeth and says,
That Our selves being Perfect, are not to be Condemned: the Sum of his Answer
is, Himself and the Foxians are Gods, as Pure and as Holy as God is.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there any such Words as these in G. F's. Answer;
and Read G. F's. Answer and see, if R. W. has not forged all these Words;
therefore they are Slanders. But does not the Lord often Command, that his
People should be Holy, as he is Holy? I say, let the Reader examine G. F's.
Answer and see, if he calls Men Gods? Though we cannot deny, but we are the
Temples of the Living God, and that he Dwells in us by his Spirit, as the
Apostle says, Who is in you all, and over you all, God blessed for ever, (Ephesians.
4): again, He that Sanctifies, and they that are Sanctified, are all of One;
thus speaks the Scripture. And R. W. is made to con^ess, that all that is not
Perfect, is not Righteous.

R. W. And after thou have rambled a great while (but nothing to purpose to G.
F's. Answer) thou say; In the last place I affirm (and have made it good)
that the Generation of the Papists and Quakers are so Pure in their own Eyes,
p. 72.73.
yet they are not cleansed from their own Filthiness: the Papists are justly
charged with Superstition and Idolatry, and Drinking the Blood of Saints; and
have not the Generation of the Quakers their Images and Idols also? as I have
manifested their Pride, Ignorance and Idleness in not using Means, and their
Passionate Railings etc. And if this Spirit had got the Sword, it would drink
the Blood of its Enemies, as Heretics, Idolaters, Reprobates and Devils.

Answ. Roger Williams, thou have measured the People of God (in scorn called
Quakers) with thy own Measure and Rule, which thou have put with the Priests
and Professors of New England, and Judge Us thereby like unto Your selves.
Have any of the People called Quakers, that have had the Magistrates Power in
their hands, used any of these Weapons to Dissenters in Rode-Island or
elsewhere? Nay, have not some suffered in New England, and Run the Gantlop,
because they would not take up the Sword? And as for Drinking of Blood,
Railing, Passion etc. let the New England WHIPS, GALLOWS and Laws, and SPOILING
of Goods, and R. W's. own Desire (in his page 200) to Magistrates to Punish us,
speak, which is most like, We or They, to the Papists? And why was our BLOOD
DRVNK in New England? was it not, because we could not bow to their Image they
set up, like Nebuchadnezar and the Papists? And as for Pride, Ignorance,
Passion, Railing, Cursing, let R. W. look at home, and his New England
Brethren, the Priests. And for their Ignorance and Idleness in not using Means,
what Means are they, they should use? any that come from this Persecuting
Spirit? nay, you may keep it your selves: for we do tell thee and the
New England Priests, There is no other Name given under Heaven for Salvation,
than the Name of Jesus. And for Idleness, R. W. may keep that Charge too at
home, that lies Lazily at home Railing in the Woods; for if he be a Minister
of the Gospel, why does he not go and Preach the Gospel to Pope and Turk, he so
much Raileth against behind their Backs? But it is like he will say, He finds
no Call, nor the New England Priests any further, than they can find a great
Benefice: but neither He nor They can say, The People called Quakers are Idle,
that left their own Country and Kindred, to come to New England to Preach the
Gospel freely, whom they WHIPPED, IMPRISONED, BANISHED and HANGED. But thou do
affirm, that the Papists and Quakers are not cleansed from their Filthiness.
Let the Papists speak for themselves: but as for the People of God called
Quakers, thou dare not say, that thou have an Infallible Spirit to Judge; and
therefore thou know not our Condition, and affirmest, thou do not know
what. But we must tell thee, that (as John says) We, who walk in the Light, as
he is in the Light, we have Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of
Christ Jesus Cleanses us from all sin. And because thou art not Cleansed, thou
measurest us by thy self, who art pure in thy own Eyes, but not in the Eyes of
Christ or his People.

R. W. Thou bring the Priest's Words ( G. F. Fol. 220.) saying, [ Man is not
able to Discern the Things of God, till he be Born again]. And G. F. Answ. [
The Scripture speaks of Discerning the Eternal Power and Godhead, and that
was a Thing of the Spirit of God: and the Apostle says not, that they were
Born again. And yet I say, that None knows the Things of God, but by the
Spirit of God; and that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God
has showed it to them: for that of God in them was of the Spirit, who is the
God of the Spirits of all Flesh, which brings them to Discern the Eternal
Power and Godhead.] R. W. replies in a Railing Spirit, and says; With
amazement at the dreadful Justice of God, hardening this daring Soul for
playing away his own Light, and the Name of God, and the Light, which the Lord
has sent him from so many Excellent Pens, out of which he has raked nothing
but handfuls of Reproaches to fling in the Faces of his best Friends, and
turned Truth into Lies and Poison to Murder himself and others.

Answ. Now, let the Reader read G. F's Answer, and R. W's. Reply, and see,
where G. F. has cast any Handfuls of Reproaches in the Faces of those he
calls his best Friends, which were our Old Persecutors in Oliver's days. And
as for Lies and Poison, and Murdering my self and others, thou might have
kept that to thy self, which is sufficiently manifested in thy own Book: but I
know, the Truth is the Savor of Death unto such as thou art, and therefore it
does Amaze thee. For G. F. has not played away his own Light, that God has
sent him, nor his Name; these Words come from thy Frothy, Airy Spirit: but
what! does this prove, that People have not the Spirit of God, nor the Light of
Christ nor his Grace, which they hate, and turn into Wantonness?

R. W. And thou say; The Eternal Power and Godhead cannot be seen by Mortal
Eyes. And again thou say; All Mankind are bound by the Law of their Nature,
to put forth their utmost in searching after God; and we may gain a Great Sight
of the Godhead etc. [Hast not thou Contradicted thy self? p. 74.
for is not Nature Mortal?] And further thou say; Yet this Sight of God,
which Men and Devils may get of God by their Natural Abilities etc. and yet
thou say; No Mortal Eye can see the Eternal Power and Godhead: -- and again,
We may gain a great Sight of the Godhead, and yet not see him, nor glorify
him, that is, Love him, as Paul (1 Cor. 8):

Answ. Here in thy own Distinction thou have Confounded thy self. For first,
thou will grant, that Paul was a Believer (1 Cor. 8); secondly thou say, The
Eternal Power and Godhead cannot be seen by a Mortal Eye: then this great
Sight of the Godhead must be seen by a Spiritual Eye, (according to the
Apostle's Words and thy Consequence) because that which may be known of God, is
manifest in them, for God has showed it unto them. And this must be by the
Spirit, by which they know the Invisible things of him, even his Eternal Power
and Godhead: ( Romans 1) and so it is by the Spirit of God the Things of God are
known, (according to 1 Cor. 2) and such as quench the Spirit, and vex and rebel
against the Spirit of God, and resist the Holy Ghost, and hate the Light of
Christ, and turn the Grace of God into Wantonness, are those Born again of God
his Power and Spirit, or prate like thee in the Imaginations? for John says,
He that is Born of God, overcomes the World.

R. W. And further thou say; Now this Woeful Cheater finding the word Spirit,
confounds (as his course is) all together, and because God's Spirit Regenerates
the Corinthians, and opens to them a Glimpse of the Godhead's Power etc.

Answ. As for Cheating and Confounding, thou may keep those Words at home;
but the Apostle tells the Corinthians (that were the Believers and Babes in
Christ, and Born again) That the Light, which shined in their Hearts, gives
the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus: and
calls this the Light of the Glorious Gospel, which is the Image of God. Now,
has R. W. manifested himself to be Born again, who does not distinguish
between them that is Born of the Spirit, and them that Grieve the Spirit? for
G. F's. Words were, Such as were not Born of God by the Spirit, yet they had
the Spirit, by which they might Know the things of God: for how can they quench
the Spirit and err from it, if they have it not? and how will God Judge the
World in Righteousness, according to the Gospel? And whether is the Gospel
Natural, or all the Judgments of God Natural, or Spiritual? and if Spiritual,
whether or no it is not according to the Divine Light and Grace, that
enlightneth all Men, and his Spirit that he pours upon all Flesh?

R. W. And thou say; I fear that G. F. etc. never Is this Good Sense Roger?
Experimened, though they enjoy in Common a Light of Nature, though God has
Endowed him and many of them with Excellent Natural Parts, yea with a Light
from the Holy Scripture, yea, a Light of Experience and Common Motions from
God's Holy Spirit, and have been lifted up etc. and then thou fear, most of
them will be brought down into Hell, and Cast into great Condemnation.

Answ. R. Williams, thou have showed thy Ignorance of G. F. and the People,
called Quakers, Conditions. What! do thou call the Divine and Heavenly Light
of Christ (which is the Life in the Word) the Light of Nature, which Christ
commands to believe in? this is thy Darkness, which cannot Comprehend the
Light. And as for our Experiences and Knowledge of the Holy Scripture, it is by
this Divine Light and Spirit of the Lord, which if thou did Live in, thou
would never Rail so much against us. And as for thy foolish Fears, I tell
thee, they are Cain's: and as for being lifted up, p. 75.
as Capernaum, and being brought down into Hell and Condemnation, this thou will know, who have been pufft up and erred from that Spirit, which formerly
has opened thee; therefore thou railest against them that walk in it. And
Roger, thou reprovedst G. F. too soon for False English, and Boys English and
Nonsense (as thou call it); but indeed I must needs tell thee, that here is
much False English and Nonsense in thy Book: but whether the Fault be in thee
or the Printer, I shall leave it; but how-ever I think, the Printer, that has
printed thy Book, has grown weary of it, or at least been Careless, for it is
paged 74, 74, 76, 77, 77, 78, 80: what, is this right Roger?

R. W. And thou bringest-in the same Author (Fol. 222) saying, [Salvation and
Faith are the Gifts of God, distinct from Christ]. To this G. F. Answers,
[They are all of him, and from him, and with him: and how is he the Author of
Faith, in whom it ends, from whence it comes?] R. W. replyeth; As Potiphar's
Wife cries out against Joseph, and pretends Chastity, so does this subtle
Whore-monger, pretending, that all is pure Christ, the Light is Christ, their
Hope, Faith, Saints and their own Spirits are Christ, no Distinction between
Christ and them, for they are all of Him, from Him and with Him.

Answ. Thou Justifiest, what thou Condemnest: thou cryest out against
Potiphar's Wife, and thou art guilty Spiritually of the same Evil, that she
would Carnally have committed. Fain would thou have enticed J. T. and others
to thy Polluted and Defiled Bed; and because they would have nothing to do with
thee, nor that Spirit that leads thee, but refused Communion with thee, thou
wipest thy Mouth, and complainest against Joseph, and would bedirt him, now
thou can not have thy will of him, and that he refuses thy Harlotty. Well,
but I am an Whore-monger, yea a Subtle One: how so Roger? how provest thou this
Black Charge? why! because I say, That Salvation and Faith are of Christ, from
Christ and with Christ? behold now, ye New-England-People, what Spirit this Man
is of! what Language he uses! what Comparisons he makes, and Slanders he
casts upon me! And for what does he these things? because I own and declare,
That Salvation and Faith are of Christ, and from Christ, and with Christ. I
hope then, none will say, We, but R. Williams denies Christ: for they that
deny Christ to be the Author of their Faith and Salvation, deny Christ; but
it is plain, that R. W. does so, for his Salvation and Faith is not of Christ:
and what Regard should any have, to what such an Antichrist says? But R. W.
says, that we say, That the Saints are Christ etc. but Roger, these are none
of my Words, but thy False Consequences. But why! is not Christ made to the
Children of Light in this Day Light, Salvation, Hope, Faith etc. as well as he
was made to them Sanctification and Redemption in the Days past? where have
thou been? have thou lost thy Bible as well as thy Religion in the Woods? see,
what comes of thy Unfaithfulness! thou that werest an Opposer of the Priests,
art turned their Orator against the People of God.

But what a Forgery it is in thee Roger, to say, We make the Saints Christ, and
our own Spirit Christ? were those my Words? to God's witness in all Consciences
I appeal against thee in this thing, and let my Book be read: True Christians
are of Christ, yet not Christ, yet One with Christ; 'twas Christ's Last Prayer,
that they should be One in the Father and the Son. And for our own Spirit, it is
enlightened by Christ, but it is not that Light, nor Christ the Light; for he is
our Lord and King, and we are his Servants, and Subjects, and Friends, and
Children: so thy Malice and Ignorance will not do, the Day has discovered
thee. Thou go on to prove, That Christ is not the Saints, nor the Saints are
not Christ: And who said, They were? and call us Ungrateful Monsters, and
such Monstrous Names for believing so, that never believed so, nor never writ
so; it is a Faith of thy own making. Yet Christ is in the Saints, and the Saints
are in Christ: but that the Devil cannot abide, for he would fain get at them,
but that he cannot do, while they are in Christ; and this makes all his
Instruments rage, and thee Roger, amongst the rest. And thou take up much
room to prove, The Saints are not Christ (from Col. 1, ver. 11), and who said,
they were so? so that falls in Corse.

R. W. Next thou say; I know, the Foxians turn Christ, yea his Blood also
into a Spirit, a God.

Answ. Where and when did they so speak or write? this also is one of thy
Calumnies and Lies. Christ's Blood on the Cross for the World we own, and
Christ's Blood and Life we own and partake of, by which we have Life Eternal;
but what have thou to do with Christ's Blood, that art not washed from thy Lies,
nor so much as Repentest of them, that I hear of?

R. W. Thou say; I have heard also the Foolish Blasphemy of one of my own
Neighbors, saying, That the Blood of the Quakers, and by Name of W. B. was
Saving and Salvation to the World. p. 76.


Answ. This is a General Charge, and therefore no Charge, for it is a Charge
against No Body: he names not his Neighbor, nor have we any Evidence of it;
and if he will both add to, take from and wrest our Words, yea invent Lies
against us, as he has done, we have Cause to suspect, that this is a Slander
also.

R. W. Again thou say; What a Proud Frenzy is it in the Quakers, to cry out,
We are the Conduit it self, we are the Wellhead. Fountain and Spring, and ( as
this Frantic Fox once and again affirms) no Distinction between God and
Christ, p. 77.
and his Saints.

Answ. O Roger Williams! that ever thou should at this Age, and after so long
a Profession of Religion, so Irreligiously abuse my Book and me, and those that
read thee! there is nothing I have ever writ to any such purpose, as thou
would have; the Lord Rebuke thee! Nay, thou confessest a little further, that
I call Christ the Author and Finisher of Faith, yea, that I often acknowledge
Christ to be so; how then are we the Wellhead, Spring and Fountain, if Christ
be so: if he be our Alpha and Omega, our Author and Finisher in Faith and
Salvation? Thus thou gropest in the Dark, and ^ontradicts thy self, as all
Babilons-Builders do, which ends in Confusion and Destruction.

R. W. Brings the same Author saying, [ The Light, which discovers Sin and
Iniquity in Man's Heart, is not Christ the Door.] G. F. Answers, [The First
Adam was the Door, where all Sin and Transgression entered; and Christ the
Light, the Second Adam, which does Enlighten every Man etc. says, I am the
Door, the Way, the Truth and the Life etc. which finisheth Sin and
Transgression, and brings in Everlasting Righteousness, and the Way of Life
out of Death: which Light discovers Sin.] R. W. Replyeth, and after he has
rambled a while, he says; What then do these poor deluded Souls tell us of a
Light and Christ within every Man in the World, discovering his Pure Estate, p.
78.
his Foul Estate, and his Raised Estate? which no Man or Woman in this world,
that I ever read or heard of, by Nature had any Spark or Shine of such a Light
etc. but they have read or heard of such things from the Holy Scriptures etc.
Then thou Contradicts thy self, and say in the same Page; It is granted,
that Nature's Light discovers a God, some Sins, a Judgment, as we see in
Indians.

Answ. -- But what Scriptures had Nabuchadnezar and Darius, who spoke of the
Kingdom of God and of Christ? and when he had cast the Three Children into the
Fiery Furnace, what Scripture had Nebuchadnezar for saying, That he saw Four,
and one like the Son of God? -- And what must we observe from R. W's. Words?
that he can see his Pure Estate, and his Foul Estate, and his Raised Estate
without the Light of Christ within him. And thou may say, John was a Deluded
Soul, that came for a Witness to bear witness to that Light, that lights
every Man that comes into the world, which he calls the Light in the Word
(Joh. 1.).

R. W. And thou say; Yea, doubtless Nature's Light is able (in
Self-Deceitfulness) wonderfully to counterfeit true Heavenly Light, and the
Devil seem an Angel or Messenger of Light from Heaven.

Answ. Roger, thou might very well have applied this at home; for these are
none of my Words: for the Light, which I speak of, that Lights every Man,
that comes into world, is Life in the Word, Christ Jesus: and Christ says,
Believe in the Light; and he that believes in it, shall be saved: therefore it
is Saving. And could the Jailer and his Company have seen their Sins, without
the Light of Christ to show them their Sins, with which they might see Christ
their Savior, Physician and Redeemer, who fed them with his Heavenly Bread,
Water, Wine and Oil? but all this is needless and loathsome to thy full, foul
Soul and Stomach. And can any see Christ, that pardons Sin, but by his Light,
by which they see their sins? but thou and all thy Race would see Christ, and
not see your sins; but that cannot be, therefore you hate the Light, because
YOUR DEEDS ARE EVIL.

R. W. Thou say; How poor a Plea is this, Adam was a Door to Sin, p. 79.
therefore Christ is the Door to the Discovery of Sin?

Answ. Have not all dyed in Adam? and does not Christ enlighten very Man, that
comes into the world, that they might see their Sin and evil Deeds, and him
their Savior, and Door and Way again to God? Here thou wrongest G F's Words;
for his Wo^ds are, Christ is the Door, and the Life, which makes an and of Sin
etc. and G. F's Words are not, That Christ is the Door, that discovers Sin.
and with the same Light to see, how their Deeds are wrought in God? and is
this Natural? and is it not Christ, that says, He is the Light of the World,
the Promised Seed? And as for Adam's mincing and excusing his Sin, R. W. says,
All this is Revealed to us; and not a word yet of Christ the Promised Seed, or
a Light Christ, to Convince of Sin (as R* W. says). But by what Means was this
Doctrine Revealed to R. W. and the New-England-Professors, to wit, the State of
the Fall of Adam etc. if it was not Revealed by Christ and his Light?

R. W. Thou say; I know, the Song of this great Deluder is, Turn to the
Light, and Hearken to the Light, thou see, it chideth thee for thy Lying, for
thy Stealing etc. is not this the Christ etc. obey him, and he will teach thee
and save thee. But the bottom is, ^he English and Meaning is, to hearken to
Satan, the God of this World.

Answ. Was it not the Apostle's Doctrine, To turn People from Darkness to
Light? and are they not such, as steal and lie, that will not come to the
Light, because their Deeds are Evil? such as thou art with thy Bottom and
Meaning, to hearken to Satan, the God of this World, to be ruled and guided by
him, and not by the Light of Christ* nor to walk in it? how can thou and the
New-England-Priests be saved by Christ, and cleansed from all Sin, and not walk
in his Light? And is it now become with thee and the New-England-Priests matter
of Delusion, to turn People from Darkness to Light, to walk in it and take heed
to it? and did the Apostle, that turned People from Darkness to Light, turn
People to the God of the World? what Blasphemy is this!

R. W. But thou say; The Scripture is but a Dead Letter, the true Christ is
within thee, he will turn thee from thy Sins, and make thee Perfect as he is:
and he is come in us (Ten Thousand of his Saints) etc. Thus thou mockest.

Answ. R. W. has not proved, that the Letter of the Scripture is Living; for
Christ says, Search (or, Ye search) the Scriptures; but ye will not come unto
me, that you may have Life; for they are they, that Testify of me: they
Testify of the Life; but Christ does not say, They are Life or Living. And
does not Christ show People their Sin, else how does he Convince them of their
ungodly De^ds? And does not Christ say to his Apostles, Be ye Perfect, as your
Heavenly Father is Perfect? and what do thou kick against this Doctrine? We
do confess, that Christ Lives in our Hearts; and if he live not in your
Hearts, you are Roprobates, the Apostle says.

R. W. And whereas he scoffingly says; He within thee, is the Word of God, the
Christ of God, the Light of God, the Spirit of God, God himself, and He seeks
Worshippers in Spirit and Truth. And then thou say; What is in all this, but
the noise of Fenny Bitter in Hollow Canes etc? what is here but that two Common
Businesses may reach to? 1. The Conscience of Good and Evil, which every Savage
Indian in the world has. 2. The Whisperings, the Blindings and Cheatings of
the Devil in Samuel's Mantle.

Answ. Here the Reader may see, that R. W's Words are nothing in Answer to G.
F's. Assertion. But what must we infer from R. W's. Words? but that the
Preaching of the Word of God in the Heart, and Christ within People, except
they be Reprobates; and God Walking and Tabernacling in his Saints; and the
Spirit of God to lead his Saints into all Truth, that they may be his Sons; and
the Light that shines in their Hearts, that gives them the Knowledge of the
Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus; and the Worship of God, that is in
the Spirit, in which he seeks People to worship him; These Doctrines (says
R. W. are such a Conscience of Good and Evil, as every Savage Indian in the
world has. And further he says, These Doctrines are the Whisperings,
Blindings and Cheatings of the Devil, pretending (says R. W.) Vowing and
Swearing to be the Word of the Lord, to be Jesus Christ, yea, and that to your
Feeling etc. This is an Horrid Lie, he knows it in his own Conscience: for we
neither Vow nor Swear; but Christ Jesus the Word we feel to our Comfort and
Salvation: but what Comfort in this Doctrine has he to poor Sinners? And after
this thou Contradictest thy self and say, That Christ Jesus is the Door of
Hope to poor Sinners: here thou grantest, what G. F. asserts, and what thou
have been Cavilling against; and so Contradictest thy self, which is frequent
with thee. But Roger, is the Worship of God in Spirit and Truth a Temporal and
Visible thing? prove this by Scripture; and prove to us by Scripture, That God,
and Christ and his Spirit is called a Conscience of Good and Evil, and
whisperings, and blindings, and cheatings in Samuel's Mantle. Also ( page 74.)
he says to this purpose; Natural Men, until Changed and Born again, do but
prate, as the Devils do: but in Contradiction to that he says ( page 79.) That
it is by Outward hearing or reading, and inward Convictions of Natural
Conscience, God has passed Sentence of Eternal Death: R. W. must this then be
an Inward or Spiritual Hearing of this Sentence? And when People come to see
their Sins by the Light of Christ, then People Cry out to Christ the Savior,
the Gospel, the Good News for Salvation, from him they Receive this Gospel,
their Healing, and Sets them out of Prison, and free from their Sin: and
with his Light it is, they see themselves Blind, and with his Light they see
his Spiritual Eye Salve, and his precious Blood which Cleanses from all Sin.
But these are too good and soft Words for thy foul Spirit and full Stomach, who
have cast out so many Lies against God's People.

R. W. And thou bringest-in Ellis Bradshaw (Fol. G. F. 224.) saying, [There is
more Words than one.] G. F. Answ. [God is the Word, p. 80.
and the Scriptures are the Words, which Christ fulfilleth.] And R. W.
replyeth, As the Design of the Bloody Pope and Jesuits are to kindle Wars
between the Protestants, that the Protestants may do the Papists work; so deals
the Devil, the old Serpent with Christ Jesus and the Holy Scripture, which are
but one in a Sense, as the Sun and the Sun-Dial: his end is, to tear down the
Sun-Dial etc. under pretense, that the Sun is within them, and they need no
Dials or Clocks, no Visible thing, that is Temporal etc. and so to destroy the
Person and Commands of Christ as Visible and Fleshly, pretending all to be
Light and Spirit.

Answ. Reader, what is this to G. F's. Answer? But R. W. have not the
New England Priests and Professors done the BLOODY Pope's work, as thou call'st
him? and art not thou a doing it? and would they be so careful of the
Scripture, but that they make a Trade of it; and under a pretense of Scripture
and Dials without, do the Devil's work to throw at the Spirit and Christ in
Peoples Hearts, and tear him out there, if you could? But I must tell thee R.
W. that as to Christ himself and his Person, though he was Dead, yet he is
Alive, and Dies no more; and he is out of your Reach, and you cannot persecute
him any more: though they and thou may persecute him in his Members, that keep
the Commands of Jesus. And as to Visible and Fleshly pretending, and the
Visible and Temporal things, thy Clocks and Dials, (which are thy Helps to know
the Invisible) know this, thou may pore on them, till thy Eyes rot in their
Holes, and never know the Lord Jesus Christ, but by Revelation.

R. W. Thou say; The word Dabar in Hebrew, and Logos in Greek signify the
Word etc. and that it is a Metaphor to say, God is the Word; for God is no more
a Word, than he is a Man or a Spirit* etc.

Answ. Do thou not here gainsay John's Doctrine, who says, The Word was
God? and will thou give Christ the Lie, that says, God is a Spirit? ( Joh. 4.)
but prove this by Scripture, that John did say, That it is a Metaphor, to call
God the Word. Then do not thou Contradict thy self and say, [ The Man
Christ Jesus is called the Word] but was not he called the Word, that was
called God? and did not this Word take Flesh? did Christ suffer and die, as he
was God, or according to the Flesh, since it is said, The Word lives, and
abides, and endures for ever? Thou say, That G. F. confesses, that the
Scriptures are the Words of God: so here thou yieldest to G. F's. Answer;
though thou make a great Smoke with words to no purpose.

R. W. Thou say; I do affirm, the Sun, and the Moon and the Stars are the
Words of God etc. and the Rain and the Hail, p. 81.
and the Gras^ and the Corn, and the Sand etc.

Answ. These R. W. calls the Words of God; but where does R. W. find in the
Scriptures, that they are called the Words of God? give us Chap. and Verse. And
as for David ( Psalm. 107.110: and Job. 33. Luke 1.) what is all this to the
purpose? these Words are owned, but not R. W's. Imaginations.

R. W. Thou say; They rob the Scriptures of their Heavenly Title of the Word
of God etc. and also turn this Word of God and Christ into a Spirit without any
Body etc. and part him ( his God head from his Manhood) into a Fancy, p. 82.
a Dream, a mere Whimsy and Devilish Imagination.

Answ. We Rob not the Scriptures of their Title: thou pretendest thy self a
Scholar, and do not thou know, that Scriptures signify Writings, and are
called so by Christ and his Apostles? and we charge R. W. to show, where the
Scriptures do give themselves the Heavenly Title of the Word of God? And these
are Words of thy own Inventing, as to say, Christ is a Spirit without any Body,
and our Parting his God head from his Manhood; this is thy own Fancy or Dream,
Whimsy or Devilish Imagination, thou speak of: as the Reader may see, there
is no Ground for R. W's Words in my Answer. And as for thy saying, we would Run
the Scriptures out of the world, and by seeming to embrace it, destroy and kill
it; These are more false words of thy own Inventing: the Lord knows, we
esteem of the Scriptures more than thou, by the Spirit, that gave them forth.

R. W. And thou bring Tho. Weld ( G. F. Fol. 228.) saying, p. 83.
[ There lies a Mystery of Iniquity, for to say, The World calls them so, by
such and such Names, or gives them their Christian Names.] G. F. Answ. [There
are Names given by the Heathen, the Heathen outwardly, by which Men are called;
there is a New Name written in the Book of Life, which the World knows not:
here is the New Man known after God in Righteousness, Created unto true
Holiness. Now, who is this New Man and this New Name? the World may call him by
the Old. So it is not a Mystery of Iniquity to say, The World calls him so.] R.
W. Replyeth; As to Christian Names or things bearing or pretending to bear the
Name, Authority or Uniting of Christ Jesus ( as we know, the word Christian
signifies) etc. and thou say; Every Christian Soul should search into the
Rise, and Practice and Warrant of them with holy Fear and Trembling in the
Presence of God.

Answ. What is this to the New Name written in the Book of Life, to tell us
what a Christian signifies? but if thou werest united to Christ, thou would
not persecute him in his People. Neither if thou werest in the Practice of that
holy Fear and Trembling in the Presence of God, thou would not have uttered
forth so many Lies and Scorns against them, that be in his Holy Fear, and
Tremble at his Word.

R. W. Thou say; Is it not a proud Trick of a Pharisee, thus to scorn the
poor Heathens and Publicans, as not worthy to know the Quakers high Names, or
to take up such Sacred Names and Mysteries upon their Lips? yea, is it not a
Ridiculous Fancy thus to prate and ( like Pharisees) to scold about washing of
Hands, and Pots and Cups, therein placing invented Holiness etc. Who are G.
F's. Heathen? etc.

Answ. Such as thou, R. W. that know not this New Name written in Heaven,
who call it a Ridiculous Fancy, and comparest it to the Pharisees washing of
Hands, Pots and Cups, and invented Holiness: and this is an Invented Lie of thy
own to say, That we scorn the poor Heathens and Publicans. And R. W. why do
thou so rage against me? because I tell thee, The New Man has a New Name? And
then thou tellest us of the Jew and Gentile, and how that Lea and Rachel did
give Names, that were sign^ficant unto the Twelve Patriarch's: and R. W. who
knows not this, or who opposes it? what is this to G. F's. Answer?

R W. Thou say; Does Christian Regeneration or New Birth destroy Natural
Births or Marriages, p. 84.
or Names and Educations?

Answ. Where did ever any of the Quakers say, they did? or G. F. in his Answer
destroy or slighted any of these things? so, it is a vain Question, -- And thou
say, They quarrel about Straws; when it is thy self, that set them up
and do it.

R. W. And thou say; What is this New Creature and New Name they speak of?
how shall the World call them by it, if they know it not?

Answ. Why is this? because thou and the World hate this Light, by which it is
seen and known.

R, W. Says; Such are their Non-sensical Fancies of giving no Repect to any in
Word or Gestures, such are their Fantastical Conceited Answers, who being
asked, where they dwell? they answer, they dwell in God; and where they live?
they answer, they live in God.

Answ. And what must we observe from R. W. here? but that he would have his
Honor and Respect, Pharisee-like, which Christ forbad, and cried Woe against:
and Christ says, How can you believe, that se^k Honor one of another, and
seek not the Honor, that comes from God only. And R. W. what! is it a
Fantastical Answer, to say, That God's People dwells in God, and lives in
God? and does not the Apostle say, In him we Live and move, and have our Being
( as the Poet says) for we are his Offspring?

R. W. Thou say; Are not They to the Popes a Kin, because they sling to the
World their Old Names.

Answ. Nay, we say, That Thou and the New-England-Professors are a Kin to the
Pope both in Nature and Spirit; and your Nature of Dogs and Swine, Wolves and
Lions is not turned into Sheep, and Lambs and Doves. And here thou grantest,
that as the Nature is changed, the Name is changed: but thy Tenth and your
Fruits have manifested you to be the Dogs and Wolves.

R. W. Says; That G. F. having attained a great Marriage, and a new Carriage
and Civility -- and his own former Rigidity --.

Answ. R. W. has manifested his own Ignorance of G. F. and he is busy about
that which does not concern him: for G. F. is of the same Carriage, Civility
and Courtesy, as he was at the First.

R. W. Thou say; I am sure, they will do most them Is this Good Sense (...)?
for worldly Advantages: for as they abuse the Scripture (Eccles. 11) The World
is in their Heart; I may truly use it, and affirm it, the World and the Pride
and the Advantage of it ( though they deny it, as the Pope and Cardinals do) is
in their Hearts, and is the Body and Soul, p. 85.
and Root and Branch of their whole Religion.

Answ. Truly R. W. we may use the Proverb and say, Thy Tongue is no Slander;
for thou art given up to Lies, and abusest us with them. Neither do we abuse
the Scriptures, but esteem of them: and as for the Pope etc. thou should
have gone to Rome, and told them these Words. And as for Worldly Advantages,
and Religion rooted upon, It is not our Religion; but has been the Religion of
New England: as witness, their SPOILING of our Goods, worse than ever did the
Papists.

R. W. Brings (from G. F's. Fol. p. 243) Richard Sherlock's saying, [ We must
not look for an Immediate, Extra-ordinary, Miraculous Teaching from the Lord.]
G. F. Answ. [Yet he says, All Men are Taught Of God; what Confusion is here?
The Grace of God: which brings Salvation, has appeared unto all Men; and
this he calls an Outward Teaching by the Lord Jesus Christ: is that which
brings Salvation, Outward? all in the Truth may judge this, and try thy
Spirit. And the Teachings of the Lord are not only Mediate, but Extra-ordinary
also above all Yours, which are Men got up since the Days of the Apostles.] R.
W. replyeth and says; Although I have spoken before of their Immediate
Inspirations, yet seeing, how greedily and boastingly this Deluded Soul with
Scorn and Contempt of all his Opposites sucks in the Poison of Devilish
Inspiration instead of the pure Wine and Milk of the Christian Truth, and milks
out this Poison into the Mouths of his Poor bewitched Followers.

Answ. Let the Reader observe, what Railing Expressions he gives in the Front
of his Reply! that God's Teaching in his Covenant of Grace, and by his Spirit
he calls B^^sting, Deluded Souls, Scorn and Contempt, a Sucking-in of Poison
and the Devil's Inspiration, bewitching his poor Bewitched Followers, that
follow God's Teaching; as though God's Teachings were not pure Wine and Milk
and Christian ^r^ths: but God's Immediate Teaching is Poison to R. W.

R. W. says, That G. F. affirms, That the Teachings of the Lord are not
Mediate, but Immediate and Extraordinary etc. Contrary to the whole Stream of
the S^^^^^tes and Experience; Contrary to Psalm. 9. Contrary to God's Teachings
in every Man's Nature -- and God's Teaching the Fowls -- and Abraham's Teaching
his Children -- and the ordinary Teaching and Feeding by Shep-herds, -- and
Contrary to the Teaching of the Holy Scriptures written by the Immediate Breath
of God. p. 86.
-- This great Wrester of Holy Scriptures says, They shall be all Taught of
God: and Contrary to the Ordinary Teachings of the Priests and Levites etc.

Answ. The Teaching of God in his New Covenant is, as the Apostle says ( Heb.
8.) The Lord says, I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write them in
their Hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People:
and they shall not Teach every Man his Neighbor and every Man his Brother,
saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the Least to the Greatest
etc. and Isaiah says ( Chapter 54.) All thy Children shall be Taught of the Lord;
and Christ says ( Joh. 6.) All thy Children shall be Taught of God: and this
of God's Teaching in the New Covenant is above Nature's Teaching, and Outward,
Mediate Teaching, and the Priests and Levites Teaching in the Old Covenant. And
this is not Contrary to the Scripture, nor true Experience, but according to
it; and not Wresting the Scriptures, which says, They shall be all Taught of
God. And as for Abraham's Teaching, and that in Psalm. 9. and the Apostle's
Teaching, what are your Teachers to them? who are got up since the Apostles.
And if the Scriptures were written by the Immediate, Divine Breath of God, and
they were made Ministers by Divine Revelation; can any understand the
Scriptures, but by the Divine Spirit? and is that Mediate or Immediate? And
does not Moses say, A Prophet will God raise up unto you etc. and him shall ye
hear: and he that will not hear this Prophet, shall be cut off.

R. W. Says, What is there in G. F's. wild Notion? [Can that, which brings
Salvation, be Outward?] etc.

Answ. The Grace of God, which has appeared to all Men ( which brings
Salvation) Teaches us, that denying Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, and to live
soberly and Godly etc. ( Tit. 2.) and this thou call a Wild Notion: but that
is thy own and wilful Ignorance. And is this Grace of God Outward, which
brings Salvation? And as for our Men- and Women-Apostles their Teaching, p.
87.
it is in the Power and Spirit of Christ; and they turn People from Darkness to
Light, and so to God and Christ's Teaching, and to the New Covenant; and do not
keep People always under Teaching, saying like the New-England-Priests. But
thou would see a Sign and a Miracle, like the Adulterous Generation, the
Priests, Scribes and Pharisees, thy Forefathers. And as Assisted by the
Devil's Doctrine, R.W. this suiteth thy own Spirit best: and thou have proved
nothing against us, but thy self to be a Liar, and Ignorant of God's Teaching
in his New Covenant.

R. W. Thou say; While they cry out, Light, Light, there is none (as Isaiah
speaks) not a Spark of Light within them.

Answ. Here thou wrongest Isaiah's Words, and thou bring them in Opposition
to the New Covenant, and give the Apostle the Lie, who says; God, who
commanded Light to shine out of Darkness, has shined in our Hearts, to give us
the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ:
which we and all true Christians have and witness in our Hearts. And what must
we Conclude from R. W's. Words? That he and the New-England-Priests have not a
Spark of the Light within them, that the Apostle speaks of: John tells you,
Your Darkness cannot comprehend it. Then thou and you are Pitiful Blind
Teachers, Disputers and Orators: and ye are like to be no other, that call
Light Darkness, and Darkness Light.

R. W. Goes on to his 43 Instance, where he brings-in Christopher Wade ( G. F.
Fol. p. 247.) saying, [ The written Word is the Sword of the Spirit: and he
makes another Rule beside the Scripture False.] G. F. Answ. [Which (we say) is
the Spirit, which gave them forth, whereby Peace is known upon the Israel of
God. And the Pharisees had the Scripture, but had not the Sword of the Spirit:
the Scriptures testify of the Sword of the Spirit.] R. W. says; I reply and
affirm, The Spirit of God cannot here be the Sword intended And yet in thy book
called Experiments (16^2) thou call the Holy Spirit the Two-edged Sword
(Epistle Dedicar. to Lady Vane): see his Contradiction here.
. 1. This Spiritual Furniture being a Similitude taken from Warlike Furniture,
Helmet, Breast Plate, Shield, Shoes etc. and every one applied to Gifts and
Means flowing from God's Spirit, as Faith, Hope, Sincerity etc. it were most
improper then, to bring in God or the Spirit to be the Sword or any of the
other Pieces. 2. There is no more Reason to make the Spirit of God to be the
Sword, than the Shield. 3. It seems too Low to the Holy Spirit and God to be
here in this Similitude.

Answ. Stay Roger, to the First; If the Written Word be the Sword of the
Spirit, then before the Written Word was, it seems, the Spirit had never a
Sword? which is false: it had as good a Sword before, as since. To the next: It
is not a distinct Gift (though a distinct Name) but a distinct Operation: and
that thou shall know. Yet if the Spirit be God (notwithstanding it proceeds
from the Father and Son) and the Spirit of God be God (as thou confessest): so
may the Sword of God be God, and the Sword of the Spirit be the Spirit. -- To
thy Second Particular: Why not a Shield, as well as a Sword? Right; and it is
so: This shows thy Ignorance of God, his Spirit, Scripture and Experiences of
the Holy Men of God of Old. Was not God David's Buckler and Shield? and was not
God's Name a Tower of Defense? and is that distinct and separate from God?
Again, is not God's Word as a Fire? and is not the Holy One of Israel a Flame?
yea, Everlasting Burnings, that will consume thy Chaff and Stubble? and
therefore is that Word not God? or is that Fire or Flame not the Word? -- To
thy Third Allegation: That it is below God's Spirit to be so called or
resembled; this still shows thy Ignorance: Why not to a Sword as well as to a
Lion, a Rock, a Door, a Man of War, a Captain, a Stone etc? and is not a Sword
the Emblem of Justice, God's great Attribute?

R. W. But thou go on, saying: (4) This was the Sword, the Only Sword, is
called a Sword, with which the Lord Jesus fought and vanquished the Devil, p. 88.
It Is Written, it is Written: and we may well say of it, as David of the Sword
of Goliath, by which David cut of his Head, There is none to that* etc.

Answ. O Roger, thy great Stupidity! was the Written Word Christ's Sword, yea,
his Only Sword? the Spirit and Power of God is excluded then. And if it be,
what had Christ, that the Devil had not? for he used the Written Words, and
therefore Christ said, It Is Written, it is Written; and so said the Devil:
because Satan began with him with a Scripture in his Mouth. And so, according
to R. W. the Devil had the same Only Sword, that Christ had. But consider what
thou say, And yet in another Place R. W. says, The Scripture is of no Value
without the Spirit.
The Scripture is the Only Sword: Roger, what Scripture had Christ ^or his
saying, Get thee hence, Satan? Did not he with these Words rebuke the Devil,
and by his Power resisted him, and over-came him? because thou say, The
Scripture is the only Sword, with which the Lord Jesus fought, and vanquished
the Devil: show us that Scripture, from which Christ had that Rebuking,
Resisting Sword, when he said, Get thee hence, Satan.

But what became of poor Abraham, Enoch, Lot and the Patriachs, if the Written
Word be the Only Shield, Sword etc. that had no Written Word? But do thou not
commit Idolatry? consider it well; to say, There is none like to the Written
word: What was that Word, when it was never written or spoken, that Burnt as a
Fire in the Prophets, that which came to them, before Writings were, and of
which Writings do but declare, that was an Ax, an Hammer, a Sword, a Fire etc?
is the Written Word more powerful than that? yea, than the Word in the Heart,
the Word of Regeneration and Reconciliation, the Word that was God, that made
all things? O Idolatry! O Blasphemy against God, Christ and Holy Spirit!
Besides Roger, did Christ the Lord of the New Covenant make the
Old-Testament-Writings his Only Sword? for there were no New-Testament-Writings
then; if so, then either the New-Testament-Writings are none of the Sword, or
the Sword was Imperfect: how say thou to that? -- But Roger, remember; 'Twas
not principally Goliah's Sword, that Killed Goliath; but the Stone: so the Stone
cut out of the Mountain without Hands, (which the Written Word was not) is
that, which smites the Image, and brings it down; and will bring down thy
Images and Imaginations, with which thou puffest up thy self in the Pride of
thy Airy and Luciferian Mind against God, his Truth and People. -- Again, the
Sword, that cut off Goliah's Head, was that which Goliath used, as well as
David; but the Stone was that which slew him, that he despised, as thou do
the Light and Spirit of Christ, and which Goliath could never use: which may be
called a Figure of Christ, and not of the Scriptures, that wicked Men use as
well as good.

R. W. But go on; The Holy Spirit, Christ and God are Authors of all those
Heavenly Gifts and Graces, the Beginner and Finisher of Faith, and therefore
not Faith nor Hope.

Answ. Here thou prevaricatest and abusest me. Did I say, the Spirit was Faith
or Hope? or Faith or Hope the Spirit? read my words again, even as thou lay'st
them down. But why may not Faith and Hope be called the Spirit, that begets
them, as well as Christ is called Sanctification and Redemption? but thou art
blind. Again, the Question is about the Spirit's power being its own Sword: the
Sword the Spirit, the Spirit the Sword of God, and not Faith or Hope the
Spirit. But that the Word of God (Ephesians. 6, 17) which the Apostle calls the
Sword of the Spirit, is the Spirit, and not the Letter, is clear from the Greek
which is thus; (...): where the Article (...) being in the Neuter Gender, is
relative to (...), which is also in the Neuter; whereas (...) is Foeminine: and
therefore the true English Translation of these words is thus: And the Sword of
the Spirit which (Spirit) is the Word of God. And so does Clarius (one of the
Critics) understand them (as may be seen Tom. 7. Crit. p. 3480.) and he does
observe, that the words are an Hebraism; The Sword of the Spirit, that is to
say, the Spiritual Sword, or the Sword of the Spirit it self, or the Sword
which is the Spirit, and that is the Word of God: for Christ, whose Name is the
Word of God, is the Quickening Spirit. Even as when he says, the Breast Plate
of Righteousness, he understands the Breast Plate, which is Righteousness:
and the Shield of Faith, that is, the Shield which is Faith: so, the Sword of
the Spirit, that is, the Sword which is the Spirit. Thou talkest of thy
Learning and Experience, and either can not, or else deceitfully wilt not
distinguish between Gifts and Operations: Faith and Hope are Gifts to us that
believe; but the Sword, Fire, Ax, Hammer, Iron Rod, Honey, Balm, etc. are names
for the diverse Operations of the same Power.

R. W. But thou say; Christ and the Sword with Two Edges (which comes forth
of his mouth) are distinct, and cannot be the same.

Answ. But where is thy Reason for this? or where is thy boasted Experience?
What! is that which goes out of Christ's mouth, that which is not of him? was
not that of Christ, that he breathed upon his disciples, when he said, Receive
ye the Holy Ghost? what was that a Figure of, if not of a Participation of his
own Breath, Life and Spirit? and if so, it seems, this that comes out of
Christ's mouth, must be his breath. By the Brightness of his Coming, and the
Breath of his mouth he shall destroy the man of sin (that is, by his Spirit:)
what now Roger, is it not Christ's Breath, that goes out of his Mouth, that
destroys? and is it not his Breath his Spirit? does not both the Hebrew and
the Greek say so? wherefore the Sword with Two Edges, that comes out of
Christ's mouth, is the Spirit, by which he destroys and will destroy the man
of sin* and all such scornful men as thou art, if you repent not.

R. W. The^e great Interpreters are confounded in themselves: for in Ephesians. 4.
the Spirit must be the Sword -- but in Hebr. 4. Christ must be the Sword with
two edges, being the Word of God, and not the Spirit.

Answ. Thou writest, as if thou ravest: there is no such passage in Ephesians. 4.
Next for Hebr. 4, there is no such thing, as making Christ the Two-edged Sword.
For the words are, That the Word of God is sharper, then any Two-edged Sword;
but that the Scriptures are not Christ and the Spirit (as thou would have it)
neither can they pierce even to the dividing asunder of soul and Spirit, and of
the joints and marrow: nor are they a discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of
the Heart; this were to make the Scripture a Spiritual and Invisible Being, yea
an Omnipresent one, yea God. For they declare, that he that searches the
Heart, and tries the Reins, and tells unto man his Thoughts, the LORD OF
HOSTS is his Name. Thou art like the Apostate Jews, that by thinking to Honor
the Scripture, dishonor God, Christ, Spirit and Scripture too. But thou
call us Juglers, for shifting from Christ to Spirit, and Spirit to Christ
again; what Unsavory Words have thou? Is not Christ Jesus called the Word of
God? and is he not called the Quickening Spirit? and is not the Spirit Christ's
Spirit? and can Christ be separated from his own Spirit? but thou art Ignorant
of that Union, being in the Death and Alienation from Christ and his Spirit.

R. W. But it is Objected by G. F. That the Spirit was before the Scripture,
and gave forth the Scripture. I answer, What then? G. F. is before his Book,
and gave it forth; is it not therefore G. F's. Word and Writing, but G. F.
himself? Or, is not the King's Majesty before his Declaration to the World? is
it not therefore the King's Word, or is it the King himself?

Answ. What I say, is true, and R. W. shall not be able to deny it, if he own
plain Scripture. For before the Scriptures were, the Word was: it was In the
Beginning; so were not the Scriptures. The Word was with God, and was God; so
were never the Scriptures: All things were made by it, that were made: but
nothing was ever Created by the Scriptures: therefore not the Word of God, but
Words. Again, the Word of God, that came to the Prophets, was not the Written
Word, yet the Word: therefore the Written Word was not that Word; but a
Declaration of that Word, and came from the Word: so that which was before the
Scriptures, and from whence they came, is the Word, and not themselves. So,
that what thou Alludest to, confounds thy self: G. F. is before his Writing;
and the Writing is not G. F: the King is before his Declaration, and the
Declaration is not the King. In like manner, the Word is before the Scripture,
and the Scripture is not the Word, but a Declaration of that Word, and the
Words of that great Word. So we are for the Form of Sound Words, that proceed
from that Divine Word, that dwelt in Enoch, Abraham and the Patriarchs, before
the Scriptures were; and in the Holy Prophets and Apostles, before they gave
forth the Old- and New-Testament-Writings: which they directed the Ancient
Saints to, and desired, that it might dwell richly in them.

R. W. Thou say: This Immediate Inspiration of the Holy Scripture from the
Spirit makes it a Word so powerful -- a Standard, Touchstone or Weights so
perfect for the Trial of all Spirits, Writings, Doctrines, Religions, Worships,
Actions etc.

Answ. The Immediate Inspiration of the Holy Scripture is no Scripture-saying,
neither can the Scripture Inspire. Thou bringest-in, From the Spirit: if thou
meanest, that they are Given forth by Inspiration, we own it: if thou intendest
more, it is Erroneous: for Inspiration is by the Spirit of God only. Now, the
Scripture is a S^aled Book to thee and thy Generation, neither know thou the
Meaning of it; for it is only given to the Spiritual Man to Discern, he that is
lead and guided by the Spirit: but thou shuttest the Spirit out; the Scripture
is sufficient. Wherefore thou art ignorant of the Scriptures; for they are not
to be learned, but by the Spirit, that gave them forth: they are shut up from
all the Wisdom of this World, therefore the Jews understood them not: but
persecuted Jesus by them (as they d^rkly imagined) as thou do us, and
thought, in them to find Eternal. Life, and not in Christ, whom they discerned
not, as thou do not the Children of Light.

But do the Scriptures try Spirits? they say; the Anointing is to do it: whom
shall we believe? But Roger, Trial of Spirits is more than Trial of Doctrines,
Writings and External Truth. What! if a Man profess all the Doctrines of the
Apostles, and were outwardly not to be condemned in his Conversation; yet might
have a Deceitful Spirit to gather to himself, and endeavor to supplant the
true Servants of God and an all occasions use the Words of the Prophets and
Apostles, and say, Thus says the Lord, but God never spoke by him; how would
thou try this Spirit and this Power? what Chapter or Verse would give thee a
Savor and Discerning of the Spirit of this Deceiver, this Wolf in the
Sheeps-Cloathing, to try not the Words, but the Nature, Life and Spirit, that
uses them? But it has ever been the Devil's Way in his Instruments, since the
Scriptures were given forth, to pretend to Stand up for the Scripture; when the
Design is, to war against, and undervalue the Power, Spirit and Anointing,
endeavoring to bring it into Disgrace. But the Lord beholds these things, and
he will overtake such Evil Instruments with his Judgments: and his Power, and
Spirit, and Seed of Life, and Holy Anointing, which the Scriptures of Truth
testify of, shall appear more and more, and go over all.

R. W. Thou say further; But the Pharisees, says G. F. had the Scriptures,
but they had not the Sword of the Spirit. I answer: The Jews had and have, and
so the Turks have had much of it, the Papists and the Quakers, and other
Blasphemers, and the Devils themselves may have the Scripture, the Word of God
in their Hands and Mouths. For may not a true Sword, a choice Sword be in a
Mad-Man's Hand, whereby he may mischief, and wound and kill himself and others?
hence Men make Merchandise of it, Sophisticate, and Adulterate, and turn it
into a Lie etc.

Answ. The Strength of this Argument is; That as a Madman may have a Sure and
Choice Sword in his Hand, so may a Bad or Wicked Man have the Sword of God's
Spirit in his Hand. O Blindness! O thick Darkness! how art thou be nighted,
that thou should thus grossly write! When did the Word of God come to Wicked
Men? how often did Wicked Men receive God's Word? for the one is a Fire, the
other is Stubble; the one a Sword, or Ax, and the other an Old Rotten Tree. But
Roger, is it not a saying of Wonder amongst Men's, What! put a Sword in a
Mad-Man's Hand? and does God put his Sword into Mad or Bad Men's Hands? what
do thou make of the Lord? one like unto thy self? tremble at thy Presumption
and Wickedness! What! can Wicked, Carnal and Devilish Men handle God's
Heavenly, Spiritual and New-Covenant-Weapons? But Roger, can Wicked Men handle
the Fire, and wound and kill with this Spiritual Sword? what do they kill? not
the Good; for God's Sword will wound and kill nothing, but Wickedness: so this
is no Mischief. And when did Wicked Men war against and kill. Wickedness with
God's Sword, whilst they remained wicked themselves? A Kingdom divided against
it self cannot stand. So that, though Madmen may do Mischief with a Sword; yet
Bad Men cannot with the Word of God: wherefore Bad Men are as good Servants and
Soldiers, as Good Men, for they Fight with the same Weapon it seems, against
the same Wickedness. But Roger, when did the Scriptures kill any Body, or do
any Mischief? for so thy Folly has driven thee to say. Again, is God's Sword so
common? has he no more Care of his Weapons, than to arm his Enemies with them?

But every Sword must have an Edge; God's has Two: which be they? And since a
Sword can do no Execution without a Hand, the Scripture is unable, unless it
has a Hand to use it: what Hand is this? not the Spirit, R. W. affirms; who
then? Wicked Men as well as Good Men. This is the Doctrine of R. W. Dedicated
to the King, R. Baxter and J. Owen, as the New England -- Priests Orator
against the People of God called Quakers. But what is his Reason for this?
because (says he) Men make Merchandise of it, Sophisticate and Adulterate, and
turn it into a Lie. Roger, These are the truest Words, thou have said yet: you
New-England-Priests have made Merchandise of the Scripture, we know very well,
you have Sophisticated and Adulterated them with your Inventions, and turned
them into a Lie, and made them to speak or mean, what they do not mean; and yet
call this the Mind and Sense of Scripture, being dark in your Imaginations, and
rebelling against the Light, that should enlighten you. But none can sell the
Lord's Sword, nor Sophisticate, nor Adulterate, nor turn a Sword into a Lie.
Nor can God's Sword be lost, broken, torn, burnt, drowned, moulder'd, or any
otherwise perish, as the Scriptures have by Carelessness, Age, in Fires, in
Ship-wracks, or on purpose by some Wicked Men. And had thou known that Word,
that is a Fire, an Ax, a Sword etc. thou would not have writ such Blind
Stuff, as thou have done: which shall be thy Burden one day. Nor is this to
slight the Holy Scriptures; but such unholy ones as thou art, that war against
God's Spirit, under pretense of standing for the Scripture, that came from it,
which thou understandest not; but we dearly own, and love and honor them: and
they are good for Instruction, Doctrine and Reproof, that the Man of God may be
Perfect through the Faith, that is in Jesus.

But do not you New-England-Priests make Merchandise both of Scripture, that
you call the Word, and Christ and his Blood, and Miracles, Death, Resurrection
and Ascension, that have so much a Year for telling Stories and your
Imaginations of him? did the Apostles so? And R. W. as Nathan said to David,
Thou art the Man: as they that read thy Former and Latter Writings, may see;
for thou have Sophisticated, Corrupted and Adulterated the Scriptures of Truth
(which thou callst the Word of God) by mixing and adding of thy Imaginations
with God's Openings and Discoveries, which thou might have formerly had in
thy younger Years, when there was some Simplicity in thee, and thou werest
under Sufferings for thy Conscience. But now thou say, There is neither
Motion nor Voice within to hearken to, to turn to, to listen to in Heavenly
things, in matter of Supernatural Light. Though again thou say ( page 28.)
I find in all Mankind a Conviction, that God is -- Again I find, there is
generally in all Mankind in the World a Conviction of an Invisible, Omnipotent
and Eternal Power and Godhead. And Roger, is not this in all Mankind to be
lissen'd unto?

R. W. Thou bring Henry Hagger ( G. F. Fol. 253.) saying, p. 89.
[ You call all Men Dead and Carnal, in the Serpent's Nature, in what Form
soever, if they differ from you.] G. F. Answ. [All that be not in the Light,
that enlightneth every Man, that comes into the World, which is the Way to the
Father, differ from us; such be Dead, such be Carnal, in the Serpent's Nature:
for none comes to the Life, but who comes to the Light, in what Form soever
they be. And such as differ from us, differ from Christ: for none comes from
under the Serpent's Head and Nature, but who comes to the Light.] R. W.
replyeth and says; The Quakers and Papists are of a Damning and Damned Spirit,
as David says of some, whose Teeth were as Swords; and Solomon says, There is
a Generation -- whose Teeth are as Swords --

Answ. And these are R. W.'s. and the New-England-Priests Teeth, as they have
sufficiently manifested to the World; for they have out-stript many of the
Papists. And as for Damning and Damned Spirit, this is thy own Portion R. W.
and God's Elect thou can not charge (whom he justifies) nor Damn.

R. W. And thou say. If ever there were a Generation of such in the World,
the Papists and We are the Generations intended.

Answ. This is thine and your own Condition. For did we ever desire, that any
should be punished in matter of Conscionce, as thou do? although formerly thou
have writ largely against Persecution for Conscience Sake. Did we ever WHIP,
BANISH or HANG, or SPOIL the Goods of any for Religion, as your
New-England-Professors have done, unto which thou have joined thy self? And
thou say, It is in vain, to tell us of Christ the Foundation, and of
Building Hay, Wood and Stubble: That is thy own Condition, R. W. who hate the
Light, which comes from Christ, in which the Saints Build upon Christ the
Foundation, not Hay, Wood and Stubble.

R. W. If you come not roundly to the Pope etc. or to the Light within etc.
nothing remains but Fire and Brimstone and Damnation, etc.

Answ. Do thou call the Light of Christ within the Pope, or make as small a
matter thereof? And whom have we burnt with Fire and Brimstone? let all the
People witness against thy Blasphemous, Lying Spirit. And for thy Comparing us
with the Pope, they own the Light within no more than thou and the
New-England-Priests. And thou further say; Their Idol, called the Light
within: here we do Charge thee with Blasphemy, for calling the Light of Christ,
which shines in the Heart to give the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the
Face of Jesus Christ, an Idol.

R. W. And thou say; The Protestants overcome the Papists not only by
Scripture and Argument, but in Charity; for they have hope of many among the
Papists, as also among the Quakers. But the Papists and Quakers like Fireships
burn and blow up all, that bow not down to their Image.

Answ. Why how now Roger? What! have you overcome Papists and Quakers by
Scripture, Argument and Charity, and yet the Papists and Quakers blow up all,
that will not bow to this Image, the Light of Christ, as thou scornfully
call it, R. W? it is not the New-England-Protestants, that have this Charity.
But has the Light of Christ blown up R. W. and his New-England-Protestants,
and scorcht you so, that it makes thee and you thus rage and blaspheme against
the Light of Christ, and call it an Idol, beast like? But what Hopes have you
of Papists and Quakers, if they burn you, and blow you up, as thou say? but
thou wrongest the Papists; for they own not the Light of Christ within, as we
do: witness, they persecuted us both at Rome and Paris. But this know, this
Light, thou blasphemously call an Idol, will be thy Condemnation.

R. W. Then thou tellest us, The Quakers Spirit is far from the Spirit of
Christ Jesus -- and how the Poor Woman desired the Crumbs, p. 90.
as a Dog -- and how Christ Proclaims the Kingdom to the Poor in Spirit --
and his Blessedness to bleating Lambs and Newborn Babes -- and how Christ Bore
with his Disciples -- and their Ignorance of his Death and Resurrection.

Answ. What is all this to G. F's. Answer, let the Reader see; alleging
Christ's Promise, and his Kingdom proclaimed to the Poor etc. but if they hate
the Light of Christ, they neither receive the Kingdom nor Promise. Neither did
the Woman, nor Cornelius hate the Light of Christ: for if they had, they would
not have received him, nor have had Faith in him. And as for Christ's
Disciples, thou art short of them: and the Quakers are not far from the Spirit
of Christ, for they have it; or else they would be none of his, like thou. And
we have the Mind of Christ, 2 Cor. 2.

R. W. Thou bring John Brown ( G. F. Fol. 259.) saying, [ And them, that
bring People to look at the Light within them, are as Korah, Dathan and
Abiram.] G. F. Answ. [All that go from the Light within them, are as Korah,
Dathan and Abiram against the Lord's Prophets, Exalting themselves, and
Persecuting them.] R. W. replyeth, That this Famous History of Korah, Dathan
and Abiram's Revolt, may most properly be Applicable to the pretended Quakers,
and says; I know, G. F. charge this ( to wit, Korah, Dathan and Abiram) upon
all, that pretend to Spiritual Ministration, and have not the Immediate Spirit
of God, as the Apostles had -- The Protestant Religion is a Religion protesting
against the Bloody Man of Sin, the Pope.

Answ. This is not New-England's Protestant Religion; the Laws, their GALLOWS,
their WHIPS, their BANISHING, their SPOILING of Goods declare it to the World.
And thou and thy Ministers, that have not the Immediate Spirit of God and
Christ as the Apostles had, are in the Revolting Spirit of Korah: which is
truly applied to thee and thy Ministers (in Jude) and not to the Quakers. For
you, that have not the same Spirit and Power, as the Apostles had, are to be
turned away from; though you may have a Form, but denying the Power.

R. W. And thou say; The Quakers are Revolted from the Protestants Doctrine
and Worship, and sets up a Flag of Defiance against all, p. 91.
but pretended Immediately Inspired Persons, Invisible Worship and Ministers,
and a Sullen, Proud and Dogged Conversation.

Answ. The New-England's Bloody Doctrines, and Religion and Ministers, which
are not Inspired by the Spirit of God, and have not the Mind of Christ and his
Spirit, the Quakers are turned away from such, who are none of Christ's. And
though ye may Protest against the Bloody Whore, yet you wear her BLOODY
GARMENTS, and do her Work with your BLOODY HANDS. And as for Dogged, Sullen and
Froud Conversation, R. W. and the New-England-Professors might have kept at
home: for how often have your Dogs-Teeth been in the Flesh of the People of God
called Quakers, with your WHIPS, and HOT-IRON and CVTTING OFF OF EARS? And R.
W. now thou do show thy Teeth, who desire the Magistrates to punish us,
though it be for Conscience; and thou would not have this called Persecution:
no more would thy Brethren in New England, when they put God's People to Death.
And the Spirit of God, that inspired them, and makes us Ministers of the
Spirit, this we do set up, the same Spirit, that the Prophets and Apostles were
in. And thou, and the New England Priests and Professors, that Worship not God
in his Invisible Spirit and Truth, but scoff at it, ye are not in the same
Spirit and Power, the Apostles were in: and so, have not the Spirit of Christ.
So, out of thy own Mouth you are proved to be of Korah, Dathan and Abiram
against God's People, that are in the Spirit of Christ the Apostles were in,
and Truth, wherein they Worship God. So it is You, that are Revolted from the
Spirit of Christ and God's Worship, and Rebel against his Light, as Korah did
against his Law. And there is no such Word in G. F's* Answer, as Invisible
Persons, Invisible Ministers; they are of thy own shameless Forging.

R. W. Thou say; As to the Pretending Quakers, it is known, they are not
Sons of Obscurity, as Reeve and Muggleton: and then thou fallest a railing
against the Papists and Mahome^ans.

Answ. Let R. W. read his Book again and see, if his Brethren be not worse in
many things, and as bad as Mahomet and the Papists: and therefore why should
thou rail against your own Spirit, who manifest their Fruits. And the People of
God called Quakers are not the Sons of Obscurity, New-England-GOALS, and their
Persecution gives thee the Lie; though Christ said to his Disciples, the World
knew them not, as it did not know him: and therefore thy Charge is false
against the Quakers, as Korah's was against Moses.

R. W. says, The Quakers do advance their own People.

Answ. And what! p. 92.
does this torment R.W. and the New-England-People? must not we Love one
another, and Esteem one another? and Love Enemies, and Pray for Persecutors?

R. W. would have us to observe the Conspiracy of Korah etc. which was consumed
by Earth and Fire.

Answ. If R. W. had done this, and the New-England-Priests, he and they had
never Conspired against God's People; but let them take heed of the Judgments:
and is it not come upon some of them, since R. W. writ this Book? And let the
Reader see, if R. W. have touched upon G. F's. Answer, which says, They that
do not bring People to the Light of Christ within, are of Korah and Dathan etc.
and the Priest says; They that bring People to the Light of Christ within, are
as Korah, Dathan etc. And now, what must we observe from R. W's. and J. B's.
Doctrine? but that They, that turn People from the Light, are not Korah; and
they that Observe, Here R. W. etc. makes the Apostle Korah, who turned People
from Darkness to the Light, Act. 26, 18.
turn People from the Darkness to the Light, are Korah. So then, the Preachers
of Christ the Light within are Korah; and the Rebellers against the Light of
Christ within are not Korah: and they, that will not believe the Doctrine of R.
W. and the New-England-Priests, must be Korahs, Dathans etc. by them, and must
be Punished, Goods SPOILED, IMPRISONED, BANISHED, WHIPPED, BVRNT in the Hand, and
EARS CVT OFF etc. And are not ye herein worse than Korah? And a great deal more
Railing Language thou have here, not worth the taking notice of.

R. W. Brings George Johnson (from G. F's. Fol. 262.) saying; [ The Americans
were never ordained for Grace and Salvation; p. 93.
and the Grace of God never appeared to the Americans] G. F. Answ. [Which is
contrary to the Scripture, which says; The Grace of God, which brings
Salvation, has appeared unto ALL MEN etc. and, I will give him for a Light and
for a Covenant to the Gentiles, a New Covenant to the House of Israel and
Judah; and that he may be my Salvation to the Ends of the Earth. And many in
America have received Truth and Salvation.] R. W. replyeth; To the Covenant or
Bargain of Ged with Man, First and Secondly, I have spoken, [Thou say, Thou
have spoken; but thou have proved no where in the Scripture, where it is called
a Bargain] And also thou say, Thou have spoken to the Figurative Calling of
Christ to the Jews and Gentiles; and that this blind Soul taking it Literally,
he runs upon the Rocks of the Arminian General Redemption, and the
Universalists General Salvation, and that with a known Contradiction against
their own Foundation of none having any Benefit of Christ, that own not their
Light: as also with a known Contradiction to Experience, which says, The whole
World lies in Wickedness.

Answ. R. W. says, G. F. has contradicted themselves: I say, Nay. For R. W.
says, that G. F. is a blind Soul, and takes Christ the Covenant literally;
for he calls Christ the Covenant Figurative; but he has not proved it by
Scripture, neither told us, what Christ the Covenant Figureth forth? and then
in plain Words contradicts himself (in the same page) saying, Christ is the
Light, the Covenant etc. as the Sun in the Heavens to all the World. And G. F.
does not say, that any are saved; but who believe in the Light, as Christ
commands, and so have Faith in him: this is no Contradiction to Christ our
Foundation. And God says, I will give thee for a Covenant to the people (Esa.
42.) and what THEE is this, if it be not Christ? And, I will give thee for a
Covenant of the people to establish the Earth (Esa. 49.) and thou blasphemously
call this Covenant of Life (which lights every man, that comes into the
World) our New black Image of Light within. R. W. why do thou Blaspheme
against Christ and his Light, which shines in our hearts to give us the
Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus? where was ever any
of the Antichrists and false prophets, thy Forefathers so gross, as to call
the Light of Christ a black Image?

R. W. And thou call the Light of Christ Jesus within a false Light and
Spirit, p. 94.
which we would infect the Indians with.

Answ. What does R. W. and the New-England-Priests preach to the Indians, if it
be not Christ his Light and Spirit? and does the Light of Christ Poison and
Bewitch People with Hellish Sorceries? And what must we understand by R. W's.
Words, but that he draws them from the Light of Christ and his Spirit? but
the Apostle was sent to Open the Eyes of the Blind, turning them from the
Darkness to the Light. And do not they, that Draw People from the Spirit,
bewitch People? read Gal. 3.

R. W. says, What G. F. means by saying, Some in America have received Truth
and Salvation, I can but guess at; it is known, that he owns nothing of God in
the Indians or English, until they bow down to their Idol. --

Answ. Let the Reader see, and consider the Wickedness of this Man against the
Light of Christ and the Grace of God, which G. F. says, has appeared to all
Men, which brings Salvation! and are not the Indians Men? And God has given
Christ for a Covenant of Light to be his Salvation to the Ends of the Earth;
and this Covenant of Light and Grace he enviously calls our Idol, and says,
We own nothing of God in Indians or English. So, let the Reader read my Answer
to G. J. and judge: but such as hate the Light of Christ, which they should
believe in, and turn the Grace of God unto Wantonness, which should teach them,
and bring them Salvation, how should they be saved? Now by this the Reader may
see, what R. W. and the New-England-Priests have brought the Indians and the
People to? seeing, to turn People from Darkness to the Light of Christ, and to
Preach the Grace of God, by which the Saints were saved, Poysoneth and
Bewitcheth People with Hellish Sorcery: and to bow down to Christ the Light and
his Grace, is to bow down to an Idol: as you may see his Blasphemous Doctrine
in his Reply to G. F. And many more Malicious Words are here, which are not
worth the taking notice of.

R. W. Brings John Owen ( G. F. Fol. 263.) saying, [ All Truth concerning God
and our selves is to be learned from the Holy Scripture, the Word of God.] G.
F. Answ. [There was Truth learned, before the Scripture was Written; and the
Scriptures of Truth are the Words of God, which end in Christ the Word: and
there are no Truths learned, but as the Spirit does lead into all Truth. And
many have the Scriptures, but know not Christ and the Truth etc. so he has
thrown out Christ and the Spirit.] R. W. replyeth, and calls it a Childish
Answer, and says, There was Truth (and Spirit, and Christ and Light) before
Scripture. [So here R. W. and J. Owen are in Confusion; they Contradict one
another.] And further R. W. says, That the Scriptures, nor Preaching, nor
Baptism, nor the Supper, nor Afflictions avail, except the Spirit of God set
them home upon us: -- and many have the Scriptures, and yet know not Christ. --
So that this Answer is so Loose and Childish, that none but Fools and Children,
and Frantic Persons can find any Savor in it.

Answ. The Reader may see, how R. W. Contradicts himself. He says, The
Scripture does not avail, except the Spirit of God set it home upon us: and,
Many have the Scripture, and yet know not Christ: and yet, The Scripture is the
Sword, the Only Sword, and is counted the Sword, with which the Lord Jesus
vanquished the Devil; and the Touchstone and Judge, and Tryer of Spirits, and
the Ground of Christ's and the Saints Faith, says R. W. And thou say, This
Choice Sword may be put in a Mad-Man's Hand, whereby he may mischief, and wound
and kill himself and others, ( page 88, 89:) and ( page 94.) he says, The
Scriptures do not avail, except the Power of God set them home upon us; and
confesses, Many have the Scriptures, and not Christ. Now R. W. and ye
New-England-Priests, how can the Scripture, which will not avail without the
Spirit, in the Hand of the Wicked or Madmen, Wound, and Kill themselves and
others, and be the Only Sword and the Means to resist the Devil, and yet will
not avail? which Scriptures they may have, and not know Christ: is this your
Great Orator, that must steer the Church of New-England's Helm? see his
Contradictions. And as for Fools, Childishness, Poison, Frantickness, and no
Savor nor Taste in my Answers, this he might have kept at home with his
Contradictions, with his False Birth, he has struggled to bring forth.

R. W. For further Answer to this thou bidst, Read Owen's Writings, p. 95.
how he proves the Scriptures every Title of them to be the Word of God.

Answ. The People of God called Quakers never denied, the Scripture to be a
Declaration of the Will or Mind of God; and so R. W's. and Owen's Work is
Childish and Vain, to prove that against the Quakers, which they never denied,
but maintain. And Owen and R. W. how comes it to pass, that you have not
written against the English Schoolmaster (which does not tell us, that the
Scripture signifies the Word; but the Scripture signifies Writing) and put it
down, and called it in before now?

R. W. Thou bringst Samuel Palmer (from G. F's. Fol. 264.) saying, [ The State
of the Soul in this Life is threefold; Creation, Corruption and Regeneration..]
G. F. Answ. [In Regeneration the Life is changed from the Life which is in the
Fall. So Regeneration and Corruption is not one in the New Life.] R. W.
Replyeth and says, Regenerations and Corruptions are not one in the New Life.

Answ. But must they have this New Life, while they be upon the Earth, without
Corruptions? if so, then how have the Saints a Battle and a Warfare all their
days? (as in thy page 68.) is not this a Contradiction?

R. W. says, What a foul Trick is this of a False Man, to impute this to his
Opposite, which he abhors. I guess, or he means, that in Regeneration there
is a Perfection, and no Sin or Corruption left.

Answ. Do thou Abhor (and J. O.) a Sinless Regeneration without Corruption
and Sin? what Regeneration is that, that must have Sin, Corruption and
Imperfection, and what are People Regenerated from? and are not they
Regenerated and Born again, etc.

R. W. Thou say; Hence the poor Frantic Souls cry out, that the Protestants
plead for Sin Term of Life.

Answ. Do not thou make it good, and maintainest a Battle betwixt Flesh and
Spirit all the Days? (page 68.) and how therefore can thou call us Poor
Frantic Souls, for declaring that, which thou maintainest? And bring Paul
to prove it; when Paul tells thee, The Law of the Spirit of Life has made
him free from the Law of Sin and Death ( Romans 8.) and that he had Fought a good
Fight, and kept the Faith: then he was not FIGHTING, when he had FOVGHT; nor
Crying, nor Complaining, nor Wailing (as thou say from Romans 7.) And call
us Foolish, poor Souls, with Simple Answers; and this thou might have kept
at home, who do not understand Paul's Condition: for Paul was not all his
Days Complaining, Crying and Bewailing in that Condition; for he Preached the
Gospel, and bid others to rejoice, and rejoiced himself.

R. W. Thou say, The Devil deals with Us, as Pirates do with Ships; he makes
no Opposition against such he has taken, and is possessed of.

Answ. R. W. Thou and the New-England-Priests might have kept those Railing
Words at home, who do the Devil's Works, not Christ's nor God's. For thou and
they out of the Light of Christ and his Spirit would gather all to your selves;
but Christ is Risen, and is gathering People to God by his Light and Spirit,
that makes thee to rage, whose Ship is split in the Sea.

R. W. So that no question, but the Quakers may be freed from many
Transgressions and Temptations to them, which others are assaulted with.

Answ. But R. W. how can the Quakers be freed from many Transgressions and
Temptations to them, which others are assaulted with, when the Devil deals with
them, as the Pirate with Ships, and he has taken them, and does possess them,
and is possessed of? how can these be freed from Transgressions and Temptations?
do not thou herein Contradict thy self, R. W?

R. W. It is a great Mystery, which neither Jews, Turks, Atheists, p. 96.
Papists or Quakers know, how the Seed of all Grace may be in the Newborn, and
yet the Seed of all Sin.

Answ. This is R. W's. Mystery: but he has not proved it by Scripture, That
the Seed of all Sin is in the Newborn, and the Seed of all Grace; we charge R.
W. and all the New-England-Priests, to make this good by plain Text of
Scripture ( as in his 96 Page). And the Apostle says, If any Man be in Christ,
he is a New Creature: Old things are past away; behold, all is become New (2
Cor. 5): and the Apostle says, Put off the Old Man, which is Corrupt,
according to the deceitful Lusts; and put on the New Man, which after God is
created in Righteousness and true Holiness (Ephesians. 4.): Now, is it not
Blasphemy for R. W. to say, The Seeds of all Sin are in the Newborn, and the
Seeds of all Grace? so R. W. has masht all together. For there are Seeds of
Sin in the Old Man, which is to be Put off: for John says, (1 John 3.)
Whosoever is Born of God, does not commit Sin, for his Seed remains in him,
and he cannot Sin, because he is Born of God. And whosoever is Born of God,
overcomes the World: and this is the Victory, that overcomes the World, even
our Faith. Whosoever is Born of God, Sins not; but he that is begotten of
God, keeps himself, that the Wicked One touches him not. So the Seed of Sins
are not in the Newborn, but in the Old Born, the First Birth in the Flesh,
that persecuteth him, that is Born after the Spirit, like R. W.

R. W. Thou say; The Quakers Pride; they say: We are come to a more Perfect
and Pure Estate, than Paul at First was in, or John, who says, If we Confess
our Sin: and James, who says, In many things we offend all.

Answ. We do know the Apostles First Conversion, and Paul's Crying out of sin;
but that was not the Cry all their life time: If it had, Paul would not have
said, he had Victory and was made free, and had fought a good Fight: and John
would not have said, He that is born of God, overcomes the World: and such,
that had overcome the wicked One, and were strong, and the Word of God abode in
them (1 John 2). And it is true, In many things You offend all; and therefore
we keep to the One thing, Christ Jesus, in whom there is no sin. And John, who
says; If we confess our Sin, he is Faithful and Just to forgive us all our
sins, and cleanses us from ALL unrighteousness: Mark ALL; but this thou have
left out, for it makes against thee. And as for Pride, Ambition, Unbelief,
Unthankfulness, Intemperance, Covetousness, full of rash Anger, bitter
Railings, dreadful Blasphemies against Heaven, R. W. which thou speak of,
thou might have kept it at home, and the Whore wiping her Mouth, for thy
bottle is full of it, and the New England Priests whose fruits do declare it.

R. W. He brings Richard Mayo (G. F. Fol. 275) the Priest's sayings, that
says [ To say, the Gospel is the Power of God, is but a Metaphorical Speech:
and that the Gospel is no more the Power of God, then the Rose-Cake, that lay
in his Window. [But these blasphemous Words R. W. takes no Notice of, nor his
New England Priests, of Priest Mayo's Blasphemy.] G. F. Answ: [The Apostle does
not say so; for the Apostle says, The Gospel is the Power of God unto
Salvation to every one, that believes, in plain Words ( Romans 1.): but let the
Reader read and see in all his Reply, if ever he does confess and own, that the
Gospel is the Power of God to Salvation to every one that believes, as Paul
does ( Romans 1). And we do believe, that his dark Spirit will not suffer him;
though in Words he does confess, that the Gospel is Glad Tidings: but goes
about to prove, that to say, The Gospel is the power of God, is a Metaphorical
Speech; and makes a great Rambling about it over and over, but to no purpose.

R. W. And he says; The Gospel is Christ, it is the Spirit, it is the Light
and God himself etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any of those Words in G. F's answer? But
did not Christ dye for Sinners, and shed his blood for them, and is not this
Glad Tidings? and was it not to Paul? and is it not so to Sinners now?

R. W. And thou tellest, The Devil hates glad News of Christ etc. and tellest
of Kings Proclamations of Pardons or Liberty. p. 97.


Answ. All this does not disprove Paul's Words, the Gospel to be the Power of
God: and thou, that hate the light of Christ within, thou hate- Gospel, as
the Devil does. And we do own, the Gospel is the Glad Tidings preached by the
Apostles and Shepherds, and by us, God's people now, the same Gospel, as ever
it was; though thou and the New-England-priests persecute us for preaching it
freely unto you.

R. W. And thou say (page 96) That the Great Fox, the Devil, who thirst
after the blood of the Quakers -- and (page 95.) thou say; The Devil deals
with the Quakers as Pirates do with Ships; he makes no Opposition against such
he has taken and he possesses, and is possessed of.

Answ. R. W. Do not thou here contradict thy self? how does he thirst after
blood, when he has possessed them? as thou wicked-and lyingly say.

R. W. And thou say, If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
p. 98.
and bring'st 2 Cor. 4. In whom the God of this World has blinded their minds
-- and believe not etc.

Answ. If the outward Writings be the Gospel, not the Power of God, that Gospel
or Bible, which be Writings, are not hid. It is the Power: for Unbelievers have
the Scriptures or the Writings and Persecutors, that have the Form, and deny
the Power, the Gospel: and a Condemned Person may see an outward pardon. And
therefore the Gospel, it is the Power of God, which opens the blind Eyes,
which the God of this World has blinded: and so does not the Scripture, for
that is not hid. And the Light, that shines in the heart, gives the knowledge
of the Glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus, of his Gospel (2 Cor. 4.) And
a many Stories and Ill-favored language thou have in this Reply, not worthy to
be taken notice of; of the Devil and Atheist etc.

R. W. thou bring'st Daniel Gawdry (G. F. fol. 282.) saying [ The Saints were
come to the Spirits of Just Men made perfect, but not on Earth.] G P's Answ.
[The Just Men's Spirit, that led them to give forth the Scriptures, was the
Spirit of God, and that was Perfect (which perfected them) and was, while they
were upon the Earth, the Saints were come to, (which was Christ, the End of all
Words) and so to God, the Judge of all the World.] R. W. replyeth, [but let the
Reader see, what a lame and pitiful Reply it is.] He tells us of the Spirit's
being in Prison (1 Pet. 3.) He tells of Mary's Spirit rejoicing in God her
Savior, Opposite to the Spirits of the Wicked in the Old World ( that Peter
tells of) now in Prison.

Answ. Let the Reader see, if it be G. F's. Answer, that says, That Mary
Magdalen's Spirit, with which she praised God, was the same with them in the
Wicked World in the days of Noah? but Peter does not say, that these Wicked
Spirits in the Old World are in prison NOW; he has added this to Peter's words
(as you may see 1 Pet. 3.)

R. W. Thou say; The Spirit of God (Heb. 12) speaks not of the Bodies of
the Saints neither Con-joyned, nor a Part: nor 2dly, of the Righteous made
Perfect; but the Spirits of (First) the Righteous. Therefore it seems to hold
forth not a Perfect State of the Saints in this Life consisting of Spirit and
Body, which our Proud Boasters say of themselves etc. nor (Secondly) in the
Estate of the Saints in the World to come.

Answ. What is this to G. F's. Reply? and why does not he speak plainly,
Whether the Saints are come to Mount Zion, the City of the Living God, the
Heavenly Jerusalem, to an Innumerable Company of Angels, unto the Church of the
Firstborn in Heaven, unto God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Just Men
made Perfect? And can any come hither without the Spirit of God? seeing thou
say, That the Scripture speaks of the Spirit of God nothing at all, but of
the Spirits of Men? So, the Question lies here, Whether or no the Saints do
come, while they are upon the Earth, to the Just Men's Spirits made Perfect, and
to God the Judge of all, and to the Heavenly Jerusalem, the City of the Living
God? For the Apostle says, Ye are come hither, YE ARE COME; and the Apostle
and the Saints were alive upon the Earth, when he spoke this. And thou make a
jumble about the Saints Bodies, and say, We are proud Boasters: and we never
said of ourselves, that we were Perfect of our selves; but perfect by Christ,
who does perfect for ever by one Offering them that are Sanctified (Heb. 10,
14.) mark, them that are Sanctified. And we do own the States of the Saints in
this World, and the States in the World to come, Life Everlasting: and so we
can truly turn thy lies back again, seeing they are not ours. -- And the Spirit
in the Apostles encourages the Saints to Perfection: and the Apostle says, he
spoke Wisdom amongst them that are perfect (1 Cor. 2). And, Be ye Perfect, and
of good Comfort (2 Cor. 13). Let us, as many as be perfect (Phil. 3, 12); and (
Col 1) their work was, that they might present every man perfect in Christ
Jesus: so the Imperfection was in Old Adam. That ye may stand perfect and
complete (Col. 4): how should they stand perfect and complete, if they were not
in it? That the Man of God may be Perfect (2 Timothy 3): and Christ says, Be ye
Perfect, as your Heavenly Father, which is in Heaven, is Perfect: Christ says,
Every one that is Perfect, shall be as his Master (Luke 6). David says, Mark
the Perfect Man (Psalm. 37): and David says, Many shoot in Secret at them that
are Perfect: but if R. W. and the New-England-Priests say, There is none
disseit the Grave to be Perfect, then there is none to shoot at, nor to be
marked at. And Christ says, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is Perfect (
Matthew. 5): and Peter says, After you have suffered a while, make you Perfect:
Signifying, that it is Attainable, or else Peter would not have encouraged to
it. And God says, Job was a Perfect Man, and upright, and one that feared God:
and by one Offering has Perfected for ever them that are Sanctified, (Heb. 10,
14). And the Apostle says, An Inheritance amongst them that are Sanctified:
mark, that ARE SANCTIFIED; were not these upon the Earth? the Apostle says, He
that Sanctifies, and they that are Sanctified, are all of One (Heb. 2). And
the Apostle says, I beseech you Brethren, through the Mercies of God, that you
present your Bodies a Living Sacrifice, Holy, and acceptable to God, which is
your Reasonable Service (Romans 12): Now, must not the Saints (R. W.) present
their Bodies thus Holy and a Living Sacrifice to God, while they be upon the
Earth? and how can they present them to God, if they must not be Perfect, but
carry a body of Sin to the Grave? or must they present their Bodies, when they
are Dead? and does not Sin make their Bodies dead, while they be upon the
Earth, before they be dead outwardly? Now, if the Spirit of Christ, that raised
him from the Dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the Dead, shall
quicken your Mortal Bodies: and this we witness. ( Romans 8.)

R. W. Thou ask, What Truth is in these Words, Christ is the End of all
Words? p. 99.
and further thou say, The truth is, their horrible, unclean and foul Spirit
would fain be rid of all Scripture-words and Learning also, that he may bring
the more of miserable mankind ( under the Cheating sound of Light) into his
Eternal Darkness.

Answ. R. W. that is thy own Condition, with the Cheating sound of Light, and
these reviling Words of thine I abhor. And the Scripture Words we own, and all
true Learning of that which is Good, both Natural and Spiritual: but thou
would rid the Spirit and Light out of the Peoples Hearts (if thou could)
who hate, and grievest and vexest it in thy self; and so railest against
them, that walk in it. And I tell thee, Christ is the End of all these Words
that are spoken of him, and does fulfill them: and that is my Meaning, if thou will have a Meaning.

R. W. brings Timothy Travers ( G. F. Fol. 325.) saying, [ God has Ordained
to Eternal Life all that shall be saved, before they had a Being in the World:
but none comes to Possession of this Salvation, but through the Obedience of
the Spirit.] G. F. Answ. [The Ground of Man's Belief and Obedience is Christ,
who does Enlighten him to the Intent, that he might Believe and Obey the Truth.
And who knows the Seed. knows the Election, before the World was made.
etc.] R. W. replyeth, and says, If he means, that Christ is the Ground or
Author, the Giver of Repentance and Faith to all the Elect, whom God the Father
has given him, we say so.

Answ. You say so in Words, but not in the Faith and in the Repentance; if you
did, we should have Unity with you; for, who should be the Author of Faith, and
Caller and Giver of Repentance, but Christ Jesus?

R. W. Thou say; But if he put in their Invented Light in the Room of God's
Election and Predestination, as the Efficient and First Cause, p. 100.
and of Christ as the Mediator etc. he speaks Blasphemously of God and of his
Son etc. he is now in the Borough etc. who destroys God's Election, before the
World was, and says, That when a Man Believes, he is Elected, when he is
Predestinate etc. Contrary to all the Precious Beds of Flowers in the Garden of
the Scriptures, etc. Contrary to the Wit and Skill of Men, who frame a Book, or
a House, or a Ship etc.

Answ. Let the Reader see, how R. W. wrongeth G. F's Words, or if there be any
such Words in his Answer to T. T. the great Ranter? But what are all R. W's.
Words, which he has framed here, which are not G. F's? Can a Man know
Election, Ordination, Reprobation or Predestination, or Christ the Mediator
and Redeemer and Savior, without the Light of Christ Jesus? must not he first
be turned from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to Christ and
God, in whom the Election is before the World began? [In whom the Election is].
And does not Christ command to believe in the Light, and the Light gives him
the Knowledge etc is not this Blasphemy in thee R. W. to say, That I Invent the
Light of Christ, which lights every Man that comes into the World, which is
Life in the Word (Joh. 1)? and ( Romans 8. Ephesians. 1.) those Scriptures we own, as
they speak. And can God's Election be destroyed before the World began? thou
say, Who destroy God's Election, before the World began; I tell thee, that
neither thou, nor the Devil can destroy God's Election, before the World began:
it is like, Thy Election (which is Reprobation) may be destroyed; but God's
Election cannot be destroyed. Is not Christ called the Elect? and are not all
his Saints Elect in him, and dies no more? and they cannot pluck them out of
his Father's Hand? but thy Knowledge of this is like the Skill of Men framing
of Books, Houses and Ships, which thou call Vanity. -- And as for the
Scriptures, the Light of Christ is not Contrary to them, but owneth them, which
Light and Spirit we are in (blessed be the Lord for ever!) which leads into
all Truth of them.

R. W. Thou say; As to the Seed and Election we know, they make themselves
the Seed and Election. 2. They make Christ the Seed, that is, themselves. 3.
They make God, and the Spirit of God the Seed, the Seed in every Man, which
they Preach to; by them the Imprisoned Seed: and when one turns Quaker, then
God comes out of Prison etc. They make no Distinction between God, and Christ,
and Spirit, and Themselves, as Fox in his Book plainly tells us etc. God
himself is hearkened to; then the Soul so Hearkening becomes God, Deified with
God, and God with God etc. whose Infinite Being and Essence these poor Proud
Bruits have not so much Sight of, as the Devil.

Answ. These Words are R. William's own Blasphemous Words and Forgeries from
his Lying Imaginations: let the Reader see, if there be any such Words in all
G. F's. Book to T. T. the Great Ranter, which R. W. is joined withal against
us. But is not Christ called the Seed? and how the Promise was to the Seed? not
to the Seeds as many, but one? and to thy Seed, which is Christ? ( Gal. 3.) And
is not Christ called the Seeds-man, that sows his Seed upon all Grounds? and
are not these Grounds in the Heart of Man? and were not the Apostles Ministers,
Sowers to the Spirit? and was not the Spirit in Man, of which they reap Life
Eternal? but R. W. and his New-England-Priests, it seems, Sow to the Flesh in
Man, of which they may Reap a great Crop of Corruptions. And is not this Seed
Spiritual, that Christ Sows? but is not the Seed in the Prison in thee, or
under the Clods, which Christ sows, as scorch't or choked, that thou railest
so much at it, where it brings forth Fruits to God (who is a Spirit) in the
Good Ground?

And we do not make Our selves the Seeds-Man, God, and Christ and Spirit, as
thou belyest us; for we make a Distinction, the Lord knows: the Seed teaches
us to deny our selves, and to follow Christ the Seeds-man. And do not I make a
Distinction between God and Christ, when I say often, that God did not dye, but
Christ according to the Flesh? And never did we say, By Hearkening the Soul
became God, or God Deifyed, and God with God; for God, who breathed into Man
the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul, is not that part of his
Breath? And when thou have framed a Meaning of thy own Words, which are not of
ours, thou call it our Ignorance, and say, We are fallen, like the fallen
Spirits; and we have not so much Sight as the Devil: and yet ( page 74.) thou
say, That God has endowed me with Excellent Natural Parts, and many of us,
yea with the Light of the Holy Scripture, a Light of Experience and Common
Motions from God's Holy Spirit: so, R. W. see, how thou Confoundest thy self!
But blessed be the Lord, we are in Christ Jesus, who bruiseth the Devil, the
Serpent's Head, who is the Author of these Lies and Forgeries against us in
thee, and they touch us not. And we never said (as thou wickedly say), That
God was in Prison, or comes out of Prison; it is He and his Son, that puts
us out of Prison.

R. W. brings Tim. Trav. the Ranter's Words ( Fol. G. F. 326.) saying, p. 101.
[ The Manifestation of the Spirit is given to every Man in the Church to
profit withal; and not to every Every Man in the World.] G. F. Answ. [The
Manifestation is given to Every Man to profit withal WITHOUT DISTINCTION, the
Apostle says: I will pour out of my S^irit upon ALL FLESH, says the Lord, and
the Spirit of Truth shall lead the Saints into all Truth, and he shall Reprove
the World: and that which Reproves the World, is manifested to the World.] R.
W. replyeth, G. F. is like a Cow with a Kettle on her Head, giving every one
warning to stand clear; he boldly slanders on, and tumbles Heaven, Earth* and
Hell together.

Answ. Let the Reader see, what vain, wild, frothy Words this Old Doting Man
utters forth scornfully, and see if there be any such Words, as his are* in
G. F.'s. Answer? And we do charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests to make
this good by Scripture, and let us see, where it is written, that Heaven,
Earth, and Hell can be tumbled together, according to R. W.'s Doctrine, that he
has Published to the World in Print.

R. W. Thou bring 1 Cor. 12. and Rom: 12. Ephesians. 4. and tell, How God
bestowed Gifts and Endowments on such, whom he pleases, and how he gave his
Gifts and Ministrations to his Church etc. and then thou say; But this
Profane Mouth has something to say for it self: and then thou say; Was this
(as he speaks) without all Distinction done Actually? p. 102.
was it Universally so with all the Individual Men in the World etc? was not
there a wonderful Wall of Separation between Jews and all other Nations? etc.
And further thou say; Thou observest, how vainly this Deluded Soul cheats
himself and others with the Term of All Flesh, Every Man, All the World; and so
with the Term Light, Christ, Spirit etc. and thou ask, Whether all the
Believers had these Gifts, to wit, Prophecies and Fiery Tongues? belong they to
all the Men and Women in the World, who never saw nor heard of any Glimps of
the Sun of Righteousness? etc.

Answ. The Scriptures (1 Cor. 12. Romans 12. Ephesians. 4.) we own, and the Order and
Practice of the Gifted Men in the Church of God: but the Apostle he makes no
Distinction; he says in plain Words, The Manifestation of the Spirit of God is
given to Every M^n to profit withal (he does not say, Only to the Saints:) So
he makes no Distinction; not only the Saints, the Corinthians. And the
Separation betwixt Jews and Gentiles Christ has broken down, and of Twain
makes One New Man: and does not Christ Enlighten the Jews with his Divine,
Heavenly Light, which is the Life in the Word, as well as the Gentiles, and
says, Believe in the Light? they that Believe in the Light, are One in Christ;
and if not, with the Light they are Condemned? And we do not say, that All the
Churches had the Fiery Tongues etc. there is no such thing in my Answer to T.
T: and so, neither have all the Men and Women in the World these Gifts,
belonging to the Church; how should they, if they hate the Light of Christ's,
and quench and err from his Spirit, and resist the Holy Ghost?

But thou say; The Men and Women in the World have never seen or heard of
any Glimps of the Sun of Righteousness. What! have they never heard of Christ
the Sun of Righteousness? I believe, there is Millions of Men and Women in the
World, that will say, thou art a Liar. For, were not the Apostles to Preach the
Gospel Christ Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness, to all Nations? and does not the
Apostle say, The Gospel was preached to EVERY CREATVRE UNDER HEAVEN, whereof he
was made a Minister? ( Col. 1, 23.) and the Apostle says, Have they not all
heard? YES VERILY ( Romans 10): and the Profane Mouth thou speak with, is thy
own. If they hate the Light of Christ and quench his Spirit, that God has
poured upon them, and erred from his Spirit, then they are not like to See him
indeed; and will not Hear him in the Spirit, and his Light, they will not See
him nor Hear him, like the Pharisees and thou R. W.

And why do thou fret thy self about the Light, and the word ALL and EVERY
MAN? but thy Spirit is the Sect-maker, and would not have ALL nor EVERY MAN,
who art opposite to the Prophets and Apostles Doctrine. Peter says, It shall
come to pass in the last Days, says the Lord, I will pour out my Spirit upon
ALL FLESH (to wit, Sons, Daughters, Young Men, Old Men, Servants, Handmaids)
Joel 2. Act. 2: and John says, This is the true Light, which was Life in the
Word, which lights EVERY Man, that comes into the World. And Paul says to
Titus; The Grace of God, which brings Salvation, has appeared unto ALL MEN:
and Christ bid his Disciples, To go into All Nations to Preach the Gospel unto
Every Creature: and the Apostle says, That the Gospel was Preached unto Every
Creature under Heaven. But R. W. says, Men and Women in the World, who have
never seen or heard of any Glimps of the Sun of Righteousness: and yet thou
say ( page 28.) I find in all Mankind a Conviction, that God is JUST and
Powerful: and again; I find all Men confess, that the Will, or Word or Mind of
God is PVRE: I find, that First, There is Generally in all Mankind in the World
a Conviction of an Invisible, Omnipotent and Eternal Power and Godhead; and (
page 102.) Men and Women in the World have never seen or heard any Glimps of
the Sun of Righteousness, thou say: how now R. W. do not thou Contradict
thy self here? do thou Divide the Word here, as thou accusest me? is this
New-England's Great Orator? And so, as for Unclean Beast, and Proud Fancy, and
Vainly and Wickedly deluding, and Soul-Cheating thou might have kept this in
thy own Bottle.

R. W. Thou say; G. F's 2d. Answer here is, to wit, [The Spirit of God shall
lead the Saints into all Truth] and R. W. says; I observe here, how like a
Skittish Jade this Wild Soul runs in and out etc. before he brings in, the
Spirit of God poured out upon the Common World; and now he brings in, the
Spirit leading the Saints: the next word he concludes, is, Every Man in the
World to have the Spirit etc.

Answ. Do not thou confess, that the Holy Spirit testifies, that he is the
Comforter of the Saints, and is he not the Leader also? and do not thou
confess, that the Spirit is the Reprover of the World? (p. 102, 103.) then,
have not thou made thy self the Skittish Jade thou speak of, and Running in
and out? are not these Unsavory and Unseemly Words out of an Old Man's Mouth,
that professes Christianity? And if the Spirit of Truth does Reprove the
World, and God has poured his Spirit upon All Flesh; then, is not this the
Common World? and if it be upon All Flesh, is not Every Man come into the
World? else how will God Judge the World in Righteousness according to the
Gospel? Thou confessest, [ That the Holy Ghost is a Reprover of the World, and
that he Reproves the World in his Threatenings and Judgments;] and does not he
then Reprove the World for its Unrighteousness, Judgment and Unbelief also? and
if thou did not Resist it, it would Reprove thee for thy Unrighteousness,
False Judgment and Unbelief, as Christ says.

R. W. Do not thou say, The World mocks at this Holy Spirit, p. 103.
Banisheth, Imprisoneth and Murdereth such, in whom the true Spirit of God
appears. And further thou say; It is Lying Peor tells us, That all the
World (without Distinction) have the Manifestation of the Spirit of God to
profit withal. There have been Persons professing the Order of the Holy Ghost,
yet are far from the Savor of the Holy Spirit.

Answ. This is thy own Condition R. W. and thy own New-England-Professors, who
Resist it (as Stephen says Act. 7.) and Mock at it, and BANISH, IMPRISON and
MVRTHER such, in whom the Spirit of God appears: this has been the Practice
of the New-England-Priests and Professors to the Dishonor of Christianity. --
And does not the Apostle say; God will pour out his Spirit upon all Flesh
WITHOUT DISTINCTION, as Peter says? and is not this All the Men and Women of
the World? what Flesh dare say, but they have the Reproofs of God's Spirit,
when they do Ill? except it be such, as R. W. and R. W's. Professors, that
quench it, and have erred from it: so, thou may take thy Lying Peor to thy
self. And so, it is thou, that art resisting and fighting against the holy
Spirit of God. And can any profit in the things of God without the
Manifestation of the Holy Spirit, that is given to profit withal (and Peter and
Paul say) to All flesh, and to Every Man? so it is their Doctrine thou
oppossest, not with the Spirit, but with the dark fleshly mind. And thou
tellest a story of Babilonish Orders, and of Absalom; which if thou did see
that, thy own Condition in the Light of Christ thou hate, it would be better
for thee.

R. W. Thou say; Oh! what Reproofs of God's Spirit has G. F. and others of
their Leaders had in and by so many Excellent Opposites and Scriptures and
Arguments, which G. F. here trampleth under his Profane Feet, without any
Savor of the Spirit of God.

Answ. R. W. thou highly extollest the Ranters here, Tim. Trav. the great
Ranter, one of our Opposites: but thou have manifest thy Spirit, and what thou
take part with-al against the People of God. And we have a Savor of the Holy
Spirit of God, and in it can Savor our Opposites or Old Persecutors Spirits
not to be of Christ: and it has been the Evil Spirit, is in thee and them,
that has stroven against us. And we know, you may bring Scripture to a wrong
End, as the Devil did to Christ; and the Lord has given us Power over the
Devil's Spirit, blessed be his Name for ever! and he has blasted it, and
brought down, which was up in Oliver's Days, that Persecuting Spirit. And we do
own the Scriptures, let^it be out of whose Mouths it be: though we cannot own
their Meanings, nor have Unity with such, as hold up the Truth in
Unrighteousness. And as for Trampling, we trample nothing that is good, under
our Feet, that is thy own Condition: but we do own the Appearance of God in all
People -- But R. W. thou say; Without any Savor of the Spirit of God: and
yet thou say; I find in all Mankind a Conviction, that God is Just and
Powerful: and, I find Generally in all Mankind a Conviction of an Invisible,
Omnipotent and Eternal Power and Godhead; yet thou say, Without any Savor
of the Spirit of God: read ( page 28. 102.) thy Contradiction. -- And thou
say; It pleases God to strive with Men by Preaching: but not by such, as
thou and the New-England-Priests are, that stir up the Punishment, Persecution
and HANGING.

R. W. Thou ask, Why David complains (Psalm. 53.) that all the Children of
Men, not one excepted, are Unprofitable etc. are Abominable to Spiritual
Matters and Heavenly Things, p. 104.
(and further thou say) until the Spirit of God comes, and truly change the
Heart and whole Frame of Nature: until then we are as profitable as Hogs and
Moles in a Garden etc. and as devouring Foxes amongst the true Lambs and
Chickkins of Christ Jesus.

Answ. R. W. thou have writ thy Condition and the New-England-Priests there, to
wit, the Devouring Foxes (and Hogs) of the Lambs of Christ and his Chickkins.
For mark the Word, UNTIL the Spirit of God change their Hearts etc. and we
believe, your Hearts and Natures are not changed, but you are Unprofitable: for
how can it be, when thou say, There is no Voice nor Motion within in
Heavenly things in Matters of Supernatural Light to hearken to, to turn to, to
listen to? (p 83.) -- And was David's Complaint of the Children of Men
Unprofitable? -- And does not David bid, All that has Breath, praise the Lord?
and how can they Praise the Lord, if there be nothing of the Spirit of God in
them? And do not they quench that, which God has manifested in them, which God
has shown unto them, and which convinces them of an Invisible and Omnipotent
and Eternal Power and Godhead? so, is not this Conviction of the Spirit of God
in them? and will not the Lord pour out his Wrath upon all the Heathen, that
call not upon his Name? And now, is there not a further Manifestation in these
Last Days by Christ, who Enlightneth every Man, that comes into the World? and
the Grace of God, which brings Salvation, has appeared to All Men? and God
pours out his Spirit upon All Flesh? but from this Spirit, Grace and Light in
all Men thou art erred from, and can not endure to hear of it.

R. W. Brings Hugh Archbal ( G. F. Fol. 328.) saying, [ Christ does Enlighten
none, but those that do receive him.] G. F. Answ. [Contrary to John 3. which
speaks of them, that hate the Light, and are Enlightened, and will not come to
it, because the Light will Reprove them: so he, that hates the Light, is
Enlightened, and will not Receive Christ.] To which R. W. replyeth (and after
his wonted manner, p. 105.
with foul Expressions) and says; G. F. abuses 2 Cor. 4. and says: Joh. 1.
is not Enlightneth, but Lighted; and the word (...) may signify both, etc. They
which hate the Light, are Enlightened, no question, but with the General Offer
of Mercy, as of a Candle or Sun to the Eyes of a Blind Man, which is yet their
Condemnation etc. And before thou say, There is a Higher Light, which some
are affected, tinctured and Enlightened with, and yet not the True and Saving
Light; that in Heb. 6. where some Persons (as the pretended Quakers etc.) have
seen much of the Nature of God, of his Holiness and Justice etc. and had a Taste
of the Joys of the Next World.

Answ. If ENLIGHTENING and LIGHTED signify both, then do not oppose it. And here
thou confessest, They that hate the Light, are Enlightened, as well as the
Believers in the Light; it is the same Light: but thou say, It is a General
Offer, as a Candle or the Sun to the Eyes; That is an Outward Light, and a
Blind Man can neither see Candle nor Fire: and so that which he does not see,
is his Condemnation, according to thy Doctrine. But is this according to
Christ's Words? ( Joh. 3.) are his Words no more, than a General Offer, as a
Candle or the Sun to the Eyes of a Blind Man? for Christ says? One Hates the
Light, and the other Loves the Light, and brings the Deeds to the Light,
that they may see, they are wrought in God: so that is not Natural, which
gives the Knowledge of God, which shines in his Heart (as in 2 Cor. 4. which
I do not abuse; but it is thou, that abusest it). And Christ says, This is the
Condemnation, the Light is come in the World, and Men love Darkness rather than
the Light, because their Deeds be evil: here Christ gives the Reason; for the
Light discovers the Darkness, and their evil Deeds, or else how should they
know them. For Every one, that does evil, hates the Light (mark, Every one)
neither comes to the Light, least his deeds should be reproved: and so by the
Light he knows this Evil Deeds, and knows he does Evil, and knows he
hates it: and that is his Condemnation. And this is more, than a Candle or the
Sun to the Blind Man's Eyes, that cannot see it: and every one, that does the
Truth, comes to the Light; so it is the same Light, that he that does Evil,
hates, and he that does the Truth, loves: and this is the Light of Christ.
And how dare thou say, the Light was or is not Saving (Hebr. 6)? was not the
Holy Ghost Saving? and the Word of God Saving? or, is not the Word of God
Sufficient to reconcile to God? and the Holy Ghost Sufficient to lead into all
Truth? But thou say; In Hebr. 6. the higher Light, which enlightneth; and
yet not the True and Saving Light: we charge thee to make this good (and all
the New England priests) by the Scripture, That the Light (spoken of in Hebr.
6.) is not the True and Saving Light? it is like, thou never tryed'st it. But
thou art such as they, that are fallen away from the good Word of God; and
resist the Holy Ghost, and become a Hater of this Light; though thou have
tasted of the Gift: and Crucifiest the Son of God a fresh to thy self, as the
New-England-priests, and put him to open shame; and then HANG, punish and
persecute others, where he is manifest. I tell you, your Earth bears Thorns
and Briars: and read, what will be your End. ( Heb. 6.)

R. W. brings James Dorram, saying [ The Believer is not in Sin, p. 106.
as the Unbeliever is; he sins not, as the Unbeliever does.] And in another
place he says [ That the Law is the same to the Believers, that it is to the
Unbelievers.] G. F. answers ( Fol. 330.) [Here any may read thy Confusion:
but I say unto thee, He that believes, does not commit Sin; but Unbelief is
Sin ( Romans 12, 20). And Christ is the End of the Law to every one that
believes, for Righteousness sake ( Romans 10, 4): and yet thou put both
Believers and Unbelievers under the power of the Law.] R. W. replieth and
tells, How the Devil sins, and Saul and Judas, and Robbers, and
Murderers; (and says) It is not so with the Regenerate or Newborn.

Answ. who says, it is? But thou say, That the Seed of all Sin is in the
Newborn ( Append. page 96.) and here thou say, They can no more touch Sin,
( unless deceived or circumvented) then Fire can delight in Water, or Light in
Darkness. How is all their Seeds in the Newborn then, if it does not touch
them? for mark, thy words are, In the Newborn. For the Newborn are born of
the Spirit, are they not? Newborn Babes are born of the Immortal Seed of God:
how proves R. W. (with the New-England-priests) that all the Seeds of Sin are
in the Newborn, and yet it does not touch them, no more then Fire can delight
in Water?

R. W. And further thou say, That the Protestants have proved from the
Scripture and Experience of all true Saints, p. 107.
that Sin and Grace, the Flesh and Spirit, the Law of the Spirit and the Law of
Sin may and do continue in the Regenerate or Newborn; contrary to that proud
Perfection of Papists and Quakers in this Life, etc. And G. F.'s silly Shift,
saying, that Paul was perfect, and thanketh God for Victory, etc.

Answ. We never read in the Scripture of such a Doctrine, till R. W.
New-England's Orator, has published it, That Flesh and Spirit and the Law of
Sin should be in the New Birth in this Life. This is contrary to the Apostle;
for he says, With his mind he served the Law of God, but with the flesh, the
Law of sin; so, this was in the Flesh or Old Man Unmortified or put off: so
this Law of Sin and Flesh and Spirit was not in the Regenerate part or
New Birth (as Doting R. W. says) but in the contrary Birth, the Old Man. And
Paul did cry out, Wretched man, who shall deliver him: and he saw no Man, but
Christ Jesus; and thanketh God through him, who gave him the Victory: and was
not Paul Perfect, when he said; As many as are perfect, be thus minded? But why
cannot R. W. read as well Romans 8. as Romans 7. where the Apostle says; There is
no Condemnation to them, that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
Flesh, but after the Spirit: and the Law of the Spirit of Life makes him free
from the Law of Sin and Death: so the Apostle says, he was a free Man from the
Law of Sin and Death; but R. W. gives him the lie, and says, There is a
Combat with the Law of Sin in the Newborn in this Life. And, so as for
Silliness and Ignorance of the Saints Life R. W. and his New England professors
and priests may keep at home.

R. W. And thou say: They are to strive after Perfection and Holiness, etc.
as a Child going after his Father, the Scholar or Maidens following their
Copies and Samplers, though they never come near the full Exactness and
Perfection of them.

Answ. R. W. does confound Reason among men, and Short of the Truth. What!
shall the Scholar never learn his Lesson, nor the Maidens learn their Samplars,
to be as perfect as their Masters and Teachers? So, the Children shall never
come to an Exact Perfectness of Copies and Samplars, nor a Child never to come
to go, as his Father does? nor to be in the Strength and Knowledge of outward
things, as his Father? then what do all these learn their Copies and Samplars
for, if they never be to come near the full Exactness and Perfection of them?
But what shall we understand from R. W.'s Words and Doctrine in this? That
they, that learn of Christ, shall not be perfect, as their Heavenly Father is
Perfect, Should Christ Command that, which is Impossible to be attained to?
as Christ commands? and that the Saints shall not be sanctified throughout
Body, Soul and Spirit, whilst they be upon Earth? and, That Christ does not
sanctify his Church without Spot or Wrinkle and Blemish, or any such thing, and
present them to God, as on this side the Grave (as Ephesians. 5)? But what does R.
W. and the New England priests say to John (1 John 2); He that abides in
Christ, ought himself even also to walk, as Christ walked? and in another
place: So as he is, so are we in this present World? but let the Reader see,
what a silly Reply he has given to G. F. here; he speaks nothing of Romans 10.
and 11. to the contradicting of them, that which G. F. has asserted.

R. W. brings in (from G. F.'s fol. 338) John Nasmith (Priest from Scotland)
saying [ That the Evil Spirits are both Sinful and Reasonable] G. F. answers,
p. 108.
[This is a Lie: for Reasonable is not Sinful; Unreasonable is Sinful (1 Thessalonians.
3): They have not the Faith. And if the Evil Spirit be Reasonable, and the Good
Spirit, they are both One: who then is Unreasonable, if the Evil Spirit be
Reasonable? Thou put no Difference betwixt the precious and the vile: thou
have the Mark of a blind Guide, and of a false Prophet in thy Forehead.] R. W.
Replieth and begins with Railing, and says; First, The filthy, rash Fury of
his Mind and Pen -- and says, 2dly, This proud Pharisee will appear to be a
Sadducee also, and to bold no Angels nor Spirits. It Is true, they pretend to
own Scripture, Christ and Resurrection, they with the Jesuites-Equivocations
name Angels and Spirits; but the bottom (as some of them, and that in Print,
discover) is, They hold, there is but one Spirit, which is in all, into which
all return; and the Soul of Judas is as Happy, as the Soul of Peter.

Answ. Reader, this is nothing to G. F.'s Answer; neither has he, nor can he
make out any of these False Charges, which he has forged (which be not our
Words) against us: and therefore we can say, When he speaks a Lie, he
speaks of himself, and is the Father of it. For, where did ever any read in
any of our Books, or, is there any thing in G. F.'s Answer, that we hold, There
is but One Spirit in Man? R. W. and the New-England-Priests, have not we often
told you, that you have vexed, and grieved and quenched the Spirit of God? And
we never said, That Judas's Soul was as Happy, as Peter's; it was not like: for
Peter had fed the Lambs of Christ; and Judas betrayed him to the Chief Priests,
as thou art doing now in his Saints, who have Crucified him to thy self a
fresh. And Christ, and Scripture and Resurrection we own according to Scripture
Really, without any Pretense or Equivocation; that is thy own Condition. And R.
W. thou say, They hold neither Angel nor Spirit: then again thou say;
There is but One Spirit, and that in all: And all in one Sentence confoundest
thy self. And so, as for Silly, Rash Fury of Mind and Pen, thou might have
kept this at home.

R. W. Thou say; A Man is a Reasonable Creature, as opposite to a Woolf and
Fox etc. and yet he may be Unreasonable in his Actings, as a Woolf and Fox:
who, though Unreasonable in their Natures, are not Sinful, though a Plague to a
Man, since his Fall.

Answ. Let the Reader see, what a Silly Reply R. W. brings here to G. F.'s.
Answer to J. N. G. F. does not speak of Wolves and Foxes Unreasonableness; but
he speaks of Men, that have not Faith, are Unreasonable, and that have Faith,
are Reasonable: and the Priest J. N. maintains, that Evil Spirits are Sinful
and Reasonable; which R. W. says nothing unto, but tells us of Wolves and
Foxes, though Unreasonable, yet not Sinful, that have been a Plague to Man
since the Fall: and falls a Railing. And who knows not, that a Man is a
Reasonable Creature, and opposite to a Woolf and Fox? and his Actings
Unreasonable, like a Woolf or Fox, out of the Faith of Christ, as thou and the
New-England-Priests and Professors have done to the People of God, and Herod,
and the Chief-Priests against Christ and his Apostles.

R. W.) Oh! Happy were it for G. F. that he had been a Wild Fox in the Woods,
and had not been so Sinful, by so horribly abusing so great a Talent of Wit and
Reason, which the Father of Lights has given him! [and yet Knows no more,
than a Parret? p. 35.]

Answ. And why would R. W. have G. F. to have been a Wild Fox in the Woods?
because he would not follow his Imaginations, and such like in others, but
follows Christ Jesus? and he is his Prophet, his Bishop and Shepherd,
Counselor and High Priest. But R. W. thou say; G. F. has so great a Talent
of Wit and Reason, which the Father of Lights has given him: but it is thou,
that so Sinfully and Horribly abusest it, not he. And then thou Contradictest
thy self, and say ( page 87.) They cry out Light, Light, and there is none (
as Isaiah speaks) not a Spark of Light within them: and here thou abusest
Isaiah; for Isaiah does not speak so ( Isa. 8.) as let all read. And thou
may see in the Margin, There is no Morning in them: and there are many Stars
Outwardly, before people comes to the Morning; and is it not so Inwardly, as
it is Outwardly? But do not thou deny the Prophecy of Isaiah of Christ, who
says, I give him for a Covenant of Light to enlighten the Gentiles? I must
tell thee, we Gentiles have received this Light according to John's Witness,
who Enlightneth every man, that comes into the World, Christ Jesus. And page
100. R. W. says, These poor proud Bruits have not so much sight of, as the
Devil, (to wit, of God): and page 108, So great a Talent of Wit and Reason,
which the Father of Lights has given him, etc. so here R. W. New-England's
Mouth and Orator may see, how he contradicts himself.

R. W. says, We know the Nature of the Devils, Admirable Wit and Reason, as
well as the Power of those Unclean Spirits the Lord Jesus Christ cast out, they
did believe and confess the Lord Jesus Christ etc. and, This their Knowledge
and Ability is from God; though their Sinful Hardness by God's Just Sentence
runs them upon such mad and desperate Courses: as it is with the Sons of Men,
when the most holy Judge deliveres them up to the Counsels and Projects of
their Proud and Deceitful hearts and Spirits.

Answ. R. W. thou have spoken thy own Belief, and the Belief of New-England's
priests and professors; and the Practice of your proud, deceitful hearts and
Spirits has manifested themselves. But R. W. is the Unclean Spirits, their Wit
and Reason so Admirable with thee? and thou say, Their Knowledge and Ability
is from God: but where did ever Christ and the Apostle say so? For Christ (will thou give him the Lie?) he says, He was a Murderer from the beginning, and he
abode not in the Truth, because there is no Truth in him; and when he speaks
a Lie, he speaks it of his own ( mark, not from God) for he is a Liar, and
the Father of it, (Joh. 8, 44.) Now, I query from R. W. and the New England
Priests, Note: Is not this a Ranters Principle of R. Was?
What Knowledge and Ability has the Devil from God, and what Admirable Wit and
Reason, seeing Christ says, There is no Truth in him? and what Wit and Reason
can a Murderer have, which Christ calls a Murderer from the Beginning? And he
that is called a Murderer from the Beginning, thou allowest Admirable Wit and
Reason, and say, you know it: and say; that their Knowledge and Ability
is from God: If from God, it must be Truth; and Christ tells thee, There is
no Truth in him. And it is like, R. W. and the New-England-priests have more
Knowledge and Acquaintance with the Devil and Unclean Spirits, than with God
and Christ Jesus, and your Belief and Confession is like theirs. And though the
Devil did Confess the Son of God, yet this was not Truth in the Devil; but in
the Son of God; for in the Devil is no Truth: and if there be no Truth, there
can be no true Reason; and Reason does not run into mad and desperate Courses,
as thou say, the Evil Spirits run into. And have the Saints their Knowledge
and Abilities from God; and the Devils their Knowledge and Abilities from God
too? but is not the Devil's Knowledge and Ability, Wit and Reason, SIN and
EVIL, seeing Christ says, There is no Truth in him? then how is the Truth in
his Knowledge and Abilities, Admirable Wit and Reason? seeing, when he speaks
a Lie, he speaks of his own; for he is a Liar, and the Father of it: so his
Abilities, nor Wit nor Reason is not from God. And he abode not in the Truth,
because there is no Truth in him: then what can all his Abilities and
Knowledge, Admirable Wit and Reason be? And Christ destroys the Devil and his
Works: what! does Christ destroy Admirable Wit and Reason, and the Knowledge
and Ability, that is from God? no surely, that was out of the Truth, in whom
there was no Truth, whom Christ the Truth destroys, the Liar, the Murderer,
who abode not in the Truth.

R. W. Brings Henry Foreside, a Scotch Priest ( G. F. Fol. 345.) saying,
[Concerning those Words of Ezekiel. 18, 28. If the Righteous Man turn away from
his Righteousness, p. 109.
his Former Righteousness shall be no more remembered: and he said, The Meaning
of that Scripture was, They thought, they had been Righteous, and were not; but
supposed, they had been so.] G. F. Answ. [Here-in thou art a Minister of
Unrighteousness, and thou go about to make God a Liar, and the Prophets, and
pervertest the Scripture. For, if he forsake his Righteousness, and commit Sin
and Iniquity, and trespass, he shall die, and not live in the Righteousness;
but if he forsake his Sins, Trespasses and Transgressions, in the
Righteousness, that he has done and does, he shall live: (and so God's Ways
are Equal, Ezekiel. 18.) And thou say; They thought, they had been Righteous;
but it was not so. And the Lord by his Prophets said, It was so, that he should
live in the Righteousness; and die, if he departed from it, and transgressed:
here thou art a Diminisher from the Prophets and Apostles Words, whose Name is
to be diminished out of the Book of Life, Rev. 22, 19.] -- R. W. replyeth, and
says; The Question is about Falling away from Saving Grace and Righteousness:
wherein it is notorious, that the Quakers etc. And then thou go on, and
tellest of a Story of the Papists, Pope and Arminians, [which thou had better
kept at home, or gone and told them to their Faces.] And further thou say;
That the Quakers maintain, that the least, that hearken to the Light, are Born
again: they that are Born again, cannot sin; and that they which cannot sin,
are Pure, as God is Pure. And therefore they Falling away from them, they must
necessarily hold that which is Blasphemous, and that God himself may fall from
Grace etc. being kept down, as a Cart laden with Sheaves (perverting
Scriptures) by Wickedness and wicked Spirits, which are too hard for God, and
Christ and Spirit in all the Men and Women in the World, that do not hearken to
their Feigned Light. etc.

Answ. Here are a many Horrid Lies of R. W.'s that he has invented and forged:
and let the Reader see, if there be any such Words in G. F.'s Answer, or any of
their Books; and does not say, as thou say God can fall from Grace (who is
the GOD OF ALL GRACE): which is thy own Blasphemy, and Evil Consequence, not
ours: but as the Apostle says, The Grace of God has appeared unto all Men.
And they, that walk despitefully to the Spirit of Grace, and turn it to
Wantonness, do not they fall from it? (as in Jude:) and we charge thee, to make
it good by Scripture, for there is no such thing in G. F's. Answer. And we do
not pervert the Scriptures: and it is wickedness in thee to say, The wicked
Spirits are too hard for Christ, his Spirit and Light in Men and Women; etc.
but, as the Scripture says, such as thou do quench the Spirit, and vex and
grieve it, and may imprison Christ in his members, who Crucify him a fresh to
your selves. And as for thy Scoffing Words, Hearkening to their feigned Light,
and let loose the imprisoned God and Christ, These are thy own Blasphemous
words, not ours: for let the Reader see, is there any such Expression, as a God
in Prison, in G. F^'s words, or the Scripture either? though the Lord by his
Prophet speaks, how he was laden, like a Cart with Sheaves. And do not thou
Scoff and Mock at such, as hearken to the Light of Christ, who is the Light of
the World, and enlightneth every one, that comes into the World? I tell thee,
this Light will be thy Condemnation. And the Light, and the Spirit and Holy
Ghost, which thou art erred from and resists, the Evil Spirits are not too hard
for it; but it will be too hard for thee and them in the End, thou shall know
it, when thou and they are Judged and Condemned by the Spirit and Light.

And do not thou give the Prophet Ezekiel the Lie? did not they fall from
Righteousness (in Ezekiel) that forsook it, and committed Iniquity? did not
they dye, and not live? and do thou tell God and his Prophet, It is
notorious, that they fell from Righteousness? and do thou tell the Apostle,
It was notorious, they fell from Saving Grace, who turned it into wantonness,
and walked despitefully against the Spirit of Grace? And does not Christ say,
He that believes in the Light, becomes a Child of Light? and John says; He
that believes, is born of God: and whosoever is born of God, does not commit
Sin; for his seed remains in him, and he cannot Sin, because he is born of
God: in this the Children of God are manifest, and the Children of the Devil:
Is not this Scripture (1 John 3.)? And, He that is born of God, overcomes the
World: so, does not he overcome the Sin, (1 John 5.)? and he that does
Righteousness, is not he Righteous, as he is Righteous? and he that commits
Sin, is of the Devil: let no man deceive you. (1 John 3, 7.) And does not
Christ say; Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect? And what! must
all these Scriptures be denied, and say, They are not Attainable in this life?

R. W. Thou tell of the Imputed Righteousness of God in Christ (Ezekiel. 18.),
p. 110.
Of the Sanctifying Righteousness in Christ, and of an Indians Righteousness,
and of ^ Civil Righteousness, and of a Pharisaical Righteousness, etc.

Answ. What is all this to the purpose? for the Righteousness, that Ezekiel
spoke of; was the Righteousness of the Law, which they were to do, and live-in
in their time: and where does the New Testament speak of Two Righteousnesses,
of Christ and the Foolish Virgins? make this good by Scripture R. W. And
Christ's Righteousness does exceed the Scribes and Pharisees Righteousness, or
the Indians either, that may free them from Outward Crimes: and for the Foolish
Virgins Righteousness, who make a fair Show of the Building upon the Rock
without Light, thou might have kept at home.

R. W. And thou say, Adam shall live, if he keep his Bargain: so shall all
his Posterity, if they keep the first Covenant.

Answ. Did not God give Adam Power and Dominion over all that he made? and when
he bad him to subdue the Earth, did not he give him power to subdue it? and
charged him, that he should not Eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
Evil? And did not God pour out his Spirit upon the House of Israel, to whom he
gave his Statutes, and commands and bid them to live in them? and were not
God's ways Equal? and when they Erred from the Spirit, and Rebelled against it,
did not they cast the Law of God behind their backs, and forsook the Lord? And
did not the Apostle say, I through the Law am dead to the Law? and the
Righteousness of the Law was fulfilled in him; and he did not make the Law of
none Effect? but where does the Scripture call the Law of God or his Command a
Bargain? Now, do not you Christians cast the Law of Life, which is in Christ
Jesus, which makes free from the Law of Sin, behind your backs, saying; None
can be made free, while they live upon the Earth?

R.W. Thou fall'st a railing, and say: Does this Face of Brass, who has so
horribly slighted the Scriptures, now adore them? p. 111.
is he so zealous for them, and against the Violation of them? etc. Does he not
throughout all his Book, and all of them in Word and Writing deny the
Scriptures to be the Word of God? and only that Frantic Light of Christ
(imagined by them to be in all Mankind) to be the only Word of God? yea, is it
of any use or more Value to them, that have the Scriptures in their hearts, as
they say, then a Dead Letter, and an Old Almanac? etc. and thou say, They
undermine the Scriptures.

Answ. As for Face of Brass, R. W. might have kept for himself his Face of
Brass and Frantic Spirit he speaks of: we do not in no place in any of our
Books or Writings (as the Reader may see) deny, undermine or slight the
Scriptures; but do esteem them with the Spirit, that led the Holy Men, that
gave them forth, who learned them of God. And they are called the Words of God;
and Christ is the Word of God, who lights every man, that comes into the
World, with the Light, which is the Life in the Word. And this we must own, if
we own God, and Christ and the Scriptures; and are not a shamed of it before
men, to wit, of- Christ the Light, which lights every man, that comes into
the World: which thou call Blasphemously that Frantic Light or Christ; but
Roger, it will be thy Condemnation. -- And we never compared the Scriptures
with an Old Almanac, or esteemed them so, in that thou belyest us; and we
cannot give the Titles to Scriptures, which are belonging to God and Christ:
for the Word became Flesh; and so, not the Scriptures. And Christ does not say,
that the Life is in the Letter; but in him: and they testify of him, who is the
Life. But R. W. is the Life in the Letter, and is the Letter Living? seeing
thou say, The Scripture avails nothing, except the Spirit of God set them
home upon us (page 94)? and do thou not say then, The Word is good for
nothing (as thou call the Scripture) without Life? and what sense is this
R.W? And can any people know the Scriptures, except by the Spirit of God, which
leads into all Truth of them? which we say in Truth and Sincerity (as Christ
and his Prophets call them) to be the Words of God; and thou that say
otherwise, do not thou Add to the Scriptures? and read thy Portion, Revelat.
the last. And when thou have forged many Words of thy own, then thou make a
Reply to them, and fall'st a railing at them, and do not reply, to G. F's
Words: and the Reader may see, there is none of these bad Words in G. F's
answer, as thou here falsely assertest.

R. W. quoteth a Book from Holland ( G. F.'s fol. 356*) saying, p. 112.
That [God has put out the Remembrance of your sins, and the Corruptions
within you, wherein you must fight all your life time.] G. F. Answ. [Whilst the
Sins you are fighting with-al, are not blotted out in your own Particulars,
this is not the Life of the Saints, that are not fighting all their Lifetime,
but come to the Kingdom of God, witnessing Sin and Iniquity blotted out; and
the Everlasting Covenant of Peace and Life with God.] R. W. replyeth, and
falls a railing with many Unsavory Words, and says: He shows no Knowledge
of the Hebrew and Greek, ( whence our English Scriptures come from them, as a
Daughter from the Mother) and falls short of many English Writers, who scorn to
disgrace their Mother English ( by so much Bastard and False English) etc.

Answ. Here R. W. would seem to be some Body in his Hebrew, Greek and Latin;
and let the Reader see, if he has not Condemned himself in Judging G. F?
though some Words may have been mist in the Printing or in Paging, as many have
in his; but he has not shown, which is the False English in this Place.

R. W. says further; If ever any poor empty Soul have talked of God without
God, and the Holy Spirit within, without them, or any true Savor of them, and
of the Holy Writings, etc. without them, or any true Reverence of them, and
Love to them; of Light, without any Spark of true Illumination, etc.

Answ. How angry and furious is R. W. here! this is thy own Talk, R. W. and not
G. F's. And Poor Empty Soul thou might have kept at home: for can any Talk of
the Holy Spirit within, and have not a Savor or Sense (if it be truly there)
within, which we witness? and we do Reverence the Scriptures, and God and
Christ with his Holy Ghost, by which the Holy Men of God did speak them forth.
But how now R. W.! do I Talk of the Light without any Spark of true
Illumination? and yet so great a Talent of Wit and Reason, which the Father of
Lights has given me? what! have thou forgotten this? (in thy App. p. 108.)

R. W. Thou say; That no Sin is blotted ou^, until there be no more Root or
Seed of it in the Soul to Fight against: [and these are thy own Words (of which
thou make a large Reply) and not mine: for my Words are; The Saints are not
Fighting all their Lifetime.] And thou bring Paul and the Galatians to
Combat with Flesh and Spirit* (Gal. 5.) and, p. 113.
Paul did not the things, that he would, etc. and Ephesians. 6, and Luke 21, and 2
Cor. 7. etc. and Christ speaking to the Churches to Watch, to Overcome, to
Repent, etc.

Answ. What is all this to the purpose, to prove, That the Saints were Fighting
all their Lifetime, and had a Combat all their Lifetime? all these
Scriptures do not prove it, nor Paul's Warfare. For Paul (as I said before to
thee) said, He had FOVGHT the good Fight, and he was made free by the Law of
the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus from the Law of Sin and Death: though the
Apostles and the Saints went through many Conditions, before they came to this.
And the Prayer of Christ, to Pray against Temptations etc. so, it is not a Sin,
to be tempted; but a Sin to Enter into Temptation, is owned. And Christ's
Prayer, Forgive us, as we forgive others, etc. if New-England-Priests and
Professors had minded the Practice of this Prayer, they had not CVT OFF THE
EARS, nor WHIPPED or BANISHED, SPOILED Goods and HANGED God's People. And does not
the Lord say, I will blot out your Sins, and your Sins and Iniquities I will
remember no more? and must not the Saints witness this upon the Earth in Growth
in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the
New Covenant of Light?

R. W. says; If all, that are in their Fancied Kingdom, are freed from Sin,
and come to Peace and Joy, why then do they themselves still confess to be
subject to Quaking and Trembling, as if they were at the Foot of Mount Sinai?
which indeed they are --. And then thou tellst of a False Peace, Joy, False
Repentance, Mortification, Sanctification and Salvation etc.

Answ. R. W. that is thy own, and Priests and Professors in New England
Condition, and not ours. And to Mount Sinai, the Receiving of the Law, you
never came; though ye may boast of Mount Zion. And G. F's. Words, The Saints
are come to the Kingdom of God, and witness Sin and Iniquity blotted out, and
Everlasting Covenant and Peace and Life with the God of the Life; and thou
Blasphemously call it our Fancied Kingdom. But R. W. does any Sin or unclean
thing enter the Kingdom of God? and did not Christ and the Apostles Preach the
Kingdom of God, and said, No Unrighteousness should inherit the Kingdom of God?
Be not deceived, etc. and (1 Cor. 6, 9.) Envyings, Murders, Drunkenness,
Revilings and such like, they which do such things, shall not inherit the
Kingdom of God ( Gal. 5): and does not John say, He was in the Kingdom and
Patience of Jesus? ( Rev. 1, 9.) And was Paul come no further, then to Mount
Sinai, when he Trembled among the Corinthians? and R. W. thou art as Ignorant
of our Condition, as thou art of his. Is there no Fear and Trembling at the
Word of God, but at the Foot of Mount Sinai? and was not this among the Jews,
after they came into Canaan? and was Paul at Mount Sinai, when he Came to the
Corinthians in much Fear and Trembling? Well! we do hear him, whose Voice
shakes the Earth; and not the Earth only, but the Heavens also, that that,
which can be Shaken, may be Removed; and that which cannot be Shaken, may
Remain: and that is appeared, Glory to God for ever! which this Condition, I
see, neither R. W. neither Priests in New England have gone through.

R. W. Thou bringst Robert Tuchin (from G. F.'s Fol. 365.) his Saying, [ The
Most-Faithful Messengers of Christ have acknowledged, p. 114.
that they came short of their Duty.] G. F.'s Answ. [They that are Faithful
Messengers of Christ, have their Answer; Well done, Good and Faithful Servant.
Where did Paul, John and Peter acknowledge, they came Short of their Duty? have
not thou slandered the Servants of the Lord, thinking them to be like your
selves? and falsely accusest them, that Ye may seem Justified; who are False
Messengers, and come in his Name, when you have no Commission from him: and you
come short of every good Work* But it is not so with Christ's true Messengers;
for they Fulfill his Will, that sent them: it is the Lord, that works in them,
whose they are, whose Duty they perform by his Spirit.] R. W. replyeth, and
begins with Railing and says; The Heavens were not Pure in his Sight (to
wit, God) and he laid Folly to the Charge of his Angels, etc.

Answ. This Eliphas, the Temanite speak against Job, as R. W. does against us,
( Job 4.) when he Contended against Job, and Reproved him; of whom God said, He
was a Perfect man: so this is thy Ignorance. As for my Endowments, and our
Endowments, they are from the Lord: and I do grant, That Adam and Eve was
Perfect, and yet they Fell; and (thou say R. W.) We all by them are Fallen
Short of the Glory and Love of God, into the Dunghill of Hellish Darkness. THERE
YOU ARE, this is true R. W. in that which cannot Comprehend the Light of
Christ, which he Enlightneth every Man, that comes into the World, withal; but
call it an Idol: which Shines in your Darkness, and your Darkness
comprehends it not. And thou bringst David's Sayings, ( Psalm. 143: and Psalm.
19.) Enter not into Judgment, p. 115.
nor reckon with thy Servant, etc. Cleanse me from my Secret Sins, etc. but
what is David's Adultery and Murder, that the Most-Faithful Messengers of
Christ come short of their Duty? for thou must bring a Text of Scripture, where
they said, They acknowledged, they came short of their Duty? let us have
Chapter and Verse for this, then thou have said something. And then thou
speak of Abraham and Isaac: -- But where is the Charge of Abraham, that he
said, he came short of his Duty? or Enoch? or Abel? but as it is said, The
Righteous may fall, but rise again; but the Wicked shall fall into Mischief.
And does John cry out (1 John 2.) that he acknowledges, that he came short of
his Duty? there is no such saying there; and thou wrong'st John: but he writes
to the Young Men, because ye are strong, and the Word of God abides in you,
and ye have OVERCOME the Wicked One. And John says, If we confess our Sins, he
is Faithful and Just to forgive us our Sins, and to CLEANSE US FROM ALL
VNRIGHTEOVSNESS (1 John 1.): and further says, If we walk in the Light, as he
is in the Light, we have fellowship one with another* and the Blood of Christ
CLEANSES US FROM ALL SIN.

R. W. And thou say, Paul confessed and bewailed his Coming short; The Good,
that he would do, he did not; etc. With his Flesh he served the Law of Sin: and
though it was not Paul, that sinned, but Sin, that dwelt in him; and thou more
then fear, this Mystery is hidden from the poor Quakers.

Answ. But R. W. thou said now, It was not Paul, that sinned, but Sin, that
dwelt in him: and thou said (page 96.) of another Great Mystery, How the
Seeds of all Sin dwelt in the Newborn: and yet, It was not Paul that sinned,
thou say; for Paul says, It is not I: but he speaks of the Two I's, and
the Two ME's; which thou say the Seeds of all Sin is the [^], and in the ME,
that serves the Law of God. But Paul, Peter, and John were not always in that
Condition, Peter of denying his Master, and Paul crying out of Sin, and the Law
of Sin, and coming short of their Duty, thou call: for Peter Exhorted to
Perfection; and Paul said, he was made free, with the Law of the Spirit of Life
in Christ Jesus (as I often said before): and he had fought a good Fight, and
kept Faith; and there was a Crown laid up for him. And John said; As he is, so
are we in this present World: and he was in the Kingdom: and Paul said, The
Life that I now live, is by the Faith of the Son of God: and I live, yet not I,
but Christ lives in me, etc. Therefore, how did the Most-faithful Messengers
of Christ acknowledge, they came short of their Duty, etc. in the New Covenant
to the End? did they fall like Adam and Eve? and we have had full Experience of
the Saints Trials, Sufferings and Temptations both within and without. And G.
F. does not say, That the Servants of God never failed in Word or in Thought:
there is no such thing in G. F.'s Answer; and therefore thou might have
spared those Words: but there is no Comparison to be made with the Faithful
Messengers of Christ ( G. F. says) and your Pretended Messengers, that never
heard his Voice; and so have no Commission from him. And I must tell thee R. W.
and you New-England-Priests, that deny Christ the Light, with which he
Englightneth every Man, that comes into the World, which is the Life in the
Word, and call it a Frantic Light and an Idol; thou and they deny Christ
that bought you, Worse than Peter, that Deny the Light, which he Commands to
believe in. And so you are Come Short of every Good Work, but not of the Evil,
who would parallel your selves with the Faithful Messengers of Christ, and
finding Fault with them, ye do not see your own selves: for the Faithful had
Victory.

R. W. He brings Thomas Hodges ( G.F. Fol 372.) saying; [ The Scripture
speaks of God after the Manner of Men.] G. F. Ans. [ The Scripture speaks
of God after the Manner of the Spirit, p. 116.
and to the Spirit, whereby Men may receive him, and know him by the Spirit;
which Natural Man cannot.] R. W. replyeth, and begins with Railing Language
(as he uses to do) and says; Here he denies the Heavenly Mystery of God
revealing himself to us after the Manner of Men, having Head, Eyes and Mouth,
etc.

Answ. His Heavenly Mysteries God Reveals by his Spirit, does he not? does
not the Apostle say, The Mysteries and Things of God are Revealed by the
Spirit? and R. W. can the Things and Heavenly Mysteries of God be Revealed, but
by his Spirit to Men? And if God be likened to a Husbandman, a Shield, a Rock;
etc. he is not these Outwardly: for when God Revealed himself to Abraham, and
them he spoke those things to, he Revealed them to them by his Spirit, by which
they understood them; and by the same Spirit he Reveals them now.

R. W. Thou tell us of a Late Speech of one of the best Philosophers, and of
the best Christians, that Old or New England ever had, (viz.) Then shall we
know, (to wit, in the Next Life, in Heaven, in the Heavenly State to come) how
to answer that Great Question, What is God? but this Poor Wild-Asses-Colt G. F.
he can resolve that Question etc. and so go on Scoffing.

Answ The Apostle says, He that comes to God, must believe, that he is, and
that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him (Hebr. 11.): and did not
the Saints know, what God is, while they were upon Earth? and must this be
laughed at by you Philolosophers? and is this the best Christian both of Old
and New England, that says, We must know, what God is, in the heavenly State
to come? and what, not in this Life? then how will they know him to be a
Rewarder of them, that diligently seek him, if they do not know, what God is,
in this Life? how can they know, how to Worship God in Spirit and in Truth, if
they do not know him to be the Spirit, in this Life? and what must we Infer
from R. W's. Words, his best Philosophers, and best Christians? That we must
not know, what God is, in this Life? Then you may know, what the Devil is, and
not, what God is, in this Life, and the Great Reason and Abilities he has, as
R. W. says, And do not the Scriptures say, God will dwell in the Saints, and
walk in them? (see Corinth.) and they were to glorify God in their Spirits and
in their Bodies, which were God's? And is not he called a God of Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob? and God said unto him, Walk thou before me, and be thou perfect; for
I am God Almighty, and All-sufficient: and did not he know, what God is? and
did not all the Saints know, what God is? that gave forth Scripture, while they
were upon Earth? And did not John say, We are of God, (1 John 4)? and did not
he know him, what he is? and John said, God dwelled in him, and he in God (
Joh. 4, 15, 16.) and whosoever confesses the Son of God, has God, and he that
dwells in Love, dwells in God, and God in him, (1 John 4.) And G. F. does
know, That God is, and is the Rewarder of them, that diligently seek him:
blessed be his Name for ever! And did not the Apostles and Prophets know this,
while they were upon the Earth, before the Next Life and Heavenly State to
come? else how could they declare it, if they did not know it, That God is; and
is the Rewarder of all, that diligently seek him, whilst they were upon Earth?
But R. W. thou art out of this Diligence, and in an Evil Work against God's
People, that are diligently seeking him, that know, That God is, etc.

R. W. Thou speak of the Devil blowing out the Candle, and Torch and Sun of
the holy Books and Records, etc. and then thou say; Is it not the Devil's
Trade, to play the subtle Hunter ( as do also his Journey-men, p. 117.
who ly in wait to Catch men) and to trim his Pits and Gins, and Snares with
Green Leaves, etc. viz. Fair Pretenses of the Spirit, Immediate Spirit,
Infallible Spirit, Teachings of the Spirit, the Manner of the Spirit, Speaking
to the Spirit, and Christ within you, the Hope of Glory etc. and these are fair
Leaves (thou say,) and sweet and heavenly green Boughs, on which the Old
Serpent twineth, and from whence he utters even Scripture it self, and the
names of God and Christ, and Spirit in a Frantic Purpose to Stab the holy
Scriptures, and God and Christ and Spirit also.

Answ. R. W. Thou must apply this at home, and the New England Priests and
Professors. Can the Devil blow out the Torch and Sun of the holy Books and
Records? what is this Sun, thou have not manifest it; if he could, he would
have blown it out before now: but the Sun of Righteousness, or Substance of the
Holy Records is too hot for him to blow out; for Christ will destroy and
consume him with the breath of his Mouth, and the Brightness of his Coming. And
the Devil and Antichrist may get the Form of Godliness, and the
Sheeps-cloathing, and so from that to talk of Christ without; but neither the
Devil, nor thou, nor Antichrist can endure to hear the Talk of the Spirit
within, Christ within, and of his Infallible Spirit, and the Teaching of the
Spirit, and the Manner of the Spirit's speaking to the Churches, and Christ in
you, the Hope of Glory* was not this the Doctrine, the Apostles preached, He
that has an Ear, let him hear, what the Spirit says to the Churches? and the
Apostle was Minister of the Spirit. And what! do thou Blasphemously call this
Doctrine of the Apostles, a Trimming of the Devil and his Journey-men, its Gins
and Snares? and the Serpent's Twining with these fair Leaves, green Boughs? And
so, do thou call the Apostle's Doctrine a Frentick purpose to stab the holy
Scriptures, and God, and Christ and Spirit also? and is not this Blasphemy in
thee? can the Devil catch God and Christ, and his Spirit, and stab them? what!
is the Devil here greater, then God, Christ and his Spirit? O R. W. the Envy
has blinded thee! I must tell thee, Christ destroys the Devil and his Works:
the Devil can not stab Christ, nor God, nor his Spirit; but he will cast him
alive in the Lake of Fire: and the Lord will judge thee for thy Wicked Words
here. And for all thy Wicked Words and Blasphemies we cannot deny, but must own
the Apostle's Doctrine of the Spirit's Teaching Really, without any pretense;
and so G. F. means, as he speaks) and how the Ministers of the Spirit sow
to the Spirit; and, Know ye not, that Christ is in you, Except ye be
Reprobates: and Christ is in the Saints the Hope of Glory; whom the Apostle
preached, that he might rule the peoples hearts by Faith: who does rule now.
And all thy Railing Words are little to us: We know, that the Devil does rage
against Christ dwelling in his Saints, and may persecute him in his* Members;
but he is risen far above the Devil at the Right Hand of God: and so, he is too
high for the Devil and his Journey-men to stab him, as thou Wickedly say.
And we charge R. W. and all his New England Priests, to show us, where it is
written in Scriptures, that the living God and his Son can be stabbed? and to
prove these Horrid Blasphemies, which we deny.

R. W. And thou say, G. F. knows that we do affirm, that no Reading or
Hearing, no Meditation, no Afflictions, etc. can do a Soul any good, until God
by the Power or Finger of his own self, or Spirit make the means Powerful and
Effectual.

Answ. And R. W. do not thou say (page 88.) that the Scripture was the Sword,
and the Only Sword? and what R. W! Reading, Meditating, Hearing will do the
soul No Good, until God by his Power and Finger, and Spirit make the means
Powerful and Effectual? and what a Contradiction is this, R. W.? for page 88.
thou say, The Scriptures are the Only Sword, by which Wicked men may kill
and do hurt withal: and now here, It is of no Value without the Spirit? and
yet, The Scriptures are the Ground and Author of Christ's and the Saints Faith?
and now thou have overthrown thy own Assertions in thy Book withal. Then R. W.
thou grantest the Immediate Means of this Power and Spirit of God, which thou
have been Fighting and Opposing all this while against us.

R. W. And thou tellest us of a Story or Proverb of a Sow Teaching the Goddess
of Wisdom. p. 118.


Answ. And this thou applyest to us; but thou must apply it at home, with all
thy Mystical Filthiness, thou speak of: and we can declare the Wisdom, which
we have received from Christ and God our Teacher, and tell thee, The Fear of
God is the Beginning of it.

R. W. And thou runnest over and over about the Immediate Teaching of the
Spirit of God within, and art quarreling with the Immediate Spirit of God to G.
F.'s Answer to T. H. And thou say again R. W. Their Spirit will tell us,
That God and Christ etc. New Covenant, and Faith, and Holiness, etc. are all in
Prison in every Man.

Answ. How often have thou spoken this over and over in thy Book! which are thy
own Forged Lies, and not my Words: as the Reader may see in my Books, there is
no such thing in my Book or Writings; for they are Words I never heard before.
For Christ is ascended far above all the Heavens, and sits at the Right Hand
of God: you cannot Imprison him, or his Father; though his Light ye may hate,
and his Spirit ye may grieve and quench: but as I said before, it will Judge
and Condemn you. And we do confess, The Spirit of Truth will lead us into all
Truth, and to God and Christ, from which it comes: though thou Scoffingly
say, Round, in a Conjuring Circle; That Christ brings to Christ, etc. which
yet thou confessest To be True: What! have thou brought thy self into the
Conjuring Circle? howbeit the Light, that comes from Christ, does give us the
Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus: and this is
Scripture, the Apostles Doctrine.

R. W. says; The Lord boasts of his Servant Job to the Devil, to be a Perfect
Man ( as the Quakers urge, Job 1.) but God Schooled him for his Pride and
Impatience, etc. by Elihu and his own Voice: and Job Confessed his Pride and
Ignorance, and abhorred himself, and professed, he would prate no more; and
abhorred himself as in Dust and Ashes. And G. F. in his Book abhors the Term of
Dust and Ashes, etc. with a many more Railing Words.

Answ. That is False; for G. F. no where in his Book abhors Dust and Ashes,
as the Reader may see. And R. W. what an Ill Garb have thou put God's Words in
here? I charge thee and the New-England-Priests. That God and Elihu did School
Job, or that God boasted: let us see Scripture for this. Does Job mention the
Word PRATING? thou can not speak Scripture Language, who art out of the Fear
of God and Reverence of his Words: for if thou did, thou would not Add so
to them, and speak that, which they do not speak, to corrupt Peoples Minds. For
the Lord says, That there is none like Job in all the Earth; and Upright and a
Perfect Man, one that fears God, and escheweth Evil (Job. 2.): and it is
said, In all this Job did not sin with his Lips; in all this Job did not charge
God foolishly in his Sufferings, ( Job 1, 22.2, ^0.) But thou say, God and
Elihu Schooled him for him Pride: but thou have not showed us Chapter and Verse
for it; so they be thy own Words: Job says no such thing of God, That he
Schooled him for his Pride and Impatience; though Job did Humble himself: and
what he said, we own; and God to him.

R. W. Thou say; If it please God to show him (to wit, G. F.) and me truly,
what Sin is, and what Justice is, and what an Infinite Price must pay for the
least Evil Thought, etc. if it please God by any of these Means he uses, p.
119.
to imprint these and other such Heavenly Considerations upon our Souls! we
shall then for all our Pretenses cry out with Peter, Depart from me, for I am a
Sinful Man -- and with Job; -- in Dust and Ashes. But I fear, G. F. is so taken
up with with his Sitting with Christ in Heavenly Places, with Immediate
Dictates of his supposed Holy Spirit, that God's Speaking thus to Poor Worms
after the way of Men, and by these Outward Means stinks in his Nostrils; which
if so, and so Irrecoverably, I desire, and desire all that love God and their
own Salvations, to flee from him, as from Korah's Pride and his Plagues: for
his Vial is pouring on him in Spiritual Judgments, and shall be pouring out on
him in Spiritual and Corporal Torments to all Eternity.

Answ. How now R. W! Is R. W. got up in the Seat of God, like Muggleton? turned
a Reeve and Muggletonian? does not Christ tell thee, Thou must not Judge, lest
thou be Judged? and, Thou must Pluck the Beam out of thy Own Eye, before thou
pluck'st it out of thy Brothers? And have thou forgot thy self, that thou
werest Praying to God for G. F. thy self a few Lines before, for To let thee and
him see, what Sin is, and what Justice is, and what Infinite Price must pay for
the least Evil Thought? and then presently after thou say, The Vial is
pouring out on him in Spiritual Judgments, and shall be on him in Spiritual and
Corporal Torments to all Eternity! How can thou say, It shall be, and is; and
yet art to be showed to thee, What Sin is? and the Price to pay for the Evil
Thought? what Confusion is this? And is not this thy Doting in Darkness with a
Reven full, Malicious Spirit, that can pass Sentence upon another, who do
not yet truly know, what Sin is, nor the Price? how should thou, when thou
hate the Light of Christ, who dyed for Sin, and has bought us with a Price?
I know the Price; and am to Glorify God with Soul, Body and Spirit, which are
his. It seems, thou do not truly know, what Sin is; nor God's Justice, nor
Infinite Price paid for Evil Thoughts and Natural Disposition on the Old Score
(to wit, of Sins); and those Gracious Means of Christ Jesus are not yet
imprinted in thy Heart by the Light of Christ and his Spirit: and thou have not
cried out with Peter, for thou have not that Heavenly Consideration upon thy
Soul, as he had, being out of his Light and Spirit. And how should thou?
since thou do not truly see, what Sin is, nor the Price? thou have not felt
the Blood of Christ to Sprinkle the Conscience, as we and the Saints have done;
nor the Light of Christ, to show thee thy Sin, and Christ, from which it
comes, to save thee from thy Sin. Neither have thou seen Job's Condition, Once
have I spoken, yea Twice -- and abhorred himself, etc. and if thou had, thou
would never have uttered so many Lies and Slanders, and False Judgments upon
me and God's People; which touches us not. And as for thy Spiritual Judgments,
Plagues and Vial, and Spiritual and Corporal Torments to all Eternity, it is
Absolutely turned UPON THY OWN HEAD. This Sentence thou can not Cast upon me,
for it is from a Presumptuous, Envious and Malicious Spirit in thee: for, how
should thou pass such a Sentence, when thou do not know truly, what Sin
is, nor the Price, etc. on the Old Score, and have No Voice nor Motion in thy
Heart to listen to, of Heavenly Things? And therefore R. W, All will come upon
thy self, and what Measure thou measurest to me, or another, it will come to
thee again, and will press down and run over; thou will have it, Poor Man! and
it touches not me. And as for Korah's Pride, thou may look at home: and if
thou had minded Job's Words, Once I have spoken, and Speak no more, etc.
thou had never given forth this Lying, Slanderous Book against me and God's
People. And God speaking to Poor Worms after the Way of Men etc. by his Spirit,
Men by his Spirit understand, hear and obey him: So, All the Means and Ways of
God I do esteem, and they do not Stink in my Nostrils, as thou scornfully and
scoffingly speak; and against the Immediate Dictates of the Spirit, which
thou call, Supposed Holy Spirit, which Word SUPPOSED, we deny: for we own
the Holy Ghost Really, and have the Comfort of the Holy Ghost, and Fellowship.

And thou Scoffingly say; I fear, G. F. is so taken up with his Sitting with
Christ in Heavenly Places, with Immediate Dictates of his Supposed Holy Spirit,
I fear his Case --. And thou, that Sit not in the Heavenly Places in Christ
Jesus, where do thou Sit R. W. and ye New-England-Priests and Professors?
where do ye bring People to Sit? in Sin and Death, and Old Adam? The Apostle
says; Even We, when we were Dead in Sins, has He quickened us together with
Christ, ( by Grace ye are saved) and has Raised us up together, and made us
Sit together in the Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus: that in the Ages to Come
he might show the Exceeding Riches of his Grace in his Kindness toward us
through Jesus Christ ( Ephesians. 2.) -- And now R. W. THESE AGES ARE COME; and God
has quickened his People, which was Dead in Sins and Trespasses: and has
Raised us up together, and made us Sit together in Heavenly Places in Christ
Jesus. So these Exceeding Riches and Kindness is manifest to us in these Ages
through Jesus Christ, that was Manifest to the Apostles, GLORY TO GOD FOR EVER!
And thou, that Sit not here in this Heavenly Place in Christ Jesus, art yet
Dead in thy Sins, Vn-quickned: and read thy Sitting, thy Life and Conversation,
Ephesians. 2, 2, 3. And neither R. W. nor ye New-England-Priests can Pluck us out
of the Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus, where God has Raised us up by his
Spirit above your Sin and Death; where thou and the New-England-Priests Sit,
and Rail, and Scoff and Persecute them, that Sit in the Heavenly Places in
Christ Jesus, the AMEN, who is the First and the Last, GLORY TO GOD FOR EVER
MORE through Jesus Christ!

G. F. I. B.

The 5 th. Month, 1677.
POSTSCRIPT.
ANd R. W. thou and the People know, that thou brought G. F.'s Fol. 56.
at the Dispute at Newport, to prove, That G. F. said, ["The Blood of Christ was
Corruptible, and that it was, like the Blood of another Man:] and from thence
thou did endeavor to prove, That our Christ was not the True Christ, and G.
F. a Blasphemer. But when the Place was read in G. F.'s Book, it was found to
be the Priest's Sayings, and not G. F.'s, to wit, That the Blood of Christ was
Corruptible, and so, like the Blood of another Man: (for G. F.'s Answer to the
Priest is; That the Blood of Christ, which cleanses from all Sin, is
Incorruptible; as the Reader may read Fol. 56.) And so R. W. seeing, it were
the Priest's Words, and not G. F.'s, which he brought to Condemn G. F. and us
with-al in the Face of the Country, and to prove, That our Christ was not the
True Christ; he seeing, that it was proved to be the Priest's Words, out of G.
F.'s Book, and not G. F.'s, he turned about to maintain the Priest's Words, to
wit, That Christ's Blood was Corruptible, and asserted, as follows. (Which
was taken then in Characters; and we do not question, but that the
Sober-minded, Vnprejudiced People then there, may remember the Words) viz. 1.
R. W. said; I affirm, That the Blood of Christ, that he Shed, was Material, as
another Man's, and was Corruptible. 2. R. W. said; I say, That the Blood From
hence he might as well Argue, That the Flesh of Christ being Material, was
therefore Corruptible; which is contrary to the Apostle's Doctrine, ( Act. 2,
31.) Neither did his Flesh see Corruption.
of Christ was Corruptible and Corrupted, (with many other Unsavory Words.)


John Stubs answered: [Take heed Roger, what thou say. We do not deny, but
Blood came out of his Side; but yet we say, That the Blood of Christ is
Incorruptible: and we say, That we were never Able to pay or satisfy God; yet
Christ leads his People by his Spirit, and reconcileth them to his Father,
etc.] -- And we dare not for all the World to Assert that, which R. W. has
Affirmed here; to wit, That the Blood of Christ is Corruptible, and did
Corrupt: for we know, that we are Redeemed not with Corruptible Things, etc.
but with the Precious Yet in another place in his Book R. W. does affirm, That
he is Redeemed by the Blood of God (which Blood he says, is Corruptible)
Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without Blemish and Spot (1 Pet. 1, 18, 19.)

3. R. W. affirmed, That Salvation was by a Man, that was Corruptible; I do not
say, Corrupted. So far R. W.

J. B. Answered and said to this purpose: I desire not to grate upon the
Ancient Man; but am sorry, that he should so over shoot himself, as he has
done, so far to deny Christ, and undervalue his Appearance both Inward and
Outward, as to say, That Christ within was but a Fancy, and a false Christ (as
he then affirmed) and, That Christ without was Corruptible, (contrary to the
Apostle, who said; His Flesh saw no Corruption.) And also of his Appearance
without: Who then also said, That his Blood was Corruptible and Corrupted: as I
believe, many of the people, that was there, may yet remember. I showed then,
how that he had brought upon himself that Charge, and proved himself Guilty of
that, for which he endeavored to Condemn us. And I spoke at that time of our
Owning of the true Lord Jesus Christ in his Appearing in that Body, and of his
Suffering and Resurrection, according to the Scriptures: And also of his
Spiritual Appearing in his Saints after his Ascension, according to the Promise
of Christ and the Testimony of his Apostles: as I then brought many Testimonies
out of Scriptures, to maintain and prove the same. And so signified fully to
the people of our true Owning of Christ; and there bore Testimony against his
dangerous Words, that he had then uttered before them in speaking (contrary to
what is written) of Christ's being Corruptible, and his Blood: and was (as I
then signified) truly sorry, that he should so sin against God and Christ, and
wrong his own Soul.

(1.) And now, how could W. E. do any otherwise, but Charge R. W with Blasphemy
against Christ, his Body and Blood? For he affirms, that the Light of Christ
is an Idol, a Fancy, a Frantic Light; and Christ within, an Imaginary Christ:
as ye may see in many places of his Book.

(2) He affirms, That Salvation was by a Man, that was Corruptible, and that
this Blood was Corruptible and Corrupted.

Now we do Charge R. W. and all the New England Priests, (together with those
Baptists, that took his part against us at Rode-Island and Providence at the
Dispute) to make those his Assertions good by Scripture, if they can (which we
do affirm, are Blasphemies) and show us Chapter and Verse, which he says, is
the Rule and Touchstone; and so, let his Horrible Blasphemies be Touched and
Tried with Scripture. For David says, ( Psalm. 16.) My Heart is glad, and my
Glory rejoiceth; my Flesh also rests in Hope: for thou will not leave my Soul
in Hell; neither will thou suffer thy HOLY ONE to see Corruption. And again the
Apostle says (who spoke of the Resurrection of Christ) That his Soul was not
left in Hell; neither [Mark] his FLESH did see Corruption, ( Act. 2, 27, 31.)
And ( Act. 13, 34.) Thou shall not suffer thy Holy One to see Corruption. David
saw Corruption; but he, whom God raised again (to wit, Christ) saw [Mark] NO
CORRVPTION. Now, if R. W. and the New-England-Priests be Redeemed by a
Corruptible Man, and a Corruptible Blood, that did Corrupt, this is contrary to
what the Apostle says, His Flesh saw no Corruption: and, They were not
Redeemed with Corruptible things, but with the Precious Blood of Christ. So, it
is clearly proved, that Christ his Flesh and Blood is not Corruptible, but
Incorruptible: And therefore R. W.'s Corruptible Man (and Corruptible Blood,
that did Corrupt (by which he pretends, he is Saved) is a false Christ, and not
the Christ the Apostles preached, the true Lord Jesus; whose Flesh and Blood
did not Corrupt. And if the Flesh and Blood of Christ as ( R. W. affirms) be
Corruptible; then how is he in Heaven with Corruptible Flesh and Blood, when
the Apostle says, Corruption does not inherit Incorruption? (1 Cor. 15, 50.)

Christ sanctifies the people with his own Blood, ( Heb. 13:) and (1 Pet. 1,
2.) the Saints were sprinkled with the Blood of Jesus: and (1 John 1.) that
Blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all Sins: and ( Revel. 1.) He has washed
us from our Sins: and, Christ has Redeemed us to God by his Blood ( Rev. 5,
9:) and the Saints Garments were made white in the Blood of the Lamb ( Rev. 7:)
and the Saints Overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, ( Rev. 12, 11:) and Christ
says, Who eats my Flesh, and drinks my Blood, etc. and My Blood is Drink
indeed. Now, was it Corruptible Blood, o^ Corruptible Flesh, that the Saints
did Eat? and Corruptible blood, which cleanses from all Sins, and made the
Saints Garments White, by which they Overcame? O Horrid Darkness! For will not
corruptible stain, and not fetch out the Stain? And the Saints were to have
Faith in Christ's Blood ( Romans 25:) The Saints are made Nigh to God by the
Blood of Christ: the Flock of God, which Christ has purchased with his own
Blood ( Act. 20, 28.)

NOW, if this be the New England Priests Principle, Profession and Judgment,
that they be Redeemed by a corruptible Man, and the Blood of Christ Jesus was
Corruptible and Corrupted; then they, that have tolerated R. W.'s his
Blasphemous book to be printed (that held forth those Abominable things in his
Dispute before a great Assembly of people at Newport in Rode-Island) how can we
say otherwise, but they are ^lasphemers, and own not the true Lord Christ
Jesus, whose Flesh saw no corruption; neither was his Blood corruptible. And
therefore we do Conclude with the Apostle, that R. W. and they that held forth
this Doctrine with him, are such, as have Trodden under Foot the Son of God,
and counted the Blood of the New Covenant, wherewith they were sanctified, an
Unholy Thing: and have done Despite unto the Spirit of Grace; and have
Crucified to themselves the Son of God a-fresh, and put him to open Shame.

Now see, if this Man R. W. that has spoken those Blasphemous Words against
Christ Jesus, his body, and Blood, and Spirit and Light, is fit to take the
Name of Christ in his Mouth? And yet this Man, he brought this Saying of the
Priest to be G. F.'s to prove, That our Christ was not the true Christ: Which
words proving to be the Priest's, and not G. F's. he ( R. W.) stood by them,
and maintained them against us. And so by his own Argument and Judgment by the
same Rule and Words, that he would have disproved ours, he has proved His own
Christ not to be the True Christ. But should we (the People of God in Scorn
called Quakers) have come, and preached in New England and told you, that you
were Saved by a Man, that was Corrupt^ble, and that Christ's Blood was
Corruptible and Corrupted, and that you were Washed and Cleansed by such a
Blood; then ye might have said, What a Hellish Doctrine is this indeed! Which
we abhor, and such Doctri^es, as R. W. has preached to us in the Dispute. And
our Desires are, that the Lord God of Heaven may deliver all people from such
Doctrines! Of all the Doctrines, that ever we read, we never heard the like.

And this is New-England's Orator, that so does Flatter the King: But let the
King but read his former Books, and his Book of the Bloody Tenant (in 1652.)
and there he may see, R. W. was in another Mind, when he flattered the
Parliament, and justified their High Court of Justice against the Opposers. And
yet he pleads for Liberty of Conscience, and against Persecution: But R. W.
is fallen from that Plea, who now desires the Magistrates to persecute us, and
punish us, etc. and it must not be called Persecution neither (as in his page
200.) And many things we could bring out of his former Books, which would
render him very Uncertain; but we shall forbear at present, and leave him to
the Lord: for his Books declare themselves, what he said then, and what he
says now.

But the Reader may see, how R. W. has invented and Forged many Words against
us, the People of God in Scorn called Quakers, which we never spoke nor wrote;
so that they are none of ours, but his own. And of those his own invented,
blasphemous Words he has made an Image, and set it up; and has proclaimed an
Herault against it and us: but is fallen upon him self. And so the Light of
Christ he calls Fancy and a Dunghill, a Feigned, Whimsical Light, a Frantic
Light and an Idol: and he has affirmed, that the Man Christ is Corruptible,
and his Blood is Corruptible and Corrupted. And this is like the Priest's
Saying, (which R. W. has printed in his Book p. 57.) because we say, Christ is
in his People) viz. Can any Man Contain Christ a Man of four Foot long? Might
not the Bad and Ignorant people (like him) have said so to Paul, when he told
them, Know ye not, that Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? So thou art
Ignorant of Christ and his Spirit, how he dwells in his people; and art far
degenerated from the Apostle's Doctrine, else R. W. would never have brought
this against us, as to say; We did not own the true Lord Jesus, because that a
Man cannot contain a Man of four Foot long in him, therefore Christ does not
dwell in the Hearts of his Saints by Faith. But this is a gross Ignorance and
Error from the Apostle's Doctrine: For we never asserted, That a Man should
contain a Man of four Foot long; this is the Priest's Doctrine, and not ours,
who are the People of God.

And have not the New-England-Men, Priests and Professors Burned Scriptures
(yea, many very good Scriptures) when they Burned our Books, which were full of
Scriptures? and how could they Burn them without Burning Scriptures? Yet we
cannot but believe, (we have so much Charity) that all the people, nay, all the
Professors in New England, are not of the same wicked Judgment with R. W. and
the rest of the New-England-priests and professors, whose Hands have been deep
in the BLOOD of our Brethren. So our Design is, all that are Simple and
Tenderhearted, and have a Love to the true Lord Jesus Christ, (whose Flesh saw
no Corruption, and does Redeem with his Precious Blood, and not with
Corruptible things) that they may Repent, and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ,
who says, Learn of me: who is the Way, the Truth and the Life; and No Man
comes to the Father, but by him. And God says, This is my Well-Beloved Son,
Hear ye him: And so we say; Hear him by his Light, Grace and Truth, and do not
hate his Light, nor turn his Grace into Wantonness, nor quench his Spirit;
least the Light be your Condemnation. For we declare unto you; God will pour
out his Fury upon all the Families upon Earth, that call not upon his Name. And
God says; In the last Days, (which are the Days of his New Covenant) he will
pour out of his Spirit upon all Flesh: That so with his Spirit they may call
upon his Name, from whom they have both Help and Strength through Jesus Christ;
who is the Beginning and Ending, the First and the Last, who is manifest in his
People by his Light, Grace, Power and Spirit, through whom they can Sing
HALLELVIAH, and PRAISE THE LORD!

And --

R. W. says ( Append. p. 76.) I observe, the Instrumental and Purchasing Cause
or Price is said to be his Blood, which argues the Infinite Value of his
Sufferings; in which Respect only it is called the Blood of God. I know the
Light Esteem, that some of these Foxians have of the Blood of the Lord Jesus,
saying, That wicked Men, the Soldiers shed it; that it was spilt upon the
Ground: and there was no difference between that Blood, and the Blood of
another Saint.

Answ. R. W. We desire thee to observe (if it be us, whom thou meanest in thy
scornful Word Foxians) how thou chargest upon us a Light Esteem of the Blood of
the Lord Jesus, in sayiny, That wicked Men shed it; and that it was spilt upon
the Ground: and that there was no difference between that Blood, and the Blood
of another Saint. Which Charge we do believe is false, like the rest of thy
Charges; and the Matter we do disown from ever entering into our Thoughts to
think, much less to speak of his Precious Blood (by which we have been
Redeemed) That there was no difference between that Blood, and the Blood of
another Saint: For none are Saints, but such as are Redeemed by it, and have
Faith in it, and therefore is above the Blood of all Saints.

But Roger, recollect thy Thoughts, and call to mind thy own Sayings at Newport
(if thy Memory be so good, as thou in thy Book seem to hold forth, in
writing things from thy Memory; for thou say, None writ for thee.) And when
thou have reviewed thy lines (in page 76. of the Append.) and called thy Words
at Newport into Remembrance; and then see, if this saying be not fulfilled upon
thee, The Wise are taken in their own Craft. In thy Book thou say, It is
called the Blood of God; though at Newport thou said, It was Material Blood,
as another Man's, and was Corruptible and Corrupted: and further said, Thou
did not know, but that the Fowls, or some other Creatures might eat it up.
--

How now, Roger! Art not thou now fallen into the Pit, thou digged'st for
others? As thou did at Newport, when thou charged'st the like thing upon G.
F. and thought thereby to prove our Christ not to be the true Christ; which
upon Trial did prove to be the Sayings of the Priest: And when thou found'st it
to be his Sayings, and G. F.'s to the Contrary; than that which thou had
Condemned in G. F. (and for which thou did condemn us, and the true Lord
Jesus Christ, in whom we believe) thou Justified'st in him, and then
asserted'st further, as is before signified.

What Credit is to be given to such an one, that will Condemn a thing, because
such a Man or people holds it; and again will Justify the very same thing,
because an other in Opposition holds it? Is not this the Case in this very
Point, as it is in very many things in thy Book? As may be seen by all that
read it, how thou Judge, Condemnest and Opposest the very Doctrine of Christ
and his Apostles, because held forth by us; wherein thou show rather Malice,
than so good as a blind Zeal.

And further we may tell thee, That thy Memory has either greatly failed thee,
or thy Malice has transported thee far beyond the Government of it in thy
Narrative, in not Dealing faithfully in thy Relation: For which (with many
others of thy false Charges, the Lord will Judge thee! For in this one
particular thou may see, how thou have condemned thy self in the thing thou
have allowed: And so in Judging another Condemnest thy self, being guilty of
the same, for which thou have condemned others, which were Clear Men.

as follows.
A Lantskip of a Battle, Popish and Arminian Opposites (the Quakers) their
Smoke out of the deep Pit. Pope and Quakers, their Enthusiasms and Impostures,

that they accepted of my Offer, and had appointed a Day for it, etc. But of the
2d. Day's Dispute R. W. says of himself (p. 42.) viz: I heartily wished, that

Argues, Th^^ because the Saint are God's Temple, therefore they must be God
himself: and because Christ dwells in his Saints, therefore they must be Christ
himself; and therefore our Flesh is God and Christ. See, what blasphemous Stuff
this Person has brought forth! which he most-unjustly Inve^^s upon the
Quakers; when it is not at all deducible from any of their Opinions or
Principles. We can challenge him herein for a forbid, blasphemous Perverter;
which would the more easily appear, if he durst show those Principles of the
Quakers, from which he thus Inverts and Inferrs upon them those blasphemous
Inferences for adhearing to the Apostle's Doctrine, viz: The Saints are the
Temple of God; and God dwells in them: and, Christ in them, etc.

Muggleton's Curse.
and shall be pouring on him in Spiritual and Corporal Torments to all Eternity.

AND let the Gentle Reader see, how that above 12 times he mentioned NAKED over
and over; and how often over and over he mentions SAMVEL'S MANTLE: and above
110. times he scornfully says FOXIANS, that he might fill up his Book with
such scornful Expressions and Ungracious Language. And there are not many
pages, where he does not call us one bad Name or the other; or compares us
with Papists or some others to make us Ridiculous: Such Ungracious Language and
Unwholesom Words we have never met with in any one's Writings, for a Volumn to
be so stuffed with such Abundance before, as may be seen, by what is here before
written. And page 85. and p. 117. of his Book the Reader may Observe, how he
judges and condemns us to be as Far from the Ministers of Christ, as Lambs
and Doves are from Ravenous, Popish and Devilish Lions and Eagles: and likewise
he judges from (as he says) the Irrationality and Vnruliness of our Spirit,
and says, It is apparent from our bitter and frantic Revilings, etc. and so
compares us to the Devilish Inquisitors, Monks and Friars, etc. Now if these
be certainly Fruits of a Wrong Spirit, to wit, Bitter and Frantic Revilings,
Vnruliness, Irrationality, Unwholesom and Ungratious Words (as they are) and do
manifest a Man to be Contrary to Christ's Messengers, as far as Doves and Lambs
do differ from Lions and Eagles; Then has he largely manifested himself not to
be one of Christ's Messengers, but the Contrary: as all Sober Readers may see
by his Language given in his Book upon us.

[R. W.'s Temporizing Spirit made manifest]
AND the Reader may see, how R. W. flattereth the King in his Epistle to him,
and says; Charles the Great was one of the Greatest Princes of that Name in
the World, and Charles the Fifth ( both Emperors) had his Wonderful Trick at
Helm also; but both (and all) turn into the Cabin of Rottenness: Charles the
Fifth in his 58. Year; Charles the Great in his 72. Year. But were every drop
of Water between your Old England and New a Million of Years, yet Mors ultima
linea (Death the last Line) and it is but Momentum, unde pendet Aeternitas ( a
Moment, whereon depends Eternity,) etc. And R. W. in his Book of Experiments
in the Epistle to Lady Vane 1652. says; How has he Crowned the Memory of
those his Second Zealous Servants in King Henry the Seventh his Days with a
most Eminent, Blessed Succession of such Names and Spirits at this Day, Cromwell
and Lambert, etc. Is not here R. W.'s. Flattery and Temporizing Spirit made
manifest, let the Reader judge!

And R. W. who has now so much flattered the King in his Epistle (in his Book
1676) and would have us to be punished; but let R. W. read his Book called The
Bloody Tenant, etc. (1652.) and his Epistle to the High-Court of Parliament,
what he says there of the King. R. W.'s words are, as follows: The late King
Charles his Conscience, to oppress the Consciences of others, no small
Occasions of the Ruin of him and his. So Roger, read thy words in thy Book
(1652.) and those in thy Epistle to the King now (in 1676.) against the Quakers.

And in Bloody Tenant (p. 186.) the Reader may see, how R. W. there flattereth
the Parliament, who says as follows: The Drawing of the Sword of Justice
against such Tyrants, I believe, has prevailed in Heaven for the Parliament's
Succes^ and Prosperity, etc. and a great deal more to the same Effect in this
page.

And R. W. in his Letter to Governor Indicot says: Had it not pleased the God
of Heaven, who bound the Insolent Rage of the Furious Ocean, to raise up a
Second Cromwell, like a Mighty or Merciful Wall or Bull-wark, to stay the Fury
of the Oppressor, whether English, Scottish, Popish, Presbiterian, Independent,
etc. And now here thou flatter'st Cromwell (in thy page 305.) and seem to be
against Persecution; yet in this Book (1676.) when thou flatterest the King,
thou would have us persecuted. And thou say in thy Epistle to the
High-Court of Parliament: The Act of Civil Engagements of great Necessity, etc.
SO see Roger, what a FLATTERER thou have been of the Parliament and Oliver, and
now the King: and once wast against Persecution; and now would have us
punished; and yet we must not call it Persecution (as thou may see thy Book
in 1676. p. 200.)

AND so the Reader may see, how R. W. is Changed in his Book of Hireling
Ministry none of Christ's, in 1652 (see his page 18.) where he says: The Civil
State never made a Good Woork in Spirituals. NOW, what say the Governors of N.
England to R. W. in this? has not he Judged you here, who have given so much
Money for Printing of his Book? And does in the 17 page tell you, How you
Priests are like the Pharisees in the Vpper-most Rooms in the Synagogues and
Feasts, and of their Titles and Salutations? And yet would not he have the
People of God called Quakers Persecuted, because not Giving Titles, and is
offended, because he has not their Salutations? As ye may read, what R. W.
says of them, that came to his House ( J. Stubs and J. Burnyeat, etc.) and did
not give him a Salutation, when they were in Dispute with him.

And ( page 16. of the said Book of Hireling Ministry, etc.) does not R. W. Cry
against the Priests, How they are fitted in the Way of Prentiship, to set up
the Trade and Way of Preaching, and calls them Spiritual Merchants, a Trade
of selling God himself, Christ Jesus, the Holy Spirit, Heaven and Hell too,
their own Souls and the Souls of Thousands? -- HOW now Roger! Wast thou of this
Trade? And are the New-England-Priests of this Trade, who served Apprentiship?
But if they Sold God himself, and Christ Jesus and his Holy Spirit, and Heaven
and Hell, and their own Souls ( and the Souls of Thousands more) Then what is
left? But R. W. Who has bought them? The Scripture speaks of Judas selling
his Master. But the N. England Magistrates may see, what the N. England Priests
are, and others; and what they have bred them up to do, according to R. W.'s
Doctrine (in 1652) whom now ye have given Money to print his Book.

And further --

R. W. says (p. 14. in the Margent) Universities as to the Ministry of Jesus
Christ are none of his Institutions: the Title SCHOLAR appropriated to the
Ministers, is a Sacrilegious and a Theevish Title robbing all Believers and
Saints. -- And ( page 15. in the Margent) he says, Universities in Order to
Christ's Ministry (are) but Refined Monasteries. And, Batchelours of Divinity
(or Godliness) and Doctor of Divinity (are) so Clearly and Expressly Opposite to
the Command of Christ Jesus, and (in the Margent) Pharisaical and Popish
Titles. NOW, what think ye now, ye Magistrates of N. England and ye Priests, of
R. W.'s Doctrine here? Has not he paid you off? And is not he Changed from
what he was? And --

R. W. says (in his 13. page,) We have Indians at home, Indians in Wales,
Indians in Ireland, and the Body of the Protestant Nations is yet Unconverted,
as to the Point of True Conversion and Regeneration by God's Spirit -- And
further R. W. says; Who can deny, but that the Body of this and all Other
Protestant Nations ( as well as Popish) are Unconverted? SO here R. W, Judges
all, but himself: But let him see in his Book against G. F. in 1676. how be
Extolleth the N. England Protestants (so called) since they have DRVNK the
BLOOD of the Righteous, God's People called Quakers? And --

R. W. says in his Book of Hireling Ministers, etc. (page 8.) Jesus Christ
never made Bargains with his Messengers or Pastors. And R. W. says: He that
makes a Trade of Preaching, No longer Pay, No longer Pray; no longer Preach,
no longer Fast, etc. [Then ye have PAY.] Further he tells you, That if ye are
brought up to that only Trade, ye must make your Livelihood of it (p. 9.) --
And further thou say: The Hireling will not (indeed he cannot, having no
other way to live) move his Lip or Tongue. -- And R. W. further tells the
Protestants of Tithes and Stipends, Wages and Salaries, and of your Removing
from Lean into Fatter Benefices: -- And has not here R. W. spoken as much
against Baxter, Owen and his N. England-Priests, as he has done against the
Quakers?

And ye Magistrates and Priests of N. England, does not R. W. tell you, ( page
3. in his Book of Hireling Ministry, 1652.) The Civil State cannot Restrain nor
Constrain into Spirituals? -- Then why have ye Magistrates and Priests
persecuted, WHIPPED, imprisoned and put to DEATH the Lambs of Christ, when R. W.
preaches this Doctrine to you, That the Civil State cannot Restrain or
Constrain to Spirituals? And why did not the Magistrates of N. England print
this Book of R. W. over again (of 1652. and his other Books that he wrote in
1652) where he flattereth the Parliament? For did ye not give him Money, to
help him print his Book against the people of God called Quakers (in 1676)? But
ye may see some of the Heads in R. W.'s Book (in 1652.) as follows: 1. The
National and Parishional Constitution of Churches is found to be the Grand Idol
of the Nation. [Then may not this be applied to your Nation of New England?] 2.
The Enforcing of the Nation to such a Constitution is the greatest
Soul-Oppression in this Nation. 3. The Hireling Ministry attending upon such
Assemblies or Others, is none of the Ministry of Christ Jesus, etc. [Which the
Reader may read the rest of them, and read his other books, and this Book in
1676. and see now, how he Flattereth Owen and Baxter; and Contradicts and
Confounds himself.]
And --

R. W. says in his Fifth Head; It is the Absolute Duty of the Civil State, to
set free the Souls of all Men from that so long Oppressing Yoke of such
Ministries and Churches. But instead of this have not ye N. England States set
up this Oppressing, Persecuting Ministry and Church? And is not R. W. now joind
with you in the Work, let your Practice speak?

R. W. further says ( page 7.) It is one of the Grand Designs of the Most
High, to break down the Hireling Ministry, that Trade, Faculty, Calling, and
Living by Preaching; and that if all the Princes, States, Parliaments and
Armies in the World should join their Heads, and Hearts, and Arms and Shoulders
to support it, yet being a part of Babel and Confusion, it shall sink as a
Mil-stone from the Angel's, Hand into the Deeps for ever! -- And (page 19.) he
says: It is not the Will of the Father of Spirits, that all the Consciences
and Spirits of this Nation should Violently (vi and armis) be forced into One
Way of Worship, or that any Town or Parish (so called) in England, Scotland or
Ireland be disturbed in their Worship, (what Worship soever it be) by the Civil
Sword. -- And (page 20.) he says: Such Priests and Ministers, as can force a
Maintenance (of Tithes or otherwise) by the Sword, or else Cease Preaching for
want of such or such a Maintenance, or can Remove from Bishoprics or Benefices
( as Calves and Bulls of Bashan) for fatter and ranker Pastures; or wanting
Spiritual Work and Maintenance, are too fine to Work with their Hands, as the
first Patterns, Christ's first Ministers did, how can they say, as Peter to
Christ Jesus, LORD, thou Know all things, thou know, I Love thee? etc. --
And in his Epistle Dedicatory he says: If I give flattering Titles unto Men,
my Maker ( said Elihu) would quickly take me away. Yet R. W. would have us
Persecuted, because we cannot give Flattering Titles (as may be seen in his
Book of 1676.)

NOW Roger Williams may see, how he now flattereth Baxter and Owen, and the New
England-Priests and Professors, and how he Contradicts himself in his own
Testimony in his Book in 1652. as before.

TWO LETTERS, one of William Coddington of Rode-Island and the other of Richard
Scot of Providence in New England testifying against R. Williams aforesaid and
his Slanderous and Wicked Book.
[Part of W. C's Letter Concerning R. W.]
HERE is a lying, scandalous Book of Roger Williams of Providence, Printed at
Cambridge in New England: John Burnyeat was at the Dispute with W. Edmundson,
and John Barker with Roger Williams; however here are yet many Witnesses
living, that can Witness with us (even all unbyassed Spirits) that he had made
14. Proposals to be Disputed 7. at Newport on this Isle, and 7. at Providence.
His Inveterate Malice was so great against the Truth, that he would have put us
in a Lion's Skin, and set Dog's to worry us; but the Lord Reproved his Madness:
That though there were many, that did bear Evil Will to Zion, the City of the
Living God, and said in their Hearts, RACE it Race it to the Ground; Yet was
there not one found, that would own his Propositions. Blessed be God, we are
known in the Nations to be a People of another Spirit: though William Edmundson
and the rest did in and by the Power of the Lord Answer all his 7. Proposals in
about two Hours; I Reading of them at Newport and John Cranston (that was
Deputy Governor then and is so now) was desired to moderate the Assembly, that
he might say, what he had to say. He began with a Thunder, and had Three Days
time to bewilder and befool himself, and so ended in a great Eclips of the Sun
(which was taken notice of.) I have known him about 50. Years a mere
Weathercock, Constant only in Inconstancy; Poor Man! that does not know, what
should become of his Soul, If this Night it should be taken from him. He was
for the Priests, and took up their Principles to fight against the Truth, and
to gratify them and ^ad Magistrates, that licked up his Vomit, and wrote the
said Scurrilous Book: and so has transgressed for a Piece of Bread. And so are
all Joined with the Red Dragon to pour out their Flood against the Man-Child:
Into their Secrets let not my Soul come; my Honor, be not thou United!

Dear G. F. I may yet more prove, what I have said. One while he is a
Separatist at New-Plymouth in New England, Ioining with them, till they are
weary of him (as from Morton's Memorials in Print does appear:) Another time
you may have him a Teacher or Member of the Church at Salem in New England: O!
Then a great deal of Devotion is placed in Women wearing of Vails in their
Assemblies, as if the Power of Godliness was in it; and to have the Cross out
of the Colors: and then be against the King's Patent and Authority; and
writteth a large Book in Quarto against it. And another time he is Hired for
Money, and gets a Patent from the Long Parliament; so that it is not long, but
he is off and on it again: One time for Men's wearing Caps, and not Hats for
Covering their Faces; and again Hats, and no Caps: One time for Water Baptism,
Men and Women must be plunged into the Water; and then throw it all down again:
So that Cotton (who in his day did know the Power of God to Salvation) said of
him, That he was a Haberdasher of small Questions against the Power. So they
ought to have feared God and the King, that is, To punish Evildoers; and
therefore not to meddle to their hurt with him, that is given to Change: In a
Letter to Walter Clark he does bewail and detract, that he has Cut himself off
from us. And for John Leverat Governor of the Massachusetts to say, (as I am
Credibly Informed) That he would give 20. Pound, rather than this Mocking,
Persecuting Book should not be Printed -- and the Governor of the
New-Plymouth-Iurisdiction other 5. Pound: and yet to say, I am their Friend,
and their Father-friend, and, they will not forsake, that is; they will not
persecute my Friend. But the Governor of Boston does persecute, as witness
their Whips and Goals. So far W. C. of Rode-Island. (28. day 4 Mon. 77.)

Follows the Letter of R. S. concerning R. W. viz: Friends,
COncerning the Conversation and Carriage of this Man Roger Williams, I have
been his Neighbor these 38. years: I have only been Absent in the time of the
Wars with the Indians, till this present -- I walked with him in the Baptists
Way about 3 or 4 Months, but in that short time of his Standing I discerned,
that he must have the Ordering of all their Affairs, or else there would be no
Quiet Agreement amongst them. In which time he brake off from his Society, and
declared at large the Ground and Reasons of it: That their Baptism could not be
right, because It was not Administered by an Apostle. After that he set upon a
Way of Seeking (with two or three of them, that had dissented with him) by way
of Preaching and Praying; and there he continued a Year or two, till Two of the
Three left him.

That which took most with him, and was his Life, was, To get Honor amongst
Men, especially amongst the Great Ones. For after his Society and he in a
Church Way were parted, he then went to New England, and there he got a
Charter: and coming from Boston to Providence, at Sea-conck the Neighbors of
Providence met him with fourteen Cannoes, and carried him to Providence. And
the Man being hemmed in in the middle of the Cannoes, was so Elevated and
Transported out of himself, that I was condemned in my self, that amongst the
Rest I had been an Instrument to set him up in his Pride and Folly, And he that
before could reprove my Wife, for asking her Two Sons, Why they did not pull of
their Hat's to him? And told her, She might as well bid them pull off their
Shoos, as their Hats (Though afterward she took him in the same Act, and turned
his Reproof upon his own Head) And he, that could not put off his Cap at Prayer
in his Worship, Can now put it off to every Man or Boy, that pulls of his Hat to
him. Though he professed Liberty of Conscience, and was so zealous for it at
the first Coming home of the Charter, that nothing in Government must be Acted,
till that was granted; yet he could be the Forwardest in their Government to
prosecute against those, that could not Join with him in it: as witness his
Presenting of it to the Court at Newport.

And when this would not take Effect, afterward when the Commissioners were
Two of them at Providence, being in the House of Thomas Olney, Senior of the
same Town; Roger Williams propounded this Question to them:

We have a People here amongst us, which will not Act in our Government with
us; What Course shall we take with them?

Then George Cartwright, one of the Commissioners asked him, What manner of
Persons they were? Do they Live quietly and peaceably amongst you? This they
could not deny; Then he made them this Answer:

If they can Govern themselves, they have no need of your Government.

-- At which they were silent.

This was told again by a Woman of the same House (where the Speech was spoken)
to another Woman, whom the Complaint with the rest was made against, who
related it to me; but they are both Dead, and cannot bear Witness with me, to
what was spoken there.

He was too forward in spreading False Reports abroad; as witness that Letter,
that he wrote to one of his Friends at London, (about the year 1660)
Scandalizing W. B. with committing Adultery with Horred Garner: Which when W.
B.'s wife heard thereof, she wrote to her Husband about it; and he read it in
the Meeting at Providence. And as soon as I had heard it read, I desired a
Woman Friend to go along with me to his House (who is now out of the Body:) And
I asked him, Why he wrote to London, that W. B. had Committed Adultery with
Horred Garner? And I told him, I verily believed, that he was as Innocent of
any such Act, as a Child of a Year old. To which he Answered, He believed so
too; and added this to Confirm his former Speech. That the Man, he believed,
was an Honest Man. Then I replied upon him again: If thou believe, that he is
an Honest Man, how comes it to pass, that thou have wrote such a Report of him?
To which he Answered: It was so Reported at Rode-Island by others; and he had
writ no more, than what others had Repor^ed. [Now let the Sober judge of this
Man!]

One particular more I shall mention, which I find written in his Book ( page
7.) concerning an Answer to John Throckmorton in this manner: To which (says
he) I will not Answer, as George Fox Answered Henry Wright's Paper with a
scornful and shameful Silence -- I am a Witness for George Fox, that I Received
his Answer to it, and delivered it into Yet R. W. has published this Lie.
Henry Wright's own hands: So that to his former Lie he has added another
scornful and shameful Lie; And then concludes, That they were his Witnesses,
that he had long said with David (and he humbly hoped, he should make it good)
that he hates and abhors Lying.

Providence in New England. Richard Scot.

SOME TESTIMONIES of Ancient and Modern Authors concerning the LIGHT,
SCRIPTURES, RULE and the SOUL of Man.
Testimonies concerning the LIGHT within.
MVnsterus, Castalio, Vatablus, Drusius, Clarius, Codurus ( upon Job 24, 13,
and Chap. 25, 3. They ^re of those, who rebel against the Light; Upon whom does
not his Light arise?) say; That this Light is of the Divine Wisdom and Fountain
of Light: Alluding to the Psalmist, (...): and Mat. 4, 19. The People that sat
in Darkness, saw great Light. Also see Erasmus and Camerar. upon Ioh. 1, 4, 9.

Orpheus: His Hand reaches to the end of the Sea, his right Hand is every
where ( then within:) Of him alone are all things. Gentiles Testimonies.
(Clem. Alexandr. Strom lib. 5.)

Thales thus: There is but one God, he is Glorious forever; he knows Hearts and
tells Thoughts. He makes the Teller of his Thoughts God ( as in Amos 4.13.)

Pythagoras thus: GOD resembles Light and Truth; he is One: He is not out of
the World, he is the Salt of all Ages: ONE HEAVENLY LIGHT and Father of all
things; only Wise: Invisible, yet Intelligible, ( Jambl. Just. Mart.)

Heraclitus thus; God is not made with Hands.

Pythagoras; What things are agreeable to God, cannot be known, unless a man
HEAR GOD himself.

Again: Having overcome thy rebellious Appetites, thou shall know the
Cohabitation of the Immortal God and mortal Men; whose work is Immortality,
Eternal Life. ( Trin. de Anima Mundi.)

Sophocles speaking of the Precepts written in Man's Heart: says, God is their
Father, not Mortal Nature; neither shall they ever be abrogated: for there is
in them a great God, that never waxes old. Again (says he) This is with
respect to Man's Conscience a Divine, a Sacred Good: God the Overseer. ( Oedip.
Tyr. Clem. Alex. Str. l. 5.)

Socrates had the Guide of his Life within him, and preached, as he was moved
by it, even in the Streets; and died for reproving the Corruptions of the
Athenians in Manners and Religion.

Plotin taught, That Man had a Divine Principle in him, which makes a True and
Good Man.

Hierom called it a Domestic God.

The Good ( said Socrates) shall be united to God in an In accessible place;
the Wicked in convenient places suffer due Puni^^ment.

Justin. Martyr in his Apology says; God has built to himself a natural
Temple in the Consciences of Men. Testimonies of the Fathers.


Clem. Alex. ( Admon. ad Gent.) It is the Voice of Truth, that Light will shine
out of Darkness: Therefore does it shine in the Hidden Part of Mankind.

Strom. (l. 5.) Man cannot be void of Divine Knowledge, who naturally partakes
of Divine Inspirations.

Lactan. (de Cult. Ver.) The Law of God is made known to us: The Law is pure
and unspotted Reason, diffused through all the World.

Athanasius (contr. gent.) The way to attain to the knowledge of God is within
us; which is proved from Moses, who says: The Word of God is within thy heart;
and from this Saying of Christ, The Faith and Kingdom of God is within you.

Minutius Felix says: God is every where not only very near us, but infused.
As is observed by Grotius, (Crit. Tom. 7. on Acts 17, 27.)

Testimonies concerning the SCRIPTURES.
LVther taught, That the Spirit is required to the understanding of the whole
Scripture, and of every part thereof. Again, The Scriptures are not to be
understood, but by that very Spirit, by which they were wrote. (Tom. 3. fol.
169.)

John Bradford thus answered the Archbishop of York; We do believe and know
the Scriptures, as Christ's Sheep: not because the Church says, they are the
Scriptures; but because they be so, being thereof assured by the same Spirit,
that wrote and spoke them. ( Book of Mart. Vol. 3. p. 298.)

W. Tindal, ( a faithful Martyr in Hen. 8. his time) writes thus; It is
impossible to understand the Scriptures more then a Turk, for him that has not
the Law of God written in his Heart to fulfill it. Again, Without the Spirit it
is impossible to understand them. ( W. Tindal's Works p. 319 and p. 80.)

B. Jewel against the Papists has this Passage: Flesh and Blood is not able to
understand the Holy Will of God without special Revelation: therefore Christ
gave Thanks to his Father, and likewise opened the Hearts of his Disciples,
that they might understand the Scriptures. Without this special Help and
Prompting of God's holy Spirit the Scriptures are unto the Reader (be he never
so Wise or well- Learned) as the Vision of a Sealed Book.

Calvin says, It is necessary, that the same Spirit, that spoke by the Mouth
of the Prophets, should pierce into our Hearts, to persuade us of the Truth, of
what they delivered. ( Instit. lib. 1. cap. 8.)

Beza says, That the understanding of the Scriptures should be fetched from
the same Spirit, that dictated them. ( Beza in Nov. Test. 2 Pet. 1.19.)

Peter Martyr taught, That the Spirit is the Arbiter, by whom we must assure
our selves for understanding of the Scriptures; that thereby we must discern
between Christ's words, and a Stranger's. ( Quoting Christ's words, My Sheep
know my voice, and follow not a Stranger. And among other Scriptures he quot^s
these, The Spirit searches out the deep things of God -- The Comforter shall
declare all things, that I have said unto you -- The spiritual Unction shall
show you all things. ( Com. Loc. part. 1. page 6.)

Again, The Spirit of God reveals the truth in the holy Scriptures. (Com. loc:
p. 2. cap. 18.)

Again, ( in an Oration to the University of Strasburgh, concerning the
Scriptures he expresses himself thus:) The School of this Philosophy is
Heaven. Again, We must remember, that the Teacher hereof is the Holy Ghost.

Doct. Ames ( a Great Father of the Independents) upon 1 Ioh: 2. says: We
require no more; the Anointing of the holy Spirit does teach the fait^ful to
understand those things, which they received of the Apostles, there from to
understand those things, which are necessary to Salvation: for these things
those Believers had received of the Apostles. With more to the same purpose in
that Chapter (lib. 1. c. 5. These. 32. contr. Bellarm.)

H. Bullinger asserts ( in his 4 Decas, and 8. Sermon. dedicated to K. Edw. 6.)
That Men fetched the understanding of heavenly things and knowledge of the holy
Ghost from no where else, then from the same Spirit.

Doct. Owen says, The only public, Authentic and infallible Interpreter of
the Holy Scriptures is he, who is the Author of them; from the breathing of
whose Spirit it derives all its Verity Perspicuity and Authority ( Exerc.
2.7.9.)

T. C. ( an Ancient and Considerable Baptist) says: There is the Law and
Testimony in the Spirit, as well as in the Letter. The Law of God is in the
Heart, there it is written, and there it testifies the Truth of God: and if
any Man speak not according to this Rule, it is, because there is no Light or
Morning risen in him: ( see his Works page 249.)

Again, Others know no other Touchstone nor Trial, no other Light, by which
they judge of Truth, then Scripture: thus putting it in the room of the Spirit,
which is Light, and the greater Light. For they say, they cannot know Truth,
till they bring it to the Letter for Trial: thus making an Idol of the Letter,
setting it up in the ^oom of God. (Ibid: page 248.

Testimonies concerning the RULE.
IRenaeus (page 242, 384, 389): The Writing in the Heart is the Rule. Again, (l.
5. c. 8.) The Word gives his Spirit to All, to Some according to Condition.
And (l. 4. c. 30.) The Fathers being Justified by the Righteousness of the Law
of God in them, therefore had no need of Reproving Letters.

W. Perkins Works, (Vol. 3. page 220) The Light of Nature and Grace teaches,
To do as we would be done to. (Page 221.) It is the Fulfilling of the Law, the
Rule to Judge Scripture: That of God made the Rule, something in the
Conscience; Happy Times, if Men would follow it.

Bishop R. Sanderson, ( De Obligat. Conscientiae, p. 127.) says; A Rule of
Discerning without the Scripture, ( Regula discernendi extra Scripturam.)

T. Collier says; The Spirit of God, who is God, is the alone Rule of a
Christian, (Genesis Epist. to the Saints, Chap. 12.) The Spiritual Man Judges all
Things by the Rule of the Spirit, (ibid.) The Law of the New Testament is
Written in the Heart, (ibid.)

Testimonies concerning the SOUL.
TErtullian ( De Anima* page 297.) Asserts the Immortality and Divinity of the
SOUL.

D. Fagius ( in Genesis 2.7.) Rabbi Nehamanides has observed; That he, that
Breaths on any, contributes something of his own to it: whence Christ our
Savior, when he would Communicate his Holy Spirit to his Disciples, he did it
by Breathing upon them; signifying, that he contributed to them something of
his own, that was Divine. The Word (...) signifies something Divine and
Heavenly, something (...) because the Immortal Soul of Man is a certain Divine
Thing.

Peter Martyr speaks of the Soul thus ( in Psalm. 94:) We are Taught not to
withdraw from the Divine Nature those Things, that are Perfect and Absolute in
us, (page 12.) And page (122.) They say (says he) (...) (the Soul) does
chiefly signify that which is Divine and Reasonable, which God does give unto
us.

H. Bullinger says; The Soul is a Spiritual Substance, poured of God into Man
's Body, ( in his 4. Decas. 10. Sermon.)

Augustine says; It is felt in the Life, it is Unutterable; Breathed into Man
's Body from the Secret Power of God.

[Henry Ainsworth ( Annot. in Pentateuch.) brings the Rabbines saying; The Form
of the Soul (of Man) is not Compounded of the Elements, etc. but is of the Lord
from Heaven: Therefore when the Material Body, which is Compounded of the
Elements, is separated, and the Breath perishes, (because it is not found but
with the Body, and is needful for the Body in all the Actions thereof) this
(Essential) Form is not destroyed, etc; but continues even for ever and ever.
This is that, which Solomon by his Wisdom said; And Dust shall Return unto the
Earth, as it was, and the Spirit shall Return unto God, who gave it.]

Id. ( in Genesis 2, 7.) The Lord Animated or Inspired him with a Living and
Reasonable Soul or Spirit, which presently appeared by Breath at his Nostrils:
For the Soul of Man is not educed, derived or fetched out of any Power in the
Matter of the Body, nor made of any Matter at all, as the Body is; but as it is
a Spirit, Material and Immortal, so it had its Immediate Original from the
Father of Spirits. (Hebr. 12, 9.)

Walter Rawleigh 's (Hist. of the World, page 18.) Man is said to be after the
Image of God, in respect of his Immortal Soul only; because as God is
Invisible, so the Soul of Man is Invisible; as God is Immortal and Incorporcal,
so is the Soul of Man Immortal and Incorporcal; and as there is but one God,
which Governs the World, so but one Soul, which Governs the Body of Man:
and as God is Wholly in every Part of the World, so is the Soul of Man Wholly
in every Part of the Body.

Henry More (Philosophical Writings, page 37:) The Specific Nature of the Soul
of Man is an Immaterial Substance, endued with those two Eminent Properties of
Understanding, and Power of Moving Corporal Matters.

Peter Charron 's Wisdom (page 22): The Immortality of the Soul is a Thing
Universally received throughout the World (I mean, by an Outward Profession;
seriously and Inwardly not so: witness so many Epicures, Libertines and Mockers
in the World.)

John Smith 's ( of Queen 's College in Cambridge) Discourses, (page 87): The
Soul of Man acting upon it self, and drawing forth its own Latent Energy, finds
it self able to tame the Outward Man, and bring under those Rebellious Motions,
that arise from the mere Animal Powers; and to tame and appease all those
Seditions and Mutinies, that it finds there.

(Ibid. p. 92.) There is a Naked Intuition of Eternal Truth in the Soul, which
is always the same, which never Rises nor Sets; but always Stands still in its
Vertical, and fills the Whole Horizon of the Soul with a Mild and Gentle Light:
There are such Calm and Serene Ideas of Truth, that shine only in Pacate Souls,
and cannot be discerned by any Troubled or Fluid Fancy.

Plotinus, (En. 4. l. 8. c. 1. page 99) The Soul of a Divine and Immortal
Being, etc.

(Id. Ibid.) When he shall behold his own Soul fixed in an Intelligible and Pure
Nature, Contemplating Things Eternal; -- looking into the Intellectual World,
being it self made all Lucid (to wit, Light) Intellectual and Shining with the
Sunbeams of Eternal Truth borrowed from the First Good, which perpetually
Rayeth forth his Truth upon all Intellectual Beings.

William Robertson, ( in his Key to the Hebr. Bible, sub. Lit. Nun: (...) and
(...) the Soul, a Noun Primitive, from which is derived the Verb in Piel (...)
Nippesh, he Breathed; because the Soul is the Principle of Life and Breath, etc.

Henry Moor 's Philosophical Writings of the Immortality of the Soul, (libr. 2.
cap. 1. page 58:) There is such an Immaterial Substance in Man, which from the
Power it is conceived to have in actuating and guiding the Body, is usually
called the SOUL.

(Id. Ibid. Cap. 3. page 72) No Essence in it self can vary its Modification.
-- For there is an Essence in us (whatever we will call it) which we find
endued with this Property, as appears from hence, that it has Variety of
Perceptions.

(Id. Ibid, Cap. 11. page 109:) The Soul is a Substance distinct from the Body,
and her very Essence is spread throughout all the Organs thereof.

Lactantius; The Soul, whereby we Live, comes as it were from Heaven, from God.
