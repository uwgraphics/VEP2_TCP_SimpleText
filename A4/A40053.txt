THE FOUR-LEGG'D QUAKER,
To the Tune of the DOG and Elder's MAID, Or, the LADY'S FALL.


ALl that have two or but one Ear,
(I date not tell ye half)
You of an Essex Colt shall hear
Will shame their very Calf.
In Horsley Fields near Colchester
A Quaker would turn Trooper;
He caught a Foal and mounted her
(O base!) below the Crupper.
Help, Lords and Commons, once more help,
O send us Knives and Diggers!
For if the Quakers be not gelt,
Your Troops will have the Staggers.
RALPH GREEN (it was this Varlet's name)
Of Colchester you will swear,
For thence the four-legg'd Elder came,
Was ever such a Pair!
But though 'twas soul 'tween Swash and Jane,
Yet this is ten times worse,
For then a Dog did play the Man,
But Man now played the Horse.
Help, etc.
The Owner of the Colt was nigh,
(Observing their Embrace)
And drawing nearer did epsy
The Quaker's sorrel Face:
My Foal is ravished (then he cries,
And fiercely at him ran)
Thou Rogue, I Will have thee halter'd twice,
As Horse and eke as Man!
Help, etc.
Ah Devil, do thou tremble? now
It Is sore against thy will;
For Mares and preaching Ladies know
Thou have a Colt's tooth still:
But mine is not guilty of this Fact,
She was by thee compelled;
Poor thing, whom no man ever Backed
Thou wickedly have Bellied.
Help, etc.
O Friend (said GREEN, with sighs and groans)
Let this thy wrath appease!
(And gave him then eight new half-Crowns
To make him hold his peace)
The man replied, though I for this
Conceal thy Hugger Mugger,
Do think it lawful for a Piece
A Filly Foal to Bugger?
Help, etc.
The Master saw his Colt defiled,
Which vexed his soul with doubt;
For if his Filly proved with Child
He knew All would come out:
Then he afresh began to rave,
(For all his Money-taking)
Neighbors, said he, I took this Knave
In The very Act of Quaking!
Help, Lords and Commons, once more help,
O send us Knives and Daggers!
For if the Quakers be not gelt,
Your Troops will have the Staggers.
Then to the Pinfold (Gaol I mean)
They dragged him by the Mane,
They called him Beast, and called her Queen;
As if she had been Jane.
O stone him (all the Women cried)
Nay Geld him (which is worse)
Who scorned us all and took a Bride
That Is Daughter to a Horse!
Help, etc.
The Colt was silent all this while,
And therefore 'twas no Rape,
The virgin Foal he did beguile,
And so intends to escape:
For though he got her in a Ditch
Where she could not revolt,
Yet he had no Scot'sh Spurr nor Switch
To ride the willing Colt.
Help, etc.
O Essex, Essex, England's pride,
Go burn this long-tayl'd Queen,
For though the Thames runs by thy side,
It cannot wash thee clean!
It Is not thy Bleating Sonn's complaints
Hold forth such wanton courses,
Thy Oysters hint the very Saints
Thy horn the very Horses.
Help, etc.
Though they salute not in the Street
(Because they are our Masters)
It Is now revealed why Quakers meet
In Meadows, Woods, and Pastures.
But Hors-men, Mare-men, all and some
Who Man and Beast perplex,
Not only from East- Horsley come,
But from West-Middle-Sex.
Help, etc.
Alas you know by Man's flesh came
The Foul disease to Naples,
And now we fear the very same
Is broke into our Stables;
For death has stolen so many Steeds
From Prince and Peer and Carrier,
That this new Murrain rather need's
A Physician to the Earl of Pembroke, who is no Quaker nor Quacker.
FARRAR than a Farrier.
Help, etc.
Nay if this GREEN within the Walls
Of Colchester left forces,
Those Cavalliers were Caniballs,
Eating his humane Horses!
But some make Man their second course,
(In cool Blood will not spare)
Who butcher Men and favor Horse
Will couple with a Mare.
Help, etc.
This Centaur, unquoth Other thing,
Will make a dreadful Breach:
Yet though an Ass may Speak or A new Sect of young Men and Women who pray,
eat, and sing ex tempore.
Sing,
O let not Horses Preach!
But Bridle such wild Colts who can
When they will obey no Summons,
For things begot 'tween Mare and Man
Are neither Lords nor Commons.
Help, etc.
O Elders, Independents too,
Though all your Power's combined,
Quakers will grow to strong for you
Now Horse and Man are joined:
While Cavelliers, poor foolish Rogues,
Know only Maids Affairs,
Shee-Presbyters can deal with Dogs,
And Quaking Men with Mares.
Help, etc.
Now as when Milan Town was reared,
A Monstrous Sow untamed
With back half Hair half Wool appeared,
'Twas Mediolanum named:
So Colchester must have recourse
To some such four-legg'd Sister,
For sure as Horsley comes from Horse
From Colt 'twas called Col-chester.
Help, Lords and Commons, once more help,
O send us Knives and Daggers!
For if the Quakers be not gelt,
Your Troops will have the Staggers.
