THE Epistle Dedicatory.
To the Sheep and Lambs of Christ, Meeting at Curriers-Hall, Lonon; over whom I
am an Unworthy under- Shepherd; and to the Subscribers of this small Piece.
Much Endeared and entirely Beloved,
IT is necessary I say something upon this occasion, though not much, for a long
Epistle will not become this short Tract; and Dedications of late Years have
been much abused to a vain Flattery, though of Ancient Use, and may be of no
small Profit; and seeing we find this Custom approved by the practice of one of
the Penmen of Holy Writ, St. Luke, in his Gosepl, and the Acts, it is less to
be disparaged: And I am the more encouraged. -- I have three Reasons for the
publishing of these Hymns, besides your Importunity; viz.

1. That by a frequent perusal of them you may be helped to recover the
Fragments of diverse Discourses which have slipped your Memory, and so be of no
small use to you in your retired Meditations on Divine things. 2. That you may
have such Hymns and Spiritual Songs by you for your public use in your
Families, that are most agreeable to your Principles, and nearest your
Affections; containing also variety of Matter. 3. For the better and more
orderly performance of this part of divine Worship in the public Assembly; for
by premeditation you will be capable conjointly to sing with more Judgment and
Understanding, and make the sweeter Harmony in the Ears of the God of Order.
I have not used (neither do I pretend to) Rhetorical Flourishes, and Gilded
Flights, but have accommodated my self to your Temper and Capacity, even the
meanest and weakest among you; and it is observable, that the profoundest
Prophets accommodated themselves to their Hearers or Readers Capacities; as of
Fishes to the Egyptians, droves of Cattle to the Arabians; Trade and Traffic
to the Tyrians: So our dear Redeemer tells his Fishermen, That they shall be
Fishers of Men; and after he had expressed himself in plain Parables to the
People; (as if the Essential Word had been at a loss for a fit Word, familiar,
plain, and low enough for our dull and shallow Apprehensions) Whereunto (says
he) shall we liken the Kingdom of Heaven, etc. And the Evangelists, for their
Hearers sakes, spoke Vulgarly many times. Beloved, many among us tip their
Tongues, and store their Heads, some for show, and some for delight; but
Ministers, above all men, have their Talents in trust, that therewith they may
save themselves and those that hear them; they must condescend to the
Capacities of their Hearers, and stoop to the Apprehensions of the meanest; and
become all things to all Men, in St. Paul's Sense, that they may win some:
'Twas a saying of a Learned Bishop, Lord! send me Learning enough, that I may
Preach plain enough. And if I had used a higher Style, it may be many of you
could not have sung with that Understanding that is required: A plain Preacher
and Author suits best a plain Hearer and Reader; and I designed these Hymns
only for your Use, not for any others, either Learned or Unlearned; and if you
kindly accept and make use of them, I have attained my End: And as for Carpers
and Censurers, I value them at the same rate as they do this Piece.

I thought to have said something to the Argument of Singing, but Mr. Richard
Allen in his Book lately Published, called, An Essay to prove singing of PSALMS
with conjoined Voices a Christian Duty. Has cleared this blessed Truth so
effectually in a few Leaves, (unto which Book I refer such as want further
Satisfaction) that I cannot in the least degree pretend to Mend it, and
therefore shall not touch it, being also confined to too little room.

Brethren, the things contained in this Piece, will be far better understood
and spoken of in Heaven by the Glorious Noonday Divinity, in which the
immeadiately Illuminated Assembly do there Sing Jehovah's Praise, than by such
a stammering Tongue and scribbling Pen as mine, which does but mar them; there
we shall not only be of one Judgment in this point of Singing, but well-skill'd
and unanimous in the practice of it: Alas! I write my Lord's Praises but by
Moonlight; I cannot Praise him so much as by halves: The excelling Glory of
Christ dazzles all Apprehensions, swallows up all Expressions; he is altogether
Love and Lovely: What Tongue belonging to a renewed Person can be silent while
his Praises are tuning? When we have worn our Tongues to the stumps in
ascribing Praises to him, alas! we have done nothing when all is done.

But, to Conclude, I hope your Candor will overlook the Faults and Slips,
either of the Author's Pen, or the Printer's Press; and my hearty Prayer to
Jehovah is, that in the main it may tend to the Comfort and Profit of your
never-dying Souls; that you may be the better fitted and prepared to Sing his
Eternal Praise in the Mansions of Glory above, in the Company of glorious
Angels, the Seraphims and Cherubims of God: And the God of Peace, that brought
again from the Dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through
the blood of the Everlasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work, to
do his Will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through
Jesus Christ; to whom be Glory for ever, Amen.

I subscribe my self your most Affectionate, though Unworthy Servant for Christ's
sake, ELIAS KEACH.
From my Study in Blew-Anchor-Alley, Bunhill-Fields; on the 11th of the second
Month, 1696.

A Banqueting House Full of Spiritual Delights.
HYMN 1.
To be Sung at the Baptizing-Place.
1 THe Seraphims and Cherubims,
Angels and Saints above,
Sing to the Glori'us King of kings,
inflamed with divine Love:
2 Among the Trees of Pleasure they
with Gladness walk; and in
The Rivers of Delight, they may,
and do with Pleasure swim.
3 O! what Soul-charming Musick's there?
what sweet Melodious Songs?
O how Elivated they are?
innumerable throngs
4 Encompassed the bespangled Thrown
of our Sacred Bridegroom,
And there before his Feet fall down,
and his high Praises Tune.
5 O how they eecho forth his Praise;
and make the Heavens ring!
What Trophies of Honor they raise
to him? and how they Sing
6 And Warble forth their Heavenly Notes?
no Tongue can it express;
Neither can enter in our Thoughts,
their Joy and Happiness.
7 How gloriously are they bedecked
with Jewels? how they shine?
The richest Robes of the Female Sect,
were not, are not so fine
8 As theirs: How beautiful they are?
how charming are their Smiles?
And the least thing cannot enter there,
which pollutes and defiles.
9 What pleasant looks the Lord does give
to his Darlings above?
With what content and joy they Live,
in his Eternal Love?
10 O who would not but long to be
in that most Glori'us Place!
That so they may these Creatures see,
and their dear Jesus Face.
11 Christ from these Heavens does look down
to see his Spouse below:
To him each of his Saints are known,
our Names he well does know.
12 Their Persons and their Trials too,
are well known unto him;
Those Sinners which him come unto,
he Pardons all their Sin.
13 Those who his holy Will obey,
and dare not to neglect
The least Command; who on him stay
he ever will protect.
14 He Is come to visit our poor Souls,
his smiles they do us Charm;
And whosoever on him rouls
shall never come to Harm.
15 Both Young, and Old, he does receive,
and in his Bosom lay;
The worst of Sinners, who Believe,
he will conduct in his way.
HYMN 2.
To be Sung at the Sacrament.
1 BEhold! (says Christ) look up, and see
Your bleeding Dying Lord; O look!
Come hither, view me on the Tree!
And by my dear Father forsook.
2 Behold my Wounds! Darlings, it is I?
See here my bleeding Hands and Feet?
Draw near unto Mount Calvary,
And at the Cross your Savior greet.
3 See how I Hang? behold a sight
Enough to pierce a Rocky Heart!
In your Salvation I delight,
And therefore with my Life do part.
4 I left my August Thrown above
To come and Die this shameful Death;
'Twas no less than Eternal Love
That brought me down upon the Earth;
5 According to my Father's Will
And Purpose, I am hither come,
His holy Pleasure to fulfill;
And now, behold, my Work is done!
6 His Wrath I bear, the Law I Have kept;
And here the deadly Draught I Drink;
In me there was, there is no defect,
Yet from his Justice I Will not shrink.
7 For you I Die, I breathe my last,
And bathed am in my own Blood,
That so your Souls may not be cast,
But obtain an Eternal Good.
8 What, is it Thee? thou Prince of Light,
Our Life, our Love, our Joy, our Friend,
Be thou our Eternal Delight,
And let our Praises never end!
9 What Love is this? what matchless Grace?
Unto us do thou manifest;
That thou should suffer this disgrace,
That we with Life might be possessed!
HYMN 3.
To be Sung at the Sacrament.
1 HOw Gloriously is Sion's King
Exalted on his August Thrown?
Sweet Songs to him the Angels sing,
And prostrate at his Feet fall down;
2 Whilst we on Earth display his Fame,
Who for us kept God's holy Law,
And Died for the breach of the same,
Though himself without spot or flaw.
3 When we for Sin condemned were,
By the impartial Decree
Of Divine Justice; O what care
Did Jesus take! our Souls to free
4 From infinite Eternal Wrath;
He laid his royal Robes aside,
And as a Servant came to the Earth,
His Father's Anger to abide.
5 O what a Mystery is this!
That God himself should clothed be
With Human Nature, that all his
From Death and Wrath he might set free:
6 When no other way found could be,
By infinite Wisdom and Skill,
Rather than we should Perish, he
His pure and precious Blood did spill.
7 O how dear were our Souls to him,
Though fallen by Iniquity,
He pitty'd us, when in our Sin,
And in our room and stead did Die.
8 A human Soul Christ Jesus takes,
And with our Flesh himself does cloathe,
And our Salvation undertakes,
When justly he our Souls might loathe.
9 Nay more, he makes our Case his own,
And on himself he takes our Sins;
And though the weight does press him down
He will endure our Sufferings.
10 He sweats great Drops of clodded Blood,
Suffers himself to be betrayed
By his false Servant; for our Good,
In Purple Robes he is arrayed.
11 Thus a Fool's Garment Jesus wore,
And a Mock Scepter in his Hand;
His Head, with Thorns, is Crowned and Tore,
Encompassed round with a strong Band
12 Of Armed Enemies; and they
Cry out, to Pilate, Crucify
This Impostor out of the Way;
Save Barrabas, let Jesus Die.
13 How grievously do they disgrace
Their only Lord and Savior;
Him they Blindfold, Spit on his Face,
And seem as though they would Devour;
14 With Mocks and Taunts him they do urge,
But, like a Lamb, silent is he,
Whilst Pilate his Body does Scourge,
And to his Death they all agree.
15 His Countenance already marred,
And that more than any beside,
His Body too dreadfully scarr'd
With Wounds and Bruises very wide:
16 But their Malice is not yet spent,
On his blessed Back they lay his Cross,
To slay him they are fully bent;
And to it Jesus Nailed was:
17 His Arms, his Legs, they stretched are,
And fastened are his Feet and Hands,
He Is lifted up into the Air,
On the Earth his Cross fixed stands.
18 And now behold, your dying Lord,
Into his side the Spear is run!
And forth his Blood gusheth abroad;
O see! See what your sins have done.
19 O nearest, dearest, dying Friend,
Risen and Ascended again,
Thou dearly Lov'dst us to the end,
Our Love, for our sins thou wast slain.
20 Hallelujahs, Eternal Praise,
Unto our loving Lovely King;
Thy dying Fame fain would we Raise,
And to thy Name more Honor bring!
HYMN 4.
To be Sung at the Sacrament.
1 THe most holy Anointed One,
born of a Virgin Poor;
Of David's Race is come, and gone,
and again at the Door.
2 A life of Sorrow did he Live
for his beloved Spouse;
And for* her Sin his Life did give,
because he had her chose
3 Before all time to be his Bride,
on her he set his Heart,
It Was her Eternal Good he Eyed,
even when he did Part
4 With his most glorious Royalty,
which he enjoyed above;
To be clothed with Humanity
O! 'twas Eternal Love
5 Which moved him thus to descend
from his Palace on high;
He had engaged to be her Friend
from all Eternity.
6 Therefore on her behalf he came,
perfectly to fulfill
The holy Law, and kept the same
according to God's will.
7 On her behalf he undertook
God's dreadful Wrath to bear,
A while by Mercy was forsook,
whilst Justice took his share;
8 That from Wrath she might be set free,
he endured her shame;
And for her made a Curse, was he,
to clear her of the same
9 What matchless, boundless, Love is this?
there is none to Parrallel
The same! O no Love like to his!
it does so far excel,
10 That it is beyond all express'on,
uttered it cannot be!
By finites it cannot be known;
Angels but in part see:
11 Infinite Love's out of our sight,
yet do we it believe
It does our souls greatly delight,
though it we cannot conceive.
12 This glorious Jem of Light was led
as a Malefactor;
Thrust forward, Spit on, Buffetted,
and brought unto the Bar
13 Of sinful dust, there to be Tried,
as though he Guilty were,
Favor unto him is denied,
though faultless and most clear.
14 'Twas for our Sakes, our sins were laid
on him, he bore our blame;
All we, like Lost Sheep, from him strayed,
and he to Save us came.
15 He Is Masked, Smitten, and Scourged is he,
the Jews Cry, Crucify,
Crucify him? fain would we see
him gasp for Life, and Die!
16 He bears his Cross, to it he is Naild,
innocent Legs and Arms
Are stretched wide, his Spirits faild,
whilst Enemies by swarms
17 Encompass the most cursed Tree,
on which Dear Jesus hangs;
A piercing sight it is to see
our Savior with Death's Pangs!
18 The Spear is ran into his Side,
and out the Blood does spring:
Thus for us our Dear Jesus died,
as a Peace Offering
19 To expiate Sin, and appease
the Wrath of God, that so
He might procure our lasting Ease;
this did Christ undergo.
20 Eternal Praises to thy Name,
O thou, our dearest Friend!
Help us to spread abroad thy Fame,
and Love Thee to the End.
HYMN 5.
The Saints have no cause of servvile fear.
1 WIth what sweet Spiced Wines, O Lord,
Our drooping Spirits thou do cheer
What Cordial, do thou afford?
Thy darlings have no cause to fear.
2 A rich Banquet thou do provide,
For thy Saints, to thee they are dear,
Though sometim^s thy face thou do hide,
Thy Darlings have no cause to fear.
3 Thou Lead'st us into Shady Groves,
And show thy self unto us there,
Where we are Sollac'd with thy Loves,
Thy Darlings have no cause to fear.
4 In pleasant Pastures Fresh and Green,
By Water streams, both Sweet and Clear,
Thy Purchased Flocks, Feed and are Seen,
Thy Darlings have no cause to fear.
5 Thou art our Bridegroom, to thy Bride,
With Smiles not Frowns thou do appear;
And by the Arm thou do her guide;
Thy Darlings have no cause to fear.
6 Like to a Queen Arrayed is she,
And with thy Beauty, fair, and clear,
She Shines, in her no Spot do see
Thy Darlings have no cause to fear.
7 To thee, with a Shrill Voice, she will Sing,
Thou art her Joy, her Love, her Dear,
Her Souls delight, her Lord, her King;
Thy Darlings have no cause to fear!
HYMN 6.
To spread abroad the Fame of God is the Saints Duty.
1 JEhovah take the Praise
Which is due to thy Name;
Help us thy Majesty to Please,
And spread abroad thy Fame.
2 Our Persons thou have chose,
To Save us thy Son came;
Let us savingly with him close,
And spread abroad thy Fame.
3 His Righteousness does hide
Our Nakedness and Shame;
To tune his Praise, Lord, our Tongues guide,
And spread abroad thy Fame.
4 Thy Divine Grace infuse,
Our Affections inflame;
Thy Statutes and Judgments let us choose,
And spread abroad thy Fame.
5 Thy pure Image restore,
At thy Glory let us aim;
Thy Holiness, O let us adore!
And spread abroad thy Fame.
6 Newborn, Lord, let us be,
And not remain the same;
We are, by Nature, but like Thee;
And spread abroad thy Fame.
HYMN 7.
Hope the Anchor of the Soul.
1 COme let us sing Jehovah's Praise,
His Grace and Love let us display;
With Joy let us keep on in his Ways,
And never cast our Hope away.
2 Hope is the Anchor of the Soul,
On Christ each of us Anchor may,
With one consent let us on him roll,
And never cast our Hope away.
3 If on Duties we lay our stress,
We lean upon a rotten stay,
Let Us rely on Christ's Righteousness,
And never cast our Hope away.
4 Although, through great difficulty,
We do our Work, let us keep our Way;
Let Us on Christ's Power still rely,
And never cast our Hope away.
5 Lord, though we want Assurance we,
Our Confidence would on the lay;
Discouraged let us not be,
And never cast our Hope away.
6 The event of Duty let us leave
To thee, O Lord, trust thee we may;
Let Us trust thee, who can not deceive,
And never cast our Hope away.
7 Unto the Sacred Three in One
Let Us sing, and so conclude the Day;
Joying in him, let us go home,
And never cast our Hope away.
HYMN 8.
Divine help the cause of Saints Perseverance.
1 GLory to God, whose Grace does shine,
His comforts are the same, although
Men and Devils, against us combine,
He Will help us in his Paths to go.
2 Though Saints slip, he will raise them again,
Reprobates his Love shall not know,
Though they their will shall not obtain,
He Will help us in his Paths to go.
3 Let Sion's Children praise the Lord,
Who does his Bowels, and Love show,
And Answers to our Prayers afford;
And help us in his Paths to go.
4 Our work is great, but though it be,
Though Christ's above, his Arm's below;
When we no Favourer can see
He Will help us in his Paths to go.
5 We'ave cause to sing, no cause to fear,
What the worst of Christ's foes can do;
When we are at a pinch he will appear,
And help us in his Paths to go.
6 Let Hell's Powers do what they may,
Their Abettors now bend their Bow,
Their Venomed Arrows take their way,
He Will help us in his Paths to go.
7 Let Us strike up, make the Heavens ring,
Great Blessings will our God bestow,
Christ Jesus, he is our Lord and King,
He Will help us in his Paths to go.
HYMN 9.
Saints have no cause to be Dejected.
1 DEarest, thy Smiles revive our Hearts,
Though we deserve thy Frown,
Tokens of Love, Lord, thou imparts,
Why should we be cast down?
2 Through Unbelief, against thee we'ave sinned
Yet do thou not disown
Us, but with Joy, our Souls are filled;
Why should we be cast down?
3 Thy Countenance most Pleasant is,
Oh! leave us not alone!
Such Shinings, O let us not miss!
Why should we be cast down?
4 By the Still Waters, lead us still;
The favor thou have shown,
With great Delight, our Souls does fill,
Why should we be cast down?
5 Tho Tempted, yet in thee we'll trust,
And look up to thy Throne,
Away our Souls thou will not thrust,
Why should we be cast down?
6 To thee we sing, thou art our King,
And still shall wear the Crown;
With thy Praise let the Heavens ring,
Why should we be cast down?
HYMN 10.
Divine Praise belongs only to God.
1 GLory and Praise belongs to Thee,
for the Good we have done;
Lord, by thee we enabled be;
The Praise is thine alone.
2 The only cause is, thy free Grace,
Strength of our own we have none;
Ourselves we desire to abase;
The Praise is thine alone.
3 We rob thee of thy Glory, when
We esteem it our own;
Vain-boasters, Lord, thou do contemn;
The Praise is thine alone.
4 As such dishonor thee, so they
Their own shame do make known;
O let us on thy Power stay!
The Praise is thine alone.
5 Thou art our God, our Guard, our Guide,
Lord, thee we roll upon;
Let thy Strength with us still abide;
The Praise is thine alone.
6 We sing thy Praise, because thou art
Our Strength, to thee we come;
O never from our Souls depart!
The Praise is thine alone.
HYMN 11.
Saints have no cause of discouragement in any Condition.
1 THou art a God of Grace and Love,
Unto thy People through thy Son,
Our Hope in thee, nothing should move,
In whatsoever Condition.
2 Many Discouragements we meet
With, while we are under the Sun,
Each bitter thing is mixed with sweet,
By Christ in every Condition.
3 A Praying Person never can be
Unhappy, Abroad or at Home;
True ground of Comfort may they see,
In whatsoever Condition.
4 The Saints Troubles are as a Cloud,
Which appears, but quickly is gone,
Christ carefully their Souls does shroud
In whatsoever Condition.
5 Glory and Honor Lasting Praise,
To him who Loves us as his Own,
Whose Promises our Souls should raise,
In whatsoever Condition.
6 The Love of Christ calls for our Love
Who has wrought our Salvation,
He does behold us from above,
In whatsoever Condition.
HYMN 12.
Saints have no cause to be Afraid.
1 SIng to the Lord, with Cheerful Voice,
Who with his comforts does us Cheer;
Let such who were Cast down, Rejoice,
For the Saints have no cause to fear.
2 Our former Comforts, should revive,
Though none at present do appear,
Let Us wait, not ride Post haste, or strive,
For the Saints have no cause to fear.
3 Lord, help us that we do not reach
After Comforts which are bought dear,
Let Us Joy in what thy word does teach,
For the Saints have no cause to fear.
4 Let Us roll on thy Son's Rightousness,
Exert Faith on our Savior dear;
O nothing should our Hearts Oppress!
For the Saints have no cause to fear.
5 Though God withdraws, he will turn again,
The Weathers foul, but 'twill be clear,
From Repining we should refrain,
For the Saints have no cause to fear.
6 With Divine truth, let us fill our Mind,
The Scriptures we should Read, and Hear,
Then Peace and Comfort shall we find,
And see no true reason to fear.
HYMN 13.
Saints in the Eternal Love of God.
1 STrike up and sing all you that are
Of the Spirit, Born from above;
In The Heart of God, you have a share,
And are in his Eternal Love.
2 Though Grace be small, you have no cause
To be like to the silly Dove
Without a Heart; God has you chose,
You are in his Eternal Love.
3 the Hand of Christ each of you are,
His Bowels unto you does move;
And of your Souls he will take care,
You are in his Eternal Love.
4 Although your Duties are lifeless,
In them your Hearts wander and rove,
God eyes you in Christ's Righteousness;
You are in his Eternal Love.
5 Lift up your Hearts, rouse up, and sing,
Make have out of this dismal Grove,
Says God, good News to you I bring,
You are in my Eternal Love.
6 O Lord thy Grace is very sweet,
Thy Spirit savingly has strove
With us, through Christ we do thee meet,
And taste of thy Eternal Love.
HYMN 14. Divine
Adoration performed through Divine Assistance.
1 HOw Gracious, Lord, art thou
To such Sinners as we?
The way to Life, thou do us show;
Help us to Adore Thee.
2 We must be Born again,
Else Heaven we cannot see;
Through Christ, thy Grace we may obtain,
Help us to Adore Thee.
3 O renew every Part!
And from sin, set us free;
Thou only, Lord, can change the Heart,
Help us to Adore Thee.
4 O take us by the hand!
Lead us to Christ, for he
Is the way to the Promised Land,
Help us to Adore Thee.
5 Thou art a Refuge to
All such who to the Flee,
Thou Wilt surely Save all those who do,
Help us to Adore Thee.
HYMN 15.
On God's Forbearance and Goodness.
1 t Sion's God have all the Praise,
there is no God like him,
Who though he sees all our ways,
and beholds every sin,
2 Renews his Mercies every day,
lengthens his Patience,
Sin has not yet drove him away,
he is not departed hence.
3 t still he waits, and strives, and treats,
with wretched Sinners, who
Value not in the least his threats,
but their own Wills will do.
4 He calls, he warns, draws out his sword,
but yet his Bowels yern,
Tho they despise, mock at his Word,
to'ards them he holds his Arm.
5 To help, relieve, and save their Souls,
yet still they do not mind,
In his own filth, the sinner rouls
and pursues the East Wind.
6 sing to him who still does call,
not willing to depart;
And at his feet, O Sinner fall,
and give him thy whole Heart.
HYMN 16,
Grace enables us to walk and abide in the ways of God.
1 SIng to the Lord with cheerful Voice,
Saints refuse not to Sing;
But in eternal Love rejoice,
O Bring your Thanks-Off'ring
2 Unto Jehovah, who does cheer
our Souls with his sweet Wine,
He Is not a God far off, but near;
each Saint may say he is mine.
3 My God, in Covenant, is he,
my Life, my Strength, my Guide,
He alone does enable me,
to walk in, and abide
4 In his blessed Ways of Truth and Peac,
yea, it is his Spirit who
Causes us, this our God to please,
his Holy Will to do.
5 Christ gives forth Grace, the Spirit bring
And puts it in our Hearts,
With all Spiritual, Blessings,
and from us never departs.
6 But helps us on, from strength to streng
until we do attain
The Haven of Glory at length,
and endless Joy obtain.
7 Where, with the Heavenly Quire, we
Eternally shall Sing
The Praises of our God, and see
the Face of Christ our King.
HYMN 17.
God only softens the Hard-Heart.
1 WIth Reverence we would draw near,
O Lord, thy Name to Praise,
And in thy Courts with Songs appear,
thy Fame and Honor raise.
2 The Heart of Stone is softened
by thy Power alone;
It Is thou that make us Ashamed,
and Grieve for what we'ave done.
3 We fear to Sin, because thy Grace
has changed our Stony-Heart;
We fear lest thou should hide thy Face,
and in Anger depart.
4 Conscience, by thee, is made Active,
to Comfort or Condemn;
Once sin in us did grow and thrive,
which now we do contemn.
5 No time could we at all afford,
in former Days, to View
And Search, and Hear thy Holy Word,
which now with Joy we do.
6 We would not Dishonor thy Name,
neither thy Spirit Grieve;
But strive to Magnify the same,
and not ourselves Deceive.
7 Thou daily do us Woo and Call,
not willing to depart;
Help us down at thy Feet to fall,
and take thou our whole Heart.
HYMN 18.
The Observation of God's Commandments a sign of a Tender Heart.
1 LEt Zion's God have all the Praise,
for it is his Right and Due;
Let each of us his Honor raise,
and his Pleasure pursue.
2 Each Precept of his let us observe,
with Diligence and Care;
If from his Truths we do not swerve,
then his Servants we are.
3 Yea then it will plainly appear,
we have a Tender Heart,
Our interest in his Son he will clear
to us, and show our part.
4 And then how Merry shall we be?
how will our Souls rejoice?
When our title to Christ we see,
and that we are Gods Choice.
5 Our Hearts will Leap for Joy, we shall
lift up our Voice, and Sing;
And Josus Christ, our Bridegroom, call
our Love, our Lord, our King:
6 Who Is now in Heaven, and to whom
ever long our Souls must go,
When this frail Life of our's is done
and Sorrow never more know.
HYMN 19.
On Pardon of Sin.
1 O Thou most gracious Majesty,
how should we thee Admire?
Who Pardon'st all Iniquity,
How should we thee desire?
2 By an act of the freest Grace,
thou take away our Guilt,
'Twas Christ's free Love, who in our place
was Slain, and his Blood spilt.
3 He'ath born all Punishment away,
freely our Souls to Save;
Freely to thee Sinners come may,
and each their Pardon have.
4 Then call, and draw, prevail, O Lord,
with all these Hearts of Stone,
That to thy Word, they may accord,
and for a Pardon come.
5 Then, not till then, with Joyfulness,
will they adore thy Grace,
Their thankfulness they cannot express,
till they see thy Christ's Face:
6 But when once they dear Jesus see,
they will own him for their King,
Their Hearts will leap and Joyful be,
their Tongue thy Praise will sing.
HYMN 20.
God's Patience exercised toward Hard-Hearted Sinners.
1 HOw great, how many are our Sins?
What an Evil is an hard Heart?
What dreadful Judgments the Lord brings
On such that from his Law depart?
2 And yet, what Patience has the Lord
On such? yea, how Gracious is he?
What Mercies does he them afford,
Who exceedingly hardened be?
3 O! all ye Hardened Sinners, come
And hear the blessed Word of Grace?
Pray that the Evils you have done
May Pardoned be; sad is your Case!
4 Quench not the Spirit; O! take heed,
By Sin, you send him not away;
But see that you cherish and feed
His holy Motions every Day.
5 O! look awhile on Jesus Christ,
Whom thou have pierced by thy sin,
See from him thou be not enticed,
But with all thy Heart close with him.
6 Get a true sight of sin, and then
Of thy self thou wilt think otherwise
Then heretofore thoust done; yea, when
Thou see this, thou will despise,
7 And loathe, and hate thy self with shame,
Thou will seek out for Counsel; (O!
My sins they have been my Soul's bane:)
Sirs; What shall a poor Sinner do?
8 Counsel and Comfort then will come,
And not till then; with joy you will sing
Christ's Praise, for what for you he'ath done,
And own and love him as your King.
HYMN 21.

that causes thee to turn
Thy Face from us, it is this makebate
that makes our Souls to Mourn.
3 Nothing, O Lord, does mar our Peace,
so much as inbred Sin;
Nor there were none could give us Ease
but Christ, by Suffering.
4 All Glory, Glory unto him
who sent his only Son
To Save us from mischievous Sin,
which had our Souls undone.

HYMN 32.
On Divine Mercy.
1 THe Lord Jehovah dwells on high,
yet does he himself bow,
To look ^'t'h Earth, and does espy
what ever is done below.
2 All things before him Naked are,
he sees each secret Place;
No secret Sin but it is bare
and open to his Face.
3 Yet he would not have Sinners Dye,
and Perish in their Sin;
But first of all he does draw nigh
and bid them turn to him.
4 Pardoning Grace he gives to them
that lay hold on his Son;
For sin he will not him Condemn
that does to Jesus come.
5 Faith, Repentance, Lord, do thou give
to Sinners, otherwise
A Godly Life they will not Live,
but still thy Word despise:
6 But if thy Grace thou do impart,
a Change will soon appear;
Such then will Praise thee with their Heart,
and by thy Word will steer.
HYMN 33.
God a good Master.
1 O! what Encouragements have we
to Walk in thy blessed Ways?
O! who would not, Lord, Worship Thee,
and Serve thee all their Days?
2 A better Master we cannot serve,
for Power, Dignity,
From thy Service let us never swerve
to our Iniquity.
3 Our Time's but short; O! let us keep
thy Way, which is the best,
Until by Death we fall Asleep,
and sweetly take our Rest.
4 Give Repentance, that Sinners may
forsake the Ways of Sin,
Direct them, Lord, into thy Way,
help them to walk therein;
5 And remove every Objection
which against it they make,
That they may seek Salvation
before it be too late.
6 Do this, and then they will Rejoice,
and sing thy Praises forth,
They Will Praise thee with both Heart and Voice,
who'rt God over all the Earth.
HYMN 34.
Saints afraid to Sin.
1 QUick Apprehensions have all those,
who an Heart of Flesh have,
And they are such whom God has chose,
such whom he will surely Save.
2 They soon perceive a Threat, a Frown,
the hidings of God's Face;
And when perceived they soon fall down,
and seek unto his Grace.
3 Small Trespasses cause such to Grieve,
and Wound their very Souls,
They run to Christ and to him cleave,
on his Obedience rowls.
4 When God Commands, they instantly
yield up themselves to him,
And with his Holy Will comply,
turn from and leave their Sin:
5 They dare not Act unless they have
Authority from God;
They Mourn for Sin, and Pardon Crave,
at the sight of the Rod.
6 A tender Heart, O Lord, us give,
an Heart of Flesh, that so
Unto thy Glory we may live,
and in thy Statutes go.
7 Thy Name with Joy then shall we Praise,
and in Hymns to thee sing;
Thy Fame and Honor we shall raise,
who art our Lord and King.
HYMN 35.
On the Sacrament of the Supper.
1 O! what Varieties are here
prepared by our Lord?
O! what rich Wines, what dainty Cheer
does he our Souls afford?
2 His Blood, his Flesh, Himself he gave
to Drink, to Feed upon.
He parts with all our Souls to save,
which by Sin were undone.
3 Our Love, our Bridegroom, Jesus came
into the World, that he
Might take away our Guilt and Shame,
and from Wrath set us free.
4 Praise Christ, the Lamb, all you that can
set your Seal to this Truth,
Ye Virgins all both Great and Small
praise him both Age and Youth.
5 Behold! and see Christ on the Tree,
with eye of Faith behold;
Rather than we should Cursed be
dear Jesus bare Sin would.
6 See in your stead how Christ does Bleed,
there is no Love like to this;
He Dies, and this does undergo,
to bring our Souls to Bliss.
7 Into his Side the spear does glide,
and forth the Blood does spring;
On the Cross spread while thus he bled;
look! is not this your King?
8 And can we see our dearest Lord,
thus made a Sacrifice
For Sin, and not a Tear afford,
what? see this with dry Eyes.
9 What Adamants, what Stony Hearts,
have we within our Breasts?
Our dearest Lord, with his Life parts,
and, what? our Hearts at Rest!
10 O! how can we be unconcerned
at such a Sight as this?
He Cries, and what? not we Allarum'd!
O! do we know who it is?
11 It is the Lord, God's only Son,
the most express Image
Of the brightness of his Person,
who for us did engage
12 With God from all Eternity,
most faithfully to Pay
Our grievous Debts, as our Surety,
and bear the Curse away.
12 Christ has bore all, therefore such shall
escape it certainly;
Even such who are in him shall share
of true Felicity.
14 O! let each Man that Loves the Lamb,
let Virgins every one
Exalt his Name, and spread his Fame,
and think on what he'ath done.
15 Lord tune our Hearts, that we may Sing,
our dull Affections raise,
That we may bring our Thank-Off'ring,
our Offerings of Praise.
16 Thou do us call to Glorify
thy sacred Name, and we
Desire the same to Magnify:
but, how backward we be?
17 O! Call us, Own us for thy Bride,
thy Spouse, yea, thy Delight;
Thy Countenance, O do not hide!
let us see thy Beauty bright!
18 That Charmed with thy Smiles and Love,
we may Adore thy Grace,
Then we shall not rest till above
we do behold thy Face.
HYMN 36.
On obedience to the Divine Law.
1 UNto the Lord our God let us sing,
his Fame O let us raise!
Come, let us bow down before our King,
who is Worthy of all Praise.
2 He made us, and he gives us Laws,
which we ought to observe,
Most readily his Spirit draws
each humble Soul, to serve
3 Him with due Reverence and Fear;
but after all is done
We must not think our good Works are
a Propitiation
4 For Sins, of which we are Guilty:
O! none can us release
From the Wrath due to us for sin;
but Christ he makes our Peace.
5 We must take heed we do not seek
ourselves in what we do;
Least, while we do pretend to keep
God's Law, we do undo
6 Our Souls; for the Lord Jesus Christ
will all the Glory have,
And such who this way are enticed
he surely will not Save.
7 Help us, Lord, that we never swerve
from what thou do require;
Thy holy Will let us observe,
and thy free Grace admire.
HYMN 37.
On the Gospel Message.
1 SIng to the Lord, display his Fame,
all Power's in his Hand,
Exalt his great and glorious Name,
for it is his Command;
2 He breaks the hardest stony Heart,
he bows the stubborn Soul;
He makes the sturdy Sinners quake,
and at his Feet to roll,
3 Who him dispis'd, and's Servants too
he causes out to Cry;
Sirs, What shall a poor Sinner do
for help? where shall I fly?
4 His Ministers by him are sent
to Comfort, and to Cheer
The troubled Sinner, who for sin
is filled with Grief and Fear.
5 They must direct such unto him
who Died, and shed his Blood
To wash away the Guilt of Sin,
and to purchase all Good.
6 Believe on Jesus Christ, and thou
from Wrath should be set free;
Unto his Royal Scepter bow,
and thou shall saved be.
7 This is the Message which they have
to bring to sinful Men,
It Is Christ, it is he only can save;
and Blessed are all them
8 Who rest upon his Righteousness
for Life, and Salvation;
Eternal Joy and Happiness
they will have for their Portion.
HYMN 38.
A new Heart have all in the Covenant.
1 GOD gives a New Heart unto those
whom he intends to Save;
All actually in Covenant
a renewed Spirit have.
2 Such have new Eyesight, they all see.
the state their Souls are in;
On Wings of Faith to Christ they flee,
to save them from their Sin.
3 They have new Fears, new Cares, new Cries,
new Hopes, and new Desires,
The renewed Soul he magnifies
free Grace, -- and much admires
4 The Love of God in Christ, his Son,
who came down from above
To save the Soul when 'twas undone:
'twas mere Pity that did move
5 The Eternal Son of God to take
to himself our Nature,
Our Salvation to undertake,
and in our stead endure
6 The Wrath which unto us was due;
'twas Love moved him to Dye,
And fully his Father's Will to do,
sinners to Justify.
7 O sing! let us sing with one consent
the Praise of Christ, our Lord,
To praise him let our Hearts be bent,
and that with one accord.
8 Ever long he will come, he will come to take
us into his Kingdom;
We shall Rejoice, his Foes will Quake;
come Quickly, Lord, O come!
HYMN 39.
Saints avoid Sin.
1 TO the most sacred Majesty
come bring your Songs of Praise,
His holy Name, O magnify,
and walk ye in his Ways.
2 With willing Minds most seriously
see you his Will obey;
With all his Royal Will comply,
take heed you do not stray
3 Out of his Paths, for such who are
in Covenant with him,
Make it their great Business and Care
to avoid the least Sin;
4 And in so doing such do find
much Comfort, Joy and Peace,
And a God Gracious and Kind,
none live so much at Ease;
5 Much spiritual Pleasure they
already do possess,
Their Consciences all the Day
are full of quietness.
6 And when Night comes they take their rest
under God's gracious Wing;
When others greatly are perplexed,
Gods Praise the Saint does sing.
HYMN 40.
On walking in God's Statutes.
1 THy Law is very Pure,
Thy Ways are Paths of Peace,
And that Soul, Lord, which cannot endure
Thy Word, is ill at Ease.
2 With Love and great Delight,
Joy and Alacrity,
We desire to walk in the Light
of thy Testimony.
3 With Reverential Fear,
With Zeal and Uprightness
Help us, O Lord, our Course to steer
In ways of Righteousness:
4 Because it is thy Will
Therefore we thee Obey,
Thy Pleasure it is we would fulfill,
O! let us not turn away
5 In the midst of Dangers great,
And trials manifold;
Let no Temptation us defeat,
Neither let Sin take hold
6 Of us -- to snare the Mind
Thy Praises then we'll sing,
To please thee we shall be inclined,
And that in every thing.
HYMN 41.
Christ's coming is near.
1 CHrist he is All, in All, to All,
that do in him Believe,
Their standing's firm, they shall not fall,
Christ will them never leave:
2 But they which trust to any thing
besides, -- in the end will find
Themselves deceived, and have nothing
to stay their troubled Mind.
3 Ye Saints, Admire, Adore your Lord,
see you his Honor raise;
Let every one of you accord
his Holy Name to Praise.
He Is Near at hand to Redeem you
from all your Enemies,
In few days you will part with all
your Sins and Maladies.
5 Your Bridegrooms Voice you will quickly hear,
his Chariot Wheels are nigh,
Look! does not his Day Star appear?
he will be here speedily.
6 Look out, prepare to meet your King,
who comes down from on high,
All you that trust on him shall sing
to all Eternity.
HYMN 42.
An Hymn Sung at the Funeral Sermon of Mr. Stephen Hall Preached Curriers Hall
on the 16th of Sept. 1694.
1 UNto his Home our Friend is gone:
we still are left behind
To feel our loss, and bear our Cross
according to Gods Mind.
2 Whilst he above, in the Arms of Love,
of Pleasure takes his fill;
His Pain is gone, his Ease is come,
want he never more will.
3 Of Griefs and Care he had his share,
whilst he did Sojourn here;
But being gone unto his Home,
Eternally he is Clear.
4 Affliction. he no more shall see,
Poverty no more know;
Of all such Cares he now is free,
which he met with below.
5 He'ath perfect Ease -- and is at Peace,
in Christ's Bosom does ly
In Joy and Bliss; -- O! now he is
to all Eternity.
6 Why should we Grieve? O! let us believe
that when Christ's Children be
By him made fit, to inherit
Eternal Life; then he
7 Away does take them to partake
of that Eternal Store
Which he has wrought, and for them bought;
they can desire no more.
8 Let each Soul raise his Voice, and Praise
the Name of God, for he
Give's time and space and offers Grace
both unto thee and me.
HYMN 43.
God disappoints his Peoples Enemies.
1 GOD is the Lord, Dominion
and Power's in his Hand;
His Will and Pleasure he has done,
all are at his Command.
2 Our Enemies, what can they do?
let them use all their Power,
Although they furiously pursue,
God can them soon devour.
3 Let them use all their Wit and Skill,
God's People to annoy;
God he will disappoint all, and will
each one of them destroy.
4 Though into many straits we fall,
God able is to Save,
And to bring us out of them all
he will raise us from the Grave.
5 The Lord is good, he intends good,
and will bring good on all,
(He Will Cherrish, Nourish, he will give Food,
his Loving Kindness shall
6 Encompass) them that do Believe,
and in his Goodness trust:
But such who sinfully deceive
themselves, away he will thrust.
7 O! let each Soul lift up his Voice,
and Hymn forth the Lord's Praise;
Ye People of the Lord, rejoice
in your God all your Days.
HYMN 44.
An Hymn Sung on a Thanksgiving-Day at Curriers-Hall.
1 LEt England sing Jehovah's Praise,
Our God and Savior -- for he
Does yet not fill us with our Ways
'Tho' exceeding sinful we be.
2 How justly might he, long ago,
Poured his fierce Wrath upon us?
And after our Hearts still we do,
And rather wax yet worse and worse.
3 Gospel Privileges abound,
And many Warnings he does give,
Yet in her sins England is found,
And unto God she does not live.
4 O! Lord, how great is thy Goodness?
Let it us to Repentance lead,
That so this Land thou might Bless;
In Sin no more let us proceed.
5 Unto thy Glorious Praise we sing,
For great is thy Salvation.
Which thou have showed unto our King,
Both while Abroad and coming Home:
6 And since he has come Home thou'ast said
From the danger of Sickness; and
The Mercies which of thee we craved,
Thou'ast freely poured on this Land.
7 Both King and Subjects do rejoice
In the rich Bounty of the Lord,
And we bless thee with Heart and Voice,
For what to us thou do afford.
HYMN 45.
On the Divine Spirit's Conduct.
1 TO the Spirit of Holiness,
come, O! come, let us sing,
He who reveals Christ's Righteousness,
who us to him does bring:
2 That through him access we might have
to the Father of Lights,
Who down from Heaven us has gave
sweet Comforts and Delights.
3 He who helps our Infirmities,
who teaches us to Pray,
And with incessant Fervent Cries
informs us what to say.
4 He who in us dwells and abides,
and never leave us will,
Although sometimes his Face he hides
he remains with us still,
5 To him let us sing, his Fame let us spread,
who our great Pilot is,
The Soul through Seas he'ath Pilotted,
and will Land safe in Bliss;
6 Where, with the Heavenly Quire, we
Halelujahs shall sing;
And there our Savior we shall see,
our Lord, our Love, our King.
HYMN 46.
An Hymn that was Sung at the Baptizing-place.
1 O! How Glorious art thou, O Lord?
thy Countenance is sweet;
Our Souls cannot be satisfied
until with thee we meet.
2 Each Ordinance is a dry Breast,
unless therein we find
Thy Presence, our Souls take no Rest,
thy Love runs in our Mind.
3 Thy undeserved Eternal Love;
O! this 'twas moved thee
To leave thy August Throne above,
our Souls from Death to free!
4 'Twas Love which moved thee to Dye,
and suffer in our stead;
How near our Hearts Lord should thou ly?
who for our sins did bleed.
5 In the Sepulcher thou wast laid,
when Crucified and Dead,
Though awhile by Death thou wast stayed,
yet quickly ascended
6 Above the reach of Enemies,
unto thy Father dear,
In whose most glorious Presence thou
for us do now appear.
7 Thy Praise, Lord Jesus, we would sing,
and desire that we may
Honor and Love thee as our King,
and thy Commands Obey.
8 Even those which are despised by Men,
and are contrary to
The ease of the Flesh, willingly them
we would obey and do.
9 Lord, without Partiality
the Laws we would Observe,
With thy whole Will we would comply,
and never from it swerve.
10 Great cause have we to do the same,
for then we know we shall
Appear before thee without shame,
thy Friends thou will us Call:
11 And in our Minds, O Lord, what Ease
at present do we find;
Very much Joy and inward Peace
have they which thy Law mind.
12 Thy People are thy Spouse, thy Bride,
in them thou do Delight,
In pleasant Paths thou do them guide,
in thy Light they see Light.
13 They see, they fear, they feel they taste
this Peace, thy Joy thy Love,
And an Eternal joy thou have
for each of them above.
14 What cause have they to joy in thee,
who do already find
Much Pleasure in thy Ways, and see
Eternal Bliss behind
15 Thou art our nearest, dearest Friend,
our Life, our Love, our Light,
With Joy let us serve thee to the End,
O thou our Souls Delight!
HYMN 47
The Saints are Christ's by Choice, his Fathers Donation, his own Purchase and
Conquest.
1 OUt of the world, Christ he has chose
A People, which he calls his own,
And they are such, who with him close,
And whom he never will disown:
2 They are all his by Donation
The Father gave them unto him,
He'ath undertook their Salvation,
And in his Blood washed them from Sin.
By Purchase they are his, he'ath Bought
Them all with his most Precious Blood;
He himself their Salvation wrought,
And for them Meritted all Good;
4 By Powerful Conquest they are his,
Sin, Death Devil; and Law by him
Are overcome, the Day is his,
And he subdues all Foes within.
5 They are his own, by Covenant
And that from all Eternity,
And not one Soul of them shall want
True and Lasting Felicity.
6 They Are his Jointure Inheritance
And unto him they have resigned
Themselves, and if they have but a glance
Of's Face, what Joy and Peace they find?
7 With Joyful Lips, O! then they Sing
Unto their dearest Lord, their Love,
Their Friend, their Bridgroom and their King,
And long to see his Face above.
HYMN 48.
A Hymn Sung at the Lords Supper.
1 THe Debt is paid, our Lord has Died,
Tho we have greatly Sinned
Yet he has Justice Satisfied
and the whole Law fullfill'd.
2 His Heart was Holy, his Life Pure,
yet our sins did he bear;
And in our stead the Curse endure;
that through him we might share.
3 Of Pardon, Peace, of I ife, and Light,
Grace and Glory also;
Those who Believe are his Delight,
For them thus did he do.
4 His Right'ousness imputed is
to all who in him Trust,
Their bodies he will bring to Bliss
after they are lain in Dust.
5 And when they Dye their Souls on high
Mounts up with Eagles Wings,
And there is Clothed with Majesty,
and among Angels Sings.
6 Among Golden Trees of Pleasures they
with great Joy walk; and in
Silver Streams of Delight they may,
and do with gladness swim.
7 The most Soul Charming Musick's there,
most sweet Melodious Song,
With Joy they Elivated are
in 'th midst the splended Throne.
8 Of Seraphims, and Cherubims,
sollac'd with Divine Love,
In the presence of the King of Kings;
no Joy like that above.
9 O! help us Lord? while here below,
to tune thy Praises forth,
Let us thy self Savingly know,
who'^^ God over all the Earth.
HYMN 49.
Christ the Saints Advocate: On our Deliverance from the late Horrid Conspiracy.
IN the Court of the Glorious King
of Kings; we have a Friend
Who for us Obtains each Blessing,
and will unto the End.
2 Hence it is we are preserved from ill,
and Grace in us secured,
He did to this end his Blood spill,
and thereby has procured
3 The Grace and Mercy which we have,
and whatsoever we need;
And in Distress God does us Save,
and our Foes don't succeed.
4 Sing to the, Lord, O Praise his Name,
who greatly does us cheer,
Let each Soul spread abroad his Fame,
who for us does appear,
5 When Devil, Pope, and the French KING,
and many more beside,
Would misery upon us bring,
Success is them denied.
6 By human Skill, they laid their Snare,
slyly, our Lives to catch
And were not in the least aware
that Christ was on his Watch.
7 While they design to Ruin his
our Lord laughed them to Scorn,
The Bulls of the Forest their prey miss
and soon pull in the Horn.
HYMN 50.
On the sad Condition of such who are destitute of the Divine Spirit.
1 SIng to the Lord with cheerful Voice,
Who does his Spirit to us give,
O! what cause have we to Rejoice?
Even all the time we have to live.
2 Sad is the case of such who are
Without this holy Spirit -- they
In the least measure have no share
In Christ, the Truth, the Life, the Way.
3 They Are Dead in Trespasses and Sins,
Ly under the Curse of the Law,
Have no right to Christ's Sufferings,
God them to Christ does never draw.
4 They Are Slaves to Satan, and are led
By the Spirit of Errors, and
By the Wicked Spirit Ruined,
Yet the same do not understand.
5 They Read, and Hear, and say their Prayers,
But nothing they the better are;
Although Church Members yet they are heirs
Of Death, and of Wrath shall they share.
6 Greatly, Lord, we thy Love admire,
Who giv'st us divine Life and Light:
Thy gracious Presence we desire,
And in thy Holy Word delight.
HYMN 51.
The Holy Spirit ought to have Divine Worship and Praise.
1 LEt such whose Eyes are Opened,
Gods free Grace to behold;
Such who are Regenerated,
who, by faith, have took hold
2 On Jesus Christ -- O! let such sing
to the Spirit high Praise;
Let them their Thank-Offering bring;
his Fame and Glory raise.
3 He their great Guide and Leader is
in the Paths of Truth and Peace,
Until he'ath brought them unto Bliss;
unto Eternal Ease.
4 Glory to Father and to the Son,
who does the Spirit send
To guide us safely to our Home,
as a most Cordial Friend.
5 Angels and Men well wonder may
at undeserved Grace,
That God should lead Rebels in the way
to Bliss, and them Embrace.
6 That God should (set his Heart upon
Sinners of a deep die)
By Sacrificing his own Son
their Persons Dignify.
HYMN 52.
Saints Militant rejoice at the views of the Joys of the Saints Triumphant.
1 HIgh Praises unto God let us sing,
the God of Power and Might.
Our Sacrifice of Thanks we bring
to thee, Lord, it is thy Right;
2 And thine only to thee belongs
Divine Worship alone;
Lord, thou have mighty Crowds and Throngs
of Angels round thy Throne,
3 Admiring and Adoring Thee,
most sacred Majesty;
With great Amazement there they see
in part thy bright Glory.
4 The Church Triumphant there above,
exalted by thy Son,
Taste the Fruits of Eternal Love;
each one has on his Crown
5 Of Endless Glory which does shine
far brighter than the Sun:
Lord, look on us, for we are thine,
though far distant from Home.
6 We trust thy Spirit will us guide
until we do ascend
The Mount of Joy -- let it abide
with us, Lord to the end.
HYMN 53.
On Pardon of Sin through Christ's Death.
1 GOD forgives Sin, yea, every sin,
to each believing Soul,
Most graciously he recieves him
who on Jesus does roll.
2 All such Men's sins imputed were
to Jesus on the Tree,
And by his Sufferings we are
from Punishment set free.
3 In our very room Christ did stand,
and bore the dreadful blow
Of Divine Wrath from the Lord's Hand,
to save us from that Woe.
4 So much Wrath as sin did deserve,
and as God's Law did threat;
Whatever Divine Justice did Crave
our Savior did complete.
5 Christ by his Blood has Purchased
pardon of every sin,
Which shall be fully possessed
by all Chosen in him.
6 Come sing, O sing, thy Praise we sing
who our Redeemer art,
We'd love and own thee for our King,
and never from thee depart.
HYMN 54.
Saints long for the Return of the Light of God's countenance.
1 LIft up thy Countenance, O Lord,
and make thy face to shine
Upon us, Lord -- one smile afford,
thy Love's better than Wine;
2 With shame of Face we do confess
our sins have caused thee
To hide thy Face -- nevertheless
once more thy Face let us see.
3 Return, Return, Return to us,
make haste, Lord, come away?
Lord, carry it no longer thus,
O! make no longer stay.
4 Our Spirits faint, our Hearts are sad,
for want of thy Presence,
Our Souls were never thoroughly glad
since thou departed hence.
5 O turn to us, turn once again,
our suit do not deny,
Remit our sin, wash out our stain,
though it is of a deep Die.
6 For Jesus's sake then shall we sing
forth aloud thy high Praise,
Who art our rightful Lord and King,
and do justly always.
HYMN 55.
Sinners invited to Christ, and Saints exhorted to Praise him.
1 YE foolish sinners, wherefore do
You spend your days and strength in vain?
And lying Vanities pursue;
What think you this way to obtain?
2 Salvation is not to be had
Out of Christ; but there is all in him,
All you in him sing and be glad,
For you have all Pardon of sin.
3 You Heaven-born Souls exalt his Name,
Unto him sing with cheerful Voice,
See that you spread abroad his Fame,
And evermore in him Rejoice.
4 He Is All in All, he is your Portion,
There Is none else can do your Souls good,
Trust only to what he has done,
For Pardon fly unto his Blood.
5 Come sinners, come, to the Fountain come,
That your Filth may be washed away.
Ye Scarlet Sinners to Christ come,
And let him bear your Guilt away.
6 Your Savior calls, make haste to him,
O! put him off no longer, but
Come, take the Pardon of your sin,
Venture, and on him your Trust put.
7 Come, and your sins shall not destroy
Nor ruin your Souls; but you shall
Go Home with your Hearts full of Joy,
And Jesus Christ your Savior call.
HYMN 56.
God teaches Humble Souls.
1 LOrd think not of the Fault^^,
And frailty of our Yourth,
Remember not how ignorant
We have been of thy Truth.
2 Thy Mercy's very sweet,
Thy Truth a perfect guide,
Let thy Spirit direct our feet,
No more let us turn aside.
3 The Humble thou will teach
Thy blessed Word to keep;
They Will heed what thy Servants do Preach,
Who are Lowly and Meek.
4 All such who fear thy Name
Thou will their Hearts direct,
That at thy Glory they may aim,
And thou their Works accept.
5 Thy Love, Lord, we adore,
Thy Orace we highly prize,
The same increase let us have more.
Enlighten our dark Eyes.
6 That we may clearly see
Into thy glorious Law,
In to the Law of Liberty
And our Affections draw
7 Unto thy self, and then
Thy Praises we shall sing
With joyful Lips, O! don't contemn
This our poor Offering.
HYMN 57.
Poor Penny-less and Scarlet-dy'd Sinners invited to come to Christ.
1 COme all ye Poor unto Christ's Door,
for Jesus does you call;
Come Ragged Ones -- whosoe'er comes,
exceeding well fare shall.
2 O don't Reject, nay don't Neglect
your coming unto Christ,
O make no stay -- another way
see you be not entic't.
3 Ye Crimson die -- O come and try

7 O don't delay another Day,

Bless God since he does yet call thee,
take Christ at any rate.
HYMN 58.
On the Folly and Madness of Sinners in refusing of Christ.
1 WHat Fools are they who do despise
Eternal Happiness?
Who their Sins, and base Lusts do prize
before Christ's Righteousness.
2 Who care not though they lose their souls
so that they may but have
The present Good, they have withstood
Him who alone can Save.
3 Madmen are these who strive to please
their Carnal Appetite,
And do prefer Earthly Treasure
before Eternal Light,
4 Christ is put by, him they deny,
His Offers they refuse,
His tender Love they don't approve
but rather the World choose.
5 Display his Grace, O! praise his Name,
whose Patience does exceed
The Sinners Sin, tho without shame
he does therein proceed,
6 Christ still does call, O! Sinners fall
before him, and confess
Your slighting Heart, from sin depart,
and take Christ's Righteousness.
HYMN 59.
An Evening Song for the Means of Grace.
1 UNto Jehovah let us sing,
his Name let us magnify,
To bring his Evening Offering
of Thanks, who will deny?
2 Look to your Hearts, are not they moved
to celebrate his Praise?
Because the Lord our Souls has loved,
he teaches us his Ways.
3 Let Us not quench the Holy Spirit,
him by no means let us grieve;
His motions O let us not neglect,
least we ourselves deceive.
4 Then will he fill our Souls with Joy,
Comfort and perfect Peace,
Which Men nor Devils cannot destroy,
and which will never cease.
5 Our Lives will be pleasant and sweet
while we are here below,
And when above our Souls do meet,
what Pleasures shall we know.
6 Where Cherubims and Seraphims,
and all the holy Quire,
Do warble forth God's Praise in Hymns,
whose Glory they Admire.
HYMN 60.
The divine Spirit may not be withdrawn, though we think otherwise.
1 WIth joyful Lips, O let us Praise
the holy Spirit, yea,
With one accord, his Fame lets raise,
and Merry let us be.
2 Let weak Believers, doubting Saints,
lift up their heads, and sing:
O! cast away all your complaints,
and your Thank-Off'ring bring.
3 The Spirit's presence you all have,
though it you don't apprehend;
The gift of gifts God you has gave,
his Love is without end.
4 Though this to you seems otherwise,
by his Discoveries;
O! it is because of your weak Eyes,
else him youl'd see and Prize.
5 His Presence is discovered
in a Comforting way;
But sometimes it is manifested
in a contrary way.
6 Afflictions, Losses, Crosses are
no sign of his Absence;
Yea, what although you Tempted are,
you may have his Presence.
7 Though very Weak your Grace may be,
you may not therefore say,
The Spirit's unmindful of me,
though it be not Midday
8 Yet the Sun may be risen, though
it shines not very clear,
You'ave no cause to Mourn as you do,
You'ave no just cause to fear.
9 O come, Rejoice, lift up your Voice,
the Spirit's Praise, O sing;
You are the Lord's eternal Choice,
come, O! come praise your King.
HYMN 61.
Helpless, Worthless Sinners Invited to Christ.
1 O Come ye Poor, ye Halt, ye Blind,
such who are on the way

2 Behold your Lord with held out hand,
to help your souls distress;
With open Arms, Jesus does stand,
come take of his Fullness.
3 Here Is Pardon, Peace, and Plenty, come
take whatsoever you need;
You who by sin have been undone

4 Nothing's required, only come
and of the Feast partake,
You who have nothing left at Home,
here you may come and take,
5 Without Penny or Pennyworth,
the best, the choicest good,
No doubt, you quickly would break forth
if 'twere but understood;
6 You would break forth with joy, and sing,
for you could not contain
Yourselves, if such a choice Blessing
you should but once obtain.
HYMN 62.
-- The Love, Alsufficiency, Mercifulness, and Holiness of God, laid in
Covenant for the benefit and security of his -- People.
1 THose who with God in Covenant are,
were from Eternity
Chosen and Loved, and they shall share
of true Felicity.
2 God's Alsufficiency's engaged
for them, and therefore they
(Though Hell's black Powers are enraged)
doubtless shall gain the Day
3 God's Mercifulness likewise is
concerned, and on their side,
Therefore his Favor such cannot miss,
their sins he will surely hide.
4 His Holiness is engaged
and therefore shall they be
In Heart and Life Sanctified,
and from their filth set free.
5 Grace he will preserve, and give more Grace,
that they may grow and thrive,
And fit them for his dwelling place,
where they shall all arrive.
6 Of endless Pleasure to partake
among the Heavenly Quire
Christ into's Bosom them will take,
and give them their desire.
7 So that they cannot choose but sing,
being ravished with joy,
In the Presence of the glorious King
O there is none to annoy.
HYMN 63.
A Hymn Sung at the Baptizing-Place.
1 YE Virgins fair, who clothed are
with Needle Work of Gold,
Your Souls Delight, the Prince of Light,
O! come here and behold.
2 How for your sakes he undertakes
to dye the Cursed Death,
That from Wrath he might set you free,
O! see him laid in the Earth.
3 A Jesus Dead and Buried,
in a Symbol you see
Risen again for to obtain
Pardon and set you free
4 From all your Foes, he undergoes
great Misery and Pain,
'Twas his dear Love, which did him move
thus your Love to obtain.
5 O come, draw near to Christ your dear,
the chief Joy of your Heart;
As we have done to Jesus come,
through fear, O! do not start
6 From his good Ways, for he who strays,
shall miss both Peace and Joy;
And they who do in false Ways go
God, our God, may destroy
7 All such who are caught in men's Snare,
and willing to Remain
In Egypt still, shall have their fill
of Fears; and not obtain
8 Any true Peace, and little Ease
unto their troubled mind,
But such who know Christ's Will, and do
the same true Peace shall find.
9 O! such will sing unto their King,
and greatly will Rejoice,
They Will not be sad but very glad,
because of their good Choice.
10 They'ave chosen Christ, they are not enticed
men's inventions to mind,
But still they will God's mind fulfill,
much Peace therefore they find.
11 O dearest Lord, with one accord
thy Praises we would sing,
Because by thee we are made free,
to observe every thing.
12 We understand thou do command,
by men we'll not be led.
For, Lord, we know such who this do,
shall never be Blessed.
HYMN 64.
There is no true reason why Saints should be Dejected.
1 YOu doubting Saints, cast off your fears,
and take a Cordial,
What cause is there of all these Tears?
surely no cause at all.
2 Though of Distractions you are full,
when on your God you call,
You have no cause to be so dull,
surely no cause at all.
3 You think your Prayers God does not hear,
what, though he hear not all,
You have no true reason to Fear,
surely no cause at all.
4 In Covenant with God you be,
He Will raise you when you fall,
From Hope you have no cause to flee,
surely no cause at all.
5 Rouse up your Voices, raise and sing,
cast away Satan's Gall;
You'ave no cause to fear any thing,
surely no cause at all.
6 Lift up your heads, why hang they down?
Christ is your All in All,
You'ave no cause to fear Satan's frown
surely no cause at all.
HYMN 65.
God instructs his People how to observe his Precepts.
1 HOw kind is God to us? how good?
that he reveals his Will,
That so it might be understood
by us, and we fulfill
2 The same, he does us teach, that so
(in a right manner) we
Might observe his Commands, and do
the same acceptably.
3 Help us, Lord, that we may beware
of all Formality;
In our Obedience let us with care
avoid Neutrality.
4 Let Us not be partial, but let us do
whatever thou do require;
But let us not vainly think our Works
deserve Wages and Hire.
5 At thy hand, Lord, let all our Aims,
be thee to glorify,
Through Jesus Christ, by thy Spirit,
and that continually.
6 Then will thou bless our Souls, and shed
abroad in every Heart
Thy Love and Fear, that so we may
no more from thee depart.
7 We shall then rejoice and be glad
in thee our Lord and King;
Yea, then surely none will refuse
thy high Praises to sing.
HYMN 66
Divine Adoration given unto Christ by ih^ Angels.
1 THousands of Thousands Angels are

2 Thy Royal Sacred Sovereign Power
Rightful Authority,
With the highest Reverence Adore
thy glorious Majesty,
3 The Seraphims and Cherubims,
not able to behold
Thy Glory, Civer with their Wings,
Their Faces, then how should
4 Such crawling Worms as we behave
our selves before him who
Both Breath and Being to us gave?
what can we say? what do?
5 Who greatly have Provoked him;
and daily do displease
Him, by a Compliance with Sin
even while we are in his Ways.
6 Of Worship -- O! what cause have we
his rich Grace to adore,
That to His Mercy's-Seat we see,
and find an Open Door.
7 Through Jesus Christ by the Spirits Light
Glory to God on high;
Help us, Lord, that we may delight
in thee Continually.

Stretch out thy Arm to him who will charm
thy Soul with one sweet smile.

Let none of us ourselves undo,
nor from thy Statutes stray.
4 An Heart of Flesh, a soft Heart give,
an humble, yiedling Heart,
That to thy Praise we all may Live,
and from thee never depart.

His Spirit will guide in his Ways
the lowly and the Meek,
2 His Paths they are most Sweet
his Word's a pefect guide
And God, the Lord, will Sinners teach,
even such as go aside.
3 Our Gods Commandments are
both holy, just, and good,
The best and pleasant ways of all
when once well understood.
4 It Is the best way for Peace
for Honor and Safety,
The Yoke of Christ is born with ease,
His Burthen's not Heavy.
5 To thee O God, we sing,
thy Name we praise, with Mirth,
Thou art our Sovereign Lord and King
Ruler Over all the Earth.
6 We are thy Subjects, and
Do in thy Law Delight;
O Lord, help us to Meditate
therein both Day and Night.
7 Let it appear we are thine,
by squaring our lives by
(And humbly observing) the same,
and that continually.
HYMN 70.
Great encouragement for God's People to keep on in his Ways.
1 O Help us, Lord, to take great care
that slothful we not be,
In thy Service, and that we are
more Diligent and Free.
2 Let us not Walk unevenly,
but with a strait foot go,
In thy Blessed Ways, and constantly
thy Pleasure let us do,
3 In thy paths, there is Protection,
with Peace, Pleasure, and Gain,
In the end Eternal Salvation,
all thy Pilgrims, Obtain.
4 O let us not be weary then,
neither faint in our mind,
Tho in the way all sorts of Men,
unto us prove unkind.
5 Uphold us with thy mighty Hand,
thy Name, O let us fear,
Let naught cause us to pause or stand
but still let us persevere.
And if thou grantest this request,
we shall Rejoice and Sing,
Sweetly, repose ourselves and Rest
under thy Sacred Wing.
HYMN 71.
How Saints should be qualified to Glorify God in a right manner.
1 O Now let Heart and Tongue agree,
to Sing Jehovahs praise;
For in his Divine Light we see,
in it is bright Shining Rays,
2 How, our Souls should be Qualified
his Name to Glorify;
With Divine Knowledge dignified,
Faith, and Humility.
3 With Love to God, and Holiness,
and then we shall be Meet;
When we these Graces do possess,
to sit at Jesus Feet,
4 And from his Lips, to receive Laws,
yea sit to do his will:
Yea when his Divine Spirit draws,
his mind we shall fulfill.
5 O Lord give Knowlidge Faith and Love,
in our Hearts shed abroad,
Holiness, Meekness, from above;
O make our Souls a hoard
6 Of Divine Grace that so we may
serve the with much Delight*
Lead us and keep us in thy Way,
let thy Law be our Light;
7 For pleasant are thy paths, and Sweet
is the Fruit of thy Tree,
How joyful are we when we meet
thy self, and thy Face see
8 In thy Ordinances, for there
thou meetest with thy Bride,
Thy Love thy looks her Soul does cheer,
more then all things beside.
HYMN 72.
There is A Common Conjunction of the Trinity, in the Business of our Salvation.
1 THere is a Common Conjunction,
of the most Sacred Trinity,
In the business of our Salvation,
which last will to Eternity.
2 God's People dearly Loved are,
the Father Love's them, and the Son,
And of the Spirits Love they share,
Jehovah he is their Portion.
3 The Father from Eternity
willed and designed our Happiness;
The Son and Spirit also willed
that Joy and Bliss we should possess.
4 The Father sends, he gives his Son,
the Son comes, and himself does give,
The Spirit from Sin does us turn,
and helps us unto God to live.
5 The Father he related is
nearly to each Believing Soul,
The Son a Friend and Savior is,
to all Sinners who on him roll.
6 The Spirit dwells in us, it is he
that changes and renews the Heart
From Tyrant Sin he sets us free,
and never will from us depart.
7 The Father, Son, and Spirit, have
engaged themselves to do us Good,
Even us Eternally to Save,
and in our very Room Christ stood
8 He bore our Sin, sustained our shame,
high praise, O! come, and let us sing,
To Father, Son, and Spirits Name,
To them our Offering we bring.
HYMN 73.
The Excellency of the Promises, and the Happiness of being in Covenant with
God.
1 GOD's Promises rich Treasures are
the best security,
Who ever has in these a share,
is rich Eternally.
2 They Are present stays, lasting Fountains,
sufficient inducements,
They Are powerful Pleas, and strong Claims,
they are full of sweet Contents.
3 How happy are all those who be
in the Covenant of Grace,
From God's revengeful Wrath they are free,
how happy is their Case?
4 Sin does not Domineer over them,
it is power is destroyed,
Eternally it cannot condemn,
though by it they are annoyed.
5 O bless the Lord, sound forth his Praise,
you Covenanted Ones,
O Come, and your God's glory raise,
be not like Stocks and Stones,
6 Which have no Hearts, no Tongues to sing,
come sullen Mutes break forth
And sing unto the glorious King
of Heaven and of Earth.
HYMN 74.
Christ the Sent of God, the Savior and Advocate of his People.
1 ALL you in Covenant
Rejoice, and be content,
God, Christ is yours, you cannot want;
The Father has him sent
2 That he himself might give
To you, and for you Dye,
And Rise again and ever Live
For you with God on high.
3 Where he does interceed,
As your great Advocate,
In your behalf he there does plead,
And your cause undertake.
5 Ye Saints break forth and sing
The praise of your best Friend
Jesus, your Prophet, Priest, and King,
His Love will never end.
6 He Will send down fresh Supplies
Of Grace into your Souls,
The dearest Jesus much does Prize
Each one who on him rowls.
HYMN 75.
It Is dangerous to trust to a false Faith
1 EFfectual Faith such have
Whose Sins are pardoned.
Believers only Christ does save:
All such are deceived
2 Who trust unto a Faith
Merely Historical;
Devils believe the Scripture says,
Yet Damned are they all.
3 That Faith that is Temporary,
Which but a while does last,
Whosoever trusts to it will miscarry,
And not of Mercy taste.
4 A Verbal Faith will not do,
Which lies only in Words,
If without Works it is not true,
Nor no true Peace affords.
5 Such who only presume,
They Christ and Pardon have,
Though they ungodly are -- their doom
Is, Christ will not them save.
6 True Faith, Lord, do thou give,
Faith which works by Love,
That to thee we may wholly Live,
And never from thee move.
7 Then shall we pardoned be,
And in thy Son rejoice;
Thy Beauty in Christ shall we see,
And know we are thy Choice.
HYMN 76.
How the Spirit Revives and comforts, Drooping Saints.
1 THe Spirit which is from above
and dwells in the Saints
Is a Spirit of perfect love;
and when the Christian faints
2 For want of Comfort from on high
Gods love he sheds abroad
In the hearts of such and draws nigh,
with a Reviving word.
3 Of Promise; which a Cordial is
that doubting souls does raise
That such cry out, Christ's mine, I Am his,
and delight in his Ways.
4 To God he does inflame their Love,
and unto Christ his Son,
To Love the Saints he does them move,
yea, to Love every one
5 That the Divine Image does bear,
though from each other they
Differ in Judgment, yet such are
in Spirit knit hereby.
6 To serve the Lord he does incline
the Heart, and does dispose
The Soul to dig in the Gospel Mine,
and Corruption oppose.
7 Glory to Father and to Son,
who have the Spirit sent
To do what he in us has done,
even to our Hearts Content.
8 O praise the Lord, bless him my Soul,
admire, adore his Grace,
On Christ, and only on him roll,
to'ard Zion set thy Face.
HYMN 77.
Christ a Believers All in All.
1 Now unto Jesus Christ let us Sing,
before him let us fall,
He, that did our Salvation bring,
even he is All in All.
2 O! thou blessed One the Lord of Lords,
thou mighty King of Kings,
Thou art the S^^ of Righteousness,
with healing in thy Wings.
3 Thou art our Meat, thou art our Drink,
our Physic, yea, our Health;
Our Life, our Light, our Joy, our Crown,
our Glory and our Wealth.
4 It Is thou who art our Captain strong,
our Foes for to destroy,
Dear Lord of thee we make our Song,
thou art our only Joy.
5 By thee from Death we are set free,
thou hold'st us we cannot fall,
There Is Grace enough treasured in thee,
thou art our All in All.
6 The thoughts hereof does our Hearts raise,
thy Name to magnify,
And, Lord, we hope to sing thy Praise,
to all Eternity.
HYMN 78.
A Call to Saints to Adore the Mediator, of the New Covenant.
1 ALL Saints that on the Earth do dwell
Sing to the Lord with cheerful Voice,
Love, Adore Christ his Praise foretell;
Come ye before him and Rejoice.
2 He Is the Reconciler indeed,
Without our aid he Peace did make
By him from Wrath Sinners are freed,
The whole Work he did undertake.
3 All ye who tread his Courts him Praise
Approach with joy his Throne unto,
Praise, Laud, and Bless his Name always
It Is very seemly so to do,
4 For God, in Christ, to us is Good,
His Covenant for ever's sure,
His Truth at all time firmly stood,
And shall from Age to Age endure.
5 All Enmity, is done away
All Love is introduced in'th place,
Christ is our Peace, our Hope, our Stay
In him we are in a Blessed Case.
9 Joy does abound God's now our Friend
Our Enemy he will be no more,
We shall enjoy his Love to the end,
Our Stock in Christ's for ever sure.
HYMN 79.
Faith wrought in the Heart by God, and Purchased by Christ.
1 FAith is the work of God in us,
wrought by his mighty Power;
And being Wrought it unites us
to Christ in the self same Hour;
2 He that has it is Pardoned,
his Sin is done away,
In the Arms of Grace he is Embraced
Christ is become his stay.
3 His Shield, his Rock, his Hiding Place,
his Dear his Faithful Friend,
Blessed for ever is his Case,
of Joy he will know no end.
4 Work Faith, Lord, Faith unto us give,
O! it is in thy own hand;
O! cause the Dead in Sin to Live,
and Obey thy Command:
5 This do, and then we shall Rejoice
in thee, our Glorious KING;
With well-tuned Hearts we'll lift our Voice
and thy high Praises Sing.
6 O! Blessed Jesus, it was thee,
did purchase by thy Blood
Pardon of Sin, it is by thee we
have right unto all Good.
7 Both Grace and Glory we receive,
as by thee Purchased;
And whosoever does believe
therein, is interested.
HYMN 80.
A Sacramental Hymn.
1 UNto thy House of Banqueting,
unto thy Table we
Are come, O Lord, and with longing
desires, our Love to see.
2 And, O! how Pleasant is a sight
of thy most Gracious Face?
Who art our Souls Joy and Delight,
how sweet is thy Free Grace?
3 O! none like Christ; O! none like Christ,
for Riches, Beauty, Love,
O! none like this Sacred Bridgroom,
the Lord of Life above.
4 One sight of him, by Faith will Charm,
and melt the Hardest Heart,
Who ever thus see him most freely
with all, will (for Him) part.
5 Behold thy Guest our dearest Dear,
one smile afford thy Bride,
Nothing so much our Souls would Cheer
in all the world beside.
6 Thy Dainties they are very sweet,
they have a pleasant taste,
But if in these we do not meet
thy self, we'd rather Fast.
7 But sure with Jesus we have been,
else what makes us Rejoice,
Our dearest Lord sure we have seen,
and heard his gracious Voice.
8 Surely he speaks, saying; I am he
that all your Sins forgive;
From Sin and Death I set you free,
a Grown of Life I give.
9 Both Grace and Glory shall you have,
I'ave bought it with my Blood,
Eternally your Souls I Will save,
In me lies all your Good.
10 Dearest thy Love's better than Wine
we it greatly admire;
If thou art ours, Lord, we art thine,
thou art our Souls desire.
11 Over us, Lord, thy Banner spread,
the Banner of thy Love;
Into thy Wine-Sellers us lead,
and never from us remove.
12 With Apples Comfort us, and Stay
our Souls with Flaggons; still,
Lord, guide and keep us in thy way,
thy Blessed Word Fulfill.
13 Dearest, it is not long since thou
did court us and prevail,
With all our hearts let us Love thee now,
and our folly bewail.
14 This Church, Lord, keep, and it preserve
until thou do appear,
And from thy Truths never let it swerve,
from errors keep it clear.
15 Then with the holy Quire above
thy grace shall we display.
And speak of thy eternal Love
to an eternal Day.
HYMN 81.
On Hypocrisy, Unbelief, final Despair, trusting to our own Works.
1 NO cause have Hypocrites to sing
Praise unto God for pard'ning Grace,
Which they never had -- their suffering
Of deserved Wrath comes on apace.
2 Feigned Repentance dangerous is,
Though many of this guilty are;
There Is none of them but what will miss
Their Pardon, such God will not spare.
3 Unbelievers will quickly find,
And feel their lasting Misery;
They loved Sin, but Christ did not mind,
Therefore God will not hear their cry.
4 And such who finally Despair,
Their Misery is great besure,
For such in the borders of Hell are,
And Hellish Torments do endure.
5 Such who rest on their Righteousness,
And trust unto their own Good Works,
Pardoning Grace shall not possess,
They Are no better than Jews and Turks.
6 All such who Unmerciful are
Unto their Friends and Brethren, shall
Not in God's pardoning Grace share,
But into Hell he will cast them all.
7 But blessed is the Penitent
Believing Soul, for truly he
Has no cause to be Discontent,
From all his Sins being set free.
8 Great cause has he God's Praise to sing,
Yea cause to Leap and Dance for Joy
He Is Pardoned now, and this Blessing
He shall for evermore enjoy.
HYMN 82.
God gives a New Heart and Spirit, to his People in Covenant.
1 JEhovah's Praise let each Soul sing,
let none refuse to raise
The Fame and Honor of our King
in Psalms and Hymns of praise.
2 A New Heart he has promised,
A New Spirit he will give;
For Christ the same has purchased,
that to him we might live.
3 Let us Examine, Search, and Try,
Whither we have or no
Renewed Hearts assuredly,
And Jehovahs Will do.
4 Let none of us Deceived be
thinking we do Possess
Renewing Grace, when indeed we
Are in the Gall of Bitterness.
5 A Civil Righteousness -- and Grace
Restraining, many have,
With common Gifts, and yet to them
New Hearts God never gave.
6 Blessed be Israel's God, for he
ope's our eyes that we may
Our Emptyness and great Wants see,
and to Christ have away;
7 Who is a Storehouse, and Fountain
of Grace; who comes to him
New Hearts and Spirits do obtain,
with pardon of each Sin.
8 O! Sinners come, Christ casts out none
that unto him draw near;
Poor Scarlet Sinners he will receive,
Distressed Souls he will cheer.
HYMN 83.
The Advantages of having the Spirit of God.
1 THe Spirit's Comforts are
Exceeding high and choice,
No joys with these we may compare,
Ye chosen ones rejoice.
2 O! he does cheer us up
In all our Troubles, he
With spiced Wines does fill our Cup,
And from Fear sets us free.
3 He comfort the Soul,
And that when none else can,
He who on Jesus Christ does roll
He makes a joyful Man.
4 A common Conjunction
Of the whole Trinity
Are concerned for our Salvation
To all Eternity.
5 The Father does us love,
And so does Christ the Son;
The Holy Ghost will never remove
From us till time is done.
6 To the Trinity we sing,
Their Love let us admire;
Let fervent Love be on its Wing
To God, our Souls desire.
HYMN 84.
Sinners ingratitude in refusing Christ.
1 UNto the Lord, to Christ the Lord,
our Offering let us bring;
Sinners, why do you not accord
to come unto this King?
2 It Is great Ingratitude indeed
in you who thus do slight
Christ's Love, who in your stead did bleed,
O! come to the Prince of Light.
3 O! what Contempt you east upon
this Soul alluring Love;
Sinners, whither do your Hearts run?
to'ards Christ why don't you move?
4 O! here is a perfect Righteousness
offered to the undone;
Pardon of Sin, nevertheless
they unto Christ don't come.
5 Rather than Christ Sinners do choose
meet Trifles, empty Trash;
O! wherefore do you Christ refuse,
O! come be not so rash.
6 Come, come to Christ, O! come to him,
sinners do not delay;
Come take the Pardon of your Sin,
and go joyful away.
HYMN 85.
On the Love of God.
1 WE of thy Love now Lord, would sing,
none can it Comprehend,
It has an everlasting Spring,
and it will never end.
2 O! Love us Lord, or else we Dye,
it is only this we crave,
If thou thy Love should once deny,
we should soon find a Grave.
3 Death conquers all, and all submit
unto his pale Command;
So Love brings all unto it is Feet,
who are therewith enflamed.
4 The Grave is never satisfied,
no more indeed is he
Who has a taste of thy choice Love,
till he enjoys thee.
5 But Death it is true destroys and kills,
thy Love does make alive;
It kills our sins, and we thereby
do presently revive.
6 Let such who know thy Love rejoice,
and sing thy Praises forth,
For there is none, Lord, like to thee,
in Heaven nor in Earth.
HYMN 86.
God prepares his People for his promised Good.
1 TO the Eternal glorious King
give Glory, Honor, Praise,
In Psalms and Hymns unto him sing,
own him in his own Ways.
2 A new Heart, and new Spirit he
to his People does give,
From the Stone in the Heart he sets them free,
that to him they might live;
3 That each of them in Union
with his Son may be brought,
And have with him Communion,
and by himself be taught.
4 That he may bring upon them all
the Good he'ath Promised,
That those Blessings on them may fall
which Christ has purchased.
5 God himself undertakes all this,
for none else can it do,
That the whole Glory may be his,
and he himself prove true.
6 That his Chosen may not despair
though their best strength is weak,
Yea, though exceeding weak they are,
and their Transgressions great.
7 Sing Praise, admire, adore free Grace,
electing, calling Love,
Display his Fame before his Face,
whose August Throne's above.
8 Let us join with the sacred Quire
of Seraphims above,
Exalt the Name of our desire,
our Lord, our Friend, our Love.
HYMN 87
All spiritual Blessings comes to us through Christ.
1 UNto the Lord with cheerful Voice
come, O! come, let us sing;
In Jesus Christ let us Rejoice,
our Love, our Lord, our King.
2 Who Loved us, and shed his Blood
to wash us from our Sin;
And to purchase for us all Good,
all we have comes through him.
3 Newness of Heart a New Spirit,
God gives for his sake;
Through him we hope to inherit
a future Glorious State.
4 Unto us he his Spirit sends,
our Souls to Sanctify;
Now he esteems us as his Friends,
and will Eternally.
5 His Righteousness does Justify
us in his Fathers sight;
His Grace our Hearts does Purify,
in us he takes Delight.
6 His holy Spirit makes us meet
for future Joy and Bliss;
That with Comfort we may him meet,
and he own us for his.
HYMN 88.
God only the Object of Praise.
1 LOrd thou art the Object of Praise,
thy Love we do Adore;
Thou do preserve us in thy Ways,
and have Grace still in store
2 To raise us, if by Sin we fall:
glory unto thy Name;
Thou hear when on thee we call,
help us to spread thy Fame
3 And Honor where ever we come,
that thy dear Saints may know
What thou, our God, for them have done,
and promised to do.
4 Thou will enable us to walk
in thy Statutes and Keep
Thy way, which to us thou do Chalk,
and lead'st us in the Deep
5 And sacred Mysteries of thy Will,
O thou our Lord and King;
Angels above thy mind fulfill,
and we thy Praises sing;
6 And hope ever long with them to join
ev'en with the Heavenly Quire,
In tuning thy Praise, for we are thine
and thou, Lord, our desire
HYMN 89.
On Divine conduct and providence, respecting the Saints affictions.
1 GOd has great reason to Chastise
His Saints, and does design their Good;
It Is dangerous for our Hearts to rise
Against him, or that they should intrude
2 Into his Council, to direct
Him what is best for him to do;
This on his wisdom does reflect,
The direct way us to undo.
3 God has great reason to delay
Deliverance unto his Saints;
And such are quite out of their way
Who foolishly make their Complaints
4 ainst his Conduct of affairs,
Whose eternal Council must stand,
To contradict the same, who dares
Oppose his most Sacred Command.
5 God does Afflict his Saints in Love,
And designs good thereby to bring,
Unto their Souls -- he will never remove
From them, what cause have they to Sing?
6 Come Sing, let us Sing his Praise, let us Sing
His Glory; O! let us display
Before him; let us our Offering bring;
And on him let us our Souls stay.
HYMN 90
Reason why the divine Spirit ought to be praisd.
1 TO the Spirit of Power we
with Joyful Lips do sing;
We glorious things by his Light see,
rich Cordials does he bring
2 Unto our doubting fainting Minds;
he helps us to receive
Christ, and has broken up the Mines
of Grace, which we perceive.
3 He moves and helps us to Pray,
and shows our helplesness;
He quickens us, that so we may
make out to Christ's Fullness.
4 He helps, us to hate, and loathe Sin,
for Christ, to forsake all
And those who are thus led by him,
inherit Glory shall.
5 He Is the Spirit of Liberty,
God's Chosen he sets free
From Bondage and Iniquity;
also by him we be
6 Freed from Satan, out of his Claw,
and from all Slavish Fear,
By Cords of Love he does us draw,
and the way does he clear;
7 Unto Eternal Salvation
high Praises let us give;
For all he does, will do, has done,
and to his Praise let us live.
HYMN 91.
An accusing Conscience silenced.
1 Conscience has got no Power
To accuse or condemn
The Saints, Satan he cannot devour,
For God has pardoned them.
2 No cause of slavish Fear
Where sin is pardoned,
Where from all Guilt the Soul stands clear,
By Christ reconciled.
3 Whatever does befall
That Soul shall do it good,
In the midst of all troubles he shall
Find Peace in the precious Blood
4 Of Jesus Christ, -- yea, he
Has all his Doubts resolved,
Being forgiven he is set free
Of that which had involved
5 His Soul, -- and now he may
Rejoice in Christ, and sing,
Free Grace has put him in the Way,
And brought him to the Spring
6 Of unparrallel'd Peace,
Pleasure and Joy, -- and this
Shall grow, and abound, and increase
To an eternal Bliss.
HYMN 92.
Spiritual blessings require cheerful thankfulness
1 SIng to the Lord with cheerful Voice,
exalt and praise his Name,
Let all his Saints in him rejoice,
and spread abroad his Fame.
2 Our Hearts his Spirit Crucifies
unto all selfish ends,
And he himself wholly denis,
who God's Glory intends,
3 The Lord a tender Conscience gives,
that we may fear to sin,
And he that has it to God lives,
and stands in awe of him.
4 He sheddeth abroad in our Hearts
his captivating Love;
His divine Will to us imparts,
and eyes us from above.
5 How much in him should we delight,
whose goodness does abound?
And serve him with our strength and might;
O! let us still gain more Ground
6 Of our Corruptions; and let us keep
on in the way of Peace,
Let Us run with Patience, and not creep
like such as are at ease.
7 Do this, and then great Majesty,
with Joy each Soul will sing,
Thy glorious Praise, and magnify
thee as their rightful King.
HYMN 93.
Good news for great Sinners.
1 FRom Heaven News is come,
To Sinners it is sent,
Good News to the Lost and Undone,
From God Omnipotent.
2 He'as made a Covenant,
In it his Powers Engaged;
So that the Devil himself cannot
Hurt us although enraged.
3 There Is no Believing Soul
Can come to any harm;
For they who on this God do roll,
Are upheld by his Arm.
4 He'as promised Help and Aid,
Unto his own Children;
They have no cause to be afraid,
God's Truth's engaged for them,
5 His Graciousness likewise
Is for them on their side;
If this their God does once arise
None can his Wrath abide.
6 Their Enemies will fall,
And the high Mountains melt,
By the Ungodly his Wrath shall
By all of them be felt.
HYMN 94.
On the Cure of the stone in the Heart.
1 COme let us sing Jehovahs Praise,
for the work he has done,
Declare his Fame, his Honor raise,
who cures the Heart of Stone.
2 How powerfully did Sin reign
before this Cure was wrought?
What Benefits we hereby gain
which by us were unsought?
3 His Law is written in our Hearts;
within us there is a Spring
Of Repentance, that now we Mourn
that ever we Grieved our King.
4 O! now we can with all our Souls
receive the Lord Jesus,
And thank his Grace with all our Hearts
that he will receive us;
5 And with God have Communion,
and that with great content:
He'ath took away the heart of Stone,
and a new Heart has sent.
6 With boldness now we have access
unto the throne of Grace,
That God, whose Law we did transgress,
we can now look in the Face,
7 And call him Father, and he will own
us for his Children dear,
And his pleasure to us make known,
who his Enemies were.
8 Glory, eternal Praise, to thee
who'ast burst our bonds in twain.
And from sin's power set us free,
and the Enmity slain.
HYMN 95.
Petitions for Perseverance, and other spiritual Blessings.
1 O Help us, Lord, to Persevere
in observing thy Will;
To offend thee let us always fear,
and keep thy Precepts still.
2 Make us more Fruitful, let us grow
in Grace and Knowledge, then
Thy Loving Kindness shall we know,
and be made happy Men.
3 Let Us eye our Tore-runners who are
deceased in the Faith;
Our steps with theirs let us compare,
and mind what thy Word says.
4 O! help us rightly to improve
the Company of those
Who fear thy Name and thy Son Love,
whom for thy self thou'st Chose.
5 That we more diligent may be
thy Statutes to observe,
That so we may Glorify thee,
and never from them swerve.
6 Thy glorious Name then shall we praise,
and thy high Praises sing;
Thy Fame and Honor shall we raise,
who art our Lord and King.
HYMM 96.
On the hardness of sinners Hearts.
1 HOw forward, Lord, are Men to sin?
what stony Hearts have they?
How secure are their Souls within?
like to be cast away;
2 And yet silent and quiet he,
in the least does not fear,
Though thy Wrath he begins to see,
he will not shed a Tear.
3 O! take away the stony Heart,
and a Heart of Flesh give,
That from each sin we may depart,
and to thy Glory live.
4 Then, Lord, shall we with thankfulness,
in Hymns set forth thy Praise,
Yea, then we shall both fear and bless,
and serve thee all our Days.
5 What infinite Patience have thou,
though Man does thus rebel,
And will not to thy Scepter bow,
thou casts him not to Hell.
6 O! what cause have we to admire
at thy Long-suffering;
That against such thy Wrathful Ire
is not yet on the Wing.
HYMN 97.
Petitions against Backsliding.
1 EStablish Lord our hearts with Grace,
and let us not turn aside,
Least against us thou set thy Face,
O! how shall we abide
2 Thy Fury and Indignation?
how dreadful will it be
To miss Eternal Salvation,
and thy Love never see?
3 O! help us daily to delight
in thy most blessed Word,
To our feet let it be a light,
and to it let us accord.
4 O shine upon us, let thy Love
constrain us to obey
Thy royal Will, never let us move
our Feet out of thy way.
5 But let thy Presence always cheer
our Spirits, and let sin
Be, evermore our greatest fear,
which our delight has been.
6 Then of thy Kindness shall we sing,
in Psalms and Hymns of Praise,
And still delight to be walking
in thy most pleasant Ways.
HYMN 98.
The Happiness of those whose Hearts are Renewed.
1 HOw Happy is the Man whose Heart
is renewed by Grace?
In God and Christ he has his part;
thrice Happy is his Case;
2 What Satisfaction, what Delight?
what Peace, Pleasure, and Joy?
With what prevailing Power and Might
does he his Foes annoy?
3 In-dwelling sin and Satan too
are Vanquished in the Fight,
Grace does his secret Lusts subdue
and puts them to the flight.
4 The Saints are his Society,
God's, Word's his only Rule;
With those things he will not comply
which Carnal Men befool.
5 It Is only Christ he does desire,
his Heart is set on him;
Free Grace he greatly does admire,
forsakes and hates his Sin.
6 In praising God he spends his Days,
his Love he does adore;
He takes pleasure in his Ways,
and serves him evermore.
HYMN 99.
Saints have no cause to be discouraged.
1 GReat cause have we to sing thy Praise
Who have our Souls greatly cheered;
We have no cause throughout our days
At all to be Discouraged.
2 O Lord, because thine only, Son
For us his precious blood has shed
We have no cause whatever we'ave done
At all to be Discouraged,
3 Seeing by him our debts, are paid,
And we to thee Reconciled
We have no cause, though we have strayed,
At all to be Discouraged.
4 Thou do as easily Pardon
Great sins as small; the Dejected
Have no cause, whatever they have done
At all to be Discouraged.
5 Sweet is thy Love Rich is thy Grace,
And all such who have Repented,
Have no cause in whatsoever case,
At all to be Discouraged.
6 Thy Mercy Lord, is bottomless,
To such who in it have trusted,
Thy Saints, have no cause in Distress
At all to be Discouraged
HYMN 100.
For the Baptizing Place.
1 ALL Hail to the sacred Bridegroom,
who is come to meet his Bride,
Into his glori'us Dining Room
he gently Her does guide.
2 There it is She tastes of his Love,
which far exceeds Wine;
Thus he communes; My Dearest Dove
I Am thine, and thou art mine.
3 I Am always with thee, never will
thy Soul forsake and leave,
Each word of Promise I Will fulfill,
'till at length I receive
4 Thee to that Glory -- Glory which
my Blood has Purchased,
Where beyond thought thou shall be Rich,
Eternally Blessed.
5 O! come my Undefiled One,
cast thy self in my Arms;
With confidence unto me come,
I Will save thee from all Harms.
6 Thy Enemies cannot hurt thee
whilst in my Arm thou art;
Whilst protected thou art by me,
and I Will never depart
7 From thee, but ever will abide
with thee thy as dear Friend;
And for thy precious Soul provide
even unto the end.
8 Dearest unto thee we do come,
in thy Despised Way
We come, We come, we freely come,
that thy blessed Face we may
9 Behold. we come and our Souls cast
into thy Arms with Joy;
Thy Spiced Wines O! let us taste,
and thy sweet Love enjoy.
10 O! cloathe us with thy Righteousness
Most Pure, Spotless, and White,
For only in this Comely Dress,
does thy blessed Eye delight.
11 In thy own Beauty, Lord, we come,
in thy white Robe we stand,
We come, we come, we freely come,
and Obey thy Command.
12 O! Dearest Love, may not we say,
some of us, that this is
Our Souls joyful Espousal Day,
the beginning of Bliss.
13 Our Souls in thee greatly Rejoice,
our Hearts thou make glad,
Dearest we being thy own choice
have no cause to be Sad
14 How Pleasant are these Walks? how sweet
are the Grapes of this Vine?
More sweet, because Christ here does meet
this deformed Soul of mine.
15 He stays my Soul with Flaggons, he
with Apples does it cheer;
What perfect Beauty do I see?
I Am sick of Love, my Dear
16 Dearest, thy Smiles ravish my Soul,
they quite desolve my Heart;
O'l take my All, on thee I Row,
my Joy O'l never depart.
The End of the first CENTURY.
