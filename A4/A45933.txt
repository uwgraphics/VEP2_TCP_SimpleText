A True and Faithful Account of the entire Defeat of the Rebbel Dundee by Major
General Maccay, with the Number of the Slain.
With Allowance,

June the 24 th, 1689.


SAtterday in the Afternoon an Express arrived from Scotland, and another
Yesterday, both of which brought a succession of Glad-Tydings from that Kingdom
of no less Import, then the Surrender of the Castle of Edinburgh to King
William; for as that Condition draw'd the Consequence of future Success upon
the Rebel Dundee, so the Defeat of that Incendiary will no doubt contribute to
the Re-establishing the Repose of that Country, which we find to be, viz.

That Major General Maccay by his Wise Conduct brought the King's Forces into
such advantageous Posts in the High-Lands, surmounting all the difficulties
which the Viscount endeavored to bring upon him, by dogging him from Hill to
Hill, Ensnared him at last in his own Politic Method, making such faint
Marches and Counter-Marches, as to draw him into a Defile through which he could
not so suddenly pass, but that it gave the opportunity to a Detachment of the
General's Forces, to oblige him to a Fight, which for some time was obstinately
maintained by the Rebels, but within the space of Three Quarters of an Hour the
Viscount with all his People was Entirely Defeated, One Hundred and Thirty
being Killed upon the spot, besides diverse made Prisoners, the Viscount himself
narrowly escaping not with about Twenty Horse.

The other Express says, That the Parliament after their Adjournment to the 17
th Instant, met accordingly, to whom his Excellency, Duke Hamilton, his
Majesty's High Commissioner, made a most Excellent Speech, and had the Thanks
of the House returned him for it, they having gone through all the Preliminaries
of taking the Oaths to King William and Queen Mary, Two Members only Declining,
who were afterward Expelled the House, and the Parliament affirmed all the
Proceedings of the late Convention to be Legal and Binding.

The Lord Hume being brought to Edinburgh as suspected to be going to Dundee,
is Committed Prisoner to the Castle. And it further adds, That his Majesty's
Ship, the Jerusalem, Captain Bettwell Commander, with others in his company,
Laden with Ammunition and Provision from the City of Bristol, are safely
arrived in Londonderry, (as by Letters out of the Place assures,) to the
Inexpressible Joy of those People, the Irish not having then finished their
Bomes across the Lough.
