Hand of God, and there Officiating as a most Compassionate High Priest in
behalf of Sinners.

THE PREFACE.
To the Christian and Considerate Reader: Grace, Mercy, etc.
AS to the Great Richness and Goodly Number of This Author's Writings, I shall
not here say much; having spoken most of what I had to say anent Those two
Points, in The Account or Preface set before the First Volume of His Works,
Printed in Folio the last year. And yet Thus much I shall say, That I am daily
more and more confirmed in my Judgment There passed upon them: being likewise
persuaded of This, That, though it be but the Addition of one Single Unity to
the former Number of his Books; yet will it prove a Multiplied Accession of
Degrees to the weight and excellency of them.

I shall (perhaps) better gratify The Reader, if I can present unto his View
any Observables worthy his Notice, Concerning the Method and References both of
This present, and Those his other writings published in His Lifetime. And such
as I think may be useful do here follow.

1. Of this Great Author's Books of Commentaries upon the Creed (with their
Respective Appendices;) The Five First, I Believe in God.
(viz. The 1, 2, and 3. Of the Eternal Truth of Scripture, etc. The 4. Of
Justifying Faith; The 5. Of the Original of Unbeleif, Misbeleif, etc.) Relate
unto, or Explicate the first Words of the First Article of The Creed.

2. His Sixth Book being A Treatise of the Divine Essence and Attributes; (to
which append his Sermons upon 2. God, The Father Almighty maker of Heaven and
Earth.
Chron. 6. 39. upon Jeremie 26. 29. His Treatise of the Signs of The Times:
and his Sermon upon Luke 21. 1.) Referres to the next words of The Creed.

Now, if any shall Object, That nigh the One Half of these (Treatises, and
Sermons too) are about Divine Providence; of which there is no explicit mention
in the Creed. The Answer is ready and easy; So they ought to be; it was meet
and right they should be so. The Good God that made the world (with all the
comely Ornaments and rich Furniture thereof) did neither leave it to it self,
so soon as it was made, nor transmit the Tuition of it to a Guardian or
Locum-Tenens; but ever did, and still does keep the Government in That Hand
which with so great wisdom made the same. And His very Title (...); His Son
our Savior's Words [Pater meus adhuc operatur] teach us to depend upon, and
trust unto his Constant Providence and support for Conservation; And This (as a
Clew) leads, or, as a Terminus Communis, Couples, our Faith, to his Creative
power.

3. His Two Sermons, (the Former of them Called Bethlehem and Nazareth, upon
Jeremie 31. 22. The later upon Galat. 4. 4. enstyled Mankinds Comfort from the
weaker sex.) His Treatise, entitled Christ's Answer to John's Question; or, An
Introduction to the Knowledge of Christ. His 7. Book of Commentaries upon the
Creed, Called, The Knowledge of Christ Jesus; Containing The Principles of
Christian Theology, And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord; which was
Conceived by the the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary.
qua Talis, (Christ's Eternal Sonship; his Conception, Birth and Circumcision
in the Fullness of Time, being, if not the entire Subject, yet the Main Scope of
these last mentioned parcels) respectively refer to that Portion of The Creed
wherein we avouch our Faith in The Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ incarnate.

4. The Subject of this Great Author's Eighth Book of Commentaries upon The
Apostles Creed, enstyled, Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified, Dead
and Buried.
The Humiliation of the Son of God, is the same God and our Lord, who was
conceived by The Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Marie. And The Scope of it
is to show, That HE, according to the Scripture before Extant,

5. His ninth Book, Of the Consecration of the Son of God to his Everlasting
Priesthood; whereof His Agony and Bloody Death, His Rest in the Grave, (and in
this Authors private opinion, see Book 8. page 385,) He descended into Hell,
the third day he rose again from the Dead, He ascended into Heaven.
His descension into Hell, His Resurrection and Ascension, were Respectively
the several Giests or Moments, (some as preparations, others as Continuations;
some as Accomplishments others as Consequents,) Looks back somewhat toward
the former, and forward somewhat toward these Later particulars of the Creed.

6. All the Tracts or Books mentioned in the three last Paragraphs (for those
be They, which Directly, Destinately, and Immediately treat of Christian
Theology, qua Talis,) make but up The First and more Easy Part of The
Knowledge of Christ. And This (to use the Author's own words) Consists in the
display of that most admirable Harmony, which arises from the Concent of
Prophetical with Evangelical Writings; or, from the Correspondencie of
Parallels between Matters of Fact recorded in the Old Testament, and the Events
answering in proportion to them, in the New.

7 This Tenth Book (not published till now) is addressed to The Second part of
The Knowledge of Christ, which Consists in the True Experimental Valuation of
His Undertakings for man's Redemption: viz. Of His taking upon Himself the Form
of a Servant, of His Death, Resurrection and Ascension. Of all which several
steps or progresses of His O Economie (as also of the whole Volume of His other
whether Actings or Sufferings for us) The most precious Beneficial Effects and
saving Influences are Actually and only Derived unto us by the Continued Acts
and Constant Exercise of His Everlasting Priesthood, executed daily in The
Heavenly Sanctuary, by Him there Sitting on the Right Hand of Majesty on
High. It Is plain then, And there he sits on the Right Hand of God the Father
Almighty.
that, That Part of this Tenth Book which explicitly treates of Christ's
Priesthood, as it supposes Christ Risen and ascended, so it relates specially
to that portion of the Creed,

8 This Glorious High Priesthood of the Son of God, then, is The Office of
Perfection; The completing, finishing, or Crowning office. That Office amongst
us which has it is name from Finalis Concordia, is in no proportion so useful
for agreements or Atonements civil betwixt man and man, as This Transcendent
Priesthood of Christ is Effectual, to all that sue to Him (with such Fervence
and Reverence as he in the days of His Flesh did unto His Father) for
Reconciling us mortal wretches unto God.

9 And here now, besides what is said above of the great Excellency of Christ's
Priesthood; The Intertainment of three or four meditations (Homogeneal to this
Subject, and which so Voluntarily offer themselves as that I cannot reject
them:) As 1. That Melchizedek King of Salem (probably Shem the Great, certainly
Some person of Eminent Piety as well as Dignity, An Ideal pattern of all
perfections required in both the sons of Oil, King, and Priest; A Pater sui
seculi, A Resemblance of the First Adam, but A most lively Type of Christ) Had
the Priesthood conveighd unto him in some Signal Manner; so that Text seems to
imply, [And he was THE PRIEST of the Most High God.] 2. That Aaron, who was
also a Type of Christ, did not take this Honor upon himself, but was most
solemnly and satisfactorily called of God thereto, and stated (himself and his
successors) therein. 3. That our Lord Jesus Christ, The Son, The Only Son of
God, (and so by natural Inheritance entitled to the Kingdom and Priesthood of
the world) did not glorify himself to be made an High priest; but had, besides
the immeasurable Unction of the Spirit, the Office founded upon him by A most
Ample Patent: [In the Volume of the Book it is written --.] and invested in
Him, and only in Him, by The word of the Oath of God. Hebr. 7. 20. etc. Does
render me wonder-strook at four sorts of men most Active in this Busy Age. 1.
At such as think it a Piece of their Christianity to loath and and despite
the Name of Priest, as of some pernicious vermin bred out of a Putrid Jewish
Carcass; whereas it Signifies neither less nor more then a Person entrusted
(and who is sufficient for that Thing!) with some part or Branch of Christ's
Priesthood which is here on earth to be managed and Executed for the Benefit of
mankind, even of Him that so Hates the name. 2. That the Bishop of that
Ancient Sea Apostolic should by virtue of such a dim Commission as cannot be
read without Spectacles of Fancy made at Rome, Grasp at All in gross, as if
all Power, which Christ Himself does not personally exercise in the Heavenly
Sanctuary, was to pass and be derived by imposition or under the Signature of
His Hand, and to be shared and dispensed at his discretion. 3. That those our
Brethren in Christ (if yet they will allow us to call them Brethren which have
welnigh given over to say Pater Noster) who so zealously hate Innovations,
should, contrary to the Church-Practice of 15. Ages together, not only 1. take
upon them to Ordain or commissionate men to execute part of Christ's Preisthood,
and 2. to Censure offenders, without consent of that Order which has so fair a
Patent to show, and so long Prescription, somewhile for the sole Power, always
for the Main Stroke in Both; But even 3. to censure and excommunicate some
Persons of that Order, and 4. the very Order it self (in submission to which
(when time was) they seemed to us, to live with a good conscience, and in a
comfortable Communion with their conforming Brethren) which has in effect
proved, the cutting off that Goodly Bough whereof themselves were Branches: not
considering, either how ill themselves take it, when any thing by others is
affirmed that contains in it but a Consequence which will condemn the Practice
of the Reformed Churches of these two last Centuries; or How ill a Physiognomie
the very outward Face of the Act caries, as of a Strife (managed even unto
Blood) for Chief Rooms in Synagogues, who should be the greatest, or have the
Greatest share in Exercising such parts of Christ's Priesthood as be concredited
to men; A thing flat contrary to the Precepts of Christ, and to the humility
of a Christian, whose only strife is, to prefer others in Honor before
Himself, and whose only Ambition is, to become like one of those little ones
that are weaned from the Breast. 4. That the volunteeres of the People, who
have improved the former Transgression of removing the Ancient Church-Marks
which our fathers had set, (rather the Fathers themselves set for Landmarks
and Guides) to a total Demolition; casting off the sons who had cast out their
Fathers, and the Branches which had plucked up their own Roots, and so
succeeding both as Augmenters and Revengers of the sin: especially that any
which among them pretend to the Fear of God and Love our Great High Priest,
should not scruple at all, to execrate all consecration of Persons to serve in
Christ's stead, and yet Dubb themselves officers; when as, God knows, they be
as far from Abilities to discharge as they are from Authority to undertake the
duty. The Catechizing of their own children and servants in their own private
Families, and whetting upon them the Confessed Duties of Christianity,
Humblness of mind, Meekness of Spirit, Purity of Heart etc. Being a task large
enough for Better Qualifications then the common sort of men, generally Have.
He that searches the hearts knows, This is not spoken out of envy at the
people of God. I could wish, all of them were Prophets, and my self the most
ignorant man in the world; (not that I would know less then I do, but have all
others know more then my self.) The sense of my deep unworthiness, to be
numbered among those that have obtained a less and lower part in the Ministry,
works a remorse for entering (though by the right Door, yet,) so praepropere
into it: and expresses from me this profession, That if it were now to do, I
should, happily, as Thales did in another case, either find my self too young a
novice, or too old a Doater, to put my shoulders under so formidable (though
honorable) a weight of trust and care.

10. When I have besought three of those sorts concerned in these particulars,
with all the Humility and meekness their charity can imagine in a Dissenting
Brother, and by the Bowels of mercy in our most Compassionate High Priest,
Redire ad Cor, to take these things into serious thoughts, without prejudging
their Conscience by and sinister considerations: and when I have made
supplication to the Almighty, who Commanded light to shine out Darkness, That A
Christian Reunion of hearts and minds may be the only Revenge and speedy
Conclusion of all our Differings; I shall proceed to another observation,
and'tis This.

That the eternal God should fix such a Notable Seal upon Christ's Priesthood as
His Oath is; That Saint Paul should be so Copious and Demonstrative in the
Argument as he is, And yet that there should be so little notice taken of it by
our Divines. I must profess both mine own ignorance in the Point, and mine
unacquaintedness with our English writers to be such, that were I, at the
writing hereof, Confined within a Circle till I had given in mine Answer to
this Question, [What English Divine had first writ about Christ's Priesthood?]
I must, See his 9. Book Printed 1638.
to my knowledge, say, This Author. From his former Book I had the first, and
from This a more full discovery of the Excellent Mysteries and Comforts
contained in it.

11. And though the wonder be the greater, that, there should be such a
Vacuitie or silence (about this High Business) among those whose every third
word, in their popular Discourses, is, The Lord Jesus Christ; who so profess
the Knowledge of Christ, as if (the Monopoly was engrossed in their Breasts) it
was to dye with them unless learned from them: Yet will it be much the less
wonderful, when it shall be considered; That some of the Doctrines of later
times, (Viz. That the Issues of life and death Everlasting are so past,
decreed, and sealed from Eternity, that no man ever had any possibility to
attain the Point opposite to that whereat he actually does arrive. That some
men's sins be remitted, not only before they be repented of, but before they
be Committed. etc.) Do by certain, though perhaps unwitting Consequences,
Render Christ's Priesthood useless and superfluous. For what need or use can
there be imagined of an Office or Agencie to procure that which cannot but be?
o^ to mediate for that, which is certainly, already dispatched? In such
supposed predetermination, Instrumentalitie may have place, Officiation can
have none.

12. But supposing (what I wish) Every Reader as well, or better affected to,
and more intelligent of the benefits of Christ's priesthood, then the prefacer
is, or the Author himself was; Yet is this no security, but Fault will be found
with the Author, for leading the Reader through a weary Wilderness, rather
then (per viam Compendij) by the nearest avenue of Approach to the Throne of
Our Most Gracious High Priest; by the long and Thornie ways of Questions about
Adam's First Estate, His Actual, our Original, Actual, and Habitual Sin, and
Servitude thereto; about the poor pittance or Scantling of Freewill left us: of
Mortification etc. Let me pray such an One to Consider, That it was as
impossible for the Author fruitfully to display the Benefits of Christ's
Priesthood, before he had treated of Those Particulars, as it is for the reader
to obtain those Benefits, which either Does not, or Cares not to understand
his own need of them. They that be whole will sooner seek to the Physician,
then he that has no sense of the venomous Taint, or Pestilential ulcer of sin
Original (which more or less is upon the Body, or in the flesh of every mothers
son, the purest Saint on Earth not excepted) will sue to Christ for Cleansing
therefrom. And yet is the daily washing of his feet. ( Pes, (...), and (...)
signify that part on which we bestow more abundant Comeliness and reverence.
See Muretus his variae Lect. Lib. 3. Cap. 14.
Feet in the fowlest sense) as needful to him that walks the cleanest and most
Circumspectly upon the face of the Earth, as is his daily Bread. And it is our
daily want of This Our most Gracious Highpriests Office that (till we see him
as He is) does best Commend The precious benefits, (Blessing and washing etc.)
to be received at His hands.

13. Well worth the labor, then, of this Great Author it was, to spend the
Five First Sections in handling those particulars, with purpose to make them a
Fair Introduction to the Main Point, The Priesthood of Christ. And not to
Dissemble with the Reader, perhaps He intended no more then Those Five for the
Ingredients or Consistencie of the Tenth Book. Purposing to subjoyn, all, or
most of those pieces which make up the Sixth Section (which be a company of
Elaborate and Choice Tracts) as an Appendix to, not as members of the Book. And
I had once thought to have Complied with mine own apprehension of this intended
Method, and put them in some place of neutralitie betwixt the Books; But when,
upon Consideration, I found that this Disposal would prove confusive and
inconvenient to the reader, at least, to him that had not a more Methodical
Head then my self, I resolved to place them as they now stand. And truly they
fall in so orderly, and so Decently indent with the precedent and following
Sections, that I repent me of nothing so much, in this work, as of some
marginal notes (which by these presents I revoke) inspersed here and there by
me, Timorous, (because I had the Copy dropping and by Piecemeal) that the
parts would not Symmetrize so well as I hope they will be found to Do.

14. And this I think was agreeable (in the General) to the Authors mind; who,
if he had made only the five first Sections, the Constitutives of the 10. Book,
and put what concerns The Priesthood in the 11. or elsewhere, would probably
have put them forth together; he having expressed himself to think it A Decorum
that the Plaster should go along with the sore. And the rather so, because he
intended (and he has been adaequate to his promise) to lance that festered
wound (or Complication of wounds) of Human Nature, deeper then most others had
done, which had treated, before him, of Sin Original, and Man's Servitude to Sin.

15. This Preface will be grown above the just stature of a Preface, when I shall
have told the Reader these 4. Particulars. 1. That of the Tracts now published,
diverse were written 15; others, 30. and more years ago. This will both give a
reason why in some of them The old Translation is used; and secure some
passages at which otherwise offense might be taken; which he that shall now do
(after he is told thus much) will Commend the Author by Falting him, and
enhance his words into the notion of prophecy. 2. That the reason why the
Authors 4. 5. 6. etc. Books were not printed in Sequence, is, because the
owner of the Copies may not as yet, without great damage, either consent that
another man should, or afford to do it Himself. So that we were enforced to
fall upon this Tenth; which may be more acceptable to the Reader, by being new,
and no less beneficial, seeing He may serve himself of the Quarto ones, which,
in the Interim, are parable. 3. And when God shall give opportunity to print
the Quarto's in this Volume, we must tell the Reader before hand, that the sixth
Book, of Divine Essence Attributes and Providence, will not administer to him
either the delight or the profit we intended, unless God move the hearts of
them that have the MS. Copy of the Treatise of Prodigies, or, Divine
Forewarnings betokening Blood: (which certainly was perfected by the Author,
and lent or lost in his life time) to produce it, that it may be annexed to the
sixth Book, to which of due it appertains. The 4. Particular will give the
Reader notice what Subject Matters he is to expect handled in the 11. Book. But
before we name them, he must be reminded, that the Author had in the 9. Book,
come as far as the Article of Christ's Ascension (reckoning Inclusive:) and in
the 39. Chapter of that Book, had tackt That Article to the next of His Session
at the Right Hand of God. Now the respective Ends or Effects of Christ's
Ascension into heaven, and of His Session at the Right Hand of Majesty, were
some of them of Immediate (and if I may so say, of a Transient) dispatch: And
such, I take it, were, His prepareing a place for his Elect Ones; His
Consecrating the heavenly Sanctuary, and setting open the Kingdom of Heaven to
all Believers, His sending the Holy Ghost in the Grace of comfort, and Gifts of
tongues, etc. Some are of constant Use, and continue in Esse unto this day, and
so shall unto the worlds end; as the Providential Government of His Church, and
the rest of the world in order to the affairs of his Church, which He
administers as Lord; and the Exercise of His Sacerdotal Office which he
executes as Christ: and some shall be manifested at the end of time and of this
sinful world, when He shall come in great power and Glory to Judge both quick
and dead. What this Author has said upon any of these Heads, in his Books
already printed, the Reader, if he will take the pains to search, may find. Of
the following Generals (with their incident and subordinate particulars) does
the Eleventh Book treat. Of Christ's Session at the Right Hand of God; the
Grammatical Sense of the words, and the Real Dignity answering to them, viz.
The Exaltation of Christ. And whether He was exalted as the Son of God, or, as
the Son of David. An excellent state of the question about Ubiquitie. Of
Christ's Lordship or Dominion. Of His Coming to Judgment. Of the Final Sentence
to be awarded by Him to All. Of the Resurrection of the Dead. From thence He
shall come to Judge the quick and the Dead.
Of Life Everlasting (not the merit of man, but) the Gift of God; and Death the
wages of sin. So that it is plain the Eleventh Book reflects upon, -- The
Resurrection of the Body, and Life Everlasting.
or resumes, the Article of Christ's Sitting at the Right Hand of God, and
withal proceeds to the Next, and to the Two last.

16. I Expect, the Intelligent Reader will Ask, where He may find handld, the
Articles concerning God the Holy Spirit; the holy Catholic Church, the
Communion of Saints; and the Forgiveness of Sins? I must referr the proposer of
this rational question (which deserves a better answer then I can give it) to
the Authors own words, [Which he may find in the first page of His Treatise Of
The Holy Catholic Faith and Church, which in the Catalogues of his Works, for
orders sake, is reckoned the 12. Book of his Commentaries, and whereof the
first part of three intended, was published. 1627. In my Comments on the Creed
(Says He) I did Sequester Four points from the Body of the Work: The First
was the Doctrine Of the most Holy and most Blessed Trinity, So he did intend
to Handle the Commandments, by way of Catechism.
to be set down by way of Prayer and Soliloquie not of Schoole-Dispute. The
Second, The Holy Catholic Church. The Third, The Communion of Saints. The
Fourth, The Remission of Sins. Points which I cannot Handle in that order they
be propounded in the Creed, without Interruption of my Method intended: --. So
that I have out of Choice, reserved these for peculiar Treatises --.] THE
AUTHORS Book then, of the Holy Catholic Faith and Church, it is more then
plain, The Holy Catholic Church.
referres to the Article of --. And for the rest of his Books, or Tracts
hereafter to be published, when they come abroad, they must bear some Tessera,
or Recognizance to signify their Retainance, or, to which of the 12. Christian
Predicaments they are to be reduced.

17. I have yet Two things to recommend unto the Reader. The One I humbly
present to the Consideration of the Nobility and Gentry of the Land, who have
the Honor and Blessing -- Longo Sanguine Censeri --. This Author (as his
manner all-a-long is, to open the Earth, and show the Out-Burst of the spring,
and leave the Well to be dug by him that means to dwell upon the Plat)
has, page 19. and 31. moved a Querie well worth their most exquisite
indagation and pursuit. It Is This: whether Parents (of both sexes) may not, by
frequent voluntary Commission of some sins, improve the Corruption of nature
in their Children, to an Height above the ordinary Taint descending from Adam,
or coming from Sin merely Original, and not intended by unnecessary affected
actual or habitual Transgressing? Would any of Them, now in this their privacie
or vacation, please, Philosophari, to think upon it, and Commend their
meditations to the world; they would be more acceptable and more imperative of
practice, Coming from themselves, and consequently be more Contributive to the
Revival of virtue unto an Heroical Degree.

18. The other is to those of the Clergy who teach the people Knowledge, and
for that end do seek acceptable words out of writings upright and True; (as for
the pretended Favorites of the Spirit, it is in vain to speak to them.) He that
has Compassion on the poor ignorant multitude (even destroyed for lack of
Knowledge of Principles contained in their Creed, Catechism etc.) And a mind to
tread in the Good Old way for Aedification of the poor of the Flock, may find
in this Authors Works, matter, proper for every Dominical and Festival through
the year, especially for the special ones, that is, those that Commemorate the
Great Benefits received by Christ. As also for occasions of Administering Both
Sacraments, marriages, Funerals, Fasts etc. But let me tell him, The Gold (he
is to find and beat out) does sometimes lie in so small a Compass, that unless he
observe well, he may overrun it. For an Experiment, he may see 1 grain taken
by me and beaten out into diverse Leaves. And for expounding Texts of Scripture,
this Author seems to have a felicity not ordinary. Oft-times, when he pretends
but to take One verse, he illuminates the Reader in the Epicycle of the
Context, nay in the next Orb, I mean the Parallel, be it in the old or new
Testament. But the Magisterium of his excellency is in Christologie, in the
display of the Mysteries of Christ, which he never thinks done, till he have
laid the Type and shadow upon the substance, and the Prophecy (as the Prophet
did his Body) upon the Event, Face to Face, Hand to Hand, Part to Part etc. And
his powerfulness in This has gotten him so deserved esteem amongst diverse
Learned men (though of different Judgment in some points) that in their works
they have quoted him as An Author.

19. What unworthy pains my self have taken about the work, in the space of 6.
or 7. Months, may be summed up in two lines. The falts of the Press be few and
small, yet I am not only to be blamed for them, not undertaking more then to
assist. Any Error in the notes, marginal or final, is to be imputed to my
weakness. For the Authors Text, I have not in the least degree altered,
intended, or remitted his sense, in any one Assertion, or point of Doctrine.
But, which is the Duty of an Editour, have been Scrupulously Careful to
deliver his Work as he left it and meant it, not attending to gratify either
mine own or the Readers opinions.

20. What Fate abides (either my self, or) this Orphan-Book, is only known to
God. It is, of this Authors Works, for number, the Tenth, for bulk, larger then
the most, for learning, Equal, and for Excellency of subject matter, superior
to any of the other Nine: (for it is, Of the Knowledge of our selves Servants
to sin: And of the Son of God, by the exercise of His Everlasting Priesthood,
making us Free from sin.) And so in just Decorum, as it affords Royal Dainties,
so it deserves the Choicest Patronage that any of his fellows had, even of such
as have Right to Receive Tithes: yet seeing it so falls out, by the ever to be
Adored and admired providence of God, that such it may not have now; It comes
forth under the more Immediate Patronage of the Almighty, God the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Spirit. Especially (I pray) under the most Auspicious
shelter of Him whose Office it describes and defends, The Apostle and
High Priest of our Profession, the Great Shepherd, King, and Bishop of our
souls, Jesus Christ our Lord. He give it favor in the Eyes of the Reader, and
prosper it to those Ends for which the Author writ it, and as the Prefacer
wishes it:

Who is the most unworthy of all those that share in His Office. B. O.

terminated to the Abstract Entities or Substances of men. 37. Concerning the
Limitation of these Two Propositions, Romans 8. 13. [1. If ye live after the
slesh ye shall dye.] [2. If through the spirit ye do mortify the deeds of the

Of the Acts or Exercises of Christ's Everlasting Priesthood. CHAP. 43.
Concerning the Manner or means by which the Son of God does now, de Facto,
through the continual Exercise of his Everlasting Priesthood in his heavenly
Sanctuary, set Free indeed all such as seek for the working out of their own
Salvation with fear and trembling. page 3252. 44. The Coherence of the eighth
Chapter to the Hebrews with the seven precedent, and two following. The exact
Proportions or Parallels betwixt the mundane Tabernacle with the two
Sanctuaries therein, and the Caelestial with those in it; betwixt the Manner or
Rites in the Consecration of the One and the Other: Betwixt the Highpriests of
the Old Testament, and Christ our only High Priest of the New, intimated in
this, explicated in the following Chapters. 3253. 45. That the souls of
Righteous men Abraham etc. Were in a Blissful heavenly Mansion before: But
after The Kingdom of Heaven was perfectly set up and open to all Believers By
Christ's Placing As man at the Right Hand of God, Their Condition was bettered.
3255. 46. A Parallel betwixt the Rites of Dedicating The Tabernacle, the
vessels, etc. with Blood of Beasts, And of Consecrating The Heavenly Places
with the most Precious Blood of Jesus Christ. 3257. 47. Before the fuller
draught of that Parallel [If the Blood of Bulls -- and the Ashes of an Heifer
--. much more the Blood of Christ --.] treated on in the Two next Chapters, The
Apostles Translating the Hebrew word [Berith] by (...), is showed to be, not a
mere Allusion, but of strict Propriety. 3259. 48. The Parallel between the
most Solemn Services of the Law, and the One Sacrifice of Christ, and The high
Praeeminence and Efficacy of This in comparison of Those. The Romanists
Doctrine [That in the Mass Christ's Body is identically Carnally present, and
that there is a proper Sacrifice Propitiatory offered,] derogates from the
Absolute Perfection of Christ's offering himself Once for all. 3261. 49. That
the Foreign mainteiners of the more then Fatal Irrespective Rigid Decree make
Christ Jesus rather a mere Sacrifice Then a True Everlasting Priest acting for
us and daily working out our Reconciliation to God. So do such as teach [That
the sins of some were Remitted before they were Committed.] Of the
Superexcellency of Christ's Priesthood and One Sacrifice in Comparison of the
Aaronicall Pr. and the Many Serv^ces thereof. 3266. 50. The Raritie of That
Rite of Consecrating the Water of Sprinkling by the Ashes of the Red Heyfer, an
Emblem of Baptism and the Singularity thereof. Our Churches meaning in some
Expressions at the Administration of That Sacrament. 3270. 51. Inordinate
Liberty of Prophesying brought Errors into the Church and hindered the
Reformation. 3273. 52. That Justification Consists not in One Single Act. In
what sense, Fides est Fiducia, is True. 3276. 53. Christ's Parable (Math. 12.
43. etc.) applied. Two degrees of Reconciliation, the First Active (or but mere
Grammatically Passive.) The Other Reall-Passive: So Correspondently, Two
Branches of Justification. The One from Christ's Death, the Other from the
benefit of His Priesthood daily participated to us. 3277.
SECT. VIII.
Of Errors disparaging Christ's Priesthood. CHAP. 54. Three Errors disparaging
Christ's Priesthood. 1. The Novatian denying the Reception of some sort of
sinners. 2. Alate Contrary Error, affirming, That Every sin which some sort of
Men Committ is pardoned before it be committed. 3. The Romish Doctrine of the
Mass, giving Scandal to the Jew. All of them respectively derogating from the
infinite Value or Continual Efficacy of Christ's Everlasting Priesthood. 3280.
55. From the Text Hebr. 10. 1, 2, 16, 17. and from this Maxim, [That Christ's
One Sacrifice of himself was of Value absolutely infinite;] it follows not,
That such as worship God in spirit, or such as are received into the Covenant
of Grace have their sins remitted before they commit them. That Doctrine makes
Christ's Resurrection Useless (in respect of us) and our Baptism needless. Legal
worshipers Conscious, and their sins remembered in such sort as Evangelical
worshippers are not. The Vast odds betwixt Christ's One Sacrifice, and the Many
legal. We must distinguish betwixt the Infinite Value and Infinite Virtue of
Christ's Sacrifice. The precious Effects of H. Baptism, and the Eucharist
flowing from the Efficacy of Christ's Sacrifice and Priesthood. How Legal
Sacrifices, etc. prefigured Christ's. 3292. 56. The Efficacy of Christ's
Sacrifice, and the Use of His Priesthood, two distinct several things. Wherein
the Exercise of his Priesthood does Consist. How it was foreshadowed.
Ordinances Effectual by Virtue of Christ's Presence. Vertual Presence is a Real
Presence. 3301.

A TREATISE OF The Primaeval estate of the First Man. Of the Manner how Sin
found Entrance into, and is Propagated in the World. Of the Nature of Sin. Of
our First Servitude to it. Of that poor Remnant of Free Will left in the Sons
of Adam, with directions to use it aright, and how we are set Free by the Son
of God. Of Mortification. Of the Right use of Reason, or Rules of Art, for
determining doubts in Divinity, etc.
IT was a very wise saying of One, who (if we may approve Julius Scaliger's
Censure of him) was none of the Wisest Doctors, Cardanus in Lib. De V^ili. tate
ex adversis capiend^.
Tract are res Humanas norunt Plurimi, aestimare Paucissimi. To attain unto a
large measure of Skill or Cunning, whether in contriving or managing Mundane or
merely Humane Affairs, is a matter more easy and more common, then to be able
to set a just Price or Estimate, whether upon the things or Works themselves,
or upon the Artificers Skill in Contriving or working them. This Maxim is
altogether as true, The general Contents or full Scope of this whole Work.
and somewhat more Improvable in Businesses Sacred, especially in such as have
been heretofore handled in part, and come now to be further discussed. The
First Part of the KNOWLEDGE of JESUS CHRIST and of Him Crucified, Raised from
the Dead, etc. is a great deal more easily learned, then the Second, unto which
these present Meditations are addressed. The First Part of this Heavenly
Knowledge consists principally in the display of the Harmony between the
Prophetical, and Evangelical Writings, or the Parallels between Matters of Fact
recorded in the Old Testament, and the Events answering in Proportion to them
in the New, already exhibited, and further to be accomplished before the end of
this World, or in the World to come.

2. The Second Part of the KNOWLEDGE of CHRIST consists in the true Estimate or
Experimental Valuation of his Death and Sufferings, of his Resurrection from
the Dead, and Exercise of his Everlasting Sacerdotal Function. To this later
part of the Knowledge of Christ and him Crucified, etc. that Knowledge which in
Philosophy, or in other Sciences we call a Posteriori; that is, which we
gather from the Effect, or learn by Experience, does answer in a true kind of
subproportion. Unto this Second Part of the Knowledge of Christ, somewhat more
is required then has been expressed in the Former Part; betwixt which and
those Scientifical Conclusions in Sciences which we call a Priori, there is
perfect Analogy or Correspondency; Somewhat, or a great deal more, then such
Knowledge of God and of his Providence, as most of the Schoolmen or
Historians, whether Ecclesiastical or Secular, do present unto us.

3. Cyprian. The knowledge of our selves, the best method to know God or Christ.
Vt Deum cognoscas (says an Ancient and Pious Father) Teipsum prius cognosce:
we must learn to know our selves before we can attain unto the true or perfect
knowledge of God, whether as He is our Creator, our Redeemer, or our
Sanctifier. And this true knowledge of our selves has a double Aspect, the one
unto the Estate from which, the other unto the Estate into which we are fallen.
The chief, if not the only Reason, Why the Godhead or Eternal Sonship of
Christ Jesus, is, in this last Age, questioned; Why his Meritorious
Satisfaction for the Sins of the World, is by some flatly denied, is, Because
the Parties this way peccant, or such as can with Christian patience or without
disgust, read or hear their Discourses, do not know themselves either in the
Individual, as they are Mortal Men and tainted with many Actual Sins, or in the
General, as they are the Sons of Adam. They understand not the Prerogatives
that Man had in his first Creation above other Creatures; nor yet trouble their
thoughts, How that which They and We call Sin, found first Entrance into the
World; How it has been propagated throughout all Mankind; or what be the
special Properties, the true Effects, or Power of it. Now without the Knowledge
or serious Consideration of all these Points, it is impossible for Us, for any
Man, to take a true, much less a full or competent Estimate of Christ's
Sufferings upon the Cross; or of the Efficacy of his Resurrection from the
Dead; of the Fruits of the Spirit, which he promised to all his Followers, upon
his Ascension into Heaven, and sitting at the Right Hand of God the father.

SECT. I.
Of the First Man's Estate, and the Manner How He lost it. How Sin found
Entrance into the World. Of the Nature of Sin. How it was, and is, propagated
unto Adam's Posterity.
CHAP. I.
Of the Primaeval Estate of the First Man, and of the variety of Opinions about
it.
1. More Contention then Contradiction about the First Man's Estate.
ABout the Prerogatives or Praeeminences of the First Man, over and above all
others, which by Natural Descent have sprung from him, a great variety of
Opinions there is; more then is about the Limitation or Extent of the
Prerogative Royal in most Kingdoms Christian, as now they stand. But the
several Opinions contained within this great and spacious variety, concerning
the Estate or Prerogatives of the First Man, are (in my opinion) very
compatible: Few or none of them contradict others. And it is the Part of
Divines by Profession, not to sow any seeds of contention between the Authors
or Abetters of several Opinions, which in their nature imply no Contradiction.
Yea in times Ancient and unpartial, it has been accounted one special part of
Priests or Professed Divines, to solicit or Mediate for Compromise between
Parties at difference, whether in Matters Civil or Criminally Capital; much
more to Endeavor for Reconciliation of Opinions or Controversies properly
belonging to their own profession.

2. Now it is confessed by all good Christians, that the First man was made,
in, or according to, the Image of God, which made him. But wherein this Image
of God, or the Live Copy of it exhibited in the First Man, did properly or
chiefly consist, is a Problem wherein Many good Writers. both Ancient and
Modern, do sowmewhat Vary. Some would have the Prerogatives, which did result
from the likeness of God imprinted upon the First Man, to consist principally
in that Power or Dominion which He had over all other visible or sublunary
Creatures. But though it be true of these present times as it was of former,
That Dominium non fundatur in Fide, id est, Kings and Supreme Governors have
their Right of Dominion over their Subjects or Inferiors, albeit such Kings and
Governors, have not at any time been true Christians, or have degenerated from
such Christian Faith as they have sometimes professed or maintained: yet
without all controversy, that Sovereignty or Dominion, which the First Man had
over all other visible Creatures, was founded upon that Integrity of soul, or
Righteousness inherent, which He lost. Since the First Man and his Successors,
became Corrupt in all their ways; that Primaeval Dominion which the First Man
had, did cease by Degrees to be so entire, as once it was: Nor is there any
Hope to have it fully restored unto any Sovereignty, or prvate Members of any
Sovereignty or Kingdom in this Life. Nor are all they, which well agree in this
General [That the First Man's Similitude with his Maker, did radically and
punctually consist in Righteousness and Integrity of Soul and Body] at so fair
accord among themselves, Wherein this Righteousness or Integrity did properly
or formally consist; or of what Rank or Order it was.

CHAP. II.
Wherein the Righteousness of the First Man did Consist.
1. Original righteousness no supernatural Grace.
MAny Great Divines or Doctors heretofore have been, and some, or rather Many,
to this day, there be, who peremptorily determine, and would persuade Others,
either by their Authority, or by Reason, to believe; That the Righteousness of
the First Man did formally consist in a peculiar Grace, Supernatural, even to
Him. If this Opinion were true, the same Grace should have been more then
Supernatural to his successors; supposing that they continued by natural
propagation, in the same State and Condition wherein the First Man was Created.
To maintain this opinion; That the Righteousness or Integrity of the First Man
did consist in a supernatural Grace, the Romish Church (specially since the
publishing of the Canons of the Trent Council) is deeply engaged. For unless
this Postulatum or Supposition be granted; Many Dogmatical Resolutions which
the whole Christian World, is, by the Romish Church, bound to believe sub
poenae Anathematis, that is, under penalty of that Churches solemn Curse or
everlasting Damnation, cannot possibly, or with any Mediocrity of Probability
be maintained. The Points of Belief which from this Postulatum or supposition.
[That the Righteousness wherein the First Man was Created, was a Grace
Supernatural] might with some probability be maintained, are principally these.

2. First, That, Sin, which we and the Romish Church call Original, should be
no more then a mere Privation of Original Justice, Of the Inconveniences which
will follow upon the affirmative Opinion.
that is, of that Image of God wherein the First Man was Created. But the
Ingenuous Reader will perhaps demand, what further Inconvenience will follow upon
the yielding or granting of the former Postulatum or Supposition unto them?
This in the Second place; That Adams Successors whether immediate or
intermediate unto the worlds End should have a greater measure of that which
they call Liberum Arbitrium or Free Will, then the word of God does
acknowledge; or any Ingenuous Man, that will subjugate his Reason to be
Regulated by the written word, or Ancient Rules or Canons of Faith, can allow
or approve. This deduction following is clear by Rules of Reason, viz. [ If the
Righteousness of the First Man did consist in a Grace Supernatural, or in any
quality additional to his constitution, as he was the Work of God: This Grace
or Quality might have been, or rather, was lost, without any Real wound unto
our Nature; Or without any other Wound, then such as the Free Will, or right
use of Reason, or other Natural parts (which after the loss this of supposed
Supernatural Grace or Quality were left) might instantly have cured, or yet may
cure.] Or in other terms (more Scholastical perhaps) Thus: If the Integrity or
Righteousness of the First Man, were lost, only, demeritorie, by way of
Demerit, without any physical or working cause of its expulsion, or without any
wound made in our nature, by such positive cause: The same Righteousness which
the First Man had, might have been regained by the right use of Reason which
was left unto him, or of those natural faculties which he had pro prima vice
abused. From these premises the necessary consequence will be this; That the
satisfaction of our Lord Christ, for sin (original at least) had been
superfluous. And according to this Tenet, the Opinion of the Socinians would be
more tolerable, and more justifiable, then the Doctrine of the Romish Church,
so far as it concerns the Value or Efficacy of Christ's Sufferings, or
Satisfaction by his Merits, or Justification by works, rather then by faith,
especially works of the Moral Law, or observance of those two great
Commandments, To love God above all; and, our Neighbors as our Selves: or of
that other, whatsoever you would that men should do unto you, even so do unto
them.

3. Lastly, if all or any of these Opinions were granted, to the Church of
Rome: we of Reformed Churches should be concluded to yield; That Adams
posterity, or as many of them as are, or shall be, justified, were to be
Formally justified by inherent Righteousness; that is, they have, or might
challenge, absolution, from the first sentence denounced against Adam, by way
of legal plea or satisfaction. The deduction or remonstration of this
demonstrative inference, is clear to any Artist, to any reasonable man, unless
his Reason be overgrown by faction, or by mingling of passions with his
understanding. The Remonstration of this demonstrative inference is thus: It is
in confesso, and more then so, an undoubted Maxim subscribed unto by the Church
of Rome; That the grace which is infused by and from our Lord Jesus Christ, is
a supernatural quality, or a qualification more sovereign, then the first grace
which God the Father bestowed upon the First Man. Now, if that Grace were a
super addition to his Nature, or Constitution, as he was the work of God; the
loss of this Grace or quality could not have made any wound in the humane
Nature, which the least drop of that Grace, which daily distilleth from the
second Adam, might not more then fully cure. Yea, such grace would sublimate
our Nature so cured, unto an higher pitch or fuller measure of Righteousness,
then that, which was bestowed upon our Father Adam. In respect of these and
many other Reasons, which might be alleged, all such Congregations or
Assemblies of Christian Men, as have departed, or have been extruded, out of
the Romish Church, stand deeply engaged, to deny, that the Righteousness of
the First Man was a Grace or quality supernatural.

CHAP. III.
Whether Original Righteousness were a quality Natural, or a mean betwixt
Natural and supernatural.
1. TO affirm that, the Righteousness wherein the First Man was created was a
gift rather Natural then supernatural, would be no solaecisme: no assertion any
way more incongruous, then many Resolutions of the Roman Doctors in like Cases
are: no grosser blemish or deeper impression then might easily be salved or
wiped off with that distinction, usual amongst them, in other the like or
rather the same Cases: The true state of the Question proposed.
[That the righteousness wherein Adam was created was natural, quoad terminum
productum, non quoad modum productionis; A natural Endowment in respect of the
essential quality produced; albeit the manner of producing it were somewhat
more then supernatural. But this is a dispute which for the present shall be
waved, because the Original difference betwixt us and them may be more
punctually stated, and the Questions dependent on it, may be more clearly
resolved from these Postulata or presumed Maxims: First, [That God did make the
First Man after his own image.] Secondly, [That the First man being so made,
was righteous and just.] Neither of these are denied by any. The state of the
Original Controversy unto such as are disposed to have it plainly propounded
in constant or unfleeting Terms, is thus; [Seeing man was made after the image
of God, and being so made, was just and righteous; Whether there were two works
of God or two distinct effects of his work of creating the First Man in
righteousness and in his own image: And whether the one of them was terminated
to his own image imprinted in man, and the other to his original justice.] If
these two expressions made by Moses of Gods image and man's righteousness,
express or include no more then one and the same work of God, or effect of his
work in man: The loss of Original justice or defacing of Gods image enstamped
upon him, was more then a mere privation, and necessarily presupposes a
positive Cause in our First Parents, and a positive Effect wrought by that
cause whereunto the privation of Original justice was Concomitant or rather
Consequent. Whatsoever Controversy may be moved concerning the Cause or manner
how this Effect was wrought: the effect it self was a deadly wound in our
Nature; a multitude of wounds, all by Nature or any endeavor of Nature or
performances of such Free will as was left to mankind after these wounds were
once made, altogether incurable, without the help or assistance of better Grace
or endowments then were bestowed upon the First Man. The cure of these wounds
wholly depends upon that grace whose Being and bestowing the second Adam did
merit from the Father of Lights, or from the Divine nature or Deity.

2. To win the Assent of every Rational Christian man unto the former part of
this determination; [That Original justice did consist in that image of God
wherein the First man was created, and did not imply any other work of God
whether preccdent or consequent, besides the special work of his creation:] no
other Argument is either necessary or so available, as the taking of the words
of Moses, where he describes the manner how the First man was created, into
serious consideration. For Original Justice had more Essential dependence upon
the image of God in Man, then Rotunditie has with a Sphere; or Globositie with
a Globe. Now in the making of a Sphere or body perfectly round, there be not
two works, nor two distinct effects of the Artificers skill; one in making a
Round-Body, another in making Rotunditie. And it is a grosser Soloecism in
Divinity to say or think, that the Image of God in man was One work of God, and
Original Justice Another, then it would be to maintain that the Rotundity of a
Sphere, and the Sphere, are two works of the same hand, severally intended by
the Artificer which makes the Sphere.

3. To evince the later part of the former Assertion; Original sin more then a
mere privation.
[That Original sin is more then a mere Privation; more then a mere want of
Original Justice; a multiplicity of wounds or diseases in our nature:] any man
living which has so much memory or reason as to reflect upon his own
disposition or untowardlinesse in his childhood; or skill to contemplate the
Estate or condition of poor Infants, will easily subscribe unto that great
Roman Naturalists judgment or observations, Pliny.
in his Preface to the seventh book of his natural History, to be insisted upon
hereafter when we come to treat of the Symptoms or properties of sin Original.
The next Inquiry according to the Method proposed is, How sin did enter into
the world.

CHAP. IV.
Of the manner how Sin found Entrance into the works of God, and did seize upon
all mankind, The Man Christ Jesus only excepted.
1. No Creature from the first moment of its Creation was altogether impeccable.
THe highest Offer of any which I have read for the resolution of this Problem,
is that inquisition made by some Schoolmen, [An dari possit creatura
impeccabilis, so they render the Greek (...).] The problem in distinct and
plain English is thus. [Whether it be possible according to the Rules of
Reason, that any created substance should be from its creation totally secured
or absolutely freed from all possibility of falling into sin.] Some of the
Ancient and most Orthodoxal Fathers of the Church, as their opinions are
alleged by some Schoolmen, stand for the Negative Part of this Problem, to
wit, [That it is not possible for any mere Creature to be from the moment or
first time of his creation altogether impeccable, or secured from all
possibility of falling into sin.] But whether the reasons or expressions of
these Ancient Fathers will reach home, or amount unto the Tenants of such
Schoolmen as avouch, not only their reasons, but Authority, is not so clear;
but that the discussion whether of their Authorities, Meanings, or Expressions,
might breed more quarrels then the Schoolmen have already begun. However; The
disputes already moved about this Point, must in the first place be restrained
to mere Creatures rational, that is, to Angels and Men. The Rational
Creature, or son of man, who is likewise the Son of God, must be exempted from
this enquiry And this Additional must in the second place be admitted; [Whether
it were possible that any man or Angel could be perpetually freed from all
possibility of falling into sin, and have been withal from the first moment of
his creation intrinsecally just and righteous.

2. That Men and Angels might (by the power of God, or special contrivance of
his Providence) have been secured from all possibility of falling into sin, is
a Position amongst rational men unquestionable: But it is not so, whether men
or Angels being so secured from all possibility of sinning could have been
intrinsecally or formally righteous, or by the eternal rules of Justice and
Equity it self, truly capable of everlasting punishments or torments, or of joy
and happiness everlasting. The Negative part of this Problem is in my
judgment far more probable then the Affirmative. For if the First-man, or
Angels which fell, had been either by the power of their Almighty Creator, or
by the undefeatable contrivance of his wisdom, absolutely freed from all
possibility of sin from the first creation unto this day, they could neither
have deserved any great blame or praise by continuing after this manner
righteous or conformable to the divine nature for integrity of life. The case
of the First-man, if he had lived to this instant without sin by such
contrivance or necessitating guidance of Gods providence, had been the same, as
if the child whiles his master leads his hand should write a Fair Copy, being
otherwise unable to cast a letter aright when his masters hand should betaken
off from his. Now if the Child or young Clerk should not in good time learn to
cast his letters or draw his lines aright, he could not pretend any title to
commendation or reward, how well so ever his work were performed; the whole
praise would of right belong unto the manuduction or guidance of his Master.
But if the young Clerk growing stronger, should disturb or wrest the hand of
his guide awry, or not suffer him to rule his hand as before he had done: by
thus doing he would deserve both blame and correction.

3. Our father Adam in his first Estate had a great deal more power to
regulate his own thoughts and actions by the ordinary Guidance of Gods
Providence, then a child has either to cast his Letters or draw his Lines
aright by the sight of a Copy or ordinary direction of his master. Yet this
same First Man had a power withal to neglect the guidance, or slight the
directions of his Creator; a power much greater to do both these ways amiss,
then a child has to refuse or resist the Manuduction of his writingMaster. By
the First woman's ignorance or contempt, through her husbands negligence or
inadvertence to that First and Great Commandment, which was given to both of
them [Of the tree in the middle of the garden ye shall not eat etc.] that which
we call Original sin, or the maine root of all sins, found entrance into the
visible world, that is, into the nature of man. The extract of what we have
said, or have to say, Concerning this point, is very well set down by St.
Austine and some others of the Ancients; [That the First Man was truly endowed
with a Free Will or power, not to have sinned at all: That if he had used this
power aright, or implored the assistance of his Creator in competent time, for
so using it; he should have been endowed with a perpetual immunity from sin:
that is; Albeit he was not from his Creation either by nature or by
supernatural endowment utterly impeccable; yet by the assistance and benignity
of his Gracious Creator, he might have attained unto such a perpetual estate
or immunity from falling into sin.]

4. The question about merit of works, no way concerns the First man in his
primaeval Estate.
Suppose he had preserved or employed the Talent concredited unto him at his
first creation, aright: should the superaddition or crowning of his First
Estate with perseverance, have been a mere gift of grace, or rather a kind of
merit? This is a Question not very pertinently moved by some Schoolmen, and
the Contradictory to their determination more inconsiderately maintained by
some modern Disputants or Logical Critics. For seeing Adam received that great
Talent concredited to him in his creation, not absolutely, or to use it as he
pleased, but at his peril or under express penalty, that if he misimployed it,
or contemned his Commandment which bestowed it upon him, he should dye the
death: it is no way improbable, that if he had improved his Talent for some
competent time, that the state wherein he was created should have been
hereditary to him and his; not by such free Grace as is bestowed upon us under
the Gospel, but by way of Merit de congruo; though not according to
Commutative, yet to Distributive Justice, rather then by mere Mercy or
benignity. But this opinion I vent not with any intention to move or abett
disputes or controversies already moved about this curious Question; but rather
to persuade the Reader, that all questions concerning the Merits of works, or
of perseverance in that Grace by which all good works are wrought, must be
reduced, or confined to the estate or condition of mankind since Adams Fall.
Of which Question thus stated or limited, I shall (I hope) be able to give the
Reader, or any that will soberly dispute or conferr with me in it, better
satisfaction, Viva voce, then this Treatise without digression will permit me
to do. The principal Points in it, or which I had in my thoughts either to
prosecute or propose, The First man was neither necessitated to continue good,
nor to become Evil.
are these following.

First, That albeit the First man were by virtue of Creation righteous and
just, yet were neither his perseverance or non-perseverance in this
righteousness absolutely necessary; both of them possible. That both were
possible has been declared at Large before in the sixth book of Commentaries
upon the Creed: In the 2 Part, 2 Sect. Chap. 13. etc. of the Attributes.
unto which I referr the Ingenuous Reader, where he may find this proposition
(as I take it) demonstrated; [That to decree or appoint a mutual or reciprocal
Possibility between our First Parents perseverance or non-perseverance was
Facible to the Omnipotent Creator, because it neither implies nor presupposes
any Contradiction in Terminis.] And whatsoever effect or praenotion answerable
unto it implies no Contradiction either in it self or to the Goodness of the
Divine Nature or Deity, is Facible by Power Omnipotent: that is, The Almighty
Creator might have decreed, or yet may decree it when he pleases.

The Second Principle or supposition in this place to be handled is; [Whether
the Almighty Creator did de Facto decree or ordain that neither the
Perseverance or non-perseverance of the First Man or of our First Parents,
should be absolutely Necessary, but contingent.] Or, in other terms thus; [That
the Estate or condition wherein they were created might have continued to this
day for them and their successors undefeatable.] That their Perseverance or the
perseverance of their Posterity in the state of Righteousness wherein they
were created, was not necessary by any Divine Ordinance or decree, is clear
from the Event; because the First man and the First woman did fall de Facto
from that Estate wherein they were created, which neither of them could have
done, if their First Estate had been by virtue of the Almighties Decree or any
ordinance from him Immutable, or absolutely Necessary. But can it be as
strongly proved, That the fall of our first Parents, or their eating of the
Forbidden Fruit did not proceed from any necessitating Decree, or undefeatable
contrivance of the Almighty Creators Wisdom? To persuade men which have not
their senses exercised in points of Logical or Scholastic disputes, that the
Fall of our First Parents was not necessary, no, not in respect of the Divine
Decree or ordinance, would be a harder task, then to prove that their
Perseverance was not in respect of that Decree, necessary. That our First
Parents did fall from their Estate, is a Question of Fact of which every honest
good man may be a competent Judge, at least able enough to resolve himself. But
whether it was as possible for them not to have fallen, as it was to fall, is
Question Juris, or more then so, a point of Metaphysical or Theological
disquisition; wherein it would be very hard to find a Grand Jury of Professed
Divines in any one County almost throughout this Kingdom, which could be
competent Judges or fit Inquisitors: Not that they want either skill or
industry for interpreting sacred Scripture, which is the only true rule of
Faith and manners, aright; but for want of skill or memory in Secular Arts, how
to examine or determine what Consequences or inferences are consonant or
dissonant to the undoubted Rule of Faith, or to the unquestionable Maxims
contained in it. For deciding or waiving such Controversies as are emergent not
so much out of the sense of Scriptures, as out of such Inferences or
Consequences (whether negative or affirmative) as contentious or unresolved
spirits would fasten upon it, Recta ratio, that is, Reason regulated by Rules
of unquestionable Arts or Sciences, is the most competent Judge. That there is
but one God and one Lord; That the only God is a God of Goodness and wills no
wickedness, are positive points of Faith and Christian Belief; Fundamental
Maxims in Theology. To dispute or move any question directly about the truth
or limitation of these Maxims, would be a branch of Infidelity, or, which
perhaps is worse, an approach to Blasphemy.

CHAP. V.
Of the Right use of Reason, or Rules of Art for determining Controversies in
Divinity, whereof the Sacred Scripture is the sole Rule.
1. Of the use of Arts in discussing Controversies in Theology.
BUt admit this Maxim, [There is but one God, and he a God of Goodness, no
Author or abetter of evil] were undoubtedly believed by all: Yet this inference
or Consequence might be (as it has long time been) controversed; Whether he
that avoucheth [This only God to have decreed the Fall of the First Man to have
been necessary or inevitable,] might be demonstratively convinced to make him
the Author and Cause, the only Cause of the First Man's sin, and of all the sins
which necessarily issue from it, or from the Nature of man corrupted by it. For
the full resolution of this Question, the Sacred Scriptures are not the sole
Competent Judge or Rule. Nor does the determination of it belong to the
Cognizance of such as are the best Interpreters of Sacred writ, for the true
Grammatical or Litteral sense of every proposition contained in it. This Case
must be reserved to the Schools of Arts, or to the certain Rules of true Logic
and Philosophy, which are the best guides of Reason in all discursive
faculties. But here I am engaged to do that which in other cases I have
endeavored to avoid; that is, to make repetition of two great Problems in the
Science or Faculty of Theology, heretofore in their several places handled,
and in some ensuing meditations to be hereafter inculcated. The first Problem
is [In what sense or with what limitations the Scripture is held by all
reformed Churches, to be the only Rule of Faith:] The Second, [In what sense or
how far it is true, that Recta ratio, Reason rectified or rightly managed, may
be admitted a competent Judge in Controversies belonging to the Faculty of
Theology.]

2. To the First Problem, [In what sense the Scripture is held by us to be the
sole and competent Rule of Faith and manners,] I have no more to say for the
present, then has been long ago published in the second book of these
Commentaries upon the Apostles Creed, Sect. 1. Chap. 11. The sum of all in
that place delivered, is, to my best remembrance, This: No Christian is bound
to admit or receive any Doctrine or proposition, as an Article of his Faith,
unless it be contained in the Old or New Testament, either Totidem verbis, or
may be Concludently or Demonstratively deduced from some Sacred Maxim or
proposition expressly contained in the Canonical Books in the Old and New
Testament. Such Maxims as are expressly and plainly contained in Scripture,
Every Christian Man is bound to believe absolutely. But such propositions or
Conclusions as may be demonstratively inferred from Canonical unquestionable
Maxims, they only are bound absolutely to believe which have so much use of
Reason or skill in Arts, as may enable them clearly to discern the Necessity of
the Consequence, or concludent Proof of the Deduction. The ignorant or
illiterate are only bound to believe such Deductions Conditionally, See the
second Book, chap. 2. and chap. 4, etc.
or to practice according to their Teachers instructions, with such
Reservation, or under such Conditions as have been expressed in the second and
third Book of these Commentaries.

3. But what Propositions, though expressly contained in Scriptures, be Negative
or Affirmative; Universal, Indefinite, Particular, or Singular; Or how any or
all of these be Convertible, whether Absolutely, by Accident, or by
Contraposition; or how to Frame a perfect Syllogism out of them; These or the
like are points which the holy Ghost, who spoke by the Prophets and other
Penmen of Sacred and Canonical Writ, did never undertake or profess to teach.
The discussion or determination of Questions of this nature must be had from
the Rules of Reason, sublimated or regulated by good Arts or faculties. And for
the bettering or Advancing of Natural Reason in this search, the most learned
or most sanctified Christian this day living, should be very unthankful to the
only Lord his Redeemer and Sanctifier, if he do not acknowledge it as an
especial branch of his All-seeing Providence in raising up unto the World such
Lights of Nature and Guides of Reason as Aristotle, Plato, and others of the
Ancient Philosophers were. True Reason in whomsoever seated, Whether in the
Natural or Regenerate man, unless it be advanced and guarded by such Rules of
Arts, as these Sages of the old World have by Gods Providence invented or
bettered, can be no fit Judge; but being so advanced and guarded, is the most
Competent Judge of Controversies in Divinity; of such Controversies, I mean, as
arise from Consequences or Deductions, made by way of use or application out of
the uncontroverted Maxims of sacred Writ. And if we would sequester Grammatical
or Rhetorical Pride, and partiality to the several Professions wherein
respectively men glory, we might easily discern, all or most of those unhappy
Controversies which have set the Christian World for these late years in
Combustion, to have been hatched, maintained, and nourished by such pretended
Favorites of the Spirit, as either never had faithfully Learned any true
Logic, Philosophy, or ingenuous Arts, or else had utterly forgotten the Rules
which they had learned or heard, before they begun to handle controversies in
Theology, or entertain disputes about them.

4. Obliquity can have no other Cause beside that which is the Cause of the Act
whence it necessarily results.
The Hypothesis, for whose clearer discussion these last Theses have been
premised, is this; [Whether it being once granted or supposed, that the
Almighty Creator was the Cause either of our mother Eves desire, or of her
Actual Eating of the Forbidden Fruit, or of her delivery of it to her husband,
or of his taking and eating it, though unawares; the same Almighty God must not
upon like Necessity be acknowledged to be the Author of all the Obliquities
which did accompany the positive Acts, or did necessarily result from them.]
This is a Case or Species Facti which we cannot determine by the Rule of Faith:
It must be tried by the undoubted Rules of Logic, or better Arts. These be the
only perspective Glasses which can help the Eye of Reason to discover the truth
or necessity of the Consequence; to wit, [Whether the Almighty Creator, being
granted to be the Cause of our Mother Eves first Longing after the forbidden
Fruit, were not the Cause or Author of her sin.] Now unto any Rational man that
can use the help of the forementioned Rules of Arts (which serve as prospective
Glasses unto the Eye of Reason) that usual Distinction between the Cause or
Author of the Act, and the Cause or Author of the Obliquity which necessarily
ensues upon the Act, will appear at the first sight to be False or Frivolous;
yea, to imply a manifest Contradiction. For Obliquity, or whatsoever other
Relation, can have no Cause at all, besides that which is the Cause of the
Habit, of the Act, or Quality whence it necessarily results. And in particular,
that conformity or similitude which the First man did bear to his Almighty
Creator, did necessarily result from his substance or manhood, as it was the
work of God, undefaced. Nor can we search after any other true Cause of the
First man's confirmity to God, or his integrity, besides him who was the Cause
of his manhood, or of his Existence with such qualifications as by his Creation
he was endowed with. In like manner whosoever was the cause whether of his
coveting or eating of the Tree in the middle of the Garden, was the true Cause
of that Obliquity or crooked deviation from Gods Law, or of that deformity or
dissimilitude unto God himself, which did necessarily result from the Forbidden
Act or desire. It was impossible there should be one Cause of the Act, and
another Cause of the Obliquity or deformity, whether unto Gods Laws or unto God
himself. For no Relation or Entity merely relative (such are obliquity and
deformity) can have any other Cause, beside That which is the Cause of the
(Fundamentum or) Foundation whence They immediately result. It remains then
that we acknowledge the old Serpent to have been the First Author; and Man (whom
God created male and female) to have been the true positive Cause of that
Obliquity or deformity which did result by inevitable Necessity from the
forbidden Act or desire, which could have no Necessary Cause at all. For the
Devil or old Serpent could lay no absolute necessity upon our First Parents
Will, which the Almighty Creator had left Free to eat or not to eat of the
Forbidden Fruit. That they did de Facto, eat of it, was not by any Necessity,
but merely Contingently, or by abuse of that Free Will which God had given
them. Briefly, to say or think that our First Parents were necessitated by the
Divine Decree to that Act or any part of that Act or desire, whence the First
sin did necessarily result; or to imagine that the Act or desire was necessary
in respect of Gods Decree, is to lay a deeper and fouler charge upon the
Almighty, That Holy One, then we can, without slander, charge the Devil withal.

5. Charity binds me to impute the harsh Expressions of some good Writers, and
wel-deserving of all reformed Churches; Yea, the Errors of the Dominicans or
other Schoolmen, (which were more faulty then Zwinglius or his followers in
this point) rather unto Incogitancy or want of Skill in good Arts, then unto
Malice or such malignancy as the Lutheran long ago had furiously charged upon
the Calvinist; as if they had chosen the Devil, not the Father of lights, Much
wrong done to worthy writers by unskilful Apologizers for their harsh expresons.
maker of heaven and earth, to be their God. And I could heartily wish that
Pareus had not entered into that Dispute with Becanus about this Controversy:
But seeing I cannot obtain my wish, I must be sorry that he came off no better
then he did, especially for Calvin's Credit, or for his own. I did not believe
the relation of the conference which I read long ago in Canisius, until I read
the like set forth by Tum D. Serarius: Scimus Vestros ita distinguere, quod non
improbamus. Calvinus vero in scriptis suis omnem Dei permissionem in peccatis
simpliciter rejicit: Et opera malorum, etiam quoad malitiam, efficaciae Dei
tribuit: atque sic Deum Authorem Peccari manifest facit. Ego vero: Utrum haec
sit Calvini sententia quam Vos Eitribuitis, postea videbimus. Jam accipio, quod
datis, Nostros, quos Calvinistas vocatis, ^o modo, quo dixi, distinguere;
Quodque distinctionem nostram non potestis improbare. Hinc vero evidenter
conficitur, Calvinistas, quos vocatis, Deum peccati Autorem nequaquam facere:
Ac proinde salsam esse D. Becani Minorem, quod Calvinistae faciant Deum
Authorem peccati: eoque and Conclusionem esse calumniosam, quod Calvinistarum
Deus sit Diabolus.
Pareus himself; wherein he professes, that he likes better of Cardinal
Bellarmines opinion then of Calvin's, Concerning the Controversies or Questions
about the First Cause of sinning. But were it any part of my present task, I
could easily make it appear, even by the Testimony and Authority, or which is
more, by the concludent Arguments of some learned Jesuits themselves; That
Cardinal Bellarmin, and many others of Aquinas his followers, do make God to be
the Author of sin, Ibi D. Serarius, pro ingenio suo intelligens nodum: Ergo,
inquit, deleatur illud -- starum: Erit tamen Diabolus Calvini, si non
Calvinistarum Deus. Quo dicto D. Becanus subrubescens, cum Socii ingenuitatem
improbare non auderet, subjecit and ipse: Been, deleatur -- starum; Manebit
tamen Deus Calvini Diabolus. Tum Ego, dextra eis praebita, pro tanta
liberalitate gratias agens, Satis mihi nunc est, inquam, quod fatemini, --
starum delendum esse, ut jam non Calvinistarum, sed Calvini Deus, secundum Vos,
sit Diabolus. Pareus Act. Swalbacen. Part 1. Coll. 2. De Autore Peccati.
by as clear infallible Consequence, as either Zwinglius or Piscator have done.
And he that would diligently peruse Aquinas his writings, and in particular his
resolution of that Question, [An detur Causa Praedestinationis,] may find him
as strait-lac'd as Calvin was; one and the same girdle would be an equal and
competent measure for both their Errors. The best Apology that can be made for
Either, must be taken from the Roman Satyrists charity, Opere in longo, fas
est obrepere somnum. Calvin and Aquinas were Homines (...), that is, somewhat
more then Authors of long works; Authors of many various works in respect of
the several subjects or arguments: which is the best apology that Jansenius
could make for St. Jeromes contradicting of himself in several works; as
Espenseus does the like for Saint Austin.

6. But of that Pardon which learned Men that wrote much and handled many much
different matters may justly challenge, such as stand to be their followers
(though afarr off,) are no way Capable. Men, I mean, who having other ordinary
works or vocations to follow, do busy their brains and abuse their Auditors
or Readers with idle and frivolous Apologies for those slips or errors of
worthy writers which stand more in need of ingenuous censure, of mild
interpretation or Correction, then a Justifiable Defense. More there have not
been (as I hope) nor more peccant in this kind in any of reformed Churches,
then In this Church of England, though not Of it. Some Treatises I have read
and heard for justifying the Escapes or ill expressions of Calvin and Beza, by
improving their words into a worse and more dangerous sense, then they
themselves meant them in, or their Followers in the Churches wherein they
lived, did interpret them. Had these Vnscholastick Apologizers been called to a
strict account or examination of their Doctrine by the Rules of Art, this happily
would have bred a new Question in our Schools; [Whether to attribute such Acts
or decrees unto God as they do, and yet withal to deny that they concludently
make him the Author of sin, does not argue as great a measure of Artificial
Foppery, or, (which is more to be feared in some,) of Supernatural
Infatuation, as it would do of impiety, toresolve dogmatically in Terminis
terminantibus, That God is the Author of Sin]

CHAP. VI.
The usual distinction between the Act and obliquitie of the Act, can have no
place in the first oblique Act of our first Parents.
1. The Illustration of the forementioned distinction retorted upon such as use
it.
THe former Question or Problem might justly be allowed in any Academicall Act
or Commencement, albeit the Answerer or Defendant were furnished with no other
grounds or occasions of his Theses, besides that usually avouched Distinction
between the Act and Obliquitie of the Act; specially if the Distinction were
applied unto the First Sin of our First Parents. In that sin whether we refer
it to our Father Adam, or to our Mother Eve, the Act and the Obliquitie are
altogether as unseparably annexed, as Rotunditie or roundnes is with a Sphere
or molded Bullet. And to imagine there should be one Cause of the Act, and
another of the Obliquitie or sinfulness of the Act, would be as gross a
Soloecisme, as to assign or seek after any other Cause of the Rotunditie or
roundnesse of a Sphere or Bullet, besides him that frames the one or moulds the
other: or as it would be to enquire any other Cause of the equality between two
bodies before unequal, besides him that makes the quantity to be of one and
the same-size or scantling; or of the similitude between the Fleece of a black
sheep, and of a white sheep perfectly dyed black, besides the Dyer. Now the
similitude betwixt that which is perfectly dyed black and that which is black
by nature, does inevitably result from the Dyer without the intervention of any
other Cause imaginable. Easy it were to produce a volume of like instances in
the works of nature, or of men's works and practices upon them; all of them
concludently enforcing the resolution of the former Problem to be allowable in
Schools, by most perfect and absolute Induction, if Arts or Sciences were once
so happy as to have none but true and accurate Artists to be their Judges. As
indeed they are the sole competent Judges in like Cases, and Judges they are
within these precincts as Competent, as the Reverend Judges of this or any
other Land are in Causes Civil, Municipal, or Criminal.

2. Admit then a man were found guilty of murder by a Jury of his honest
Neighbors upon the Authentic Testimonies of two or three witnesses which had
seen him run his Neighbor through the body in some vital part, or to cleave
his head in two, and a Philosopher or Physician should undertake to arrest the
Judgment or make Remonstrance to the Judge, that the Delinquent arraigned, and
convicted by the Jurie, was not the true or immediate Cause of the others
death, upon these or the like allegations out of his own faculty; That death
properly consists in the dissolution of natural heat and moisture, whereas
the party arraigned did never intend to make any such dissolution, or to
terminate his Action to the point of death, but only to thrust his sword
through him or to knock him in the head, which Actions can have no direct
Term, besides the Vbi or Term of local motion: Can we imagine that any Judge
could be so mild as not to censure such an Apologizer for a saucy Artificial
Fool or a Crack'd-brained Sophister? And yet this Apology is not, cannot be
in vulgar judgments so Censurable of Artificial folly, as the former Apology
for salving the Escapes, Errors, or ill Expressions of some Learned and Pious
Men, by nice distinctions betwixt the Act, and the Sinfulness of it, in our
First Parents Case, was. For there is not so immediate or so absolute or
necessary connection between death and the deadliest wound that can be given to
any man, as there is between Acts peremptorily forbidden by the Law of God, and
the Obliquitie or sinfulness of them. For there is not, neither is it possible
there should be, any minute of time, or, which is less then the least part of a
minute, any moment of time, betwixt such Acts, and the Obliquitie resulting
from them. Both of them come together, both in respect of order of time, and of
nature, by absolute indispensable Necessity: Whereas between death and wounds
given meritorious of Capital punishment, there usually is a distance of time,
and oftentimes no absolute or unpreventable necessity, that the one should
follow within a year and a day of the other.

3. But the best Method to convince such as Invented or used the former
Distinction, of gross error and somewhat more then so, will be to retort their
own Illustrations or justifications of it, upon themselves; as I have learned
by successful Experience upon some learned Ingenuous students which have
revoked their own opinions, and reclaimed others upon the reading of my
meditations upon this argument in another Dialect. In solenni Lectione
One of the most usual Illustrations or intended corroborations of the former
distinction is borrowed from a Man, that rides a Lame or halting horse. Such a
rider, say they, (especially if he ride with switch and spur,) is the Cause why
the horse goes or runs as fast as he can, but not the Cause of his lamenesse or
of his halting. Of his lamenesse, supposed he was lamed before, the Rider (I
confess) is no Cause: yet of his actual halting downright, or of the increase
of the lameness which will follow upon the unseasonable riding or over-riding,
he is the only Cause. For if the poor Beast might have rested his bones when he
was enforced to trot or gallop, he would not have halted at all at that time,
nor would he have been so grievously lame, as by such unseasonable usage he is.
But this instance or Illustration, suppose it were not much amiss in respect
of men now living, can no way suit or fit the Question concerning the sin of
our First Parents. For Adam at his creation was no way lame or defective either
in soul or body, before he tasted of the forbidden Fruit. Now if the Almighty
Creator had been the cause of this Act, he had been as true a Cause of the
First sin, or of Adams halting in his service; as he that bestrides a sound and
lusty horse, and runs him upon the spur in a rugged and stony ground, or in a
deep way, is of the lamenesse, of the death, or any disease which ensues such
desperate riding.

4. Many commit more gross Idolatry with their own fancies, then the Heathen
did with their Idols.
To imagine that God should deal so hardly with the First Adam, as to give him a
Law which he intended to make him break, and yet to punish him with death for
the breach of it; Or that the Second Adam, the wisdom of God should send wise
men and Prophets to Jerusalem, to the intent or End that She should stone or
put them to death; or for this purpose, that their blood should in later days
be required of Her, (as some in our times have publicly taught) is an
Imagination in it self much worse and more dangerous then the erection of
Images (though Roman-wise) in Reformed Churches; A greater Abomination then any
Idol of the Heathens. For Images or Idols are but the External Objects of, or
enticements unto gross Idolatry. Nor was it the Carpenter or Statuary that did
make the Heathen gods or Idols: Who then? Qui colit, ille facit; He or they
alone turn Images or Pictures into Idols or false Gods, Qui fingit sacros, auro
vel marmore, vultus,
which worship or adore them. Non facit ille Deos; qui colit, ille facit.
But the former Opinion or imagination, whether in respect of God, as he was
the First man's Creator, or of the wisdom of God, Martial.
as he is our Lord and Redeemer, is Intrinsecal and Formal Idolatry, or
Idolatry in the Abstract, without any external Object to dote upon, or to
entice men to bestow worship upon it. The Heathens committed Idolatry in their
Temples, or in their houses: but this Idolatry is committed within his Brain
that entertains it: The Essence of it formally consists in the Reflection of the
Imagination upon it self, or in the complacency which men take in such
Reflections; if any man happily (which I much doubt) can be delighted with such
imaginations. The very height of Heathenish Idolatry, as our Apostle instructs
us, Romans 1. 23, etc. did consist in changing the glory of the uncorruptible
God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed
beasts, and creeping things. Now if the wisdom of God had sent wisemen and
Prophets unto the Jews, unto the End that Jerusalem should be destroyed, and
righteous blood required of them, His weeping over Jerusalem had better
resembled or expressed the disposition of a Crocodile, then the Nature either
of God or any good Man. Nor was it greater Idolatry in the Heathen, to change
the glory of the uncorruptible God into the image or likeness of a Crocodile,
as the Egyptians did; then it is to ascribe the properties of this noisome
beast, or any such disposition, as the Historical Emblem of the Crocodile does
represent, unto the Son of God, who came into the world, not to destroy or
hurt, but to save sinners, and to be consecrated to be the Heb. 5. 9.
Author of Everlasting Salvation to all that Obey him. These Two Branches of
Idolatry; The One planted in the Egyptian, who worshipped the Crocodile for his
god; The other in such as worship or nourish such sinister imaginations (of the
Son of God) as have been specified; differ no more, then the way from Athens to
Thebes, does from the way from Thebes to Athens.

5. The original occasion of the former errors or ill expressions.
The main head or source original whence all or most of the harsh expressions
whether of Reformed writers, or of Roman Catholics; whence all the aspersions
which both or either of them indirectly, or by way of necessary consequence,
cast upon our Lord Creator and Redeemer, naturally issue, is that Common or
Fundamental Error, That all things, (the changes and chances of this inferior
World not excepted) are necessary in respect of God, or of his irresistible
Decree: That nothing, not humane Acts, can be Contingent, save only with
reference to Second Causes. Now if there be no Contingency in humanc Acts,
there neither is, nor ever was, nor ever can be, any Free Will in man. The
original of this common Error; [That all things are Necessary in respect of the
Divine Decree,] has been sufficiently discovered in the sixth book of these
Commentaries upon the Apostles Creed, Sect. 2. Chap. 12. Where the Reader may
find the Truth of this Proposition or Conclusion clearly demonstrated; [That to
Decree a Contingency in some works or Course of Nature, in Humane Acts
especially, was as possible to him unto whom nothing is impossible, as it was
to decree a Necessity in some others works or Courses of Nature.] As for
instance, To Decree or constitute that our Father Adam should have a Free power
or Faculty either to eat or not to eat of the Forbidden Fruit, does imply no
Contradiction; and therefore was absolutely possible to the Almighty Creator so
to ordain or Decree. But many things (as the observant Reader will except) are
possible which are not probable, or never are brought into Act. True; Yet that
the Almighty Creator, did de Facto, or actually decree, a Mutual Possibility of
Adams Falling and not Falling, or between his Fall and Perseverance, has been
in this present Treatise, and in some others demonstrated from the Article
Concerning The Goodness of God or his Gracious providence, by such
Demonstration, as the Case now in handling, is capable of: that is, by Evident
Deduction of the Contradictory Opinion, to this Impossibility, That God
otherwise was the only Cause of our First Parents sins, and of all other sins
which necessarily issue from their sins; unless it be granted and agreed upon,
that Adams Falling or not Falling should both be alike possible; that neither
should or could be necessary either to the First or Second Causes. To deny that
God did ordain or constitute a true and Facible Mean between the Necessity of
Adams Perseverance in the State wherein he was created, and the Necessity of
his Falling into sin, that is, a mutual Possibility of falling or not of
Falling into sin, would imply as Evident a Contradiction unto, or impeachment
of his Goodness, as it would do to his Omnipotency, if any man should
peremptorily deny that the Constitution or Tenor of such a Decree were
possible to his Almighty power. To say, God could not possibly make such a
disjunctive Decree, or such a Tenor of mutual possibility betwixt things
Decreed, as has been often mentioned, would be a gross Error, yet an error (I
take it) not so dangerous, as to deny that he did de Facto make such a Decree.
For our Gracious Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier is doubtless more jealous to
have his Goodness impeached or suspected, then to have his Almighty Power
questioned.

6. Thus much of the main general Query, Concerning the manner how sin (or that
evil which we call Malum culpae) did find First entrance into the works of God,
and in particular into the nature of Man: from the first moment of whose
creation, he and all the rest of Gods visible works, had this Elogium or
commendation, that they were Exceeding Good* No entrance of sin into the works
of God, into man especially, was possible, without the Incogitancy or
Inadvertency of a Free Cause or Agent. The true nature of the first sin and of
its haynousnesse did especially consist in this, that whereas our gracious
Creator had endowed our First Parents with a Power or faculty to Do well,
exceeding well; and given them good encouragement to persevere in so doing,
they should so incogitantly and quickly abuse this power, and the Divine
Concourse or assistance that did attend it, to do that which was evil; that
which the Lord their Creator had so peremptorily forbidden them to do, under
commination of a dreadful punishment to ensue upon the doing of it. The
difficulty or main Querie which remains (all that has been said being granted)
is principally this: [How this one sinful Act of our First Parents could
possibly produce an Habit of sin, or that which is more then a Habit, an
unmovable custom of sin, or an Hereditary disease of sinfulness throughout
all the successions of the sons of Adam, to the worlds end.] The second Querie,
(yet in the first place to be discussed) is this, [Wherein the nature of that
hereditary disease which we call Sin Original does properly consist.] The
third, [How this hereditary disease does bring all mankind into a true and
proper servitude to sin, and by sin, unto Satan etc.] In the discussion of this
and many other difficulties depending upon it, I shall endeavor to observe
that Rule which Chemnitius in many of his works has commended to the
observation of every Student in Divinity; and his Rule is this: To state all
Questions upon those places of Scripture out of which they are naturally
emergent, or out of those passages, upon whose mistakings or non-observance of
them, many Theological controversies were first occasioned, and are to this day
abetted or maintained with eagerness of dissension. To begin first with that
most heavenly discourse of our Savior, John 8. 30, etc.

Containing the State of the Controversy, or Debate betwixt our Savior and

1. A Paraphrase on John 8. verse. 34, etc.
WHether that Reply or saucy interruption, verse. 33. [We be Abraham's seed, and
were never in bondage to any man: How say thou, ye shall be made Free:] was
made by those Jews, whom our Evangelist avouches did believe on him, verse. 30.
or by some other Bystanders, has been discussed in a Sermon lately delivered,
which by Gods assistance shall be annexed to the Discussions following, which
better befit the Press or the Schools, then the Pulpit. So that I must take my
Rise from our Saviors Rejoinder to that former saucy reply, verse. 34. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Whosoever commits sin, etc. The forecited sentence
of Cyprian, does here again opportunely interpose it self; Vt Deum cognoscas,
teipsum prius cognosce: That thou may know God aright, first learn to know
thy self. The advice is as true and fitting to our present purpose, Vt Christum
cognoscas, teipsum prius cognosce: There is no better way or Method to know
Christ as He is in special our Lord God and Redeemer, then by knowing or
understanding our selves to be servants, and wherein that servitude consists,
from which we are redeemed. That we are by nature servants unto sin, you will
require no further proof, nor can there any other be found better, then our
Saviors own Authority: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever commits
sin is the servant of sin. The Assertion is Emphatical, and as peremptory as
plain. But concerning the Extent or Limitation of it, there may be some
Question made, or Scruple cast in by the ordinary Hearer or Reader. For seeing
as Solomon long ago has taught us Ex cathedra, There is no man that sins
not: and our Apostle to like purpose: If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
our selves, and there is no truth in us: Then if it be universally true which
our Savior here says [whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin:] the
very Redeemed of the Lord, the best of his Saints here on earth may seem
concluded to be servants to sin; seeing he that sins, does commit sin. The
Argument is somewhat captious and would be stronger, if To commit sin were a
verb of the present Tense, and were to be no further extended. But the word in
the Original, is not a verb, but a participle of the present Tense (...), not,
(...). And participles of that Form (as every young Student in the Greek
tongue, Ecclesiastic especially, well knows) are according to Hebraisms most
frequent in the Greek Testament, fully Equivalent to Latin Verbals. Vinum
appetere, that is, to call for a cup of wine, any ordinary man may without
impeachment to his sobriety, or censure of temulency: But to be Homo appetens
vini, is in the Latin Tongue, a full Character or expression of a Wine-bibber
or a Drunkard. So that (...) is as much, as if he had said in Latin, Operarius
iniquitatis* which is the best expression of the Hebrew: (...) Not every one
that commits a sin, or more sins then one; but every one that is a Committer
of sin, or a Worker of Iniquity is the Servant of sin. And such all of us are
by Nature, and so continue until we be redeemed by the Free Grace of Christ,
from the Dominion of sin and Tyranny of Satan. But before we can come to know
the manner how we are made Free by the Son of God: we must (as has been
intimated before) first know, wherein our servitude to sin does consist. And
this we cannot well know without some prenotion, or description at least, of
the properties or conditions of sin especially original. To omit the
distinction of sins of Omission and Commission, there be of sin generally or
indefinitely taken (I dare not say diverse kinds, but) diverse stems, roots, or
branches. The First root of sin, was the sin of the First man, which was both
an Actual and Habitual sin in him: The second is, Sin Original, which is more
then an Habit; an hereditary disease of our Nature, altogether incurable, save
only by the Free Grace of the Son of God. Over and above both these roots or
stems, there be other branches, as some Sins Habitual, which are acquired or
produced by such precedent Actual sins as we freely and frequently commit,
without any necessity imposed upon us, by the inhabitation of Sin Original in
our Nature.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Sin of the First man, And of Sin Original which was derived from him:
Of Sins Actual, and the difference betwixt them. That of Sin Original the
Heathens had a natural notion.
1. COncerning the Actual Sin of the First man and the Habit which it produced
in himself, I have not much more to say then has been said before; to wit,
that neither could have any necessary Cause, but a Cause contingent only, or a
free Agent. Nor is there (I take it) indeed any other Cause of Actual or
Habitual sins, Praeter Diabolum seducentem, and Hominent libere consentientem,
that is, besides the Devil who still labors to seduce or tempt us, and man's
Free consent or voluntary yielding to his temptations.

2. Adam First Sin did pollute our Nature: Our Actual Sins pollute our Persons.
Between Sin Original which is the Effect, and the sin of the First man which
was the Cause of it, Vid. Locorum Theologicorum Compendium, Pro Scholis
Wra^islaviensibus concinnatum.
some have acutely observed This Distinction: That the Person of the First man
by his sin corrupted our Nature; and our Nature being corrupted by him,
corrupts all our Persons that come by Natural Descent from him. Unto which they
add; that Every one of us by committing Actual sin, does corrupt or pollute
his Person. But whether any Person besides our Father Adam, do or may by
frequent Commission of Actual sins, without any Necessity derivable either from
our First Parents sin, or from the Effect of it, which is Sin Original, corrupt
or pollute the Nature of such Persons as lineally descend from him, is a point
capable of Question, and worthy of more accurate discussion, then my Abilities
afford, or my years will permit me to bestow any long or serious studies in.
Such as are or shall be disposed to handle this or any of the former Questions
proposed, more exquisitely, must make their entrance into this Search by the
same plain way which I intend to follow: that is, to guess at the Cause by the
Effect; or at the Nature or Essence of Sin Original, by the known Properties or
Symptoms of it. And in this plain Search an Observant Student shall hardly
find such fair hints, or good helps from the Schoolmen, The pregnant
testimonies of Heathens, Poets, Naturalists, etc. concerning sin Original.
Ancient or Modern, as he may from some School-Boyes, or at least from some
Good Books which they usually read, and better remember then the Schoolmen do.

3. As for the Substance or Realty of that which we call Original Sin, though
unknown to them by that name, and of our Natural Servitude to sin, a serious
Divine may find more solid and lively Terence. Andr. Act. 1. Sc. 1. Ingenium est
Omnium Hominu^ a labor proclive ad libidinem.
Hor. Sermon. l. 1. Sat. 3.
Nec natura potest justo secernere iniquum
Dividat ut bona diversis, fugienda petendis.
Ovid. Metam. l. 7.
Me trahit invitam nova vis; aliudque Cupido,
Men's aliud suadet. Video meliora proboque
Deteriora Sequor.
Hor. Epist. 8. lib. 1.
Quae nocuere sequar; fugia^ quae profore creda^,
Parallel to that of S. Paul, Romans 7. 21, 22, 23.
Ovid. Alibi.
Nitimur in vetitu^ semper cupimusque negata:
Sic interdictis imminet Aeger aquis, etc.
Parallel to Romans 7. 8, 9. Man's servitude to sin is well set down, by Horace,
Sermon. Lib. 2. Sat. 7. and in Persius. Sat. 5. v. 75, etc. consonant to John 8.
34. And that in Pers. 2. Sat. v. 60.

O curvae in terris animae, and caelestium inanes!
Quid juvat hoc, Te^plis nostros immittere mores,
Et bona Diis ex hac scelerata ducere pulpa?
Is parallel to Psalm. 50. 21. Thou Thoughiest wickedly that I was such an One
as thy self.


Expressions in some Heathenish Naturalists, or in the Roman Orator, or
Ancient Latin Poets, then he can do in the great Master of the Sentences; in
Aquinas, (though Sainted as much for Learning as for sanctity, by the Romish
Church;) or in their Followers, or such as Comment upon their Writings. And no
marvel, if so it be, seeing the Naturalist (as his profession leads him) hunts
after the Truth upon a Fresh-unfoyled Sent, always insisting upon those which
we call the First Notions: whereas the Schoolmen, the Later especially, have
been delighted to draw all Doubts or Quaeries about the most solid Points in
Divinity, or matters most capable of Philosophical Expressions, into second
Notions or Terms of Art, or Artificial Fabrics of words: as if they meant to
rend or resolve strong and well woven Stuff into small and raveled threads; to
entangle themselves and their Readers in perpetual Fallacies, A rebus ad
voces. Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata, was a Good Lesson which
the Facilo Roman Poet had not learned by Hearsay or got by Rote; but had got
it by Heart from a good instructor, as willing and ready to teach us as him;
that is from undoubted Experience of his own or other men's dispositions or
affections. This good Poet with some other of his profession, Isaiah. 1. 3.
and other Heathen Orators or Philosophers, have excellently observed, that The
nature of man was farther out of Tune or Frame; Jer: 8. 7,
had greater discord or Contrariety of inclinations within it self, then the
Nature of any other living thing besides. But unto the Nature or Reality of
that which Divines call Original sin, the Roman Naturalist (Pliny I mean) in
his Proaeme to the seventh book of his Natural History, speaks most fully and
most appositely. The passage is (for ought I know) well translated into our
English. Or if ought be amiss, the Latin Reader may correct or amend it by
the Latin Copy hereto annexed.

we have in the former Books sufficiently treated of the universal World, of
the Lands, Regions, Nations, Seas, Islands, and Renowned Cities therein
contained. It remains now to discourse of the Living Creatures comprised
within the same, and their natures: a point doubtless that would require as
deep a speculation, as any part else thereof whatsoever, if so be the spirit
and mind of man were able to comprehend and compass all things in the world.
And to make a good entrance into ^his treatise and History, me th^^^ of right
we ought to begin at (...), for whose sake it should seem that Nature produced
all other creatures besides: Though this great favor of hers, so bountiful
and beneficial in that respect, has cost full dear. In so much, as it is
hard to Judge, whether in so doing she has done the part of a kind Mother, or
a hard and cruel Step-dame. For first and foremost, of all other living
Creatures, man she has brought forth all naked, and clothed him with the good
and riches of others. To all the rest given she has sufficient to clad them
every one according to their kind: as namely, shells, cods, hard hides, pricks,
shagge, bristles, hair, down, feathers, quils, scales, and fleeces of wool.
The very trunks and stems of trees and plants, she has defended with bark and
rind, Quando firmum cibis os? Quandi^ palpitans vertex, summae inter cuncta
animalia imbecillitatis indicium? Jam morbi, totque medicinae contra mala
excogitatae, and hae quoque subinde novitatibus victae. Caetera sentire naturam

stitio, uni sepulturae cura, atque etia^ postse de futuro. Nulli vita
fragilior, nulli rerum omnium libido major, nulli pavor confusior, nulli rabies
acrior. Denique caeter a animantia in suo genere probe degunt: Congregari

serpentum morsus non petit serpents: ne maris quidem belluae ac pisces, nisi
in diversa genera, saeviunt. At Hercule Homini plurima ex homine sunt mals.
yea and the same sometimes double, against the injuries both of heat and
cold: Man alone, poor wretch, she has laid all naked upon the bare Earth,
even on his birthday, to cry and wraule presently from the very first hour
that he is borne into this world: in such sort, as among so many Living
Creatures, there is none subject to shed tears and weep like him. And verily
to no babe or Infant is it given once to Laugh before he be forty days old,
and that is counted very early and with the soonest. Moreover, so soon as he is
entered in this manner to enjoy the Light of the sun, see how he is immediately
tied and bound fast, and has no member at liberty; a thing that is not
practiced upon the young whelps of any beast among us, be he never so wild. The
Child of man thus untowardly borne, and who another day is to rule and command
all other* lo how he Lies bound hand and foot, weeping and crying, and
beginning his Life with misery, as if he were to make amends and satisfaction
by his punishment, unto Nature, for this only Fault and Trespass, that he is
borne and brought into the world. O folly of all follies, ever to think
(considering this simple beginning of ours) that we were sent into this world
to live in Pride and carry our head aloft! The first hope that we conceive of
our strength, the first gift that time affords us, makes us no better yet
then foure-footed beasts; how long is it ere we can go alone? How long before
we can prattle and speak, feed our selves, and chewe our meat strongly? What a
while continues the mould and crown of our heads to beat and pant, before our
brain is well settled; the undoubted mark and token that bewrays our
exceeding great weakness above all other creatures: What should I say of the
infirmities and sickness that soon seize upon our feeble bodies: What need I
speak of so many medicines and remedies devised against these Maladies: besides
the new diseases that come every day, able to check and frustrate all our
provision of Physic whatsoever? As for all other Living Creatures, there is
not one, but by a secret instinct of nature knows its own good, and whereto
he is made able: Some make use of their swift feet, Others of their flight
wings: some are strong of limbs, Others are apt to swim, and practice the
same: Man only knows nothing unless he be taught; He can neither speak, nor
go, nor eat otherwise then he is trained to it: And to be short, apt and good
at nothing he is naturally, but to pule and cry. And hereupon it is, that some
have been of this opinion, That better it had been, and simply best for a man,
never to have been born, or else speedily to dye. None but we do sorrow and
wail, none but we are given to excess and superfluity infinitely in every
thing, and show the same in every member that we have. Who but we again are
ambitious and vainglorious? Who but we are covetous and greedy of gathering
good? We and none but we desire to Live long and never to die, are
superstitious, careful of our sepulture and burial, yea, and what shall betide
us when we are gone? Man's life is most frail of all others, and in least
security he Lives: No Creature Lusts more after every thing then he: None
fears Like unto him, and is more troubled and amazed in his fright: and if he
be set once upon anger, none more raging and wood then he. To conclude, all
other Living Creatures Live orderly and well, after their own kind: We see them
flock and gather together; and ready to make head and stand against all others
of a contrary kind: the Lions, as fell and savage as they be, fight not one
with another: Juvenal. Sat. 15. v. 145.

Nay the very Monsters and huge fishes of the Sea, war not amongst themselves in
their own kind: But, believe me, Man at man's hand, receives most harm and
mischief. Thus far Pliny.

4. Heathen Naturalists hold better Consort with the Primitive church
concerning the nature of Sin Original, then the Socinians do.
We have no reason sufficient to persuade us to believe or to suspect, that
this great Naturalist did ever peruse any part of the Book of Grace, not so
much of it as is contained in the History of Moses, much less such passages in
it as concern this Point, as are comprehended in the Prophets, in the
Evangelists, or in S. Paul's Epistles. Or if any man have better reasons then I
have to believe or suspect that he might have read them all, or the most part
of them. It would notwithstanding be a groundless surmise to imagine, that he
had been Catechized by Christ's Apostles or their Deputies; or that he had
received any spiritual Grace, either by Baptism or Imposition of Their hands.
Now albeit we suppose or grant, that he had read the Books of Moses or some
passages in the Prophets, but deny (what I think no man will affirm) that he
was Baptized or made partaker of Grace by Christ: the Cause is clear that he
could have no better guide for searching after, or finding out those Orthodoxal
Truths or Notions which he has most Elegantly expressed, then Recta Ratio,; that
is, the right use of Reason, which Nature, though corrupted in him, had not
utterly extinguished but much weakened. And here I can rather wish, then pray,
that this man had lived in this Age, or might be restored to Life again, to
encounter those Semi-Christians which contend for the Sovereignty of Recta
Ratio, as if It were the only Guide or Rule of Christian Faith. But albeit I
dare not pray, nor can I hope to hear Pliny speak to this or any other good
purpose in this Life: Yet I verily believe, that the writings which this
Vncatechized Heathen has left, and he himself shall rise up in Judgment
against those proud Fantastic spirits, which having been Baptized in the name
of Christ, and Catechized in the fundamental points of Christian Faith, do
either flatly deny or captiously question, Whether our Nature were so deeply
tainted with that Sin which we call Original, or so far deprived of Freedom or
power to restore our selves to our primaeval state of Nature; as that the Death
and Resurrection of a Redeemer more then mere man, and his Everlasting
Priesthood, were necessarily required for freeing us from the bondage of Satan.

5. Seeing this Modern Sect of men, as Pelagius their Father (whose errors
concerning the state of the First man and of Sin Original, have been mightily
improved by them) have been, S. Austin not the First that did maintain Original
sin.
and are such notorious Trewants in the Book of Nature, and such Schediastick
Surveyors of the Book of Grace, as none have been or can be beside; and such as
in their skeptical contrivances hold it a part of Policy or state, to draw all
or most such forces of Reason as Nature or Grace had implanted in their
breasts, to guard their Brains, or fortify the inventions of their Fancies: It
is not to be expected that they should much regard the Unanimous consent of the
Orthodoxal and Primaeval Church. Some of this Sect are well contented to oppose
the consent of such Antiquity (as in other points they slight) against those
who reverence the memory of the Ancient Martyrs or Fathers, especially before
S. Austins time. Others of them are not ashamed to accuse this great and
Learned Father for being the First Author of that Doctrine which we maintain
Concerning the Nature of Sin Original. Now to press them with his Authority,
whom they accuse as an Author of Error, would be bootlesse. Wherefore waving
his Authority for the present for being any competent Judge or Advocate in this
Controversy, No ingenuous or sober man can except against him, as an unfit
Witness in this Cause, concerning the Tenants of the Ancient Church; or against
others whom he produces as witnesses beyond all Exception, which either
Pelagius himself, his Followers, or the Manichees could have taken against them
in his time.

Neque enim ex quo esse coepit Manichaei pestilentiosa doctrina, ex illo
coeperunt in Ecclesta Dei parvuli baptizandi, Exorcizari and exufflari, Vt
ipsis mysteriis oftenderetur non eos in regnum Christi nisi erutos a tenebrarum
potestate transferri. -- Quid autem dicam de ipsis divinarum scripturarum tract
atoribus, qui in Catholica Ecclesia floruerunt? Quomodo haec non in alios
sensus c^nati sunt vertere, quoniam stabiles erant in antiquissima and
robustissima fide, non autem novitio movebantur errore. Quos si Colligere and
eorum testimoniis uti velim, and nimis longum erit, and de Canonicis
autoritatibus, a quibus non debemus averti, minus fortasse videbor
praesumpsisse quam debui. Veruntamen ut omittam beatissimum Ambrosium, cui
Pelagius, sicut jam commemoravi, tam magnum integritatis in fide perhibuit
testimonium, qui tamen Ambrosius nihil aliud defendit in parvulis ut haberent
necessarium Medicum Christum, nisi Originale Peccatum. Nunquid and
gloriosissimae coronae Cyprianus dicetur ab aliquo, non solum fuisse, sed vel
esse potuisse Manichaeus, cum prius iste sit passus, quam illa in orb Romano
pestis apparuit, and tamen in libro de Baptismate parvulorum ita defendit
Originale peccatum, ut propterea dicat, and ante oct avum diem, si necesse sit,
Parvulum batizari oportere, ne pereat. Quem tanto vult intelligi ad
indulgentiam Baptismi facilius pervenire, quanto magis ei dimittuntur non
propria, sed aliena peccata. Hos iste audeat dicere Manichaeos, and
antiquissimam Ecclesiae Traditionem isto nefario crimine aspergat, qua
Exorcizantur, and ut dixi, Exufflantur parvuli, ut in regnum Christi a
potestate tenebrarum, hoc est Diaboli and Angelorum ejus eruti transferantur:

CHAP. IX.
Of the properties or effects of Sin Original, known by the light of Nature,
and by Scripture.
1. The Property of Original Sin is to Lust after things forbidden by the Law
of God and of Nature.
ENough it is to persuade any reasonable man, That Original Sin is not A mere
privation, or a proportioned shadow of Being, without a Reality answering to
it; seeing that in man (the Note or Character of whose distinction from, or
excellency above all other visible Creatures, is the use of Reason) there
usually is such a Lethargy, or sloathful deadness to do that which the very
Law of Nature or Reason does dictate unto him or command him to do; and such an
eager pronenesse or appetite to do those things which the Law of Reason or of
Nature forbids him to do; and those things with greatest Eagerness, which the
same Law of Reason or other positive Laws derived from it, most peremptorily
and upon severest penalties forbid him to do. It has been observed by many
Authors, that the Unnatural sin of Parricide, (wilful Murder of Father or
Mother, or of Superior Kindred) did not become rife or frequent amongst the
Romans, until they had upon particular sad accidents enacted a public Law, and
ordained a special kind of torment for transgressors in this kind. Lucius
Ostius was the first amongst the Romans that did commit this Unnatural sin: And
He lived almost six hundred years after the City was founded; a little after
the second Punick War. Some good See Plutarch in the Life of Romulus; Laertius
in the Life of Solon; and Tully in His second Oration, Pro Roscio Amerino: who
gives the true Character or Expression of that speech of Laertius. (...),
untowardly rendered by the Latin Interpreter --.(...), Plut. in Romans page 32.
(...) (Solon) (...). Diog. Lacrt. l. 1. in Solone. Is (Solon) cum
interrogaretur, Cur Nullum supplicium constituisset in Eum, qui Parentem
necasset, respondit, se id neminem facturum putasse. Sapienter fecisse dicitur,
cum de eo nihil sanxerit, quod antea commissum non erat, ne non tam Prohibere,
quam admonere videretur. Tull. Orat. 2. Pro Sext. Roscio Amerino.
Writers ascribe the long abstinence from this unnatural sin, unto the wisdom
of Romulus their Founder who enacted no Law against, much less appointed any
peculiar kind of death unto this Crime, which He expected should never be
committed by His Posterity. Certain it is, that Solon, for the like reason, did
not so much as mention this Crime in His (otherwise) most severe Laws. But this
observation was taken from the Heathen Romans in times ancient and far more
remote, and does not (as happily will be objected) hold in these times or
places wherein we live. Yet the Ingenuous and Learned French Thuanus.
Historian, (who meddles with the History of his own times only) tells us, that
the like unnatural sin toward Children or Infants did never come to so high
and far-spreading a Flow in the great City of that Kingdom, until the State or
Parliament had erected a peculiar Court to be held, for examination or trial of
such Cruel Mothers as sought to salve the breach of one Commandment by the
violation of another; to cover the shame of their own wantonness, by
murdering the tender fruits of their folly: as if the Damme which the Law had
set for repressing or stopping the Course of this bloody sin, had but provoked
the stream or Current, to swell higher and greater; to overburst all obstacles
or inhibitions which the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and of the Kingdom,
had set against it.

2. Again, why Pulpit-pride; why Clergie-cunning, insolency, or malice should
grow into a Proverb throughout most Christian Kingdoms or Provinces, as if
these or like transgressions in our profession, were of such a scantling as
could hardly be matched by the Laity; I cannot give a more probable reason (if
the imputation be true, or the occasion of the Proverb just) then this; That
Men of our profession, who are Gods peculiar Inheritance, are bound by the
Laws of God to more strict observance of our Saviors praecepts concerning
Humility, Meekness, Brotherly-love, and Charity, or peaceable disposicion
toward all; then ordinary Men, or men of other Callings or professions are.
And we know whose saying it is, That if we do not continue as we are by the
place wherein he has set us, (the Salt of the Earth, and Light of the World;)
We shall become the most degenerate, unprofitable members of the Land and
Church wherein we Live. And if the whole Tribe were to bear peculiar Arms,
(as some other ingenuous Professions do;) No Device could so well befit us as
Jeremiah's two Baskets of Figs. Then saia the Lord unto me. What see thou
Jeremiah? and I said, Figgs; the good Figgs very good; and the evil very
evil, that cannot be eaten they are so evil. Jer. 24. 3. The bad Figs were
the Emblem of the disobedient refractory, as the good Figs were of the obedient
and believing Jews in the Prophets time: Both parts of the Emblem are as
applyable to the Sons of Levi in our days. Such of this Tribe as suffer sin to
reign in their Mortal bodies, are generally the worst of sinners: Such as
mortify the works of the flesh by the spirit, by prayer, and other good
services of God, and seek their Freedom or manumission by the Son of God,
Working out their Salvation with fear and trembling, are the Best of all Gods
Saints on Earth.

3. The proper effects or Symptoms of Sin^ Original, described by S. Paul,
But the greatest part of the Induction hitherto made for finding out the
properties or Symptoms of Sin original, will be excepted against, especially
by such as are mere strangers to their own Breasts, or dispositions of their
hearts; because the particular observations or Experiments whereof the
Induction consists, have been made by the Heathen, or related by Authors not
Canonical. But the Exception will void it self, if we shall make it clear to
men altogether unexperienced of themselves; that the like Experiments or
observations have been made and more fully expressed by one whose Authority is
Canonical; whose Testimony of Experiments made in himself and taken by himself,
is most Authentic: it is St. Paul. That sin Original was in the world before
the Law was given, is clear from this Apostle Romans 5. 13. For until the Law,
sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no Law. So our
English, and most other Modern translations, render the Greek (...); None of
them altogether so well as it might be rendered: Better thus; [There is not,
there cannot be any true estimate or full reckoning made of sin, where there is
no Law to give the The Syriack reads it Usque enim ad Legem, peccatii, quum
esset in mundo, non reputabatur peccatum, propterea quod n^n erat Lex. That is,
Sin, though it were in the world until the Law, yet was it not reputed or
reckoned for sin until the law was given. But if it be true which the Appostle
Says; that sin reigned unto death until the Law: I hope it was imputed with a
Witness.
Charge. And again Ver. 20. Moreover, the Law entered that the offense might
abound. This abounding of the offense whereof he speaks, was the issue or
effect, (...): not (...), the End or Final Cause why the Law was given: For so
the Lawgiver might be suspected to have been the Author of sin, or at least of
the increase or abundance of it in the world. The Apostles meaning is, that the
Law was given as a praeparative Physic or medicine, to let such as were sick
of sin (as all were before the Law was given) understand, in what danger they
were; or, to give them notice of the abundance of corruption which was so
deeply seated in their Nature, that it could not be thoroughly purged by the
Law, which only set sin a working, that men might seek more eagerly after a
Better medicine, to wit, Faith in Christ. That this was our Apostles true
meaning in this place is apparent from the Parallel-passages to these: Romans,
Chap. 7. 7. what shall we say then? is the Law sin? God forbid: Nay I had not
known sin (that is, I had not taken true notice of the measure or danger of it)
but by the Law: for I had not known Lust, except the Law had said, Thou shall
not Covet. The Law to which these words referr, is the tenth Commandment:
wherein the Coveting of some few particulars, as of our Neighbors Wife, or of
his goods, is only expressly forbidden: But sin taking occasion by this Negative
Commandment, wrought in our Apostle (as he himself testifies) all manner of
Concupiscence; for without the Law sin was dead: that is, He did not feel the
Motions or Paroxysmes of sin, until the Law was laid unto him, as a
Preparative Medicine unto better Physic. And again ver. ninth. I was alive
without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, S^n revived, and I died.
And again, ver. 11. 12. 13. Sin taking occasion by the Commandment, deceived
me, and by it slew me. Wherefore, the Law is Holy, and the Commandment Holy,
and just and good. Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid:
But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good;
that sin by the commandment might become exceeding Sinful.

It is a Point observable and fully parallel to our Apostles doctrine; That the
Eastern part of the world did rather loath then long after Circumcision,
Until our Saviors Resurrection and the Apostles peremptory forbidding the
practice of it. From the former doctrine of our Apostle I have learned
satisfaction to a Problem which had often and long Perplexed my thoughts. The
Problem was this: Why Men, Unto whose care and fidelity a man might safely
commit his Fortunes or his life upon their honest word, became most careless
and unfaithful in matters whereto they are punctually tied by oath? The reason
is, Because the interposition or obligation by oath, is as the coming of a Law
which provokes the Corruption of Nature, whose longing or lust after things
forbidden rather then it should be unsatisfied, draws men otherwise morally
honest, to become like wayward intemperat Patients, which rather chose to
nourish the longing humors of the disease or infirmity, then to observe the
prescription of the Surgeon; ready to pull off the plaster though with the
live-skin or flesh, rather then to endure the working of it for a moment.

4. But here some have Questioned, Whether this Chapter be meant of the
Regenerate or Unregenerate Man? A Captious Interrogatorie; if Regeneration were
but one Act, or a resultance of some Few Acts or Conflicts between the Flesh
and the Spirit. But seeing Regeneration, in true Theology, includes Acts
almost numberless, or a Combat somewhat longer, then Mortification does: This
Chapter, if we speak of Christians, must be Meant, not of the Man truly
Regenerated or perfectly Mortified, but of a Man, Inter Regenerandum, during
the intermediate Acts or conflicts betwixt the beginning and the Consummation
of his See the 9 Article of the Church of England.
Regeneration. Or if we speak of One that believes the Old Testament better
then the New, as of a Jew or Mahumetane: it cannot be meant of a Lawless Man,
but of a man under the hammer of Gods Law given by Moses. For there must be a
Laying of some Law or Other, to the heart, before the Conflict here Mentioned
can begin; or Sin inherent, be so Provoked, as our Apostle tells us, it is.

5. Why Sin Original is more provoked by the Negative, then by the Affirmative
Precepts.
He that will diligently peruse our Apostles forementioned Passages Romans 7.
in the Language wherein he wrote, will easily observe with me, That the
occasion which Sin took By the Law to deceive him, (as it does yet to deceive
us;) was from the Negative Precepts or Commandments of the Law; not from the
Positive or Affirmative. Now why the Negative Precepts; that one especially,
[Thou shall not Lust; Thou shall not Covet;] should a great deal more provoke
or more forcibly revive the seeds of Original Sin inherent in us, then the
Affirmative Precepts usually do; the Reason is Evident; because, nothing is
nominated or proposed unto us in the Affirmative Precepts, but that which in
its nature is truly and sincerely Good, without the mixture of Evil: And
being such, is more apt to revive or quicken the Notions of the Law of Nature,
or Reason, or those Relics of Gods Image which remain in our Nature since
our first Parents fall; then to Enlive the seeds of sin, or to provoke our
inclinations unto Evil. On the contrary; In every Negative Precept there is a
Proposal or representation of those things, which be in their Nature truly
Evil; and therefore most apt to incite or provoke our natural Inclinations
unto the evil forbidden, or to enrage the Relics of our first Parents sin
inherent in Us; after the same manner and for the same reason, that the
representation of red Colors (without any other Provocation given) is, to
provoke or stir the blood of beasts or Cattle, which are of a more pure or
sanguine Constitution. Thus some tame Beasts (as Bulls or Kine) are aptest to
turn man-keen upon such as are clothed in bright red, or Scarlet. And a grave
Learned Scortum Hispani generis lepidum, ut serebatur, and formosum, mula, ut
Romae meretrices cum Amatoribus solent, animi gratia gestabatur. Haec cum
venisset ad Thermas Diocletianas, Vivarium ferarum ingressa, nec contenta
cicures vagantes Spectasse, precibus contendit and aeg^e impetrat a beluarum
Magistro, ut ingenti urso cavea separatim incluso, sed quem constabat in
Neminem antea desaevjisse, exitum aperiret. Facta potestate ursus erumpit,
mulam terresacit, excussam mulierculam, Caeteris, qui aderant, diffugentibus,
invadit, dictoque citius strangulat, and contrito capite primum avulsa ubera,
deinde natem alteram devorat, unguibus and dentibus laceratam. Esseratam
bestiam existimo, color coccineae vestis, quam induerat misella, speciem
sanguinis Praeferentem. Sepulveda Epist. lib. 2. ep. 15.
Historian sometimes Chronicler to Charles the Fifth, in an Epistle of his to his
friend, relates a sad accident of a Bear, which had never been observed to
have raged upon Any: yet being let loose from her Cage, and having opportunity,
to have exercised her rage upon Others, did single out a Courtisane of Spanish
progeny, whom she did as cruelly tear in pieces as if she had been Robbed by
her of her whelps, wearing upon that day a garment of somewhat a darker color
then the Scarlet or bright red; and so much the more apt (as See Scarmilion De
coloribus.
Philosophers teach us) to provoke or enrage this or other Ravenous Creatures,
which be of more duskie and melancholy blood. And the (...)
Author of the first Book of Macehab. Chap. 6. ver. 34. relates a warlike
Practice for encouraging the Elephants to fight more fiercely against their
Enemies, by representing, or (as it seems) Squeazing the Blood of Grapes and
mulberies in their sight or view.

6. Now the sight of semblable Colors can have no greater force or efficacy
to stir up the blood of Creatures like unto them, then the solemn proposal or
representation of sins prohibited has to provoke or enrage the Relics of Sin
original, or to procure the Fits or Motions of it, without the assistance of
Grace by Christ to restrain them. And I cannot persuade my self, that some
sins (not to be named) could ever have been, or yet could be so frequently
practiced in diverse Regions which have submitted themselves unto the
discipline of the Romish Church; to all her Canons and constitutions; save only
from the representation or expression of the nature of such sins in those
loathsome and abominable Interrogatories, which Romish Priests use in taking
Auricular Confession.

CHAP. X.
Containing such Description or Definition of Original Sin as can be gathered
from the Effects or Properties of it before mentioned.
1. Sin original, such a disease of the Soul as the Dropsy or other like
diseases are of the body.
FRom these Discussions of the Properties or Symptoms, we may frame this or
the like Description of Original Sin it self; That it is such a Disease of the
Soul, or such a corruption of the Humane nature, as the Dropsy or other like
corrupt Humors are of the Body: The one sort includes a thirst or longing
after such things as are forbidden them by the Physician of their Bodies; The
other an appetite or hunger after such diet as is in special prohibited by the
Physician of their souls. And all diseases (we know) are dangerous wherein the
Longing of the corrupt humor or matter which breeds them, is much greater then
the Longing or appetite of Nature; especially if we give satisfaction to such
intemperate desires or appetites.

2. Or if the Reader desire more then a Description, (that is) some competent
Definition of Sin Original: the best which for the present I can exhibit, is
this; [That it is a positive Renitencie of the Flesh or corrupt Nature of man
against the Spiritual Law of God, especially against the Negative praecepts;
being first occasioned or rather caused by the transgression of our First
Parents, especially from the intemperate Longing of our Mother Evah after the
forbidden Fruit. For as our Apostle instructs us, 1. Tim. 2. 14. Adam was not
deceived, but the Woman Being deceived Was in the transgression; that is, more
deeply in the transgression then the Man: because she seduced him to eat the
forbidden fruit, as the Serpent had done her; Or as the flesh or sensitive part
of our Nature does yet often seduce the Reasonable Will to yield her tacit or
implicit consent unto such Actions as they have expressly resolved upon or
undertaken, without consulting Reason or the masculine part of our Nature.

3. From this First Transgression of our First Parents; from the birth of Cain
unto this present day or hour, the forementioned Observation of the Roman Poet
[Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata;] was never out of Date, but
continued still in full force and strength amongst all the Sons of Adam
throughout their several generations; unless perhaps in some few, who by
special privilege or peculiar Grace, have been redeemed from the reign or
dominion of Sin from the womb or from the time wherein they begun to know the
difference between good and evil. Our blessed Savior (who was no mere Son of
Adam, but the true and only Son of God) was absolutely Free from the womb,
from his Conception as man, from all Tincture of Sin Original, from all
inclinations to attempt or desire any thing that was evil or forbidden by the
Law of God.

4. Now the Nature, Properties, and Conditions of Sin Original being such as
have been described; it is easy to be conceived, how potent it is to conquer
us, and to bring us into Servitude unto it self and unto Satan; Or how it is
that very snare, or a great part of it, whereby such as oppose the truth, are
taken Captive by the Devil (as our Apostle speaks) at his will or pleasure. 2.
Tim. 2. 26. But of this point hereafter.

CHAP. XI.
Containing the Resolution of the maine Difficulty proposed, to wit, How the
First Actual Sin of our First Parents did produce more then a Habit of Sin, an
Hereditarie disease in all their Posterity.
1. The eating of the Forbidden Fruit, did pollute or poison the nature of man.
THe chief Difficulty (at least as some make it) is, How the First Sin whether
of our Father Adam, or of our Mother Evah, or of both, could possibly produce a
perpetual Habit of Sin in themselves, or an Hereditarie corruption of the
Humane Nature, propagated from them throughout all generations. This
difficulty (though) cannot be pressed or drawn unto any Contradiction to the
unquestionable rules of Reason or true Philosophy. The full and clear Solution
of it only surpasses the reach of Reason merely natural, or of Philosophy not
enlightened by sacred History or Mosaicall Relations of the estate wherein man
was created. Surely if Pliny or some other Naturalist had been so happy as to
have diligently perused and believed the Oracles of God delivered by Moses,
Genesis 1. 2. and 3. etc. We Christians this day Living might have had more
satisfactorie Resolutions for clearing this Point, then we can gather from the
Schoolmen or many of the Ancient Fathers. Gregorius de Arimino.
Some Schoolmen do think that our Nature was corrupted by the poisonous
breath of the old Serpent in his conference with our Mother Evah. I neither
know nor remember whether they have any ground of this conjecture from true
Antiquity; or whether it be a Masterlesse piece of their own coining. The
conjecture or Phancie it self is for this reason Less probable, because the
Nature of our Father Adam, who held no parlie with the old Serpent, was no less
corrupted then the Nature of his Consort Evah. Other good writers are of
opinion, that the fruit of the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was for its
specifical quality of a poisonous Nature both to the Soul and body; at Least,
apt to taint or corrupt both: and the first man's nature was tainted by tasting
or eating of it: For of it he did eat as much as Evah did, if not more, though
she were more in the transgression, because she had plucked it from the tree.
And I cannot conjecture any ground why any ingenuous Reader of the sacred Story
should peremptorily reject this opinion, which I (for my poor talent in
Divinite,) hold in some better esteem then a mere or probable conjecture. No
Article of Christian Faith it is, (though we should suppose Faith it self to be
no more then an Opinion) yet to be admitted into the List of pie Credibilia, or
to be ranked amongst such opinions, as may be more piously and more safely
believed, then peremptorily rejected or derided. The Consequence of this
Opinion or Supposition is, That Adam did become his own Executioner, Or as the
Canonists speak, incidere in Canonem, did absolutely inflict that punishment
upon himself, unto which his Creator had but conditionally sentenced him. Genesis
2. 17. But of the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil, thou shall not eat
of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall surely dye. There
was no Necessity Laid upon him by his Creator that he should eat of it; but
such a peremptory Restraint or Command to the Contrary, that whenever he did
eat of it, Death should necessarily follow. And so it did; for Mortality and
Corruption did enter into his Nature with the Figg or Apple which he tasted,
not only upon the same day wherein he tasted it, but in the very same moment.
And the same mortality and corruption are propagated to all his Sons from the
first moment or point of time wherein they begin to be his Sons. Or more
briefly, The Forbidden Fruit, of what sort soever it were, did as truly beget
or bring forth corruption and Mortality in our Nature, as Adam did beget Cain,
or Evah bring him forth.

2. Objections that are or can be made against the former Resolutions, answered.
But it may be (and I presume will be) Objected, That not the Forbidden Fruit
only, but the whole Tree whereon it grew, root and branch, were immediately
created by God, before Adam could taste or eat of it. And if it were for
specifical quality poisonous, or did necessarily taint the whole humane Nature,
being once tasted of: How can either Fruit or Tree be conceived to be any part
of Gods six-days-works, all of which were very good? Or how shall we salve, or
be able to maintain that Maxim of the Wise man [God did not create death, Wisd.
1. 13.
] seeing he did create that poisonous Fruit, by which our Nature was deadly
poisoned? Facilis Solutio, the answer is ready: Albeit deadly poison be not
Good to him that takes it, yet, that there should be poison, or herbs and
fruits in their nature poisonous, as well as medicinal or wholesome, is, and from
the beginning was very Good. Good likewise it was; exceeding Good, that the
First man should have death as well as Life proposed to his Free or
unnecessitatible choice. So the whole fault was in himself; no part in the
fruit which God had forbidden him to eat: For he by thus eating of it did choose
death before life. And however the fruit, which we suppose to have carried
deadly poison with it into his body, were immediately created by God: Yet that
of the Prophet is more remarkably true of our first Parents, then of Israel
unto whom it was directed, Perditio tua ex te; O Adam, Thou wast the cause of
thine own and of our destruction: But of our salvation in and through the
promised seed, Our gracious Creator is the sole Cause and Author. Again, Albeit
Adam did exceeding ill in choosing death before Life: yet This in the
Consequence, by special dispensation of divine Mercy, was Good for us. Our
Nature was not so much wounded or made worse by that unhallowed Food, as our
persons are bettered and our estate amended by the new Covenant in Christ's
blood; unless we abuse those Talents which our Gracious Creator and Red^emer
has given us, as Adam did his. Were Free choice left unto us which now are
living; Whether we would accept that estate or Condition of life wherein Adam
was created, or that which is granted us by the new Covenant in Christ's blood:
He should commit as great a folly as our First Parents did, that would not
embrace the later Condition and refuse the Former.

3 But for the former Difficulty, How more then a Habit of sin; an Hereditary
disease of nature, should be produced by one or two Acts, I am afraid some men
make it seem a great deal greater then it is, more by their own incogitancy
then by any positive Argument that can be brought to enlarge or press it
further, then at the first sight it appears to every young Student. First,
these men take it not into consideration that our First parents might commit
more Actual sins then that One often mentioned, before the corruption of nature
was propagated to their Successors. Besides The Alteration of their diet,
change of dwelling and air, might depresse their nature, and dispose then to a
deeper degree of Mortality and Corruption then they were subject unto when they
were first driven out of Paradise. And Paradise for ought we know, or can
possibly object to the contrary, might, for many conveniences and conducements
to preservation of health whether of body or mind, exceed all other
habitations, as far as Princes Palaces do common Gaoles. What further
impressions other occurrences besides these mentioned, intervenient between our
First Parents Grand-sin and the birth of Cain, of Seth, or others of their
Children, from whom all the Kindreds of the earth Lineally descended, might
make in the nature propagated from them; or what effects or Symptoms our
mother Evah's Longing after the forbidden Fruit might leave in her self or in
her Children, is unknown to us: yet a Point to be considered by such as think
it scarce possible for one Act to produce a Habit. This we know in general;
That the eager Longings of Mothers, or distastes or affrightments taken by
them, do often imprint many hereditary dispositions in their Children. And from
this original, all or most of those strange Antipathies unto meats or drinks in
themselves good and wholesome, and unto other Live or Livelesse creatures no way
noisome, do (as Learned Physicians resolve us) naturally issue. Yet no
Antipathies in private families can be so perpetually hereditary, as those
inclinations unto Evil, or Antipathies unto goodness, which proceeded from the
First wellhead or spring of our Nature, to wit, from our mother Evah: That
being once corrupted, could not but corrupt the whole current. As for Evah's
Lusting after whatsoever other unlawful pleasures, her Longing after the
Fair-seeming Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, we may hence gather to have been
very intemperate and exuberant beyond the ordinary size of unruly appetites; in
that, Holiness with sobriety is more specially at Least under more express
Condition required unto the salvation of the weaker sex, as our Apostle has
it, 1 Timothy 2. 15. Notwithstanding, she shall be saved in Childbearing, if she
continue in faith and charity, and holiness with sobriety. And so is
abstinence from some peculiar sins, or from Occasions of temptations to such
sins as their Progenitors have been most prone unto, more peremptorily required
in their Children, then in Other Men whose Ancestors or Progenitors have not
been tainted with the like sins, nor obnoxious to like temptations.

4. Whether all branches of sin Original do necessarily spring from our first
Parents Sin.
But here if any man be otherwise minded or disposed to contradict what I have
said or shall briefly say Concerning this point, I profess I shall not be
willing to debate the Problem any further with him. Only I must for mine own
part protest, that there never yet arose any doubt or question between me and
my most retired thoughts; Whether there may not be and are sundry particular
Branches of sin or natural inclinations unto Evil, propagated from intermediate
Parents unto their Children or Families for many Generations, which do not by
any Natural Necessity grow out of that Original Stem or Root of Corruption,
whereof all of us are partakers by the Fall of our First Parents. Yet I would
entreat the Reader to take this Consideration along with him; That such
Hereditary ill dispositions or inclinations to some peculiar vices as we mean,
may abate, remit, or revive and be improved through several successions or
collateral Lines of the same Stem, unto which they are (for some generations)
Hereditary, or finally expire, after the same manner that similitude of bodily
Lineaments, feature, or visages do vary, alter, or expire in many Ancient
families: Some Children being more true pictures of their Great Grandfathers
or Grandfathers or great Uncles, then of their immediate Parents: Others again
more like their immediate parents, then to any of their Ancestors, whether by
father or mother. Concerning the Cause or manner How similitudes of feature, of
bodily Lineaments or visages do or may abate or remit in the first or second
Descent, and revive in third or fourth; Vid. inter alios Franciscum Valleriolam
in comm. in Hippocr.
this the Reader must learn from Philosophers or Physicians, as Aristotle or
Galen, which of purpose have searched into this secret of Nature For
illustration of the manner, how hereditary indispotions of the heart or
affections may abate, revive, or expire in the several Descents of families,
the determination of that moral Problem [An nobilitas generis desinat in uno
vitioso?] will be pertinent.

Now that Nobility of Blood, or those inclinations unto Heroical virtues for
which some Ancient Families have been famous, do not necessarily cease or
expire through the vitiousnesse of one Succession, was a point determined in
the Schools when I first knew them. And Experience may teach a LongLiv'd
Observant man, that Two vicious or lewd Successors do not oftentimes so abate
or utterly dead those seeds of virtue which were propagated to them from their
Ancestors, but that they may revive, or be improved in the Fourth Generation or
Descent. The abating, reviving or expiring of them depends most upon their
Education: And so does the abatement or improvement of Original Sin or
inclinations unto Evil. Even that Corruption of Nature which we necessarily
draw from the loss of Paradise, is not equal in all the sons of Adam, though
it be most true; That every one of us is as truly tained with it, as any Other.
Again, though it be universally true; That all men are by Nature Sinners; all
destitute of the Grace of God: Yet is it no part of this Universal truth; to
deny That some Race or Brood of Men are from their birth or Conception, much
more by Education, more graceless then Others are. And yet for such as have
the least measure of sin, whether Original, Habitual, or Actual; Or for men as
we term them, of Sweet Dispositions or Good nature, it is as impossible to be
freed from Natural Servitude unto sin, without the Special Grace of God in
Christ, as it is for the greatest Sinners or most Graceless Brood of men. The
best of us, even after the participation of Grace in some degree, have a
greater measure of one or other kind of sin, then we take notice of, or then we
can Learn from most Professors of Divinity, which have purposely undertaken to
Decypher the nature and haynousnesse of it.

CHAP. XII.
Containing the true and solid Definition of sin, whether Original or Acquired
by vicious Acts or dispositions.
1. THe best attempt that I have read or heard to this purpose, was made long
ago by One who has been so buffeted on both sides, which he sought to teach or
instruct, as would make an ordinary Soldier in our Christian warfare afraid
either to be his Second or to come unto his Rescue, Illyricus his Definition of
Sin Original how far blamable, how far Commendable.
Flaccius Illyricus I mean; a man most happy in Political undertakings and
atchivements, which were rather below then beyond his profession: Yet in his
Treatise Concerning the Nature of Original Sin, or the nature of sin in
general, Two ways unfortunate: First, in that he was not so profound a
Philosopher or exquisite Artist, as it were fitting Every Divine, which will
undertake to handle this part of Divinity, or others which have connection with
it, should be: Secondly, in that he was a better Philosopher and more exquisite
Artist by much, then such Divines, whether in reformed Churches or others,
which have taken upon them to rectify or confute his Errors. These for the
most part run a wider Byaz on the left hand toward the Nominals, then he does
on the right hand from the Real Philosophers or Divines. This man went the
right way to his work, and begun it like a good Artist, by defining or
displaying the Nature or Essence of Original Righteousness, before he entered
into that dispute Concerning the Nature of Original Sin, or unrighteousness.
He rightly and upon demonstrative grounds denies Original Righteousness to be
any quality supernatural, any Accident or property adventitious to the Humane
nature; if we consider that in the Estate wherein it was first created. Nor did
he commit any error (much less incur any censure of Heresy) by avouching
Original Righteousness to have been the Essential form of man, if he had
expressd his meaning with this addition, or limited his expressions thus; [ As
the First man was the work of God, or considered as he was created in His
Image.] For (as I am forced often to repeat) there were not in man's Creation
Two works of God really distinct, either in order of nature or in respect of
time; nor so distinct, as that The One might be imagined to be the Nature of
the first man, or of Gods image in Him, The other, a Coronation of his Nature,
or image of God, with a Grace or righteousness supernatural. For Righteousness
original, to speak properly, could be no other work or Effect imaginable, save
only the Resultance of that image of God wherein our Nature was first molded.
And this Resultance was as immediate unto, and as unseparable from the image of
God wherein the first man was created, as Roundness is from a perfect sphere,
or well molded bullet; or as Equality is from Identity of quantity: Of none of
which there can be two distinct Causes or Operations.

2. To make the Image of God or that righteousness, which by immediate
necessity resulted from Gods image or work, the substance, nature, or essential
form of man, qua talis, as he is man; would be a gross Error or grievous
Soloecism in Philosophy: For so Adam should not have been the same individual
Party or Person after his Fall, which he was before. And this Error in
Philosophy uncontrol'd, would necessarily induce a more dangerous Heresy in
Divinity, to wit; [That the same party which was made righteous by God, should
not be punished for losing this Righteousness, but some other for him.] By the
same reason the Humane Nature it self, which is now polluted by sin* should not
be so much as specifically the same with that which God did in the beginning
create; Our Nature as now it stands, should be wholly a work or Creature of the
Devil.

3. But this Good writer, I mean Illyricus, iterum and identidem, often and
again disclaims all Opinion or thought conceived by him of any Specifical
change of the Essence or nature of mankind, from the first Creation to the
worlds End; or of any Essential Change or destruction of the Individual Nature
or Persons of our First Parents. Yet his Expressions of his meaning sometimes
may seem to infer either a change of Nature or a destruction of the Two
Individuals first created by God It may be that Opinion of some late
Philosophers [Principium Individuationis est a materia; that, The root of
Individuation or distinction of one particular Person from another was wholly
from the Matter, not from the Form, which is the principal part of every man's
Essence or person;] was embraced by him. But seeing he utterly disclaims the
former Conclusions or Inferences, which some would put upon him: it would not
be ingenuous to charge him with them upon Consequences, not of his own, but of
other men's making. The Learned and ingenuous Reader will easily excuse him from
this One Error in Philosophy, seeing he has taught such as will be taught by
him so many good useful Lessons, as no Divine (which I have read) in modern
Churches, has taught more, for avoiding Skeptical or merely Dialectical, and
making solid and theological Definitions in substantial or Fundamental points
of Divinity.^ or no Definition, of sin especially, or of Free Will or other
Controversy depending upon their Determination, can be truly Theological or
such as a professor of Divinity, if he be a true Artist, can brook; unless it
be truly and solidly Philosophical.

4. The difference between a Nominal or merely Dialectical, and a true
Philosophical or Physical Definition of one and the same Real Effect,
affection, or property, The difference between merely Dialectical and
Philosophical or Theological Definitions.
is Excellently set down in sundry Treatises by the Great Philosopher. If this
question [Quid est ira? what is that which we call Wrath or Anger?] were
proposed to a mere Logician, or Dialecticall Grammarian: His answer is upon
his tongues end; Ira est appetitio vindictae: V^ rath or Anger is a es^^e or
appetition of revenge. But this is only (...), a mere Expression what the Word
does signify; or at the ^est but (...), a Definition only of the Abstract
Essence of the Accident or Affection. But if the same question were proposed to
a true Philosopher, to a good Naturalist or Learned Physician, his answer would
be; Ira est ebull^ tio sanguinis circa cor; Wrath or Anger is in truth and
indeed neither less nor more then the boiling of the blood about the heart:
This is the only root or Real Cause whence Anger immediately grows. Yet if we
would take a full Definition of this most unruly passion (which is the usual
Commander in chief, of greatest Commanders:) it must be This, according to the
rules of Art; Ira est appetitio vindictae propter Ebullitionem sanguinis circa
cor; Wrath or Anger, is an appetition of revenge caused by the boiling of blood
about the heart. And from this Definition Every good Moralist, (such all true
Divines should be, and somewhat more) may Learn in part how to curb or tame
This unruly Beast: according to the old proverb, Equo ferocientisubtrahendum
pabulum; by abstaining from all Choleric meats, and by withdrawing his self
from all probable occasions, which by one sense or other may set his best blood
on boiling.

5. He that says, An Eclipse is the privation of light in the moon or other
heavenly starr, speaks properly Enough: For this is the Essential Definition
of that which we call an Ecliose, whether in the Sun or in the Moon: Yet but a
Nominal Definition, which every young Scholar or Academick may Learn out of
his Lexicon. What more then is required to a Philosop^icall or Real Definition
of an Eclipse, whether in the Moon, Sun, or other stars? Nothing besides the
assignation of the Real Cause by which this defect of light is wrought,
whether in the Sun or Moon. The Real cause of this privation of Light in the
moon is the Diametral interposition of the shadow of the earth between the Moon
and the Sun, from whom as from the Fountain of Light, this second Light or
Governesse of the night does borrow its Light or Splendour. Albeit of these two
Definitions, the Grammatical or Nominal be most proper: Yet the Causal, (though
taken alone as Philosophers use to express it) is most Real and more
satisfactorie. An Eclipse in the Moon is the interposition of the Earth betwixt
the Sun, and it: The Eclipse of the Sun is the interposition of the body of the
Moon betwixt the Sun, and us, that be inhabitants of the Earth. Hence we may
Learn that however the Nominal or Essential Definition of an Eclipse, whether
in the Sun or Moon or other Starr, that is, a Privation of Light, be One and
the same: Yet we may Learn more from the Causal Definition of either of them,
then we can from the Nominal Definition of both. In an Eclipse of the Sun there
is no defect or privation of Light in it: We inhabitants of the Earth only are
deprived of the light or Luster of this glorious starr, by the interposition of
the body of the Moon between it, and our bodily sight. Whence we may truly
infer, that the body of the Moon is in it self as impenetrable by Light, or as
incapable of Transmission or free passage of Light through it, as the body of
the Earth is; That the surface only of this great starr is capable of Light by
reflection, as a Globe of steel or other solid Body, whose surfaces are smooth
and Equable: It does not, it cannot transmit Light, or suffer it to be
transfused through it after the manner of glass. Yet if we should give a
perfect and absolute Definition of an Eclipse in the Moon, we must add the
Abstract or nominal Definition of the Eclipse unto the Real or Philosophical:
As thus; The Eclipse of the moon is a true and real privation of light or
splendour, not in respect of us only, but in it self; caused by the
interposition of the body of the Earth, which hinders the transmission of
light which it borrowes from the Sun. But the Eclipse of the Sun is only a
privation of our sight or view of it, occasioned or caused by the interposition
of the dark body of the Moon betwixt this glorious Starr and fountain of
light and our eyes.

6. The maine business wherein Illyricus is so Zealous, was to banish all such
Nominal or Grammatical Definitions as have been mentioned out of the precincts
of Theology, and to put in continual Caveats against the Admission of
Abstracts or mere Relations, into the Definition of Original Sin, or of that
Unrighteousness which is inherent in the man unregenerate. And however St.
Austin, Aquinas, and Melancthon say in effect as much as Illyricus did, if
their meanings were rightly apprehended or weighed by their Followers: Yet his
Expressions of the Nature, Cause, and Properties of Original Sin, were to his
own, and so they are to my apprehension more clear, more full and real, then
any Definitions of Aquinas or Melancthon, Even where they speak most fully
according to their own Principles, unto this point. Aquinas (as this Author
quotes him) some where grantes, Originale peccatum non esse meram privationem
justitiae originalis; that Original Sin is not only a mere privation or want
of Original Righteousness, but a positive or forcible inclination contrary to
it. Melancthon with many Others of the most Learned writers which have been in
the Germane or French Church since Luther began to renounce the Romish Church,
acknowledge and Define the same Sin to be (...), a Disorder of our faculties
and Affections, or which is more, a Depravation of our nature, Or in other
terms, whether Greek or Latin, fully equivalent unto these. Wherein then does
this singular writer (as some do censure him) either differ from, or go beyond
Aquinas, Melancthon, or Others? all of whom respectively grant as much, and
some of them more then is included in the Definitions or descriptions of Sin,
forecited out of Aquinas and Melancthon.

7. Illyricus defines Original Sin not by the Abstract, but by the Concrete,
as thus: Original Sin is the Nature of man corrupted, or the affections or
Faculties of our souls and bodies disordered and depraved etc.. He no where
defines it to be the Nature, the Substance, or Faculties of men absolutely
considered, or without Limitation; Yet to be All these so far as they are
depraved and corrupted, or transformed out of that Image of God which was
seated in them by Creation, into the image or real similitude of Satan. In man
considered as he was the work of God or made after his image, there was an
exact Harmony or consonancie of Will unto the Law and Will of God; an Exact
Harmony of Faculties and Affections amongst themselves, and a sweet
subordination of them unto the reasonable will or conscience, whilst that held
consort with the will and Law of God. But by the First Man's Fall or wilful
transgression, all parts of this Harmony are lost: The sensitive desires,
Faculties, or Affections are at continual jarr and discord amongst themselves.
The best consort they hold is to fight jointly against the Reasonable Soul and
Conscience or spiritual part of our nature; especially so far as it holds any
Consort with the Will of God. His Definition then of Sin by the substance or
Nature of man as that is depraved or corrupted; and the Definitions, of other
Writers which define it to be the Depravation of our nature: or the difference
between him when he defines it by the Faculties or parts of our nature as these
are disordered or instamped with the image of Satan, and other Divines, who
define it, to be an Ataxie or disorder of the Affections and Faculties, if we
calculate their several Expressions aright, they come all to one Reckoning:
there is no more material question or real difference betwixt them, then if
we should dispute, whether Three times four, or four times three: Or two
times six, or six times two, do better express or decipher the number of
twelve: Or whether Harmony be a Consonancie of true voices or sounds; Or true
voices or sounds perfectly Consonant.

CHAP. XIII.
Calvin and Martyr etc. consent with Illyricus in the Description of Original
Sin: How far Sin Original may be said to be the Pollution of thewhole Nature
and Faculties of man, or the Faculties of man as they are polluted.
1. The opinion of Calvin and Martyr concerning the nature of Original or
acquired Sin.
BEsides many Other good Writers, Calvin and Martyr in their Definitions or
descriptions of Sin in the unregenerate man, consort so well with Illyricus,
that he that will condemn any One of them, will be concluded not to acquit
either of the other Two: He that approves One of them, cannot but approve the
Other, if he either understand himself or them.

Calvin defines Sin Original to be a Pravity and Corruption of nature: Calvinus
definit Peccatum Originale esse naturae pravitate^ ac corruptionem: ac mox
exponens se, dicit: Imo tota hominis natura quoddam est peccati semen: ideo non
odiosa and abominabilis Deo esse non potest. Quae profecto ipsissima ratio
formaque peccati originalis est, and ipsam certe essentia^ hominis pessimam
describit. Martyr quoque super Rom: definiens Peccatum Originale, eamque
definitionem explicans, non obscure id ponit in ipsa mala Essentia hominis:
dicit enim totum hominem corruptissimum esse: definit vero inquiens: est ergo
peccatum totius hominis naturae depravatio a lapsu primi parentis in posteros
traducta, and per generationem etc. Et mox definitionem explicans, inquit; In
hac Definitione omnia genera Causarum habentur: pro materia aut subjecto
habemus omnes hominis parts aut vires. Forma est earu^ omniu^ depravatto etc.
En! audis, ei, originale peccatum complecti etiam ipsas hominis parts ac
vires, quatenus sunt corruptae ac depravatae. Illyricus in libello cui Titulus
(...) etc. Basileae impresso, anno. 1568. page 140. and 141.
and presently, explaining himself, says: yea the whole nature of man is a
Kind of Seed of Sin: and therefore cannot but be odious and abominable to God.
which truly is the very Form (Essence or Definition) of Original Sin, and
describes (or descryes) surely the Being of man to be very Evil. And Martyr
upon the Rom: Defining Original Sin, and explaining that definition, manifestly
places it in the Evil essence of Man; for he says, That, The whole man is most
Corrupt. And then defines it Thus, Sin is the depravation of the whole nature
of man, Transmitted to posterity from the Fall of our First Parents, and by
Generation etc. And then opening the Definition, he Says: In this Definition,
are found all Kinds of Causes. For the subject Or Matter we have, All the
parts or powers of man. The Form is the Depravation of them all. Lo! you see,
that according to Him (Martyr) Sin Original Comprehends the parts and powers of
man so far forth as they be corrupted and depraved. Illyricus in a Book
entitled Know thy self.

2. But these Definitions or Descriptions though (for ought I know, or have to
except against them) they may be most Orthodoxal for their truth or substance:
yet the right Limitation of them or of the subject defined, is not free from
further Question, as First: Whether the Subject of them be Sin Original, or
Acquired, as one or both of them are seated in the Natural or unregenerate man,
or as they are inherent in part in the Best Men after their Regeneration, or
Purification of their hearts by Faith. If every Part, if every Faculty or
member of the Humane Nature be from the womb tainted with this Foul Leprosy:
it will be somewhat hard to conceive, how any Part or Faculty should be
absolutely freed from all degrees of corruption by Regeneration; unless we
grant, that All are in some measure freed from it, and acknowledge some
Relics of Sin Original to remain in every part or Faculty of the man truly
Regenerate or renewed in the spirit of his mind. It may in the First place be
conceived that the Mind or Conscience of men so renewed, may be thoroughly
cleansed, not only from the guilt, but from the real stain or pollution of sin,
and yet the flesh or whole sensitive parts or faculties of the same man, still
lodge some Relics of Original Corruption in them; though in a Lower degree or
Less measure, then the same Corruption dwells in the Conscience or Spirit of
the unregenerate or Natural man, Or if we grant the Mind and Conscience of
sanctified men to be yet subject to some Tincture or Relics of Corruption:
Yet these we must acknowledge to be so weak and feeble that they cannot hinder
or diminish the Reign or Sovereignty of the Spirit over the flesh, by which the
Yoke of servitude unto Sin, or slavery unto Satan (unto which all men before
Regeneration are by Nature subject) is utterly broken. If we consider Man as he
was first molded by God, he was for nature, substance, and Faculties of his
soul, like a sound Instrument well string'd and better tuned. But by eating of
the forbidden fruit, and loss of Paradise, his very substance was corrupted
and deprived of Life Spiritual: and all his Powers or Faculties not only
corrupted, but distuned. Our Nature by Regeneration is Restored to Life
spiritual, yet not to perfect health and strength so long as we carry this
burden of Flesh and Mortality about with us. By the same Spirit of Regeneration
the Powers or Faculties of our souls, and our sensitive Affections, are better
tuned then they were before: yet not so sound or well tuned as in the First
Creation they were, but like to Asymmetral or harsh voices which never hold
consort with sounds or voices truly Harmonical; or like to those which we call
False strings in a stringed Instrument, which by no skill either of him that
tunes or handles it, can be brought to bear a part in exact Harmony: Both such
voices and such strings will still retain some jarring sound or discord in an
accurate and observant Musicians Ear; though much less when the string is
stricken open, or upon a Lower stop, or the voice taken at a lower Key, then
when they are stretched higher. For with the height of either sound, the discord
or Dis-Harmony is still increased.

3. Whether sin Original or Acquired have an influxe into every Act of the
Humane Soul.
But when Calvin, Martyr, and Illyricus make Original Sin to be the whole
Nature of Man and all his Faculties, so far as they are corrupted and taintted;
I know not whether their meaning were, that there is no Action or thought of
man, though Regenerate, into which this Corruption of Nature or Taint of sin
has not some Influx; or whether they did actually or expressly mind this or
other like Inference, when they exhibited unto us the former Definitions of
Sin. For my self, as I make no question but that The Blessed Virgin her self
was by nature the Daughter of Adam, and therefore not so absolutely free from
her Conception, as her Son our Savior was: So I am afraid to avouch or think,
that either Sin Original or acquired (it being supposed that she had some
Relics of both in her) should have any influence into, or commixture with
that Good Thought or Actual consent which she yielded to the Angel Gabriel,
Luke 1. 38. Ecce Ancilla domini, etc. Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it
unto Me according to thy word.

4. But these are Niceties which I would not have touched, had it not been that
Some (whom I name not) have gone too far in opposition to the Papist or
Pelagian: unto whom, Others, by coming too near, have fallen much wide or short
of the Truth, My aim and intention (as I often profess) is not to take upon me
either by voice or pen to instruct such as are or take themselves to be pro
modulo viatorum perfectly Regenerated, much less men altogether certain of
their own Personal Election or Salvation. The utmost of my endeavors is to
direct my self; and the height of my desires in this work, is, to advise Others
what we are to do for our selves, or what is to be done for us after Baptism or
Confirmation, that we may be thoroughly Regenerated, or which is in effect all
one, make our Election sure. We are, I take it, in the First place to Calculate
the number of our sins, and to measure or weigh the Body of Sin inherent in us,
whether by Nature, or invited by our selves; (not by a corrupt worldly Dialect,
but) according to the scales or Standard of the Sanctuary. And to this purpose
no man has given better hints or directions then Illyricus. For as he often
observes and well illustrates; In the Dialect of our Savior himself, of his
Apostles and Evangelists, whatsoever is repugnant to the Law of God, or
abominable in his sight, is accounted sin: and so are not Accidents or mere
Abstracts or Relations only, but specially the very sustance or Nature of man,
so far as that is polluted or corrupted with Sin, or wrought and transformed
into the image of Satan. Now though it be true which was said before, that in
exact Philosophical or Theological Calculation, the Definitions of Sin given by
S. Austin, Calvin, Martyr, etc. and Illyricus, come in the Issue to One and the
same reckoning: yet to vulgar or ruder Apprehensions, Illyricus his Definitions
which for the most part are Causal, but especially his Illustrations of them
out of Scripture, are far more dilucide and more powerful to work upon our
affections, and to encourage our spirits to undertake our Christian Warfare
against the Old Man or Body of sin.

5. Illyricus his Illustrations of sin more, Consonant to Scripture, then
Calvin's or Martyrs.
To what purpose were it to tell unlettered or ordinary men, that the Old Man
or Body of Sin which we are to crucify or mortify, is (...) or (...),
inordinatio or depravatio; unless we could persuade them, that these were
names of Giants, and paint them with far more hands, then Briareus; with ten
times more heads and mouths, then Cerberus or Geryon had; and with more snakes
instead of hairs upon their heads then Medusa, (according to Poetical pictures)
is emblazoned with; or make some representation of them in more ugly and
horrible shape, then the Devil and Infernal Fiends are pictured by old Monks
and Friars in their Books and Legends: Albeit even these be but silly
representations of infernal Powers, with whom even Christian Children after
they come to the use of Reason, or to wage war, as O Ecolampadius somewhere
excellently observes. For every man to whom God has given Grace or power to
Reflect upon his Younger Years, or to survey
his own Heart, His Affections, or Inclinations either past or present; may
respectively find a more exquisite Live Image of Satan within himself, then any
Painter can make. Though few or none in this Age be bodily possessed with a
Legion of Devils, yet most men either by Nature, ill breeding, or bad Company,
if they would rightly examine Themselves, their Actions, their Passions, or
projects by the Rule of Scripture, might easily discover more then a Legion of
unruly, lewd, or vain Thoughts, of unhallowed Desires or vicious Habits; such
as are Malice, Pride, Envy, Incharitableness, etc. which daily plead or fight
for the Sovereignty of the Law of Sin or Lusts of the flesh, over the Dictates
or motions of the Law of the Mind or Spirit. And these are the true and most
exquisite pictures or images of the Diabolical Nature. And it was a wish or
Prayer worthy to be written with the point of a Diamond, (as I have seen it
written) though in no sacred place, Lord deliver me from my self. His meaning
which wrote it (I take it) was, that he might be delivered from vicious or
unruly Thoughts or Habits or other like Soldiers of Satan, which every man
before Mortification of the Flesh or Renovation by the Spirit, does suffer to
be Lodged, or Billeted in his Breast.

6. For Conclusion, to give the Intelligent Reader a more full Definition
of Sin or of the Old Man which we are to Crucify: It is, or contains all the
works of the Flesh or Inclinations contrary to the Law or Spirit of God,
necessarily resulting from our Nature or substance, since it was corrupted in
our first Parents, by the subtilty or power of Satan as the Efficient Cause,
still Laboring to obliterate the Image of God wherein we were created, and to
mould us into his own Likeness; to the end that he may withdraw us from the
Service of God which is perfect Freedom, and make us everlasting Slaves to
himself and his Infernal Associates.

7. Likely it is I should have Slighted Illyricus as much as Many Other of my
Profession do, upon a prejudicial Noise or Cry raised against Him: At least I
should not have taken that care and pains in perusing and examining His
Opinions which ^ have done, unless the Book or Treatise had been long ago
commended to a Learned Friend of mine, upon very high Terms, by that Reverend
and Great Divine, Doctor Field then Dean of Gloucester.

SECT. III.
Of Servitude unto Sin: Who be properly Servants unto It, and by It unto Satan.
CHAP. XIV.
That even those Jews which did in part Believe in Christ, were true Servants
unto Sin.
31. Then said Jesus to those Jews which Believed on him, If ye continue in my
Word, then are ye my Disciples indeed.

32. And ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you Free.

33. They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any
man: How say thou, ye shall be made Free?

1. AS We rightly gather, that part of man's body to be most corrupt, Unsound,
or Ulcerous, which is most afraid of the Chirurgions hand or Instrument, which
must heal or cure it: So these Jews may hence be truly convicted to have been
as our Savior censures them, truly Servants unto sin; or in S. Peter's
Expression, Servants of Corruption, in that they are so Touchie and Jealous of
the very mention of being made Free: Albeit our Savior (if you mark his
process) does handle them as warily and tenderly as any skillful Surgeon
could do the most dangerous sores or ulcers of his most impatient Patients. For
he did not say, If you continue in my Word, then are ye my Disciples indeed,
and I will make you Free. Although if he had thus said, he had said the Truth.
For HE it is, and HE alone that must make all the Sons of Adam Free. A
paraphrase upon John 8. ver. 31. 32. 33. etc.
But as He had an Eagles Eye to discover their hidden sore and a Lions Heart to
unrip or Lance their sore unto the quick: So he had likewise the Third
property of an Excellent Surgeon, to wit, a Ladies hand, to touch them
gently and tenderly. He tells them the Truth, but in a placid and most
inoffensive manner, by soft and gentle degrees; If ye continue in my word, then
are ye my Disciples indeed. And ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall
make you Free. And who could be offended or unwilling to be made Free by the
Truth, but such as were desperately sick of Falsehood and Corruption? Such and
so affected were these Jews which did in part believe on our Savior. For they
had no sooner heard him making mention of being made Free, though by the
Truth, but they instantly return this repinning and impatient Answer. We be
Abraham's Seed, and were never in bondage to any man: How say thou, ye shall
be made Free?

2. Many Good Interpreters do question the Truth of their Answer, as whether
they were not at this very time in Bondage to the Romans. And Tullie in his
Oration Pro Flacco, (whose crime was aggravated, for that he had alienated or
detained some Gold which had been gathered toward the adorning or beautifying
the Temple at Jerusalem,) to Elevate or lessen that conceit which many Romans
had of the Nation of the Jews, as of a People better beloved of the Gods, then
other people were, objects little less unto them, then (as they apprehend) our
Savior in this place does; to wit, that they were in Bondage to the Romans:
or at least (if they were not in Bondage) they were more beholding to the
Clemency of the Romans, that did not make them Servants, having lately
conquered them; then unto the Favor of their God or Gods, which had suffered
them to be Conquered. For it was an unquestionable Prerogative of the
Conquerors in those days, to bring all such as wilfully or desperately
resolved to try their C^^se in battle with them, into Civil Servitud or
Bondage, if so they pleased. They held it no sin, but rather a matter of
Courtesy or kindness to exchange death, which by title of war was due unto
the Conquered, for Servitude or Civil Bondage.

3. The Jews in our Saviors time were no slaves unto the Romans either de
^ure, or de Facto.
But to do these Jews no wrong; Their Answer unto our Savior was not
altogether so false, as Captious, seeing it consists of two parts, Both
Negative: The one de Facto, That they were not Servants; That they never had
been in Bondage unto any man. And this part of their Answer may well seem
False, if they extend the meaning of it unto the time of Abraham or Jacob. For
Jacobs Seed or Posterity was in bondage unto the Egyptians: The Condition of
the whole Nation under the Babylonians or Chaldaeans was little better. But it
may be, That they intended their Answer only in respect of themselves or their
own times: And so it is True, that they were not de Facto in Bondage to the
Romans, or to any Man. For the Romans suffered them to enjoy the Privileges
of Free Men; to use the Liberty of their own Laws, though with subjection or
subordination in many points, unto the Laws of the Romans.

4. The other part of their Answer was de Jure; and this was most true; That
being the Seed of Abraham, they could not justly (especially so long as they
continued in their native Country) be made Servants or Bondslaves by the
Romans, in that they had a more Just Title unto the Land of Promise, by being
the Seed of Abraham and Sons of Jacob, then the Romans themselves had unto the
Kingdom or Empire of Italy, or unto Rome it self. The mighty God, and Supreme
Lord and Sole Possessor of Heaven and Earth, had given the Land of Can^an unto
Abraham and to his seed, by more express Covenant and peculiar Title, then the
Kings of Nations had to their Crowns or Scepters: All which notwithstanding
they hold immediately from the same God. The attempts or practices of other
Nations against this people were always frustrate and void in Law, even by the
Law of God; save only in Case that he were displeased with them, and suffered
such as hated them to be Lords over them. In which cases they were to be no
Longer in Civil Subjection unto others, then till they returned to him by
Repentance, confessing their Sins and the Sins of their Forefathers: Thus
doing, their Charter for free enjoying the Land of Canaan, was so Absolute, so
durable and strong, that no authorized customs of Men or Nations could
prevail or praescribe against it. So that the matter of their Answer in
respect of Civil Servitude or Bondage was absolutely True de Jure; and de Facto
too, if they meant it, or we restrain it unto the time wherein they were under
the Government of the Romans.

5. The forementioned Jews were true Slaves unto Sin:
But how true soever both ways it were, It was altogether impertinent, nothing
at all to the purpose or Point in question. For our Savior no way intended to
object, nor does His speech any way imply, any Civil Servitude, or that they
were, or ought to be, or had been at any time Servants unto Men; but only that
they were Servants unto Sin, which indeed was the worst Master, that they or
any man could serve. Thus much his Reply unto their impertinent Allegation,
expressly and Emphatically averres, Verily verily, I say unto you, whosoever
commits Sin is the servant of Sin. And though by Title of Law, as well
Divine as Humane, he be, whosoever it is, a King or Lord over others in
respect of Civil Servitude or Dominion: Yet till he be Freed from the dominion
of Sin, he has the Condition or property of a Servant. What is that? Our
Savior tells us in the next words; The servant abides not in the house for
ever, that is, He has no Right nor Interest in the House wherein for the
present his abode or continuance is, but only durante Domini bene-placito, so
long as it shall seem good unto his master, and no Longer: But the Son (says
our Savior) abides in the house for ever; because the Inheritance belongs to
him. This Saying or Maxim of our Savior is grounded upon the Civil Customs
or Law of Nations, concerning the Right or Privilege of the Son or
Firstborn, in respect of Servants; but is most remarkably true of the Son of
God: He is the Only Son, the Only Heir, not Apparent only, but the Only Heir
Possible of that House, whose Builder and maker is God. In that He is Gods
Only Son, He is the Only Lord, the Only Heir of All things that were builded,
that were created by Him; Not Free only in his Person, but induced with full
Power and Authority to make all others Free, that seek unto him. And this his
Power is so absolute and plenarie, that without him none can be truly and
indeed set Free: For so he himself concludes, If the Son therefore shall make
you Free, ye shall be Free indeed.

CHAP. XV.
Containing the General Heads of this whole Treatise: And of the Distinction
betwixt Slaves, and those which we call Hired Servants, or Apprentices, or
Freeborn Persons in their nonage.
1. THat we may understand our own Estate by Nature, and the inheritance
whereunto we are entitled by Grace, better then the Jews did, we are to
discuss these Three Points:

First, Wherein Civil Bondage or Servitude does consist; Or, What be the
Properties wherein Servants differ from Freemen:

Secondly, What Proportion or Analogy Servitude to Sin has unto Civil
Servitude; And whether such as our Savior says are truly Servants unto Sin,
be more truly and properly Servants, then such as are Legal and Civil Servants.

Thirdly, the manner How the Son of God does set us Free from the Bondage or
Servitude of Sin.

2. Of the Condition of slaves and Hired Servants.
Servitude is opposed to Freedom: And we cannot well know what it is to be a
Servant, unless we first know what it is to be a Freeman. We do not mean a
Freeman of this or that Corporation, but a Freeman simply, or one that is
Free by Birth or condition of Life. Every one in this sense is said to be Free,
that has Right or power to dispose of himself, of his Children, of his Lands
or Goods, or of his own Actions or Employments. Every one likewise is a
Servant, that being come to full years is deprived of this Right or power to
dispose of himself, of his Lands, of his Goods, of his Actions or employments
either in whole or in part. As for Children or such as are under Years, though
borne to be Lords over others, yet whilst they are under years, they are
properly neither Freemen nor Servants: Although as the Apostle teaches us,
Gal. 4. 1. 2. they participate more of the Nature of Servants then of Freemen:
Now I say, that the Heir as long as he is a Child, differs nothing from a
Servant, though he be Lord of All, but is under Tutors and Governors, until
the time appointed of the Father. For this Reason, one and the same word in the
Original is promiseuously used for Children and for Servants, because Neither
of them are at their own disposals, but at the disposals of their Guardians or
masters.

3. According to the several Extents of this want of Power or Right to dispose
of themselves, of their Actions or Employments; Or rather, According to the
Extent of others Right or Power to dispose of them in all these, there be
several Degrees of Servitude, and diverse sorts of servants. Some, as the great
Philosopher in his Politics would have it, are Servi a Natura; were framed by
Nature only to serve, or to be at other men's disposals, as not being able to
dispose of themselves. Such as had strong Bodies but weak Brains were in his
judgment more fit to be governed by Others, then to govern themselves. But this
kind of servitude is improper. For Omnis servus est alicujus Domini Servus;
Every Servant is the Servant of some particular Lord or Master, whose Interest,
whether in his Person or employments, must be grounded upon some Special
Title. Such as by Nature are destitute of wit or Reason, Qui ubique est,
nusquam est; He that is every where, is no where.
do not thereby become Servants, unless we should say, they were every man's
Servants, that are disposed to employ them. And this Privilege they have of
others, That they are not capable of any Contract or Legal Title, by which
they may make themselves, or be made This or That man's servants: And being no
man's servants, they can be no servants.

4. Though our English [Servant] be derived from the Latin Servus: yet servants
in our English tongue we call many, which a good Latinist would rather call
Famuli then Servi: being indeed Servants, that is, at other men's disposals, but
in part only, not in whole; whom for Distinction sake we call Apprentices or
Hired Servants: Over whose Actions or Employments their Masters during the time
of their hire or Apprentiship, have full right and Interest; and Authority
likewise over their Bodies or Persons, to correct or punish them, if they take
upon them to dispose of their Actions or Employments otherwise then for their
Masters Behoof, or as they shall appoint: But over their Persons, their Bodies,
their Goods or Children, their Masters have no Right nor Interest. They may not
take upon them by our Laws to dispose of These, as they do of their Day-Labours
or bodily Employments. Yet are these properly called Servants, as having made
themselves such, or are so made by their Parents or Guardians, upon some
Contract, or by some Branch or Title of Commutative Justice, in which there is
always Ratio dati and accepti, somewhat given and taken, that binds both the
Parties: As in this particular case, The Master gives and the Servant receives
meat, drink, and wages; And in Lieu of these Benefits received, the Servant
yields up, and the Master receives a Right or interest in his bodily and daily
Labors, and a Power to dispose of these. Yet are they Servants (as we said)
only in part, not mere servants.

5. Mere Servants (or servants absolutely or in whole) were such as the Latins
called Mancipia, such as we call in English Slaves or Bondmen, or such as
sometimes out of a superfluity of speech or expressing our selves, in our
Native Dialect, we term Bondslaves. For a Slave is as much as a Bondsman: and no
Bondsman can be any more then a slave. A Bondslave is a Name which has no
Reality answerable or fully commensurable unto it. Unto this state or Condition
of life, that is, of being a Slave or Bondsman, no man is bound or subject by
Nature; No Man will willingly or voluntarily subject himself. Such as
heretofore have been, and in diverse Countries yet are, Servants in this sense,
were made such by others from a pretended right or Title of Conquest, and were
called Mancipia, quasi manu Capti, because they had been taken in War, and
might by rigor of Justice, at least by rigor of Hostile Law, be put to Death,
as men convicted of Rebellion by taking Arms. Now the price of their
Redemption from death, was loss of Civil Liberty as well for themselves as
their posterity. These were truly and properly called Servi, according to the
native Etymology of this name in Latin, Servi quasi Servati; They were again
wholly and merely Servants, according to the utmost extent of the Nature, and
of the Real Conditions or properties of Civil Servitude: that is, Their Lords
or Masters had an absolute Right or Interest not only in their Bodily Actions
or Employments, but over their very Persons, their Bodies, their Children, and
whatsoever by any Title did belong unto them. The Interest, Power or Dominion
which Masters by the Civil Law or Law of Nations, had over their Servi or
Mancipia, their Slaves or Bondmen, was altogether such, and as absolute, as a
Freeholder has over his own Inheritance or Fee simple; that is, a power or
Right not only to reap or take the Annual Fruits or Commodities of it, but full
Right to Let or Set for Term of years, or to alienate or sell the Property:
For so were Bondmen and their Children bought and sold, as Lands and Goods or
Cattle are with us. All the Right, Dominion, or Interest which Masters with us
have over their Servants or Apprentices, is only such as a Tenant or
Lease-holder for some limited time or Term of years, has over the ground or
soil which he pays Rent for: that is, a Right or Property in the Herbage; a
right or power to reap the Fruits or increase of it during the time of his
Covenant, but no right to alienate or sell so much as the Earth or Gravel, much
less to alienate or make away the Fee-Simple or Inheritance, which is still
reserved unto the Owner. Thus the Bodies or persons of hired Servants are their
own: Their minds and Consciences are Free, even during the time of their
service. But the Use or employment of their Bodies in services Lawful and
Ingenuous, is their Masters: So are the Services of their wit, for
accomplishing with care and diligence what by duty they are bound to perform.

CHAP. XVI.
That the former Difference of Servitude or Distinction of Servants is set down
and allowed by God himself.
1. THis Difference of Servitudes or Distinction of Servants is expressly
delivered in Holy Scripture, allowed and approved of by God himself, Levit. A
Paraphrase upon Levit. 25, 39, etc.
25. 39, etc. If thy Brother that dwells by thee, be waxen poor, and be sold
unto thee, thou shall not compel him to serve as a Bond-servant. But as an
hired servant, and as a Sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee,
unto the year of Jubilee. And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his
Children with him, and shall return unto his own Family, and unto the
possession of his Fathers shall he return. For they are my Servants which I
brought forth out of the Land of Egypt, they shall not be sold as Bondmen.
From this place these two points are clear: First, That if an Israelite were
waxen poor or in debt, he might Lawfully sell or alienate the use of his own or
of his Childrens bodily employments unto his Brother, for the maintenance of
his and his Childrens lives, or for the discharge of his debt, until the year
of Jubilee, but no Longer. But to sell the bodies or persons of himself or of
his Children was not permitted by the Law of God: Nor might any Son of Abraham
or Jacob buy or sell any of their Brethren, though willing to sell themselves
or their Children. But on the contrary, If through necessity, that knows no
Law, any Son of Jacob sold himself unto the Heathen: or in case he and his
Children had been seized upon for debt: his Kinsmen or Brethren were to redeem
him, or at least not to suffer him to serve any longer then the year of
Jubilee. And during that term he was to serve only as a hired Servant, and not
as a Bondman. From this Law, if they had no other Reason, the Jews here spoken
of might safely plead; That in as much as they were Abraham's seed, they neither
were nor could be in bondage unto any man de jure.. The reason why the Lord
would not have them to be in bondage unto any man, is in the Law expressed,
Because they were His Servants by a peculiar Title; because he had redeemed
them from the bondage and thraldom, unto which the Egyptians had de Facto, not
de Jure, most unjustly brought them.

2. Secondly, from this Law it is clear, That God did both allow and authorize
the Israelites and seed of Abraham, to have Bondmen of the Nations round about
them, or of the strangers that sojourned amongst them that they might bequeath
the very bodies and persons of them and their Children, as an inheritance and
possession unto their Sons and posterity forever, ver. 45, 46. That is, They
had the same Title or interest in them; the same absolute power or Dominion
over them, as they had over their Lands, their Goods, or Cattle; that is, power
to alienate or sell them or their Children, for their best commodity at their
pleasure. Of this second sort of Servants or Bondmen, which were in Bonis
alterius, the goods or possessions of their Masters, are our Saviors speeches
in most Parables to be understood, wherein mention is made of Servants without
distinction. So we read, Mat. 18. 25. That the Lord of that ungratious Servant,
which would not forgive his Fellow an hundred pence, commanded him to be sold,
and his Wife and Children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. Our
Saviors speech, though it be a Parable rather then an History, is grounded
upon an Historical or positive truth: He speaks according to the common Custom
of those times and places, by which not only the Servants themselves and their
Children, but whatsoever they had gathered together, were wholly at their Lords
or Masters disposing. For as we say, Superficies sequitur Solum; He that is
Lord or owner of the soil or ground becomes thereby Lord and owner of the
House, which another man builds upon it: So in like case, He that is Lord of
another man's person or body, does thereby become Lord of all his goods, or
whatsoever he may be thought to possess. But so it is not with hired servants
amongst us; for in as much as their bodies or persons are Free, and are no part
of their Masters goods or possession, they may be true Owners, Lords, or
Possessers of whatsoever they got either by their own industry, or what
otherwise may fall unto them by deed of Gift, by death of friends, or the like.

3. Wherein Bondmen and Hired Servants do in diverse points agree.
But though Bondmen and hired Servants do in other points differ, yet in many
they agree. Most Maxims whether Legal or Moral, which are true of the one, are
true likewise (though in different manner or proportion) of the other. As for
Example, When our Savior says, No man can serve two Masters, but he shall
either love the one or hate the other; or lean to the one, and despise the
other: This saying in many cases may be specially and more remarkably true of
Slaves or Bondmen; yet very true of hired Servants. For every man is so far
truly and properly a Servant, as he is at another man's disposal. And every man
is so far truly and properly a Lord or Master over another man, as he has
right or power to dispose either of his body or of his actions or Labors. Now
in as much as the Master of an hired Servant or Apprentise has as absolute
right or interest in his Actions, his Labors, or employments, as the Master of
a Slave or Bondman has in the actions or employments of his Bondman: it is
as impossible for the One, as for the other, to execute the will and pleasure
of two men that differ in their particular employments or designs. It is the
duty of a faithful Servant to execute not his own will, but the will and
pleasure of his Master. But if so it happen that two Men or more may concur or
consent to employ One and the same Man in the self same business and service:
then, as we say, Many stones make but one Load; and many things of several
weight but one burden: So in this case, two or three, or more Men thus
concurring in the same designs, make but one Master. But faithfully to execute
the wills of men that differ in their Designs, or fully to satisfy two or more
men that have several and full Interests in one man's actions and Labors, is as
impossible, as for a body to move two contrary ways at once.

4. The most General and most Essential property wherein both sorts of Servants
do univocally agree, How Bondmen or H^red Servants are differenced from Freemen.
by which they formally differ from a man absolutely Free, is thus gathered by
Tully, Liber est qui vivit ut vult; He is Civilly Free (for that was the chief
Freedom that he knew, and the Freedom whereof we now treat) that may live or do
as he will in matters of Civil Pass or commerce. And by Contrary, He is a
Servant, that in matters Civil, non vivit ut vult; that either cannot do as he
would, or ofttimes must do as he would not. Or to give the very Radical point
of difference betwixt the Master and the Servant, of what rank soever the
Servant be; we are first to know wherein they agree. Both of them Essentially
agree in This, in that they have a reasonable will or desire to do themselves
good. For, such as God has deprived of the use of reason, whether by Nature or
from their birth, or by subsequent mischance or Accident, are neither capable
of Dominion nor Servitude; They can neither properly be Masters nor Servants.
He that is a Freeman or Master, in those things wherein he is Free or a Master
has not only Voluntatem propriam, but Arbitrium proprium; not only a
reasonable Will or desire to do himself good, but with-all a power or Faculty
to dispose of his time, of his Actions or employments for compassing or
attaining the good which he desires. The Servant whilst he is a Servant has
no arbitrium proprium, no Right or power to dispose of himself or of his
actions or labors, for compassing or atchieving that good, which, in that he
is a reasonable Creature, he can as truly affect or desire as his Master does.
Any Master or Man that is Free, if at any time he find himself Melancholy or
misaffected in body or mind, may allot what hour or hours of the day he please
for the Exercise of his body or Recreation of his mind, and make choice of what
company, of what sport or recreation he please; so it be Civil and ingenuous,
or such as the Law does either approve, or not condemn: But this may not a
Servant do without his Masters especial leave or license. For seeing his Master
has as good Right or interest in his actions or Labors, as he that pays
rent for grounds, or hire for an Horse, has in the use of both, during the
times of their hire: It is a branch of the same fraud or Couzenage in a
Servant, either to alienate or convert his Actions or Labors to any other end
then to his Masters behoof, as it is in a man that takes money of Another for
his Lands or Grounds, and yet will reap part of their annual fruits or
commodities; The same offense in a Servant to mispend that time in play, sport,
or idleness which should be spent in his Masters employments, as for a man to
take interest for money lent, and not suffer the Party to enjoy it wholly
during the time for which he paid interest.

5. Again, An hired Servant may as truly and lawfully desire to increase that
power, stock, or means which he has either gotten by his service, or has been
left him by his Friends; as his Master in like case may do. But he may not use;
it is unlawful for him to use the same means for increasing his portion, that
his Master may do. For First, He cannot without wrong to his Master take so
much time for contriving his own profit or commodity, as his master without
wrong to any man, may do. Or Secondly, Though he had time enough to contrive
his ends: yet can he not without wrong to his Master have time enough or take
liberty to practice the means for effecting or accomplishing what he has
contrived: As he may not without his Masters leave frequent Markets or meeting,
where gainful bargains or opportunities of increasing his means are to be had.

6. Again, It is Lawful and honest for a Servant to wish well unto his
friends; or to be willing to do them good, that have done him any; But it is
not so Free or lawful for him to employ himself, his time, or Labors to do
them any real good or friendly office, as it is in like case for his Master.
Nay a Servant in this case shall often be constrained to bestow his pains for
their good, whom he least affects; and to neglect, or to do nothing for them,
to whom he wishes most good; whom he loves best. For all his Actions or
employments are at the disposal of his Master, who if he command him to do
some business for his own enemy, but his Masters Friend, though to the
prejudice of his own Friend, but his Masters Enemy; (unless the action be
unjust, or by the public law forbidden,) He must do his Masters Will, not his
Own. Nor would any Ingenuous man like worse a Servant in thus doing, but rather
the better. So that every Servant has a Freedom of Will to desire that which
is good for himself or to his friend; but has oft-times a Necessity laid upon
him, aut non agendi quod vult, aut agendi quod non vult, either of not doing
that which he most desires to do, or of doing that which he most desires not to
do. But unto this necessity or inconvenience no Freeman is either by Law or
Conscience subject: And no Ingenuous man will voluntarily subject himself for
any other man's pleasure, especially if he be but his equal, or one that has
no more peculiar Interest in him, then another man may have. The answer of the
Roman Orator does better become a Free and Ingenuous man, as he was, then a
Servant. When his potent Adversary expostulated with him, Cur tu Inimicum meum
defendis? He wittily replied, Cur tu Amicum meum accusas? It was as Free for
him to defend Him that was an Enemy to the Accuser, as it was for the Accuser
to accuse His Friend. And it may be the Elegant Poet of these later times, did
take the hint or matter of his Epigramme from this passage in the Orator Odero,
sijubeas, Selium tibi scilicet H^stem:
Si, mihi, tu Selium, quod sit Amicus, ames.
Selius, because your Foe, I Will hate in mind,
So you will love him, for that he is my Friend.


Thus much of Civil Servitude, or the Condition of Servants. The second point
was; What Analogy or proportion this Servitude, or Servants to Sin have to
Civil Bondage, or to such as are truly and properly Servants by Humane and
legal Constitutions.

CHAP. XVII.
What Analogy or proportion Civil Servitude has with true Servitude unto Sin.
1. FOr the truth of this Conclusion, [ Whosoever commits Sin is the
Servant of sin] no further or better proof (as has been praemised) can be
expected, Servitude to sin, the most proper kind of Servitude.
then our Saviors Authority. But in what sense this Conclusion is true: Or
Whether such as commit Sin, be truly and properly termed Servants, or Servants
only in a Metaphorical or borrowed sense, some happily will make Question or
doubt. For mine own part I make none, as being from many particulars
sufficiently informed; That such of our Saviors Speeches as not unto ordinary
Hearers only, but unto many good Interpreters seem only borrowed or
Metaphorical, have for the most part a more exquisite Literal and Concludent
sense, then the same words or speeches have in common Language or in ordinary
faculties or vulgar Arts: And such a Metaphysicall sublime Concludent sense,
His words that spoke as never man spoke, always have, when his speeches are
Doctrinall and Assertive; as his words are Joh. 8. 34. most Universal, most
Peremptory and Dogmatical, Verily, Verily, I say unto you etc.

2. Now as it cannot be denied that this name of Servitude is (as we say)
(...), a Term that may be properly attributed in different measure to many
subjects of diverse natures or Conditions: So the prime and principal subject
of it, unto which it agrees in most exquisite and ample manner, is, not the
Legal or Civil Servitude whereof we have hitherto treated, but the Servitude
of Sin Whereof our Savior here speaks. Whence although we stand bound to
believe the truth of this Conclusion from his Authority alone; yet this no way
bars us from Searching other reasons or Arguments, whether from Art or
Nature, for illustration of this truth, or for confirmation of our Belief or
knowledge of it. Or rather, His Emphaticall manner of averring it, ought to
incite us to sound the meaning of it a little deeper, and to discover the
reason of it to the bottom. And thus doing we shall but follow the stepps of
two of our Saviors Apostles S. Peter and S. Paul, in this very particular.
Both of them having occasion to use the same Assertion, that our Savior here
does, give us the reason of the truth or property of this Assertion. So says
S. Paul. to the Romans, Cap. 6. 16. Know ye not (as if it were matter of gross
ignorance or imputation, not to know) that to whom Ye yield your selves
servants to obey, his Servants ye are to whom ye obey: Whether it be of sin
unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness. So that there is a proper
Servitude in yielding unto Sin: And whosoever yields his consent or obedience
unto Sin, does thereby make himself the true and proper Servant of Sin.

3. And S. Peter. 2. Epistle. 2. Chap. having sharply taxed such Carnal
Gospellers as had forsaken the right way and followed the way of Balaam, which
Loved the ways of unrighteousness, brands them with this note or Character,
That whilst they promise Liberty unto others, they themselves are the Servants
of Corruption. And this Assertion he ratifies by this reason or Doctrinall
Principle, Of whom a man is overcome, Of the same he is brought into Bondage.
This reason touches the very root of Bondage or Servitude properly so called,
which had no other Title to its First Being or introduction into the World,
besides the right or title of victory or Conquest. Now to be subdued or
vanquished against their Wills, though in a doubtful or bad Cause, is not so
meritorious of slavery or bondage, as to suffer our selves through our sloth,
through our Cowardice, our supine negligence, or treachery to be overcome in a
true, a just, a necessary, especially in a religious Cause. He to whom men
yield themselves Servants by betraying or not defending such Causes; though he
love the Treason whereby he gains the victory, will use the Traitor or Party
vanquished by him, but as a slave or Bondsman.

4. The First and Radical Point of difference betwixt a Servant and a Freeman
in matters civil, was before set down, and it was this: A man that is Civilly
Free has not only Voluntatem propriam, a reasonable will to desire his own
good, or a Freedom of consultation to contrive the means how this good may be
attained; but withal a Right or power to dispose of himself, of his time, of
his bodily Actions or employments for executing his intentions or
Consultations. The Servant has the like Reasonable Will to desire his own
good; a Natural Power or Faculty to deliberate or consult by what means the
good which he requires may be attained; but no Right or power to dispose of
himself, of his time, of his bodily Labors, of his actions or employments for
executing his desires, or deliberations; for in all these he is at his Masters
disposal. Now the want of this power or liberty to proseute their own
contrivances, makes Servants for the most part more slow and more dull in their
desires, and more unapt to contrive the means for compassing what they desire.

5. From this Difference between Servitude and Freedom or Servants and Freemen
in matters Civil and Politic, The measure of transgression of the Law of God,
the only true measure of Servitude.
it is but a short Cut and easy pasage, to discover the right Difference
betwixt Servitude, and Freedom, in matters moral and sacred. Sin (as the
Apostle speaks) is the transgression of the Law. And every Transgressor of the
Law, to wit, of the moral Law of God; that is, Every such Transgressor, as we
call Malefactor or Offender; Every one that delights in transgression or has
no power to resist temptations to transgress, is truly and properly the
Servant of sin. Rectum (says the Philosopher) est mensura sui and obliqui:
Aright Line is the measure of that which is crooked as well as of that which is
straight. Now the right Line or Rule by which as well our desires as our
Actions must be framed, by which the Obliquities of both must be discovered or
censured, is the Moral Law of God. This is the only Rule by which the height
or degrees as well of our Freedom as our Servitude, Wherein the best of the
Heathens did err, as well in their Definitions of Liberty as of Happiness.
must be measured. For want of this Rule to direct them, the wisest among the
Heathens have either much erred in the Definition of Liberty or Freedom, or at
least come far short of the truth in defining it. Quid est Libertas nis
ipotestas vivendiut velis? what is liberty or freedom (says In Paradoxis.
Tully) but a Power or Faculty of living as we would? But this Definition or
description of Liberty or Freedom is very defective and Lame, like a Sentence
without the Principal Verb, or a Body without a Soul. Man's Will in the state
of corruption or since Adams Fall, is no competent Rule for Humane Actions: It
self must be regulated by the Law of God, whether positive or Eternal. The
very life and spirit of perfect Liberty, in whomsoever,
is, Potestas volendi quod lex divina jubet, that is, a Power or Faculty of
willing that, which by Gods Law we ought to will. And this power or faculty
being supposed as the Soul: Potestas vivendi aut agendi quod volumus, that
other power, which Tully only mentions, of Living or doing as we will or
desire, is but the Body of true Freedom or Liberty. So that he only is a true
and perfect Freeman, that has both the Body and Soul of perfect Freedom: that
is, tampotestatem volendi quod deceat, quam vivendi ut vult, as true a power to
will what he ought, as to do what he will. So much as a man has of this
Freedom, so much and no more he has of true Happiness. Some Philosophers
there were, which defined Happiness after the same manner that Tullie defined
Liberty. Him they accounted Happy which lived according to his own Will. But
God forbid (says S. Austine Epist. 121. ad Probam,) that we should take this
for Gospel. Quid si enim nequiter velit vivere? for what shall We think if a
man were disposed to Live wickedly or naughttly? August. Epist. 121.
Nonne tanto miserior esse convincitur, quanto facilius mala ejus Volunt as
impletur? May be not hence be convinced to be so much the more miserable, by
how much it is more easy for him to accomplish his naughty will? And therefore
this Opinion (as the same Father avoucheth) was rejected by such Philosophers
or wisemen, as were without knowledge of the only wise immortal God. For, One
of those Philosophers or wise men (says the same Father) Vir Eloquentissimus
(whether he meant Cicero or Seneca, or some other I know not) condemns the
former Opinion as an Heresy in Philosophy, and gives this Reason for it;
Velle enim quod non deceat, idipsum miserrimum: Nec tam miserum est, non
adipisci quod velis, quam adipscivelle, quod non oporteat: To will that which a
man ought not to will, is the greatest misery that can befall a man: Nor is it
so great a misery not to atchieve what we desire, as to desire to atchieve, or
endeavor to compass that, which we ought not to desire.

6. Quid tibi videntur haec verba, (says the same Father unto his Friend to
whom he wrote this Epistle) nonne ab ipsa veritate per quemlibet homin e^ dicta
sunt? What, do you think, were not these words derived from the Fountain of
Truth, by what Conduit or channel soever they have been brought unto us?
Therefore we may say of this Saying, as S. Paul does of a Prophet or Poet of
Creet, whose sentence did please him, Testimonium hoc verum est, this Testimony
is true, and worthy the receiving. And from this saying that Reverend Father
concludes, Ille igitur beatus est, qui omnia que vult habet, nec aliquid vult
quod non decet; He is truly happy that has all things which he desires to
have, being disposed to desire nothing which he ought not. This Conclusion is
as necessary and true in the Argument whereof we treat: He only is a true and
perfect Freeman, which has a power or Freedom to desire nothing but what be
ought, and a power or Freedom to dispose of himself, and of his endeavors, for
attaining or compassing what he thus desires. So that this Freedom consists in
the service of God: And that consists in a submission to his Will, and in
reliance upon his most absolute Power to accomplish whatsoever he will, or
whatsoever He shall think fitting for us to will or desire at his hands.

7. As absolute Happiness; So absolute Freedom is only in God. Both are
Essential only unto him: that is; He only cannot be deprived either of
Happiness or of Freedom, by any other: Nor can he be willing to deprive himself
of them. Non Deus volens iniquitatem Tu es, says the Psalmist, Psalm. 5. Thou
art not a God, that can will iniquity, as the Gods of the Heathen did. It is
as impossible for our God to make such Laws, or to grant such dispensations
with his own Laws, as the God of Rome and Roman Catholics, the Pope does; as
it is for this God of Rome, to make himself the God of Heaven. He cannot
dispense with the Law forbidding marriage betwixt Uncle and Niece: He cannot
make Laws to authorize murder. It is the First Part of his happiness, to be
able to Will only that which is Good, Just, and Holy: the Second, in that he
has absolute power to do whatsoever he will in heaven and earth.

8. Men and Angels in their first Creation had a true image of this their
Creators Happiness and Freedom. And this image of their Freedom did consist in
a power or faculty of Willing only such things as were good and pleasing to
their Creator: Secondly, in a power or faculty of Framing their inferior
desires or appetities of Sense, and of squaring all their actions and
endeavors acording to the rectitude or Rule of their Reasonable will. But this
Power or faculty, wherewith both Men and Angels at their first Creation were
endued, was in respect of both its objects or branches, as well in respect of
willing only that which was Good, as of their ability to do what they would,
mutable or contingent: It was not Essential to them, as to God. Though Man by
Right of Creation was truly Free: Yet he had a true possibility of losing his
Freedom; a greater possibility of ceasing to be a Freeman, then of ceasing to
be a man. As he was created after Gods image, he was actually and truly endued
with Freedom: But as he was a man created of nothing, he was capable of
Servitude: And by his folly or wilful presumption he brought himself and his
posterity into Bondage unto Satan? Who by the like but greater presumption and
more wilful abuse of his Free Will or power over himself, did bring himself and
his Confederate Angels into greater and more desperate Servitude unto sin and
wickedness, then he could draw our first Parents unto; albeit he drew them
into true and proper Servitude, and to this day draws all such as seek not to
be set Free by Christ in this acceptable time which is allotted here on Earth,
into absolute, complete, and desperate Servitude; into such an irrecoverable
estate as he and his Angels are in.

CHAP. XVIII.
of the several branches of Servitude unto sin.
1. THe principal Branches or stems of this our Servitude unto Sin, are Four.
The First, an Impotency or want of power of doing that which we would, or a
necessity of not doing that which Reason and our own Conscience tells us to be
Good, The degrees or Latitude of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Branches
of Servitude unto sin.
or that which the word of God expressly requires at our hands, as a due Service
unto our Creator and Redeemer. The degrees or Latitude of this branch must be
taken from the necessity of the duty or precept Commanding obedience, and from
the degrees of our impotency or want of ability to do what is commanded, which
sometimes grows into a Necessity of Nonperformance. The Second branch of our
Servitude consists in a necessity of doing what we would not: that is, of doing
that in the Particular, which we utterly dislike in the General, as being
contrary to the Rule of Reason, or to the dictate of our Consciences in our
sober and ret^red thoughts, or contrary to the express word of God, which
ought to be the Rule as well of our Actions as of our Wills and desires. Of
these two branches of Servitude is that of the Apostle, Romans 7. 14, 15. For we
know that the Law is spiritual: but I am Carnal, sold under Sin. For that which
I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
And verse. 19. For the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would
not, that do I.

2. The Third branch of this servitude unto sin consists in an Impotency or
want of ability to will or desire those things which we ought to desire. The
Root of this branch is Ignorance, either of those good things which may be
known by natural light of Reason, or by the word of God. Of this branch of
servitude, or of Servants of this rank or Condition, is that of the Apostle
especially true and intended by him, Ephesians. 4. 18.
That they have their minds darkened, and the eyes of their understanding
blinded, through the ignorance that is in them.

3. The Fourth and last Branch, which is likewise the worst, consists in a
Necessity of Willing and desiring that which we ought not to desire or will.
Against this branch of Servitude, or men thus affected, is that Woe of the
Prophet in particular denounced; Esaias 5. 20. We unto them that call evil good,
and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put
bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. Of this Third and Fourth Branch is that
of the Apostle, Ephesians. 4. 19. Who being past feeling, have given themselves over
unto Lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

4. The Third Branch, or Impotency of willing that which we ought, or that
which we are in duty bound, not only to will, but to do, is such an Infirmity
of the Soul, as we see in some men's bodies, which have lost not only their
digestive Faculty, but all appetite of wholesome Food. This Fourth and last
Branch, which consists in a Necessity of willing that which we ought not to
will, is like to that distemper of body which Physicians call the Pica or the
Malacia, that is, a ravenous Appetite or greedy Longing after such things, as
are Loathsome and unnatural.

5. These Branches of Servitude unto sin either natural or acquired.
All these Branches of Servitude, but especially the First and the Third, are
Twofold; either Natural or Acquired. Or to speak more properly; The Roots and
First seeds of them are natural and hereditary from our first Parents: The
Nutriment, the Growth or increase of them is for the most part from men
themselves, not from Adam: These are acquired or purchased by ill Education or
breeding,
by lewd Company or bad Customs. Never was there any son of Adam but upon
Examination might have found himself oft-times indisposed, unapt, or altogether
unable, to do many things which in the General he approved as Good, and in his
retured thoughts he desired to do; and for the not doing of which, when
opportunity served, and occasions required, his wakened Conscience or
After-thoughts would often check him, Never was there any son of Adam, whose
Conscience upon a review or Examination of his Actions, would not accuse or
condemn him for doing many things, which in better Mood he desired not to do,
and such things as he had promised to himself and his own Conscience, if not to
others, not to do.

6. But this Necessity of doing many things which in their sober mood they
resolve not to do,
or of doing them in such a high measure and degree as oft-times they are done,
is not Hereditary to any Son of Adam. This is a necessity which men bring upon
themselves, either by frequenting Lewd Company, or by bad Custom, or at least
have it brought upon them, not by Adam, but by the bad example or ill
instructions of their immediate Parents or Overseers. As for the Fourth Branch
of Servitude, which consists in a Necessity of willing or desiring those things
which men ought not to desire; this of all the rest is least hereditary: For it
includes a degree of Iniquity with which we cannot charge our Father Adam. He
indeed sought to mince or mitigate his offense after he had wilfully committed
it; and thus to do was a grievous fault or offense: But we never read, nor have
we any reason to suspect, that he did delight or glory, either in this or in
any other Sin; or use his sins past as an advantage or Rise to mount himself to
Sin* We do not read that Cain did glory in the murder of his Brother Abel; or
that Judas did make himself merry with the price of blood: Both of them were
servants unto Sin, and by sin unto Satan. Their Servitude unto sin in general
was hereditarie, and necessarily derived unto them, as it is naturally unto all
us, from our father Adam. But neither was the One a Murderer or Fratricide,
nor the other a Traitor, by natural d scent or inheritance. Judas became a
Traitor by making himself as base a Servant or vassal to Covetousness; yet not
so great a servant to the one or other Sin as those which delight and glory in
these or the like Sins. For though the Scripture has concluded all under sin,
as well the Jew as the Gentile; Though the best of men, as the Scripture
teaches us, be by Nature the Servants of sin: yet we read of some whom the
Scripture has branded with this mark, that they have sold themselves to work
wickedness or do mischief. And these are slaves to Sin, and Bondmen unto Satan
by a double Title; the One by natural descent or inheritance; the Other by
their own voluntary Acts, as it were of bargain or Sale. Cain and these Jews
mentioned, John 8. which persecuted our Savior, because his works were Good
and theirs were evil, were not only the Sons of Adam, (though that were enough
to make them Servants of Sin;) but as our Savior tells them in the 44. verse of
that 8. Chapter, They were of their Father the Devil.

7. But to descend unto a more particular survey of Every Branch, beginning
with the First and Second which are for the most part coincident, and so
mutually wrapped together, that we cannot truly handle the one but we must touch
the other. For, The First (as has been said before) consists in an impotencie
or impossibility of doing that which we oft-times desire to do, and approve as
good. And this impotency or impossibility does ordinarily proceed from, or draw
after it a necessity of doing that which we destire not to do, and which in
our better thoughts we altogether condemn as naughty, and unfitting to be done.

8. Some measure of these Branches was clearly discovered by the wiser and more
sober sort of the Heathen. How far the Testimonies of the Heathen are
Authentic for the truth of this Doctrine delivered.
And the men which were most subject to either, were adjudged by them to be
true and proper Servants; Slaves in a higher degree and larger measure,
according to a more base and odious slav^rie, then such as by Legal Title were
slaves or Bondmen; unless these also were equally subject to the like base
conditions or lewd dispostion of mind. However, This lewd disposition of mind,
or corruption of manners and affections, whether in Bondmen or in their
Masters, was adjudged by the very Heathen to be more base and servile, then the
Legal estate or condition of known Slaves or Bondmen.
But before I acquaint the Reader with the opinions of Heathens in this point,
I must request him not to mistake my meaning or intention, as if I esteemed the
Verdict or Testimony of the best Philosophers amongst them, to be in themselves
of any credit or authority in matters sacred, in mysteries of Faith or
Divinity. I would rather request him to consider with me; That many
testimonies, which are of no credit in themselves, nor can borrow any
authority from their Authors, may be notwithstanding of very good use for the
confirmation of better Authority, or for the discovering or bolting out the
truth: whose Authority by what means soever once discovered, or from whom
soever it do proceed, is always great and ought to prevail, as in the end it
certainly will prevail against ignorance and error, in whomsoever they be
found, though patronized by men, otherwise of extraordinary parts, and deserved
authority. For example, The testimony of a known Liar, whose Oath we would not
take for six pence, is good and lawful against himself. A notorious Thief or
Malefactors own confession, especially if it be deliberately made, and
judicially taken, is a Conviction as sufficient and Authentic, as the
depositions of two, or three, or more, most honest men. Now the same Law or
reason of the Law, which in some cases admits the testimony or confessions of
dishonest men for legal proof, will warrant us to admit the opinions, but
especially the reasons of Ancient Heathens, which never knew the true God, nor
Jesus Christ whom he had sent, for sufficient and Authentic Testimonies to
convince the Athiests of later times, or such as live without God in this
present world, or such amongst us, as having much better means then the best of
the Heathen had, to know God and his Christ, yet live altogether without any
true fear or love of Either, and in as little sense or feeling of their own
natural Servitude or present bondage unto sin, as the rudest or worst sort of
Heathen did.

9. Yet further; Albeit the wisest and best sort of Heathen Philosophers lived
in Bondage unto Sin, and died Servants of corruption: yet did they not always
speak out of the corruption wherewith their very Souls were tainted Many things
they spoke and wrote out of the Law of nature written (as our Apostle
testifies, Romans 2. 15.) in their hearts. By the Light of which Law likewise,
they did many things contained in the written Law of God: For, not having that
Law, as the Apostle there says, they were a law unto themselves. Now as the
testimony or confession of a notorious Malefactor voluntarily and judicially
made against himself, is suffcient to condemn that Judge or Juror, of injustice
or partiality, that would not take it for a legal proof or conviction: so shall
the Allegations or collections of the Heathens, which were themselves Servants
unto sin, be of Authority enough to condemn us of a worse crime, unless upon
their informations we make more particular and exact inquiry; First, into the
servile Estate or Condition wherein we were born, and in which, until our
regeneration, we still continue; Secondly, into the means by which we may be
redeemed from the same Estate or condition. Now the means by which we must be
redeemed, the most learned amongst the Heathens, after long search, guided in
part by the Light of Nature* could not discover. But as in other Cases, so in
this; when they seemed to be wise, they became Fools: When they sought to set
themselves Free by Rules of Art or Philosophy from one or Few branches of this
Servitude, they entangled themselves Faster in some others.

10. It was a Beam of Truth, a step or approach to Freedom rightly discovered
by In Paradox.
Tully, Si servitus sit, sicut est, Obedientia fracti animi, and abjecti and
arbitrio carentis suo, (...)etc.
Quis neget omnes Leves, omnes Cupidos, omnes denique Improbos esse Servos? If
servitude (says he) be, (as no man, even in the most strict proper and legal
sense, can make any more of it then) the obedience of a broken or crazed abject
mind, deprived of all power or right to dispose of it self or its own Actions:
Who can deny all inconstant vain men, all Covetous, generally all Wicked men
to be truly Servants? To press his General reason a little further, and to
draw it from the very First root or spring of Servitude properly so called: All
men, as well the wicked as the vain or inconstant, have a desire to be Happy:
For Happiness is the mark whereat our intentions aim, but of which most men in
their Courses fall much wide or short. For inasmuch as we cannot attain unto
the End, but by the Means (or mean) which are useful for attaining that
Happiness which we most desire: Partly through our natural weakness, but
especially through Satan's cunning, these useful Means intercept most of our
time, most of our pains and endeavors, which should be reserved for purchase
of the End For so it is with most of us by Nature, as with young unexperienced
or Careless Apprentices or Factors, who finding some extraordinary contentment
in the First Inn they come at, spend most of their time and money there, which
should have been spent at the Fair or Mart for which they were Bound. The
special Means whose Use is Necessary to the attainment of that Happiness which
we most desire* are specially Three; Delight of Mind, Contentment of the Body,
and Competencie of Wealth. Now albeit in our First Aims or intentions, we
desire not These For Themselves, nor in any Extraordinary Measure: yet such is
the Frailnesse of our Nature, that, Whatsoever things we much Accustom our
selves unto, they will at length Plead See Chap. 21. ^. 5.

S. Aust. Confess. 1. 8. c. 5. Says, I was bound not in Gaolers Irons, but by

nor the third of Understanding, nor the fourth of Will; Least it break out into
Act. And One Act will produce Two, and Two Four, and so it will double
infinitely, and soon bring the Heart to be as hard as the Nether-Milstone, the
Anvil, or the Adamant; obliterating very principles of nature and Grace; and
implan^ing such reprobate and debauched Notions (rather Fictions) of men's own
corrupt minds, as shall serve their Turns and Lusts, and at Last drown them in
perdition. See Jer. 13. 23. Romans 2. 5. Esaias 5. 20. See Chap 29. Sect. 5.

Impossibility we bring upon our Selves of doing those things which are most
available to the attainment of true Happiness. And to be thus indisposed or
disenabled to use our best wits or best Endeuvours for purchasing that Pearl
which we most Esteem, is a true and Natural Branch of Servitude and Bondage.

CHAP. XIX.
Of the Excellent Notions which Tully, and some Heathen Romans of Lewder life
then He, had, of Servitude unto Sin, or vice.
1. Several sorts of Servitude observed by Tolly, in Paradox. Quod soli
Sapientes liberi; Stulti, servi.
THis Roman Orator had So had Horace, in Damasippus. Sermon. l. 2. Sat. 3.
observed Some of Great Birth and place, to spend much of their means in buying
Curious Pictures, Satues, or the like; and much of their time in contemplating
and admiring the skill of the Artificer. These He censures as Servants unto
Toys and Fooleries. -- * quarere amabar, Quo vafer ille pedes lavisset Sisyphas
aere: Quid Sculptum insabre, quid fusum durius esset.
Yet if one should ask these men that had thus enthralled themselves unto their
idle Fancies, Whether they did not in heart desire to be truly Happy, Callidus
hu^c Signo ponebat millia centum, etc. --
they would have answered that they desired Nothing so much; nothing else.
Insanit veteres statuas Damafippus emendo. Sermon. l. 2. Sat. 7.
Now he that by his own Confession desires nothing so much as to be truly
Happy, Tu cum Pausiaca torpes insane tabella --
* is by the light of Reason and Rule of Nature, -- Ego cum Fulvi Rutubaeque,
Aut Plaoideiani contento poplite miror Praelia, Rubrica picta, aut carbone:
velut si Revera pugnent, feriant, vitentque moventes Arma viri. --
bound to will nothing besides Happiness, so much as that which comes nearest
unto it, or is most available for the purchase or attaining of it. Epist. 6.
lib. 1.
And who then but a Slave or vassal to his own Fancy, I nunc, argentum, and
marmor vetus aeraque and arts Suspice: Cum gemmis Tyrios mirate Colores.
or one whose Fancy had made a Fool of him, could ever hope or imagine, that a
Living man could be made Happy by gazing on Livelesse Pictures, Juvenal. Sat.
8. v. 103.
or admiring Images of the Dead? Et cum Parrhasit tabulis, Signifque Myronis
Phidiacum vivebat ebur, nec non Polycleti Multus ubique labor; rarae sine
Mentore mensae.
But if this Question had been distinctly put unto them, happily they would
upon deliberation have denied, See Sat. 11. v. 92. and 120. Sat. 14. v. 305.
that they did seriously hope to become Happy by this Practice, in which
notwithstanding they most delighted. Herein then they were most unhappy, most
miserable, true and proper Servants; in that by inconsiderate accustoming
themselves unto these or the like unnecessary delights or fruitless Fancies;
they had utterly disenabled themselves from living such a Life, as at the first
they most desired to live, and yet most desire, that they could live; but are
not able, as having alienated the Use of their time, of their imaginations, of
their understandings, of their best Endeavors from the Service of Virtue, or
serious study of true Wisdom, in which, Happiness by their own
acknowledgements did properly consist.

2. Others, the same Tully in his time had observed, who, though they were
Noblemen by birth, yet were slaves or Servants in a more base kind of
Servitude and bondage, then the former; Servants according to the second Branch
of Servitude before mentioned. Shall I ever count him a Freeman (says he) over
whom a Woman bears rule? One who suffers his Mistress to impose Juvenal. Sat.
6. v. 213.
Nil unquam invita donabis conjuge: vendes
Hac obstante nihil: nihil, haec Si nolit, emetur.
Haec dabit affectus: ille excludetur amicus
Jam senior, cujus barbam tua janua vidit.

Laws upon him? if she ask, he must give: If she call, he must come: Ego vero
istum non modo Servum, sed nequissimum Servum, etiamsi in amplissima familia
natus sit, appellandum puto. This Heathen by light of Nature and help of Art,
had discovered and made observation of that General Truth, which our Apostle
delivers, Romans 6. 16. That unto what desire soever a man does yield himself, or
consecrates his principal time, his actions or employments, he makes himself a
true and proper Servant unto it. The desire of Juvenal. ib. v. 55.
Quosdam praecipitat subjecta potentia magnae

Et nimias poscebat opes, numerosa parabat

Honor, of Superiority or Sovereignty over others, which sems to be the most
Free; yet even This, as by instance he proves, is a hard, an imperious, and
cruel Mistress unto him that entertains her best. Not One of an Hundred that
hunts after Honor or Preferment, but has more then ten Masters to One, for
every servant that he keeps. As for the inordinate desires of wealth, of Lands,
or inheritance; they are no parts of a Rather of a Madman: says Horace. Sermon.
l. 2. Sat. 3.

Dum doceo insanire omnes, Vos ordine adite.

Danda est Hellebori multo pars maxima avaris.

Sed plures nimia congesta pecunia cura Strangulat --.


Freeman, but the properties of a base or sluggish Servant. But which is worst
of all; After excessive desires have got the victory over our souls, they bring
in a new Lord or cruel Master worse then themselves, that is, Fear or Terror,
arising from the Consciousness of Sin, into which there is no excessive or
immoderate desire, though it be of things in themselves not unlawful, but will
in the end plunge our Souls, when we shall as one day we must, call our Souls
unto an Account for our Expense of time and employments.

These and the like Paradoxes, (as Tully himself did foresee they would be
esteemed no better) were Dogmatically avouched by Horace his live Characters of
true Slaves. Sermon. l. 2. Sat. 7.

See Persius his imitation of Horace, in This (as he does in other passages,
very much) Sat. 5. v. 85. etc. In his Dialogue betwixt Dama a slave (lately)
and a Stoic.

3 Davus (whom this witty Poet brings in, Acting the one part of a Satirical
Dialogue with his Master, according to the Ancient custom of the Romans, by
which their Slaves were authorized to use Liberty of speech more then Civil, in
their Saturnal or December Feasts) first taking this General as granted, That
all men, at Least the Romans were true Slaves, divides them into Two Sorts or
kinds.

4. The First sort did constantly delight in some one or few vices: The other
being of better Birth were fluctuant between Virtue or Civil Honesty, and base
vices. -- Modo recta capessens Interdum pravis obnoxia. etc. He instanceth in
one Priscus who was never Uniform to himself, much less conformable to any
constant Rules of good Life; sometimes wearing three Rings on his Left hand,
with other Cognizances of his Gentility, or ingenuous Birth; sometimes not so
much as one Ring upon either hand, nor observing any other Garb or token of
Gentility. Oftentimes having touched at some great Senators or Noble-mans House
in a Robe befitting his calling, would instantly change his Habits, and hide
himself in such base houses, as no cleanly Libertine (that is, as we say, a
Freeman of the First Head) would willingly be seen to go in, or come out of.
For the other Part of this Slaves division of men, he instanceth in one
Volanerius an old Sinkanter or Gamester and Scurrilous Companion by profession,
who was so delighted in this accustomed trade of Life, that after the Gout had
so hammered and bemaul'd his joints, that he could not so much as finger a Pair
of Dice, did hire a Slave to take them up and throw them for him. This man, in
this Slaves opinion, was so much less wretched or base then the former
Gentleman Priscus, by how much he was more uniform to himself, and more
constant in his wonted course of Life; whereas the other was perpetually tossed
between contrary inclinations, as if he had been sometimes so hard tied that he
could not but stand upright; oftener let Loose, to fall foul or grovelling.

5. The Hypothesis or issue of this saucy Thesis or Generality was this; That
the Gentleman Priscus did represent his Lord and Master, as Volanerius did
Davus himself; who by his own acknowledgement was constantly addicted to one or
two of his Masters bad qualities, vet a Servant but to one Lord besides his
Belly; Whereas his Master had subjected himself to many unruly Appetites and
enormous desires, all contrary to the Dictates of his own Reason or Conscience
in his more private and retired thoughts. So much of the Law of Reason and of
Nature was implanted in this his Master, that he could highly commend the
manners and practices of the Ancient Romans: And yet if any good spirit did
invite or move him to follow their example, he was as ready to kick at the
motion or the practice in Particular, as he had been to commend the pattern set
him, by the Ancient Romans, considered only in the General. Being not invited
by his betters abroad, a moderate homely dish of broth, of herbs, etc, was
most applauded by him; and his family free from molestation. But if Mecaenas or
any other great Potentate had upon short warning invited him to supper, he
instantly declared himself to be a Slave both to his Belly and to his
Superiors; and a Tyrant withal to his Servants; chiding one for not bringing
him Oil; beating another for not bringing him water or other preparatives, with
more speed then could in reason be expected. From these and the like Inductions
Davus concludes his Master to be more then a Slave or (...), an instrument
endued with Life and motion; a mere (...) or Wooden Picture of a Man which had
no mastery over his own motions or resolutions, having subjected his Will and
Reason to dance attendance upon Every Great man's will or pleasure, like a
puppit upon a string, which, it has no power to wag or move, but is moved upon
it at the pleasure of the master or practiser of this kind of childish sport.
The rest of this Slaves Arguments (all concludent) to prove his Master or such
men as he was, to be more sottish slaves then himself: the Reader may find
briefly set down in the eighth book of these Commentaries, Sect. 2. Chap. 7.
page (in Quarto) 63.

CHAP. XX.
Of the Fruitlesnesse of the former Notions in the best Heathens.
1. BUt what did it boot this Satyrist to know all this, or to mark the most of
the Romans his Countrymen to be indeed true Servants? Horace and Tully both
true Servants, though they knew not to whom.
He himself laid nothing of all this to Heart. The best use we can in
discretion presume to be made of this Observation, was to make himself and
Others merry; setting down his observations by way of Play or Interlude. He
lived, and for ought we know, dyed an Epicure, not in Practice only, but in
Opinion; One that accounted it the greatest part of misery or Servitude, to be
wedded to one kind of Bodily Pleasure, or carnal delight. And the greatest
Happiness he aimed at, was to be Free to taste and try all kind of Pleasures,
so far as they were not hurtful unto his body.

2. As for Tully, though he handled his matters a great deal more gravely and
soberly, and were much better in Opinion: Yet in the issue of his discourse He
seems rather to change his Master, then any way to set himself Free. He was not
indeed such a Servant to his own Imagination or Fancy, not such a Servant to
Covetousness, to Lust, perhaps not to Ambition or Superiority of dominion, as
He observed the most other Romans to be: Yet he was a greater Servant to His
Own Will, then others were to their inferior desires. His very Will it self
was in Servitude, as having no Rule to rectify it, unless it were the Roman
Laws which though in many particulars they were Good: yet Such as were too
much addicted unto the entire Frame of them, Or Such as gloried in the wisdom
or Excellency of them, were brought unwittingly to exercise Enmity against
God, and his Anointed Christ. Such as the Romans accounted their Godliest
Patriots or Common-wealths-men, were always the Greatest Enemies unto the
Jews or Professors of Moses Law before our Saviors time, as unto the
Christians after our Saviors death. God in his just Judgments did send them
such cruel Kings as Tiberius, and Nero, because they were so cruelly bent
against the Professors of his Gospel. What could it advantage these or any
other Heathens to know themselves to be in Servitude, not knowing unto whom
they were in Servitude, or whose Servants they were de Facto, nor by whom they
were to be made Free? Some good Notions they had of vice or of Sin: But of
Satan or his wicked Angels they had not so much as heard; or at least what they
had heard of them, they accounted but Toys or Fables. And that which was the
Root of their misery, and strongest bond of their Slavery was, that they
worshipped Friends or Devils, as if in their opinion they had been Gods,
because able to do them bodily harm or bodily good. Now in offering Sacrifices
(as our Apostle says) unto Devils, they did solemnly and publicly profess
them to be their Lords and Masters. So that they were not only professed
Servants unto Sin, but professed Servants unto Satan. In worshipping them and
doing them Service, they did that which was worthy of stripes; and were to be
beaten, yet with fewer stripes then the wicked Jew, or such as confess Christ
to be their Lord, and yet will not learn to deny ungodliness. For these
Heathens did not know, that they had such a Lord or Master, whom they were
bound to serve: And not knowing him to be their Master; how was it possible
that they should know his will? But we acknowledge him to be Our Lord; We know
his will; We know the End of his coming into the World, was to destroy the
works of Satan. Now if we shall labor to build up that which He came to
destroy: we shall prove our selves not only to be servants to sin, and by Sin
Servants unto Satan; but professed Enemies and Traitors unto Christ.

3. Many that call Christ Lord, true Servants to Satan.
Our Saviors Sentence is Universal; Whosoever commits sin is the servant of
sin. As you shall think or meditate upon the same, let me request you to take
this addition or Supplement into consideration with it; Whosoever is the
Servant of Sin, is the Servant, the Slave, or Bondsman of Satan.
Let no man therefore flatter himself with this or the like Conceit; That
because he professes Christ to be his Lord, he cannot therefore be so true a
Slave and Bondsman unto Satan, as the Idolatrous Heathen were, which offered
sacrifice unto him. They did indeed unwittingly, implicitly, and really
acknowledge him to be their Lord, and themselves his Servants, by paying Rent
or Tribute unto him. But such as deny all such Rent or Service, may make him
their Lord, Vid. Salvianum 1-6.
and themselves his slaves or Bondmen, by Prescription or continual possession.

4. The Heathens which offered sacrifice unto Bacchus, as to a supposed god of
riot or Good Fellowship, or a Patron of Boon Companions, did indeed offer
sacrifice and do solemn service unto Satan and his Angels, the Authors, the
Favorers and Furtherers of all riot and excess. Now if any that calls himself
a Christian, or is a Christian by Calling or profession, have been as long
accustomed to the like riot or excess, or take as great delight in this Sin,
as they did, which offered sacrifice unto Bacchus: he is as true and proper a
Servant unto Satan, as they were. For Satan did desire the sacrifice or other
Service but as an Homage, Rent, or Tribute, whereby he hoped to gain the
possesion of their Souls, or a right or interest in their actions or
employments, a power of disposing or commanding their affections, which offered
him sacrifice or paid him tribute. Now if he have gotten the like interest in
their actions or employments, or the like command over their affections, which
profess themselves to be Christians; they are his by possession or occupation:
He needs no Sacrifice or solemn Tribute from them, which, as we Say, He holds
in his own hands. Briefly*
The Heathens which offered sacrifice unto Bacchus, unless by this custom
they brought themselves to be in Servitude unto the sin of drunkenness, were
not more grievous sinners, nor greater Bondmen unto Satan, then Christians are,
which are in greater Servitude unto this loathsome Sin.

5. Such of the Heathens as worshipped Venus as a supposed Goddess, or
Pattonesse of Love and wantonness, did indeed and in the issue Worship Satan
and his unclean Spirits; which are the Authors, the Nourishers and Maintainers
of all bodily filthiness and uncleanness. If any which professes himself to
be a Christian, be as much given over unto wantonness and uncleanness as the
Heathens were, which Worshipped Venus: He is as true and absolute a Slave to
Satan as they were, and shall be sure to have his wages (without repentance) as
truly and fully paid him, as the other shall. The least and best wages which he
pays for the use of their actions or employments during this short and
brittle life, is an endless and never-dying death.

6. Such of the Heathens as offered sacrifice unto Pluto whom they supposed to
be the God of Riches or of wealth, Lord Paramount of Gold, of Silver, of all
kind of Metals, or whatsoever else was contained under the surface of the
Earth, did indeed Worship Satan and his infernal powers. And the sacrifice
which they offered, and other Solemn services which they did unto him, shall be
as evidences against them, at the Last day, that were his Servants, as a pledge
or earnest to bind them to accept his wages. If any Christians, how Precise or
Devout soever they seem to be, though daily Frequenters of Public Prayers,
though diligent Hearers of Sermons, be as Covetous, as great Oppressors of
their poor Brethren, as unconscionable in their gettings, as unsatiable in
their desires of gain, as the Heathens were, which thought to purchase Wealth
by sacrificing unto Pluto; the bond of their Servitude unto Satan is altogether
as firm and strong; their Servitude or bondage it self altogether as hard, as
great and dangerous, as the Servitude or Bondage of the Heathens were. And
whilst they are in Servitude unto Satan, whatsoever they Profess or make show
of, they cannot be the Servants of God or Christ. For no man (as our Savior
tells us, Mat. 6. 24.) can serve two Masters, for either he will hate the one
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye
cannot serve God and Mammon. But what does he mean by Mammon? wealth, or riches
only? Certainly a part of his meaning is, That every covetous man; that every
one which is extraordinarily careful for gathering things of this Life; Every
one that minds most his gain or getting of riches, is a Servant to his riches,
or to his desires of them. The other part of his meaning is that He which is a
Servant to his desire of riches, is a Servant likewise unto him, whom the
Heathens called Mammon, and worshipped as a supposed God of riches: For Mammon
in the Syriack Tongue is as much as (...) in the Greek. Albeit we Christians
know and believe, that there is no such God or Lord of wealth, and that there
is but One God and One Lord, who is the Lord and owner as well of the Earth and
things in it, as of the Heavens: Yet have we no reason but to think, that the
Infernal Spirits have their several Wards or Quarters. Some of them have better
skill or more experience in humouring Covetous and Worldly minded men; Others
in humouring or enticing Wantons; Others have more skill and experience in
alluring men unto drunkenness; Et quam unusquisque, novit artem, in ea se
maxim exercet: They quarter themselves according their several skils or
experience, into several Regiments Some keep watch and ward over Covetous men,
and present unto them all opportunities of making unlawful gain, or of
overreaching their Brethren in bargaining. The chief of this ward or Regiment,
or perhaps the whole Regiment it self, is called Mammon. Other lie Leigers
about such as are more prone to Wantonness. Their chief care or employment is
to present them with all opportunities or allurements unto Pleasure. Other lie
as Agents in Taverns or Tippling houses: And their care and employment is, to
provoke men to Excess, and to such other Enormities or breach of Gods
Commandments, as accompany excess of drinking.

7. Now this me thinks should be a Great Motive to deter or dehort any man,
from yielding Obedience to his own Desire of what transitory Good or Pleasure
soever, if he would but consider, That, in yielding Obedience to his own
desires, he becomes the servant of some sin or other; and that in becoming the
Servant of any sin whatsoever, he becomes the Bondsman or slave of Satan: who
has one bad property which no other Master, how cruel or devilish soever,
besides himself, has: and That is, To Plague or torment them most, which have
done him most continual and faithful Service. And yet even this Diabolical
Disposition of his, becomes the faithful Executioner of Gods Justice. For,
every degree of their service done to Satan, does include in it a like degree
or portion of Treason or Infidelity toward Christ. And it is Just and holy on
Gods part, though Satanical and Devilish on Satan's, to recompense such, as have
done Satan in this World greatest service, with the greatest portion or measure
of vengeance in the world to come. All of us have some one or other of this
Infernal Crew daily attending on us, hourly watching or dogging us in all our
designs or projects throughout cur whole Course of life.

CHAP. XXI.
Of the manner How Satan brings men to be his Slaves.
1. Plato.
IT was truly said by One, had his meaning been as truly taken, Nemo sponte
malus; No man is wittingly a naughty Man, at least, no man desires to be such.
For whether Original corruption be wholly derived from Adam, or whether we draw
it in part from our immediate Parents, No man (I am persuaded) was never by
Nature or by corruption merely Original, Nemo sponte malus, How far true.
of disposition so wicked and ungracious, as that he did or could directly
desire, intend, or affect to be unnatural or disobedient to his natural
Parents; to be contumacious or rebellious toward Magistrates or other
superiors, whom the Law of God commands him to obey and honor. Corruption
merely Original impels no man's Reasonable Will to desire or affect to be an
Adulterer, a Drunkard, a Murderer, or an Intemperate person; It impels no man
to desire or affect to be a Thief; to be a perjured infamous or envious person,
or to be a notorious offender, or criminous Transgressor of the second Table,
or of Laws agreeable to it. There is no man but is naturally (I mean by the
bent or inclination of corrupt Nature it self) more unwilling to be tainted
either with these mentioned, or with any other like crimes, forbidden by the
six last Commandments, then he that is Freeborn, is, to be subject to the
Legal Estate or condition of a Servant. And yet the most of men in the issue,
or in some part of their course of life, become subject to some one or other of
these Crimes mentioned. The most part of men have their wits and affections
usually and customarily employed in some one or other part of Satan's Service,
in some businesses, which in the end brings them to be such men as they do no
way desire to be, that is, either unnatural, disobedient, cruel, intemperate,
fellonious, perjured, or envious persons; men in whose Souls Satan has
purchased a greater Interest, over whose desires and affections, foul and
unclean spirits have gotten a greater Command, then earthly Lords or Masters
have over the bodies, or bodily Labor of their Servants; a Power or Command to
make them forbear those things which their minds and Consciences do most
approve; a Power to impel them unto those courses which they sometimes most
abhorred; and over some, a Power to change or invert their Wills or desires,
even to make them willing to continue and increase their Native slavery and
misery.

2. The means and manner by which Satan gets this Power and Sovereignty over
men's Souls, are the very same with the means and manner by which bodily and
earthly Lords or Masters gain a Title or Interest in the bodily labors or
employments of such as by this interest once gotten, become their Servants. No
man is naturally willing, or desirous to be another man's servant; All men
rather desire to be Free. Yet inasmuch as all men naturally desire the
continuance of bodily life and health, and neither life nor health can be
maintained or continued without food and raiment, and other necessaries: Hence
it is, that the more inbred and deeplier rooted desire of life and health, does
oversway the natural desire of Liberty and Freedom in all such as are not
provided of things necessary for the maintenance of this life, not able to
satisfy their natural desire of meat, drink, or apparel otherwise, then by
resigning or making over their bodily employments or labors to some other men's
use, which in lieu of these will satisfy their former natural desires of food
and raiment, and afford them means necessary to hold Soul and body together.

3. The Original Temptation by which men are drawn to Satan's slavery.
The Original or Fundamental Temptation by which Satan draws men into this
snare of Servitude or bondage spiritual, is by enlarging or improving their
desires, not of things simply evil, but of things either natural, or
indifferent; that is, for their kind or quality not unlawful. These desires
being improved unto the Full, or unto some Excessive Measure, do by long
custom or continuance, require satisfaction by as strong a Law of See Chap.
18. last
Necessity (at least as importunately) as our natural desires of food or
raiment do. The more excessive or exorbitant any desire is, the more impatient
it is of repulse. It is as impossible for a greedy or Ravenous Appetite to be
satisfied with a spare or moderate Diet, as for a moderate appetite to be
satisfied without any food at all. A vain Fantastic, that takes proud Clothes
to be Part of Himself, is as desirous of change of suits or costly apparel, as
a poor man is of apparel it self, or of such stuff as is sufficient to keep out
cold and wet. An Ambitious Spirit is not so well content with an Ordinary place
or rank amongst Freemen, as an ingenuous mind will be with the estate or
condition of an hired Servant; if no better by means fair and honest be likely
to befall him. A Man apt to over-prize himself, and Jealous withal of
Contempt, of wrong, or of gross abuse, is not so easily appeased with streams
of blood, as a calm and gentle spirit is with an ingenuous acknowledgement of
wrongs done, or with a courteous answer for wrongs suspected. The desire of
wealth or worldly goods, after it has once exceeded its lawful bounds, becomes
as unsatisfiable as Esaias 5. 8. Hab. 2. 5.
Hor. Epist. 6. l. 1.
Mill talenta rotundentur, totidem altera porro;
Tertia Succedant, and quae pars quadret acervum.
Persius Sat. 6. Fine.
Vende animam Lucro, mercare, atque excute Sollers
Omne latus mundi. --
Rem duplica; Feci. Jam triplex, jam mihi quarto
Jam decies redit in rugam. Depunge ubi sistam.
See Juvenal. Sat. 14. v. 110, etc. 326, etc.
Sum duos Equites, fac tertia quadringenta:
Si nondum implevi gremium, si panditur ultra:
Nec Craesi fortuna unquam, nec Persica regna
Sufficient animo, nec divitiae Narcissi.

Hell. It enlarges it self by often satisfaction, and of all earthly and
mortal things, it knows no stint or period of grouth, but grows strong and
lusty by waxing old.

4. None of these desires of meat, of drink, of apparel, of satisfaction for
wrongs done or suspected, of honor, riches, or preferment, are in themselves
or for their quality unlawful. Their Unlawfulness consists only in their
Excess. But even the best of these or like desires, being improved beyond its
measure, will for its private satisfaction, betray the Soul which gives it
harbor, into Satan's hands. He does not, He need not tempt any man directly
to be a Thief, a Robber, or a Murderer. For (as S. James tells us Chap. 1.
14.) Every man is tempted (to these and the like crimes) by his own
Concupiscence, And our Concupiscences and sensual desires are always
increased by custom. He that has long inured himself to exceed either in
quality of meat or drink, or to fare deliciously, desires only to satisfy his
appetite, or to observe his delightful Custom: So these may be satisfied, he
has no desire to be a Thief, to be a Cheater, or Couzener. But rather then his
untemperate appetite should be unsatisfied, He will take himself to some other
part of Satan's Service; and adventure on Theft or Murder, or any other breach
of Gods Commandments.

5. Satan in his first Onsets tempts no man to be an Extortioner, a griping
usurer, or a Tormenter of men in their estates, by the Engine of money. The
first advantage which in this part of his Service he gets over men's Souls, is
from occasions given by men themselves. It is a point of wisdom whereunto
Solomon by the example of the Ant (others by the example of the Be) advises
us, to lay up in Summer against Winter; to be well provided in youth against
Old age. The forecast it self is not amiss; It is no transgression of our
Saviors precept, Be not careful for to morrow: Yet is the Practice dangerous,
unless it be guarded with a watchful Care, That this provision, whether of
money or other external means necessary for the support of life, do not
be-speak our souls For Themselves, or divert our desires from the End, for
which at the first we only did and still ought to desire them. Why money has
the greatest command over most men's desires.
The Fundamental and most transcendent Fallacy, by which men suffer themselves
to be deceived, is by suffering those things which by the Law of nature or Gods
ordinance are appointed only as Means useful for attaining some better End, to
intercept our desires of the End which is Good in it self* and to be desired
For it self, and the Means only to be desired for It. And our desires being
once intercepted or diverted from the End unto the Means; the Means likewise
take up our Principal Care and chief employments. As for Example; Food and
raiment are by God ordained as Means useful for preserving this mortal life,
but as things not Absolutely good* nor to be desired For themselves: For in
that better life we shall have no need, no use or desire of them. Yet in this
life we see many so far transported with the desire of them, as if life had
been given them only to eat and drink, or to wear gay apparel; as if they had
not received these blessings of God, to the end that life and health might be
preserved by them. This Diversion of men's desires from the right End (from the
Comfort of life* and old Age) unto the ordinary Means thereunto destinated, is
more easily wrought by Money and Coin, then by any other external Means
whatsoever. The Reason is plain, because Money by Custom and Consent of Nations
is made as the Her. Sermon. Lib. 2. Sat. 3.

in a sort, it contains all others in it. He that has store of it, may have
store of any other ordinary commodities he pleases. And for the same reason,
That old Saying is most peculiarly true of Money, Juvenal. Sat. 14. v. 141.

-- Ergo paratur

Altera villa tibi, cum rus non sufficit unum.

Et proferre libet fines, majorque videtur Et melior vicina feges, mercaris and
hanc, and Arbusta, and montem.

Hor. Sermon. l. 2. Sat. 6.

-- O si angulus ille

Proximus accedat, qui nunc denormat agellum.

O si urnam argenti Fors qua mihi monstret --.


Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit, The love of money still
increases as the money increases Now after the love of it be grown so
excessive, that men begin to desire it For it self, it brings a necessity upon
them of desiring it. So that this is laid as a Principle or Maxim of Law,
Facias Rem; Their Stock of money MUST be increased: And this is the Hypothesis
or supposition, Rect^ si possis: If by fair means it may be increased, it is
well; Hor. Epist 1. Lib. 1.

Juvenal. Sat. 14. v. 178.

Et cito vult fieri: Sed quae reverentia Legum?

Quis metus aut pudor est unquam properantis avari?

6. Though all the Faculties of the Humane Soul, are by Adams Fall become like
an Instrument out of Tune: Yet are no man's affections so ill set by Corrupt
Nature; no man's desires so far misplaced, but that he can wish every man's Good
word rather then his Ill word; and had rather to be a Benefactor then an
Oppressor, specially if he be of a disposition free and bountiful. Yet if Satan
can once impell or allure men thus disposed, to overlash in Bounty, or stretch
their desires of getting Praise by doing good to others beyond their means or
abilities: he gets a Command over their dispositions or affections, and can
enforce them to do him service in that kind which by nature they most abhor.
For, wastefulnesse or Creverunt and opes, and opum Furiosa Cupido:

Et cum possideant plurima, plura petunt.

Quaerere ut absumant, absumpta requirere Certant.

Atque ipsae vi^iis sunt alimenta vices.

Ovid. Fastor. l. 1.


Prodigality is the mother of Avarice, of Violence, and oppression. Even Vanity
and superfluity, (Things without substance, and such as can yield no nutriment
to any thing else; no profit to such as nourish them) being once confirmed by
Custom, will require Satisfaction with as great eagerness and extremity, as
any other desires, whether natural or acquired. And this is the Misery of
miseries, the very Dregs
of slavery, when a man which in his first Practice and Course of Life intended
Bounty and Liberality, shall be enforced to suck the blood of the Poor and
Needy, for satisfying vanity, or feeding others in their superfluity. How many
thousands of poor souls throughout this Kingdom in our days, have scarce had
flesh left to cover their Bones, for maintaining the outside of Others pride?
for garnishing the Surface of undecent Braverie?

7. Ambitious desires draw men into the worst slavery.
But no kind of Creature in the issue, or through their whole course of life,
is farther transported from its intended End, then the Ambitious or aspiring
mind. The Port which this Bravado is bound for, at His first setting forth, is,
Superiority, Rule, or Dominion over others, perhaps his Equals by Birth, and
for good qualities his far Betters. But ere he can attain to this Heaven of
Happiness, as he esteems it, He must See Horace 6 Epist lib. 1. Si Fortunatum,
etc.
couch down like Issachar, between two burdens, and take Chams Curse upon him
for his Viaticum or Loading in his way or journey. He must be a Servant to
Greatness, though in despite of Goodness, a Vassal to the dispensers of that
Honor which he seeks; (though these be Vassals to Baseness or other bad
Qualities;) a Slave unto the Corruption of Time, and in a preposterous
imitation of our Apostle, he must become all things to all men, and even
enforce himself (against the bent of proud affections) to fawn upon such as can
feed him with hopes of Honor, to lenifie the rotten sores of their Vlcerous
consciences with a smooth and flattering tongue. If he be a Clergyman or
Messenger of Christ that
is tainted with this Humor: he must become more then a Balaam to every Balak;
such a One as Balaam would have been, if the Angel had not withstood him: He
must set himself to bless where God has cursed, and to curse where God has
blessed. There is no part of this Servitude of Sin or Satan so irksome as
this, to an Ingenuous spirit, or to a mind fraught with any internal worth, but
especially with the knowledge of Christ and Him Crucified: No Slavery of the
Soul so odious to God; none that includes greater Enmity or Antipathy to the
Wisdom and Son of God; none that includes greater affinity with Satan. This
unquenchable desire of Honor falsely so called (as some Philosophers from due
examination have determined the question) commands all other Affections
whatsoever, even Love it self, whether toward Parents toward Wife or
Children, Kindred, or Country. And by this Affection of Ambitious Pride, Satan
has often commanded the Greatest Commanders, in more vile and detestable
Services, then he can impose upon the most vile and most abject Creatures
living. Unto this Idol, or to so small a piece of it, as may be inshrined in
some One great Man's Breast, whole L^gions, whole Armies of men for whom Christ
shed his Dearest Blood, have often been Sacrificed; For whose Burnt-offering,
Goodly Towns and Cities have been set on fire. What absolute command Satan gets
over men's Souls* in which Ambitious desires come to their full height and
growth, may easily be calculated from those detestable Services, into which
Satan (by so little a sprig of this Forbidden Tree, as many Christians would
not suspect to bear any forbidden fruit) did impell Pontius Pilate. This Man
thought in his Conscience that our Savior was Innocent; that he was more then
a man, and was exceedingly willing to have saved him from death: And yet Satan
works him, not to do as Pilate himself would, but as Satan would have him to
do. Pilate, says the Evangelist, sought to release him: but the Jews cried out
saying; If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend. For whosoever
makes himself a King, speaks against Caesar. And when Pilate heard that
saying, he proceeds to sentence: And when the Chief Priests further prosecuted
their wonted Form, We have no King but Caesar. He delivered Jesus unto them to
be crucified, John 19. verse. 12, 15, 16. To have corrupted this man by Bribes
or Gifts, to have given wrong sentence against our Savior, had been impossible
for these Jews. Satan himself had not command or interest in his Service by
this Title. The only possession or interest he had in him to this purpose, was
not so much desire of new or greater Honor then he had, as Fear of disgrace or
disrespect with Caesar: if when the Mutinous Jews protested, They had no King
but Caesar, he should suffer a man to live, that was accused, and in some sort
convicted, to have suffered himself to have been Entitled King of the Jews.
Though his Ambition was not great; yet it exposed him to desperate, base, and
detestable Servitude or bondage. It is not half so base or servile to be an
Hangman or other more contemptible Minister or Executioner of public Justice,
as it is to be the Instruments or Ministers of Greatest Caesar's in condemning
the Innocent, or sentencing such to death, as have no ways deserved it. If
Pilate had taken Courage to protect this Just and Holy One against the
malicious calumnies of the Jews; Gods providence no doubt had protected and
shielded Pilates breast from the violence of Pilates own right hand: Whereas he
after having lost Caesar's Favor which he sought by these unjust means to
retain, did out of the apprehension of his discontent or disgrace make away
himself, as the Ecclesiastical Eusebius (English) Book 2. chapter 7.
History tells us. Such are the best rewards that Satan bestows upon his
Servants: though miserable and shameful death be rather the earnest and pledges
only of the wages which he never fully pays to his Servants till after death,
when he has got their Souls into his Custody.

8. If the desire of any Honor; if the Fear of any Disgrace or disrespect with
men, were in themselves or of their own kind Absolutely Good: or were any
Honors to be desired For Themselves; or such, that their Excess could not
draw us into Satan's Servitude or bondage: then certainly desire of being
members of Gods Visible Church, The dangerous Slavery into which the Romish
Church has brought her self.
or fear of being cast out of it as Heretics, were of all Secondary Means or
desires, the most safe. But through desire of yielding Absolute Obedience to
Gods Visible Church, and through immoderate Fear of being by the Church
disgraced or Excommunicated, Satan has twice drawn a great part of Gods
people, Such I mean as profess the knowledge of God and of his anointed
Christ, into a Slavery or bondage more detestable and greater by a Threefold
Measure, then any Slavery or bondage into which he was able to draw the most
wicked and most Idolatrous Heathen, since the first Revolution of time,
affording him opportunity of Temptation. The First notorious or famous Conquest
that Satan got over the visible Church, was in the days of our Saviors
pilgrimage here on Earth; The Second, over the visible Romish Church within
these later years, wherein they have resumed the Title or Prerogative which the
Jewish Church did stiffly challenge, but with lamentable success for some years
after the first and second Destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem. The Title
which that Church did challenge, but with greater moderation then the present
Romish Church does, was the Absolute Infallibility of the Church
representative, that is, of the chief Priests and Elders. Yet this Absolute
Infallibility the Jewish Snagogue did never confine unto the bosom of the High
Priest either sitting in Moses Chair, or when He entered into the Sanctum
Sanctorum, but to the Sanedrim or Common Council of the Priests and Elders,
whereof the high Priest was a more Principal then Necessary Member.

9. The improvement of this Jewish Heresy and Slavery to Satan, throughout the
Patriarchate of Rome, had its Original from an Ambitious Error in that Church
through succession of times not very Ancient, by laying challenges to all Gods
promises made to his Universal or Catholic Church, as to her own Peculiar
Prerogative. And as if this had not been enough: the successors of these
desperate Challengers have contracted the Catholic Church (which in their
Language is all one with the Church of Rome) unto the Pope and his Cardinals,
or as they term it, the Sacred Consistory. Some later Canonists and Parasites
to the Pope, Jesuits especially, have labored to drive the Universal Church
(like a Camel through a needles eye) into the Popes Breast alone, whenever he
shall deliver his Sentence ex Cathedra; as if, as well all Gods Promises as
Blessings promised to his Catholic Church were, The One to be disposed of, The
Other to be dispensed by him, as by Christ's sole Vicar General or Viceroy here
on Earth. But these Positions, some Interimists or Laborers for Reconciliation
betwixt the Church of Rome and of England, will hapily reply, are but the
Opinions of private men, not maintained or taught by the Catholic Church Yet
none of them, whether Cardinals, Jesuits, or Casuists; whether Priests, or
Laics of inferior rank will or dare deny, that the Infallible Guidance of
the Holy Ghost for Leading Christ's Church into the truth, is immediately
annexed to the Roman Church Representative, that is, to all such Councils or
Assemblies of Christian men as are called by the Pope as Christ's Viceroy, and
approved of by him and his Assistants. The Necessary Consequence of this
Position is. That, No one Council which has been called by the Pope and
approved by him did ever heretofore Err, or can Err hereafter.

10. The former mis-interpretation of Gods Promises made unto the Universal
Church, He means W. Laud The R R. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Book.
(that is, as Romanists say, unto the Church of Rome) is excellently refuted by
the Author of that Matchless Piece heretofore annexed to Doctor Whites Learned
Answer to the Jesuit Fisher, since Published by The Author of it, in his own
Name, with many Learned and Pious additions: Of all which I have no more for
the present to say, then this. Respondent Vltima primis. Both the First and
Second Edition are worthy their Author. And this is more then I know otherwise
how to express. The first Edition I had the happiness to peruse when I had
finished this Treatise of Servitude to sin, for my private use, and for the
benefit of such as were committed to my Pastoral Charge, and had entered upon
another Treatise Concerning Christian Obedience, for preventing the spreading
infection of a Pestilent Book dispersed through the Northern parts of this
Kingdom, set forth by a Jesuit under this Saucy Title, The Prelate and the
Prince. And for preparing the Antidote, I found good Directions and Ingredients
from the forementioned Author.

11. But suppose the rest of the Church be disposed to Believe this Doctrine of
the Popes Infallibility. Wherein does the matchless Slavery of the Romish
Church unto Satan in respect of Jews or Heathens punctually consist? In This
especially, That if any Council, Wherein the Bishop of Rome or Patriarch of the
West (as his Style sometimes was) had any principal Interest or Prerogative
either in calling or confirming it, have Erred: the present Pope and his
Adherents, whether Priests, or Laics, are Bound by solemn Oath, and under a
dreadful Curse, to make up the Measure of their Forefathers Errors,
Negligences, Ignorances or other enormous sins and iniquities, whether
committed against the Rule of Faith, or against the Law of God. For all which
they are also Bound by their own Doctrine and Liturgy to beg Pardon; as well
for their Forefathers Transgressions as for their own, in respect of what is
past; and to pray for the prevention of the like, in times to come. Now this is
the Greatest Yoke of Slavery that Satan durst or could attempt to Lay upon the
neck of Christ's Church Militant here on Earth; albeit he could by subtilty
prevail to place his Primogenitus, (that is, such an Antichrist as many in the
Romish Church conjecture shall hereafter come) that is, a Man begotten by the
Devil of a Woman or Daughter of the Tribe of Dan) as Christ's Vicar General in
S. Peter's Chair. If any such Antichrist shall hereafter arise: the Measure of
Personal Iniquity may be greater then any Popes* or the Papacy hitherto has
been: but the Kind must be the same. A worse or more desperate kind of iniquity
or Antichristianism then this late mentioned, cannot be imagined. The End of
Chap. 21.

IT was the Authors Fashion, mostly, to preach upon such Texts as might ground
the matter that he intended after to Treat upon in his writings; and so to
weave his Sermons into the Body of his Discourses or Tracts, as occasion
required. The Studious Reader knowing This, and observing, 1. A passage at the
Beginning of the Second Section (page 3018. the seventh Chapter of This Book)
which promises To annex to these Discussions [A Sermon, About That Sort of Jews
which made that Saucy Reply to Christ (verse 33. John 8.) whether they were
Such as (verse 30.) were said to Believe on Him, or No.] And then, 2. Taking
notice of the Title of the 14. Chapter (it begins the third Section, page
3039.) which is [That even those Jews which did in part Believe in Christ, were
true Servants unto Sin] He will see the Reasons that procured the Insert on of
these two Sermons or Tracts ensuing, here, at This Place. As being conceived
most nearly allied to the matter preceding, and more accomodate to the Readers
Use, who (as is probably presumed) if He had but only been reminded of This in
the Margin, before he had proceeded to read the fourth Section, would first
have sought out and read these two Discourses, in Case they had been deferred
and placed in the Rear of this Book.

CHAP. XXII.
A Postil or short Discourse upon our Saviors words, JOHN 8. 36.
If the Son therefore shall make you Free ye shall be Free Indeed.
The Connection of This verse with The precedent.
1. THis verse is inferred by way of Conclusion from the verse Precedent [The
Servant abides not in the house for ever; But the Son abides for ever.] The
Difficulties emergent be Two; The Former, Concerning the true Sense and
meaning* or at least the Limitation of the Antecedent, to wit, [The Servant
abides not in the house for ever, etc.] The Other, Concerns the Inference or
Connection betwixt This Antecedent and the Conclusion, [If the Son therefore,
etc.]

Some of best note amongst the Ancient or middle rank of Interpreters, The
Opinion of The Ancient Fathers.
as Cyrill, Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Euthymius, are of opinion that our
Savior in these words, [The Servant abides not in the house for ever,] did
intend either to Prevent or Answer the Secret Objection or Reply, which the
Jews did or might have made unto his Former Conclusion, verse. 34. Whosoever
commits Sin, (or whosoever is a worker of sin) is the Servant of Sin. Unto
this Assertion the Jews, (as these good Authors think) might have answered
thus: Admit we daily incur some degree or other of Servitude unto Sin, yet we
have usual and daily means to blot out the stain of sin, and to Free us from
thraldom, and Final Servitude unto sin and Satan. There is no Question but the
Jews did account the Sacrifices, which Moses did institute, fully sufficient
and Effectual for both these Purposes. Yet that they did herein err, that
these sacrifices instituted by Moses could not Free them from this Servitude of
sin, our Savior, (as the forecited Good Authors think) proves from this Reason
Moses was but a Servant in the house of God, and no Servant has power to Free
himself, much less to set others Free from the yoke of Servitude, or to secure
his Estate in his Masters house. Maldonat's Censure of Their Opinion.
But Maldonate the Jesuit thinks that place Heb. 3. ver. 3. 4. 5. and 6. did
deceive these Good Fathers, or at least that they miss-applied Saint Paul's
Comparison betwixt Christ and Moses unto this present Argument. For our
Savior, (says this Learned Jesuit) speaks of another kind of Servitude in
this place, then Saint Paul speaks of in the third to the Hebrews, and of a
Servitude unto which Moses was not Subject. For Moses in the third to the
Hebrews, and else where, is Termed The Man of God, not, a Servant to Sin or
Satan.

2. Not to Question the Solidity or Pertinency of this Jesuits Exceptions
against the Interpretation of the Ancients: I must confess his Opinion is very
Probable, and their Interpretation somewhat far fetched, if not forced; and
supposes That for its Ground, which has not much Probability in it self, to
wit, That these Jews either would confess, or by way of supposition admit,
that they were such Servants to Sin, or Transgressors of the Law, as to become
thereby the Servants or sons of Satan. For they presume in the words following,
that by being the children of Abraham, and by their Observance of Moses Law
they were the Sons of God. He preferrs One Leontius before the Fathers.
This learned Jesuit prefers the Interpretation of Leontius (a man otherwise
of mean Note, in comparison) before the joint interpretation of the forecited
Famous Fathers. Our Savior* (says Leontius) intended only to Prove what is
Inferred here in this 36. verse; That none besides The Son can have power to
set men Free, because The Son only remains in the house for ever. Unto this
Interpretation Maldonate adds his own, that every Servant had need to be set
Free by Authority, because no Servant has any Right or Title to continue for
ever in the house wherein he lives, or to be the owner or possessor of any
other, it being still in his Masters Power either to sell him, or to turn him
ont of his house, or to dispose of him at his Pleasure. If some Servant
continue in his Masters house for ever or to his dying day, yet this false out
seldom or by chance: whereas our Savior frames his Argument from that, which
usually happens or for the most part. All agree that by The House in this
place, the Church of God is principally meant, in which the Son of God remains
for ever, in which no Servant unless he become a Son, can remain but for a
short time. For though sinners and Servants to Sin may remain in the true
visible and Militant Church during this life, so mingled with the sons of God,
as they cannot, by men, be discerned from them, yet after death (as St. Cyrill
says) they are cast out into utter darkness, unless during this life, they be
set Free from the Servitude of sin, from which none but the Son of God can Free
them, because He only is the Heir and Lord of Gods House; He only has power to
grant or deny Freedom unto what Servants he pleases.

3. The Words relate unto the Story of Agar and Ishmael.
This is the Sum of that Connection, which the best Interpreters Ancient or
Modern make of the former verse, and of these words of my Text. Unto this I may
add. That These, as most other Speeches of our Savior, have Reference unto
some Historical Relation or matter of Fact contained in the Old Testament. And
that This speech or passage has Special Reference unto the Story of Agar and
Ishmael. And so the Antecedent [The servant abides not in the house for ever]
though grounded but upon One Particular Instance; yet that Instance or Example,
being related in the Sacred Story as a Type or Picture of what was to come,
will infer our Saviors intended Conclusion much bettter and more forcibly,
then a full Induction of other Instances and Examples not related in Scripture,
not framed nor intended by the spirit of God for Types and shadows of things
which were to come. This Universal Negative [No servant abides in the house
for ever] will not so forcibly infer this Particular Conclusion [Ergo, No
Servant of sin can abide in Gods house for ever] as this Particular Instance
[Ishmael did not abide in Abraham's house for ever] Inferrs. This Conclusion,
[Therefore the Jews, which thus contested with our Savior, were not to abide
in the house of God for ever.] So that, if it be lawful to Paraphrase upon our
Saviors words, their Full Meaning is, as if he had said thus. Do you think
your selves Free from the servitude and wages of sin, The Sense of The Text.
because ye are the seed of Abraham? So was Ishmael, whom Abraham once
intended for his Heir, who lived a long time in Abraham's house, but, being the
Son of a Bondwoman, he was by Legal Condition but a Servant, and therefore not
to live in it for ever, but to be cast out by Gods appointment as it is written
Genesis 21. 10. Cast out this Bond woman and her Son, for the Son of this
Bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. These were the words
of Sarah, for a while, displeasing unto Abraham, until God did ratify them by
Interposition of his Authority: And thus is your Case.

4. For albeit these Jews, with whom our Savior here Disputes, were the sons
of Abraham by Sarah, (and so The Progeny of Isaac:) yet so long as they mocked
and persecuted the true seed of Abraham, whose coming into the world Isaac did
prefigure, cleaving unto the Testament given upon Mount Sinai (or Agar) in
Opposition to the Testament given upon Mount Sion, they became sons of the
Bondwoman, (as the Apostle infers, Gal. 4. 24. to the end of the chapter)
subject to the same Conditions in matters Spiritual, that Ismael was subject to
in matters Temporal. The exposition of that Allegory, Gal. 4. 24. you have
heard See Book 7. Sect. 2. chap. 12. ^ 2.
before at large. The Apostles Conclusion is the very same with our Saviors
here in my Text, to wit, that This People were to be cast out of the House of
God, And Treatise of the Catholic Church.
as Ishmael was cast out of Abraham's house. That whilst they remained in it,
they remained only as Servants or sons of the Bondwoman, Book 1. chapter 10. more
largely.
not as the Freeborn sons of the heavenly Jerusalem. Of which Society none are
capable, save only so far as they are Set Free by the Son, who is the Builder
and maker of this House of God, as the Apostle tells us, Heb. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6. For
this man was counted worthy of more Glory then Moses, in as much as he, who
has builded the house, has more honor then the house. For every house is
builded by some man, but he that built all things is God. And Moses verily was
faithful in all his house as a Servant for a Testimony of those things, which
were to be spoken after. But Christ as a Son over his own house, whose House
are we, if we hold fast the Confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto
the end. But the best is, we need not stand long or Curiously upon the meaning
of the Antecedent, or manner of the Inference, seeing we believe (as we are in
duty bound) that our blessed Savior was a Prophet most True and most
Infallible, as well in every Conclusion or Proposition, which he uttered, as in
the Premises, whence he Inferred them, or in the manner of the Inference. It
shall suffice us then to fasten our Belief upon the Conclusion, If the Son
therefore shall set you Free, Then shall ye be Free indeed.

CHAP. XXIII.
The Second Discourse, or Sermon upon our Saviors words.
S. JOHN 8. 36. If the Son therefore shall make you Free, ye shall be Free
indeed.

That, That sour Reply to Christ [We be Abraham's Seed, etc.] was made by those
very Jews which are said (verse 30) to Believe on Him. And That men which for a
while Believe, may in Temptation (or strong assaults of passions) Fall away.


1. The Coherence.
THese words contain One of the Most Remarkable Passages, and of best use for
Surveying the rest of that long Dialogue between our Blessed Lord, and a great
Assembly of the Jews of diverse sorts and Qualities. The Dialogue continues from
the 12th verse of this Chapter unto the End. The former Part from verse the
12th to the 30th contains so many and so Profound my steries concerning the
Eternity of Christ's Godhead and of his mission, etc. from his Father to this
people; That for the present I must apply that Saying which the woman of
Samaria directed to our Savior, unto my self. The well is deep, and I have
nothing wherewith to draw, neither strength of Body, of mind, or skill; nor
opportunity, if these were greater, to present so much of it as I could perhaps
draw for mine own use, clear and perspicuous to the major part of this Audience
in a short discourse. Let it suffice then I pray, to acquaint you with the
Vent, or Out-burst of this deep Fountain of Life, which none of these Jews
could Sound the one half of the Way, though all Catechized by the Lord of Life
himself. The Issue of this Catechism from verse the 12th you have verse 30th.
As he spoke these words many believed on him. A good Issue of so Gracious a
Sermon, concerning the Fountain of Life; had his Auditors had the Grace to have
followed the clear Current of it, not mingling it with their own muddy Passions
as in the very first Issue or Out-burst they did. For our Savior had no sooner
uttered those words of comfort to the Jews which Believed on him: If ye
continue in my word then are ye my Disciples Indeed: and ye shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you Free, verse 30. and 32. But some of his
Auditors (whoever they were) Tartly Reply, We be Abraham's seed and were never
in Bondage to any man: how say Thou, ye shall be made Free? verse 33. Unto
this passionate Reply or impertinent Interruption, our Saviors Rejoinder is
Calm and meek, but fortified with a double seal of Truth, (...), Verily,
verily, I say unto you, whosoever commits sin is the Servant of sin; and the
servant abides not in the house for ever, but the son abides ever, verse 34,
35. Thus by following the Current of the former words I am fairly arrived at my
Text: (it being our Saviors own Inference out of his former Assertions.) If
the son therefore make you free, etc.

2. Which sort of Jews made: that Passionate Reply to Christ: Believers or
others.
But before I can conveniently unfold the meaning of our Saviors former
speeches, or the Connection betwixt my Text and Them, I must briefly discuss a
Question naturally emergent out of the 33. verse, to wit, whether The
Passionate Reply or interruption [We be Abraham's seed and were never yet in
bondage unto any, etc.] was made by those Jews which (in the 30th verse) are
said to have Believed on Him, or by some other Auditors which did not Believe
on him at all, but were at least for the time being mere Bystanders at this
debate? Some Interpreters say Unbelievers.
Some of the choicest Commentators upon this Gospel, are of Opinion, that the
forementioned sour Reply [We be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to
any man] was returned by the Jews which for the present did not Believe. More
for Believers.
Yet the greater part of more judicious and discreet Interpreters of our
Saviors discourse in this Chapter, or of S. John's Relation of it, take it as
granted, That the Reply was made by those very Jews which (verse 30.) Believed
on him. And unto any Rational man, specially, well conversant in Scriptures (or
well experienced in his own or other men's Affections) it will upon short
Examination appear, that the Contradictory Opinion of Cardinal Tollet and some
others could never have found Entrance, much less any settled habitation or
rest in any Learned Man's Judgment or Apprehension unless they had been first
surprised by that General Incogitancy or common Error from which many plausible
Pulpit-men, and some otherwise most acute Divines have taken occasion; The One
sort to deceive their Hearers, The Other not to discover the deceitfulness of
their own hearts. Neither of them take it into due consideration, that, This
Word, Belief, is not a Term Indivisible, but admits of many Degrees as well for
the Certainty of the This Great Author in his First Book, 1 Chapter Defined Faith
by an Assent. If any think amiss of that, let him please to take notice that
S. Austin did so too. ^psum credere nihil aliud est quam cum Assensione

Assent or Apprehension, as for the Radication of the Truth (rightly
apprehended) in their Hearts or Center of their affections.

3. Though recta Ratio be not the Rule of Faith nor any Competent Judge of
Divine Mysteries; yet it is a very Competent Witness or Informer. Now to any
Reasonable or well Experienced Man, it is Evident; That there may be and
oft-times are many true Apprehensions of Objects or Truths to be Believed
whether Moral or Divine, which may make deep Impression not in the Brain or
Fancy only, but upon our Was it not so with S. Peter, when He said, he would
Die rather then Deny Chri?. and in those who would have made Christ a King,

Apprehension and Impression quickly vanish upon the Starting or Provocation of
Contrary Fancies or Affections. To begin with Observations moral. He that

principal Actor, might easily have mistaken him him to have been of the same
metal and mould that ordinarily Good men are; a man rather of a Gentle and
melting, then of a Flinty and stony heart; whereas his Apology or Excuse did
abundantly witness the Contrary. His Apology was, that he did not depart
because he misliked the Actor, whom by a private messenger he requested to go
on with his Play; but for shame or fear if he should be espied to shed Tears
upon the Stage at the sight of a Foreign Tragedy, he should move new
Discontents or derision from his Subjects, seeing he had spilt most of the
Noble Blood of Thessalie with Dry Cheeks, without mingling so much as one Tear
with it. What might be the reason why this man should be so Courteous or
tenderhearted in Jest, and so cruel and doggedly-hard-hearted in earnest?
Hecuba and Andromache, (whose Tragedy he did then behold) had been dead many
years before, and could not provoke his Affections. That Prosperity wherein
they sometimes had lived, could not have been so great an Eyesore unto him as
the Representation of their last misery was: whereas if Priamus, Hector, with
all their Families had been then living and standing in opposition to his heady
wilful Designs; The Tyrant would have made no scruple of Conscience to have
sacrificed them all quick to his ravenous and vast desires, though in the
Flames of Troy it self, without the help of one tear from his eyes to quench
them.

4. A notable instance of the like Alteration of present Affections or
inconstancy in forward Resolutions upon new Proposals, Instances, of S^range
Altering of Affections.
we have in that Famous Mutiny of the Commons against the Senate of Capua. The
storm was violent for the time, but quickly allayed by the subtilty of one
Pacuvius Calavius, a man of good place, and popular: who having long sought to
win both the Senate and People to his Disposal, took first Opportunity upon
this Occasion to make his Game by playing (as we say) both with the Stock and
Cardes-dealt. First he pretends to the Senators, that he was in as great danger
as any of them were; and yet would free them all, so they would give him leave
to act his Part. Having persuaded the Senators to shut themselves up in the
Porch of their House of Assembly, and deliver their Keys to his Custody, He
instantly carries them to the Commons, telling them they had now a fair
Opportunity to be revenged of the Senate, to punish every man amongst them
according to his deserts without any danger of Bloodshed to themselves: but
adds this Advice withal, that seeing they must of necessity have a Senate or
Council of State, they would not depose or punish any of the present Senators,
before they had nominated a fitter man in his place. After Two or Three had
been proposed by some few Ringleaders, the major part of the Mutineers did
reject them upon this Allegation, that some of them They did not know, others
They knew too well, and so in Conclusion were content to submit themselves to
their Ancient Senators, then to such new Ones as were commended unto them by
their Ringleaders.

5. Machiavels Aphorism or Animadversion upon this Story, is, That the Vulgar
or Common People are of weak Judgments in Generalities, but Judges competent
enough in Particulars. The Observation is not amiss, and so far as it is not
amiss, will better befit the Issue of this Dispute between our Savior and the
Jews, then it does the Senate and Commons of Capua. The Exact Truth is; That
not only Vulgar Persons or Plebeians, but even Wise and Learned men must needs
must err in Judgment or Apprehension, whilst they weigh either their present
Discontents or Grievances, or their Persuasions or Good-Liking of men, or their
Belief of wholesome Doctrine without a Counterpoise. So long as these men in my
Text (of which diverse no doubt were more then vulgar or Plebeians) did hear our
Savior Dispute with the learned Pharisees about the Eternity of his Person and
Authority delegated unto Him as Man from God the Father; They like well of Him,
and could be content to become His Patients rather then their great Rabbis
Scholars. The Jews liked Christ dearly well till he touched their Sore.
But as soon as this heavenly Physician began to come near the Sore whereof
they were dangerously sick, before he did directly touch it, they kick at his
Medicine. Pride of heart and Confidence in their Prerogative of being Abraham's
Seed, was the Impostume whereof without speedy help they were ready to perish.
Now our Savior had no sooner promised to set them Free or Cure them; but they
presently fly in his Face, as if he had upbraided them with Slavery. For to be
made Free is Peculiar to Servants, Slaves, or Bondmen. Hence they Reply to this
Purpose. We be Abraham's seed, and though Conquered by the Romans, yet are we
not made Slaves, or brought into Bondage by them; How say thou then, ye
shall be made Free? The manner of the Regestion seems to imply, that they had
now begun to be sorry that they had so far Believed on him, or given that
Respect unto him which immediately before they had done.

6. But this Revolt our Savior did foresee, and gave them a Caveat to prevent
it, verse 31. where he says not, as some Zealous Professors have in his Name
mistaught their Auditors in our days [If once ye If any say; It is not True
Belief if it fade or fail. They may be Told, That if they put Perseverance
into the Definition of True Faith, they null the Question, and make it, whether
Faith that cannot fail, may fail.
Believe in me, ye cannot fall away from me] But, Thus he taught them Expressly
[If ye continue in My Word then are ye my Disciples '(...).] So that it is One
thing to Believe in Christ; Another, to be Truly his Disciples: One Business
to Believe his Doctrine, Another to Continue in his word, that is, To persevere
in true Faith, and maintenance of his Doctrine unto the End. Nor is it perhaps
all one To be made Free by the Truth, and To be set Free indeed, (...), which
(I take it) includes somewhat more then (...), A Realitie or soliditie of
Truth. All these Gradations are Literally, and Emphatically implied in the
plain Grammatical Sense and meaning of our Saviors Speech from verse 30 to the
words of my Text, and more apparently in the next verse following. I know that
ye are Abraham's seed, but ye seek to kill me, because my word has no place in
you. These words were not directed to the altogether Unbelieving or
Contradicting Jews, with whom he had disputed from verse 12. to the 29. They
necessarily referr unto those Jews which had Believed in Part, and afforded the
Assent of the Brain unto his Doctrine, but left no place for his word in their
Hearts, These being full stuffed with corrupt Affections, as with Pride, Ambition
and Hopes of Earthly Pomps and Dignities from their expected Messiah. When he
says [Because my word has no place in you] We are to understand No place of
Residence or Permanent Habitation; although it had found some Entrance into
their Fancies. Or will ye have a further Reason, why His Word, that is, The
Fundamental Point or Mystery of Faith, which he had lately taught, had No Place
in them? Take it in his own words, I speak That (says our Savior) which I
have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your Father,
verse 38. He had granted them before to be Abraham's seed, but now expresses
his Meaning to be, that they were a kind of Abortivate or ill thriven Seed, no
true Sons or children of Abraham. But as yet they did not fully understand whom
he meant by His Father, or whom by Their Father. And for this Reason they only
resume the same Reply, which they had made before, verse 33 Abraham is our
Father, say They, verse 39. without adding any Gall unto it. But our Saviors
Rejoinder is not altogether the same, but somewhat more smart and full. Before,
he had granted them to be Abraham's Seed, but now, he denies them to be Abraham's
sons, in the later part of the same 39 verse, If ye were Abraham's sons, ye
would do the works of Abraham, But now (verse, 40.) ye seek to kill me, a man
that have told you the truth -- This did not Abraham. And again verse 41. he
intimates unto them, who was their True Father, that was neither God nor
Abraham. Who then was their True Father, or whose children were they indeed?
This he tells them plainly, verse 44. Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the
lusts of your father ye will do: He w^^ a murderer from the beginning, and
abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him; That is, by not
abiding in the Truth, or that Image of God wherein he was created, he lost all
Seeds of Truth, and became a mere Liar and the Father of Lies. And so these
Jews were in the Truth whilst they Believed on Him who was the True Son of
God, yet did not Abide in it, after he had told them, The truth should make
them Free. And out of this swelling Pride of Heart they enter Odious
Comparisons, that they were Sons of God in an equal or better manner then he
was. And in Conclusion, after he had told them, that they were as yet sons of
the Devil, that is, men of murtherous minds and envious to the Truth; they
answer him boldly and glory in their Answer too. Say we not well that thou art
a Samaritan and have a Devil? verse 48. And if a Samaritan, then no Son of God,
but rather a Conjurer or servant of the Devil.

7. Thus you have heard to what height of Contradiction To the Truth, to the
Son of God, (who is The Truth and The Life of the world) and to their own
Profession, Men in Part Believers may be drawn, by Indulgence to their own
Corrupt Affections, specially of Pride, Ambition, and Covetousness; all which
ought to be and must be renounced before they can be (...), True Disciples of
Christ. And here I cannot but wonder why men Conversant in Scriptures, or
Experienced in their own or others Affections and Conditions, should move any
Question, whether those which thus unmannerly contested with our Savior
throughout the later part of this Chapter, were the same men which in the 30th
verse are said, To have Believed on Him. And I wonder the more, because every
serious Reader, much more the Learned Interpreters of this Chapter, might have
observed many like Animadversions or Observations of this our Apostle and
Evangelist concerning the disposition of the Jews, which in Part, or upon fair
Occasions Believed on Christ. I shall for the present Instance only in Two like
places, of which The One is a Parallel, Two Instances of the like or worse
Recoyls and Revolts of the Jews.
the Other more then a Parallel to the Revolt or backsliding of these
Believing Jews, verse 31. The One place is an Overture or Presage; The Other
contains the Fulfilling or Accomplishment of our Saviors Prophecy or
Prediction of those men's Disposition which entertained him with the often
forementioned Dispute, from verse 31. to the end of this Chapter. The Overture
or Parallel we have John 2. verse 23, etc. Now when he was at Jerusalem at the
Passover on the Feast day, many Believed in his Name, when they saw the
Miracles which he did. May we hence Conclude or safely Collect that these men
were '(...), Truly his Disciples, or Believers Indeed, (...): Although it be
unquestionably True (for the Evangelist affirms it) That they did Believe in
his Name? If we should make this Construction of the Evangelists meaning in
That Place, (that is, that Those Men were Truly Disciples, Believers indeed)
his words immediately following would irrefragably Confute us. For although
They did Believe in his Name, yet He did not Believe Them: or to use the
Apostles words, verse 24. (...), That is, as our English renders it, He did not
commit himself unto them. And why would he not commit himself unto their Trust,
seeing They Believed on him? The Evangelist Resolves us in the next words,
Because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man, for he
knew what was in man. And knowing all men, he knew the Disposition of these men
to be such, that although they did for the present Believe in his name; upon
presentation of Discontent, or denial of satisfying their desires, or hopes of
Earthly Dignities, they would revile him as the Believers in my Text did, and
maliciously Contradict his Doctrine; or if Opportunity served, Betray him into
his enemies hands, or at least offer him such violence, as was offered him in
the last verse of this 8th Chapter. Then took they up stones to cast at him;
'(...), that is, He made Himself Invisible to their sight, and went out of the
Temple, going through the midst of them, (...), and so avoided their attempted
Violence, because the hour was not yet come wherein he was willing to suffer
Violence.

8. But this dangerous disease of the Jewish Nation, The Second Instance of
Jewish Revolt from Christ: or rather Turning clean Counter.
or the particular indisposition of such as in the second and eight chapters of
this Gospel are said to Believe in him, did not come to so Perfect A Crisis,
that others besides Christ himself who knew What was in man, could take Notice
of it, until that Passover wherein he was betrayed by Judas. At the beginning
of this Great Feast most of the seed or Progeny of Abraham by Isaac not
Inhabitants of Judaea only, but wheresoever Scattered through other Nations or
Provinces, did Believe in his name after a better manner; and expressed their
Belief and Observance to him in far higher Terms then those men to whom my Text
refers, or those mentioned by S. John Chap. 2. or any other Ordinary Assemblies
had done before. And this they did without Contradiction of any save of the
Scribes and Pharisees, Priests, and Elders. Scarce any King or Emperor whether
Christian or Heathenish, since the world began, was entertained with such lofty
Gratulations from so many mouths and hands at once, as our Savior some three
or four days before he was Betrayed. The Triumphant Salutations which had been
tendered to David by Judah and Israel at his Coronation, were but a Model of the
loud Echoes of Hosanna to the Son of David, Hosanna in the Highest, Blessed be
the Son of David that comes in the name of the Lord, and other Expressions of
this peoples Joy when our Savior (according to the Prophecy) came into
Jerusalem. What was the reason of their Unparalleled Exultation? only Their
Belief of the late Miracles, which he had wrought upon Lazarus and some other
Private Men, and their hopes that he would do Greater Wonders then these for
their Good and for the Glory of their Nation; As First to deliver them from the
present Roman yoke; and afterward to make them Lords of the Nations, through
which they were scattered. But after he had by his Fathers appointment rendered
himself to the High Priest and Elders without a Blow Given (beside that which
Peter gave to Malchus) and submitted himself to the Roman Deputy without
Resistance. They begun to cast doubts in their minds, and thought, that he, who
could not, or would not defend himself from such violence, was not able or
would not be willing to protect, much less to advance them unto Greater
Dignities. And so, by Degrees within a short space the very same Parties of
Exultant Believers in Him, became Cruel Persecutors of Him; Changing their late
joyful Hymns of Hosanna to the Son of David into sad Madrigals of Crucifige,
Crucifige, Let him be crucified, Let him be crucified like a Slave. And thus
the whole Nation almost did remarkably fulfill our Saviors Prediction of these
Jews mentioned, verse 44. of this Chapter, Ye are of your father the Devil, and
the lusts of your father ye will do: He was a murderer from the beginning, and
he abode not in the truth. Hereby we may know them to have been the Devils own
sons, in that when Pilate had proposed unto them, Him, whom they had lately
confessed to be the Son of David, with Barabbas a notable thief and a
murderer, they importunately solicit with open mouth The deliverance of
Barabbas, by Interpretation, the son of their Father, and the Execution of
Jesus their Savior, and changed their late Belief and Allegiance professed to
Christ who is Truth it Self, and son of God, unto the service of the Father of
Lies.

9. The Resultance of that which has been said, (or, if you will, the main
Stem unto which all the forementioned scattered Seeds of Truth afforde
Nutriment) is This; That, Men in part Believers, or to their own apprehension
zealous and sound professors of Christian Faith, may be as yet Servants to sin,
and by such Service Slaves to Satan. The useful Branches springing from this
Stem are These: First; To know the Nature, Condition or Proprieties of our
Natural Lord and Master, to wit, Sin Original, whether Hereditary merely, or as
by us improved. The Second, To know our own Condition or Estate, or wherein our
Servitude to sin does properly consist. Thirdly, The Degrees or Manner how we
are, or may be made Free indeed by the Son of God. But with these Branches I
dare not meddle for the present, the best use which can be made of this short
Remnant of time will be to Reflect by way of Use or Application upon that which
has been said.

10. The Application.
Were this Question proposed to this present or any other Congregation
throughout This This Sermon is supposed to have been preached at Oxford in A
Time of Gods Visitation by the Plague of Pestilence.
City, Punctually in these Terms, [Whether do ye Love God, and his Anointed
Christ with all your hearts and with all your souls?] we should find but a very
few, if any at all, which would not as willingly subscribe unto This, as unto
that solemn Covenant made by them or by others for them to this Effect at their
Baptism. Nor will Christian charity permit us to Suspect, much less to Deny,
that they did make this Recognition heartily and unfainedly according to their
present Apprehensions or Persuasions of their Belief, specially if they made it
in the calm of their unprovoked Affections. But if we should cast in that
Counterpoise, which our Savior himself has given us for the due Examining of
our Apprehensions or Persuasions of our Love and Loyalty toward Him: most of
us might justly dread lest that Handwriting against Belshazzar [Mene, Mean,
Tekel -- ] might as well be Appliable to our selves, as it was to him. Fear we
might lest our Apprehensions or Persuasion of our Belief, of our Love and
Loyalty toward Christ would prove a great deal too Light, if we should weigh
them (as we ought) by the True Scale of the Sanctuary. One Counterpoise there
is which would quickly recall or check our forward Apprehensions or Boastings,
and that is given us by our Savior himself in this Gospel, Chap. 14. verse. 15,
23, 24. If ye love me keep my Commandments. And again, Chap. 15. verse. 10. If
ye keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love. How many may we find who in
distress or danger, whether by Sea or Land, specially in grievous storms or
sickness will seriously purpose and Resume that Branch of their Vow in
Baptism,
To for sake the Devil and all his works, the Lusts of the Flesh, the Pomps and
vanities of this wicked world: And yet the Same Men being restored to health
and probable safety, will, of Late zealous Professors and solemn votaries, turn
Gaderenes or Gergesites, ready upon new Opportunities or Provocations of untame
Desires, to wish Christ to depart out of their Coasts, rather then His
Residence in their Hearts or Brains should give a continual check to their
swinish appetites or Brutish Fancies. And thus to do, is not to keep, but to
violate Christ's Commandments, which whosoever does not keep as well in This
Particular of mortifying the works or Lusts of the Flesh, as in other Duties,
does not truly Believe in him; shall not without hearty Repentance, or new
Purification of the heart and spirit either see God, or be partaker of Christ's
Kingdom.

11. Another Precept of Christ there is more General then the Former.
[Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do unto them, for
this is the Law and the Prophets.] So far is the whole Christian world (as we
call it) from keeping this Commandment, that the Practices most Contrary to it,
are so Universal, and so violent, as that, both the Casuists and professed
Interpreters of Scriptures have almost lost the true meaning of it; at least
have utterly neglected the extending or branching of it into useful Rules of
Good life, or for bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit. And which is worse,
such learned and pious men, as have undertaken the Cure of souls, and have been
solemnly sworn to the faithful Execution of Pastoral Charge, dare not press the
Observance of this Great Commandment upon their Flock which daily and hourly
most shamefully transgress it; partly by the uncontroled Practices of stubborn
people, partly by Authorized Rules in Courts of Justice. No Prophet of the Lord
dare speak his mind, or interpreter of the Gospel or spiritual Governor dare
put his Commission from Christ in Execution, unless such as are resolved to
suffer a Martyrdom from their flock, or from the Professors of the one or other
Law established throughout this Kingdom. Without Reference to any particular
Cause or Person, I dare boldly pronounce in the General, That not the Twentieth
Part of Tedious Suits or Vexations in Law, or other Grievances or oppressions
would either be set on foot by the People, or suffered to be prosecuted by Men
in Authority, if the Fear of God, Belief in Christ, Loyalty to their Sovereign
Lord, or Good Affection to their Country, were planted in Either of them, truly
or indeed.

12. The General Neglect of this Great Commandment of doing as we would be done
unto, in former times of our security and Peace has been always Dangerous;
But the Violation of it in these Times of Mortality, of Calamity and more then
wonted danger of worse to ensue, is Prodigious. For preventing the Execution of
Gods Judgments threatened for our Violation of This and other Commandments of
Christ, I must entreat all Sorts of men that hear me this day in the same words
for sense and meaning, which a Zealous and Learned Father sometimes used in
like case. Parcite Regi, Parcite Regno, parcite Populo Anglicano, parcite
Animabus Vestris. If there be any true Love and Loyalty in us toward our
Gracious Sovereign Lord and his Royal Issue; any good Affection toward our
Native Country, or to our souls, Let us abate our wonted Pride and Luxury, our
wonted Covetousness. Let us not think it sufficient to abstain from Unjust,
Unchristian Vexation and Oppression of our Neighbors, unless we seriously
account that measure of Contentment (of our desires of what kind soever) which
heretofore has been Lawful, to be in these times more then most Inexpedient.
To use that Plenty of Diet or measure of Recreation, but especially that
Benefit or Advantage of Laws, for advancing our selves or increasing our
Fortune, which heretofore we have done, perhaps without sin; Let This also in
these times be esteemed Impious, or a sin not to be Expiated without hearty
Repentance and extraordinary Performance of works of Mercy. Dan. 4. 27.
The End of the Second Sermon.

13. The Authors Connection of the 21 Chapter to the 4 Section, as it was before
These two Sermons were inserted.
But the more we labor further to unfold this Argument of our Natural
Servitude unto sin, the faster we shall draw another Knot: or, the more we
press the several Branches of this Servitude upon the Conscience of the
Untegenerate or not well sanctified man, the greater Perplexity we shall Create
unto him in another part of Theology, whose Knowledge is altogether as
Necessary and as useful, as our Experience of Natural Servitude unto sin, is.
The Knot or perplexed Difficulty is; What Kind or what portion of Freedom of
Will, is, or can be Compossible with Absolute Servitude unto sin in the
Unregenerate or Unsanctified man.

CHAP. XXIV.
Of the Difficulties of the Controversies Concerning Free Will, with the
Reasons why They have troubled the Church so long.
1.IF we should abstract this Problem from the Difficulties wherewith it may
seem to be entangled by the former discourses Concerning our Servitude to Sin,
and consider it only in its own Nature and Essence: this Question alone has
ministered more matter of intricate Disputes, The main Point about FreeWill,
scarce well stated in any Age since the Apostles times.
then any other Controverted Point in Theology. He that has leisure, skill,
and opportunity to take an accurate Historical Survey of the the true State,
(or rather of the Instability or ill stated Tenor) of this Point since the
death of our Saviors Apostles or other Canonical Writers of the New Testament,
will easily discover that the Disputes about it Pro and Con have been like to a
Pair of Scales which never came to any Permanent Stay or constant Settling upon
the right Center, but have one while wagled this way, another while that way.
The Orthodoxal Truth Concerning this Point, as it was taught by our Savior
himself and by his Apostles, and maintained by those who did immediately
succeed them, is; That there was no other State or Fatality in Humane Affairs
or Events, save only This, That such as sought after Glory and Immortality by
well doing, should undoubtedly be rewarded according to their Works; that all
such as continue in impious or ungodly Courses, shall treasure up Wrath against
the Day of Wrath, and bring a Necessity upon themselves of being Everlastingly
tormented.

2. The Stoics first, and after them the Manichees did oppose this Heavenly
Doctrine, by maintaining a strange and more then Brutish Opinion, which had
been hatched before our Savior Christ was born, to wit, That all Effects or
Events whether contrived by men, or otherwise projected by Nature it self, did
fall out by an Indispensable and Unconquerable Necessity. The Necessary Issue
of this Doctrine (as was apprehended by all Christian Antiquity) did amount
thus high, See S. August. 1 Tom. 3. Books de lib. Arb. and 7 Tom. L. de lib.
Arb. and Gra. c. 2. Quomodo jubet Deus, si non est Liberum Arbitrium?
That all those Exhortations to repentance, to sanctity or to newness of life,
and to the practice of Good works Moral or Spiritual (whether these were given
to us men, by our Savior Christ, or by his Apostles) had been better directed
to Horse or Mule (or other more Docile Reasonlesse Creatures) then unto the
unregenerate Man, from whom to take away all Freedom of Will, (as Fate or
Necessity does) were to make him a Degree Lower, and place him in an Estate or
Condition of life much worse, then the most foolish or most noisome Reasonlesse
Creatures do, by their Creators Bounty, enjoy.

3. S. Chrysostom. 1. Tom. Hom. 62. Orat. 2. de Fato, says that A Fatalist cannot
be saved.
The Ancient Fathers of the first and best Ages, Justin Martyr, Origin,
Athanasius, Nyssen, Jerome, etc. did so zealously intend the Extirpation of this
Heresy, or rather Heathenish Infidelity, which necessarily deprived men
(whether regenerate or unregenerate) of all Freedom of Will in what Action
soever, that they seldom mentioned the Use or necessity of Grace, for
performance of Actions truly Good. For this (as some have well observed) was
impertinent to the Question then only agitated betwixt Them and Graceless men,
Stoics,
I mean, or Manichees. They only sought to fortify the Sentence Contradictory
unto these Blasphemous Tenants Concerning the Absolute Fatality of Humane
Actions, whether Good or Bad. Now Pelagius having observed, that such of these
Reverend Fathers as lived and writ before him, did say little or sometimes
nothing for Magnifying of Grace, but exceeding much and very well for
establishing some kind of Free Will in men, more then is to be found in beasts,
took hence Occasion to exalt Free Will and depresse Grace; even whilst the
Controversy was, about the Concurrence of Gods Free Grace and man's Free Will;
a Point not thought of amongst Christians in Primitive Times; it being then
taken as granted by all, Toll Liberum Arbitrium, non erit Quod; Toll Gratiam
Liberam non erit Quo, Salvetur.

Toll Liberum Arbitrium, quomodo Deus judicabit;

Toll Gratiam quomodo Salvabit mundum? Epist. 1. ad Valentin: Tom. 7.


that however Free Will be Necessary unto salvation (a Quality without which a
man is neither capable of Reward nor Punishment) yet the only Cause of man's
Redemption from Servitude to sin, or of Salvation by such Redemption, was the
Free Grace of God, as it issues from the Sole Fountain of Life and Grace, The
Man Christ Jesus, God Incarnate.

4. Pelagius having drawn the one Scale of this Dispute so far awry on the one
side, did provoke certain Monks in Africa (whose Founder or principal
Benefactor was one Valentinus) to wrest the other Scale as far amiss on the
otherside, and to jump with the Stoics or Manichees Opinion. This stirred up
the spirit of that most Learned Father of those times (I mean for Rational or
Scholastic disputes) S. Austin, to attempt the drawing of a Middle Line
between these Two Extravagancies or Extremities, which he oftentimes performed
with a steady and constant hand, yet sometimes, too often (if so it had pleased
the Lord) did faulter. Since his death, not only the forementioned Difficulty
Concerning The Compossibility of Gods Free Grace and man's Free Will, but the
very true and punctual meaning of this Learned Moderator, has been by his
Followers, whether Fathers, Schoolmen or Others, so meanly Tufted, and so
unskilfully hunted after, as a Man that would take pains to read them may fitly
apply that Conceit, which a pleasant Wit entertained, of a Text forsaken by the
Preacher or professed Handler of it, to the true State of the main Question
Concerning Freedom of Will; that is, A march Hare might have sit upon it and
never have been started for all the barking and bauling of Contrary Factions or
opposite Sectaries; some Three or Four (not so well esteemed or seconded as
they deserved) only excepted.

5. One Principal Reason of so little Speed and less good Success in this
Search, has been; because the most of such as have undertaken this Task,
usually took no more of the main Controversy into due consideration then did
lie just under their Level, or between them and the Scope at which they aimed.
And that was if not only, yet principally the Confutation of others Errors or
Heretical Doctrine: an attempt which seldom finds any good Atchievance, unless
it be managed with much discretion, with moderation of passions or affections.
Nor will this suffice unless the Party thus qualified be enabled with Good
Literature, distinctly to set down the true and Positive Grounds of that Truth,
about whose meaning or extent, Questions usually arise; or to resolve the
several Branches of Controversies moved, into their first Stems, roots, or
seeds. He that will adventure to write or speak of Election, Reprobation, or
Predestination, before he be so well instructed in the Grounds of Philosophy
both Natural and Moral, as to understand the Nature, Properties, and several
Stems of Free Will, or to make search after all or any of these, before he
clearly know what Necessity and Contingency are; wherein they differ, or how
they sometimes intermingle, or the one of them grow into the other, shall (as
too Many in our times have done) so Crosse-shackle himself with Ramistical
Pot-Hooks or Dichotomies, that he shall be enforced either to stumble or
enterfere at every second or third step. For avoiding this inconvenience, into
which I had from my Youth observed many otherwise Learned Writers (through want
of skill in true and solid Logic, but especially in Philosophy) to fall, I
have premised what I hope was rightly conceived concerning the forementioned
Fundamental Points of See His sixth Book of Com. or Attributes. part 2. Sect. 2.
Fate, Necessity, and Contingency. And by help of those Principles as clearly
as the matter would suffer heretofore discussed at large, I trust I shall be
able to treat of this present Argument of Free Will, and hereafter of
Predestination so far as is fitting (or shall be permitted me by Authority)
Consequently to mine own Grounds or Positions, without enterfering or stumbling
in my course; without crossing or trenching upon any point of Catholic Faith
or Orthodoxal Doctrine.

And according to this Sense or signification, every thing is said to be done
Sponte or Freely, or Freely to come to pass, which is done or comes to pass by
the proper or Natural Inclination of any bodily Substance, Whether it be
endowed with life, or sense, or with motion only. Thus we say, the Water has a
Free-Course, or runs Freely when it runs that way which Nature inclines it,
without any Let or Hinderance, or without any Artificial or External Help to
draw, move, or impell it. Freedom in this sense is opposed only to Coaction, to
Constraint, or Inforcement. As when water is drawn or impelled to such a
course, which left to it self it would not take, we say it is a Forced Stream
or Current; not a Free Stream: And so we call those Grounds, Forced, which
bring forth little or no fruit, without great labor, toil or cost, unto such
as Till or dress them. And in this Sense the Latin word Liberum, unto which our
English Freedom or Liberty does more properly and directly answer, then unto
the Latin Spontaneum, is sometimes used, to wit, as it is opposed only to
Coaction or Inforcement: So a Poet describing the happy Estate of the world in
the Golden Age, says, -- Ipsaque tellus Omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.
The Earth did bring forth all things necessary or expedient for the use or
comfort of man Freely: that is, Of its own Accord, without the Labor,
industry, or provident dressing of man. Thus, This, and Other Of that Age Ovid.
Met. Lib. 1.
Ipsa quoque immunis, rastroque intacta, nec ullis
Saucia vome^ibus, per se dabat omnia T^llus --.
Mox etiam fruges Tellus inarata ferebat: Nec renovatus ager gravidis canebat
aristis:

Poets speak of the Golden Age, from some Broken Notions or Traditions of man's
First Estate in Paradise, and of that Estate wherein the world and all things
should have continued, if Man had not fallen. But this Temper of the Earth is
much altered, or rather inverted by the fall of man. Most men (it may be) have
heard or read of that Answer which an Ancient Philosopher made to this
Question; See Horace his Arva Beata. Epod. 16.
Reddit ubi Cererem tellus inarata quotannis, etc.
Illic injussae veniunt ad mulctra capellae, etc.

[Why Nettles, Thistles, and other like weeds should grow so fast in such
abundance, of their own accord; when as flowers, herbs, or comfortable fruits
did not grow at all, or seldom come to any good proof without the extraordinary
pains or skill of man?] The best Answer which the Philosopher could make was
this; [ That the Earth was a Natural and Kind Mother unto Nettles, weeds, and
grass; but a Stepmother only to Flowers, Herbs, or Fruit.] Now the Answer,
though for those times held witty, was no way Satisfactory. For a man might
have further asked him; why the Earth should be a kind mother and Loving nurse
to weeds; and a hard or Cruel Stepmother to herbs or Fruits? Unto this
Question the youngest Child amongst us that is rightly Catechized in the
Grounds of Religion, or has but read the three first Chapters of the first
Book of Moses, may give a more full and satisfactory Answer, then the wisest
Philosophers, without the Principles of Christian Religion, could do. The Cause
then or Reason is from the Curse wherewith God cursed the Earth for man's
Transgression, Genesis 3. 17, ^8, 19. Because thou have eaten of the tree, of
which I commanded thee, saying, thou shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground
for thy sake: In sorrow shall thou eat of it, all the days of thy life. Thorns
also and Thistles shall it bring forth to thee: and thou shall eat the herb of
the field. In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread, till thou return unto
the ground. But though the Heath^n^ could not know this Story by Light of
Nature: yet thus much being revealed or made known unto them, they might easily
have gathered; That if the Earth was thus accursed for Man's sake, the Nature of
man was first accursed or corrupted: As in very deed this preposterous and
untoward inclination of the Earth to bring forth weeds Freely and plentifully,
and good Fruit hardly or by Constraint or Coaction, is but an Emblem or visible
Picture of the untoward and corrupt disposition of man's heart to bring forth
the Fruits of the Flesh Voluntarily, Freely and plentifully; whereas it does
not, it cannot bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit, without the skill and
husbandry of Him that made it. We have the seeds of sin and iniquity planted in
us by Nature; and they fructisie and increase by our sloth and negligence. As
for the fruits of Righteousness, the Seeds of them must be sown in us by the
Spirit of God: And being sown, they do not grow up and prosper without his
Extraordinary Blessing upon his own plants, and his Servants Labors. Though
Paul may plant, and Apollo water, yet it is God only that gives the increase, I
am the Vine (says our Savior, John 15. 1.) and my Father is the Husbandman:
And (as the Apostle, 1. Cor 3. 9. speaks) we are his Husbandry. So that in
Respect of the Fruits of Righteousness and Works Spiritual, man's Nature is not
Free according to this First Acception or Sense of Freedom; that is, as it was
opposed unto Coaction: But in respect of the Fruits of the Flesh our corrupt
Nature is most Free; These it brings forth of its own accord more Freely and
more plentifully then the Earth (which God has cursed for man's sake) does
Nettles, Thistles, or any worse kind of weed. And yet the more Freely our
Nature brings forth the Fruits of sin, the more deeply it is still tainted with
the Servitude of Sin. So that Freedom and Servitude in some cases, at least in
respect of diverse Objects, are not Opposite, but Coincident or Compatible in
One and the same subject or Person.

2. This kind of Freedom which is only opposed to Coaction or Inforcement, Of
the Radical Difference between Creatures Inanimate and Vegetahles
though it be truly and properly in Creatures Inanimate and void of life: yet
is it in an higher Degree in Creatures Vegetable or Sensitive. Inanimate or
Livelesse creatures have their Inclinations so set by Arist. Eth. Nicom. Lib 2.
Cap. 1.
Nature, that no Contrary Inclination can be implanted in them by Custom: As
if you move a stone every hour of the day upwards, it will still move its
selfas Freely and as swiftly downwards, as it did at the First. We cannot work
any Inclination or propension in it, (...)
either to move it self upwards, or to be more easily moved by us. But
Vegetables of what kind soever, Grass Corn, (or weeds which growup with them)
Herbs or plants; albeit they have no Freedom or power at all to move themselves
out of the places wherein they grow: yet have they a Natural Faculty to
increase themselves, or be augmented by the Benignity of the Earth wherein they
grow, and the influence of moisture and heat from Heaven; A Capacity withal,
which stones or other inanimate Creatures have not, to be much bettered both in
growth and quality by the industry or skilful husbandry of man. Another degree
or rank of Animate or Living Creatures there is, which the Grecians call (...)*
and the Latins, as well as they can expersse the Greek, Stirp-Animalia, (or
Plant-Animalia) that is, Living Creatures in some respects best resembling mere
Vegetables; in others, Sensitives, which we call Animalia. The most of this
rank Live in the Sea, as Oysters, Cockles, Mustles, or other duller kinds of
Shel-Fishes, which herein agree with mere Vegetables, in that they can hardly
move themselves out of their places, as from the Rocks or Sands wherein they
breed, and yet have a Sense or feeling of their proper Nutriment, or of its
want; which mere Vegetables have not; and a Motive power within themselves,
(answerable to this sense of pain or pleasure) of opening or shutting their
mouths, or those instruments of Sense by which they suck in their food or
nutriment. Some Land Creatures there be (if we may believe good Writers without
our own Experiments) that hold the same Correspondency between mere Vegetable
and Sensitive Creatures, which the forementioned Shel-Fishes or Sea-Creatures
do. To omit the reports of the Russian Lamb or other like Sensitives which are
fastened to the Earth out of which they grow: It has been in my hearing, and in
a Solemn Audience avouched by as great a Philosopher and Divine as any that
have written of the West Indies; That there is a kind of herb or Plant about
Portrico, which though it cannot move it self out of its place, yet has as
nimble and wily motions within it self; as great a Command over its own
Branches, to decline ungrateful touches, as any perfect Sensitive Creatures
have, which are tied to a certain Station or settled Footing.

3. Creatures truly Sensitive, (that is, such as far exceed Vegetables or the
(...)) besides the Sense of pain in want or indigence of food, or the pleasure
they take when it is in competent measure afforded them, Of the difference
betwixt Vegetables and Sensitives, and their motive power.
have a Power (some greater some less) to Move themselves out of their places,
and to seek their Nutriment; and after satisfaction made to hunger, to betake
themselves unto places most convenient for their Rest or Sleep, This Capacity
of sense, whether of pain or pleasure, or of motion to enjoy the one and avoid
the other, is in every Sensitive Creature, even in the worm, or snail in some
degree or other, but not Equal in all. Some are most swift in their Motions,
though much defective in other sense, as Flies, Gnats, Beetles or other meaner
Volatile or flying Creatures which are not capable of durable pain, nor of
Memory to avoid such pain as they are capable of; being apt to be quelled with
such light blows or touches, as cannot annoy stronger Sensitives or Four-footed
Beasts. Amongst the more perfect or stronger sort of Sensitives or Brutes, some
are endued with better Memory, or Dexterity of Exercising their senses or
motive Faculties, then we (...) are. But the best of mere Sensitive Creatures,
especially such as are by nature tam^, or apt to be tamed, as Horses, Hounds,
Hawks, etc. although they have no other Freedom then that which is opposed to
Coaction: yet are their Inclinations alterable by Custom, as Lyoung u^ made
proof and Demostration to the Lacedaemonians by his two Plutarch De Liberis
Educandis. Et in Laconicis Apophtheg.
wh^lps of the same kind; whose inclinations by nature were the same, yet Both
much altered by breeding or training.

4. Wherein then do we Reasonable Creatures exceed the best of these docile
Sensitives? In this; That albe^t they exereise their Faculties of sense or
motion more dexterously and more sagaciously by instinct of nature, and have a
greater aptness to perceive approaching denger, or to receive impressions or
occurrences from wind and weather, then men have: yet have they no power, no
Freedom at all to Reflect upon such Occurrences or Impressions; much less to
Calculate or weigh them aright, but an excellent Capacity only to entertain
them as they are offered. Thus sheep and other cattle; diverse sorts of birds or
fouls of the air do often unwittingly Prognosticate the alteration or change of
weather by their voice or motions, before wiser men or Astronomers can take
just notice of it, save only by Their motions, voices, or gestures.

5. Now as Sensitive Creatures do far exceed mere Vegetables in sense of pain
or pleasure, of the true difference betwixt mere Sensitive and Reasonable
Creatures.
and in the motive Faculty: so the Reasonable Creature does far excel the best
and most docile Sersitives in a Faculty or Power peculiar to himself alone
amongst all visible or Corporeal Substances, That is, in a Power to Reslect
upon what he has seen, heard, or felt, or remembers, either concerning motions
or impressions made by or within himself, or in any other part or member of
this visible world. A Power or Faculty Likewise Every son of man who has
attained unto the use of Reason, has to number such Occurrences as have
befallen himself, or such as he has observed to befall others, or to have
happened (however) within his Memory, and a further Branch of the same
Reflective Power or Faculty to Calculate and weigh them with their
Circumstances whether of Time or Place, and to Compare Occurrences past, or
matters observed before with Occasions or Occurrences present, and out of the
Consideration of both, to make Observations or Presages of what by probable
Conjecture may ensue.

6. From this Reflective Power or Faculty and the Branches of it, all of them
being Peculiar to man, amongst all visible or middle-world-Creatures, does that
Freedom of Will immediately Result: the search of whose several Branches,
whether growing by Nature and bettered by Gods special Providence, or
immediately implanted or ingrafted by Grace, is the principal Subject of the
Treatises following.

7. The First Root of this kind of Freedom, as it is Man's Peculiar above all
other visible Creatures, is, That Reflective Power beforementioned upon his
Observations, whether made upon the dispositions or Docility of Sensitive
Creatures wild or tame, or upon the suggestions or Operations of his own
senses, or that part of those Faculties of his Soul or Body, in which he is
rather a Sensitive Contradistinct to mere Sensitives, then any way supereminent
to them. Now there is not, at least there ought not to be, any scruple or
Question; Whether every man which has attained to the use of Reason or of
ordinary discretion, have not the same Power or Faculty to correct or improve
his own natural Dispositions' or Sensitive Inclinations, which Lycurgus
practiced with good success upon his Two Whelps of the same kind. No Question
again there is or ought to be, Whether Parents or other Instructers have not
the like Power to correct or alter the inclinations of Children in their
Minority or Nonage, by good Discipline or Education. Whence if we should grant
that Postulatum or supposition which Galen that great Philosopher and Physician
with much diligence has endeavored to Demonstrate, [Mores animi sequuntur
temper amentum Corporis: that the manners or dispositions of men unto moral
virtues or vices, necessarily depend upon the Temperature of the body:] Yet can
it never be evinced or made Probable, that the Peculiar Temperature of any man's
body, may not be altered by the forementioned Reflective Power which every man
has, and may exercise over his own senses, humors, or manner of diet; or to
ruminate upon the Advertisments given him by Philosophers or Physicians, either
for correcting his inordinate appetites or dispositions, or for improvement of
such seeds of virtue as are in some degree or other, by nature implanted in men
or Children of the worst Temperature of Body. And though Galen, for ought we
know, did dye uncured of that Erroneous or Heretical Opinion which was the
scope of his Book, or of that distemperature whether of body or of mind which
did breed that Opinion: Yet a Late Learned Baptis^a Persona.
Commentator has so cured his Book, that sober young Students may peruse or
visit it without danger of infection from it.

8. But the Principal, if not the only Stem of the forementioned Freedom,
consists in man's Power to Reflect upon his own Rational Thoughts or Projects.
And this Power or Faculty no man, no power on earth can alter or take from
another, how mean soever. For it is truly said, if it be rightly applied, that
Thought is Free, not from Punishment, if we think amiss, For the Searcher of
Hearts will Judge the most Secret Thoughts: but Free from Coaction, from
constraint, or inforcement, We may be commanded or enforced to Do what another
will have us to do: but we cannot be compelled to think what another would have
us think; or to Will what they would have us to Will. They may Propose some
Particular unto us being in it self very Good and agreeable unto our desires:
yet the Goodness of it unless we please, cannot constrain or enforce us to
desire it for that time. If we want some other Particular Good of the same kind
to Counterpoyze or withdraw our Desire from it, the very Goodness of the Free
exercise of our own Will, will suffice. The very Trial or Experiment of this
our Freedom and Power to abstain from many things in themselves desirable, and
with which most men are tempted and overswayed, is oft-times more Pleasant,
then any Particular Sensitive Good.

9. This is all I had to say Concerning such several Kinds or Degrees of
Freedom or Power in Visible Creatures, or of Free Will a Faculty Peculiar to
man, as may be Learned from the Book of Nature. All these several Sorts or
Degrees of Freedom hitherto expressed in English, are answerable to that which
the Latins call Spontaneum, Liberum, or Libera Voluntas. But whether Liberum
Arbitrium, an Expression (used by many good Latin-Writers) of the Greek (...),
be a Style whereof men in this Life be capable; Or what Ranks of Men be Capable
of It, is a Point which cannot be determined without Examination of the
Properties of Free Causes or Agents.

CHAP. XXVI.
Containing the Definition and Properties of Free Causes or Agents properly so
called.
1. CAusa Libera est, quae, Freedom or Liberty of choice.
positis omnibus ad agendum requisitis, potest agere vel non agere. This
Definition of a Free Cause so far as it concerns Man, whether Regenerate or
Unregenerate, is Orthodoxal and Sound; but not so Orthodoxal and sound in
respect of all Free Agents, at least not so unquestionable in respect of them.
For there is all Free Agrents an Agency as well Immanent as Transient. That we
call (as our betters before us have done) An Agency Immanent, Which produces
no Effect, save only in the Agent. Agencie Immanent. Transient.
But every true Cause whether Free or Natural, is always presumed able to
produce some Effect Extra Se, which shall not be terminated Within its Self,
Concerning this Definition, See victoria in His 13. Relectio^, upon that of
Ecclus. cap. 15. Deus ab initio constituit hominem, and reliquit illum in manu
consilii fui.
but such as does or may appear in the Visible Book of the Creatures.

2. The Omnipotent Agent or Supreme Cause of Causes, throughout all Eternity
can work or not work Whatsoever, Whenever, it pleases him, without any
Matter Praeexistent to his Work, or any Condition requisite or Praerequired to
his working. He Freely, that is, without Necessity, made all things of Nothing,
without any Counselor or Adviser either for proposing or soliciting, much
less for Limiting or prescribing the Laws or manner of all secondary Causes
workings, or of the Effects possible to be wrought by them. The Bounds or
Limits of all Secondary Agents Operations, are Necessity and Contingency. Such
Agents as by the Laws respectively given unto them by the Supreme Agent and
Lawgiver, are said to produce their Operations by Necessity, or by
Determination to This or That purpose and to no other, cannot without Solecism
be accounted or called Free Agents or Causes. The premised Definition then, [
Causa libera estquae positis omnibus ad agendum requisitis, etc.] must be
restrained to the Angelical and Humane Nature. The Former Definition restrained
to the Angelical and Humane Nature.
Neither of these two Natures or Agents can produce any Real Effect Extra Se
Without Themselves, unless they have some Matter praeexistent to work upon:
nor any Immanent Action Within themselves, without such Concomitancies or
Assistancies as are requisite to the Use or Exercise of their natural Freedom,
So that both of them are only so far Free in their Actions or Choices, as the
Omnipotent Creator shall permit or give them leave to use or exercise their
natural Freedom. Now their Natural Freedom as it is opposed to that which we
call Spontaneum or Lubency in Vegetables only, or mere Sensitive Creatures, is
but a Branch (as has been intimated before) of Contingency; Contingertia est
duplex; Intrinseca, ex Electione; Extrinseca ex casu, orta. See Suarez
Metaphys. Disp. 19. Sect. 10. Number. 4.
so that we cannot annoy and hurt the One, but we must annoy and hurt the
Other. Id Contingens est, quod potest esse vel non esse; That, only in true
Philosophy and Divinity is properly Contingent, which heretofore so has been,
as it might not have been; or hereafter may as well not be, as really be, or
come to pass. So far then is that Vulgar, but lately received opinion [That
nothing is Contingent, save only in respect of Second Causes] from all show of
Truth or Probability; that all things indeed besides the Supreme Agent or
Causes of Causes, (...), are in respect of Him, Contingent. For HE alone being
Absolutely, Independently, and Uncontrollably Free in all his Actions, had an
Absolute Freedom either to Create, or not to Create this World as now it is; an
Absolute Freedom Likewise to endow Angels or men with such a Freedom as now
they have, that is, a Power of Contingency in their Operations, or rather of
producing Effects Contingent, that is, such Effects as have been so produced by
them as that they might not have been produced, or may hereafter (always
presupposing the Limitation or moderation of the Supreme Cause or Agent) be
produced or not produced.

3. This kind of Freedom is of Two Sorts, or rather has two Branches: It is
either of mere Contradiction, Free Will of Two Sorts.
or of Contrariety. Or in other Terms, it is either Quoad Exercitium, or Quoad
Specificationem. As for Example: It is Free for us to walk or not to walk in
the morning. And if we resolve, not to walk, not determining what else to do;
this is Libertas Contradiction is, or quoad Exercitium. It is likewise Free for
us to read or not to read: And after we have resolved to read some Book or
other, it is Free for us to make choice of some Godly Treatise, or of some
Lascivious Pamphlet. In choosing the one and refusing the other, we are said to
do Freely Liberate Contrarietatis, or quoad Specificationem.

4. All the Controversy amongst Divines is about the Second kind of Freedom,
which is opposed to Necessity. About this, the Question is, Whether it be
Common to every Rational or Intelligent Nature: Or if in some Degree or other
it be Common to all; how far Communicable to every such Nature, according to
their several states or Conditions?

5. Without prejudice to other Men's Opinions, which we rather seek to Reconcile
and to be reconciled unto, then to Contradict or to be Contradicted by them;
Our First Assertion shall be This. [There is no Rational or Intelligent Nature,
but is Free according to the Second Kind of Freedom: (that is, It is Freed from
all Necessity of doing or not doing of what it does or does not) in Respect of
some Acts, Operations, or Objects.] This Assertion we take as granted out of
the Grounds of Philosophy. For this Freedom whereof we treat, is one of the
most Essential, if not the very First and Radical Prerogative which Reason has
above Sense.

6. Our second Assertion shall be This: [The most Excellent Intellectual
Nature, the very Excellency of Nature, Essence and Intellection, is not Free
with this Freedom of Indifferency or Option in respect of Every Object.] God
Almighty himself is not Free with this kind of Freedom, to Act or intend Good
or Evil. The Infinity of his Transcendent Goodness, or (which is all one) the
Immensity of his All Sufficiency, absolutely exempts him from all Temptation or
Possibility of intending harm to any of his Creatures which are capable of
wrong. In that he is the Infinite Fountain of Goodness Moral, he cannot be the
Author or Abetter of any thing which is Morally Evil: Nay the very best
Operation that can be ascribed to the Almighty Father (to wit, the Eternal
Generation of his only Son) is not Free in the Second but only in the Former
Sense above mentioned. He was begotten of the substance of his Father before
all Worlds, by Necessity more then Natural. And He that from Eternity thus
begat Him, does so infinitely and Eternally Love his only Begotten Son, as he
can never cease to Love Him, or begin to hate Him. So that the Almighty Himself
in respect of his Love to his Only Son, was never Free according to either
Branch of Freedom mentioned, to wit, either with the Freedom of contrariety or
contradiction. But (as the Apostle says) Of his own Will begot he Us with the
word of Truth: We are his Sons by Adoption, not by Nature, nor by any Necessity
Equivalent to that which is Natural. It was more Free for him to adopt or not
to adopt us, then it is for any Father to appoint his Heirs or Executors, or to
Estate or dispossess his Children.

7. In as much as Goodness is the Essential Object of our heavenly Fathers
most Holy Will; it is most Essential and most Necessary to Him, to Will
nothing, but that which is Good: Yet is He not hereby either Essentially or
necessarily tied to will This or That Particular Good. All things that are
truly Good were Created by Him: Nor was it Necessary that he should Create
these Particulars and no others. Yea, it was Free for him to create or not to
create any thing at all. So then within the Sphere of Goodness, He is Liberum
Agens, An Agent most Free. It was Free for him to create or not to create us:
It is Free for him to preserve or not preserve us; yea to preserve or destroy
us: It is Free for him to Elect or not to Elect us, or to destinate us to Life
or Death Eternal. He wounds and he makes whole: He gives Life and takes it
away at his pleasure: He brings down unto the grave, and raises up the Dead
again: Spiritus est ubi vult, sua munera dividit, u^ vult:
Dat cui vult, quod vult, quantum vult, tempore quo vult.

He Freely bestows his Blessings on whom he will, when he will, and in what
measure he will. It was Free for him to Decree or not to Decree any thing
concerning us: Nor has he Decreed any thing for us or against us which may be
prejudicial to his Eternal Liberty. For if his supposed Decrees should
Necessitate His Will in those Particulars wherein it was absolutely and from
Eternity Free, he should Freely make himself or his Will, Mutable: whereas we
are bound to Believe that His Will is immutably Free; or that the very Freedom
of His Will is Immutable.

8. No Agent Free in respect of All: Every Rational Agent Free in respect of
Some Objects.
The Angelical Nature was created Free in respect of Good and Evil. Every Angel
had a Twofold Power or Possibility: One of continuing in Goodness or in the
Way of Life; Another of diverting from it to the Ways of Death. Satan and his
Angels have lost all Freedom in respect of Goodness in the Ways of Life, but
not all Freedom Simply. For albeit they have no Possibility left them, of doing
or willing any Good: yet have they manifold Possibilities of doing several
Evils; more Free to Sin, then before. They have brought a Necessity upon
themselves of intending nothing but that which is hurtful to the Sons of men:
but they do not Necessarily intend This or That Particular Hurt which they do
de Facto, and no other: nor do they so Necessarily hurt This or That Particular
Person at This Instant, but that it was possible for them to let him alone, and
to hurt some other. Some or more (it may be) of this infernal Crew are always
attending our Public or Private Meetings, especially about Sacred Affairs or
Devotions. The only End of their coming is to dishonor God, and to do mischief
unto man. In respect of this End indefinitely taken they are not Free, unless
with that kind of Freedom which is opposed only unto Coaction: Both Branches of
this End they intend so willingly, that they cannot cease to intend them, or to
will the Contrary.

9. Yet notwithstanding this Necessity, they have Freedom left to cull or choose
out the Parties whom they mean to tempt: And after they have determined on the
Party, they have Freedom left to make choice of the Particular Temptation; as
whether to solicit them to Pride, rather then to Lust, whether to provoke
them to Anger, or to ungodly mirth. A true Freedom likewise they have (after
the choice of temptation made) to continue, or change their Baits, to
prosecute, or give over their particular present Pojects.

10. The Angels which kept their First Station when the Rebellious did forsake
it, have since by Gods Providence lost all Freedom of Will to do Evil; but with
increase of their Freedom in doing well. A Necessity is Laid upon them of
serving God and him only, yet not hereby necessarily constrained or wrought,
no, not by the Incomprehensible and Sweet Contrivance of the Divine Decree, to
do Him this Particular Service at this time and no other; not Necessarily
enjoined by Gods Will or their own, to abide so long in this place as they do,
and no longer or shorter while. Their Intentions to wards man are always Good,
yet not Necessarily bound to do that Determinate Good which they do to this man
and no other. To make choice of the Party whom at this instant they especially
mean to Protect, is as Free for them as it is for us, among a multitude of
Beggars to make choice of some one or two, on whom to bestow our Benevolence.
Now in the dispensing of Alms to the needy, or bequeathing Legacies to our
friends, we are (I take it) Free, not only from Necessity of Coaction or
constraint, but also Free from such Necessity as by virtue of the Eternal
Decree is Inevitable.

CHAP. XXVII.
Of the Difference betwixt Servitude and Freedom in Collapsed Angels, and
unregenerate men: and of the inequality of Freedom in respect of diverse Objects
and degrees in Natural men.
1. BUt before we come to speak of the Unregenerate Man's Free Will and its
proper Subject, What FreeWill in the Natural or unregenerate Man.
we must lay this Charge upon the Reader, not to interpret or rather mistake
us, as if we Questioned; Whether Man were able to do Any Thing or no without
Gods Concourse or Assistance; or any Spiritual Good Thing without Grace. We
only seek [what kind of Freedom or Possibility of avoiding Evil, or doing
better, or less Evil then oft-times we do, is appointed to man by the
Immutable Decree.] If this Decree allow or permit us any Freedom of Will in
these Points: they wrong mankind much, and the Divine Nature more, that seek
either by Nice Distinctions utterly to take it from us, or by Timorous
Scrupulosities to quell or weaken our spirits or industry in use of It. This
Point also I would commend to every Readers Consideration; That between a mere
natural man, and a Man utterly forsaken of God, there is a Mean or Difference;
yea perhaps a greater Difference (in respect of the end of these ensuing
Quaeries, to wit, the salvation of men's souls) then is between the State of a
man Utterly for saken of God, and of Satan and his Angels.

2. In respect of Good and Evil the Humane Nature in the First Creation was as
truly and as properly Free, as the Angelical. The First Man was Like his
Creator truly and inherently Good, endued with Power of doing Well: But this
his Power was matched with a Possibility of doing Evil. And by his Free and
wilful Reduction of this Power into Act, He and his Children have utterly lost
all Possibility of doing Well. By nature, All of us are the Children of Wrath;
the Servants of sin from our birth: Nor can we be Freed from this S^rvitude
till we be made the Sons of God by the Grace of Adoption.

3. But though this Tenent of Reformed Churches be most true, to wit, That the
Humane Nature before Adams Fall was as truly Free as the Angelical, and that
all the Sons of men since his Fall are as truly subject to sin as the collapsed
Angels: yet neither was our Freedom before his Fall equal to Angelical Freedom,
nor this Servitude of sin in us so great, as that which is in the Devils. For
not to speak of the Elect or such as are certainly destinated to salvation; the
State of Cain (the Father of Reprobates) before he slew his Brother Abel
(though we consider it with reference to the Eternal Decree of Reprobation) was
not so desperate, as the Estate of the old Serpent. For God certainly did never
use that mild and gentle Language either to Satan or his Angels, which he did
to Cain a little before he slew his Brother. And the Lord said unto Cain, why
art thou wroth? and why is thy Countenance fallen? If thou do well, shall
thou not be accepted? and if thou do not well, sin Lies at the door: and
unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shall rule over him, Genesis 4. 6, 7.
Howbeit if at any time it had pleased the wisdom of God to make Loving Profers
of Impossibilities to his Creatures Choice: Satan and his Angels by rule of
Retaliation, had been the fittest Subjects of such Profers,
because it is their continual Practice to delude mankind in their misery, with
fair promises of those things which either they are not able, or never purpose
to perform.

4. But seeing the sons of men (until they be redeemed by Christ) and wicked
Spirits are both alike Servants to Sin, though their Servitude to it be not
Equal: the Question is [Wherein the Inequality of their Servitude consists?]
The Depth of the Angels Fall was by the Eternal Rule of Justice proportioned to
the Height of their knowledge and Happiness when they stood. Now their First
Station was much higher then man's; the one in Heaven, the other in Paradise.
And as they sinned more wilfully and haughtily: so they continued more wilful
and stubborn in the course of sin, then man. The Necessity which they brought
upon themselves is Twofold: First, a Necessity of doing always that which is
in its Own Nature Evil; Secondly, a Necessity of doing such evil, with
positively evil intentions. It is their delight to Countermand Gods Laws; to
make his Negative Precepts Their Affirmatives; and his Affirmatives their
Negatives. And knowing much better then most men do, with what particulars God
is more specially offended: they tempt every man, (as opportunity serves) to do
those things wherewith he is most offended. To tempt some men unto gross, foul,
or base sins, they see it bootlesse. Nevertheless in as much as no man can be
without some sin or other; they solicit all to be like themselves in one sin
at least, that is, in Impenitency. And to be finally Impenitent for the least
sin, is more offensive to the Goodness and Mercy of God, then all other sins
that can be by man Committed.

5. But some happily will thus far plead for Baal or Beelzebub and his
Followers; That many good Turns are done by them to some men. Yet even their
best Favors or greatest Benefits are worse then a biting usurers kindness.
Unto this man they may lend Wealth; to that man health; to a third procure ease
from pain, or use of Limbs: but all this with purpose to get the Eternal
inheritance of their Souls.

6. The Unregenerate sin not, in every Action, against men.
The merely Natural or unregenerate men in some actions sin not at all against
their Neighbors or Fellow. Creatures, to whom oft-times they heartily do that
Good, which they truly intended. And in such Actions, Their Offense (in respect
of Gods Law) is to be accounted (as I take it) Privative only, no way Positive.
Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Anacharsis, perhaps Diogen^s himself and many
other Heathen, would have done as the good Samaritane did; to any Passenger or
Citizen of the Great City. Now the Samaritans Action was not against Gods Law,
though not altogether according to his Law. Neither the Intention nor
Performance in Like deeds of mercy done by Heathen or mere natural men, are
void of evil, because the Doers are never affected with that Sincerity of
Heart, on with those Bowels of Compassion which Gods Law requires, much less
with those Referencies which are due unto Gods Glory. Yet if any man be of
Opinion, that the Heathen or unregenerate man does Positively and actually sin
against Gods Laws in the Best works that he can do, I will not contend with
him. For albeit I think my Former Assertion to be true: yet is it not my
purpose to take the truth of it for any Ground of the ensuing Discourse
Concerning the proper subject of man's Free Will.

7. The Unregenerate man has a true Freedom in doing Evil.
Supposing it were most true, That the best of unregenerate men do Positively
and actually sin against Gods Law in every Action that they do: Yet this shall
no way infringe our First Assertion which is this: The unregenerate man has a
true Freedom of will in the Choice of those particular Evils, into some one or
other of which he necessarily falls. For as the Absolute Impossibility or want
of Freedom to do Evil, does not bereave the Almighty of absolute Freedom in
doing Well: So neither does the unregenerate man's Impossibility of doing Good,
strip him of all Freedom in doing Evil. Though he cannot but do Evil, or do
every thing that he does, amiss: yet is there no Necessity that he should do
so great Evil, as oft-times he does; or do it so far amiss as he does. Few men
have any power or Freedom of Will not to be angry when they are provoked; not
to allay their anger so soon as they ought, after it be once, upon what Terms
soever, kindled. Yet even such as Ne^essarily sin this sin of unadvised Anger
in some degree or other^ do not thereupon necessarily commit Manslaughter,
Murder, or Blasphemy. Many men have Power or Freedom of Will in ruling their
tongues, which have no Freedom or power to stay the boiling of the heart in
anger. Many again in their passions have a Free Power over their hands, which
have none over their tongues. Many that can hardly hold their hands in heat of
anger, have a Freedom of will not to strike with edge-tools or weapons that may
make deadly wounds.

8. Every Unregenerate man at his first arrival at the Use of Reason is Free in
respect of the height or Extremity of those very sins unto which he is either
by General Corruption of nature or Peculiar Disposition of body, most subject.
It is not Necessary that he which is by Nature, Education, and Diet, most prone
to wantonness, Juvenal. N^mo repent suit turpissimus.
should delight in Adultery, or to be overtaken with temptations to Unnatural
Lusts. Into Acts or Crimes whether for their kind unnatural or Prodigious, or
for degree extremely evil, no natural man did ever Necessarily fall, nis^
Necessitate ex Hypothesi, that is, unless it were for abusing that Freedom of
Will, or choice which naturally he has in Ordinary evils, in things Moral or
Indifferent. But by sinning in a higher Degree, or oftener in any kind then the
corrupted estate of Nature or Sin merely inbred did Necessitate us unto, we
exempt our selves from the Protection of Gods ordinary and wonted Providence:
And thence exempted we naturally fall into an Estate or disposition of mind
most unnatural, and bring a See Chap. 18. last Parag. and Chap. 21. Parag. 3,
4, 5.
Necessity upon our selves of sinning extremely. Finally, without Gods Special
Grace, the best of us sinin every Action: without the guidance of his Fatherly
Providence we sin extremely against Every divine Commandment.

9. All of us at the First use of Reason have a true Freedom of Will in
avoiding such Occasions or Opportunities to sin, as being not avoided but
Voluntarily and Freely affected, draw a Necessity upon us of falling into foul
and grievous sins. It was perhaps impossible for AEgisthus to avoid Adultery,
so long as he betroathed himself to Sloth. But it was not impossible for him
(nor for any) to have avoided this disease; or at Least, to have been divorced
from it, after he had been betrothed to it. The Poet in my Opinion gave us a
truer Cause of this man's fault, then those Divines possibly can, which make all
Events Necessary or unavoidable in respect of Gods Decree: Quaeritur AEgisthus
quare sit factus Adulter?
In promptu causa est; desidiosus erat.


10. Supposing his slothfulness had been no sin in its self: yet would it be a
grievous sin in us to say, that the Almighty did Decree he should be slothful,
that he might become an Adulterer; or be an Adulterer, that he might become a
Reprobate, for manifestation of his Glory. His slothfulness in true Divinity
was the true and Necessary Cause of his Filthiness: But of his slothfulness
there was no Necessary Cause, To use Free Will extremely amiss, is not
Necessary but Contingent.
but a Cause Contingent only. The only Cause it had was the ill use of that
Freedom which he had in doing amiss, or avoiding Occasions of doing greater
evil. Now to use our Free Will further amiss then is Necessary, is merely
Contingent; no way Necessary. Albeit he could do nothing as he ought: yet he
might have done less ill in being employed in some honest Vocation or Lawful
Exercise, then by giving himself over to Pamper, Ease, and Sloth. In Lawful
employments we are commonly freed from all other ill Guests, besides our
selves: In Living Idly or doing nothing, we make our very hearts, our brains,
and souls like Empty Rooms for the Infernal Spirits to set up Shop in. The
Poets Observation is very useful for all, but most Peculiar for Younger
Students, and expressed in Terms to their Liking; Si non ante Diem librum cum
lumine poscas, Hor. Epist. 2.

Invidia vel amore vigil torquebere; Lib. 1.
si non
Intendas animum studiis, and rebus honestis.
If Men would give some Divine Precepts or Sentences, full Possession of their
Morning Thoughts; these would serve as so many Armed Men to keep out the
suggestions of the Devil,
the World and the flesh, from entering into their Hearts.

11. To hold this Freedom of Will in avoiding Occasions or motives to sin, is
most agreeable to the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches. All which (if I
mistake not) permit a Moderate and lawful Use of Vows, not only to men already
sanctified or in the estate of Grace, but unto all such as desire to avoid sin
and the Motives thereunto, that they may be sanctified. In these two Points I
hope we shall all agree: First, That we may not Vow any thing which is not in
our Power. Secondly, That the avoidance of Occasions or Motives to gross or
known sins is one of the most proper and most safe Objects of solemn Vows.

12. Some of our Wise and Godly Founders of Colleges, which died before
Reformation begun do not tie us by oath, never to transgress in matters of
Manners or Crime: But to undergo punishment for breach of good manners they
strictly tie us Virtute Juramenti. What is the reason? Surely that which we
said before: They well knew, that to undergo ordinary punishment, as loss of
Commons, or the like, was in our Power, and Consequently just matter of Vow:
But to avoid al actions punishable was not (as they foresaw) in our Power; No
part of the Object of our Free Will: and therefore they made it no Branch of
that Solemn Vow which we make to God for Observation of their Statutes.

13. Now as it is Lawful to Vow strict Observance of outward means, either
useful for avoiding grosser sins, or for repenting for them once committed: So
God upon diligent and faithful observance of our Vows in these or the like
subjects, does not only free us from being led into grievous temptations, but
so enlarges our Freedom of Will in other Points, that by the assistance of his
Gracious Providence we gain some Power over our own desires and affections,
which before we had not. This cannot seem strange in the course of Nature,
especially if we consider it as subject to Gods Favorable Providence. For
seeing our carnal appetites or affections are always nourished and
strengthened by External Occasions or Opportunities, they must needs be starved
or weakened by Substraction of this their Nutriment. And the weaker they are,
the better hand the spirit or Conscience gets over them; the easier they are to
be tamed and nurtured.

14. Many men have not the Power to abstain from Dainties when they are set
before them, or when they are invited to taste them: And the more yielding they
are to such Invitations, the greater Liberty will their Appetites take, and
leave them less Power to abstain from riotous Feasting. But until Long Custom
has brought forth a worse disposition then we bring with us from our Cradles:
it is far more Free and Easy for us to abstain from Houses of unhallowed
Mirth (or Good-Fellowship, as they are termed) then to abstain from those
Courses which are usually followed in them, after we be once accustomed to
them, In respect of every Negative Precept or things forbidden, it is always
More Easy to avoid the First This is manifest in that Great Example and
Champion of Chastity, holy Joseph. Who durst not stay to struggle for his
Garment (though it co^cerned him highly to have got away that which he knew
would be made a Cloak for his Mistresses sin, and a Color of His:) but hasted
and fled. Choosing rather to leave behind him a seeming Argument of his Guilt,
then by longer stay (or Reasoning after those two Arguments, of Wrong done a
Good Master, and Sin against a Good God, would not dissuade) to incur a Real
Danger, of becoming Guilty. Even so it is commanded, 2 Timothy 2. 22. Fly away
from Lust. We may and must resist the Devil and fight it out against Him: but
for Lust, the only way is (as when the house it on fire) Avoidance and Flight.
Haste away, Escape for thy life, (and Thy Souls Life) Look not behind Thee, nor
stay; lest the fire overtake thee, and so thou be consumed in the Flame.
Occasions, then to resist ensuing Opportunities. And the more Careful we are
in avoiding First Temptations, the more Capable we are (as was before
intimated) of Gods Peculiar Providence to shield us from the assaults of Satan.
Not that the less Abuse of our Free Will in Evil or in avoiding Occasions that
lead unto it, can Merit any such Favor; but the Extreme Abuse of such
Free Will as we have, Exempts us from those Privileges which Gods Infinite
Bounty bestows on us.

15. But let us take a man which has been so far from avoiding, that he has
been always industrious in seeking out Occasions to transgress; a man that by
continual entertainment of all Opportunities to sin, has yielded up his soul
to many foul and grievous sins: What Freedom of Will; what choice of means for
working Mortification or amendment, can be imagined to be left in such a Man?
shall we say he has Freedom of Will inter Mala? What portion of Freedom is in
such as Sin Extremely.
This were Destruere Suppositum. We will rather suppose him to have so far
abused that Free Will which men naturally have in doing Evil; that of Two, of
Three, of Four, or more Evils proposed together, he would be ready to choose The
Very Worst; always prone to embrace those Opportunities with greatest speed,
which lead to greatest mischiefs; One, Cui, e malis, id maxim placet, quod est
maximum. Is there any Method or place for medicine to this disease? The wicked
(says the Prophet) are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose
waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace says my God to the wicked,
Esaias 57. 20, 21. Now as the most dangerous and turbulent seas do not rage when
the winds are calm: So neither do the wicked some out their shame, when Actual
Temptations or provocations cease. And in as much as Occasions and
Opportunities do not at all times present themselves: Even he that has no
power to resist the least temptation that offers it self, nor Freedom of Will
to refuse the greatest Evil, and choose the least when both are actually
proffered, may in the Cessation of Actual Temptations, Reflect upon his former
Acts, and take a survey of his life past; especially if he be thereto
occasioned or persuaded by a discreet Admonitor, one that will not affright him
with the Marks of Reprobation. The first Branch of Freedom, or rather, the very
root of Free Will in every Reasonable Creature, is seated in this Power of
Reflection upon its own Acts. This is the First Point or Property, wherein
Reason does exceed Sense. Now he that has but this Branch of Freedom, to
Calculate his former Acts; has with it a Power to Charge his Soul with the
heavy burden of his sins. The Conscience will always be ready in quiet
thoughts to accuse the Flesh, and urge the Soul to bear Testimony against it.
And the soul or Conscience once brought to loath or dislike some special sins
is thereby made more Free; apt to bewail all other sins whatsoever, whether
Actual or Original. Unless David had been thoroughly stung with the Conscience
of murder or Adultery, that sweet Confession had never found such perfect vent
as it did: Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
me, Psalm. 51. 5. Every Creature on whom the Creator has bestowed any sense or
feeling of pain or pleasure, has Power to employ some motive Faculty, for
avoiding things grievous or hurtful, or for attaining things pleasant and
useful for bettering their present Estate. And if man have any sense or feeling
of his heavy burden, he cannot but in some sort or other desire to be released
from it. Upon this Principle, is that Exhortation of our Savior, Grounded:
Come unto me all ye that Labor and are heavy Laden, and I will ease you, Mat.
11. 28.

16. So then albeit there be a true Freedom of Will in all the sons of Adam,
(which are not utterly or finally forsaken of God:) yet is not this Freedom the
same in all, neither in respect of its Objects or Acts, nor in respect of its
Degrees or Strength. Some have a Competent Measure of Liberty to avoid
Occasions or external Motives to known sins; but either no portion of like
Liberty, or a very Little One, to resist such temptations to foul sins, as come
upon them unexpectedly. Others have a Competent Measure of like Freedom to
resist Temptations or Opportunities to gross sins, but little or none at all
to bewail their natural misery, or to beat down their inbred Pride by
Contemplation of Sin Original, or by Reflecting upon sins of Omission, or
Positive Acts of ordinary Transgression. Others again which had deprived
themselves of all Freedom for avoiding Occasions, or resisting Temptations to
certain sins; have a Larger measure of Freedom then others have, to be humbled
under Gods Mighty Hand; which is in Order the First, and by disposition of the
Divine Providence, the most Available means for attaining Mortification; which
must be the Subject of the next Discourse; wherein I must follow my Method
proposed, to wit; To discuss the true meaning of those Scriptures wherein the
Difficulties or Questions Concerning this Duty are properly seated. To begin
with that of our Apostle, Rom, 8. 12.

SECT. V.
Of the Great Duty of Mortification: And of the Use of Free Will for performing
it.
CHAP. XXVIII.
Of the General Contents which concern the Duty of Mortification: And which be
the Special Works of the Flesh we are to Mortify.
ROMANS Chap. 8. Verse. 11. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the
dead, dwell in you: he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken
your mortal bodies, by his spirit that dwells in you. Verse. 12. Therefore
Brethren, we are Debtors; not to the Flesh, to live after the Flesh. Verse. 13.
For if ye Live after the Flesh, ye shall dye: but if ye through the spirit do
Mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
1. A brief Paraphrase upon Romans 8. 12, etc.
THis Portion of Scripture is more fit to ground the Connection of what goes
before or comes after it, from the beginning of this 8th Chapter unto the end,
then to receive any Bounds or Limitation which it is capable of, from any
Reference to other Passages, either for the plain and full Grammatical, or for
the Moral and Theological Sense. The Grammatical Construction of the 12th verse
(though for so much as some of our Modern Translations suggest unto us, it
afford but One Proposition, and that a Negative, [We are debtors not to the
flesh:] yet) according to the Original Character or full Construction, it
contains Two Emphatical Propositions, the One Affirmative, the Other Negative.
The Affirmative (...), Debtors we are; and Debtors for a greater Sum, then all
Mankinds either Real or Personal Estates in this world are able to discharge.
The Negative, Debtors we are in no wise either in whole or part unto the Flesh,
unto which we owe nothing besides Revenge or Mortification of It, that is, by
delivering it up Captive to the Spirit, unto whom we owe more then our temporal
Estate here on Earth, our very Souls. The (...) or full Declaration of both
Propositions follows, verse. 13. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die:
this is the unsupportable debt which the flesh has brought and seeks to bring
upon us: But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
shall Live for ever. This is a greater Boon then we can deserve; as much as we
can desire; more then we can make any part of requital for it.

2. For stating Cases of Conscience (not for dealing betwixt man and man, but)
but betwixt the Judge of Quick and Dead, and our own Souls, I know no portion
of Scripture whether in the Old or New Testament of better or more frequent Use
then This 13th verse. Let such as are so minded maintain Tenants already set on
Foot, or multiply Questions to the worlds End about the Certainty of their
Personal Estate in Grace, or Final Salvation, or bestow their Marks and Tokens
whether of Absolute Election or Reprobation as they please: yet unto honest
hearted Christians, or such as desire so to be, there can be no Sign or token
of Salvation either Firmer in its self, or more Certain to them, then the right
Computation of their constant Progress in the Mortifying of the Flesh by the
Spirit.

The First Question or Examination of our Progress in this Duty, is to know;
[What be the deeds of the Flesh or Body, which we are to Mortify; And, How far
we are to mortify them?]

The Second; [How the flesh is Mortified by us; How by the Spirit?]

The Third, which happily will intermingle it self here and there with the
first and second Quaeries, is, [The Limitation of these Two Propositions: If ye
live after the flesh, ye shall die: But if ye through the spirit do Mortify
the deeds of the body, ye shall live.]

3. Touching the First Point, [What be the deeds of the Flesh or Body, which we
are to Mortify:] They are set down by our Apostle, Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Now the
works of the Flesh are manifest, which are these, Adultery, Fornication,
Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred Variance, Emulations,
Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envyings, Murders, Drunkenness, Revellings,
and such like. This word, Flesh, sometimes signifies our Bodily substance;
sometimes, our Corrupted Nature.
It shall suffice by the way to note in a word that the Flesh or Body is
sometimes taken for the Fleshly Nature or Bodily Substance it self: Sometimes
for the Corruption of the Flesh or of Nature corrupted. And in this Later Sense
it is to be taken in This Place.

4. That we may the better understand this Duty of Mortification by Sounding
the Bottom of it, we are in the first place to take it into serious
Consideration. That the words by which our Apostle here expresses the Works or
Deeds of the Flesh, are not to be measured according to that Carnal Conceit or
Gross Sense, which the Flesh it self always partial for it self, is ready to
suggest; but according to the Scale of the Sanctuary. When He says, Adultery,
Fornication, etc. are the works of the Flesh, we must not understand Only those
Acts of Adultery or Fornication, which come under the Cognizance or Censure of
Courts, Civil, or Ecclesiastic; not the Fruits or Blossoms; But The very
First Seeds of these Sins; all Inclinations of the Flesh or Secret desires of
the heart, of this Kind. This Art or Method of measuring these words, or the
sins comprehended under them, our Savior has taught us, Mat. 5. 27, 28. Ye
have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shall not Commit
Adultery: But I say unto you, that whosoever looks on a Woman to Lust after
her, has committed Adultery with her already in his Heart. When he reckons
Lasciviiousness amongst the works of the Flesh, we must not restrain this word
to Actual Lasciviousness, or Lascivousnesse in attempt: We are to extend it to
every Degree of this sin in Word or Thought; to every Motion of the Tongue, of
our Heart, or Senses, by which either the Ears or Senses of others, or our own
Souls or Consciences may be polluted. When he says, Idolatry is a work of the
Flesh, we must not take Idolatry only for the Visible or External Act of
Adoration proffered either to Creatures or their Images: It comprehends All
inordinate Affection of the heart to any Creature. For to love Money more then
God, then our Neighbors, or more then Equity or just dealing, is a Branch of
the Idolatry here mentioned by our Apostle. For so he interprets himself, Ephesians.
5. 5. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor Covetous
man who is an Idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of
God. Again, when he reckons Murder amongst the Works of the Flesh, We must not
measure This Monster only by such Pictures of it, as are drawn in Blood: For
even Hatred, Wrath, Strife, and Sedition, are true Lineaments or live Limbs of
this Giant. Ye have heard (says our Savior) it was said by them of Old Time,
thou shall not kill, and whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the
Judgment: But I say unto you, That whosever is angry with his Brother without a
cause, shall be in danger of the Judgment: And whosoever shall say to his
Brother Racha, shall be in danger of the Council: But whosoever shall say, Thou
Fool, shall be in danger of Hell fire. Mat. 5. 21, 22. Lastly we are not to
take the works of the Flesh (albeit we take them in the grossest sense) for
those Acts, Habits, or Accustomances only, which are seated in the Flesh or
Bodily part of man, but for those Acts or Inclinations which are accomplished
in the Operations or Exercises of the Reasonable Soul. For if we mark the
Apostles Words; not Witchcraft and Idolatry only, which are usually
accomplished in some External or Bodily Act, but even Heresy it self is
expressly mentioned amongst the works of the Flesh: and yet is Heresy the
proper Offspring of the supreme Faculty of the Humane Soul, that is, of the
Intellective Faculty or Understanding. The most dangerous Heretics have been
always men of great understanding, and for wit, acute and subtle. Nor are we
to restrain this word Heresy to professed Opinions, or Errors expressedly
maintained or subscribed unto. We are to extend the Apostles meaning unto the
First Seeds or Roots of this sin, as to Emulation, to Affectation of applause,
to Secret pride of heart, or hearty desire of Vain Glory or Excelling others.
These are the General Seeds of the most Gross Sins here mentioned. And
therefore our Apostle in the Conclusion of this 5th Chapter to the Galatians,
strikes at the very Root: Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one
another, envying one another. If we harbor these or the like desires, though
secretly in our breasts, they will, as Opportunity serves, betray us to the
Grossest Sins here mentioned, as to Murder, to Heresy, or the like. Now not
of these grossest sins only, as Murder, Adultery, Heresy, or Idolatry; but of
their First Seeds or Roots, our Apostle fore-warnes these Galatians, as he had
done in times past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
Kingdom of God, Gal. 5. 21. And who then shall Inherit this Kingdom? For who is
he that is not subject to some one or other of these Mis-demeanours or perverse
Inclinations? who is he that does not either consent to unlawful Lust, or
entertain desires of Applause or of Excelling others, or does not often either
Envy or Emulate his Equals, or Betters? True it is, that no man can say, His
Heart is Clean in respect of these Acts, or inclinations unto them. Shall no
man therefore (seeing no man is altogether Free from these) Enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven? God forbid. It is one thing to Do such things according to
the ordinary Use and construction of this Phrase in our vulgar Language;
another thing to be a Doer of Them, or to make these Misdoings the chiefest of
our Doings, which is the meaning of the Holy Ghost in this and like Sayings. So
when it is said, He that does sin is the Servant of sin: the meaning is, He
that is a Doer of that which is sinful, is the servant of sin: But so is not
every one that sins, for there is no man which sins not. It is well
observed by Maldonate the Jesuit, that this word, to Do in the Hebrew Dialect,
includes not the present Act or Operation only, but the Habit or Custom of
Doing. There is no man which sometimes Does not some of the works here
mentioned by our Apostle. And yet there is No Man which has Mortified the
Flesh, or seriously intends this work of Mortification, that Habitually or
customarily Does Any of The Works by him mentioned. But this Point will come
more fitly to be handled in discussing the Second Branch or Member of the First
of our Three General Enquiries, propounded in the fore part of This Chapter,
which was, [Concerning the Extent of this Precept or Duty; or how far we are
to Mortify the Deeds of the Body that we may Live.]

CHAP. XXIX.
How far the Duty of Mortification is Universal; How far Indefinite.
1. Mortification Universal in respect of men's Persons, not so in respect of
the Duty to be performed.
THe Question concerning the Extent of this Duty, is Twofold. First, it is to
be considered in Respect of the Persons whom this Duty of Mortification
concerns, Secondly, in respect of the Duty it self, or matter enjoined. Many
Propositions there be, which are Universal in respect of the Persons, and but
Indefinite in respect of the Thing it Self or matter proposed. As contrariwise,
other Propositions or Precepts there be, which are of Universal Extent in
respect of the matter proposed or Duty enjoined, and but Indefinite in respect
of the Persons whom they concern. In respect of the Matter proposed or Duty
enjoined in this Place, this Proposition is not Universal. No man is tied under
the strict Penalty of damnation to an Universal or Total Mortification of the
Flesh. Unto a Mortification of all the Deeds of the Flesh Every man is bound;
But not to a Total Mortification of every Work of the Flesh in respect of All
the Degrees of it; for so, no Flesh should be saved. But of the Limitation of
this Proposition in respect of the Duty it self, we shall have better occasion
to speak hereafter. In respect of the Persons which are to perform this Duty;
The Precept is Universally and absolutely true of ALL that are endued with
Reason, and are capable of instruction. ALL are bound to MORTIFY the Deeds of
the Flesh without Exception of any man's Person. Kings are as strictly bound
under pain of Damnation to perform This Duty, as the Subjects are; and subjects
as strictly bound under the same penalty, as Magistrates are: For God is no
accepter of Persons, And Gods Will which is the Rule of Faith, will not warrant
any man of what degree soever, to presume upon any Exemption from the Duty it
self; no not to hope for a Dispensation.

2. It Is a Question well moved by some Schoolmen, Ad quid teneatur homo cum
primum venerit ad usum rationis? What is the first Duty or Consideration
whereunto Every one is tied after he once come to the use of reason? Their
Answer for the most part is not so pertinent or satisfactory, Vid. Victor.
Relect. 13. page 642, etc.
as the Question is useful.
And no place of Scripture affords a fitter Answer to the Question proposed,
then these words of S. Paul do. For seeing (as He says) the works of the Flesh
are manifest, and (as we may add) in a manner Evident to Every man's Sense:
Every one when he first comes to the use of Reason, may with more Facility or
less Observation apprehend the truth and necessity of This Duty, then he can
do many other Precepts of life which in their rank and order are necessary
likewise unto Salvation. No point of Belief is more Evident or sensible to the
natural man, then the Corruption or imperfection of his nature. Some mere
naturalists (such I mean as knew no other Article of Christian Faith) have
delivered their minds in a manner Orthodoxally concerning this point, to wit,
About The General Deficiency or imperfection of Nature in Man. No Christian man
which sees thus much, but sees withal the Enemies against whom he is to fight;
and may from Experiments in himself answerable to this Rule of our Apostle,
perceive a Necessity laid upon him, either of killing them, or of being killed
by them. Besides the apprehension of this Necessity (which ordinarily inspires
Cowards with Valor) Every Christian stands engaged by SOLEMN Vow made in
Baptism, to undertake this Fight. For the First Branch of THAT TRIPLE Vow, is
To forsake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked
World, and all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh. The duty of Mortification here
enjoined consists in the Performance of this Part of our Vow. And seeing this
is the first Service unto which we are engaged by that Solemn Vow; the Answer
to the Question proposed by the Schoolmen must be this: The First Duty
whereunto every man is tied when he comes to the use of Reason, is, the
Consideration of this Duty, and the undertaking of Christ's Battle against the
Devil, the World, and the Flesh. The First March or progress, or rather the
first Preparation to this Battle, is, the serious Apprehension of the Necessity
of Mortification.

3. Howbeit even This Preparation is, though not directly or in express Terms,
yet by necessary Consequence or in Effect, denied by the Romish Church, and by
some others who have professed themselves Members of the present English
Church. For, All they in Effect deny or gainsay the Necessity or Universality
of this Duty, who teach, that Original Sin is utterly taken away, or that our
Regeneration is instantly and fully wrought by the Sacrament of Baptism. That
Children rightly Baptized are truly regenerated by the Spirit of God, we deny
not. And in Case being so Baptized they die before they come to the use of
Reason or apprehension of This Duty here enjoined, yet ought we not to doubt of
their Salvation, because they have been Baptized, and by Baptism made partakers
of Regeneration in such a Measure as is requisite and sufficient to their
Salvation whilst they are Infants. But that Original sin, the Lusts of the
Flesh, or the Old Man should be utterly extinguished or killed in them before
their Death, we must deny; Otherwise we shall Contradict our Apostle in this
place, and overthrow the Foundation or Ground whereupon this Precept, or the
Necessity of this Duty, is built. Now the Ground or Foundation of this Duty is
this: That All men unto whom this Precept is directed (and directed it is to
ALL that are Capable of his meaning) have sundry deeds of the Flesh, sundry
Relics of the Old Man in them. And if either Original sin, the Relics of
the Old Man, or Lusts of the flesh, be to be Mortified in All, when they first
come to the use of Reason: they could not be utterly abolished or dead before.
For to kill or Mortify that which is already dead or without all sense or
motion, is impossible.

4. Original sin not utterly extinguished by Baptism.
If Original sin, or the Old Man with his members be utterly extinguished in
young Infants by Baptism; I demand, how possibly they could revive in the same
Parties after they have put off Infancy or Childhood, or as soon as they come
to the use of Reason. For these being killed or extinguished before, they
cannot revive themselves. Or if children by Baptism were restored unto that
State of Innocence which our Parents once had: this Innocence could not be lost
without some Actual Transgression, like unto that transgression, by which our
First Parents lost their Innocence or Justice Original. Actually to transgress
after the similitude of Adam, Infants, whilst Infants, cannot. For such
Transgression consists in a sinister choice of the Will; or in the ill use of
Reason. And all ill Use of the Will or understanding, presupposes an Use of
Reason, which cannot be in Infants. Again, there is no Necessity, that all
Children should actually transgress when they first come to the use of Reason,
if before that time they had been Freed from all Original Corruption or
Relics of the Old Man by Baptism. For to lay a Necessity of sinning actually,
upon any that had been Freed from all Original sin, or restored to the state of
Innocence which Adam had, were to make God the Author of such Actual Sin. Adam
himself did not actually sin upon any Necessity, but Voluntarily and Freely. If
the First Sin had not been an Actual sin; or if that Actual sin had been
committed upon Necessity: not Adam, but God had been the Author of it. Certain
then it is, that This Duty of Mortification is necessary in respect of ALL,
without any respect of Persons.
Every one at their first Arrival unto the Use of Reason or at their Passage
out of Infancy into Youth, are under This Yoke, which is no Evangelical
Counsel, but a Peremptory Precept. And if This Duty necessarily concern ALL at
that time: ALL must of necessity have Original sin or some Relics of the Old
man in them, yea such strong Relics as will impell them to some Actual Sin or
other, or to some transgression of some of Gods Commandments, when they come
unto the Use of Reason; Otherwise This Duty or precept could not Universally
concern ALL without Exception. For by the Contrary Doctrine, some at least,
when they first come to the Use of Reason, should have no Deeds of the Flesh,
which they were bound to Mortify. Most of the Romans unto whom our Apostle
here writes, had been Baptized after they had come to years of discretion. And
Baptism without all question had been as Effectual in them, as it has been in
any other since: yet our Apostle supposes some Deeds of the Flesh to be in ALL
of them, (Even in such as had lateliest been washed in the Laver of
Regeneration) which were to be Mortified in them. So that Baptism is rather a
Sacramental Consecration of us to undertake this Flight with the works of our
Flesh, or corruption of our nature, then an utter Extinction or absolute
drowning of these Enemies.

5. Another necessary Corollary or Consequence of this Doctrine there is, not
usually observed by Modern Controversors; and it is This: [That the same
measure of Regeneration which suffices Children or Infants dying before they
come to the use of Reason, will not suffice such as attain to the use of
Reason, or years of discretion.] For if it did or could, they might be saved as
Infants are, without performance of this Duty of Mortification. One of these
Two must necessarily be granted, as Either, that Children or Infants are not so
thoroughly sanctified or regenerated as is necessary to Salvation, before the
hour of their death, (which no man to my remembrance has taught:) Or else, he
that affirms them to be truly regenerated or sanctified in their Infancy, must
yield to us in This; That such Children or Infants as have been formerly
regenerated in a measure sufficient to their Salvation, out-grow this measure
of Regeneration or Sanctification after they come to the use of Reason or years
of discretion, as they do their apparel or clothes which were fit for them
whilst they were Infants. And no question but the Old Man, after we come to
the use of Reason, grows stronger and stronger in all of us, until we abate
his strength, and Mortify his members by the Spirit. Wherefore, Leaving
Children or infants unto the Spirit of God alone who does Regenerate them by
Baptism, and preserve them in the State of Grace, without our Ministry of
Preaching; This Precept is a Precept of Working Faith: The Duty here enjoined
is a Duty Necessary unto All that are of years fit to be instructed, or of
Capacity to understand the Scripture or Rule of Faith expounded to them. Let us
then take his words into a Second Consideration. If ye live after the flesh, Of
the Nature of the Fight with our own Bodies in General.
ye shall die. He says not; If ye have lived after the flesh, ye shall die:
for this had been rather a certain Prognostic of death, then any medicinal
Advice or Prescript unto his Patients. One man there was (and no more) who was
First Good and afterward Bad: this was the First Adam, Another there is (and
no more) who was Never Bad, always Good: this is the Second Adam, Christ Jesus
blessed for ever. Of all the rest, that is most true, which a Father has, Nemo
unquam bonus, qui non ante fuit malus; No son of Adam ever proved Good, who was
not sometimes Bad. The Apostles Saying is in this Case true: First is that
which is natural, then that which is spiritual, We, Even the Elect themselves,
were the sons of Adam, before they were the Sons of God in Christ. All or most
have lived after the Flesh, before they come to live after the Spirit. Thus
much our Apostles Second Proposition will infer: If ye though the spirit do
mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall Live. Inasmuch as Mortification of the
Flesh is necessary to All: it is presupposed that All have a Flesh which may be
Mortified, or a Life of the flesh; seeing nothing can be Mortified, but that
which has Life in it.

6. Again, Our Apostle says not, If the Deeds of the Flesh be Mortified in you
by the Spirit, ye shall Live. For so we might happily have dreamed of a
Mortification already wrought in us, or to be wrought in us without our Consent
or Endeavors, as well whilst we are asleep as whilst we are awaking; Or we
might conceive it to have been so wrought by the Spirit in our Cradles, as we
might presume to pass the time of our youth in play and pastime; Or we might
hope to have it so fully accomplished by the same Spirit alone, in our youth or
maturity, as we might spend our Old Age in sleep, without setting a Careful
Watch over our Works or thoughts. His words, if we observe them, are thus: If
ye through the Spirit do Mortify the Deeds of the Flesh ye shall Live. So then
we see, The Flesh must be Mortified, and Mortified it must be By Us: Every man
must Mortify his own Flesh, although he cannot Mortify it, but through the
Spirit. It is The Spirit alone which gives Victory: yet this does not
Privilege us from being his Soldiers. It is The Spirit of God, which works in
us The Will and the Deed: yet this does not License us to be Idle. Fight we
must, not with our own shadows, but Every man with his own Body; not with a
Body already dead or Mortified, but a living Active Body, that may be
Mortified. And this disadvantage we have, that our Adversaries are got within
us before we are aware of them; so that we cannot fetch such fierce blows at
them, as may kill them at once, or as we say, out of hand. Sometimes our
Adversary lies so close, that we can hardly hurt him without danger of hurting
our selves: As some by offering too much violence to their bodies, have
ensnared their own souls. But this is no Usual Fault of this Age, or of this
Nation.

7. Howbeit, for the Reasons specified and the like, It is not so in this
Combat (which Every man must entertain between himself, and his own Flesh; or
between his Spirit, and his Body:) as it is in Duels, or single Combats, In
quibus aut cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta; in which, one half hour brings
forth either certain death or certain victory to the Combatant: Nor as it is in
pitched Battles, in which, one day is the making or marring of whole Nations or
mighty Kingdoms which have been many years in growing. This our Warfare is like
unto a strait and Lingering Siege, in which Patience and perpetual Vigilance are
no less requisite then present Valor or strength of Arms, especially on the
behalf of the party besieged. Animus uniuscujusque est unusquisque: Every man's
Soul is Himself. And every man's Soul is more strictly begirt and environed by
his Body, then any City can be by any Army. The Gates of his Senses are always
open to let in such Objects or Temptations as take part with the Flesh. Herein
This war with our souls is unlike unto Ordinary Sieges; in that the party
besieged may sooner starve or bring under the Party besieging, then be starved
or brought under by him, so the besieged will be watchful. Let us take into our
Consideration what One of the most Expert Soldiers in this kind, which ever
fought under Christ's Banner (one that had a long time served in both Camps,
first fighting stoutly for the Body or Flesh, and afterward more victoriously
for the Spirit) has left registered for our Instruction: So fight I, not as one
that beats the air: But I keep under my Body, and bring it into subjection:
lest that by any means when I have Preached to others, I my self should be a
Castaway, 1 Cor. 9. 26. If so stout a Champion after so many years Service in
the Camp of Christ, was not secure of the Adversary which he carried about with
him: how dare some Fresh-water-souldiers say (or what truth is there in their
sayings) That they have made full Conquest of their Adversary, It will be
useful for the Reader to Know, that if he please he may read more about This
Subject of Mortification (either now, immediately before he proceed to the 30
Chapter, or after the reading of the 35 Chapter; or of this whole 5 Section:)
in the Appendix, at the end of this Book. In which, The Third General Inquiry
Proposed, Chap. 28. 2. [Touching the Limitation of the Two Propositions, If ye
live after the Flesh ye shall die. If ye -- mortify -- ye shall live.] And
promised Chap. 35. 10. is handled.
and are most most certain of their own Salvation, before they know what
Certainty means, Or which be the Several Branches of it. But of this Point, if
God permit, elsewhere.

CHAP. XXX.
Containing the true Rule for examining our Persuasions concerning our Estate
in Grace.
1. Our Progress in Mortifying Our Selves, the best Rule for knowing our
Estate.
IN the mean time it will not be amiss for every man to Examine himself by This
Rule of our Apostle, concerning the First Branch of Certainty, that is, a Moral
Certainty or strong Probability that he is in the State of Grace or
Regeneration. If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; This is the Rule. Does
any man amongst us Spend most of his time in revelling or drinking, in strife
or variance, or in jest or merriment? If such a man have any seeds of Faith,
though Moral, it will assure him for the Present, that he cannot be so much as
Morally Certain of his Regeneration. The best Advice which for the time being
can be given him, is, so to mingle his Hope with Fear, as that Fear be
Predominant. If otherwise his Hope in this case shall bear down Fear, or be not
born down by it, there is no other likely hood but that his Hope will grow into
stiff Presumption; and stiff Presumption will exclude Repentance, on which
Hope, if it be sure, must always be grounded.

2. But most men's Consciences perhaps can truly tell themselves, that they do
Mortify the Deeds of the Body. Here is Just ground of Hope and Moral
Certainty, if this Testimony of the Conscience be sincere. Howbeit even here
again, is place for Advice. And the best Advice that I can give to any in this
Case is, that he do not seek to Buy with one Weight and Sell with another, but
plant his Hopes and displant his Fear by One and the same Rule or Line. The
Rule for the planting Hope and preventing Despair is this: When our Apostle
says, Gal. 5. 21. He that does such things (any works of the Flesh by him
there mentioned) shall not inherit the Kingdom of God: we are to take the Value
or weight of This Word [DOTH] not by the present Acts or Operations, but from
the Usual Practice, Habit or Custom of doing them* Continual approved
Practice, of the least sins there named by him, excludes from Grace. This is
the Weight or Scale by which men are willing to sell, or to put off Fear or
Despair: But they must remember withal to be as ready to Buy with the same
Weight; that is, as ready to measure their Hopes or entertain the Certainty of
their Estate in Grace, by the same Scale. The Apostle says: If ye mortify the
deeds of the body, ye shall live. From This General Proposition Most Hearers of
the Word will be ready to Assume: But I (God be thanked) do mortify the Deeds
of the Body by diligent hearing the word Preached, by frequent receiving of the
Sacrament: Ergo, I shall live. But here we are to consider, that as other words
implying Action, so this word [I do Mortifie] in the Language of the Holy Ghost
(specially in those places whereto Gods promises are annexed) is not to be
restrained to the Interposed Acts or interrupted Operations of the Spirit, but
directly imports the Habit, the Custom, or assiduous Practice of
Mortification. If in This Sense we Do mortify the Deeds of the Body; that is
if we make This Work the Chief of our Doings; if most of our Care and Industry
be addressed to the perfecting of this Work: then our Assumption or minor
Proposition is Good; and the Conclusion will follow, if not Certitudine Fidei,
by the Certainty or Full Assurance of Faith, yet by Certain^y more then Moral;
by an Assurance of Hope. But if we Mortify the Deeds of the Body only Now and
Then, or by Fits; Or if we intend this work but slightly, or (as it were) upon
the By: Then our former Assumption [I do mortify the deeds of the Body,] is
Impertinent, and will sooner bring forth Presumption, then any Assurance of
Hope or Moral Certainty of our Estate in Grace. For Conclusion of this Point;
Let every one of us take heed not to measure our Hopes of Regeneration, or
Degrees of Mortification, by our readiness or desire to hear the Word
Preached, until we have examined our selves; Whether This Desire in us be a
Desire of the Spirit, or of the Flesh? Or, Whether it proceed from True
Religion, or from Humor or Fashion of the place? Certainly, if this desire in
many, were from the spirit, or from true Religion, it would be more Uniform,
and like it self in the Practice; They would be as ready, at least in some good
Measure or Proportion, to frequent Public Prayers, as to go often unto Public
Sermons. For the Faith of Christ can be had no more With Respect of Christian
Duties, than With Respect or Persons. And the same Authority whether Divine,
or Humane or Ecclesiastic from it derived, which injoynes us to hear The Word
Preached, does more strictly enjoin us to frequent Public Prayers, specially
in seasons wherein we are specially required by Authority to thank God for our
manifold deliverances from the Messengers of his wrath. But from what cause
soever our desire of hearing the word Preached proceeds: Our backwardness in
frequenting public Prayers, without all doubt, arises from some works of the
Flesh, or Relics of the Old man which must be Crucified.

3. They that are Christ's (says our Apostle Gal. 5. 2^.) have crucified the
flesh with the affections and Lusts. Take we heed, that none of us argue thus;
I am Christ's: therefore I have crucified the Flesh with the Affections and
Lusts. The Apostles meaning is, that the safest way for us to know whether we
be Christ's or no, is from this Experiment within our selves, if We have
crucified the flesh with the affections and Lusts. But what does he mean when
he says [The Affections and lusts must be Crucified?] Does he require an utter
Extinction or Total Mortification or absolute death of all carnal Affections
and Passions, before we can be assured that we are Christ's? No. Such a Total
Mortification cannot be hoped for in this Life. We are said to be Crucified to
the world, or to have the Flesh with the Affections Crucified in us, First, By
Profession or Consecration: So all that are Baptized into Christ Jesus, are
said to be Dead to Sin, yea to be Buried with him by Baptism. Rom 6. 2. 4.
Secondly, we are said to be Crucified unto the world, or to be Mortified to the
Flesh, not by Profession only, or Resolution, but by Practice: and this
Crucifying or Mortification admits of many Degrees.

4. Mortification and Crucifying, Terms not ^^divisible, but of Large Extent.
Crucifying taken in its proper Sense was a most Lingering kind of Death or
Torture. And men were said to be crucified from the very First Moment of their
nayling to the Cross, albeit the conflicts betwixt life and death were many and
strong for diverse hours after. Now it is not to be expected that any of us
will be as eager or violent in Crucifying our own Flesh, as the Jews were in
crucifying our Savior. Seeing the Party to be crucified in us is Part of Our
Selves, we cannot but use it more mildly and gently, then the Romans did such
as they crucified for Malefactors; whom they would not so violently have
handled, unless they had first adjudged them for no members, or but for rotten
and putrified members of their Body Civil. The less violent the conflict is
between the Spirit, and the Flesh, or between the Old Man, and the New, the
longer will the Old man live in us; the more frequent and sensible his motions
will be. And finally, as he was born with us: so he will die with us; hardly
before us. Yet may we be truly said to have Crucified the Old Man with the
Affections and lusts, from the very First Time, wherein we begun to nayl them
to the Cross of Christ; if so we still watch them, and seek to quell their
Motions by the Spirit. They are daily crucified by Gods Children, and yet are
daily reviving.

5. As often as we receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist with due Preparation:
Every remembrance or Meditation of Christ's Death upon the Cross, if it be
wrought or managed by the spirit, will be as the fastening of A New Nayl into
the Old Man or Body of Sin, which we carry about with us. We cannot think of
Christ's Death, or of the Causes of his Crucifying aright* but every thought
will be a degree of weakening or enfeebling the Old Man, whom we must by this
and the like means daily weaken, otherwise he will be our Destruction.

CHAP. XXXI.
How the Flesh is Mortified by Us; How by the Spirit?
This was the Second General, Propounded Chapt. 28. And the parts of This
Inquiry be Three: First, In what Sense WE, whom this Duty concerns, can be said
to Mortify the Deeds of the Body?

The Second. By what Spirit we are to Mortify them: By the Spirit of God, by
our own Spirit, or by Both?

The Third: The Manner and Order of The Spirits Working or of our Working by
the Spirit.

1. Seeing to Mortify implies an Action How Man can Mortify his Flesh.
THe First Point is most Material, and of most use in respect of Modern
Controversors. If Mortification be (as I think none upon better Consideration
will deny) a True Part of our Conversion, How can We be said to Mortify the
Body or Flesh, unless we may be said to Convert Our Selves; which is a
Doctrine that Few will like of, as being prejudiced by Contrary Tenants much
embraced by men, deservedly well approved of by all or most Reformed Churches.
For Resolution of this Doubt, we are in the First place to consider; That
Regeneration, Conversion, or Mortification are Terms in their proper Nature
Indefinite, and so used by the Holy Ghost. The Actions or Qualifications
comprehended, especially under Conversion and Mortification, are not of one
Rank. There is a Conversion Spiritual, and a Conversion, or, Mortification
Spiritual and Moral. See the Note at the end of this Section: or of Chap. 36.
Conversion only Moral: There is a Mortification likewise either merely
Conversion, or, Mortification Spiritual and Moral. See the Note at the end of
this Section: or of Chap. 36.
Moral, or truly Spiritual. The matter signified or imported by these words,
Mortification and Conversion, whether Moral or Spiritual, is not Indivisible.
Whence it is, that we often deceive our selves and others, by giving one and
the same Answer to All or Most Questions that are or can be moved concerning
these Duties. That may be true of Mortification or Conversion (whether
spiritual or moral) taking it in some Degree, which is altogether false if we
apply it to the same Qualification or Duty taken or considered according to
another Degree. Thus much they better saw then considered, who have entertained
Dispute Pro or Con in that Question. [An Homo in prima Conversione ad Deum sit
mere Passivus? Whether man in his first Conversion be merely passive?] The
Issue would be easier, shorter, and more certain, if the same Question were
proposed thus [An Homo quoad Primum Gradum Conversionis sit mere Passivus?
Whether man be merely Passive in the first Degree or Degrees of his Conversion
or Mortification?] For mine own part as I acknowledge many Degrees of
Conversion, and many precedent Motions to true and complete Mortification; So I
should think the most men Living, that are thoroughly Converted and truly
mortified, to be Merely Passive, not in the First, Second, or Third Degree
only, but in All or most of the intermediate Degrees of Mortification, which
are precedent to the Habit of it, or rather to the Gift of Perseverance in it:
And being once Habitually Mortified, we are in a sort Active.

2. But if in the First, Second, or Subsequent Degrees of Mortification we be
merely Passive: How shall we avoid That Imputation which is laid upon our
Church by the Romanists? The Imputation is This: [That albeit we grant men to
be Mortified, and require the Duty of Mortification at men's hands: yet we
acknowledge them not to be Men, but mere Stocks in the Acts or Interims of
their Conversion or Mortification.] To this we answer; That although we be
merely Passive in the Acts of Mortification: yet are we not Passive after the
same manner, that Stocks and Stones, or Creatures merely Sensitive, are
Passive. Nor are Creatures endued with sense, Passive after the same manner,
that stocks and stones or creatures without sense, are. There be Passives
inanimate, Passives sensitive, and reasonable Passives or Patients. Every
Faculty of Sense is merely Passive in respect of its proper. Function or
Sensation: And yet the ignoblest Faculties of sense are in some sort Active,
that they may be sensitively Passive, or passive after another manner, than
stocks and stones or things inanimate, are. The Sense of Touching, which of all
the five External Senses is most ignoble and least Active, may not withstanding
be less Passive, or more or less capable of pain, by the Activitie or motion
of the body. But of the more Noble Senses the Maxim is most true; Sentire est
pati; All Sensation is a kind of Passion or suffering. And it is generally
resolved in Schools that, Visio fit intromittendo, non extramittendo; Sight or
Vision (although it be the most Noble external Sense) is not made by
Extramission or sending out of the Rays or beams of the Eye, but by
Impression of the Object seen: and Impression is a Passion. So that Sight it
self consists in Passion; and the Eye it self in respect of its proper
Function, is merely Passive: and yet he that will see the Sun or other Objects
Visible, must be content to open his eyes, not to wink; yet to wink or open the
eyes is no Passion, but an Action. He that desires to see Objects obscure or
less Visible, must Intend the Optic Nerves, otherwise he shall not be
sensitively Passive. In what sense we are said to be Passives in our Conversion.
And He that desires to hear well, especially if he be afar off, must be
content to Listen: and Listening includes an Intension of the Organ or
Instrument of hearing, an Action in the Hearer, that he may be sensitively
Passive. He that speaks, is the Agent or Actor: And yet how pleasant soever his
speech be, the Hearer must be Active to find him Ears. Now Faith is as the
Eyesight of the Soul and understanding; and yet Faith (as the Apostle says)
comes by hearing. Our Mortification, or Conversion, which is a work of Faith,
is never wrought without some sense or feeling. And in these works, if they be
spiritually performed, the Spirit of man is as merely Passive, as the bodily
Eye is in the sense of Sight, or the Ear in the Act of Hearing; But merely
Passive after a more remarkable manner in the First Degrees of Mortification or
Conversion, than in their Accomplishment. The Resolution then of the former
doubt, is This: We are merely Passive in the Degrees or works of Mortification
or Conversion: We are not merely Passive; we must be Active in some works, by
the Providence of God presupposed for accomplishment of these works, or for his
accomplishing these works in us by the Spirit.

3. For Illustration of that which in this Point may be easily conceived by
all, without offense (as I hope) to any, We will take for Instance or Example,
a man whose heart has never found any internal Comfort of the Spirit, a
Despiser of the Means which lead to Grace: A Young Man Every way as
dissolutely Bent, as his years and Experience will permit him. This man upon
some Loathsome Concomitants which follow riot, or upon some grievous mischance
that has befalne him or his Friend in an unruly place upon the Lord's Day,
abjures the like place and Company for a while: And being not able or
unaccustomed to be alone, resolves to make trial whether he shall speed better
by repairing at times seasonable unto the Lords House. In thus resolveing and
in thus repairing to the Church, he is not merely Passive, but an Active. This
is no Work of true Faith, no Degree of true Conversion or Mortification
spiritual; yet a Motion by Gods Providence presupposed or rather prerequired to
his future Regeneration or Conversion. He is Active Likewise in Lending his
Ears with some tolerable attention, unto the Preacher. The Theme whereupon the
Preacher (without any notice of this Parties Dispositions or Occasions) does
insist, we will suppose to be that portion of scripture which was the means of
St. Austins first Conversion to Christianity, without any choice made by Him,
but presenting it self (in respect of his present thoughts or purpose) by mere
Chance. The Theme which first wrought his Conversion, as he himself in His
Confessions acknowledges, Confess: 8. lib. 12. Cap.
was Romans 13. 13. 14. Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in Ryoting and
Drunkenness, not in Chambering and Wantonness, not in strife and Envying: But
put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to
fulfill the Lusts thereof. A discreet methodical application of such Doctrines
as this Text affords, would much move any dissolute Young-Mans heart, which had
been impelled or drawn upon the former presupposed Occasions, to hear these
Words opened or discoursed upon without his choice and beyond his Aim or
expectation. And in this supposed Motion or relenting of his heart and
Conscience, the Party moved is a mere Passive. In thus fitting the discourse
to his former Life or Cogitations, the Preacher himself is Gods Instrument, not
the Agent. He had no Suffrage in the choice of his Text, at least in suiting it
to this Particular Occasion, much less any hand or finger in the Issue or
Success: Both these are wholly from the disposition of Divine Providence.

4. But now that the Parties Heart is touched by these or the like Occurrences,
unexpected either by this Patient or by his physician, does he still remain as
merely Passive as he was, in the accomplishment of his Mortification or
Conversion? Surely the thoughts of a mere Natural Civil or Moral man, are Free
and Able to Reflect upon those Motions in respect of whose Production his best
Faculties are merely passive; Free and able to Revise and work upon those
Occurrences and Dispositions of divine Providence, on which he did not so much
as think, before they set his thoughts on working. But supposing him to be thus
Able, thus Free and willing to Reflect upon his former thoughts, and to Revise
what lately has befallen him; Are such Reflections able (without Gods Special
Grace infused) to produce any further Degree of Mortification or Conversion?
Men must be in some sort Active, that They may be Towardly Passive in the work
of Mortification.
Or is the Party thus affected merely Passive, or a Co-agent with the Spirit
of Grace in the Production of such farther Degrees of Mortification, as shall
after wards be produced? He is in my Opinion a mere Passive in the Production
of all Degrees which shall be produced, until his Conversion or Mortification
shall be accomplished. Are then such Reflections upon his former ways, or
Revises of what has befallen him for them, to no purpose? No man I think will
avouch this. But if to any, to what good purpose do they serve? shall they make
him a more Towardly Passive in the next Good Motions (which it shall please God
to put into his heart) than he was in the former? Shall he by often thinking
upon his former Courses, or by abstinence from evil Company be enabled so to
qualify his Heart, that the same or like touches of Gods Providence shall
mollify or affect it more at the Second time, than they did at the First, or
at the Third more than at the Second, or at the Fourth more than at the Third.
I know no harm, I cannot conceive the least Suspicion of danger in this or the
like Assertion, so long as we still acknowledge him to be no more then a mere
Passive, in all the Degrees of his Conversion or Mortification.

5. Notwithstanding how harmless soever this Assertion be in it self, I can
be content to relinquish the use of it, rather then any good Christian should
be offended with it, or put into doubt, lest it come too near (...) or other
modern Heres^^. But he that shall deny me the Liberty of thus Expressing my
self, shall give me leave to retain This Conclusion: [He which is diligent in
Reflecting and ruminating upon what has befallen him, by Gods Special
Providence, upon the first or second time wherein he has been impelled to take
notice of it, shall be sure to have his heart more deeply touched with the same
or like Occurrences the third or fourth time, then he which has been always
negligent to Ruminate or Reflect upon such Invitations or Admonitions, as by
Gods Providence have been rendered unto him.] In respect of our Purpose (which
is only to leave sloth or negligence without Excuse) it is all One, whether a
man after the First Degree of Mortification, may Positively and actually
Concur to make himself A more Towardly Passive, against the next Touch of
Grace or Document of Gods Special Providence; or whether, his Heart remaining
still at the same Passive Bent which it had when it was first touched by Grace
or special Call of Gods providence, God be pleased to multiply the Active
Means of Mortification or to make their Contrivance and disposition more
remarkable and effectual than they were before. This is most certain, That he
which will not take such Warnings as God shall send him, into his serious
Consideration* shall bring this Twofold Inconvenience upon himself: First,
his Soul shall be every day then other more unapt to be wrought unto
Repentance, or to have Mortification wrought in it, by such Means as formerly
would have wrought it. Secondly, God in justice will deprive him of such
ordinary Means or Motives to Mortification, as before he had. Man's extreme
want of all Ability, so to prepare or mollify his own heart, as it may be
more towardly Passive than it has been, cannot disinable God from multiplying
his Flessings, or from Granting Grace Sufficient to mollify their hearts,
which are not able to mollify themselves, yet have been diligent according to
that Ability which they have, to Reflect and ruminate upon his Providence
Summoning them to Repentance; always diligent and ready to acknowledge their
own Insufficiency, and out of this acknowledgement more earnestly to solicit
his Grace and Favor for enabling them to do better.

6., In what sense we are said to work out our own Salvation.
So then man's Endeavors are not available not of force, to produce
Mortification spiritual: yet are they Two ways necessary; Necessitre
Praecepti, and Necessitate Medij, by a Necessity of Duty, and by a Necessity
of Means, that spiritual Mortification may be accomplished in us. And because
man by the assistance of Gods special Providence (without the concourse of
sanctifying inherent Grace) is enabled to do somewhat, which being done,
his conversion or Mortification shall undoubtedly be accomplished; therefore
are we said to Mortify the Body; and not so only, but to make our Election
sure; yea, to Or rather, industriously to labor for our own Salvation: (...).
work out our own Salvation. For so the Apostle speaks Philip: 2. 12. But how
are we said to work out our own Salvation? Non Formaletersed Consecutive: in
such a Sense as we say, One man's Riseing is another Fali: Or, The Ruin of one
or more great Families is the Raising of others: Or as it is said in
Philosophy, Generation unives est Corruption alterius: (i. e.) not Formally or
properly (for Generation and Corruption are Opposites) but by way of
Consequence: For inasmuch as The One is the Necessary Consequent of the Other,
The One is said to Be The Other. And thus when the Apostle wills us to work out
our own Salvation with f^ar and (...), he gives the reason in the next words;
For it is God that works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
Philip. 2. 13. So that God truly and properly Works all, as well the Will as
the Deed: yet it is his Good Pleasure to work Both only in them which work with
fear and trembling, as being most afraid to neglect so great Salvation as God
is ready to work in them, and for them. And because God never fails to work
salvation in them and for them that are diligent in seeking it, or afraid to
neglect it: therefore they are said to Work out their own Salvation, not
properly or Formally, but Consecutive: that is* Salvation is the Necessary
Consequent of their working, or does necessarily follow upon their work, Not by
any force or Efficacy of their Work, or by any natural Connection, but merely
by Gods Appointment or Decree. The very same phrase in the Original our Savior
uses unto the people, John. 6. 27. Which words can bear no other
Construction, then that which we have made of St. Paul's words Philip. 2. 12. no
other Interpretation, then our English has already made: Labor not for the
meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures unto everlasting life.
And so the Vulgar Latin does not render them verbatim, Operamini Cibum, but
Operamini Cibo; Not, Work that meat, but, work for that meat. For if That Meat
which endures to eternal Life, must be given them by the Son of God; if This
Meat be the very Body and Blood of the Son of God: it cannot be the proper
Effect of any man's work, or any Merit of man; but the End or consequent of our
Labors or endeavors; and yet we are said to work This Meat in the same sense
that we are said to work our Salvation, viz. Consecutive, because God does
infallibly make us partakers of it, if we diligently seek after it or labor
for it.

7. By the right Use of this Distinction we may reconcile many places of Holy
Scripture, which seem repugnant one to another; as Likewise qualify many
Speeches, whether of the Fathers or some Good Modern Writers, which otherwise
would seem harsh and offensive. Who can say says Solomon Prove. 20. 9. I have
made my heart clean? This Interrogation is in all men's judgment Equivalent to
this Universal Negative; [No man can say, I have made my heart clean.] Howbeit
the Psalmist, Psalm. 73. 13. says, Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain.
There is no Contradiction between this Psalmists Particular Affirmative [I have
cleansed my heart;] and Solomon's Universal Negative, [No man can say, I have
cleansed my heart.] Solomon speaks of the Internal Purification, which is the
proper Effect and sole work of Gods Spirit: The Psalmist speaks of his own
Labors or Endeavors that his heart might be thus purified by the spirit of
God: He then did cleanse his heart Consecutive, non Formaliter. Every one
(Says St. John) that has this hope in him, purifies himself, as he is pure.
1. Joh. 3. 3. This place perhaps Some will say is meant of men Regenerate only,
seeing they only have that hope whereof the Apostle here speaks. Many other
such places of scripture there be, in which we are said, and sometime Commanded
to Purify our Selves: as Jam. 4. 8. Cleanse your hands ye Sinners, and purify
your hearts ye double minded. This place cannot be meant of men truly
regenerate: For even Sinners and double minded men, (such as men regenerate are
not.) are commanded to cleanse their hands and to purify their hearts. Many
other places likewise there be, wherein this purifying of the heart, is wholly
ascribed unto God. God (says St. Paul. Act. 15. 9.) put no difference betwixt
us and them, purifying their hearts by Faith. Not this Purification only, But
all other Good Works are said to be wrought by God, as Esaias. 26. 12. Lord thou will ordain peace for us: for thou also have wrought all our works in us, or
for us. And our Savior says John. 15. ver. 5. Without me ye can do nothing.
Both parts of our former Distinction are included in that of St. Paul. 2. Tim.
2. 21. If any man purge himself from these, he shall be a Vessel unto honor,
Sanctified, and meet for the Masters Use, and prepared unto every good work.
His speech is, if we mark it; [He shall be made a Vessel unto honor, if he
purge himself.] He does not say; [He shall be enabled to make himself a Vessel
of Honor.] Nor does he in propriety of speech, or as we say Formally or
Efficiently purge himself: But, in that he does those things, whereupon, this
Purification by Gods Spirit does immediately follow, Man is said to purge
himself. And so are we in this place of St. Paul Rom: 8. said, to mortify the
deeds of the body by the Spirit, when we do those things whereupon this
Mortification does immediately ensue, not by any Merit or Causalitie of our
works, but by Gods mere Grace, by the Council of his Holy and irresistible
Will, by the Determination of his Eternal Decree, by which it has pleased him
to apoint The One as a Necessary Consequent of The Other; to wit, Spiritual
Mortification or life it self, as the Issue of our endeavors to Mortify the
Flesh. This kind of Speech is usual not in Scripture only, but in other Good
Writers, and in our Common Dialect. So Tully tells us of a Roman Orator, who
for want of skill in Civil Law, Petijt revera ut causa caderet; made a Motion,
that he might Loose his Cause. This Motion he did not make directly or
Formally: His meaning is, that if his Motion had been granted, he must by
Necessary Consequent, have lost his Cause. Thus when we see a man Look Old,
whom we know to be much younger then our selves, we usually say; You make me an
Old Man: Not hereby meaning, that he has brought Old Age or Gray Hairs upon
us by any trouble or vexation, but that he, who is much younger then we, being
apparently Old, we must by Consequence be Old. So that he makes us Old, not
Efficiently; but only by Consequent truly argues us to be Old. According to
this Analogy of Speech by which He is said to make us Old, whose Age does
truly argue us to be Old, is that Prophecy literally mean^, of Jeremiah,
which was punctually or formally fulfilled in God or his Christ. Jer. 1. 10.
See, I have this day set thee over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root
out, and to Pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build and to
plant. Jeremiah did never Levy an Army or incite any people to take Arms for
the Deposition of their present Governor, or for the Alteration of any state:
yet in as much as He foretold the Extirpation of Some Kingdoms, and the
Erection or Plantation of Others; And in as much as what he foretold did
certainly come to pass, he is said to have Done that which did Follow upon his
Predictions, though many years after his death. And in the same Sense we are
said to Mortify the Flesh, to cleanse our Hearts; to work out our Salvation;
yea to make our Election sure, when we do those things whereupon our
Purification or Mortification shall be wrought, though many years hence; and
always wrought by the Omnipotent Power of that Decree by which those Kingdoms
were overthrown, and others erected in their place, whose Erection or Ruin
Jeremiah had foretold. Now to inquire, How Man, or his Free Will, does
cooperate with Gods spirit, in the First, Second, or Third Act of his
Conversion, is, to my Apprehension, a Question not Inextricable only, but as
Impertinent, as to make a Philosophical or Political Search, How Jeremiah did
concur with God in the Destruction of the Babylonian; Or Esaias with the same
God, in the Erection of the Persian Empire. Or more punctually to our present
purpose: how He that should open another man's mouth that were unable or
unwilling to open it himself, and yet so desperately sick, that unless he took
some Physical Receipt to remove the matter of his desease or to revive his
spirits, he should certainly dye, might be truly said to save his Life; yet
not to save it Efficienter, by way of efficiencie, but by Consequence: that is,
because the Physic, which without opening his mouth could have no Operation,
did revive or restore his wonted health. And in this sense Lydia may be said to
have saved her own Soul by way of Consequence, Act. 16. 14.
because she opened her ears unto St. Paul's Doctrine; and heard him with
attention: which being done, the Lord opened her heart to feed upon the Word of
Life, the only Physic of her soul. So that the word of Life, or Christ who is
the Eternal Word of God, did Immediately and Formally open her heart, and save
her soul: But unless she had opened her ears whilst Christ did knock at
these doors of her outward sensea by St. Paul's voice, Christ had not come into
her heart, to have entertained her at his Spiritual Banquet, as she did Paul
and his Company with bodily Food.

CHAP. XXXII.
Whether Mortification and Conversion may be said to be Ex Praevisis Operibus;
though God Alone do Properly Mortify and Convert us.
1. BUt be it as we have said; The maine Objection against the former Doctrine
fully answered.
That we are said to Mortify the Deeds of the Body, in as much as we do that
Morally which being so done, God does work Mortification Spiritual in us; All
is not so well as might be wished. For this Resolution seems to breed another
Difficulty of greater Danger; or rather, to establish a rejected Error. For*
hence it may seem to follow, that Mortification Spiritual is Ex praevisis
Operibus, from the works which we do, or which God foresees that we shall do.
And if the accomplishment of Spiritual Mortification be Ex praevisis Operibus;
then Life it self here promised should Likewise be Ex praevisis Operibus, by
our Works, or from Gods Foresight of our Works. And if either Mortification or
Spiritual Life be Ex praevisis Operibus then our Election Likewise should be Ex
praevisis Operibus, by our Works, or at Least from Gods Foresight of our Works:
especially if that be true, which before has been delivered; That none of
Years and discretion, are in the Estate of the Elect, but such as have truly
Mortified the Deeds of the Body; and that all such as have thus truly and
thoroughly Mortified the Deeds, of the Body, are in the Estate of the Elect.
What shall we say then? that Election is Ex praevisis Operibus, by our works or
from Gods Foresight of our Works? This is a Bugbeare Indeed, by which many of
Gods Children (so I account them) have been, and are much affrighted; but of
which they shall not need to be afraid, if they will give us leave to unmask
it. For being unmasked, it will appear to be of the same Visage and Countenance
that their own Doctrine is of: and a great deal more Consonant to their own
maine Principles, then many other Principles or Conclusions, unto which they
seek to consort it. And unmask it we may with This Distinction. Mortification,
Vivification, or Election, may be said or conceived to be Ex praevisis
Operibus, by our works or from Gods Foresight of our works, Two ways: Either,
tanquam ex Causa a^t Titulo, as from the Efficient Cause or Moral Title unto
these Graces; or, tanquam ex Termino aut Objecto non implicante
Contradictionem, as from the Term or Object unto which Gods Decree for
producing the works of spiritual Mortification (by which our Election is made
sure) is Terminated. To say that Mortification or Election should be, By, or
From our works in the Former Sense, that is, from our works as from any True
Cause of their production, or, as from any Merit or Title, that They may be
produced in us, is an Error indeed deservedly rejected by most Reformed
Churches. To say, That Mortification or Election it self, is By our works or
From our works in the Second Sense, that is, tanquam ex Termino, as from a Term
or Object without whose Presence or Coexistence God does not work or accomplish
our Mortification by his Spirit, nor admit us into the Estate of the Elect;
This is no Error, but an Orthodoxal Doctrine void of all danger. For it Being
granted, (which is as much as can be demanded) that Mortification Spiritual is
a work of Creation, and proper only unto God; yet even Creation it self, taken
in the stricter Sense, was ex Termino praeviso, from some Term, though not out
of any Cause or matter praeexistent. For when we say, that God Created the
heavens and earth of Nothing, that is, out of no Matter Praeexistent; we
necessarily include, that this Nihilum or Nothing, was the Negative Term of
this Creation. Logical Possibility, that is whatsoever includes no
Contradiction, is the Object of Omnipotency; and Creation it self is the
Reduction of such Possibility into Act or Real Effect. If there had been any
thing besides God, praeexistent to this work of Creation; or unless Nothing
had been praecedent, (not praeexistent) to all things that are, or have
Existence, there could have been no such Creation, as we believe there was, of
the heaven and of the Earth; or, of the First Mass, out of which all things
were made.

2. But Herbs and Grass were not made out of mere Nothing, as the Heaven and
Earth were. For they were made of the Earth, as it is Gen: 1. 11. God said Let
the Earth bring forth Grass, the herb yiedling seed, and the fruit tree
yiedling fruit after his kind. He did not in this sort Say, Let Nothing bring
forth the heavens and the earth: For so Nothing should have been Something. Or
if God had made herbs and grass after the same manner that he made the heavens
and the Earth, we could not say, that they had been made of the Earth: For so
the Earth should have been Nothing. And yet the making of grass and herbs out
of the earth, was a true and proper Creation: because, although God did make
them of the Earth; yet he made them not of the earth Tanquam ex materiali
Causa, Vid. Erastum Disput: contr^ Paracelsum.
as of their true material Cause, but of the earth tanquam ex Termino positivo,
as of the Term or Object, unto which his Creation of them had Reference; that
is, He did not decree to make them until the earth was made: Or, he did not
determine to make them, but out of the Earth; not of the Water or other
Element; as he made the Fishes of the water, not of the earth. So that grass
was made of the earth; and fishes, of the Sea, not as of any Cause concurrent
to their making or production, but tanquam ex Termino aut Objecto praeviso. The
Whales and great fishes which God created on the fifth day, were not from the
time of their Creation so much as a material Cause of the Fry or Spawn which
proceeded from them, until God bestowed his Blessing upon them, saying: Be
fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas. The Effect of this
Blessing was a true and proper Creation: For hereby they became in their kinds
Efficient and material Causes. And from this Blessing they received the first
Possibility of Propagation or continuance of their kind, by succession or
generation of the like. Admit then our Mortification as well as our
Vivification, is a work of Creation; God Creates life in Baptized Infants: And
this production of life spiritual in them, is like unto the Creation of the
heaven and Earth, or of the First Mass, that is, not ex praevisis operibus;
neither by their works, nor from Gods Foresight of their works. Thus much the
Romish Church confesses in the prayer used at the Burial of Infants Baptized;
Omnipotens and mitissime Deus, qui omnibus parvulis Renatis font Baptismatis,
dum migrant a saeculo, sine ullis Eorum meritis vitam illico largiris aeternam,
sicut animae hujus Parvuli hodie credimus to fecisse-. Ex Rituali Romano Pauli
quinti, impresso Antuerpiae. 1635. (in. 8. Ex Offic: Plantiniana Moreti) in
Officio Defunctorum. De Exequijs Parvulorum. Page 244. In this Creation there
is no Quaere if it be not otherwise in a Pagan ^f years, Coming to
Christianity. Without Baptism either Obtained or Desired He cannot be saved*
And Baptism he may not have without Qualifications preparative, professed to
the Church, that he may be admitted to it. And Real in his Soul that he may
have Rem Sacramenti, that is, become partaker of the Inward and Spiritual Grace.
Qualification or disposition praecedent, either by way of Title, or by way of
Term or Object. Or if we grant any Term or Object of this creation, it must be
the Entitie of the Infant, or its Capacity of Baptism, or the Baptism it
self.

3. How it is said, All things were created of Nothing.
But as it was the Almighty Creators pleasure, not to make herbs until he had
made the earth; nor fishes, until he had made the Sea, out of which he made
them tanquam ex termino, as of a positive Term or Object praeexistent, though
not positively concurring to their Creation or Coworking with him: So (as we
suppose) it was his pleasure, not to work Mortification, or to Create Life in
such as are capable of Reason, until some works which he requires, be done by
them; albeit the best works which any can do, be as little Conducent by way of
Causalitie or Title to the production of Life or Mortification Spiritual, as
the Red Earth was to the Creating of Adam, or Adam in a dead sleep was, to the
Creation of Eve. Adam was the sole work of God, and so was Eve, though made of
Adam; as well as the heaven and the earth, were the sole works of God. And so is
our Election; so is our New Life; so is our Mortification spiritiual, as truly
and entirely the work of God, though not wrought without some works of ours
praeexistent; as the Creation of Life in Infants is Gods Work, although they
have no works praeexistent. And as Adam, though Eve was made of him, had no
more share with God in her Creation, than Nothing had with Him in the Creation
of the heavens and the Earth: So neither have we, after we have done the works
required to Mortification any greater share or Title, of Causalitie in the
production of Life or Mortification Spiritual, than Infants have in their
Regeneration.

4. It may be Objected, That the works prerequired by us to Mortification
spiritual, are more truly Ours, than any Action that can be imagined as
requisite in the heavens for Creation of the Sun, Moon, or Stars; Or in the
Earth, for the Creation of herbs and trees. It Is true; Some Actions are
required in us, See the 2. note at the end of this Sect: chapt: 36.
that Grace may be created in us; yet not to make us more Capable naturally of
Grace, but to make us Mere Passives not incapable of it, or not Positively
Contradictorie to his Majesty or eternal aequitie. Man from the beginning had
a Freedom of Will to deprive himself of such Blessings, as God in his Bounty
had provided for him. Our first Parents by the Abuse of their Free Will betwixt
Good and Evil, made themselves incapable of any Blessing or Reward from Gods
Justice or mere Bounty: yet were they not hereby made incapable of his
Infinite Mercy. Nor are his Posterity made incapable of it by Sin merely
Original, but by Abuse of that Free Will which is left them as the proper Fruit
of Sin Original, that is, a Free Will to do Evil. We have a Power or Freedom
left us to make our selves more Incapable of Gods Mercy, than we were in Adam;
no Power at all to make our selves more Capable of it; it is God alone which
increases this Capacity in us. That of St. Austin is notwithstanding most
true in respect of All that are come to years of discretion; Deus qui fecit te
sine te, non salvabit te sine te; God which made thee without any endeavors of
thine own, will not save thee without thine own endeavors. And yet the best of
our endeavors are but to keep our selves in the same state wherein we were
when we had no works, no endeavors, that is, when we were Infants. And happy
is he that does not by lewd endeavors or ill works,
evacuate the Fruits of Baptism in himself. For him that does finally so
(Cassate or) Void them, it had been better if he had never been baptized, if he
had never been born. For by frustrating the hopes which he had in Baptism, he
makes himself more incapable of Gods mercy for having the Spirit of Life
created in him, than the Earth was of Gods Power to have Man created of it.

CHAP. XXXIII.
By what Spirit we are said to Mortify the Deeds of the Body.
1. Of the difference betwixt the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Man.
IF the deeds of the Body or the Flesh must be mortified by the Spirit of man:
then man has not only Freedom of Will but Liberum Arbitrium, an Ability to
Mortify his own Flesh, or to Free himself from the Servitude of the Flesh.
These and the like Inconveniences have persuaded some, to attribute this whole
work unto the Spirit of God, which is able to do all things without the
Coagencie or Consort of the Spirit of Man. But thus to avoid the former
Inconveniences, is but as if a man having found a Way out of a thicket of
Thorns, should instantly entangle himself in the Briars. For it is not so
Great a Solaecisme, to say; That the Spirit of Man, or man himself should be an
Agent in this business. As to Affirm That, whence it would follow, that The
Spirit of God should in this work of Mortification, be man's Instrument. For
that which Man works by the Spirit. Man is more properly said to work it,
then the Spirit. Now our Apostle says that we must mortify the deeds of the
Body: And he that Mortifieth is the Agent: That by which we work this
Mortification, is but our Instrument. And better it were to say, That the
Spirit of Man should be man's Instrument in this work, rather than the Spirit of
God.

2. It were according to our Former Principles easily answered, that We, by
Our spirit, Mortify the Deeds of our Bodies Consecutive, non Formaliter aut
Efficienter, that is, not by any Efficacy in us, or Influence derivable from
us: The Spirit of God must directly work or Effect it. But though this be True:
yet is it not Punctual to the point proposed. For by this Answer the Spirit
here meant should only be the Spirit of man: For by this Spirit only we work
our Mortification Consecutive. That which the Spirit of God does work in us, it
works Directly, Immediately, and Entirely: and in produceing its proper Effects
it has no Partner or Co-Agent. It may notwithstanding be yet further replied,
that we must Mortify the Flesh by the spirit of God, not as by any
Instrumental Cause subordinate to us, but in such a sense as we say; Inferior
Magistrates do the Acts of the Magistracy by the Kings or Supreme Magistrates
Authority, unto which they and their Magistracy are Subordinate. Thus some
good Pasqualius.
Interpreters upon this place say, that we must Mortify the Flesh by our own
Spirit, but, by our own Spirit, as it is Subordinate to the Spirit of God: and
Consequently to this Assertion it must be granted, that this Subordination of
our Spirit to the Spirit of God, is in this place necessarily included or
persupposed, though not expressed by our Apostle. All this (for ought I know)
may be most True and Orthodoxal, but withal too General. For, Inferior or
subordinate Magistrates are more properly said to be the Agents, Even in those
things which they do by the Authority and warrant of the Superiors: whereas
the Spirit of God is not only the Author or sole Authorizer, but the Principal
Actor or Agent in this work of mortification. For a more particular and
punctual Resolution of the Question proposed, we are to unfold the diverse
acceptions of these Words or Terms, to wit [THE SPIRIT] and [MORTIFICATION.]

3. There is the Spirit of God, and there is the Spirit of man: Both of them
have their several and diverse Importances in scripture. The Spirit of man may
be considered, as it is in the Natural Man, or in the man altogether
unregenerate; and This Spirit is at Enmity with God: or, in the Man as yet
unregenerate, yet in the way to Regeneration; And the Spirit of this man is
privatively opposite to the Spirit of God; so, as Darkness is to Light;
Blindness to Sight, or Death to Life. There is a Spirit likewise in the man
Regenerate, the same for Substance with the Spirit of the Natural Man; the same
for Substance that it was in himself before Regeneration, but altered in
Quality: And, This Spirit, though it cease not to be in man, yet is it not
usually called, The Spirit of Man, as being no way opposite unto the Spirit of
God, but Subordinate unto it; so Subordinate, unto it, that it is called, The
Spirit that is of God, and sometimes, The Spirit of God.

4. These diverse Acceptions of the word [SPIRIT] as likewise the Distinction
or Opposition between the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of man, are set down by
our Apostle. 1. Cor. 2. from the ninth verse unto the end of the Chapter. What
Man knows the things of a man, save the Spirit of man which is in him? Even
so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God. ver. 11. He does
not say, the spirit of God which is in God, or with God. And when He says,
[What man knows the things of man, save the Spirit of Man?] he supposes
there is even in the Natural and unregenerate Man, a Spirit, able to discern
the secret thoughts and imaginations of his heart, though blind and ignorant in
the things concerning God. Again, when he says [the things of God knows no
man:] he excludes the Natural man only, or the man to whom God has not
imparted the Gifts of the Spirit. For so he has said ver. 9. Eye has not
seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which
God has prepared for them that love him. Into What Man's heart have they not
entered? Or, unto What Man does this Negative belong? Only to the Natural or
unregenerate Man. For so he adds, verse 10. But God has revealed them unto us
by his Spirit: For the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.

5. What Spirit is this which searches all things, Even the deep things of
God? the Spirit of God which is without Us, or which communicates knowledge
and reveals things hidden unto us? If this Spirit were here meant, How should
those deep things of God be revealed unto us? Revealed to us they cannot be,
unless they be known by us: and known by Us they cannot be, but by the Spirit
which is in us. So he adds more expressly, Ver. 12. Now we have received not
the Spirit of the world, (that is, the Spirit which is of man) but the Spirit
which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to Us of
God. If by the Spirit which we have received, we know the things which are
freely given to us of God: This Spirit must be made Ours; it must be One with
Our Spirit; it is not the Spirit of God which is Without Us, or which works our
Regeneration, but the Spirit by which we become formally Regenerate and
Spiritual. And Punctually to this purpose the Apostle having said ver. 14. The
Natural Man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness unto him: Neither can he know them (so long as he remains a
Natural Man) because they are Spiritually discerned: he adds by way of
opposition, ver. 15. 16. But he that is Spiritual judges (or discerns) all
things, Yet He himself is judged of no man. For who has known the mind of the
Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. When He says
[WEE have the mind of Christ,] he includes ALL such as He was, that is, All
Men truly Regenerated by the Spirit, whom God has instructed to discern the
things of God. By [The Mind of Christ] the Apostle means the self same thing
that he did, by the Spirit of God. Between the mind of Christ communicated unto
us, and the Spirit of God communicated unto Us and received by Us, there is no
difference or distinction: The importance of both Speeches is the same. Our
mind being Changed from Evil to Good, or from minding of Carnal things to the
minding of Spiritual things, is called, The mind of Christ by Participation,
and so likewise The Spirit of God by Participation. But the Spirit of God which
communicates this Mind or Spirit unto us, or by which we are said to receive
it, has not always the same Importance: Between the Importances there is no
Dissension, yet a Distinction. Sometimes by the Spirit of God, God the Spirit
or God the Holy Ghost is meant, who in a peculiar manner is said to sanctify
Us, to Regenerate Us, to Quicken Us, to work Mortification in Us. Sometimes
again by the Spirit of God is meant, The Spirit which is in Christ, which is
the Fountain from whence all gifts of the Spirit are immediately derived unto
us, though the derivation be immediately wrought by the Holy Ghost. And when
the Apostle says, that we have the mind of Christ: this Mind of Christ which
we have received, supposes a Mind or Spirit in Christ which participates it
unto us, or from which we receive it by Participation. We may not imagine a
Transmigration or Transmission of the Spirit which is in Christ from Him to Us,
but a Participation only. God has anointed him with the Oil of gladness
above his Fellows. God gives not the Spirit by measure, to him. From the
fullness of this Spirit in him, we receive Grace for Grace; Albeit this Grace
be distributed or Portioned out unto Us by the Holy Ghost. Christ sends the
Spirit of Mortification or Regeneration into our hearts as the Fountain or
Conduit head does the water into a City: The Holy Ghost prepares our hearts to
receive this Spirit of Christ, and brings it unto Us, after such a manner as He
that makes the Aquaeducts or Conduit pipes, does convey water into a Town or
City, otherwise destitute of good water.

6. But what does the Apostle mean by the Spirit of man, as it is
Contradistinct or opposite to the Spirit of God? the whole Reasonable Soul or
Form of man by which he is distinguished from other Creatures? Or some
principal part which has least commixture with the Flesh, or Body, that which
we commonly call the Conscience? This part of the Soul even in the unregenerate
man often times disallowes such things as are entertained by the Reasonable Soul,
and condemns such Actions as are undertaken by Reason, and managed with
Extraordinary understanding. When the Gentiles (says our Apostle) do by Nature
the things contained in the Law, they show the work of the Law written in their
hearts, their CONSCIENCE also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or
else excusing one another, Romans 2. 14. 15. In this Accusation or Process in
the very Heathen, there is a Combat or Conflict between the Spirit and the
Flesh, or between the Mind and the Affections.

7. But may not the same part or Faculty of the Reasonable Soul disallow or
Condemn at one Time the self same things, which at another time it well
approves? If it may, there is no Necessity of Distinction between the Soul,
and the Spirit. But if there be any Conflict between Reason it self, and the
Spirit, at one and the same time; there must needs be a Distinction betwixt
them. Now it seems, that even whilst the Reasonable Soul does contrive
mischief, or give her Consent to things unjust or unexpedient, whilst it
Hatcheth Haeresie, the Conscience does secretly check it, and endeavor to
restrain it. And this, Conscience could not do, unless it were in some sort
distinct from that Reasonable part or Faculty of the Soul which is endued with
Freedom of Will. For there can be no Conflict but between two different
Parties or Capacities.

8. This is most Consequent to Plato's Philosophy, and to true Theology. For
as the Platonicks distinguish between the Soul and the Mind: So our Apostle
distinguishes between the Soul of man, and the Spirit of Man. 1 Thessalonians: The
Spirit of man is not said to be mortified, but Quickened by the Spirit of God.
5. 23. And the very God of Peace sanctify you wholly: and I pray God your
whole spirit and Soul, and Body, be preserved blameless unto the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Our Sanctification is not entire or universal in respect of
the Parts, (universal it cannot be in respect of all Degrees,) until the Soul
as well as the Spirit, until the Body as well as the Soul be thus Sanctified,
as our Apostle wishes. Every part of man must be in Part or in some good
measure Sanctified. But before this entire or whole Sanctification can be
wrought, there must be a Mortification of the Body or of the Flesh: and under
The Flesh (as has been observed before) The Reasonable Soul with its best
Faculties, is usually comprehended by our Apostle. Howbeit we do not read of
any Mortification of the Spirit but of Renovation, Vivification, or Quickening
of it.

9. What shall we say then? That the Spirit or conscience of man is altogether
free from the Contagion of the Flesh? that it stands in no need of
Mortification? 1. Cor. 8. 7.
St. Paul tells us, of some men, whose Conscience being Weak is defiled. But
the Conscience in his Language perhaps is not altogether the same with the
Spirit: But the Synteresis, in all likelihood, is. And again He tells us, that
there be men of Corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, which suppose that
Gain is Godliness. 1. Tim: 6. 5. And we read of a Soundness of mind, 2. Tim.
1. 7. But that defilement or corruption of the Spirit or mind, Seems by our
Apostle not to be Ordinary. However the mind or Conscience may be polluted by
the Contagion of the Flesh; yet are they not so radically polluted, as the
Flesh is. The Flesh is the seat of the disease. The Idiopathy (as Physicians
speak) is in The Soul; the Sympathy only in the Spirit or Conscience: So that
if the deeds of the Flesh be mortified, there needs no peculiar Cure or
Mortification of the Spirit. So it falls out in diseases of the Body. If the
Protopathie be cured, the Sympathy will fall of it self: As many are vexed often
times with great Aches or pains in the Head; Some with Fitts of the Epilepsie
or Falling Sickness, when as the root of the disease is in the Stomach. In
these Cases there needs no peculiar Physic for the Head: But cure the Stomach,
and the Head will recover without further medicine. From this Analogy or
proportion betwixt the diseases of the Soul, and of the body, it is (I take
it;) that we are not enjoined to mortify the Spirit. For the Apostle
supposes, that the Flesh being mortified, the Cure is wrought, without any
peculiar Mortification of the Spirit distinct from it. Or rather, He supposed
and knew, that the mortification of the Flesh could not be wrought without
Renovation or Quickening of the Spirit. For though it be true which some
Moralists say, Men's deprecatur ad optima, that, The Spirit or Conscience does
as it were entreat and counsel Malefactors themselves unto that which is Good:
Yet the Spirit and Conscience of the best men before they be renewed by the
Spirit of God, does perform this work but Weakly, Slightly, or Cowardly. And
the Reason, why the Spirit or Conscience of men, of good men in respect of
others, is so defective in this performance of its proper Function, is only
because it is overborn, or kept under, or in part corrupted by Carnal
Affections or contrary inclinations of the Body or flesh, which for this
Reason, must be mortified. Therefore the Apostle, when He exhorts to put off
the Old Man which is corrupt through the deceitful Lusts; injoynes them to be
renewed in the Spirit of their Mind. Ephe. 4. 22. 23.

10. There is a Twofold Mortification: The One consists in the weakening,
deading, or benumming of Carnal Affections or Desires: The Other is always
wrought and perfected by a Positive Purification of the Heart or Fountain,
whence the Affections flow. A man may cease to be unchaste or Lascivious by age
or other Casual Impotencie: So may a man cease to be drunk, by some disease or
distaste. Another may cease to be Ambitious, or have his Ambitious desires
benumbed or weakened, as being either bereaved of opportunities to raise his
Fortunes, or disenabled to follow his Suites or hopes of Preferment.
Mortification is then perfect, when the Affection it self is as it were rescued
from the Carnal Desires or Delights wherein it was involved, and is won or
trained to the Service of the Spirit.

CHAP. XXXIV.
Containing the Manner and Order of The Spirits Working, or of Our Working by
The Spirit.
1. THe Question remains [How these Two sorts of mortification are wrought by
The Spirit or by Us?] To this Disquisition concerning the Cure of the Soul,
there is a Question very Pertinent amongst the Physicians of the Body. Whether
the Cure of men's Souls be wrought by Contraries, or Symbolicals.
One sort says, Omne Remedium fit per Contrarium: The Others say, Omne
Remedium fit per Simile. The Difference betwixt them may be easily reconciled
with the Distinction of the Infirmities and Diseases which are to be cured, or
of the Subject whereunto the said Medicine may be said to be Like, Dislike, or
Contrary.

2. The Medicine may be sometimes Contrary to the Matter of the Disease, but
Like unto the Nature opposed. Sometimes again, the Medicine may be Contrary to
the Nature, but Agreeable with the matter of the Disease wherewith Nature is
opposed. Some Diseases properly consist in mere weakness of Nature or
Languishment of Spirit: and these must be cured per Simile, by administration
of such Diet or Receipts as may immediately comfort the Fountain of Life, which
consists in Calido and Humido, in moderate heat and moisture. As for this
reason, Hot-waters to men in Swounds are fittest; and warm Brothes or Cordials,
to men otherwise Feeble, or deprived of heat and moisture. Other Diseases
consist either in Excessive Heat, or abundance of Blood: and these must be
cured by the Contrary, as by opening a Vein, or by cooling Diet, or
medicines. Too much fullness of Body cannot be helped, but by abstinence, or
Evacuation. However, both sorts of Physicians agree, that when all is done
Nature is the best Physician; and that is the best Physic which setts Nature
Free, to exercise her own strength; or Strengthens her to expel noysom
humors, which cloy or molest her. But often times it so falls out, that Nature
cannot be thus freed of bad Humors which are settled in the Body, without
administration of some thing that is Contrary unto Nature, but Consorteth so
well with the Humors which oppress her, that Nature being enforced to expel
this In-mate or New-Comer, does with the same force expel a secret or
domestic Enemy which had associated himself unto it: As sometimes the Law
cannot proceed against secret Enemies of the state, until they be drawn to
associate or join themselves to other apparent foreign Enemies, with whom they
perish or are expelled their Native Country together with them. Again,
although the Conflict be always most eager and keen between Natures most
Contrary: yet that which every Contrary Agent does in the first place aim at,
is, not utterly to destroy its Oppo^ite, but to make it like it self; albeit
the one often come to destroy the other by seeking to make it grow like it
self. The heat of the fire does not directly aim or strike at the cold in the
water, but seeks to communicate its own heat unto it: and the heat produced in
the water, does immediately and directly expel the cold, and at length consume
the substance of water.

3. For better explicating the Manner, how both kinds of Mortification are
wrought by the Spirit; Or how they are wrought by the Spirit of God, how by the
spirit of man, or by the spirit which is in Man; Or how by Contraries, How by
Similitude: we are in the First place to consider Three Estates or Conditions
of Men: How the Cure of the Soul is wrought in several sorts or Conditions of
men.
The First, of the Natural Man; that is, of him which as yet is in no sort
partaker of the spirit of God, which has had no touch or feeling of its
Operation in him or upon him. The Second is, of men which have been partakers
of the Spirit, but, as we say, in Fieri, not in Facto; Such as feel the
motions of Gods Spirit whilst it moves them; that is, they are partakers of
its Motions or touches, but not of its Residence in them or of any Permanent
Impression made upon them. The Third Sort, is, of men made partakers of the
Spirit in Habit, that is, (as the Apostle speaks) they have the Spirit
dwelling in them, and are enlivened and enquickened by it. The manner how
Mortification is wrought in these Three several sorts or Conditions of men by
the Spirit, is not the same. In the First sort, the Cure is Commonly Begun by
the Contrary, but always Finished by Assimilation. God sometimes weakens the
inclinations of the natural man against his will, without Consent of his own
Spirit. Some men are prone to offend or to surfeit of the flesh unto death, by
the abundance of health, or too Lively plight of Body; and these God in mercy
sometimes visits with grievous sicknesses, for preventing the diseases which
would otherwise grow upon them. And many Natural men (as a I think he means
Pliny Junior in that excellent 26. Epistle Lib. 7. See the note in the end of
Chapter 36.
Heathen confesses) being thus visited, first begin seriously to think
themselves but men, subject to misery and Mortality; and that there is a God
or Divine Power which is the Author and Giver of Life. Others are prone to
incur danger of death, by abundance of Wealth; which the more it abounds, the
more it commonly increases the disease: For Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa
pecunia Crescit; As money or wealth increases, so ordinarily the Love of it
increases. And these God often times in mercy visits with loss of Goods, or
with some other Cross or Affliction which either deprives them of
opportunities, or deterres from the means of increasing wealth. And this is a
part of the Cure, or a preparation to it, and is usually wrought by Contraries.
Others are prone to incur hardness of heart by Pride and overprizing of
themselves; And these God often times visits with Disgrace, with Contempt or
Scorn of Others. Now the Rule is General, That if the Parties thus visited or
cured in Part by Contraries, duly compare their Visitation with their sins,
which in Justice have procured it; the Spirit gets great advantage of the
Flesh, and is more capable and sensible of the Motions or Impulsions of Gods
Spirit. Howbeit man himself and the Spirit of man in this first Cure or Part
of Mortification, is merely Passive. And it is well if by often ruminating or
Reflecting upon what has befallen him by the Providence of God, and by the
sense or feeling of the impulsions of His Spirit, he can content himself to be
merely Passive, or a Towardly Patient in the next Degrees of his Mortification
or Conversion, which are still wrought by the Spirit of God as by the Agent or
efficient Cause.

4. From these Observations the Resolution of the Former Question, so far as
it concerns the Man unregenerate, is Easy and perspicuous. The Question was
[How this Mortification is wrought by the Spirit of God which is without us,
but always assisting us; How by the Spirit of Man, or by the Spirit which is
in Man* though partaker of the Spirit of God?] The Answer is; So much of the
Cure as is wrought, is wrought by the Spirit of God, as Present to man but not
in Man, as by the only Agent or Efficient Cause; For that is the Efficient
which begins and continues the motion: The same Cure is wrought by the Spirit
which is in Man, as by the Immediate and Formal Contrary: that is, it is
Formally wrought by the Spirit which is in Man, as by an Agent per Emanationem,
as it it moved by the Spirit of God; So the Native Cold is expelled out of the
water by the Fire as by the only Agent or Efficient: And yet the same Cold is
immediately and Formally expelled by the Heat which the fire produces in the
water, as by a Formal and Incompatible Contrary. The only End or immediate
Effect at which every Natural Agent directly aims, is the Assimilation of the
Subject whereon it works, unto it self. And this Assimilation is wrought by
introducing the like quality in the Subject unto that by which the Agent or
Efficient works: As the first thing which the Fire seeks to Effect, is, to
produce Heat in the Water: but the heat once produced, expels the Cold, as
immediately and as formally, as the depression or pulling down one scale, lifts
up the other. The manner how this Mortification is wrought in us by the Spirit
of God, is the very same: The immediate and direct Effect at which it directly
aymeth, is, the Transformation of our Spirit into the similitude of the Spirit
of Christ: And this consists in the Production or Creation of the Spirit of
Grace. The Spirit of Grace being produced in us, Or our Spirit being touched by
the Spirit of Christ, as the Steel is by the Adamant, Formally expels or
abateth the Lust of the Flesh. And when the Flesh is thus truly mortified by
the Spirit, that Sanctification of which the Apostle speaks, 1 These. 5. 23. is
wrought in us.

5. The first Part of this Cure (as was said) is wrought by Contraries: that
is, by Freeing the Spirit of the unregenerate Man from the burden of the Flesh
which overmasters it, or inticeth the Soul to such Practices as the Spirit
dislikes. And from this Burden of the Flesh the Spirit of God, or his peculiar
Providence, does free the Soul, or Spirit of Man, by laying some one kind or
other of Bodily Affliction upon him, which is more displeasing to his Nature,
then the Former Motions of the Flesh were pleasant. But the Spirit of Man thus
Freed in part from the Burden of the Flesh wherein it lay smoothered or much
oppressed, cannot so perfect Mortification begun, as Nature freed by Physic
from oppressing humors, digests the Relics or remainder, and by digesting
them, recovers health and strength. What Advantage then does accrue unto the
Spirit of Man by weakening the Inclinations of the flesh? Much every way. For,
the Flesh being thus weakened, the Spirit does hereby become more Towardly
Passive then it was before, more apt to be moved by the Spirit of God, and by
such motions more capable of Spiritual Cure. Every Motion of our Spirit by the
Spirit of God, does abate or weaken the Inclinations of the Flesh: and every
such Abatement or Degree of weakening the Flesh, is a Degree of Mortification.

6. These First Degrees of Mortification are commonly wrought by interposed
Fits or Motions of the Spirit of Man produced by the Spirit of God. The men
that are partakers of them have Liberty or Respite in the mean time to
Reflect upon them; and by thus reflecting upon them or by taking them into
serious Consideration, are enabled, to avoid such External Occasions as
strengthen the Inclinations of the flesh, and to cut off their Food and
Nutriment. For albeit the Spirit of man be in the first Cure merely Passive:
yet it is not so Passive as stocks and stones or other senseless Creatures
are: It has a true sense or feeling of the Motions put upon it, or produced in
it, by the Spirit of God. Nor is the Spirit of man sensible only of such
Motions, in such sort as Flies or Gnats or other imperfect sensitive Creatures
are of bodily motion; that is, sensible only for the present without any
remembrance of what is past, or consideration of the like to come. Partly from
the Memory of former Motions, which have been put upon it; Partly from the
Representation or Consideration of the like apprehended by it, as Possibly
Future or approaching, the Spirit of Man though it cannot move or expel the
inclinations of the Flesh by way of proper Agencie or Efficiencie, is yet able
so to Countersway them, as that they cannot exercise their intended Motions, or
accomplish their Attempts.

7. This is the Apostles Doctrine, Gal. 5. 16, 17. This I say then, walk in
the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the Lust of the Flesh. He does not say; ye
shall not be opposed or assaulted by the lusts of the flesh: for, (as in the
next words is included,) the flesh will still attempt the Execution or Exercise
of its Motion. For, the Flesh (says the Apostle) Lusts against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other;
So that ye cannot do things that ye would. That is, The Flesh can neither do
the things that it intends to do, nor the Spirit produce those Effects which
it wishes and much desires; no more then Heat can produce its proper Effects,
when it is overmatched (in the same Subject) with Cold; or, then Cold is able
to produce the proper effects thereof, whilst it is attempered or
Counterswayed by Heat. Now the Spirit whereof our Apostle speaks in this
place, is the Spirit of man, at least the Spirit which is in man though in part
renewed by the Spirit of God. For, as the Apostle speaks, the Flesh and the
Spirit here meant* are Contrary: And it is the nature of Contraries to be in
one and the same Subject: And it is the true property of Contrary
Inclinations to move and sway upon one and the same Center or Point of Rest or
Dependence. Otherwise, how strong soever the one Contrary be, it could not
Countersway nor Counterpoyse the other. The Point or Center whereupon the
inclinations of the Flesh and Spirit do move or sway, is the Soul which
sometimes inclines more unto the Spirit, sometimes more unto the Flesh or
Carnal Affections. The whole work of Mortification is but a Putting off the
Old man and Putting on the New. The more the inclinations of the Flesh are
weakened, the more apt is the Spirit of Man to be moved, impelled, or
strengthened by the spirit of God; And the more apt it is to be moved by the
Spirit of God* the more easily and Readily will the inclination of the Flesh or
Old man be weakened by it. So that there is a Continual Reciprocation betwixt
the weakening of the Flesh, and the strengthening or renewing of the Spirit. In
every several Act or motion of Gods Spirit, by which the Spirit in man is
renewed or quickened, the Spirit of man thus assisted by the Spirit of God,
gets a Double Advantage of the flesh: First, it directly weakens the
inclinations of the Flesh or old man, and by weakening them, gains further
possession or interest in the Affections, wherein the lusts or desires of the
flesh were seated. Secondly, The Spirit of man being revived and quickened by
the Spirit of God, does not only Countersway or curb the Flesh, but withal
does Purify the Soul, or the Fountain of the Affections, and in the next
Conflicts uses the Service of the Soul and inferior Affections to Conquer
and expel the Remainder of Carnal desires or Concupiscence, or at least does
keep them under that they cannot make head or open rebellion as it were to
depose the Spirit of its Soveraigntie, after once it has gotten it* Specially
if men which have proceeded thus far in this Conflict, be wary and vigilant,
always remembering that their Greatest strength consists in imploring the
assistance of the Spirit of God, in waiting His Approach, and attending His
Motions. But let no man think he has got the victory over the Flesh, or has
performed this Duty of Mortification as he ought, until the Desires or
Inclinations of the Flesh be Mortified by the vivification or quickening of the
Affections wherein they were seated: or until the Spirit and Soul of man
renewed (as has been said) by the Spirit of God, have vvon the Soul and
Affections unto their side or part.

CHAP. XXXV.
Wherein the Accomplishment of Mortification, or, of Conversion unto God, does
properly Consist.
1. AFter this Preparative to Mortification thus begun by the Spirit of God or
by his Peculiar Providence, the whole Cure consists in the Assimilation or
Transformation of our Spirit into the similitude or Likeness of the Spirit of
God: Some Relics of the Image of God in man, which are not in Devils.
and this is wrought by the Renewing of Gods Image in us. Some Relics there
be of Gods Image in the natural man, the like whereof are not in Devils: and
these are seated in The Spirit or Synteresis. Howbeit these in themselves are
no better then dead stocks or roots until they be revived by the Spirit of
God and secret Influence of his Graces: but so renewed they naturally diffuse
the influence of life into the stemmes or branches. The soul and body of the
whole man are so quickened by them, as the branches or stemmes in the spring
time revive by the return of sap from the root: Both are quickened and revived
by the Spirit of God, and by the sweet disposition of his Providence, as trees,
as herbs, grass, and other Vegetables are by the Sun, by the sweet influence
of Heaven, and by the moystned Earth, whereby the roots are immediately
cherished.

2. This Vivification or renewing of the Spirit in man, is immediately wrought
Per Simile; As our Animal or Vital Spirits in Swounds are revived by the Spirit
of wine or other comfortable water. First* The Relics of Gods Image or
implanted Rules of Conscience have more immediate Similitude with the Spirit of
God or of Christ, than the inferior Faculties of the Soul or body have. And yet
these Relics of Gods Image or Rules of Conscience being true parts or native
branches of the Spirit of man, symbolize better with the soul and body of man,
then this Spirit of God which works this Mortification, does. So that albeit
the Spirit of God or his preventing Grace does always begin this
Mortification, without any operation or Co-Agencie of the Spirit of man; And
albeit the Spirit of man be a Mere Passive in all the Motions by which it self
is renewed and quickened: Yet after it be not only moved, but thus touched and
quickened by the Spirit of God, Actus agit; it works, not only by Countersway
or Renitencie, but it diffuseth the influence of Life and Grace which it self
receives entirely from the Spirit of God, throughout the inferior Faculties
of the Soul: It takes the place or room of so much of the Lusts of the flesh,
as it Expells; And as well in the Expulsion of the Lusts of the Flesh, as in
taking possession of the Body wherein they were seated, it uses the Soul as
the Medium deferens, as the Mean (at least) for communicating life to the Flesh
or Body. And by this Diffusion of the Spirit of Life or influence of Grace
throughout the Faculties or Affections of the Soul, the second part or
Accomplishment of Mortification is wrought, which (as was said before)
consists in the Rescuing or winning of the natural Affections from the Flesh
unto the Spirit.

3. For better understanding the manner how this Accomplishment of
Mortification is wrought, We are to consider, that albeit the Lusts of the
Flesh are simply evil: yet the Affections wherein they are always seated, are
in their nature neither simply Good nor simply Evil, but of an Indefinite or
Indifferent Temper between Moral Goodness and that which is Morally Evil.
They become Good or Evil, or at leastwise, more or less evil, according to
the several marks at which they aim, or the diversity of the Objects on which
they bestow themselves, or of the Issues which they find. True it is, that the
Fountain of our Affections is so tainted by Original corruption, that no
Affections or desires, as they issue from the heart of the Natural collapsed
man, are pure or free from stain or sin: yet they become more or Less filthy
or criminous according to the Course or Current which they take. The Fountain
of the First Man's Affections was clear and pure: yet were his desires polluted
by the Vent or Issue which they took; as a stream or Rivulet which takes its
Original from a pure Rock, does instantly lose its Original Purity by falling
into a muddy Channel, or running through a filthy sink, especially if the
Current by stoppage or other external cause, do Reciprocate upon the Fountain
or spring. On the Contrary, the water which springs out of a moss or quagg,
becomes purer and clearer by taking its course through a Rock or Gravel. It
being granted then that the very Fountain of our Affections or desires is
polluted, and unclean; the Mortification whereof we speak, is then truly
wrought, when the natural Affections wherein the Lusts of the flesh are seated,
are recovered or diverted from the Course of the Flesh, and won unto the
Conduit of the Spirit. The Flesh or deeds of the Body must be Mortified; But
this mortification must be wrought, not by mortifying or destroying, but first
by purifying, then by quickening or reviving the natural Affection, wherewith
the Lusts of the flesh do mingle, as mire or filth does with water which falls
into it, or as bad humors do with the blood.

4. Lasciviousness is reckoned by St. Paul amongst the works of the flesh: And
Mary Magdalen who had been Notoriously Wanton and Lascivious, had this member
of the Old man truly Mortified in her without enfeebling or benumming the
Affection of Love it self, which was as strong in her as ever it had been, but
set upon its right mark, and employed in the Service of the Spirit. She stood
(says the Text) at our Saviors Feet behind him, weeping, and began to Wash
his Feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed
his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Luke 7. 38. Thus she did
because she Loved much: And she Loved much, because many sins were forgiven
her. Her Wanton Love or rather the wantonness of her love was truly Mortified
by the vivification or Quickening of Spiritual Love in her: For the Love of the
flesh was mortified by the Love of the Spirit.

5. The accomplishment of Mortification consists not in deading but in winning
the Affections unto the Spirit.
Amongst other Deeds of the Body, amongst all the Lusts of the Flesh, Pride or
Ambition is the most dangerous, and must be Mortified by the Spirit. But
wherein does the true Mortification of it consist? Not in Negatives; not in an
Absolute disesteem of all Honor, or disclaiming all desire of praise or
reputation. For this may stand with Stoical stupiditie, or Cynical sloth, or
nasty proud contempt of the world: which kind of temper has least affinity
with that Mortification which becomes a Christian: For This requires, that the
Affection it self remain entire for the service of the Spirit. Romans 6. 19. The
Affection out of which Pride or Ambition grows (as a Wen out of a comely
Body) is a Desire of Praise or Honor. Neither is all Desire of any Honor, nor
the Excessive desire of some Honor a work or lust o^ the Flesh, or any branch
of Pride or Ambition, which properly consists in the immoderate Desire of that
Honor which is from men. This indeed is a Lust of the Flesh or Carnal
Concupiscence, which must be Mortified. And the best Method for the
Mortification of this Desire, is by raising the esteem or price of that Honor
which comes from God. This Desire must have the predominant sway in our heart,
before we can be true Believers. So our Savior teaches us John. 5. 44. How
can ye believe which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor
that comes from God, Only? Now without true Belief there can be no true
Mortification. The same Spirit which works Faith or Belief in us, does with
it and by it, give us the true esteem of that Honor which comes From God,
Alone. The true esteem of this Honor being imprinted upon our soul and spirit,
does increase the Desire of it. And as the Desire of it is increased, Pride and
ambition (which is but a desire of that Honor which is from Men or from the
world) must needs decrease, and by thus decreasing be truly Mortified.

6. Another most dangerous work of the Flesh is Covetousness. The mortification
of this work or member of the old man, does not consist in a Retchless Temper,
or neglective Content in Living from hand to mouth, without any provident care
for Times Future: for this is Sottishness. The desire of riches is not a sin
but a natural Affection, which must not be Mortified, that is, not destroyed,
but revived and quickened. Wherein then does Covetousness consist? Not simply
in the Desire of riches, but in the Excessive desire of such riches as perish,
or of such other means or of necessaries of Life, as are less worth then Life
it self. The Affection or Desire of riches is not to be quelled, but to be
diverted from its muddie Channel, by the Spirit of Mortification. This spirit
of Life does draw or conduct our desires that way which the Lord of Life
commands them to take; that is, to seek after Riches, but after Riches of
another kind: Lay not up for your selves treasure upon Earth, where moth and
rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But Lay up for
your selves treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and
where thieves do not break through and steal. Mat. 6. 19. 20. By the Parable
Likewise of the unjust Steward, and that other of the Talents, we are commanded
to imitate, or rather to outstrip the Usurer or cunning Bargainer for worldly
Commodities, in diligent care and watchful observance for increasing this
Heavenly Treasure; in being as wise and careful in doing good to others, as
Worldlings are in doing good unto themselves. No man offends in being vigilant
and careful, but in employing his wits and care for gaining Transitory Wealth,
which is less worth then his Life or soul; whereas this bodily Life it self is
well Lost or Laid to pawn, for gaining Treasure in Heaven.

7. Drunkenness is a work of the Flesh which must be mortified. The Affection
whence this Loathsome stream does spring, is a desire of mirth or pleasure. For
no man directly desires to be Drunk. All men naturally desire to be Merry, as
having an internal spring of delight or mirth in themselves, which naturally
desires an issue or vent; otherwise, the Soul and Spirit becomes sodden in
Melancholy. Hence it is, that many men's Affections detesting this Melancholy
humor, be drenched in this Filthy sink or puddle of Drunkenness, which is but
a Sinister or preposterous Issue of inbred Mirth. The true Mortification of
this monster is not to be sought by quelling or weakening the Affection whence
it springs, but rather by giving it another Issue or vent. Thus much is employed
in our Apostles advice. Ephesians. 5. 18. Be not Drunk with wine wherein is Excess,
but be filled with the spirit, speaking to your selves in Psalms and Hymns and
spiritual songs, singing and making Melody in your heart to the Lord. Our
Apostle here supposes, that the spirit of God, which alone works the
mortification of this sin and other Lusts of the flesh, although he detests all
drunken ryotous mirth, is not a dull spirit of melancholy. It delights much
in its own music, always desirous to hear pleasant songs of its own setting.
And there is no means so Effectual for drowning drunken mirth, as a full
consort of the music of this spirit; Beatus populus, quiscit Jubilationem
hanc. Blessed are the People That can rejoice in Thee O Lord.

8. The perfect Cure of the Soul is wrought Per Simile.
Thus it is plain how this Cure must be wrought by Contraries, and yet per
simile, by the Like too. The Lusts of the Flesh must be Mortified by the
Spirit, and yet these are Contraries. But if we descend unto Particulars:
Ambition or desire of honor, must be mortified by desire of Honor.
Covetousness which is a desire of Riches, must be mortified by the desire of
Riches. Drunkenness which is a Desire of Mirth, must be mortified by a desire
of Mirth. Immoderate carnal Love must be mortified by excessive Love of Christ
and of things Spiritual. Between the Desires themselves there is as true
Similitude as is between the several currents of water which issue from the
same spring or fountain; but as perfect a Contrariety between the Objects and
issues of the desires, as there is between the several waters of the same
fountain, whilst the One runs in a pure rock or conduit pipe, and the other
into a sink or puddle.

9. To Conclude then; The spirit of God does first purify the Fountain of our
Desires, that is, the spirit or Conscience of man. The spirit of man being thus
quickened and purified, does by direction and assistance of the same Spirit of
God, divert the current of his Desires, and give a new vent or issue to his
Affections. And the Desires or Affections by this diversion of their Current,
receive a further Degree of Purification from the Ocean or Sea into which they
empty themselves, that is, from Heaven and the heavenly Lights on which they
are set. Between the Current of our Desires or Affections thus purified by the
spirit of God, and the Celestial Objects whereon they are set, there is such
Reciprocation or mutual recourse, as it were between a stream of pure water and
a Sea of Nectar; the stream or spring still falling into the sea, and the sea
still sweetning the stream by reflowing upon it. The spirit of Christ which
knows no bounds or Limits; which is more boundless then the Ocean, delights in
our Desires or Affections whilst they are set upon heavenly things. And the
more his spirit is delighted in our Desires and Affections thus emptying and
pouring out themselves, the more he purifies and sweetens them by the influence
of his Gracious Spirit. Yet are not any man's Affections so thoroughly sweetened
by the Spirit of Grace in this Life, as not to retain some permanent Tincture
or mixture of the Flesh. Howbeit, every man is Thoroughly mortified, in whom the
spirit of Christ has gotten the Soveraigntie over the Flesh, and won the
better part of the natural Affections, to its service. But whether this
Soveraigntie being Once gotten, may not Finally or for a time at least be lost,
Heave it to the determination of the Schools. My application for the present
shall be from the words of the Son of Syrach Ecclus. 38. 25, 26. Though the
book be Apocryphal, yet his observation in this place is Canonical: (...), The
wisdom of a Learned man comes by opportunity of Leisure, or (as some read) by
right employment of his vacant time. And he that has little business shall
become wise. How can he get wisdom that holds the Plough, and that glories
in the Goad, that drives Oxen and is occupied in their Labors, and whose
(...).
talk is of Bullocks, Or, of the breed of bullocks? His verdict concerning
Handy-Crafts-Men, is for the most part true of Men full of that which we call
Book-Learning: or employed in matters of Government of Sat: Would to God it
were not too true of many, that have little Business. In respect of this
private Learning Every one of us. Especially in these times, have Books enough
of our own, so we would sequester some competent times or vacant seasons for
serious perusing them. Every man's course of life and daily Actions, are the
best Books for this Learning. And no man can so well read them, as his own
Spirit and Conscience. Herein then consists the Wisdom of him that is in part,
and desires to be A ^etter Christian: First, in careful Observing the Touches
of Gods punishing or chastising Hand: Secondly, in Reflecting upon the motions
of his Spirit: Thirdly, in duly Examining Every day. What advantage the Flesh
has gotten against the Spirit, or the Spirit against the Flesh All this being
done, the best employment of all these Talents which God commits unto our
trust, must be in acknowledgeing our whole strength to be from God, and in
Consecrating our best endeavors by continual Prayer for the assistance of his
Spirit. In this Last Point we are Active, yet Active only to the End that we
may be Towardly Passive, that we grieve not the Good Spirit of God by which our
Sanctification must be wrought. He will not forsake Us, unless we forsake Him
first. But as water which has been heated by the fire congeales the soonest
after it be taken off, and removed from it: So they
which have felt the Motions of Gods Spirit, and have been in some measure
Mortified by it, freez the soonest in the dregs and Lusts of the flesh; and
have their hearts extraordinarily hardened, if once they forsake him, or so
grieve him that he cease to renew or continue his former Motions. But he that
will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will pray
before the most High, and will open his mouth in prayer, and make Supplication
for his Sins: When the Great Lord will he shall be filled with the Spirit of
Understanding. Eccl. ^9. 5. 6. Oh how much better had it been for us to have
had our hearts filled with this Spirit, the Spirit of Comfort, than to have our
Dwellings, as now they are, possessed with Grief and Heaviness; and the whole
People enraged with Jealousies, with Furious Zeal, and discontent! Now all this
is come upon Us for no one Sin more; more for this one, then for all the rest,
I mean our negligence in frequenting the House of God at those times, or our
ill employment of those vacant times, which Authority had sequestered and set
apart for Solemn Prayer and Thanksgiving.

10. Put here the Reader will remember, and perhaps Challenge me either of
Forgetfulness, or of Breach of Promise, for not discussing the Third General
proposed, Chapt. 28. Number. ^2.
which was, The exact Limitation of these Two Propositions, [If ye live after
the flesh ye shall die: If through the Spirit ye do Mortify the Deeds of the
Body ye shall Live] My Apology must be This: That having taken some more
Pains in this Point, then in the rest Concerning Mortification; I find the
Limitation so inwrapt with the true State of the Question [Concerning Election
and Reprobation] that I cannot touch the One, but I must handle the Other: and
for this Reason have Deferr^d, not Forgotten, See the Appendix at the End of
this Book.
the Determination of the Third Point, until I have finished what I have Long
Conceived* of the Points Concerning [Election, Reprobation, or Predestination]
Points as I have often intimated in public Meditations, of more easy and
facil Resolution, then most other Controversies in Divinity; if so we would
take these Terms [Election, Reprobation etc.] as we ought to do, in their
Passive or Concrete Sense. But if we take them in the Active or Abstract Sense,
or, as they are Acts in God, their Determination is to Mankind, even to General
Councils, altogether Impossible; yea to Attempt this work is either an
undoubted Spice of Phrenetical Pride, or an infallible Symptom of Divine
Infatuation.

CHAP. XXXVI.
Containing the Scope or Sum of what has been said Concerning Free Will and
the Service of it in the Duty of Mortification.
1. Needless Speculations about Free Will etc. Chief Occasions of our
Negligence in Good Practices.
THe utmost Aim or Final Cause of all these former Discussions was, to make
them an Introduction unto the Second part of the Knowledge of Christ and of him
Crucified, and of his Resurrection from the dead, and Sitting at the right hand
of the Father: that is in a word, How he does set us Free Indeed from the
Servitude of sin and Satan. The Second End and most immediately subordinate to
this purpose was, to provoke or rouz up our spirits to shake off that slumber
which has possessed a great part of the Christian World; specially since those
Unfortunate Controversies betwixt the Jesuits and Dominicans, and the like
betwixt the Lutherans and the Zwinglians or Calvinists, set forth of late in a
new dress between the Arminians and the Gomarists, have so contentiously been
debated. The only Issue of which debates amongst the Learned, has been to
bring their Auditors or Readers to a Gaze or Stand, and to Cause them to make a
Sinister use of that Maxim in Law, Lite pendente nihil fit; whilst the
Controversy has been under debate nothing has been done, even in Duties most
necessary to their Salvation. Both Parties, how great soever the disagreement
betwixt them has been, have agreed too well in this Resolution, aut otiosos
esse, aut (quod pejus est) nihil agere; either to be altogether Idle, or (which
is worse) to take a great deal of pains to no purpose, in reading much and
resolving to do nothing, until the Controversy betwixt Grace and Nature were
fully determined, and the Bounds or Meere-Stones betwixt Gods Part and Man's
Part be set forth, that we might Punctually know, what he is willing or would
be pleased to do, and what we may and ought to do for working out our own
Salvation, or for being made Free Indeed by the son of God.

2. The Points useful for clearing this business are but Two. And both of them
have been handled before. The Sum of the Former in Brief was this. [What
Freedom of will may be conceived Compatible with absolute Servitude to sin and
Satan?] The Answer in Brief * was This: See chapt. 24.
That without some Portion of Free Will, even in the natural and unregenerate
man, all the Admonitions Given by our Savior in the 8th of St. John's Gospel
unto the Jews, or afterward by his Apostles to both Jews and Gentiles, had
been much better bestowed on Bruit Beasts whether wild or tame, nay even upon
stocks and stones, then upon men. For the true reason, why Bruit Beasts or
other Creatures cannot be Servants, is, because they are not endowed with
Reason, or (which is all one) with some Free Will. Every Civil Servant or
Slave has as Free a Will as his Master has; Sometimes a great See the notes
at the end of this Chapt.
deal more Free. The Essential Difference betwixt them is this; That a Servant
has no Liberum Arbitrium, no power or Arbitrament to dispose of his own
Actions or employments according to his own Free Will or choice, but according
to the Free Will or appointment of his Master. Briefly and more Punctually
thus: It were impossible there should be any such Servum Arbitrium or true
Servitude unto sin, as Luther contended for, where there is not Libera
Voluntas, such Freedom of Will as we now treat of. And this was all that
Erasmus did conclude, or (I take it) did intend to make good against him. It
was an oversight in Luther and in most of his Followers (Learned Chemnitius
only excepted) not to distinguish inter Liberum Arbitrium and Liberam
Voluntatem. Vid. Chem. Comm. in Melan. de Libero Arbit. Sive (ut Chemnitius
agnoscit Luculentiorem esse Titulum) de Viribus Humanis.

3. The Second useful Point is, to know, [What Branch of Free Will either the
Natural man before he come to profess Christianity; or Christian Children
Baptized, are bound in the first place to exercise?] To this The Answer is
easy, and has already been given before; Chapt. 25. and chapter 29.
That every Christian Child or other Capable of being Catechized, are in the
first place bound to exercise that part of Free will whereby mankind is
radically and primarily distinguished from bruit beasts, that is, the Freedom
or power of Reflecting upon their own thoughts or Actions, or upon Others
advice or Counsel for casting off the yoke of Servitude to sin. Now the greater
Impotencie or want of Power any man finds in himself to set himself Free, or
to do well, the greater Opportunity and better Motives he has to beseech God
and the Son of God our Savior Christ, to set him Free, and to enable him to
do those things which being done he shall be set Free. For the Question is not,
nor ever ought to have been made, [Whether we have any Free Will or power to
make our selves Free, but; Whether we have a Free Will or some Ability to do
those things, which being done, we shall be made Free, which being left undone,
we have no Hope or probable Assurance that we shall be made Free Indeed by the
Son of God.]

4. Let Every one that is called a Christian and is not ashamed of the Cross of
Christ or of Baptism in his name, account it an open shame or Scandal both to
his Person and Profession, either to deny or suspect that he has not the same
measure of Free Will, (or a greater,) which Naaman the Syrian had, when he came
to the Prophet. Now he had a true Freedom of Will or choice of harkening or
not harkening to Good Counsel. The one Branch he exercised in not obeying the
Prophets Command: The other he practiced in hearkening to his Servants Advice
or Counsel. And it went better with him that he did so: For otherwise he might
have gone home a more grievous Leper then he came, and made himself incapable
of the Miracle wrought upon him by God alone. Let us Likewise account it a
shame to suspect, that we have not the same Freedom of Will; which the Widow
of Sarepta had. Now she had a true Freedom of Will or choice, either to
relieve or not to relieve the Prophet out of her small store. If she had not
relieved him, she and her Child might have died for hunger within few days
after. But she making choice of the better part of such Freedom of Will as she
had, was with her Child preserved alive by miracle. Let such as be Servants to
sin, as she was then, when the Prophet came to her, use that Portion of
Free Will which they have, either as well or not further amiss, then she did
hers: And the Lord (no doubt) will work as great miracles in and upon their
Souls, as he did upon her poor pittance of oil and meal. Let not any man that
professes himself the Servant of Christ, be more prone to Tempt God by
Distrusting, then to Try his Goodness by practicing the Like works of mercy
and charity, as that poor Widow did.

5. Even such amongst us are most conversant and busiest in the meddling or
market-way to Gain or Preferment, and by their several Trades or Callings which
they have made choice of, more obnoxious then other men are, to the temptations
of the Prince of this world, will scorn to be suspected not to have as much
Free Will, or Good Nature, or as good affection toward Christ and his Gospel,
as the Roman Soldiers or Publicans had unto John Baptists Person, or his
Doctrine of Repentance. And a Freedom of Will or ability they certainly have,
as well to be contented with their wages or Fees, and to deal Conscionably, as
to exact more then their due, or to oppress others by bribery, by extortion, or
unjust exactions. If they make choice of practicing this later Branch of such
Free Will as they have: this is but to take Earnest money to become hired
Servants unto Mammon. If they make choice of that part of Free Will which
Zachaeus did practice, that is, to be Charitable, Liberal to the poor, and to
make such Restitution as he did, to those whom they have wronged: then they
shall be made Children of Abraham, or (which is more) true Servants of God, and
of Christ, whose Service is perfect Freedom.

6. A brief Rule for right stating the Questions Concerning the Concurrence of
Grace and Free Will
Again, albeit not many of us (scarce Ten in any Age since the Apostles Times)
have any Freedom of Will or ability to determine or examine the Controversies
about the power of Grace and of Nature; about Justification or Election: yet
even the meanest amongst us have a Freedom of Will, either to say or not to
say their daily Prayers or Devotions; and a Like Freedom of Will, to frequent
or not to frequent the Solemn Prayers of the Church, and to hear them either
negligently, or attentively; and a Capacity withal to understand the meaning
of them, being expounded unto them by their ordinary Pastors or Catechists,
whom I could wish to make this, one special work of their Function.

7. For Conclusion, I shall commend to every Readers or Teachers Meditations,
that Prayer of the Church appointed to be read (amongst others) in the second
Service. [Prevent us, O Lord in all our doings with thy most Gracious Favor,
and further us with thy Continual Help, that in all our works begun, continued,
and ended in thee, we may glorify Thy Holy Name, and finally by thy mercy
obtain everlasting Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.] In the First part of
this Godly Prayer we have the State of the Question concerning the Concurrence
of Grace and Free Will, more pithily and more plainly set down, than in any
Controversie-writers, whether in the Romish or Reformed Churches. The Sum is,
that without Gods Preventing Grace, or peculiar disposition of his Favorable
Providence, we cannot do any Good Works at all, though but Civilly or Morally
Good, (as a Learned Jesuit acknowledges) nor any works Spiritually Good
without Gods assistant Grace or Gifts of the Spirit inherent in us. This is
that which is in the same Prayer Better expressed by The Furtherance of his
continual help. In the later Clause of the same Prayer [That in all our works
begun, continued and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally
by thy mercy obtain everlasting Life,] we have all (I am persuaded) that the
Romish Church would have said Concerning the Necessity of Good Works, Whether
unto Salvation or Justification; and all again that the Protestants have said
or can say, against the Romish Church, concerning Justification by Faith only,
without works. When we Pray, that we may glorify Gods Name by our good works;
this argues their Necessity unto Salvation, if not to Justification. And when
we pray, that after we have glorified Gods Name by our Good works, we may
attain Everlasting life, by Gods mercy in Christ, and through Christ: this is
an Argument most Concludent, that we must not rely upon, or put our Confidence
in the Best Works which we do, though we do them continually; but in Gods
Mercies, and Christ's Merits Only. And this is the Full and Lively Expression of
our Apostles meaning, when he says: We are Justified by Faith in Christ alone.
Finally, Let all of us remember this Lesson, that when it is said, We are to
Renounce Good works in the Plea of Faith, or all Trust
or Confidence in our Selves, or in our Merits or Works: This must always be
understood, of the Good works which we have done, not of the Good works which
we have left undone, much less of Works which we have done amiss. We must (as
our Savior instructs us, Luk: 14. ver. 26. and many other places) deny our
selves and forsake all, before we can be truly his Disciples. And we must be
truly his Disciples, before we can be made Free by Him Indeed, as is apparent
from the words of our Savior heretofore recited. Ioh. 8. 36. Let us therefore
beseech him which quenches not smoking Flax and crusheth not a bruised Reed,
to plant in us Good Intentions to grow by his Assisting Grace into Good
Desires; and good desires, into firm and constant Resolutions of doing that
which is good and acceptable in his sight; and finally to Crown our best
Endeavors wrought in us by his Grace with Everlasting Life and Glory through
His Mercy in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen, Amen.

The End of Chapt: 36. and of the Fifth Section.
Some Notes of the Publishers, relating to several Chapters preceding.
THough I hope the Strong and Learned will not boggle at those Terms
[Conversion Moral, Mortification Moral] in the 31. Chapter; Yet my heart
misgives me that They may be taken to Scandal by some Scrupulous but Wel-minded
and Pious Reader. And therefore, though what follows (of the Authors in that
Chapt. etc.) might well quiet such Readers mind (and ascertain him, That there
is no Snake, nor other Brood of the old Serpent, Latent under Those Herbs) yet
shall I out of my poor Talent, Contribute a poorer Mite toward his
Satisfaction; though only by casting an handful of dust into the Scale, which
may make some addition to the number, none at all to the weight of what the
Author himself has already there spoken to that Point.

Hor. Sermon. L. 1. Sat. 8.
1. We see what power Art has over Nature as to Materials Inanimate. The
Potter over foul Clay; The Cutter over hard Stone; The Carver or Carpenter over
knotty Carkases of Trees (which the Axe has reduced to the Capacity of
Stones;) the Finer and Founder over Oar and Metals: first to work, prepare,
and purify them; afterward of them to make, Olim truncus eram ficulnus,
inutile lignum, Cum faber incertus scamnum facereine Priapum, Masuit esse Deum;
Deus inde ego.
at pleasure, vessels of honor or of Basest use; to shape them into figures of
Beasts or Men, (not to say of Gods, though (...) or Aequivocal * Gods only; and
yet has besotted man adventured upon that Contradiction also, Isai. 44. 10.
etc.) Which Forms or new Qualities introduced; (rather educed E Potentia
materiae sive Naturali sive Obedientiali, or perhaps only discovered by the
Artist, who seems to add nothing to what was in the matter before) give us
cause to think, and say, There is a strange Alteration, Change, Tantum non
Conversion wrought in those Subject Materials. And now I have L^d the Reader
thus far out (if yet it be Out) of his way, let me carry him one Stones-Cast
further; and it is to show him Socrates's Meditation partly mixed of Admiration,
Diog. Laert. Lib. 2.
at the singular Care of Artists, partly of Indignation at the strange
negligence of Men: that Those should be so scrupulously careful to make their
statues so like unto men, and that These should be no more careful least by
their own sloth they should become (as Theocritus calls them) (...), like unto
statues. This Consideration the Satyrist has improved, and fixed upon his Gilded
Gallant, whom, having nothing good in him but his Parents-Bloud, nor any thing
like good about him but Clothes, Wealth, and Relations, he thus taxes. Juven.
Sat. 8. v. 53.

Hic petit Euphraten armis industrius. At Tu
Nil nisi Cecropides, Truncoque simillimus Hermae;
Nullo quippe alio vincis discrimine, quam quad
Illi marmoreum Caput est, Tua vivit imago.
That Poor-man's virtuous, Thus, and So; But you
Are meer-sheer-Pedegree, Hermes's Statue:
'Twixt which and you there is no'ther difference,
Save that It says nothing, you speak Nonsense.
But though Mercuries statue, according to this account, had a little the
Worse, yet had Memnons Effigies something the Better of Him; at least, if that
was true which Tacitus (in 2. Book of Annals) reports of it, that (Radiis icta
solaribus vocalem sonum reddidit, in Plain English, I dare not say, True) It
spoke; and if it did, we may not Count the words less then Apollo's Oracles.

*2. A power equal to, rather greater then the former, has Industry and
Culture over the next rank of Naturals, Vegetables. See the Lord Verulam's Not.
History. Cent. 6.
This is seen in such effects as spring from the Artificial modelling and
qualifying of Plants, far otherwise then they by nature were, or then, if
left to themselves and let alone, they would have been. Art has made barren
Trees fruitful, sour fruits sweet, and Crooked Plants straight. Art can form
even These (whose peculiar Tendencies, till they be superseded, incline more
powerfully then the former, quite another way) into better Resemblances or
Features, then nature left to its course would have produced. It can alter or
better them so much from what they were or would have been, as may give us
reason enough to give the same Attributes of Change, Alteration, Conversion,
and that with more proper Verification, to These, then to Inanimates. And
surely he that carefully Reads the 11. Chapt. to the Romans, and sees what use
the Holy Ghost has made of the Art of Ingraffing in General, (yet must it
not, though much to our present advantage, be dissembled, that the Metaphor is
highly improved there, and that the Antitype of Ingraffing is supernatural or
Contrary to nature; as, that an Evil Ciens should be Inoculated into a Good
Stock, and by virtue thereof be changed into the Goodness of the Stock; the
Practice of Art being to graffe a Good Ciens upon an Evil Stock which shall
meliorate, overrule, and change the ill juice of the Stock into the nature of
the Impe) will not grudge such Effects as are wrought by the Art of Ingraffing,
to be entitled so.

*3. But what a Largeness or Latitude of Power, Humane Industry has over the
Memory, the Imaginative and Loco-motive Faculties of Sensitives, is most
abundantly manifest. 1. In the Training of Horses even to Admiration, as has
been seen in our Time. 2.*Of Oxen, as those at Susae in Babylon, which after
they had gone so often, or so many Turns for water, could not with strkes be
forced to stir one foot more upon that Account. 3. In the Tutoring of
Elephants; Pliny in his Not. Hist. 8. l. 3. c. tells it upon the report of a
Creditable Roman, that saw an Elephant write a sentence of 30. or 40. Letters.
Suetonius (in Galba) tells of a New Show or Sight, Elephas Funambulus, one that
danced upon the Rope. Seneca Epist. 85. says, Domitores-feras docent pati

Irascible or Concupiscible, Experiments are frequent. Besides what is above
touch on out of Senaca, touching the Cicuration -- Ferae mansuescere jussae, of
the Tigre and of the Lion; The rare Exchange of Courtesies passed between
Androclus and the Lion, that made the people of Rome cry out, See the Story in
Aul. Gellius lib. 5. Cap. 14.
Lo here the Man that Cured the Lion, here the Lion that entertained the Man!
may well go for an Instance of a kindly Conversion. Leo homini homo, is better
far, then Homo homini Lupus. As that for the Irascible, so this next for the
Concupiscible. The Ravenage or voracity of Dogs is such, that the exorbitance
of a diseased appetite in man, is therefrom denamed, Caninus Appetitus. Out of
it, Poets (wise men in their Generations) frame Proverbs.

Nec Canis a Corio unquam deterrebitur uncto. Hor.
-- (...).
-- (...). Theocrit.
Yea the word of God has made the Proverb, Canis ad vomitum, Canonical. Yet may
the Appetite of this Creature, Enormous even to a Proverb, be so conquered and
habited by nurture and custom, (rather Dissuetude) that it shall have some
Lineaments of that Temperance, which the Pugiles or Athletae of old used, to
maintain their Bodies in Pancratical Plight for Masteries at all Points; and
which St. Paul thought worthy his notice, and used as a Motive to provoke
Christians to practice in an Heroical degree, and for attaining a Crown
incorruptible. Let Horaces Verses go for a Rule: Militat in Sylvis Catulus
venaticus, ex quo
Tempore cervinam pellem Latravit in aula. Epist. 2. lib. 1.



And let Lycurgus his Practice go for an Example: who took two whelps of one
Litter, or as some told it, Plut. de Liberis educ. and Lacon. Apophth
one an Hound, the other an House-Curre: This latter he trained up in hunting:
the Hound whelp he kept in the Kitchen continually at Trough: by which
severalty of Nurture the Nature of this became wholly disprincipled, where as
the others by constant training and restraint was advanced unto a degree of
Generosity which naturally it had not. In short, as if they had changed
Streines, The Curre became an Hound, the Hound turned Curre perfectly. Now the
effects of nurture in these, (this Inoculation of better Ciences in Animals)
must have a name, and without harm I hope (rather better then both the former)
may pass under the title of an Alteration, Change, or Turning. Or if these be
thought Terms too good, Let it be called A Turkizing of Sensitives.

*4. From these ascend we to the fourth Rank of Essences, The Rational; which
adds a Diadem of Excellency to the three degrees above mentioned, being an
Approach unto the Nature Angelical and Divine. Now, 1. In as much as the Human
Body partly agrees with the first Rank, of Materials Inanimate; So can Art
partly use it, as it uses them; to frame (rather to modify the Frame of) it
into great Variety: the Head thus, the Nose so, and other ductile Parts, as is
seen and read, after other Fashions. 2. Art can do something to the Body
answerable to what Gardiners do to Plants. If our Blessed Saviors words Matthew.
6. 27. deny all Possibility of adding Procerity or Talness to the Stature, yet
as the Lord Verulam notes, to make the Body Dwarfish, Crook-shouldred (as some
Persians did) to recover streightness or procure slenderness, is in the Power
of Art. But 3. much more Considerable Authority has it over the Humors; either
so to impel and inrage them, that like furious streams they shall dash the Body
(that Bottom wherein the precious Soul is embarked) against dangerous Rocks,
or run it upon desperate Sands; or so to attemper and tune them, that they
shall become like calm waters, or Harmonious Instruments for Virtuous Habits,
introduced by wholesome Moral Precepts, to practice upon. It is scarce credible
what service the Noble Science of Physic may do unto Moral (yea to Grace and
Christian) Virtue, by Prescribing diet to prevent, or medicine to allay the
Fervors and Eruptions of humors, of Blood, and of that Irriguum
Concupiscentiae, or, (...), Especially if these Jewels (their Recipe's) light

The Athenian women to keep themselves chaste, against their Thesmophoria, did
be-strow their Beds with the Herb (...), or, Vitex. Their professed Athletae did
wear Plates of Lead upon their Reins, to prevent the Illusions of Fancy, or
Blushful Accidents of Sleep. The Egyptian * Priests abstained wholly from
Salt, as having in it an Urtica, or Incentive of Salacitie. Some Religious

Who knows not, that to be without Apparel was not nakedness or shameful, till
forbidden Diet made it so? St. Austin notes, That Situs membrorum shows Ordinem
vitiorum; Sins of the Belly beget sins of Lust. Monstrum esset Libido sine
Gula, says Tertullian. Wisely therefore did Pythagoras rank his Praecepts (of
Diet) in such order.

(...), Magna pars Libertatis est venture been moratus. Sen. Epist. 123.
(...).
(...).
.
First watch thy Belly, Secondly thy Sleep,
Thirdly thy Lust. Pure Thinning Diet keep.
And this he kept himself, being of the Primitive Diet, abstaining wholly from
Flesh; and because of some Resemblances (which Lucian * takes notice of) from
some sorts of Pulse also; In his Dialogue called.
For which, Horace Sermon. l. 2. Sat. 6. Smiling, Calls, Faba Pythagorae Cognata.
This I suppose True; (...).
But if any man long to see it gainsaid, Let him see what one Aristoxenus (had
it been Philoxenus that Gluto nobilis, I should more have suspected it) says,
in Aul. Gell. l. 4. c. 11.

All these forementioned helps of bettering Nature, are within Her Lowest and
Middle Region of Diet and Medicine. Step we up into her Third Story and see
what Remembrances we find there, of those rare Effects which Moral Precepts
have wrought (Correspondent to Inoculation in Plants) not only in Towardly, but
upon depraved Inclinations, whose Biasses and corrupt Bents have been so
altered thereby, -- Gaudet Patientia duris, Laetior est quoties magno sibi
constat Honestum. Claud.
that their Affections have been taught to Hunt Counter for pleasure, and seek
Delights in Difficulties and Duresses; to take Contentment in denying
themselves Content; and with much pleasure to detest Pleasure (that Sorceress,
which as Aristotle observes, is born with us, incorporate and ingrained in us,
being sucked in with our first milk:) Despectare procul, To look down upon it
with scorn, as upon the Covering of their Feet, -- Vitanda est Improba Siren
Desidia. Hor.
or an Excrement of Nature; to reckon it, not only as a Nullo or Cipher that
multiplied man's Account, but as a mere Vacuum, or Nothing. (...), Said
Diogenes. (Laert. lib. 6.) Omnis voluptas pro Nihilo Deputanda est, said
Tullie: and his Reason is, quod, cum praeterierit, perinde sit ac si nulla
fuisset.

I shall now prove this by Instance; and that I may imitate Nature (which non
facit Saltum) I will do it first in Younglins, whose Age defines Them by
Appetite, they being but few degrees in nature removed from Wild Asses Colts.
Plutarch (in Lacon: Apophth:) tells of a Spartan Stripling that had stolen (a
young Theif) or Fox-Cub; which being sought and he searched, as it lay pressed
within his clothes near his Body, did so gnaw his bowels, that he dyed on it.
This the poor Man (the nearness to his End and his great Tolerance name him
so) endured with all Imaginable Constancy, according to the Discipline of his
Country, never the least quelching at it, Saying, It was better to dye, then by
crying to be discovered. Another, ex Eodem Ludo, fighting with his Compeer, was
by him wounded to the death; yet when he heard his friends threaten death to
the Killer. O Do it not, said he, for it is unjust. I had a Venie or 'Bout for
it, and the Intent, though not the Hap, to kill him. I expect to hear; Both
these did uti bono animo in re mala. Was not this Virtue better placed then (at
least in the General) in that Child whose office was, as I remember, at
Alexanders Solemn Sacrifice, (to be (...), that is) to hold a Torch? The melted
wax dropped, and burnt, and stam'd upon his flesh somewhile, yet did he (as his
Rules of Reverence obliged him) endure this Torment with such Constancy as that
he never the least changed Posture, nor I think Color for it.

Let us now look up higher and take out some Graver Examples. Socrates
confessed to the wonder of all, that Zopyrus the Physiognomer said True, when
he Stigmatized rather then Charactered him (not to his Credit; namely) for A
Man of Vile Affections; I was so inclined indeed, said that Saint and Martyr of
Nature, But Philosophy, Philosophy, that has quite altered me. Aequal to
this his Chastity was his Charity toward his Accusers; but far above the
ordinary size of that Virtue with us. What one is there amongst the higher
sorts of Christians (as they be called and would be thought, who, though not
ignorant of the Measure or purport of that Glorious and Holy Name, that it not
only caryes an Olive Leaf in the mouth, but is wholly made up of Oil, and
signifies a man composed of Honey and Balm, of Love and Meekness;) that does
not in Point of Self-Revenge, bow down his Soul to that most Accursed Principle
of the first Murderer, and of Cain his First-begotten Son in Blood? Yea that
would not think it a shame to be thought afraid or unwilling upon Occasion to
Subscribe to it with his hand or sword in Letters of Blood: as it should be
printed.

Est vindicta Bonum vita jucundius ipsa. Yet does the poor purblind Ethnic
Satyrist methinks heartily detest it, reason right against it, and prove it to
be no better then the Qualm or Ferment of a Female Spirit.

Nempe hoc indocti! quorum praecordia nullis
Interdum aut Levibus videas flagrantia Causis:
Quantulacunque, adeo est Occasio sufficit Irae.

Juven. Sat. 13. v. 180.
Sweet is revenge, sweeter then life itself!
The rude Assertion of some waspish Elf,
Made all of Tinder, Touchwood, Sulphur, Ire,
Who at each puff or spark, fures, flashes fire,
And thunders out, My right hand is my God;
Vengeance is mine, My sword's my Iron Rod,
Dubbs My-self judge, my will saw, right or wrong;
Wounds, blood, kill or be killed, hell heaven's a song.
Bear an Affront? rather Damnation.
Chrysipp said no such word, nor Thales, nor
Saint Socrates made all of Honey, for
Though he durst dye, and smiling drink the Cup of
Chill Hemlock, yet durst he not wish one sup of
It in's Accusers heart; Good health to Him
He drunk in Cup of Charity full brimme.
Revenge is Cow'rdize, below Man. Revenge is
Th'Abortive Lust or Longing of She-Twinges.
And yet to do right to that Sex, and in memory of a most Tender Mother, I
know not whether Livia or Augustus deserved greater praise for a most Solemn
remarkable piece of Pardoning mercy. De Clem. lib. 1. c. 9.
Seneca tells it Curiously; I thus. L. Cinna conspired against Augustus, who had
not only forgiven the Enmity of war, but regiven him his Estate, and conferd
Honors upon him, to the Envy of his own Party. The Time, place, partners,
manner of the plot was discovered to Augustus, who intended to revenge it.
Livia seeing him Troubled, comes to Him, Saying, Sir, Will you once take a
Woman's Counsel? Then truly forgive him; it may do you Good; the Plot being
known, it cannot hurt you. Augustus thanks Livia for playing the Advocate;
sends for Cinna, cleares the room, and makes him sit down by him, injoines him
no other punishment, but with Silence and Patience to hear an Excellent speech
of above Two Hours Long setting forth his Falt and Caesar's mercy, dismisses
him with these words; I gave thee life before as an Enemy, now I give it thee
as a Traitor. Let us henceforth be Friends, and vie, Vtrum Ego meliore side
vitam tibi dederim, an Tu debeas. This was partly the effect of That Charm
which Athenodorus gave Augustus against Anger: See Seneca.
To say over the 24. Letters. I cannot forbear to mention an Example or Two
more out of Seneca. De Ira l. 3. c. 23.
1. Among other Athenian Ambassadors that came to Philip of Macedon, Demochares
(for his ill Tongue surnamed Parrhesiastes) was one. Philip treated them very
benignly, asking them what courtesy they wanted that was in his power?
Demochares, with most prodigious Barbaritie, unexpectedly answered; That Philip
might do the Athenians a Great kindness, if he pleased to hang himself. The
Hearers Gnasht their teeth for Indignation, But the King, quieted them, and
dismissed him safe, only bidding His Fellows tell their Masters of his courtly
Faculty in Complements. The 2. of Diogenes the Stoic. He was reading a
Lecture About Anger, when, lo, on a sudden comes in an Impudent Youth, and
spits in his Face: Cap. 38.
thinking perhaps to try whether himself had learned what he Taught; as he had
indeed, for not moved at all he said, I am not yet, but I begin to doubt
whether I ought not to be angry at this. A 3. Was Cato minor, who when
Lentulus, in the face of the Court, most contumeliously, spit in his Face, said
no more then this, Affirmo, Lentule, falli eos qui Negant te habere Os. St.
Basil. 1. Tom. 24. Hom. Tells this of one Pericles: A Circumforaneus Base
Fellow railed on him bitterly for a whole day together, This he endured with
much patience, and with more kindness lighted him home at night. 2. Of Euclide
of Megara: A Man in his Rage swore he would kill him; He again swore, that if
he did, he would take it patiently, forgive him, and be reconciled unto him. 3.
Of Socrates, who having sufferd a Fellow with great Patience to beat his Face
black and blew, did no more, but lay upon the Spots A Paper inscribed, (...).
This Deed of his, says St. Basil, was (...), near of Kin to that Duty Enjoined
by our Savior; To him that smites thee on the one Cheek -- As the Former two
to Christ's other Precept, Do good to them that hate you --. And sure from him
did Plato (in Crito) learn that Axiom of peace, (...) He has hurt himself in
wronging me; De Ira. lib. 2.
I will not hurt my self by wronging him, Cap. 32.
said Epictetus. Lips. Not.
Non ut in Beneficiis honestum est, merita meritis repensare, ita injurias
injuriis, Illic vinci turpe est; hic vincere. Inhumanum verbum est (and pro
justo receptum) Ultio. -- Qui dolorem regerit, tantum excusatius peccat. says
Seneca.

Our next Instance shall be Themistocles, the Turpitude of whose youth was
branded by his Fathers Abdication of him, and executed by his poor Mothers
hanging her self for grief at his Lewd Courses, yet was this young Man so
reformed by Philosophy that he became the best blood of Greece. Clarissimus
virorum Graij sanguinis, says Val. Maxim. l. 6. c. 9. and the Center upon which
did sway the Reciprocating hopes and despaires of Europe and Asia.

We mentioned before Pythagoras's Rules for diet; Those he laid as the grounds
of Moral virtue: Upon these with good success, he raised Fair Structures of
Justice and Moderation, yea some of (...) Religion too.

That Praecept of his, (...) Fear an Oath; made such an Impression upon Clinias
Pythagoricus, one of his Scholars, that, when, in a Suit depending before the
Judges, he might, by taking a True and Just Oath, have freed himself from a
Fine of three Talents, he chose rather to pay down the mulct, then by swearing
truly, to avoid it. He held not so much money so much worth as to call God to
witness and judge about it. Nec Deus inter sit nisi Dignus vindice nodus
Inciderit --. Whether every Reader will think this worthy his Notice, I know
not, This I know, S. Basil thought it worthy His. See his 1. Tom. Hom. 24. De.
Legend. Libr. Gentil.

Another of his precepts was (...) Let your prayers be Vocal. I suppose he was
not ignorant, that God could hear Mental prayers: and that he considered not
the Angels, who can understand words, but not Thoughts. His Design then was;
Tollere de Templis murmurque, humilesque, susurros --.
O si nunc Patrui praeclarum funus! See Persius.
and O si
Pupilli! Satyra. 2.
Nerio jam tertia ducitur Vxor.


To teach men to put up to God Pure Prayers; not such as they would shame that
Honest Men, nay the vilest of Men, should hear. Quae nisi seductis nequeas
committere Divis. Such as were fit for none but Devils to be of Counsel or
Advocates in. Such as Horace, Epist. 16. Lib. 1. Detests and derides thus.

-- Pulchra Laverna,
Da mihi fallere; da sanctum justumque, videri:
Noctem peccatis, and fraudibus objice nubem.
Laverna Fair! teach me the Holy cheat;
Though Goat or Wolf, to seem Saint Lamb, and bleat
To Gild Sin, cloud, or justify Deceit.
In sum, His meaning was to Teach men Aperto vivere voto; So to speak to God
as if men heard; (To which other Philosophers have added another cla^se;) So
speak to Men as in Gods hearing. Seneca Lipsij. Epist. 10. Macrob. Saturnal. l.
1. And For this we have the Authority of Clemens Alexandrinus. Stromat. Lib. 4.
Fine. These for Religion, the next for Justice.

Seneca 7. l. de Benef. 21. c. has a story of a Pythagorean that had bought a
pair of shoes upon Trust, and at length coming to pay for them, found the
Shoemaker dead and the Shop shut up; whereupon he went home shaking the money
in his Hand, and well pleased with the chink of it, as who should say, this is
clear gain: but Lo suddenly his heart smote him for having ^oy'd in such a
poor but unjust Thing, back he speeds to the Shop, says to himself, Ille tibi
vivit, Tu read quod debes: and so put the money in through a Crevice or the
Keyhole of the Door, laying this, Nomine poenae, as a Fine or Amercemem upon
himself for his evil Covetize, and to teach himself, Ne alieno assuesceret,
hereafter not to long for other men's Goods. Christian Reader look about and
find me such faith here in this our Israel.

And for matter of Moderation, how happy his Endeavors were, so Justin (20.
Book.) The Crotonians being vanquished by the Locrians desperately cast of all
Practices of Virtue, Military or Moral. And but for Pythagoras had been quite
overrun with Luxury. He, having travailed through Egypt, Babylonie, and
Lacedaemon, and Learnt the Laws of Minos Lycurgus, etc. did, with them, and his
own Authority added to them, so indefatigably 'plye that people; that at last,
what by praising Frugality as the Mother of all Virtue, what by inveighing
against Luxury, and numbering the sad Examples of Cities destroyed thereby:
exhorting sometime the graver sort of Women to Modesty and Dutifulness,
sometime their Youth to soberness and Industry; prevaild so much by this
assiduity of discoursing, that the Women were persuaded to leave off all
wearing of Gold, to cast away all their Ornaments of Dignity as filthy ensigns
of Luxury, to bring them all into Juno's Temple, and there consecrate and Leave
them. Their Youth also he reduced to an excellent Temper, as may be collected
from the Cure he wrought upon the women whom he taught to forget their beloved
Ornaments. And here I cannot forbear but I must appeal to my Reader and ask him
sadly and seriously whether he thinks that if St. Chrysostom, or St. Austin
were now here alive again upon earth, and should desire him to pick out and
point unto them, the best (as he thought) of those our Cities that most
^lagrantly Profess Christianity, wherein they might hope with most
probability of success to attempt the like Cure of vanity either in women or
men; he could promise Those Holy Fathers any hopes that they should speed so
well amongst Christians, as Pythagoras did amongst the Crotonians. Whether he
thinks, that at this Time (this Juncture, or rather this Fracture, of Time,
when at Gods chiding, the Springs of water are seen, the Foundations of the
world are discovered; when his wrath being kindled, yea not a little, he has
stained the Pride of Glory, and still calls aloud to weeping, and to mourning,
and to baldness, and to girding with Sackcloth, Isai. 22. 12. when Spots, and
paint, and powder, Glorious and strange Array, seem to be as Ominous to men, as
the Gilded Horns and Ribbons were to the white Oxen that were suddenly to be
sacrificed) They could persuade any Ten wanton Young Men but to observe that
Rule of the Apostle prescribed women; whose adorning, let it not be that
outward, of plaiting Hair, wearing Gold, or donning Apparel, but the Dress of
the Inner-man, the heart and Spirit, with ornaments of Grace. Or any Five
Daughters of Sion that walk (according to Ovids Rule) with Stretched-out necks,
to cover themselves Decently (as those Fathers should judge, or as themselves,
or their Mothers had judged sometime Decent.) Though they should be allowed to
do it with the most precious Riches of the East, Silk, and Pearl, and the
Gold-plate of Vphaz. Yet was Affected Curiosity of Hair and Dress in men, so
monstrous, even in the sight of that Monster of Mankind Seneca de Ira l. 2. c.
33.
Caligula, that he put a Young Gentleman to Death, for it, Munditiis ejus, and
cultioribus capillis offensus. And nakedness so odious in the sight of Modest
heathen women, that, Clemens Alex: Strom: 4. l. reports it in praise of a
certain Mulier Lysidica, who, (...), used to go into the Bath, with her clothes
on.

And yet I fear, (or Fancy) some Reader that could not do This, would grudg
to Allow the Crotonian Reformation the Honor to be styled a Moral Conversion.
* S. August* Tom. 7. l. 1. Contr. Julian. Cap. 7. and 4. and Epist. 130. and
more places, where he Takes notice of Polemo.
Will he then allow that Title to our Next Instance? Which I will commend, that
though few do imitate, yet some may admire it. It is of Polemo the debaucht
Athenian Ruffian, Perditae Luxuriae adolescens, says Val. Maxim. l. 6. c. 9.
who upon a time having made an end of his accustomed All-night Revels by that
time of the Morning that Xenocrates was at his moral Lecture in the Schools,
and having occasion, as it fell out, to pass that way, struck into the School,
with design rather to jeer and affront the Grave Philosopher now busy at
Lecture, then to learn any thing of him. He seeing Polemo come in such a pickle
as a Pernox Convivator must needs be, and besides, in a prodigious aequipage
and Garb of Luxury, crowned with Rose-Buds, and hung with all the Imaginable
Fanes, Labels, and Swadling-Bands of Fancy, composed his Countenance to the
utmost dimensions of Gravity, removed his discourse (whereupon he was when
Polemo came in) into the Theme of Temperance, and this he pursued with so much
Sweetness, Power, and Eloquence, (without taking any notice of him whom he most
thought on) that this Younker began first to startle as one waked out of a
Trance, then to look up toward Xenocrates as soberly as he could, next he
stole his Garland off his head, and laid it from him, after that, he pulled his
Arms in under his cloak, and otherways expressed what effect that morning
Lecture had upon him; in sum, he went out of the School a clean other man,
Mutatus Polemo, changed even to a Proverb, and turned so constant a Student and
good Proficient in Morality, that he succeeded his Master in his School.

-- Hic vir, hic est quem quaerimus; but where shall we find the like amongst
Christians? An hundred of our sorry Lectures scarce produce one such Convert, I
mean Like and Such in proportion to the means of Grace tenderd in Christ Jesus.

-- quaero, Hor. Sermon.
faciasne quodolim
Mutatus Polemo, L. 2. Sat. 3.
ponasne insignia morbi,
Fasciolas, cubital, focalia? potus ut ille
Dicitur ex collo furtim carpsisse coronas,
Postquam est impransi correptus voce Magistri.
This Cure he wrought upon an other (upon many disadvantages) but you will ask
perhaps, had the Physician heald himself? yes, it seems he had got an excellent
Magisterium or (...) against that Epidemical putrid Hereditary disease of
mankind, Lust. Phryne (that Nobile Scortum Atheniense, as Val. Maxim. L. 4. c.
3. calls her) had laid a wager with some of her Customers, that she would
conquer Continence and this Philosopher both at once. To him she comes at an
opportunity not ordinary, when the man was Been potus (perhaps this signifies
not what ill it sounds, but only Plenitude) uses all the immodest Arts and
Modes she had to allure him; It may endanger the modesty of some sort of
Readers, to write what she did, though it moved him no more then a Dead man; in
short, she did tempt him to the utmost, yet was not He tempted, but received
this Testimony of Chastity, from Harlotry it self; That he was invincible.

I presume the Objection, that this was a natural Deadness, no Mortification
Moral; A cold Palsy Fit of Age, no voluntary Continence. I say then, 1. They
be weak Authors that report it to us, and so admire it themselves. 2. Sure,
They were both wiser and Honester, then to commend unto Posterity, Impotencie
in stead of Exemplary Virtue. 3. He seemed as free from the proper vice of old
Age, 1. Orat. de Fort. Alex. M.
as from that of Youth. Plutarch tells it of him, that he Refused 50. Talents
sent him by Alexander the Great, with this excuse or reason returned, (...).
Philosophy had taught him, not to Contract or amasse wealth, but to shrink up
his desires.

So had it taught others. 1. Crates the Rich and Noble Theban, who cast 200.
Talents of Silver into the Sea; Diog. Laert. Lib. 6.
or as some say, into the common Bank, upon Condition, that if his sons were
Idiots, they should have it again. If Philosophers, he reckoned they would not
need wealth, and then it should be given to the People. This same Crates, when
Alexander asked him if he would have his Country repaired, said no; Another
Alexander would come and spoil it again. But he had a Country (...), Built upon
poverty and Contempt of Honor, which none could impair. 2. Aristippus, who,
though none of the strict ones, is said to have cast his Gold into the Sands of
Libya.

-- Quid simile isti
Graecus Aristippus? qui servos proijcere aurum.
In media jussit Libya, quia tardius irent
Propter onus Segnes -- Hor. Sermon. l. 2. Sat. 3.
3. D. Laert. 10. Lib.
So had Philosophy taught Epicurus himself. For though he kept his Estat^,
(thinking that Pythagoras's Community was a sign of dissidence, not of
Friendship) and very handsomely disposed of it by Will after Death; Yet was he
content with so small a proportion, (the total of his Pleasure in a manner
consisting of a Garden, and Freedom from Pain) That Juvenal thought his Quantum
worthy to be made the Standard of Moderation or Competencie.

-- Mensura tamen quae
Sufficiat Census, Juven Sat. 14. Fine.
si quis me consulat, Edam.
In quantum Sitis, atque fames, and frigora poscunt;
Quantum Epicure Tibi parvis suffecit in hortis*
Quantum Socratici Ceperunt ante Penates.
And well he might propose him for an example; for Laertius says, that this Man
so defamed through all the world for a Beast, was Content with bread and water
for the first, and with Cheese for the second Course. And Stobaeus brings him
in bragging of the Lushious pleasure he found in such Cheer: (...) -- So does
Seneca Epist. 2. quo^e him triumphing and pronouncing, Honesta res est Laeta
paupertas. And beside other great store of such wholesome senses of His, stuck
thick in many other Epistles, in the 18* and 20, he exhorts Lucilius,
Imaginaria Paupertate se exercere ad veram; redigere se ad parva unde cadere
non possit; praeoccupare tela fortunae, to set apart 3. or 4. or more days
together for Fasting, and to do it in good Earnest, with so slender and course
fare, Seneca Epist. 66. and 92.
and Courser Clothing, ut non sit Lusus, sed experimentum. Liberaliora ut sint
alimenta Carceris; that a Gaol could not worst him. Laert. l. 10.
In a word, so to bare himself, to descend so low, that Fortune it self, doing
its worst, could not Pinch him; but that he might with the plain wise man
Ofellus, who it seems had endured (Dura Belli) all the Consequences of war,
challenge her and say Saeviat, atque novos moveat Fortuna Tumultus:
Quantum hinc imminuet? Hor. Sermon. l. 2. Sat. 2.
quanto aut ego parcius, aut vos
O pueri nituistis, ut huc novus Incola venit?


And all this he does from the Precepts of diverse noted men, and from ^e
monthly Practice of some others, and amongst these of Epicurus who had such set
days of Fasting. Certos habebat dies ille magister voluptatis Epicurus, quibus
malign famem extingueret --. non toto Ass pasceretur --. And as his life so
his death seems to have been a very Calm. For lying, In officina voluptatis,
in Torments of the Stone ready to expire, after 14. days Patience, he writes to
Idomaeneus, Beatissimum hunc and ultimum diem ago --.

To conclude; Bonum tuum quid? Animus purus, Aemulator Dei --. Sen. Ep. 124.
if Plato's Philosophy was as it praetended, an Assimilation to God, it was a
Moral Conversion, or Furbishing up of the poor Relics of Gods Image R^maining
in the Conscience of the Natural man. If it was a Meditation of Death, it was a
Moral Mortification. Now whether this was a main Branch both of His and others,
I refer my self to their Books, Epict. Arrian. L. 2. c. 14.
especially to Seneca's, which have whole swarms of Good Advisements, such as
These; Magnares est, and diu discenda, cum adventat Hora illa inevitabilis,
aequo animo abire. Tumortem, ut nunquam Timeas, (...).
semper Cogita. Epist. 30. which in Sanctified Translation, is, He that will
not fear Death must dye daily. Quando dabitur omnibus oppressis affectibus hanc
vocem emittere Vici? (...).
quem vicerim quaeris? non Persas -- sed avaritiam -- metum mortis, qui
victores gentium vicerit. Sen. Ep. 71.

Let there be no strife about Words, or Names. Till we have agreed to coin
better new ones, let us keep the old. Conversion is a kind of Protean Term,
fitted, in various Analogy to Logic, Physics, Ethics, not appropriate to
Theology; and may in good equity be Predicated on some of the foreinstanced
Moral Changes. So may Repentance. Non tanti em^m poenitere, said Demosthenes.
Quem peccasse poenitet pene est innocens, says Seneca the Tragaedian. Scelerum
si been poenitet, Eradenda tibi sunt prava cupidinis Elementa, says Horace.
Carm. l. 3.
(...), Ode. 24.
says Hierocles. It cannot be denied but some of the aforesaid Acts were Acts
of Self-Denial, Actual Forsaking all. Vlisses's Tying himself to the Mast (or
the Moral of it) me thinks is a kind of Taking up his Cross: yet should I not
dare to call it so, but that the Phrase (...), is used in Plutarch. De sera
Number: Vindicta.

Nor is Mortification a Term Peculiar to Divinity. There is a Vicious
Mortification; to kill or cast out one Vice by another, more contrary to Gods
Law then to it self. As Prodigality with Covetize; Libertism with Schism;
Presumption with Despair: and e contra. So a less Vice with a greater; as to
put off Pride in Apparel, and cloth our selves with spiritual Pride. To dead
the Appetite and quicken the Affections. As some Weeds, or Vermin destroy
others; and Devils will go out upon Compact. Qui in Agone decertant ab omnibus
continent, ut corruptibilem Coronam accipiant; 7. To Lib. 4. c. 3. Cont. Jul.
a cujus tamen vana cupiditate non continent. Haec enim Cupiditas vana as per
hoc prava, vincit in eis, and Fraenat alias cupiditates, propter quod dicti
sunt Continentes, S. Austin. There is a Superstitious Mortification. Such, or
worse, a degree of Suicidium, Was Baals-Priests Cutting and Lancing, and such
like as is said to be be used still by some, not Christians, in Remote Parts.
Such is that of some few Christians, who think they do God service in making
the Body unserviceable. S. Paul's practice was. 1. (...), To take all fair hold
or advantage to throw and keep it down (as Wrestlers do the Bodies of their
Adversaries) lest Iniquitas Calcanei danger to supplant us in our Race for the
prize. And 2. (...), To make the Body Tributarie or servant; yet so, that the
Brute might have the use, not the Excess of his Masters Crib; might be strong,
to Labor, though not to lust. But far more, God knows, are Ventris
Mancipia, Slaves that pay tribute of all Creatures in kind, to their Belly;
(...), as St. Basil says. Hom. 24.

And subservient to S. Paul's end, there is a medicinal Mortification.
Narcoticks in this kind might be useful. Any Bodily Pain, (Dolor) is a good
Physical help against ordinary Paroxisms of Lust. So is Labor or taking pains,
Otia si tollas --. (...) said Diogenes; and if love be the Business of
Holy Day men, or Idle Persons; Honest Employment is a fit Pin to drive it out.

Lastly there is a Moral Mortification by Rules of Reason; For surely Reason is
not disenabled by being a Forma Informans, or in the same soul and subject with
sense; that it cannot master the lower soul in Man, as well as it can do the
Appetite of Bruits, where, at best, it Resembles but an Assistent or external
Form.

I have yet one thing to do, and that is, to Amolish the suspicion of praising,
much more of vending what has been long a-broach, such spoiling Philosophy, as
in in its Essence includes Enmity to the Ineffable and Free saving Grace of God
in Christ Jesus. My Answer to them that examine me anent that Point, is This.
If the Apologizer offend, who will make a Defense for him? If I build up what I
pretend and ought to destroy, I make my self a double Transgressor; having as
bountifully as many others been offered, and daily needing more extraordinary
influx of Grace then any other does. Lord keep thy servant from Prides and
Presumptuous sins. -- He that once dares say with Mezentius, Dextra mihi Deus
est; or the Epicurean Porker, Animum aequum mi ipse parabo: My own Right hand
shall bring Salvation; will soon fall from one wickedness to an other; from
Trust in himself, to deny or Defye God; into an impudent mind or Gyant-like
temper, De Ira. lib. 1. in fine.
to cry as* Seneca says Caligula did to Jove when it thunderd, (...). The Lord
God of Gods he knows, and let all Israel know, that though I have cu^ up in
the Wolds of Gentilism, and laid together a Turf or two; it is not with intent
to make an Altar thereof, much less to proclaim them for such Sacrifices
wherewith God is well pleased. Yet if any will say that I have put fire
thereon, and that they see it Flame; Ex Cinere Ethnicorum flat Lixivium
Christianorum.
I assure them I will make no other use of the Ashes, but to make a Lee to
besprinkle and besmart my own and the eyes of such other sluggish Christians,
lest whilst we sleep these Philosophers get Heaven before us. I have scraped up
these Crusts or Limbs of Antiquity to try, (...), if by these foolish people,
or Natures Wise men, I might anger my own flesh into a Godly Jealousy or
Emulation to outstrip them, as far in proportion as our Means excel theirs. And
if I have not rather done it for Fear of this thing, That these poor Ghosts or
Corpses of Virtues Heathen, as well as persons, should rise in Judgment and
condem us Christians, who care not to adorn our holy Profession, with such, not
in any degree of proportion such Good Works as the Primitive Christian Worthies
did. From whose Heroical Degrees of Virtue we are degenerated, as far as
Pigmies are from the Giants of old. Not by Reason of any Wane or decay of the
Grace of God, as if that were feebler now, then, when, coming forth as a
Bridegroom of Beauty or Giant of strength, it begun first to Reign through
righteousness, or was at first shed abroad in the hearts of the faithful; But,
that we, a Generation of Formal sinful Men, by making God to serve with onr
sins, and his Spirit to 'tend and wait till we were pleased to be weary of
them, have grieved that holy Spirit, and what by receiving the Grace of God in
vain, what by turning it into Laciviousnesse, have vex't and quenched the same.

To do these Gentle Virtues right then, and give them their due; for it is not
fit, Virtutes invertere. Many, most, almost all the forementioned, were Good
for the Matter, Substance, Bulk, Being the Things of the Law. Many of them were
sparklings of the light of Nature, which like Glowworms made some show in the
night: Apol. Cap. 27
in Tertullians Hyperbole, Testimonia animae naturaliter Christianae. Dictates
or Notions of Conscience, the Humane Spirit or Lamp of the Lord, Satisfac

41. These Egyptian Jewels were Ornaments to the Persons that wore them, and
worth our Borrowing and Polishing, and Consecrating toward the Adorning of the
Tabernacle. They had some good Influence upon the Generations and Communities
where they were Acted. Contra. Jul. Pelag. Lib. 4. Cap. 3.
And as they were not effected without Gods good Providence (as St. Austin
observes, that all the Various dispositions or Temperaments of Men are not) so
they passed not without some notice taken by his Bounty, or Temporal Reward
given them by God. And at the Great Day of Recompenses shall have considerable
Allowance or abatement, as to Degrees of Punishment; Minus enim Fabricius quam
Catilina punietur, non quia iste bonus, sed quia ille magis malus; Ibid.
and minus impius, quam Catilina, Fabricius, non veras virtutes habendo, sed a
veris non plurimum Deviando. So, S. Austin, and Mr. Hooker of Cambridge, has,
to my remembrance a very sad saying to that purpose and not to be gainsaid; The
Pagan and the Philosopher shall have a cool summer Parlour in Hell in
comparison of the Debauched Christian. But we have a surer Word of the Great
Prophets --; it shall be more easy for Sidon and Sodom two sinks of sin, then
for Chorazin and Capernaum Two despisers of Grace. O that we could believe what
strange unconceivable Confusion will seize upon the Belial Christian, when he
shall see the Queen of the South and men of Nineveh Condemn the Jew; and hear
the Pythagorean and Epicurean (impanneld into one Jurie) sentence the
Graceless vile Christian. When we shall see Christians damned, for cheating
one another, out of Tullies Offices; and subtle Seraphical Scholars for ill
manners, sentenced without Book, out of the Law written in the hearts of
Analphabet Idiots: when it would be counted a favor, Far above Dives's
desire, if God would grant it, Sit Animamea cum Philosophis. All which (in
effect) shall be, if we be not more free from Vice, or not better Vertued, then
these forementioned Philosophers were; whose works as they were done and raised
up, so are their writings preserved by Gods Providence to yield us provoking
Examples to imitate, and by the help of Gods Grace to outstrip and excel. The
Pharisees were Fasters, Prayers, Sabbath-keepers, abhorred Idols, Tythed
strickly, and I think reverenced the Sanctuary; far, I am sure, far
excelled the Ethnic Heroes, yet except the Righteousness of us Christians
exced theirs, our Portion shall be with those Hypocrites, Ar. Epict. l. 1. c.
14. Shut doors; draw Curtains!
as theirs was with others.

And that we may the better know what we have to excel, take notice; that some
Heathens were Excellent, did their work cum Intuitu; with an Eye to God, though
(...), and to the Immortality of the Soul. y are not alone.
And they that sometimes doubted of both, reasoned well. I Will reckon that the
Soul is Immortal, God is within.
said Tully; That Is the surest way. If it be so, I shall meet the Mortalist,
and tell him he was deceived, if it be not, he shall never tell me so. Either
there is A God, or Democritus's Atoms; said Marcus Aur. Antoninus. If there be
a God, his Providence will take care of me and the rest of the world, I will
depend upon him. If nothing but Chance; who would care for such a World where
all things fall out at Adventure. Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 4. wonders at
Epicharmus's expression: With the pure Soul it shall go well after death. See
Voss. Hist. Pelag. l. 3. part. 3.


And as to the particular End; many of their Actions were Right. S. Aug. T. 3.
de Spir. and Lit. c. 27. says, There were some Facts of the heathen, Quae
secundum justiuae regulam non solum vituperare non possumus, verum etiam merito
recteque laudamus. S. Jerome. in Ep. ad Gal. Cap. 1. says more, that some were
done vel sapienter, vel Sancte. As to Honor Parents, give Alms, do as they
would be done to. Non tamen haec tribuens dederim quoque caetera --. I must
take heed, lest while I do these virtues Civil right, I sacrilegiously wrong
the Grace of God. I therefore (yet protesting my Lothnesse to judge those that
are without; especially in any thing that looks like goodness:) thus tax these
gentile Virtues. 1. They were sick of diverse Privative Defects. The Spring was
foul, (not washed with the water that issued out of Christ's side) not purified
by Faith; which is the (...), in his Clem. Alex. Strom. L. 2.
Judgment who is held one of the Gentiles Best friends. Faith animated, and
acting by Love. L. 4. Cont. Jul.
Some of their Love was but a kind of Dilectio Babylonica, as S. Austin says.
That which made the Decij, mori pro patria, was (not Charity inspired (...);)
but sucks from the Breasts and sweetness of their native soil. Some of their
Virtues were Hybridae, Spurious Mungrels, begot by Vices. S. Austin says,
Covetize made some prudent, temperate, valiant, industrious, Per mare pauperiem
--, yea in some things just. Some but Apes of True Virtue, like the
Circumcision used by Nations not in Covenant. Some were monstrous, made up of
Contradictions to their own Rules. Diogenes was content with a little; yet held,
Sacrilege lawful, and Mans-flesh Mans-meat. Like Rowers, they look^ o^e way
and went another. 2. Mostly they fell short of the End: the great universal
right End; Gods Glory. Those few that aimed at any mark above the Moon, did but
feel after the most Conspicuous Being, whose Invisibilities are manifest.

As, many of their Eyes were Dim, so few were single, or of right Intention.
Yet by the Bye, some thought of Schooling the Eye, or making a Covenant with
it. Pericles rebuk't Sophocles for an Eyfull of Adultery, Val. Max. L. 4. c. 3.
when he Gazed upon strange Beauty, Oculos etiam castos habere decet. 3. As
they were fally in their Principle and End, so were they in their Rule. They
did Things of the Law not Legally; Good not well: (...). Alas! they were a Law
to themselves, Non taliter omni Genti, they had not the knowledge of Gods Law.
The Consequence is plain, Their Rona were not Beatifica. Their labors do not
follow them so that these men shall be blessed in their doings. I know it is
said usually, They were but Splendida peccata. I shall not say, They were
(...), because I think otherwise; nor shall I Contradict it, because use has
given authority to say so.

This I shall say though, That we Christians have both infinite Obligation and
encouragement, to maintain, to be cheerful and ready to every good work, to
abound in the work of the Lord, knowing that our Labor is not in vain in the
Lord: That not a Cup of Cold water (Sans Cost of Fire, only warmed with
Charity) not a thought or wish that springs out of a pure heart shall loose
it is reward. Knowing the Miraculous Nature of Faith, that like a Spiritual
Elixer, it transforms the Lowest Act of Drudgerie that the poor Moor of the
Kitchen can do in fear of God and Obedience to Man, See Herberts Poems. The
Elixer.
into an Acceptable remunerable divine Sacrifice.

Now for a Close to this long Note; I will but name 2. or 3. of our Christian
Worthies which will not Commend us of this present Age; but will shine all
these Twinkling Stars of Ethnic Glories, into night: and shame, and shrink
them into nothing. For number they be none, in comparison of our Christian
Calendar: every day in the year, Except the Kalends of Januarie, having, I
think more Martyrs then the stories of all Ages have, Noted Philosophers.
Against the three Youths instanc't page 3135. I put in the Scale; 1. Epagathus
that young noble Advocate of Christians, and Martyr. 2. Origin who within the
years of Childhood was Martyrd in Voto: and when his Mother kept him naked to
keep him alive, encouraged his Father, by pen, Eusebius. l. 5. c. 1. c. 10. l. 6.
c. 2.
to suffer. At 18. year old was Catechist at Alexandria. And as all the world
knows, cut off his right foot for the Kingdom of Heaven. 3. Ponticus, a Youth
of fifteen, bitterly tormented. I could cast in Attalus with his Iron Chair;
Maturus, and Sanctus (men of their own Names) tortured and beheaded. And women
too, Potamiaena, Blandina, Biblis, and St. Basils 40. Martyrs in a severe frost
put into a pond, and then burnt. Holy Barlaam outvies the Torchbearer in Kind.
Val. Max. l. 3. c. 3. says he held a Censer and that a Cole burnt his flesh
till it smelt. St. Basil, in his Homily of him, says that St. Barlaam let the
Incense by violence put in, burn and drop through his hand, and would not shake
it off, lest he might seem to do it to the Idol. Against Polemo's, set St.
Austins Conversion: and the 3000. at one Sermon of a poor Fishermans. Against
Xenocrates's Chastity set Joseph's, and Ephraem Syrus's, who being tempted by
a Woman, untempted her thus. Carry me, said he, into such a place, naming the
open Market-stead in the City of Edessa, where this fell out; that all the
World may see what we do, See St. Greg. Nyssen. in vita S. Ephr.
else I shall not Consent to your desire. The Woman starling at this and
answering, That it would be an open shame to do such a thing in the sight of
men, The holy man replied, if she was afraid of the Eyes of men, how much more
ought she to fear and shame to do it in the sight of God, which Correption of
his made such an impression upon the woman, that she, of a Concubine became a
Convert. See here a (...), a Live Draught of Virtues. The other was only, as S.
Basil Terms it (...), yet such a shadow as may be to us Beneficial: and
Compared to the New light of our Modern Good works, is a Pillar of Fire.

The 2. Note relating to Page 3115. [Some Actions are required in us, that
Grace may be Created in us.] I might save my self the labor of saying any
thing to this Point, by referring my Reader to this Authors Soul-searching
Treatise of Justifying Faith. 3. Section. p. in quarto 278. where he shows,
that, This belief of ours [That Faith is the Sole gift of God, wholly infused,
not in part acquired by us:] should rather quicken then quell Christian
Endeavors for attaining it. As this Belief, that God alone infuses the Soul
into the Embryo, incourages them that intend to be Parents (according to the
Tenor of Ps. 128. Appointed by our Church to be used at Marriages) to enter the
Holy estate and ascend the undefiled Bed. And the Comparison suits well, thus.
As God who can raise Children from the Rock, does not infuse the the Rational
Soul into Stones and Statues, but into Organized Bodies; so does he not
ordinarily bestow Grace on every Reasonable Soul, but on such only as have a
passive Idonietie thereto. And as those Parents, upon whose Offspring depends
the Nursing of Gods people, are tied to be more Cautious then others; Even so
they that attribute the most to that Fundamental Grace of Faith (none can give
enough to it; The Solifidian that gives it most in words; in deeds takes most
from it) are most obliged to teach men to use all possible means, to seek the
best Instruments of believing, planters, waterers, helpers of Faith; above all,
to sue to God to give the Increase: to Cheer men up to work out their Salvation
with fear and trembling, Philip. 2. 13.
because it is God that works both will and deed.

Yet shall I add de proprio, A word, to those that have scarce the patience to
hear of any thing prerequired in man unconverted, that Grace may be Created in
him. My Argument with such an Adversary, is this. Let us take a Polemo, that
is, pro tempore, a Ganeo; non tantum illecebris, sed ipsa infamia Gaudens. Upon
this man, we desire the work of the Lord by our Ministry may be prosperous. We
must either tell him that there is something required of him in this present
State, unconverted as he is, and so set him a Task; or that nothing at all is
expected from him. These two be Points Contradictorie Diametrally, there is no
Mean betwixt them. I say, that of this man Something is required. The first,
minimum quod sic, is Reflecting upon his own actions, Or, I would read to him
the 18. of Ezekiel.
and the Law writ in his Conscience. Next I would Apply some of Gods words
spoke by the Prophets to some sinful people or person; as Isa. 1. 16. Wash
you, make you clean, put away the Evil of your doings --, Cease to do Evil,
learn to do Good --. or that of S. James 4. 8. Draw nigh to God --. Cleanse
your hands ye sinners, and purisie your hearts ye double minded. And would
affirm, that these words signified something, were (not Empty noises, but)
Precepts; and if Praecepts, have some Duty correspondent To be performed by him
to whom I laid them; which is, quod quaerimus; that I would have done. My
Adversary must say, nothing is to be done; It Is to no purpose for me to
exhort, or him to Try, nothing can be done to purpose. Now what will the poor
Patient say? men are naturally inclined to believe them that most ease and
please their natures best. The least Consequent of this Doctrine that he will
or can make, and that if he were a Good natured man too, will be This; why then
I will betake my self to a Negative Idleness, wrap my body in my arms, sit
still, and wait the Good howr when Grace shall breath upon me. A 2. will say,
Go to them, I will eat my meat with joy, and take my portion of the things of
this life, till Tastes of a Better drop into my mouth from heaven. A 3. may
perhaps do worse; Wend to a tavern or worse place, and make work for Grace,
with a Graceless Desperate hope, that the more he sins, the more Grace may,
when it Comes, abound; that quo scelerator eo gratiae vicinior. If my Adversary
says nay; he must abstain from Lewd Courses; we are half agreed: is not that
part, the same with Esay's, Cease to do evil? If he maintain his Conclusion; I
have no more to say, but to enter an Appeal to God, and this protestation to
Man, according to Sense of this Author; That I disclaim all such dispositions,
preparations, Endeavors, as, Cooperating to the production of Grace after the
manner that Temperate behavior concurreth to produce the Habit of Temperance;
or that natural qualities do, to produce Forms merely Physical. And this will
quit me from Pelagianism or Popery; But he shall never be able to free himself
from the Errors of the Stoic or Manichees that holds it indifferent, what
works a man does before he be regenerate.

disposition and nearness of the matter coming most Patly and fitly in, it is

An Appendix, or, Sixth Section.
Concerning the Limitation of these Two Propositions, Romans 8. 13. If ye live
after the flesh ye shall dye; if through the Spirit ye do Mortify the Deeds of
the Body ye shall live.
1. BOth Propositions are (as we say) Hypothetical or Conditional, and if
either should be denied or questioned, the only Course which the Schools (which
are the high Courts of Reason for Judging of Arguments) afford, would be to
plead these Categorical or absolute Propositions. [Whosoever lives after the
flesh shall die] [Whosoever mortifies the Deeds of the body through the Spirit
shall live.] And our Apostle himself, ver. 6. had premised Two absolute
Categoricall Propositions, to infer or prove these two Conditional
Propositions in the Text. For so he says [To be Carnally minded is death] but
[to be spiritually minded is life and peace.] Now albeit he has added no
Quantity to these Two Categorical Propositions; yet in that he says; To be
carnally minded is death, and To be spiritually minded is life; This Infers,
That Death is the Necessary Consequent of Carnal Living; and Life likewise the
Infallible Consequent of being spiritually minded. All must mortify: though
not totally.
And it is an Infallible Rule of Reason, That [Any Proposition, betwixt whose
Parts the Connection is Necessary, is Equivalent to an Universal, although it be
delivered in Terms Indefinite, or without addition of any Quantity.] So that
when our Apostle says; To be carnally minded is death; To be spiritually
minded is life; his Speech is altogether as full, and more Emphatical, then if
he had said: Whosoever lives after the flesh shall die. Whosoever through the
Spirit mortifies the deeds of the body shall live. Howbeit, These Two
Propositions in the Text, thus Reduced to Categoricals, and Rendered Universal
by a Note or Sign of such Quantity; are Universal only in Respect of the
Persons, whom this duty of Mortification concerns; Universal they are not, but
Indefinite, in Respect of the Duty enjoined or Matter proposed.

2. To find out some more distinct (limit or) Limitation of them, in respect of
the Matter proposed, The Limitation set out in Three Negatives.
we are to begin, as in the like Cases the Method requires, from Negatives. The
First Negative is this. [Though all men after they come to years of discretion,
be necessarily tied to Mortify the Flesh, yet no man is tied under pain of
damnation to an absolute or Total Mortification of it. This is Impossible in
this life. Though sin (as the Apostle speaks) be the Sting of death, and Carnal
Intentions be the Arrows or darts of Satan; yet is not every Carnal thought,
or every degree of minding the flesh, so deadly in the issue unto the Soul, as
the Parthian Arrows were to men's Bodies; for they carried death upon their
points, and gave it possession of every body, whose skin they brake; Fatumque
in sanguine summo est; They let Death in at the least breach, whereat Blood
could come out. But every moment of life led after the flesh does not thus
Necessarily bring forth the death here meant. The second Negative is this. [It
is not every Degree or Part of Mortification that will suffice to bring forth
the Life here meant.] For he does not say, if ye have Mortified the deeds of
the body, but if ye do mortify the deeds of the Body ye shall live. These Two
Negatives are as the Two Tropicks, betwixt which the Limitation of the former
Proposition, in respect of the Matter proposed, or Duty enjoined, is wholly
Situate. It is a Positive Mean between them; somewhat Less then any Absolute
or Total Mortification; Somewhat More then every Degree or Practice of
Mortification: yet all this is but Indefinite. This Positive Mean betwixt the
former Negatives must of necessity be either some kind of Mortification for
Quality more Precious then the Mortification which most men ordinarily affect
or practice: or some Greater Measure of the same Mortification, whereof most
men are partakers at some times.

3. As Great men's quick Goods are presumed to be of a better kind or breed,
then the like goods of their poor neighbors (for Noble-mens Geese, as the
Proverb is, are Swans) So there be some, who will have all Qualifications
whether of Life or Practice, all Acts of Duty or Performances to be of a better
kind or rank in the Elect, then they are in Others. And in these men's Dialect
or Divinity, the Answer to the proposed Querie were easy, and would be This.
They which Mortify the deeds of the body in such sort as the Elect do, they
certainly shall Live, for the Elect do truly mortify them, albeit not in so
full a Measure. And as Belief, so Mortification, in Them especially, how Little
soever it be, Points of Election, etc. are not to determine, but to be
determined by more general points.
so it be True, will suffice unto salvation. But in the Divinity which I have
learned, the points of Election and Reprobation are to be determined of (if at
all they may be determined of) by the Resolution of other more General and more
facile Queries. They are preposterously brought to the Determination of any
other Difficulties. Always the Resolutions of the Generals must be
Introductions to the Resolution or clearing of more Special Difficulties.
Special Difficulties can be no Introduction to the Resotion of General Queries.
Now this duty of Mortification and the Transgression of it, to wit, Living
after the flesh, are far more General, then the estate of Election or
Reprobation. Seeing, as I am often forced to repeat, it is but a little Point of
mankind, a small Portion of men (which are partakers of the Word or Sacraments)
which are for the Present contained under either part of This Division, All are
not Elect, or Reprobate. But all live after the flesh, or after the Spirit.
either in the State of Election or Reprobation. But under this Division of
Living after the flesh or after the spirit, all are comprehended. Again, in as
much as we our selves are all employed in this Work of Mortification, we may
have more certain Experiments of our Progress in this Duty, then we can have of
our estate of Election, which is merely the work of God; we have no finger, no
employment in it. The truth is, Only they who have mortified the deeds of the
Body in such a measure, as our Apostle here requires, are in the State of
Election. Only they who have made up such a measure of sin or Living after the
Flesh, as induces the Sentence of death here mentioned, are in the absolute
State of Reprobation. So that the Positive Mean between the two former
Negatives must be taken from the measure, not from the Specifical Quality or
nature of mortification. The very Phrase or Character of our Apostle [If ye
live after the flesh ye shall die; but, if through the Spirit ye mortify the
deeds of the Body, ye shall live,] Necessarily includes a Perseverance in
either kind. A Perseverance there must be in this Duty of Mortification, before
we can have full and perfect Interest in this Promise. Without Perseverance or
Continuance in this life of the Flesh, none are inevitably sentenced unto the
death here denounced against all that live after the Flesh.

4. But even Perseverance it self is a Term Indefinite and illimited; it
admits, though not altogether so many determinate degrees or portions, as
Mortification does, (for there must be some set degrees of Mortification,
before there can be any Perseverance in Mortification) yet a great many Degrees
or parts. And all the degrees of Perseverance are measurable by Continuance of
Time. Some there be who require a Perseverance in Mortification unto the hour
of death, before a man can be Infallible Heir of the blessing here promised.
They say of This and the like blessings or Prerogatives or promised, as Solon
did of Happiness or Feli^ity; -- Dicique beatus Ante obitum nemo supremaque
funera debet.

No man can be said to be Thus Happy, as to be in the assured state of Life,
until he has Persevered in this Duty of Mortification unto death. And in this
Tenor many of Gods Promises seem to run. As when it is said, He that continues
unto the End, he shall be saved, etc. This Limitation, though true, is not
satisfactory to the Point in Question. This Negative is true [He that does not
Persevere in this duty of Mortification unto the End of his Life, can have no
Interest in this promised Life.] But this being granted, it may be further
Questioned: Whether a man may not have the Gift of Final Perseverance
Infallibly collated upon him by the Virtue of this Promise before he come near
to the End of his mortal life? Whether some may not have it collated a longer
time before, some a shorter time, some not until the last day of their life or
hour of death?

5. A double Inquiry about Perseverance.
This Point again admits of a Double Inquisition. The one, De Certitudine
Objecti, The other, De Certitudine Subjecti. The One Concerns the Certainty of
the Object or Gift of Perseverance it self; as whether this Gift be immutably
bestowed upon any man before his death. The Other concerns the Certainty of our
Apprehensions or persuasions that this Gift of Perseverance is, or may be
bestowed upon us in Particular. Or, if any man in this life can be thus
Certainly persuaded, the last Querie is, By what Degree or kind of Certainty he
can be assured, that he shall finally Persevere in this Duty of Mortification,
or that he shall so Persevere in it, as he shall not finally fall from Grace.
To begin with the First Branch of this Inquiry, to wit; Whether the Gift of
perseverance, or Certain Estate in Grace, may be infallible or Immutable in
this life. Our First Proposition shall be this. [There is a Degree or measure
of Mortification (best known unto God) which may be obtained before the hour of
death, by some later, by others sooner, unto which whosoever does attain, he is
not only actually instated in this Promise of life, but confirmed in Grace, and
endued with the Gift of Perseverance.] The Measure is not the same to all; Some
may be Confirmed in Grace, before they attain unto the same height of
Mortification, which others must Exceed. To whom much is given, of them much
shall be required. The second Proposition is This, [There is a Degree or
Measure of living after the Flesh (best known unto God) which may be made up in
this Life, by some sooner, by others later, which measure whosoever does make
up or go beyond it, does hereby become liable to the Sentence of death hereby
denounced, and falls into the state of Reprobation. The truth of both
Propositions may be inferred from the Analogy of Faith or points of Doctrine
heretofore delivered concerning the Certainty or continuance of Publick-Weal or
Prosperity, See his Sermons upon 2 Chr. 6. 39. And upon Jer. 26. 19. preached
before the King.
and the Certainty or Infallibility of Ruin and Destruction to States and
Kingdoms. Saul's Kingdom was upon the point of being perpetually Confirmed
unto him, 1 Samuel 13. 14. but by his Folly and disobedience, his own Ruin, and
utter Deposition of his Line, became inevitable and irrevocable. The Rule often
mentioned in other Treatises, was Gener all. That Blessings promised to any
Nation, whilst they were only promised, not confirmed by Oath, were but
Mutable and Conditional, and the Promise revocable. That Cursings likewise,
only denounced by way of Threat, Promises or threats without Oath Revocable:
under Oath irrevocable.
not ratified by Oath; were but Conditional, were Evitable, and the Sentence
revocable. That Plagues or Blessings denounced by Oath were Inevitable,
unpreventable; Instances were then given in Saul; and in the Children of
Israel, which were cut off by Oath from entering into the Land of Promise, as
others were assured by Oath that they should enter into it.

6. Now albeit the Interposition of Gods Oath was always an Infallible
Argument, that The Thing, which he did swear (were that matter of Promise or
of Threat, blessing or cursing) was Immutable; yet the Interposition of the
Oath, did not first make men's Estates, whether in his Promises or in his
Threats, to be Immutable; but rather declare them to be such. Their Estates
were the one way or the other Immutable, before the Lord did so declave them,
and Immutable their Estates always became, not by any Specifical Qualities of
the Duties performed, or of the Iniquities committed by them; but by the Just
measure, or full Degrees, whether of dutiful Obedience or of disobedience and
Transgression. The best Argument in this Case we can use must be drawn from the
Type unto the Antitype, from the Legal Shadow unto the Evangelical Body. This
kind of Argument our Apostle has warranted, and in a manner fully drawn unto
our hands Heb. 3. 7. Wherefore as the Holy Ghost says, to day if you will hear
his voice, harden not your hearts, ver. 13. but exhort one another daily whilst
it is called to day (i. e. whilst there is time left for repentance) lest any
of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin; for we are made partakers
of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the End;
(...): what End does he mean? the End or utmost Period of Life? This End may be
comprehended under this Phrase; which notwithstanding is not necessary to be
restrained unto this End: For so the Instances alleged by the Apostle, would
not Conclude his main Allegation, yea they include the Contradictory to this
restraint: thus much at the least, that some, of whom he speaks, were confirmed
in the promise, and declared to be so confirmed by Oath; others of them were
sentenced by Oath unto death without revocation or appeal, long before the End
of life or approach of death. Some when they had heard (says the Apostle) did
provoke, howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses ver. 16. Not all that
were above twenty years old: for Caleb and Joshua, being at that time 40 years
of Age, did enter into the Land of Promise after all the rest, which were above
twenty, had perished in the wilderness. But the Apostle further demands, with
whom was he grieved forty years? Was it not with them which had sinned, whose
carcases fell in the wilderness? And to whom swear he, that they should not
enter into his Rest? but to them that believed not; so we see what they could
not enter in because of unbelief, He says not, they did not enter in because
of unbelief, but they could not enter in because of Unbelief. This argues that
the Possibility of entering in was utterly cut off, and we know it was so cut
off because the Lord had sworn they should not enter in. But what was the true
or adequate Cause why they could not enter in, or why their former Possibility
of entering in, was utterly cut off? The Apostle mentioned only Two. Unbelief
and Sin. But are his words only to be understood of ordinary Sin or Simple
unbelief? or was there any Sin or Unbelief for Specifical Quality so deadly as
could utterly exclude them from all Possibility of entering in? or, do these
Terms though Indefinite in themselves, necessarily Include a certain Measure
or high Degree of Unbelief or Sin. This Point may best be resolved by the
Historical Relations of Moses, whereunto our Apostles discourse throughout the
whole 3. Chapter to the Hebrews has special Reference; and on which his
Exhortation or main Argument is wholly grounded. This Story is set down at
large Numbers the 14. 21. Of Promises or threats without or under Oath; See his
7. Book Chapter 13. and 9. Book. Chapter 18.
As truly as I live (says God to Moses) all the earth shall be filled with the
Glory of the Lord. This is the Express form of the Oath. The Contents of the
same Oath, or the Articles, unto which God Swears, are set down at large in the
words following, in which likewise the Measure and Quantity as well of their
Positive Sin as of their Unbelief is Emphatically expressed. All those men
which have seen my Glory, and my Miracles which I did in Egypt, and in the
wilderness, and have temptea me these ten times and have not hearkened unto my
voice; surely they shall not see the Land, which I swear unto their Fathers,
neither shall any of them that provoked me see it. They had seen, or known by
certain Relation, Ten several Mighty Wonders, which God had wrought in Egypt
upon Pharaoh, upon his Land and People. Now the contempt and neglect of so many
Wonders, besides the Miracles which he had wrought for them in the wilderness,
argue a great Measure of Disobedience or Unbelief, a great Measure of Omission
or neglect of this Duty of Mortification which is Necessary to All; a great
Measure of Life stubbornly led after the Flesh; Howbeit Their Sins were most
grievous, which had seen the Good Land, which God had promised by Oath unto
their Fathers, as is clear from Numb. 14. 36, 37. The men which Moses sent to
search the Land, who returned and made all the Congregation to murmur against
him by bringing up a slander upon the Land, Even those men that did bring up
the evil report upon the Land, dyed by the plague before the Lord: and so they
dyed before their brethren, which had given credit unto their report, and out
of their Unbelief did murmur against their God. Howbeit even these, with all
the rest above twenty years old (Except Caleb and Joshua) were utterly cut off,
from all Possibility of entering in, before the time or hour of their death; yea
they dyed before their Ordinary Times for this their Provocation; as is
Emphatically expressed, ver 34. Ye shall bear your Iniquities forty years. And
you shall know my breach of promise; that is, the Revocation of the Blessing
promised.

7. That Caleb and Joshua had their Estate or Interest in the same promise
irrevocably confirmed unto them, long before their time of their entering into
the promised Land, may be gathered from the Exception interserted in the Oath;
for the Lord had sworn that none of the rest should enter in besides Caleb and
Joshua. Number. 14. 30.
This Exception in Ordinary Construction seems to include, that the Lord did
Positively swear, That These Two should enter into his Rest. Howbeit this
Exception alone is but a Presumption, or a proof not Concludent without
Favorable Construction, and as Lawyers say, Favorabiliora sunt amplianda;
Favorable promises are to be taken in the ampler Sense. But thus we may not
interpret Gods Promises without warrant from Him. That Gods meaning in the
former Clause or Exception concerning Caleb and Joshua was to be taken in this
Favorable and ample Sense, we have a further Positive and Concludent Proof
from the Petition which Caleb exhibited unto Joshua, and Joshua granted Josh.
14. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Thou know (says Caleb unto Joshua) the thing that
the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadesh
Barnea, Moses swear in that day saying surely the Land, whereon thy feet have
trodden, shall be thine inheritance and thy Childrens for ever: because thou
have wholly followed the Lord my God. And now behold the Lord has kept me
alive as he said these forty and five years, even since the Lord spoke this
Word unto Moses, whilst the Children of Israel wandered in the Wilderness; and
now lo I am this day fourfcore and five years old: As yet I am as strong this
day, as I was in the day when Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so
is my strength now for war, both to go out and come in; And Joshua blessed
him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Iephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. Such
is the Force and Efficacy of Gods Promise confirmed by Oath, that it not only
kept Caleb alive, but in the same strength and Activity of body till 85. years,
in which he was at 40. years. It was as Remarkable in preserving his life and
strength, as it was in bringing mortality upon others. Yet was not his Promise
so confirmed by Oath unto all that were excepted from the Plague denounct by
Oath, as it was unto Caleb and Joshua. For all that were under twenty years old
were excepted from the plague denounced by Oath, yet were they not all assured
by Oath, that they should enter into the Land of Promise. The Exception of Them
in the Oath only, reserves that Possibility or that Interest, which their
Fathers had in the Promise as Entire to them as it was at the first. Their
Estate was but Conditional, and held as it were the Mean between the Estate of
Caleb and Joshua, which was Confirmed by Oath, and the Estate of their
Forefathers, which were Excluded by Oath. For so Moses says unto the Tribe of
Reuben and God, whose disobedience and backsliding he feared, Numb. 32. 14, 15.
Behold ye are risen up in your Fathers stead an increase of sinful men to
augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel; For if ye turn away
from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness, and ye shall
destroy all this people. Moses in this speech supposes, that these men were
not so Immutably Interessed in Gods Promise, as Caleb and Iashua were: These
men stood in need of Repentance, and their Repentance is Specified, Ver. 16,
17, 18.

But was this Decree of God Concerning Caleb and Joshua terminated to their
Individual Entities, or inseparably annexed unto their Persons before they were
born, or, did it suppose some Measure or Degree of Belief or Obedience in them?
Yes, As the others Exclusion by Oath did presuppose an Extraordinary Measure of
Disobedience and Unbelief; So the Ratification of the same Promise unto them by
Oath did presuppose a Measure more then ordinary of Belief and Obedience. Thus
much is included in the reason of their exception from the Common Plague, Numb.
32. 12. For they have wholly followed the Lord: which Speech is likewise
resumed by Caleb, Josh. 19. 9.

8. So then these Three Points be Clear. First, That such as had Gods Promise
for entering into the Land of Canaan, Three Points cleared.
were cut off from all Interest in this Promise, as appears from the words
recited, Numb. 14. 34. Ye shall know my breach or Nullification of my Promise;
for Gods Promise could not be Nullified or Revoked, unless it had been
sincerely and really made unto them. The Second; That this Promise was not only
Revoked or Nullified, but that the Parties to whom it was made, were utterly
cut off from all Hope of Possibility of having the like Interest in the Land of
Promise renewed unto them, albeit they sought the renewing of it with Tears,
and testified their repentance with hazard of their lives. This point is clear
from Numb. 14. 39, 40, 41. So when Moses told all these sayings unto all the
Children of Israel, the people mourned greatly, and they rose up early in the
morning, and gate them up into the top of the mountain, saying, lo we be here,
and will go up unto the place, which the Lord has promised; for we have
sinned. And Moses said, wherefore do ye now transgress the Commandment of
God? But it shall not prosper; go not up, for the Lord is not among you, that
you be not smitten before your enemies. The event did prove his words true: For
when they presumed to go up unto the hill top, then the Amalekites came down
and the Canaanites, which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited
them even unto Horma, Numb. 14. 43, 45. Deuteronomy. 1. 41. The Third Point. That the
General Promise wherein All the people had a true Interest, but from which most
of them were utterly cut off, was irrevocably ratified and confirmed unto
Joshua and Caleb upon their Perseverance in Belief and Obedience. The like
Ratification of Gods Promise upon the like Occasion, we have in the history of
Abraham. First He had Gods Promise that he should be the Father of many
Nations, that he should possess the land of Canaan, but this Promise
presupposed or prerequired a Measure or Degree of Obedience in Abraham; for he
was to forsake his kindred and his Fathers house at Gods Commandment, before
he could claim Interest in this Promise. He had likewise fought the Battle of
the Lord, before this Promise was further ratified or enlarged by the Solemn
Blessing, which Melchisedeck bestowed upon him in the Name of the Most High
God. Yet even unto this Measure of Obedience Gods Promise was not Irrevocably
Terminated, the blessing promised was not as yet so Immutable, as it afterward
became. To what measure of Obedience then was it so Immutably terminated? To
his Obedience in offering up his only son Isaac; upon this Fact the former
Promises were solemnly confirmed by Oath, and being so confirmed the Blessings
promised could not be recalled or repealed. By this last Measure of Belief or
Obedience, that Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and
it was Counted unto him for Righteousness, as St. James instructs us, Chapt. 2.
23. As this Fact was the accomplishment of Abraham's former Obedience; so the
Interposition of Gods Oath upon this Fact was the Full or Final Ratification of
Gods former Promises made unto Abraham.

9. Now all these things (as the Apostle in the like Case says) happened unto
them for Ensamples or Types, and they are written for our admonitions, upon
whom the ends of the world are come: wherefore let him that thinks he stands,
take heed lest he fall, Every Degree of Mortification an approach to the Final
Ratification of the Promise.
1. Cor. 10. 11, 12. The special Points of our Admonition or Instruction from
the former Types or Examples may thus be gathered by warrant or Imitation of
the Apostles Argument in the like Case. Whosoever does in any sort Mortify the
Deeds of the body, has a true interest in this Promise, [ye shall Live.] Every
subsequent Degree of Mortification is a Degree or approach unto the Final
Ratification of the Promise. The Blessing promised not withstanding is not
Irrevocably ratified, the Gift of Final Perseverance in this Duty, is not
immutably established, until we attain unto a certain Measure of
Mortification, answering in proportion unto the Measure of Abraham's Obedience,
when he offered up his son Isaac, or unto the Obedience of Caleb and Joshua,
when the Lord swear unto them that they should enter into the Land of Canaan.
Again, every Degree or Portion of life led after the flesh, is a Degree or
Approach unto the Sentence of death here denounced; [If ye live after the flesh
ye shall dye.] The further we go on in the ways of the Flesh, the more we
endanger our Interest in the promise of Life, the more obnoxious or liable we
become to the Sentence of death. Howbeit the Sentence of death becomes not
Irrevocable, until we come unto a Full Measure of Disobedience, in following
the ways of the Flesh, answering in proportion unto the Measure of their
Disobedience or Unbelief, who were cut off from all Possibility of entering
into the Land of Promise. Again, as these Disobedient men did make up the full
Measure of their Disobedience, before they made up the full measure of their
days, and as Caleb, Joshua, and Abraham, did attain unto the Measure of Belief
and Obedience, unto which Gods Blessings were immutably annexed by Oath, long
before they came unto the End of their Life: So likewise we may come unto that
Measure of Disobedience, or living after the Flesh, unto which the Sentence of
death is inevitably awarded, before we cease to be in the Flesh; and on the
otherside we may attain to that Measure of Mortification, whose necessary
Consequent is an Immutable Estate in Life Spiritual, before we come to the End
of our Bodily Life. And unto this Point some may arrive sooner, others later,
according to the Fervency of their Endeavors, or victorious Constancy in the
Service of God.

10. The Objection answered.
The only Objection, that is, or can be made against this Resolution or
Determination in the Point proposed, was intimated before; the whole strength
of it relyes upon those places of Scripture, wherein it is said, He that
continues unto the End, shall be saved: or, We are partakers of Christ and his
promises, if we Continue the Beginning of our Confidence steadfast unto the End.
But though it be True, that no man, which falls off from the Spirit unto the
Flesh, before the End of his bodily Life, can be partaker of the promises; yet
is it never said, That no man is, or can be so confirmed in Grace before the
End of his life, that he cannot Totally or finally fall. As for that Speech
frequent in Scripture, [He that continues unto the End; etc.] it does not so
punctually point out the End of Life, as it does the End or just Measure of
this Duty here enjoined, (...), or (...) in the Language of the Holy Ghost
oftimes signifies as much as ad victoriam; and denotes that point of time
wherein we get the Victory or Conquest over the Flesh or other enemies of the
Spirit. And the Apostles words, Hebr. 3. 14. may well bear this
Interpretation: if we hold the beginning of our Confidence steadfast unto the
End: That is, unto the End or full Measure of our Confidence. And all the
glorious promises which are made unto such as continue unto the End, are as
often made and conceived in this Tenor, To him that overcomes. So it is Revel.
3. 5. He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white raiment, and I
will not blot out his Name out of the Book of Life, but I will confess his
Name before my Father and before his Angels. And again, ver. 12. Him that
overcomes will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no
more out, and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the
City of my God which is New Jerusalem; which comes down out of heaven from my
God; And the writing of this Name of Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven
upon men, imports, it shall be thus written whilst they live here on earth, or
whilst it comes down to them, not when they ascend in soul unto it. And when
S. Paul says, that the Names of Clement and other his Fellow Laborers were
written in the Book of Life, Phil. 4. 3. Questionless his meaning is, that
they were so written in it, that they should never be blotted out, and yet were
they so written long before they dyed. I saw (says S. John) the dead small and
great stand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened,
which is the Book of Life; and the dead were judged out of those things that
were written in the Books according to their works, Rev. 20. 12.

But although men in this Life may attain unto an Immutable estate of Grace,
yet many finally miss of this Estate, because they know not where to find
themselves, or in what Estate or Condition they should for the Present rank or
esteem themselves.

11 Some there be, which either Expressly, or by Inevitable Consequence of what
they expressly affirm, divide Mankind as formally into Reprobates and Elect,
The division of all mankind into Elect and Reprobates, not right.
as Philosophers do Substances into Corporeal and Incorporeal. By this kind of
Division, (were it sound and Orthodoxal) every man from his birth unto his
death should be either a Reprobate, or One Elect. Now were this Doctrine true,
We that are Christ's Messengers should be at a Nonplus, either for administering
Comfort to our hearers in trouble of Conscience; or for preventing and
asswaging Presumption in such, as are not conscious of any grosser Sin, or not
dejected by the Thundering Threats of Gods Law.

The Truth is; There be Three Estates or Conditions of Men, not only in
General, but of every man in particular, which finally attains unto Salvation.

First, The Estate or Condition of Man as he is the son of Adam. For every man,
as he is the son of Adam, is the son of wrath.

Second, The Estate or Condition of Man, as he is reconciled to God, and
admitted into the Privilege of his Son, by Baptism, or ingraftment into his
Mystical Body, the Church.

Third, The Estate or Condition of Complete Regeneration, or of Election.

The First estate or condition is the Terminus a quo. Eternal Salvation, or
admission into the Everlasting State of Bliss, is the Terminus ad quem of every
True Christians Progress. The Two Estates Intermediate that is, the Estate of
the Sons of God in General by Baptism, and the Estate of Election, which we
have in this Life, are the Two several Degrees or steps of our Progress in
Christianity.

But in as much as all men be not at all times, either in the Estate of
Election or Reprobation, and yet all in the end become either Sheep or Goats:
we must observe Four Estates of men in General. Four Estates of men in general.


The First, The Estate of the Sons of Wrath.

The Second, The Estate of Reprobates.

The Third, the estate of the Sons of God by Adoption, or Baptism.

The Fourth, The estate of the elect, or completely Regenerate.

12. That there is a Difference between the estate or Condition of the Sons of
Wrath, and the estate of absolute Reprobation: A difference likewise between
the Estate or Condition of the Sons of God, and the Estate of Condition of the
Elect, may be Demonstrated form the several Estates or Conditions of the First
Man. Adam in his First estate was the Son of God, yet not then in the estate of
election, for so he could not have fallen so foully as he did. After his Fall
he was in the Sat or Condition of a Son of Wrath; Yet not in the estate or
condition of absolute Reprobation, for so he could not have attained unto the
estate of election or Salvation. So then every Reprobate is the Son of Wrath,
but every Son of Wrath is not a Reprobate. Every elect Person, or every man
after election is the Son of God, but every Son of God is not in the number of
the elect. The Award allotted to every one of these estates, is either an Act
of Mercy or of Justice Divine. But unto the individual Nature, or Persons of
men, no effect of Justice or Mercy can be awarded: And therefore the Individual
entity or Nature of Man cannot be the Immediate Object of the Divine Decree. No
part of misery can be determined upon any man, or Decreed against him, before
he be the Son of wrath or a Reprobate; For God does never punish where he is
not displeased, and displeased he cannot be with our mere Natures. Now to be
the Son of Wrath in the lowest degree, supposes some work of Satan wrought in
the party, which is the Son of Wrath; That only makes him the Son of Wrath.
Adam could not have become the Son of Wrath unless he had suffered the Devil
to deface Gods work in him, and to instamp his own image upon him. No son of
Adam could have been born the Child of wrath, unless this work and Image of
Satan had been propagated unto him by inheritance from his Father Adam. Now, if
to be the Son of Wrath in the lowest degree presuppose some work of Satan, the
estate or Condition of Reprobation always includes or presupposes a greater
measure of Satan's works; and unto this work, not unto men's Persons or
Individual Natures, is the Irrevocable Sentence of Reprobation awarded.

13. To be the Son of God includes or presupposes more then the mere Nature,
essence, or Individual Substance of man. What more does it Include? It always
includes some work of God wrought in the Nature, either as an Emanant Effect or
Resultance of his Creation; or some work of God produced in man after his
Birth, Conception, or Creation. Adam by Creation was the Son of God, because he
was created just and good. And albeit there were not two Creations, One of
Adams Nature, Another of his Righteousness; Yet was his Righteousness a thing
Distinct from his Nature: Otherwise Adam by his Fall had not ceased to be the
Son of God. For after his Fall he remained the same man he was for Nature and
Substance, but not the same man he was for Quality. It was then his First
Qualification, to wit, his Righteousness, by which he was made the Son of God,
and it was the loss of this Qualification, which made him the Son of wrath.
His Nature or substance was no part of the Object of the Divine Decree; not
Capable either of Reward or Punishment, but according to the Two former
Qualifications. In every Son of Adam, which in time becomes the Son of God,
there must be a Creation or new production of Righteousness by the birth of the
Spirit, besides his birth or Conception natural, by which he becomes a man. In
every Elect Person there must be a Greater work of God, a greater measure of
Regeneration or of new birth, then that by which he is first made the Son of
God. And this Measare of Righteousness or of Regeneration is the Immediate and
Formal Object of the Eternal Decree; or of that Eternal Rule of Divine Mercy or
bounty, by which the Immutable Estate of Election or of Grace is awarded.
Election and Reprsbation look upon Qualifications.
The Point then is clear as the Sun; That neither the Decree of Election or
Reprobation are terminated to the Nature or Individual Substance of men,
without respect or relation to their works or Qualifications. The works of
Satan are Essentially and formally included in the Object of Reprobation: the
Works of (...) to be wrought in man not for man only, are Essentially and
Formally included in the Object of absolute election.

14. That which the Authors or Favorers of the Contrary Opinion (I am
persuaded) would have said, or should in reason say for Their absolute election
or Reprobation, is only This; That albeit the works of God be essentially
included in the Object of the eternal election, as the works of Satan are in
the Object of eternal Reprobation: yet God did so absolutely Decree to work
these works, which are required to the Object of election, that it was
Necessary from eternity they should be wrought in all the Vessels of election.
And that he did from eternity so Absolutely Decree to suffer Satan to work
those works, which are included in the Object of Reprobation, or those works
which makes men Vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, that this Qualification
or Temper could not possibly be avoided. This indeed is One of the Two main
Questions, which only ought seriously to be discussed between the Arminians and
their Opposites, all the rest are but Word-Bates, or Verbal Quarrels, arising
from ambiguous or Unscholastick expressions of their Opinions or Conceits.

The First Question is already discussed, and is, Whether men in this life
ordinarily do, or may attain unto an Immutable estate of Grace; that is,
whether their election until the hour of death be Absolute, or but Conditional.

The Second, which now remains to be discussed, is, Whether this Absolute
estate of election or Reprobation, during the time of this life being granted,
the attaining unto the one estate, or falling into the other, be from eternity
Necessary: so Necessary, that no man, which has fallen or shall fall into the
Absolute estate of Reprobation, has had, or has, any Possibility to avoid his
Fall. Or again, whether every man, that now is in the Absolute Estate of
Election, were so destinated to the same Estate from Eternity, that no
Occurrences Possible could prevent it. If the Arminians would yield to the
Church of England in the Former, I think no true Member of the Church of
England, would much dissent from them in the Latter: which may be expressed in
Terms perhaps more Perspicuous, Thus: Whether God, in his Foresight of all
men's Natures, did set apart or design some Individual essences or Natures,
with purpose to frame and fit them to be Vessels of Honor without Possibility
left for them to frame themselves to be Vessels of dishonor? And whether he
did, by the same Foresight or Inspection, set apart or design Other indiviaual
Natures or Substances to be Vessels of wrath or dishonor, without any Purpose
or Will to frame or Fashion them to be Vessels of election? To discuss both
Questions, first in Thest, then in Hypothesi; that is, First, whether Election
it self were Absolutely Necessary from eternity. Secondly, Whether the Election
of this or that man, were Absolutely Necessary from the hour of his birth or
conception, or rather begins to be Necessary, from his progress in Grace, or
from his Plenary and full Conversion unto God, which sometimes, and in some
men, is not accomplished before the hour of death?

15. No man's Election or designment to the Immutable state of Grace can be more
Necessary from eternity, then his Reconciliation is. No man's Reconciliation
unto God the Father can be more Necessary from eternity, A Sorites.
then his Interest is in the Pardon purchased by the Son of God. No man's
Interest in this Pardon can be from eternity more Necessary, then was the death
of the Son of God. The death of the Son of God was no more Necessary from
eternity, then the Fall of Adam was. The Fall of Adam neither was nor could be
from eternity more necessary, then the First sin or Transgression was. The
Consequences of these Truths are most necessary, most immediate, If Adam had
not Transgressed Gods Commandment, he had not fallen into the State of Gods
Wrath and curse. If Adam had not fallen into Gods Wrath or curse, the Son of
God had not become accursed, had not dyed. If the Son of God had not dyed for
us, our Pardon had not been purchased. If our Pardon had not been purchased,
there had been no Reconciliation of mankind unto God the Father. If there had
been no Reconciliation of mankind to God the Father, there had been no election
in Christ, So that though it be most True, that Christ was Agnus occisus ab
origin mundi, the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World, yet was it not
necessary from eternity, that this Lamb should be slain; For Christ's death was
no more necessary then Adams death or Transgression was. Now no man, I hope
well advised, will affirm, that God did destinate Adams Transgression as a
necessary Means that Christ should dye, for so he should make him the Author of
sin in Adam, before he became the Fountain of Mercy in Christ. The Truth then
is; That Adam having sinned, not of necessity, but Freely; God, out of his Free
Mercy and Compassion toward mankind, did destinate the Incarnation, the Death
and Passion, of his only Son, as the Only Means of our Redemption, and
Reconciliation to himself. And did likewise Destinate the Consecration of his
Son (by his death) unto his everlasting Priesthood, as the only means for the
accomplishing of our Redemption, that is, for making our election sure and
Absolute. As Christ's Priesthood is then most unchangeable and most necessary,
yet was it not necessary from eternity that he should be made a Priest by the
suffering of death: So our estate of election in him is most Absolute and
necessary after we attain unto it; yet was it not necessary from eternity that
we should attain unto it; not absolutely necessary that any should attain unto
it, but necessary only upon Supposal of Adams Transgression (which was no way
necessary, but Free and Contingent:) and of Gods infinite wisdom and mercy in
sending Christ Jesus our Lord.

16. If no man's Destination or designment to the Absolute State of election in
Christ were absolutely necessary from Eternity, but necessary only upon the
Supposals last made, which were not necessary; much less was the Designment of
any man's Individual nature or Person to the Absolute State of Reprobation or
damnation absolutely necessary from Eternity. Damnation, as all grant, is the
end of Sin, or rather an endless misery, into which no man can fall but by
sin, whence if this endless misery had been absolutely necessary from Eternity
or Decreed by God as the Goal of any man's Course of life; the means likewise or
only way by which men come unto this end or Goal must have been by a like
degree of necessity destinated and decreed by God; and the only way or means,
by which men come unto this end, is sin: So that God, by this Opinion or
Doctrine, should have been as Immediate a Cause of Sin and death, as he is of
the Punishment of sins, or of non-Repentance for sins, committed. And this is
Contrary to the fundamental Principles of Christianity, of Religion it self: By
both which we are taught, that God, as a Righteous Judge, is the sole Author of
the Decree or Sentence against impenitent sinners, but no Cause at all, no
Author of their sins or Impenitency, and therefore no Cause, much less any
necessary Cause of any man's Falling into the Absolute state of Reprobation. Our
Savior Christ, as then designed to be the Future Judge of quick and dead, did
pronounce that Woeful Sentence against Judas, and against him alone for ought we
read; It were good for that man if he had never been born. Judas not Reprobated
from Eternity.
We may hence safely conclude, that Judas from that time was in the Absolute
State of Reprobation, and had now deserved (without hope of Pardon) this
fearful Sentence, as having now resolved in his heart without Remorse or
Compunction, to betray the Son of God into the hands of sinners. He became an
Absolute Reprobate by resolving to betray the Son of God; he did not resolve to
betray the Son of God, because he was an Absolute Reprobate from Eternity or
from his birth. He was not liable to this woeful Sentence from his birth or in
his Infancy; for if it had been better for him from his birth or from his
calling to the Apostle-ship, not to have been born at all, or not to have been
so called; God howsoever most gracious and good in himself, had not been good
or gracious unto Judas in giving him Being, in making him an Apostle, seeing it
had been much better for him not to have been either a Man or an Apostle, if
from the time of his Birth or Apostle-ship he had been inevitably designed to
the absolute estate of Reprobation, to a greater measure of everlasting
punishments then other men ordinarily are. But the Truth is, the greater
measure of his punishment did presuppose a greater measure of his
unthankfulness, and the greater measure of his unthankfulness (in respect of
other men) did presuppose a greater measure of Gods Favor and goodness toward
him, in giving him birth and being in the days of his Sons Incarnation, or in
calling him to the Fellowship of his Apostles or Ambassadors. And thus we come
a Thesiad Hypothesin from the general Speculative Truth unto the Particular Use
or Application.

17. All of us do (I am persuaded) unfeignedly acknowledge our selves to have
been by Natural birth the Sons of wrath; and to be the sons of wrath, includes
in it some work of Satan, wrought not in Adam only, but in our Nature, Satan's
work twofold, Sin, and Curse
which we derive from him; and this work of Satan is Twofold: Sin Original, and
the Curse thereunto annexed; this Latter Part, to wit the Curse, must be
dissolved by Faith, as by the Instrument: For he that believes not, says S.
John Chap. 3. ver. 36. shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him;
that is, It was upon him from his First Being, and rests upon him until it be
removed by Faith in the Son of God. Now in that this work of Satan (that is,
the Curse due to Sin Original) is removed by Faith in the Son of God, the Son
of God is the Principal Cause or Agent which removes it by his Sacerdotal or
Princely Blessing upon our Ministerial Act or Function of Baptism. It is a
Truth unquestionable (especially in the Doctrine of the Church of England) that
as many, as are Baptized, are from their Baptism, and by their Baptism
translated from the Estate or Condition of Sons of wrath, to the Estate or
Privilege of the Sons of God. This Doctrine of our Church is necessarily
grounded upon the Saying of our Apostle Gal. 3. 27. As many of you, as have
been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. Now it is impossible that any
should put on Christ and not receive him. And to as many as receive him (says
S. John cap. 1. ver. 12.) to them he gives power (Right, or Privilege) to
become the Sons of God.

18. But here some will demand, If all that are Baptized become the sons of
God, do they not all likewise by this new birth become heirs with Christ? Yes,
all that are Sons are likewise Heirs, but not therefore un-disinheritable,
because heirs; not therefore in the estate of absolute election, because they
are in the estate of the sons of God, or heirs with Christ by Baptism. For
many, whom God has graciously accepted for his sons; many, who during the time
of their Infancy have enjoyed the estate or Privilege of the sons of God, may
in riper years turn Prodigal sons, and disinherit themselves; and none can be
disinherited but he that has been in the estate or Condition of an Heir; or
until with Esau he have sold his birthright. Both parts of this Assertion,
[That all that are Baptized in their Infancy, become the Sons of God, and
during their Infancy do live to God.] 2. That Sin even in such, may revive, and
wound, some grievously, others mortally,] are included in our Apostles dispute,
Romans 7. 9. I was once alive, (says the Apostle,) without the Law: but when the
Commandment came sin revived, and I dyed. Does he speak this of himself only,
or of all men without exception or restraint that were without the Law? Not
Absolutely of all Men that were without the Law; for so the Gentiles, which
were not under the Law, which knew not God, nor his Laws, should have been so
alive, as the Apostle there says, he sometimes was; because they were more
without the Law, then he at any time was. Nor does he speak this of himself
alone, but of all such as he was; That is, of all such, and only such, as were
the Seed of Abraham, and had been circumcised the 8th. day, and by Circumcision
became under the Law, though for the present without the Law. So that as
Baptism now, so circumcision then did free the Children of Abraham from the
curse of the Law; did Translate them from the estate or Condition of the Sons
of wrath, to the Condition or Privilege of the Sons of God. But did the
Apostle or his brethren which were made alive by Circumcision in their Infancy,
continue in the same estate of Life until their mortal Lives end? No, The
Apostle expressly adds, But when the Commandment came, sin revived and I dyed.
So that sin, before the Commandment came, was dead: and revived when the Law
came. And the Apostle before the same point of time was alive; but then dyed.
When then did the commandment come, which by its coming did bring life to sin,
and death to this our Apostle, and such as he was? It is an Observation of very
good Use, which S. Basil has to this purpose, in his Comment upon the first
Psalm: See S. Basil's words at the End of this Chapter.
(...), When our Reason comes once to ripeness or perfection, That is fulfilled
which is written: Adveniente mandato revixit Peccatum, when the Commandment
comes, Sin revives. For when such as have submitted themselves to the Law of
God come to the use of Reason, or to take their Estate into Consideration, they
begin to examine their Consciences by the Law of God; and sin, which was before
Inherent, though quiet, being called in Question, grows desperate and
rebellious against the Law, by which it is examined; against the Judge, which
condemns it; and against the Party which calls it in Question. The Extract as
well of our Apostles speech, as of S. Basils Observation upon it, confirms the
Truth, Chap. 29. n. 5.
which was before delivered in the Treatise of Mortification; That the same
measure of Regeneration, which suffices during the time of Infancy or
Childhood, suffices not to save the same Parties when they come to Use of
Reason or Consideration; for then the Commandment comes upon us, a
Commandment to Mortify the deeds of the Flesh by the Spirit, to enter the
Lists or Combat with sin reviving in us, which will certainly kill us, unless
we mortify it, as it reviveth in us; or quell it as it rebels against us. So
that the estate or Condition of such as have been baptized, after once they
come to the use of Reason, is an estate different from their estate in their
Infancy or Childhood; an estate likewise different ordinarily from the Absolute
estate of Election. But of this estate, and of our Christian demeanor in it, I
shall now only say thus much in General. This Mortification of the Flesh,
which our Apostle injoynes, Romans 8. 13. is that Reasona^le Service, which the
same Apostle requires. Romans 12. 1. I beseech you therefore brethren by the
mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
acceptable unto God, which is your Reasonable Service. But why a Reasonable
Service? In opposition to the Service of the Law, which did consist in the
Sacrifice of Bulls and Goats and other Reasonless Creatures, which yet were
offered by the holy men of God in Testification of their Faith, or Expectation
of the promised Messiah. This Reasonable Service or Mortification of the Flesh
must be performed by us in Testification of our Belief, that he has
accomplished the Sacrifices of the Law by the Sacrifice of himself. Again; this
sacrifice or offering of Our selves, that is, of Mortifying our Brutish or
unreasonable affections by the Spirit, Aurum, Thus, Myrrham, Regique; Hominique
Deoque says Juvencus an old Poet, and Father that lived An. xii. 330.
is a great deal more acceptable to God, then the offerings, which the three
Kings or Wise men, offered unto our Savior Jesus Christ. They offered Gold,
Myrrh, and Frankincense in testimony or acknowledgement that the child then
born was the King of the Jews. But in as much as we know that we are not
redeemed with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a
Lamb without blemish, we cannot either Symbolize with the Sacrifice of our High
Priest, or attain to that live- Sympathy with him by the offering of silver,
gold, or any other kind of offering, besides the sacrifice of a broken and
contrite spirit. If, as He offered himself by the eternal Spirit to God the
Father for us, So we again offer up our selves to him by Mortifying our earthly
man by the Spirit; then his Blood, (as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 9. 14.) shall
thoroughly purge our Consciences from dead works to serve the living God, and
finally cleanse us from all our sins. Unto this Reasonable service or offering
up of our selves, We were consecrated by Baptism, This was a Sermon preached
upon the Epiphanie, as I take it.
and bound by solemn vow then made; and if we continue constant in performing
this Vow after we come to riper years, we shall continue in the state or
Condition of the Sons of God, which we had by Baptism; and by continuance or
Progress in this estate we shall arrive at the Immutable state of grace, or
absolute election; For, the end of the Son of Gods appearance or manifestation,
was, that he might thus lead us on from strength to strength, until we appear
before our God in Sion.

The Doctrine of Mortification (and the consequences thereof) were it thus
Taught, and Laid to the Consciences of Christian People as a main Part of their
Baptismal Vow, and pressed home as a Duty that concernd their everlasting
Salvation, would, by Gods Blessing, be likely to prove fruitful, as indeed it
is useful. For somewhat to enlarge that which has been Touched on, The use of
the former Doct. to condemn sloth: to prevent presumption and despair.
in the foregoing Chapter, this may be more particularly considered.

First, It leaves Sloth and Negligence in this Good Duty and of so high
Concernment, clean without excuse.

Secondly, Being rightly applied it serves as an Antidote both against
Presumption and Despair.

20. There is no way to make a Coward Hardy or Resolute in sight, but by
putting him upon some manifest exigent or apparent Necessity either of killing
his Adversary, or of being killed by him. So long as there is hope to escape by
Flight, or Nonappearance, it is a matter almost impossible to make a Timorous
spirit try his strength or ability. The foes or enemies with whom we are here
enjoined to fight, are our own Bodies, or, our own Flesh, which still fights
against our souls; from whose assaults there is no possibility of flight.
There is an apparent Necessity laid upon us either of killing the Deeds of the
Body, or of being more then killed by them. For if we Live after the flesh, or
suffer the works of the Flesh or deeds of the Body to live or reign in us, we
shall dye the death of the Soul. Did we truly apprehend the Necessity of this
choice, how were it possible for us to defer this Conflict with our own flesh
for one Moment.

21. Some not withstanding there be which see in part this necessity of dying,
by living after the flesh, and yet submit their Wills and Affections unto the
desires and lusts of the Flesh, as Men Condemned by Law do their Bodies to the
Officers of Justice or Executioners. This, These poor souls do; Some out of
Conscience, because they hold it unlawful to resist Authority; Some out of
weakness, as being not able to prevail, if they should struggle with
Authority. But neither of these Motives can have place in the former Case. For
First, the Conflict or Resistance of the Flesh is not only Lawful but
necessary; so necessary, that if after our promise in Baptism and participation
of the word and Sacraments we neglect the undertaking of this war with our
own bodies, we are in the same case that Soldiers are, which after they have
received Presse-money and good pay, run from their Colors. We justly incur
the Sentence of everlasting death, by not seeking to put the Deeds of this
mortal Body to death. We become perpetual slaves to Satan, by refusing to
fight with sin, which is Christ's enemy, and Satan's Agent.

22. Nor can we pretend that our endeavors to mortify the Deeds of the Body
are hopeless, or vain, because we are not able of our selves to think a good
thought, much less to give good success to our best endeavors. For the Apostle
(as you heard before) enjoynes us to work out our Salvation with fear and
trembling, that is, as men afraid to be idle or slothful for a moment; even
for this Reason, Because it is God that works in us both the Will and the
deed. And though the same Apostle has elsewhere said, That it is not of him
that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy; yet it is
a General Rule in Divinity, Finis dicendorum est ratio dictorum, our Apostles
speech must be taken from the end or General Scope at which he aimed. To what
end then does our Apostle give us the former or like Rule? To the end that we
should not will or desire our Mortification, nor run with alacrity toward the
Goal; which in every Epistle he sets Before us, to wit the Mortification of the
Flesh and life of the Spirit? or rather to kindle our desires to work, and stir
up our alacrity in working, yet so, as we still rely not upon our works or
endeavors, but merely upon the Good will and mercy of our God. He that says,
See Chapt. 41. and 42.
It is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs; but of God that
shows mercy, did never say, that it was not the Good Will or Pleasure of God
to show Mercy unto all, that abandoning all other ways run with what speed and
alacrity they can unto his Mercy. He that says, God will have mercy upon whom
he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth; did never say, that it was
Gods Will to harden any which deny themselves and their own doings, and wholly
betake themselves to his Infinite Goodness. His meaning, (sure) in that place
is, that as God will have mercy on none that seek salvation by works or other
prerogatives of the flesh, so he will harden none that put their confidence, not
it their works, but in his mercy.

23. The Sum of all that can in this Point be said, is; That no man can be
partaker of the promise of Life, but he that faithfully seeks for Mercy in
Christ Jesus. And no man can faithfully seek for mercy in Christ, but he that
sincerely renounceth his own works and merits. And no man can sincerely and
truly renounce his own works and merits, but he that is industrious and
laborious in these works of Mortification here enjoined Hypocrites and ungodly
persons will be ready in the day of Trial, to deny all hopes of salvation by
works, Chapt. 36.
or confidence in merits. But, as was intimated before, No man can be truly
said to renounce those good works, paragr. 7.
which he has left undone, but those works which he has done. No man can
truly deny himself but he that exercises himself in these works of
Mortification. We cannot possibly know our own Impotency or want of strength to
perform these works of Mortification as we ought, unless we make proof or
trial of our strength in working them as we can. The more we try our strength,
the more insufficient shall we find our selves; and the better Experience we
have of our own Insufficiency, the more earnestly will we (if we do as we
ought, for our own good) crave the assistance of Gods Spirit: the more
Faithfully will we rely on Christ, who is our strength and the Rock of our
Salvation, and so not presume.

24. Again, The former Doctrine is useful to prevent Despair in the days of
Temptation; Albeit we find our Transgressions of this precept to be great and
many. Our Apostle says not, If ye have lived after the flesh, ye shall dye;
for so no flesh should be saved. But his words are; if ye live after the flesh,
ye shall dye. If any man find his Conscience burdened with an heavy load of the
works of the Flesh, let him not take the frights, no nor the Scarres of
Conscience wounded by sins past, or the impressions by sin present, as
undoubted marks of Reprobation; yet let him call to mind, as often as he finds
himself prone to the works of the Flesh, that he may fall into Reprobation
before he be aware, if he continue secure in that Course of life, which
formerly be has taken; let him withal remember, that Praeterita non nocent si
praesentia non placent.

On the Otherside; is there any man whose Conscience can truly inform him that
he has sincerely labored to mortify the deeds of the Body? his Faith upon
this Information will assure him that he is in the way of Life, and that in
pat^eni Continuance in Well-doing, he shall be a Vessel unto honor, and make
his election sure, But let not any man hence Conclude that he is already in the
Immutable state of Grace. For our Apostle does not say, if ye have mortified
the deeds of the body by the spirit, ye are in the Immutable state of Life; but
he says; if ye mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye shall live: that is, if ye
Continue to mortify the deeds of the Body, God will Continue the blessings and
means of life unto you, yea Confirm you in the Immutable State of Life and
saving Grace.

25. If any man list to examine himself, whether he be in the state of Election
or Reprobation, let him measure or moderate his persuasions of the one or other
Estate, by his proficiency or negligence in this duty of Mortification.
Otherwise to be prepossest with strong persuasions of being in the Immutable
State of Grace or Election, before we have given all diligence to make our
election sure, by performing this Duty of Mortification, is the readiest or
most compendious way that Satan yet has found out, to cast men into a
Reprobate Sense, that is, to make them without sense or feeling of their
sins: or, which is worse, to misperswade them, that those very Deeds, whilst
done by Them, are no sins, or sins of Infirmity only, which being done by
Others are even in their Judgments gross and Capital sins. The Method, by
which Satan works this misperswasion in men (strongly persuaded of their own
Immutable state of Grace, before their due time) is Immutable and Infallible.
For it is an Infallible Rule in Logic and Nature; That, An Universal Negative
may be Simply converted. If no rich man (whilst a rich man) can be a beggar,
then no beggar (whilst he is a beggar) can be a rich man. If no convetous, no
proud, no envious, no seditious or uncharitable man, no doer of any of those
works of the Flesh mentioned by S. Paul, Gal. 5. can enter into the Kingdom of
heaven Then no man, whose entrance into it is Immutably determined, can be a
covetous, an evious, seditious or uncharitable man. Whence, if a man be once
persuaded, that his entrance into the Kingdom of heaven, or his estate in
Grace is unchangable, he cannot possibly persuade himself, or be persuaded by
others, that he is a covetous, proud, envious, seditious or an uncharitable
man, albeit he do all the works that a covetous, proud, envious, seditious or
uncharitable man does.

26. Lastly, although it be the safest way to examine our Estate in Grace by
our diligence in this duty of Mortification; yet I must admonish men not to
examine their proficiency or progress in performance of this Duty by Mere
Abstinence from the works of the Flesh, which they sincerely dislike or condemn
in others. I know we condemn the blind obedience of the Roman Catholics, that
are ready to do and believe as the Church commands them, without examination,
as a work of the Flesh, of which we are Freed; yet this does not argue that we
have mortified this work of the Flesh, this Blind Obedience, unless our
Consciences can truly inform us that we are ready to obey the Church our Mother
in things lawful, or in things, which upon diligent examination are not Evil,
but Indifferent.

We likewise condemn, as well the affected Ignorance of the Romish Catholic, in
that, though he may, yet he regards not to hear the Word preached in a Language
that he knows, as his blind Devotion, in that he can be content to make his
Prayers, or to hear public Prayers in a Language that he understands not, for
works of the Flesh. In both these we do well: yet are neither of these works
truly mortified in us by the Spirit, unless we be as ready and zealous to
join with the Congregation in public Prayers of the Church celebrated in a
known Tongue, as we are to hear or read Sermons. The Ministers must preach,
that the people may know how to pray aright in private. And the people must
join with them in Public Prayers appointed by the Church, that both may
practice according to the Rules of Life delivered whether by the word read or
preached. The Communion of Saints, or that part of it, which can be had
betwixt Saints here on earth, does specially consist, in the Unity of Faith,
and of Prayers publicly celebrated according to the Common Rule of Faith.

A Sermon Preached on St. SIMON and JVDE'S Day, 1629.
Jude Verse 4. For there are Certain men crept in unawares, which were before
of old ordained to this Condemnation, ungodly men, turning the Grace of our God
into Lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

Verse. And it is, in Brief, to exhort these his Flock or Charge, To contend
earnestly for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. The Word ONCE
is Emphatical, and imports Thus much; That the Rule of Faith had been Once for
all delivered unto them, so full and so complete, that if they would hold
close to it, and use it as the Rule of Life, they should need no other
additions, The occasion of writing it.
or increase of new points to be believed or practiced. The special occasion,
which he had to write unto them, for this end and purpose, was, because there
were Certain ungodly men crept in to their Society, which did overthrow or
contaminate that Rule of Faith, which had been delivered unto the Saints. But
how they did overthrow it, is not expressed in particular. Most certain it is
(for St. Jude expressly affirms it) that they did deny the only Lord God, and
our Lord Jesus Christ. Now to deny God or Christ, Two ways of denying God.
there be but Two ways possible: either by Opinion and Doctrine, or by Matter
of Fact and Practice. And these men it seems did both ways deny God, and his
Christ, though not directly and expressly, yet by necessary and unavoidable
Consequence. But wherein they did deny God and Christ, shall be touched in the
Use and Application.

The Doctrinal Points to be discussed are Two. Two points of Doctrine handled.


First, Unto what Condemnation they were of Old ordained.

Secondly, How, or in what manner they were ordained unto it.

2. There is An English Note upon this Place, A very strange One, yet gathered
as it seems from some good Writers, who did not so clearly express themselves
in their Comments upon this Place as might have been desired, See the 1. note
at the end of this Chapter.
and yet are far worse understood by many of their Followers, then they
meant. The English Note seems to imply, that these men were Ordained to trouble
the Church, or to follow those lewd Opinions or Practices, whereby the Church
was troubled, and the Faith of many brought into manifest hazard. Yet to say,
that any man is ordained by God to this or the like end, will be very harsh to
any Christian ears, and was (I am persuaded) either a branch of their Heresy,
which are here said to be ordained to Condemnation; or a Branch of the same
Root, worse then any Heresy, God ordains no man to sin.
which they maintained. And yet to say, That men are ordained to trouble the
Church, to be ungodly, and to deny Christ, is but the Necessary Consequent of
their Opinion, who hold, That all things, every Action of Man, even sinful
Actions, are so ordained and determined by God, that they cannot come to pass
otherwise then they do in the Individual; either for the Matter and Substance,
or for the circumstance of the action. Thus to write and thus to speak, some
are emboldened, because nothing can fall out without Gods Foresight, yea
without his Cooperation; For in him all things living do live, all things
endued with motion do move, and have their being. And in that nothing can be
done without him, in that he is Omnipotent, and supporteth the world by the
Word of his Power; they do not collect amiss that they cannot lay a load too
heavy upon him. But they should consider, God is no less holy and just then
powerful.
that seeing he is Holy and Just; no less Holy and Just, then he is Powerful,
they may lay that upon him, which is a great deal too foul for him to bear. The
foulest Aspersion, that can be cast upon his Holiness, is to make him the
Author of sinful Actions; To say or think he did Ordain men to trouble the
Church, or to be (as these men were) ungodly Persons, denyers of Christ.

3. To avouch in plain Terms, That God is the Author of sin, is, as most
confess, a dangerous Heresy, a sign of a darkened mind in spiritual knowledge.
And yet the blindness or ignorance would be more gross, if any man should
grant the Antecedent, and deny the Consequent. That is, if one should grant,
that God did ordain any man to persecute the Church, to turn his Grace into
wantonness; and yet withal deny that God in thus doing should be the cause and
Author of Sin. See the 6. Chapter.
He that is the Author or Cause of any Action which is Essentially evil, or,
universally inseparable from evil, is the Author and Cause of all the evil
which is inseparable from the Action, even in that he is the Cause of the
Action. For that which they call the Obliquity of the Action, or Malum Formale,
Formally Evil, can have no other cause at all, then that, which is the Cause
of the Action, from which this Formal evil is unseparable. So that if Gods
Ordinance be the Necessary Cause of such an Action, to wit, of Troubling the
Church, the same Ordinance must be the cause of the Obliquity or evil, which
is annexed unto it. Satan and wicked men should be but Causes Instrumental at
most; that is, such a cause as the sword is of the murder, which a man commits
with it. So that the Case is clear, that if to trouble the Church with lewd
Opinions be a sinful Action, then God, who is no Author of Sin, did never
ordain men unto that action; For whatsoever God does ordain or decree, God is
Author of that which be ordains.
he is the Author of it. These Inferences will admit no Plea or Traverse
amongst such, as are instructed in the Fundamental Rules of Art or Nature: For
all do grant, that which they call Obliquity, or Formal Evil, to be a Relation,
that is, such an entity, or Being unto which no Action can be immediately
terminated; it has its Being only by Concomitance or resultance from some
other Effect, which has a direct and Immediate Cause. Of this Nature are
Equality or Inequality of bodies; Similitude or Dissimilitude. Now it is
impossible that man or Angel, or any Cause whatsoever, should produce an
Equality between two bodies formally unequal, by any other means then by
altering the Quantity of one or both; or to make one body dislike unto another
but by altering their Qualities. Altogether as Impossible it is to produce an
Obliquity or Crookedness in men's ways, by any other means then by producing
those Actions, which are in their Nature Perverse and crooked. He which is the
Cause of such Actions in the Individual, is the Cause of that crookedness or
Obliquity, which is inseparably annexed unto them.

4. That God is not the Cause, not the Author of such Actions, or that such
Actions are not necessary in respect of his Decree, Christianity it self or the
Rule of Catholic Faith binds us to believe, as firmly, as that there is a God,
who is the Author or Fountain of Goodness. Hence says St. James, Cap. 1. ver.
13. Let no man say when he is tempted, he is tempted of God, for God cannot be
tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man unto evil; but every man is
tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. And unto this
inconvenience of being tempted by his own lust, man was not subject until he
was beguiled by Satan; nor could this great tempter work evil in man
immediately or directly, but only by tempting or enticing him to that Action, to
which evil was unseparably annexed, that is, to taste of the fruit, which God
had forbidden. The Tempter knew, that if he could entice our first Parents unto
this Action, there was no possibility of shedding the Obliquity or Formal evil
from it, which was essentially annexed unto it. Now if God had ordained man to
this Individual Action, or to the condemnation which was due to this Action,
without possibility of avoiding it, His Ordination had been a more true Cause
of the first man's sin and of his death and ours, then Satan was. For Satan had
no power either natural or permitted him by God, to make any ordinance or
decree for man, no power either given or permitted to lay a necessity of
sinning upon our first Parents. All that he was able, or permitted, to do, was
only by way of temptation or inticement. Adam, as all grant, had a Freedom of
Will in respect of Satan or any inticement, that he could propose unto him: But
Freedom of Will he could have had none in respect of Gods Decree or Ordination,
if it were true that God had ordained him to eat the Forbidden fruit. For the
Rule is most certain, That God is the Cause and Author of whatsoever he Ordains
men to do; and hence we read, that God has Ordained us to good works, to
newness of Life, to the performance of all those duties, which are commanded.
But we never read in Scripture (and let it never be read in any other Book, but
with indignation; let it never be spoken or thought upon by any Christian, but
with detestation) that God should ordain men to walk in the ways of Cain, or to
tread in the paths of ungodliness. The Conclusion then is firm and sound, That
these men here mentioned in St. Jude, The conclusion of the first point.
were not ordained to trouble the Church, but ordained, and that of old, unto
that Condemnation which is due, to such as trouble the Church, or to
ungodliness; And that is a fearful condemnation as St. Jude expresses it, ver
13. For to them (says he) is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. And
if this were reserved unto them, or for them, they were first ordained unto it;
the Sentence was already past upon them, albeit the Execution be deferred
until the Judgment of the great day. But unto this condemnation they were
ordained, because they had followed the ways of Cain, and run greedily after
the error of Balaam, as St. Jude tells us, ver. 11. But far be it from us to
think that they were ordained to follow the ways of Cain, who was the first
troubler of the Church, that they might be condemned. And thus much of the
First point, what Condemnation is here meant, or unto what they were ordained;
That was not to trouble the Church, but to everlasting torments for troubling
the Church by wicked Lives and Lewd Opinions.

5. The second Point.
The Second General was, What Ordination is here meant, or in what manner
these men are said to be ordained to this Condemnation. Many take it as
granted, that, Ordination to everlasting death, is, the very same that
Reprobation is; Yet if this were a time, or this a place fitting for discussion
of this point it might be easily made to appear, that although Reprobation
include surely an Ordination to death, yet every ordination to death does not
include Reprobation; For Ordination to life and Predestination, and Ordination
to death and Reprobation, differ as much as Genus and Species, as a Reasonable
Creature does differ from a Sensitive Creature. But to let this pass; This
place of St. Jude is, in the opinion of many good Writers, Equivalent to that
of St. Peter. 1. Ep. 2. Cap. 8. ver. They stumble at the word being
disobedient, whereunto also they were Appointed. But for that place, I suppose
he means Mr. Byfield who is far from the Rigidness of some in that point.
it is ingenuously and discreetly expounded by a late English Writer in his
Comments upon that Epistle And it were to be wished, that his Exposition were
sincerely embraced, by such as had the man in esteem while he lived, and are
much beholding to his writings (especially upon this Epistle) since he dyed. I
shall only now give you notice that the Original word in this place of S.
Jude, rendered by ordained, is not the same with that in St. Peter; That is
(...), and is well rendered Appointed. Nor is it the same with that of St. Paul,
Act. 13. 48. As many as were ordained ((...),) unto eternal Life, believed. S.
Judes word here is (...), that is, as some render it, Praescripti, prescribed;
Of whom it was forewritten to this condemnation. But as Beza, descripti; that
is, as men designed, taxed, or proscribed to this condemnation. It includes
then an Ordinance or somewhat more, to wit an Ordinance upon Record: but in
what Record? In Gods everlasting Book of death? or may we say that he has such
a Book? It is evident that there be more Books then One, out of which men shall
be Judged at the last day, according to their works, The 2. General subdivided.
as St. John tells us, Rev. 20. 12.

The Points then Remaining to be discussed are Two. First, In what Sense these
men are said to be foreordained to everlasting death, or in what Sense men are
said to be Reprobated from everlasting, or from Eternity?

The Second, Whether our Apostle in this place did expressly and punctually mean
Gods eternal Decree of reprobation, or some other ordination to death?

6. In handling the first Point, I shall only explicate that which I have
elsewhere delivered, See the 37. Chap.
to wit, That albeit, whosoever is reprobated, is reprobated from eternity; yet
no man at the time of his Baptism is a Reprobate; Numb. 16. and Pharaohs
hardening.
few or none are born in that estate or condition; but such as finally perish
do fall into it. The Case may be made clear by diverse Instances, wherein men,
even by humane Laws, may be sentenced to death or other punishment before they
be born, and yet at the time of their birth, or within some few days before
their death or punishment, be no more liable to the Sentence of the Law, then
other men are. For unto death, or other grievous punishment there is required,
for the most part, as well the Sentence of the Judge, as the Sentence of the
Rule or Law. And yet in some peculiar Cases, no more is required then the
Sentence of the Law or Rule, Sententia Judicis, and Sententia Juris.
which was made and given many hundreds of years before the Party was born,
which is sentenced by it. Every one that commits murder is liable to death
by the Law; But besides the Sentence of the Law, or the Rule, which is General
to all, there is required the Sentence of the Judge to apply the Law to this
Particular; and before he give sentence, there is further required a Formal
Process, not only for proof of the Fact it self, but of the Quality of it.
And, until this Process be observed, the Judge himself may not give Sentence
although he himself saw the the Fact committed. Nor may the Party be executed
or put to death by any, until the Judge have given Sentence. He is condemnable
before the Jurie pass upon him, but not condemned when the Jury finds him
guilty, until the Judge pass sentence upon him. But if a private man shall
take up Arms against his Sovereign Lord, or the state wherein he lives, he is
rebellious Ipso Iure, he is a Rebel by Law, there needs no other Trial or
Formal Process, besides the Evidence of the Fact. The Martial or General is
only to put the Law in Execution, and the Party thus rebelling is sentenced to
death by the Law, which was in force many hundreds of years before the party
offending was born, who not withstanding is not liable to this Sentence of
death till he commit the Fact, at which the Law does immediately strike, not at
his Person. Again, there is ordinarily required to Excommunication, not only
Sententia Iuris, but Sententia Iudicis; Though the Canon, by which he is
Excommunicated, were made Long before, yet he that offends against the Canon,
is not forthwith Excommunicated by it, until he be refractory or Contumacious.
The Judge may admonish before he give Sentence, and without his sentence
judicially given the party is not excommunicated by the Law. But some peculiar
Cases there be, wherein a man may stand Immediately Excommunicated by the law or
Canon, without the sentence of the Judge: there is no place left for Admonition
or recanting. The Fact being once proved, either by witnesses or by its own
Evidence, the Judge has no more to do, but to read the Canon, and to pronounce
that the party has fallen upon it. So that he is said to be excommunicated by
the Law or Canon, which was made perhaps a thousand years before he was born,
and yet not born an excommunicate person, or in the State of excommunication;
into this estate he falls by doing some Fact or other, at which the Rule or
Canon does immediately strike, without further Process or Conviction. Now in
as much as the Sentence was given before he was born, it cannot be denied but
that he was excommunicated before he was born, and yet had not been
excommunicated at all, unless he had done that Fact which requires
Excommunication by the Law.

7. Some Founders of Colleges appoint a Process or Formal proceeding against
Offenders, even in grosser Crimes; as for Adultery, Murder, manifest Perjury,
or the like, before any man can be expelled for these and the like Crimes. Such
as they appoint Judges must give Sentence Viva voce, upon the examination, not
of the Fact only, but of the Quality of the Fact; as whether it be Scandalous
in so high a degree, as deserves Amotion without further Admonition or
expectation of amendment. And every one that is in these Cases amoved or
expelled, is expelled by his present Judges, not immediately by his Founder or
his Statutes; though the Judges must proceed according to their intent or
meaning. But in case any of the same society, the very Governors themselves
should obtain a License or Dispensation for their Oath there needs no sentence
of any Judge, there is no place for Admonition or Traverse: because the
Founders themselves, even when they made these Laws and statutes, inflicted
these punishments upon all such as in this kind transgress their statutes. Now
upon whomsoever the Founder of any Society, which dyed some two or three
hundred years ago did inflict the punishment of Expulsion by virtue of this
present Statute, he did inflict it before the party offending was born: and yet
this punishment had not at all fallen upon him, unless he had committed that
Fact, which the Founder in his life time did thus severely censure, whenever
it should by any of his Society be committed. See the Note at the end of this
Chapter.
Now in this case we may truly say, that the party thus offending does * expel
himself by committing that Fact, for which he was expelled by his Founder. The
Founder then expels him before he was born, without any respect unto his
Person; ^or no Lawgiver makes any Decree or Law against any man's Person, but
against men's Misdemeanors; but the party cannot be said to expel himself
before he does dash against the inflexible Law or statute.

8. And if no Lawgiver on earth, how partial soever, make any Capital Decrees
against any man's person; Far be it from us to think, that the Eternal
Lawgiver, who is himself the Everliving Rule of Justice and Equity, should
sentence any man's Person to everlasting death; albeit whosoever is sentenced to
everlasting death, be so sentenced from Eternity, because God himself, who is
Eternal, is the very Rule or Law, a Law or Rule inflexible, which cannot alter,
and yet rewards every man according to all his ways and works; not according
to his Person or Individual Nature. Whosoever then is reprobated by God, is
Reprobated by him before he be born, even from Eternity; and yet no man
Baptized is born a Reprobate, or becomes so until he reprobate himself by
committing those sins, or rather that measure of sin, unto which the Eternal
Lawgiver did, before all Times, award final exclusion from the Benefits of
Christ's Death and Passion. Now unto such ungodly men, as St. Jude here speaks
of, this Award was allotted from Eternity, and thus they were ordained to
Condemnation: But their Persons were not created or made to ungodliness.
Taking them as now they are, there was a Necessity from Eternity that they
should perish; but there was No necessity from eternity that they should be
such ungodly men as now they are. This necessity did accrue in time, they
wilfully and freely brought it upon themselves.

Thus much of the First Part of the Second General, to wit, In what sense it is
true, That whosoever is reprobated, or ordained to everlasting death in time,
was so reprobated or ordained from Eternity. The meaning is, that the Law, or
Rule, by which he is reprobated, or ordained to death, has no beginning of
Date, it was unchangably set from Eternity. Yet was this Law or rule an
Immanent Act, that is, contained in him only who is Eternal; it dit did not
produce any Real effect answerable unto it, either for the creature before he
was made, or in the creature after he was made, until he have made up that
measure of Sin, unto which everlasting death was by this Eternal living Rule
awarded. But the measure of sin being made up, then (as the Lawyers speak)
Indicium transit in rem judicatam, that is, the eternal Law or sentence
produces a Transient Effect in the Creature so qualified, and that is an
Ordination Passive, the beginning of that death which shall have no end.

9. The Second Part of the Second General, Second part of the second General.
which was the last Doctrinal point, was; Whether St. Jude, in this place, be
to be understood of Gods eternal design or Ordination unto death, or of some
written Ordination or Ruled Case, which did as truly fit these men, taking them
as now they are, as it did other ungodly persons of old, against whom the
Sentence of Condemnation here meant was denounced or declared by other of Gods
Ambassadors. That these ungodly men here in S. Jude, were Foreordained to
this condemnation the word (...) does literally and clearly evince: but whether
this Fore-ordination were in S. Iudes intent or meaning a Fore-ordination from
Eternity, the literal importance of the word (...) of old, does make it
questionable, or rather puts it out of question that he did not so mean. For it
is an Adverb of Time and never reaches, to my observation, so far as (...),
or (...); is not so much as if he had said, in the Beginning or from the
beginning; much less does it amount unto so much as if he had said before all
worlds, or before the foundation of the world was laid; which words, or the
like, do import Eternity. And unto this literal Importance or signification of
the word (...), The material or real Circumstances do fully accord: Both do
fully witness that he speaks only of some Fore-ordination made or declared in
the compass of Time as, ver. 11. Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of
Cain and run greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in
the gainsaying of Core. This Woe denounced, takes Date only from the Time of
their following the ways of Cain, of Balaam and Corah. God did not ordain
either from Eternity, or by any written Sentence upon Record, That these men,
by name, should go on in the ways of Cain, should run after the error of
Balaam, should perish in the gainsaying of Corah. But now that they had visibly
followed the ways of these wicked men, they were (...) Fore-sentenced, or
Foreordained to the same condemnation which had fallen upon Cain, Balaam, and
Corah. The Sentence or Judgment declared of old against these Three, was as a
Ruled Case for the condemnation of these men that S. Jude speaks of; they had
incurred the Sentence of condemnation given of old, as we say; Ipso Facto: that
is, by doing the same things which Cain, Balaam, and Corah had done. And S.
Jude, whether by the Spirit of Revelation, or by Evidence of their Facts
themselves, does but declare or pronounce that these ungodly men had fallen
fowl upon that immovable Rule or Canon, which had formerly been declared
against Cain and Corah and his Confederates.

10. That these men now were in the same state, wherein Cain and Corah were
after they had committed these Foul sins for which they were condemned, our
Apostle takes it as granted, ver. 12, 13. These are spots in your feasts of
Charity when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they
are without water, carried about with winds, trees whose fruit withers,
without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; Raging waves of the Sea,
foming out their own shame, wandering stars, to whom is reserved the Blackness
of darkness for ever. He speaks of them as of Reprobates or men ordained to
condemnation. For being in the same state or condition, for the Quality and
measure of their sins, that Cain, Balaam, and Corah had been, they were
Foreordained with them to the same condemnation; and this their
Fore-Ordination was upon Record in all that Moses or others had written
concerning Gods Judgments upon Cain, upon Balaam or Corah. That our Apostle
means such a Fore-Ordination upon Ancient Record we gather from the 14. verse.
And Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these, saying; Behold the
Lord comes, etc. If Enoch ALSO did prophecy of them, then some other besides
Enoch had prophesied of them. So had Moses, who related Gods Judgments upon
Cain, prophesied of their Judgments, who followed the ways of Cain; and in
foretelling Gods fearful Judgments upon Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, he foretold
the condemnation of all such as followed their ways, and were Foreordained to
the like condemnation in their condemnation; But more expressly Foreordained of
old unto the same condemnation by Enochs Prophecy, which was more ancient then
Moses his writings, although Moses mentioned it not. The form of his Prophecy,
or of his Judgments denounced against all ungodly men, The Book of Enoch. Of
it, See Tertul. De Cultu Foem. Lib. 1. Cap. 3. and the Annot. upon that place.
was upon Record in our Apostles time in a Book, called the Book of Enoch, unto
which, or so much of which as concerns this place, St. Jude gives Authentic
testimony ver. 14. etc. Behold the Lord-cometh with ten thousand of his Saints,
To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them
of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their
hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. This Prophecy was
literally meant and in particular directed against the ungracious seed of Cain,
and other such ungodly men of the Old World, as did oppose or malign the Church
of God, then seated in the Posterity of Seth: of which Enoch was a principal
member, a man of high place or dignity; but the same Prophecy was literally
meant of these ungodly men, which did oppose the Church and deny that Lord,
which Enoch foretold should come to give judgment upon all such, as continue
in ungodliness. And though this Prophecy were verified, or in some measure
fulfilled in the ungodly men of the Old World; yet was it more exactly
fulfilled in these ungodly men here in St. Jude, and shall be fulfilled again
upon all such as they were, unto the worlds end; and all, in whom it is, or
has been, or shall be fulfilled, are by it Ordained to the Condemnation here
meant; and St. Jude having perfect notice that these ungodly men had followed
the ways of Cain, and of Corah, does but pronounce or declare them to be
liable to the Condemnation foretold by Enoch. But whether all of them were at
this time in the absolute State of Reprobation, that is, irreversibly ordained
to everlasting death; or whether the Gate of Mercy, and Way to Repentance, were
everlastingly shut up against all of them, That we leave to the eternal Judge,
seeing the 22. verse mentions Compassion for some, and making a difference.

11. The Jews highest Excommunication taken from Enochs words
However. This Prophecy of Enoch was so famous and so Authentic in the Jewish
Church before St. Jude wrote this Epistle, that their GREAT AND FEARFVL
EXCOMMVNICATION was conceived in the very Form of Words, which S. Jude here,
out of Enochs, uses. And as Writts amongst us have their name or Title from
the First and Principal words contained in them, as some are called Sub Poena,
some Nisi prius etc. so the greatest and most fearful Excommunication, which
the Jewish Church did use, was called THE EXCOMMVNICATION OF DOMINVS VENIET.
THE LORD SHALL COME. St. Paul, as we read, Romans 9. 3. did wish that he himself
might be, Anathema, one excommunicated or separated from Christ for his
Contrymen, or kinsmen according to the flesh. But he did not wish himself to
be Anathema Maranatha for their sakes. This kind of Anathema or
Excommunication, though he considently denounces against all such in the
Church of Corinth, as did not love their Savior. If any man, says he, 1 Cor.
16. 22. love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha; that is,
all one, as if he had said; Let that Sentence, which Enoch first denounced
against all ungodly and wicked men, especially against all Blasphemers of God,
of Christ, or the ways of the truth, fall upon him whosoever he be, that after
so many miracles wrought in Christ's name, and so great manifestation of the
truth revealed in his Gospel, does not love the Lord, which has redeemed him.
So then all in the Church of Corinth, that did not at this time love Christ,
were excommunicated, or ordained of old to that condemnation by the sentence,
which Enoch had given in General: and S. Paul only declares them Incidisse in
Canonem, to have fallen under that Fearful Sentence of Condemnation. Thus
far of the Two Doctrinal Points proposed, as first, What condemnation it is
where unto these men were ordained. Secondly, In what manner they were ordained
of old.

12 Now for Application, let us inquire what Special sins they were, by which
they fell under this Sentence first denounced by Enoch against the ungodly men
of his time; The Application.
or denounced by God himself against Cain, or by his servant Moses against
Corah. One Principal Sin was, to Despise Dominion, and speak evil of Dignities;
that is, of men in high place or Authority whether in Church or Commonwealth,
ver. 8. And this sin he aggravates from the contrary behavior of Michael the
Archangel, even towords the Devil himself, who had no dignity or dominion but
usurped, ver. 9. But these men speak evil of those things, which they know not:
and what they know naturally as bruit beasts, in those things they corrupt
themselves. Now as we know the form or figure of the seal, which we see not, by
the impression or stamp which it leaves in the wax or paper: So some men there
be in our time, who express that Character, which St. Jude has put upon these
ungodly men, as fully in their daily talk and conversation, as if St. Jude had
fitted it for them, or expressed them by name. Such there are, that bring railing
accusations against their Betters, against all of what rank or place soever in
the Church, which dissent from them in Opinions concerning Election or
Reprobation, or the Tenor of Gods Decree, being points, which they understand
not; and yet speak evil of them that seek to rectify their Error. But in
things which are plain and easy to be understood, which the very heathen knevv
by light of nature; as in points of Obedience to their lawful Prince, or to
such as are in Authority under him, in these (shall I say as our Apostle
says?) like bruit beasts they corrupt themselves: Sure I am they are more
bruitishly ignorant, then the ancient heathen Romans, or then the Modern
Turks, or most Modern Infidels are. Another special branch of these men's
ungodliness was the Turning the Grace of God into wantonness: and what do they
else, that trouble themselves and their neighbors with intricate disputes, how
the Grace of God does cooperate with man in his Conversion or Regeneration;
and yet in the mean time violate the bond of peace and charity by their
uncivil rude behavior, and scurrilous manner of speech and writing. But it is
no marvel if they sow discord amongst Christian men, who bend the strength of
their wits and pens to (nurse or) Course a Faction betwixt Gods Grace to his
Elect, and his Goodness toward All; especially to whom he vouchsafes the Use
of his Sacraments. Now to deny Gods infinite Goodness, or to cut the wings of
his mercy, so short as some men do, is to deny the Lord God, and that in a
worse manner (for matter of Opinion) then these men here in St. Jude can be
convinced to have done. How some deny Christ.
But do they likewise deny the Lord Christ? Surely they deny him to be the Lord
Redeemer of Mankind, by denying that he paid the Ransom for ALL; especially
for ALL that are Baptized in his Name. For if Christ did not pay the Ransom
for ALL that are baptized in his Name, Then is he not their Lord by right of
Redemption, as well, as by right of Creation: that is, then he is no otherwise
Lord of them, then he is of Devils; for even of them he is Lord by right of
Creation; and if Christ be no otherwise Lord of such as are baptized in his
name then he is of Devils, then we are false witnesses of Christ, when we teach
such as are baptized, such as shall be admitted unto Baptism to believe in
Christ as their Redeemer. Again, were it true that Christ did dye for the Elect
only, then no man could be more sure that Christ did pay the Ransom for his
sins, and that he has purchased the remission of his sins, then he is, that he
is in the number of the Elect. Now no man is bound to believe, no man may
safely believe at his First Admission into the Church, that, he is in the
number of the Elect; See the 3. note at the end of this Chapt.
that is, in the number of such as shall not Finally Perish. If then we should
teach men or children, that Christ dyed only for the Elect, we shall leave no
possible Mean between Infidelity and Presumption; for if we teach them that
Christ died only for the Elect, they must remain in the estate of Infidels and
Unbelievers, until they believe that they are of the number of the Elect. And
if we teach them to begin their Belief in Christ at this Point, That they are
of the number of the Elect, then both they and we fall into the very dregs of
their Heresy, whom St. Jude here says were foreordained to condemnation. This
was the very Root of their ungodliness. And for this reason St. Jude in the
very next verse unto the Text puts the Church (to whom he wrote this Epistle)
in remembrance, of that which had been before delivered unto them; to wit, that
albeit God had delivered All the People out of Egypt; yet after wards he
destroyed such as believed not, that is, such as continued not in their First
Belief. This then was the Sum of the Faith Once delivered unto the Saints;
that they were all delivered by Christ's death, from the slavery of Satan, and
that this deliverance was as truly sealed unto them by the blood of Christ, as
the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt was by the blood of the Paschal
Lamb. Yet for all this they must not presume, that they could not or should not
finally perish, seeing God destroyed many in the wilderness, which he had
delivered out of Egypt. Our Apostle then, if we will follow his directions,
puts us into the Middle or safe Way between the contrary extremes of
Reprobation and Election, and the Mean or Middle Way is, That A Great Part of
men, which have been Baptized, are neither in the one State nor in the other:
But, as has been before declared in the last foregoing Chapters.

showing, that such men trouble not the Church at All-adventures, but are
appointed thereunto by the Determinate Counsel of God.] Thus it is in that
Edition; Though in some Bibles with Notes, since printed, some words, or part
of that Note is omitted.

2. To Fol. 3168. To Those words in in the 7. Paragraph of this 38. Chapter.
[The Party thus offending does expel himself --.] The Heathens had a Notion
very remarkable, That the Gods were desirous to show mercy; at least to be
quiet, and not to have their Justice provoked, by the sins of men. Coelum ipsum
petimus Stultitia: neque per nostrum patimur scelus, Iracunda Iovem ponere
fulmina, says Horace, Carm. l. 1. Ode. 3. It is a complaint usual with Salvian,
Salv. Lib. 1.
in his Books de Gubern: Dei. That though God were loath to pumish, yet men did
exigere and extorquere ut perirent; And that they did vim facere, manus infer
pietati Divinae, and omni peccatorum scelere quasi omni telorum genere
misericordiam Dei expugnare. And yet for all this Complained of Gods severitie:
whereas, nos nobis, nos accusandi sumus. Lib. 4.
Nam cum ea quibus torqueamur admittimus, ipsi tormentorum nostorum autores
sumus. -- Isa. 50. 11.
Unusquisque nostrum ipse se punit, and ideo illud Propheticum ad nos dicitur:
Ecce omnes vos ignem accendit is, and vires praebet is Flammae, Ingredimini in
Lucemignis vestri and flammae quam accendist is. Totum namque humanum genus hoc
ordine in poenam aeternam ruit, quo scriptura memoravit. Primum enim accendit,
postea vires ignibus praebet, postremo flammam ingreditur quam paravit. Quando
igitur primum sibi homo aeternum accendit ignem? sc. cum primum peecare
incipit. Quando autem vires ignibus praebet? Cum utique peccatis peccata
cumularit. Quando vero ignem aeternum introibit? quando irremediabilem jam
Omnium Malorum summam Crescentium delictorum iniquitate Compleverit. Mat. 23.
32.
Sicut Salvator noster ad Iudaeos ait: Implete mensuram patrum vestrorum --.
And in his seventh Book. Quicquid actum est, peccatis, non Deo ascribendum:
Salv. Lib. 7.
quia recte illi rei factum ascribitur, quae ut ita fieret, exegit. Nam and
Homicida cum a judice occiditur suo scelere punitur: Et Latro aut Sacrilegus
cum flammis Exuritur, suis criminibus concrematur. This agrees with the Rules
of Civil Law; Qui causam dat damni ipsum Damnum dedisse videtur. Qui sceleratum
Consilium cepit, exinde quodammodo sua mente punitus est. So the Emperors
Severus and Antoninus (in L. 34. D. de Jure Fisci:) Rescripserunt Asclepiadi;
Ipse te huie poenae subdidisti. Ex quo notant D. D. Eum qui delinquit, hoc ipso
praesumi voluisse obligare sese ad poenam ei delicto praestitutam. (See
Macarius his 4. Homily, where he Cites Romans 2. 5. Thou -- treasurest up to thy
self wrath --. and Hom. 12. Interrog. 5.) Yea sure; most Certain it is, That
every One which commits any sin, together with, yea in the very Commission of
that sin, enters an Obligation, and forfeits himself to the very same
punishment which the Divine Justice has inflicted or awarded unto that sin, in
the Examples recorded in Holy Scripture. Achan bound himself to appear in the
Valley of Achor or Trouble, by the very taking of the wedge and clothes, which
were indeed no other then the Earnest of those wages which were there paid unto
him. Ahab and Iezabel by seazing on Naboth and his Vineyard forfeited their
bloods to the Dogs. Gehezi brought back the Syrian Leprosy wrapped up in the
Raiment, etc. Even so! Holy, and True, and Righteous are Thy Judgments O Lord:
who would not fear Thee, O King of Nations, which have Ordained that an
Inordinate mind should not only Breed and bring forth, but Be a Punishment, an
Executioner, a witness, and a Judge unto it self. This last Observation is
(partly) S. Austin's. That which follows is a Heathen's.

Exemplo quodcunque malo Committitur, ipsi
Displicet Authori. Prima est haec ultio, quod, se
Iudice nemo nocens absolvitur; improba quamvis
Gratia fallacem Praetoris vicerit urnam, etc.
See Iuvenals. 13. Sutyre.
The 3. Note (taken out of the Authors writings) relates to Fol. 3172. at the
2. Marginal Note. Some deny all Baptismal Grace; Others grant, that some Grace
is given to Infants in Baptism, but restrain it only to Infants Elect. So they
expound the Church-Catechism, which teaches children to believe, [That as
Christ redeemed them and all mankind; so the Holy Ghost does sanctify them and
all the Elect People of God.] But who can think, that our Church meant to teach
Children, at the first Profession of their Faith, to believe, they were Elect,
that is, such as cannot finally perish? This was to teach them their Faith
backwards, to seek heaven by descending from it. S. Paul; nay, The Angels that
have kept their first Estate almost 6000. years could not reach higher. Yet
would our Church have every one, at his first Profession of Faith, believe,
that he is One of the Elect people of God. Those RR. Fathers that composed that
Catechism, and our H. mother that did Authorize it, did in charity presume,
that every one which would take upon him to expound that Catechism, or other
Principles of Faith, should first know the Distinction between Elect, that is,
such as cannot perish, and the Elect people of God: or, between Election unto
Gods ordinary Grace or means of Salvation, and Election unto Glory. Every
Nation or Company of men when first Converted from Gentilism to Christianity,
became an Elect people, a chosen Generation; that is, they and their seed were
made capable of Baptism, reciev'd an Interest in Gods Promises, etc. which
Heathens whilst Heathens could not have. All of us are in Baptism thus far
sanctified, that we are made true Members of the visible Church, qualifyed for
hearing the word, receiving the Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood, and all
other Benefits of Christ's Priestly Function that are committed to the
Dispensation of his Ministers here on earth. Out of This the Reader may easily
Pick what is Pertinent to that place, Fol. 3172.

A Note Relating to the Chapter following.
This Learned Author, in the year 1628. Published his sixth Book of Comments
upon the Creed; or, his Treatise of the Divine Essence and Attributes.
Immediately where upon, Mr. H. Burton taking offense, Published his book styled
Isreal's Fast, Perhaps he might preach some part of it at the Fast held in the
Beginning of the Parliament called that year. In the Epistle Dedicatory perfix't
to that Book, he has The words cited in the following Chapter.

See Isreal's Fast printed in the year 1628. which is owned by Mr. Burtons Name
sub-printed; Though neither the Printer, nor the Place where it was Printed be
set down. See also The Narration of Mr. H. Burton his Life written by Himself;
and Printed in London 1643. (The Printers name is not there set down) in the
fifth Page of which Book, he owns The Book styled Isreal's Fast, and says it was
published at a General Fast.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
Dr. JACKSON'S VINDICATION of himself: written above twenty years ago.
OR, A Serious Answer to Mr. Burtons Exception taken against a Passage in his
Treatise of the Divine Essence and Attributes.
AGainst A Treatise of the Divine Essence and Attributes lately published by
me, some Exceptions have been taken, many sought; as if it did open a Gap unto
Arminianism. And yet I have not had the happiness to know, either what Point of
Arminianism they be, which I am suspected to favor, or the particular
Proposition in that Treatise, upon which the Indefinite or confused Suspicion
is grounded. Only thus far, I have been beholden unto One man that it has
pleased him to avouch a quarrel against One Passage in my Book, with
subscription of his Name. And it is expected by some (but by few of my good
Friends) that I should give him a Serious Answer. For my own part, I have ever
held it, a point, not of Folly only, but of Cowardice and Inhumanity, to accept
a Challenge from a man, desperately set to wast his spirits, to spend his
strength to wound himself, and the Cause he undertakes; by a long and furious
fight with his own shadow; before he can find the way into the appointed
Field. Wherefore leaving him with his Assistants, and Abettors to wrestle or
combat with their own Imaginations, which (as I see) will find them Play
enough, and make the Enemies of that Religion which they would profess (if they
knew how) too much Sport; I shall craveleave, Three things proposed.
First, To unfold this man's Notorious Falsification of my Assertion. Secondly,
to show the Orthodoxall Truth of that Assertion which he falsifieth, with the
dangerous and Unchristian Consequences of the Proposition Contradictory unto
it. Thirdly, To make it appear how deeply it concerns every Loyal member of
the Church and Commonweal of England (especially such as are engaged with me to
maintain the Religion which we all profess, against the Doctrine of the Church
of Rome) to prevent the further speading of that rigid Doctrine of Absolute
Reprobation, as it is held by most, if not by all, which have hitherto excepted
against the forementioned Treatise of the Divine Essence and Attributes.

2. The first Exception, which to my knowledge was taken against it, was in a
Book entitled, Isreal's Fast, dedicated to the Royal Joshua, and Loyal Elders of
Israel now happily assembled in Parliament. In the Epistle before that Book, he
has Verbatim; These Words; [ These Neutralizers or Popish Arminians, or
Arminian Papists, (...) what you will, under the name of the Church of England,
dare vent any Arminian Heresy. As in a Book lately printed, by Authority too,
there is This most Blasphemous Arminian Heresy; That there is a Goodness
Objective, In the Creature, which in Order of Nature is precedent to the Act or
exercise of Gods Will; thus, by necessary Consequence making the Creature a
God, having a Self-Being, Independent, but only upon Gods bare Prescience, upon
which, and not upon that Supreme Cause of Causes, Gods Will, he hangs the
Being, and well-being of all the Creatures.] And in the Margin of that Epistle
just over against the words last quoted, he has these words also. [Gods
eternal and blessed Will, Providence, Wisdom, Free Grace, Glory, and
consequently his whole Essence overturned by an Arminian Trick, and that also
backed with abused Authority.]

3. If the Exhibiter of this Complaint will acquit himself from a double
slander, he must (as I conceive, the course of all Justice requires) prove
these Two points following.

First, That the Proposition which he charge with most Blasphemous Arminian
Heresy, is, or has been maintained by Arminius or some Arminian.

Secondly, That the same Proposition has been uttered, or maintained by me.

That Arminius, or any Arminian, did ever in writing, or otherwise, deliver or
mantain that Proposition which this Objector has censured for a most
Blasphemous Arminian Heresy, is more then I know, more then I can suspect, and
more (I think) then the Author of this Accusation can prove; unless his
meaning be, that any absurd or Blasphemous Opinion, may justly be fathered upon
Arminius, or ascribed unto the Arminians. And if this be his meaning he will
prove him self to be a more Gross Arminian Heretic, then those whom he only
suspects, (but proves nothing) of most Blasphemous Arminian Heresy. For I
never heard or read that Proposition which he charge with most Blasphemous
Arminian Heresy delivered by any, save only by the Author of the forementioned
Epistle to the Royal Joshua, and Loyal Elders of Israel.

4. This Proposition following, I acknowledge to be mine, and have avouched it
in A Treatise of the Divine Essence and Attributes, Cap. 13. Par. 3. Page in
quarto 149. As there is a Logical Possibility presupposed to the working of the
Almighty Power: so there is a Goodness Objective precedent in order of Nature
to the Act or exercise of his Will. That either this Logical Possibility which
is presupposed to the working of the Almighty Power, or the Objective Goodness
which is precedent in order of Nature to the Act or exercise of Gods Will
should be IN THE CREATVRE, I never writ, I never said, I never was so
uncharitable as to think, that any man in his right wits had ever said or writ
it, until I read it in the forecited Epistle, without any Distinction of
Letter, Point, or Parenthesis, to notify whether these words IN THE CREATVRE]
were contained in my Proposition, or inserted by the Author of that Epistle,
out of some Probable Collections from Words, or Circumstances precedent, that
my meaning was as he does make it, though my words were not so as he relates
them.

5. That the Author of this Epistle might conceive such a Proposition, Charity
may attribute it to his Ignorance in matters handled in that Chapter, wherein
my former Proposition is contained. But why he should insert these words [In
the Creature] into the Proposition by me delivered, Christian charity it self,
which is not suspicious, which Believes all things, that may without
imputation of folly be believed, cannot attribute it to his Ignorance, but to
his Passion, or to his too much credulity unto others, who suggested the
former Proposition unto him, as worthy of a Parliamentarie Censure, or to his
zeal to have me censured as one of the Achans that trouble Israel But what he
can say for himself in excuse of this palpable Falsification of my words, I
leave to them who have just cause and full Authority, to examine him. That
there could be any Goodness in the Creature, before the Creature was, or had
actual being, no man did ever avouch. That any creature could possily have
Actual Being, or Goodness Actual, or existent in it, without some Precedent Act
of Gods Will, I had expressly denied in the Proposition immediately precedent to
the Proposition which the Author of the Epistle has falsified, by inserting
these words [In the Creature.] He might by the like Omission of the Proposition
precedent, (without any intersertion or falsification) have proved this
Proposition to be David's, [There is no God.] For this Proposition is expressly
set down by David, Psalm. 14. 1. Non est Deus. And this Proposition would well
please an Epicure or Atheist, if he took not the words precedent into
consideration with it. [Dixit insipiens in cord suo, non est Deus.] The Fool
has said in his heart, there is no God. And when I shall avouch the
Proposition wherewith he charge me, otherwise then with this addition [An
ignorant or unwise man has said it, or laid it to my charge.] Let me be
censured for a Fool; for a Blasphemer, or what you will.

6. The Proposition delivered by me is so clear, that no Artist, if he be a
Christian, can deny it. The Proposition consists of these Two Parts.

First, There is a Logical Possibility presupposed to the working of the
Almighty Power.

Secondly, There is an Objective Goodness precedent in order of nature to the
Act or exercise of Gods Will.

Against the first part, I do not hear of any exception made or taken: yet to
make it plainer unto those, who are not willing to except against it, I will
explicate the meaning of it in a particular Instance.

The First Man was made of the earth, by the working of the Almighty power:
and the earth whereof he was made was by the same power made of nothing. Both
were made by the working of the Almighty Power, within the compass of these
6000. years Current. But before Time had any Being, even from Eternity, there
was a Logical Possibility, That the Earth might be made of Nothing; and that
Man might be made of the Earth. He unto whom nothing is impossible, He unto
whom all things are possible, did know the making of both to be Logically
Possible (that is, to imply no Contradiction) before he made them; much better
then we know that they were made by him. For this we know, and must believe,
that the Almighty Power works nothing makes nothing without Foreknowledge,
not only of it, as Possible; but as Future.

Not the Creation of Man only, but the Creation of Man after Gods own Image was
Logically possible (that is, it did implie no Contradiction) from Eternity.
The Possible Creation of Man after this manner, was the Object of Gods Power,
before he said, Let us make Man after our own Image and similitude. This was
the Act or Exercise of Gods Power or Will. For the power whereby he is able to
do all things, never works without some Act or exercise of his Will. For as
the Apostle says, Ephesians. 1. 11. He works all things after the counsel of his
own will.

The Second part of the Proposition was [There is a Goodness Objective
precedent in order of nature to the Act or exercise of Gods Will.] For further
declaration of This Truth, I added This Proposition. Unto some things
considered as Logically possible, this Goodness Objective is so essentially
annexed, that if it be his Will to give them actual Being, they must of
necessity be Actually Good; nor can he that can do all things, will their
contraries. For example, The Creation of man after Gods own Image was Logically
possible from eternity, and was the Object of Gods Power, of his knowledge, and
Will, before man was thus created. Now unto this possibility of man's Creation
after Gods Image (which was objectively in Gods knowledge from eternity) there
was a Goodness also Objective, so essentially annexed, that whenever God
should be pleased to make man after this Pattern he was of necessity to be
actually Good.

7. Not to conceal any part of my meaning in this 13. Chapter. Unto the former
Proposition [The creation of man after Gods image was Logically Possible before
the Act or exercise of Gods Will, before the working of his Almighty power, by
whose concurrence man was upon the sixth day created.] I will add these
Propositions following.

1. To create Man after Gods own Image, and not to create him good, was never
Logically Possible; it could be no Object either of Gods Almighty Power or
Will. This Proposition had no Objective Truth in his Foreknowledge, whose
Knowledge is Infinite, whose Power is Omnipotent, whose Will is Irresistible.

2. The Act or exercise of Gods Omnipotent Will was the true Cause, the only
cause, why man was created after his Image. But, that man being created after
his Image, should be good, the Act or exercise of Gods Will or Omnipotent Power
were not the cause.

3. The connection between the Image of God, and that goodness which was in Man
created after his image, (albeit we consider this connection as possibly future
from Eternity) was essential and eternal, and was the Object of Gods eternal
Prescience or foreknowledge, which in order of nature is precedent to the Acts
or exercises of Gods Will.

4. Gods Will, or the Act or exercise of Gods Will, is the Cause why man was
made, why being made Good he was tied to the observance of Gods moral Law; not
the Cause why man's Observance of the Moral Law was or is in its nature good.

5. The end of the Moral Law, or of Precepts Evangelical, is to frame us to a
conformity with our heavenly Fathers Nature; to be holy as he is Holy. Gods
Will declared in the Moral Law, and vvorking in us both the Will and the Deed
to observe it, is the Cause by which we are made conformable to the Divine
Nature: but Gods Will declared in that Law enacted, is not the Cause why our
conformity to the Divine Nature is good; He rather wills us to be conformable
to his Nature, to his Will; That is, to be holy, as He is Holy, because such
conformity was essentially, and eternally good. All Goodness in the creature,
whether actually existent, or considered as possibly future, is unseparable
from this conformity, or consonancy to infinite and eternal goodness, which is
the infallible Rule of all created goodness, the eternal Rule, from which the
acts or exercises of Gods Will, either in making, in preserving, or governing
the creature, take their validity. Objective Being, or Logical Possibility of
Being, is opposed to Actual Being, or existence; Goodness Objective is opposed
to Goodness Subjective, that is, to goodness actually inherent, or existent in
any substance. In the Divine and Infinite Essence, nothing is or can be
Subjectively, all things are in him Objectively, and were so in him before they
had Actual Being. And if all things had an Objective Being in him before they
were, then the Goodness of every creature which is good, had an Objective being
in him, before it could have any Subjective being in the creature. The Beauty
of Salomons Temple, whilst it stood, was Subjectively in the materials rightly
proportioned and adorned, but Objectively in the Spectators or Surveyors eye.
The same Beauty was Objectively in the Architects Brain or Fancy, before it
could be either Subjectively in the material Temple or building, or Objectively
in the Spectators eye. In like manner, Justice, or goodness Original was
Subjectively in the first Man after his Creation, but was Objectively in God
before the First Man was created.

8* Yet if another man had written, That there was an Objective Goodness in
the Creature precedent to the Act or exercise of Gods Will, I should not have
had the malicious wit or invention to have charged him, as the forecited Author
has done me, with the overthrowing of any Divine Attribute, or with making the
Creature a God, or with Blasphemous Arminian Heresy. Charity would rather
have moved me to make this construction of his words. [If we consider these
Three; Man, the Image of God, Goodness, as all of them were Objectively in God
before they had any actual being; Gods Image might be said to be in the Man,
and Goodness in Gods Image, in such a sense* as every Attribute is said to be
in the subject of aproposition abstract from sense.] He that says, Socrates is
a reasonable creature, must acknowledge reason to be in Socrates. The connection
between the Subject, and the Attribute in Abstract Propositions, is Essential,
and Eternal. So necessary and so eternal was the Connection between Man made
after Gods Image (or so considered) and Goodness; that whenever it should
please God to give this Subject [Man after his Image] actual Being, the
Attribute likewise, to wit, [Goodness] was of necessity to have actual Being
or Coexistence with its Subject, without intervention or interposition of any
other cause. If, besides the Act or exercise of Gods Will* by which man was
created after his Image; any other Act or exercise of his Will, had been
necessary, or useful to make him actually Good: then Goodness or Justice
original should not have been Natural, but Supernatural to the First Man; which
no good Protestant may grant. The First Man's Goodness so long as it continued,
was continued by preservation of Gods Image in him, and cannot be renewed,
otherwise then by renovation of the same Image in him: so that the Goodness of
God is the Rule of Goodness; the Ideal Form or pattern of Goodness in the
Creature. The Act or exercise of the Divine Will makes no creature morally or
spiritually good, but by making it conformable unto his own Goodness. This and
no other was my meaning in that 13. Chapter, and this my meaning, as I thought,
was sufficiently expressed by me, and is so acknowledged by ingenious and
understanding Readers.

9. Nihil In bonis numerandum nisi quod per seipsum sit Laudabile, i. e. sponte
sua possit laudari. Tull. de Leg. L. 1. p. 163 quod a. laudabile sponte sua,
illud ante and sine praecepto bonum and Laudabile.
If any man be disposed to except, either, against any Particular Proposition
in this 13. Chapter, or against my General declaration, in what sense Gods
Will is said to be the Rule of Goodness; I shall request him positively to set
down the Proposition Contradictory to any Proposition of mine, which in that
Chapter he thinks to be Erroneous. And if he can Concludently draw any such
dangerous Consequence out of the Propositions avouched by me, as I shall do out
of his, I faithfully promise to retract what I have said. But until I see
better Proofs then this obiector brings any, I rest confident, that howsoever
some Divines of our Times, will be ready to Contradict this Proposition [All
things are not Good, only because God wills them; but God wills somethings
because they are Good.] Whiles this controversy is only betwixt him and me, in
this Particular; yet I shall be sure to find the same man to Contradict
himself, and to confess as much as I here avouch, whenever he shall have
occasion to dispute with the Jew, or to assign the difference between the
Ceremonial and the Moral Law, or the Reason why The One is to be perpetually
observed, The Other not so.

The shedding of innocent Blood was evil, before any Law was made against it,
before Gods Will was declared to the contrary.

Cain did suffer punishment for the Fact, before any positive Law, and before
any Act of Gods Will declared, to prohibit it. The shedding of innocent blood
then was not evil because it was forbidden, but it was afterward peremptorily
forbidden, because always Evil. Cains Enterprise against his innocent brother,
was Objectively Evil, before there was any man that could commit this or the
like enormitie. Charity, Peace, Brotherly Love, are Good, not only because
God has commanded them, or willed us to follow them; but God by his Law does
will and command us to follow after these things, because they were always
good, even before he willed or commanded us to follow them. The time will never
be wherein Innocence, Brotherly Love, Charity, Peace, and loving kindness,
shall be as displeasing to God as Murder, Hatred, Malice, Cruelty, and
Uncharitableness hitherto always have been. He cannot enact a Law either to
authorize these or the like practices, or to prohibit the contrary virtues.
But in as much, as R^ites, and Ceremonies, Sacrifices, Circumcision, etc. which
God sometimes did will and command men to observe, were only Good, because God
did will and command them: Hence it is that they are now abrogated, and their
use inverted without any change of Gods eternal Will, or of his Divine Nature.
The Negative Precepts concerning Rites and Ceremonies, have been turned into
Affirmatives, and the Affirmatives into Negatives; because the One contains
no other Goodness, nor the Other any Evil in them, which did not entirely
depend upon Gods Positive Will to command or forbid them. And seeing His Will
though most Immutable, is immutably Free, though not to do Good or Evil, yet
Free to make that which is not in its nature or essentially Good, to be Good
for One Time or Season, not for Another; and that which is not in its nature,
or essentially Evil, (but of an indifferent nature) to be sometimes Good and
sometimes Evil; therefore has he made the Omission of some Ceremonies to be as
Good, in latter times, as their observance was in former; and the Observance of
others to be as evil, as their former Neglect, or contempt were under the Law,
or from the Date of Gods first Covenant with Abraham, until the Ratification or
publication of the New Covenant made in Christ. The uncircumcised manchilde
(says God to Abraham, Genesis 17. 14.) whose flesh of his foreskin is not
circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people. But seeing the
observance of that which is here commanded, was only Good, because it was thus
peremptorily willed, commanded, or required by God, not Objectively Good from
eternity; the observance of the same thing commanded, is now as dangerous, and
displeasing to God, as the neglect or Non-Observance of it in Abraham's, in
Mosess, in the Prophets times had been. Hence is that wish of our Apostle, Gal.
5. 12. I would they were even out off that trouble you, that is, I would that
they which press Circumcision upon you, and upon your children, might be
sentenced according to Gods Law enacted against such as during the First
Covenant did omit or neglect it.

10 Partly from ignorance of this Distinction between the nature of things
commanded and forbidden by the Moral and Ceremonial Law, partly from ignorance
why obedience to the Law of Ceremonies was so strictly enjoined, and the
neglect of it so severely punished, often times by Gods immediate hand: the Jews
were drawn to place as great Sanctity in the observance of Rites and
Ceremonies, as in sincere obedience to the Moral Precepts. This was one main
root of their Hypocrisy, a sin from which it is scarce possible any hearer of
the Word should be free, unless he be taught to put some difference between
the Nature of things Good and Evil, of things commanded and forbidden, besides
the Will or authority of the Commander. If the Acts or Injunctions of Gods Will
were the only Rule of Goodness, and had not eternal Goodness rather for their
Rule, it would be hard to avoid the Stoical error, that all sins are equal;
besides a kind of Fatality in humane affairs, worse then Stoical.

The Turks acknowledge Gods Will to be a Rule of Goodness, as sovereign as the
author of the forementioned Epistle does; to be such a Cause of Causes as he
would have it. But being ignorant, or not considering that there is an
Immutable goodness precedent to the Act or exercise of Gods Will; a Goodness
whereof his Will, however considered, is no Cause; For it is Coeternal to his
Will, to his Wisdom and Essence: they fall into grossly absurd errors. And
consequently unto this their ignorance, or to the common error, that all things
are Good only because God wills them, they sometimes highly commend, and
sometimes deeply discommend the self same practices for quality and
circumstances with as great vehemence of zeal and spirit, and with as fair
Protestations of obedience in all things to Gods Will, as any other men do.

For Selimus to attempt the deposition of his Father, was in their Divinity a
good and godly Act. For Bajazet to take arms against his Brother, was an
abominable impiety. What was the reason? Injects sort Bajazetis mentione,
coepit Chiaussus in eum inclementius invehi, quod arma sumpsisset contra
fratrem. Ego contra dicebam videri mihi miseratione dignum, cui inevitabilis
necessitas imposita esset, aut capiendorum armorum, aut certae pestis
subeundae. Sed cum Chiaussus nihilominus exeerari pergeret. Vos, inquam,
immanis facinoris reum facitis Bajazetem. At Selimum, hujus Imperatoris patrem,
qui non modo contra patris voluntatem, veru^s etiam salutem arma tulit, nullius
criminis arguitis. Recte, inquit Chiaussus, nam rerum exitus satis docuit
illum, quod fecit divino fecisse instinctu, and coelitus fuisse praedestinatum.
Tum ego, si hoe more agetur, quicquid, quamvis pessimo Consilio susceptum, si
been cedat, recte factum interpretabimini, and Dei voluntati adscribetis, Deum
facietis authotem mali, nec quicquam been aut sequius factum, nisi ex eventu
pendetis. Sumus aliquandiu in hoe sermon commorati, cum uterque non sine
animorum and vocis contentione, quod proposuisset defenderet. Collecta utrinque
plura sacrae scripturae loca, Nunquid potest vas dicere figulo, Cur me ita
finx^sti? Indurabo cor Pharaonis. Jacob dilexi, Esa^ odio habui. atque alia ut
veniebant in mentem Auger. Busbequ. Epist. 4.
Selimus his attempt found good success; for he prevailed against his Father,
and this was an Argument that it was Gods Will, that he should so do. But
Bajazet miscarries in his attempt against his brother, and his disaster was a
proof sufficient that God was displeased with his attempt, it was not his
Will that he should prosper. And seeing his Will is the only Rule of Goodness,
seeing he did predestinate these two Princes, as he did Jacob and Esau, the
one to a good end, the other to an Evil; the self same Fact or Attempt was
good in the one, but wicked in the other. We all condemn it as an error in the
Turk, for measuring the difference betvveen good and evil, by the Event. But
even this error has an Original which is worse. They therefore measure all
good and evil by the Event, because they ascribe all Events (without
exception) to the Irresistible Will of God, Ex quo satis constitit, non Avi
misericordin eo usque Nepoti parcitum, sed ex opinione quae Turcis insedit, ut
res quocunque consilio institutas, si been cadunt, ad Deum auctorem refarant.
Proptorea quamdio incertum suit, quem exitum Bajazetis conatus sortirentur,
abstinendas ab insantis injuria manus Suleimannus statuit: nesi postmodumres
melius vertisser, obniti voluntati Dei voluisse videretur. Sed nunc illo
extincto, ac veluti divina sententia damnato, causam esse non putabat, cur
filio diutius parceretur, Ne malum ovum ex malo corvo relinqueretur. Ibidem.
and think that nothing can fall out otherwise then it does; because every
thing is irresistibly appointed by Gods Will, which in their Divinity is such
a necessary, Cause of Causes, and by Consequence of all Effects, as the Author
of the said Epistle would have it to be. Whosoever he be, whether Jew, Turk, or
Christian, which thinks that all Events are so irresistibly decreed by God,
that none can fall out otherwise then they do, must of necessity grant, either
that there is no moral evil under the Sun, or that Gods will (which is the
Cause of Causes) is the only Cause of such evil.

11 But is the like sin or error expressly to be found in Israel? Do any make
the same Fact for nature, quality and substance, to be no sin in one man, and
yet a sin in another? or to be a little sin in one man, and a grievous
outcrying sin in another? Though they do not avouch this of rebellious attempts
against Prince and State, or of other like public Facts, Cognoscible by humane
Law; yet the Principles of Praedestination, commonly held by them and the Turk,
draw them to the like Inconveniences, in transforming the immutable Rule of
Goodness into the similitude of their partial affections in other Cases.

The Adultery and murder, which David, committed, had been grievous sins in
any other man, but in David being predestined, they were but sins of
infirmity: sins, by which the outward man was defiled, not the inward man.
Such a sin was incest, in Lot; such are all the sins committed by the Elect.
And so were all the sins of the Elect remitted before they were committed. But
the Question is, Whether God did so absolutely decree the remission of any man's
sin from eternity, as that their remission was from eternity, absolutely
necessary. If God did absolutely decree that the sins of the Elect should be
remitted, Sin not remitted before committed.
then he did absolutely decree that they should be committed. For even in Gods
eternal Foreknowledge of all things that fall out in time, the Commission of
sins has precedencie of their Remission; and if their Remission were in
respect of his Foreknowledge or decree, absolutely necessary, their Commission
was as necessary. It is impossible there should be any Remission of sins,
without a presupposal of their Commission. Yet are the former Conclusions not
muttered in corners, but maintained as part of that holy doctrine which has
been delivered unto us by the masters of Israel, approved by the best writers
in reformed Churches.

These and the like Doctrines are held in so precious esteem, that if the
lawful Pastor seek to root them out where they have been planted by others, or
to prevent their growth or spreading, he shall be traduced for an Arminian; and
as they hope, be so censured by the high Court of Parliament. But my hope is,
that no Loyal Elder of Israel shall ever so far forget himself, as either to
attempt or seek to have those and the like Conclusions ratified by our great
Josuahs Royal consent. Sure I am these are no branches of that Ancient,
Catholic, Apostolic Faith, of which we acknowledge our Sovereign Lord to be
the defender: and God grant that he may ever defend and keep it pure and
undefiled from these and the like Conclusions, that it may defend him and his
people from their adversaries.

12 Yet to seek the Correction of these and the like Conclusions, though
malapertly maintained by some of the Flock against most of their Pastors, or
the punishment of those which so maintain them, until the Principles from which
they naturally issue be checked or inhibited, were but Tyranny. These here
related are the least, not the worst part of those noysom branches which spring
from this one root. [That Gods irresistible decree for the absolute Election of
some, and the absolute Reprobation of others, is immediately terminated to the
Individual Natures, Substances, or Entities of men, without any Logical respect
or reference to their qualifications.] This Principle being once granted, what
breach of Gods moral Law is there, whereon men will not boldly adventure,
either through desperation, or presumption, either openly, or secretly? For,
seeing Gods Will, which in their Divinity, is the only Cause, why the one sort
are destinated to death, the other to life, is most immutable, and most
Irresistible; and seeing the Individual Entities, or natures of men, unto which
this irresistible Decree is respectively terminated, are immutable: let the one
sort do what they can, pray for themselves, and beseech others to pray for
them, they shall be damned; because their Entities or Individual Substances are
unalterable. Let the other sort Live as they list, they shall be saved, because
no corruption of manners no change of morality breeds any mutability or change
in their Individual Natures or Entities; unto which Gods immutable Decree is
immediately terminated. Whatsoever become of good life and manners, so the
Individual Nature or Entity fail not, or be not annihilated, salvation is tied
unto it, by a necessity more indissoluble, then any chains of Adamant.

13. This Assertion [Whosoever is Elected from Eternity, was never the child of
wrath, save only in the esteem of men] I found delivered in certain papers at
my first entrance upon my Pastoral charge in the Town of Newsastle, written by
one that had been a great Rabbi in some private Conventicles in and about that
Town. And for the refuting of this Opinion, and the Principles out of which it
does most necessarily follow, it was presently conceived by some of my
Auditors, that I went about to refute the Doctrine of all Reformed Churches,
concerning Election and Reprobation. And Amongst the Doctrines of Reformed
Churches, which it was vehemently suspected, I went about to refute, this was
expressed for one [That the sins of the Elect or Regenerate, were remitted
before they were committed.] A doctrine which for my part I dare not charge any
one reformed Church with, though some in reformed Churches have stiffly
maintained the Principle out of which this Conclusion will necessarily follow:
and some few have in express Terms delivered the Conclusion; but so has not,
to my knowledge, any reformed Church, or entire Congregation, (besides the
Familist, to which, this error properly belongs.) The Council of Dort has
expressly delivered the contrary: so have others which write against the
Arminians. But in this Point a Reverend and Learned Pastor in the City of
London has saved me a Labor.

The false Principle from which both these Conclusions, [1. The sins of the
Elect are remitted before they are committed. 2. Whosoever is Elected, being
elected from eternity, never was, never could be, never can be the child of
wrath.] will most necessarily follow, is the forementioned Error; which ties
or terminates Gods Eternal and irresistible Decree for the absolute Election of
some, and the absolute Reprobation of others, to the Individual Natures,
persons or Entities of men elected or reprobated. But to omit (for the present)
the question concerning such absolute Election; not the most Tyrannical
Lawgiver, that to this day has breathed on earth, did ever declare himself to
be so far the son of the Devil, as to make solemn decrees against men's
persons, without respect, or reference to their Qualifications. It is the
property of the enemy of mankind to delight in man's punishment, as he is a man
or a reasonable creature: to desire to have any man as he himself now is, but
sometimes was not, a vessel capable only of vengeance or punitive justice,
altogether incapable of Gods free bounty, mercy, or favor. And seeing this
most Honorable Court of Parliament now happily assembled to make wholesome
Laws, does not intend to make any Punitive Laws or decrees, (specially
capitally punitive) against any men's Persons or Nature, but against men's ill
Qualifications and misdemeanors; I am confident that every member of it does
firmly believe, that our heavenly Father did never make any such Decree, or
Law. Again, seeing God has revealed his good Will and pleasure to be this, To
reward every man according to all his ways, I shall find no opposition or
Contradiction to this Conclusion (as I hope) among good Christians; [God did
from eternity decree to reward every man, not according to his Individual
Nature, but according to his ways, his works, or qualification, which he did
no less certainly foresee, then he did his Individual Nature,] He has decreed
from eternity to revvard the wicked and the ungodly, for their wicked works,
according to the inflexible Rule of his immutable Justice: and to revvard the
Penitent sinners (though sometimes children of wrath) not for their works,
yet according to their works or qualifications: and so to revvard them not by
the Rule of his Justice, but out of his mere Mercy; or out of that most Free
and Gracious ^ounty, which gave us all Life and Being, when we were not, and
therefore could not by any Works deserve the least of all his Blessings.

14. If to maintain these Conclusions be Arminianism, I profess my self not to
know (in these particulars) wherein the Arminians differ from the Orthodox,
and Ancient Church. But if Arminius and his followers have taught or
maintained any other Conclusions, by which the least tittle may be derogated
from Gods Free Mercy and Grace; by which any thing besides death, or
Non-deserts, may be ascribed to man's Works or Free Will, I no way partake
with them in those, and the like errors. I shall in good time, by Gods
assistance, make it appear that I truly acknovvledge both Gods Mercy and Grace
toward men; and men's sins, the best men's sins and unthankfulness toward
God, to be much greater, then he does or can acknovvledge either of them to be,
whosoever he be, that shall hold the Contradictory to any Conclusion in this
Chapter, for which I am accused of Arminianism, or to any Principal
Conclusion, maintained in my book of the Divine Essence and Attributes, or to
any Conclusion, which I have delivered, or shall deliver, concerning Election
or Reprobation.

15. The imputations laid upon me by the Author of the Epistle are heavy and
grievous, if they could be proved; however most injurious, being made so
public before I heard of them, or could prevent their spreading. Yet for my
own part, if it were in my power to censure him, my resolution should be like
to that of a Civilian: when the question was propounded to him, [An liceat
meretric^ quaestum facere.] His resolution as I remember, (for it was long
since I read it in Bodin) was to this effect, Pessime facit, quod artem
meretriciam exercet, sed meretrix cum sit, non malefacit quod ex art quam
exercet quaestum facit. The Author of the Epistle has much wronged himself and
me, in suffering himself to be so far misled with doctrine of Absolute
Election, and Reprobation, as it seems he is. But being thus far mislead by
it, and wedded unto it, his practice in slandering me without any relentance
which as yet I hear of, is but Consequent to his doctrine, if he were thoroughly
examined upon it. And he that should punish him for his slander, and not
condemn his doctrine, should do me small right, and should do him as much
wrong, as he that should punish a Scholar for holding a false Conclusion,
without questioning or disproving the Premises from which it necessarily
follows. For it is as impossible for him that thinks himself to be in the
Immutable estate of Grace, or Election, or is certainly persuaded of his
Salvation before his time, to suspect, much less to recant, any lewd practice,
or dangerous error, whereinto he may fall, until he renounce his Opinion, or
his Immature persuasion of his own Estate; as it is for any Scholar to revoke
a false Conclusion which still mantains the erroneous Premises, out of which
it necessarily follows.

16. The Point then to be proved is, [ That the justification of slander, how
virulent soever, and indulgence to corrupt affections once implanted, do as
necessarily follow upon Immature and preposterous persuasions of men's Immutable
estate in Grace, or Election, as any Conclusion does out of its natural
Premises.] Now the Truth of this Point may be made as clear as any Rule of Art
or Reason can make the truth of any other. For it a Rule of nature, tried and
approved by Art, a Fundamental Principle in both their Schools, that An
Universal Negative may be simply Converted, as thus: If no man can be a stone
or an Inanimate creature, then no stone or inanimate creature can be a man. The
Scripture which is the Rule of Faith, gives us these Universal Negatives; No
adulterer, no covetous Person, no Idolater, no murderer, no slanderer or
virulent rayler can inherit the kingdom of God. These Universal Negatives being
granted and believed; Nature and art, and common reason, must admit of their
Conversions. No man that must enter into the kingdom of heaven, no man that is
truly certain of his salvation, can be an Adulterer, can be a Covetous person,
can be a murderer, can be a slanderer, or virulent revi^er of his brethern.
Now if any man which believes himself to be in the immutable state of Election
(so certain of his salvation, that if he instantly dye, he shall instantly go
to heaven) shall happen to do the same things, that Adulterers do, that
Covetous men do, that murderers slanderers, or virulent revilers do, it will be
impossible for him to suspect himself of being an Adulterer, of being Covetous,
of being a slanderer or reviler, so long as his former persuasion concerning
his Absolute Estate of Salvation, etc. is not recalled. For if he must enter
into the kingdom of heaven whenever he dies; if this be a part of his Belief,
he cannot believe or suspect that he is a doer of those things, which whosoever
does, cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Thus, as the presumed Absolute
Infallibility of the visible Romish Church, for the time being, does lay a
necessity, upon their Successors, of freezing in the dregs of their
Predecessors errors: so this Immature Persuasion of men's particular Estate in
Election, Grace, or salvation, does lay a like necessity upon such, as are
overtaken with it, of having their hearts hardened with Hypocrisy, with
security, or secret indulgence to their corrupt affections. And for this reason
amongst others, did the sage and Reverend Reformers of the Church, wherein we
live, worthily admonish, that the Points of Election* and Predestination, are
to be warily thought upon, they are no fit Themes for every man's private
meditations, much less fit seeds to be promiscuously sown in every
Congregation by any Seeds-man.

17. Had any man in this Kingdom of how distempered behavior soever, so he had
been seasoned with the knowledge of ingenuous Arts or civil education, slandered
me in his Cups, or Passions, amongst private or common friends, so deeply and
upon so gross mistaking, as the Author of the Epistle has done, slandered me
unto the highest Authority on earth, his heart in his sober thoughts would have
smitten him long ere this, and I should have had some ingenuous satisfaction
voluntarily tendered from him. But from men mislead with wild zeal unto the
Doctrine of Absolute Election and Reprobation, as it has of late years been
taught by some, and from men jealous of others (as if they were Arminians) that
in this point dissent from them, I can expect no voluntary satisfaction, but
rather continuance of the like; unless I could dissuade them from their
Doctrinal Error. For whilst this vail is spread over their hearts, envious or
malicious slander, whilst it exonerates it self upon such, as they suspect for
Achans and Arminians, will be interpreted zeal; violent passions will be taken
for the Power of the Spirit, such nastie Soloecismes or rude scurrilitie, as
would seem loathsome to heathen Artists, will go current with themselves and
their associates for sanctified eloquence; and so will ignorance in Philosophy
or School-Divinitie be applauded for holy Simplicity.

But seeing their tongues and pens are their own, seeing they have cast off the
yoke of obedience, and begin to proclaim, not mutter [with our tongues we will
prevail, we are they that ought to speak, and print books, Who is Lord over
us?] Let them use what language they please, the Print-houses in this interim
possessed, and employed by them, shall but exercise my patience, as some (I
hope) by usurpation, not by just Warrant, pulpits, here and there, ever and
anon, for these three and twenty years have done; during which time, whilst
such Schediasticks as these have preached of absolute Election or Reprobation,
I still have prayed, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they said.
And so I suppose, many more of my profession in this Kingdom have done. God in
the mean while has enlightened the hearts of many, by our prayers and ministry
to see their error, and has made me a witness of many men's sorrow for being
misled. And whenever the vail shall be taken from the heart of such now
living in this land, as still maintain that Rigid Doctrine, their sorrow and
compunction will be no less, then the sorrow and compunction of those Jews
which had (through ignorance) consented to the crucifying of the Lord of Glory.

18 The practice of the Jews was in the issue more desperate, then men in this
age, no less zealous of that which they apprehend for truth, can have
opportunity to attempt. But the error which led the Jews to that desperate
practice against the Son of God is no way impaired, but rather enlarged by some
Christians of these times. Our only comfort is, that however the common error
of both times be rather strengthened then any way enfeebled by such in our
times as nurse it, yet is it neither so general, nor so inveterate in this
land, as it was in the Jewish nation before their final destruction. The
Governors of our Church and State, the learned Pastors, or conformable Layity,
are not so infected with it, as the Pharisees, Scribes, and Elders in Judea
were in our Saviors time. Their excessive pride and Hypocrisy made them so
extraordinarily impatient of reproof and contradiction, and their extraordinary
impatience of reproof in matters of practice, and of contradiction in point of
opinion, hatched that cruel and murtherous hate against the Son of God. The
settled matter of their deadly malice was pride, and hypocrisy of heart; that
wherewith this corrupt matter was continually fed, was passionate zeal to
maintain the Absolute Election of their Nation, and the Absolute Rejection of
the Gentiles; humorous persuasion of their own immutable estate in Gods
promise, first occasioned or strengthened by reflecting upon the accurate
reformation, which (to their seeming) they had made of their forefathers
Idolatry, of Sabbath-breaking, and other palpable transgressions of Gods Law.
But however, cruelty and fury have no such Objects to practice upon in these
latter days as the Jews, and as the Scribes and Pharisees had: yet is not
bodily death a more Usual effect of pestilent fevers, then slander,
persecution, cruelty, and murderous hate are in all Ages, of ignorant zeal,
and hypocrisy. Nor do putrified or malignant humors, more usually breed
pestilent fevers, or other dangerous diseases, in men's bodies; then immature
persuasions of their own Immutable estate in Grace, or indigested resolution
concerning absolute Election or Reprobation, do hatch pride and hypocrifie in
men's souls. And the most infallible Symptom of pride, and hypocrisy, is
Jealously of being contradicted by such as contradict them not, or impatiency
of mere Logical Contradiction, without gallor bitterness, in point of Opinion.
Another Accidental Improvement of the Jews murtherous hate against our Savior,
was the hotness and blindness of their zeal to Moses's writings. Yet were not
Moses's writings in higher esteem with them, then St. Paul's Epistles are
deservedly with us. And would to God, some amongst us did not further mistake
or pervert his scope and aim in that 9. Chapter to the Romans, then the Jews
did Moses's meaning.

But the Parallel between the Jewish misperswasions of love and zeal to God
and his servant Moses, and the misperswasions of many Modern Christians
presumed love to our Savior and his Apostles, is elsewhere See his Ti^eatise
of Justifying Faith, Sect. 2. Chapter 14. page in quarto, 245.
handled in the general, and shall by Gods assistance be further prosecuted in
some particulars. My purpose for the present is, to show how nearly it
concerns my self, and all that seek to prevent the Resubmission of this people
unto the Roman yoke, to beware of peremptory resolutions concerning Absolute
Reprobation.

19. It was well observed by Oecolampadius, that the ordinary Pictures of God,
or of his enemy, Puerorum major pars nescit quid sit Deus, quid Satan, quid
bonum, quid malum, idque firmiter credo. Neque talis Deus, vel Satan,
quemadmodum Pictores in tabellas, aut parietes pingunt. Si nosti quomodo Deus
misericors sit, benignus, mitis, mansuetus, Longanimis, patiens, justus, etc.
vere Deum agnoscis, per illas enim res proprie, quid sit Deus discimus. E
contrario Satan nihil aliud est, quam immiser^cordia, odium, invidia,
homicidium, mendacium, irrisio proximi, and omne malum* Oecolamp. concione ad
adolescent. page 349.
were no good Books for instructing Laymen or Children in the nature of God or
of Satan. The truest representation that can be made of God, would be to teach
them, what truth is, what mercy, what Love, or Goodness is. The best Picture
that can be taken of Satan, would be the true Characters of Falsehood, malice,
hatred, cruelty, envy. Yet by this Good Authors leave, however Satan be the
Father of lies, the Author of malice, the hatcher of envy and hatred, the
Com-plotter of cruelty; yet can he not so truly and properly be called falsehood
it self, envy it self, hatred it self, cruelty it self, in the abstract, as God
is said to be Truth it self, Love it self, Mercy it self, and Goodness it self.
For though falsehood, hatred, envy, cruelty, etc. be now become Natural to the
old Serpent; yet were they adventitious to his prime nature and substance; he
was not from the beginning invested with these or the like habits. But if the
Opinion of some men amongst us concerning absolute Reprobation were from above,
He, whom we profess to be the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth, should
be as truly and properly falsehood it self, hatred it self, cruelty it self; as
he is Truth it self. Love it self, Mercy it self, Goodness it self. The
Branches of the Doctrine concerning Absolute Reprobation, which bear this Fruit
are (to omit others for the present) specially these Two. The First, That the
manifestation of Gods punitive Justice, was a part of the Object of Gods
Primary Will, and an exercise of his Will, as directly, as immediately, and as
irresistibly intended by him in the Creation; as the manifestation of his
Goodness and Bounty, or reservation of his mercy to such as shall be saved,
was. The Second, That God from Eternity did as truly hate all those who perish,
without respect or reference to their works or qualifications, as he did love
those who shall be saved.

Now if the number of such as perish, be much greater, then the number of such
as shall be saved; and if the same God did from eternity as truly hate the
greater sort of men, as he did love the less, without all respect or reference
to their works or qualifications; if he did out of his eternal hatred, as
peremptorily decree the endless torments of the One, as he did the everlasting
happiness of the Other: These Conclusions of the Lutherans (avouched by them,
in some Catechismes (which I have seen) before the name of Arminius was heard
of in these Parts) will necessarily follow, viz. That such as maintain this
rigid doctrine of Absolute Reprobation, do not believe in, or acknowledge, the
same God, which the Lutherans, with all antiquity, acknowledge: for they
acknowledge their God to be Truth, Mercy, Love, and Goodness; whereas the
stiff maintainers of Absolute Reprobation confess their God, to be hatred,
and Cruelty it self. Now to acknowledge one and the same God to be Truth,
Love, Mercy, and Goodness itself in respect of some; and in respect of others,
to be falsehood, hatred, cruelty it self, is a grossser Heresy or
Transformation of the Deity, then was the Heresy of the Manichees, which
acknowledge Two Gods, or independent Originals of all things; the One as
Fountain of all Goodness, the Other, the Author of all Evil. For avoiding
these and the like Conclusions, no evasion or observation has been or can be
pretended, by such as make the Entity or Individual Natures of man the Formal
Objects of Reprobation, besides this One, viz. That Gods Will is so the Rule of
Goodness, that if he will the death of all that dye without respect unto their
works or Qualifications, this must be Good. If he be pleased to hate the
greater Part of mankind without all reference to their Qualifications, the
hatred of them must be as good, as his Love of those few which shall be saved.
And the Apostle did advise them to rest upon this answer, when he says, O man!
who art thou that disputest against God; shall the thing formed say to him that
formed it, why have thou made me thus? has not the Potter power over the clay,
etc. But whether this Use of our Apostles Doctrine in that place, be according
to his meaning, or whether any Conclusion can be drawn from that Chapter which
may make for absolute Election or Reprobation, is elsewhere examined. By that
which has been said, See Chapt. 42. Numb. 9. 10.
it may appear, that such in this Land as stiffly hold the Tenet of absolute
Reprobation (which the Christian world besides has for the most part forsaken)
have some reason, though no just cause to question the truth delivered by me,
in what sense Gods Will is said to be the Rule of Goodness. For unless they
can disprove my Tenet, (which God be praised has stronger Supporters then my
weakness can afford) they must either revoke their error, or admit God to be
more then the Author of sin, as truly (...); as properly sin it self, as Being
it self, or life it self. And yet if they could persuade the ignorant, that
Gods Will is the Rule of Goodness in such a sense as they would make it; the
Inconveniences which the Lutherans object, would be rather for a while removed,
then clearly avoided; They might be pressed upon them again, with greater force
and advantage, with this addition that they maintain the Turkish Opinion
concerning Fate and Providence. And upon this Ground only (as I conceive) do
the the Lutherans instile the Calvinists, Limbs of Gog, or of the Eastern
Antichrist. But the best is, that of such who at this day do not disclaim the
name of Calvinists, the most and best learned dislike the opinion of Absolute
Reprobation, and so I hope in good time will every faithful Pastor in the
Church of England, and every Loyal Elder in this our Israel. For admit we could
make full proof unto the Congregations committed to our Charge, that Papistry
is, as some have enstiled it, the Ocean of Heresies; that the Absolute
Infallibility of the Pope or Consistory exceeds the mixture or combination of
all other particular Heresies which have been; that the Idolatry which the
Roman Catholics from the belief of the Pope or Churches absolute
Infallibility are enforced to commit and practice, does equalize the Idolatry
of those heathens which solemnly worshipped the Devil; yet all this being proved
by us, and firmly believed by our flocks, would be of small force or sway, to
retain understanding men in their Allegiance to their Sovereign Lord, or in
obedience to the Laws Ecclesiastic or Civil of this Kingdom, if once the
Doctrine of Absolute Reprobation might be fastened upon the Church of England,
or be embraced by her Learned Pastors or Governors. For so they might as
concludently prove us to be as gross Heretics as we say they are; and evince
our Churches doctrine to be as Blasphemous, as theirs is Idolatrous.

To have this Rigid Doctrine generally embraced or acknowledged by us, or at
least to have the World believe that it were generally acknowledged by us, is
the very Thing, and the main business which the Factors for the Romish Church
for these many years have earnestly solicited. This is the very net wherein
Satan hopes to catch this Island: he has set the Jesuits to spread and hold
it, and when opportunity serves to draw it. And the Jesuits as they have long
used our Pulpits and Print-houses, so they attempt to use some in our
Parliaments as their Podders, to drive us into it. Their prey they know must
needs be great, if they can bring us into these straights, or put a necessity
of this hard choice upon us. Whether were better, to live in obedience to a
Church, which adores wicked and naughty men, Devils incarnate, (for such some
of their Popes have been) as Gods on Earth; or to hold communion with that
Church or society of men, which makes the God of heaven, the Almighty Creator
of all things Visible and invisible, much worse then an Incarnate Devil, yea
then any wicked Spirit, or then the Devil himself, can without slander, be
conceived to be.

A Paraphrase upon the Eleven first Chapters of Exodus; with useful
Annotations, Observations, and Parallels.
ALbeit the Ancient Heathens (however they came by them) had many excellent
Notions, and some Exquisite Discourses upon those Notions, of A Divine
Providence, which even to their apprehension did usually overreach and
control all Politic Projects of greatest Princes: Yet, such Exquisite Maps,
or Live-Patterns of the Only Wise Gods Proceedings in Counter-plotting the
subtlest contrivances, of mightiest Princes, or of the profoundest Professors
of mysteries of State, or other subordinate Projectors; as the History of
Joseph (wherewith Moses concludes the Book of Genesis) or the History of
Pharaoh (wherewith the same Moses begins the Book of Exodus) the best of the
Heathens had none. Nor may this present Age expect any equal; though every Age
(in one Kingdom or other) afford some matter of History like unto them, Quoad
veritatem, licet non quoad mensuram. With the History of Joseph I am not at
this time to meddle, any further, then as it may lead me or instruct me to take
a more exact survey of Gods Process with Pharaoh, or of The manner how, or of
The means by which He hardened him.

2 So long as that great, and (in his kind) Religious Pharaoh lived, (whose
life, and prosperous estate of the kingdom whereof he was Lord, Joseph by Gods
good Providence, and peculiar instructions, had both preserved and advanced;)
nothing went amiss with the Stemmes of Jacob: All of them from the highest to
the lowest fared well for Joseph's sake: and (which was more then all the matter
of their welfare) the Egyptians, amongst whom they sojourned, did not envy
or repine at their prosperity; at least they durst not profess any enmity or
attempt to wreak their malice (if they had conceived any) against them. The
fresh memory of Joseph's good deservings at the Kings, Princes, and Peoples
hands, did prevent all practices of Hostility or repining cruelty (though but
intended against them) so long as that Pharaoh, which had so well rewarded
Joseph, and had him in so great esteem, did sway the Scepter of Egypt. But it
seems that this gracious King dyed about the same time that Joseph did, or
rather before him. For Moses instructs us, Exodus 1. 8. There arose a new King
which knew not Joseph (that is, either had no Memorial Record, or took no
notice how well he had deserved both of the King and Kingdom of Egypt.) And he
said unto his people, Behold, The people of the children of Israel are greater
and mightier then we, etc. Josephus in his second book of Judaical Antiquities
informs us, (and his information will much advance the true value of the
Literal Sense of the Sacred Context according to the Original) that this latter
Pharaoh, or new King, mentioned by Moses, Chap. 1. verse. 3. was of another
Line; no Son or Heir, unless by Adoption of that great Pharaoh, and Grand
Patron of Joseph, but at the best, of some Collateral Line. Now whether it were
out of Real Fear, or out of Pride of heart, or Popularitie: This new King to
give some Document in the beginning of his Reign, of more care and wisdom for
maintaining and advancing the welfare of the Natives, then his Predecessor had
practiced, (who had placed his special favors upon forraigners and strangers)
thus resolves with himself, and proposes his resolution to his Counsel of
State or War. Come, let us work wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it
come to pass that if there be war they join themselves also unto our Enemies,
and fight against us, and get them out of the Land, verse 10.

The First Project of this new King was to keep the Israelites from Mutiny
(whereunto their number might, as he thought, provoke or tempt them) by laying
the yoke of servitude and hard labor upon them. But perceiving that the more
he did press them, the more they multiplied and grew stronger; his second
project became more cruel: for it was to destroy, or put the Males of Israel
out of this world as fast and as soon as they came into it.

Neither of these Two Projects were any part of Gods Ordination or Design: Both
were suggested to this proud King^ by Gods enemy, who is the father of all
Bloody Politicians, and chief master of all unhallowed Policies. However, the
entertainment of this Satanical Suggestion, and the putting of it in execution
by Royal Authority and Command, was an Inchoation or rather a large measure of
that Ordination or Coaptation of this Kingdom and State to that destruction
whereof our Apostle speaks, Romans 9. 22. What if God, willing to show his wrath,
and to make his power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to destruction?

3 But that new King which devised all the forementioned evils against the
children of Israel, The infant killer and Hardened, two several Pharaohs.
was not the Subject of that Obduration mentioned by our Apostle, and recorded
by Moses, from Exodus 7. unto the 11. For that bloody King, which caused all
the Males of Israel to be cast into the river, dyed before God appeared to
Moses in the ^^sh* as is evident from Exodus 2. 23. And it came to pass in
process of time, that the King of Egypt dyed, and the children of Israel sighed
by reason of the bondage, etc. and is expressly avouched by Josephus in his
second Book of Jewish Antiquities, Chap. 5. However, this other Pharaoh
becoming Successor to that cruel King mentioned Exodus 1. 8. not in Place only,
but in Cruelty and oppression: the wickedness and wrongs practiced by the
former Pharaoh and his subjects, are charged upon the Second and his people;
because they were bound by the Law of God, and by the Law of Nature to have
given better Satisfaction to the Israelites then they did; so much at least as
Moses in his First message to Pharaoh, Exodus 4. did demand. And this Pharaohs
heart to whom he was sent, was more capable of, or rather more fitly disposed
to that Obduration which befell him; because he could not be ignorant of the ill
success which his Predecessors cruel intentions against the Infant-Males, had
found. It was the former Pharaohs main Project to destroy the Hebrew-Males: And
in the heat of this persecution, Moses is born, but hid for three months from
Pharaohs Firrets, (or bloodhounds rather) by his Parents. This providence in
his parents was not from secret Instinct of Nature, but from True Faith, or
supernatural Revelation, as our Apostle instructs us, Heb. 11. 23. By Faith
Moses when he was born, was hid three months of his parents; because they saw
that he was a proper child, and they not afraid of the Kings commandment.

4. Josephus tells us that the Occasion which Pharaoh took to murder all the
Hebrew Males, was from a constant Fame or Praenotion suggested unto him by a
Secretary of state; That about this time there should an Hebrew Male be born
that should work wonders for the good of his People: and their good could not
be dislinked from the Egyptians harms or losses; although no better fortune
were to befall them, then their safe escape out of the Land without any just
revenge upon their Oppressors. Some Praenotion or Revelation of that (which
Josephus says) had been made to Moses his Parents, and Believed by them; and
made them the more careful, First, to hide him, then to commend him to Gods
Providence in an Ark of Bulrushes, floting down the river, to which it is
Probable they knew Pharaohs Daughter did usually resort. Their wisdom in the
contrivance was more then Natural; a true work or suggestion of Faith: the
disposition of all Occurrences to effect their hope beyond their expectation,
was an Extraordinary Act of Gods peculiar Providence. After the Adoption of
Moses to be the son of Pharaoh Daughter, we read not of the continuation of the
former Butchery: Nor is it Probable it should continue after Moses came to
years of Proof, enabled to give pregnant Documents of his worth as well in
Martial as in Civil affairs. Whether he were intended and designed (as
Josephus tells us he was) to be Heir unto the kingdom of of Egypt, Antiqu. Lib.
2. Chap. 5.
(this Cruel king having no child besides his Merciful Daughter; nor she any
child of her Body;) we dare not Peremptorily avouch or gainsay. Or whether
Moses did that Pharaoh (whose Daughter had saved his life) that Admirable
Service in subduing the Ethiopians, as Josephus in the same Place relates, be
believed or waived; Probable it is that either by This or some Other great
Service done by him in Egypt or for the Egyptians; it was foreshewed, so as his
Brethren might have understood, That God had some great work in hand to be
wrought by Him, besides the mere killing of the Egyptian that had wronged one
of the Hebrews.

But whatsoever good Intentions this Pharaoh had toward Moses for his
Daughters sake, before he killed the Egyptian; it is evident that he hated him
extremely afterward for this very Fact; and that Moses for fear of his
displeasure left Egypt, and sojourned many years in Midian, Exodus 2. 15. Now it
came to pass in process of time, (says the sacred Story, ver. 23.) that the
king of Egypt (that King whose Daughter had saved Moses's life; yea the same
who sought to slay Moses for killing the Egyptian) dyed: But the great and
grievous oppression of the poor Israelies did not die with him; mutarunt
Dominum, non servitutem; they were freed from this one cruel Oppressor, but not
from cruel Oppression: For there arose another Tyrant as bad or worse then this
under whose heavy yoke, The Children of Israel sighed by reason of the
bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God, by by reason of the
bondage. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his Covenant with
Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the Children of
Israel, and God had respect unto them, Exodus 2. 23, 24, 25. Unto This Later of
the Two bad Pharaos, who had no spleen against Moses in particular, as being
perhaps unknown unto him by face, is Moses commanded to address himself as a
special Messenger from the Lord God of their Fathers; who appeared unto him
after a strange manner in Mount Sinai, as is expressed at large, Exodus 3. Moses
after much Reluctance undertakes this Service, volens nolens: And just Cause he
had to fear, (as the event did show) First, that his own Brethren the^ Seed of
Jacob, would hardly believe his Report, or yield Obedience unto his Commission:
Secondly, that after his Brethren were persuaded that God had sent him unto
them, it was (as he foresaw) very indible, that Pharaoh would give any
Credence, either to him, or to the Elders of Israel, whether jointly or
severally employed in this Great Bussnesse.

5. That full measure of Induration or hardness of heart which afterward fell
upon this second Pharaoh, was no otherwise wrought by God, then by reiterated,
gentle, and civil Checks of that unhallowed Resolution begun by his
Predecessor and continued by him. In the most of Moses's Messages unto him,
God (whose Ambassador Moses was) did advise or command him to do as in justice
and equity he ought to have done; but no way necessitate him to do as he did.
The Tenor of Moses's Advertisements unto him was; First, to relinquish all
former Resolutions or intendments of Oppression unto the Israelites. And
Secondly, to make some equitable satisfaction for the wrongs formerly done unto
them. All this Pharaoh might have done: and all this any wise man, which had
feared God and hated covetousness, would have done. But for this Pharaoh, as he
was (no doubt) wise enough for worldly business, so he was exceeding proud,
exceeding covetous; and by these qualities, To-God-ward, most unwise. So that
his Pride and Covetousness did directly and immediately harden his heart. On
Gods Part we may not Imagine or suspect any other Causalitie of hardening him,
besides the Proposal of those Conditions unto him, whose Performance he knew
was very Incompatible, though not Incompossible with haughty Pride or tenacious
avarice. The only Necessity which God in his alseeing Wisdom put upon him,
was, either to break his Resolution and work a Relentance or release of those
cruel Practices and oppressions toward the Isra^lites which Pride or avarice
had put him upon; or else, to be hardened by his wilful Continuation of his
First Resolution at that high Bent, at which it stood when Moses was first sent
unto him.

6. To descend to a more Particular Survey of the Pride and avarice of these
two Pharaohs. We are to take our Hint or Rise from that Passage set down by
Moses, Exodus 1. 10. Come on^ let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply,
and it come to pass, that when there falls out any war, they join also unto
our Enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the Land: This was
the utmost of the former Pharaohs fear in the beginning of his Project against
them. But what Cause had he to fear their departure out of the land, seeing
they could not carry with them the lands and Posessions which his Predecessor,
Joseph's good Lord and Patron, had bestowed upon them? Surely this haughty
Prince did politickly foresee, that the recovery of these possessions to the
Egyptians, or Confiscation of their Personal Estates, could not be so
beneficial unto him as the Possession of their Lives and bodily Service: for
even these, according to the Custom of those times, were accounted In bonis
ipsius, as his proper goods and Chattels. Now to be Lord of so many Slaves (for
under this Title he challenged them) was a grater Revenew, then any Prince
besides himself in those times had; and a great deal more, then all the Land of
Goshen which the Israelites then possessed was worth. And this Revenew he saw
would grow greater every day, albeit his Predecessors cruel Project against the
Male-children had succeeded according to his intention: for the Female Sex
would still have multiplied; and these he thought to be a secure Possession, as
being not likely to make insurrection against him, or to become confederates in
war with his Enemies. Nor is it probable that either of the two Pharaohs ever
intended the extirpation of the males any further, then that they might have
enough to propagate such a perpetual generation or succession of Slaves, so
competent in number, as the Egyptians might easily master them.

7. This Attempt had been less dangerous, and the cruel Practice less wicked
against any other People under heaven, then against the Seed of Abraham and of
Isaac, because these were the Lords own inheritance; His Peculiar Charge. This
People when they were first invited into Egypt was scarce an Oligarchie; a
small Congregation of men endued with no other power or Jurisdiction, but only
such as every Father of a Family has over his Children and Grandchildren and
theirs. And this Jurisdiction after Jacobs death was divided amongst his sons:
Every one of them was a Patriarch, that is, a Chief over his own Tribe or Clan.
Nor had these twelve Patriarchs any Civil or Coercive Power one over another,
or respectively over their several Families, after they settled in Egypt, but as
the King and State of Egypt would permit or allow of. Not any power at all to
make any War whether offensive or defensive; or Leagues of Peace with any
other Nation. Freemen notwithstanding they were de jure; and this new King of
Egypt which knew not Joseph, (much less considered upon what Title of
deservings Jacob and his sons were permitted to enjoy a Competent measure of
the Land of Egypt) did most unjustly attempt to put the yoke of slavery upon
their necks. Yet how to right themselves they knew not; as having no Superior
Lord on earth unto whom they might appeal from Pharaoh. But the more destitute
they were of any help from earth, the more easy and speedy entrance their
Prayers found into heaven: their tears and cries were accepted of the Lord God
of their Fathers for more then Legal Appeals.

8. But from the time of His appearance to Moses in the Bush (which was after
the first hard-hearted Pharaohs death) the Lord himself vouchsafed to to become
their King; not in general only (as he is Lord of all Lords, and King of all
Kings, and People throughout the World) but in a Proper and peculiar manner.
Whatsoever Authority or Power of Jurisdiction the Kings or Supreme Majesty's
of other Nations or Soveraignties did exercise, or by Divine permission and
Ordinance of Providence do now exercise over their People, (as Power of Life
and death, or of making Laws, or Leagues, whether of Peace or War with other
States;) all these and the like Prerogatives the Lord of heaven and earth did
reserve immediately unto himself alone, over the Seed of Jacob and of Abraham
his Friend. Upon the Lords Reservation of this Royal Power entire unto himself,
Moses is delegated to be his Ambassador unto the King and State of Egypt, and
constituted his Deputy or Viceroy over Israel Nor shall the Reader whether
Christian or other be ever able to understand the Literal or Punctual meaning
of the History of Exodus to the 14. chapter, or of those places in St Paul's
Epistle to the Romans which refer unto that History, unless he take This
Rule or Principle along with him whilst he reads them, viz. [That all the
Messages which Moses delivered to Pharaoh from God, and all the Answers which
Pharaoh returned by him were true and formal Treaties of a Legal and Solemn
Embassage.] The Law of Nature and of Nations was never so accurately observed
by any Ambassador as it was by Moses (whilst he exercised this Function) in his
many Treaties with Pharaoh. One Principal, if not the only Fact, that can come
within the Suspicion of Injustice on Moses's part, was the spoiling the
Egyptians of their Jewels. But if we consider what unsufferable wrongs the King
and people of Egypt had done unto this People of God, which had now become His
Peculiar Subjects or his Proprietarie Lieges; This Fact even by Course of
Humane Law, or Law of Nations, was more justifyable, then Royal Grants of
Letters of Mart, or other like remedies against such other Nations as have
wronged their Subjects, or suffered them to be wronged by any under their
command without restitution when they solemnly, or by way of Embassage demanded
it, are. Whatsoever the Hebrew women had borrowed of, or taken from the women
of Egypt, they took and did possess it Reprisaliorum jure, by the Law of
Reprisal, that is, by way of special Warrant granted by God himself as he was
now become not only this peoples God, but their King in Special.

This warrant for spoiling the Egyptians not by any strong or violent hand, but
with their own Consent we have Registered, Exodus 3. 21. etc. And I will give
this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass that
when ye go, ye shall not go empty: But every woman shall borrow of her
neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your
daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

9 In all this time, or in all the instructions given by God to Moses, Exodus 3.
there is no mention of Gods purpose or menacing to harden Pharaoh, but only a
Divine Prediction that Pharaoh would not let the children of Israel go; and yet
be at length as willing to let this people of God depart, as Pharaohs people
should be to bestow their Jewels, and other rich Presents upon them.

The Miracles which Moses was for the present and afterward authorized and
enabled to work, Moses's miracls Letters of Credence.
both in the sight of his own people, and in the presence of Pharaoh were, as
Authentic Letters of Credence, legible enough to the Egyptians, that the Lord
of Hosts had designed him unto this Embassage, and given him power to command
all the hosts of reasonless creatures, to fight for Israel against the
Egyptians. All the several Armies of inferior Creatures, which brought the
many ensuing plagues upon the Egyptians, were but as so many fingers of that
mighty hand* by whose strength God had lately foretold Moses, that Pharaoh
would in the ^ssue be content to let the Israelites depart upon fair terms, out
of his Land.

10 The former Pharaoh and his Predecessor (according to the apprehension of
their proud imaginations) had played the Foregame so cunningly against the seed
of Jacob, that this present or later Pharaoh at least thought himself sure of
winning the Set* or of drawing the whole Stake about which the controversy
was: and that was the present liberty, or perpetual thraldom of Israel. Now
God instructs his Ambassador Moses to play the After-game with such skill and
circumspection, that unless Pharaoh would give over in good time, he should be
sure to lose his own life, and the life of his Princes or chief Commanders in
War, besides the loss of every Firstborn Male in Egypt, whether of man or
beast; besides the loss of the greatest part of that years revenew of the whole
land of Egypt. Pharaoh in all this process demeans himself, first, like a bold,
then, like a wilful Chafeing Gamester, who after once he have begun to Vie
upon, or provoke his adversary, resolves to Revie upon him, and to provoke him
further when the game is desperate: as will further appear in his Answer to
every several Message delivered unto him from God by Moses and Aaron.

11 The Sum or Abstract of the fourth Chapter contains Moses his debate with
God, or humble entreatie to be spared from this great Service, in respect of
his slowness of speech, and insufficiency (as he took it) to be his
Ambassador. And in this mind he continued until God Himself did over aw him by
His Authority, and yet withal gently persuade him by Reason. Then the Lord
was very angry with Moses, and said, Do not I know Aaron thy brother the Levite
that he himself shall speak? for lo he comes also forth to meet thee, and when
he sees thee he will be glad in his heart. Therefore thou shall speak unto him
and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his
mouth, and will teach you what you ought to do. And he shall be thy spokes-man
unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be as thy mouth, and thou shall
be to him as God, Chap. 4. 14, 15, 16. The Reason which specially moved Moses
to undertake this Service, is expressed, ver. 19. For the Lord had said unto
Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt: for they are all dead which went about to
kill thee: Then Moses took his Wife, and his Sons, and turned toward the Land
or Egypt, etc. The instruction For his Embassage undertaken upon these Motives,
follows, ver. 21, 22, 23. And the Lord said unto Moses, when thou art entered
and come into Egypt again see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh,
which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, and he shall not
let the people go. Then thou shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says the Lord, Israel
is my Son, even my Firstborn. Wherefore I say to thee, let my son go, that he
may serve me: If thou refuse to let him go, Behold, I will slay thy Son, even
thy Firstborn. This Passage contains the first mention either of Gods purpose
or Prediction to harden the heart of Pharaoh.

12. Exodus 4. 27.
Upon Moses and Aarons meeting in the Mount of God, not by humane compact or
contrivance, but by Gods special appointment; and upon the sight of the
miracles which God enabled Moses first to work in private; the people of Israel
believed that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and had looked down
upon their tribulation: And upon this Belief, they bowed down and worshipped,
Exodus 4. 31. Now upon this Consent and obedience unto their Proposal, Moses and
Aaron went and said to Pharaoh (like Ambassadors of State) Let my people go,
that they may celebrate a feast unto me in the wilderness. And Pharaoh said,
who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice and let Israel go? I know not the
Lord, neither will I let Israel go, etc. Chap. 5. 12. Unless the former Bent of
Pharaohs Pride and avarice had taken occasion to enlarge and stiffen it self
from this fair Message delivered unto him; he would not have returned that
haughty supercilious Answer unto Moses Gods Ambassador and Aaron his
Interpreter; [Moses and Aaron, why cause ye the people to cease from their
works? get you to your burdens, Chap. 5. ver. 4.] Nor was his Choler or
Superciliousness only against Moses and Aaron, but against the whole People of
Israel; on whose behalf God had made them his Ambassadors: For, Pharaoh said
furthermore, behold, much people is now in the Land, and ye make them leave
their burdens. Therefore Pharaoh gave commandment the same day unto the
Taskmasters of the people, and to their Officers, saying, Ye shall give the
people no more straw to make brick, (as in time past) but let them go and
gather them straw themselves. Notwithstanding lay upon them the number of brick
which they made in time past, diminish nothing thereof: for they be Idle,
therefore they cry, saying, Let us go to offer sacrifice unto our God. Lay more
work upon the men and cause them to do it, and let them not regard vain words,
Chapt. 5. ver. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

13. That which did most discourage Moses from having any more to deal with
Pharaoh, was his Experience of his uninclineable disposition to any good Motion
which he could make on the behalf of Gods People. And this diffidence or
backwardness in Moses, received Nutriment from the wayward and grumbling
disposition of the Israelitish People against him and Aaron, after Pharaoh had
given them a peremptory charge to perform the same task, which they had done
before when they had allowance of straw from the Egyptians. Then the Officers
of the children of Israel saw themselves in an evil case, because it was said,
Ye shall diminish nothing of your brick, nor of every days task. And they met
Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: And
they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge, because you have made
our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his
servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us, verse 19, 20, 21.

After the Lord had given Moses more Special Instructions and new
Encouragements, Chapt. 6. verse. 1. and laid a stronger Tie upon him and Aaron
to deliver his Message unto Pharaoh, then he did upon Pharaoh to obey it; [And
the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Go in, speak unto Pharaoh King of Egypt,
that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. And Moses spoke before
the Lord, saying, Behold* the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me:
how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? And the Lord
spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of
Israel, and unto Pharaoh, King of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of
the land of Egypt, verse. 10, 11, 12, 13.] Yet this Charge does not altogether
charm Moses his muttering; for he takes up, as it seems, the same Note again,
verse. 30. Then Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,
and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? But perhaps this last Clause might be a
mere Repetition of the former, interserted by Moses, the writer of this Story,
rather then a Reiteration or resumption of the former Complaint, or matter of
grievance. Unto this Conjecture I should the more incline, had not the Lord
given Moses a Second Encouragement much different from the former, immediately
after the Repetition or Resumption mentioned, Chap. 6. verse last. For so it
follows in the next words, Chapt. 7. verse. 1, 2. Then the Lord said to Moses,
Behold, I have made thee Pharaohs God, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy
prophet. Thou shall speak all that I command thee, and Aaron thy brother shall
speak unto Pharaoh that he send the children of Israel out of his land. Here
was a great Encouragement to undertake so hard a Service. But what
Encouragement could either Moses or Aaron take from the next passage of Gods
Instructions or Declaration of His Will unto them, verse 3? [But I will harden
Pharaohs heart, and multiply my miracles and my wonders in the land of Egypt.]
This is a Question worth the asking; and the Resolution of it, worth
considering: For that which most discouraged Moses from obeying the Lords
commands, was his suspicion or presumption that Pharaoh would not hearken to
him, nor regard his Signs, as Aequivalent to Letters of Credence. How then
should he take heart and courage by knowing that perfectly which before he did
but suspect or fear, to wit, that Pharaoh would not, or that he could not
hearken unto him? Now thus much Moses could not but know from Gods own
Declaration of his purpose to harden the heart of Pharaoh, verse 3, 4, etc. And
this Question will beget a Second, on whose Resolution the clearing of the main
Difficulty will most depend. This Second Question or Quaerie is; [ What manner
of Hardening the Lord meant in the forecited 3. verse? Whether he meant a
Positive, and direct Hardening by way of Necessary Causalitie, See Chapt. 42.
Numb. 4.
or Physical Determination of Pharaohs Will or Spirit unto obstinacy, or
unrelenting stubbornness (at least from the Date of Gods forementioned
Declaration of his will unto this purpose;) or a Privative, or some other way?]

14 This Question is so Captious, that it is incapable of any One Punctual
Answer, whether Affirmative or Negative. The best is, that the whole Knot may
be clearly dissolved by distinguishing the Differences of Times or several
Treaties between Moses and Pharaoh.

In respect of the three or four last Signs and the Treaties upon them, This
Affirmative Answer is Punctual, [Pharaohs heart was Positively hardened by God,
or rather infatuated by means extraordinary and altogether unusual, unless in
two or three like extraordinary Cases.] In respect of the Five or six first
signs or miracles wrought by Moses and Aaron in the sight of Pharaoh, This
Negative Answer is as punctual; [Pharaohs heart was not hardened by God either
Positively or directly, much less Irresistibly.] The Means or manner how his
heart became hardened, were but Ordinary; only by Moses his Proposal of such
Conditions unto him, as his proud heart was naturally averse from; and by
pressing him to grant them in such a manner, as would Provoke his avaritious
mind to resist or deny them. The true Tenor of Gods former Speech to Moses is
but this: This is the Answer to the former Question propounded in the 13.
Paragraph. What encouragement could either Moses --?
If Pharaoh will not hearken unto thee nor let my people go upon the sight of
the first signs and wonders which thou shall be enabled to work before him and
his people: let not this dismay thee, or make thee give over thy Charge: for
the longer he is or shall be in yiedling; the greater will be thy victory, and
his Case the harder: For assure thy self, in the end he shall be willing to let
you go; both he and his people shall entreat you to be gone out of their
Coasts: I will multiply my Signs so fast upon them, that Egypt and all other
Nations shall be taught to know, who is the Lord even the Lord God of the
Hebrews and of Israel.

15. All the Discouragements that Moses had either from Pharaoh, from the
Egyptians, or from the Israelites, are cured by This that God would break
through all difficulties, He would lay his hand on Egypt, and bring forth his
Armies, and make the Egyptians, etc. know, that He was the Lord. See Exodus 7.
ver. 4. 5.
But more particularly to revise the Characters of Mosaical Expressions. How
Pharaohs heart upon the sight of Moses his signs and miracles, became hardened
by several degrees. Upon the exhibition of the First Wonder, which was the
Turning of Aarons Rod into a Serpent, it is thus written Chapt. 7. ver. 13. So
Pharaohs heart was hardened (...) and he ha^kened not to them as the Lord had
said. This Phrase [Pharaohs heart was hardned] may refer more properly to
Aaron then unto God as the Agent, if the speech be to be construed Personally:
or otherwise, to Aarons Rod, or to the Sign or Wonder it self: in which (to
speak with due reverence unto the truth) there was no such extraordinary force
as would have inclined an unregenerate man's heart, though by nature and habit
no way so stubborn as Pharaohs was, to have yielded forthwith to Moses's
requests or demands; seeing the Magicians of Egypt did the like. This only may
be said (and it is all that can be said to the contrary) that the devouring of
the Magicians rods turn ^ d into serpents, by Aaron^ rod first so turned, was
very ominous, so ominous as the observation of it could not but either mollify
or harden Pharaohs heart; as perhaps it did both according to the several times
or vicissitudes of reflecting upon it. For his heart and desires being once
drawn a little from their natural Bent (by the sight of this Wonder) but not
fully broken, must either stand at the Point to which they were drawn or return
with greater violence to their former station. The Lord speaking in His own
Person to Moses ver. 14. says not, I have hardened Pharaohs heart, but
Pharaohs heart is hardened; he ref^seth to let the people go: which can imply
no other hardening then such as did result or rebound upon the sight or
consideration of the wonder. Upon the exhibition of the second Sign, to wit,
the turning of the waters of Pooles and Rivers into blood, which was somewhat
more fearful then the former; Moses his expression of Pharaohs disposition is
Impersonal, ver. 22. And Pharaohs heart was hardened. And it was no
extraordinary wonder that his heart should be hardened again, in such a sense or
after such a manner as it was upon the sight of the first Wonder; seeing the
Magicians or sorcerers did the like: Thus much only may seem extraordinary or
to carry a great deal of odds on Moses and Aarons behalf, in that this plague
could not be removed by any Magicians Spell or skill in sorcerie; but only by
Mose's prayers unto God. This might well have wrought relentance in any
ordinary Heathen Prince, which had but the patience to take the circumstances
into consideration. But the Holy Ghost (to my apprehension) gives the true
reason why, and by what means Pharaohs heart was at this time hardened, verse
23. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to
this also. And his not setting his heart to This Wonder with its circumstances,
did bring a necessity upon him to have his heart hardened in some further
degree then it had been with the First wonder. But Pharaoh (as we read) was
more terrified with the sight of the Froggs; which notwithstanding the Egyptian
Magicians did by sorcerie produce, or at least which Pharaoh their Master was
persuaded that they did produce.

But the Production could not be without his help; nor the Persuasion but by
his permission or sufferance, who had enabled Moses to do this strange work: In
which This is most remarkable, that Pharaoh should so earnestly entreat Moses
and Aaron to remove this plague, or to confine the Froggs unto the River only,
verse 8. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron; and said, Entreat the Lord
that he may take away the froggs from me, and from my people, and I will let
the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord. And Moses is as ready
to grant, as Pharaoh was earnest to request this Favor of him, verse 9, 10,
11. And Moses said unto Pharaoh: Glory over me; (that is, you shall command
me.) When shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people,
to destroy the froggs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the
river only? And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word,
that thou may know that there is none like unto the Lord our God. And the
froggs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and
from thy people: they shall remain in the river only.

But this relentance in Pharaoh was but like the Devils vow to turn Monk in a
languishing Fit, but as soon as the Fit was off him (as the Fable is) he turned
to his wonted Byas, and became, and so continues, an erranter knave then he was
before: For so it follows, verse 15. But when Pharaoh saw that there was
respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them as the Lord had
said. This cannot be understood save only of such an Indirect or Concomitant
Obduration as has before been expressed, that is, a Resumption of his former
proud and avaritious Resolutions; the Resultance of which could be no other but
a measure of Induration so much greater then the former that had befallen him,
by how much the sight of the Froggs had mollified his heart more then the two
former wonders had done. Yet does not Pharaoh upon the sight of any of these
three, bewray such a stubborn wilful disposition, as he did upon the
exhibition of the Fourth Miracle, which his Enchanters did plainly confess
surpassed their skill, Chapt. 8. 18, 19. And the Magicians did so with their
enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon
man and upon beast. Then the Magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is THE FINGER OF
GOD: And Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them as the
Lord had said. The finger of God then was remarkable in Working the Miracle
which the Magicians could not; but no way remarkable in hardening Pharaoh: Nor
is it either said or intimated, that the Finger of God did harden Pharaohs
heart, but Pharaohs heart remained obstinate: and he hearkened not unto them as
the Lord had said, verse 19. His not hearkening unto them, was the cause of his
Induration.

16. But this Miracle of the lice was to Pharaoh more loathsome, then terrible:
And for this reason happily he did not either so fairly or so earnestly entreat
Moses and Aaron to pray for him, as he had done upon the sight of the Froggs:
and as he straight way after did upon the noisome experience of the miraculous
swarms of Flies, ver. 21, 22, 23, 24. And ver. 25. Then Pharaoh called for
Moses and Aaron and said, Go, do Sacrifice unto your God in this Land. The
offer is so niggardly that Moses disdains to accept of it, cannot so much as
hear it without such Indignation as is expressed ver. 26. It is not meet to do
so: for then we should offer unto the Lord our God that which is an abomination
unto the Egyptians: Lo, can we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
before their eyes, and they not stone us? Notwithstanding all the former
Documents of Gods power and wisdom in still overreaching Pharaohs skill or
Potencie; Yet the Caitiffe out of covetousness seeks to drive his bargain as
low as may be* For when Moses was peremptory to go three days journey into the
wilderness to sacrifice; Pharaoh yielded somewhat more, then he had done in
the former G^ant, to wit, that they might go into the wilderness: but (as if
he had known neither what to say nor what to do) he instantly limits his
Commission, ver. 28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go that you may sacrifice
unto the Lord your God in the wilderness: But go not far away. And (as if
that had been the least part of his present intentions) he adds immediately,
and as it were with the same breath, Pray or Entreat for me. And so Moses did,
as it follows, ver. 29. but with this Canonical and peremptory Monition [But
let Pharaoh from henceforth deceive no more, in not suffering the people to
sacrifice unto the Lord.] Upon his fraudulent contempt of this Peremptory
monition the Lord begins to deal more severely with him and to proceed unto
sentence, and that a more dreadful one then had befallen him, if he had not
dealt so deceitfully, as he did at this turn also; for it follows, ver. 32. Yet
Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, and did not let the people go.
Moses in his next Treaty repeates the sum of his first Embassage unto him;
and presses him, by thronging new plagues upon him, to come to his trial,
Chap. 9. ver. 1, 2, 3. Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh and
tell him, Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews, let my people go that they may
serve me: for if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still; Behold,
the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle, etc. This word Ecce, as in most other
places, is here a special Character of the speedy execution of the Plague that
was threatened, and of the remarkable manner how it was executed, ver. 4. And
the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and
there shall nothing dye of all that is the Childrens of Israel. And the Lord
appointed a set time saying, To morrow the Lord shall do this thing in the
Land. And the Lord did that thing on the morrow: and the cattle of Egypt died;
but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one, ver. 5. 6. Pharaohs
experience of the former Plagues foretold by Moses, and accomplished in his
own sight, did persuade him so far to believe his Prediction of this, that he
sent into Goshen to know the truth of that part of it: And behold there was not
one of the cattle of the Israelites dead, v. 7. And yet as it follows in the
same verse, The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

17. All or most of the former signs were respectively rather more noisome and
terrible, then detrimental unto Pharaoh and his People. We do not read before
this time of the death or destruction of any useful creatures, besides of
Fishes when the waters were turned into blood. And this calamity was neither
so grievous nor so universal, as the murrain of cattle was. It extended only to
that part of the River, or those waters that were nigh to Pharaohs Court:
otherwise the Magicians or Inchanters could have had no Place to practice their
skill in. But this murrain of the most useful creatures, was very general: Nor
would the Magicians have attempted the like, if it had been apprehended as
facible by them; seeing both the Egyptians and themselves should have been
greater Losers by the Practice of their own cunning. But seeing this Plague did
not infect Pharaohs coffers or treasure Cities, (which the Israelites were
enjoined to build, or to prepare materials for their building,) nor yet
Pharaohs Chariots or Stables: hence happily it is that he is not so much affected
with the wonder, as he had been with some of the former. And yet because this
wonder did give little or no check unto his proud stubborn thoughts, the Lord
instantly and without further Commission (as being now in Process of Sentence)
commands Moses to bring another Plague upon the Egyptians more terrible and
noisome then any of the rest had been, ver. 8. Then the Lord said unto Moses
and unto Aaron; Take to you handfuls of the ashes of the furnace, etc. And they
took ashes of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up
toward heaven: and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and
upon beast. And the Magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the
boyles: for the boil was upon the Magicians and upon all the Egyptians, ver. 10
11. Whether Pharaoh did resume or continue his former Resolutions without any
relentance, the Text is silent; but express enough to this purpose, That the
Lord did from this time harden the heart of Pharaoh after a more extraordinary
manner then it had been hardened before: for so the words do run, ver. 12. And
the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as the
Lord had spoken unto Moses.

But what was it that the Lord had spoken unto Moses? Or where did he specially
speak to this purpose? The place whereto these words [As the Lord had spoken
unto Moses] do punctually referr, is, as our English margin directs us, Exodus
4. 21. And the Lord said unto Moses, when thou go to return into Egypt, See
that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand:
But I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. In most of
the former Treaties between Moses and Pharaoh; Or in the relation of the
success or effect of his speech or works, this Epiphonema or Close comes often
in. [That Pharaoh hearkened not to Moses and Aaron as the Lord had spoken.] But
in none of them besides this present is it so expressly added, that [the Lord
did harden the heart of Pharaoh, as he had spoken unto Moses.] This different
Character of this Close from the rest, gives us to understand, or intimates at
least, That this plague of blaines was the first of all the plagues in which
the Lord did harden the heart of Pharaoh after any extraordinary manner.

But after what manner did he now harden it? Not by Infusion of any bad
Quality or new unhallowed Resolutions; but by giving him up to his own lusts,
or by leaving him more open and exposed to the temptations of Satan then he
had been. From this time and not before, does That of our Apostle, Romans 9. 17.
[For this very purpose have I made thee stand, that I might show my power in
thee:] Commence, or begin to take place. Now thus to infatuate Pharaoh or
suffer him to infatuate himself after he had so often hardened his own heart
and slighted Gods forewarnings, was a true Act of justice; and withal a
Prognostic that the just Lord was now Purposed to destroy him. So the heathens
out of their broken Speculations of Divine Providence, have observed: Quos
Jupiter vult perdere, prius de^entat: Infatuation is commonly the Usher of
fearful destruction.

God in all this, deals no otherwise with Pharaoh; then pharaoh had done with
the poor oppressed Israelites, immediately after the delivery of Moses first
Embassage unto him. Pharaoh, upon this occasion (as was observed before)
severely exacts the same Tale of bricks after he had prohibited the
Taskmasters to afford them any straw, which they performed before when they
had plenty of straw allowed them. The Lord in like manner requires but the same
obedience of Pharaoh after he had deprived him of understanding, and of the
sweet influence of his ordinary general Providence; which he had required of
him before, or at the exhibition of the first signs or wonders. And this only
is it which ministered the occasion or matter of that question made by our
Apostle, (...); why does he yet chi^e? unto which I have no more to say for the
present then may be found in the Treatise upon that place, Romans 9. 19. See
Chapter 42. of this Book Number. 6.

18. But to finish this present Survey of the Mosaical Story concerning this
proud and foolish Pharaoh: it is a witty Character which Kai (...), etc. Lib.
2. Antiq. Iud. Cap. 5.
Josephus has made of his humorous wilful disposition: That after he had seen
and in some measure felt three or four several plagues, he had a kind of
itching humor, or longing desire to have more variety of experiments in the
like kind. This the diligent reader may with me easily observe; That upon his
sight of the first signs, and experiments of the Plagues which did accompany
them; he demeand himself like a proud Fantastic Humorist, and did many ways
bewray such a temper as it was impossible for him to become wise, until he had
abandoned his former dispositions or resolutions. But after the Plagues of the
Murrain of cattle and of the blaines upon the Inchanters themselves; this
proud Fantastic falls into a Phrenzie and fares like a distracted Bedlam, and
raves as if his brains had been blasted by the fumes or steames of his
cauterized heart or seared conscience: Witness those Passages following, Exodus
9. 27. And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said unto them; I
have sinned this time, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
Entreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thundrings and
bail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. Now albeit Moses
after he had promised him to remove this Plague, did foretell him that he would
not be so good as his promise, ver. 30. [But as for thee and thy servants, I
know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God:] Yet, as it follows ver. 34.
When he saw the rain and the bail and the thunder were ceased, he sinned yet
more and hardened his heart, he and his servants. And again, Chap. 10. ver. 7.
After his servants upon the sight of the Plague of the Locusts, did thus boldly
entreat him; [How long shall this man be a snare unto us? Let the men go, that
they may serve the Lord their God: know thou not yet that Egypt is
destroyed?] Though he yield to their request in part, yet he instantly
faulters, ver. 8. And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he
said unto them, Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?
And Moses said, we will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and
with our daughters; with our flocks and with our herds will we go: for we must
hold a feast unto the Lord. And he said unto them, let the Lord be so with you,
as I will let you go and your little ones. Look to it, for evil is before you.
Not so, Go now ye that are men and serve the Lord: for that you did desire: and
they were driven out from Pharaohs presence. The like raving Fit or
Phrenetical Symptom you may observe in him, ver. 16, 17. Then Pharaoh called
for Moses and Aaron in have, and he said, I have sinned against the Lord your
God and against you: Now therefore forgive I pray thee my sin only this once,
and entreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
Now though Moses did remove this Plague: yet upon his fresh entreatie for Moses
to remove another Plague, to wit, of palpable darkness, he turns unto his
vomit again, ver. 24. 25. And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve
the Lord: only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones
also go with you. And Moses said, thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God, etc. And ver. 28.
Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me: take heed to thy self, see my face no
more: for in that day thou see my face, thou shall dye: A speech more foolish
then proud, to come from a man whom the Lord had so much impoverished, and so
often humbled; and given sufficient proof of his Power to bring far greater
Plagues upon him.

19. Though his heart had been thus often hardened; yet is it not become so
flinty, but that the slaughter of his own, and of every Firstborn Male in
Egypt, did make deeper impression upon it, then any of the former Plagues had
done. The mighty Outcry which followed upon this sad and woeful spectacle to
be seen in every house, did so far awake the drowsy spirits amongst the
Egyptians, even of such as had no children to mourn for; that they joined in
Petition with the rest to have the Israelites fairly dismissed: and were ready
to make them a Golden bridge for their speedier Passage out of Egypt. From this
time and not before were the Women and Maids of Egypt willing to bestow their
jewels and earrings upon the Israelitish women; that they might woo their men
and children to depart with speed. Thus then, that which the Lord had
indefinitely promised unto Moses from his first Instructions given unto him,
Exodus 3. 21. was not accomplished till this last Plague was exhibited. Nor was
the like Prediction of hardening Pharaoh, Exodus 4. 21. put in execution, before
the Plagues of the Murrain of Cattle and of Blains, Exodus 9. 12.

20. But from this Mollification of Pharaoh and of his peoples hearts by the
slaughter of the Firstborn, there did result a more strange Induration then at
any time before had befallen them. Of all the infatuated resolutions which
either King or People had adventured upon; the pursuing of the Israelites with
such a mighty army or strong hand, after they had fairly entreated them to
depart out of their coasts, may well to every indifferent Reader seem the most
stupid. And so the Author of the Book of Wisdom censures it, Chap. 19. 3. For
whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation at the graves of the
dead, they added another foolish Device, and pursued them as Fugitives whom
they had entreated to be gone. Yet Josephus a grave and sagacious Historian
gives the intelligent Reader good hints, that even this effect or Phrenetical
Symptom of Divine Infatuation, was but such as has seized upon worldly wise
Princes and Statesmen in former Ages; And hereafter may be inflicted upon
more. The greatest variety of Miracles or Wonders in any one Age experienced,
is scarce sufficient to make up a perfect Induction, to persuade superstitious,
profane, or wilful Spirits, of Gods absolute Power to effect; or of his
Wisdom, to contrive the like in every kind. Most men are prone by nature to
make such Collections, as the servants of the King of Syria did: Their Gods are
Gods of the bills, therefore they were stronger then we: but let us fight
against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger then they, etc. 1
King. 30. 23. The undoubted Experiments of the forecited signs all done in
Egypt, might well persuade Pharaoh and his People, That The Lord God of the
Hebrews was more skilful in producing wonders, then the Gods which the
Magicians of Egypt served, were; that Moses under him had a greater command
over the wind and water; over the air and clouds; over the dust of the earth,
and over all the host of reasonless creatures; then either the King, the
Princes, or Priests of Egypt could ever procure from their Gods; a more
Sovereign Authority over Flies, then Baal-zebub had. All this being granted
they might notwithstanding thus Reason in their hearts. Who knows whether all
this power was given unto Moses to be exercised only within the Meridian, or
Climes of Egypt: or whether his Commission might extend over Palestina and
Madian? The Egyptians at least presumed that The Lord God of the Hebrews had
not given Moses such a great command over the armies or hosts of men as the
King of Egypt had; because the Israelites (they knew) had no skill in Feats of
arms; no Captains of Insante^ie; no Cavalrie at all, no weapons or engines of
war, offensive especially, amongst them: Of all which the Egyptians had
abundance; plenty of Magazines full of them.

21 Upon these or the like Presumptions or vain Collections, they became
fool-hardie, and desperately resolute to be avenged upon the children of Israel;
for all the miseries, harms and losses which Moses and Aaron, their chief
leaders had brought upon them: whereas The Lord God of the Hebrews had at this
time purposed, solemnly to declare to all the world, That vengeance belonged
unto him alone, and that he would repay it upon those who had best deserved it,
that was upon the Egyptians; who for a long time by many ways and in diverse
kinds had wronged the Israelites, who at no time had wronged them. As for the
Egyptians loss of Cattle, and of Grain; or for their bodily annoiances by
frogs, by blains, etc. These were the just Awards of Gods Punitive Justice upon
Pharaoh and his servants for part of the wrongs which they and their
Predecessors had done by bringing them into undeserved Bondage.

But The Lord God of the Hebrews had not as yet called this present Pharaoh, or
the State of Egypt to an exact reckoning or full account for making away so
many Infant-Males of the Hebrews by drowning them in the river, or other like
cruel practices against them. Now, that the Egyptians might become the chief
Executioners of Gods vengeance upon themselves for the shedding of innocent
blood, he gave them over to their own proud Phansies, to their own vain
imaginations or presumptions of good success by pursuing the Israelites, whom
they had upon fair terms requested to depart out of their Land. And of all the
Hardenings or Infatuations which had possessed the heart of Pharaoh and his
Council of State, this was the greatest and strangest, That they should
adventure to give the Israelites fierce Chase after they saw, or might have
perceived the Red sea to open her bosom to give the children of Israel Passage.
All this was the Lord God of the Hebrews his doing, that the blood of the
Hebrew Infants might be required of the Egyptians (...), according to the Law
of Retaliation, or most exquisite Rule of Punitive Justice.

This present Pharaohs Predecessor (whether his Father or no I know not) with
the advice of his Council of State and War, had designed the poor Hebrew
infants as a Prey to the fishes or other ravenous watercreatures. Now the
righteous Lord God of the Hebrews makes this proud Pharaoh his Successor in the
height of his strength; and his mighty Army and States men, a Prey not only to
the fishes and Sea Monsters, but a visible booty to the promiscuous sorts of
ravenous creatures which inhabit the wilderness, See the 9. Book of Comm. upon
the Apostles Creed. Chapt. 43. Numb. 2.
Psalm. 74. 14. Thou brakest the heads of Leviathan in pieces, and gave him
to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

22 He that would in vacancie from other businesses diligently peruse the
History of Exodus from the first Chapter to the twelfth, may find many fair,
and unto this day fresh maps of Gods patience, and long-suffering toward
sinners; of his mercy and loving kindness toward his servants, specially to
the Oppressed; and many live durable Pictures of his Justice punitive upon
obstinate incorrigible Transgressors; but no Type or shadow of Peremptory
Absolute Reprobation: Not one Clause is there in all this Long Relation which
looks or can be wrested that way: no not in the Construction or Paraphrase
which the Author of the Book of Wisdom makes upon it; A man (I must ever
acknowledge) of an excellent Contemplative Spirit; as full as the moon in
points of high speculation of Gods general Providence in governing the world:
and yet a man when he comes to discuss the different manner of Gods dealing
with the righteous, (these in his language are The Seed of Abraham) and the
wicked Heathen; so far from being Canonical that he is scarce Orthodoxal:
often by Fitts exhibiting certain Crises to the observant Reader that he was in
some measure infected with that disease, whose cure St. Paul did so earnestly
wish unto his Countrymen the Jews. The radical Disease common to the whole
Jewish Nation of that time, and to this learned Author (whom for this reason
alone, were no others alleged by the learned Rainolds, Philo Judaeus, Author
of the Book of Wisd.
I should conjecture to be Philo Judaeus) was This; [That because they were the
The Seed of Abraham, they were the only righteous seed: and however the Lord
God of their Fathers did often chastise and correct them; yet all his
corrections were Filial; that he would not, or could not at any time plague
them, as he had done the unrighteous Heathen; or punish them with like
blindness of mind or hardness of heart, as he had done the Egyptians.] The
Receipt or medicine given by our Apostle for curing this Disease in his
Countrymen then living, and for preventing the like in after Ages whether in
Jew or Gentile, we have set down, Romans 9. 18. Therefore has he mercy on whom
he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens. The Extract or Quintessence
of which Aphorism, is This; That the Lord was not so tied by Oath or Promise
unto Abraham but that he might and would harden the hearts and blind the eyes
of his seed after the same manner he had done Pharaohs and the Egyptians; if at
any time they should become as obstinate as Pharaoh and his People had been; or
harden their own hearts by indulgence to their lewd affections or by neglect
and contempt of Gods forewarnings; specially, these being seconded by signs and
Wonders no less admirable, then Moses had showed in Egypt.

23. To harden the seed of Abraham even by Sarah; or to suffer them to harden
their own hearts after a stranger manner and for a longer space then the
Egyptians were hardened, upon supposal or discovery of the like (though less)
pride of heart, obstinacy or contempt of Gods Ambassadors; could be no
prejudice to Gods Oath to Abraham; no impeachment of Promised Loving-kindnesse
unto David, but rather a Constat to all the World, That the God of Abraham was
no accepter of Persons: but that in every nation, who fears him and loves
righteousness shall be accepted, Acts 10. 34. And by the Authentic Rule of
Contraries, Every Nation; all and every one of any Nation that despises him
and works unrighteousness shall be rejected by him: And they above others
most obnoxious to grievous temptations and Induration, who had better
opportunities to know him and greater motives to fear and love him; and out of
love toward him to do that which is right and good both in his sight, and in
the sight of men. This was the state or condition of the Seed of Abraham from
time to time after their deliverance out of Egypt, specially after the building
of the second Temple and rebuilding it by Herod.

24. The principal Point remaining only to be touched upon by me, but which I
would commend to the serious consideration and accurate sifting of other
Students in Divinity, is, A parallel, betwixt Pharaohs Cruelty toward the
Jews; and the Jews cruelty toward Christ and his Apostles.
A Parallel between the cruel oppression and stubbornness of Pharaoh and his
People in Moses's time and a little before; and the ingratitude, stubborness,
and malicious cruelty of the Jews toward Gods people and his Ambassadors for
their good, in the days of our Savior and his Apostles. Equality of
cruelty, ingratitude, or contempt of Gods Messengers in the Jewish Nation,
must needs by the Rule of Justice, induce an Excess of Induration or
Infatuation upon them.

To draw the Parallel aright. After the first cruel Pharaoh had begun to
oppersse the Israelites and murder their Infant Males, Moses is born and
designed by God to be his Embassdor unto Pharaoh for his Peoples release from
bondage. Upon the continuance of this oppression by the second Pharaoh, which
the former had begun, The Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of of my
people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry, by reason of their
Taskmasters: for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out
of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of the Land, unto a good
Land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, Exodus 3. 7, 8. The
Seed of Abraham was no less grievously oppressed by the Romans; and by Herod
the Great their Deputy. And (which was worst of all) their own Governors laid
heavy burdens of conscience upon them: Many of them were tormented in body, if
not in soul, by the Devil. The depth as well of the Peoples as of the
Governors misery was, That they did not perceive or rightly apprehend the
danger of their disease. In commiseration of all these and other parts of their
affliction, The same Lord God which had appeared to Moses in the Bush, and
testified that he was come down to see the affliction of the Israelites under
Pharaoh, did now the second time descend from heaven to earth to visit the
affliction of his people under the Romans and their Governors; showing his
Commission to this purpose by many signs and Wonders, much greater and more
gracious then Moses had wrought in Egypt; most of them respectively exhibited
in the sight of the Pharisees, Priests, and Elders and of all the people, but
with worse success in respect of them, for whose good they were purposely and
especially wrought, then Moses his miracles had found in Egypt. The Egyptians
('it is true) did not hearken unto Moses, nor hold his miracles in that esteem
which they deserved: but to persecute, to stone, or otherwise to slay or
murder Moses, we do not read of any attempt made by them, until after he had
departed with Gods People out of Egypt. Whereas the Scribes and Pharisees with
the Priests and Elders upon the more frequent sight of our Saviors Miracles
did not only harden their own hearts, but wrought the people (otherwise well
inclined unto his Doctrine) to such an hardness of heart, that they persecuted
The God, or Great Angel of the Covenant, who had appeared to Moses in Mount
Sinai, unto a bloody ignominious death: and (which does aggravate the sin)
sought the release of Barabbas the Murderer, that is, by name and quality,
the Son of their Father the Devil, whilst he stood in competition with the
only Son of God for enjoying the benefit of that Boon, which by the indulgence
of the Romans was granted to them at every Feast of the Passover, in
remembrance of their Fathers deliverance out of Egypt.

25. More foolish again by much these Scribes and Pharisees with their
Accomplices were, then the Egyptians in Moses^s time had been; in that they
persecuted (as far as in them lay) the Lord God of their Fathers after his
departure out of this World, by procuring a watch or guard to be set about his
grave, seeking thereby to stop his passage, which he had foretold, from death
to life. But he in the mean time gives evident Proof, that he had greater Power
and more sovereign command over the earth, over the rocks and grave it self,
then Moses had over the waters of Egypt or the Red Sea, which Moses (by virtue
of his power whose Ambassador he was) did command to swallow up the Egyptians
alive. This second Moses or Great Prophet like unto him, after his death
commands the rocks to cleave asunder, and the earth and grave to give up their
dead. No marvel if, after the Jews had thus wilfully and desperately hardened
their own hearts, the Lord God of their Fathers have hardened their hearts
after a stranger manner then he did the hearts of Pharaoh and his People, and
for a longer space; even to this present day.

Besides all other odds of circumstantial considerations from our Saviors
fore-warnings or admonitions, the measure of that blindness or Induration
which possessed these later Jews, did most justly accrue from neglect of that
Peremptory monition, which Moses their Lawgiver had given them, Deuteronomy. 18. 15,
16, 17, 18, 19. The Lord thy God will raiseup unto thee a prophet from the
midst of thee, like unto me, unto him shall ye hearken. According to all that
thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, in the day of the Assembly,
saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see
this great fire any more, that I die not. And the Lord said unto me, They have
well spoken that which they have spoken. I will raise them up a prophet from
among their brethren like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he
shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass,
that whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I
will require it of him.

26 Here were a fit place, A Parallel betwixt Moses and Christ Jesus
and fair Occasion to institute a Parallel, or decypher the similitude between
Moses, and Jesus the great Prophet, as the people did often enstyle him: a
point whereunto I have spoken somewhat in the Third Book of Comments upon the
Apostles Creed; Chap. 11. The diligent Reader I know may find much more for
his better satisfaction in many learned Commentators upon the 18. of
Deuteronomie, and the 3. of the Acts; and amongst others, in the learned
Gualter, who is not in this point so prolix as in most other of his Comments,
upon the Acts. At this time, and in this place these Two Circumstances only
present themselves to my Memory, which I shall commend to the ingenuous
Readers view. The First, That Moses was born at that very time wherein the
Pharaoh, which then ruled over Egypt, had a design to make away all the Hebrew
Infant-Males, being thereunto solicited or provoked (as Josephus tells us) by
the suggestions of his Secretary, upon a Prenotion or Fame (which he had heard
or learned God knows from whom, or by what means) that there should about that
time arise a Prophet, or more then a Prophet, which should work great wonders
for the good of the Hebrews, or Israelites his kinsmen according to the flesh,
which could not be effected, Rebus sic stantibus, As the case stood then,
without dangerous prejudice to the Egyptians, Upon the like jealousy
occasioned by more then a public Fame, an Authentic Prenotion, That there
should about the latter end of Herod's reign, arise A Star in Jacob, a true King
of the Jews: the bloody Tyrant caused all the Males of Judah and Benjamin
about Bethlehem which were under two years, to be cruelly murdered; and yet
left the true King of the Jews, the Heir of David, the Flower of Jesse, and
Hope of Israel, untouched.

The Second Circumstance, or remarkable similitude between Jesus and Moses, was
this: Moses after the first cruel Pharaohs death, was commanded by God to
return into Egypt his native soil, upon assurance given him that they were dead
that sought his life. Joseph is warned in a dream, or Divine vision by night to
return with Jesus and his Mother out of Egypt into the land of Israel, Because
they were dead that sought the young child's life, to wit, Herod and his
Accomplices. Mat. 2. 20.
But my aim in this place (of which I hope I have not fallen much wide or
short) was to set the Parallel aright between the Induration or Infatuation of
the Egyptians, in Moses his days; and the Excaecation of the Jews, after their
contempt of our Saviors miracles, and more then Prophetical Monitions.

The Calendar made by the learned Author of the Book of Wisdom for the opposite
Fates or Destinies of the Egyptians and of the Jews, began in his own time, and
shortly after our Saviors Resurrection to be out of Date; and more then so,
quite inverted. Versa tabula currebant qui modo stabant; the Lot or destiny
which this good Author assigned unto the ungodly Egyptians, did fall upon his
Presumed Holy Ones the Jews his Contrymen: [Vnto these the destroyer gave
Place and was afraid of them: for it was enough that they only tasted of the
wrath. But as for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy unto the end:
for he knew before what they would do, Wisd. 18. 25. and 19. 1.] of the Jews
says St. Paul; They please not God, and are contrary to all men, forbidding us
to speak to the Gentiles that that they might be saved, to fill up their sins
always: for the wrath is come upon them (...) to the uttermost, or to the end.
The Author of the Book of Wisdom Whosoever he were, Philo or some other, did
slide or draw himself into a Twofold error, only by overstretching two
undoubted Canonical Truths: He had rightly observed that as the Canaanites, so
the Egyptians were an accursed seed from the beginning, as being the Offspring
of Cham; and that the children of Israel were a seed two ways blessed, as
being the Progeny of Sem and of faithful Abraham. Wherein then did he err or
fail in his Collections? First, in that he presumed the curse derived from
their Father Cham, should be perpetually upon the Egyptians: Secondly, that the
blessing derived from Sem and Abraham unto their seed, should be absolutely
everlasting. Our Apostle St. Paul partly by Observation, but especially by the
Spirit of Prophecy, did know or foresee that the Seed of Sem and of Abraham,
should fall into a greater measure of Induration to continue for a longer time,
then that which had befallen the Seed of Cham or the Egyptians: Yet did he not
hence Collect, or occasion us to think, that this curse upon his Contrymen
the Jews should be either universal or perpetual; but to continue only until
the Fullness of the Gentiles were come in.

Neither does he intimate that this blessing upon the Gentiles, Romans 11. 11.
specially the sons of Japhet, which were heirs in Reversion unto the Blessing
bestowed upon Sem, should continue unto the worlds end; but rather to determine
with the recalling of the Jews, whose Restoration (it is Probable) shall be
wrought or occasioned by the Infatuation or Obduration of the Gentiles, which,
through their ingratitude and contempt, is likely to become more grievous then
the Induration either of the Egyptians in Moses days or of the Jews after our
Saviors death.


27. If we would look upon the Face of Christendom at this Instant; How small a
Portion of it shall we find not either besmeared with its own blood or
disfigured with wounds and scarrs or other like signs of more then Jewish
Infatuation: and, which is of all the rest the most Ominous Praesage or Symtom,
the hearts of most Princes and Statesmen are so addicted to their own Politic
Resolutions, that if Gods true Ambassadors, though Prophets raised for this
purpose from the dead, should take upon them to forewarn them as boldly as
Moses did Pharaoh, to submit themselves unto The Lord; they should find more
harsh entertainment in ordinary Assemblies, then Moses did in Pharaohs Court;
as bad as our Saviors Apostles and Disciples found in Jerusalem or in Jewish
Synagogues. The best excuse or Apology which best Divines or Preachers of the
Gospel throughout most Christian or other Nations, can make for their
backwardness or want of boldness to deliver Gods Message unto greatest Princes
or other Statesmen, will be this; That seeing the Spirit of Prophecy is now
taken from them, they may not take upon them to use the boldness or animositie
which Moses and Aaron and other ancient Prophets did, even in the Presence of
greatest Princes. One duty notwithstanding the Ministers of the Gospel or
Christ's Ambassadors may duly practice, without danger, in the midst of this
perverse and crooked Generation in every State and Kingdom; a duty which we of
this Church and Kingdom are specially bound to perform, that is, to pray and
entreat the same God and Lord Jesus Christ which hardened King Pharaohs heart,
to remove his Plagues from all Christian Kings and Statesmen, as also from
Turkish, Mahumetan, or heathenish Princes; and to use these and the like Parts
following of our English Letanie or Liturgy, more then thrice a week, as we
are enjoined, twice at least every day evening and morning either in our
Public or private Devotions; From all blindness of heart, from pride,
vain-glorie, and hypocrisy, from envy, hatred, and malice, and all
uncharitableness, etc. From hardness of heart, and contempt of thy word and
commandments, Good Lord deliver not only all Christians Kings, but even such
Kings as Pharaoh was by Profession; and take from all Jews, Turks, infidels,
and Heretics all ignorance, hardness of heart and contempt of thy Word, and
make us all One Flock under One Shepherd, Jesus Christ the great Bishop and
Shepherd of our Souls, Amen.

CHAP. XLI.
SALVATION ONLY FROM GODS GRACE.
Or, An Exposition of Romans 9. 16. So then, it is not of him that wills, nor
of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.
THese words (as every observant Eye may see) bear the Stamp and Form of a
Conclusion or Collection; containing matter for its Truth as unquestionable,
and of as large Extent for good Use, as any Maxim in this whole discourse.
This Illative being turned into a simple Assertive, Non est volentis neque
currentis, etc, is as the Axis whereon the whole Doctrinal Part of this Epistle
revolves. But taking this Verse as it here lies (being both a Principle and a
Conclusion) the Lists of my Inquiry into it at this time (by Gods assistance)
shall be but Two: Vnde infertur? Quo refertur? 1. Two Inquiries.
From what Premises it is gathered. And 2. To what End it is referred; Or, To
what Use or purpose in the Apostles Intent it is specially applyable.

The Premises whence it is gathered first well sounded, will rectify our aim
or Level at the Scope whereto it is directed: And the End or scope being known,
will easily impart the right Use or Application. Amongst many Uses whereto
these words may serve, it is not the least, That their just Extent once rightly
taken will serve as a just measure or scantling to notify and unfold the
contents of many (...) in this Chapter, which have been as much perverted as
any places in all St. Paul's Epistles; because they have been the common Themes
of every illiterate vocalist or rural Scholar.

2. It is (I take it) agreed upon by all, (at least it will be denied by none)
that the principal End of this Epistle is, to establish these Romans, (whether
Jews or Gentiles by Progeny) in that Faith wherein they had been instructed.
And by the Line or Level which is directed to this End, must the Argument of
this present Chapter (as of all the rest) be squared. The Materials here
handled differ somewhat from the former; but Modus considerandi; their
Reference or Aspect to the proposed End, is the same. What the Apostle in this
place here inserts, either concerning the hardening of Pharaoh, the Reprobation
of the Modern Jews, or free Election of their Fathers, is purposely inserted
for under-propping or fortifying his Former Assertion; [That Justification or
Salvation must be sought by Faith only without Works.] To persuade the truth of
this our Assertion, no particular Allegations of Authorities or reasons can so
much avail with an ingenuous Auditor, as his own di-diligent Perusal of the 10.
and 11. Chapters; in which, The Resumption of his former Argument, is, to
cleare-sighted men more evident, then the Continuance of it, is in this: And
with his former Doctrine, in those two Chapters resumed, he intermingles
powerful admonitions to the Gentiles to make their Election Sure; unto which
purpose the Original and manner of the Jews Rejection, is in this Chapter
premised. And He that shall please in his more retired thoughts, unpartially to
survey the Connection which the 10. and 11. Chapters with the last part of this
9, have with the former, specially with the 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8; The stream or
Current of the Discourse will evidently bewray it self to be the same:
howsoever it may seem (a little before and after This 16, Verse) to run a close
way, or under ground; yet so, as the opening of it is apparent, verse 30. What
shall we say then? That the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness
have attained to righteousness: But Israel has not attained to
righteousness, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the
works of the Law. Verse 32.

3. The fairest Connection of this 9. Chapter with the former, in my opinion, is
This: The Apostle, having in the later end of the former Chapter confidently
avouched the Infallible Assurance of their hopes, which renouncing Works seek
Salvation only by Faith in Christ; and his heart having been dilated with joy
and exultation of spirit in contemplation of their happiness, is, in the
rebound, more deeply touched with sorrow for the Jews his contrymen and
kinsfolk according to the flesh: The lamentable Issue of whose excellent
Prerogatives, and strange miscarriage of their extraordinary pains and zealous
care in observing the Law, might well have danted the late converted Gentiles,
to whom he writes; and in men's esteem, much impaired the strength of all former
assurances which he had given them; unless he had further manifested the true
Original of the Fall or Rejection of Gods ancient people. This unfeigned sorrow
for their misery is so much the greater, (as every good man's in like case
would be:) by how much their Means of well doing had been the better; their
Approach to true happiness, nearer; and their Interest in Gods promises more
peculiar then other men's were. It little moves us to see a lazy unthrift come to
be a beggar: But to see a man extraordinarily industrious in his Calling, not
to thrive, or utterly to overthrow himself and his posterity, by some one
wilful humor, is grief to every other man that can take pains for his
living. This Original of our Apostles sorrow is expressly intimated by
himself, Chap. 10. Ver. 1, 2.

Brethren, my hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be
saved: for I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according
to knowledge. And in the 11. Chapter. he tells us Gentiles, ( what Moses before
had told these Jews;) That whenever they should turn again to the God of
their fathers, they were to have Precedencie of all other people in the world,
in his Everlasting and unchangable Love. I say then; Have they stumbled that
they should fall? God forbid. But rather through their Fall, salvation is come
unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. Now if the Fall of them be
the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them, the riches of the
Gentiles, how much more their fullness? ver. 11. 12. And again ver. 28, 29.
Concerning the Gospel, they are Enemies, for your sake: but as touching the
Election, they are beloved for the fathers sake, for the gifts and calling of
God are without repentance. And would it not greive any zealous soul that loves
the memory of his fathers? to see them so far estranged from their God, who
is not altogether estranged from them, but always ready when these Prodigals
shall return unto him, to embrace them as his dear Sons.

These are Points whose contemplation in our Apostle was deeper then our
shallow wits can rightly sound; and did cast him out of such an Ecstasie of
joy into such a sudden Trance of sorrow, that he had no leisure to express
the Causes of it in the beginning of this ninth Chapter, but is fain to reserve
it to the beginning of the tenth. The very depth of sorrow had swallowed up the
very stream or current of his discourse, and causes him to begin thus
abruptly: I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also hearing me
witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness, and continual sorrow
in my heart: For I could wish that my self were accursed from Christ, for my
Brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom
pertains the Adoption and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the
Law, and the Service of God, and the promises; whose are the Fathers, and of
whom as concerning the Flesh, CHRIST came, who is over all, GOD, blessed for
ever, Amen. He concludes his sorrow as though he had still prayed for them
whilst he sorrowed.

If it be further demanded what Peculiar occasion he had to be overtaken with
these sudden Pangs of sorrow, rather in this place (the beginning of this
ninth Chapter) then any other; the Special occasion, as I intimated before,
was, the present Opportunity or necessity of answering an Exception, which
from the Rejection of these Jews, might have been taken against those confident
Assertions wherewith He had concluded the former. And being to anatomize their
wounds, for others instruction, unto the quick; the sight of their
grievousnesse could not but make his heart to bleed.

4. Against his former Assertions (he saw) the Gentile or Jew late converted
would be ready thus to object, If they of whom Christ according to the flesh
came; If They for whose miscarriage Christ in the days of his flesh was more
sorrowful then thou can be: yet They, notwithstanding all these Prerogatives
and peculiar Interests in Gods Promises, are fallen away and utterly separated
from God: Where is the Infallibility of our assurance. What is the ground of
thy boasting? that Neither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor height, nor depth, nor
any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is
in Christ Jesus our Lord? Romans 8. 38, 39. Have we any warrant thus to persuade
our selves besides Gods Word? any better Assurance then his Promise? and seeing
these Jews thy Countrymen, as thou often inculcates, had both These in as
ample manner and Form, as we can expect: if neither took effect in Them, why
may not Both want their effects in us? With this Objection the Apostle, (if we
duly mark the Closure of his protested sorrow for the Jews Fall) directly
meets, ver. 6. Not as though the word of God had taken none effect. It was in
his eye when he fell into the former Trance; out of which awaked, he falls in
hand with it afresh again.

5. The more often and more seriously we read the Doctrinal Part of this
Epistle to the Romans, or of those other to the Galatians and the Hebrews, the
juster occasion we shall have always to admire our Apostles skill, as well in
right applying the Typical Praenotions or Aenigmatical Portendments of the Old
Testament to the Events in the New, as also in making use of whatsoever by the
Jews, or any on their behalf, could be Objected, for establishing the truth
which he maintained against them. For Instance at this time, take only The
manner of his Retorting the former Objection; wherein this whole Chapter, and
the other Two following are wholly spent. The manner is thus: It is true; The
Jews my kinsmen, who had greater Interest in Gods Love and Promises, then any
people besides them hitherto have had; as great as any after them can expect,
are become Cast-awaies. But spend your thoughts not so much in wondering at
this, as in Considering, that the only Cause of their Fall, was no other, then
Ignorance of this Doctrine which I now teach being formerly taught by the Law
and the Prophets. Be ye not therefore Partakers with them in this their Error:
and so Gods Promises shall undoubtedly take effect in you; for he has ordained
that their Fall shall be the means of your establishment.

The Ignorance of these his Countrymen was not Ignorantia purae negationis;
but pravae dispositionis, an Ignorance rooted in Carnal Pride, the offspring of
another Pernicious Error. They thought it sufficient to salvation, that they
were Israelites and the seed of Abraham: herein most grossly ignorant and more
inexcusable then the Heathen; seeing the Scripture had plainly given them to
understand, that They are not all Israel, that are of Israel, neither all
Children that are of the seed of Abraham; for Abraham had Ishmael and many
other children besides Isaac: and yet the Lord had said to Abraham, In Isaac
shall thy seed be called. The Mystical or Evangelical sense of which words in
our Apostles Exposition ver. 8. is this, They which are the children of the
flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the Promise are
accounted for The Seed. The true and Orthodoxal Construction of this
Apostolical Declaration (upon Moses's words) if we apply it unto the Romans to
whom, or unto our selves for whose good, he wrote it, and referr it to the End
by him intended and supposed throughout this whole Discourse is as much as if
he had said, Stand not ye upon the Prerogatives of the flesh, as my rejected
Countrymen have done, but betake your selves wholly to Gods Promises as
Abraham did, and ye shall undoubtedly remain the chosen seed of Abraham and
Children of God. His Assertion (or Assurance) is the same in effect with that
of St* John Chapt. 1. ver. 12, 13. As many as received him, to them he gave
power to be the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were
born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God. Nor does our
Apostle either here or in any other part of his writings once intimate any
other Cause of these Jews Rejection, besides that hereditary disease, whereof
the Baptist foresaw their best teachers dangerously sick, and for whose
prevention he prescribes a wary diet, whilst he offers the medicine of baptism
unto them. When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadduces come to his Baptism,
he said unto them; O Generation of Vipers, who has warned you to flee from the
wrath ^o come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for Repentance, and think not
to say within you selves, We have Abraham for our Father: for I say unto you
that God is able of these stones to Raise up Children unto Abraham, Mat. 3. 7,
8, 9. Had they steadfastly relied upon Gods Power manifested in the miraculous
birth of Isaac and the mighty increase of his Posterity, as they did upon
this glorious Title of being Abraham's and Isaacs seed, they might have been
sons not of Abraham only but of God. And no place of Scripture, in my
observation, warrants us to think, that they were excluded by any Immutable
Decree or irrevocable Act of Omnipotency from thus relying on Gods Power, or
from following Abraham's footsteps. Let us not then, I beseech you, in a matter
of so great Cosequence Presume to understand above that which is written, or to
make a further Resolution of men's Reprobation, then our Apostle has done. And
the First and only Cause into which he resolves the Rejection of these Jews, as
from the Conclusion of this discourse, ver. 32. is apparent, is, That they
sought salvation not by Faith but by works; not by relyance on Gods Power or
Promises, but by Confidence in these Carnal Prerogatives.

6. As it is dangerous to assign any Cause of Reprobation without warrant of
Scripture, so is it a Preposterous presumption to pronounce their Persons
Reprobated or accursed, whom the Scripture has proclaimed for Blessed. Yet
some in our times (unless my memory fail me) have ranked Ismael amongst the
Reprobates; when as Moses has registered the Grant of Abraham's Petition for
him, Genesis 17. 20.
As for Ishmael I have heard thee, Behold I have blessed him. Now Abraham
doubtless did pray in Faith; and his Faith questionless did as well respect
the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, as the blessings of this Life. Yea
his Prayer for him was conceived in that very form, which (as I have learned
from some too rigid in the doctrine of reprobation) is the true Character of
Gods Elect and Chosen. And for justifying their observation of this use of the
Phrase in other places of Scripture, they allege this Petition of Abraham,
Genesis 17. 18.
O that Ishmael might live before thee: which is, as if he had said, O that
thou would take Ishmael to be thy servant, and admit him into thy favor.
Just Abraham prays for, and the Almighty grants, I shmaels admission into
that presence of God, from which David desires he might not be cast out. Psalm.
51. 11.

7. But whatsoever became of Ishmael: Our Apostle foresaw the proud Jew would
Except against this instance (as they did against the like of our Saviors.
John 8. 41. We are not born of fornication;) We are Abraham's sons, not by the
Bondwoman, but by Sarah; and why then Twit'st thou us with Ishmael? His
Rejoinder follows in the next words, to this effect: Esau was Isaacs Son by
Rebecca, conceived at the same time, and born before your Father Jacob, who
notwithstanding got the blessing of Birthright from him. Was Esau therefore an
accursed Reprobate? God knows; I cannot tell: The bounds of my present
inquiry is, to what End or Use this Instance is brought by our Apostle; and
how it inferrs the Conclusion here in this 16. verse. Now from our Apostles
Principal Intent or Scope we can gather no other pertinent Use of his Instances
(in Esau and Jacob) save only this; That God in his allseeing wisdom did by
these Types mystically forewarn their Posterity, (as John Baptist his
Messenger, and his Son our Lord and Savior expressly and literally afterward
did) not to stand on their Genealogy, their Birthright, or other Prerogatives,
wherein flesh and blood, Abraham's seed above all others, were apt to boast; but
wholly to betake themselves to his Promises.

The Circumstances which evince and justify this Observation, are remarkably
contained in the holy Stories, whereto our Apostle, as his manner is, briefly
and in Transcursu referrs us; that we might see the Truth which he taught, with
our own eyes, and Rear our Faith upon the same Foundations from which his faith
had been raised. Abraham, after God had promised him [I will make of thee a
mighty Nation: In thy seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed] did
yet suspect lest all this might be fulfilled in his heir by Adoption, though by
Birth a stranger, and by condition a servant; until the Lord made a fuller
Declaration of his meaning. Genesis 15. 4. This. (Eliezer) shall not be thine
heir, but he that shall come forth of thine own bowels, he shall be thine
heir. After all this, Sarah complains, Behold now the Lord has restrained me
from bearing. And Abraham, hearkening to her counsel, which this distrust had
suggested, took Hagar her maid to wife, hopeing the former promise might be
accomplished in her Offspring, as it is Genesis 16. Abraham (to speak with
Reverence of his Infirmity) did herein mistake the Tenor of Gods promise, as
he had done once before: And to rectify his error, God further explicates his
meaning in promising Isaac. Genesis 17. 15. etc. Now, that which our Apostle would
have us specially to observe, is, That the Almighty in thus crossing righteous
Abraham's Will and purpose, first to make Eliezer, then Ishmael, his heir; did
hereby give posterity to understand, They were not to rely on the Will of man
or any Inventions of flesh and blood for attaining the blessing, but merely on
His Will revealed, who is able and willing to effect his promise, though by
means more miraculous then was Isaacs birth, or (to use S. John Baptists
words) though it were by raising up children out of stones to Abraham.

8. Isaac also had a greater longing to bestow his birthright upon Esau his
eldest son, then to eat of his Venison: for he sent him out to catch it, to the
end he might bless him with greater cheerfulness: And Esau was more forward
to gratify his old fathers desire, then was his brother Jacob. Yet, that
posterity might always bear in memory, the blessing did neither depend on
Isaacs Willingness to bestow it, nor on Esau's Running to deserve it of his
father, but wholly and merely on Gods purpose; Rebecca, to whom his purpose
was long before made known, finds a means to derive the Birthright to her
Younger son, while the Elder was rangeing abroad to compass it. It seems, she
had not imparted the Oracle to old Isaac before; Or He perhaps had forgotten
it, until the Event did call the meaning of it to his memory: And this
perchance may be the reason, why he is so patient of Circumvention by his wife,
as now perceiving it to be the Lords doing. However, the Lord before the
children were born; before they had done either good or evil, had told Rebecca
their mother, That the Nation which should spring from the Elder should be the
weaker, and serve the offspring of the Younger: And from this intimation she
wisely gathered, that the Birthright or blessing was, according to the Tenor
of Gods Free Donation, to be convaied unto the Younger. Had not this purpose of
the Almighty been revealed before the children had been born, before either
father or mother could have had any reason to affect the one more then the
other; Jacobs posterity (as they have been too foolish and arrogant) would have
baosted, That either their father Jacob, or his mother Rebecca which loved him
more then his brother Esau, had better observed those rites and customs
wherein they placed righteousness, then Isaac or Esau had done; and that God
upon these motives had bestowed the birthright or blessing upon Jacob before
Esau. And to no other Purpose, for ought I can by Analogy of Scripture
conceive, save only to Prevent this pride and hypocrisy in the Jew, or to
leave it without excuse, does our Apostle note that Circumstance of the Story,
before they were borne, or had done good or evil.

9. But as this takes away the former Reply or Apology: so it breeds a new
Objection: for did not God by his Law allot the Firstborn a double Portion,
and give him in every respect the Preeminence of his brethren?

If this Law were just and right, were it not unrighteousness in God to
bereave Esau of his Birthright or other Prerogative before he had offended the
Law or the Lawgiver, before he had done good or evil? No; He bestowed a greater
Inheritance upon Esau, then either his Father Isaac or his brother Jacob lived
possessed of, greater then by any customary Laws of Nations he could lay claim
unto. And the Firstborn among the sons of Jacob were bound to bless him for
his Goodness in allowing them a double Portion in blessings temporal: But he
had forewarned them as well by his own practice in Jacobs Case, as by his
Instructions given to Moses, not to seek his special Goodness by Plea of Law or
by custom of Nations; not to urge his own Law concerning Blessings temporal, to
Overruled his Will in bestowing Blessings Spiritual. All then which our Apostle
meant in his Reply to this Objection [Is there unrighteousness with God?] is
no more in effect, then This: God has reserved it as an Eternal Prerogative to
himself, To have mercy on whom he will have mercy; and to have compassion on
whom he will have compassion, not on them whom the present sons of Jacob think
worthyest of mercy and compassion, because they are Abraham's seed, or because
they being Gentiles, love their Nation, and build them Synagogues. Cerah and
Dathan with their Accomplices, because some of these men descended from Levi, as
Moses and Aaron did, others from Reuben Jacobs eldest son, thought themselves
men as holy and just, at least as capable of Gods Favor and Graces as Moses
was; But Gods judgment of them was far otherwise. And when man has done what
he list, or what he can, God will use his own judgment and not his, in the
disposing of mercy and judgment; for he works all things according to the
counsel of his Will; (Whatsoever the devices of man's heart be) That must stand.
So then, it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God
that shows mercy.

10. What is not of him that wills? what is not of him that runs? Neither
Election, nor Salvation, nor any Spiritual Grace thereto tending. The
Proposition is Universally Negative; neither First Plantation, nor Increase;
neither the Beginning, Middle, or Ending, nor any other part of any Spiritual
blessing is in the Power of Man: All and every Parts is from God alone that
shows mercy.

And so I come to the second Inquiry, The second Inquiry.
To what end or purpose this universal Assertion is referred; The discussion
whereof will justify my interpretation of former Passages: For surely our
Apostle intended no more in the Premises, then is contained in the main
Conclusion, Non est volentis, etc.

Is it then to no purpose, what End the man, as yet unregenerate, Propose to
his Will; whether good or bad? Or after the End proposed, skils it nothing what
choice he make of Means? Or after choice of means, no matter how he prosecute
them, whether carelessly and slothfully, or with diligence and alacrity? See
Chap. 32. and Fol. 3143. 2. Note
Suppose we were to preach to a Congregation of which the most part were not
(for ought discreet Charity could presume) in the State of Grace, nor assured
of their salvation, and yet desirous to use the Means for attaining this
Assurance; should we from this Doctrine tell them? all were one in respect of
their Conversion or Regeneration, whether they confessed one God or no; whether
they swear by His Name in Truth and judgment, or use it rashly, and vainly;
whether they profane the Sabbaths, or religiously observe them; whether they
run to suspicious houses, or repair to the Temple? whether they be willing to
hear a lascivious song or a Sermon; Common talk, or Common Prayers upon
Festival or solemn days? Or does the undoubted truth of this Doctrine, to
wit, [Jacob was elected before he had done good or evill] sufficiently warrant
us to make this Use of it to an unregenerate Audience? Seek ye neither to do
good nor evil till ye be elected; for do ye what ye can, if Gods Will be to
convert you, ye shall be converted at the time appointed; if it be not his Will
to have you converted, do what you can, ye shall never be converted. No
Minister of God that understands himself, but would be more afraid of these
Consequences, then Moses was of his Rod when it was turned into a serpent. And
yet unless these Inferences be true, Every Will, every Purpose and endeavor
of man, is not Excluded by the former Universal Negative from being availeable
as Means ordinarily necessary, but only from being Meritorious Causes of
Regeneration, or Legal Titles to Election. Some Will, and some kind of
endeavors are in their kind as effectual, as others are idle and impertinent,
or demeritorious of Gods Grace to convert us.

11. If we consider (in heart) that the principal and last End of our Apostles
endless Pilgrimages and indefatigable labors in the Gospel, was to gain
multitudes of souls unto Christ; that the means subordinate to this End, was
to encourage all without exception to come, and to show them the way (as he
does in this Epistle) by which they must come, to wit, not by Works, but by
Faith: We shall much wrong St. Paul, and our own souls more, if we apply these
words, It is not of him that wills etc. to any other purpose, or stretch them
further then thus; Every man must sincerely and truly renounce his own will,
that he may unfeignedly submit himself to Gods will: Every man must utterly
revoke his own ways and abandon those courses wherein flesh and blood most
delight, that he may run (as we say) with Might and Maine to Gods mercies, and
freely denying himself, wholly betake himself unto them. Or taking the whole
Proposition, [It is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of
God that shows mercy,] Its all one as if he had said; It is to no purpose
what ye will, or whither ye run, unless ye run unto Gods promses made in
Christ: By proving most excellent in any other course of life, though in the
excellent knowledge of the Law, unless withal ye bend your course unto this
mark which I set before you, you may make your selves such as God has decreed
to harden; for as he shows mercy on whom he will show mercy; So whom he will
he hardens.

12. But does this Conclusion of the Apostle's any way import, that God should
deny mercy to any that unfainedly seek it? It rather implies that he shows
mercy to all such, in abundance. The Principal and most Pertinent Sense of Gods
Words urged by our Apostle, as they respect Mose's Petition concerning himself,
is this; Where I show mercy I will show mercy to the purpose. For when He had
told Moses, that he would proclaim His Name before him, his First Titles are,
The Lord, The Lord God, mercyful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in
goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving transgression,
Iniquity and sin etc. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
etc. Exodus 34. 6. This Sense well fitts our Apostles Instance in Jacob and
Esau; See Geu. 36.
For God was merciful unto Esau; whom he blessed, and made a Father, at least,
of One considerable Nation; but exceeding merciful unto Jacob, because his
purpose was to give the world a manifest proof of his extraordinary Goodness,
in him; as he did of his severitie in hardening Pharaoh, who had made up the
measure of his forefathers iniquity, which God (as in the former place he had
said to Moses) did visit upon him. But of this Instance concerning Pharaoh, and
the similitude which the Apostle borrowes from the Potter, we shall speak, if
God permit, hereafter.

13. See Chap. 42. Numb. 9.
If we put the former verses and the words of this verse together, our Apostle
says neither more nor less in them, then our Savior employed in that speech,
Whosoever he be of you that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my
disciple. And not being his disciple, it is impossible he should find mercy:
Or, professing himself to be his disciple, and not willing to learn this Lesson
of denying himself, (the latter end shall be worse then the beginning; that is)
he shall be hardened.

But shall all that truly forsake themselves be assuredly his disciples, and
find that mercy which God promised unto Moses? Yes: Christ, has promised to
all without exception; There is no man that has left house or brethren, or
sisters, or father, or mother, or wife or children, or lands for my sake and
for the gospels, but he shall receive an hundred fold in this life, and in the
world to come eternal life. Mark 10. 29, 30.

14. But if there be a possibility for All unfainedly to fly unto Gods
mercyes; and if All that fly unto them shall undoubtedly find them, and make
their Election sure; See Chap. 32.
how is not election ex Praevisis operibus, seeing to fly unfainedly to Gods
mercyes, is truly a Work, yea an industrious Work.

Now to make works necessary or ordinarily available to our First Conversion,
may seem a point of Popery, if not a degree of Pelagianism. To this purpose
some sons of our common Mother would interpret My meaning, should I utter this
Doctrine in some publik Audience. This was a Sermon preached in C. C. C. Chapel
in Oxon, 20, or 30. years since.
Howbeit, in truth and verity there is no doctrine under heaven with which my
former Assertion may better stand, then with the Doctrine of the English
Church: No Tenet or Principle of any other Religion whatsoever that can so
directly clear the former Objection, as does the Fundamental Article of that
Religion which is professed by all the Reformed Churches; Do not all these
expressly teach, That men are Justified by belief in Christ without works? Now
let any man rightly answer an Argument usually made by the Papists, and as
commonly denied by every Protestant; and I shall make his Answer as well fit
the former Objection, or any inconvenience that can be pretended against the
former Assertions. The Argument used by our Adversaries, is; [Works of Faith
are true Works: and to believe in Christ is a true work of Faith. Now if we
cannot be Justified but by believing in Christ, it is impossible we should be
Justified Without good works.]

The Answer, to this Captious Syllogism, most used by the Reformed Writers, is,
Fides justificat, non qua Opus, sed Relative. I like their Meaning well; but
their Manner of expressing is not so Artificial as it might be, and therefore
more Obnoxious to Exception. I would answer (as I take it) more appositely to
the same Effect; [To renounce all works and seek salvation only by Plea of
mercy, is the proper and Formal Work of Faith, and therefore is essentially
included in the Act of Justification; not included in the universalitie of
works, which are excluded from justification.]

Did not Priests (as the Proverb is) forget that they had been Clerks: Or
rather could great Clerks in Divinity remember what they had learned when
they were Punie Artists, the former Objection or the like could never have
troubled them; the Form of it (drawn into Mood and Figure) being so childishly
Captious, as would be exploded out of the Schools of Arts, should it be stood
upon in good earnest. If such Divines as urge it most should come into our
Per-vices, and apply it to matters there discussed, thus, Omne visible est
Coloratum.
Omnis color est visibilis. Ergo
Omnis color est coloratus.


I hope a meaner Artist then this Nursery (God be praised) has any, would
quickly cut off their progress with a Distinction of Visibile ut quod, and
visible ut quo; and show that the Major, though universally true of every
Subject or body that may be seen, did not, nor could not comprehend Color it
self by which they are made visible, and by whose Formal Act they are
denominated colorata. The Fallacy of the former Objection drawn into Mood and
Figure, is the same, but more apparent;

Every Will or Work of Man must be utterly renounced from the Act of
Justification or Conversion.

But to deny our selves and renounce all works, is a Work;

Ergo, This work must be excluded from the suit of mercy, as no way available,
Cujus contrarium verum est.

Seeing This is opus quo renunciamus, the Formal Act by which all works must be
renounced: This Work must of Necessity be included in the suite of mercy, and
is always Precedent to every man's first Conversion, whose calling is not
extraordinary. Neither may we that are Ministers of Gods word and Sacraments,
presume to give any man hope of being converted without this work or Act.
Unless we thus distinguish between Works and Renouncing of Works, and grant in
man before his effectual Vocation or Conversion, as true a possibility to do
the One, as want of ability to perform the Other, we shall set the souls of
our hearers in a perpetual Backwater, or cause them to flote Ambiguously as it
were between the main Current of sacred Scriptures and the stream of ancient
Interpreters, both graciously inviting all to Gods mercy; and the fierce
Current of modern opinions which deny all possibility of running (in any sort)
to Gods mercy before Grace infused do draw us. The unseasonable overflow of
Which newly-out-burst doctrine through out our Land, does more mischief to men's
souls, then the summer floods do to their fields. But if we give that Vent or
issue to this Eddye or whirlepool which the former Distinction naturally
implies, we shall let our Auditors or Hearers at liberty to take sea-room
enough: And the breath of Gods spirit plentifully diffused throughout the whole
Current of His Word, will, as a gentlegale, impell them forward unto that
haven, where-unto these present meditations are bound, which only affords safe
harbor unto all that seek to arrive at it, be they never so many.

15. Instead of an exhortation; You my Brethren, that are anointed to preach
Gods mercy to the people, give me leave to propose that counsel which I follow
my self. Seeing the iniquity of the times wherein we live, will not suffer us
to persuade our selves that the most part of those to whom we preach, are in
the state of Grace, Let us make this account, that there is a far greater
necessity laid upon us to teach the means, How men may be brought unto the
state of Grace, then to frame Characters whereby they may know themselves to
be, (what indeed they are not,) Gods Elect Children. It is the chief mystery of
the Ministerial function to set into the work of Conversion aright, and to
impel men those ways, to which each disposition is most inclinable. Now I
know not how it comes to pass, but questionless by the infinite Wisdom and
never sufficiently admired Goodness of our God, that there is no Object of
Belief, of whose truth the unregenerate man can have such strong Historical or
Moral persuasions as of the Points now delivered: No Practice vvhereto they
can with like Facility or hope of surenesse be svvayed or wrought, as unto
Denial of themselves and Desire of his mercy. Do ye demand of me a Reason of
this Assertion? It is Plain and palpable to your own senses: That which
disinables them for performing any Good, and makes them incapable of all other
saving Truths, is, by Divine Providence, made a Natural Ground of these
persuasions;

Their very dullness is as a spur to incite alacrity in these duties. Every
man's Conscience that has any touch of moral honesty, any sense of good or
evil, will thoroughly instruct him, that the more impotent and unable he is to
follow that in practice which his mind approves, the deeper sense he may have
of this his Impotency, and surer arguments of the slavery of his unregenerate
Will. Now it is the infinite mercy of God not to exact more of any, then they
are able to do before their Conversion: that is not to exact any thing of them
that is truly good; or if you will, any thing which does not in its own natured
serve Hell: And yet His Infinite justice requires of all that they sincerely
and heartily, though but Morally, acknowledge and bewail this their natural
Impotencie or want of ability to do any thing that is Good, before they can be
Converted or enabled to do better. The not using of this Natural capacity,
whereby collapsed man only exceeds devils in natural goodness, or rather comes
short of them in natural iniquity, is that which makes all that hear the
Gospel and obey it not, inexcusable. But shall all that use this Capacity
right be assured to have it filled with Grace? Yes: the Spirit has sealed
their Assurance, Isa. 1. 16.
Draw near to to God, and he will draw near to you, Cast down your selves
before the Lord and he will lift you up. Jam. 4. 10.
So then, we have better abilities or opportunities to cast our selves down
then to lift our selves up: And the Lord has a more special hand in lifting
us up, then in casting us down. Our Impotencie to walk uprightly, our natural
pronenesse to all manner of evil, and the weight of our actual sins, do much
help and in a manner impell us (so we would not be wilful) to cast our selves
down before the throne of Grace, by whose power only we must be lifted up,
without any help or endeavor of our own. Herein I must commend the
Anti-Lutherans modesty for not calling St. James his Authority in question,
albeit his Testimony in this Point makes more against him, then it does against
the Lutheran or other Protestants in the Point of Justification: And it is good
wisdom for him so to do, at least it were bootlesse for him to do the contrary,
seeing our Savior has said no less, Come unto me all ye that labor, and are
laden, and I will give you rest. Mat. 11. The greater our labor is, the
heavier our load, Or the more weary we grow under it; the readier we are to run
with better speed to Christ, unto whom the feeble, blind, and lame were most
frequent and most earnest Supplicants. And our coming to him consists not
either in strength or agilitie of body, but in the frequency of Supplications
and depth of groans. It was his saying; They that are whole, need not the
Physician but they that are sick. We must feel our selves sick at the heart,
before this our heavenly Physician will begin his Cure, or use his Skill by
applying the Medicine of saving Grace.

16. Is it then impossible for the unregenerate Man to feel his infirmity, to
be morally persuaded of the Souls immortality, or to be somewhat affrighted
with terror of conscience? or so affected. Is it impossible to implore his
heavenly Physicians help with as great care and diligence as he would an
Earthly Physicians presence to save his Body in a dangerous sickness?

It were rather impossible that any, who is not an absolute Atheist, (such as
it is scarce possible for any man to be) should be so slothful and careless
in coming to Christ as the most part of men are; were they not (through our
sloth or ignorance, or through our factious skill and industry that should
instruct them) led on as it were in a drowsy dream to imagine, that Gods
mercy would either come unto them without seeking, or that it were impossible
for them to do any thing, before it apprehend them, that might infallibly
avail for the finding of it, or rather for being found and embraced by it. The
natural man is not so unnatural to himself, as not to desire ease in true sense
of actual pain; or exemption from danger, which his soul does dread: Nor is he
so Brutish as to think himself not beholding to him that in these Cases is able
and willing to afford him Comfort. It is the Duty and should be the Care of us,
whom that Great heavenly Physician has appointed to visit his Patients, First,
to work a sense and feeling of that natural Infirmity, Pliny. See Chapt. 8.
and Fol. 3145.
whereof the Great Naturalist was (without an Instructor) very sensible.
Secondly to confirm their Belief of this Article; That no present Fee or hope
of praise amongst men, can make any earthly Physician half so ready to cure
their bodies, as he that out of his Free Bounty made their souls, is at all
times to repair them, so they would but Implore his Omnipotent Mercy with as
true and hearty affections, as they do the help of their bodily comforters in
distress.

CHAPT. XLII.
GODS JUST HARDENING OF PHARAOH, when he had filled up the measure of his
iniquity: OR, An Exposition of Romans 9. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he
hardens.

Thou will say then unto me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted
his will? etc.


THe former part of this Proposition here inferred by way of Conclusion, was
avouched before by our Apostle, as an undoubted Maxim ratified by Gods own
voice to Moses. For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy: and I will have compassion, on whom I will have compassion. Exodus 33.
19. The true sense and meaning of which place I have before declared in
unfolding the 16. verse of this Chapter: so that the later part of this
eighteenth verse, [Whom he will he hardeneth] must be the Principal Subject of
my present discourse.

The Antecedent inferring this part of this Conclusion, is Gods Speech to
Pharaoh, Exodus 9. 16. Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I
may show my power in thee, and that my Name may be declared throughout all the
Earth. The Inference is plain; seeing Gods power was to be manifested in
hardening Pharaoh.

2. The Points of Inquiry (whose full discussion will open an easy passage to
the difficulties concerning Reprobation and Election, and bring all the
contentious Controversies concerning the meaning of this Chapter to a brief
perspicuous issue) are especially Four.

1. The Manner how God does harden.

2. The Pertinencie of that Objection [why does he yet find fault? for who has
resisted his will?] and the Validity of the Apostles Answers.

3. The Logical determination of this Proposition, [Whom he will he
hardens:] What is the proper object of Gods Will in hardening.

4. What manner of Division this is, [He will have compassion on whom he will
have compassion; and whom he will he hardens.]

For the right opening of all Four difficulties; the Explication of the single
Terms, with their diverse Acceptions, serves as a Key.

The Terms briefly to be explicated are Three:

1. Gods Will.

2. Irresistible.

3. Induration, or hardening.

The principal Difficulty or Transcendent Question, is, In what sense, Gods
Will, or Induration may be said to be irresistible whom he will he hardens.

3. Gods Will.
Not to trouble you with any curious Distinctions concerning Gods Will: (this
is a string which in most See, Attributes. 1. Part Sect. 2. Chapt 15. and 2.
Part. 2. Sect. Chapt. 18. etc.
meditations we were enforced to touch.) Albeit Gods Will be most truly and
indivisibly One, and in indivisible unity most truly infinite and immutable:
yet is it Immutably free, Omnipotently able to produce plurality as well as
unity, mutabilitie as well as immutabilitie, weakness as well as strength, in
his creatures. By this one, infinite, immutable Will, In what sense, or in
respect of what Objects, Gods Will is said to be Irresistible.
he ordaines that some things shall be Necessary, or that this shall be at
this time and no other. And such particulars he is said by an extrinsecal
denomination from the Object, to will by his Irresistible Will. The meaning is,
the production of the Object so willed, cannot be resisted, be-because it is
Gods Will, that it shall come to pass, notwithstanding any resistance that is
or can be made against it. If any particular so willed, should not come to
pass, his Will might be resisted, being set only on this.

By the same immutable and indivisible Will, he ordained that other Events
should be mutable or Contingent, viz. that of more particulars proposed, this
may be as well as that; the Affirmative as will as the Negative. And of
particulars so willed, no one can be said to be willed by his Irresistible
Will. If the Existence of any one so willed should be necessary, his will
might be resisted; seeing his Will is, that they should not be necessary. Each
Particular of this kind, by the like denomination from the thing willed, he may
be said to will by his Resistible Will. The whole (...) or List of several
possibilities, or the indifference betwixt the particulars, he wills by his
Irresistible Will.

The Psalmist's Oracle (Psalm. 5.) is universally true of all persons in every
age; of Adam specially before his Fall; Non Deus volens iniquitatem tu es: God
does not, he cannot will iniquity. And yet we see the world is full of it. The
Apostles speech again is as universally true; This is the will of God, even
your sanctification, that every one of you should know how to possess his
vessel in honor, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. God wills, and he seriously and earnestly
wills sanctity of life in our selves, uprightness and integrity of
conversation amongst men: and yet behold a Vacuum in this little world, in the
sons of Adam, whom he created after his own image and similitude. So then, he
neither wills men's goodness nor nils their iniquity by his Irresistible will.
He truly willed Adams integrity, but not by his irresistible Will: For so
Adams could not have fallen. What? shall we say then, that God did will Adams
Fall, by his irresistible will? God forbid: For so Adam could not but have
sinned. Where is the mean or middle Station, on which we may build our faith?
The immediate Object of Gods irresistible Will, in this Case, was Adams
Free Will' that is, Potestas labendi, and potestas standi: Power to stand and
power to Fall. By the same Will he decreed Death, as the Inevitable Consequent
of his Fall; and life, as the necessary unpreventable Reward of his
perseverance. Thus much briefly of Gods Will, in what sense it is said to be
resistible or Irresistible.

The nature and property of an hardened heart cannot in fewer words better be
expressed, than by the Poets Character of an unruly stubborn Youth.

Cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus asper. Hor. de Art. It is a constitution
or temper of mind, as plyant as wax, to receive the impressions of the Flesh or
stamp of the Old Man; but as untoward as flint or other ragged stone, to admit
the Image of the New Man.

The first General: The manner how God does harden.
4. The first General.
THe Difficulty is, In what sense God can be truly said to be Author of such a
Temper.] The Proposition is of undoubted truth, whether we consider it as an
Indefinite, [God does harden;] or as a Singular, [God hardened Pharaoh;] or in
the Universality here mentioned, [God hardens whom he will:] The Apostles
meaning is, that, God can harden whom he will, after the same manner he
hardened Pharaoh.

Concerning the manner how God does harden, The Questions are two.

1. Whether he harden Positively, or Privatively only.

2. Whether he harden by his Irresistible Will, or by his Resistible Will only.

To give one and the same Answer to either demand without distinction of times
or persons, were to entangle our selves (as most Writers in this Argument have
done) in the Fallacy, Ad plures Interrogationes.

Touching the First Question, God does not harden all men, or any man at all
times, after the same manner.
some good Writers maintain the universal Negative [God never hardens
positively, but privatively only;] only by substracting, or not granting Grace
or other means of repentance: or by leaving nature to the Bent of its inbred
corruption. Vide Lorinum in verse. 51. cap. 7. Act. Apost. page 322. Colum. 1.
Others, of as good note and greater desert, in Reformed Churches, better refute
this defective Extreme, than they express the Mean between it and the contrary
extreme in excess: with the maintenance whereof they are deeply charged, not
by Papists only, but by their brethren. How often have Calvin and Beza, etc,
been accused by Lutherans, as if they taught, That God did directly harden men's
hearts, by infusion of bad qualities: or, That the production of a reprobate or
impenitent temper were such an immediate or formal Term of his positive action,
as heat is of calefaction, or drought of heat. But if we take Privative and
Positive Induration in this sense, and set them so far asunder; the Division
is altogether imperfect: the former member comes as far short of the Truth, as
the Latter overreacheth it. God sometimes hardens some men neither the one way
nor the other; that is (as we say in Schools) datur medium abnegationis
between them. And perhaps it may be as questionable, whether God at any time
hardens any man mere privative; as it is, whether there can be Peccatum purae
omissionis, any sin of mere Omission, without all mixture of Commission. But
with this question here or elsewhere we are not disposed to meddle; God
sometimes hardens privatively only.
being rather willing to grant what is confessed by all or most, That he
sometimes hardens privative, if not by mere substraction of Grace, or utter
denial of other means of repentance; yet so especially by these means as may
suffice to verify the truth of the Proposition usually received; or to give
the denomination of Privative hardening.

But many times he hardens Positive; not by infusion of bad qualities; God
usually hardens positively; but not by his Irresistible Will.
but by disposing or inclining the Heart to goodness, that is, by communication
of his favors, and exhibition of motives more than ordinary to repentance,
not that he exhibits these with purpose to harden: but rather to mollify and
organize men's hearts for the receiving of Grace. The natural effect or purposed
issue of the Riches of Gods Bounty, is to draw men to repentance. But the very
attempt or sway of means offered, provokes hearts fastened to their sins, The
manner of Gods positive hardening.
to greater stubborness in the Rebound. Hearts thus affected treasure up wrath
against the day of wrath in a proportioned measure to the riches of bounty
offered but not entertained by them. And such a Cause as God is of their
treasuring up of wrath, he is likewise of their hardening; no direct, no
necessary Cause of either: yet a Cause of both, more than privative, a positive
cause by Consequence or Resultance; not necessary, or necessary only ex
Hypothesi. Means of repentance sincerely offered by God, but wilfully rejected
by man, concur as positively to induration of heart, as the heating of water
does to the quick freezing of it, when it is taken off the fire and set in the
cold air. Both these Actions, or rather both these qualities of heat and cold,
have their proper influence into this effect. If a Physician should minister
some physical drink unto his patient, and heap clothes upon him with purpose to
prevent some disease by a kindly sweat; and the Patient thoroughly heated,
wilfully throw them off: both may be said positive causes of the cold, which
would necessarily ensue from both actions; albeit the Patient only were the
true moral Cause, or the only blameworthy Cause of his own death or danger
following. Just according to the importance of this supposition or similitude,
is the cause of hardening, in many cases, to be divided betwixt God and man.

The Israelites did harden their own hearts in the wilderness; and yet their
hearts had not been so hardened, unless the Lord had done so many wonders in
their sight. In every wonder his purpose was to beget Belief: but through
their wilful unbeleife, the best effect of his greatest wonders was induration
and impenitencie. Now as it suits not with the Rules of good manners for
Physicians to tie a man's hands (of discretion or place) lest he may use them to
his own harm: so neither was it consonant to the Rules of eternal equity,
that God should necessitate the Israelites Wills to a true Belief of his
wonders, or mollify their hearts against their will; that is, He neither
hardens nor mollifies their hearts by his Irresistible Will; nor did he at all
will their hardening, but rather mollification.

5. All this is true of Gods ordinary manner of hardening men, or of the first
degrees of hardening any man, But Pharaohs Case is Extraordinary. Pharaoh was
hardened by Gods Irresistible Will.
Beza rightly inferrs against Origin and his followers; that this hardening
whereof the Apostle here speaks, was Irresistible; that the party thus
hardened was incapable of repentance; that God did show signs and wonders in
Egypt, not with purpose to reclaim but to harden Pharaoh, and to drive him
headlong into the snare prepared for him from everlasting. All these Inferences
are plain. First, that Interrogation [Who has resisted his Will?] is
equivalent to the universal negative, No man, no creature can at any time
resist his will. That is, according to the interpretation premised, Whatsoever
particular Gods Will is to have necessary, or so to be, as the Contrary or
Contradictorie to it shall not be; the Existence of it cannot be prevented or
avoided. Now that God did in this peremptory manner will Pharaohs hardening, is
evident from the Emphasis of that message delivered unto him by Moses, (...),
Even for this very purpose, and for no other end in the world possible, have I
raised thee up, that I might show in thee my power: and his power was to be
showed in his hardening. For, from the Tenor of this message, the Apostle
inferres the latter part of this Conclusion in the Text, Whom he will, he
hardneth; yea he so hardneth as it is impossible they should escape it, Whether
Pharaoh were an absolute reprobate, or created to be Hardened
or his judgments due unto it.

In all these collections Beza does not err. Yet was Beza (with reverence be
it spoken) more fowly to blame then this filthy Writer, (for so it pleases him
to entitle Origin) in that he referres these threatenings, [For this very
purpose have I raised thee up, that I may show my power in thee] not only unto
Pharaohs Exaltation to the crown of Egypt, (as I think Origin did, but we need
not, we may not grant) but to his Extraction out of the womb; yea to his first
Creation out of the dust: as if the Almighty had molded him by his
Irresistible Will, in the eternal Idea of Reprobation, before man or Angel had
actual Being: as if the only end of his Being had been to be a Reprobate or
vessel of wrath. Beza's Collections to this purpose (unless they be better
limited, than he has left them) make God, not only a direct and positive
Cause, but the immediate and only Cause of all Pharaohs tyranny; a more
direct and more necessary Cause of his butchering the Israelites infants, than
he was of Adams good actions, during the space of his innocence. For of those,
or of his short continuance in the state of integrity, he was no necessary,
nor immutable Cause; that is, he did not decree that Adams integrity should be
immutable. But whether Gods hardening Pharaoh by his Irresistible Will, can any
way infer, that Pharaoh was an Absolute Reprobate, or born to the end he
might be hardened, we are hereafter to dispute in the third Point. All we have
to say in this place, is this: If as much as Beza earnestly contends for, were
once granted; the Objection following, to which our Apostle vouchsafes a double
answer, had been altogether as unanswerable, as impertinently moved in this
place. Let us then examine the Pertinencie of the Objection, and unfold the
Validity of the Answers.

The second General Point, concerning the Pertinencie of the Objection.
6. Why does he yet find fault? (...);? or Why does he yet chide? with whom
does he find fault? or whom does he chide? See Lib. 7. Chapter 19. Numb. 4, 5, 6.
All that are reprobates? does he only chide them? is this all that they are to
fear? the very worst that can befall them? were this speech to be as far
extended as it is by most Interpreters, no question, but our Apostle would have
intended the force and acrimonie of it a great deal more than he does; thus
far at least: [Why does he punish? why does he plague the reprobates in this
life, and deliver them up to everlasting torments in the life to come; seeing
they do but that which he by his Irresistible Will has appointed?] Or suppose
the Greek (...), might by some unusual Synecdoche (which passes our reading,
observation or understanding) include as much or more than we now express [all
the plagues of this life and all the torments which befall the reprobates in
the life to come:] That the Objection proposed has referrence only to Pharaoh,
or to some few in his Case; not all that perish or are reprobated.
yet it is questioned what [(...)] has here to do? It must be examined whence
it came, and whither it tends. It naturaly designs some definite point or
section of time, and imports particulars before begun and still continued: it
can have no place in the immovable Sphere of eternity, no reference to the
exercise of Gods everlasting wrath against Reprobates in General.

7. These Queries which here naturally offer themselves, (though, for ought
that I know, not discussed by any interpreters) have occasioned me in this
place, to make use of a Rule more useful than usual, for explicating the
difficult places of the New Testament. The Rule is this; [To search out the
passages of the old Testament with their historical Circumstances, unto which
the speeches of our Savior and his Apostles have special Reference or
Allusion.]

Now this Interrogation [(...);] was conceived from our Apostles meditations
upon those expostulations with Pharaoh, Exodus 9. 16. And in very deed for this
cause have I raised thee up, for to show in thee my power, and that my name may
be declared throughout all the Earth, (...); And yet exaltest thou thyself
against my people, or oppressest thou my people, that thou will not let them
go? Chap. 10. verse. 3. (...), he yet chides and threatens him again, how long
will thou refuse to humble thy self before me? Let my people go, that they may
serve me. Else if thou refuse to let my People go, behold to morrow I will
bring the Locusts into thy coasts. That which makes most for this
interpretation, is the historical circumstance of time and manner of Gods
proceeding with Pharaoh. For this expostulation, whereunto our Apostle in this
place has reference, was uttered after the seventh wonder wrought by Moses and
Aaron in the sight of Pharaoh; upon which it is expressly said, that The Lord
hardened the heart of Pharaoh, that he hearkened not unto them. Whereas of the
five going before, it is only said, That Pharaoh hardened his heart, or, his
heart was hardened, or, he set not his heart to the wonders. See Chap. 40.
Numb. 15.
The Spirits Censure likewise of Pharaohs stupiditie, upon the first wonder may
be read impersonally, or be referred to the wonder it self, which might
positively harden his heart in such a sense as is before expressed. Nor is it
to be omitted, that upon the neglect of the seventh wonder, the Lord enlarges
his Commission to Moses and his threats to Pharaoh. Exodus 9. 13, etc. Thus
says the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy
servants, and upon thy people; that thou may know that there is none like me
in all the earth. For now I will stretch out my hand that I may smite thee and
thy people with Pestilence, and thou shall be cut off from the earth: or, as
Junius excellently renders it; I had smitten thee and thy people with
pestilence, when I destroyed your cattle with murrain, and thou had been cut
off from the earth, when the boyles were so rife upon the Magicians: but when
they fell, I made thee to stand; (for so the Hebrew is Verbatim:) to what
purpose? [That I might show my power and declare my name more manifestly
throughout all the earth, by a more remarkable destruction, than at that time
should have befallen thee.]

8. The true Occasion of the former Objection.
This brief survey of these historical Circumstances presents unto us, as in a
Map, the just Occasion, the due force and full extent of the Objection here
intimated (in transitu;) Thou will say then unto me, why does he yet find
fault? As if some one on Pharaohs behalf had replied more expressly thus: God
indeed had just cause to upbraid Pharaoh heretofore, for neglect of his Signs
and wonders: for it was a foul fault in him not to relent, so long as there was
a possibility left for him to relent. But since God has thus openly declared
his Irresistible will to harden him to destruction, (...); Why does he chide
him any longer? Why does he hold on to expostulate more sharply with him than
heretofore, for that which is impossible for him to avoid? For is it possible
for him to open the door of repentance, when God has shut it? or to mollify
his heart, whose hardening was now by Gods decree irrevocable?

I have heard of a Malepert Courtier, who, being rated of his Sovereign Lord
for committing the third murder, after he had been graciously pardoned for
two, made this saucy Reply: One man indeed I killed; and if the Law might have
had its course, that had been all For the death of the second and of the third,
your Highness is to answer God and the Law. Our Apostle being better acquainted
then we are with the forementioned Circumstances of time, and with the manner
of Pharaohs hardening, foresaw the malepert Jew or Hypocrite (especially when
Pharaohs Case came in a manner to be their own) would make this or the like
saucie Answer to God; If Pharaoh, after the time, wherein by the ordinary
course of justice he was to dye, were by Gods special appointment not only
reprived, but suffered to be more out-ragious than before, yea imboldened to
contemn Gods Messengers; the ensuing evils committed by him, and the miseries
which by his stubbornness befall the Egyptians may seem to be more justly
imputed unto God, than unto him; at least, the former expostulation might seem
now altogether unseasonable.

9. The Apostles first Answer to the former Objection explicated.
To this Objection our Apostle opposes a twofold Answer: First, he checks the
sauciness of the Replicant; Nay but O man who art thou (...), [qui Deo
respondes,] says the Vulgar: Beza, (as he thinks) more fully [qui responsas
Deo;] our English better than both, [that replyest against God.] The just and
natural Value of the Original doubly compounded word will best appear from the
circumstances specified, First, God by Moses admonishes Pharaoh to let his
people go: But he refuses. Then God expostulateth with him, As yet exaltest
thou thy self against my people that thou will not them go? The Objection
[(...);] made by the Hypocrite, is as a Rejoinder upon Gods Reply to Pharaoh
for his wonted stubbornness; or as an Answer made on his behalf, or others in
his Case, unto the former Expostulations. For (...) is Respondenti respondere,
to Rejoyn upon a Reply or Answer. Now this Rejoinder (to speak according to the
Rules of modesty and good manners) was too saucie, out of what man's mouth
soever it had proceeded. For what is man in respect of God? any better than an
artificial body in respect of the Artificer that makes it? or then an earthen
vessel in respect of the Potter? Now if we might imagine a base vessel could
speak (as Fables suppose beasts in old time did) and thus expostulate with the
Potter; [ When I was spoiled in the making, why did thou rather reserve me to
such base and ignominious uses, than throw me away; especially when others of
the same lump are fitted for commendable uses?] it would deserve to be
appointed yet to more base or homely uses. For a By-stander that had no skill
in this faculty; for the Potters Boy or Apprentise thus to expostulate on the
Vessels behalf with his father or Master, would argue ignorance and
indiscretion. The Potter at least would take so much authority on him, as to
reply; I will appoint every vessel to what use I think fit; not to such use as
every idle fellow, or malepert Boy would have it appointed.

Now all that our Apostle in this similitude intends, is, that we must
attribute more unto the Creators skill and wisdom in dispensing mercy and
judgment, or in preparing vessels of wrath, and vessels of honor, than we do
unto the Potters judgment in discerning clay, or fitting every part of his
matter to it is right and most commodious use. Yet in all these, The Potter is
judge, says the Author of the Book of Wisdom. Wisdom 15. 7
That very vessel which ministered the matter of this similitude to our Apostle,
Jer. 18. 4. was so marred in the Potters hand, as he was enforced to fashion it
again to another use than it was first intended for. That it marred in the
first making, was the fault of the clay. So to fashion it anew, as neither
stuff, nor former labor should be altogether lost, was the Potters skill. And
shall we think our Apostle did intend any other Inference from this Similitude,
then the Prophet from whom he borrowes it, had made to his hand? O house of
Israel, cannot I do with you, as this Potter, says the Lord? Behold, as the
clay is in the potters hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel, Jer.
18. 6.

10. The true and full Implication is thus much and no more; Albeit God sought
to prepare them to glory, yet had they a possibility or liberty utterly to
spoil themselves in the making. Howbeit, if so they did, he was able to form
them again, to an end quite contrary unto that whereto he first intended them.
So the Prophet explicates himself, verse. 9, 10.

And here we must request our Reader always to remember, that the Apostle
compares God, not to a Phrantick, or Fantastic Potter, delighted to play
tricks to his loss; as to make a vessel scarce worth a great, of that piece,
which with the same ease and cost, might be made worth a shilling; only to show
his Imperial Authority over a piece of clay. He Imagines such a Potter as the
Wise man did, that knows a reason why he makes one vessel of this fashion,
another of that; why he appoints this to a base use, that to a better: albeit
an unskilful By-stander could perhaps discern no difference in the stuff or
matter whereof they are made.

The sum then of our Apostles intended Inference is this; As it is an
unmannerly point for any man to contest, or wrangle with a skillful Artificer
in his own faculty, of whom he should rather desire to learn with submission:
so it is damnable presumption for any creature to dispute with his Creator in
matters of Providence, or of the worlds regiment; or to debate his own case
with him thus; Seeing all of us were made of the same Mass, I might have been
graced as others have been with wealth, with honor, with strength, with
wisdom, unless thou had been more favorable to them then to me. Yet that
which must quell all inclination to such secret murmurings, or presumptuous
debates, is it our steadfast Belief of his Omnipotent Power or absolute Will?
No: but of his infinite Wisdom, Equity and Mercy, by which he disposes all
things, even men's infirmities or greatest crosses to a better end in respect of
them, (so they will patiently submit their wills to his) than they could hope by
any other means to atchieve.

11. In what sense Gods Will is said to be the absoulte infallible Rule of
equity, or justice.
Gods Will to have mercy on some, and to harden others, or howsoever otherwise
to deal with men, is in this sense most absolute [Whatsoever we certainly know
to be willed by him, we must acknowledge without examination, to be truly good.
Whomsoever we assuredly believe it has been his Will to harden, we must
without dispute, believe their hardening to have been most just.] Yet thus to
believe we were not bound, unless it were a Fundamental Point of our Belief,
that this his most absolute Will has just reasons (though unknown to us) why
he hardens some, Vide Coppen in Ps. 36. v. 7. Col. 388. B. C. D.
and shows mercy unto others; yea such Ideal Reasons, as when it shall be his
pleasure to make them known to us, we shall acknowledge them to be infinitely
better, and more agreeable to the immutable Rules of eternal equity (which
indeed they are) than any earthly Prince can give, why he punishes this man,
and rewards that.

The contrary In-consequence, which some would infer out of our Apostle in
this place, is the natural, true, and necessary Consequence of a
misconstruction which they have made of another most Orthodoxal Principle,
[Gods Will is the only Infallible Rule of goodness,] that is, in their
Exposition, Things are good only, See Chapt. 39 Numb. 9. of this tenth Book,
and see Attributes 1. part. Sect. 2. Chap. 13. ^
because God does will them; When as in truth, his Will could not be so
infallible, so inflexible, and so sovereign a Rule of Goodness, (as all must
believe it to be, that think themselves bound to conform their will to his)
unless absolute and immutable goodness were the essential Object of this his
most Holy Will. Wherefore though this Argument be more than Demonstrative; [It
was Gods Will to deal thus and thus with mankind, therefore they are most
justly dealt withall] Yet on the other side, this Inference is as strong and
sound; [Some kind of of dealings are in their own natures so evidently unjust,
that we must believe, it was not Gods Will to deal so with any man living.]
Abraham did not transgress the bounds of modesty in saying to God, That the
righteous should perish with the wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do right? Yet were Gods Will the Rule of goodness in
such a Sense as some conceive it; or our Apostles meaning such in this place as
many have made it; Abraham had been either very ignorant or immodest in
questioning whether Gods Will concerning the destruction of Sodom (lovingly
imparted to him, Genesis 18.) had been right or wrong: whether to have slain the
righteous with the wicked had been unjust, or ill beseeming the great Judge and
Maker of the world.

Howbeit to have slain the righteous with the wicked would have been less
rigorous, less unjust, than to harden men by an inevitable necessitating
decree, before they had voluntarily hardened themselves, or unnecessarily
brought an impenitent temper or necessity of sinning upon themselves. And for
this cause, we may safely say with our father Abraham; Thus to harden any whom
thou have created, that be far from thee, O Lord. Far be it ever from
every good Christians heart to entertain any such conceit of his Creator.

12. The Apostles second Answer to the former Objection.
Albeit this First Answer might suffice to check all such captious Replies, as
hypocrites here make: yet, as our Apostle in his second answer imports; we need
not use the benefit of this General Apology in Pharaohs Case. The reason or
manner of Gods justice and wisdom in hardening and punishing him, is
conspicuous and justifiable by the Principles of equity acknowledged by all.
For Pharaoh and his confederates were vessels of wrath sealed up for
destruction. Hell (as we say) did yawn for them, before God uttered the former
expostulations: perhaps from that very Instant, wherein he first sent Moses
unto him. It being then granted, that God (as we indeed suppose) did from the
plague of murrain, or that other of boiles positively and inevitably harden
Pharaohs heart; and after he had promised to let the Israelites go, infatuated
his brain to wrangle with Moses; First, whether their little ones; afterward,
whether their fl^cks should go along with them: yet to reserve him alive, upon
what condition or terms soever, (though to be hardened, though to be threatened
though to be astonished and affrighted with fresh plagues, and lastly to be
destroyed with a more fearful destruction, than if he had dyed of the
pestilence, when the cattle perished of the murrain) was a true Document of
Gods lenity and patience, no impeachment to his Justice; a gentle Commutation
of due punishment, no rigorous Infiiction of punishment not Justly deserved.

For what if God had thrust him quick into hell in that very moment wherein he
told him, So the Septuagint expresses the sense of the Hebrew Phrase
Ad hoc ipsum excitavi te, For this very Purpose have I reserved thee alive,
that I might show my power in thee? No question but as the torments of that
lake are more grievous than all the plagues which Pharaoh suffered on earth: so
the degrees of his hardening (had he been then cast into it) had been in number
more, (...).
his struggling with God more violent and stubborn, his possibility of
repentance altogether as little as it was after the seventh plague, if not
less. But should GOD therefore have been thought unjust, because he continued
to punish him in hell after possibility of repentance was past? No; Pharaoh had
been the only Cause of his own Woe, by bringing this necessity upon himself, of
opposing God and repining at his judgments without possibility of repentance.
All is one then in respect of Gods Justice, whether Pharaoh having made up the
measure of his iniquity be irrevocably hardened here on earth, or in hell. To
reserve him alive in the state of mortality, after the sentence of death is
past upon him, is no rigor, but lenity and long-suffering; although Gods
plagues be still multiplied on Egypt for his sake, although the end of his life
become more dreadful, than by the ordinary course of Gods Justice it should
have been, if he had dyed in the seventh plague.

13. Another reason why God without impeachment to his justice does still
augment Pharaohs punishment, as if it were now as possible for him to repent,
as once it was, is intimated by our Apostle to be this; that by this lenity
toward Pharaoh, he might show his wrath and declare his power against such
sinners as he was, that all the world might hear and fear, and learn by his
overthrow not to strive against their Maker, nor to dally with his fearful
warnings. Had Pharaoh and his people died of the pestilence or other disease,
when the cattle perished of the murrain, the terror of Gods powerful wrath had
not been so manifest and visible to all the world, as it was in overthrowing
the whole strength of Egypt, which had taken arms and set themselves in
battle against him. Now the more strange the Infatuation, the more fearful
and ignominious the destruction of these vessels of wrath did appear unto the
world; the more brightly did the riches of Gods glory shine to the Israelites,
whom he was now preparing for vessels of mercy; the hearts of whose posterity
he did not so effectually fit or season for the infusion of his sanctifying
Grace, by any secondary means whatsoever, as by the perpetual memory of this
glorious victory over Pharaoh and his mighty host. But this faithless
generation (whose reformation our Apostle so anxiously seeks) did take all
these glorious tokens of Gods extraordinary free love and mercy toward their
Fathers, for irrevocable Earnests or obligements to effect their Absolute
Predestination unto honor and glory, and to prepare the Gentiles to be vessels
of infamy and destruction. Now our Apostles earnest desire and unquenchable
zeal to prevent this dangerous presumption in his Countrymen, enforces him in
stead of applying this second Answer to the point in question, to advertise
them for Conclusion, that the Egyptians Case was now to become theirs; and that
the Gentiles should be made Vessels of mercy and Glory in their stead. All
which the Event has proved most true. For have not the sons of Jacob been
hardened as strangely as Pharaoh was? Have they not been reserved as spectacles
of terror to most nations, after they had deserved to have been utterly cut
off from the earth, yea to have gone quick into hell? Nor have the riches of
Gods mercy toward us Gentiles been more manifested by any other apparent or
visible document, than by scattering of these Jews through those Countries, See
the 1. Book. Chap. 24. and 27, etc.
wherein the seed of the Gospel has been sown.

The third General Point proposed, concerning the Logical determination of this
Proposition [whom he will he hardens:] or, concerning the immediate or proper
Object of the Induration here spoken of.
14. PHaraoh, we grant, was hardened by Gods Absolute Irresistible Will. Could
Beza, can Piscator, or any other Expositor living enforce any more, out of the
literal meaning of these texts? Whether granting thus much, we must grant
withal (what their followers, to my apprehension, demand) that Pharaoh was an
absolute Reprobate from the womb; or, that he was by Gods Irresistible Will
ordained to this hardening, which by Gods Irresistible Will did take possession
of his heart, is the Question to be disputed. They (unless I mistake their
meaning) affirm: I must even to death, deny. Willing I am to put my life in
question with my Opinion; upon condition I may enjoy the ancient privilege of
Priests, to be tried by my Peers, which (God wot) must be no great ones. I
will except against no man, of what profession, place, or condition soever,
either for being my Judge, or of my Jury, so his brains be qualifyed with the
speculative Rules of syllogizing, and his heart seasoned with the doctrine of
the ninth Commandment, which is, Not to bear false witness against his
Neighbor, against his knowledge.

15. To avoid the Sophistical Chinkes of scattered Propositions, wherein Truth
often lies hid, in Rhetorical or popular discourse, we will join issue in this
Syllogism.

Whatsoever God from eternity decrees by his irresistible Will, is absolutely
necessary, and inevitable, or impossible to be avoided.

God from Eternity decreed to harden Pharaoh by his Irresistible Will.

Ergo, The hardening of Pharoh was absolutely necessary, and impossible to be
avoided.

And if his hardening were inevitable, or impossible to be avoided, it will be
taken as granted that he was a Reprobate from the womb; Damnatus antequam
natus, the absolute child of eternal death, before he was made partaker of
mortal life.

The Major Proposition is a Maxim not questioned by any Christian, Jew, or
Mahumetan. A discovery of the Fallacy wherewith Beza and others have in this
argument been deceived.
And out of it we may draw another Major as unquestionable, but more immediate
in respect of the Conclusion proposed; [Whomsoever God decrees to harden by his
Irresistible Will, his hardening is absolutely inevitable, altogether
impossible to be avoided. The Minor, [Pharaoh was hardened by Gods Irresistible
Will] is granted by us, and (as we are persuaded) avouched in Terms Equivalent
by our Apostle. The difference is about the Conclusion or connection of the
Terms; which without better Limitation than is expressed in the Proposition or
Corollarie annexed, is loose and Sophistical.

16. Would some brain which God has blessed with natural perspicacitie, art and
opportunity, vouchsafe to take but a little pains in moulding such fit Cases
for the Praedicates, as Aristotle has done for the Subjects of Propositions,
(though those we often use not, or use amiss) those seeming Syllogismes whose
secret flaws clear sighted judgments can hardly discern by light of arts,
would crack so foully in the framing, that blear eyes would epsy their ruptures
without spectacles. it shall suffice me at this time to show how grossly the
Syllogism proposed fails in one Fundamental Rule of all Affirmative
Syllogismes, The Rule is Quaecunque convenient cum aliquo tertio, inter se
convenient. All other Rules concerning the quantity of propositions, or their
disposition in certain Mood and Figure, serve only to this end, that the
convenience or Indentitie of the Major and Minor with the Medium may be made
apparent. This being made apparent by Rules of Art, the Light of Nature assures
us, that the Connection between the Extremes is true and indissoluble.

Now this Identitie or Unity (for that is the highest and surest degree of
Convenience) is of three sorts; of Essence, of Quality, of Quantity or
proportion, under which is comprehended the Identitie of time. Whatsoever is
truly called one and the same, is so called in one of these respects. And all
these Identities may be either Specifical (or Common;) or Numerical, Mixed or
Single. Most Fallacies arise from substitution of one Identitie for another. As
he that would admit that proposition for true of Specifical Identitie, which is
most true of Numerical, might be cheated by this Syllogism; I cannot ow you the
same sum which I have paid you.
But I have paid you ten pounds in Gold.
Ergo, I do not ow you ten pounds in Gold.


The Negative included in the Major is true of the same Individual or Numerical
sum; but not of the same Specifical. For suppose twenty pounds in gold were
due; the one moytie might be paid, and the other yet owing. But men of common
understanding are not so apt to be deceived in matters of money or commodity
with captious collections of this kind, as unable to give them a punctual
Solution. Every Creditor in his own case would be ready to give this or the
like sufficient practical Answer: I do not demand my ten pounds which are
already paid; but the other ten Pounds which are yet behind: that is (as a
Logician would say) The same sum specie, which has been paid, may yet be
owing; not the same numero: Or, the same sum by Equivalence; not the same
Individual coins.

17. But the Intrusion or admission of one Numerical Identitie for another of
different kind, is not so easily discerned in matters not so distinguishable by
Common sense; especially if the Relative or Antecedent be in ordinary discourse
promiscuously matched with both, and that conjunctim or divisim. The Numerical
Identitie included betwixt the Relative, [Whatsoever and whomsoever, quis,
quicquid, quaecunque etc.] and their Antecedents whether expressed or
understood, is sometimes an Identitie of Essence or Nature only; sometimes of
Quality only, sometimes of Quantity or proportion only: sometimes of
Essence, Quality and Quantity or Proportion: sometimes of Essence and
Quality, but not of Quantity; sometimes of Quality and Quantity, but not of
Essence.

These Rules are universally true, [Wheresoever the Minor proposition is
charged with an Identitie of Quality, Quantity, Time or Essence, wherewith
the Major is not charged:] or, e contra [Wheresoever the Major is charged with
any one or more of these Identities, from which the Minor is free: the
Syllogism, if it be affirmative, must needs be false, and tainted with the
Fallacy of Composition.]

Of the former Rule that Vulgar Example, because best known, is most fit.

Quas heri emisti carnes, easdem hodie comedisti.
At heri emisti carnes crudas.
Ergo, Hodie carnes crudas comedisti.
The Identitie included between the Relative and the Antecedent in the Major
Proposition, is an Identitie of Essence or Substance only. The Minor includes
another Identitie, of Quality, which cannot be admitted in the Conclusion;
because not charged in the Major. Had the Assumption been thus; [At heri emisti
carnes ovillas.] the Conclusion would rightly have followed; Ergo, Carnes
ovillas hodie comedisti; For this is a part of Essential Unity.

The Fallacy is the same backwards and forwards; Quas hodie comedisti carnes,
easdem heri emisti.
At hodie tostas comedisti.
Ergo, Heri tostas emisti.


Examples of Fallacies against the latter Rule are more frequent in most men's
writings, than vulgarly known. This for one.

The same sound which once pleases a judicious Musicians constant ear, will
please it still.

But this present voice or sound, which is now taken up (suppose a young
Quirister were singing) does please his Masters ear.

Ergo, It will please it still, to the very fall.

The Major supposseth an exact Identitie not of Essence or Quality only, but
of Proportion: other wise it is false. For the articulate sound may be
Numerically the same, as being uttered with one and the same continued breath.
The voice likewise may be for its quality, sweet and pleasant: but so weak and
unartificial, that it may relish of flatnesse in the fall; and so loose the
proportion and consonancie which in the beginning or middle it had with a
judicious Musicians care, or internal Harmony.

18. The Object of divine approbation or reprobation is not the individual
abstract humane nature.
The form of this following fallacy is the same;

Whatsoever the eternal and immutable Rule of goodness once approves as just
and good, it always so approves. For in that it is immutable, it is still the
same; and if the Object remain the same, the approbation must needs be the same.

But the eternal and immutable Rule of justice once approved the humane nature,
or the corporeal reasonable creature, as justs and good.

Ergo, It always approves at least the humane nature, or reasonable creature,
as just and good.

The Conclusion is evidently false, albeit we restrain it to the same
Individual humane nature, or reasonable creature which immutable goodness did
actually approve. What is the reason? or where is the fault? in the Connection.
the Major includes an exact Identitie not of Essence or Substance only: but of
Quality, or rather of Consonancie to the immutable Rule of goodness. And
whiles this Identitie of Quality or Consonancie lasts, the Rule of goodness
cannot but approve the nature thus consonant: otherwise it should be mutable in
its judgment, or approbation. The Minor proposition supposes the same
Identitie of quality, or Consonancie; but not the continuance of it. And
therefore the Conclusion is only true of that time, wherein the Identitie of
consonancy remained entire. That is in few words; Though the humane nature
continue still the same; or though Adam were still the same man, The Old Man
and New suppose not two distinct persons. and yet the rewards of joy and pains
everlasting are allotted to them.
yet he was not still one and the same in respect of divine Approbation. For
that supposes an Identitie of quality, of justice and goodness. As these
alter; so it alters.

The Syllogism last mentioned would be unanswerable, were their doctrine not
fallacious or rather altogether false, which would persuade that every Entitie,
Nature, or Creature, qua talis, as such, is good and approveable by the
Creator. Was it then the humane nature? No, but the humane nature so qualified
as he created it, which he approved. And whatsoever other nature is so
qualified as Adams was, when he approved it, has still the same approbation
from the immutable Rule of goodness, which he had: Because the consonancie to
the Divine Will may be the self same in natures numerically distinct.

The Syllogism in which we stated the seeming-endless Controversy, last, has
all the faults which these two last fallacies had, and a great many more. The
Syllogism was this;

Whatsoever God from eternity has decreed by this Irresistible Will, is
inevitable. Or thus;

Whomsoever God from eternity reproves or decrees to harden by his Irresistible
Will, that man's reprobation or induration is inevitable.

But God from eternity reproved Pharaoh and decreed to harden him by his
Irresistible Will.

Ergo, Pharaohs reprobation or induration was inevitable.

The Major supposes an Identitie not of person only, but of quality: yea of
degrees of quality. For as the immediate Object of divine approbation is
justice, consonancie or conformity to the immutable Rule of goodness: so the
immediate Object of Reprobation or induration, is not the abstract Entitie or
nature of man; but the nature mis-qualifyed, that is, unjust or dissonant from
the Rule of Goodness. And according to the degrees of injustice or dissonancie,
are the degrees of divine dislike, of divine Reprobation or induration. The
Minor Proposition includes not only an Identitie of Pharaohs person, but such a
measure of Injustice or dissonancie, as makes him liable to the eternal Decree
of Reprobation and induration by Gods Irresistible Will. But it supposes not
this Identitie of such bad qualities, or this full measure of iniquity to have
been always in him. Without alteration of his person or nature, he was subject
to great variety of qualifications: and each qualification capable of diverse
degrees and different disproportion with the eternal and unchangeable Rule of
goodness. And therefore the Minor Proposition, albeit eternally true, yet is
eternally true only with reference to those points of time, wherein Pharaoh was
so qualified.

No universalitie can infer any more particulars than are contained under it:
and all these it necessarily inferrs. An Universality of time cannot infer
an universalitie of the Subject: nor can an Universality of the Subject
infer an Universality of Time. This Collection is false; God from eternity
foresaw that all men would be sinners. Ergo, He foresaw from Eternity, that
Adam in his Integrity should be a sinner. The Inference in the former
Syllogism is as bad; God decreed to harden Pharaoh from eternity. Ergo, He
decreed to harden him in every moment of his life. Or, Ergo, He was a Reprobate
from his cradle. This Conclusion rightly scanned, includes an Universality of
the Subject, that is, all the several Objects of divine justice, which are
contained in Pharaohs, life, not one particular only. Whereas Pharaoh in the
Minor Proposition, is but one particular or individual Object of induration, or
of the divine Decree concerning it.

19. And thus at length we are arrived at that Point, whence we may descry the
Occasions, Albeit Pharaoh, was always One and the same man: yet he was not
always One and the same Object of the divine Decree.
by which so many Writers of good Note have missed the right stream or Current
of our Apostles discourse, and gravelled themselves and their Auditors upon
By-shelves. All this has been from want of consideration, That albeit Pharaoh
from his birth unto his death, were but one and the same Individual Man; yet
was he not all this while, one and the same individual Object of Gods Decree
concerning mercy and induration. The difference betwixt these we may illustrate
by many parallel resemblances. Suppose that Scepter (whose Pedigree Homer
[Iliad. That Pharaoh in the Syllogism proposed is no singular but an Indefinite
Term.
Lib. 2.] so accurately describes) had in that long succession, lost some part
of his length; this had broken no square nor bred any quarrel, whether it had
been the same Scepter or no. yet if the first and last owners should have sold
or bought Scarlet by this one and the same Scepter; they should have found a
great alteration in the measure. So then, it is one thing to be one and the
self-same Standard; and Another thing to be one and the self-same Staff or
Scepter. The least alteration in length or quantity that can be, does alter
the Identitie of any measure: but not the Identitie of the material substance
of that which is the measure. The same grains of barley which grow this year,
may be kept till seven years hence; But he that should lend gold according to
their weight this year, and receive it according to their weight at the seven
years end, should find great difference in the sums: though the grains be for
number and substance the same, yet their weights are diverse. Or, suppose it be
true which is related of the Great Magore, that he weighs himself every year in
gold, and distributes the sum thereof to the poor; and that he had continued
this custom from the seventh year of his age: yet cannot there be half the
difference betwixt the weight of one and the same Prince in his childhood and
in his full age, (after many hearty prayers to make him fatt) as is between
the different measures of Pharaohs induration within the compass of one year.

Therefore this Argument, [Pharaoh was hardened after the seventh plague by
Gods irresistible Will: Ergo, He was an irrecoverable reprobate from his
childhood] is to a man of understanding more gross, than if we should argue
thus; [The great Magore distributed to the poor five thousand pounds in gold in
his fortieth year: Ergo, He distributed so much every year, since he began this
custom of weighing himself in gold.] For as he distributes unto the poor, not
according to the Identitie of his person, but according to the Identitie or
Diversity of his weight: so does the Immutable Rule of Justice render unto
every man, not according to the Unity of of his Person, but according to the
Diversity of his work. Unto the several measures of one and the same man's
iniquities, several measures of Induration (whether Positive or privative) are
allotted from eternity. But Final induration by Gods irresistible Will, or
irrecoverable Reprobation, is the just recompense of the full measure of
iniquity; or (as the Prophet speaks) To harden thus, Q. Whether he mean, Dan.
9. 24.
is to seal up iniquity to destruction, without hope or possibility of Pardon.

20. These two Propositions are of like eternal truth; [God from eternity
decreed by his irresistible will to harden Pharaoh having made up the full
measure of his iniquity:] and [God from eternity did not decree by his
Irresistible Will, that Pharaoh should make up such a measure of iniquity.]
For, he does not decree iniquity at all, much less full measures of
iniquity. And yet, unless he so decree, not iniquity only, but the full
measure of it; Pharaohs Induration or Reprobation was not absolutely necessary,
in respect of Gods eternal Decree. For It was no more necessary, than was the
full measure of iniquity unto which it was due. And that (as has been said)
was not necessary, because not decreed by Gods Irresistible Will; without
which, Necessity it self has no Title of Being. That the contention concerning
Pharaohs induration has no contradiction for its ground.


From these deductions I may clear a debt, for which I engaged my self, in my
last public meditations. My promise was then, to make it evident, that these
two Propositions, 1. [God from Eternity decreed to harden Pharaoh by his
Irresistible Will;] 2. [God from Eternity did not decree to harden Pharaoh by
his Irresistible Will,] might easily be made good friends, if their Abettors
would cease to urge them beyond their natural dispositions. See Attribut. 1.
part. Chapter 15. Numb. 7.
For in their natures, they are Indefinites not Singulars. Both, in a good
sense, may be made to tell the truth. But a wrangler may work them Both to bear
evidence for error. [God from eternity decreed to harden Pharaoh by his
Irresistible Will.] It Is true of Pharaoh so misqualified as Moses found him
perhaps when he brought the first, at least, when he brought the Seventh
Message to him. But false of Pharaoh in his Infancy, or not laden with such a
measure of Iniquity, as by the Divine Decree was from Eternity Sealed up for
death. [God from eternity did not decree to harden Pharaoh by his Irresistible
Will,] is true of Pharaoh in his infancy or youth: but false of Pharaoh after
his wilful contempt of Gods Summons by signs and wonders.

21. The Conclusion of the Syllogism proposed indefinitely taken, is most true:
but universally taken is altogether false.
Beza's Collection upon this place, is grounded upon the Indefinite Truth of
this Affirmative; [God from eternity decreed to harden Pharaoh.] But he
extends this Indefinite Truth beyond its compass. For he makes it an Universal,
in that he terminates the Irresistible decree to every moment of Pharaoh's
life, without Distinction of Qualification. And it may be, he was of opinion,
that as well each several qualification, as each different measure of Pharaoh's
hardening or impenitency, did come to pass by Gods Irresistible Will. His
Error, into which the greatest Clerk living (especially if he be not an
accurate Philosopher) might easily slide, consists originally in confounding
Eternity with Successive Duration; and not distinguishing Succession it self,
from things durable or Successive. He, and many others in this argument, speak
as if they conceived that the necessary Coexistence of Eternity with Time did
necessarily draw every man's whole course of life, Motu quodam raptus, after
such a manner as Astronomers suppose that the highest Sphere does move the
lower; whereas, if we speak of the course, not of Pharaoh's natural, but moral
life; it was rather an Incondit heap or confused multitude of durables, than
one entire uniforme duration. And each durable has its distinct Reference to
the eternal Decree. That which is eternally true of one, was not at all, much
less eternally, true of another. Eternity it self, though immutable, though
necessarily, though indivisibly co-existent to All, was not so indissolubly
linked with Any, but that Pharaoh might have altered or stayed his course of
life before that moment, wherein the measure of iniquity was accomplished: But
in that moment he became so exorbitant, that the Irresistible Decree of
induration did fasten upon him. His Irregular motions have ever since become
irrevocable; not his Actions only, but his Person, is carried headlong by the
everlasting revolutions of the unchangable decree, into everlasting unavoydable
destruction.

22. The Proposition or Conclusion proposed, [Pharaoh was hardened by Gods
Irresistible Will,] indefinitely taken is true from all eternity, throughout
all eternity; and therefore true from Pharaoh's birth unto his death: but not
therefore true of Pharaoh howsoever qualified, or of all Pharaoh's
Qualifications throughout the whole course of his life. For so the Proposition
becomes an Universal, not only in respect of the Time, but of the Subject;
that is, of all Pharaohs several qualifications. The sense is, as if he had
said, [God from eternity decreed to harden Pharaoh, howsoever qualified, as
well in his Infancy as his full Age, by his Irresistible Will: and thus taken
it is False. The Inference is the same with the forementioned, [Adam in Gods
foreknowledge was a sinner from eternity; Ergo, Adam was always a sinner; a
Sinner before he sinned, during the time of his innocence:] or with this, God
from all eternity did decree by his irresistible Will, that Adam should die
the death; Ergo, He did decree by his irresistible Will, that Adam should dye
as soon as he was created, or be a sinner all his life long.

To reconcile these two Propositions aright, [God from eternity decreed by his
Irresistible Will that Adam should dye,] [God from eternity did not decree by
his Irresistible Will, that Adam should die,] otherwise than we have reconciled
the two former, [God from eternity decreed to harden Pharaoh by his
Irresistible Will;] [God from eternity did not decree to harden Pharaoh by his
Irresistible Will,] no Writer I presume will undertake. The only reconciliation
possible, is this, [God did decree by his Irresistible Will, that Adam sinning
should die:] [God did not decree by his irresistible-Will, that Adam not
sinning should dye.] nor did he decree by his Irresistible Will, that Adam
should sin, that he might die. For (as we said before) God did neither decree
his Fall, nor his perseverance by his Irresistible will. And his death was no
more inevitable than his Fall. Nor was Pharaohs final Induration more
inevitable, than the measure of iniquity to which such Induration was from
eternity awarded by Gods Irresistible will. Of Pharaoh thus considered, the
Conclusion was true from eternity; In what sense the Conclusion proposed may
be said universal, universalitate temporis as to Pharaoh.
true in respect of every moment of Pharaohs life, wherein the measure of his
iniquity was, or might have been accomplished; though it had been accomplished
within three years after his birth. And this accomplishment presupposed, the
Induration was most inevitable, his Final Reprobation as irrecoverable, as Gods
Absolute will (taking absolute as it is opposed to disjunct) is irresistible.

23. In what sense, the Conclusion proposed may be said to be universal,
universalitate subjecti.
The same Proposition, in respect of Reprobation, is universally true
Vniversalitate Subjecti, that is, of every other person so ill qualified as
Pharaoh was, when God did harden him. [VVhosoever shall, at any time, become
such a man as Pharaoh was then, is a Reprobate from eternity by Gods
Irresistible will.] And seeing no man is exempted from his Jurisdiction, he may
harden whom he will, after the same manner that he hardened Pharaoh: although
de facto he does not so harden all the Reprobates; that is, he reserves them
not alive for examples to others, after the ordinary time appointed for their
dissolution. Nor does he tender ordinary means of repentance unto them after
the door of Repentance is shut upon them. God in his infinite wisdom has many
secret purposes incomprehensible to man; as, Why, of such as are equal
offenders, one in this life is more rigorously dealt withal than another.
Why, of such as are equally disposed to goodness Moral, one is called before
another by his irresistible calling. That thus to dispense of mercy and justice
in this life, See his Treatise of the Signs of the Time; the 3. or, moral part
of it.
does argue no Partiality or respect of persons with God, is an argument
elsewhere insisted upon.

24. The Point whereupon we are now to pitch is this Indefinite. [Men usually
are Called, Elected, Reprobated, or hardened by Gods Resistible will, before
they be called, Elected, reprobated, or hardened by his irresistible will.] All
these Terms are Indefinite, and according to their different measures as truly
mutable as Immutable from Eternity; or, as in other See, Chapt. 37. Number. 5. 6.
See 9. Book, Chapter 18. etc.
Meditations we have showed; There is a State of Election under promise, and a
State of Election under Oath, of which the latter only is Absolutely immutable.
The like we may say of Reprobation: it is either under general Threat, or upon
Oath; the Former is mutable, so is not the Latter. No man living shall ever be
able to make his Inference good: [Pharaoh was absolutely reprobated from
eternity, that is, Whether granting that Pharaoh was a reprobate from
eternity, we must grant withal that Pharaoh was a reprobate in his Middle
age, Youth, or Infancy.
His reprobation was immutable from eternity; Ergo, Pharaoh in his Youth or
Infancy was a Reprobate.]

To infer the Consequence proposed, no Medium more probable than this can
possibly be brought; Pharaoh from his Infancy to his full age, was always one
and the self-same Man; Et de eodem impossible est idem affirmari and negari.
The Consequence not withstanding is no better than this following: The last
Eclipse of the Moon was necessary from the beginning; Ergo, The Moon was
necessarily eclipsed in the first quarter, or in the prime; Because the Moon
being of an incorruptible substance, has continued one and the same since the
first Creation. But unto this Consequence every Artist could make reply, that
the proper and immediate subject of the Eclipse is not the Nature or Substance
of the Moon howsoever considered; but in certain opposition to the Sun. So that
albeit this Proposition, [The Moon shall be eclipsed] be true and necessary
from everlasting: yet it is necessary, yet it is true only of the Moon in such
Diametral opposition to the Sun, that the Earth may cover it with her shadow as
with a mantle. Whenever it is in such Opposition, it is necessarily Eclipsed.
Whenever it is not in such opposition to the Sun, it cannot possibly by the
course of nature be Eclipsed

25. It is in like manner true which we have often said, that the proper and
immediate Object of the eternal Decree, concerning Induration or Reprobation,
was not Pharaoh^s Individual Entitie or Essence: but Pharaoh charged with a
certain measure of iniquity, or separation from his God. Granting then that
Pharaoh's Substance from his infancy to his full age was one and the same, as
incorruptible as the Moon: yet the degrees of his declination from the
unchangeable Rule of Justice, or of his opposition to the Fountain of mercy and
goodness, might be more than are the degrees of the Moons aberration or
elongation from the Sun.

Now the Alseeing providence did more accurately calculate each work, each
word, each thought of Pharaoh, and their opposition to his goodness, than
Astronomers can do the motions of the Moon or Plancts. And will he not make his
payment according to his calculation? Tu, Domine, nosti, utrum radix sit
dulcis, an amara, de qua for is pulchra folia Emittuntur: Tu judex interius
melius ipse nosti, and etiam medullas radicum subtilius, perscrutaris, and non
solum intentionem, sed radicis ejus medullam intimam disertissima tuae lucis
veritate colligis, numeras, intueris, and consignas, ut reddas unicuique non
solummodo secundum opera vel intentionem, sed etiam secundum ipsam intertorem
absconditam medullam radicis, de qua procedit intentio operantis. Augustine. in
Soliloqu. Cap. 14. page 14. 2. So that in One and the self-same Pharaoh there
might be more several Objects of the eternal decree, than are minutes or
scruples in forty years motion of the Moon. Not the least varictie or
alteration in his course of life, but had a proportionate Consequent of reward
or punishment allotted to it from all eternity, by the Irresistible Decree.
Unto Pharaoh then having made up the full measure of his iniquity,
Irresistible induration and unrecoverable Reprobation was, by the virtue of
this eternal Decree, altogether necessary and inevitable. But unto Pharaoh,
before this measure of iniquity was made up, neither induration nor
irrecoverable Reprobation was so necessary or inevitable. To think the
unchangeable Rule of Justice should award the same measure of Induration or
Reprobation unto far different measures of iniquity, goes deeper tha^ the
dreggs of Hea^henism: it is a doctrine which may not be vented where any
Christian ear is present.

26. The former Resemblance is fully Parallel to our Resolution in all other
points, save only in this, that the eternal decree did not so necessarily
direct or impell Pharaoh to make up the full measure of his iniquity, as it
does direct and guide the course of the Moon, till it come in full and
Diametral opposition to the Sun. Therefore this Similitude will not follow, As
The Moon, though at this time not Ecl^psed; yet holds that course by the
unchangeable decree, which in time will bring it to be in Diametral opposition
to the Sun and by consequence to be Eclipsed: So though Pharaoh in his infancy
was not reprobated or hardened by Gods Irresistible Will; yet Was he by the
eternal decree ordained to such reprobation or induration, without possibility
of altering his course, or avoiding that opposition which his full age had unto
Divine Goodness.

As every true convert or regenerate person may say with him in Saint Ambrose,
Ego non sum Ego; I am become another man: so might it be truly said, in a
contrary sense, Pharaoh sometimes was not Pharaoh. When he was a child, he
spoke as a child, he thought as a child: His mouth was not not opened against
God: his mind was not set on murder. To have seen the Israelitish infants
strangled or exposed to the merciless floods, would more have affected his
heart, being young and tender, than afterward it did his daughters. Nor was
that cruelty, which in his full age he practiced, so contained in his
infancy, as poison in the serpents egg. It did not grow up by kind or
necessity of his natural temper; much less was it infused by Gods
Irresistible Will: but acquired by Voluntary custom. The seeds of it were sown
by his own self-will: ambitious pride was the root: politic jelousie was the
bud: tyranny and oppression, the fruit. Neither was it necessary by the
eternal decree, that this corrupt seed should be sown: or that being sown, it
should prosper and bud; or that after the budding, it should ripen in
malignitie. During all this progress from bad to worse, the immediate Object of
Gods Immutable and Irresistable Will was mutabilitie in Pharaoh. But this
progress which was not necessary by any eternal decree or law, being de facto
once accomplished, his destruction was inevitable, his induration unresistible,
his reprobation irrecoverable, by the eternal and uncontrollable Decree.

27. That Pharaoh in his youth or infancy was not excluded by Gods
Irresistible Will from possibility of repentance.
That Pharaoh in his youth or infancy was not such an Object of Gods
Irresistible Will for induration, as in his full age he became, may be thus
demonstrated.

No man whose salvation as yet is truly possible, is utterly excluded by Gods
Irresistible Will, from salvation.

But the salvation of Pharaoh in his youth or infancy was truly possible.

Ergo Pharaoh in his Touth or infancy, was not excluded, by Gods Irresistible
Will, from salvation.

Therefore, He was not then the Object of Gods Irresistible Will for Induration.

The Major is evident from the exposition of the Terms. For God is said to
Will that only by his Irresistible Will, which has no possibility to the
contrary. The necessity of it like-wise may be made evident by the Rules of
Conversion; No man's salvation that stands excluded by Gods Irresistible Will
from salvation, is truly possible: Ergo, No man, whiles his salvation is
possible, is utterly excluded, by Gods Irresistible Will, from salvation; or,
which is all one; No man whiles his salvation is possible is either hardened or
reprobated by Gods Irresistible Will: or in Latin more perspicuously thus,
Nullus per Irresistibilem Dei voluntatem a salute exclusus, est servabil^s:
Ergo, Nullus servabilis (idest, quandiu servari potest) est a salute exclusus
per irresistibilem Dei voluntatem. No argument can be of such force or
perspicuitie as is this Primary Rule of Argumentation:

[Negativa universalis simpliciter convertitur.]

The Minor, [Pharaohs Salvation in his Youth or Infancy was truly possible,]
is as evident from another Maxim in Divinity; Quicquid non implicat
Contradictionem, est possibile, sive objectum Divinae potentiae. Now what
contradiction could it implie to save this child, suppose Pharaoh, more than it
did to save another; for example, Moses? Unless we will say, that Pharaoh was
made of another mould, or a creature of another Creator, than Moses or other
children are. To save Pharaoh, as a son of Adam, could imply no
contradiction: for so, no flesh could possibly be saved. If to save Pharaoh
after he had committed many actual sins and follies of youth, did imply any
Contradiction, what man of years (in this age especially) can hope for Pardon?

28. It will be Replied, that albeit to save Pharaoh in his Youth or Infancy
did implie no Contradiction in the Object: and therefore his Salvation was not
absolutely in it self impossible: yet it being supposed, that God from
eternity decreed to harden him and destroy him by his Irresistible Will; it
must needs implie a Contradiction in Gods Decree or Will to save him; and by
Consequent, his Salvation was Impossible ex Hypothesi.

This Answer is like a Medicine which drives the Malady from the outward parts
whereto it is applied unto the heart. It removes the difficulty into a more
dangerous Point. For we may with safety infer, That God did not decree by his
Irresistible Will to exclude Pharaoh in his Youth or Infancy from possibility
of Salvation: because, to have saved Pharaoh in his Youth or infancy was in
itself not impossible, as implying no Contradiction.

For Gods eternal Decree can never prejudice the Eternal Liberty of his
omnipotency. Whatsoever is absolutely possible to God, is always alike possible
to him.
Whatsoever in it self is possible, yea whatsoever is not absolutely
impossible, is absolutely possible to God from eternity: and whatsoever is once
possible unto him, can at no time become less possible to him. The Evangelists
Rule: [Non est impossible apud Deum omne verbum] would fail even in its
proper, and native sense, if that, which is absolutely possible could become
impossible to God, though by interposition of his own Decree.

The most Absolute Monarch on Earth may impoverish his estate, or weaken his
power by his own voluntary Grants: but it is the prerogative of Omnipotency,
that it cannot be prejudiced, or impaired by any decree, or Act, though of its
own making: for always acting it never passes any Act; whence (as elsewhere
is proved at large) it does not, it cannot oblige, or bind it self, being
eternally free, and incapable of any bound or Limit. They that speak or think
of the Eternal Decree (of Reprobation or Election) as of an irrevocable Act
Long since past, not freely concurrent to every action, to every thought of men
throughout their several Successions, No alteration in the Object can make any
thing less possible to God then it was, unless it be such an alteration as
implies some Contradiction in the Object which before was not employed in it.
make Eternity subject to change, and mortality the subject of immutabilitie.

Unless we grant the former proposition [whatsoever is or was absolutely
possible to God, is eternally alike possible to him, not withstanding any
decree, that can be imagined to the contrary;] we must of necessity admit a
change: either in the Omnipotent power, as being less able, since the Date of
this supposed absolute Decree, then before, to produce the self same effect,
viz. the salvation of Pharaoh in his Youth or infancy: Or, in the Object of
his power, and this were Destruere suppositum. For if the object be changed,
another comes in his place, it cease to be what it was, and continues not
the same: if so it did, the possibility of it would be the same in respect of
the unchangeable Power unto which nothing is impossible.

In Bodies natural, so long as the Passive disposition or Capacity continues
the same, the same Effect will necessarily follow; unless the Efficacy or the
Application of the Agent alter. Idem secundum idem, semper natum est producere
idem: He which is always the same without possibility of alteration in
himself, is at all times equally able to do all things that in themselves are
not impossible. And no man, I think, will say that Pharaohs election in his
infancy was in it self more impossible than his own reprobation was. And he
that thinks his own reprobation was in it self impossible, cannot think
himself so much bound to God, as he makes show of, for his infallible Election.

29. If from the former proposition, Whatsoever is absolutely possible to God
is always possible to him, a man should thus assume; To have showed mercy to
Pharaoh was absolutely possible to God, and hence conclude; Ergo, It is
possible to God, to show mercy on him at this Instant: the Illation,
whatsoever the Assertion be, includes the same fallacy of Composition, which
was before discovered in the Syllogism.

Quas emisticarnes, easdem comedisti;
Sed crudas emisti: Ergo, etc.
For Pharaoh, though unto this day, one and the same reasonable soul; yet is he
not one and the same Object of Gods eternal decree for hardening or showing
mercy. To save any man of Gods making, implies no contradiction unto that
Infinite Power by which he was made. To save any man that has not made up the
full measure of his iniquity, implies no contradiction to his Infinite
goodness, no impeachment to his Majesty: it is agreeable to his mercy. To
save such as have made up the full measure of their iniquity, always implies
a contradiction to his immutable Justice. And all such, and (for ought we know)
only such, are the immediate Objects of his eternalabsolute, and irresistible
Will or purpose of Reprobtion. But when the mea^sure of any man's iniquity is
made up, or how far it is made up, is only known to the all-seeing Judge.
This is the secret wherewith flesh and blood may not meddle; as being
essentially annexed to the prerogative of eternal Majesty, belonging only to
the Cognizance of infinite wisdom.

The fourth General Point concerning the Extent or nature of this division, He
will have mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will be hardneth.
AS some do lose the use of their native tongue by long traveling in foreign
Countries: so minds by too much poring on the Rules of Logic, or too much
accustomed to the Logicians Dialect, without which there can be no commerce
with Arts and Sciences, ofttimes forget the Character of ordinary speech, in
matters of civil and common use.

In Arts or Sciences, divisions should be either formal by direct predicamental
line, as that, [Of creatures endued with sense, some have reason, some are
reasonless:] or at least so exact, that the several members of the division
should exhaust the whole, or integrum divided. As if a Geographer should say,
[Of the inhabitants of the earth, some are seated on this side the Line, others
beyond it, This Division is not formal, nor so exact as is required in arts.
or just under it;] the division were good: but very imperfect if he should
say, [Some are seated between the Tropic of Cancer and the Artick circle;
others betwixt the Tropic of Capricorn and the circle Antartick: for a great
many are commodiously seated betwixt the Tropicks, (as experience has taught
later ages to reform the error of the Ancient:) and some likewise betwixt the
Polar circles and the Poles.

But in matters arbitrarie and contingent (as matters of common use for the
most part are) to exact alike formal or accurate divisions, is ridiculous;
especially when as well the members of the division as the dividend it self,
are terms indefinite. As if a man should say, of men, [Some are extraordinarily
good, some extraordinarily bad;] or of Academicks, [some are extraor dinarily
acute, some are extraordinarily dull;] though every one will grant the division
to be indefinitely true, yet no man almost would acknowledge himself to be
contained under either member; as the most part of men are not indeed. Or if
one should say, Every Prince shows extraordinary favor to some of his
subjects, and some others he makes examples (or subjects) of his severitie;
who could hence gather, that no part or not the greatest part were left to the
ordinary course of justice, or to the privileges common to all free denizons?
Now we are here to remember what was premised in the entry into this Treatise;
That albeit Gods Will be most immutable, yet is it immutably free, more free by
much than the Changeable will of man. So are the objects of this his Free Will
more arbitrarie, than the designs of Princes. The Objects of his Will in this
our present argument, are mercy and induration: and these he awards to diverse
persons; or to the same persons, at diverse times, according to a different
measure. Whence, if we take these terms, in that extraordinary measure which
is included in this division, That most men are not comprehended under either
member of this division.
the most part of men, with whom we shall usually have to deal, do not fall
within either member. The proper, perhaps the only subjects of this division it
self in Moses time, were the Israelites and Egyptians: in our Apostles time,
the castaway Jews, and such of the Gentiles as were forthwith to be ingrafted
in their stead. If we take mercy and induration in a lesser measure, according
to their lower degrees or first dispositions, scarce any man living of riper
years but has devolved from the one part of this division unto the other,
oftener then he has eaten, drank, or slept. Christ's Disciples (says Saint
Mark, Chap. 6. v. 52.) had not Considered the miracle of the loaves, because
their hearts were hardened; yet shortly after to be mollifyed, that Gods mercy
and Christ's miracles might find more easy entrance into them. Our habitual
temper is, for the most part, mutable: how much more our actual desires or
operations? And whatsoever is mutably good or mutably evil in respect of its
acts and operations, One and the same man according to the diversity of time
or qualification may be the true and proper subject of both parts of this
division.
(which are sometimes de bono, sometimes de malo objecto) has its alternant
motions from Gods decree of hardening, toward his decree of showing mercy, and
e contra.

31. The doctrine contained in this passage of Scripture will never sound well
for the right settling the affections and consciences of such as be Novices in
faith, until they be taught to run this division upon the same string:

Have thou been enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, made partaker of
the Holy Spirit? Thy sin is great, and thou art found a despiser of the riches
of his bounty, unless thou embrace these illuminations as undoubted pledges of
his favor, and assured testimonies of his good purpose to make thee heir of
eternal life. Worthy thou art to be numbered among those perverse and wayward
Jews whom our Savior compares to children playing in the market, if while
these Good motions and exultations of spirit last, thou give not more
attentive ear (than he that danceth does to him that pipeth or harpeth) unto
that sweet voice of thy heavenly Father encouraging thee in particular as he
did sometimes the host of Israel, Oh that there were such an heart in thee
always, that it might go well with thee for ever.

But eschew these and the like inferences as cunning Sophismes of the great
Tempter, that old and subtle Serpent, I thank God I have felt the good motions
of the Spirit, I perceive the pledges of his good purpose toward me: but his
purpose is unchangeable: Therefore is my Election sure enough, I am a sealed
vessel of mercy, I cannot become a vessel of wrath. If such thoughts have at
any time insinuated into thy heart, or be darted upon thee against thy will;
remember thy self in time, and thus repel them: If God harden whom he will; if
his Will be immutably and eternally free; it is as free for him to harden me as
any other. And consider withal, that albeit thou can not make or prepare thy
self to be a vessel of mercy: yet thy untimely presumption, if it continue
long, in the end will make thee, as in the beginning it does prepare thee, to be
a vessel of wrath. This was the disease whereof the whole Nation of the Jews
did perish.

Do thou see thy Brother, one baptized in the name of Christ, go on
stubbornly in his wicked courses? thou do well to threaten him with the
sentence of death. Yet limit thy speeches by the Prophets Rule, Jerem. 18.
pronounce him not for all this, an absolute Reprobate or irrecoverable vessel
of wrath: give him not forthwith for dead; but rather use double diligence to
prevent his death, and tell him, If God show mercy upon whom he will show
mercy, if this his Will be eternally free: it is as free for him yet to show
mercy upon supposed Castawaies, and to harden uncharitable and presumptuous
Pharisecs (for the present manifestation of his glory) as it was for him to
reject the Jews and chase the Gentiles.

Finally, this Division, though we take Mercy and Induration according to their
Indefinite, or lowest measure, is not more universally true in respect of the
Innumerable Subjects or parties unto whom it may fittly be applied, then it is
in respect of the Time, wherein it may be applied to any determinate Individual
Subject, which has not made as yet, either the Full Measure of his iniquity
up to the brim; or his Election immutably sure. Of all and every Person and
Subject not thus qualifyed, it is universally true; He has mercy on whom he
will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth. In respect of every particular
and determinate person not thus qualifyed it is universally true; He has mercy
when he will have mercy, and when he will be hardens. And he hardens at no
time sooner then when men (what men soever) are most confidently presumptuous
of his mercy, That this doctrine delivered is no way prejudicial to the
certainty of salvation; but rather directs us how to make our Election sure.
or untimely secure of their perseverance in faith or continuance in his favor.

32. Perhaps the ingenuous, and hitherto indifferent Reader, will here begin to
distaste these last Admonitions, and for their sakes, most of our Resolutions,
as prejudicial to a commonly received doctrine concerning the Certainty of
Salvation. And I must confess that upon first sight they may seem suspicious,
in that they suppose our Election to be not only uncertain in respect of our
apprehensions, but mutable in its nature. But if it please him either to look
back into some passages of the former discourse, or to go along with me alittle
further; I shall acquaint him (though not with a surer foundation yet) with a
stronger frame or structure of his hopes, than he shall ever attain unto by
following their Rules, who, I verily think, were fully assured of their own
salvation, but from other grounds than they have discovered to us.

Surer foundation can no man lay, than that whereon both parties do build, to
wit, the absolute immutabilite of Gods decree or purpose. Now admitting our
apprehensions of his Will or purpose to call, elect or save us, were
infallible: yet he that from these foundations would rear up the Edifice of his
faith, after this hasty manner, [Gods purpose to call, elect and save me, is
immutable; Ergo, my present calling is effectual, my election already sure,
and my salvation most immutable,] becomes as vain in his imaginations, as if he
expected that walls of loom, and rafters of reed covered with fern, should be
able to keep out Gunshot, because seated upon an impregnable Rock.

For first, who can be longer ignorant of this truth, than it shall please him
to consider it? That Gods purpose and Will is most immutable in respect of
every object possible: that mutabilitie it self, all the changes and chances of
this mortal life, and the immutable state of immortality in the life to come,
are a-like immutably decreed by the eternal counsel of his immutable Will. Now
if mortality and mutabilitie have precedence of immortality, in respect of
the same persons, by the immutable Tenor of his irresistible decree: can it
seem any Paradox to say? [That man's Estate whether of Election or Reprobation
is even in this life usually mutable, before it come to be Immutable, and that
by virtue of the same inalterable decree. Or, That ordinarily there should be
in every one of us as true a possibility of living after the flesh, as of
living after the spirit: before we become so actually and completely spiritual,
as utterly to mortify all lusts and concupiscences of the flesh.] Until
(then) our mortification be complete and full, we may not presume all
possibility of living after the flesh to be finally expired and utterly
extinct in our souls. And whether this possibility can be in this life
altogether so little, or truly none, as it shall be in the life to come, after
our mortal hopes are ratified by the sentence of the almighty Judge, I cannot
affirm, if any man peremptorily will deny it; nor will I contend by way of
peremptory denial, if it shall please any man upon probable reasons to affirm
it.

33. But if to such as finally perish, no true or real possibility of
repentance during the whole course of this mortal life, be allotted by the
everlasting irresistible decree; in what true sense can God be said to allow
them a time of repentance? How does our Apostle say, that the bountifulness of
God does lead or draw them to repentance, if the door of repentance be
perpetually mured up against them by his Irresistible will?

If in such as are saved, there never were from their birth or Baptism any true
or real possibility of running the ways of death; the fear of Hell, or the
declaration of Gods just judgments (if at any time they truly fear them) is
but a vain imagination, or groundless Fancy, without any true cause or real
occasion presented to them by the immutable decree. Or if by his providence,
they be at any time brought to fear hell, or the sentence of everlasting death:
yet has God used these but as bug-beares in respect of them, though truly
terrible to others. And Bug-heares, when children grow once so wise as to
discern them from true terrors, do serve their parents to very small purpose.

For mine own part, albeit I fear not the state of absolute reprobation, yet so
conscious am I to mine own infirmities, that I would not for all the hopes, or
any joy, or pleasure which this life can afford, abandon all use of the fear of
hell, or torments of the life to come. But whatsoever the Tenor of my estate in
mine own apprehension heretofore has been, for the present is, or hereafter
may be, I am (and I think shall so continue) absolutely persuaded, that the
absolute impossibility, whether of Apostasy from Faith professed, or of
becomeing true and Steadfast professors, is the usual Successor, as heir by
Conquest, of mixed possibility of becoming as well vessels of wrath, as vessels
of mercy; and e contra.

34. Upon this real possibility of becoming vessels of wrath, does our
Apostle ground those admonitions, Hebr. 3. 12. 13. Take heed brethren, lest
there be in any of you an evil heart of unbeleif, indeparting from the living
God: But exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any of you
be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. And again, Chapt. 4. v. 1. Let
us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his Rest, any
of you should seem to come short of it. These and the like admonitions frequent
in the Prophets and the Gospel, suppose the men whom they admonish, to be as
yet not absolutely reprobated, but in a mutable state; or in a state subject to
a mutual possibility of becoming vessels of wrath, or vessels of mercy; and
by Consequence, not altogether incapable of that height of impiety unto which
only the eternal and immutable decree has allotted absolute impossibility of
repentance, or of salvation.

Upon the true and real possibility of becoming vessels of mercy supposed to
be awarded by the eternal and Irresistible decree to all partakers of the word
and Sacraments, does S. Peter ground that exhortation, Brethren, give diligence
to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall
never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in to the
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: 2 Peter, 1. 10, 11.
The end of this exhortation was to bring his Auditors unto that full growth in
grace and good works in this life, unto which absolute impossibility of
Apostasy is as irresistibly assigned, by the eternal and immutable decree, as
final induration or impossibility of repentance is unto the full measure of
iniquity.

35. In what proportion these two contrary possibilities may be mixed in all or
most men, before they arrive at the point of absolute impossibility either of
Apostasy or of repentance; we leave it to every man's private conscience to
guess or examine grosso modo, and to infinite and and eternal wisdom exactly
and absolutely to determine. Unto whose examination we likewise in fear and
Reverence refer it, whether the impossibility of repentance be absolute or
equal in all that perish; or the impossibility of Apostasy be absolute and
equal in all that are saved, at one time or other before they depart hence: or
whether the mutual possibilities of becoming vessels of mercy or vessels of
wrath, may not, in some degree or other, continue their combination in some men
until the very last act or exercise of mortal life.

But unto one and the same man until he come to one of these two full points
or periods, God always speaks, (whether by his word preached or otherwise by
his peculiar providence) as unto two: because every such man has somewhat of
the flesh, and somewhat of the spirit. For men as they are the sons of Adam
are carnal; and Gods words are all spiritual, and always leave some print or
touch behind them, whereby the soul, in some degree or other, is presently
either hardened, or presently mollified; or at least disposed to mollification
or induration. Continual or frequent calcitration against the edge of this
fiery sword breeds a Callum or complete hardness; or (as the Apostle speaks)
it seares the conscience. But where it enters, it causes the heart to melt,
and makes way for abundant mercy to follow after.

36. Men as yet not come to a fullness either of iniquity, or of growth of
Faith, are but children in Christ: and God speaks to his children, while they
are children, as wise and loving parents do to theirs. Now if a kind loving
father should say to one of his sons, whom he had often taken playing the
wag, Thou shall never have penny of what is mine; and to another whom he
observed to follow his book or other good exercises well pleasing to him, Thou
shall be mine heir: a man of discretion would not construe his words (though
affectionately uttered) in such a strict sense, as Lawyers would do the like
Clauses of his last Will and Testament; but rather interpret his meaning thus;
that both continuing in their contrary courses, the one should be disinherited,
and the other made heir. Though God by an Angel or voice from heaven should
speak to one man at his devotions, Thou shall be saved; and to another at the
same time blaspheming, Thou shall be damned: his speeches to the one were to be
taken as a good encouragement to go forward in his service; his speeches to the
other, as a fair warning to desist from evil: and not as ratifications of
immutabilitie in either course, not as irrevocable sentences of salvation or
damnation in respect of their individual persons, but in respect of their
present qualifications in whomsoever constantly continued. Saul the Persecutor
was a reprobate, or vessel of wrath: but Paul the Apostle, a Saint of God, a
chosen vessel. It is universally true; The seed of Abraham or Israel was Gods
people: and yet it is true, that the Jews (though the seed of Abraham and
sons of Israel) were not partakers of the promise made to Abraham. For they
became those Idumaeans, those Philistines, and those Egyptians, against whom
Gods Prophets had so often threatened his judgments, whom they themselves had
excluded from Gods temple. One principal cause of their miscarriage was their
ignorance of the Prophetical language, whose threats or promises are always
immediately terminated, not to men's persons, but to their qualifications. In
their Dialect, only true Confessors are truly Jews; every hypocrite or
backeslider is a Gentile, an Idumaean, a Philistine. None to whom God has
spoken by his prophets, were by birth such obdurate Philistines, as had no
possibility of becoming Israelites or true Confessors. The children of Israel
were not by nature so Undegenerate sons of Abraham as to be without all
possibility of becoming Amorites.

37. The true scantling of our Apostles up-shot, [He will have mercy upon whom
he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth,] rightly taken, reaches
exactly to these points following, and no farther.

First, to admonish these Jews by Gods judgments on Pharaoh, not to strive
with their Maker, not to neglecte the warnings of their peace, upon presumption
that they were vessels of mercy by inheritance: seeing they could not pretend
any privilege able to exempt them from Gods general jurisdiction of hardening
whom he would, (as well of the sons of Abraham, as of the Egyptians,) or of
diverting those beams of glory which had shined on them, upon some other
nation.

It, secondly, reaches to us Gentiles, and forewarnes all and every one of us,
by Gods fearful judgments upon these Jews, not to tie the immutabilitie of
His Decree for Election unto any hereditarie, amiable, national disposition,
much less unto the Individual entities of our persons, as if it were like a
chain of Adamant to draw us out of the womb into the grave out of the grave
into Paradise. Our Apostle makes a quite contrary Use of this Doctrine; his
division of hardening and showing mercy holds true (as has been declared) in
one and the same person; and every one of us, for this reason, is bound always
to fasten one eye as steadfastly upon Gods severitie toward the Jew, as we do
the other upon the riches of his glory and mercy toward our selves. For if he
spared not the natural branches, let us take heed left he also spare not us,
who have been hitherto the Flower and Bud of the Gentiles. Behold therefore the
goodness and severitie of God: on them which fell, severitie; but toward thee,
goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shall be cut
off. And they also, if they bide not still in unbeleife, shall be grafted in:
for God is able to graft them in again. The one aspect breeds fear, the
other brings forth hope: and in the right counterpoise of hope and fear
consists that uprightness of mind and equabilitie of affections, without which
no man can direct his course aright unto the Land of promise. This
manifestation of Gods mercy to one people or other, after a kind of equivalent
vicissitude perpetuated from the like revolution of his severitie toward
others, was the object of that profoundly divine contemplation, out of which
our Apostle awaking, as out of a pleasant sleep, cries out, O the depth of the
riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his
judgments, and his ways past finding out? Romans 11. 33.

38. He that desires to have his heart filled with such a measure of joyful
admiration as will seek a vent in these or the like unaffected serious
exclamations, must feed his thoughts with contemplation of divine attributes;
specially with those of infinite duration or eternity, of infinite wisdom, of
infinite goodness and love to man. In all which I have adventured to tread a
path for others to correct or follow upon trial; being assured of this, that
without the knowledge of these generalities, nothing can be said to any purpose
in the particulars thus far prosecuted, or in the like to be prosecuted more
at large, when God shall grant leisure and opportunity.

39. These present disquisitions (though seeming curious, as the resolution is
truly difficult) have a vulgar and immediate use; yet not so vulgarly plain or
common to all, as profitable to every particular Christian not fully persuaded
of the certainty of his salvation.

The special aim of my meditations in this argument is, first, to deter my
self and others from all evil ways whatsoever; but especially from those
peculiar and more dangerous sins, which make up the full measure of iniquity
with greatest speed: Secondly, to encourage mine own soul and others with it,
to accomplish those courses unto which the immutabilitie or absolute certainty
of election it self (which must in order of nature and time go before our
infallible apprehensions of it) is inevitably predestined by the eternal and
irresistible decree.

These exhortations are more fit for popular sermons, than such points as
hitherto have been discussed: whose discussion nevertheless has seemed unto
me very expedient, as well for warranting the particular uses which I purpose
(if God permit) to make out of the chapters following, as for giving such
satisfaction to my best friends as God has enabled me to give my self,
concerning the Apostles intent and meaning in this ninth chapter.

40. If what I have said shall happen to fall into any man's hands, which has a
logical head, and bears a friendly heart to truth (though otherwise no friend
to me: yet) I presume he will not be so uncharitable toward me, as to suspect
that I have intended these premises to infer any such distastful conclusions
as these; That Election should be ex fide aut operibus praevisis, for our faith
or works sakes; That any man should be more than merely passive in his first
conversion; That the working of saving grace might be resisted; or lastly, That
in man before his conversion, there should be any spark of free will remaining,
save only to do evil. Whosoever will grant me these two Propositions, That the
unregenerate man has a true freedom of will in doing evil,] and [The eternal
Creator a freedom of will in doing good:] I will engage my self to give him
full satisfaction, that no difference betwixt Reformed Churches concerning
Praedestination or Reprobation, is more then verbal, or has any other
foundation besides the ambiguitie of unexplicated terms. The errors on all
sides grow only from pardonable mistakings, not so much of truth it self, as of
her proper seat or place of residence.

C. Reader,
THis last Discourse was published without the Authors consent or knowledge; as
he says, Book 9. Chap. 12. margin. He that will compare, shall find very
considerable meliorations in This now printed after an exact Copy: which also
had a solemn Dedication prefixed. I feared these late Revolutions might have
made the ritual publishing it prejudicial to the H persons. Therefore have I
placed it here, as in the Dark behind a Curtain; where the Reader may have the
same benefit, Though the Authors Friends have not either the honor intended,
or the accidental prejudice.

To the Two Noble Gentlemen, his much honored Friends: Mr. R. S. and Mr. E. S.
sons to the R. H. L. S. The Blessings of this Life, and of the Life to come
be multiplied.
Noble Sirs,
THere is no Argument in Divinity, wherein every Soul that earnestly seeks
Salvation (or the avoidance of damnation,) ought in reason, to be more desirous
of satisfaction, than in the point of of Eternal Election, and Reprobation. Nor
are Scholastic disputes concerning these Points in themselves so dangerous, as
they are made by such as are more apt to abett Contentions set on foot, than
able rightly to examine, whence the quarrel first began, upon what terms it
stands, or how it may fitly be composed. In searching out the true sense and
meaning of whatsoever it has pleased God to reveal, there can be no offense:
in the manner of the search we often offend. Diligence and accurate pains are
always commendable, as in every other Subject, so in this, wherein Curiosity
is only dangerous: Howbeit wheresoever Curiosity of search is dangerous,
peremptory Resolutions (whether negative or affirmative) must needs be
pernicious, seeing suspension of Assent in difficult or controversed Cases, is
a property no less Essential to true Faith, than firm adherence to divine
truth known and acknowledged. And if the blame were bestowed, in that
proportion it has been deserved, amongst the several Commentators upon the
Scriptures prefixed to these discussions: the heaviest burden would lie, not
upon such as make new Queries, but upon such as have taken upon them to give
absolute Determinations without accurate search of the Apostles meaning:
preposterously seeking to comprehend what they should admire, and endeavoring
to stir up affected admiration of that which every Novice might fully
comprehend, were their Resolutions in this Argument as Orthodoxal, as they are
peremptory.

The end of these present Queries is to find out a middle way how to maintain
some principal Conclusions of Reformed Churches (specially concerning the
Servitude of man's Will; the Nullitie of merits or of Works foreseen, and the
Irresistible efficacy of saving Grace:) without association of those Rigid
Premises which latter ages have invented for their maintenance, as Astronomers
of old did Epicycles, and Copernicus of late the motion of the Earth for
salving their Celestial Phenomenon. To pick quarrels with Antecedents of good
use, whereas the fault lies only in the Inference, is a fault too common to
Controversie-writers in every age. And thus to spite an erroneous Conclusion,
the foundations of many useful truths are often overthrown, and new false
Principles brought in their place, which will bring forth dangerous errors by
faultlesse Consequences.

I have often been enforced to season my retired thoughts with sighs or tears,
whiles I beheld the factious oppositions of foreign Reformed Churches abetted,
animated, and propagated by men whom God had placed as Bystanders or unpartial
Vmpires; and blessed with all opportunities of making peace amongst others, so
they themselves had been the sons of peace. The parties here meant were English
Divines, men freed by Gods especial providence from all vicinitie of public
adversary or such politic provocations as their foreign brethren were often
misled with. Some, or rather a great many, of no mean note have held it as a
matter of conscience, and affected it as a choice fruit of zeal, to press
those Rigid Opinions upon their Auditors which the first Authors of them would
never have conceived or quickly would have abandoned if they could with safe
conscience have subscribed unto the English Leitourgie. And in very truth this
peculiar Symptom of the crazed and ill-tempered Presbytery (I mean zealous
adherents to Rigid Tenants of Reprobation) has been been an especial motive to
withdraw many hands and pens from subscription to our Common Prayer Book or
book of Homilies. It was a subject of much sadder contemplation to see (as who
sees not that has not resolved to wink at the soloecisms of his good friends?)
many Divines, well fitted and engaged for better employments, become anxious
sollicitors for the admission or rather intrusion of that very error into
Reformed Churches, whose extirpation in the Synogogue, the prevention of whose
propogation throughout the Churches of the Gentiles by him planted, was a great
part of his labors who in sacred labors, was more plentiful than any, than
all his fellow Apostles.

The attempt for this intrusion found no such furtherance from the pretended
Title of Ancient Orthodoxal Truth as from present opposition to modern errors;
As if the parties of whom I speak, had held it an Aphorism of sacred Policy,
to entertain any Heathenish, Jewish or Turkish Fugitives, able to do service
against the Lutheran. That sundry Writers of greater note and name than here
to be named by me, have (out of opposition to the Lutheran) given more
suspicion of concurrence with the Stoic, the Modern Turk, or Jews that lived
in our Apostles time, than the Lutheran does of any concurrence with the Papist
or other Heretic whatsoever: I shall be able to inform him that will friendly
and privately debate this seeming Paradox with me, whether by writing or by
word of mouth. But, as the world now is set, openly and publicly to confront a
countenanced error, would breed greater dissension between brethren in
profession and affection, then the unseasonable publication of truth,
(specially by so mean a messenger of truth as my self) could recompense:

Dum furor in cursu est currenti cede furori. It is one thing to give the way
unto such fierce oppositions as daily meet us, and another to be carried
headlong with them or to sollow them, as their Patrons too often follow Princes
Courts, that is, as we say, afar off.

Whilst I was an Artist I liked the Old Prescript well [ Loquendum cum multis,
Philosophandum cum paucis.] The medicine a little corrected, is not much amiss
in Divinity. [ Theologizandum cum paucis, non loquendum contra multos] unless
it be unto some few, and those no parts of the multitude or Vulgar sort, either
for judgment or affection. Amongst my choicest acquaintance and most respected
friends, I had no choice left, in Competition with your selves, to whom in all
congruitie, I rather ought, or more safely might communicate, what I conceive
of this or other like points of Divinity more necessary to be enquired into by
such as are intelligently ingenious, than expedient to be published or
communicated without distinction of Times and Persons. For of my choicest
meditations heretofore, either published or privately perused, I have ever
liked the impression much better, whilst I looked upon it in your disposition
and conversation, than whilst I read it in mine own papers, or from the Press.
Vos estis Epistola mea: of all my labors in the Ministry I have reapt no
comfort like to this: That it has pleased God to use me sometimes as a Waterer
of those precious seeds unto which he himself has given plentiful increase:
and to withold any thing, that my conscience tells me may yield wholesome
nourishment, (though but rudely and homely dressed (as this small Present is)
unto those sacred Plants which the right hand of our heavenly Father has
planted in your breasts, were to robb my self of my chiefest joy. Thus I have
adventured in a Case (as it is commonly apprehended) of great danger to be your
Taster, being more willing (as I know you are persuaded of me) to drink the
deadliest bodily poison that could be ministered unto me, than willingly to
infect your souls with any poisonous doctrine. Howbeit I profer not these brief
Receipts as Mountebanks do their druggs, or Tradesmen their waves upon Oath or
confident Asseverations, but rather referr them to the farther trial of your
less partial more judicious taste, faithfully promising on my part all readiness
to recall, amend, or alter, whatsoever upon better examination shall be found
amiss; whether in the Matter, the Method or Manner of speech.

And upon these Terms I interest you by these presents in other Treatises of
this Argument, all which I have purposely consecrated as a Memorial Pledge of
those Kind References which heretofore have been betwixt us, of that respect
which I will ever bear unto your persons; and of the honor due (from me
especially) to your virtues. VALETE.

SECT. VII.
A Treatise concerning the Acts or Exercises of the SON of GOD his everlasting
Priesthood.
OR, Containing the Manner or Means by which the Son of God, through the
continual Exercise of his everlasting Priesthood in his heavenly Sanctuary,
does now De Facto, set Free indeed, all such as seek for the working out of
their own Salvation with fear and Trembling.
CHAP. XLIII.
1. THe Manner how the Sons of Adam are set Free by the Son of God, has
been in part heretofore, or rather the First part of this Freedom has been
declared at large in the Eighth Book of these Commentaries, Sect. 2. Chapt. 6.
etc. Amongst other Qualifications of the Son of God incarnate for destroying
the works of the Devil, it was a Special One, That he should take upon him the
Form of a Servant, to the End he might without any wrong to His Person, or any
injustice done upon his Humane Nature by God the Father, Dye the death of a
Servant, that is, the Death of the Cross, and by such death and sufferings pay
the full Ransom of all Mankinds Redemption, and set us all Free de jure. The
main business yet remaining to be discussed is [ Concerning the Manner, the
several Ways or Means by which he does de Facto set Free indeed (that is,
Perfectly;) All such as seek to work out, or rather industriously labor for
the working of their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.] That is, (I take
it) with such Fervent Prayers and Supplications to God the Father through Him
and by Him, as He tendered for Himself in his Agony, or in the days of his
Consecration to that Everlasting Priesthood which he now exercises in the
Heavenly Sanctuary, where he now sits at the right hand of God the Father:

2. With the Manner of Christ's sitting at the Right hand of the Throne of of
Majesty I am resolved not to meddle in this Book; See the ninth Book, Sect. 6.
Chap. 39.
the Manner of his sitting there being no Article of our Faith, nor any of the
most useful Appertenances (as I conceive it) to that Grand Mystery of his
exaltation as Man above all Powers and Principalities. St. Austins answer unto
Dardanus who (as far as my reading serves me) first moved that Curious
Question which of late has much troubled the Church; [Whether Christ's sitting
at the Right hand of God the Father include any VBIQVITARIE PRESENCE of his
Humanitie] does very well satisfy me, and I entreat the Ingenuous Reader, it
may (for this time) suffice him: till it please God that he see more. In the
11. Book, not yet printed.


The Sum of this Reverend Fathers Answer is, That the Session of Jesus Christ
the Son of God at the Right hand of the Throne of Majesty is to be extended
neither further nor shorter then to the place, or heavenly places, whence he
shall come to judge the Quick and the Dead. From much better Authority then
St. Austin's, or any Visible Church Representative here on Earth, either in, or
since his time, we are taught and enjoined to believe, That the Son of God by
whom the world was made, sits now in Our Nature at the right hand of the
Almighty Creator, and that this his Seat, is in the Heavenly Sanctuaries which
are not made with hands, (as the first Tabernacle in the wilderness, and as
the Temple at Jerusalem were;) that He sitts there as the High Priest of our
Souls continually exercising his Function for accomplishing the Redemption or
Freedom of all such as are Capable of it; giving all men a Competent Time, (the
definite extent whereof is only known to God and to himself) for their
Repentance and Conversion unto him. Only thus much we know indefinitely, that
there he shall Sit as our High Priest until the Enemies of his Gospel and
despisers of his Priesthood be made his Footstool* that is, until the
Iniquity of the retchless part of Mankind, and the number of such as are
Predestined unto Eternal life be accomplished. This Glass being run, he
will appear as King to give Royal Sentence upon all such as shall be alive at
his coming, or have been dead before, and render to every man according to his
Works. Thus much we may learn from our Apostle in the eighth and ninth Chapters
of that Divine Epistle to the Hebrews, which I have proposed as my Guide or
Mapp for my safe Conduct through this Treatise Concerning the Power and
continual Exercise of Christ's Priesthood in his heavenly Sanctuary.

CHAP. XLIV.
The Coherence of the eighth Chapter to the Hebrews, with the seven preceding,
and two following.
The Exact Proportions or Parallels, Betwixt the Mundane Tabernacle with the
two Sanctuaries therein, and the Celestial with those in it; betwixt the
Manner or Rites in the Consecration of the One and the other: Betwixt the High
Priests of the Old Testament, and Christ our only High Priest of the New:
intimated in This, explicated in the following Chapters.
HEBR. CHAP. VIII. Verse 1. Now of the things which we have spoken this is the
Sum, we have such an High Priest who is set on the Right hand of the throne
of Majesty in the Heavens.

Verse 2. A minister of the Sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord
pitched, and not Man.


1. THese words have a double Reference; The One, unto that which he had said
in the seven Chapters Precedent; The Other, unto some Passages following in
this eighth, ninth, and tenth, etc Of the Doctrinal Parts of the seven Chapters
precedent, and of the Mysteries contained in them, it has been my Lot to treat
in former Books of these Commentaries, and as the matters handled in them did
minister occasion, upon a great part of the first Chapter, upon some principal
passages in the second and third; upon the most part of the fifth, sixth, and
seventh, the Reader may find what I did conceive to be most useful for his
instruction or meditation, in the seventh, eighth, and ninth Books of these
Commentaries.

2. The Places whereunto the First Verse of this Eighth Chapter has more
special Reference, are the four first verses of the First Chapter. God who at
sundry times, and in diverse manners spoke in times past unto the Fathers by the
Prophets, has in these last days spoken unto us by his son, whom be has
appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds. etc. Who when he
had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
high: being made so much better then the Angels, as he has by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name then they. etc. But unto which of the Angels
said he at any time sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
footstool? ver. 13. Another place (whereunto the same words Chap. 8. 1.
refer, most to be observed as a principal Pillar of our Belief concerning
the heavenly Sanctuary wherein Christ sits on the right hand of God) is that;
Chap. 6. ver. 19. 20. Which hope we have as an Anchor of the soul both sure and
steadfast, and which enters into that within the vail, whither the forerunner
is for us entered, even Jesus made an High Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedeck.

3. With this last passage of Chap. 6, the Mysteries contained in the in the 8,
9, and tenth chapters do most immediately accord. Mysteries I am bold to style
them, (though some interpreters make them no more then Metaphors, or unhandsom
Rhetorical Tropes) because the matters contained in them are expressd in Divine
Allegories, which (as has been observed before) do herein far exceed
Allegories merely Rhetorical or concerning matters Secular, in that they
always afford Concludent Proof, that is, true Arguments of Real Proportions.
The Principal Terms or Real Subjects of Proportions in the 8, and ninth
chapters of this Epistle are these following; The Earthly or mundan Tabernacle,
and the Celestial; The Two Sanctuaries contained in the Earthly Tabernacle,
and the Two Heavenly Sanctuaries which in proportion answer to them: The
several manner of Dedication or Consecration of all these Sanctuaries: The
several manner or Rites used in the Dedication of all these Sanctuaries: The
distinct Offices of the High Priest and Ordinary Priests of the old Testament
or Covenant, and of the Only High Priest of the New.

4. In the earthly Tabernacle framed and pitched by Moses, and so likewise in
the Temple of Jerusalem projected by David but finished and consecrated by
Solomon his son, there were Two Sanctuaries or Holy Places: One, into which the
Ordinary Priests were by precept to enter every day; The Other into which it
was lawful for none save for the High Priest alone to enter, and that but Once
every Year. Now this earthly or mundane Tabernacle (which contained these two
Sanctuaries) being erected by Gods special Command unto Moses, according to the
Pattern which had been showed him in the mount; it is a clear Case from our
Apostles Authority and Exposition of Moses, that, Both these Sanctuaries or
Holy Places made with hands, were but Types or shadows of two Sanctuaries,
not made with hand but prepared or Created by God himself in the Heavens. Every
High Priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices, wherefore it is of
necessity that this Priest have somewhat also to offer; For if he were on earth
he should not be a Priest, seeing that there are Priests that offer Gifts
according to the Law: who serve unto the example and shadow of Heavenly
things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
Tabernacle. For See (says he) that thou make all things according to the
Pattern showed to thee in the mount. Heb. 8. 3. 4. 5. These words contain a
Fundamental Principle, which, were it exactly surveyed; and a Profound
Mystery, which, were it well sounded would guide us to the discovery of many
more throughout this Epistle, and afford much variety of admirable Consequences
to every Learned, or however, matter in store, of Admiration to every Ingenuous
Reader.

5. To give some Hints unto the One, and directions unto the Other: The
heavenly Sanctuary represented by the most Holy place (or that which they call
Sanctum Sanctorum) in the earthly Tabernacle or material Temple, as is evident
from our Apostle, Chap. 1. Was that heavenly Sanctuary whereunto our High
Priest Christ Jesus is entered Once for all, and wherein he continually
exercises his Everlasting Priesthood. And after the second Vail, (was) the
Tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all, which had the golden Censer and
the Ark of the Covenant overlayed round about with gold, wherein was the golden
pot that had manna, and Aarons rod that budded, and the Tables of the Covenant,
and over it the Cherubims of Glory shaddowing the Mercieseat: of which we
cannot now speak particularly. Now when these things were thus ord^ined, the
Priest went always into the first Tabernacle, accomplishing the service of
God, but into the second went the High Priest alone once every year, not
without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people.
The Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the Holiest of all was not yet
made manifest (that is, not yet opened, but close shut) while as the first
Tabernacle was yet standing. Heb. 9. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

6 But unto whom was the way into the Most Holy Place so shut? unto men only as
unto Enoch and Elias, or unto the souls of Patriarchs, of prophets, or of
other Saints deceased? or unto all besides the son of God, the holy Angels not
excepted?

CHAP. XLV.
That the Souls of Righteous Men, Abraham, etc. were in a Blissful heavenly
mansion before; But after The Kingdom of Heaven was perfectly set up and open
to all Belei verse By Christ's Placing As man at the Right Hand of God, Their
Condition was Bettered
1. WEre not the souls of righteous men, of Abraham, of David, of Patriarchs,
of prophets in a Place of Bliss or in heaven it self before our Savior's
Ascension thither? I make no Question but they were estated in some Blissful
heavenly Mansion. For it is not to be suspected that Abraham from the day of
his death was not as near unto the throne of Majesty, and in a place of as
great Happiness as the Penitent Malefactors soul was admitted into, some few
hours after his torments upon the Cross were ended. Now the place whereunto he
was in soul admited the same day he dyed, was a True Paradise, not that
Terrestrial Paradise which Adam lost; much less any Region under the Earth, or
Concavitie in the Earth, as some have imagined that which they call Limbus
Patrum to be; but that Celestial Mansion which the First earthly Paradise did
represent: That, into which Adam, if he had not forfeited his estate in the
first Paradise, should in good time, it may be, have been translated in Body.
That Abraham was in a place of Bliss, and of reward or Recompense according to
the righteousness of his ways, is clear from the Parable of Lazarus, whose
soul was carried by the Angels, not into any Subterraneal Vault (of which or
like places the holy Angels are no officers or attendants) but into Abraham's
Bosom. So all English Translations render that place without any dissent or
discord to the Greek or Latin; from neither of which, notwithstanding, this
sense or signification of the word can be concludently inferred. For Sinus in
Latin or (...) in Greek do signify or import as well that which we call in
English a Bay, a safe Rode or Harbor for ships, as a Bosom. And with the
warrant of the most learned and Punctual Interpreters of the Scripture amongst
the Greek Fathers, that place, Luke 16. ver. 22. [(...) ] May be rendered thus,
that the soul of Lazarus was carried or wafted by the Angels into the Bay of
Abraham, that is, into some one of those heavenly places wherein the souls of
Abraham and other righteous men did rest, as ships in a safe Bay or Harbor,
freed from all Dangers of wind and other annoyances, expecting time or
opportunity to arrive or to be transported into the Royal Seat or Haven of
blessedness, (which, as has been said) was not open or passable until the
King of glory did enter into it. So that Abraham and many others were blessed
in soul in those heavenly Harbors into which they were wafted or safely
conducted by the Angels, but did not, but possibly could not, receive the
accomplishment of such bliss, as the humane sanctified soul, though separated
from the body is capable of, until the Son of God did enter into the holy
place not made with hands; that is, not till his Ascension both in Body and
Soul into the highest Heaven; not before his Enthronization in his Seat of
Majesty at the Right Hand of God the Father.

2. The truth of this last Assertion [Albeit Abraham were in a blessed Haven:
yet the Anchor of his Hopes did not approach the true Seat of Bliss before our
Saviors Ascension] may be inferred from our Apostle, Heb. 6. 19, 20, This hope
we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast ((...)) and which
enters into that within the Vail, whither the forerunner is for us entered,
even Jesus, made an high Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedeck. As
also from another place much mistaken by some of the Ancients and not well
translated by many modern Interpreters, Heb. 11. 39, 40. All these (of which
number Enoch, Abraham, and Moses were three principal ones) having obtained A
Good Report through Faith received not the promise, God having provided some
better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. That is,
should not be Consecrated to be Kings and Priests, before such of the faithful
as lived at the time of our Saviors Ascension were Consecrated with them. And
in this sense that of St. Ambrose (with whose Expressions of this Mystery many
in our times have been altogether causelessly much offended) [when thou hadest
overcome the sharpness of death thou did open the kingdom of heaven to all
Believers,] ought to be taken. Nothing can be more plain or more Concludently
proved from our Saviors own words and his Apostles Comments on them, than
this, That, The Kingdom of Heaven it self was not Erected, was not established
until that Jesus, whom the Jews had Crucified, was made both Lord and Christ,
and placed as Man at the Right Hand of his Father.

3. To dilate further upon this Point for this Present I dare not, lest I
should lose my way, or forget to return to the other Parallel proposed, to wit,
[What heavenly Mansion or Sanctuary the first Part of the earthly Tabernacle,
or Court, whereinto the ordinary Priests went every day, did represent or
foreshaddow?] I shall not trespass against any Article of Faith, or Rule of
interpreting Scriptures, nor I hope offend any ingenuous Conscience, by
delivering my Opinion in a Point wherein the Scripture (as I conceive) is
silent, or which can neither be enforced upon Us as any part of Christian
Belief, nor be refuted by any Rule of Faith. To my apprehension of our Apostles
meaning, Heb. 8. ver. 5. That place or Mansion in the heavenly Tabernacle
wherein Abraham, Lazarus etc. did rest, before The Kingdom of heaven was set
open to all Beleivers, was That Place or Court which Atrium Sacerdotum, the
Court of the Priests in the first Tabernacle or in Salomons Temple, did Picture
out unto us. Or, if the souls of the Faithful were not admitted into That
Place before Christ's death: we cannot allot a Lower or Outermer Mansion in
heaven it self than that, which Atrium Congregation is, that is, the Court of
the Congregation in Salomons Temple, whereinto the Congregation of Israel which
were no Priests were admitted and taught by the Priests, did represent. However
it be, That heavenly Mansion or Sanctuary, which in proportion truly answered
to the Sanctuary or Court of Priests in the material Temple, was no such happy
Seat of Bliss, before Christ's Death, as it was made by it. For by his Blood it
was finally Consecrated or dedicated to be what now it is, a True Temple, which
was the Second Parallel proposed.

CHAP. XLVI.
A Parallel betwixt the Rites of Dedicating the Tabernacle, the Vessels, etc.
with Blood of Beasts; And of Consecrating the Heavenly Places with the most
Precious Blood of Jesus Christ.
1. THe Place or Station for drawing this Parallel aright is Hebr. 9. Neither
was the first Testament dedicated without Blood. For when Moses had spoken
every Praecept to all the People according to the Law; he took the blood of
Calves, and of Goats, with water, and Scarlet wool, and Hyssop, and sprinkled
both the Book and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the Testament
which God has enjoined unto you. Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the
Tabernac^ and all the vessels of the Ministry. And almost all things are by
the Law purged with Blood, and without shedding of blood is no Remission, Ver.
18, 19, 20, 21, 22. All this he speaks, according to the plain Litteral Sense
of the Law, concerning the Purifying or Consecrating of the Earthly Tabernacle
with its Vessels or Implements. The Mystical Sense or meaning of the Matters of
Fact or Practices performed by Moses and Aaron, when they consecrated the first
Tabernacle with the blood of Bullocks and Goats, etc. is literally explained
unto us by this our Apostle in the verses following. It was therefore necessary
that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purifyed with these, but
the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these, ver. 23.
These words admit no Metaphors or Tropes, but have their proper and Real
Logical Sense. The Argument is most punctually Concludent; [The Similitude or
paterns of heavenly things were purified with blood: therefore the heavenly
things themselves, that is, the Caelestial Tabernacles were to be purged and
consecrated with the blood of Christ our high Priest which is now entered into
them for our Sanctification and final Redemption.] To inquire what should
become of all our Saviors blood whether shed in his Agony or upon the Cross,
will seem I know A Curious Question, specially to slothful Students in
Divinity. On the otherside, it would argue a drowsy Fancy either voluntarily
to imagine, or to be by others persuaded, That his most Precious blood being
shed in such abundance should be like water spilt upon the ground, either
swallowed up by the dry earth, or mingled with dust, or dispersed by the heat
of the Sun and resolved into vapors. Seeing every drop of it was truly The
blood of God: It can be no Sin to suppose, nay to believe, that All of it was
by his death, made, as his Body now is, Immortal; that All of it was preserved
entire and sincere, and brought either by his own immediate power, or by the
Ministry of his holy Angels into those heavenly Sanctuaries, which were to be
CONSECRATED by it, to be the Seats or Mansions of everlasting bliss unto all
true Believers, and thus brought in at the time of his Entrance into Paradise
in soul, though not in Body, which was immediately after he had commended his
Spirit unto his heavenly Father.

2. If unto all that has been said in this Argument, I should further add,
That the most precious blood of the Son of God which was shed for the Ransom of
our Sins in the Garden or upon the Cross, and brought into the Celestial
Tabernacle upon his death (whether reunited to his Glorified Body or glorified
in it self and preserved apart from his body) does still retain an everlasting
Efficacy for the daily Purifying of our hearts and working Sanctification in
us; I presume the Intelligent or ingenuous Reader will interpret this Assertion
rather for a Point of speculation, not much thought upon by others, than any
Paradox or Heterodoxal Doctrine of my own Invention. But of the true Vertual
presence, or Real Operation, of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
upon our Souls, in so great distance as is between the most high and most holy
Celestial Sanctuary and these material Temples here on earth, wherein we
Celebrate and Solemnize the memory of his Death and passion, more punctually
and more fully, if God shall be pleased to give leave, In the 11. Book.
hereafter. All which I have here affirmed or intimated will uncontrollably
follow from our Apostles Doctrine in this Epistle, and from other Passages of
his Fellow Apostles. To begin with that of Heb. 9. 11 etc. Christ being come an
High Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle
not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood
of Goats and Calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy
place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of Bulls and
of Goats and of the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to
the purging of the flesh; How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God? In this passage we have the true
Mystical or Prophetical Sense of sundry Mosaical Rites or sacrifices plainly
decyphered without Metaphor or Figure; the very Literal Historical or Civil
sense, of some of which, or of the Legal Precept which injoynes, or of the Rule
for right using them, but a few Christian Writers have duly considered or
rightly understood. It shall suffice me to insist upon the Parallel between
such Mosaical Rites as I understand with their right use or End, and the
Evangelical Mysteries fore-pictur^d by them.

CHAP. XLVII.
Before the fuller Draught of that Parallel (If the blood of Bulls -- and the
ashes of an Heifer --. Much more the Blood of Christ --.) treated on in the two
next Chapters; The Apostles Translating the Hebrew word (Berith) by [(...)], is
showed to be, not a mere Allusion, but of strict Propriety.
1. THe Height and Depth of the Mysteries contained in these two verses,
Hebrews 9 13, 14. cannot in this life be truly sounded. And before I can
survey the Surface of the Parallel intended by our Apostle, I must endeavor to
charm the Tongues and Pens of some saucy Critics in these last Ages: Such for
the most part are mere Grammarians, or men in whom Grammatical skill is too
predominant. For of this Light kind of Learning that of our Apostle Scientia
inslat, as Ludovicus Vives somewhere well observes, is most punctually or
peculiarly true. And the man whose Brain is full of this skill, and whose
Breast is empty of Morality or other solid and ingenuous Literature, is like
a Pinnace ballasted with Cork or some lighter Stuff bearing the Sail of a
Gallioun or Carack. And if this mere Verbal skill be matched with some slight
Dialectical Terms, as with Second Notions or Dichotomies, these serve as
Engines to set words, Dictated by the Holy Ghost, or the several significations
of one and the same word, at Opposition one to another; whereas they admit only
some Difference, no way opposite but subordinate, or truly Concordant. Some of
this Crew in the Romish Church (with whom I dare not avow that None in the
Reformed Churches are participant,) have been so bold as to impeach the Author
of this Divine Epistle (if not directly, yet by Necessary Implication) either
of Ignorance in the Hebrew Dialect, or of such fancies or delight to play with
words, as have been too frequent in these Later Ages. For so they say that St.
Paul (or who ever he were that was the Author of this Epistle) does play with
the Hebrew [Berith] when he translates it, in this ninth Chapter or elsewhere,
by the Greek [(...)] which primarily and properly signifies a Testament or
disposition of goods or inheritance bequeathed; whereas Berith does punctually
and formally signify a League or Covenant.

2. All this notwithstanding argues only some Diversity in the Signification
or Interpretation of the words, no Real Difference or Opposition of the matter
signified by them; no more (if so much) then is between a Liveing Creature
endued with Sense, and, A man or Sensitive Creature endued with Reason. Now
though every Creature endued with sense be not a man, or reasonable Creature,
yet every man Essentially is a Creature endowed with sense. The Connection
between these two words which some Critics have set at Variance, to wit,
between a Covenant and a Testament, is altogether as Essential and Formal as
the former betwixt a Man and a Sensitive Creature: for albeit every Covenant be
not truly and formally a Testament, yet every Testament truly so called,
essentially is or includes a true and proper Covenant. So that one and the same
word [Berith] in some places of the old Testament imports no more than the
Genus or General signification, to wit, a Covenant: In other places it
necessarily imports a Testamental Covenant, and must be rendered, as the Apostle
here does, by (...), that is a Last Will or Valid Testament. Our blessed Lord
and Savior (I believe, and those which impeach our Apostle in this place will
not, I hope, deny) did understand the meaning of the Hebrew [Berith] as it is
used in that Great Covenant with the Israelites (whereof Moses by Gods
appointement was the mediator) Much better then any modern Grammarian Critic
does. Now our Savior instructs us that the Covenant, made by Moses betwixt God
and the Israelites, was a true and proper Testament. This Cup (says he in the
Institution of the new Covenant) is the new Testament in my blood, which is
shed for you. And if this new Covenant (as Jeremy instyles it) were truly and
properly a Testament: then questionless the old Covenant which God made with
his people in the Institution of the Passover, and renewed by Moses in the
wilderness, was a Testament truly and properly so called, and ought to be
translated by the Greek (...). All the Covenants which God made with his people
whether concerning the Blessings of this life, or of the life to come were but
Introductions, Parcels, or Appendices unto the old and new Testaments.

3. Wherein then does a Testament properly so called, exceed a naked Covenant?
There may be, and usually are, many Covenants wherein there is no Free Donation
of either party Covenanting, but a mutual Reddition of Quid pro Quo, or (as
some Civilians speak) Ratio datiet accepti: And such a Covenant or Act of
Commutative Justice, cannot properly be conceived betwixt God and man or other
creature: None of which are able to give their Creator any thing which was not
his own before, or which was not received from him by Free Gift. Every Last
Will or Testament includes or presupposes a Free Donation of some Goods or
Lands etc. by the Testator, though often times upon Covenant or subsequent
Condition of Executing or performing the Will or Testament: otherwise the
Legatee, or Executor, may forfeit his Estate or Interest in the Goods freely
Bequeathed unto him. And of this nature are both the old and new Testaments.
Neither of them was Absolute in respect of all that had Interest in the
Blessings be queath'd; which, howsoever they were most freely bequeathed, did
tie such as had Interest in them unto performance of such Conditions, as being
neglected or contemned by them, might deprive them of the Inheritance or
Blessings bequeathed. The Blessings bequeathed by Moses (Gods Ambassador both
to Pharaoh and to his people: or, as the Apostle instyles him, the Mediator of
the old Testament) were First, The Deliverance of the sons of Jacob from
Egypt; Secondly the inheritance of the Land of Canaan. The Blessings,
bequeathed by the Mediator of the new Testament and ratified by his Blood,
were, the Deliverance of mankind from the powers of darkness, and the
inheritance of the kingdom of Light.

4. The Parallel between the Institution of the Passover and of the Lords
Supper; or of the two Inheritances bequeathed, the one by Moses, the other by
Christ, is so plain that it needs no Comment. It only requires a diligent
Reader or Hearer; or what is wanting on the ordinary Hearers part may be
supplied by every ordinary Catechist before the receiving of the Sacramental
Pledges. One point yet remains more pertinent to the unfolding of our Apostles
meaning, [Heb. 9. ver. 15. And for this cause he is the Mediator of the new
Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions
that were under the First Testament, they which are called might receive the
promise of Eternal Inheritance. For where a Testament is, there must also of
necessity be the death of the Testator. For a Testament is of force after men
are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the Testator lives.] And
it is this: As the Israelites did not enter upon the inheritance, or take
possession of the Land of Canaan, till after Moses the Testator or Mediator of
the old Testament, was dead; so neither was the Kingdom of Heaven our
everlasting inheritance set open to all or any Beleivers until Christ Jesus,
the Testator or Mediator of the new Testament, was crucified, dead, buried, and
raised again to immortal Glory. Since which time, as is the King, so is the
Kingdom or inheritance bequeathed; so is the Testament it self, being sealed by
his bloody death; All and every of them, Truly Everlasting.

CHAP. XLVIII.
The Parallel between the most Solemn Services of the Law and The One Sacrifice
of Christ. And, The high praeeminence and efficacy of This in comparison of
Those. The Romanists Doctrine [that in the Mass Christ's Body is Identically
Carnally present, and that there is a proper Sacrifice Propitiatory offered]
derogates from the Absolute Perfection of Christ's offering himself Once for all.
1. THe principal Terms of proportion in this Parallel which serve as so many
several Kens or Marks for the right survaying of it, are The services of the
Law, or the Offices of Legal Priests, and the Perpetual Function of our High
Priest. The services of the Law wherein our Apostle instanceth, are the
Principal and most Solemn Sacrifices, which were enjoined to the Priests after
the order of Aaron. The One Sort whereof were Anniversaries, as of Bullockes
and Goats* and to be offered every year upon the day of Atonement, and so to
be offered from the First Erection of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, so long
as the Law of Ceremonies was de Jure to continue, until our Saviors death
upon the Cross; since which time all Bloody Sacrifice have lost their Legal
Use. The Other service was That Sacrifice of the Red Heifer, and the
Consecration of water by the sprinkling or mingling her Ashes; which perhaps
was not Anniversarie, nor often put in practice from the time of Moses his
Death until the Ascension of our Savior into heaven.

Now our Apostle takes it as granted, that if these choice Sacrifices, of
Attonment, and of the Red Cow, were altogether unsufficient to purify the
Hearts and Consciences, or the Souls and Spirits of sinful men; the Ordinary
or meaner sacrifices of the Law were much more unsufficient to all such
purposes as the Sacrifices of our high Priest was Alsufficient to all such
purposes as the Sacrifice of our high Priest was Alsufficient and most
Efficacious for. The Eminency of Christ's bloody Sacrifice upon the Cross (in
respect of all Legal sacrifices of what rank soever) consists, First, in the
Efficacy which it had and has for Remission of all sins committed against the
Moral Law of God; that is, of all such sins as immediately pollute the
reasonable Soul and Conscience. The least degree of such Purification no Legal
Sacrifices could immediately effect, reach, or touch. To what Use then did they
directly serve? or what was the proper Effect unto which they were immediately
terminated? That was the Purification of men's Bodies from mere Legal
uncleanness; that is, from all such negligences, Ignorances, or Casual
Occurrences as not being expiated by the Priest, did exclude the parties so
offending from the Tabernacle of the Congregation; Or (as our Apostle speaks)
to Purify them from such uncleanness of the flesh, as did but foreshadow or
picture the uncleanness of the soul, or the dead works of sin, All which,
being not expiated by a more excellent Priest then any was after the order of
Aaron* will exclude all from entering into the heavenly Tabernacle.

2. Such Legal uncleanness, as did exclude the Parties polluted with it from
the Tabernacle of the Congregation, was many ways contracted; as by touching
of the dead; by eating of Meats forbidden by the Law; or by not eating meats
allowed of by the Law according to the Rule or Prescript for such Ceremonial
Services; or by the like Omissions or Practices which were not in their own
nature or to all men sinful, but sinful in the Seed of Jacob only, to whom they
were Evil only because forbidden, not forbidden because they were evil in
their own nature. Even in regard of such shadows or Typical Offices for
Purifying men Legally unclean, the best and most solemn Sacrifices of the Law
(though offered once at least every year, and otherwise as often as daily
Occasions or Occurrences did require) were no way so efficacious or Effectual,
as the One Sacrifice of the Son of God offered by himself but Once for all, is
for the perpetual Purifying of our Souls from the Dead works of sin, and for
our Consecration to the everlasting service of the everliving God, which is
that Freedom indeed wherewith his only Son has promised to set all such Free,
as Believe in his Name and Abide in his word, John 8.

3. The Eminency of Christ's Priesthood and Sacrifice, above the Priesthood and
Services of the Law is deeply wronged by the Doctrine and Practice of Secular
and Regular Roman Catholic Priests, as they do term themselves; and so is our
Apostles Doctrine in the ninth and tenth Chapters to the Hebrews, more
peremptorily contradicted by them, then it was by the Incredulous or
unbelieving Jews, in his life time. The Western Antichrist (so the Lutherans
distinguish them) has in this particular so far outbid the Antichrist of the
East, that if (...), that Law-opposer or man of sin, were to be followed close
with Howant-Cry, or his Footsteps to be traced for these nine hundred years, by
the Christian Kingdoms or States, the Chase and Cry would sooner fall into Rome
or Trent then into Constantinople; though That, no question, be now the seat of
Gog and Magog or of the Eastern Antichrist. That Contradiction of Sinners,
which our Savior Christ did endure here on Earth, Heb. 12. 3. improved by the
Roman Church in later days, against all such as rightly believe in him,
specially against such as duly administer his holy Sacraments, may with its
improvement be concludently inferred by the Tenants and daily Practices of that
Church, both which are as punctually and as fully contradictory to the Doctrine
of the Author of this Epistle, Chap. 9. and 10. and to many other principal
Maxims of Christian Religion, as any Doctrine, Tenent, or Practice can be one
to another. For the Law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the
very image of the things, can never with those Sacrifices which they offered
year by year continually to make the Comers thereunto perfect. For then would
they not have ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once purged
should have had no more conscience of Sins. But in those sacrifices there is a
remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the
blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sins, etc. Heb. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. By
the which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
ONCE FOR ALL. And every Priest stands daily ministering and offering
oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. But this man
(or rather this Priest) after he had offered ONE SACRIFICE for sins for ever,
sat do^n on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies
be made his footstool. For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that
are sanctified. Whereof the holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that
he had said before, this is the Covenant that will make with them after those
days, says the Lord: I will put my Laws into their hearts, and in their minds
will I write them: and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now
where Remission of these is, there is no more offering for Sin, ver. 10. to 18.

4. The force of our Apostles Inference, and the very Pith of his Discourse
throughout these Passages, presented to the Readers View, does more punctually
refute the Doctrine of the Romish Mass, then it did the Contradicting, Jews,
or other Blasphemers of Christ's Name and Office, either before or since this
Divine Epistle was written. The Pith and Marrow of all his Arguments consists
in This; That even the best of Legal Sacrifices or services (were they bloody
or unbloudy) were altogether Unsufficient to Purify the Conscience, could
never take away sin; Because They were to be Reiterated, the best and most
solemn of them every Year, and many of them every Day, others as often as Casual
Occasions did require Now if this Argument be Concludent (as no Christian can
deny it to be) against the Jews which pleaded for the Sufficiency of Legal
Sacrifices, it will conclude a fortiori, or with a (...) Heb 9. 14. against the
absolute Perfection or Sufficiency of our Saviors Sacrifice of Himself
(supposing that it should be as the Romanists teach.) Thus much it will
inevitably infer, according to the Peremptory Canons of the Roman Church,
which plainly teach, and under pain of damnation enjoin all Christians to
believe, that Christ's Body and Blood That very same Body, that very same blood
which were once offered by himself upon the Cross, are daily offered by the
Masle-Priest. Or, as if this were not enough, to outvie the Jewish Synagogue
in the Sin of Contradiction to Christ, they add, that every such offering is a
propitiatory Sacrifice as well for some that be dead, as for the living. And I
think such Oblations as they make, do the one sort as little good or as little
harm as they do the other, unless they solicit the Priest to make this kind
of Atonement for them. But to such Sollicitors or Executors of such
Solicitations both Doctrine and Practice must needs create as great danger as
any Heresy, or Branch of Contradicting Infidelity has done or can do to the
mainteiners of it. This Branch of the Roman Churches Doctrine does as
punctually Contradict that Fundamental Doctrine, Heb. 9. 13. [If the blood of
Bullocks and Goats, etc.] as it does the forecited Passages, Heb. 10.

5. But the authorized practice of consecrating their Holy water for remission
of sins and Sanctification, is most palpably Contradictory to our Apostles
meaning, or to the meaning of the holy Spirit in that other Instance of the
Water of Sprinkling, wherein the Ashes of the Red Cow were Special Ingredients,
and gave the virtue and Tincture unto it, for purifying men from such Legal
uncleanness, as the best Ceremonies of the Law and This Water in special was
Consecrated for. The Law for the Consecrating This water, and the Use or Ends
for which it was Consecrated we have Numb. 19. The mistaking of which place,
and the gross misse-use of the like water solemnly consecrated by that
Canonical Authority, which the Romish Church does challenge ^ver all other
Churches, is set down in such plain terms, that no honest hearted Roman
Catholic specially of the English, Scottish, Netherlandish or German Nation, if
he be able to read the New Testament in his own Native Language, but he will be
either heartily sorry for Alexander the fifth who made this Canon, or at least
ashamed that their Forefathers should approve it, or that it should be
practiced by their Instructers, if they would permit them to have the reason of
the Canon or Decree rightly translated into a Language which they understand.

7. But wherein did the Roman Church so grossly mistake the meaning of the Holy
Ghost in that instance of the Red Heifer, Heb. 9. ver. 13. Or, to what
mischievous inconvenience does her practice unto this day, upon this mistake
amount? To no less inconvenience, to no lower degree of Antichristian Impiety
then this, that the Legal Priests with their Ceremonies or Sacrifices should be
truer Types of every Mass Priest, whether of higher or lower Rank, and of
their services, then of Christ Jesus our high Priest, or of his everlasting
Sacrifice, and perpetual Function: Both which were and are performed by him in
his own Person, not by any Deputies or Vicars. But to me it is no wonder, if
that Church do make Aaron, Eleazar, and their Successors rather Types of
Mass Priests then of Christ: seeing (as has been observed before) they make
Melchizedeck himself (according to whose Order the Son of God only was to be
consecrated High Priest) a more lively Type of meanest Mass Priests, then any
true adumbration or shadow of Christ Jesus; and the Service of the
Mass Priests at the Altar to be the accomplishment of Melchizedecks Priesthood.

8. Had then the Anniversarie sacrifices of Bulls and Goats upon the Day of
Atonement no Reference or relation to the Sacrament, of Christ's Body and
Blood? Nor the water of sprinkling mingled with the ashes of the Red Heifer, no
semblance with the Sacramental water of Baptism? Yes doubtless, both these
Ceremonies had special Reference unto, and exact semblance with these two
Blessed Sacraments: And yet were both of them shadows or Types only of Christ's
Bloody sacrifice upon the Cross, and of the perpetual Exercise of his
Everlasting Priesthood, since he ascended into his heavenly Tabernacle. Christ
Jesus only and his everlasting Priesthood is the very Body or solid substance
of all Legal Rites or services: And of this Body the Anniversarie sacrifices,
whether of Atonement or others, were true Types or shadows. And of the same
Body or Substance, the Sacraments of his body and blood, and of Baptism are
somewhat more then Types; True Representations of what is past, assured Pledges
of all the Blessings promised to the Fathers and Patriarchs in the Old
Testament, and actually Exhibited in a better manner, then they were to them,
unto all Believers, since his entrance into the most Holy Place.

CHAP. XLIX.
That The Foreign mainteiners of the more then Fatal Irrespective Rigid
Decree make Christ Jesus rather a mere Sacrifice Then a True Everlasting
Priest acting for us, and daily working out our Reconciliation to God. So do
such as teach [That The Sins of some were Remitted before they were
Committed.] Of the Super-Excellency of Christ's Priesthood and one Sacrifice in
comparison of The Aaronical Pr. and the many Services thereof.
1. BUt here I must expect this or the like Reply from some Interimists or such
peaceable men as desire a reconciliation betwixt Ours and the Romish Church: If
to celebrate the Sacrifice of the Mass, that is, So to offer up Christ's body
and Blood or whole Christ upon the Altar, be a branch of Antichristianism or an
implicit denial of Christ's Everlasting Priesthood: will you undertake to acquit
the reformed Churches (as you term them) from the like sin or Sacrilegious
opinions, or from robbing Christ of his Greatest Honors as He is Man, which
are, to be King, Priest, and Judge? For any entire Reformed Churches or
Christian Soveraigntie, whose Public Confessions or authorized Catechismes it
has been my hap to Read, I know not one that is this way faulty: Nor do the
bitterest adversaries of the Gallican, Swizterland, or German Churches lay
Antichristianism to the charge of their autorized Canons or Constitutions,
Albeit they indict a great number of private writers, Pastors or Teachers in
Germany, France, and Switzerland, many in England and more in Scotland for
being devoted Members of the Eastern Antichrist; the height of whose Haeresie
or Infidelity, they place in the Maintenance of That more then Fatal
irrespective Decree, in respect of Which all things (Christ's death it self not
excepted) be said, so to fall out, as that they could not fall out otherwise or
be prevented.

2. For such private writers as have gone too far in the Points mentioned, in
what Christian Church soever they be, I leave them to answer for themselves and
for those whose doctrine they Follow. My purpose is only to request my Brethren
of the Church of England (however for the present they stand affected in these
points) to take it into more deep and Logical Consideration then hitherto it
has been taken by English Preachers or Writers; Whether, According to Foreign
Rigid Tenets of Predestination, or of Gods absolute irrespective Decree for
Election and Reprobation, (which came to us English at the third hand, as from
Zwinglius etc. which They had at the first, from some ancient Romish
Schoolmen,) it be possible for us or them to maintain by any rational way;
That our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ either now is, or has been a true
Priest or Sacrificer, rather then a mere Sacrifice predestined from eternity
for taking away the sins of the Elect only? Or whether such, as They Term
Elect from Eternity, needed any Priest at all besides God the Father who did
destinate his Only Son to be a Sacrifice or a mean necessary (though
subordinate) for effecting the principal or utmost end of his Decree; to wit,
his own Glory by the salvation of the Elect? My poor Capacity for these 34.
years wherein I have lived a Minister, or Priest, of the Church of England,
could never, nor yet can find any tolerable answer, or Evasion, to free, such
as maintain the often-mentioned Rigid Decree, from these Two Imputations. The
One, That they cannot truly or by any rational way acknowledge Christ to be a
Priest after the order of Melchisedec: The Other, That they cannot acknowledge
him to be properly instyled such a Judge, as in our Creed we profess him to be.
They will at length be enforced to borrow a more fit expression of his Office
from our Sister-Nation, and instyle him to be the Doomester or Doomesman of the
Quick and of the Dead; that is, an Inferior Officer, which has no hand or Vote
in the course of Justice for Life and Death, but only a power or delegated
authority to read or pronounce the sentence which the Judge or Chief Officer
of State had written before; though not so long before or in such indeleble
Characters, as the Doom, which our Savior Christ shall pronounce upon Every
man at the Great day of his appearance, was written in the Life-books of life
and death everlasting. My exhortation, unto every man amongst us which believe
in his name, shall be, that of the Learned and pious Hemingius: That we seek
not our assurance of Faith or hope in Parcarum Tabulis, which were irreversibly
written before any part of the world was made (if we may believe some heathen
poets or Stoics,) but in, Gods promises made to Abraham, and to be performed
by Jesus Christ as he is now our High Priest and King, and as the Supreme Judge
of Quick and Dead.

3. Having thus far endeavored to sever the dross or wipe off the Aspersions
(or such meaner stuff) as have been cast upon, or mingled themselves with that
Golden Foundation laid by our Apostle Hebr. 9. My next Addressment must be to
Dilate or Diduct the Precious Metal contained in it, or in the Third Parallel
proposed. The Parallel was between the anniversarie Sacrifices of Atonement,
the Sacrifices of the Red Cow; and the One Sacrifice offered Once for all by
our Everlasting High Priest. His Sacrifice is truly instyled Everlasting, not
for this reason alone, that it was of Infinite Value, or a full price for
purchasing the Everlasting Redemption of mankind; but in this respect also,
that it has an Everlasting Efficacy for the daily remission of actual sins,
for purifying the Hearts and Consciences of all such as in Faith daily pray
unto the Father in the name and mediation of his only Son, who is likewise
rightly instyled an Everlasting Priest, not in regard only that he is now
altogether immortal; but more especially* in that he Perpetually executes the
Office of the High Priesthood, by making Continual Intercession for us, and by
accomplishing our Reconciliation unto the Godhead. All things are of God who
has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the
Ministry of reconciliation: to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the
world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and has committed
unto Us the word of reconciliation. 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. This Reconciliation Qua
Deus nos sibi reconciliavit, was wrought by Christ whilst he went about on
earth doing good, and by his sufferings upon the Cross etc. The Other part of
our Reconciliation, or reconciliation taken in the Passive Sense, Qua nos Deo
reconciliamur, is daily wrought in true Beleivers by this our High Priest; and
so wrought, by the continuated participation of his Spirit, by the interposed
renovations or nourishments of that Grace, which immediately descendes to us
from the sweet influence of this Sun of righteousness, now sitting more
Glorious (by much) in his heavenly Tabernacle then the visible Sun in its
Sphere. And of This Part of Reconciliation, or of Reconciliation in the Passive
Sense, must that of our Apostle be understood.

Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us,
we pray you in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God. For he has made him, to
be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God
in him, 2 Cor. 5. 20, 21.

4. He that desires to guess aright at the Eminency of Christ's Priesthood
and Sacrifice, in respect of the Aaronical or Legal Services, or to take such
an indefinite Estimate of both, as may advance his Meditations upon The
knowledge of Christ crucified, and ascended into the heaven of heavens, may
follow the Scale set by Astronomers betwixt the space of Local distances on
earth, and the space of the highest Celestial Orbs or Spheres, which answer
in proportion to them; always allowing a greater Excess of Proportion between
the Excellency of Christ's Priesthood, beyond Aarons or Melchisedecks, then
Astronomers allot betwixt the space of so many Degrees in the heavens and so
many miles on earth.

5. The Legal Priests or sacrificers were, at the same time and by succession,
Many, their Sacrifices or Services were, both for their kinds or matter, and
for the solemn manner of their offerings, More. The several kinds of their
sacrifices and Solemnities, I leave unto the Readers search, this being an
Argument whereof many have written copiously enough in most modern Churches. It
will be enough for me to observe or call thus much to the Readers Remembrance,
that all the Offices or Services of Legal Priests were fully accomplished in
the Consecration of the Son of God to be our Everlasting High Priest; That all
their Offerings and Sacrifices (whether bloody or unbloudy, whether of
Vegetables as of herbs, or green Ears of Corn, of meal, of Loaves; whether
anniversary, or upon special occasions) were more then accomplished in his Own
Once offering of himself. The All-sufficiencie of this his Oblation of himself
will best appear from the due Consideration of the Multiplicitie of the former
sacrifices, and the often Reiteration of them. Of bloody sacrifices some were
reiterated Every day, others Every year, or in Set Festivals, or upon Special
Occasions for private Persons: And this last sort of sacrifices or Offerings
were to be reiterated so often as Occasions or occurrences did interpose. No
one sacrifice could purify the same party, though peccant only against the Law
of Ceremonies, from his Legal Uncleanness for any more Turns then One. Every
Recidivation or Relapse into the same sin or error was to have a new
Purification.

6. Now if it were possible to calculate, First, The multitude of sins, and
of sinners against the Moral Law of God, in comparison of such as did sin
against the Law of Ceremonies; Secondly, The excessive number of sins
committed by every particular Christian man; and bear this truth in mind, that
there needs no other sacrifice either for sin or sinners besides That One of
Christ himself upon the Cross, the Influence of whose infinite value is daily
and hourly communicated to all such as seek salvation by him: The
Superexcellencie of this our high Priest, and of his sacrifice, in respect of
all Legal Priests and services, will far surmount the compass of the Highest
Heavens or Orbs imaginable, in comparison of the least sensible part of the
Earth.

7. But some New-started Opinions there be, which take away much matter of
Admiration in this great Subject of Divine Meditation, and dull the spirits of
otherwise wel-minded men in the search after the virtue of Christ's Everlasting
Sacrifice and Priesthood. Of these new Opinions, One special One is (for I
must not here touch upon the rest) [That the sins of some men, of all the
Elect, were remitted before they could be committed:] An Opinion void of all
Reference to any pious use or practice; A Speculation most untrue, prodigiously
absurd. For no actual sin by whomsoever committed, can be remitted to men
living here on earth, otherwise then by some new Influence from the Everlasting
Sacrifice of Christ, or (as our Apostle speaks) without the sprinkling of that
blood, Which speaks better things then that of Abel. Heb. 12. 24. As much as
I here intimate, that passage of St. John (if it be rightly scanned) will
clearly evince. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in
darkness, we ly, and do not the truth; But if we walk in the light as he is in
the light, we have fellowship one with another; and the blood of Jesus Christ
his son, cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
our selves and the truth is not in us. 1 John. 1. 6, 7, 8.

8. So then, even such as walk in the light, stand in need of Cleansing by the
blood of Christ. And with Reference to this place (as I conceive) that Maxim of
S Austin, well approved of by the best Reformed writers, was first conceived by
him [Our Justification consists in the perpetual Remission of sin.]
Justification Consists not in one indivisible Act.
But an error there is, which I know not when it did first creep into the
world, but creep it did by the Incogitancie, or indistinct Notions of some Late
writers [That Justification is but one Act, never to be resumed or reiterated.]
This Assertion may be true in respect of That Justification, Qua Deus nos
justificat, or of Justification taken in the Active Sense as it concerns God;
For, no act of his can be resumed or reiterated, nor admit any interpositions
or Interims of time. But if we speak of Justification in the Passive Sense, or
as it is an Effect wrought in our souls by the spirit of Christ, there may be
and are many Acts, many Resumptions or Renovations of the same Act or Effect;
All being wrought in us by Interpositions or several Interims of time. Our
Natural bodies do not require so many Refections of meat and drink for
continuation of life, of health, and strength, as the Faith by which the just
do live, and other spiritual Graces which accompany Faith in the Purification
of our souls, do admit* yea require Refections spiritual. Of these refections
or refreshments of Faith or other Graces, some are obtained by our daily
Prayers: others, being like extraordinary feasts or banquets, are wrought in
the participation Christ's Body and Blood, so often as we receive that blessed
Sacrament as we ought to do. But the most of us which enjoy the Liberty of
Christian Laws do not receives it so often as we ought; Fewer as they ought.
And whosoever receives it unworthily receives it too often, if he so receive
but once. Unto the worthy Receivers of the Sacramental pledges of Christ's Body
and Blood, how often so ever and how many so ever receive them, the Blood of
Christ, though but once shed, becomes a Perennal unexhaustible Fountain of life
everlasting. But of the right interpretation of our Saviors Testament or
Institution of this blessed Sacrament, more at large, by Gods assistance, in
the Article of the Holy Catholic Church. In the mean time Two Prayers there be
commanded by the Church our Mother to be used in the Uisitation of the Sick at
the Administration of the Sacrament unto them; Both which, mutatis mutandis, I
would Commend to every piously minded Christan's Meditations (or to every
professed Christian that desires to be such) both before and after he present
himself at the Lords Table, though he so present himself in perfect health of
body and mind.

1. O Lord look down from heaven, behold, visit, and relieve this thy Servant.
Look upon him with the Eyes of thy mercy, give him comfort* and sure
confidence in thee, defend him from the danger of the Enemy, and keep him in
perpetual peace and safety, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

And 2. O Most Merciful God which according to the multitude of thy mercies
do so put away the sins of those which truly repent, that thou remembrest
them no more, open thine Eye of mercy upon this thy servant, who most
earnestly desires Pardon and forgiveness. Renew in him (most loving Father)
whatsoever has been decayed by the Fraud and malice of the Devil, or by his
own carnal will and frainess. Preserve and continue this sick member in the
unity of the Church, consider his contrition, accept his tears, assuage his
pain as shall be seen to thee most expedient for him. And forasmuch as he
puts his whole trust only in thy mercy, impute not unto him his Former sins,
but take him unto thy Favor through the merits of thy most dearly beloved Son
Jesus Christ. Amen.

CHAP. L.
The Rarity of that Rite of consecrating the Water of Sprinkling by the Ashes
of the Red Heifer, an Emblem of Baptism and the Singularity thereof. Our
Churches meaning in some expressions at the Administration of that Sacrament.
1. BUt although the frequent Use of the Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood be
needful or necessary by Precept, and a Means much available for strengthening
of Faith, or for repairing those decays or ruins which the subtlety of Satan
works in our souls; yet the Reiteration of the Sacrament of Baptism is neither
Necessary nor allowable, much less Commendable for such purposes. And the
Raritie, or rather Singularity of It, was to my apprehension, Emblematically
prefigured by the Sacrifice of the Red Heifer, or the Water of sprinkling,
which was Legally sanctified or consecrated by her Ashes. The Law concerning
this kind of Purification is not to be found (I take it) in Leviticus, at least
not in that sixteenth Chapter wherein the Law of the Sacrifice of atonement is
punctually set down; However the forementioned Glossarie upon the Romish Canon
for consecrating Holy Water, either through negligence, See Chapt. 48 Number. 6.
or ignorance, or both, avouch that place for it. If the sacrifice of the Red
Heifer had belonged unto the Feast of atonement, it must have been reiterated
once every year, whereas the Hebrew Antiquaries affirm; that this solemnity
was not used above tea times during all the time of the Law, of the Tabernacle
or Temple* And whether it were so often used may be questioned, because there
is no Law or Precept for the Continuation of it, but only for the use of the
water of sprinkling (being once consecrated by it) so often as the occasion
specified in the Law did require.

2. But unless the frequent use of the water, so mingled with the ashes, did
wast or exhaust the ashes of that one sacrifice, which Eleazar not Aaron was
commanded to offer, These might have been preserved without putrefaction for a
longer time then the Law of Ceremonies was to endure. For Ashes (as good
Naturalists tell us) being well kept are immortal, or an Emblem of
Immortality. But it may be that as soon, or as often, as the Ashes of any such
sacrifice were, by frequent use of the water of sprinkling, exhausted or
wasted, the Legal Priests were bound by the Law mentioned to offer another for
consecrating the water of sprinkling, whose use was to continue as long as the
reason mentioned in the Law did endure.

3. The chief use or End of the water of sprinkling mingled with the Ashes of
this sacrifice, was to purify such as had made themselves Legally unclean, or
had casually fallen into such uncleanness. One branch of this uncleanness was
the touching, or being touched by any Dead Corpse. And unto this use of the
water of sprinkling mentioned, Numb. 19. 11. that of our Apostle, Heb. 9. 14.
has special Reference, more then Allusion. How much more shall the blood of
Christ purge our Consciences from DEAD works? That this Legal Sacrifice for
sin was an Exquisite Type of Christ's Bloody Death and sufferings, or an exact
picture of his blood, wherewith the heavenly Sanctuary or Holy places were
purified, (although the blood of this Legal sacrifice were not brought into the
Earthly Sanctuary) no good Writers which I have read either deny or question.
That the Water of sprinkling consecrated by the aspersion of the Ashes of this
Legal Sacrifice, did truly resemble the water of Baptism, by which we are
washed from sin, and consecrated unto God as clean persons, that is, made
members of his Church here on earth, is so evident in it self, that it needs no
Paraphrase or Laborious Comment upon the forecited Law. Yet to this purpose
the learned Reader may find much pertinent matter, in Chytraeus his Comments
upon the Book of Numbers, and in many others. It will be more needful or better
suiting with my intentions in this place, to prevent the captious exceptions
which some Anti-Papists have heretofore taken and now resume against the
expressions of our Public Liturgy in that Part of it which concerns the
Administration of Baptism.

Almighty and everlasting God, which of thy great mercy did save Noah and
his Family in the Ark from perishing by water, and also did safely lead
the children of Israel through the red sea, figuring thereby thy holy Baptism;
and by the Baptism of thy wel-beloved Son Jesus Christ, did sanctify the
flood Jordan and all other waters to the mystical washing away of sin. We
beseech thee for thine infinite mercies that thou will mercifully look upon
these Children, Sanctify them and wash them with the holy Ghost; that they
being delivered from thy wrath, may be received into the Ark of Christ's Church,
and being steadfast in faith, joyful through hope, and rooted in charity, may so
pass the waves of this troublesome world, that finally they may come to the
land of everlasting life, there to reign with thee world Without end, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

Seeing now, dearly beloved Brethren, that these Children be regenerate and
grafted into the body of Christ's Congregation, let us give thanks unto God for
these Benefits, and with one accord make our prayers unto Almighty God, that
they may lead the rest of their life according to this beginning.

We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it has pleased thee
to regenerate this Infant with thy holy Spirit, to receive him for thine own
Child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy Congregation, and
humbly we beseech thee to grant, that he being dead unto sin and living unto
righteousness, and being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the old
man and utterly abolish the whole body of sin, that as he is made partaker of
the death of thy Son, so he may be partaker of his resurrection, so that
finally with the residue of thy holy congregation, he may be Inheritor of thine
everlasting Kingdom, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

4. It is no part of our Churches Doctrine or meaning, that the washing or
sprinkling infants bodies with Consecrated water should take away sins by
it is own immediate Virtue. To affirm thus much implies as I conceive a
Contradiction to that Apostolical doctrine. The like figure whereunto even
Baptism does also now save us, (not the putting away the filth of the flesh,
but the answer of a good Conscience toward God) by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, who is gone into heaven etc. 1. Pet. 3. 21. The meaning of our Church
intends no further then thus; That if this Sacrament of Baptism be duly
administered, the blood, or bloody Sacrifice of Christ; or (which is all one)
the Influence of his spirit does always accompany, or is Concurrent to this
solemn Act. But whether this Influence of his spirit or Vertual presence of his
body and blood be either immediately or only terminated to the soul and spirit
of the party Baptized, or have some vertual influence upon the water of Baptism
as a mean to convey the Grace of Regeneration unto the soul of the party
Baptized, whilst the water is poured upon him, is Too Nice and curious a
Question in this Age for sober Christians to debate or contend about. It may
suffice to believe that this Sacramental pledge has a Vertual Presence of
Christ's Blood or some Real Influence from his Body Concomitant though not
Consubstantiated to it, which is prefigured, or signified by the washing or
sprinkling the body with water.

5. But it will be, or rather is Objected, but only by private or some saucy
spirits; That if the Doctrine of our Church were true and sound, then all that
be rightly Baptized should be undoubtedly saved, being once washed or cleansed
from their sins. The Objection were of some force, if the Church of England
did hold or maintain such Doctrine or Tenets, as they do which make or favor
it, to wit, That the sins of the Elect only are remitted by Baptism, or, by the
Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood: or, That sins once remitted cannot be
remitted afresh; or that the Party which is once pardoned for his sins, before
committed, cannot afterward be condemned. The Orthodoxal Truth is, That albeit
the Original Sin of Children truly Baptized in the name of Christ, or the
Actual sins of young or elder men so Baptized, and the sins of their
forefathers (so far as it concerns men of riper years to repent them of both)
be so truly remitted in Baptism, that neither young men nor old may be Baptized
again; Yet the Astipulation of a good Conscience, wherein the internal Baptism
(as St. Peter tells) does consist, may and ought by the Law of God and of
Christ's Church, to be reiterated.

And this Astipulation of every Christian, male or femal, though baptized after
they have passed their Nonage for Civil contracts, Though Baptism may not be
reiterated, yet The Astipulation of a good Conscience (or the Enquireing to
God) may daily, and must often be renewed.
ought to be resumed or re-acknowledged so often as they intend to receive the
Sacramental pledges of Christ's body and blood, either privately or in the
public congregation. But for all such as have been baptized in their Infancy,
the Personal Resumption or Ratification of that VOW, which their Fathers and
Mothers in God, did make for them at the Sacred Laver, is to be exacted of them
Ore tenus, in some public Congregation, before they can be lawfully admitted
to be Public Communicants of Christ's Body and Blood.

6. There is then no default or defect in the Church of England Doctrine or
Laws concerning Baptism, No child or Infant Baptized may or ought to be
admitted unto the Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood before he have in his own
person ratified that VOW, which his Sureties or spiritual Guardians did make
for him at the Sacred Font, where Christ is as ^ruly present as at the
Sacrament of the Altar, as some term it.
or Confirmation of such as have been babaptized in their infancy. But I dare
not avouch so much for justifying the men unto whom the Execution of these
Laws is especially commended, whether they be of Lower, of higher, or of the
highest Rank. It has not been my hap to peruse very many Presentiments of
Churchwardens or Inferior Priests in Visitations; Yet of those few or any,
whereof I have had some Cognizance, I have observed but a very few, or scarce
remember any tendered against the Parents, or such as were Sureties for Infants
at the sacred Font, for not bringing them at convenient times to be Confirmed,
or blessed by the Bishop of the Diocese, or against inferior Ministers for not
Preparing those, the Cure of whose souls was immediately committed to them, to
receive the Confirmation of their Faith, by the Benediction of the Diocesane;
much less against Diocesanes themselves for not executing their office in this
Great Service of the Church either in their own Persons, or by their
Suffraganes.

7. Whether the solemn Baptizing of all Infants, which are the children of
presumed Christian Parents throughout this Kingdom, without solemn
Astipulation, that they shall at years of discretion personally ratify their
Vow in baptism in public, in such manner as the Church requires, be not rather
more Lawful or more tolerable then Expedient, I leave it with all submission to
the consideration of Higher Powers. In the mean time I shall every day bless
my Lord God, as for all others, so in particular for this Great Blessing
bestowed upon me, that I was in a Convenient Age, in a happy time and place,
presented by my Sureties in Baptism, to ratify the VOW which they made for me,
and to receive the Benediction of the Bishop of the Diocese, being first
instructed in the Churches Catechism by the Curate of the Parish, from whose
Lips (though but a mere Grammar Scholar, and one that knew better how to read
an Homily or to understand Hemingius or other Latin Postills then to make a
Sermon in English) I learned more good Lessons, then I did from many popular
Sermons; and to this day remember more, then men at this time of greater years
shall find in many late applauded Catechisms.

CHAP. LI.
Inordinate Liberty of Prophesying brought Errors into the Church, disgraced,
and hindered the Reformation.
1. ALbeit the Reverend Fathers of our Church, and their Suffraganes, should
use all possible care and diligence for performing of all that is on their
parts required; yet without some better conformity of Catechism^, and
reformation of such as write them, or preach Doctrines conformable to them,
there is small hope, that in such plenty of Preachers as now there are, this
work of the Lord should prosper half so well as it did in those TIMES and in
those Dioceses, wherein there were scarce ten able Preachers besides the
Prebendaries of the Cathedral Church under whose Tuition, in a manner, the rest
of the Clergy were. I well remember, and I cannot but remember it with joy of
heart, that the Synods in that Diocese wherein I was bred* did constantly
examine the Licenced Readers how they had profited in learning, by their
Exercises, which they did as duly exhibit unto the Chancellor, Archdeacon, etc,
as they did their Orders or their Fees. Such as had profited well were Licenced
to Preach once a month or once a quarter, having certain Books appointed, from
whose doctrine they should not swarve, but for the most part translate. The
Authors then in most esteem, were Melancthon, Bullinger, Hemingius (especially
in Post^ls and other Opuscula of his) or other Writers, who were most
conformable to the Book of Homilies, which were weekly read upon severe
penalty.

2. But since the Liberty of Prophesying, was taken up, which came but lately
into the Northern Parts (unless it were in the Towns of Newcastle and Barwick,
wherein Knox, Mackbray, and Vdal had sown their Tares) all things have gone so
cross and backward in our Church, that I cannot call the History for these
forty years or more to mind, or express my observations upon it, but with a
bleeding heart. The First Declination from the Ancient Church was, Concerning
the Death and Passion of our Savior Christ; of which the forward Zelots, or
rigid Reformers of Popish merits did make more malicious and scandalous Use
upon Use, then the Papists themselves, or other Heretics, did of any doubtful
or difficult place of Scripture. The people were in a manner taught to believe
that, (...) Credere, to believe this Article was sufficient to Salvation, live
they in the mean time how they list. This foolish Doctrine did begin and
propagate it self in Germany, before Melancthon did correct Luther, or as
Chemnitius thinks, did record his own Recantation. But the infection in the
mean time did so far overspread the Church of England before it heard of the
remedy, that it moved Sir Thomas Moore to lay aside jesting, and deplore the
miseries of his times in earnest, to see men given over to Revelling, Bouzing,
or drinking, or to other worse vices, and yet continue Confident that the
sufferings and Passions of Christ should fully pay the shot, or discharge the
reckoning how great soever it were.

3. It was but an Implicit Branch of the former Error, which at the first did
not break forth in express Terms, to teach men to Believe Secundum (...),
with full Assurance of Faith, that Christ dyed for them in particular, before
they had any assurance that Christ dyed for All men. A strange Conclusion,
which they sought to cover or overshadow with a more dangerous branch of the
same Error, to wit; That every man was to have Fiduciam, or full assurance of
his own Estate in Grace or interest in Christ, not from Gods General promises
made in Him, but from special or Particular Faith. This was that unfortunate
Doctrine which gave such Scandal to the beginning of Reformation in Germany,
that not three hundred Bellarmines, not so many Valentia's, or other learned
Jesuits which have lived since, could ever withdraw the tenth part so many
from Reformed Religion, as Dr. Hessils did withold from embracing it, by
exagitating this Sensual Doctrine as he styles it, as if it had been conceived
or maintained of purpose, that some professing Reformation might continue and
increase their drunken and voluptuous, Others their lascivious and wanton kind
of life; and yet be as sure of their Personal Salvation as either St. Peter or
St. Paul were, during their Pilgrimage here on Earth. This was that Ginne or
Noose which Satan sought to draw upon them, as knowing that he had this kind of
people at greater command, then ever he had any besides. For (as is intimated
in some former meditations published, and in some Others in due time to be
communicated to Learned and Pious Readers) There is not, There cannot be any
possible Evasion out of this snare, but by recanting the former Opinions or
Errors themselves. For every Novice in Arts has Learned, that every Universal
Negative Proposition may be Converted Simpliciter. Now the Scripture gives us
this Universal Negative, again and again; That no Adulterer, no Covetous
Person, no Slanderer or Reviler of his Neighbors, no Seditious or Rebellious
Spirit shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. The other Universal Negative
which they deliver up as their Deed and Writing unto the Father of Lies, and of
all wicked cunning, is This, That no Man which must of necessity enter into
this Kingdom, though he dye this day or to morrow, can be an Adulterer, a
Covetous Person, a Slanderer or Reviler of his Neighbor, or carry a Seditious
Rebellious or Traitorous Spirit to his King and Country. Now by this Noose or
Gin which they have cast for themselves, the Great Tempter can draw or lead
them to all manner of mischief and Hypocrisy, to envenome their thoughts with
malice and slander, with Treason, Sedition, and Disloyalty, and yet assure
them, that they are no Slanderers, no Traitors, etc. but Zealous and Godly
persons, because they must enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

The Last and worst branch of the former bitter Root, is an Assertion which I
never read in any foreign writer, but of late set down in Terminis
Terminantibus by some English Zelots, whose study and practice it has been
either to improve or malignifie Foreign Errors. The improvement of the former
Errors, which Outlandish Writers did rather not take into Consideration then
maintain, is, The Division of all Mankind into Two Sorts, that is, into Elect
and Reprobate. An Error I confess which can do no great harm upon such Saucy
Malepert Vocalists, as have the gift to let the Word of God run as fast out
at their mouths, as it comes into their brains either by the Ear or Eye. But
if it enter once into the thoughts of a Sober Conscientious Spirit, whose brain
and heart have daily intercourse or Commerce, it is impossible but it should
put him into a Dangerous Perplexity, either of being carelessly Presumptuous,
or of falling into utter despair. Experiments of this Later evil have been
more frequent in our Church, and in these times, then in any other Church or
times before us.

4. For Conclusion of this Tragical Consideration, I would request all such as
sit in judicature, specially in Causes Criminal, to call to mind, or suffer Me
to be their Remembrancer, of a Grave saying delivered by a great Praelate in
the high Court of Parliament, That Severitie without instruction is a kind of
Tyranny. More particularly my humble request is, that with good leave I may put
such in mind as judge seditious, turbulent, or enormous practices (or Censure
Fellones de se) that they shall mightily condemn themselves by judging them,
unless they be as forward withal to quell the Erroneous Doctrine (whether by
Laws Ecclesiastical or Civil) whence the former Practices spring, As that kind
of Sedition, Stubborn disobedience, disloyalty, Scandalum Magnatum, or privy
Conspiracy, under whose heavy burden this State and Church does now sigh and
groan. These and diverse other like Branches of the Devils service, are as true
and proper Effects, or natural issues, of the forementioned preposterous
Belief, or Doctrine of Special faith or Division of all Mankind into Two Sorts;
as Christian Charity, Humility, Obedience, Penitencie or Contrition of
Spirit, are of the true and wel-grounded Belief of Jesus Christ and of him
Crucified.

5. The best instructions that can be given for rectifying the former Errors,
is that of our Apostle, Romans 4. (Though we follow the Interpretations or Hints
of those Writers whom these Zelots most admire.) He staggered not at the
promise of God through unbelief: but was strong in Faith, giving glory to God,
and being fully persuaded, that what he had promised he was able also to
perform. And therefore it was imputed to him for Righteousness. Now it was not
written for his sake alone; that it was imputed to him; But for us also to whom
it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from
the dead, who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our
Justification. Verse: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

CHAP. LII.
That Justification Consists not in one Single Act. In what Sense, Fides est
Fiducia, is True.
1. MUst we then with the Romish Church, admit of a First and Second
Justification? One, By Christ's Death; Another, By his Resurrection from the
Dead? or Two Imputations of his Rightcousness? Surely neither Justification,
nor Imputation of Christ's Righteousness Consists in One Single Act; both admit
diverse Degrees or Parts: or rather, contain a Long Process. The best way to
assoyl the Difficulty proposed will be First, to set forth the proper effects
or Duties of our Belief, as it is terminated to Christ's Death and Sufferings.
Secondly, the Proper Issues or Effects of our Belief of his Resurrection from
the Dead. We believe that by his Death our sins, even the sins of the world,
were taken away. That Adam, and All that came of Him, were thus far redeemed
by Him, as to be set Free de^ Jure, from the Bondage of Satan, and purchased as
a peculiar people to himself. Thus we often read, that we are redeemed by his
blood, shed on the Cress; that is, By that One Sacrifice of Himself, the Ransom
of Mankinds Redemption was fully paid. Of this all men are bound to have full
Assurance, and in respect of this General, it is truly said, Fides est Fiducia,
Faith is a Confidence in the Blood of Christ. And thus firmly Believing, our
Faith is imputed or reckoned to Us for Righteousness, as it was to Abraham.

2. But many may be Redeemed from Captivity, and yet have a desire to continue
in the Land or Territories of their former Captivity, or no great desire to be
transported out of it, into a safer soil. Some, with Gryllus in the Poet,
desire rather to continue Swine, then to be Re-transformed into the Image of
God. And unto These, Christ's Death is not available, shall not be imputed,
unless it be to their greater Condemnation. But from the General Confidence
that Christ has redeemed us from the bondage of Satan, and Curse of the Law;
the Church our Mother has wisely and piously ordained, that all professing
Christianity, yea Infants born of Christian Parents, or Others exposed by
their incredulous Parents, to the Tuition of the Church, shall be forthwith
transported out of the Hemisphere of darkness into the Sphere of Light, to be
visibly ingrafted into the mystical Body of Christ. The Duty, whereto all such,
as are thus transported, are bound, is, to promise and Vow Obedience unto
Christ as to their sole Lord and Redeemer, To forsake the Devil and all his
works, the pompes and vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts
of the flesh, and to fight manfully under Christ's Banner unto their lives end,
that is, to take up their Cross and follow him; and as he dyed for them, so to
be ready to lay down their lives for the brethren, if need require, in his
service; or to use our Apostles words Phil. 2. 5. To put on the same mind which
was in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be
equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
of a servant, and was made in likeness of men, and being found in fashion of a
man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the Death of the
Cross. Verse: 6, 7, 8. Another not altogether so diverse, as rather the same
immediate and formal Effect of our Belief in Christ's bloody Sacrifice on the
Cross, is, Daily to offer up the sacrifice of a broken Heart, of an humble and
contrite spirit. And for offering this Sacrifice, every man must in part be his
own Priest, and Confessor, that he may be partaker of the blessing and Grace of
the High Priest of our souls, from his Heavenly Sanctuary where he sits at the
right hand of God.

CHAP. LIII.
Christ's Parable (12. Math. 43. etc.) applied. Two degrees of Reconciliation:
the first Active (or but meere-Grammatically Passive:) The other Real-Passive.
So correspondently, Two Branches of Justification: The One from Christ's Death,
The Other from the benefit of His Priesthood daily participated to us.
1. TO proceed thus far in the Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of Him
Crucified, and in the practice of Christian Duties Concomitant to such
Knowledge, is more, I am afraid, (or rather fully persuaded,) then most of such
as take upon them to seal Assurance to themselves and to others, of their
salvation, (by Marks and Tokens of the Elect, of their own coining) have
rightly got by Heart. And yet to rest secure, upon these Grounds, though
learned by heart, of their personal Salvation or irreversible Estate in Grace
or in Gods Favor, does open a gap unto hellish Hypocrisy, which our Savior
himself has commanded us to beware of, or rather to shut it out, as it is in
that parable, Mat. 12. 43, 44, 45. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a
man, he walks through dry places seeking rest, and finds none; Then he
says I will return into my house from whence I came Out; and when he is come,
he finds it empty swept and garnished: Then goes he, and takes with himself
seven other spirits more wicked then himself, and they enter in and dwell
there, and the last state of that man is worse then the first: Even so shall it
be also to this wicked generation.

For the right application of this Parable to the Jews, with whom our Savior
there disputes, as also unto men of this and former Ages, I referr the Reader
to Jansenius and Maldonate in their Learned Comments upon this place, but
especially to Jansenius.

2. Thus much is sufficient to our present purpose, and thus much is most
clear; That it is not the Sweeping or garnishing of the heart, or emptiness of
such vices, as do reign in the hearts of Infidels, and give Satan possession of
them, (all which may be wrought by the serious consideration of Christ's death
Passion, and by the imputation of his Merits) that can secure us from further
assaults of Satan to our final destruction. Rather, for us to presume upon
these without Experiments, without a continual Guard upon our own souls, is
but as if a man having beaten his adversaries out of his house should set up
his staff, or sword, or other instrument of war without the door to entice
his enemy by this opportunity to make forcible entrance when he is least
aware. To what End then does the Contemplation of Christ's death or the
Imputation of his merits serve us? Do these beget no portion or degree of any
Certainty of our Estate in Christ, or of Salvation? Yes, they always bring
forth a Certainty though not of Faith, yet of Hope, that God in his Good time
will accomplish these good beginnings, and crown them with more then a Moral,
with an Experimental certainty or assurance of our Estate in Grace. For
Regulating our persuasions in this point, there can be no better Rule then that
of our Apostle, Romans 5. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by Faith into
his Grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the Glory of God, ver. 1,
2. And again more fully, ver. 8, 9, 10, 11. God commends his love toward us,
in that whilst we were yet sinners Christ dyed for us. Much more then, being
now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if
when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much
more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only so, but we
also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
atonement. The Ground then of our Hope, or of such Certainty as we can attain
unto in this life, is our Reconciliation to God, of which our Apostle speaks
more fully and divinely, 2 Cor. 5. If any man be in Christ, he is a new
Creature; Old things are past away; behold, all things are become new: and all
things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has
given to us the ministry of Reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Christ
reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them, and
has committed to us the word of reconciliation, ver. 17, 18, 19. But if this
Reconciliation were sufficient for our Certainty of Salvation, what need were
there of a second Reconciliation, or a second part (at least) of the same
Reconciliation, which our Apostle presses upon us, ver. 20. 21. Now then we
are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in
Christ's stead to be reconciled to God: For he has made him to be sin for us,
who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. The
first part of Reconciliation is Active, or at the most part, but a Grammatical
Passive. As a man is said to be Called when he is summoned to appear, though he
make no Personal Appearance: so are we said to be Reconciled to God, when
pardon for our sins is proclaimed, though before we could take notice of it.
The Second Reconciliation is a Real passive, and includes a Turning unto the
Lord by Acceptance of our Pardon, and by serious pursuing the Allowance of it.
The former part of Recenciliation is wrought by mere Imputation of Christ's
death and merits; The second is wrought partly by Imputation, but especially by
Real Participation of Grace from Christ, and gifts of the spirit. These are
They that must defend and guard our souls, against the Re-entry or
Re-possession of Satan and wicked spirits, whether by fair or forcible means.

3. Answerable to the Two Sorts or Degrees of Reconciliation, there are Two
Sorts or two Branches of Justification: The One by mere Imputation of Christ's
Death and Passion, which was once wrought for all, at his Consecration to His
Everlasting Priesthood: The Other, by Participation of his Grace, or Operation
of his Priesthood, since his Resurrection and Ascension. During the time of
Legal Sacrifices, whether for sins against the Ceremonial or Moral Law, the
People were bound upon new occasions, to bring new Sacrifices unto the Priest,
and he bound to offer them up unto the Lord for their Reconciliation or
Atonement. For us Christians to think or conceive of more Sacrifices for sin
then One, that was Once offered for all, were to deny Christ, or the Efficacy
of His Everlasting Priesthood. But as for the Sacrifices of prayers, praises or
thanksgiving for what is past, or supplications for the assistance of Christ's
Spirit for the time to come, These we are bound to offer up to God by Christ
more frequently then the Jews could offer up their bloody Sacrifices, or then
the Priests could attend this service, which they were to attend only at
certain hours or Solemn Times, because they were but mortal men and could not
perform their Office, (...), or (...). But Christ since his Resurrection and
Ascension, is not only an Everlasting High Priest, but does exercise this his
Function without Intermission. Every Priest stands daily ministering, and
offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. But
this (Priest) after he had offered one Sacrifice for sin sat down on the right
hand of God For ever. So the Syriack reads and Points it, much better then the
Ordinary English does, or the Greek, as may appear from a Parallel place, Hebr.
7. 3. (...), He remains a Priest for ever.

4. Briefly, though every sin, perhaps every Gross sin which we commit, after
our Justification by the Resurrection of Christ, and real Participation of his
Grace, does not work a Total Interruption in our Estate, or Interest in him:
yet every such sin does work a decay or diminution of Grace, or some
extinguishment of the Spirit of Life: both which must be repaired by the
Efficacy or Exercise of his Everlasting Priesthood. None is so just whether by
Imputation of his merits, or by Increase of Grace, but may and must be daily
more justified; So that the Son of God does set us free, First, by his
sufferings upon the Cross; Secondly, by the Laver of Baptism and by
Participation of his Life and Spirit; and Lastly, he will set us Free indeed at
the Resurrection of the Just, when we shall be translated into that heavenly
house or mansion wherein he abides for ever.

5. Thus much of the Knowledge of Christ, and of him Crucified, and of the
exercise of his Everlasting Priesthood; Points, wherein I could wish to take
more pains, though to the wasting of my bodily Spirits, upon Condition I could
persuade a great part of the Clergy of this Kingdom, not to make Christ
Crucified and raised from the Dead, a mere By-stander in most of their Disputes
concerning Election, etc. as if he had shed his precious blood to no other
purpose, save only the purchase of their own Salvation, or the Eternal
Excommunication or Damnation of others. Now whether I have justly charged them
with denial of Christ's Everlasting Priesthood, or of his Absolute Dominion or
Final Judicature, I here solemnly appeal unto Him in that great Day when he
shall come (as I verily believe, He shall) to judge the Quick and the Dead; To
reward every man according to all his works, whether his Writings, Sayings, or
Actions.

C. Reader,
THE main Work of the sixth Section was to prepare and clear the way for The
Exercise of Christ's Everlasting Priesthood, by amoving that Great Mountain of
the Rigid Decree, which, in the Authors judgment, did obstruct the general
approach to the Throne of mercy, and the issues of Grace flowing thence: It
making Christ a mere Spectator; at most an Instrument to Execute a Decree
passed before all Worlds, and no Actor, Advocate, or Intercessor. This
following eighth Section treats of Certain Errors which though some of them do
not wholly Evacuate or null, yet do all of them disparage and Entrench upon the
virtue and Efficacy of Christ's Priesthood. Some of them were touched before;
here they are more fully handled.

SECT. VIII.
CHAP. LIVE.
Three Errors Disparaging Christ's Priesthood.
1. The Novatian, denying the Reception of some Sort of Sinners. 2. A Late
Contrary Error, affirming, That every Sin which some sort of men Committ is
pardoned before it be Committed. 3. The Romish Doctrine of the Mass giving
scandal to the Jew. All of them Respectively derogating from the Infinite value
or Continual Efficacy of Christ's Everlasting Priesthood. THe First Error in
this kind which did grow into an Heresy was that of Novatus, Qui negavit
lapsis poenitenti^m, who would not have Backsliders or Revolters from
Christianity, Of Novatus See Eusebius. L. 6. c. 42. and Socrates Lib. 4. chapter 23.
to be upon any Terms or testifications of repentance, readmitted into the
Church, or made partakers of Absolution. This Heresi^ (as all others) took its
Original from a plausi^le Truth or practice of former times. The Truth is, that
in those times wherein men professing Christianity were every day called unto
the Fiery Trial; This Backsliding or Relapse unto Idolatry or outward
Profession of Idolatry, even after Baptism, was so rife, that the Church would
not admit any such as had thus revolted unto the Estate or Condition of
Penitentiaries, nor give them Absolution upon private testifications of sorrow
for their Revolt. Now if Novatus did only deny that unto such backssiders or
Revolters, which the Church in her purest times, would not Grant them; why was
he condemned by the Church in Ages following for an Heretic? If his Opinion
were an Heresy, why was not the Practice of the Ancient Church Heretical? Some
Grave and Learned late Writers, would have the Novatas Heresy, not precisely
to consist in that he denied Absolution, or Communion with the Church unto
Revolters, but in that he maintained, That the Church had no right or Power to
grant Absolution unto such Backsliders as Cornelius then Bishop of Rome (with
the Advice and consent of his Clergy) did grant unto; but that this was a Case
reserved to God himself.

That such Backsliders or Revolters might at the point of death be Absolved,
Novatian himself had once solemnly professed. But after Cornelius, his
Competitioner for the Bishopric of Rome (being preferred to that Dignity) had
authorized this Practice, he begun to set abroach his Error (whatsoever that
were) and to accuse Cornelius, and his adherents, as Authors of Heresy and
Novelties in the Church. Had this Novatian been constant to his former Tenets,
and Profession, made, before Cornelius was chosen Bishop of Rome, against him;
he could not have denied either of these Two Points of Truth: Either that God
had mercy in store, for Revolters from Christianity when they did repent; or,
the Churches Power to grant Absolution, or other comfort spiritual, unto those
to whom she might out of charitable discretion presume God was merciful, or to
whom God had not forbid her to show mercy or compassion. For Christ had
commanded her to be merciful, as her Heavenly Father is merciful.

But it were too much Charity to presume, that a man, of such a proud and
turbulent Spirit, as Novatian was, (in the depth of such discontent as took
possession of his spirit, upon Cornelius his Preferment to so great a dignity
as the Bishopric of Rome, unto his prejudice) would be constant to his former
Principles, either in whole, or in part: As either to grant, that God had mercy
in store for Revolters, or that the Church had power to Absolve them upon such
significations of repentance as belonged unto her Cognizance. Nor, can we
without breach of Charity think, that either Novatian or any other Heretic in
those times, would be so gross as to deny the Churches Power to Absolve men
from any sin, from which they were persuaded God had or would absolve them.
And it is a clear Case that the Novatians did ground their Error, or
Contradiction to the Church wherein they lived, upon that place of the Apostle,
Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, And
have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they
fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to
themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame: and grounding
their Error, or maintaining it, by this place, it is evident, that they held
Lapsos, or Revolters from Christianity unto Heathenism, to be in the same
estate, Which modern Divines conceive all such to b^ in as sin against the Holy
Ghost. But of the true meaning or extent of the Apostles words in the forecited
place, or how the absolute unpardonablness of sin against the holy Ghost, may
be thence concluded, I have nothing for the present to say. It suffices to
know, that this Error of the Novatians, was by the Ancient Church, wherein they
lived, Condemned for an Heresy. Yet hence it will not follow, that their
Heresy (in the Judgment of them which condemned it) did properly or precisely
consist in denying the Churches authority to absolve sins of what kind
soever; but rather in avouching this particular sin of Apostasy or revolting
from Christianity, to be in it self unpardonable, or incapable of Repentance.
If it had been in it self unpardonable, or so adjudged by the Primitive Church:
Navatian had been no Heretic, in withstanding Cornelius Bishop of Rome and the
particular Churches which consented with him, or in denying to admit the
Revolters from Christianity unto the estate or Condition of Penitentiaries in
the Church; or in refusing to give them Absolution, or to hold Communion with
them, after they had voluntarily, or otherwise, observed such a course of Life,
as the Church had appointed for Penitentiaries.

That the Ancient Church did neither admit open Revolters to enter into this
Course or Rule of life, nor Absolve them after they had Uoluntarily, though
most strictly (to the eyes of men) observed it, does no way argue that the
Church in which Cornelius lived, (or which lived after him) did err, much
less incur the Censure of heresy which Novatian objected unto them, in
admitting open Revolters unto the estate and Condition of Penitentiaries, or in
absolving them from their sins after performance of such religious duties, as
were by the Church required of men admitted into that estate or Condition.

2. The Primitive Church did hold both to be lawful but not expedien for the
present Times.
The Primitive Church did deny unto Revolters, Both these Favors [1. Admission
to the state of Penitentiaries: 2. Absolution upon their good behavior after
testification of repentance] only de Facto; not de Jure. The Church in later
times did only alter the Practice or discipline (as is to be presumed) upon
good cause or consideration. And to conclude or limit the Authority of the
present Church, only by Matter of fact, or practice of the Church in former
times, is matter of Heresy, at least of Schism. And this it may be was a
Branch (but not the Root) of Novatian's Heresy. His Radical Error or Heresy
was, in justifying the practice of the former Church, and in Condemning the
resolution of the Church wherein he and Cornelius lived, by the forecited
place of our Apostle, Heb. 6. Or, by his misinterpretation of it, that God
would not be merciful unto such as in time of persecution had denied Christ,
and either by word or practice approved the rites of the heathens: This Sin of
Revolt indeed was a foul and grievous sin, yet not a-like foul and grievous in
all that were guilty of it. But Even the foulest sin that can be imagined is
but a work of the Devil, and there is no work which the Devil can work in man
so foul, which the Son of God, who was manifested to this purpose that he might
dissolve the works of the Devil, is not able to dissolve. Only the full
measure of sin, or of obstinate continuance in foul and grievous sins, is
excluded from repentance, or other benefits of Christ's Passion. Nor is the sin
against the Holy Ghost, for its kind or quality unpardonable, but because it
is always a Symptom of the full measure of sin, or of obstinate and
unrelenting continuance in some sinful course of life.

3. But even this Fundamental Truth [That no sin for it is nature or quality is
unpardonable] through the bad disposition of men has yielded Nutriment to an
error so lately sprung up, that it is not as yet condemned for an heresy,
though in it self as damnable as Novatian's Error was. The Error is this, [That
Every sin which some sort of men commit, is pardoned before it be committed.]
for so the Authors or mainteiners of this Error argue. If Every sin,
especially every grosser sin, which the Elect or men regenerate do commit, were
not forgiven, through the Merits of Christ's Passion: the Elect themselves or
men regenerate, might Totally or Finally fall from Grace, seeing every sin in
its nature deserves Everlasting death. But that the Elect or men regenerate
may either Totally or Finally fall from Grace, or be for the present in state
of condemnation, is the utmost Absurdity or inconvenience, which, in
Divinity, they seek to bring their Opposites unto.

Not to trouble the Church with discussion of the Antecedent, [Whether the
Elect or regenerate may fall from Grace either totally or finally] the Argument
or Consequence is worth the traversing, to wit, [Whether it being granted, that
neither the Elect nor men regenerate can fall from Grace, we must by necessary
Consequence grant, that the sins which men Elect or regenerate do after their
regeneration commit be actually or in particular forgiven before the actual
commission of them:] or, [Whether it were not much better to grant, That men
Regenerate might fall from Grace, then that their sins be in particular
forgiven before they be actually committed by them; If the Connection of these
two were so infallible, that there were a necessity of granting both, by
granting one.] Unto this Querie our Answer is, That if the impossibility of
falling from Grace after regeneration, cannot be maintained without Supposal or
Grant, That their sins are forgiven, before they be committed; or that God
has as it were ante-dated a Pardon for them in particular, from the hour of
Christ's passion; the medicine would be much worse than the disease for which it
is sought. This very Conceit or persuasion, that our sins should be forgiven
before they be committed, will do the soul which harbors it greater harm than
a Total falling from Grace could do it. For a Total falling from Grace, does
neither argue nor occasion just despair of pardon upon repentance; whereas the
misperswasion or prejudicate opinion, that our sins are pardoned before they
be committed, will necessarily puff up our souls with presumption, whose
swelling impostumations are no less deadly than the wounds of despair. Though
most Popes with their followers, blasphemously teach, that with what Facts
soever God himself at any time has dispensed, every Pope, for the time being,
may dispense with the same; and that he may pardon every sin so far and in such
manner, as God the Father and God the Son have pardoned the like: yet some
latter Popes upon suite made to them, have made a Demurre, whether God at any
time since the creation, did grant a Pardon or dispensation for any Fact before
it was committed, which without pardon or dispensation was unwarrantable, or in
its nature damnable. And upon this scruple or Demurr have denied to Ante-date
any dispensation for those Facts or practices which their predecessors had
condemned for heinous sins, unto those persons whose welfare and security
from temporal danger they much tendered, and unto whom they showed themselves
willing to grant a Pardon for those very practices Post factum, which they
would not pardon or dispense withal before they were committed. So that to
deliver it as a point of Orthodoxal Doctrine, that God does freely and
absolutely pardon any particular sins, even of his Elect and dearest children
before they be committed by them, is an Error which transcends, the
Licentiousness of Popery; a Licentiousness which for degrees and malignitie
exceedes the contrary rigorous Novatian error, which denies possibility of
Pardon unto some grosser sins, as unto Relapse unto Idolatry.

4. Yet is this licentious Error but a particular branch, and not the worst
branch of that Fundamental or radical Error before mentioned, which makes, or
strives to make the Individual Nature substance or Entitie, that is in one
word, See his Answer to Mr. B.
the Bare persons of men, the Immediate Object of the Omnipotent irresistible
and immutable Decree, concerning Election and Reprobation. The manner how this
Licentious Error of Ante-dating Pardons for sins, springs from this
Poisonous Root, is conspicuous and palpable. First the Decree of God, as all
grant, is altogether immutable and irresistible: and Secondly the Individual
Nature or Essence of every man, that is, his particular person, is, though not
irresistible, yet indivisible and immutable, It changes not with the
conditions or dispositions of men. For though a man of a young Saint become an
old Devil, though of a civil sober and peaceable man he become a ryotous,
unruly, seditious man, yet he still remains the same person he was: he cannot
plead in Courts of humane justice, that it was another party, not he, which
committed the misdemeanors for which he is questioned. Though his qualities or
conditions alter, yet his Substance or Person alters not; whence, if Gods
immutable decree of Reprobation or Election were immediately terminated unto
men's Individual Natures or Substances, that is, if he had absolutely decreed to
reward some particular men with everlasting Bliss, and others with everlasting
misery, without respect unto their works: this Consequence would be immutable,
infallible, irresistible. Let the one sort live as they list, in Adultery,
Theft, and Murder, they should be saved. Let the others do what they can, sell
all that they have and give it to the poor, fast and pray most days in the
week, they should be damned; yea the Evil deeds of the one should be forgiven
before they were committed; the others good works, or abstinence from Evil
works, should not be capable of pardon; for as Election unto life Eternal, if
it were terminated to men's persons (without respect unto their works) does
include not only a general Ante-dated Pardon for all the sins they can commit,
but priviledgeth them also from all question; so does Reprobation include an
utter exclusion from all hope of Pardon, what course of life soever they take,
if so be it were Terminated to their Persons or Entities, without respect unto
their works.

The Orthodoxal Truth then is, that God has decreed to reward every man
according unto all his works, not according to the foresight of his individual
Nature or Person. And though it be true, that it is impossible for any man to
fall from the estate of Election into the estate of Reprobation, and as
impossible for any man to aseend or be transported from the estate of
Reprobation unto the estate of Election: Yet is it not alike impossible for him
that is for the time present in a Middle State betwixt both, that is, a man
capable of Gods promises in Christ and yet liable to his Judgments, either to
proceed unto the estate of Election, or to fall into the state of Reprobation.
There is a necessity that every Elected man shall be saved, that every man
Reprobated shall be damned, but no like necessity by the Eternal decree, that
This or That particular man shall attain to the state of Election, or fall into
the state of Reprobation. Their works or measure of working whether well or
ill, their faith or want of faith, the measure and manner of both, are not so
immutable or unchangable as their natures or persons are. Now Gods immutable
Decree does infallibly reward them according to the measure, manner, or
quality of their works, or of their faith or infidelity. For albeit the Works
or Acts of man's Faith be Mutable, yet Gods purpose of rewarding every man
according to his works or different measure of faith or infidelity is most
Immutable.

5. But albeit God do not Ante-date any pardon in particular for the sins of
the Elect, is it safe hence to conclude that he is not more favorable unto
them than unto other men? or does his peculiar favor to them, (being granted,)
conclude him to be an accepter of Persons? surely it would; if we did maintain
that his Eternal Decree for showing peculiar favor and mercy toward the
Elect, did respect only men's Persons or Individual substances; But, laying this
Foundation, [That God from Eternity has Decreed to reward every man, not
according to the prevision of his Individual Manhood or substance, but
according to all his works:] Gods peculiar favor may without imputation of
partiality or acceptance of persons, be extended not to the Elect only, but
unto all that are within the Covenant, unto all that without Hypocrisy or
sinister respects, have subscribed unto it. Yet though this peculiar favor be
to be extended to all within the Covenant, we may not deny, but that it reaches
the Elect in an extraordinary measure; for ordinarily none are admitted into
the number of the Elect, which have not done some works which others, not of
that number, have not done. And if God out of his free bounty, reward, not the
men but their works, more bountifully, than he does the works of other men,
whose persons are not within his Covenant, whose works are not so capable of
bounty: he cannot hence be conceived to be a Respecter of Persons, but an
accepter of such in every Nation as work righteousness, or do less evil then
others do. The works which St. Peter requires to the making of our Election
sure, are all in their Nature and quality Good, all, parts of righteousness;
and though we cannot do them aright; yet such as hope to be partakers of Gods
peculiar favor, must be industrious in doing them. But not these works only,
but even our Subscription unto the Covenant of Grace, our Profession of being
Christ's Disciples, is a work capable of mercy, of peculiar favor (in respect
of others which neglect this Covenant) though No work meritorious of Grace, or
of better abilities to proceed in Christianity; nor are the best works of the
Elect in their nature such.

6. Gods gratiousness to the Elect, and his respect to their good works.
First, the good Works which He does that is within the Covenant are more
capable of reward than the like works of men which are without the Covenant:
and yet the good works of the Elect are more capable of reward then the best
works of him that is only within the Covenant, not in the state of Election,
not confirmed in Grace. Secondly, the good Works of men within the Covenant do
facilitate their progress toward Grace, and lengthen their possibilities of
being confirmed in Grace. The good works of the Elect do more then strengthen
their present estate in Grace, they make them capable of greater Glory, than
others Elect are, which work not after the same manner, or measure as they do.
But leaving the Elect and their works to God, who only knows them: the good
works of such as are within the Covenant, though as yet not confirmed in Grace,
do in some degree shelter them from danger of final Apostasy or of exclusion
from Grace. The more good Works such men have done, the better fruits of Faith
they have showed, the firmer they stand in the day of temptation, wherein the
Fruitless hearer shall fall. Thus much is included in the Close of our
Apostles words, Heb. 6. ver. 7, 8. The Earth which drinks in the rain that
comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
dressed, receives blessing from God. But that which bears thorns and briars
is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned. These
Hebrews had come as near to that shelf, upon which others had made shipwreck
of faith, as any men since have done, which have escapt it. And if they had
been to be judged by men according to their present Facts, they had incurred
that dreadful sentence of final Rejection or Reprobation which the Apostle
there denounces against backsliders. What then was the Sheet-anchor, which, in
our Apostles Divinity, did hold them from striking against the immovable rock
of Reprobation? the Merits of their former works? So some great Professors of
Romish Divinity, do teach in their Lectures de Reviviscentia meritorum, that
is of the Revival of merits, being dead or abated by Relapse or Backsliding.
This Title they ground upon this very Text of Scripture, being otherwise
groundless, as they themselves confess. The words of the Apostle are, ver. 9,
10. Beloved we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany
salvation, though we thus speak. For God is not unrighteous, to forget your
work and Labor of Love, which ye have showed toward his Name, in that ye have
ministered to the Saints, and d^minister. Had it been any injustice in God to
have forgotten their former works? if it had, their works were truly
meritorious, or capable of reward by plea of justice. For that work unto which
reward without injustice cannot be denied, is meritorious, or worthy of the
reward; yet the Apostle implies that God should have been (...) unjust, If he
had so utterly excluded these Hebrews from entering into his Rest, as he did
their Forefathers from entering into the land of Promise. For albeit their later
works had been much like their forefathers, yet their former works had been
much better. But in what sense does the Apostle say, (...) God is not unjust?

7. This word Injustus, is sometimes no more than non benignus, or non
misericors, that is, See Book 9. Chapter 12. Numb. 3.
not bountiful, or not merciful, to such as are in misery. Though works of
pity, of bounty, be not works of justice or equity, yet sometimes he that
shows pity or favor, though in Cases wherein the positive Law of God
requires Justice or severe execution, if the case come before the Magistrate,
is said to deal justly, that is, not rigorously, not hardly. So the Holy Ghost
(when he gives the reason why Joseph did not seek publicly to be divorced from
his espoused wife THE BLESSED VIRGIN) says, he did thus resolve, because he
was A Just Man, that is, a Courteous and mild-hearted man: Not a just man
according to strict and Legal justice. For by the positive Law of God, the
crime which he suspected, was punishable not with divorce only, but with death.
If Joseph then in resolving to put away his espoused wife privately, did the
part of a just and upright man, he had been (...), that is, an unjust man in
our Apostles sense, if he had resolved to use the remedy or benefit of the
Law. Yet can no man be said strictly or properly to be unjust for using any
lawful remedy, but non benignus, or non mitis; he may be said to deal
rigorously* or hardly, or uncourteously in using the extremity of the Law. To
apply this Distinction to the Point in question: If God had excluded these
Hebrews from entering into his Rest, after they had accomplished such a measure
of works as the Apostle there intimates, he had not been so merciful and
bountiful unto them, as the Scripture teaches he is to all, he had not showed
himself so gracious a Lord, nor given such encouragements to his other servants
of not being weary of weldoing, as he always uses to do. Briefly, when the
Apostle says (...), the Phrase in the Original is as much as if he had said,
so far is God from being unjust, that you shall find him a most gracious and
Loving Father: so far will he be from forgetting your works and labor of
Love, so far from cutting you off from entering into his Rest, that he will
remember you with his best blessings, even with the blessing of Salvation,
however your late backslidings have deserved the contrary.

But however, God be a Gracious and loving Father to all that call upon him, to
all that are within his Covenant, but especially to his Elect: albeit this his
Gratiousness consists in the not imputing or in remitting of their sins, yet
is there not the least sin, which any within his Covenant, or which any of
his Elect do commit, whose Pardon must not be sought for, after the Commission
of it, and must actually be obtained; otherwise they should dye in their
sins; for though the Son of God did take away the sins of the whole world,
by his sufferings upon the Cross: yet were no man's sins so taken away by
him, or so dissolved as that he from that time did cease, or yet does cease to
dissolve them; whenever they are committed, and their dissolution, by
repentance sought for. Unless he did yet dissolve the works of the Devil in
us, unless he did yet in peculiar manner remit sins; even our petty sins,
would inchain us unto the servitude of Satan. St. J^hn no way excludes the
Elect, but speaks to men regenerate, albeit not to them alone, when he says,
If any man sin we have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous.
1 John 2. 1. Now the Office of an Advocate is to plead his Clients Cause before
his Judge, as either for Justice if his Cause be good, or for mercy or
mitigation of Justice, if his Client be delinquent. God we know is as well a
God of Justice, as of mercy, and has as well one ear open to the Accusations
which are brought against us, as another attentive to the Intercessions, which
are made for us. Satan is our professed Adversary, and, after he has enticed
us to do his work, he never cease to solicit the Execution of Gods Justice
or vengeance upon us. Not the best of Gods Saints may at any time plead their
own cause* or ioyn this Issue with him; Lord Let Justice be awarded with speed,
either for us or against us; either let our Adversary be condemned for
accusing us falsely, or let us be condemned with him, if we have done unjustly.
This were to become not our own Advocates (which yet were presumption) but to
turn Satan's Sollicitors even to suplicate for woe and vengeance upon our own
souls. David has taught us the Form of our Plea with God, even whilst we
stand upon best terms. Lord enter not into Judgment with this thy servant for
no flesh is righteous in thy sight.

9. But will the Almighty Judge of all the world be so unmindfull of his Great
Attribute, as to deny Execution of Judgment upon such as have deserved it,
being thereunto solicited and importuned by his professed Adversary? or will
The Son of God be so Partial as to plead for their acquittal which confess
themselves Guilty of the Crimes Objected? To this we Answer:

1. God has Two Covenants, One of Justice, Another of Mercy. And albeit God
The Father should do us no wrong, no injustice, but do Himself right, if he
did, upon Every accusation, instantly Condemn us: yet seeing His Only Son,
has by a full and alsufficient price, purchased a Reconciliation for us; He
may maintain the plea of Justice, even before the Almighty Judge, against our
Adversary, for us: Or, (having satisfied the Justice of God for all the
sins of mankind) He may Remove our Trial from the Bar of Justice to the
Throne of Grace and mercy. 2. Neither God the Father could deny Execution of
Justice upon us, nor could God the Son plead so much as for our Reprival, if we
should stand upon our own integrity, or our own Justification: so that Our
Confession of Guilt is so far from doing us prejudice, that it is a most
necessary Condition of our Acquittal.

If God the Father then at any time (as hitherto at all times he has done)
defer the execution of Justice upon us, which our adversary daily sollicites
against us, he defers it at the Plea or Intercession of this our Advocate; not
for our own sakes. And it is worth the noteing, that as the reason why the
Psalmist will not have us ioyn issue with our adversary in point of Justice,
is, because No flesh is righteous in Gods sight; so our Apostle, to show that
our Advocate though partaker with us of flesh and blood, is Exempted from this
Universal Negative, enstyles Him by the name of Jesus Christ the righteous. If
He were not righteous, even in Gods sight, He could be no fit Advocate, to
stand betwixt us and Gods Justice, to avert his Judgments from, and draw down
his mercy and blessing upon us.

But in respect of what sins, is Jesus Christ the Righteous said, to be our
Advocate, an Advocate even for the Elect and regenerate? Is he their Advocate,
only in respect of sins committed before their regeneration, or before their
Confirmation in Grace? or an Advocate also for the remission of those sins
which they have committed after their regeneration by Baptism, or after the
increase of Justifying or sanctifying Grace, whether procured by receiving of
Christ's Body and Blood or by other means? If our Advocate he were only in
respect of sins committed before Baptism, or of sins inherent by nature,
the Apostle had not said, If any man sin we have an Advocate, but if any man
has sinned he has an Advocate. or, Intercession is already made for him by
his Advocate. The title which he bestows upon his Disciples [Little Children]
argues them to have been, in his esteem, men regenerate, and more free (as he
hoped) from ordinary sins, than other men, at the least he wrote unto them,
to the end that they should not sin after they had been cleansed from their
sins, but yet he adds [if any man shall hereafter fall into any sin, We (He
says not, YOU; as taking himself included in the number of those which stood
in need of Advocation) have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the
righteous.] This implies that Christ does not cease to execute the Office of an
Advocate for the regenerate, so long as they live here on earth. For it is not
the Office of any Advocate, to plead for the remission of those sins, which
are already remitted, or from which he knows his Clients to be clear
exempted, before they have committed them. If then the son of God make
intercession for the sins of the Elect or regenerate, whilst they live here
on earth, their sins are not remitted, until He have made intercession for
them, nor does He intercede for actual sins till after they be committed.

10. However, if the Son of God be our Advocate only unto God the Father, It
is the Advocate's Office to plead for pardon: The Judge which has Power.
whether in respect of sins past or now present, He as Advocate, does only
plead our Pardon, It is God the Father, then, which must grant the Pardon; and
if every sin be a work of Satan: the pardoning of sin is the Dissolution or
destruction of the work of Satan. How then is it said that the Son of God does
destroy or dessolve the works of Satan in us? As the Almighty Father is said
to have made the world, for he spoke the word and it was made, yet he made it
by the Eternal Word his Only Son: so albeit the Father likewise, do give the
Fiat or Warrant, that our sins may be remitted, or that the works of Satan
may be dissolved in us, yet they must be dissolved by the Son, as immediately by
the Son as the world was Created by the Son. 1 Job. 2. 1, 2.
For this reason the Apostle in the forecited place does not content himself
with the only Title of Advocate, but adds withal, that he is the Propitiation
for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.
He says not, (though that be most true) He has made the Propitiation for our
sin; lest happily any man should hence collect, that all his sins were forgiven
before they were committed, because the Propitiation was made for them before
they were committed. For albeit the Propitiatory Sacrifice was of value
infinite and all-sufficient for the full ransom of the World: yet is it not
sufficient for us which believe, that Christ dyed for us to look only upon the
Propitiation which he then Made for us (for that is past) but upon himself as
he still continues the propitiation for our sins; so says the Apostle, He is
the propitiation for our sins; not only an Advocate to plead for us unto his
Father, that our sins may be remitted, but this request being granted, he is
withal the High Priest which must remit them; and not our high priest only,
but the Propitiation by which Every work of Satan in us must immediately be
dissolved. Again, though all unto whom St. John wrote this Epistle, were not
regenerate, yet it is certain that all such as walk in the light are
regenerate; yet says St. John Chap. 1. 7. If we walk in the light as he is in
the light, we have fellowship one with another; and the blood of Jesus Christ
his Son --, what has it done? Cleansed us from all our sins. Though that be
in a good sense most true, yet our Apostle does not So speak, Lest happily such
as had attained unto this Communion of Saints, or participation with the
Children of Light, being thus far cleansed by Christ's blood, might take
occasion to think, that all their sins, as well those that are to come, as
those which were past, were already pardoned by him, or that they were as truly
cleansed from the guilt of sins future, as of sins already committed and
past. But the Apostle (making himself one of the number to whom he speaks)
says, If WE walk in the light, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all
sin, that is, it never cease to cleanse the Elect or regenerate from the sins
which they never cease, in some measure or other, to committ, or harbor in
them. And if there were not a perpetual Remission of our sins, or if this
cleansing us from our sins by the blood of Christ were not as perpetual and
continual as our Commission of sin is, our Case, even the Case of men
regenerate, would be Lamentable. So far is it from truth, that the sins of
any man be forgiven before they be committed, or that any man is by the blood
of Christ actually cleansed from those sins which as yet have not actually
polluted his soul and conscience, that, as bad Diet casts men into a Relapse of
those diseases from which they had been lately cured, so the sins which we
commit this hour, will call our former sins to remembrance in Gods sight,
until these later as well as the former be actually forgiven, or until we be
actually cleansed from these later by the blood of Christ. I should now proceed
unto the manner how the Son of God does dissolve those works which Satan
works in us after Baptism or regeneration, or how we are actually cleansed
from sin by his blood:

11. The Error of the sacrifice of the Mass.
But here again I find the Truth besett with Two Errors or Extremes, the One
Positive, or an Heresy maintained by the Romish Church, which in effect denies
the infinite value or everlasting Efficacy of Christ's bloody Sacrifice upon
the Cross: The Other Extreme is an Incogitancy of some men which magnisie the
everlasting Efficacy or infinite value of Christ's Bloody Sacrifice, not too
much (for so they cannot) but amiss: they make it everlasting after such a
manner, or rather make such use or application of its everlasting Efficacy or
infinite value, to themselves and to their hearers, as makes his Everlasting
Priesthood, to be useless, or needless. To begin with the First Error or
Extreme.

Is it possible, that, That Church which challenges the Title of Catholic as
her own peculiar, should deny the most Fundamental Article of Catholic Faith,
as is the everlasting Efficacy or infinite value of Christ's Bloody Sacrifice?

In express terms, or directly, she does not deny it, Her Advocates dare not
profess the denial of it. For so most of their Faction whom they lead
blindfold, would forsake them, as Heretics and Aliens from the Ancient and
Orthodoxal Church Yet the more stiffly the greatest Scholars in that Church deny
the imputation or Charge which we lay upon them; the better proof we shall gain
from them, that they are the men, which, as the Apostle says, are given over
to believe Lies; that they are the men, on whose souls the spirit of delusion
has seized; If we shall decypher the impression or Character of that spirit so
clearly, that every one, which is not sworn to their Faction, whether Jew,
Mahumetan, or Heathen, or other more indifferent, though but endued with Common
Reason, may run and read it. Let us see then how they expose the greatest
Mysteries of our Salvation, unto the just scorn and derision of the lew,
Mahumetan, or Heathen, without possibility of Apology for their manifest
contradicting the Principles not of Christianity only, but of Common Reason.
Thus you may imagine any Jewish Schoolboy or young Artist Catechized in the
Rudiments of his own Religion would oppose the greatest Rabbines in the Romish
Church. We of the Jewish Nation, once had our ordinary Priests which offered
sacrifices daily in the temple, we had our high Priest which went into the most
holy place once a year, with the blood of the Anniversary and solemn
sacrifices; ye Christian Catholics (so ye term your selves) teach your
hearers, as your Apostle has taught you, that the best sacrifices which our
Fathers used were but Shadows fore-signifying the taking away of sin, they did
not, they could not take away sins, or cleanse the consciences of such as
offered them; And why could not our sacrifices take away sin? your Apostle
gives this Reason, because they were often offered, Heb. 10. ver. 1. 2. etc. Ye
Christian Catholics have your high Priest, who, as ye say, offered himself up
in bloody sacrifice unto God for your sins; was this his sacrifice perfect,
or was it not? Did it take away sins more perfectly then the sacrifices which
our Fathers used, or did it not? ye say, It did, we say It did not, it could
not: if your Apostles Principles or Expositions of Scriptures be true, and your
practice not false or unlawful. Your Priests (as you confess) stand daily
ministering and offering the same sacrifice, which your high Priest did offer,
and therefore by your Apostles argument against us, and by your practice, this
sacrifice can never take away sin: it is more the same sacrifice than the
sacrifices of the Law were, And yet it is offered oftener and in more places
than any Legal sacrifices were.

12. Some devoted to the Romish religion will perhaps say in their hearts; the
Doctors of our Church know well enough how to untye these knots, which the
Jews cast; albeit so learnedly and so subtly, that no unlearned man can
perceive how they untye them. If men will thus believe or rely upon their
Teachers skill without any true experiment of it; we cannot help it. Yet if you
will believe me upon the faith of a Christian, I never yet could see any Romish
Writer, which leaves not the former knot worse then he found it, after he had
used all the pains and skill he had to untwist it. The wisest and most learned
of them, usually let it slide away without meddling. Many of you perhaps have
read what the Rhemists in their Notes upon the tenth to the Hebrews, have
attempted, To make you believe that all is loose: The Apostle (say they)
speaks of the sacrifices of the Law, not of the sacrifice of the Mass. It is
true indeed, he speaks of the sacrifices of the Law, for he proves them to be
unperfect, unsufficient: but he proves them to be unsufficient by such a Reason
as will conclude more strongly, not only against the sacrifice of the Mass, (if
so the sacrifice of the Mass, were as lawful as the Legal sacrifices
sometimes were, or the Reiteration of it, not more abominable in the sight of
God, then the restoration of Legal bloody sacrifices at this day would be:)
But against Christ's bloody sacrifice upon the He means, if it needed to be
often offered.
Cross, also. The only Reason by which the Apostle proves the best kind of
Legal sacrifices, even whilst they were lawfully used and according to Gods
appointment, to have been altogether unsufficient for taking away sin, is,
because they were to be often offered: Now every particular must be proved by
an universal, and A true universal Rule or Principle includes the same reason
in every particular. The Apostle could not prove the Legal Services to have
been imperfect for this Reason, that they were often offered, unless this
Universal were true and taken by him as granted, [That no sacrifices or
sacrifice of what kind soever which is often offered can be perfect or
sufficient to take away sins.] This universal Reason the Apostle takes as
granted by Light of Nature and Common Reason, and so frames his Argument from
the Authority of Scriptures, and the consonancie of Common Reason or light of
nature, ver. 15. The Holy Ghost ALSO is witness, etc.

It is as idle and as frivolous a shift wherewith the same Rhemists seek to put
off their ignorant Readers, when they tell them, that, Christ's body was but
once offered up in a bloody manner, but may and ought to be often offered up in
a bloudless manner. The very root and ground of this distinction if you examine
it by our Apostles Argument, includes a confession or acknowledgement of the
CRIME or HERESY which we object unto them, to wit, that The bloody Sacrifice
of the Son of God, is not by their doctrine of infinite value, nor of force and
virtue everlasting, but infinite only secundum quid, (i. e.) infinite in the
Nature of a bloody sacrifice, not so simply infinite as to exclude all other
sacrifice or offering for sin. For if it had been of value infinite, or
All-sufficient to take away sin whilst it was offered up in a bloody manner,
there had been no more offering, either required or left for sin, whether a
bloody or a bloudlesse offering, whether after a bloody or a bloudless manner;
for if Once offered it were in the nature of an offering infinite, it
necessarily took away all other offerings, or manner of offering for sin.

A Note Relating to the precedent Chapter.
EUsebius, Socrates, and Theodoret amongst the Greeks: Primasius, and Austin
amongst the Latins do not distinguish betwixt these two Ominous names,
Novatus, and Novatianus. But St. Cyprian, in his 49. Epistle, shows plainly
that they were of two distinct persons, though agreeing too well in Schism and
Heresy. Novatus was an African (new Monster,) a Preshyter in the Church of
Carthage, (where S. Cyprian was Bishop) vir sui nominis; for he was Rerum
novarum semper Cupidus, disobedient to his Bishop, spightful against the Order,
unnatural to his Father (who dyed for hunger and lay too long unburied)
unfaithful to the Orphan, the Widow, the Church-stock, unkind to his wife,
whom he made to miscarry with a kick. (Damnat sacrificantium manus ipse
nocentior pedibus, says S. Cyprian.) Thus qualified, fearing Excommunication,
He fled to Rome, and joined with Novatianus a Roman Presbyter, who was, about
that time, brewing his Schism against Cornelius Bishop of Rome: These Two were
the Ringleaders of the Sect of the Cathari. See S. Cyprian. Epist. 49. (and
Epist. 51. 52.) with Rigaltius his Notes.

CHAP. LV.
From the Text, Heb. 10. ver. 1, 2, 16, 17. And from this Maxim, [That Christ's
One Sacrifice of himself was of Value absolutely Infinite;] it follows not,
That such as worship God in Spirt, or, such as are received into The Covenant
of Grace have their sins remitted before they do committ them.

That Doctrine makes Christ's Resurrection useless (in respect of us;) and
Baptism needless. Legal worshippers Conscious, and their sins remembered in
such a sort as Evangelical worshippers are not. The vast Odds betwixt Christ's
One Sacrifice and the Many Legal. We must distinguish betwixt the Infinite
value and Infinite virtue of Christ's sacrifice.

The precious Effects of H. Baptism, and the Eucharist, flowing from the
Efficacy of Christ's Sacrifice and Priesthood. How Legal Sacrifices, etc, did
prefigure Christ's.

1. BUt unto men which have not their Senses exercised in the Prophetical and
Evangelical Writings, or in the Harmony betwixt them; the words of the Apostle
in that tenth Chapter to the Hebrews, An Objection made.
ver. 1, 2 16, 17. do minister some scruple.

His words, ver. 1, 2, are these. The Law can never, with those sacrifices
which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto
perfect; For then would they not have ceased to be offered, because the
worshippers, (that is, such as were observers of the Legal worship only;)
should have had no more conscience of sin. From this Opposition between the
condition of Gods people under the Law, and the Condition of his people under
the New Covenant, that is, of such as worship him not by Legal Sacrifices, but
in the Spirit, it may seem to be concluded, that such as are within the
Covenant of Grace, or worship him in spirit, have their Sins remitted before
they can commit them, or as soon as they begin to worship God, not by Legal
sacrifices, but in the spirit. For if the sins of men thus qualified were not
remitted before they were received into the Covenant of Grace, or at least at
the time when they were thereunto admitted, they should at least have as much
(if not more) Conscience of sin, as the Legal worshippers had.

2. This Scruple or Question, which the words of the Apostle, ver. 1, 2. do
minister, may be fortified or Augmented from the same Apostles Inference ver.
17. And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. This is the
Privilege of such as are within the New Covenant. Fortified.
Now, if according to the Tenor of this privilege, God will no more remember
their sins and iniquities who are comprised within the new Covenant, the
cause or Controversy may seem concluded, that God will neither punish their
sins, nor question them for them. For all punishment of sin, all inquisition
after sin, does include or presuppose a Remembrance or Cognizance of the sins
for which men are punished or questioned.

Both these Scruples may receive strength or Countenance from that general
Maxim unto which we willingly subscribe [That the bloody sacrifice whereby this
new Covenant was made and ratified, Reinforced.
was of value absolutely infinite, for taking and putting away sins.] And how
could it possibly be of value infinite for taking away sins, unless the sins
of all, all their sins for whom it was offered, were by it taken away or
remitted; So taken away, that they should be no more remembered in Gods sight,
that They should have no more Conscience (or horror) of sin?

3. Answered.
The clear and unquestionable Points of Truth, included in the Apostles words,
are but Two.

The Former, That the Legal Worshippers were conscious of sin in such a sort as
the Evangelical worshippers, or men comprehended under the new Covenant, are
not conscious.

The Second, that God did remember the sins of such as were under the former
Covenant, after such a manner as he does not remember their sins who are
under the new Covenant of Grace. But for the Distinct meaning of the Apostle,
that is, how far the Legal worshippers had a consciousness of sin; how far
the Evangelical worshippers have none; In what sort, measure, or manner God did
remember the sins of his people under the Old Covenant, and not remember the
sins of his people under the new Covenant of Grace, we can have no better
scantling, no more indifferent standard, than the words of the same Apostle in
the same tenth Chapter, ver. 3. But in those sacrifices (to wit which were
offered by the Law,) there is a remembrance (or commemoration) of sin made
every year. But wherein did this Annual Remembrance or Commemoration of sin
consist? The Law, as the Apostle elsewhere speaks, was but a Schoolmaster
unto Christ; and the Lessons, which this Schoolmaster, did, by the Annual, or
other, bloody sacrifices especially, teach, were these: That the men, by whom
or for whom these bloody sacrifices were offered, had deserved, and as often
as they offered them did deserve, to be tormented and mangled as these
sacrifices were. That the ^utchery of Them was but Favorabilis commutatio
poenae, a favorable exchange or diverting the punishment from themselves upon
these bruit Beasts: That whiles the fire under Gods Altar did continue, Gods
Wrath against sin and sinners was not appeased, nor could be appeased by
this kind of bloody sacrifices. All this the yearly and daily offering of
bloody sacrifices, did clearly testify unto the consciences of such as offered
them. And that so often as God required these sacrifices, he did call their
sins unto remembrance, and as it were by matter of Fact proclaim unto the
World, that as yet, his Wrath against sin was not, could not be appeased, by
these or the like kind of Sacrifices. But inasmuch as the Law, though in
itself imperfect (and therefore could make nothing perfect) was yet an
Introduction to a better Hope; the continual reiteration or repetition of these
bloody sacrifices did teach such as used them aright, to expect a more
sufficient bloody sacrifice, which should fully appease the wrath of God, and
Testify unto men's consciences, that he did remember their sins no more, in
such sort as during the time of the Law he had done; that is, there should be
no more exchange or commutation of punishment, no solemn remembrance of sin,
by any sacrifice (of what kind soever) for sin, but this one sacrifice should
suffice for all.

4. That we may ascend by degrees unto the infinite value and everlasting
Effi^acie of the sacrifice of the son of God, we are in the first place to
consider the odds or difference between this only Sacrifice and the sacrifices
of the Law. The odds or differences between them may be reduced unto these Two
Heads: First, To the Diversity of their immediate Effects: Secondly, To their
different Efficacy or proportion for effecting the several Ends to which they
were especially destinated. 1. The Immediate effect of the bloody Sacrifices of
the Law, was to cleanse or purify the offerers from sins committed against
the Law of Ceremonies, and this (as the Apostle terms it) was a Purification
or Sanctification according to the flesh. Howbeit, this Sanctification was a
shadow or picture of that purification of the Conscience or Sanctification of
the Spirit, which was to be effected by the bloody Sacrifice of the Son of God.
2. The sacrifices of the Law were no way so Powerful or sufficient for
effecting the Sanctifying of the flesh, as the Sacrifice of the Son of God is
for effecting the Sanctification of the spirit and Conscience. There was no one
kind of Legal sacrifices, which might make a full atonement for all sins or
sinners against the Law of Ceremonies. For every different sin or legal
uncleanness they had (for the most part) a different kind of sacrifice or
offering. And if a man had been this day cleansed by sacrifice from some
particular sin or legal uncleanness, and had fallen again unto the like to
morrow, the blood of the former sacrifice could not stead him the second time:
Every particular relaps into the same sin, was to have a particular offering or
fresh Sacrifice, though of the same kind with the former.

5. The infinite value of the Bloody Sacrifice of the Son of God, may, from
this imperfection of the legal sacrifices, be distinctly apprehended, if we
consider, that not the Jew only but the Gentiles, one and other, were Enemies
and rebels against God, all by nature the sons of wrath and perdition, and
yet the favor of reconciliation for all that then were, or afterward should
be (albeit this world should continue a million of years) was purchased by this
one bloody Sacrifice, as by a just and full price. What sins soever any man
had committed, they did not prejudice his Interest in the pardon purchased; it
was universal in respect of al sinners, and in respect of all sins; The
Almighty Father's wrath against mankind, was by this Only Sacrifice so well
appeased, so fully satisfied, that he is ready to receive all into the favor
and Privilege of sons, which will with due reverence accept of the Pardon
offered, and sue it out by such means as he has appointed. Now this Universal
Favor, for all men* to whom nothing but vengeance was in Justice due, could
not possibly be purchased by any Sacrifice, which was not of Value absolutely
infinite. But to grant an absolute Pardon, not only for all sins past,
before the acceptance of the Pardon, but for wilful obstinacy or continuance
in sin or rebellion after so Gracious a Proclamation of Pardon, could be no
Effect of Gods infinite Mercy, no Fruits of Christ's infinite Merits. For,
infinite Merits cannot benefit men altogether unqualified or incapable of them.
And Mercy infinite must retain the nature of mercy; it reaches not beyond the
proper Object of mercy: And the proper Object of mercy, is penitencie or sorrow
for Misdemeanors past or present. Wilful continuance or obstinacy in
exorbitant courses or contempt of mercy offered, is the Object of Justice or
indignation.

6. But besides the Infinite Value, we are to acknowledge the infinite or
Everlasting Efficacy, or Operative Virtue of this bloody Sacrifice of the Son
of God. Want of distinguishing between these two has occasioned many Errors
or oversights in Divinity: That there is a Distinction to be put betwixt them,
we may thus conceive. Suppose the Son of God, immediately after he had paid
the ransom for our sins, or in that Instant in which he said, Consummatum
Est, all is finished, had deposed or laid aside the humane nature, in which he
was conceived and born to the end and purpose that he might dye in it (or
according to it,) his offering or Sacrifice had been of Value infinite, in that
it could purchase so Universal a Pardon at Gods hands for all sinners, and for
all sins. Yet if he had laid aside the humane nature immediately after his
suffering, The Everlasting Efficacy of this infinite Sacrifice had been cut
off. Now besides the infinite price of our redemption which was then Paid when
Christ said Consummatum Est, another End of his assumption and retaining the
humane nature, was, that we might be partakers of the Everlasting Virtue of his
Sacrifice and Priesthood. And herein does this Sacrifice truly differ from the
sacrifices of the Law, from all sacrifices whatsoever, in that we obtain
remission of sins by it, and through it, not only as it was once offered,
but by the real Communication of its Virtue unto our souls. If there were any
use or need of a second, third, or reiterated offering of it, the Virtue and
Efficacy of it could not be imagined to be perpetually everlasting or
Uncessant, but endless or uncessant only by Vicissitude or Turn, in such a
sense as we say, the Moon shall be Eclipsed to the worlds end; Yet is it not
eclipsed at all times, but at some special times, throughout all Ages of the
world. But if both the Value of the Sacrifice be truly infinite, and the
Virtue of it everlasting without interruption or discontinuation, more
Uncessant than the Motion of the heavens, or the Rest of the earth: The often
offering of the Sacrifice, after what manner soever, is superfluous and
blasphemous. The true reason then, why the Body of Christ is not, or ought not
to be often offered, is, not because all our sins were actually remitted by
the once offering of it, or remitted before they were committed: but because
the substance or matter of the sacrifice, is of the same force, at this day, to
remit sins, that it was of, whilst it was offered. For his humane nature was
consecrated by death and by his bloody Passion, to be a sacrifice of
everlasting Virtue, to be the continual propitiation for our sins.

7 If either the actual sins of all men, Christ's Resurrection, our baptism
needless; if sins be remitted before they be committed.
or the sins of the Elect in special, had been so remitted by Christ's death
as some conceive they were, that is, absolutely pardoned before they were
committed; there had been no end or use of Christ's Resurrection in respect of
us; no need of Baptism: yet was Baptism, from the hour of his resurrection,
necessary unto all that did believe in his death and resurrection. The urgent
and indispensable necessity of Baptism, especially in respect of actual
beleivers, is not any where more Emphatically intimated, than in St. Peter's
Answer to the Jews, Whose hearts were pierced with sorrow that they had been
the causes of Christ's death. They, in this stound or sting of Conscience
demand, Men and brethren what shall we do? and Peter answered them, Repent and
be Baptized Every one of you, In the Name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
sins. And they that gladly received the word, were Baptized the same day.
Acts 2. 37, 38, 41. These men had been deeply tainted with sin, not original
only, but with sins actual of the worst kind: guilty they were in a high
degree of the death of the Son of God, yet had they as well their actual as
their original sins remitted by Baptism. It is then an unsound and imperfect
Doctrine, that sin original only is taken away or remitted by Baptism; for
whatsoever sins are remitted or taken away by Christ's death, the same sins
are in the same manner remitted and taken away by Baptism into his death;
actual sins are remitted in such as are guilty of actual sins, when they
are baptized, though only sin Original be actually remitted in those which are
not guilty of actual sins, as in Infants. No man's sins are actually
remitted, before he be actually guilty of them.

8. The Question is, how either sin original is remitted, or how any work of
Satan is dissolved by Baptism, And this Question in the General is righly
resolved, by saying, They are remitted by faith. But this general Resolytion
suffices not, unless we know the Object of our Faith in this particular. Now
the particular Object of our Faith, of that faith by which sins (whether by
Baptism or otherwise) are remitted, is not our general Belief in Christ: even
our belief of Christ dying for us in particular, will not suffice, unless it
include our Belief of the Everlasting Virtue of his bloody Sacrifice, and of
his everlasting Priesthood for purifying and cleansing our souls. No sins
be truly remitted unless they be remitted by the Office or exercise of his
Priesthood; and whilst so remitted they are not remitted by any other
Sacrifice then by the sole virtue of his body and blood, which he once offered
for all, for the sins of all. It is not the Virtue or Efficacy of the
consecrated water in which we were washed, but the virtue of his Blood which
was once shed for us, and which by Baptism is sprinkled upon us, or
communicated unto us, which immediately cleanses us from all our sins. From
this everlasting Virtue of this his bloody Sacrifice, Faith, by the ministry
of baptism is immediately gotten in such as had it not before. And in such as
have Faith before they be baptized, the guilt of Actual sins is remitted by
the exercise or Act of Faith, as it apprehends the everlasting Efficacy of this
sacrifice, and by the prayer of faith, and supplication unto our High Priest.
Faith then is as the mouth or appetite by which were receive this food of Life,
and is a good sign of health, but it is the food itself received, which must
continue health and strengthen spiritual life in us; and the food of life is no
other then Christ's Body and Blood, and it is our High Priest himself, which
must give us this food.

Baptism, says St. Peter, 1 Pet. 3. 20. does save us: what Baptism does save
us? not the putting away the filth of the flesh (yet this is the immediate
effect of the water in baptism) but the answer (or stipulation) of a good
conscience toward God. But how does this kind of Baptism, or this concomitant
of Baptism, save us? The Apostle in the same place tells us, by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ: The answer or stipulation of a good conscience,
includes an illumination of our spirits by the Spirit of God; a qualification,
by which we are made sons of Light, being before the sons of darkness. But,
That by this qualification we become the sons of Light; That this
qualification is by baptism wrought in us; That by this qualification however
wrought in us, we are saved from our sins; All this is immediately from the
virtue of Christ's Resurrection. That is, as you have heard before, he was
consecrated by the sufferings of death to be an everlasting Priest, and by his
resurrection from death, his body and blood became an everlasting Propitiation
for sins, an inexhaustible Fountain of Grace, by which we are purifyed from
the dead works of sin.

9. It is true again, that in the Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood, there is
a propitiation for our sins, because He is really present in it, who is the
propitiation for our sins. But it no way hence follows, that there is any
propitiatory sacrifice for sin in this Sacrament. He becomes the propitiation
for our sins, he actually remits our sins, not directly and immediately by
the Elements of Bread and Wine, nor by any other kind of Local Presence or
Compresence with these Elements, than is in Baptism. The Orthodoxal Ancients
use the same Language, for expressing his Presence in Baptism and in the
Eucharist; they stick not to say, that Christ is present or Latent in the
water, as well as in the Elements of Bread and Wine. Their meaning is, that
neither of these Elements or sensible substances, can directly cleanse us from
our sins by any virtue communicated unto them or inherent in them, but only
as they are pledges or assurances of Christ's peculiar presence in them, and of
our true investiture in Christ by them. We are not then to receive the Elements
of bread and wine only in remembrance that Christ dyed for us, but in
remembrance or assurance likewise that his body which was once given for us,
does by its everlasting Virtue preserve our bodies and souls unto everlasting
Life, and that his blood, which was but once shed for us, does still cleanse us
from all our sins, from which in this life we are cleansed, or can hope to be
cleansed. If we then receive remission of sins or purification from our
sins in the Sacrament of the Eucharist (as we always do when we receive it
worthily;) we receive it not immediately by the sole serious remembrance of his
death, but by the present Efficacy or operation of his body, which was given
for us, and of his Blood which was shed for us.

10. The reason why the blood of Bulls and of Goats had no longer force or
efficacy to cleanse men, though but from sins against the Law of Ceremonies,
then whilst they were offered, was, because their blood was corruptible blood,
and did perish with the using. But we are not redeemed, says S. Peter, 1 Pet.
1. 18.
with corruptible things, as silver, and Gold, but with the precious, blood of
Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish or without spot. One part of the
pretiousness of his blood is, that it is far more incorruptible then silver,
gold, or other precious metal, and the less corruptible any metal is, the
more precious it is; and the more precious it is the more uncorruptible.

Though Christ then was truly mortal when he dyed for us, yet the blood that he
shed forth for us at his death, did not become like water spilt upon the
ground, which cannot be gathered again; it did not vanish or consume as the
blood of Legal Sacrifices did; as his Body so his Blood was, not to see or feel
corruption: not a drop of Blood which was shed for us, whether in the Garden or
upon the Cross, but was the blood of the Son of God; but was shed by him, as
willing at this price to become the everlasting High Priest of our souls: and
not a drop of Blood which was so shed did cease, or shall ever cease, to be the
blood of the Son of God. His soul and body we know were disunited by death:
yet were neither of them disunited from his Godhead or Divine Person. His Body
whilst laid in the grave, was still the Body of the Son of God, as still
retaining Personal Union with his Godhead: So was his soul, so was his Blood,
the soul and Blood of the Son of God, as being indissolubly united to his
Divine Person. Though his blood, whilst it was shed or powered out, did lose
its Physical or Local Union with his body, though one portion of it were
divided from another, yet no drop of it was divided from his infinite Person.
And that which the Romish Church would transfer unto each several crum of
bread or drop of Wine in the Eucharist, is Originally and properly true of the
several drops or divisibilities of Christ's Blood which was shed for us; whole
Christ was in every one of them, indivisibly in every one of them God was, the
Godhead was and is personally united to all of them.

11. Whether all and every portion of his blood which was then shed, were, by
the power of the Godhead, recollected and reunited to his Body, as his Body
was to his Soul at the resurrection, See Chap* 46. Numb 2.
we cannot tell; God knows. But this we know and believe, that the self same
blood which was then shed, whether it were gathered together again, or remained
dispersed, whether it were reunited to his Glorified Body or divided from it,
is still united to the Fountain of Life, to the Godhead in the Person of the
Son. And being united to this Fountain of Life (who dwells in it, as light
within the body of the Sun) it is of Efficacy everlasting; it has an immortal
power or force to dissolve the Works of Satan in us, as well those which he
works in us after Baptism as before. The Virtue of it, to cleanse and purge
us from our sins (of what kind soever) is, at this day, as sovereign, as if
it had been sprinkled upon our souls, whilst it issued out of his body. It is
impossible it should lose its Virtue in or upon our souls, unless we first
lose our Interest in it, which we cannot lose but by abandoning the ways of
light, and polluting our souls with the Works of darkness. For so long as we
walk in the light, the blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God, does cleanse us
from all our sins.

12. 1 John 1. 7.
This present Efficacy of Christ's body and Blood upon our souls, or real
Communication of both, I find as a truth unquestionable amongst the Ancient
Fathers, and as a Catholic Confession. The Modern Lutheran and the modern
Romanist have fallen into their several Errors concerning Christ's presence in
the Sacrament, from a common ignorance; neither of them conceive, nor are they
vvilling to conceive, how Christ's body and blood should have any Real
Operation upon our souls, unless they were so Locally present, as they might
Agere per contactum, that is, either so purge our souls by Oral Manducation,
as Physical Medicines do our bodies (which is the pretended use of
Transubstantiation) or so quicken our souls as svveet odours do the Animal
spirits, which were the most probable use of the Lutheran Consubstantiation.
Both the Lutheran and Papists avouch the Authority of the Ancient Church for
their opinions, but most injuriously. For more then we have said, or more than
Calvin does stiffely maintain against Zuinglius and other Sacramentaries,
cannot be inferred from any speeches of the truly Orthodoxal or Ancient
Fathers; They all agree, that we are immediately cleansed and purifyed from our
sins by the blood of Christ; That his humane Nature by the inhabitation of
the Deity is made to us the inexhaustible Fountain of life. But about the
particular manner how life is derived to us from his humane Nature, as whether
it sends its sweet influence upon our souls only from the heavenly Sanctuary
wherein it dwells as in its Sphere; or whether his blood which was shed for
us, may have more immediate Local presence with us, they no way disagree,
because, they, in this kind, abhorred curiosity of dispute. As for Vbiquitie
and Transubstantiation, they are the two Monsters of modern times, brought
forth by ignorance, and maintained only by Faction.

And thus much of the infinite value and everlasting Virtue of Christ's
Sacrifi^e in comparison of Legal Sacrifices. The next Querie, is, How the
everlasting Efficacy of his Sacrifice, or of his Priesthood was prefigured by
Legal Sacrifices or purifications for sin.

13. The Legal sacrifices, as all agree, did generally foreshaddow Christ's
Only and All-sufficient Sacrifice. But in as much as they were corruptible and
their virtue transient, and by reason of their corruption and transient virtue
were often to be reiterated: they could not be so much as true shadows either
of his offering of Himself once for all, or of the everlasting virtue of his
Only Sacrifice once offered. Their imperfection, corruption, or transient
virtue, did serve as foyles to set forth the glory and splendour of his
everlasting Sacrifice, and most perfect offering. Of all the Legal Sacrifices
which present themselves unto my former observation, or present memory, there
is one kind only which can bear the true shadow or serve as a Model of the
Everlasting Efficacy of his only Sacrifice once offered for all. And that was
the sacrifice of the Red Heifer, Numb. 19. and the Legal Use which GODS People
under the Law were to make of Her Ashes.

The correspondencie between the effects of the Ashes of this sacrifice and of
the blood of Christ is gathered by our Apostle, Heb. 9. ver. 13, 14. If the
Ashes of an Heyfer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctif^eth to the purification of
the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
spirit offered himself to God, purge your consciences from dead works to serve
the living God. But wherein did this sacrifice picture out the Everlasting
Efficacy of the Blood of the Son of God, in more peculiar manner than other
Legal sacrifices did?

14. First, in that all such as were legally unclean by touching a Corpse or
Grave, by coming into a Tent wherein a Corpse lay unburied, or suffering the
vessels in such a Tent to be uncovered, were to be purified by the Water of
Sprinkling which was qualified or consecrated to this purpose by the Ashes of
the Red Cow or Heyfer: and as often to be purified by this water as they should
incur this Legal uncleanness. And yet the sacrifice of this beast was not to
be offered so often as this people did incur these Kinds of legal
uncleanness. Thus much is Evident from the practice of the Jewish Church during
the time of the Law.

For this water of purification was often every year, oft-times Every month to
be sprinkled upon some one or other of this people, oft-times upon one and the
same man within one and the same year, even as often as he should by chance, or
negligence incur any of the former branches of uncleanness. Yet was not this
sacrifice, whose ashes were still to be mingled with the water of purification,
to be offered once Every year, in every Age, or in many Ages. The Sacrifice of
the Red Heyfer, as the Jews confess, was but nine times offered during the
time of the Law; Once by Eleazar Aarons Son in the wilderness. And this
sacrifice was not reiterated until the destruction of Salomons Temple, that
is, not during the space of a thousand years and more. It was the Second Time
offered by Ezra after this peoples Return from Captivity, and but seven times
after, unto the destruction of the second Temple. And this Foolish Nation since
that time has not presumed to offer it, but expects the offering of it the
tenth time by their King Messiah* Thus is the faithless Synagogue, by Gods
providence, the Keeper, not of the Sacred Oracles only written by Moses and
the prophets, but even of those Traditions which testify the sum and truth
of these Oracles, to wit, that this legal sacrifice, amongst the rest, was to
be accomplished in their Messiah: He was indeed to set the Period to this legal
Rite, and to all the rest, not by offering them after a Legal Rite or manner,
but by offering up himself instead of them all, once for all, in bloody
sacrifice, in whose infinite Value and Everlasting Efficacy all other
sacrifices or offerings for sin, were so terminated or swallowed up, as
Land-rivers or currents of waters are in the sea. But what circumstance have we
from the written Text, that this sacrifice was not to be so often offered, as
this people had occasion to use the water of sprinkling or the Ashes of this
sacrifice to cleanse them from their former Legal pollutions? Numb. 19.
It is said ver. 9. that the Ashes should be laid up without the Camp in a
clean place, (...), and reserved or kept for the congregation of the children
of Israel for the water of separation. The Ashes were to be reserved, not for
this Generation only present, but for the use of Posterity. As Manna, which
was commanded in the same Character to be reserved in the Ark, was the Type of
Christ as he is the food of life, or the bread which came down from heaven; So
were these Ashes as an Emblem of the Everlasting Efficacy or operative virtue
of his sacrifice. There is no Bodily substance under heaven, which can be so
true an Emblem or model of incorruption as Ashes are. Being the Remainder of
bodies perfectly dissolved or corrupted, they are not capable of a second
corruption. And when it is said, that the Ashes should be reserved for a water
of separation, the meaning is, that one sacrifice might afford ashes enough to
season or qualify as many several vessels of water, as this people for many
generations should have occasion to use for Legal purification. So it is said
in the same ninth verse, that the Reservation of these Ashes was a Purification
for sin. A purification, not in Act only, or for one or two turns, but a
Continual Purification: or as a Treasury or storehouse for making as many
purifications or waters of sprinkling as this people had occasion to use. And
so Christ is said Heb. 1. 3. to have made a purification for our sins; when
he had by himself purged our sins (says our English) he sat down on the
right hand of the Majesty on high. But the Translation (under Correction)
comes somewhat short of the Original, and the shorter it comes of it, the more
advantage it yields unto their opinion which think their sins were remitted
and purged before they were actually committed. The Apostles words are, (...),
having made a Purification for sin, he has ascended into heaven. The word
Purification is not to be restrained to One Act or operation, but includes or
implies the Perpetual quality of himself or substance of his sacrifice being
by this one Act consecrated to be a perpetual Fountain of purification. As he
did not only make one propitiation for our sins; So neither did he once
actually purge us from our sins by offering up himself, but still remains
the purification of our sins: that is, he does still purify and cleanse us
from our sins, as often as we seek by Faith and true repentance to be
cleansed and purified by him.

15. So then the Blood of the Legal Sacrifice or Heyfer did consecrate the
Ashes to be as a Storehouse or treasury of legal purification, and the Ashes
thus consecrated by this sacrifice, did hallow or consecrate the Water which
was put into them to make actual purification as often as occasion required. So
did our High Priest, by the One Sacrifice of Himself, consecrate his Blood to
be an inexhaustible Fountain of purification Evangelical. And his Blood and
Body thus consecrated once for all, do consecrate or sanctify the Water of
Baptism to cleanse or wash Infants from sin Original; and such as are of years
when they are baptized from sins Actual against the moral Law of God. So does
his Blood or operative Virtue of his Everlasting sacrifice, consecrate or
qualify the Elements of Bread and Wine to purify and cleanse our souls from
such actual sins, as after Baptism we have committed. This perennal Efficacy
or Operative Virtue of Christ's Body and Blood, consecrated once for all by the
sacrifice of himself, to be a perpetual purification for such as were to be
consecrated Kings and Priests unto their God, which was thus pictured by the
former Legal or Mosaical Rites, was more expressly foretold by the Prophet
Zachary. For having in the twelfth Chap. ver. 10. Prophesied of the piercing
of the Son of Gods most precious Body by the Jews, (for which when God should
open their eyes to see the truth, they should lament and mourn) he explicates
the Use or End to which the Divine Providence had destinated this their
malicious cruelty Chap. 13. 1. In that day there shall be a Fountain opened to
the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for
uncleanness. By this offering of himself Once for all, by this opening of his
precious Side, he has consecrated all that are Sanctified, and all that are
sanctified are sanctified by it: Yet not actually sanctified or actually
consecrated by his Blood before it be sprinkled in our hearts by Faith. And to
instruct us that the Legal Water of separation or sprinkling did foreshadow the
Blood of Christ, the Apostle terms it, The blood of sprinkling. Heb. 12. 24.

CHAP. LVI.
The Efficacy of Christ's Sacrifice, and the Use of his Priesthood, Two
distinct several Things.

Wherein the Exercise of his Priesthood does consist. How it was
foreshaddowed. Ordinances effectual by virtue of Christ's Presence. Vertual
Presence is a Real presence.

1. SUch as deny the Everlasting Efficacy of Christ's Sacrifice may be presumed
likewise to deny the Use of his Everlasting Priesthood. Howbeit all such as
grant the everlasting Efficacy of his Sacrifice cannot hence be concluded to
admit the everlasting use of his Priesthood. For these be Two distinct Points
of our Belief. If Belief in Christ's death* or in the Everlasting Efficacy of
his sacrifice, were all that we are bound to believe, we were not bound to
acknowledge any other Act of his Priesthood besides the offering up of himself
in Sacrifice; But by this one Act of his Priesthood he was consecrated to be an
Everlasting Priest. And if he be an Everlasting Priest he still executes the
Office or Function of an High Priest. And it is our Duty, the Chief Point of
our Religion, to supplicate unto him as to The Only High Priest of our Souls,
that he would make us partakers of his Everlasting Sacrifice, as we say, ex
Officio, by exercising the Office or Function of an High Priest.

The Question is, Wherein the Function or exercise of his Priesthood does
consist. To this we answer, First, Negatively, That it does not consist in the
often offering up of himself by his Priests or Ministers here on Earth; For if
he were on Earth, says the Apostle, Heb. 8. 4. he should not be a Priest. This
argues, that he exercises his Priesthood in the heavenly Sanctuary, not in
Temples made with hands. So says the Apostle more expressly, Heb. 9. 24.
Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the
figures of the true, but into heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of
God for us. Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High priest
enters into the holy place every year, (...), with blood of others. For then
must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in
the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself.

The truth then is, as you have heard before, that Christ by his bloody
Sacrifice upon the Cross, was consecrated to be an Everlasting Priest. And
that this Consecration was not accomplished until his Resurrection from the
dead. For it is not conceivable that he should be an Everlasting Priest before
he became an Immortal man, and by his rising, etc, opened the Gate of
Everlasting life. After he was thus consecrated by death, and by the
resurrection from the dead, to be an Everlasting Priest after the Order of
Melchizedeck, he was not to offer any sacrifice: nor do we read that
Melchizedeck offered any. Wherein then did Melchizedecks Priesthood consist?
Only in the dignity of Authoritative blessing. See Book 9. Ch 9. and 11:
He was, (says Moses) the Priest of the most high God, and he blessed Abraham
and said, Blessed be Abraham of the most High God possessour of Heaven and
Earth. St. Cyril See the note at the end of this Chapter.
in his Parallel betwixt Christ and Melchisedech, speaks more expressly, and
reads the Text more punctually for the Opinion of Reformed Churches, than we
our selves, for the most part, do.

2. This exercise of Christ's spiritual Priesthood in the heavenly Sanctuary,
was foreshaddowed by sundry services and sacrifices of the Law, By that Solemn
Atonement which the High Priest made in the most holy place: and, as we have
often said, by the sacrifice of the Red Heifer also; Albeit that solemnity did
prefigure him likewise in the Act of his Consecration, or designation to his
heavenly Sanctuary. This Heifer was slain by another without the Camp, in
Eleazars sight, and yet Eleazar the Priest was to sprinkle the blood of this
sacrifice before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that is, with his face
toward the Sanctuary, on which unless he did constantly look, whilst he did
sprinkle the blood, the service was frustrated, as the Jews say. This testified
that the validity of this Act or the purification intended by it, was to be
expected from the Sanctuary; Christ likewise was slain by the hands of sinful
men without the City. Heb. 9. 14.
And yet though slain by them, he offered himself by the eternal Spirit. And
whether by This eternal spirit, or by his spirit (as man) or by both; certain
it is, that by the Spirit, he sprinkleth the blood of the new Covenant upon us,
and prepares a way for us to the heavenly Sanctuary. As the people under the
Law might not enter into the Congregation, nor the Priests into the Sanctuary
until they had been purifyed from their uncleanness by the water of
sprinkling: so neither could we or any of Gods people have access unto the
most holy Place or heavenly Sanctuary until the way were prepared for us, by
the blood of the Son of God, nor until we be sprinkled and purifyed with his
Blood. Having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the
blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us,
through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. And having an high Priest, over
the house of God, Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies
washed with pure water, Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. He consecrated the Way it
self, by his Bloody sacrifice upon the Cross: from the very moment in which the
Vail did rend asunder, the door was opened and the Way prepared. But we must be
qualifyed for walking in this way, and for entering into this heavenly
Sanctuary, by the present exercise of his everlasting Priesthood, which is a
Priesthood of blessing, not of sacrifice. And yet he blesses us by
communicating the virtue and efficacy of his Everlasting Sacrifice unto our
souls.

This participation, and this Blessing by it, the full expiation of our sins,
we are to expect from his heavenly Sanctuary.

3. See Book. 9. Chapt* 19.
God, says the Apostle, Hebrews 6. 17. willing more abundantly to show unto
the heirs of promise the immutabilitie of his Counsel, (...), interposed
himself by an oath (or, word by word) he mediated by an Oath. The Tenor of this
Oath, as you have heard before, was, That he would requite Abraham as we say in
kind; See Book. 8. Chapt. 30. and Book. 9. Chap. 17:
That as Abraham was then willing to offer up his Son, his only Son, Isaac in
bloody sacrifice unto him* So he would offer or give His Only Son for Abraham
and for all such as should follow his Example of Faith and obedience. It was in
the same promise (confirmed by oath) employed* That This only Son of God should
be the seed of Abraham; that in this one seed of Abraham all the nations of the
earth should be blessed. That for the derivation of this Blessing upon all the
Nations upon earth, this seed of Abraham should be made a Priest after the
order of Melchisedek. The hope in this Promise, thus confirmed by oath to
Abraham, is by the Apostle in the same 6. Chap. ver. 19. termed, an Anchor of
the soul Both sure and steadfast. But why an Anchor, sure, and steadfast?
Because it enters into that within the veil, to wit, into the Heavenly
Sanctuary, which was prefigured by the Most Holy Place within the material
Tabernacle or earthly Sanctuary, into which none might come besides the high
priest, nor he saveing once a year, and then not without Blood; For he was to
purify or sanctify it by the blood of the sacrifices which were offered
without the Camp or Congregation upon the day of the Atonement. And thus The
Son of God being crucified without the City of Jerusalem, did by his blood then
shed enter into the heavenly Sanctuary, and even purify it by his blood. Heb.
19. 23, 24. But what does our hope apprehend within the vail? The Apostle tells
us Heb. 6. 20. Even Jesus made an high priest after the order of Melchisedek;
that is, an high priest to bless us in the Name of the Most High God, to make
us blessed, even blessed as the Sons of God, or such as he himself, as man,
is, that is, Kings and Priests unto our God. That this his Priesthood is a
Priesthood of Blessing, and offers the Blessing promised unto Abraham to all
the Nations of the Earth, as well unto the Gentile as unto the Jew (though in
the first place unto the Jew) St. Peter witnesses, Acts. 3. 25, 26. Te are the
Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers,
saying unto Abraham, and in thy seed shall all the Kindreds of the Earth be
Blessed. Unto you FIRST God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless
you, in turning away every one of you from his Iniquities.

4. Yet seeing he entered not into the heavenly Sanctuary without blood, seeing
he purified Even Heaven it self by his Blood; We may not expect the Blessing
promised unto Abraham otherwise than by the Virtue of his Blood, nor may we
expect that his Blood or Virtue of it should be communicated to us, otherwise
than by the Exercise or Office of his everlasting Priesthood, unto which he was
consecrated by his blood. He now works the like Cures in our souls by the
Virtue of this Priesthood, which he wrought in men's Bodies, whilst he lived
here on earth, by the Virtue or presence of his Prophetical Function. We may
Baptize with water in his Name, and with water sanctified by his blood: yet
unless he baptize with the spirit sent from his heavenly Sanctuary, and say
unto every one whom we Baptize, as he did unto the Leper, I will, be thou
clean; our washing is but in vain, our whole Action is but a Ceremony. We his
Priests or ministers may upon Confession made unto us either in General or in
Particular, Absolve his people from their sins; for this Authority he has
given us [whose sins ye remitt they are remitted, whose sins ye retain
they are retained.] Yet unless He by his spirit, or sweet influence of Grace,
say unto the soul, whom we Absolve, as he sometimes did unto the man sick of
the Palsy, Be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee; Our Absolution is but
a Complement; although without our Absolution he do not in this sort Absolve
his people oftentimes from their sins. We may Consecrate the Elements ofBread
and Wine, and administer them so consecrated, as Undoubted Pledges of his Body
and Blood, by which the new Covenant was sealed, and the General Pardon
purchased: Yet unless he grant some actual Influence of his spirit, and suffer
such Virtue to go out from his Humane Nature now placed in his Sanctuary, as
he once did unto the woman that was cured of her Issue of blood; unless this
Virtue do as immediately reach our Souls as it did her body, we do not Really
receive his Body and Blood with the Elements of Bread and Wine. We do not so
receive them as to have our sins remitted or dissolved by them: we do not by
receiving them become of his flesh and of his Bones. We gain no degree of Real
Union with him, which is the Sole Use or fruit of his Real Presence. Christ
might be Locally Present as he was with many here on earth, and yet not Really
Present. But with whomsoever he is Vertually Present, that is, to whomsoever he
communicates the Influence of his Body and Blood by his spirit, he is Really
Present with them, though Locally Absent from them. Thus he was really present
with the woman, which was cured of her bloody issue, by touching the hemme of
his garment. But not so really present with the multitude that did throng and
press upon him, that were locally more present with him. She did not desire so
much as to touch his Body with her hand, for she said in her self, If I may
but touch the Hemme of his garmennt I shall be whole. And yet by our Saviors
interpretation, She did touch him more immediately than they which were nearer
unto him, which thrust or thronged him. And the reason why she alone did more
immediately touch him than any of the rest, was, because Virtue of healing did
go out from him to her alone. It is true then (for our Savior says it) her
Faith did make her whole, and yet she was made whole by the Virtue which went
out from him; this was the fruit or effect of her Faith, or rather the Reward
or Consequent of her Faith. In like sort, as many as are healed from their
sins, whether by the Sacrament of Baptism or the Eucharist, are healed by
Faith relatively or instrumentally. Faith is as the mouth or organ, by which we
receive the medicine: but it is the Vertual influence derived from the Body and
Blood of Christ which properly or efficiently does cure out souls and dissolve
the works of Satan in us.

This woman, as St. Matthew relates the story, had said within her self, if I
may but touch the hemme of his garment I shall be whole: She wanted either the
opportunity or boldness to touch the forepart of his garment, or to come into
his sight or presence. Yet he then knew, not only, that she had touched the
Hemme of his garment, but what she had said within herself, and out of his
knowledge of this her faith and humility, he did pronounce and make her whole.
Now it is but one and the same Act of one and the same Divine Wisdom, to know
the hearts and secret thoughts of men a far off and near at hand. And
therefore a matter as easy, for the Son of God, or for the man Christ Jesus in
whom the Godhead dwells bodily, though still remaining at the right hand of
God, to know the hearts and secret thoughts of all such as present themselves
at his Table here on earth, as well as he knew the secret thoughts of this woman
which came behind him. What need then is there of his Bodily Presence in the
Sacrament, or of any other presence than the influence or emission of virtue
from his heavenly Sanctuary unto our souls? He has left us the consecrated
Elements of bread and wine, to be unto us more than the hemme of his garment.
If we do but touch and taste them with the same faith by which this woman
touched the hemme of his garment, this our faith shall make us whole, and
stanch the running issues (and cleanse or cure the leprous sores) of our
souls, as perfectly as it did this woman's issue of blood.

But of Christ's Presence with us (Especially in the B. Sacrament of his Body
and Blood) we shall take occasion to speak somewhat more, in Handling the
Article of His Sitting at the Right Hand of God, which may perhaps give the
Reader some degree of Satisfaction, and Line out the Right Mean betwixt
Consubstantiation and Transubstantiation; or between the Romanist and the
Lutheran, at least between the Lutheran and other reformed Churches.

A Note relateing to the precedent Chapter; First Paragraph, or Number 1. Those
words, St. Cyrill in his Parallels etc.
I Conceive the Author means St. Cyrill's Comments (or Strictures) upon
Genesis: and in them This Place, or These words, [(...), --.] and in These
words his Eye was fixed upon [(...)] ex^ulit, or pro^ulit, it is not [(...),]
obtulit. That is, Melchisedek Brought out, or Carried forth, not OFFERED Bread
and Wine. Cyrill. Alex. Tom. 1. Glaphyrorum Lib: 2. Paris. Edit. 1638. Fol. 47.

To which I may add, that the same S. Cyrill in the same Book, p. 62. Says,
That Melchizedek, (...). i. e. (according to Sylburgius, Suidas, and
Hesychius.) Procuravit, Adornavit, Exportavit, Commeatum Commodavit; not
obtulit as Andr. Schotus translates it there. And again, p. 63. -- (...). i. e.
apportantem, afferentem; not offerentem as the same Schotus translates it also.
But it is the Roman Ingenie to Catch at this place. So Maldonate, to despite
Calvin, corrects the Magnifyed Vulgar Latin, altering it, to, -- et erat
Sacrificans -- but partially, for his Criticism Being given, it will amount to
no more, then, -- erat ministrans --. See this Author's 9. Book. Chap. 10.
Where he cites Philo Judaeus. Lib. 2. S. leg. Allegor. Making Melchizedeks
Bringing forth Bread and Wine not an Act of Piety and Religion, but of
Hospitality; Opposite to Ammons Churlish niggardliness, who afforded not (the
posterity of Abraham in their travel) Bread and Water.
