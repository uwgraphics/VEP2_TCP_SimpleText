TO The Reader.
Courteous Reader.
FInding by experience what good acceptance Histories of this nature have
found, that have spoke our English tongue, out of Franch, and Italian, as
Valentine and Orson, Sons of the Emperor of Greece, Primaleon of Greece, Don
Bellianis of Greece, and the Destruction of Troy, etc. Now this Treatise being
no less then of the Son of that right valiant, and victorious Emperor
Esplandron Emperor of Constantinople. And First writ in French by no mean
person, but by one that was Commissary Ordinary of the French Kings Artillery,
by name Mounsieur Des Essule, Nicholas de Hereby. And Translated into English
by one W. P. A lover of History, who willing that his Contrymen should
partake of his pains and recreation, has left it as a pattern for our English
Gentry to imitate. To put themselves forth in Acts of Chivalry, rather then
courting Ladies, and becoming Effeminate for want of manly exercises. It is
above a hundred years since this took the English dress on it; And being
almost forgotten, I have adventure once again to revive it, for the benefit of
such as delight in discourses of this nature. It being no less pleasant either
for expressions or examples, then the forementioned Histories, being refined
from its old tone of almost forgotten words. So not doubting of thy candid
acceptance of my cost in re-printing it. I take leave to subscribe my self, thy

Loving Friend. R. I.
Thou shall shortly (God willing) have the no less rare then excellent History
of Palmerin of England, and his Brother Florian Du Desert. Containing the
manner of their Births in the Forest of great Britain, and their Knightly
adventures.



THE Most Excellent History OF The Valiant and Renowned Knight DON FLORES of
GREECE, Knight of the Swans.
CHAP. I.
How the Emperor Esplandran embarking himself in great Britain to sail unto
Constantinople, departed from thence, and what happened unto him in his voyage.

THe Emperor Esplandran, having long time continued in great Britain, with his
Father King Amadis, at last determined to return into his own Country, and
being prepared in readiness to depart, took leave of his Father, and
accompanied with the Empress, King Norandel, and diverse noblemen embarking
themselves, set sail for Constantinople, but they had not past the pillars of
Hercules, entering the Mediterranean Seas, coasting along the Affrican shore,
leaving Majorque, and passing the Gulf of Cicilia, but they were by force of
weather driven from Candie, and by a contrary wind cast between Rodes and
Cipres, which wind blew so terribly, and the Sea therewith began to swell so
high, and roar with so horrible a noise, that it was heard above seven miles
within the Land, a thing not a little fearful for the time unto those that
found themselves within the danger and mercy of the same, especially the
Empress and her Ladies and Gentlewomen, as also the most hardy and assured
Knights among them, and not without cause, for during this storm, it seemed the
furious Waves mounted to the Skies, and the Clouds again flying about, made
semblance to menace the overthrow and subvertion of the earth, the Sun being so
dark, and the Sky so obscure and thick, that the least relief and comfort this
sorrowful and distressed Fleet might hope and expect, was their prompt and
speedy sepulcher within the bowels of some greedy Monster of the Sea, which in
such sort astonished the beautiful Ladies and Gentlewomen, that they seeming
(although in good health) to dye for very fear and distress. I cannot imagine
that any Villain how hard hearted and cruel soever he were, hearing their
pitiful cries and lamentations, but would have inclined himself to favor,
aid, and assist them. Presume then, in what vexation and grief the Emperor
Esplandran found himself to be, when he (being in his time a man that no man
could surpass for valiant and haughty courage) knew not by what means to help
himself, but in a manner wholly despairing of all aid and relief, oftentimes
closed his eyes that he might not see the Lightnings, Thunders, Rain, Hail,
Wind and Waves that the Tempest wrought, for no sooner fell a flash of
Lightning, but three or four horrible and fearful claps of Thunder followed, as
if the whole World should end and have consumed with fire: In that sort
floating and traversing the raging Seas, their Ships full of water, sterns,
poops, rudders, masts, sails and cables, broken, the Sea seeming an innumerable
flock of sheep feeding upon the mountains of Arcadia, whereon the Ships sailing
with such pitiful distress, scattered some backwards and some forwards, they
knew not where to find each other, neither yet could once perceive any fixed
Star whereby they might return into their course: and to their greater torment,
when night came on, the Seas, began much more to rage and swell, wherewith the
masters, Pylots, and Mariners, were so much abashed (although not unacquainted
with the same) that committing themselves to the only mercy of God, got them
under hatches, where leaning their heads on their knees, as if one had been
ready with a Sword, to give them their last and mortal stroke, attending only a
most dolorous and desperate end.

But when all hope of aid, relief, or comfort seemed wholly to be void; God of
his goodness (on whom they ceased not continually to call) heard their woeful
cries, so that about the break of day the signs of calm weather ( Castor and
Pollux) began upon the top of a cloud to appear, and by little and little the
weather clearing, the Wind ceasing, and the Waves lessening, their surety and
delivery from danger at that time seemed most certain, whereat they all were of
good courage, being nevertheless not little abashed to find themselves so
scattered from each other, and in a Sea unknown, not only out of their right
course, but also out of all company of their Ships, for that the Ship wherein
the Emperor sailed, had no other company then of one wherein King Norandel
was, which two being together about the break of day discovered two great
Foysts or Turkish Galleys, that having been tossed and tormented by the
tempest, were in no less distress then the Emperors fleet, nevertheless,
neither the one nor the other perceiving any means to avoid the fight, prepared
themselves to battle, in such sort, that having saluted each other with Canon
shot, they approached so near, that coming to the push of Pike, wildfire,
stroke of sword, and other weapons, there began between them a fight so
terrible and fierce, that diverse of them were sent into the Sea, they fighting
so valiantly together, that hardly could it be judged to whom the victory would
incline, till King Norandel found means to enter into the Ship, where with he
grappled upon the Hatches whereof he found a Turk higher and bigger then the
rest, who holding a Sword in both his hands, made such massacre and slaughter
of the Christians, that none durst once approach or show themselves before him.

But Norandal (whose heart was never daunted) quickly stayed his fury, for that
after many strokes on both sides given, the Turk having received a great wound
in his thigh, felt so grievous a pain and extreme dolor, that at last he fell
upon the hatches, which the King perceiving, lightly stepped over him, and
being about to unlace his Helmet, minding to strike off his head, the Turks
soldiers cried unto him, that for Gods sake he should spare his life, which
doing, you shall (my Lord said they) have one of the greatest Princes of the
East unto your Prisoner, which will content your self as well as any victory
ever did happen unto you heretofore, and therewith they all loosing hard
together with their Captain and chief leader, yielded themselves unto the King,
whereof he presently advertised the Emperor, who for his part had so well
exploited his affairs, that already he had entered and seized upon the ship by
him assailed.

This combat ended, and the prisoners bound and laid under hold, the General of
the Turks was disarmed, and in such sort handled, that in the end he recovered
again, who perceiving himself in the danger of his enemies, and his company
overthrowen, addressing himself unto King Norandel, spoke unto him, and said,

O my Lord! I beseech you use me like a Gentleman, for when you shall once know
what manner of man I am, it may be you will find your self more victorious
then you esteem of.

To whom the King replied, that unless he would promise him to do his will
and pleasure, as also to show him the truth of all he should demand, his life
should be in as great hazard as ever it had been. To tell you the truth, as
also to obey your command in all things whatsoever, I here do promise you of my
faith (my Lord answered the Turk) upon which assurance they came both before
the Emperor, unto whom he debated the whole order of their fight and
agreement, whereof he greatly thanked the Lord; and thereupon commanded the
Master of the ship to set sail unto the next Port or Haven approaching, where
being arrived, they abode there certain days attending the clearing of the air
and re-assembling of their scattered ships; after that, having again rigged and
furnished their ships, of all things necessary, set sail, and having a wind at
pleasure, before a month fully expired they arrived in the territories of
Thracia.

CHAP. II.
How the Emperor and his company, being arrived at Constantinople, knew who
the General of the Turks was, and what happened after that.

THe Emperor and his Fleet, having discovered the famous City of
Constantinople, his Lords and Citizens, which so long had desired his coming,
made preparation with great pomp and magnificence to receive him, the chief
whereof was Don Flores his second Son, whom he had left within the City at his
departure; at that time the young Prince was not past fourteen years of age,
and was born after Don Lusart of Greece, yet was he already, grown so tall and
comely, that he had no other desire, but only to receive the Order of
Knighthood, which in short time he well deserved, as hereafter we shall
declare.

But in the mean time, we may not forget this new return of the Emperor into
his Country: you must understand, that after the Emperor and the Empress, had
received the honor due unto them, of the Princes, Lords, Ladies, Gentlewomen
and others, and that Don Flores had showed the humble duty of a Child unto his
Parents, they altogether went unto the Palace, where among the Troop of Ladies
(the Lady Camelle) whose love has been so much recommended in the Books of
Amadis, showed signs of great joy and pleasure.

Being entered into the Court, the tables were covered, where the Emperor
holding open Court, most honorable to behold, having always by him his Son,
the Prince Don Flores, King Norandel came before him, and leading by the hands,
two young men most beautiful to behold, presented them unto him, saying, (my
Lord) behold here two young Gentlemen, who for the love and desire they have to
see, and serve you, have been content to abandon their native Countries, and
pass so many dangerous Seas as they have done; for the which you ought to love
and cherish them, and so much the rather, for that this is your near Kinsman
(named Lipsan) son unto the King of Spain, and the other the son of Don
Gulidragant, Couzin unto the Marquess of Saludar. In good faith (said he)
embracing them both, I thank them most heartily, and seeing they have done so
much for me as you say, following your advice, I will honor them as much as
possible I may, knowing very well, that the Emperors will is such I should do
so. Hereof am I very well assured, said the King, and thinking to have
proceeded in further talk, there entered into the Hall the Marquess of Saluder,
and other Gentlemen with them, which at the Emperors arrival were gone to chase
a Heart, that the night before had been shut up within the toils: but
understanding of the Emperors arrival, left off their chase, and came to show
their humble duties and reverence unto their sovereign Lord, of whom they were
very lovingly received.

In the mean time Don Flores entertained the two young Gentlemen newly given
unto him, and from that time forward began to bear perfect love and affection
unto Lipsan, which in diverse places of our History you shall well perceive.

In this sort the Court increased daily of Noble men and Gentlemen, that for
the space of eight days there was no other thing spoken, but of the great and
royal cheer that the Emperor kept, although in the mean time diverse great and
weighty matters happened, and were to be debated.

Those eight days past, King Norandel remembering his prisoner which he had
taken on the sea, and brought home sore wounded into the City of
Constantinople, lodging him in his own house, determined to go and visit him:
to whom when he came, finding him in a manner healed, and out of danger,
minded to know who he was, and what occasion moved him to sail on the seas when
he met with him, as we have already declared: to that end he spoke unto him,
saying, sir Knight, I pray you have me excused, and take it not in evil part,
if that since your arrival into this great City, I have not showed you the
courtesy and honor that appertains unto such a Knight as you are: for I swear
unto you before God, that it has not been for want of good will, but only by
reason of the Emperors affairs, and the little leisure he has had to receive
the Princes, Knights, and others that are come to visit him, whereas I have
been constrained to remain so in such sort, that forgeting my self, I did not
once remember you till this morning, that my affairs being somewhat lessened, I
called you to mind, and there with came hither, not only to visit you, but
also to amend the fault I had committed in your behalf.

And it likes your Grace, answered the Knight, I do now very well, and better
than before, perceive that it should be a thing unnatural, if the tree should
not bring forth fruit like unto the root from which it first sprang: I say this
(my good Lord) in respect of you touching mine own part, that have not deserved
the honor you did unto me, you will therein follow the bounty of that famous
King Lusart your Father, a man esteemed of throughout the whole world, not only
for his magnanimity, but also for his wisdom and courtesy, as much as any
Prince that lived before his time or since. Wherein truly you so well imitate
his steps, and that in such manner, that having vanquished me in battle, I
confess my self more vanquished then before, by reason of the great courtesy
I find in you, so that I am constrained to account this your victory of
greater honor, then if I my self had overcome ten of the best Knights in great
Britain.

Truly (said the King) this courtesy you talk of, as far as I can perceive
doubleth in your self. But let us leave this discourse, and tell me (if it
please you) in what case you find your body, and whether you find your self any
better then you did upon the seas. By how much the more (said the Knight) that
the health of my body increases and approaches, so much the more diminishes
and withdraws the joy I was accustomed to have, in place whereof I am
solicited by most grievous sadness, and not without great cause: one, by
reason that perceiving my self healed, I find my self in Prison and arrested,
whereby my heart is so grieved, that I would willingly by death be delivered
out of pain, (not as I said before) because I am so happily fallen into your
hands: but by reason I may not accomplish the voyage I have taken in hand, nor
yet satisfy and fulfill that which I have sworn and promised to do, having
already passed so many perils and misfortunes, for the attaining of my desire,
whereunto I have so long time aspired. And now because I know that my purpose
is failed, and the grief my Prince will receive, (by my fault) as also the
loss that so many great Lords shall receive by my long staying, it so much
vexes me, that in a manner I am almost out of my wits, and ready to destroy my
self.

This discourse pleased well the King, for thereby he perceived his prisoner
entering into the very matter it self, whereof he was so desirous to be
satisfied, which, the more easily to procure, he said unto him, what the cause
of your grief is I know not, but of this one thing can I well assure you, that
during your abode here you shall be well assured to receive all the honor and
good entertainment that may be de^ised among us, for such is the Emperors will
and pleasure, so courteous and merciful a Prince is he. In the mean time,
seeing we are in this discourse (I pray you sir) by the promise I look for of
you, on the faith of a Knight, ye will declare unto me that which I shall ask
you.

Therein I will do your pleasure said the Knight, for though I say it my self,
I know not any Gentleman living more desirous and careful to maintain his
credit and promise than my self, and ever will, wherein I will not yield to any
man.

Such is to be looked for, said the King, at the hands of men of your calling:
now therefore I pray you declare unto me who you are, what your name is, and
what that King and those great Lords are, which attend your return, as also the
occasion of your voyage. My Lord (said the Knight) the faith I have given you
holds me so straightly bound thereunto, as it forces me to declare that
freely unto you, which a thousand deaths together should not constrain me unto.
I am (says he) called Cosdroel of Anfamia, Son of that valiant Knight
Brontaias of Anfamia, of the Isle of Sagitaries, who was slain by the hands of
the Valiant Knight Amadis de Gaul, in the battle that King Aravigne fought
against King Lisuart your Father. (...) At the time of whose death I was so
young, that I may very well be excused of the revenge I ought to take for his
death, and since that time, likewise fortune has been so adverse and cruel
unto King Aravigne, that he attempting twice to supply my want of years and
ability, assembled two Armies, but if he sped evil in the first, he had worse
fortune in the second, for although he wan the victory, and the town of Lubame
was taken, where King Luisart and his army were overthrown, he was
nevertheless himself overthrown, and before his departure from thence remained
Prisoner by him, that before had been his Captive, which was done by the force
of King Amadis whereof I spoke before, who only has been the cause, that
neither the revenge of my Fathers death, nor yet the loss of the King of
Aravigne could for those times have any other issue then shame and dishonor.
Which I considering in my self, and being attained unto age and strength
correspondent, determined once again to try fortune, and by all means devised
still to recover the losses past, in such manner, that from the day that King
Aravigne made me Knight, with another of my Kinsmen, son of Ancidel (slain
likewise with my Father, by the hands of Don Frestan King of Sardaign) he and I
vowed and made promise unto our Gods, to revenge our losses by all the ways we
might, and although the means were taken from us to execute vengeance on our
Principal enemies, at the least we would do our endeavors, against their
Parents and Allies: wherein we had already so well proceeded in the War begun
against King Brundo, that having in a manner recovered all the lands of King
Aravigne, and dis-inherited his enemies, we thought utterly to overthrow him;
but Don Florestian succouring him with twelve of his Knights, fought against
twelve of our Knights, whereby King Aravigne remained not only vanquished, but
was slain, his people put to flight, his honor defaced, and all our Army so
feared and abashed at so many crosses and evil fortunes, that loosing both
heart and courage, we retired with shame and dishonor: determining
nevertheless once again at some better time to assemble, and again to pursue
(whatsoever befell) on so just a quarrel and revenge.

In the mean time (believe me sir) I never was at my hearts ease, nor yet
shall be, until such time I shall have revenged my kinsmans blood, shed in such
sort as I have declared unto you. And for that we are diverse of this one
opinion and intent, we therefore have made a league and promise to yield, and
all with one consent have required aid, and succor of all the Pagan Kings our
friends, who to that end have already begun to assemble men from all parts, and
that in so great number, that they being altogether and once entered into great
Britain, it shall be impossible that the King reigning therein should resist
us, neither whole Christendom, although they were altogether assembled, and
would undertake the same.

But what Kings and Lords (said Norandel) dare so much presume: seeing that
those which in times past assayed the like have sped so ill, that the greatest
part of them have left their lives remaining so well chastised for their
presumptions, that this country whereof you speak has been their Sepulcher,
and that therein as yet are living the same Knights, which in those times both
overcame and vanquished them.

Ha (answered Cosdroel) assure your self, (as I said before unto you) that
their number is now so great, and they mean to descend in so many places of the
Land, that the small number of those valiant Knights you praise so much will be
esteemed as nothing in that behalf, and which is more, we are well advertised
that within this little time, Knighthood is rusted among them, that in a manner
there is not any more talk ministered of wandering Knights; but all like carpet
Knights, (in stead of following Arms, as in times past men were accustomed to
do) study only to fit by the fire and court fair Ladies, which makes them so
much the worse esteemed of.

I pray you then show me (says the King) who are these Pagan Kings whereof so
much you vaunt. Who answered the King, first the Sultan of Liquie, the Admiral
of the great Turk, the King of Licom son of King Ataligo, the King of Libia,
the King of Persia, the King of Media, the King of the Isles of Colcos, the
Children of Arcala, most strong and valiant in arms, with all those of the Isle
of Caville, kinsmen and friends unto the Children of Dardan le Superbe, the
Giant Dramiron of Aucone, bastard Son of Bonterbo, a far better knight then
ever was his Father, and brings with him above ten thousand fighting men, the
Giant Gromolias the son of Panorente, Brucalan le Brave, Manibuenca le
Dissemblalle, the Duke of the Desert, the Signeur of the Brave Rothe, both
Giants, and the Giant Almandragro, Nicrofero, son of the Giant Bultrase, and
diverse other valiant personages. And now I came from the great Turk himself,
having been with him to desire his aid therein, who of his great liberality and
virtue has made me answer, that of his own power he will cause so many men to
enter into Britain, and France, that he himself will only overthrow them,
meaning in the mean time to send so puissant an army against the Emperor, and
thereby give him so much to do, that he shall not by any means be able to aid
or assist King Amadis, or any other his friends.

These things are not so easy (says the King) to be achieved and gone through
withal as they are begun, by reason the first point is easy, but the second
much more hard, and to prove it to be so, assure your self that in all the
countries by you named, they shall find such and so many good and valiant
Knights and Soldiers, that never in their lives (it may be) they found
themselves so hardly matched, and their proud enterprises (as I hope) shall
remain as much void and frustrate of all means as they to the contrary think it
strong, fortified, and Just.

Iuster then it is can it not be (answered Cosdroel) for that some of them come
to revenge the deaths of their Parents, and kindred, other their own injuries,
and the most part for to recover their lands and possessions lost.

Who are they (said the King?) Who, answered he, I will show you, that is,
Cosdroel of Aucone, to recover the Isle desert that was his Fathers: the
Children of Arcalaus, the Castles and places of the Isle that Dragonis holds,
Barsman the Seignior of Sansuegne, wherein at this present Don Quedragant
remains, the Kingdom of Aravigne, that King Brundo holds, which most
assuredly was the said Kings, whose son not long since, has been elected and
crowned King of Licome, and a thousand other which I could name unto you.

To which King Norandel for that time would make him no further answer, meaning
thereby not to give him any intelligence or perseverance of the desire he had
to understand further of the matter, but only demanded of him in what time he
thought they would be assembled and joined together. In good faith (answered
Cosdroel) the greater part of them are already prepared to embark themselves,
and attend only the coming of the Turks Army, that they may set sail all
together, and you for your part, sir Knight, (said the King) what shall become
of you: Are you in hope to be there in person?

Yea truly (said he) if your virtue be such, that setting apart the revenge
you might well take of so poor a Prisoner and a stranger as I am, you will
discharge him of imprisonment, and give him liberty to accomplish his message
he has promised to make unto those Lords to whom he was traveling, at such
time as you stayed him, which done, look whether it will please you, I shall
return, I promise you of my faith, so to do, without failing in any point.

Touching your liberty, can I not dispose (said the King) for that concerns
the Emperor himself: but I will declare the whole discourse unto him, and
therein will use my self so well in your behalf, that I doubt not, but
according unto his accustomed clemency, and Princely magnanimity, you shall
obtain whatsoever you request at his hands, therewith bidding him farewell, he
took his leave and departed.

CHAP. III.
How the Emperor understood of the Pagan King's enterprise, and of the Turkish
Prisoners deliverance.

KIng Norandel, thus departed from Cosdroel, went presently unto the Emperor,
whom only being accompanied with Don Flores, he said, may it please your Grace
my Lord, I have this morning been to visit our Turkish prisoner, but as far as
I can perceive and learn by him, your Grace has more cause to assemble men of
War, and prepare your Armors, then either to dance or use any other pleasure.
Why (said the Emperor) what says he?

Then King Norandel, began from point to point to declare unto him the whole
discourse which you heard before, as touching the great assembly of men made by
the Pagan Princes, not only to assail great Britain, but also the whole Land
of Christendom, and the City of Constantinople it self. And as he continued on
his discourse, not omitting any thing thereof, the Emperor both wise and well
advised in the mean time, pondered in his mind the dangers and accidents that
might happen thereby, wherewith he found himself in a great perplexity:
nevertheless, with the best and chearfullest countenance he could show, he
made King Norandel answer, saying,

Cosen, the King my Father is not a learner to prove the force of these
Pagans, neither yet am I. Diverse and sundry times have they assailed to land in
great Britain, as also in my countries, but (God be thanked) they never wan
any thing therein, but death, or their confusions, and as much shall now happen
unto them: nevertheless, we must advertise the King together with all other
Christian Princes, to the end, they may be prepared for them, especially the
Kings Agraies and Grasandor. The Kings of Scots, of Sardignia, and Sobradise,
my Uncles, as also the Prince Florizando, all which together are strong and
puissant enough to withstand and resist these brave Giants, and others their
assistants in the East Countries: and if they make way hither, believe me they
shall find (with the aid of my Son Luisart and others our friends) but a hard
morsel for them to chaw. So may it be I beseech God, (said the King) but yet
am I in great fear as touching the Country of great Britain: for (as Cosdroel
has very well noted unto me) Arms are therein of late time so much left off
and unfrequented, that at this present there is not a wandering Knight to be
found therein, as was accustomed to be, neither yet any other, doing that
whereby in times past they were so much esteemed of, more then in any country
of the World.

Truly (said Don Flores then) thereat am I much abashed, and truly I made my
account that you (my Lord) turning unto the Emperor, would have given me leave
to travel thither, there to receive the order of Knighthood, therein to prove
my force and valor, in such manner as you, Luisart my Brother, and other kings
our predecessors have done in times past: but by your sayings, I perceive I
must be forced to take another course.

The occasions of trying your manhood are sufficiently at this present offered
in our own country (said the Emperor) and here shall you find from henceforth
wherein to employ your strength, and exercise Arms being knighted, without
seeking any further, at the least if all be true that Cosdroel says.

In good faith my Lord, says the K. and so I think, he does: but in the mean
time what is your gracious pleasure, that I shall do with him: he would gladly
it might please your grace to give him liberty, that he might go and perform
his voyage, upon condition to return, and yield himself my prisoner again, as
now he is, and so has he desired me most earnestly to crave the same at your
hands: but I made him answer, that it lay not in me to do, but rested only
upon your Graces Will and Commandment, and that I would move it unto you. I am
very well content, said the Emperor, that he shall not only have liberty to do
as he requires, but also that he shall go whither it pleases him, letting him
well understand both to him and his, that we fear them but a little, and that
we care not for their enterprises.

Truly, said King Norandel, your Grace speaks like a great and courageous
Prince, and you cannot better do, for thereby, and as also by him, they may well
perceive, that you are not so easy to be feared as they think, neither yet
Christendom so lightly to be won as they account. Well then, said the Emperor,
go and carry him these news, and let him depart hence as soon as it pleases
him.

Then King Norandel went presently unto Cosdroel, and finding him up out of his
bed, began to speak unto him, saying: Sir knight, the Emperor has by me
understood all that you declared unto me this morning: and because he
esteems you for such a person as I have told him, and what you are, he gives
you not only liberty to accomplish your Embassage, but also to go whither it
pleases you, and so you may do as soon as your health will permit. It shall
then be presently answered Cosdroel: and after diverse congratulations and
thanks, with other speeches that they had together, whereupon I mean not to
stay, taking leave one of the other, they departed, Crosdroel entering into a
ship by him prepared, and Norandel returning unto the Emperors palace.

CHAP. IV.
How the Emperor Esplandran sent Sergil into great Britain, to King Amadis,
to certify unto him the news he had received, and of a strange adventure
happened unto Don Flores.

THe matter by King Norandel declared the morning before, did not cease to
trouble the Emperors mind, and more did it move him the night following, till
the next morning: so that he being up, he called his counsel together, to whom
he declared all the discourse, before rehearsed,, desiring them (as much as
such a Prince as he was, might do or require at the hands of his Lords,
Friends, Servants, and Subjects) to give him as speedy, good, and faithful
counsel as they might, the matter being of so great importance as it was. Where
many points were discoursed, some left off, and others agreed upon, in the end
they determined, that the Emperor should dispatch Sergil of an Embassage into
great Britain, to certify King Amadis, of the great preparations made against
him: unto whom instructions being given, there was a letter delivered which the
Emperor wrote unto the King his Father, wherewith the Messenger had charge to
signify to him, that all the Pagan Kings (persuaded thereunto by the Children
of Arcalaus and others which he named) prepared diverse Armies for to invade
his Land, and therefore he wished him to prepare all his Haven Towns, to
fortify his Frontiers, and to assemble from all parts his friends, allies,
vassals and subjects, because the descending of those Armies were uncertain,
and that the Emperor could never have any intelligence thereof, but only by
Cosdroel. Yet did he esteem it for most certain and true, remitting the rest
unto Sergils consideration, whom he esteemed wise enough to deliver the same,
as having heard it likewise from the mouth of King Norandel himself. He being
then dispatched away, having wind and shipping ready, embarked himself, and
being at Sea, leaving Thrace and sailed toward Italy, and from thence passing
the straights, entered into the Ocean Seas, making toward Britain: but we
will leave him on his voyage for this time, that Don Flores complain not of us
to have forgotten him.

He being pricked forward with the speeches of his Father, thought he did him
wrong to delay his taking the order of Knighthood, until the coming of the
Turks, wherewith he found himself not greatly pleased, but tossing and
revolving in his mind on the same, had no other thought but only to find the
means how, without his Fathers leave or his knowledge, he might attain unto
his purpose, but by no means could he devise the same: for first he had heard
King Norandel blame the over great sluggishnesse of the British Knights, for
being become too idle and slacker in arms, then the honor and duty of
Knighthood did require: and yet had he not any acquaintance elsewhere.
Nevertheless, his age, greatness, and force, together with his courage,
willed him to forget that effeminate and courtly life, and from thenceforth to
employ himself unto works of virtue, worthy of great dignity and praise,
wherewith his mind, being both night and day perplexed and troubled, that he
could not keep the matter so secret, but that of force he must use some speech
thereof to Lipsan of Moniaste, Son unto Brian King of Spain, whom he loved,
affected, and was private withal, more than any other that attended on his
person: so that one day among the rest, they walking together in an Arbor, and
being out of all company, he began to discourse unto him the secrets of his
heart, without omitting any point thereof, desiring his opinion therein.

Sir, answered he, my advise is, that in all things you ought to follow the
will and pleasure of the Emperor: for you must think, that whether it be in
this or any other thing that touches your honor, he is more careful for you,
than your self. You say so, said Don Flores, and yet you know well enough at
what bay he holds me, and the prolongation he uses against my desire:
wherefore I am determined, whatsoever happens thereof, to depart from hence,
whether I hope not to return again, until such time that by my valiant
enterprises in Arms, I may be esteemed worthy the lineage whereof I am
descended, for that accursed is the Son, that resembles the Father no more but
only in being his Child, and not in his virtues and good conditions.

You know my Lord, said Lipsan, that I will never disobey you, but will bear
you company, not only in this enterprise, but in all others it shall please you
to undertake, as he that most desires to do you service. Of my faith my good
friend, said Don Flores, I assure my self thereof, likewise do I love and
esteem you more, than any kinsman or friend I have: and because I perceive King
Norandel coming toward us, let us leave off our discourse for this time, and
the next day when we ride on hunting, we will conclude, whereas we may with
more privity and leisure devise thereof.

So it is best, answered Lipsan, whereupon King Norandel approached, to whom
they went, telling him that they determined the next day to hunt, so to pass
the time. Of my faith, said the King, such pleasure is fit for young Princes
and great Lords: at the least (said Lipsan) if we cannot prove our force
against wandering Knights, we will exercise the same upon all kind of Beasts
we find. Being in this discourse they entered into the Palace, where they met
Falangris, Abris de Sausirege, and other Gentlemen, unto whom the enterprise of
their hunting was made known, to the end that each of them might be ready the
next day. Next morning, the hunters went abroad very early into the Forest to
make preparation before the Princes coming thither, but scarce had they entered
therein, but that all the young Gentlemen were at their heels.

The wood was very full of Hearts, Hindes, Does, Wolves, Bears, Lions, and other
kind of Beasts, giving sufficient cause of recreation, as also a place very
fit to bring them up: for besides the largeness and thickness thereof, it was
at the end closed with the Sea, and on the sides with Rocks and Caves, where
they were not long time seeking game, but Don Flores always accompanied by
Lipsan, began to say unto him, I pray you (my good friend) let us go aside and
there make an end of our devise yesterday begun, which to do as then, was not
very difficult, for that some were busied in setting up of nets, others in
loosing of Hounds and other Dogs, after their Game, and the most part in
beating the bushes, and seeking who should first find some kind of beast or
other lying at rest, whereby these two young Princes had means to follow their
pretended deliberation, and without any thing perceived by Don Falangris, who
the Emperor had expressly sent thither to attend upon his son. They entered
into the thickness of the Wood, wherein they had not ridden long, but issuing
out of a bushy path way, entered into a pleasant meadow, in the midst whereof
sprang one of the most fairest and clearest fountains of water that could be
seen: at the brink whereof they alighted, for that already the Sun begun to be
somewhat high, and the air to be hot, and unbridling their Horses, giving them
liberty to feed, sat them down under a great Palm Tree, where Don Flores
returning unto his matter, the day before begun, let his Friend understand,
that his mind was fully resolved not to return any more unto the Court, but to
depart thence, seeking his adventures, until such time as he might obtain the
order of Knighthood: for believe me (says he) my good friend, it is small
honor for me, being the Son of such a Father as I am, and Nephew unto the
great King Amadis, to dwell so long time among Ladies, and to be their minion,
continuing an effeminate and idle life. I had rather choose not to have any
other riches in this World, then only a good Harness, a strong Spear, and a
gallant Horse to ride on, wherewith I assure my self, and my heart so gives
me, that I shall win Renown, and may attain unto that degree of honor, which
so many good knights heretofore have obtained.

Lipsan hearing him speak with so great an affection, and considering that very
hardly should he break off or dissuade him from that which he so resolutely
had concluded in his mind, answered him, saying: My Lord, I find your devise
good: but yet it seems unto me very hard for us to escape out of this
Country in such secret manner as you desire, either by Land or Sea. Did you
never hear (said Don Flores) that to the thing a man pretends, and purposely
goes about, nothing is hard or difficult. God has likewise created him above
all the beasts most singular and incomparable. Wherefore let us boldly enter
into our journey, and you shall see that aid will not be wanting, and if the
worst fall, let us enter disguised among others into the first Bark that
sets sail: yet were it better (answered Lipsan) to take the Bark wherein I
came hither, and with my men sail whither Fortune shall lead us.

It is well said (answered Don Flores) and for the rest let me alone: We will
depart by night, and I will take so much money with me, that we will have
sufficient to furnish our selves both of Horses and Armors. And being in this
discourse, they heard the bushes and hedges shake, and therewith a great noise
as it were rushing through the thickets, of some thing that seemed to make
toward them, and presently they perceived a great and fierce Lion, with most
fiery eyes issuing forth of the Wood, which being oppressed with over great
thirst, ran with open throat right forward unto the Fountan, where they as then
sat talking together. Nevertheless for all this furious encounter, neither of
them was once abashed, but Lipsan rising up, began to speak unto the Lion: by
the Gods fair beast, you are but evil taught, to come so boldly to council
before you are called, at the least if thirst constrained you thereunto, you
ought to have come in better sort, without fearing of our Horses as you have
done.

This Lion had been chased and hardly pursued by the hunters, and running that
way to refresh himself, perceiving Lipsan to resist him, in great fury and rage
made toward him, which Don Flores perceiving, not being as yet risen, started
presently up, and taking a Hunting Glave that hung by his side, steppedback,
and therewith gave the Lion such a blow on the hinder loins, that he cut off
one of his legs; and wounded the other, wherewith the Lion felt so great pain,
that with his cry all the Forest rang, and yet with that little force he had
left, he fiercely made toward Don Flores, who redoubling his blow, struck him
on the head, wherewith he cut off one of his ears: yet did not the Lion cease,
but ramping up, bit him in such manner through the Arm, that he made his teeth
meet together, and had it not been for the pangs of death, wherewith he was
oppressed, assure your self he had done him greater hurt; but therewith he fell
down dead upon the ground.

Ha (said Lipsan) to Don Flores, as far as I can perceive you are wounded, and
yet has he paid well for his boldness, I have no harm (God be thanked) said
Don Flores that is dangerous, and showing him his naked arm, they saw that it
would be easily healed. By my soul (said Lipsan) laughing, the fault was mine,
and the pain yours: but because he thought he could not obtain any great honor
against me, although I had angered him, he had rather leave me and his injury
unrevenged, to die with more honor by your hands. Then began they to behold
the force and greatness of the beast, and not without great admiration and
astonishment, for that two of the best knights in all Greece, had found
themselves sufficient work to overcome the same. And so leaving the Beast
stretched along the grass, sat them down again by the Water side, the heat of
the day more and more increasing, and hunger likewise beginning to approach,
for that they had not eaten all the day, being separated from their company, as
they were; Whereupon they determined to set forwards, seeking where they might
find redress, when as they perceived making toward them two Gentlewomen,
each of them mounted upon a fair Palfrey, richly trapped and they themselves
most bravely apparelled, but as it seemed unto them strangers. Wherefore Lipsan
said, if we were wandering knights, this fountain would not leave us without
some adventures, as far as I perceive, yet this that now offers and secondeth
is not so dangerous as the first.

Whereunto Don Flores beginning to answer, the two young Gentlewomen, came to
salute them, which in most courteous manner they did, for first lighting on
foot, and as if they had known Don Flores long time before, began to honor him
and do him great reverence. Wherefore he received them in the most courteous
manner he could, saying, Gentlewomen, if it please you to request any thing at
our hands, assure your selves it shall not be refused. God reward you (said
they both) for at such a man's hands as you are, there is no other to be looked
for, and thus much we will assure you, that if you desire to do us pleasure, we
have no less will to do you service, and for the same cause are we come out of
far Countries unto you, thereby to ease our hearts, and likewise satisfy your
desires.

In good faith Gentlewomen (said Don Flores) I thank you as much as possible I
may, and I hope one day to make this your gentle offer better known and
requited, when opportunity shall be offered, and you desirous to employ me.
But I pray you (fair Ladies) tell us if it pleases you, the occasion of your
coming hither. My Lord (said one of them) we are nourished and live with a
Lady an Aunt of ours, that wishes you great good and much honor, for the love
she bears unto King Amadis your Granfather, and to the Emperor your Father,
which Lady knowing your desire, as also your resolution, together with the
small means that rests unto you for the satisfaction of the same, has
commanded us, that with all speed we should come at this time right into this
place, where she told us we should find you, as now we do.

How is it possible (said Don Flores) that your Aunt should know that, which
very hardly I my self do know? She did truly (said she) for she told us for
certain, that we should find you by this Fountain, where you should have slain
this horrible beast, which here we see lie dead before us, and that by the same
you should be Wounded, but not much, as also that your meaning was to depart
from the Court, and secretly to withdraw your self into some other Country
(unknown) there to be made Knight, that afterward you might seek some strange
adventures. And because the Lady whereof I show you cannot forget the great
favors and courtesies by her received of your friends, she is desirous to do
you this pleasure wherewith you shall find your heart at ease, and your mind
content.

Thereat was Don Flores more astonished then before, for he never thought that
ever any other then Lipsan had had so great a part within the secrets of his
thoughts, and perceiving these two Gentlewomen to declare unto him so much
thereof, namely of that which happened unto him at the Fountain. He found
himself much troubled in his mind, in such manner that he could not refrain to
say unto them. Truly Gentlewomen, you tell me so much of that which I meant
to keep most secret, that I can very hardly be persuaded, that ever I thought
it. This is but a small matter (answered the first) in respect of that which
our Aunt can do, and that which she has heretofore made known unto King
Amadis, and to your Father, (at such time as he received the order of
Knighthood in the firm Isle) and since that time unto the Emperor your Brother.

At that instant Don Flores called to mind that he had heard speaking of
Vrganda la Descogneve, and of the marvails she had wrought; whereupon he gave
more credit unto the Damsels words then before he did, and so much, that
thereupon he said (I pray God Gentlewoman) that he will grant me time one
day to acknowledge the good will and favor your Aunt wishes unto me, for
considering, the pleasures and services she has always done unto my kindred,
it were more than reason, that so long as breath is in my body, I should love,
honor, and esteem her. Wherefore determine with your selves what course it
pleases you that I should take, and which she wills me to follow, and
assure your selves I will do it, whatsoever it be.

My good Lord (said she) my Aunt knowing all by me before declared, and your
meaning to abandon this Country, as also the great profit you shall hereafter
purchase unto all Christendom, desires you by us, that you will presently
embarke your self in the small Boat which we have left here at the shore side,
and if you have desire to be Knighted, there was never such occasion offered
unto any other then this that is now prepared for you. Thereat Don Flores
studied a little, and then answered: you being come so far as you say, it were
against reason you should lose your labors, wherefore I am determined wholly
to obey my Lady your Aunts pleasure, and accomplish all whatsoever she will
command me, and therefore let us depart when it pleases you. You do even as
you should, said the other, and well shall it happen unto you; but before our
departure we must heal you of your wound, and drawing out of her sleeve a small
Ivory box, taking him by the arm, she striped up his sleeve, and rubbing over
his Wound, she so eased him, that presently he felt no more pain, therefore
he could not refrain to say, I thank God now I feel my self whole, there is
nothing more to be done but to find our Horses and follow after you. Care you
not for them (said the Damosel) you shall get up before me, and your companion
before my Sister, till we come unto the sea shore, which is not far from hence,
where we shall find all things necessary for us. Well then said Don Flores, let
us in Gods name depart.

CHAP. V.
How Don Flores and Lipsan entered into the Bark, sailing in the Sea, until
they arrived in the Isle non Trovee, where Vrganda la Descognenda dwelt.

SO long rid the two Gentlewomen with Don Flores and Lipsan, that they came
unto the Sea shore, where finding a Ship ready they embarked themselves,
sailing with so prosperous a Wind, that scarce did Don Flores think to have
been out of the sight of the famous and great City of Constantinople, when as
already they were so far off, that they had not only passed all the Country of
Thrace, but also the sight of any Land or Country whatsoever, seeing nothing
else but only Skies, Clouds, Water, and Waves. And sailing day and night, in
the end they arrived in a certain place, where twelve Dwarfs standing in order
one by one, attending their coming, with Horses ready for them, and presently
after came thither diverse Gentlemen and others, that lead them straight unto a
banck, where going somewhat higher, they discovered a Valley most pleasantly
filled with Trees and running Fountains, the like thereof they had never seen
before, which they passed through till they came to the side of a most pleasant
Island, being there, Don Flores asked them in what place they were, and what
name so fruitful and pleasant a Country had. Sir said one of the Gentlewomen
this Isle you see before you, is called non Trovee, where Urganda la Descogneve
dwells, and where you shall be so welcome, that you will account the travel
you have taken in this long journey well employed.

Truly Gentlewoman, said he, your company has been so acceptable unto me,
that this which you name travel, is in my behalf turned unto rest, and pleasure
by reason of the great desire I have to see my Lady your Aunt. For the which
she heartily thanked him, and longer had they continued in this talk, but that
coming unto another Arm of the Sea, they stayed there because they must of
force pass the same to go unto the Palace of Vrganda. Then the Gentlewoman
that had most entertained Don Flores during his journey, said unto him; Fair
Gentleman, this place you see (as I said before) is called the Isle non Trovee,
and that by good right, for except it pleases my Lady and Aunt, although all
the Princes of the East were purposed to come unto it, yet could they never
find it, and yet I tell you more, that although it be but small both in
breadth, length, and circuit, yet I dare assure you, that in riches it is not
second unto any, neither is there the like to be found for pleasantness of
air, throughout the whole World. So I think (said Don Flores) as far as I can
perceive, of the rest I cannot judge (as knowing nothing) because that as yet I
have not seen it.

Believe me said the Gentlewoman, when you see it you will esteem the sight to
be much more then the report, and the Renown to be less then it deserves. And
saying so they landed, because they were already at the waters side, where a
great Bark stayed for them, wherein they entered and passed over, and then
mounting again on their Horses, riding so long, till at last they discovered a
far off a strong fortress, so shining, that it seemed to be made of Crystal,
for in deed it was builded all of white Marble, polished, and gilded both below
and above; whereat Don Flores took great pleasure, yet not so much as he did
approaching near unto it, and not without cause, for there was never any House
better seated, built, nor perfectly devised, then it was, specially the entry
and all the portal, being most high and stately raised, with many fair pillars,
and that which made it seem most excellent, was a story wherein was painted the
combat that Amadis de Gaul made for the delivery of Brandoze, one of Urgandas
friends, holden in prison by the Lord of the Castle de la Chausee, where one of
her Gentlewomen by deceit had shut him in, as by the same History is showed,
and that so naturally, that there wanted only life to express the same. Whereat
Don Flores and his companion Lipsan took great pleasure, because they saw King
Amadis and Galaor as they thought, even in the same age that they then were,
with the Giant which they long time beheld, and longer had done, but that one
of the Gentlewoman perceiving the gate shut, called the Porter and bade him
open it.

Then there came an old Gentlewoman which presently opened it, and receiving
Don Flores, said unto him welcome, the fairest young Gentleman now living, with
all his company, then taking him by the hand, she led him into a great Hall
within the Palace, where Urganda la Descognevee stayed for him, whom the old
woman showed unto him, saying, Gentleman, behold there my Lady that has taken
the pains to meet and receive you. Then looking before him, he perceived an
old Woman most honorably and richly apparelled, with two big, fair, and well
disposed ancient Knights (about forty years of age) going before her, and she
following, being led by two Gentlewomen her couzens, the one named Juliande,
the other Solise, for her old years did not permit her to show her self in
braver sort. Whom Don Flores most humbly saluted.

And she stretching forth her arms to receive him, said, Gentleman, you are
most heartily welcome hither, long time is it since I desired most earnestly to
see you; but my sickness and aged years have hindered me so much, that without
the same I had long time ere now visited you and done you service, as I have
heretofore continued to do to your nearest kinsmen and friends.

Madam, answered he, all those of whom you speak are so much bound and
beholding unto you, and I also, that as long as I live I will not cease to
acknowledge the same, in any thing wherein it shall please you to command me.
My good Child (said she) thereof am I well assured, and thank you therefore
most heartily. But seeing we are in question of Urganda, it shall not be
amiss to touch a word or two of that by the way. You must then understand,
that after the enchantment of Amadis and others in the universal Tower, she
returned unto her Island non Trovee, where she passed her life long time in
great pleasure and delight, as much as possible might be: living therein with
her friends, where it happened unto her (more by the permission of God, then by
reason of her age) that her sight began by little and little to diminish, so
that in the end she became stark blind, and so continued without her sight.
Wherefore she being so retired into her Isle, and there attending the hour of
death, when it should please God to call her, she kept her self a long space
in silence, without causing any report or speech to run of her, as before she
had done. True it is, that she sent two of her couzins unto Niquee, to unloose
and deliver out of captivity, those whom she had enchanted: but they could not
bring it to pass, and so her intent took no effect, till such time the gate
was opened unto them by another means, as in the Books of Amadis you may read.

Wherefore we will now return unto the matter that we left, and show you, how
that Urganda understanding by her kinswoman, the delivery of those Prisoners,
Lords, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, and perceiving by her Art the great danger
prepared against all Christendom, and their strong and hard battles that the
pagans should fight in great Britain and elsewhere, whereof Don Flores should
be the defender, and as it were the Buckler; determined with her self to send
for him, by such means as you heard before, and in the short time as then
resting, caused him to be made Knight with as much honor as he desired: which
to attain, she sent two gentlewomen, that found him in the Wood with Lipsan,
and in such manner led them away with them unto her, of whom they were well
received; in such sort, that embracing Lipsan, she said unto him, my Son, I
love and esteem you much, not only for the love of the King your Father, to
whom during my life I have wished great honor and all good; but also for the
hope I have, that like as he in his young years was a courteous, gentle,
mild, hardy, and amorous Knight, you will follow his steps, and not be less
in fame then he.

On my faith Lady (answered he) I have not for this present any greater desire
then to do you service, wherein the greatest Princes and Knights of the world,
ought most willingly to employ themselves for your sake.

Truly friend (said she) at the least your Father has showed the same in
times past, which makes me more affectioned to wish you well. In the mean time
Don Flores entertained Juliande and Solise, mothers of the Kings Talanque, and
namely, both as then remaining in the Islands of Calisorine: But Urganda called
him away, and taking him aside with Lipsan, said unto them, I pray you lead me
into the Orchard, where I will give you to understand certain things that
import you much, and will not be unprofitable unto you. Then taking her each of
them by one arm, entered into a pleasant Park, most fair, goodly beset with
trees, and replenished with ponds, rivers, fountains, and springs, that the
like was not to be found elsewhere, except it were the Palace of Apolidon in
Firm Isle, whereof you have heard in other places. Where they sitting down,
Urganda began as follows.

Gentleman, said she unto Don Flores, it is already high time for you to enter
into the way to attain that good which is prepared and predestinate unto you,
taking arms, for that since the times of Perion, Luisart, and Amadis, never any
Knight attained unto those points of honor that you shall obtain, bringing to
an end so haughty and difficult enterprises, that you will lose the desire that
pricketh you forward, in remembering the prowesses done by your famous ancesters.

There shall not want any thing in me, said Don Flores, if it pleases God, and
though it should cost me a thousand deaths, if it were possible to endure so
many. I know that (said Urganda) it may be, better then you think I do, whereof
time shall witness, which shall confirm my words, and that I have foreshewed
unto you, and to the end you stay no longer in so fair a beginning, I will take
that order whereof I will tell you; First I will provide you of the best arms
that ever (it may be) were forged, with one of the most courageous and goodly
horses whereon Knight did ever ride, the like will I give to Lipsan, and to
each of you your Esquire, with a ship, therein most secretly to convey you both
unto Rome unto the Emperor, of whom you shall receive the order of Knighthood,
so much desired by you, assuring my self he will not refuse it unto you.

At the Emperors hands (said Don Flores) I think it will not be, for that not
long since. I have heard, that not any wandering Knight, searching strange
adventures shall be allowed or accounted of by him, but as much as in him lies
he hinders them, and I fear he would constrain me thereunto. Thereof take you
no care (said Urganda) he has since that time changed his opinion, but I pray
you most earnestly, that meeting with Talanque and Manely, you will receive
them into your company, as being loved of me, which love you no less than I do
them, notwithstanding their near affinity to me.

This prayer (said he) shall be a commandment unto me, and when time serves, I
will accomplish the same, seeing it is your pleasure, or any other thing
whatsoever you shall give me in change: for it is not unknown unto you with
what desire I am yours, and that most willingly I will so remain during life.
That know I well (said Urganda) and to begin, said she, you shall remain
certain days with me, and shall be my Guests, until such time order be taken
for all things necessary for your voyage. Madam (said he) we will never
disobey whatsoever you command. And for that it was already late, and the
tables covered for supper, they altogether withdrew themselves into the Palace,
where we leave them, returning unto Don Falamgris and others that we left in
the Wood near unto Constantinople.

CHAP. VI
How Don Falamgris perceived the Prince Don Flores absence, and of the
diligence he used to find him out, and what happened unto him.

YOu have heard before in what sort Don Flores left the company of the Hunters
busy at their Game, and of the rest that the same morning were there
assembled, who having in the end taken and killed many beasts, and being
satisfied with the pleasure, together with the pain they then had endured, Don
Falamgris calling to mind the two young Princes, which more then any other were
recommended unto his charge, Don Flores and Lipsan, and seeing them not,
neither yet hearing any news of them, there was never poor Gentleman more
astonished then he, for he withdrew from all company drowned almost in tears,
and his arms cross one over the other, went all alone in each by path and
crooked way, making the greatest lamentations and sorrows in the World.

O most sorrowful and hard fortunate man (says he) what account will thou from
henceforth yield unto the Emperor of the thing he loved most dearly, and having
no sooner ended his complaints but taking his horn in his hand, he blew
therewith as loud as possible he might, in a manner as if some beast had been
taken, hoping by that long kind of blast to call and assemble those that he so
much desired to find out; but all that notwithstanding, news could he hear
none: where at he found himself more abashed then before, and not he alone but
all the rest likewise which in the same manner traversed, both Hedges and
Ditches, through thick and thin, to find that they could not see. But all in
vain, for what diligence soever they used, or what unknown or thick way soever
they took, not one of them could learn any thing, until Falamgris in a manner
more dead then living, by chance arrived at the Fountain, hard by the which the
dead Lion lay, and presently after him came thither likewise two Hunters, of
whom he asked if they had heard any news of their Lords. No (said they) but
only this, that you see before you. And lighting off their Horses, began to
behold the beast again, and seeing the blows the beast had, Ha said Falamgris,
he that gave thee thy death, was not a learner to strike, and scarce had he
ended his speech, but casting his eye aside, he perceived the bridles of two
Horses hanging on a Tree, that for fear of the Lion were fled into the bushes:
which sight so moved Falamgris, that he doubted either their Masters were dead,
or that some evil fortune had happened unto them, which made him stand still in
a manner all amazed.

When Abres de Sansuegne with a great troup of others came thither, driving
three somiers charged with Venison before them, wherewith they thought to make
Falamgris merry, but the joy they had continued but a while, when they once
knew of the loss and absence of Don Flores and Lipsan, on which their absence
they made many discourses; and diverse determinations, were pretended, yet in
the end none found better, then that Falamgris should return presently unto
Constantinople, to advertise the Emperor to the end that order might be taken
therein. That will I not do though I dye for it (answered Falamgris) but you my
Lord of Sansuegne shall go, and give him to understand, all what is happened
unto us, in the mean time I will make such search throughout the whole Forest,
that if it be possible to hear any news of them, I will know it, though it be
long first: Which Abres was content to do. Now it was about Sunsetting, and in
a manner night before any of them came into the Town where the Emperor was. Who
being advertised thereof, asked very earnestly how it happened. Don Abres
showed him from point to point, which he bare with great modesty without once
showing any countenance of grief, only in beholding the Empress in a manner
beside her self, and as it were out of the bounds and limits of reason:
nevertheless, he knew so well how to comfort her, that in the end she armed
her self with more patience then before.

The Emperor setting before her eyes his fortunes past, as also the beginning
and continuance of the mavelous adventures wherein he found himself at his
first entrance into Arms, together with so many other good reasons and
persuasions, that in the end both he and she resolved with themselves to remi^
the matter unto the will of God, ordaining nevertheless that the next day King
Norandel and all the Knights of his Court should go and search throughout the
Forest, fearing least some Lion, or other beast had made a prey of Don Flores
and Lipsan, whereunto they all obeyed, and with them rode the Emperor himself,
accompanied with the Marqu^sse Saluder, the Duke Gastilles, Abres de Sansuegne,
and others, with traversing here and there through the Woods, at the last they
met with Falamgris, in a manner more dead then living, so much had he traveled
and searched all night long without any comfort in the World, as he declared
unto the Emperor, who seeing the pains he had taken, and the grief he endured
comforted him, and as though he had not greatly weighed the matter, asked him
if he had heard no news of them as yet. No my Lord, answered he, but only by
the dead Lion, and the bridles, of two Horses. True it is, that since that, I
found Lipsans Horse half devoured by beasts, but of the other, I can hear no
tidings at all, and at the uttering of those words, he shed forth abundance of
tears, that he seemed as a man in a manner desperate, and out of his wits,
whereat the Emperor commanded him to cease weeping, for (says he) such
behavior rather becomes a child, but bring me where the beast lies, and
where that is you have else found.

Then Falamgris spurred right unto the Fountain, where hard by there hung upon
a tree the bits and bridles of the Horses, and in a manner under them lay the
Lion dead. Marry (said the Emperor then) behold (I pray you) what a furious
beast was here: and presently thereupon perceived a path, which he commanded a
Page to follow, until he found the end: but not long after he returned again,
bringing news, that not any other then beasts had passed that way, and that the
same path went just upon the sea shore, but said he (my Lord) I have found a
trace which gives a light that the Horses of Don Flores and Lipsan fled that
way, and as he stepped forward to lead the Emperor on the way, King Norandel
came unto him, who being weary, had in a manner put his Horse out of breath, in
running after the Horse of Don Flores that he had taken again, having of all
the rest of his Harness, but only the Saddle left, wherewith he presented
himself before the Emperor, saying: My Lord, if we had as well found the Master
as his Horse, we had done sufficient for this days Work: but I think him not
to be within this VVood: for there is not one bush that I have not sought, but
I believe rather that he has embarked himself in some vessel, passing along
this shore, for I have found the traces of men's feet toward the Sea shore. I
kon him thanks (answered the Emperor) in long time shall he not so well try
his fortune, as his Grandfather King Amadis, or my self have done, I hope God
will defend and keep him from evil, being he is as he is, and from that day
forward began to show more cheerful countenance then before, making known his
high and courageous stomach, then when most it seemed oppressed with grief and
adversity.

My Lord (said King Norandel) he has lost himself peradventure, and it may be
you shall see him again as good a Knight, as you would wish him to be. There is
enough done (said the Emperor) let us return again into the Town, where they
were no sooner entered but it was night: but when the Empress understood the
little profit they had gotten by their travel, and that assuredly her Son was
lost. God knows how and in what manner she showed her self a Woman (I would
say a fool) but that such a word is unseemly for a Lady of so high a calling,
if men would not excuse, her in respect of the nature of her sex. Nevertheless
the time, and the comfort the Emperor gave her, caused her in the end somewhat
to moderate her grief.

CHAP. VII.
How news was brought unto the Court by a Knight of Vrgandaes of the safety and
welfare of Don Flores.

THe court being in this uprore (as I showed you before) the Emperor neither
yet the Empress thinking in long time to hear any news of their Son, the eight
day following there entered into the Court an Ancient Knight, who being
accompanied with four Esquires, richly apparelled, meeting with the Duke
Castilles, asked of him, if by any means he might speak with the Emperor
himself, for (said he) I bring him news wherewith he will be much pleased and
content. In the name of God (said the Duke) I will bring you into his presence,
for never was there Prince had more need thereof, and taking him by the hand,
lead him into the Empresses Chamber, where the Emperor sat devising among the
Ladies, to whom the Duke said: My Lord, this Knight asked for your Grace, and
brings you (as he tells me) very good news, wherewith the Old Knight
stepped forwards, and kneeling on his knees, (kissing a Letter that he held in
his hand) delivered the same unto him, saying, My Lord, Vrganda la Descognovee,
my Mistress recommendeth her most humbly unto your Grace. But when the Emperor
understood the name of the Gentlewoman, his heart leaped, and breaking the
seal, he began to read it, whereof the tenor was as follows.

Most high and puissant Emperor of Constantinople, Vrganda la Descognovee of
long time not unknown unto you, wishes your Graces prosperity, with all
increase of joy and felicity. May it please your Majesty to understand, that
knowing of the great grief and wonderful sadness, which you have newly taken:
and being desirous to remedy the same by the contrary means, I give you to
understand that the Prince Don Flores your Son is living and in good health,
yet do not the Destinies permit you to see him in long time, but he must first
pass many dangers, and perilous adventures before his return unto you: of one
thing can I well assure you, that in the mean time the great and marvailous
acts reported unto you of him, shall not make you so much to muse, as give you
cause to rejoice. For such shall be his valor and prowess in Arms, that not
any living creature shall ever be able to attain unto the like, and such shall
be his reputation, that until the time of the good King Arthur which shall
reign in great Britain, not any one shall be comparable unto him, for he shall
recover the Countries lost, and shall revenge the cruel murders committed in
his time, and because all this shall happen and come to pass, and that before
long time be past, I beseech your Grace when they are fulfilled to have in
remembrance that which by this Letter is now fore-shewed unto you.

At such time as the Falcon and black Kites of the Isles beyond the seas, shall
make war against the fair birds and their young ones, the white and subtle
Eagle shall come forth to defend them, aided by the obscure Eaglets and other
birds that shall follow her, to assure her of her abode, one of her young ones
being with her: by which means shall happen so brave and cruel a battle against
the Falcon and black Kites, that diverse of them shall remain dead, taken, and
spoiled in the place, and many of them also spotted with their own blood: at
the same time likewise another Falcon that shall be present, shall take
courage, and with his sharp tallons being favored of the white Eagle and her
obscure Eaglets, shall do so much for the sweet birds, that he shall help to
destroy the Falcons and black Kites, whereof shall be such slaughter made,
that killing some, and slaying others, few or none of them shall have means to
return unto their nests, for the which deed the said black Eagles, Aiders and
Assisters of the white Eagle, being desirous to recompense the glorious falcon,
shall make him Lord and Governor of their young ones, lodging him in the
highest and best place of their nests. Whereof I pray your Grace to think upon,
for all this without doubt will come to pass.

Then said the Emperor (having read the Letter over twice or thrice) I believe
that Vrganda says the truth, and that this Prophecy shall come to pass, but
for my part I cannot understand or comprehend the same. God grant all may fall
out for the best, that whatsoever she foretells me of my Son, may come to
such an end, as both she and I desire: of this one thing am I very glad, that
he lives, and that so good and wise a Lady has care over him. Then turning
himself unto the Messenger, he asked him if his Mistress were in good health.

And it please your Grace (answered the Knight) she is very weak and feeble of
body, but most ready and disposed in mind to do you service; for although her
years and great weakness have taken from her the use and exercise of her eyes,
yet have they not taken from her the desire she has of executing that which
may pleasure you. In good truth (said the Emperor) that have I always expected
in so good and virtuous a Lady as she is, unto whom I am more beholding, then
to any other of her profession living: by reason of the pleasures, benefits,
and agreeable services, I have received at her hands.

If my Lady (answered the old Knight) travelleth, taking pains to please you,
she cannot do it for a greater Prince, nor one that more deserves it, and so
has she given me in charge to show you, which having done I am presently to
return back again unto her. Wherefore my Lord, having fulfilled her
commandment, it may please you to give me leave. I am well content said the
Emperor. My friend said the Empress, you shall commend me heartily unto her,
and shall give her certain small presents which I will send her, and to her two
kinswomen. Then she commanded a little coffer of Cedar to be brought full of
exquisite things, which the old Knight having received, and his leave taken
both of the Emperor and all the rest, he returned the same way he came, leaving
the Court very joyful and contented with the good news he had delivered them,
keeping on his way as best pleased him.

And now let us see in the mean time what Sergil being embarked for England on
message to King Amadis does, to whom Wind and Fortune was so prosperous, that
having sailed the Italian Seas, and Ports of Spain, passed the straights,
entering into the Ocean Seas, sailed so well that within two days after he
departed, he arrived at Winsore, where he met with Angerote de Stravanx, whom
he knew very well, of whom he asked where King Amadis lay, for that seeing the
town so bare of Gentlemen and Knights, he thought that the King had not as then
been lodged there, Angerot bade him welcome, and therewith lead him unto the
Court to the Kings presence: of whom being welcomed he said: In Gods name
Sergil what is the cause you do return so soon again from Constantinople: How
does my Son.

My Lord (said Sergil) and it like your Grace, your Son is well and in good
health, commending him unto you, and therewith kissing the Letter, he presented
it unto him. Which the King having read, said: It certifieth us of some news at
hand. Such news and it like your Grace (answered Sergil) were good to be
certified unto all your council. Then the King commanded to send for King Arban
of North- Wales, Listoran de la tour Blanch, Grindolan Brother unto Angerote,
Saquilles his Nephew, Lazadin Lescrimeur, the Earl Durdalin, and diverse other,
before the which assembly, Sergil turning himself toward the King, began to
recite what had happened unto them after his departure from Britain, what a
great tempest he was in, in what danger they were, the battle between the
Sarazens Ships and theirs, the imprisonment of Cosdroel, and lastly, the
determination and pretense of the Pagan Kings, moved thereunto by the Children
of Arcalaus, and others as mischievous as they, whereof the Emperor my Master
has thought good to advertise your Grace, to the end you may provide for them,
that you be not taken upon the sudden. And to the same end prays you to send
for all your Captains and Soldiers, Friends and Allies, together with the
Emperor of Rome, all which being assembled, and your Ports well furnished in
Warlike manner, he hops this great and huge Army of Enemies can nothing at
all hurt you, but that all will turn unto their own confusion and overthrow.

And for his part assure your self (my Lord) he sleeps not, but determines,
if they enterprise against him, so to receive and entertain them, that he
hops to give them cause never to be so bold again, as to visit him in such
sort.

Truly (said the King) these hell hounds have still a quarrel against me, yet
have they at other times sufficiently found and assayed what I can do. But if
God will they shall feel once again this voyage what slaughter I can make of
them, for if they once set foot on land, be it in great Britain, or in any
other place where I command, whatsoever falls out, I will give them battle.

My Lord (said King Arban) things done deliberately, and by counsel, have
commonly good success. If they come to visit you (as they brag they will) time
and season will give you means to resist them then, as you shall find
convenient. In the mean time, according to the Emperor your Sons counsel, you
shall, if it please you make the matter known unto the Emperor of Rome, and the
rest of your friends, by whom you may be aided: giving order likewise that your
Ports be well furnished, and all your ships rigged and prepared to set sail
when it pleases you.

So will I do answered the King, and therefore (good cousin) I pray you let me
have your counsel therein. Seeing it is your will (my Lord, said Arban) that I
do it, I will take what pains I can therein. But who will you send in Embassage
unto Rome: Marry you (my Lord Lazadin, said the king taking him by the Arm)
shall take that charge upon you. You have heard what Sergil has declared unto
us from my Son, the same shall you declare unto the Emperor, and that I
desire him to have his men in a readiness, promising him that if the cloud
falls in Italy, presently to aid him there and that whenever it falls
here about, that he will aid me in like case, as I doubt not but he will.

My Lord (said Lazadin) your pleasure shall be fulfilled. And I pray God give
me grace there and in other places to do you any service I may. Prepare your
self then (said the King) and take what company you think good with you. That
done, the Counsel brake up, every one repairing to his lodging. The King and
Arban together devising what order were best to be taken for the Country. In
the mean time Lazadin having Vessels and men prepared, with a prosperous Wind
set sail unto Ostie, where being arrived, he Landed, and from thence took his
journey unto Rome, being there, he presented himself before the Emperor, of
whom he was first most courteously entertained, and then demanded the cause of
his repair thither.

And if it please your Grace answered Lazadin, King Amadis my Master
recommendeth himself most affectionately unto you, and has written you a
Letter, wherewith he presented the same unto the Emperor, wherein was nothing
specified but only a credit for the Messenger, and that he could at large
dilate the matter unto him. Wherewith the Emperor prayed Lazadin to delare the
same, which he did from point to point, as ye heard before, desiring him at the
end, in his Masters behalf, to prepare a puissant Army, ready to resist the
Pagans power wheresoever they should Land, were it in Italy or great Britain,
assuring your Grace (said he to the Emperor) and so has the King my Master
given me in charge to declare unto you, that if the cloud fall in your
country, he will aid you with so great a force, that you shall know what
desire he has to do you pleasure, and if it falls in his Countries, that it
will please you to succor him in like manner, for that he says your two
forces being united together with your Friends and Allies, all the Princes of
the East cannot in any sort hurt or indamage you.

Truly my friend answered the Emperor, the King my brother has reason to
esteem of me as he does, therefore to be brief, according to your message,
let him be assured that I will not fail, to prepare for their coming, and hold
my men in a readiness, as intelligence shall be given us of our enemies
arrival. In the mean time you shall rest you here with me, and then return
again unto him with this answer, and a Letter withal from me, which I shall
give you: but Sir, I pray you go and visit the Empress and the Ladies.

My Lord (said he) that shall I willingly do, for so am I commanded by the
Queen. I pray you do so (said the Emperor) then leading him unto the
Gentlewomens chambers, among the which were the Infants Elisene, and the
Princess Floriana, Daughter unto Angerote de Stravanx, whom Lazadin saluted
immediately after his humble duty done unto the Empress.

They, as most courteous Ladies began to devise with him, and amongst other
talk ministered. asked him if King Amadis were in as good health as they
desired he should be: I assure you (said he) I left both the King and the
Queen in very good health, and so they willed me to show you, and therewithal
do recommend themselves unto you, but especially to you Madam: unto whom if it
shall please you to write some of your news, they shall think it a great
pleasure at your hands, which I beseech you do, and I will deliver it as one
that desires to do you a greater service, if at any time it shall please you
to command the same at my hands.

Truly my Lord Lazadin answered the Princess Elisene, I have heard so much of
you, as touching your courteous and gentle entertainment of Gentlewomen and
Ladies, that I now perceive you cannot forget your old behavior and bringing
up, for my part I heartily thank you for the great courtesy you offer me, and
after I understood your arrival here, fearing that the Kings affairs would
constrain you to depart from hence without taking your leave of the Ladies, I
have already written a Letter, which I thought to deliver you my self, or to
have sent it, by one of the Empress her Gentlewomen, but seeing you have done
us so much pleasure as to visit us in our lodgings, I pray you take it and
deliver it your self unto the King my Father, with his Daughters most humble
commendations. Madam answered he, that will I do without doubt.

This done, Lazadin stayed till evening very late among them, courting the
Empress and the other Ladies, as time and opportunity served, and in the end
took his leave, and having received such commendations and charges, as those
which might command him had delivered, as also what other matters they had to
say, as well touching King Amadis, as also Queen Oriane, and others, bidding
them farewell, he went again unto the Emperor, of whom having received a Letter,
as he had promised him, to carry unto great Britain, and his leave taken as
well of him as of the Princes Arquisil, and Florisanda, he withdrew himself
unto his lodging, until morning that he got on Horseback, and in great have
traveled unto Ostie, where taking shipping in the Bark that there stayed for
him, with a prosperous Wind sailed so far, that passing the Miditerranean Seas,
he fell upon the British Coast.

But because Don Flores and Lipsan are offended to lie so long in oblivion, let
it suffice you to know that Lazadin arrived at Winsore, where the King stayed
his return, who having well understood the message by him, brought from the
Emperor of Rome, presently dispatched Sergil for Constantinople, and others,
that for the like affairs he sent abroad into diverse places of the land. Let
us then leave them on their voyage, and return we unto our two young
Gentlemen, which in the mean time were governed by old Urganda in the Isle non
Trovee.

CHAP. VIII.
How Don Flores and Lipsan departed from Urganda la De scognevee, that
according unto her advise, they might go to Rome, there to receive the order of
Knighthood, at the Emperors hand.

IF all ways were straight, and that we needed not often times either to
pass over mountains, or compass about rivers, marshes, and ditches, to arrive
where we desire to be, we should rest us sometimes, and the pains we took
would be less tedious, and not seem so long, as oftentimes it is found to be.
This I say, to the end that before we enter into the very depth of our History,
and the true discourse of this Book, we have been forced to choose out crooked
ways and follow obscure paths, thereby drawing somewhat out of the way to make
the matter more easy and intelligible: but seeing we are re-entred into the
high way, believe me the rest of the way you have to walk, is much more easy
and pleasant than that which already we have traveled: which to prove true,
let us now return unto our matter.

Don Flores and Lipsan, which in the mean time stayed with Urganda, hoping from
day to day, according to her promise, to be conducted to Rome, there to be
Knighted: one day among the rest at Evening time, as then not expected of them,
she called them unto her, taking them aside, said, Now my Children, I have
caused you to be fetched hither into this Island, to the end you might obtain
the thing you most desired, that is, to receive the order of Knighthood,
therein to imitate your Fathers and Friends, so much esteemed and feared
throughout the whole world. And to the end you shall know how you are to behave
your selves therein, I will give you presently for your Esquires, two of my
Nephews, whom I pray you to love, and use them in your service, as those whom I
love with all my heart.

Then she called them unto her, naming the first Urgandin, and the second
Filidonio, this says she to Don Flores, speaking of Vrgandin, shall be yours,
and the other Lipsans. They are both Gentlemen born, and of a good house: I
pray God they may do you such service, as I hope and desire they should do.
Then she commanded the two Gentlewomen that brought them, to fetch her thither
two trusses she had ready prepared, which they did, and unbinding them, took
out of the first an Armor and Furniture appointed for Don Flores: the most
fair, strongest, and best tempered, that (it may be) ever came out of good
workmans hands, as well could he prove that bare them afterward on his back,
wherewith he remained conqueror in many great perils, and valiant enterprises
by means of the same: but if the Plate were good and excellent, the Helmet,
being as red as blood, was not far behind, much less the Shield, bearing
gules, two Swans argent, whereby Don Flores was afterward throughout diverse
Countries, named the Knight of the Swans.

You see, said Vrganda, this is a present I give unto you, and a Horse shall
you have correspondent to serve your turn in all places where you travel: then
unbinding the other, she took out another Armor, all white as snow, with a
Shield Or, streamed with flames of fire, gules. And these, said she to Lipsan,
shall be yours: for like as in this Shield are painted flames burning, so shall
your heart flame in the love of Ladies. Which indeed happened afterward: for he
bare such and so extreme an affection unto the fair Clistibalda, Daughter of
King Norandel, that he was ready to dye for her sake, and for the love of her
he accomplished, and brought to an end, many fair and strange adventures, as it
shall be recited in the discourse of our History, wherein he shall be called
by his Esquire, the Knight of the burning flames.

Then giving order for his Horse, and other necessaries convenient and fit for
his and Don Flores departure, she said: I pray God, my Children, that all may
fall out to his glory and service, and that to your honors you may receive the
order of Knighthood, to bear Arms during your lives, as your ancesters have
done before you, whereunto that you may attain, in the morning betimes you
shall enter into a Ship, ready rigged and prepared for you in the Haven, and
shall sail right unto Rome, where these my Gentlewomen shall accompany you, for
they shall serve you and do you much pleasure in diverse places, assuring you
that in all my life I never knew any man nor woman except Mrs. Elizabeth, more
expert in surgery than they are.

Therewith the two young Gentlemen gave her most hearty thanks: and for that
time took their leave, the next morning minding to imbark themselves, which
they did, as soon as day appeared with so good a wind and prosperous journey,
that they arrived safely at Rome, where the two Gentlewomen not ignorant what
they had to do, apparelled themselves most richly, then commanding two white
Geldings to be sadled, got upon them, desiring the two young Gentlemen to stay
for them till they came again: for said they, it is requisite that we go before
and speak with the Emperor, which done, we will return and certify you what
answer he makes: God be your speed, answered Don Flores and Lipsan.

Then they rid in haste unto the City, where they arrived at such time as the
Emperor with the Ladies were set at meat, they entered into the great Hall,
where they found them almost ready for their fruit, and with most reverent
countenance presented themselves before him. And as being well brought up, made
unto him three low courtesies. Gentlewomen said the Emperor, have you any cause
to use my help, or any others that are of my Court.

And it likes your Grace said they, unto your self only are we adressed: you
then have found me, said the Emperor, ready to make you acquainted with the
good desire I have to show unto all Ladies and Gentlewomen, any service I can.

We hope no less of the virtue and magnanimity that is in your Grace, answered
they, although we never deserved the same at your hands. Well then said the
Emperor, in what thing will you now employ me? for if it be possible, assure
your selves, I will accomplish the same.

My Lord said they, we are come out of a far and strange Country, to bear
company unto two Gentlemen of most high and noble Parentage, one whereof has
great desire to be made Knight. And because there is not any part of the world
wherein Knighthood flourishes more, than in this your Court, he has resolved
and determined with himself not to receive the same, unless it be at your
hands my Lord, if it please your Grace to invest him therewith: and for that he
knows that such favors are commonly granted by Princes and great Lords, such
as you are, sooner to Gentlewomen, than to others whatsoever they are* he
therefore has desired us to take the pains, although to us but a pleasure, to
come unto your Majesty, to present this his humble request, which and it
pleases your Grace, under your correction, you shall grant him: assuring you,
that both the one and the other for whom we entreat, are of blood Royal, and of
so noble houses, that it shall redound unto your Graces honor and glory.

Truly Gentlewomen, said the Emperor, you shall not be denied at my hands, a
thing so reasonable and virtuous: but I pray you most instantly (at the least,
if you may do it without offense) to show us more at large what manner of men
they are. My Lord, answered they, your Majesty shall pardon us, that can we not
do, for it is expreslie forbidden us, we will presently go fetch them, and
sure we are, you will be greatly pleased with the sight: Which said, taking
their leave, they returned the same way they came, leaving the Emperor much
musing at the adventure, saying to his Lords, that certainly such young
strangers suits, desiring Knighthood out of so far Countries, as the
Gentlewomen had reported, must needs be of more account, then commonly other
Knights are.

Mean time the two Messengers were again returned unto Don Flores and Lipsan,
that stayed for them, unto whom they declared what they had done, as you have
heard before: wherefore said they, you must both mount on Horseback Armed, in
the same Arms my Lady our Aunt gave you, and we will guide you to Rome, even
unto the Emperors Presence, which they presently did. They were both most fair,
and of most excellent form of body, especially Don Flores, whose form and
shape was so perfect, that for greatness and strength correspondent he seemed
some young Giant: and in truth during his time, he never found any that ever
prevailed against him.

Then setting foot on Land, and mounting on their Horses Armed as they were,
they traveled toward Rome, and being come thither, rid straight unto the
Court, entering into the great Hall, where the Ladies were devising together, by
whom they were most courteously welcomed, especially of the Emperor, who with
great honor received them, and after a pleasant countenance and courteous
entertainment given them, turning unto the two strange Gentlewomen, he asked of
them if these two young Gentlemen were the same they had showed him off.

Yea and it likes your Grace said they. And I am ready said the Emperor then,
to fulfill on them the promise I made unto you, and to give them the order of
Knighthood when it shall please them to receive it.

It shall then be to morrow said Don Flores, if so it pleases your Grace, this
night, according to the custom we will watch, and in the morning your Majesty
shall accomplish on us what shall seem good unto you. The Emperor had not in
long time before been requested to do any such thing, nor that turned him unto
greater honor, wherefore he determined to keep a feast, and to show his great
magnificence, for the love of the two young Gentlemen strangers, whom he
should make Knights.

In the mean time the two Esquires brought from the ship both their Armors,
wherewith when the night came, they armed themselves, and entering into the
Chapel, made their Vigil, according as the custom in such Ceremonies
required: being always on their knees, beseeching God to give them as good an
end in that their enterprise, as they esteemed the beginning honorable and
worthy of praise. In that manner remained they until morning that the Emperor
entered into the Chapel, accompanied of the Empress, the Prince Arquisil, the
Princess Elisene, the Prince of Cantarie, Florisando King of Sardaigne, his
Father, leading by the hand the Infant Theodore, and other Princes and Ladies,
all they finding the two young Gentlemen on their knees, the Emperor therewith
speaking unto Don Flores said.

Gentleman, the Mass being Celebrated you and your company shall have that you
desire. Therewith the Bishop of Ostie being ready, he blessed (according to
the custom) their Swords, Shields, and Helmets, presented unto him: which
done, the Emperor rising, asked of Don Flores, if he would be made Knight, I
(and it please your Grace said he) for it is my only meaning and desire.

Swear then said the Emperor. That you shall well and truly observe the order of
Knighthood, never doing injury to any Lady or Gentlewoman, but shall maintain
their right against all such as shall force or do them wrong, and shall not
though you dye for it, commit any thing unconvenient, or dishonorable act,
unto so holy and honorable an order, as this you are minded to receive.

That do I promise and swear unto you, said Don Flores.

And upon this your Faith and promise said the Emperor, giving him the Sword on
his neck, I make you knight in the name of God, Creator of all things, whom I
beseech most humbly to arm you with as much force and virtue, as there is in
you of beauty and good grace.

Then taking him by the right hand, and lifting him up, said: you may now
receive your Sword of whom soever you shall think best. Then Don Flores casting
his eyes upon Florizando, said: if it please your Grace, I would receive it at
the hands of Florizando, and my Helmet of Arquisil, which was presently done.
Florestan King of Sardaigne, hanging his Shield about his neck.

Scarce had they finished, but Lipsan stepping forward, and kneeling down,
desired most earnestly of the Emperor, that with his favor it would please him
to grant that his companion might make him Knight: that am I well content
withal, said he: and so I desire him to do it for your sake.

Wherewith the Knight of the Swans, for so shall Don Flores be called in diverse
places of our History, gave the like Oath to Lipsan, as had been ministered unto
himself by the Emperor, and desired the Ladies they would vouchsafe to give him
the rest of his Arms. Which they accomplished most willingly: for the Empress
girded his Sword about him, the Princess Elisene set on his Helmet, and the
Princess Theodore gave him his Shield.

Truly said the Emperor I cannot remember that in all my life I did ever see
two Knights armed together which liked me better. And as for you Knight of the
Flames (turning to Lipsan, to whom the same name is often given in this
History) he said, you are more beholding unto the Ladies, then any other that
I know: having received such honor and service at their hands.

My Lord, said he, this favor indeed did I desire of them, to the end that
during my life I may remain their servant, for I assure you, that from
henceforth it shall please me better to employ my force at the request of the
least and simplest Woman in the World, then at the desire of the best and most
virtuous Gentleman living.

In good truth, then said the Emperor, they ought all by good right to love and
esteem of you. And so it came to pass: for never was there Knight that ever
did more for Ladies then he did after that.

Now my Lord (said Don Flores) if it pleases your Grace, you shall give us
leave to depart, that we may begin to show our forces, and follow the feats of
Knighthood. So am I well content to do answered the Emperor, this day being
past, wherein I mean to make you my Guests, being minded to make you the best
entertainment I can, and so the Ladies would likewise.

Both to you and them said Don Flores, are we most humble servitors, and will
not in any point break your commandment, if it pleases God. Which done, they
were conducted unto the Palace, there being lead into a Chamber prepared for
them, where putting off their Arms, and apparelling themselves in other suits
fit for the time, they went unto the Ladies, with whom they bare company both
at dinner, supper, and dancing, until time came that they must of force go take
their rest.

CHAP. IX.
How the day following, as the two new Knights took their leave of the Emperor
to travel abroad, there entered into the Court a Gentlewoman clothed in black,
desiring succor of the Prince Florizando.

THe next day the two new Knights desirous to pursue their adventures, attended
the rising of the Emperor, but issuing out of their Chamber, they found him
already walking in the great Hall: and as they were about to take their leave,
minding to give him thanks for the great and honorable entertainment they had
received at his hands, there entered into the Hall a Gentlewoman apparelled in
black, with a countenance so sorrowful, that thereby it might easily be judged
her heart was oppressed with great grief: being entered, she spoke unto the
Gentlemen present, of whom she demanded if Florizando were not there among
them: but he (of whom by fortune she asked the question) answered, I am he,
Gentlewoman, and ready to comfort you, if it lies in my power: for that the
apparel and countenance you bear do very well Witness, that you are neither of
the best contented, nor of the merriest in the World.

Ha (said she) the tears standing in her eyes, running down her face, gentle
Knight I cry you mercy: you shall understand, that I am of the Country of
Denmark, where from my youth upwards I began to serve the Princess Sabine,
Daughter unto King Garinter and was captive with my Mistress at such time as
King Malobato came and conquered his country, and so held her Prisoner for the
love of his Son named Rouland: but by the strength and valiant prowess which
is in you, she was afterward delivered, and you overcame that Rowland with whom
you fought: yet having overcome him, he obtained so much of you by request,
that you consented, he should have her for his Wife, upon charge he should
become a Christian, and should yield unto the King Garinter her Father, all
such Lands as he detained and occupied of his by force of Arms.

Whereupon the marriage was solemnized (which if it pleased God I would it had
not been so:) for that since, the wicked Wretch had my Lady in his power, and
lead her with him into Iconia, whither I bare her company, hoping of good
entertainment, and some reward for my service, he began to do her all the
mischiefs he could devise, and such, that where I made account to live in joy
and pleasure, you see me now apparelled in this sort, and bearing a
countenance that witnesses my sorrow and grief. But let me show you the
cause: so it was, that scarce had King Rowland entered into his Country, but
that he found diverse of his men revolted, saying that it appertained not to
Christian Kings to Reign over a Pagan Country. Which known by a great number
that followed him in the conquest of Denmark, they showed openly that which
until then they had kept secret and unknown, and renouncing the faith and
baptism they had received with their Master, forsook him to turn against him
with his enemies.

His Enemies I say, for so he called them, yea he himself no better, seeing he
had agreed with you, to forsake his own Laws, not for any good he hoped for by
ours, but only to enjoy the Lady, for whom his heart burned so much in Love,
which being cooled, and his desire satisfied, has again received his Pagan
Laws, and seeks by all means to force the Lady Sabine, unto the same, which
she would never consent unto, although he has tormented her, and yet to this
present day holds her in a strong and cruel prison, threatening her, that
presently upon her deliverance of the child wherewith she goes, to make her
dye and evil death, which I poor soul considering, went unto her Father, to
carry him those pitiful news, and found him in his country, whither not long
before he was returned, coming from the succor of the Isle Montgaza, and from
great Britain, namely, from King Amadis, and his great friend the Emperor of
Constantinople, being newly dis-enchanted, assuring you, that such his absence
made King Rowland enterprise all the mischief unto you rehearsed, and worse
than these, for he is entered into the Country of Denmark, and with a great
Army destroys, pilleth, and puts to fire and sword all he finds before
him, thereby utterly to overthrow and impoverish his Father in law, who being
weaker of men then he, and older in years then willingly he would, has
commanded me to seek you out, and in his behalf to desire you, that seeing
that once you have re-established the Realm and Country of Denmark into his
hands, yiedling the same peaceable unto him, it would please you once again to
aid him against that cruel King, so wickedly falsifying his faith and promise
which to you he had made then, when in your presence, and by your persuasion,
he gave him his Daughter in marriage.

If this will not move you unto pity, and that for your ease, or other causes
to your self known, you will not undertake this voyage, for the delivery of
this sorrowful afflicted King. I beseech you for the honor of God and
Knighthood (said she) weeping most bitterly, do it for the love of my poor
Mistress left by me in great extremity, which you ought not to suffer, being
born (as you are) unto virtue, and to maintain the honor of Ladies, that in
adversity have recourse unto you for aid, succor and relief. Florisando having
known King Rowland more amorous of Sabine then ever he had seen any (as he
thought) traveled by love, with compassion moved at her tale, answered unto
the Gentlewoman.

And believe me Gentlewoman, it grieveth me much to think upon the pains and
travel you have taken, as also of the grief you now sustain, but much more for
the troubles of your Mistress, to whom (after you shall have somewhat
refreshed your self here in the Court) you shall return, assuring King Garinter
that I will follow presently after you, to aid him as he has desired me. O my
Lord! said the Gentle woman, God forbid that I should take rest either of body
or in mind, so long as I know her that has nourished and brought me up, to be
in sorrow and pain, and that Traitor King Rowland living and persisting in his
wickedness, without receiving due reward for his desert.

Then the two new Knights stepped forward, promising Florisando to conduct her
into Denmark, where (said they) we will aid the King, staying till you come,
for the which he heartily thanked them, and presently taking their leaves of
the Emperor and the Empress, and the Damosel, likewise of Florisando, they
departed from Rome, entering into the ship that Vrganda had given them,
wherewith they sailed so far, that for the space of five days they were
without the sight of any land, until the sixth day that they entered into a
straight, where certainly they were in great danger to be lost: yet by the
grace of God, their vessel took land in a place better then they thought it had
been, wherefore the Knight of the Swans, commanded the Mariners to cast Anchor
and go a shore, whereunto they obeyed, so that the two Knights with the
Damsels and their Horses being landed, they willed the Pilot and them of the
Ship, to depart from thence unto the Island non Trovee, and being there
arrived, willed them to thank Urganda in their behalf, for the great courtesies,
favors, and pleasures she had showed unto them: which done, they departed the
same way they came, and on the other side, Don Flores, Lipsan, and their
company mounting on their Horses, traveled along by the shore side, till such
time they came unto the head of a causey, where the Esquire Urgandin said, I
know not in what Country we are, but sure if we follow on this way, it will
lead us unto some Village, where we shall know what we desire.

And going forward they traveled so far, that at length they perceived the
glistring of a Castle, which in their sights seemed of white Marble, it shined
so bright, the situation being on the top of a Hill, under the which ran a
great and deep River, over the same having a great Bridge of stone, built with
arches very fair, at the end thereof stood a Tower with a watch therein, that
none might pass the same, without knowing who he were.

Nevertheless, neither the Knight of the Swans, nor the Knight of the Burning
Flames did once stay, until such time as a villain came unto them, who at the
entering of the bridge, holding a staff in his hands, said with a churlish
voice: What now you strangers? think you to have the passage so easy at your
commandments, and that without giving us your names: no, no, look first what
these letters contain (then he showed them a Jasper stone) which he bade them
read at their pleasures, which having well understood, said he, do as you think
good. At these words the two Knights approached near the Bridge, where the
Knight of the Swans perceived a great Ivory Horn fairly guilt, hanging at a
great chain likewise guilt, with a writing, which contained as follows.

Let all Knights understand, that not one whatsoever he be that shall blow this
Horn, but he shall be sure of a Combat, wherein if he be vanquished, he must
leave both Arms, Horse, and Gentlewomen, if any he have with him, but if he be
of the Country of great Britain, or any of King Amadis friends, he shall be
worse used, for either shall he be cast in prison, or gain a dolorous and
horrible death.

I know not said Don Flores, who this brave and glorious Knight is, nor for
what cause he bears so great hatred unto the best King now living in the
world, but were he a Devil inchained, or loofe, I will prove what he can do.
Then setting the Horn unto his mouth, blew it so loud, that all the place
sounded therewith. It is needless, said the villain that had stayed them, for
the Lord of the Castle will not come forth before to morrow in the morning,
neither to fight, nor yet to parley in any sort. Wherefore go forward on your
way if you think good, or else stay my Lords leisure without any more blowing
of the Horn.

That will I not do answered the Knight of the Swans, for rather will I stay
here a whole Week together, then I will depart without battle: you heap the
like evil fortune upon your self (said the villain) that diverse others have
done, that in like sort found themselves discontented herewith, wherefore I
counsel you to pass on your way, and that quietly, without so much chafing and
vexing of your self.

When I ask counsel of thee (said the Knight) give it me if thou can, in the
mean time get thee gone and take thy rest, for as for me I mean not, whatsoever
may befall to depart hence, until such time I have seen and spoken with thy
glorious Master, therewith going to the Gentlewomen that stayed for him, they
all together alighted off their Horses, in a fair Meddow full of trees, casting
a great shadow, where they lodged and refreshed themselves: for as then the Sun
was very high, and the days were long, and exceeding hot.

CHAP. X.
How the Knight of the Swans fought with the Lord of the Castle, and overcame
him.

IN such sort the Knights and Gentlewomen passed away the night until the next
morning, that the Knight of the Swans awaked, about break of the day, when he
called Urgandin his Esquire to bring his Armor and saddle his Horse. In the
mean time Lipsan and the rest of the company awaked, to whom he said, that time
drew on to prove their new adventure. When you will answered Lipsan: his
Esquire Filedrino having already brought him his Horse: wherefore Arming
himself in all haste, they took their way toward the Castle, leaving the
Gentlewomen attending the event of their fortunes.

The Knight of the Swans was no sooner come unto the stone, but (as he did the
day before) he set the Horn to his mouth, and blew so loud, that well it might
be heard two miles about, insomuch that the Lord of the Castle and the Watch
start up at the sound thereof, as it were in a maze, and he that had the entry
of the Bridge especially in charge, looking out at a Window, spoke as
follows. Trust me Gentleman you are over hasty to seek your own misfortunes,
whereof peradventure you may repent at leisure.

Thou say well, answered the Knight of the Swans, but think thou we have
nothing else to do? tell thy Master (honest fellovv) that he is to blame to
play so much the Coward within his Castle, let him come forth into the fields
where we have stayed for him: are you at that point (said the other) you think
then you have to do with some foolish Coward: but truly I hope to see you both
before noon, brought into such perplexity, that I think you will be better
contented with a little rest, than desirous to travel any further on
adventures, and that you may prove it to be true, blow the Horn the second
time, that your evil fortune and mischief may fall upon you all at once.

Then the Knight of the Swans blew the Horn again louder than before, in such
sort, that presently after he perceived the Gates of the Fortress opened, and
a great Knight issuing forth, mounted upon a Horse so high, that he seemed a
Tower shaken with the Wind, the Knight armed in all points, bore a Shield half
parted Or, and as he approached near unto the Knight of the Swans, he said.
Perdy Sir Knight, you have been overbold with my Horn: for the which you shall
speed never the better, seeing without cause or reason you have waked me out
of the sound sleep I was in.

I know not (answered the Knight of the Swans) to whom the evil fortune shall
happen, but this know, peradventure you had been better in your Bed than here
fighting with us, keeping and defending the passage (without cause) against all
men, and as I have heard, by one of your men, as also perceived by the stone,
threatening wrongly and without cause, the Knights of great Britain.

What (said the other) are you then of King Amadis house? I would willingly be
one of his house (said the Knight of the Swans) being well assured that none
but honest men and of honorable houses, are received there, yea, and the best
Knights in the Land, so wise a Prince is he. Of his virtues said the other, I
never heard in all my life, but sufficiently of his folly, and more then
needs both for him and his, and so much that I have fully determined if any
of them fall into my hands, to prove if I can heal the light head of their
King, by the sorrow I will cause them to endure.

That is not so (said the Knight of the Swans) for I believe that if any of
them that you threaten passed this way, he would heal you of the pride and
rashness that makes your head so out of temper, and to make you know that I
speak not without reason, I will first begin, and therefore beware of me, for
I assure you without doubt, I am both his kinsman, friend, and servant to the
death, and you are but a fool so to esteem of your self.

Ah (said the other) never in all my life was I better pleased, then now to
have found so good opportunity, to revenge upon thee and thy companion the
death of my good Father long, since dead, a man of himself more worthy
estimation then thy kinsman Amadis, and all the rest of his lineage together,
and to the end thou may try my force, come thou and thy companion together
against me alone, and when I have vanquished you both, yet shall I in a manner
be nothing moved therewith.

The Knights of King Amadis's Court (answered the Knight of the Swans) are not
accustomed to fight against others with advantage. And seeing thou have had
this conference with me alone, with me only thou must (will thou or not)
have now to do: my companion being such and so valiant a man, that be it
against thee or any other, as great a Lubber as thou art, he needs not any
help. Make thee ready then said the Knight of the Swans, therewith giving back
about a carrier length upon the bridge, being large and plain, vailing both
their vizards, they ran so right one against the other, that the great Knight
struck the Knight of the Swans right upon his Shield, wherewith his Spear brake
all in pieces, not doing him any hurt: but his enemy moved at the injurious
words uttered by him against King Amadis, could single him out better, and with
such force, that striking him out of his Saddle with the blow put his right
shoulder out of joint, so great was his fall: Nevertheless, he stayed not on
ground, but rising up lightly, least if he defended not himself better on foot,
then he had done on Horseback, he should fare but ill, and taking in his hand
a Falchon he bore by his side, said unto the Knight of the Swans, Knight, the
hazard and hard fortune is fallen upon me, on Horseback, but we shall see how
it will fall out on foot, wherefore light off your Horse or I will kill him.

O said the Knight of the Swans laughing, even now you would have had to do
with two at once, how comes it to pass you can behave your self no better
against one: Well then in Gods name, let the rest of our Combat be on foot:
therewith he descended, and delivered his Horse unto Vrgandin, and covering
himself with his Shield, set upon the glorious Knight, whom he within short
time handled in such manner, that with one blowcleaving his Shield in two
parts, he put him in fear of his life, yet did he strike such a blow on the
Knight of the Swans Helmet, that he failed not much to strike him down, his
eyes and ears therewith starting and tingling, which he bore not long without
revenge, for he seeing him without a Shield, stepped forward, and with all his
force stroke him right upon the place where before he himself had been
stricken, and passing through the Helmet and coif of steel, Wounded him so deep
in the head, that losing his senses, he fell flat down on his face upon the
bridge, and as he thought to stride over him and strike off his head, he heard
a great noise out of the Castle, which was of two Knights, that perceiving the
Weakness of their Lord, came forth all Armed for to succor him, which Lipsan
perceiving, stepped forward to receive them: in the mean time the Knight of the
Swans leaped lightly on his Horse that Vrgandin held, ready for him.

Then it was who could do best, for the two Knights newly issued forth, sought
if it were possible to revenge his cause whom they esteemed dead, and the two
strangers to use them worse if it were possible, and in such sort striking and
Combating together, both on the right hand and on the left, the Knight of the
Flames with a cross blow stroke the one, (with whom he fought) so fiercely on
the vizard, that with the blow he clove his Iaws, and therewith cut off a piece
of his neck, wherewith he was so feared, that turning his back he began to run
in all haste to the Castle, crying with a loud voice: Come forth men, come
forth, and be revenged on these Traitors, and presently thereupon fell down dead
in the place, by reason of the blood that ran into his throat and choked him.

In the mean time the Knight of the Swans that dealt with the other, brought
him into such extremity, that being not able long to endure against him, he
was forced to suffer as much as his companion had done, which caused them of
the Castle to stay their course, being already coming to set upon the two
strange Knights: but upon the sudden stayed themselves, looking what would
become of their man that lay still upon the Bridge. Unto whom the Knight of the
Swans returned, and lighting on foot, went and unlaced his Helmet, thinking to
strike off his head, but he feeling the air, began to breathe, and opening his
eyes, perceived his enemy lifting up his Sword to strike off his head,
therefore with a loud voice he said, I pray you sir Knight, for Gods cause do
me not that injury, but rather spare my life, upon condition that you shall
pass the bridge at your own pleasure.

O Traitor (said he) the Bridge will I pass, and thou shall lose thy head, to
assure them that hereafter shall chance to follow me this Way.

My Lord (said the other) if I have done evil I will make amends for it at your
pleasure, which I promise you to do upon my honor and credit. Give me your
Faith (said the knight of the Swans) that neither by you nor any of yours, we
shall receive any hurt or damage, then shall you see what I will do.

That do I swear and promise unto you (said he) then the Knight of the Swans
took him up, but when he saw the one Knight. dead, and that the other likewise
could not get unto the gate, never was there man more grieved at the heart:
Nevertheless, he made signs to his men that they should lay their Weapons
down, and let fall the Drawbridge out of hand, but they could not as then hear
what he said: therefore there issue forth more then thirty men Armed with
brigandines and halberts, for to assail the two Knights, which their Lord
perceiving, stepped before them, commanding them to honor him by whom he had
been overcome: whereunto they obeyed, then Don Flores, Lipsan, the Gentlewomen
and their Esquires, entered into the Castle, where they were well lodged, and
the Wounded Knight laid in his bed, where oftentimes the Knight of the Swans
went to visit him, who the next day minding to depart, said unto him. Sir
Knight, you must discharge your promise made to me, for now I must be gone,
having other enterprises to accomplish.

My Lord (said he) rather will I dye a thousand deaths then once fail therein.
Begin then (said the Knight of the Swans) to declare the cause wherefore you so
much hate King Amadis, and who has moved you to maintain the evil custom of
this Castle, then you shall know what rests for you to accomplish.

Sir said he, King Amadis being a Knight. adventurous, slew my Father named Ardan,
a Knight most redoubted in the court of King Luisart, at which time I was but
one year of age, but since that time, growing unto man's estate, and continuing
with my Mother, one of the richest Ladies in this Country, sister to Dardan le
Superbe, slain likewise at Winsore by the said Amadis, I was by her in such
manner persuaded to bear a mortal hatred against him and his Lineage, that
having attained that ripeness of years capable to receive the order of
Knighthood, and being a knight, yea, and one of the best in these countries, I
determined with my self, that so long as life and limb lasted, to assail by all
means to hurt and endamage our common Enemy, doing so much, that both he and
his, might feel some part of the evil Will I bear unto them: and the better to
effect my desire, I remembered my self, that the Court of King Amadis being
greatly frequented by Knights seeking strange Adventures, it should hardly fall
out, but that some of them would pass by this Way: for which cause I took upon
me to keep and defend the bridge, hoping that if any of them might fall into
my hands, to make them (in despite of him) dye an evil death, or else give
them a life worse then death it self.

Truly, said the Knight of the Swans, I would willingly know what punishment
those of his house or his lineage, have deserved for a thing wherein they never
once offended, it had been much more seemly for you to have challenged your
Enemy to the Combat, and assayed to revenge your self on him alone, or have
gone into great Britain to find him there, without watching the Passage in
such manner after those which not so much as once doubt of you and whereof it
may be there will not one pass this way in ten years space.

The going into great Britain (said the other) is not much from the purpose,
and peradventure it will be done sooner then you think, for that already the
Children of Arcalaus, are assembling men out of all parts, to assay by force of
Arms, if they can recover the places and Fortresses stolen from them by King
Amadis, and with them are diverse great Lords united, as well of these countries
as others, whereby there will begin the cruellest Wars that ever was heard of,
for it shall not be ended, until both he and his lineage Friends and Country,
be utterly ruinated and destroyed.

You promise much unto your selves said the knight of the Swans, those for whom
you would purchase this revenge are dead in that Country (for they were not
worth a straw) and you shall dye likewise in the same Country as they have
done, being much worse: But I advise you better and more for your profit, that
is, so soon as you are able to travail, leaving this enterprise of the Wars of
great Britain, you shall go unto Rome, where from me you shall present your
self unto the Emperor and the Prince Florisando, telling them that the new
knight bearing for his Devise the Swans in his shield, and that took his leave
of them to follow the Gentlewoman apparelled in black, saluteth them both, then
you shall recite unto them, what has passed here without this Castle between
us, and from thence you shall go into great Britain to King Amadis, and there
you shall yield your self prisoner unto him, and shall pardon him the death of
your Father and kinsman, and shall likewise present unto him from me the Horn
and the Chain that hangs there without, and that ^ you will do all this I
have showed you, you shall swear unto me to accomplish the same, not failing
in any point, and that from henceforth you shall no more maintain the custom
of this Castle, or any other like it.

Whereunto he obeyed, in such manner, that being healed of his VVounds, he
traveled into Italy, and spoke with the Emperor and Florisando according to
his charge given, and from thence came to great Britain, where he presented
the Horn and the Chain, which K. Amadis commanded to be hung under an Arch at
the entry of his Palace, and so did he accomplish all that he had to do: but
this wicked Mandancedon afterward forgetting himself, brake his faith, for the
which he had his just reward, as hereafter you shall hear. In the mean time,
the renown of the Knight of the Swans spread in all places without being known
by any other name.

CHAP. XI.
How the Knight of the Swans, fought in the Forest with Orlistes, and overcame
him.

THe promise by oath received of the knight of the Castle, by the Knight of the
Swans, and having therein recreated himself with all his company for the space
of two or three days, at the last departed from the said Castle called la
Brave Roche, traveling so long, that the next day about twelve of the clock,
they encred into a goodly Forest, the Sun being at the highest, shining very
hot, and passing through the same, came to the entry of a long Causey, where
they perceived coming toward them a Knight all armed, riding upon a brown bay
Horse, bearing a Shield of Sable, charged with a Lion Rampant, Or, Armed
langling Argent, and a chief gules, which sufficiently showed him to be of the
Lineage of Arcalaus, for they all do bear the like Arms. And as they approached
nearer together, they saluted each other in most courteous manner: but
presently the Knight of the causey perceiving the two young Knights riding with
their Helmets off, because of the extreme heat, began to behold them, thinking
by reason of their young years, and great beauty, that their strength could not
be much, whereby looking upon the sorrowful countenance of the Gentlewoman
apparelled in black, he could not refrain, but said to her.

Truly Gentlewoman, you are (as far as I see) worse accompanied then your case
seems to require, which makes me think, your grief proceeds thereby.

Truly Gentleman said she, the company that guides me are such, that if it
were other, my grief should be much more, yet can you not so much dissemble
said the Knight, that I should not perceive you are far meaner guarded then you
deserve. In so much, that if by arms your joy may be recovered, you are now but
hardly sped, having no other with you then Armed gentlewomen, and if they be
men, then have they each man his, so shall you be mine, whom I will so well
entertain, that if your grief be to be ended and assuaged by Arms, believe me,
I am an expert master in that art.

Knight, Knight, said the Knight of the Swans, it were better for you to bragg
less of your own prowess, and with more courtesy, then you do, let the
Gentlewoman (good sir) travel on her way, and follow you your own, (if you
think good.) If I thought not to stain mine honor (said the Knight of the
Causey) in fighting with such Boys as you are, I would make you dearly buy the
folly you use, yet it is reason I should excuse you, seeing that youth by
reason of their young years, and want of discretion, do oftentimes thrust
themselves into such matters: and turning to his Esquires, said, Sirs, take
this Gentlewomans horse by the bridle, and make her ride on before whether she
will or not.

Yea truly said the Knight of the Swans, if we would suffer her to do it, but
before you bring that to pass, it will be needful for you to speak in other
sort: on, on, said the other to his Esquires, take her and make her turn by
force, at which words the Knight of the Swans overcome with choler, although
by reason of the extreme heat, he had his head unarmed, could not refrain, but
approached the other, and with the back of his hand stroke him such a blow on
the face, that he brake two of his teeth.

Ha Rascol (said he, striking) does it become such roysters as thou art to use
violence against Gentlewomen: the blow he gave him was such, that his nose ran
down with blood, being therewith so astonished, that if he had not clasped his
arms about his horse neck, he had fallen to the ground, yet taking courage, he
laid his hand on his Weapon to revenge himself, and with such dexterity, that
the Knight of the Swans had not the leisure to take his helmet, yet did he not
refuse the fight, but being covered with his shield, set upon the other, the
Knight of the Causey crying unto him:

Beware of me young man, attend the reward of thy great folly, yet he passed
forward without once touching him, which the other did not, but took him such a
blow on the shoulder, that his vambrase and arms failing, with great pain of
the blow he fell to the ground, and that so heavily, being a fat, great, and
heavy man, that his fall might have been heard a long Bow shoot thence, which
the Knight of the Swans perceiving, called Urgandin, and willed him to light on
foot, to know if he were dead, and as he had disarmed him perceiving him not
to stir, and finding the truncheon of the Spear sticking in his shoulder, said,
This is no deadly blow: Alas my Lord! said the Esquires of the hurt Knight, for
Gods cause blame not us if our Master has spoken foolishly, we beseech you
most humbly do us no harm therefore, and what is he, said the Knight of the
Swans? sir Knight (said one of them) his name is Orlistes, couzin germane to
the Children of Arcalaus the enchanter, at whose request he traveled to
Mandancedon Lord of the Castle le brave Roche, to assemble men from all parts,
to War against King Amadis, and as he ended those words Orlistes came unto
himself, thinking to rise again, but the Knight of the Swans stepped lightly
over him, and threatening to stay him, said, as far as I see, you are not like
to lead away our Gentlewoman, although in truth she had no will to follow you,
the reason is, because you being so unable to conquer her, it may well be
thought, that worse could you defend her or your own head, which shall remain
here for an assurance of the injury and dishonor you would do unto her, that
deserves (and all other Gentlewomen likewise) to be defended and saved, at
those words the Knight was so stricken with fear, that trembling he assaied by
entreaty to obtain that which by force he could not get, speaking unto the
Knight of the Swans in this sort.

Gentle Knight, I cry you mercy, let your courtesy at this time overcome my
rudeness, as your strength has been sufficient to abate my pride, whereof I
am so grieveously punished and corrected, that during my life, I cannot choose
but remember the same, these are but words (said the Knight of the Swans) your
life is but short, if you swear not to accomplish my (...)meant, that do I
swear, and promise you of my (...) (said he) then said the Knight of the Swans,
you shall never seek to do any force or villainy against Lady or Gentlewoman,
neither yet consent or suffer it to be done by any others: further I command
you by the same faith you have given me, that being healed of your wound, you
take your way to Rome, where you shall find the Prince Florisando, to whom you
shall present your self from the Knight of the Swans, but lately departed from
the Emperors Court, and tell him that I begin to do as he required at my
hands, that is, to defend the Gentlewoman given me in charge, and having showed
what befell you, you may depart to what place it pleases you, but if you will
be ruled by me, I will advise you as little as you may, to follovv the Sons of
Arcalaus, for as I hear they are not much better then their Father, otherwise
assure your self you cannot continue long, but one or other will chasten you
and learn you to be Wise, with that he bade his Esquires help him on his
Horse, which they did, taking their way to the Castle le brave Roche, and
from thence his health permitting, he accomplished the promise he made.
Wherefore for this time we will leave to speak of him, and end this our first
part of the History of the Knight of the Swans.
