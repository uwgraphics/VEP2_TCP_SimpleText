THE QVAKERS SHAKEN: OR, A Firebrand snatched out of the Fire. BEING A brief
Relation of GODS wonderful Mercy extended to JOHN GILPIN of KENDALE in
WESTMORELAND. Who (as will appear by the sequel) was not only deluded by the
QVAKERS, but also possessed by the DEVIL.

If any question the Truth of this Story, the Relator himself is ready to
avouch it, and much more.

Mat. 24.4.5. Take heed that no man deceive you, for many shall come in my
Name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.

2 Cor. 11.14. And no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an Angel
light.

THE QVAKERS SHAKEN.
THe mind of man, destitute of Gods Grace, does (like untilled ground)
luxuruate into wickedness and vanity, being very prone to close with the
suggestions of the grand adversary of his soul; yea, though he has had some
taste of the things that are excellent; yet such is his courtesy. that he will
be seeking after Novelties. Old truths (like the Manna to the Israelites, after
a constant and continued falling of it) become pauseous: the truth hereof has
been found in all ages, by lamentable experience; but especially in these our
days, which have been as fruitful of new Opinions in matters of Religion, as
Africa it self of Monsters.

Some (though few in comparison) God is pleased to recall, who have gone astray
in this kind, and to bring them to a clear sight of their folly, of which
number, I (by Gods Grace toward me) am one; I desire to acknowledge him in it,
and to give him the praise of it, and think my self bound in conscience, as a
testimony of my thankfulness to God for my deliverance, to declare it to the
world, that so others may hear, and fear, and take warning by my example.
They who have been lately in the Northern parts of England, cannot be ignorant
how prevalent the imposture of Quaking has been for these nine or ten Months
last past, in which snare I my self (among many poor deluded souls) was
taken in May last 1653. though by Gods goodness toward me, the snare is
broaken, and I am escaped; a true account whereof, take as follows.

I being desirous to associate my self with this Faction at their Meeting, and
to hear some of them speak (to use their own expression) acquainted one of
their own with it, viz. George Bayley of Kendale, who gave me great
encouragement herein from his own experience of much advantage received by him
in that way: Whereupon I went soon after to their Meeting at Richard Newby's
house, where I stayed about two hours ( viz. from eight, till ten at night)
where Christopher Atkinson was Speaker, whose drift was, to deny all
Ministerial Teaching, and Ordinances, together with all notionall knowledge
formerly gained by use of such means, to become as though we had never learned
any thing thereby savingly, and to lay a new groundworke, viz. to be taught of
God within our selves, by waiting upon an inward light, which (as they assert)
lies low hidden under the earth. viz. the old man which is of the Earth,
Earthy. Hereupon I resolved to close with them; after which time I was afraid
to read any good Books, or hear any Preaching Minister, or call to
remembrance any thing which I had formerly learned out of Gods Word, concerning
God or Christ, or mine own estate, or any other subject contained in
Scripture; for I was persuaded by their teaching, that whatsoever I had learned
out of Gods Word by Hearing, Reading, Catechizing, etc. was but notionall,
carnal, and hanging upon the Tree of Knowledge; in which condition whilst I
abode, they affirmed me to be under the Curse, applying this expression, though
very impertinently, Cursed is every one that hangs on the Tree.

After this, going a second time to one of their Meetings at Edmond Newby's, I
had some conference by the way with some of themselves which went with me;
amongst other Blasphemies, one Robert Collison affirmed, That Christ was as
man, had his faylings, for he distrusted God (quoth he) upon the Cross, when
he cried out, My God, my God, why have thou sorsaken me? To whom I answered,
that then he suffered as an evil doer, and so could not purchase Redemption
for us. After this, coming home, he who then was Speaker, urged us to take up
the Cross daily, and to abide under it; saying, Carry the Cross all day, and
it will keep thee at night; that this would keep us low and humble, and kill
and make alive; further, he endeavored to persuade his Auditors, to hearken to
a voice within them; teaching, that Gods Voice was a still Voice; after which I
resolved in my thoughts to wait for the manifestation of these things within
my self.

After a while, going a third time to their Meeting, as I went, I was somewhat
troubled in my thoughts at the remembrance of that hideous Blasphemy, uttered
by the party before named; whereupon I spoke publicly to them at their
Meeting concerning it, telling them, That I would not any further join with
them, if they were all of that mind; to which some of them (after much
whispering) answered negatively, wishing me not to let it trouble me; for he
which spoke so to me, was not rightly called: with which answer, I was at
present satisfied, and did adhere to my former resolution. Not long after I
went to another Meeting upon a Lords day at Robert Collisons house in Kendale,
where the aforesaid Atkinson was Speaker, who beginning about nine a clock in
the forenoone, continued till three in the afternoon, in which time he spoke
much (according to his usual manner) of the great experience which he had of
God from the light within him; which light I not finding to be in my self, was
very much troubled, apprehending my condition to be very bad, finding nothing
but blindness and hardness; yet I still expected the appearance of that light
within me, and earnestly desired that I might fall into quaking and trembling
apprehending that I should thereby attain to the immediate discoveries of God
unto me. Upon my departure from thence, I perused a Pamphlet set forth by some
of the same Faction being in York-Castle, the maine scope of it was against the
Ministry; immediately after, walking in my Bed Chamber, I began (as I have
formerly desired) to tremble and quake so extremely, that I could not stand
upon my feet, but was constrained to fall down upon my Bed, where I howled and
cried (as it is usual with them) in a terrible and hideous manner, to the
great astonishment of my Family; Nevertheless I my self was not at all
affected with fear, because it was a satisfaction to my former desires, and I
looked upon it as the beginning of the pangs of the new Birth, and expected
that the issue of it would be good; when I had continued about half an hour
in that condition, I ceased from howling and crying gradually; after which, I
arose up again beginning to rejoice, thinking with my self, that now I could
bear witness against the Ministers of England, as false Prophets and Priests
of Baal, because I never found such effects and operations upon me by so long
continuance under their Ministry; After this, going to Bed, I was much
troubled all that night following in my sleep, with dreams, concerning my
condition, and had a discovery of my sins in particular, especially of
Covetuousnesse, the Devil working strongly upon my imagination; I apprehended
that all sin was about to be hewed down, and rooted up in me and (to my
apprehension) the sin of Covetuousnesse had great long roots, which did
visibly appear to me when it was rooted up: Afterward lying awake, and
thinking upon the dreams and visions I had formerly been troubled with, I
sensibly perceived something (as I imagined) lighting upon my neck, giving me a
great stroke, which caused much pain to me; and after that another, which was
less then the first, and so a third and fourth, each stroke being less then
the former, and each stroke descending lower down, till it came to the middle
of my back, and then I thought something entered into my body, which I
persuaded my self (from Satan's instigation) to be the Spirit of God descending
upon me like a Dove, and entering into me; whereupon I heard (in my conceit) a
voice within me saying. It is day; whereupon looking up, and perceiving it to
be light, I answered, Yes; the Voice teplyed twice over to me, and said, As
certain as it is light, so certainly shall Christ give thee light.

After this I continued two or three days waiting for further discoveries of
light within me, being rapt up into an ecstasy of excessive joy, and sometimes
again exceedingly dejected with fears and doubts of my condition, whether it
were really good, or I were under Satan's delusions; yet still I waited for
further manifestations; and walking into the Garden, lying down upon the
ground with my Face toward the Earth, my right hand began extremely to shake,
so as I could not hold it still, the meaning whereof, whilst I was wondering
what it should be, and apprehending my self as being shaken by the hand, I was
brought into another rapture of great joy, imagining it to be a figure of my
spiritual Marriage and Union with Christ. Then presently I was by the power
within me raised, and set upon my Feet, and by the same power turned and laid
upon my back, with my Face toward the Sky; at which time, all my sins
particularly were again brought into my memory, and at the remembrance of
every sin, my hand wa carried round about, with giving a little pat upon the
ground, and then I imagined I heard a Voice saying, Now such a sin is
mortified; after which, I being persuaded by it, that all my sins were
mortified by it one by one; the power that I was then acted by, permitted me to
arise up again of my self, saying unto me, Ask whatsoever thou will of the
Father in my name, and he will give it thee: I replied, I know not what to
ask, and therefore desired that power to teach me what I should ask; he
answered me again, and bad me ask Wisdom in the first place; whereupon I
desired also that God would give me such things as were most for his glory, and
the good of others; whereunto the power answered, That my request was granted,
and that I should also be indewed with the gift of Prophecy, and singing
praises to God; wherewith being satisfied; I went to another Meeting within an
hour after, at William Doddings house in Kendale, which was the fifth and last
Meeting that I was at with them, where Christopher Atkinson being Speaker, I
was much more affected with what he spoke. then formerly, as being able more
inwardly to witness in part to what he spoke. After he had done, and a little
pause had, the company rose up, as if they had been ready to depart; I my self
was ready to go away with the first, but the Wife of the house (Isa. Dodding)
took me by the hand; and wringing it very hard, had me sit down again, which
I did, and presently after, one John Audland stood up, and began to speak,
saying, Cannot you watch one hour? and so proceeded after the usual manner.
In the time of his speaking, I was by the power within me, drawn from the
Chair upon which I sat, and thrown upon the ground. in the midst of the
Company, where I lay all Night; all which time, my body, and all the members of
it, were still in motion, I being turned from my back to my belly, and so back
again several times, and making erosses continually, with my Legs one over
the other; my hands also were carried to and fro upon the ground by a
compulsive power, as if I had been Writing upon the ground; in all
which-actions and motions, I acted not in the least measure by a natural power
of mine own, neither did I resist, or could I resist that power which acted
me, but was altogether passive, I was persuaded that it was the immediate power
of Christ, and heard, to my thinking, a Voice speaking to me, and saying, That
that Writing with my hand upon the ground, did signify the Writing of the Law
within my heart. Having layne all Night upon the ground, in the manner
aforesaid, the power (as before in other actions) moved my hands to my head,
and laid them upon the top thereof fast closed together; whereupon I heard a
Voice saying, Christ in God, and God in Christ, and Christ in thee; which words
I was compelled to sing forth before the company in a strange manner, and with
such a Voice as was not naturally mine own: I sung also diverse phrases of
Scripture, which were given into me: after which, I was raised from the ground,
and set upon my Feet by the power within me, which bad me be humble, and
brought me down again upon my knees, and with a whispering Voice said to me,
Stoop low, low; and having stooped near the ground with my Face, it said to
me, Take up thy Cross and follow me; whereupon arising. I was led out of the
house (by the back door) down to the River, and back again from thence into
the Town another way where I was sensibly drawn down the street, and caused
suddenly to turn aside to a door of an house (my self not knowing who lived
in it) two of the said company following me all the time, (viz.) William
Dodding, and John Audland, and seeing me to go to that door. said, Whether
will thou go? this is the Fiddlers house; I answered Whose house soever it be,
Christ leads me hither, and hither I must go; whereupon my hand was carried to
knock at the door, and commanded by a Voice to say, Behold, Christ stands at
the door and knockes; after a while the Fiddler opened, and I was led into the
house, not speaking any thing unto him, where my hand was carried to a
Bace-Violl, hanging up in the house; I took it down, and began to play upon
it with my fingers, and was immediately compelled to fall a dancing. which I
seldom or never in all my life did before; hereupon I questioned what power it
should be that carried me forth to such actions, to which the Voice within me
replied, This is not because I love Music, for I hate it; but to signify
unto thee what joy there is in Heaven at thy conversion; as also, what
spiritual Melody then shall have hereafter: Then I was led out of the house
into the street, and so carried along through the Town, being moved to
Proclaim as I went, I am the way the truth, and the life, with other
expressions to like purpose; after which, I was brought to mine own house, the
aforesaid William Dodding going along with me, acknowledged, that he had no
power to leave me all this time; being come home, the same power would not
suffer me to rest, but cast me upon the ground and caused me to make Circles
round about the house with my hand, with many the like actions, telling me,
that I was putting off the old man; my hand also was carried to take up a stone
which lay upon the floor (which in my apprehension was in the form of a man's
heart) the Voice within me telling me, That Christ had taken that stone out of
my heart, and given me an heart of flesh, and my hand was moved to hold it
forth to the spectators, and my tongue to utter this sentence, Except you see
signs and wonders you will not believe; and throwing the aforesaid stone
amongst them, I said, Lo, here is my heart of stone; afterward, being cast
upon the ground upon my back, the Voice spoke to me, saying, Thou shall have
two Angels to keep thee, whereupon immediately two Swallows descended down the
Chimney, and sat upon a shelfe over against the place where I lay; this,
others in the house besides my self, beheld, and I cried to them, My Angels,
my Angels, being persuaded that they were Angels from Heaven, and that it was a
fulfilling the promise; I held out my hand toward them, expecting they should
have come to me, but they did not, but ascended up the Chimney, though both the
door and the window were open.

I was also by the same power carried out of doors upon my hands and knees
into the street which my Wife and other seeing, endeavored to hinder me. but I
told them, I would not be hindered, but leave Wife, Children, and all to follow
Christ; in his manner I went up the street, thinking that I bore a Cross upon
my neck, and continued in this motion, till some pulled me out of the mire and
dirt, and by force carried me into the house again; whereupon I was moved to
point to one of them which brought me in, and to say to her, Christ points at
thee, thou art a wicked woman, and have hindered the work of the Lord; then
one Voice asked me where my Cross was, telling me, I had scatered it,
whereupon I was moved to make a Cross with my finger upon the floor, and
forced to set my head upon it, playing topsie turvie, or bull necks, thinking
then I had re-taken up my Cross; in these actions I was kept a long while,
having many Scripture expressions given me, to the admiration of all that heard
me; sometimes I was forced to leap and dance, this expression being given in
to me, Now I have finished the work which thou gave me to do, thinking my
Redemption then fully accomplished; but my joy continued not, for I was cast
down again, and the Voice told me, I had offended God in attributing that to
my self, which was proper to Christ; whereupon I was cast upon the ground, and
lying upon my belly, I was forced to lick the dust, and my hand carried to
strike extraordinarily upon my head, having a Voice given me, That no sin
must go unpunished; so creeping up and down the house, I heard a Voice
saying, Where is thy Cross? upon which, looking aside, I thought I saw a
visible Cross hanging in a thread, which with my hand I put behind my neck; I
was kept in these postures all that day till evening, when many Quakers came in
to me, who spoke nothing but thus, Be lowly, mind thy condition, and hearken to
the voice within; not giving any words of comfort or reproof, or putting up
any Petition at all for me, but departed, leaving me in this condition; my
strength being almost spent, and my body much consumed by continual
restlessenesse: Two of them offered to watch with me that Night, but I refused,
talling them I was well, whereupon they departed. After this, my Wife and
Family being gone to Bed, I being alone in the house, began to recollect my
self, and to question whether that power by which I had been so strangely
acted, were Divine, or Diabolical? whereupon I was immediately struck with a
pannick fear, and my hand was carried to take up a Knife which lay upon the
Table, which being done, my hand was carried with it toward my throat, and the
Voice said to me, Open a hole there, and I will give thee the words of eternal
life; whereupon I answered, What, with a Knife? and so threw the Knife away,
being confident it was a temptation, from which I desire God to deliver me: My
Wife being in Bed in the next Room, and hearing me speak when none was with
me, came out, and desired me to go to Bed, which I did, at her entreaty: all
the Night following I was fully resolved, that it was the Devils power that had
acted me all along formerly, and was persuaded that I was really possessed with a
Devil, which must be ejected; and in the morning I verily thought that a
Devil went out of me, at which instant I roared very hidiously, crying, Now is
the Devil gone out of me, at which instant, I and my Family heard it thunder,
(though none in the Town besides, heard it) which made me think it was the
Devil, he being the Prince of the power of the Air; soon after, the same
power came under another notion, and told me, That it was Satan that had
possessed and led me heretofore, but now Christ was come, and he by his power had
cast oui Satan, and convinced me, that what ever I had done the day before, was
in obedience to Satan, and that as I had served the Devil all the day before
in my clothes, so that day I must undo all that I had formerly done, only in
my shirt in Obedience to Christ; which immediately I endeavored, rising out of
my Bed, and going into the street with my shirt only; but my Wife and others,
soon laid hold upon me, and stopped me; whereupon, the power within me, told me,
That I must be carried into the house with four women, as I had been the day
before, or else I should perpetually stand there like a pillar of Salt, as Lots
Wife did: So I was borne in by four women, who carried me again into my bed;
which being done, I told them, I had been doing the Devils work the day
before, but to day I must do the work of Christ, and pointing at a woman,
whom I had pointed at the day before, said these words, the Devil told me
yesterday that you were a wicked woman; but now Christ tells me that you are
Gods Servant; the Woman being departed, I fell to acting in my shirt only,
upon the bed, as I had done formerly upon the house floor, playing topsie
turvie from one bed to another, whereby I might have undone my self; but the
power which acted me, bid me not fear, for I will give thee strentgh. After
this, the power told me, that the Devil had the other day commanded me to
bear my Cross; but now Christ commands thee to lay aside thy Cross, for
Christ takes no pleasure in Crosses, nor will he have me worship them, as
yesterday I had done: Further, the power said to me, the Devil made thee
yester day to lie all day upon the ground, but now I have provided a bed for
thee, giving in this Scripture to me, My yoke is easy; promising also, to give
me bread of life to eat, and water of life to drink, and that out of my belly
should flow Rivers of living Water; whereupon my teeth were caused to move, as
if I had been eating; and I thought I felt is my belly a flowing up and down,
as of waters; I was also persuaded that yesterday the Devils Angels had waited
on me, but now Christ's Angels should guard me; whereupon I saw two Butter-flyes
in the window, to which my hand was carried, and having taken one of them in my
hand, I was moved by the power within me to put it into my mouth and did
swallow it down into my body; which having done, I took the other in my hand,
and was moved to put it to my throat; the power telling me, it should enter in
there saying, nothing is impossible to them that be leeve. After this I was
caused to make Circles upon the bed as I had done formerly upon the ground;
whereupon I began to think that this was not of God, and so began to resist the
power by which I was acted, and thereupon fell into great fear and doubting
crying out, Lord what will thou have me to do? but the power told me, that it
was too late to cry unto God, for sentence was already pronounced against me;
whereupon I lay down in my bed much despairing, and was then convinct that it
was the Devil which had again deluded me; in which condition having layne a
short space, I was again assaulted by a power the third time, which told me,
that it was a white Devil that had received me the latter time, but now Christ
was come indeed, and he would cast him out; whereupon I apprehended that Devil
also to be ejected, after which, as I law in my bed all the members of my body
fell a working as if the pangs of death had been upon me the power telling me,
that it was the pangs of the new birth and that Christ was newborn in me,
with which I was somewhat satisfied, lying in that condition a whole day; in
which time the power persuaded me, that I should work wonders, and cast out
Devils in his name Soon after two Quakers came to me, viz. Geo Bryley and I,
Braban, whom I told that I had had two Devils cast out of me, but now Christ
was in me for a truth, then the power (pretending to be Christ) said these
words, I was crowned with a crown of thorns but I will crown thee with a crown
of glory and bad me (as a figure thereof) (...) set my fist upon my head, and it
should appear to the standers by as a glorious crown, though I saw nothing my
self; which having done I spoke to the standers by, saying, what do you see?
whereunto they gave me no answer (being Quakers) but turned their eyes another
way, the power telling me, that they saw the crown upon my head; but were so
stricken with admiration that they could not express what they saw;
immediately the power had me till one of the Quakers then present, that he had
a devil in him, and that I should have power to cast him out; whereupon I said
to him, G thou have a Devil in thee, the power told me he should quake and
tremble which immediately he did; the power bade me speak to him to fall flat
upon the ground which he did, and after a little space rose again, and I asked
him whether the devil were gone out of him (having been before persuaded by the
power that I should cast him out) to which he gave me no answer but the power
told me that the Devil was ejected; I was told also by the same power, who (of
those that came to see me) had devils, and who not; and that my wife and my
mother had devils in them, but I had power given me to cast them out. After
this beginning again to question whether this were Christ or not, I fell into
great fear and doubting as formerly; whereupon the devil discovered himself to
be the devil, and told me, that all this while I had been serving him, and
blaspheming God, and that it was now too late to repent, whereupon I was
brought into despair for a time, thinking every thing which I either heard or
saw, to be the Devil come to fetch me away: one while I thought that I should
be taken away in a flame of fire or else that the earth would swallow me up
quick; whereupon I called my wife and desired her to bring up my children in
the fear of God, for the devil would fetch me away, my self still thinking
that he was drawing me out of the bed; thus I apprehended my self wholly under
the power of the devil, and had no power to recover my self out of that sad
condition. At last I began (having been so long deluded) to desist from
harkening to the voice within me and apply my self unto God, in and through
Christ, for deliverance from the power of Satan, knowing that God was able to
deliver me, though I were so far involved in the snare of the devil,
thereupon my faith was in some measure raised to believe that God would deliver
me; whereupon I was presently in a great agony and did sweat extremely, in
which condition I continued all night, but was somewhat more cheerful in the
morning esteeming my self in some measure rescued from the power of the
devil: yet having not resolved, as yet finally to desert that way, I was soon
again assaulted by the same power, telling me, that now the devil was finally
cast out of me, and that the room within me must not be left empty, but that
Christ must come and have the whole, and sole possession, or else Satan would
return and re-enter with seven other Devils worse then himself, telling me
withal that he was Christ, and soliciting me to entertain and embrace him as
he had done formerly: I resisted the suggestions of this power for a time,
having ben so often deluded; whereupon as a motive to persuade me to entertain
it, he represented to my memory all, or most of the remarkable passages of my
life, both in England and Scotland, told me how long I should live, viz. ten
years, and where I should die, viz. at London, and that I had a weak body,
but he would strengthen it, and thereupon caused me to rub my body all over
with my hands, at which instant I conceived my body to receive strength, and
the members thereof to be more in substance then before; with diverse other
passages, promising me prosperity in the world, and speaking these words to me
John 4.29, Behold, a man that has told thee all things that ever thou did,
is not this Christ? whereupon I was at last persuaded to embrace this power,
thinking that it was Christ indeed; whereupon I was presently sensible of a
working throughout my whole body, which soon ceased, and then I thought that
my condition was good, and Christ to be really in me: afterward this power
told me, that J had highly offended God in all my forms passages in giving way
to Satan, and that I was guilty of all sins except that against the holy
Ghost, but told me, that I did it ignorantly, and therefore he had pity on me;
I was further persuaded by the same power, that J should lie (seemingly) dead,
which I did, not daring to stir, til the power moved me. Lying thus a while,
the power began first to move one of my legs, and then the other; after that my
hands, and then my head, and at last my whole body; causing me to sit up in my
bed; and telling me, that thus should my body be quickened and raised up again
at the last day: then the power told me, that I must pull off my shirt, and my
cap, and the napkin which I had about my neck, saying that whatsoever was about
me was polluted, and that he hated the garments spotted with the flesh;
whereupon I pulled them off, and threw them on the ground, uttering these same
words, that I hated the garments spoted with the flesh: the power also told me,
that all my bonds were broken, and my cords loosened, and that Christ had set
me free; whereupon calling for a clean shirt, and other linen, I arose;
concluding my self to be in a good condition; yet finding my self being up, no
better, nor my body more strengtheed, but rather weakened, J began to see that
I had been deluded in this last business as formerly; whereupon I was stricken
with fear, and walking into the Garden, I thought one while that the Devil
would pull me into the earth, and another while that he would pull me into the
air, so that I was afraid to continue abroad, and came again into the house,
and suspected every thing that I heard to be the Devil waiting to fetch me
away; being in this perplexity of soul, I began to consider how grievously I
had offended God in rejecting the use of all external means; as reading,
hearing, prayer, etc. in the use whereof God has commanded us to wait upon
him, and therefore that it was most just with him to leave me to my self, and
to give me over to strong delusion, that I should believe lies, which was my
condition for a time, by the just judgment of God upon me, as for other
provocations, so especially for rejecting the revealed will of God in his Word,
and harkening only to a voice within me; because what was spoken by it, was
seconded by lying Wonders, of which God has given notice in his Word, that so
his people might not give credit to them, nor be deluded by them. I hope the
Reader will so far give heed to what I have related concerning my self, as
to learn thereby to take heed of being imposed upon by the devil, though he
does transform himself into an angel of light; which advantage if any reap
by it, I have my end: it has been no small burden to my conscience (since
Gods gracious deliverance of me from this snare) that I should so far
gratify the grand Adversary, as not only to listen to his suggestions, and
embrace his voice for the voice of Christ, but also wholly to neglect those
means, in the constant and conscientious use whereof God has promised to
reveal himself unto his people, and to give in comfort to them, which because
I found not (though through my own desault) I did in effect say, why should I
wait for the Lord any longer? and so turned unto lying vanities. Oh, that all
who affect novelties, would seriously consider of it, and take warning by it;
for, Turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur: It is easier to withstand the devil
at his first assault, then to expel him being once admitted. Many besides my
self, have bin, and are in the like conditon but few or none to whom the Lord
has manifested his Grace in such a manner as to my self: I had before this
made this known to the world, had I had tranquillity of conscience, and
composure of spirit; which blessing, the Lord having in his grace restored to
me, I desire the Christian Reader to join with me in returning praises unto
the Lord for his goodness toward me; I rest fully persuaded, and I think it
does evidently appear (by what is mentioned in this Relation) to persons
unprejudiced, that my quaking and trembling was of the devil, that I was
acted, wholly and solely by him whilst in this condition, and I do really
believe, that others in the like condition which I was then in would be of the
same mind with me upon serious trial of their condition by the principles of
Christian Religion, and sanctified Reason; least the strangeness of some
passages in this Relation, should put the faith of any one upon the rack or
make them question the truth thereof; I have not only given testimony my
self of it, by subscribing my name, but also procured several, persons of
known fidelity living in, or near Kendale, (whose names are under-writen) to
testify the probability (if not, the certainty) of the truth of it, by what
they have seen and heard.

JOHN GLPIN.

I believe this Relation to be true, Edward Turner Mayor of Kendale. By what J
have heard of the carriage of John Gilpin, and his actings, I do believe this
Relation to be true, John Archer. I saw him when he went through the Town,
declaring himself the way, truth, and life. Ja. Cock. We believe this
Relation to be true. T. Walker, Pastor of Kendale. J. Myriell, Master of the
Free-Schoole there. Rich. Prissoe. Tho. Sands. Allan Gilpin. John Washington.
