His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Monday the
9th of November, 1685.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
AFter the Storm that seemed to be coming upon Us when We parted last, I am
glad to Meet you all again in so great Peace and Quietness, God Almighty be
Praised by whose Blessing that Rebellion was Suppressed: But when I Reflect what
an inconsiderable Number of Men began it, and how long they Carried it on
without any Opposition, I hope every body will be Convinced that the Militia,
which has hitherto been so much depended on, is not sufficient for such
Occasions; And that there is nothing but a good Force of well Disciplined
Troops in constant Pay, that can Defend Us from such as either at Home or
Abroad are disposed to Disturb Us. And in truth, My Concern for the Peace and
Quiet of My Subjects as well as for the Safety of the Government, made Me think
it necessary to increase the Number to the Proportion I have done; This I owed
as well to the Honor as to the Security of the Nation, whole Reputation was so
infinitely Exposed to all Our Neighbors, by having layen Open to this late
wretched Attempt, that it is not to be Repaired without keeping such a Body of
Men on foot, that none may ever have the Thought again of finding Us so
miserably unprovided; It is for the Support of this Great Charge which is now
more then Double to what it was, that I ask your Assistance in Giving Me a
Supply answerable to the Expense it brings along with it; And I cannot doubt
but what I have Begun so much for the Honor and Defense of the Government,
will be Continued by you with all the Cheerfulness and Readiness that is
Requisite for a Work of so Great importance.

Let no man take Exception that there are some Officers in the Army not
qualified according to the late Tests, for their Employments; The Gentlemen I
must tell you are most of them well known to Me, and having formerly Served
with me in several Occasions, and always approved the Loyalty of their
Principles by their Practice, I think them fit now to be Employed under Me, and
will deal plainly with you, That after having had the Benefit of their Services
in such time of Need and Danger, I will neither Expose them to Disgrace, nor My
Self to the Want of them, if there should be another Rebellion to make them
Necessary to Me.

I am afraid some men may be so wicked to hope and expect, That a Difference
may happen between you and Me upon this Occasion; but when you consider what
Advantages have arisen to Us in a few Months by the good Understanding We have
hitherto had, What wonderful Effects it has already produced in the Change of
the whole Scene of Affairs Abroad, so much more to the Honor of the Nation,
and the Figure it ought to make in the World, and that nothing can hinder a
further Progress in this way to all Our Satisfactions, but Fears and Jealousies
amongst Our Selves: I will not apprehend That such a Misfortune can befall Us
as a Division, or but a Coldness between Me and you; Nor that any thing can
shake you in your Steadiness and Loyalty to Me, who by Gods Blessing will ever
make you all Returns of Kindness and Protection, with a Resolution to Venture
even My own Life, in the Defense of the true Interest of this Kingdom.

FINIS.
