To the Right Honorable the COMMONS in PARLIAMENT assembled. The humble
Petition of Sir John Lenthal, Knight.
Humbly shows,
THat your Petitioner has paid, as Surety, the sum of Three thousand pounds
for the Debts of Sir Peter Temple, Knight and Baronet, late deceased; and is
engaged for other great sums for him.

For the payment whereof, there was a settled Agreement betwixt Sir Richard
Temple Baronet, his son and heir, and diverse Creditors whom he made Trustees
for the payment of his Debts.

The said Sir Richard Temple has obtained the said Agreement into his own
custody.

To discover which, your Petitioner did long ago prefer his Bill in Equity; to
which the said Sir Richard Temple did appear in the time of the late
Prorogation, yet stood in contempt; and now stands upon his privilege: So that
your Petitioner and his whole Family are inevitably ruined, if not speedily
relieved by your Honors, as by the Cafe annexed appears.

Your Petitioner humbly prays, that it may be referred to a Committee to
examine, and report the same to your Honors. And your Petitioner shall ever
pray, etc.

To the Right Honorable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the House of
COMMONS now assembled in PARLIAMENT.
The Case and humble Petition of Sir John Lenthal, Knight, one of the Creditors
of Sir Peter Temple, Knight and Baronet, deceased.
IN all humbleness showing, That by Articles indented and made, by and between
the aforesaid Sir Peter Temple, Dame Christian Temple his wife, and Richard
Temple son and heir of the said Sir Peter Temple, of the one part; and George
Coney Esquire, John Holcroft Esquire Henry Sandys Esquire Harman Beckman Esquire Francis
Harrington, and others, the Creditors of the said Sir Peter Temple of the other
part, bearing date the 15th day of August, 1653. It was provided and agreed,
That the Lands of the said Sir Peter Temple, of the yearly value of 3800 l and
the Woods growing upon the same, worth 10000 l should be sold, or so disposed
of for payment of the Debts of the said Sir Peter Temple; as well to the
persons in the said Articles indented mentioned, as to other the Creditors of
the said Sir Peter; and for the discharge of such Surety or Sureties of the
said Sir Peter, who by Action or Execution were, or might be charged for the
Debt of the said Sir Peter; as in and by the said Articles (if the same might
be produced) would more fully appear.

That for the better performance of the said Articles, and provision to be made
for the payment of the Debts of the said Sir Peter, and discharge of his
Sureties as aforesaid, the said Sir Richard, when he came of full age, made
another Indenture between himself and Dame Christian Temple of the one part,
and the Creditors aforesaid, and all other Creditors of Sir Peter Temple,
deceased, of the other part: And thereupon a Fine was levied, and a Recovery
suffered by the said Sir Richard Temple in Easter Term, in the year of our Lord
1655, of the Manors and Lands in the said Articles mentioned, for the end to
satisfy the said Sir Peter's Debts.

That the said Sir Richard Temple afterward compounded for part of the said
Scheduled Debts of the said Sir Peter, to the value of 10000 l at 7 s -- 6 d
the pound, as this Petitioner is informed, but did not pay many of the
aforesaid Creditors mentioned in the aforesaid Articles, for which your
Petitioner was Surety for the said Sir Peter Temple deceased, who has since
been enforced to pay the same; and yet the said Sir Richard has gained and
gotten into possession of the said Estate of the said Sir Peter, of the yearly
value aforesaid; and has not taken any order to indempnifie your Petitioner,
or to satisfy many of the Scheduled Creditors of their just Debts; or to make
any provision for the payment of the said Debts to your Petitioner, being a
Surety for Sir Peter, as aforesaid, for which he has been since sued, and
enforced to pay a great part of them, and is inevitably presently upon the
ruin of himself and his whole family thereby.

For as much as your Petitioner is remediless, but in this High and Honorable
Court; being also sued at this time for several other Debts of the said Sir
Peter Temple's, as his Surety, to his inevitable ruin and undoing suddenly:
Yet the said Sir Richard Temple (being a Member of this House, and pleading his
Privilege) refuses to make satisfaction, notwithstanding your Petitioner
preferred his Bill in Chancery against him, who appeared thereunto since the
late Prorogation of this Parliament, yet has put in no Answer thereunto.

May it therefore please your Honors (the premises considered) that the
Delays of the said Sir Richard Temple, tending to the present ruin of your
Petitioner, may not be made use of to defeat your Petitioner what is justly due
unto him, for Moneys lent unto the said Sir Peter Temple, Debts paid for him,
or Securities entered into for him, not yet satisfied; but that such of the said
Lands and Woods, settled as aforesaid, may be speedily sold, and the Lands may
be settled according to the Articles for Payment and Indemnity of your
Petitioner: And that the said Sir Richard Temple may answer the Premises; or
that your Honors will cause the Lands so settled, as aforesaid, to be employed
to the discharge of your Petitioner, and other the Creditors, according to the
Articles and Fine; As to your great Wisdoms shall seem meet.


And your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc.
