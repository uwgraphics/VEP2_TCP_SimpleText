The Divils cruelty to Mankind.
BEING A true Relation of the Life and Death of George Gibbs, a Sawyer by his
Trade, who being many times tempted by the Divill to destroy himself, did on
Friday being the 7 of March 166^* Most cruelly Ripp up his own Belly, and
pulled out his Bowels and Guts, and cut them in pieces: to the Amazement of
all the Beholders, the sorrow of his Friends, and the great grief of his Wife,
being not long married: and both young People.

To the Tune of The Two Children in the Wood.


GOod Christian People lend an Ears,
to this my doleful Song,
A sadder tale yon nere did hear,
expressed by any tongue:
The Divill has very busy been,
now in these latter days,
For to entrap, and to draw in,
poor souls by several ways.
He tempt's not only them that be,
given over to all vice,
But such has lives most Civelly,
be strives most to entice,
As by this Subject now in hand,
which I shall here unfold,
As much as I could understand,
the truth by neighbors told.
George Gibbs a Sawyer, by his Trade,
and did in Hounds Ditch dwell,
A very civell man it is said,
and lived indifferent well,
Not long time Married as I hear,
nor charge lay on his hand,
Nor yet no^ babis as he did fear,
as I do understand.
His Wife and he lived lovingly,
'twixt them noe discontent,
A very good report has she,
her case most to lament,
On Friday being the Seventh day,
of March, some did me tell,
Gibbs often his Penknife whets they say,
that night this Chance bef^ll.


AT twelve a clock at night he rose,
his Wife being then a bed,
And down to ease himself he goes,
thus to his Wife he said,
His Wife persuaded him to stay,
but he was fully bent,
The Divill prompting him on 's way,
and out he present went,
When he came there he shut the door,
and out his Penknife slip't,
His Belly wi^h it Cut and tore,
and out his Bowels rip't,
His careful Wife did present rise,
but when s^e did come there,
And did behold it with her eyes,
she trembled with such fear.
Few words she spoke to him but went
and in some Neighbore brought,
Thinking the worst for to prevent,
and save his life they thought,
Whilst she was gone he made the Door
fast to himself within,
But they did break and down it tore,
and suddenly got in.
His Belly he had rip't up quite,
and out his Bowels ^^re,
That such a Devilish bloody sight,
scarce shown by man before,
The Divill did do it to be sure,
(...) he could nere proceed,
His strength and heart could nere endure
to do that cruel deed.
Some of his Gutts were cut in two,
and mangled in such sort,
That he himself could never do,
but had some helper sor't
Eight hours or more this man did live,
in grievous woe and pain,
What Sustinance they did him give,
came straight way forth again.
The Divill he said did temp't him long,
and many times before,
For all he did resist him strong,
he nere would give him ore,
Thus have you heard the doleful end,
of Gibbs, which is too true,
And take this council from a Friend,
for fear you after rue.
Trust not too much to your own strength
to God continual pray
Resist the Divil el^s at length,
he will lead you his Broad way,
Your Swearing Dam-me ranting-boyes
he minds not them at all,
They are so Wedded to his ways,
he has them at his call,
While some strives all the power they have,
his ways to flee and shun
For some there be that counts it brave:
to Hell hear-long to run,
Now to conclude I wish you Friend^,
to God for ever pray,
To keep you from untimely Ends,
and guide you his right way
