To the Right HONORABLE, ROBERT, Lord Bruce, Baron of Byfleet, and only Son
to the Right Honorable Thomas, Earl of Elgin.
Eleasar Gilbert wishes all possible Happiness.
Right Honorable,
I Have placed you here in the Frontispiece of my Dedicatory, first because you
have a chief place in my affections as one whom God has graced with a more
than ordinary portion of his Image, for (to speak without Flattery) what Grace?
what Virtue? what endowment, either of body, mind, or fortune? Finally, what
Perfection or Excellency can make men truly Honorable on Earth, and eternally
happy in Heaven, which does not shine in your Lordship, in the fullest luster,
so far as your condition and years can be capable of? insomuch that if it
please the Lord, to addc years unto your life, as he has gifts unto your
person, a star more radiant then your self, I conceive, in our age will
scarcely appear in our British Firmament: moreover, your Lordship may justly
challenge the first fruit of my public labors, because I had the first
encouragement tomy ministerial studies in your Honorable Family, under your
Right Honorable, most pious, and never without much Reverence to be
mentioned, Grandmother, Magdalen, Lady Bruce, where I have been an
eyewitness of your virtuous education ab imis, as I may say, incunabulis,
from your very infancy, and where I have often observed, the most vigilant and
religious care of your Right Honorable Parents, in your virtuous education,
which to this day does most spectably appear, as a pattern of imitation to all
the Nobles in the Land.

Go on therefore most Noble and hopeful Lord, good luck have you with your
Honor, continue that course, in these paths of Virtue, which you have begun to
tread, especially seeing you have already made so good a progress, for
Dimidium facti, qui been coepit, habet.

And you shall find, that although the way be thorny, yet the end shall be
Honorable, that pains which you now take, and have taken to please and serve
God, and your right Honorable Parents, shall produce unto you at length, not
only the favor of God, the love of your Sovereign, ^o^mendation of your
equals, and praise of all good men, but also contentment to your mind, peace
unto your conscience, protection to your person, a blessing unto your estate,
and a sweet relish to all the houours, wealth, and pleasures which you shall
afterward enjoy.

Which that you may do, I shall never be wanting in my best devotion, to
implore the gracious assistance of that Father of lights, the Watchman of
Israel, to double his spirit upon you, and wheresoever you go, for good to be
present with you, to guard you by his Providence, guide you by his counsel,
and when he has here satiated your Lordship with honors and pleasures
temporal, bring you at length unto joys and happiness eternal. So prays
he, who desires to be reputed as he is

One of your Lordships most ancient and affect onately devoted Servants,
Eleazar Gilbert.
From my Study in St. Mary-Axe, this 8. December. 1641.
A True Description of the present estate of the Reformed Protestant Churches
within the Kingdom of Poland, etc.
THe industrious policy, or rather politic industry of the Roman Clergy, for
advancing their cause, and promoting the Papisticall Hierarchy, is as much (if
not more commendable) then was that of the injust Steward, Luke 16. 8. did it
not cross the word, or Law of God, (which is the rule of righteousness) and
break the bond of charity, which is the complement and perfection of that Law.
For what pains do they not take? How do they stretch their wits? What
Countries peopled, or worthy to be known or inhabited, have they not
peragrated? to accomplish their designs, and zealous (if I may so call them)
devotions.

So that if their cause were good, and their laborious endeavors to manage
that cause guided by a good Spirit, or squared to the rule of Justice, they
should certainly be no less then that which they call themselves and pretend
to be, (namely) The only true Catholic Church of Christ, that Royal
Priesthood, and chosen Generation mentioned by the Apostle Peter.

But true wisdom (which is from above) is only justified by her children,
who do judge and estimate things, (especially in matters of Religion and
Divine worship) not as men value them, but as God esteems them, For God sees
not as men see; man oftentimes (by reason of the corruption of his heart,
weakness of judgment, perversion of will, and imperfection of knowledge, and
understanding) may both deceive and be deceived; but so cannot God, who being
all eye, estimateth and knows all things perfectly, and essentially, (as they
are) as having within himself the express and true pattern and Ideas of all
things that ever have been, are, or shall be.

That therefore men, (I mean only Christian men who are within the Pale. of
Gods Church) may be the better settled and persuaded in the truth of that
Religion which they do profess. It will be most necessary and profitable for
them, to take special notice of some marks and symptoms, whereby the true
and orthodoxe Religion or Church of Christ may be distinguished and discerned
from all false, Antichristian, phanaticall, inventions, traditions,
enthusiasmes, and in a word, from all heretical, pragmaticall, schismatic
or diabolical opinions, imaginations, doctrines and professions in the world:
which for brevities sake, and that I may sooner come to my intended scope, I
will only at this time name, leaving the more large explication of them unto
some other Trearise.

1 The first is the purity, or rather (as I may say) the spirituality of a
Religion, as it is cleansed from the dross of external ceremonies and
exorbitant superstitions, for Almighty God loves best that Religion or manner
of his worship, which is most like himself, and agreeable to his word, who
being a Spirit, will be worshipped in Spirit and truth, the more therefore that
a Religion has of outward and gaudy Pompes and Ceremonies (to dazzle and delude
the fancies, eyes, and affections of the ingorant and simple) it is the farther
from the nature of God, the more contrary to his will, it has more dross, and
is the more to be suspected of falsehood, and to be Antichristian and idolatrous.

2 Secondly, the more that the grounds, doctrine, discipline and tenets of a
Religion, are adverse or to do cross the corruption of nature, the impurity of
man's life and manners, the fulfilling and executing of a man's own excessive
lusts and desires, I say, that that Religion is the more like to be orthodoxe
and sound, my reason is, because God (being of pure eyes, with whom dwells no
iniquity) is a God of order, both inwardly in respect of himself, and
outwardly, in respect of his creatures; inwardly, in respect of himself, there
is a prioritie of order of the Father before the Son, of the Son before the
Holy Ghost; outwardly, and in respect of the creatures, God made all things in
order and measure, yea in such order and measure, that each creature keeps
its own course and station, (I speak not in regard of corrupted, but created
nature) for the mutual comfort and conservation one of another: the more then
that we cross order and measure, the more I say that we are excessive and
exorbitant in our affections and actions (especially in matters and exercises
of Religion and Divine worship) the greater cause have we to suspect our
selves, and that Religion which we profess, or which teaches or warranteth us
so to do; for what is sin, but an obliquity in our affections and actions,
and what is holiness, or true Religion? but a conformity and rectitude of both
these being suitable to Gods revealed will, which is the rule of righteousness,
that Religion therefore, whose doctrine teaches us most conformity and
rectitude in our affections and actions to Gods word, must of necessity be a
true and sound Religion: this is the second.

3 A third mark of true Religion is, when the doctrins, and practice thereof
do tend more to the advancement of the honor and glory of Christ then our
own worldly or private profit and advantage, and when they do affect us with
a sense and feeling of our own wants and unworthiness, so that we are ready
to say (not with the Pharisee, I am not like this man, I have done thus and
thus) nor with the Papist, I have performed this work of condignity, that of
congruity, a third of supererogation, by the working or doing whereof, I have
deserved eternal life, both for my self and others) but rather confess with
the Apostle, Non sunt condignae, these our momentary sufferings are not worthy
of that glory that shall be revealed, and with that good Martyr, only Christ,
only Christ, or with that worthy Father, Meritum meum miserationes Domini,
only the Lords mercies are my chiefest merits.

4 Fourthly, that is surely a sound and warrantable Religion, wherein most
comfort is afforded and ministered to a distressed and perplexed conscience,
through the assured confidence of Gods love in our own Election, especially at
the approach of death. For (whereas some false and pretended Religions, for
sinistrous and bad ends, teach, that it is great and damnable presumption, to
believe or be certainly persuaded, that God has elected us to salvation, or
that we can have in this life any certain feeling of Gods love in the pardon
of our sins; True and pure Religion exhorts us with Saint Peter, to give
diligence to make our own calling and election sure, and no ways to doubt,
but to believe, (for he that doubts believes not, and makes God a liar) to
believe I say, and be persuaded with Saint Paul, that nothing can separate us
from his love, but that Christ shall be both in life and death our advantage.

5 I could also mention a fifth mark of true Religion, which is this, namely
when the principles and doctrines thereof do not only teach, but move the
professors thereof (although, in respect of persons innumerable, yet in respect
of opinion and affection, to be as one man, when of many hundreds or thousands
of men and women that assemble themselves, and enter into the place of Gods
worship, the habitation of Gods House, it can be said as it was of these in the
Primitive Church (...), they all entered into the Church, as one man; but
because I am to speak more largely of this point about the end of this
Treatise, and I am loath that my City should, as they say, run out at the
gates, or my preface prove larger then my History; Let these few passages serve
to assure the Reader, that such (as is premised) is our Religion, ours, I say,
de^ended and taught in this Angelike Monarchy, the doctrines that we do
maintain, the truths that we do believe, and the Circumstances, which I would
at this time commend to the serious observation of all my brethren and
Countrie-men, especially to these that are addicted to the Roman Sea, within
the Kingdom of Great Britain or elsewhere, to the effect they may (not only
apprehend and perceive) the true and solid grounds, which our Religion and
Church is built upon, which is not the person, or succession of one particul^r
Peter; but the doctrine and faith of many thousand Paul's, or parvuli Christi,
even of all true Christians, who by humility and faith, depend upon the merits
of the Son of God, and the gracious promises revealed in his word, or
inspired Scriptures which were given unto men, not by men, not by any humane
tradition or invention, but by Divine inspiration being profitable of
themselves, through the working of the Holy Ghost, to instruct, reprove,
correct, and make the man of God perfect, wise unto salvation, and furnished
unto every good work; But also behold and know the sandy foundation of the
Romish Church, and all other pretended, srothy, heretical, fantastical,
phanaticall, schismatic fr^ctious and factious, Idolatrous and superstitious
Religions in the world, which is no other but quircks and tricks of fleshly,
worldly and natural wisdom, not able soundly and savingly, to perceive the
things that are of the Spirit of God, yet permitted by God to remain in his
Church, for the correcting, disciplining, and exercising of his militant
members, who without such things would freeze to death, and settle themselves
upon the lees of natural corruption, and like an Ox to the slaughter, run
on with others, and precipitate themselves in that broad way that leads to
destruction.

And likewise in the third place, with grief of heart bemoane the intolerable
pride, insatiable avarice, unlimited ambition, unquenchable malice, hatred and
tyranny, which the Romanists do exercise, and wherewith their chief
Prelates, Doctors and ghostly Fathers do burn against their innocent,
orthodoxe, and reformed brethren, and whereby they would ingrosse unto
themselves, (wheresoever they take footing or bear sway) all power, authority
and privileges, as well in Civil as Ecclesiastical affairs, fearing and
sparing no lies, reproaches, calumnies, perjuries, murders, which, either the
devils malice, or man's wickedness can invent, for accomplishing their Politic
designs, and Machiavel-like machinations, against all their opposers.

The truth whereof we shall see to appear plainly, (as in many other parts
of Europe, whereof also I suppose, this Kingdom cannot be insensible) so
especially in the Kingdom of Poland, and more particularly in the great City
of Vilna or the Wild, the metropolis of Lithuania, a City for sumptuous
Churches, fair buildings, multitude of people, frequency of commerce, and in a
word, abundance of all good things, (except liberty of conscience and true
Religion) little inferior to the City of London, being situated in the heart
or center of seven or eight ancient Kingdoms, now annexed and allied to the
Crown of Poland, and namely, Lithuania, Samogitia, Courlandia, Livonia,
Alba-Russia, Prussia, and Massovia, near unto which City, the Author hereof
has ministered these three years last past, to a Congregation of Scots and
English within the Town of Keydan, which belongs unto that most famous and
Illustrious Prince, and chief Protector of the Reformed Religion, Ianussius
Radzivil, Duke of Birz and Dubinka, Prince of the sacred Roman Empire, Lord
high Chamberlain of the great Dukedom of Lithuania, Administrator of
Mohilovia, Governor of Kasimerski, and Kameninski, etc. Who in anno 1638. with
the approbation and consent of a Synod holden at the Wild, received him into
the number of his stipendiary Ministers, as appears more at length by his
Certificate.

This great City aforesaid, is the Tribunal, or place of Justice for the said
great Dukedom of Lithuania, having a great University, of almost an innumerous
multitude of Students who resort thither for learning, and education,
especially in the Romish Religion, from all places and corners of the Kingdom,
and who do replenish as it were, or rather pester the whole City. There be
also therein many Relig^ons professed and tolerated, whereunto also belong many
Churches and places of Divine worship, as a Synagogue to the Jews, whereof
there be many thousands in that City; a Ruthenian Church to the Russians; a
Mahumetan Church to the Tartatians; a Church to the Lutherans; all which do
enjoy their exercises of Religion without trouble or interruption; These all
being (in respect, either of Idolatry, superstition or errors, in league and
consanguinity joined with the Papists) whereof the maine body of that City and
Kingdom does consist.

Now amongst the rest, and a little before the decease of the Illustrious
Prince Duke Christopher Radzivil, of most honorable and blessed memory, who
departed this life in the month of August 1640. at his Palace in Vizounez, and
was most magnificently buried at Vizounka twenty miles distant from the
aforesaid City, in the great Dukedom of Lithuania, upon the twelfth of
February last, whereof the Author was an eyewitness; a little I say before
his departure, there was also within the aforesaid City, a fair, spacious,
and strong Church which belonged to the Protestants, whom they call Calvinists,
and whose Church by the Romanists is termed in derision by the name of Zbor, or
Congregation, whereunto also is adjoined a Dutch Church, both built of
freestone, and environed with a high, strong and thick stone-wall, guarded also
with a garrison of Musketeers and Soldiers, whom the aforesaid Prince
continually kept in pay for the safety of the said Churches and Professors*
These two Churches were situated within the heart as it were, or middle of the
City, and were invested with many privileges and liberties, as any Papist
Church in Poland, which were also established and confirmed by many Kings and
Parliaments successively unto these two Churches, (the one Polish, and the
other Dutch) belonged three Ministers, the two Polish Ministers were, Master
Balthazar Labenski, and Master Yeurski, the Dutch Minister Master Andreas, who
were assisted by George Hartibius, Rector of the Protestant College, a man of
sound learning, and unspotted conversation, as appears by the testimony of
his very adversaries given unto him in diverse places.

But because these Churches and Ministers, being situated as is said, and the
Ministers were in great repute, and much frequented by Protestant Noblemen and
Gentlemen, who resorted unto their Sermons in great Assemblies, from all places
of the Country, they could not choose but be a great eyesore unto their
neighbors the Jesuits, Priests, and Friars, whose Churches, Cloisters,
Monasteries and Colleges, were contiguous, and did incompasse them on every
side.

Behold therefore what hellish tricks and stratagems, these Jesuits* Popish
Priests and Scholars used for the abolishing of these Churches, and utter
suppressing the exercise of the Protestant Religion, and College within the
aforesaid City.

Upon the fifth of October 1639. a certain Polish Gentleman named Paul
Piekarski, with his servant Joseph Rakouski, being at guest in the house of one
Naborowuski, close adjoining to the Protestant Church, about three of the
clock in the afternoon (amongst other passages and exercises of mirth and
jollity) did shoot some Arrows at a bird or foul, which they perceived to be
upon the top of the steeple of the Protestant Church, two of which Arrows,
(there blowing then much wind) were driven to a Popish Church near joining,
called Saint Michaels, and lighting at the west end thereof, stuck into the
leg of the wooden image of an Angel. Now within the Churchyard of this
Church, was and is a great Monastery of Franciscans, some whereof issuing out
of their Cloister, perceived these Arrows sticking in the leg of the image,
which being so near the Protestant Church, and they also so desirous to pick a
quarrel against the Protestants, did straightway conceive and affirm, that
these Arrows were shot out of the Protestant Church by the Evangelick
Ministers, or by their appointment, and approbation in despite and contempt of
their Romish Religion.

The Friars acquainted the Jesuits and Priests therewith, who burning with
malice against the Protestants, and daily seeking some occasion to do them
mischief, gave order to their Scholars and Students, to fall upon these
heretical Churches, pull them down to the ground, and (if they could)
apprehend, or kill these Calvinist Ministers, whom they would needs have to be
the authors of that riot; to the performance whereof, these devote and well
disciplined Scholars were not slack, but straightwayes issued out of their
Schools and Colleges like a hive of Bees assisted and accompanied with some
thousands of Priests, Prentises and Serving men who in great fury addressed
themselves unto the aforesaid Churches, with ladders, shovels, mattoks, and
other instruments, beginning to undermine the wall, and uncover the roof of the
Protestant College.

But there being at that instant (through Gods providence) many Protestant
Noblemen, and Gentlemen with their servants, present at the Christning of one
of the Ministers children, there being also a Garrison of Soldiers, which the
aforesaid Duke kept continually in pay for the safeguard of his Churches, the
Soldiers and servants let fly a volly or two of shot amongst them, seeing
they could not by any fair means be removed; this confused Army being hereby
terrified, was presently disbanded; and perceiving they could not accomplish
their designs against the Protestant Churches, like thieves and Robbers, more
then like Christians and Scholars, being led by the Devil their Patron, they
betook themselves to the shops and houses of the Scots, French, and Dutch
Merchants there inhabiting, who for the greatest part are Protestants, breaking
open their doors, Truncks, and Cupbords, but especially the house and shop of
one Jacob de Seans, a French Merchant and Elder of the Protestants Church, from
whom they took above thirty thousand Florens in goods and money.

The day following, Duke Radzivil came to Town, who being for the time Viovode
or Governor of the City; and being also well informed in the business, did
first send for, and examine these two Gentlemen formerly mentioned, that had
shot the Arrows; who ingenuously confessed in the Tribunal before the Judges,
that they did shoot these Arrows, but not from the Protestant Church, but from
the house of one Naborouski where they were at guest, nor did they shoot them
at the Popish Church, nor in despite of the Romish Religion, but at a bird or
foul, which was upon the top of the Protestant Church, although contrary to
their expectation, they were driven by the wind, as is aforesaid, whereupon
they were ready to depose their oath; yet did they hereupon order these two
Gentlemen to be committed close prisoners, but the one of them viz. Master
Piekarski, escaped and fled into the Country.

Then did Duke Radzivil deal with the Bishop and the Jesuits, to keep in and
repress their Scholars, least they should break forth into some further
outrage against the Protestants, this he obtained with much ado, and letters
Patents affixed on all the gates and public places of the City to this
purpose.

The day following Messengers are disp^tched away on both sides, with letters
informatorie to the Kings Majesty, who was then at Warsovia 80 Polish or Dutch
miles distant from the aforesaid City, Duke Radzivil giving his majesty to
know the true information and state of the business, the Papist Bishop again
(whose name was Abrah Voyna or War) is very suitable to his nature,
exasperating his Majesty by many untruths, reproachful speeches and
blasphemies, which he surmised against the Protestants, but especially their
Ministers, (only to put them out of the favor of the King and
fellow subjects) alleging, though most impudently and falsely, that a little
before the fact of the premises, viz, the shooting of the Arrows, these
Calvin Heretics, had most profanely and blasphemously drawn the Crucifixe or
picture of our blessed Savior crucified, by the feet through the streets, as
also the Image of the blessed Virgin, spitting upon and dawbing them with dirt
and mire, thinking thereby to disgrace the Romish Religion.

But the Kings Majesty, suspecting herby the malice of his ghostly Fathers and
the iniquity of the cause, gave for the present greater credit unto the Duke
Radzivils information, and deferred the business to the next Parliament, which
was held at Warsovia. In the month of June following, in the mean time
showing his Princely care for the preservation of public peace, he sends
diverse letters to the Popish Bishops, but more particularly to the Bishop of
Vilna the aforesaid City, to the Jesuits, Priests, Monasteries and Colleges
there, giving them some private checks for their unjust proceedings, and
promising unto them the continuance of his Royal favor, and an improvement of
their immunities and privileges, if they would but desist and leave off
further prosecuting that business against Duke Radziv^ls Churches* But that
Royal fraternity of Romish Bishops and Jesuits (being to my thinking) indeed
and de facto King of Poland, were the more inflamed and exasperated hereby
against the Protestants, and therefore now think it high time to muster up all
their forces, and strain the quintessence of their deepest wit for
accomplishing their designs against them, and providing themselves for the
ensuing Parliament, to this purpose they print Libels and Pamphlets against the
Protestants, and expose them to be sold in all places of the Kingdom, they
send also privately letters informatory to all the Popish Bishops, Noblemen and
Judges of the Land, who were all addicted to the Roman Sea, and to be present
and chiefest members of the ensuing Parliament, aggravating by many odious
circumstances, how much and how far the Calvin heretics and their Preachers
were troublers of the peace of the Kingdom, and what wicked and blasphemous
insolences had been lately practiced by them in disgrace and contempt of
their Catholic Church.

The Parliament is set, and Committees on both sides appointed for hearing and
concluding the business: upon the Protestant side, were the Illustrious Duke
Radzivil aforesaid, Lord Grozewski, Lord Rey, Lord Cocholewski, and some
others, all men of admirable learning, eloquence, judgment, and integrity, who
did so truly, plainly, punctually, and in such oriental colors display the
case, and discover, these insupportable, insupposable, and unheard of injuries
practiced by the Roman Clergy against them, their brethren, Churches, lands,
and inheritances, contrary to the Kings Majesty his oath, (who at his
Coronation is solemnly sworn to maintain the peace and liberty of the
Protestants as well as of the Papists) to the Laws of the Land, acts of
Parliament, and practice of other Nations, that many of the honest Popish
Bishops and Noblemen were moved to tears and to commiserate the distress of
the said Illustrious Duke his Churches and brethren; but the maine body of the
Parliament being all Papists, and rigidly addicted to the Roman Sea, and
consequently maliciously bent against the Protestant cause, did confederate and
b^nd themselves together, against the said Duke and the other Protestants
Lords, commanding him to be silent, and not to proceed any further in
defending so b^d a cause, alleging, that they had witnesses sufficient against
them, and that the aforesaid Illustrious Duke, spoke too well for a bad
business, and was more fit to be an Attorney then a Prince.

Duke Radzivil seeing his just cause like to be overwhelmed by the malevolent
censures of a partial multitude; went to take his leave of the King, and to
inform his Majesty of their false and injurious proceedings against him; but
no sooner was he entered into conference with his Majesty in his Bedchamber,
the doors being shut, but straightway followed three Popish Bishops, viz. the
Bishop of Cracovia, the Bishop of Loobleen, and the Bishop of Thoren, who
fearing that Duke Radzivil by his speech with his Majesty should obtain some
favor to prevent their purposes (more like temporal Monarchs and Emperors)
then spiritual or Ecclesiastical Prelates, did boldly and rudely knock at the
door, persuading or rather threatening his Majesty to forsake the discourse
and company of Duke Radzivil, and to go along with them, there being at that
instant some urgent business which required his presence in the Parliament.

The day following, his Majesty sent for the Duke to dinner, but he being
ready upon his journey refused to come, and about two or three of the clock in
the afternoon (admiring the injustice and ingratitude of that people for whom
he had done so many great services, with much grief and coffeehouse
departed the City.

Immediately after his departure his Majesty being overswayed by the Popish
Prelates and Clergy men,, gave out this sentence and Decree against Duke
Radzivils Churches and Ministers, the tenor whereof follows.

Quandoquidem inquisit to legitime est peracta, ex qua evidenter, de delicto
and loco delicti constat, Quod nimirum ex coetu Evangelicorum sagittae ad
frontispicium Templi Sancti Michaelis, fuerint emissae; Ideo Sacr. Regia
Majestas discernit Moniales ad convincendum, adversa part potiores esse: quam
convictionem, ut ejusmodi Monasterii Antistita cum septem monialibus, ex eodem
Monasterio, juramentum super personas in mandato specificatas (quas ipsa sibi
elegerit Vilnae, in Tribunali com^ositi judicii, a data hujus decreti hodierna,
post octo septimanas, juxta formulam juramenti ex Cancellaria nostra Magni
Ducatus Lithuaniae extraditam expediant mandamus, depoenis infligendis, Sacr.
Reg. Majestas deliberat. In English thus, For as much as after due examination,
there is found a cle^re evidence touching this fact, and the place where it was
committed; namely that Arrows were shot from the Protestant Congregation, at
the Frontispice or forepart of Saint Michaels Church, therefore the Kings
sacred Majesty approving the cause of the Nuns to be more just and legal,
then that of the Protestants, does command and charge the Prioresse of that
same Cloister with seven Nuns more of the same Monastery, to appear in the
City of Vilna, eight weeks after the date hereof, and there take their
corporal oath before the set Bench against these parties that are convicted,
and specified in the Mandat, or against so many of them as they shall think
fitting, according to the oath used in this nature drawn out of our Chancery
Office of the great Dukedom of Lithuania, the punishment to be determined by
the Kings Majesty.

Expeditio deliberationis, ejusdem Anni die facta Maii, 26. The execution of
his Majesty's censure touching the delinquent, passed in the same year the 26
of May, In this manner.

Sacra Regia Majestas expediendo deliberationem mandat, ut personae quas
Moniales convincent, subsint poeais legum, quarum executionem quilibet
Magistratus sub poenis de negligentibus officialibus sancitis, statim post
executionem exequi debet, Et quandoquidem constat situm Ecclesiae Evangelicae,
inter Templa Romano-Catholica occasionem tam praeteritorum quam praesentiii
excessuum dedisse, and vero S. Reg, M. ratione juramenti sui regii, obligatasit
praescindere omnes occasi^nes, turbandae nedil violandae pacis inter
dissid^ntes de Religi(...) S. R^g. M. decreti hujus vigore Vniversum exercitium
Religionis dissidentium, (tam publicum quam privatum) in perpetuum ex isto loco
removet, ac ipsum etiam nomen Zbor, coetus, Consimilem in modum Scholas, and
Xenodochia, convertendo illas structuras and areas, in aedes, and fundum mere
privatum, and possessionem ejus in totum reservando illi vel illis quibus de
jure competierit, sine ullo, (vel privatissimo dissidentium exercitio; and haec
omnia expediri debent intra spatium and septimanarum post convictionem sub
poena infamiae, and sub eadem, neque in alio quoquam loco (intra Regiae
Civitatis Vilnensis maenia) tam publicum quam privatum ejusdem Religionis
excercitium, sub ullo unquam praetextu resuscitabunt. Similiter nec Scholam,
nec Xenodochium praesentis decreti vigore, exceptis his qui peregre advenient,
juxta sensum confoederationis. Interim tamen, dissidentes in hortum sepulturis
destinatum, exercitium hoc suum transfer poterunt, sub ejusdem
confoederationis securitate. Huic decreto ad majorem rei fidem Magni Ducatus
Lithuaniae sigillum appensum est. Datum Warsoviae in comitiis Regni 26 Maii
1640. Thus Englished. The Kings sacred Majesty, in the declaration of his
Decree, does command and charge, that these persons that shall be convicted by
the Nuns, be liable to the punishment of the Law, which every Magistrate whom
it does concern, presently after their conviction, shall execute under pain
of contempt. And for as much as the situation of the Protestant Church, (being
amongst the Roman Catholics Churches) has given occasion, not only of this,
but also of many former ryots, and likewise the Kings Majesty is by his Royal
oath obliged to prevent, and cut off all occasions, that may either disturb,
or break the peace of his subject in point of Religion; His Majesty
therefore, by virtue of this Decree, does altogether prohibit and abolish all
kind of exercise of the Protestant Religion, as well private as public, from
that place for ever; as also the names Zbor, or Congregation, their Schools
likewise and Alme-houses, changing the yards and buildings thereof into
dwelling houses or private ground, reserving the possession thereof, to such to
whom they do lawfully appertain; and this shall be performed within six
weeks after the conviction, under pain of infamy, nor shall the aforesaid
Protestants (under the aforesaid penalty) ever have or stir up exercise or
use of their Religion, School, or Hospital within the walls of the Regal
City of the Wild, strangers and Travelers excepted, that are confederate
with us; howsoever they shall have toleration and license (in respect of the
league aforesaid) and no otherwise, to have the exercises of their Religion in
their burial place, for the further ratification whereof this present Decree
is given under the Seal of the Great Dukedom of Lithuania, Dated in the
Parliament at VVarso, 26 Maii 1640.

This Decree of his Majesty was seconded by an oath which seven Nuns,
(suborned by the aforesaid Bishop and Jesuits) made at the Wild 21 July 1640.

We A. B. C. D, etc. Do swear by the holy Trinity, that by the knowledge or
approbation of the Protestant Ministers and guests, dwelling with them, arrows
were shot out of a Bow from the Protestant Church, in disgrace and contempt of
the Roman Catholic Church, but especially by one John Yeurski, who at that
time had a child christened, also by Balthazar Labenski, the eldest Minister of
that Congregation, and George Hartlibius Rector of their College who all
(dwelling within the walls of the aforesaid Church) do better know, and can
tell the names of the other delinquents, but that this our oath, which we take
against these men, as the principal authors of that fact is true and lawful,
so help us God and his holy Evangell. Now by the way, and before I go any
further, let me beseech the Reader to observe a wonderful expression of Gods
Justice, for within some few hours after this oath was taken, one of these
perjured Nuns was suddenly stricken with death, and fell down dead before she
could recover her own Cloister.

And that this oath which these Nuns took, was notoriously false, does
appear evidently by the contrary oath of the two above named Gentlemen, Paul
Piekarski, and Joseph Rakowski, who not long after, in the City of Novogard,
swore before the whole Tribunal or Bench, that they and none other were the
men that shot these Arrows, and that the Protestant Ministers were clear of
that fact; neither knew any thing thereof, nor were they shot from their
Church, but from the dwelling house of one Naborowski, nor did they any ways
aim at the Papist Church to disgrace that Religion, but in sport and
merriment, they shot at a bird which was upon the top of the Protestant Church,
although (contrary to their expectation) their Arrows were driven aside by the
wind: yet behold, good Reader, what a great fire a small sparkle kindles, what
a great mischief did ensue upon so small occasion; For that nothing might be
wanting to express the fury and malice of the Romish Prelate of the VVild and
Jesuits, against their innocent and harmless brethren, (Although they knew
their cause to be unjust, and the oath which the Nuns had taken to be false,
yet did they proceed to irritate and exasperate the Judges to execute the
Sentence, according to the former Decree, which in the month of April 1641.
followed in this manner, viz.

That for as much as the parties convicted, were not only guilty of the
aforesaid riot as turbule^t persons, and breakers of the peace of the Kingdom,
but also by their heretical preaching, disputations and conferences, did
seduce and draw away many from the Catholic faith, that therefore they
esteemed them guilty of death, yea more worthy of punishment, then the most
wicked malefactors.

It is therefore sentenced by this honorable Bench, that the delinquents shall
be taken to the market place of the City of Vilna, the City where the fact was
committed, and there be executed publicly as Traitors to his Majesty, and
troublers of the public peace (the manner of their death to be left to his
Majesty's pleasure) their lands and goods to be confiscated to the use of his
Majesty or Assigns.

Item, that the exercises of the Protestant Religion, shall altogether cease
and be suppressed within the walls of the Royal City of Vilna, and that the
Churches where these exercises were had, shall be converted altogether into
dwelling houses, or to some other civil use, and that upon no pretext or cause
whatsoever, there shall be preaching in that place, or any where else within
the said Gity, under the penalties formerly mentioned.

The Illustrious Duke Radzivil, perceiving the injustice, malice, and cruelty
of these Romanists, and condoling the estate of his distressed servants and
Ministers, a little before the publication of the Sentence, about midnight,
sent for them to his Palace, where after some hours private conference, he
wrote letters commendatory to the Duke of Prusia, and having furnished them
with money, and a guard of a hundred Tartarian horsemen, they were conveyed to
the Town of Keydan; from whence within 2 or 3 days after they departed to the
Tilz, from thence to the first great Castle and Town in Prusia, belonging to
the Duke of Prusia, from whence shortly after the death of the Illustrious old
Duke Radzivil, and the Duke of Brandeburgh, this Duke of Prusia his father, who
both dyed in one month, viz. in the month of August 1640; fearing further
persecution, they were removed to the Town of Memble, a great strength upon
the Sea side under the Duke of Prusia, nor long after unto Konisberg, and at
length unto Dantsk, where they remain unto this day, being banished from their
places, Countries and families, without maintenance, and separated from all
hope of future relief, unless the Lord work it by the charitable care and
affection of their reformed brethren, as appears more fully, by that most
unjust Decree of proscription, since published against them, the copy whereof
shall God willing be imparted to the Reader.

Neither can I omit in this Historical Relation, that barbarous cruelty of the
Jesuits Scollars in the Wild, in the day of the aforesaid tumult, against
that good man Master George Hartlib Rector of the Protestant College, a man
for learning, innocence and integrity, famous and excellent, yea, the Popish
Bishop of the VVilde, his great enemy, in a public meeting, did not only
acknowledge his worthiness, but also with great grief, (although it was too
late) condole his distress more then any of the others. Moreover one of these
Jesuits, traveling lately through Dantsk into Germany, did confess, that
he was innocent, and the reason why he was condemned and proscribed since, was
no otther, but that he disputed in public against the Popish Religion, and
seduced the Nobility and Gentry committed to his trust; in which regard they
esteemed him to be more worthy of punishment then any malefactor. This good
man, I say, walking peaceably from the Protestant College unto his own house,
was by these Catholic Christian Scholars, apprehended as a thief, beaten
with trees, buffered, and most dangerously wounded with stones in four or five
places of the head: not contented with this, as if it had been too gentle a
punishment, they threw him over a bridge into a deep river, from whence (having
once escape) they threw him in again, and at last perceiving that he had
escaped the second time, and that they could not thereby take away his life,
they follows him into a Bathstove or hothouse, where some pittifull-hearted
men and women, (although Papists) commiserating his condition, had sheltered
him, and assaulted his life, and those that took his part, with most inhumane
and diabolical fury, but he being hidden by a good old woman under a washing
tub, continued there until midnight, and at last, taking upon him the habit of
that woman, by Gods providence he escaped their outrage.

Moreover (as if these things were too little to express their insolences
against the Evangelick Protestants) they have proceeded further, and that by
the same aforesaid means, namely by cavils, tricks of Law and perjury, to
abolish and take away all the Protestant or Evangelick Churches, that were and
are within the Kings Regal Towns and chiefest Cities throughout the whole
Realm of Poland, such as were the Church of Krakovia, Posenania, Looblene,
Sendomerzee, Polocia, Bresta, all great and Regal Towns and chiefest Cities
of the Kingdom, besides that of the VVilde, formerly mentioned. So that now
there remain no more Protestants Churches throughout the whole Kingdom of
Poland, except two in the City of Dantsk, and the Duke of Brandeburg Church in
his Konisbergh, called the Sole, and so it may well indeed, for there is no
more in all the City of Konisbergh, and the Lutherians will suffer no more,
but the Church of Vitepsia, the Church of Minski, the Church of Novoguard and
the Church of Roseyn, all which also the Popish Jesuits and Priests are daily
plodding to take away. So that unles it please the Lord to use some means to
prevent their Jesuiticall enterprises, the whole number of Protestant Churches,
and consequently the whole public exercise of our reformed Religion,
throughout the whole Kingdom of Poland within few years, is like to be
extirpated and extinguished.

To conclude, of late and since the death of our Illustrious Patron Duke
Christophe Radzivil formerly mentioned, the pride and insolency of Jesuits and
Papists is grown to such a height, that they spare not to persecute and
assault our Ministers and Professors in the open streets, affronting them with
opprobrious speeches, and sometimes with blows, yea, often wounding them with
gunnes, shables, clubs or stones, as they lately did two of our Dukes Ministers
in the Wild, about the month of December last (one whereof, a learned and
Reverend Divine) Master Iacobus, they afflicted with three several wounds, one
in the arm, another in the left cheek, and a third on the back of the left
hand, whereof I my self was an eyewitness, so that they are now forced to
forsake their Ministerial habits, and go like Merchants or Soldiers, with
colored clothes and weapons.

The truth whereof, I my self have lately experienced, having been two
several times in great danger of my life, once, namely about the latter end of
February last, traveling peaceably in my sled, from Keydan the place of my
residence, unto Rogola, which is four Polish miles distant, I was set upon in
the highway by a Polish Boyarne or Gentleman, who asked me what Bishop I
served under, but because I could not answer him in his own language so well
as he expected, or perhaps, by my habit, surmised me to be one of Duke
Radzivils Ministers, stroke at me most desperately with his sh^ble or Polish
sword three or four several times, wounded me in the head, and had I not
warded two or three of his blows, with a thick Cane, which I then had in mine
hand, and which he did almost cut through, he had certainly bereft me of my
life.

Not long after, being in the Town of Kowan six Polish miles from Keydan,
walking in the streets about nine of the clock in the morning, going to buy
some necessaries, because I saluted not the Crucifix, which was then carried by
me in procession, and encountered me unawares; the Jesuit Scholars accompanied
with two Capushine Friars fell upon me, and assaulted me so fiercely, first
with words, and then with blows and stones, that I was forced to make more
then ordinary haste to my lodging.

Thus have I discharged my duty to my Illustrious Patron, discovered unto you
the afflicted estate of our reformed Churches under the Crown of Poland, and
exposed to the world, the treacherous practices, malicious tyranny,
unreconciliable hatred, unlimited and unsatiable ambition of the Romish Prelates
and their associates within the aforesaid Kingdom.

And yet I would not hereby absolutely and totally condemn the Romish Church
(as it is a Church, and a part or member, although a diseased and rotten one)
of the true Catholic Church of Christ, and as it believes, approves and
maintains with Christ's Apostles and us, many essential and Orthodoxe points
of truth, both in doctrine and discipline, agreeable to the word of God and the
analogy of faith. Nor would I discourage too much the modest and better sort of
Papists, who living in simple ignorance, make innocence and charity, the
touchstone of their Religion. For I am very confident, that he that cannot try
the truth of his Religion by these two, let him be Protestant or Papist, or of
whatsoever other Religion he will, all that he believes, knows or professes
of that Religion cannot profit him to salvation but is as founding brass, or a
tinckling Cymball, because the faith or knowledge which he professes or
pretends to have, is merely notionall and speculative, residing only in the
brain, and showing it self only by words or outward posture, but not
inwardly affecting or heating the heart, with a desire to do good, or frame
our actions according to our profession. For that Religion that must save us,
must be a practical Religion, that faith that must justify us before God,
must be an effectual operative faith, which works by love, and that
knowledge of God and of his Son Christ, that knowledge, I say, of Religion,
and Divine worship, which is true and able to do us good, and bring us to life
eternal, must be such a knowledge, says Pet. Mart. Quia ita mutamur, ut quae
scimus, opere conemur exprimere, P. M. inloe. com, otherwise, the better our
Religion is, and the more that we know of it, or are leaned in it, it will be
the worse for us, for Potentes potenter torquebuntur, that swimming learning or
knowledge which we have, will but aggravate our condemnation, for according to
our talent of knowledge, does God expect from us a correspondent reckoning of
obedience, whereas he does not so to such unto whom he has not showed himself
so bountiful a Creditor.

But first, I would hereby admonish and give notice unto all the simpler and
more ignorant sort of Papists, who either have been lately seduced by these
Romish impostures, or have not as yet taken deep footing, and are but newly
entered into that Antichristian Laborynth, that they would in time, and before
they pass too far, retire and withdraw themselves, least in the end, they
provoke the Lord to complain of them as he did of those in the fourth Psalm,
O ye sons of men, how long will you follow after vanities and seek after
leasings?

Secondly, I would hereby bewail and condemn Crassam illam, and supinam
Pontificiorum ignorantiam, that most gross, or rather wilful and obstinate
ignorance of the Roman Prelates and Churchmen, who I am persuaded in my
conscience, believe in their hearts, know with their understanding, discern by
their judgment, although they will not confess with their mouths, most, if
not all of these, humane inventions, unnecessary traditions, idolatrous
superstitions, false, cruel, treacherous and ungodly practices, doctrines,
devices and machinations, wherein they differ from us, and from that truly
ancient, Catholic and Apostolic doctrine, professed and believed in the
purer times of the Church, many hundred years before ever there was the least
mention of the Popes holiness, and by Gods grace, is continued, believed, and
maintained by us in this Angel-like Monarchy, I say, it is not possible, but
that they must needs know these things which they teach, write, profess, and
maintain, for the grounds of their Religion, and maintaining, improving, and
advancing of their Hierarchy to be unjust, false, unchristian and heretical,
and blasphemous: did they not (by reason of that Regnum ignorantiae and
erroris) that is, of that kingdom of ignorance that is amongst them, shut up
the gates of truth, that is, of holy Scriptures, (which is the rule and ground
of truth) from themselves and their people. Haeretici Sacerdotes claudunt
Ianuam veritatis, the heretical Priests shut the gates of truth, because they
know, that if the truth were known, their Religion should be forsaken, and
they cast down and debased from their Pontifical dignity, into the mean
condition of ordinary people, yea, I should rather have said, did not the
Prince of this world, which rules in the hearts of the children of
disobedience shut their eyes that they should not see, stop their ears, that
they cannot hear, harden their hearts, that they should not understand nor
discern the ways of truth wherein they should walk, and therefore it is no
marvel, that God has given them over, to a reprobate sense, to be like other
Sectaries and heretics, obstinate in their errors, to believe strong delusions,
and to hold the truth in unrighteousness.

Thirdly, I would hereby encourage my Brethren and Countrymen, whether in this
Kingdom or elsewhere, to stand firm and constant in the truth of their
profession, and not to be moved and-shaken with every wind of doctrine; nor by
their Sects, Schisms, separations, private and confused opinions or
Assemblies, rend the unseamed Coat of their Redeemer, or thereby tear that
part of his mystical body, which he does graciously please to continue in
this Kingdom, but to agree rather in one consent to keep the unity of the
Spirit, in the bond of peace to follow after peace with all men, and holiness,
yea to forbear one another in love, and to follow after the truth in love,
with peaceable and loving affections, not with hot and furious distempers, as
some of us seem to do, who think they cannot be religious enough, unless
they be enemies to peace, and that there can be no better pattern of wholesome
doctrine, to hold fast, keep, and frame their faith by, then that which is of
their own weaving. I tell you (good Brethren) this pattern of doctrine, which
is maintained, and I hope shall be maintained in these Kingdoms, is good
enough, yea so good, that I know none in the world better (and I am sure I have
read, heard, known and seen as much of the world, almost, as any other of my
Coat and calling within this Island) yea, I say, there is none so good, none so
near that pattern which Paul commended to Timothy, therefore keep it fast,
which you cannot do unless you love the truth and peace. Say not one of you,
I am of Paul, another I am of Apollos, a third, I am of Cephas, a fourth, I am
of Christ: Let me entreat you (for Christ his sake) not to deceive your selves,
for Christ neither will not can be divided, nor will he ever send his Spirit
into you, to illuminate or inspire you with the truth, if he see you inclined
or addicted to schism or faction, for in malevolam animam non introibit
sapientia, Heavenly wisdom and truth, will not enter into souls, that
through fraction; contention, schism, or separation, are divided and
dissipated, Vna est Columba mea, says Christ of his Spouse the Church, My Dove
is one, and as his Church is one, so is his Spirit, which once descended upon
him in the likeness of a Dove, to teach all posterities, that he will never
send his graces, but into dove-like souls, that is, into men and women, that
are of a dove-like, innocent, humble and loving heart. Certainly that
knowledge which they have or profess of Gods worship (that are otherwise)
cannot be true and good, it cannot I say, be true, unless it make them one
with their brethren, as Christ is one with the Father, John 17. 20.

Be not therefore divided, give not the Papists occasion to say, (as I have
heard some of them lately say to my self) The Protestants have so many Sects
amongst them, that they know not what to embrace, nay said one, there are in
this City (for the present) above ninety several Religions, each one differing
from another, nay each one despising, excommunicating and separating themselves
from other. O let not this be heard in Gath, nor published in the streets of
Askalon: For shame, for shame, give not this occasion to the adversary, forsake
not Christ's Spouse for her black spots, nor his true Reformed Church in this
Land for her imperfections: what? would you have a Church Militant, to be
Triumphant? or do you dream of, or seek for a Church in this life that has
no blemish? such men as these had best buy wings to themselves and flee beyond
the Moon to the garden of Hesperide^, wherein (some say) was Paradise, and
which (if we will believe Poets) is altogether free from storms and tempests,
sure I am beneath the Moon, there is no man, no Religion, no Church free from
blemishes, nor possibly can be. Seeing that of the Apostle is as true of all
the Church, as of one of the Church, here we see darkely through a glass, we
know but in part, but then we shall know as we are known; 1 Cor. 13. 12. Let
us not say, in matters of Religion, draw backwardly or contrariwayes like
Sampsons Foxes, that were bound together tail to tail, for then can follow
nothing but jars, contention, combustion and tumultuous confusion, but let us
be rather like the Cherubins, having our faces looking one toward another,
that is, let us all with one consent and unity of mind, especially in matters
of faith and Religion, join together in love, opinion, judgment, and
affection, to embrace, believe, and practice such a form of doctrine,
discipline and government, as has been ever since Christ, or at the least, in
the purer times after Christ received and followed in the Christian Church, and
as I hope (through Gods goodness and providence, shall shortly be established
in this Kingdom, by the religious care and wisdom of our King and
Parliament; which I am persuaded will be no other then such as shall be most
pleasing unto God, justifiable and harmless to the people, suitable to the
Scriptures, and most approveable and comfortable to men's consciences. Such, I
say, as shall have for their ground and warrant, not men's inventions, humane
policy and traditions, but absolutely and immediately Gods inspired Scriptures,
which are sufficient, in all things to instruct, reprove, correct in
righteousness, and to make the man of God perfect, furnished thoroughly to
every good work; in a word, such as shall most conduce for the advancement of
Gods glory, and depressing the pride and ambition of men's hearts, such as are
most contrary to the corruption of man's life and manners, such as are most
spiritual and suitable to the nature of God, who is a Spirit, and will be
worshipped in spirit and truth: finally such as can afford most comfort and
ease, unto troubled and perplexed consciences; if, I say, such doctrines,
discipline, and manner of Government be admitted and established in our Church,
(as I make no doubt they shall) and also if all the people from Dan to
Beersheba, both in City and Country, from all places, and corners of the Land,
join together, as is aforesaid, without contention, preposterous zeal,
schism, and separation; to approve, believe, receive and practice the same,
then shall our Church, like Aarons rod, flourish to all possible perfection,
even to the astonishment and admiration of all her enemies, being as Mount Sion
which cannot be removed, but remains for ever: as the mountains about
Jerusalem, so shall the Lord be about his people from henceforth, and for ever,
Psa. 150.

Fourthly and lastly, let these and such like treacherous practices of Jesuits
and Papists abovementioned, be a foelix quem faciunt, or warning-peale unto all
the Orthodoxe and Reformed Churches in the world, to make them (not only hate
and abhor all Popish and Antichristian devices, but also abandon (if they
wish their own welfare) and (as much as is possible) exterminate and extirpate
out of their Lands and Kingdoms, all pragmaticall and busy he^ded Romanists,
but especially these of the Jesuited sort, which are more rigidly devoted and
addicted to the Roman Sea. Let this History, I say, be as wormwood to the dug,
to make the Sons of our Mother, the children of this Church, forsake the paps
of that Antichristian whore, and not to admit upon any terms, much less to
approve, or maintain the least semblance of a Papisticall Hierarchy, least
(if they do) their ghostly fathers, Prelates and Fraternities show them a
trick of Machiavelisme, and how doggetly they can insult and domineere over
their simple and Reformed Brethren, whersoever they take footing, as they have
lately done these two years past in the Kingdom of Poland, over that famous
Illustrious and Orthodoxe Prince Duke Christopher Radzivil, the father, and his
distressed Ministers, and are like to do still over his most excellent and
Illustrious son, Prince Ianussius, unless the Lord provide some remedy to
the contrary.

But especially, let them take notice of this unto whom both God and his
Anointed our Sovereign, has freely and graciously granted all sort of power,
right, Law, and prerogative to execute, establish and reform matters tending
to the preservation and welfare of this Kingdom, for whom (as true and
natural sons of this Sion) let us be careful in our best devotion and
prayers to solicit and implore the favorable assistance, and gracious
presence of the Almighty, who has the hearts of Kings and great men in his
hands, turning them (like the rivers of water) which way he lists; That he
may be pleased so to affect and dispose the hearts of the Peers and Princes,
Magistrates of this Land, that they may speedily bethink themselves of some
opportune way and means, whereby all fractions, and factions, schisms,
separations, sidings, and backslidings, contentions, combustions, confusions,
prevarications, finally all Antichristian, polypragmaticall, tyrannical, and
treacherous heresies, schisms, practices, professions, and enterprises may be
quite, or at least as much as is possible, abolished and removed from the body
and bounds of this Monarchy, and that all his Majesty's subjects here and
elsewhere, may from henceforth concur and consent, in unity of mind, opinion,
judgment, conscience, and affection, to embrace, profess, maintain, retain,
believe and Practice such a platform and pattern of wholesome doctrine and
Religion, as is most consonant and agreeable to Gods revealed will, loving the
truth and peace, and following after the truth in love; in a word, if it be
possible, and as much as in them lies, following peace with all men and
holiness, that there may be amongst them all, but one body and one spirit,
even as they are called in one hope of their vocation, one Lord, one faith, one
Baptism, one God and Father of them all, in them all, and through them all,
Amen. Ephesians. 4.
