The Genius of True Enslish-men,
Tacitus de vit. Jul. Agr.cap. 13. Britanni delectum ac Tributa and Injuncta
Imperij Munera impigri obeunt, si Injuriae absint, has aegri tolerant; Jam
domiti ut pareant nondum ut Serviant. The Britains are a sort of People that
pay very freely all manner of Tributes and Taxes to the Empire Loyally Imposed,
but cannot endure Injuries; and had rather Perish than live as Slaves.
THe Freeborn English Generous and Wise,
Hate Chains, but do not Government despise.
Rights of the CROWN, Tributes and Taxes they,
(When Lawfully demanded) freely pay:
Force they abhor, and Wrongs they scorn to bear,
More guided by their Judgment than their Fear,
Justice with them is never called Severe.
Here Power by Tyranny was never got,
Laws may (perhaps) Enslave, but FORCE cannot.
Rash Councels here have still the worst Effect,
The furest way to Reign, is to Protect.
Kings are least safe in their Unbounded Will,
Joined with the wretched Power of doing ill;
Forsaken most when they are most Absolute,
LAWS guard the MAN, and only bind the Brute.
To Force that Guard with the worst so to join,
Can never be a Prudent KING'S Design,
What KING would change to be a Caitiline?
Break his own Laws, shake an unquestioned Throne,
Conspire with Vassals to Usurp his own.
It Is rather some base Favorites Vile Pretense,
To Tyrannize at the wronged KING'S Expense.
Let France grow Proud beneath the Tyrants Lust,
Whilst the Rackt People crawl and lick the Dust.
The Mighty Genius of this Isle disdains
Ambition, Slavery, and Golden Chains:
ENGLAND to Servile Yokes did never bow,
What Conqu'rors never presumed who dare do now?
ROMAN nor NORMAN never could pretend
To have Enslaved, but made this Isle their Friend.
