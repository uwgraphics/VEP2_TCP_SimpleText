A LETTER Sent from a Gentleman in OXFORD, To His Friend in LONDON;

Concerning the Justice of the KING's Cause, and the unequal proceedings of
those against Him, who are now found to be the Enemies of our PEACE and
HAPPINESS.

OR A SHORT CHARACTER Of the actions of our New State-Reformers; in which the
seduced people may see to whom to impute the beginning of these miserable
distractions, and the continuance thereof.

Printed in the Year, 1646.

SIR,
I Have received your Letter, and with as much care as you desired, I have
perused it; and for your advice I return my thanks to your error, not your
love: believing from that Spring all your lines have been derived, and that
like People infected with the Plague, your desires have still been to corrupt
others; mistake me not neither: I blame not your Endeavors, in gaining all you
can to your Party, since it is multitude, not the justice of your cause that
must nurse up that Birth, your Deceit has begot upon the Fears and Jealousies
of the People, and that those Routs (the pillars of your new Model) might the
better be fashioned, into what forms were most convenient for your designs,
it was extremely necessary, you should take from them all the rules and squares
both of Civil and Ecclesiastical Government; and that you have most fully and
amply done, by a new way of pulling down the old Religion, and setting up of
many, nay, any that might serve either your ambition or your gain: and like
Jeroboam in your new Government, when it could not be safe for you to erect
another, you adulterate the old; Certainly, if you seriously reflect, if you
review this act of corrupting Religion, with a recollected judgment, you
cannot but find, that you have clean mistaken the way you pretend* though not
that which you intend; for whoever yet would so much Cashiere his reason in
things of the smallest moment, as to leave a certain positive good, for an
uncertain accidental one? take heed; the same mistake cost the seduced
Prophet his life: and if you take the Maxim of the Law for Vmpire, that the
same cases are to be judged by the same reasons, you have cause to fear, it
may in time prove your own.

But admit this Form, this new Directory for the Church were as pure as you
would have the People believe it, or your selves desire it, and that ours were
as great an abomination, as the forsaken Tribes Idolatry was to Israel; yet
give me leave to tell you, and from Scripture, (from whence you say you borrow
all your directions) that from thence you are so far from drawing any
argument, that can give you authority to plant your Religion by the Sword, that
you can hardly find any will allow the defense of it by Arms: Surely, when I
consider these things, you must give me leave to believe, you are much a Kin
to those that followed our Savior for the loafes, and the relieving their
necessities, rather then the love of his Gospel, and like Demetrius's Crew,
serve the Goddess of your own setting up, because it brings much gain, much
wealth to your Cofers.

And now that in silence I pass over the Extirpation of Bishops, both root and
branch, wonder not at all; it is but Consonant, that to Silver Deities, there
be Leaden Priests; and therefore, you did well to forbid the standing by of
such Gamesters, as would quickly see more then the Players: And because the
fall of the Church is commonly a Preface to the ruins of the State, take this
small gloss upon the defections, you have caused in that too* and in this I
meet first with the Power, by which you have erected all this Pile of
desolation; and here I find Jacob in his Elder Brothers Clothes, for from the
King first that power issued, and by his Writs you were called, and now
surrepticiously like Prometheus you have stolen Fire from Heaven to animate the
fond Conceptions of your own depraved wills, and as if in this act you meant
to give earnest for all the evils you meant to practice you have eaten through
the bowels of your own Mother, devoured the Womb that first disclosed you:
Certainly, when the King first Assembled you thither, as He intended not to
trench on your Privileges, so He never meant, never believed so ill on you,
that you had the least thought of wresting His Power from Him, (wresting, so I
term it) for I know of no act by which He either lent or gave it away to you;
and therefore you must excuse me, if with you I consent not to believe your
Power legitimate.

But admit His Majesty for the good of the Kingdom entrusted His Power with
you; truly I think it was far from Him to imagine, you would have given it to
the Scot, and make the representative Body of the Kingdom, a Committee, to
work journey-worke for them, who if things succeed according to their
expectation, will be so much your friends, as to allow you the same favor
Polyphemus did Ulysses, and too late then you will begin to find with the
Countryman, you warmed the Snake, that shall hiss and sting you, and your
Generation from your so long enjoyed Possessions; which will be some allay to
my misery, when I am undone by you to see you perish by your selves and them,
Nec lex est justior ulla, etc.

But why extends not this Communion of Power to the Irish, as well as Scot;
who, if we confide in Proverbs, are as faithful as they? truly I Will answer for
them, they were Starre-Crost, and mistaking the Scene, entered in the Prologue.
For had they stayed but two minutes longer, they might have Rebelled by
President and confirmed it by Authority; but I pass over this with the
observation of the Poets. In quo quis peccat in eo punitur: you have stolen the
Kings Power from Him, and fooled both your own and His to the Scot; which
every English man will find a greater breach of the Privileges of the
Parliament of England, in joining your selves to them, and refusing to receive
any thing from the King, in which they are not made your Partners, then that
which you allege in the King for a breach in naming the Common Council with
you for a Security for His Person.

But my hopes at last are, that if this Power have any thing of the Ingredients
of Pythagoras's soul in it, it will transmigrate into the first owner; And so
leaving the right of Power, I come to survey the use of it; and here at the
first fight I perceive the Giants Club too big for your hands; you can weild it
to nothing but destruction.

For I remember at His departure from London, He left a City more thronged with
Wealth, then People, a Kingdom more flourishing with good Laws then any, but
at His return, I believe He would be glad to find His talent wrapped up in a
napkin: for in stead of finding His Wealth increased, it is diminished, His
People slain, and the Sword of justice worn in a private sheath* The Laws
which like Land-markes, kept the Mariner, from a destroying Rock, abrogated,
in a word you have disanul'd them all, and by the narrowest search I can make,
I cannot find any that you have either made or kept, and in liew of these, you
present us with an Ordinance, a thing that like Jonas Gourd, is the off spring
of a night, and savours so much of an Arbitrary Power, that if it be not a
prerogative beyond any the King ever had, I know not what is; for I am sure the
Kings Power before these times, without a due conviction of Law, could take no
man's Estate from him, and by the right of Inheritance, we had the same title
to our Lands, that He had to His Crown; but now you have not only taken ours,
but His too; you have disinherited us, disinthroned Him. Yet in this Convulsion
of the State, in this Confused shufling of all together, our Liberties have
escaped at the easyest rates; yet in them our plenty has made us poor; and in
being made more free we are made more Slaves: for what is not lawful now,
either to be done or said? Witness, your own actions, and the License of so
many Scandalous Seditious Pamphlets, that daily infect the air, and like the
plagues of Egypt are familiar even with the Kings Chambers; Nay, that you
might be sure to make your little finger heavier then the Kings Loins, you
have laid more Taxes on the people in your five years usurpation, then he had
done in 17. you have consumed in this War more monyes, which you have forced
from the Subject, then have been (if my intelligence fail not) disbursed
almost by all the Kings of England since the Conquest, and for the exaction of
the twentieth, and the fifth part of every man's Estate, I believe you will tire
History to find the parallel, in the Raigns of the most cruel Tyrants; and
as if it were too light a Conquest to overthrow our Bodies, our Estates, you
endanger our Souls, and under the names of Covenants, you impose such Oaths,
as the King could (I am sure did) never think on, and whatsoever you falsely
have imputed to the King, to make Him appear odious to His people, you have
your selves really acted, and with a higher hand, then ever the Extasis of His
wishes could transport Him to imagine; and because your Vices have been
successful, you believe them Virtues; and that you may still deceive your
selves, as well as others, you turn the great end of the perspective upon all
your actions, and perpetually tell the world in all your Messages, of your
desires of Peace.

Truly when I see those, I need not wish Democritus from his ashes, every man
that reads them is transformed into them; indeed I cannot veiw them without a
smile, especially when (before there was a Pistol charged for this War) I
look upon all His Majesty's Gracious Messages (I may rather call them
Entreaties for Peace) sent from Nottingham, from York, these when it was
begun, from Oxford and other places; those often and present suings for Peace
still denied; you must pardon me, if I refuse to be of your opinion, and think
you descended from those that Cry, Peace, Peace, when their preparations are
warlike.

Concerning your last Letters, His Majesty has made so full an Answer, that I
shall say nothing, but certainly if you had not thought your selves guilty of
all the Blood that has been shed in these Distractions, and had not feared,
that the unseduced people would have been of your opinion, you had not desired
the King to take it on Him, and have raised a Spirit, which perhaps will not so
easily be allayed.

But of all the Riddles which your Sophistry has obtruded to us, the
pleasantest is to think you should fight all this while, for that which when
you have, you dare not accept; for your pretenses in the raising of your Armies
have been, to fetch the King from His Evil Councillors, and yet when He
offers to come, you refuse Him. Pray, though you force us from the goods of our
Bodies, yet deprive us not of the Faculties of our Souls, though you take our
Lands, leave us our understandings, though you make us Slaves, pray make us not
Fools.

In a word to sum up all, if this be your Religion, it is like the poor
Indians that worship the Devil, because he should not hurt them, if this be
your Obedience and Obeisance to your King, I can parallel it to none but Judas
his, if this be your fighting to preserve Him, it is like the man that killed
himself out of a fear to dye; if this be your vigilant wisdom to make Him a
glorious Prince, it is allied to Solomon's, in nothing but being Apocripha; if
this be your mending the stich-fallen Laws, it is like those that repaired
Theseus's ship so long, 'till the first Fabric was destroyed; if this be the
enlarging our Liberties, it is like the man that to increase his Fishpond, let
the Sea into it: if these be your desires for Peace, it is like him that prayed
to Jupiter for that he would not have; if this be your Care for the
Commonwealth, it is like Neros, that wished, Rome but one head, the easier to
destroy it; if these be your affections to your bleeding Country, you are like
the hunted Ape, that exposes the beloved Whelpe to relieve that death was due
to her.

To conclude, for I meant not to send you either a Disputation, or a Volume
mistaken for a Letter; my belief is, The Sins of the Nation have deserved a
Judgment, and your Rebellion has paid it; but my hopes are, when Gods
Judgments are past, he will burn the Rods; In the mean time I can compare
our Condition with none so fitly as Aesops frogs; we must cry and petition for
a Parlialiament, and Jupiter has sent us one, as devouring as their Stork.

When I consider all these things together, the Charitablest opinion I can have
of you, is to think that opportunity has made you worse then you intended,
and that partly like young Philosophers in approving one error, you have been
led into a thousand; and now you must justify and support one ill act by
another; if this be the Cure, which at first you promised this Distempered
State, it is worse then the Malady; and for my part I shall desire my Disease
again; I am sure there is less pain, less trouble in it; and for your
admonition, I shall refer you to a Heathen

Dominare tumidus, spiritus altos gere;
Sequitur Superbos ultor a tergo Deus.
Go on proud men, till you have made the Kingdom a deluge of Blood; rule till
you have undone both your selves, and us; but remember the God that has Leaden
Feet, has Iron Hands; and commonly he supplies the slownesse of the one with
the severity of the other, and always follows those he goes not with, pursues
those with his judgments, he does not lead with his mercies.

FAREWELL.
