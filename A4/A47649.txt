The Copy of a Letter sent from General Leishley to the Lord General the
Earl of Holland, and read in the House of Commons, the 7th. of July, 1641.
My Lord,
I Give your Lordship hearty thanks that you have been pleased to acquaint me
with your arrival at York, I had some notice given me before by our
Commissioners of his Majesty's Commands, and the desire of the Parliament, for
that happy and peaceable service your Lordship is now about. I am glad that I
am at Darrington by accident, in that place where I may give the more speed and
encouragement, which your Lordship desires and expects from me. This shall be
done with all possible diligence: For as at the first, the reason of sending
any Troops toward the Tees, was for enlargement of their Quarter, and the
great ease of the rest of the Bishopric; so now, the retyring shall be to take
away al jealousy from the Army of our aboade in this part of the County: For
although the streightning of our Quarter will be both prejudicial to the
Country and us, yet God forbid it should be made a pretext to make the least
stay to the good work your Lordship has in hand; and the further we remove
from other in this end, we are the nearer to be joined in all hearty affection
for the service of the King: Wherefore so sure grounds of Hope are now laid,
that all his Majesty's Three Kingdoms Enemies will have as much cause to fear
the ill effects of our Union, as they had matter of rejoyceing at the too long
lasting discord between us: And it may be so in all ages to come; which is the
hearty wish and Prayer of

Your Lordships most humble Servant, H. LEISHLEY.
Dorrington the 2 of July, 1641.
