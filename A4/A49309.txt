Loves Victory Obtanied: OR,
A pleasant sportful joyful meeting, between a young man and his sweeting,
At first they met, and then they kissed, and afterward did what they list:
'Twas all within a Garden green, where pretty sport was to be seen,
Then listen to my Song a while, i am sure here is that will make you smile.
To the Tune of, True blew: Or, Ha ha ha.


WAlking in a pleasant Garden,
in the prime time of the Spring,
There I heard a proper maiden,
to her sweetheart sweetly sing;
He fell closely to his wooing,
and by no means would he said nay;
She seemed loath to yield unto him,
and to him these words did say:
With a ha ha ha you will undo me,
O so wild and rude you are,
Yet kind heart I needs must love thee,
because thou came with me so far.
Fair maid, quoth he, let me be doing,
for with thee I mean to try,
Thou shall have a world of pleasure,
of brave sport as well as I:
I will hug thee, I will kiss thee,
I will love thee till I dye:
But as he made suit unto her,
she to him made this reply;
With a ha, etc.
Her shoes were made of Spanish Leather,
her stockings were of finest silk;
Fitting for the Summers weather,
and her skin as white as milk:
Her face was of a fair complexion,
her eyes like glistering Stars did shine,
Cupid moved the Lads ^ff^ction,
with his Lover to combine:
She cried out, etc.
Prithee sweetheart do not dally,
nor delay no time with me,
Stand not fooling shilly, shally,
but be courteous and agree:
If I may obtain thy favor,
for to take the fruits of love,
I will do my best endeavor,
and will kind unto thee prove.
Still she cried, etc.
Why then quoth he farewell for ever,
If thou will not yield unto me,
Since I have done my endeavor,
now I take my leave of thee.
Never more will I come near thee,
but thy company will refrain,
Because I see thou do but jeer me,
I Will not trouble thee again.
With a ha ha ha you will undo me,
O so wild and rude you are,
Yet I cannot choose but, etc.


When she heard he would be joging
and so leave her there alone
Stay a while said she sweet Robin
be not thou so quickly gone.
Thou shall bade what thou b^^^^est
now of pleasure take thy fill,
Try me as thy mind requirest
and perform thy chiefest skill.
Now sweetheart thou art welcome to me,
act thy part and do not spare,
For I know to harm thou wilt do me,
then what need have I to fear.
Then he pulled out his golden Rapier,
being in a merry bain,
She began to mount and caper
and bid him to the sport again:
He set his foot against a well,
and she be back against a tree,
He looked East, and she looked West
to see what company was neigh,
Sweetheart, etc.
Jupiter began to Thunder,
Venus blushed the same to see,
Juno she did greatly wonder
that such pretty sport should be.
But when their joyful Iig was ended,
and their merry ^^sk was done;
She his sk^ll so much commended
wishing it were fresh begun;
Saying sweetheart you are welcome to me
please thy fancy do not spare, etc.
Then upon her back he blowed her,
down upon a bank of flowers;
When that he had overthrow'd her
then she cried the game is ours:
More then twenty times he kissed her,
yet she said she felt no pain.
Sometimes he hit, sometimes he mi^^
yet she bid him come again,
Saying sweetheart you are welcome to me
please thy fancy do not spare, etc.
All you fair Maids that hears my Sonnet
I would have you think on this,
And consider well upon it
that you do nothing a miss:
Kissing, playing, talking-courting,
these are things young men will do,
Maidens may with them be sporting
yet be fair and honest too.
She said no more sir you will undo me,
O so wild and rude you are:
Yet she said sweetheart I love thee
because you come with me so far.
FINIS.
