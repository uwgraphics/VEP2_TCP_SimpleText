The Lamenting Ladies last farewell to the WORLD.
Who being in a strange Exile bewales her own misery, complains upon Fortune
and Destiny, describes the manner of her breeding, deplores the loss of her
parents wishing peace and happiness to England, which was her native Country,
and withal resolved for death, cheerfully commends her soul to heaven, and
her body to the earth, and quietly departed this life: Anno 1650.

To an excelent new Tune, O hone, O hone.


MOarnful Melpomeny
assist my quill,
That I may pensibly,
now make my will,
Guide thou my hand, so writs
And ser ces to indite,
A Ladies last good night,
O pittty me.
I that was nobly born.
hither am sent:
Like to a wretch forlorn,
here to lament;
In this most strange ersle
Here to remain a while:
Till heaven be pleased to smile:
and send for me.
My friends cannot come nigh
me in this place:
Nor bear me company
such is my case,
Poor I am left alone,
But few regard my moan:
All my delights are gone
heaven succor me,
Each day with cares and fears,
I am perplexed,
My drink is brinish tears
with sorrow mixed.
When others soundly sleep,
I sadly sob and weep:
Oppressed with dangers deep
Lord comfort me.
When England flourished,
my Parents deer
Tenderly nourished
me many a year,
I was advanced on high,
In place of dignity,
In olden bravery
they decked me.


My garments decked, with pearl
richly approved,
Never was English girls
better belov'd',
Old and young, great and small
VVaited upon my call,
I had the love of all,
that did know me.
But from my former state
I am called back,
Through destiny and fate,
all goes to wrack,
Fortune did lately frown,
And caught me by the Crown,
So pulled me headlong down,
oh woe is me.
My dear friends are decayed,
which loved me best,
Never was harmless maid,
so much distressed:
My Father he is dead.
My Mother banished,
All sores are from me fled,
Heaven comfort, me.
How well are they at ease
and sweetly blessed,
That may go when they please
and where they list
To see their Parents kind,
As nature does them bind,
Such joys I cannot find,
Ah woe is me.
All earthly helps are gone,
I will and must
Only in God alone
Put my whole trust.
O blessed Trinity,
One God and persons three,
Release my misery,
and comfort me.
No creature on the earth,
can ease my grief,
Until such time as death
yield me relief,
A coffin and a grave,
Is that which I would have,
Sweet Chirst my soul receive
and sucour me.
My Enemies that be,
both great and small,
Good Lord I pray to thee
forgive them all.
May England flourish brave,
When I am laid in grave
So thus I take my leave
Christ calls for me.
I have in heaven above
a place prepared
Never shall I depart
from thence afterward
Go tole my passing bell,
Whilst Angels ring my knell,
So vain world now farewell
Christ sends for me.
When she these words had spoke,
with cheerful heart,
The noble minded maid
then did depart
No doubt her souls at rest
with them whom God has blessed
The last words she expressed.
was, Christ calls for me
