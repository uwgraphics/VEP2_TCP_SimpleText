Four of the choicest New Songs, as they are sung at Court;
Written by a person of Quality, named E. G.
A Song.
YOung John the Gardner having lately got
A very rich Garden plot,
Bragging to Jone, quoth he, so rich a ground
For millions cannot in the World be found,
For it is a good ground:
That Is a damned lie, quoth Jone,
For I can tell a place that does your Garden far excel,
In the midst there stands a Well,
Where Is that, says John, between my Legs, says
For there is a Plant well set, which flourished all the year,
And never will decay, thou needst not to fear;
For if it drops I such an art have got,
To raise it, that my fertile Garden-plot
Will then restore it self as at first,
In better ground no plant was ever thrust.
Say so, says John, then open thy gay green Gate,
I have a choice plant to set without fate.
Prithee John be quiet, and let my Garden go free,
For I can have better Plants than any thou can give me.
Nay, nay, my Jone, you must not now dispute,
Let me but graft, and you shall have the fruit.
Another Excellent New Song.
THou art fair and cruel too,
I am a Maid what shall I do;
To purchase my desire,
Sometimes thine eyes do me invite,
But when I venture kill me quite,
Yet' still in thee's the fire,
Often have I thought my Love to quell,
And try its furies to repel,
Since I no hope can find,
But when I think of having thee,
My heart as much does toture me,
As 'twould rejoice, if kind.
Thus have I loved, though hardly used,
And when I proffer am refused.
And I Will suffer more, by coy, be cruel, come do thy worst
Though for thy sake I am accursed,
Yet ne'retheless i will love thee more,
Whom I must and will adore.
A New Love Song.
THe night her blackest Sables wore,
All gloomy were the Skies,
And glittering Stars there were more
Than those in Celia's Eyes,
When at her Fathers Gate I Knocked,
Where I had often been,
And shrouded only in her Smock,
The fair one let me in.
Fast locked within my close embrace
She trembling lay,
Ashamed her swelling Breast,
And gave me way;
She Is fair and pretty I have said,
My eager passion I obeyed,
Resolved the Fort to win,
And her fond heart was soon betrayed
To yield and let me in.
None but the envying Gods Conquest,
Or Lovers blessed,
As I to what degrees of happiness,
We raised our equal joy,
The mistress of love ran over,
We did anew begin,
And she blessed that day
That e're she let me in.
But long the feasted thefts of Love
We could not thus conceal,
The lovely maid does pregnant prove,
Which must our joys reveal,
She wept and sighed,
Yet still if 'twere to do again,
She would not curse the fatal hour
That e're she let me in.
But who could see her charming tears,
Her sorrows without art,
Her long-wish'd fate with fears,
And not resign his heart;
We married and concealed the Crime,
So all was well again,
And now she thanks the blessed hour,
That e're she let me in.
Another New Love Song.
SEE what a Conquest love has made,
Beneath the Myrtles amorous shade,
The charming fair Corinna lies,
All melting in desire,
Quenching in tears those flaming Eyes,
That set the world on fire,
With fervent hot desire.
What cannot Tears and Beauty do,
The youth by chance stood by and knew,
For whom those Crystal eyes did flow,
And though he never before
To her Eyes brightest rage did bow,
VVeeps too, and does adore.
So when the Heavens do shine clear,
Gilded with gaudy light appear,
Each craggy Rock, and every stone,
Their native rigor keep,
But when in Rain the Clouds fall down,
The hardest Marbles weep.
