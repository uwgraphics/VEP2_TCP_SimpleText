Fair CYNTHIA's Sorrowful Sighs. BEING Her steadfast Resolution to find out her
Beloved CORYDON.
To a Pleasant New TVNE.
^ I.
MY sweet Corydon, art thou fled and gone,
and left Cynthia in Sighs and Tears;
I have no Relief, but oppressed with Grief,
haunted with Troops of slavish fears:
Oh! that now I was in thy tender Arms,
Tasting of those Charms
which I would enjoy:
O ye Gods be kind, -- Ease my mind, --
don't a Lady thus destroy.
II.
Bring me to my Dear, for alas! I fear,
all my Friends they do frown on me;
Therefore for thy sake, my poor heart will break
if that I cannot come to thee:
Dejected here I wander all alone,
Sigh and making moan,
to enjoy my Dear;
In thy loving Breast, -- I could rest, --
but I have no quiet here.
III.
Now my drooping Soul, daily does condole,
those sad sorrows I undergo,
Unregarded I, here lamenting lie,
tears from my melting Eyes does flow:
But therefore I re^olve to quit the Grove,
And search for my Love,
never thus despair;
For my Corydon, -- Sure he can, --
ease me of my grief and care.
IV.
When thou w^rt with me, in Felicity,
I my Minutes in Mirth did spend;
But thou being gone, and I left alone,
there is many Evils does attend:
Those nymphs which formerly were will not to smile
Now does me Revile,
therefore i will arise:
And will come to thee, -- Love, said she, --
whom I do so highly prize.
V.
If I live or Dye, in his Company,
there my Happiness will I place;
Like two Lovers sweet, we will each other Greet,
kiss and most tenderly Embrace:
For wheresoever he shall make his Bed,
There i would lay my Head,
troubles to destroy:
Ye Powers let me have, -- What I crave --
then you will Crown my grief with joy.
VI.
In the silent Night, will I take my flight,
when the Shepherds are all secure,
Wander far and near, to find out my Dear,
whose absence I cannot endure:
For though I now do feel the fatal smart,
Of a broken heart,
then I shall be free;
When I find my Love, -- Who will prove --
both my Life and Liberty.
VII.
Though these Lines I leave, yet let no one grieve,
when they find 'um within my Bower,
I am gone alone, for to find out one,
which is a sweet and famous Flower,
Whom I have reason always to adore,
Nay, and Honor more
then another Swain;
Therefore Nymphs farewell -- Now, and tell, --
that I shall return again.
FINIS.
