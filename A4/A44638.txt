A FEW Plain Words OF INSTRUCTION Given forth as moved of the Lord, for all
people, whose minds and hearts are inclinable after the way of peace and rest
with the Lord, which the Leaders of the people in this age have caused them to
err from, and have forgotten their resting place.

With a true Testimony for the Lord and his power which gathers out of the
World, and against all gathered, and not by the true Jesus the Savior of the
soul, Gods Salvation, and Rock of Ages from everlasting to everlasting.

And a Testimony against all blind guides, and foolish builders which would
make the word of God (the word of faith in the heart and in the mouth) of no
effect, by their own Imaginations, and so brings forth the Hypocrites hope,
and so leaves and people in Egypt and Sodom where they found them, where our
Lord was and is crucified.

And this is a true Testimony in righteousness, born unto all the World for the
Truths sake (which is better then life it self) by him who is known to many by
name. Luke Howard. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Bull and Mouth
near Aldersgate, 1658.

ON the eleventh day of the third Month, 1658. as I stood at my labor in my
outward calling, with my mind staid on the Lord, and my thoughts exercised in
his Law which is light, the state and condition of the deceived, and the
deceiving Preachers of these times, came into my mind, and their
unrighteousness was laid before me, (as it had been many a time before) by
which the people have been and are deceived, and perishes for want of
knowledge, so I was moved of Lord in the clear spirit of truth, to propound
these queries for the seed sake, which is kept in bondage in all people, which
are led by such blind guides, to the making manifest some part of their unclean
spirit, which rules in them, and in all people which are lead by them; which
lives out of the Truth, the which truth makes free all which lives in it;
and therefore is their anger kindled against all which are made free by it,
because they are in bondage to the spirit of this world, and so have a life in
another thing then in the truth of the Lord God who made the World and all
things therein, which dwells not in Temples made with hands, neither is he
worshipped by men's hands, seeing he gives life and breath unto all, for that
end alone, that all should live unto him, and praise his great and glorious
Name, which is known over all, as all stand in the Covenant of life and light
with him in which they were created; And seeing that this God is very much
professed, and little known, and less worshipped in the spirit and in the
truth, although there be so many worshippers of him in words of all sorts, they
all worshipping they know not what, being out of the Covenant wherein they were
created, even of the light wherein the true knowledge and worship of God
stands; and therefore as one which has obtained mercy, and by it brought
into Covenant again, do I propound these Queries in love unto all to consider
of, and let the witness of God in all consciences answer.

Quere. 1. WHether God be not all light, and in him is no darkness at all? And
whether this were not and be not the message which the Saints and Ministers of
Christ were and are now to preach according to the Scriptures?

Quere 2. Whether Jesus Christ be not the light of the World, and has not
enlightened every one which comes into the World? And whether all which
believes in his light shall not come out of darkness, and feel and witness the
light of light according to the Scriptures?

Quere 3. Whether God and Christ in the light be not one according to the
Scriptures? And although many may, and do say so, because it is left on Record
by the spirit of Truth which dwelt in the Children of light, yet whether any
can come unto the true knowledge of it, but by the mystery of faith held in a
pure concience? And whether all men be not without that faith by nature, and
whether any can come unto that faith until they believe in the light which
shines in the heart, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
the face of Jesus Christ, which is eternal life, as it is abided in, according
to the Scripture?

Quere 4. Whether Christ Jesus, the Covenant of Light, does not proceed from
the Father and God of Light as a free gift of grace unto man, shining in his
heart to make manifest with the Spirit of Truth the thoughts and intents of the
heart, for to keep man from the committing of actions which are evil, which are
first committed in the thoughts of the heart where the alienation stands? And
whether this be not the condemnation of all which are condemned, that they turn
from the Covenant of God, and do not set to their seals by believing in it the
Covenant of light? And whether this the Covenant of light be not the way of God
for all to meet him in, and to work righteousness in, by casting off the works
and deeds of darkness, which by the light in the heart are made manifest? And
whether all which does join unto the light by believing in it, does not join
unto God in Christ Jesus in the new Covenant which God makes with his people,
which is written in the heart, and put into the inward parts, wherein the light
shines according to the Scripture?

Quere 5 And whether all unrighteousness be not sin, and whether he which
commits sin be not of the Devil? and whether he which loves so to do be not
brought forth into the image of the Devil? and whether any which will not cast
off what by the light is made manifest to be evil, does not love their sins,
and hate the light, and so joining unto the evil, shut themselves out of
Covenant with God in the light, and so remains in the Covenant of death and
darkness, and so under the bond of iniquity? And whether any which therein
stand be fit to preach unto others the way of God, which is life and light, and
if any do presume to use their tongues to preach to others in that state, then
whether all such be not hypocrites and vain talkers, intruding into such things
as they never saw from the Lord in the Covenant of light, but have learned it
by nature and tradition, and so are vainly puffed up in their fleshly minds? and
whether they are not those who shall never profit the people at all, they
having gotten as it were a form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof
(which stands in the Covenant of light?) and whether all people which have
been followers of such be not to turn away from them and to turn to Christ
Jesus, Gods Covenant of light, which he has freely given as a free gift of
grace unto all men that will receive him to be their teacher, and to learn of
him alone according to the Scripture?

Quere 6. And whether all which love and live in sin and unrighteousness, and
yet will presume to preach the words of righteousness recorded in the
Scripture of truth, be not such as steal the words now, as the false Prophets
did whom the Lord was against? And whether the Lord be not against them now as
ever he was? and whether they be not such as run when the Lord never sent them,
and so shall never profit the people at all, no more then they did? And whether
all such Preachers may not as well be known now, as in the days past, by their
fruits? for can we gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles now any more
than they could then? and may we not know them now by their fruits as they did
then, which preached for filthy lucres sake, and through feigned words and
covetous practices makes merchandise of the people, every one looking for his
gain from his quarter, that so he may feed himself with the fat, and cloth
himself with the wool? but he starveth the flock; and if any for conscience
sake cannot put into their mouths, they even prepare war against them now as
they did then; and of this sort are all such preachers as rebel against the
light, as the prophets Testimony of them is? And are we any more to uphold them
now then the children of light were then? or are we not to bear our public
Testimony against them now as they did then, according to the whole current of
Scripture?

Quere 7. Whether all which lives in the practice of that horrible and filthy
thing which was committed in the Land of Israel as it is now in the land of
England, to the far exceeding of them, as the Priest preaching for hire, and
the Prophets prophesying for money (and the peoples loving to have it so) be
not as much now to be witnessed against, as it was then? And whether it be not
as great an evil, and as much to be taken notice of by our God now as it was
then, for his Witnesses to be evilly entreated now as they were then, to the
great shame of the name of a Christian, who has stole the name, and lost the
nature, and so brings forth contrary fruit, even such as the Lord will repay
with vengeance, according to the words of his Son Jesus Christ the same
yesterday as to day and for ever, the Rock of Ages, and foundation of all
truth, according to the Scripture?

Quere 8. And whether all which live in sin and love so to do, which can run
from Town to Town, and from Parish to Parish, and from Ship to Ship for gifts
and rewards, and so preach as to get the peoples money by flattery, and daubing
of them up with untempered mortar, in telling them they are that which the
witness of God in their consciences tells them they are not, and if they
cannot so have the wages of unrighteousness (the peoples money) then they will
take it by the force of a carnal pretended Law, which is without all grounds
for it, but any way to have it will serve their turn? Whether all such be not
Rebels against the power of the Lord Jesus, and against the Covenant of God,
wherein the sure mercies of David are enjoyed, and the glory of Israel is
witnessed, even the free covenant of light, in which the true Prophets did and
does stand, which as a light unto the feet, and a lanthorn unto the paths it
compasses the minds of all the Children of light, and so guides them out from
under the teachings of all such evil-minded men and seducers, for they wax
worse and worse through covetousness, so the one he builds up a wall, and
the other he daubeth it with untempered mortar, and so they keep up that alive
which should be put to death, and put to death that which should be kept alive,
and as the false Prophets ever did, whose damnation slumbereth not according to
the Scripture?

Quere 9. Whether all which live in sin, and love so to do, and yet will
presume to use their tongues to preach to others from the words of the
Scriptures of truth, be not now as great thieves as the false Prophets of old
were, who stole the true Prophets words, and said, Thus says the Lord, when
the Lord never spoke unto them, and though they spoke true words, yet they
could not profit the people, because they stole them, and did not speak from
the spirit of truth, the life of righteousness made manifest in them, and so
although they did swear the Lord lives, which was true words, yet they swore
falsely, and how can that spirit now speak Truth, which could the speak nothing
but falsehood, hood, although they did speak true words, for now for a man
which lives in sin, and loves it, for him to preach to another of the true
Ministers lives recorded in the Scriptures, because they lived according to
their words, which are true words, that does not make him righteous, neither
does his words reach to the witness of God which is righteous in every man's
conscience which hears him, and so none are able to learn righteousness by
him, because that spirit is head in him, and speaks the words which has a
life in sin and unrighteousness, as covetousness, pride, and what not? for
from one root does all sin proceed, and so the blind leads the blind, and
all must needs fall into the ditch, according to the Scripture?

Quere 10 And so whether that which is given unto every man to profit withal,
and to lead man out of sin up to God, be not by them murdered, and that which
the Devil has begotten in man, which is the seed of the Serpent, whose life is
in sin (and therefore will plead for it) be not by them nourished and kept
alive, and this is just contrary the one unto the other, and unto the promises
of God unto man, that the seed of the woman shall break the head of the
Serpent, and this was and is all that ever the righteous Ministers of God ever
traveled and labored for, to bring forth the seed of the Woman, whose name is
called the Word of God, to rule in the heart, by which the creature was and is
made able to do the will of God; and here was and is the blessing of the
promises felt as this birth is felt, but the Devil who was the murderer from
the beginning of this birth, and abode not in the truth which is the light, and
in all which are from the Covenant of light does he rule, and labor to carry
on his old work to keep people from believing in the light, the Covenant of
God, wherein the ability stands, and is received to destroy and overcome the
power of hell and death which is his Kingdom, so can all the Children of light
truly say, greater is he which is in us, then he which is in the World,
according to the Scripture?

And thus have I in love unto the seed of God in all propounded these few
Queries, to the opening of the opening of the understanding of all, which have
not fully made shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, but feels something
yet left which hungereth and thirsts after righteousness, and unto it it the
blessing is, which will not be, nor cannot be satisfied with the talk of the
thing, but must have the thing it self, which is the substance, or else it
dies, which all which are covered with the shadow of, are willing to set to
their shoulders by words and actions to persecute, but if in a blind zeal they
kill the body, and think they do God good service in so doing, that will not
excuse them, but they fulfill the Scripture to their own destruction, for the
servant is not greater then his Master, and our reward is with Him, in whom I
rest, in my measure, a friend unto all, and known unto the Lord in it and to
the sons of men, by my name, as to man,

Luke Howard.

AND now a few words unto all you which call your selves Churches gathered out
of the World, I matter not your names of distinction, for that cover will not
not hide you, the nature and ground being standing which is all one, and with
the light of Christ Jesus you are seen and made manifest, and unto the measure
of the same light in you all (in whom it is not yet put out) I speak and write
these lines for you to consider of, Whether you be gathered out of the World,
yea or nay? or by what spirit or power you are gathered together? for this
know, that it is not sufficient for you to gather in a heap together, and call
your selves by the name of the Church of Christ, and yet the fruits of the
Sprit of Christ not to be found among you, but that ground standing which
brings forth briers and thorns, both in you and your Leaders, and all such
fruit is but for the fire and the wrath of the Lord, and therefore for you to
pretend to practice such things, as the Saints in the days past did practice,
by the leadings of the spirit of life which dwelt in them, and so left them on
record for the learning of all which are lead by the same spirit which can read
them and understand them, according as they live in the fulfilling of them, for
they were the Sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and as many as are led the
same Spirit of God they are the Sons of God now and none else, and therefore
consider whether the pure Spirit of the Lord have led you to gather together,
or your own spirits, the which yet has fellowship with the World, and can join
thereto, and love the things thereof, and this is a true Testimony that the
love of the Father is not in such, neither are they called out of the World.

It is true, there was a cry once in the hearts of many of you after
righteousness, and there was in your hearts and minds an inclining to
satisfy it, and that which cried after righteousness was the righteous spirit
and seed of God, and the manifestation of it was given unto you for to profit
withal, which cry was against unrighteousness, for to have been separated
indeed from under the burden of it, which did oppress it as a Cart is
oppressed with sheaves, that so it might have enjoyed its freedom, with the
Lord in righteousness which is its life; but now consider whether you have
profited in this, which was given unto you to profit withal, or whether you
have not profited and increased in your own spirit, and so have this murdered,
and by your self-separation are grown harder and harder in sin and iniquity,
and so through the strength and subtilty thereof have learned how to live in it
and to cover it over, and to plead for it, but woe be to him which covers his
sin and hides his transgression, for he shall not prosper, for the hand of the
Lord will search out the hidden things of Esau; for now consider this in the
fear of the Lord, that that which in the days past bore witness against sin,
and cried after righteousness has not now changed its nature to become
willing to live in sin, although its voice may not be so much heard as in the
days past, because the earth is grown thicker over it then it was, yet that
which was humble in you and then called for humility and wrought some
tenderness in you is the same still as its hearkened unto, and is not now
become proud, but bears witness against it still as its suffered to speak in
you, and that which was righteous and wrought in you some tenderness in the days
past, and cried after righteousness that it might have had a free life from
under the bond of iniquity, has not now changed his nature to become
unrighteous to live in covetousness and pride, and according to the course of
this world, to serve the times as often as they do change, and to seek the honor
and glory and profit of this world and to join thereto, but that spirit which
can do these things is that which has murdered this just one and slain the
Lamb of God, now as ever it has done, from the foundation of the world, and
here read your selves all you time-serving Professors; And therefore as you
prize your eternal peace consider of your latter end before it be too late when
time shall be no more, for then such fruits will be bitter unto you, therefore
whilst you have time prize it and answer the requirings of the spirit of the
Lord by obeying of it, and rebel not against it when these things are made
manifest by it, and sell not your birthright therein for vain and unprofitable
things which in the day of the Lord you will be ashamed of.

For this honestly consider of, whether a foolish custom of words or practices
in action or fashions of apparel which rises out of the carnal heart, be not
vain and unprofitable, although the heart may be so much drawn into the thing,
that the eye can scarce see or look, or the ear hear, but the spirit lusts
after all it sees or hears and whether the living therein be not rebelling
against the light, which sometimes checketh in secret for them, and whether
Rebellion against that that checketh, be not as the sin of witchcraft, which
makes the heart harder and harder, and so much the harder, because you are
covered with a profession of the Saints life, which you are out of, and so are
in the liberty of the flesh; but woe be to him that covers his sin, for he
shall not prosper; therefore to the light which makes all things in the heart
manifest incline your ear, and hear, that your souls may live, and to it bow,
and in it wait, that you may be compassed about therewith, and feel the
righteous power of life which in it is made manifest, the tongue to bridle, and
the whole man to govern, or else your profession is all in vain, and it is
cursed, as is your pride and all unrighteousness; for now for a proud and
covetous man in his proud and covetous mind to profess Religion, that does not
make him righteous, nor change his heart, nor yet his looking into the
Scriptures of Truth, and with that Spirit which leads out the mind to pride
and covetousness; read them over, and imagine and think how the Saints in
days past were separated from the World, and so catches up something in his
carnal mind, which causes him to get into some heap of people or other called
a Church, and so remains still ignorant of that which changes the heart; for
that which changes the heart, separated them from the World, and gathered them
out of it, and caused them to bear a righteous Testimony against the World and
is the condemnation of all which believes not in it, and the salvation of all
which believes in it, and profits by it, and answers its requirings by
obeying of it, and casting off every weight and burden which does so easily
beset it, that it may arise, which will be made able through the power of him
that reareth it to run with patience the race of righteousness set before it,
which race cannot be seen, nor what is to be be cast off known, but as the mind
is stayed in the light which makes all things manifest that is reproveable by
it. And therefore all you which love and serves the unjust power which leads
the heart and mind to sin, and keeps the just under suffering, under the power
of iniquity, in captivity, to your lust, to you -- I say, it seems but a
small thing to you to blaspheme the light of Christ which shines in the heart,
and makes all things manifest, which opposes the seed of God, this you can
call natural light, or natural conscience, as often as you please, as the dark
power moves in your minds, because your tongues are your own, but such names
the Scriptures never called it by; so your blasphemy will rest upon to bear
when the light must be your condemner and judge; but this I know, if you did
not love your evil deeds, and hate the light as the Scripture says, I am sure
you would not so call it, neither could you so blaspheme it. For now consider
this, that spiritual wickedness in the heart which makes desolate the soul,
and stands where it ought not to stand, cannot be made manifest by a natural
light, but that must of necessity be spiritual which makes manifest spiritual
wickedness, and leads out of it, and this is the whole work of the power of
darkness to keep peoples hearts from believing in the light, and to place a
prejudice in the mind against it, least it should make him manifest, and the
ground in which his power stands, and so his Kingdom should come to be
destroyed, which will be as the light is believed in; and this Testimony I bear
for the Lord unto his light against all the blasphemers of it, in the whole
world.

And therefore all you which are got into heaps, and call your selves the
Church of Christ, and yet can plead against the light of Christ, which leads
into the Church of God, which is in Christ Jesus, the Rock of Ages, as he is
the light of the World.

Do not you manifest your selves to be gathered and separated only in words,
and by a wrong Spirit, and so by your fruits declare your selves but to be the
Synagogue of Satan, begotten by the prince of pride, and father of lies, who
has taught you to blaspheme, to call your selves Saints in saying you are
separated from the World, and yet differ in your practice nothing from the
World? except it be to exceed them in wickedness; for to live in sin, and to
be able to plead for it, the which many of them are ashamed to do, and so the
Publican and Harlot may enter into the kingdom of God before ye. So upon a
true search and weighing of you in the true balance, and measuring of you by a
just measure, I cannot find you to be but the worst of men, and the greatest
enemies to the Cross of Jesus which are this day living, and not wrong you at
all; And this Testimony I must needs give of the greatest part of you that ever
I met with, that it is the greatest work you find to do, to plead for sin, and
for to live in it as long as you live in the body, so you show what Lord you
serve, and whom you are willing to serve as long as you can serve him, and yet
you say you hope to be glorified with the Saints in light, and to have an
inheritance among them which are sanctified: Is not this the hope of the
Hypocrite, and will it not perish? for where will you be sanctified? Not by
imputed righteousness (as you call it) in your dark minds whilst you live in
sin, and sinning against the light and power of him who is the true light and
power to destroy and take away sin and the ground of it: And therefore this
consider, how you will by your principles escape holding of a Purgatory when
you are dead, let the wise in heart which live by faith judge; so of the worst
of men in practice, and one with the Papist in judgment I find you to be, and
yet do you no wrong at all in so saying of you, neither do I write this to
upbraid you, God is my witness, but to make manifest your ignorance to the
view of your understanding, that you may see you are not separated as you say
you are from the World, but as the father of lies has deceived your hearts,
and so made you a perfect Synagogue for himself to dwell in and among; whilst
he rules in the heart and guides your tongues to plead against the perfect
light of Christ Jesus, the true Savior of the soul from sin, and calls it
natural, and so undervalueth it as a thing too low for you to walk by, and as
if you had a higher light to walk by, when thousands can witness to the glory
of the Lord and the praise of his grace, that the light which you call natural
and low leads out of sin and gives victory over it, whereas that which you
call a higher light and spiritual, you are forced to confess does not so lead
you out of sin, but that it leaves a root for you to plead for and to remain
un-cut up as long as you live; And whether yours be the Lords Axe which cuts up
the corrupt tree by the root, let the pure witness of God in your consciences
answer? And so whether that which you call spirital and high, or that which you
call natural and low, be the true light of the Lord, which he has given to be
salvation to the ends of the earth, let the Children of light judge, which by
the Word of life which they have seen, tasted and handled of can judge
righteous judgment? and so say in truth, greater is he which is in us, then he
which is in the World, to the fulfilling of the Scripture, which says, The
strong man armed keeps the house until the stronger then he comes which all
the pleaders for sin are yet ignorant of, so are to be silent, and to the name
of Jesus to bow, and in the light to wait, until they feel the working of that
power in them which binds the strong man and spoileth his goods, and this is
the power of God which saves from sin, and so leads the mind and heart by
its power to plead against all sin, and to plead for everlasting
righteousness, and in it to dwell by believing in the light.

And thus I have born my Testimony unto the light of the Lord, against the
darkness of the World, and to the righteousness of God, against the
unrighteousness of the World, and all that plead for it, whether they he
gathered together, and call themselves (though falsely) the Church of Christ, or
not gathered together, for in the light they are seen to be all one, as well
now as in the days past, who have stole the name but have lost the nature, and
so are dead whilst they live.

Luke Howard.

AND now all my dear brethren which are redeemed from under the Idol shepherds,
and gathered out of the false ways and worships, (which are many in the World)
which are dear and near unto me in the Lord, who has visited us with the
dayspring, or the springing of the day from on high, and by his eternal power
in the word of life has visited his own plant in us all, to the raising up of
the Prisoner of hope, which can both patiently wait and hope for the Salvation
of God. I say unto you all, dear friends, in the bowels of everlasting love and
tenderness, and as you tender the glory of our God and your own eternal peace,
dwell low in the fear of God, and keep unto that in and by which you have been
visited, and forget it not by any means, but keep to it that you may all be
sensible in the feeling of a living principle of God, born up in your
understanding, for to keep your minds always stayed on the Lord in the watch
that the enemy enter not, so will you find the seed to grow and the Prisoner of
hope to be brought forth, which comes to do the will of him that has it
begotten, and visited, and by the right hand of his power has it brought
forth, which cannot live out of the presence of that God of power and life
which begot it and brought it forth, and this is the way of Gods salvation,
wherein it is revealed to all that wait for it. And here all people and
professors of all sorts come and try your hope, If it be not the hope of Gods
elect it will not stand you in stead in the day of the Lord, when he appears
to give to every man according to his faith, but will prove you to be but the
hope of the Hypocrite and that will perish eternally, And therefore whilst you
have time prize it and consider from which seed your hope rises, for that seed
which can live out of the presence of God is not Gods elected one, but is that
which is cursed eternally, and if that profess and hope, it hopes in vain, for
it is reprobated concerning the faith of Gods elect, and is cast out of
Abraham's house, or the habitation of the faithful for ever, for it is that
which gendereth to bondage, and so to death, and ends therein, and to the
liberty or freedom of the seed of God it is a stranger, for now consider this
that seed or spirit which can live in pride cannot live in humility, and that
which can live in unrighteousnes cannot live in righteousness, and that which
can live in the service of the Devil cannot live in the service of God, and
therefore all you which can live in sin and unrighteousness, in death and
darkness and plead for it, and yet say you hope for salvation with the Lord,
whose nature and being is in righteousness and purity, in the immortal light
and glory, (for righteousness is the girdle of his Loins.) Are you not
deceived by the deceiver and father of lies? who will let you be Hypocrites and
let you leap into a profession and steal the name of Saints, and of being
called out of the World so that he may keep his seed alive in you, which cannot
live but in transgression, and therefore will plead against perfect freedom,
for by this the Devil knows that if he can but get men to love sin and
transgression, and to join thereto, as to covetousness, and pride and
wantonness, and seeking honor one of another, or any unrighteousnes for to
serve him in, and yet make a profession too; then such a man is fit to make a
Teacher and a Ruler in his Kingdom of darkness, and to plead for it against
the light, that so his work to murder the seed of God which is begotten in the
light may go the more stronger on in the mystery of iniquity, for if the
serpents seed in Cain which can embrace this present World, should offer a
Sacrifice, is it not from that ground which is cursed, and is it not an
abomination to the Lord as his murder is? For if that seed or nature offer a
sacrifice, or if it slay a man, is it not all one as to the Lord? yea
assuredly, although by its sacrificing and profession it would seek to cover
its sin and the ground from whence it proceeds wherein its life lies which
is nourished and kept alive by the dust threof, which is all cursed for its
sake, he that reads let him understand.

And therefore all people upon the face of the earth unto whom these lines may
come, this is that I have to say unto you all in love unto the seed of God in
you all, the Lord is my witness I lie not I say this unto you all, If you will
have eternal peace with your Maker, bow down to that which may be known of God
the light of Jesus Christ which is eternal, which is made manifest in you, and
is daily shown unto you, which light is the grace of God which appears unto
you, and checketh you in secret when no eye sees you, and discoverteh the
thoughts and intents of your hearts unto you before they are brought forth into
evil actions, the which if you receive it, I am a witness for the Lord in this
the day of his power, that it will teach you to deny all ungodliness, or that
which is not like God which it reproves, and brings you into the image of God,
or likeness, which is righteousness and true holiness which it justifies,
but if you rebel against it, assuredly it will eternally condemn you from his
presence, although you may say in your hearts you hope it will not, for now the
grace of God is the light of Christ Jesus which shows to man sin and
unrighteousness, for this end that all might be led out of it and to bring in
everstaing righteousness, that the spirit thereof might rule and have the
government upon his shoulders alone, whose habitation is only in the light,
and therefore if that spirit work in the mind and rule in the heart whose life
is in darkness and out of the bounds of the heart, bringing forth the deeds of
darkness, and yet say, you have hope in God which is light and in him is no
darkness at all; is not this the hope of the Hypocrite to think you may live
in Dives his nature all your life time, and yet have Lazarus his possession,
when you can no longer live therein? For this consider wherefore you were
created, but to glorify your Creator in your spirits, and in and with your
bodies which is but your reasonable service, and to live unto God in all
things, and not unto your selves, and therefore be still and consider and let
the witness of God in all conciences answer before it be too late and there be
no remedy, And if you sow to the flesh, how can you think you can reap the
fruits of the spirit? and if you sow to your lust, how can you think you shall
reap the fruits of chastity? and if you sow to the spirit of pride, can you
hope to reap the fruits of humility? and if you sow to the spirit of this
world, whose life is in the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the
pride of life, and covetousness, and all things which are not of God, and how
can you say or think it possible you should reap the fruits of the Spirit of
God by which he calls and all the day long stretches out his hand by it?
that so he might have the heart, it to guide and rule to the bringing forth
fruit to him and not to your selves, for herein is our heavenly Father
glorified when fruit to his spirit is brought forth, and all herein rare
approved of with the Lord, and all such condemned already which believes not
in him which gives the victory over the spirit of this World, which spirit
cannot live if it be not fed with the fruit thereof, and therefore consider he
which lives in pleasure is dead whilst he lives, and he which lives wantonly
on the earth crucifieth the just, and he which is covetous is an Idolatour, and
all such are shut out of the Kingdom of God, which the Spirit of Jesus the true
light leads unto, and are amongst the dogs and swine in the devouring nature
ready to quarrel both in words and actions, about the words and things of God,
which are not theirs; and here may all Hypocrites read their portion, who can
make a profession and plead for it, and with the same mind, and by the same
spirit plead and quarrel against the Saints, and against the perfect
righteousness of God to be enjoyed in this life, and so opposes the command of
God, and the gift of God, and the work of God by Jesus Christ, which is to
purchase unto himself a Church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, and
so makes as much as in them lies the Word of God of none effect by their own
imaginations, which word is near in the heart, and in the mouth, and as it is
believed in, it is ingrafted in the heart, and it is able to save the soul from
sin and that is its effect to all which believe in it; for the Word of God is
the life of God, and the life of God is the light of men, and the light of men
is Jesus, the Savior of all which believe in him, and his Name is called the
Word of God, the entrance whereof gives life, and he has so appeared in this
the day of his power, to be the word of life from the dead, a quickening spirit
to many faithful and true Witnesses of his resurrection and his life, even him
who was dead and is a live, and behold he lives for ever more everlasting
praises be unto him, and glory for ever and he will so appear unto all which
wait for him, and ask the way to Zion with their faces thither-ward, and backs
set to Aegypts Land never there to return again, but now here is a great talk
at this day of Zion and the way there, and some presume to be Leaders to her,
and builders of her waste places again, which the wild bore of the forest has
laid waste, but where among them all are they to be found, whose faces are set
to Zion, and their backs to Egypt, for the chief corner stone has been and is
neglected by them all, even that on which all the building should stand, Christ
Jesus the light of the World and Rock of Ages; and so although they have and
may talk of the way to Zion, and of building up of her walls, yet their faces
have been and now are much more then in the days past set to Aegypts land of
darkness and bondage wherein our Lord was and is Crucified; for now consider
honestly this thing, whilst a man asks the way to Zion that is to say, the
place of Gods habitation, which the Lord has chosen for his rest, and yet his
face set to Egypt that is to say the place of the Devils habitation, with his
mind and heart in pride and covetousness, or after any thing which is not of
God, he is not like to come to Zion, although he may talk of it in words, but
it stands not in words, for the King and Law giver thereof his appearance is
and will be dreadful to all such, the workers of iniquity, for the proud and
all which do wickedly shall be unto him as stubble is unto the fire; and
therefore this know plainly, that if you ask the way to Zion aright, your faces
must be thither-ward, and your backs full set to Egypt that is to say, your
minds and hearts set against all the deeds of darkness, which as you love the
light, and so bring all your deeds unto it, you will come to see and feell the
power of the Lord, you to lead out of the land of darkness, into his
mervellous light, for the gift of God, the light which shines in the heart it
shines for this very end and purpose, to give the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, Gods salvation from sin, which is
so made unto all which believe in him, as he is the true light of the World,
and the wisdom of God, and the power of God to keep in the daily cross, which
the wise builders have and do leave behind as a thing too low and mean for them
to build in, and therefore have been and are ashamed of it: but to us it is the
mighty power of God unto Salvation, by which we are crucified unto the World,
and the World unto us, so that we can say with the Saints which are gone before
(everlastlasting praises be unto our God for ever) that we are not ashamed of
the Gospel of Christ, for it is the mighty power of God unto Salvation to every
one that believes; for the Gospel is the power, and the Cross is the power,
and hereon and herein we build that which the gates of Hell and death cannot
destroy, because it is founded on the Rock of Ages, Christ Jesus the light of
the World, he that has an ear to hear let him hear, and he that reads let
him understand, and he which can receive it let him.

And thus in plain words have I born my testimony unto the World as a witness
against all the foolish builders and deceivers, and blind guides, which therein
live, and this of them I have to say yet not I but the Lord, that of all men in
the World their condition is the most miserable, because there is very few of
them, if any, which does not sin against their knowledge, and so are desperate
Hypocrites for pieces of bread, and handfuls of barley, to maintain themselves,
their Wives and Children in pride and idleness, and so murder in their way by
consent, to the fulfilling of the Scriptures to their own destruction. And this
is my Testimony to all men in righteousness for my God through Jesus Christ my
Savior, my righteousness, wisdom, sanctification and redemption, God over
all, hell and death, blessed for ever.

Luke Howard.
