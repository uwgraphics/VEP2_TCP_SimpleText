Catastrophe Mundi: OR, EVROPE'S many MUTATIONS Until the Year, 1701. Being an
ASTROLOGICAL TREATISE Of the Effects of the Triple Conjunction of Saturn and
Jupiter 1682 and 1683, and of the Comets 1680 and 1682, and other
Configurations Concomitant.

WHEREIN The Fate of Europe for these next 20 years is (from the most rational
grounds of Art) more than probably Conjectured.

LIKEWISE, For the benefit of the Sons of Art, there is a Table of all the
Years, in which the Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter happen in any of the
four Triplicities from 3958 before Christ, to the year of our Redemption 1702,
with a Table of the year, in which the Six Primary Planets changed their
Aphelions from the beginning of the World for many years to come, all deduced
from the Caroline Tables.

ALSO, An Ephimeris of all the Comets that have appeared from the Year of our
Lord 1603, to the Year 1682, with a new way how to find in what year they will
most operate.

Lilly, in the Year 1651.) Rightly placed and in order, (formerly misplaced)
with the addition of many more.

TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader.
IT having been my Fate to Live in times that have been so Troublesome (though
not in England) put me upon the Inquiry from what Natural Causes these many
Calamities that have attended Europe for this last past 10 years, and having
examined many Authors concerning the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, and
found that their Catalogue of Conjunctions was grossly false, having had a light
of their fullness by Mr. Edling's Nuncius Syderens, published by him 1664. I
took upon me to Calculate the several years of their Conjunction from the
Caroline Tables of Mr. Thomas Street, and have Framed a Table thereof for 3958
Years before the coming of Christ our Savior, until the year of our Lord God
1702; and have also Framed a Table from the same Caroline Table of the
Mutations of the Aphelions of the Planets, for many years to come, that thereby
the Artist might have a sure Foundation, for want of which Astrology has been
very lame. I have also presented you with all the Comets, that have been
observed since 1602. with a new method how to judge of the time of their
Effects, and have examined the truth by Examples by past, by which I found out
the way. I have also presented you with a Speculum of the Directions of the
great Conjunction 1603. and the New Star 1604. and have also showed a way how
the lesser Conjunction may be directed for to find the time of the Accidents. I
have also presented you with a Speculum of the Conjunction 1663. and of the
Conjunction 1682. Likewise with a Table of all the Conjunctions and Oppositions
of Saturn and Mars: And also with a Table of all the Eclipses of the Luminaries
from the year 1683, to the year 1701. with a Table of the Aspect that Saturn
and Jupiter makes till the year 1701. all which Tables cost me a great deal of
time, for the Table of the several Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter, cost me
6 Months trouble at my spare times. So likewise have I given a probable
Conjecture of the Triple Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1682, and 1683. and
the two Comets that have appeared last, (viz) 1680, and 1682. And I have also
presented you with my probable Conjecture of each year from the year 1682, to
1700. In which I have as near as I could, kept close to the Rules of Astrology,
yet it is possible in some things for want of Presidents, I may not hit just
the time, but I hope the Ingenious will pass by these things, knowing that very
few of the Ancients have treated any thing to the purpose of Conjunctions; many
of the things that I present you withal, are wholly new. I have also Annexed
the Hyroglyphicks of Nostradamus, published by Mr. Lilly 1651. and have taken
the pains to place them right and in order (for Mr. Lilly placed them wrong and
out of order) besides, I have added a many more which relate to the Mutations
of Europe, the next 20 years, all which labor and pains (which I will assure
you was not small) I present to the World, hoping it may meet with the kind
acceptance of the Ingenious of this Age; which if it do, is all the reward I
expect, and it will oblige me to make a further Inquiry into Astrology; but in
the mean time

Die Jovis October 12th. 1682. Farewell, John Holwell.

The Proeme.
IT has been the Divine Will of the Creator, from the Foundation of the World,
That all things below the Moon should be subject to Change, and that their
Mutation should be governed by a Cause above them, which are the Celestial
Bodies, they being set in a due Order from their Creation, and do keep their
Courses in the several Stations, without the least alteration, and by their
several Motions, some moving swifter then others, by which means they come
sometimes to be in Conjunction one with the other.

Saturn, the Highest of the 7 wandering Stars, and consequently the slowest, is
very near 30 Years a going through the 12 Signs: Next unto Saturn is Jupiter,
and he is near 12 Years going through the 12 Signs; and Mars is next to
Jupiter, and is near 2 Years a completing his Revolution about the 12 Signs;
the Sun being in the middle of the Universe, is a Year a going through the 12
Signs, or the Earth in his stead. Venus compleateth her Revolution in less than
a Year; and Mercury is near a Year passing through the 12 Signs; the Moon
finisheth her Course in about 28 days.

Among these 7 Wandering Stars, Saturn and Jupiter are the principle Subject of
this ansuing Discourse; they being the higher, and come to a Conjunction one
with the other, but once in Twenty Years; but Astrologers advise all those that
would understand any thing relating to Mundane Affairs to consider diverse other
Motions: Viz.

First, The Motion of the Aphelions of the Planets. Secondly, The several
Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter. Thirdly, New Stars that have lately
appeard, or been within a Hundred Years before. Fourthly, The several Comets
that has appeared in this last Age. Fifthly, The Eclipses of the Luminaries,
and the several Revolutions for the Years then in being.
And from these Five several Causes any Artist may give a probable Conjection
of what Mutations are approaching upon most parts of the Word.

CHAP. I. Of the Aphelions of Planets, and what Judgment may be drawn from
thence.
THE Aphelions of the Planets is no more than a fixed point in the Ellipsis of
the Planets Motion, which when any Planet is in Conjunction with that Point,
then are they in their furthest distance from the Sun, and are then the flowest
in their Motion; now the Motions of the Aphelions of the Planets, is not above
48 Seconds in a Year, and that is caused by the precession of the Equinoctial,
by which means it moves through the 12 Signs but once in 27000 Years; this
Motion of all Motion is the slowest; and therefore the Change of the Aphelion
of any of the Primary Planets is thought by those that have been Learned in
Astrology, to cause great Mutation in the World; but by reason that Astronomy
has been in former Ages very lame (as may be seen by any that do make but an
enquiry into it) has caused the famous Masters of this Science in former Ages
to err, for most, if not all Tables of Astronomy disagree in this very point,
about the Motion of the Aphelion, but the best Tables as yet extant, are the
Carolina Tables of Thomas Street, from which Tables I have framed a Table of
the Motion of the Aphelions of the Primary Planets, out of one Sign into
another, for some Years to come.

A Table to know when, and in what Year the Six Primary Planets Aphelions,
Changed their Signs.

All those that are furnished with History may compare former times with the
Mutations of the Aphelions of the Planets, and find a great satisfaction
therein; for 389 Years before the Flood, Saturn changed his Aphelion out of
Libra into Scorpio a Watery Sign, and 516 Years before the Flood Mars changed
his Aphelion out of Gemini into Cancer a Watery Sign: Now no Planet except
Saturn and Mars did change their Aphelion near those times; and when Mars
changed his Aphelion out of Cancer into Leo 123 Years afterward began the
Grecian Monarchy, and the Conquest of the known part of the World by Alexander
the Great; and but 4 Years before the Conquest of the World, Saturn changed his
Aphelion out of Scorpio into Sagitary; but by reason the Aphelions of the
Primary Planets are of so slow a Motion, (viz.) are no less than 2250 Years a
going out of one Sign into another, and to determine any Judgment from their
Motion, is very uncertain, because Astronomers differ so much about their
places: For Spineus will have the Aphelion of Mars to have passed out of Leo
into Virgo in the Year 1630; and by the Rudolphen Tables not till the Year
1650; and by the Caroline Table (which I hold to be most exact) not till 1691,
a considerable difference of time between these Tables: however such manner of
Accidents will certainly happen, as Spineus makes mention of in his Catastrophe
mundi (viz.) That there should be great War and Bloodshed all over the whole
World; even to the destruction of Monarchy in several Kingdoms, and reduce all
to an Aristocratical [or Democratica] Mediocrity, both in the Government of the
Commonwealth and Church; but ever that can be effected Omnia nutu unius
Regentur: So said Cardanus long since.

CHAP. II. Of the Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter.
THE Learned in Astrology do say, that there are three kinds of Conjunction,
which they term Magna or great, and medium or mean or middle, minimam or least
of all, this was the Opinion of Cardan, Noibod, Origanus, Hagben, and since
their Death Campanella, they likewise say, that when Saturn and Jupiter make
their first Conjunction in Aries, that should be counted the greatest of all;
but there has been none such never since the beginning of time, as was very
well noted by Mr. Edling, in his Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1663, and as
any one may see that will be pleased but to calculate their entrance into the
fiery Trigons; but note, that which I mean by a great Conjunction, is when
Saturn and Jupiter make their first Conjunction in the Fiery Trigon, which
Trigon is Aries, Leo, Sagitary, and their first Conjunction at the entrance of
Saturn and Jupiter in this Trigon, has always been in Sagitary: The reason the
Ancients has fondly imagined, that Saturn and Jupiter made sometimes their
Conjunction in Aries or Leo, I conceive to be for want of good Tables to
Calculate their Motions.

Now all Modern Authors call that the great Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter
which fall in the Fiery Trigon, (viz.) Aries, Leo, Sagitarius, and those the
mean which fall in any of the other Triplicities after their first entrance
into it; Now the first Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter fell in Sagitarius,
and that was 3958 Years before Christ, and they continued their Conjunction out
of Sagitarius into Leo and thence into Aries, until they had made 10
Conjunctions in the Fiery Trigon, and then they made their first Conjunction in
Virgo of the Earthy Trigon, and that was 3759 Years before the coming of
Christ, and so continued their several Conjunctions out of Virgo into Taurus,
and thence into Capricorn, until they had made 10 more Conjunctions, and then
they made their first Conjunction in the Airy Triplicity in Gemini, and that
was 3560 Years before the coming of Christ, and having made 10 Conjunctions in
that Triplicity, they made their first Conjunction in Pisces, of the Watery
Triplicity, and that was 3361 Years before the coming of Christ, and after
having made Ten Meetings in that Triplicity, did make their second meeting in
the fiery Trigon in Sagitarius. 3164 before the coming of Christ: So have they
continued their Conjunctions out of the fiery Triplicity into the Earthy, and
from thence into the Airy, and so into the Watery, and from thence into the
Fiery again, making no more nor less than 10 Conjunctions in each Triplicity,
and the first in the Fiery has always been in Sagitarius, and the first has
been in Virgo, of the Earthy, and in Gemini in the Airy, and Pisces in the
Watery. Indeed Mr. Lilly tells us in his Prophetical Merline p. 3. that the
first Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the Watery Triplicity, was in Cancer,
but by Calculation any one may find that their first Conjunction was in Pisces,
and likewise he does tell you, that if you may believe John Ganivetus,
otherwise called Amicus Medicorum, that upon their seventh Return into the
Watery Triplicity, that they made their first Conjunction in Scorpio, but by
Calculation their first meeting was in Pisces. 20 Years before Mr. Lilly in his
Anglicus 1677, published a Table of all the Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter
from the Creation of the World; but by Calculation I find that to be grossly
false, and so likewise is that Table published 1680, and that it may be seen
how far they be wide from the Truth, I have Published here a Table of all the
Conjunctions for 3958 Years before the coming of Christ.

Any one that please to compare this Table with that which was Published in the
Year 1677 by Mr. Lilly, and likewise that which was made Public 1680, will
find a very great difference, and for me to make Public the several Series of
the Calculations of the two Superiors Saturn and Jupiter, which I have been
forced to Calculate, and from thence to prove that I am in the Right, would be
too tedious for me to recite, and would cause this Volume to exceed its bounds;
besides, I think that Man not fit to find fault with what I have here inserted,
if he be not able to calculate their places himself, and show me my Errors; I
can assure him it is a great labor, and will take up a great many Sheets of
Paper for to do it; I likewise let him know, that the Years of their several
Conjunctions was calculated from the Caroline Tables of Mr. Thomas Street,
Published 1663, which Tables I take to be the best yet extant; but because the
young Artist should know in what degrees, and in what Month the two Planets
Saturn and Jupiter meet the first times in the Fiery Trigon, the first was 3958
Years before the coming of Christ in Sagitarius, 8 Degrees in the Month of
February.

The Second 3164 Ante Christ. in Sagitarius 5 d. 0, and in the Month of
November. The Third was 2370 Years before Christ in 8 d. 0 Sagitarius, and in
the Month of December. The Fourth was Ante Christum 1575, and there was no less
then three Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter that Year; the first was March
12. in 9 d. 0 Sagitarius: and the Second was in May in Sagitarius 8 d. 0: and
the Third was September in 4 d. 0 Sagitarius. Pray let the young Artist mind
but this Conjunction, and what followed it; the fifth Conjunction was 781 Years
before the Coming of Christ, in Sagitarius 13 0; and the Sixth was Anno Domini
15 in Sagitarius 15 0; and the Seventh was in the Year of our Lord 809, in
Sagitarius 6 0 and in the Month of October: And the Eighth time that they met
was in Sagitarius 8 d. 0, and in December 1603, under whicch Trigon we now are,
and shall continue till the Year 1802. Now those that are conversant in History
may examine what great alterations there have happened in the World at the
entrance of the Superiors Saturn and Jupiter in any of the Four Triplicities,
but more especially the Fiery, and they may find great content therein; yet for
the benefit of the Sons of Art, I will recite a few Remarques, which I hope
will not be amiss; the first Restitution of the Fiery Trigon, after the Worlds
Creation, happened in Enoch's time; the second happened but 36 Years before the
General Deluge, and it happened under the Influence of the Conjunction of
Saturn and Jupiter in Leo, and under the same Triplicity and Conjunction of
Saturn in Jupiter in Aries, 120 Years after the Flood was the destruction of
Languages, and the beginning of the Assyrian Monarchy; the third in Moses time,
and the Delivery of the Children of Israel out of Egypt: during of this Trigon,
and the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Aries 1535 before Christ, was the
Deucalions Deluge: Troy was destroyed during the Conjunction of Saturn and
Jupiter in Virgo 1198 Years before the coming of Christ, the Destruction
happening but 6 Years after that. Under the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter
in Gemini, which happened 1059 Years before the coming of Christ, was London
began to be built, Solomon's Temple was Founded under the Influence of Saturn
and Jupiter in Libra, that happening 1019 Years before the coming of Christ:
the Temple was began to be built 6 Years after that the Temple was destroyed,
626 Years before the coming of Christ, and before that 4 years, there was a
Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Aries the opposite Sign to Libra, Note.
a thing worth the taking notice of: 1258 Years before the Coming of Christ
there was a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Virgo, in that very Year began
the Persian Monarchy; and 443 Years before the Coming of Christ there was a
Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Taurus, 7 years after this began the
Grecian Monarchy; and 45 years before the coming of Christ was there a
Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Scorpio, in that very year, or very near
to it, was the destruction of the Grecian Monarchy, and the beginning of the
Roman Monarchy: under the Influence of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in
Sagitarius Anno Domini 809 was the Translation of the Western Empire to the
Germans. 761 years before the coming of Christ was there a Conjunction: of
Saturn and Jupiter in the Sign Leo, 10 years after that was Rome began to be
built; 15 years after the Birth of our Savior there was a great Conjunction of
Saturn and Jupiter in Sagitarius, and the sixth time they begun the Fiery
Trigon; under this very Conjunction began Christianity, which Faith shall
continue till the very end of time; 630 years after the coming of Christ, was
there a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Scorpio, under which Influence
began Mahomet to broach his Opinion in the World. A many more Examples may be
sound by any that are conversant in History, this that I have done being only
to show which way Astrology might be brought to a greater Perfection than now
it is, which Task I hope to see performed by a much Abler Hand than my self,
hoping the mean time that my Essay will not be slighted by those that are
Lovers of Art.

Pray take what Authors say will be the Effects of the Conjunctions of Saturn
and Jupiter through the 4 Triplicities.

Fiery Triplicity.
When Saturn and Jupiter make the first Conjunction in Aries God will suddenly
raise up some New Monarch of great force and command, that by War, and the
destruction of some neighboring Princes, enlarges his Dominions, and his
Posterity shall continue for many Ages; but at length his own Subjects will
parcel out his Inheritance; if in Leo, some sturdy Prince shall trouble all his
neighboring Princes, grows Ravenous, and exercises Tyranny, and thrives and
gets by all his indirect means; yet in the height of all his Greatness
vanishes by sudden Death: those Families that have their Rise in that 20 years
that Saturn and Jupiter is conjoined in Leo generally prove unfortunate; and
those Citys that have their Foundation laid under the Influence of Saturn and
Jupiter in Leo, prove to be Citys of long standing, and bear Rule over many
Countries, but yet unfortunate by Fires, and will exercise Tyrannies over
others, bearing of Rule with great Majesty. If in Sagitarius, the World begins
to be weary of former Wars, and upon small entreaty, will be ready to hearken
to Peace; some Ancient Family is a decaying, and a new one repairing and
exalted. Now begins new Doctrines, but none Privileged by Authority; the
Church much troubled with niceties; Men stumbling at Straws, and striding over
Blocks, during the first 20 years of that Trigons Government all things tend to
a Peace; many Men will be in hope to aspire to Greatness, the end crowned but
one, but two Generations pass not without superlative discord.

Note those Families, Kingdoms, Cities, Towns and Forts, and all manner of Men
that had their Rise under the Airy Triplicity (Viz.) Gemini, Aquarius, Libra,
must expect to have great Catastrophe to happen to them during the time that
Saturn and Jupiter makes their 10 Conjunction in the Fiery Trigon.

Of the Earthy Triplicity.
If the first Conjunction be in Taurus, many stately Palaces and curious
Structures, brave and Princely Monasteries, Noblemes Houses, admirable in
Architecture, and delightful in Situation, are Erected, Men wallow in Luxury
and Wantonness, great plenty of Corn, yet the Husbandman has but little
success in Cattle, the Murrain destroying his bigger Cattle, and the Rot, or
such like Disease, the lesser.

. In Virgo the effects materially fall upon Men, their Quality Kings and
Potentates, much afflictions, and great damages to all the Clergy in general;
nothing but Treachery among Men of all degrees; great Dearths.

. In Capricorn it portendeth a great variation in the Air and the Weather; it
argues a change of Government in those Churches or Countries under the Sign
Capricorn, and that Men shall be bewitched to a silly Superstition in Christian
Commonwealths; erects some Superstitious Orders of Friars, and affords them
large Possessions.

Of the Airy Triplicity.
. If the first Conjunction be in Gemini (as it has always been since the
Creation of the World) the Learned that then flourish, write more Words than
Matter, and endeavor with Logic and Philosophy to maintain dangerous
Positions, which should rather be concluded with Verity and Honesty; this is to
be understood in Divinity.

. In in Libra, Divines then living, handle Matters with great Profundity, and
their Works remain Famous to Succeeding Ages; likewise under this Cojunction
great-Actions are done in the World; if a Monarchy or Commonwealth is crected
under this Trigon, it endures very long, not so much supported with Arms, as
Wisdom.

*. If in Aquarius. Not only famous Men in Life, Learning and Couversation
arise, but also in Honesty, Integrity and Religion, from whence proceeds
excellent Schoolmen, Mathematicians, Astrologers, and Men learned in every kind
of Learning, do find great encouragement in the World.

Of the Watery Triplicity.
. If Saturn and Jupiter make their first Conjuction in Pisces, Reformation of
Church and Men is talked of, and much expected, its long in agitation,
unwillingly prosecuted, a General Council among Christians, Novel Opinions vex
the Church, things done now, continue not a whole Age.

. If in Scorpio, now follow Wars and Bloodshed, and Pestilential Diseases; the
Church full of Faction; ill Government follows; Lying Spirits have Licenses to
make the Prophets Preach Untruths, and the Rise of some untoward Heresy that
shall trouble the whole World. Under such a Conjunction Mahomet had his Rise.

. If in Cancer, the common People make some gentle Commotion, or desire to have
some Reformation in Religion, and rather than sail, they crave help of the
Nobility, by whose means they obtain their desires with Moderation, and without
blows; all things go on in a loving way, unless Mars at that time be unluckily
in Libra, and then nothing but Change of Opinion, Newfound Tenets in the
Church, and what not: Those Families, Citys and Commonwealths that had their
Rise in Virgo, Taurus, Capricorn, find great Catastrophe falling upon them.

Thus have Authors write concerning the Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter
through the sour Triplicities, but they mean when a great Conjunction happens
to be in any of those Signs which can never be in all of them, for there cannot
be a great Conjunction in neither Aries nor Leo of the Fiery Triplicity, nor in
Cancer, nor Scotpio of the Watery, nor in Libra and Aquarius of the Airy, nor in
Taurus and Capricorn of the Earthy; but I conceive the former Aphorisms to be
general: Now as the great Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter have always been
in Sagitarius, the mean Conjunctions are always those that fall upon the
Change, out of one Triplicity into another, that is, when Saturn and Jupiter
have made all their Conjunctions in the Fiery Triplicity, and they come to make
their first Conjunction in the Earthy, which has always been in Virgo, this we
call a mean Conjunction, and such a Conjunction happens once in 199 Years;
but the great Conjunction hapdeneth but once in 794 years, and those which we
call lesser Conjunctions are they which happen once in 20 years.

Now forasmuch as a great Conjunction happens but once in 794 years;
therefore is the Influence of that Conjunction of the greatest force, and does
continue the longest of all of them (viz.) 794 years until they come to be
conjoined in the same Triplicity; now according to the good or evil Positions
of the rest of the Planets, and the strength of the Planets conjoined, is a
Judgment drawn.

Likewise is the mean Conjunction of great force, for that happening but once
in 199 years, does also continue their influence until the end of that, and
about the middle of that time is the influence at the highest, and afterward
will it decline. Now are we not far from the middle of the influence of such a
Conjunction, at which time there does fall a Triple Conjunction of Saturn and
Jupiter in Leo, the first falling about the middle of October; the second about
the latter end of January 1682/3, and the last falls about the beginning of May
1683, which Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter will never pass over without
prodigious Effects to all Europe in general; for at the firs time they are
conjoined, Mars is found in Virgo, and the July before the Sun Lord of the
Conjunction suffered and Eclipse in Leo, his own House not far from the place
of the Conjunction of Jupiter and Mars September 6 1682; and the Conjunction of
Saturn and Mars September 11th. 1682, and it is not far elongated from the
Conjucction of Saturn and Jupiter October. 1682, at which time Mercury will be in
Scorpio in Quartile to both Saturn and Jupiter, all these Positions are very
remarkable, and without all doubt will have great Influence upon all those
places under Leo and Virgo; as also under Aquarius, Pisces, Scorpio and Taurus;
neither shall Aries and Gemini be free for those Countries; under Aries this
Conjunction falls in their 6th, and tells them they will go nigh to be affected
with a Plague, the more because Mars Lord of their Ascendant is in the 6th also
at the time of the Conjunction; and the second time they are conjoined (viz.)
January 1683 Mars will be in Libra in Opposition to their Ascendant, and in
Quartile to their 10, this does declare that they shall as well be afflicted
with a War as a Plague, and does likewise declare, that the Great Ones of those
Nations under Aries shall have a great deal of Trouble and Losses; nay, and
some of those of the greater Rank and Quality shall resign to Death, to the
sorrow of that Nation, but more of that when I come to treat of that
Conjunction wholly.

CHAP. III. Of the Great Conjunction Anno 1603.
FOR to erect a Figure for the time of this Conjunction, would be too great a
Curiosity for any to attempt, seeing their Motions are so slow, and it is a
matter of Question, whether all former Observations of the Ancients are to a
minute, from whence all Tables are framed, and should they but err one minute
in Saturn's place, it would cause near 8 hours difference in time, and from
this very reason cannot there be any certainty of setting of a Figure for the
time of their Conjunction, therefore it will be convenient that a Figure be set
for the Full Moon following, which fell on the day that Sir Christopher Heydon
made Observation which fell on December 7th 1603, at 21 H. 26 M. P.m. for which
time the following Figure was set.

A Figure of Heaven for the time of the Full Moon after the Conjunction 1603,
Decamber 7. at 21* h. 26 min. 51. 31 P M.



From which may be conjectured the effects that are like to follow this
Conjunction for 200 Years, in which time there will be great Changes in the
whole World, and in particular to Europe in general.

That which is most Observable, is this Great Conjunction (contrary to the
usual Order and Custom) happened before the full Period, Vide Edling.
and complete Revolution of the preceding Triplicity, as if the Effects
depending hereon should by the Ordination of the Almighty, be sooner manifested
to the World, than from natural Causes could otherwise have been predicted.

And seeing the Nature and Property of this Triplicity (by the general consent
of the Learned) is diametrically contrary to the former, it may be rationally
conjectured, that the more eminent Changes and Alterations are likely to happen
ever the effects thereof be at a full Period, undoubtedly there will be a great
Suppression (if not a total Subversion) of some Ancient Monarchys, Kingdoms and
Commonwealths, with an Alteration of their Laws, Customs and Privileges, and
also of some Ancient Families who had their first Foundation under Gemini,
Virgo or Pisces, and in their rooms new ones erected, which shall continue till
some contrary Configurations of Heaven do produce their Dissolution; as for
Example, the Saxons entered Britain 479 Years after Christ, or soon after, 8
Years before that there was a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Gemini, and
9 Years after the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Sagitarius, 809 their
Heptarchy was reduced to a Monarchy, and 8 or 9 Years after the first
Conjunction in the Earthy Triplicity in Virgo, it being in Square both to
Gemini and Sagitarius, at which time the Danes began their Monarchy, and the
next time Saturn and Jupiter came in Conjunction in Virgo, which was 50 Years
after; then came the Narmans; and upon this Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter
in Sagitarius 1603; then came Scotlands King to be King of all England,
Scotland and Ireland; and thus you see all beginnings as to those Grand
Affairs, has had their end upon Conjunctions in Signs of a contrary nature.

So many Planets posited in the Sign of the Conjunction (separating and
applying) considering also that the Conjunctions of Mars the Year following,
first with Saturn, and then with Jupiter, both near the place of the great
Conjunction, and in Opposition of the Ascendant of London, these may induce us
to conceive that some more than ordinary effects are to be signified by this
return of the Superiors into the Fiery Triplicity, Vide Edling.
I say, more than perhaps has usually happened from any, or most of those that
have preceeded since the Creation of the World; and that amongst other places,
London, and generally the whole Nation is herein concerned; thus much Mr.
Edling, and there is hardly any living but what are sensible of the truth of
these Predictions.

But there is yet many more notable Transactions to happen in the World from
the effects of this great Conjunction; for bycorporeal or double bodied Signs
do signify or operate most upon Men, and those of the Highest Rank (viz.)
Kings and Magistrates, and Rulers of Kingdoms or Commonwealths, therefore the
effects will be found to operate both upon Matters and Persons of both Church
and State, and seeing that whatsoever had its Rise from any Eminent
Configuration of the Superior Bodies, must also expect to receive a great
Suppression and Molestation from its contrary, and it is the Opinion of Spineus
in his Catastrophe mundi, that as Mahomet had his Rise from the Influence of
the Watery Trigon, so from the effects of this Restitution of the Superiors in
this Fiery Trygon, it being diametrically opposite to the Watery, shall that
Religion receive great batement and molestation; and in page 25 of that Book,
from the Influence of this Conjunction, Mahomet shall be destroyed, then shall
follow an Universal Peace, and a general Empire of Christians, or the Faith of
Christ more enlarged throughout the World. Thus much Spineus.

But before all these things be completed, the Christians shall be at Wars one
with another, and shall give encouragement to the Grand Turk to invade Europe,
and he shall pass through all Germany, and France and Italy, and part of Spain,
almost to the ruining of all Christendom, after which he shall by the Divine
Power of God turn Christian, after which he shall destroy the Dregs of the
Church of Rome, and shall settle a General Peace throughout the known parts of
the World.

Neither is the Judgment of Mr. Lilly upon this Conjunction to be slighted
(viz.) That God will restrain Monarchical Pomp, and reduce all to an
Aristocratical Mediocrity both in Church and Sat, but before this be effected
Omnia nutu unius regentur, as Cardan long since Predicted, after which God will
give so long a Peace, and such Tranquillity to the Earth, as she never enjoyed
the like. In the mean time (says he) as Saturn, Jupiter and Mercury in the
Scheme are in the 12th. I conceive, that privately by Lies, by Treachery, by
seigned and dissembling Treaties and Ambassadors, and by the Policy of a
Jesuitical Faction all over Europe, the True Protestant Religion shall
infinitely be distressed, and the Heavenly Intentions impedited; and all those
Countries that profess that Opinion, shall be exceedingly molested by so secret
a Compact of Villains and false hearted Traitors, lurking in the bosom of
Princes, as that many will think Popery and Papism shall return to its old Seat
in every Country; but that will never be in our Kingdoms, for Jupiter being in
his Chief House cannot but in fine overcome, and the rather, because he
receives the Sun and Mercury in the Ascendant, which show God will miraculously
by the means of some young Prince or Commonalty of People discover and bring to
light the close Mysteries of those Plots that from the year 1603 until almost
50 years be expired shall involve all Christendom in most bloody Broils, nay
till the year 1699.

CHAP. IV. Of the effects of the New Star, Anno 1604.
ANno 1604, about the beginning of October, this Star was observed first to
appear in the Heavens, in or near 17 degrees of Sagitarius, having of near 2
degrees of North Latitude, and as to its Magnitude; Ricciolus and others say,
it was bigger then Jupiter or Venus, according to its apparent Diameter, and
visible quantity; it is agreed by all Astronomers in those days, that the
Apparent Magnitude was more than any of the Fixed Stars; and by reason of its
having no sensible Paralax (by the consent of all Astronomers) shows it to be
situated among the Fixed Stars, far above the Planetary Orbs, and had no motion
at all in longitude and latitude, as the Planets and other wandering Comes
usually have.

In Form it was exactly round, casting no Hair or Tail constantly to one place,
but more like to the Order and Apparent Custom of the other Fixed Stars; it
appeared with a most clear twinkling and shooting of Beams on every side, and
that with such glistering and sudden brandishing, as has not been usually seen
or observed to be in the Heavens among the Stars, the Color was very variable,
like to a many Angled Diamond, by which turning the Sun Beams upon the eyes of
the Beholders will reflect with a variable brightness; so from a bright yellow,
anon it became croceal, and in a moment like a Purple and reddish, and many
times it did appear white, and with a most pure twinkling light.

Its continuance was above a Year, even till the Month of February 1605/6, and
constantly in the same part of the Heavens as to its longitude in the
Ecliptic, and it had its first Appearance near the time of the Conjunction of
Saturn and Mars, as may be seen by the Figure of the Full Moon preceding.

1604 September 27 day, at 14 h. 22 m. P. M. a ad E.



The Places of the Planets (ex Ephem. Orig.) at the Lunation preceding the
first Appearance of this Star. This Star appeared visible near five Hendred
days, therefore it will be five Hundred years before the full effects of this
New Star be fulfilled.

It is here needless to trouble my self or Reader, with the various Opinions of
the Learned, about the Matter and Generation of Comets or. New Stars; but as to
its place, it being so near the place of the Great Conjunction, and the place
of the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars the Year follow that also, being near the
great Conjunction, from whence we may learn that there is extraordinary events
that must ensue from this last return of the Superiors into the Fiery Trigon,
from its magnitude, distance, stability, etc. is the greatness, quality and
duration of the effects declared, and by its habit to the Sun, and the
direction the time thereof in general.

But seeing that this New Star was occidental of the Sun, and so appeared not
till after Sunset, and by the Doctrine of Ptolomy, the effects thereof must
not be expected to be manifested so-suddenly to the World, as if it had Rise
before the Sun; but as the Sun did approach nearer and nearer, and so by
degrees and for some time, did obscure the Light of the Star; so will the
effects be obscured or retarded for a time, or till excited by subsequent
Configurations; yet so as it must operate with the Conjunction, because it was
so near the Ascendant thereof, that is near the place thereof the Conjunction.
it self was oriental of the Sun, and so might denote some sudden Changes to
happen in the World; and after Saturn and Jupiter were separated one from the
other, and were about making their several Conjunctions with Mars, then did
this Star appear occidental, near to the place of the great Conjunction,
denoting at length, and even before the effects of this Conjunction are
completed, must there be some eminent, and more than ordinary Changes to
happen to the World; yet very little hitherto has been taught by the Ancients,
concerning the effects of these, or such like Prodigies of this Nature, so that
we cannot attain so exactly to the particular events; only this we may
conclude, that extraordinary Causes will have extraordinary Effects, and that
from Astrological Principles, and Grounds of Nature.

Spineus says, that about that part of Heaven in which a Mock-Star appears,
shall a Man arise which in show shall resemble Gold. And Cardanus tell us,
Segm. 2. Aph. 204. Comets appearing in the East do signify the Birth of a.
Great Man who shall be a Maker or Giver of Laws: and in Segm. 3. Aph. 117.
immovable Comets do signify Seditions, and being in the Fiery Trigon it
excites to Wars; Commotions and Conflagrations to happen in the World, the
rather because this Mock-Star was of a Mars-like color. Yet seeing at length
it appeared of a more bright or jovial color, Spineus will have it, that after
there has been such Wars, Sedition, burnings of Towns and Citys, and great
slaughters of Mankind, then it should signify the Kingdom of Peace. Any one
may conclude with him, that there will be great Changes of Laws and Customs,
destruction to diverse States and Monarchies, beyond what could be signified
from the Great Conjunction, for else why was it visible so near the place and
time thereof: That which is worth taking notice of, is that during the
appearance of this New Star, all the Planets came in Conjunction with it.
Besides, it was not only elevated above the Planets in the Conjunction, both in
respect of its Latitude from the Eccliptick and Situation, or distance from the
Earth, but also exceeded all the Planets in Magnitude and Light.

And considering that all the Planets, except the Moon, are under the Earth,
and Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, and the New-star are in the Fourth House, without
doubt it will be long before the effects will show themselves fully to the
World, and because the first Appearance thereof was so near the Conjunction of
Saturn and Jupiter with Mars, and all nigh the place of the great Conjunction,
and the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1663. Therefore the effects thereof
have in abundant measure showed themselves this last 20 Years, and shall show
themselves more and more during the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the
Fiery Trigon; and for the better understanding when the effects will be most
manifest, I have directed the New Star and all the Planets in the Figure of the
Full Moon preceding the Appearance thereof (which may give satisfaction to any
one that please to consider them) to the Year 1702; as for Example, In the year
1666 the Sun came to the New-Star, and the Moon to the Opposition of the said
Star, and then was London burned. London is under Gemini, and the Opposition
fell in Gemini also

I shall conclude with the words of Spineus in his Catastrophe mundi, where he
says, Take heed all you Kings of Spain and France, you Princes and Potentates
of Italy, behold and dread the Sign that is sent down from God. (viz.) the
Mock-Star of the Year 1604. let down in the Fiery Triplicity to provoke Wars
and Conflicts, (by 7 Aph. 34.) Rebellions, Treasons, Desolations, so that all
Men living shall be naturally inclined to shedding of blood, for every
immoderate Co^stitution of the Stars, brings Death amongst old and infirm
People, but in others violent events, and cruel destruction of young men, or
their utter ruin.

Oh! how many Changes of Kingdoms. Oh! how much lamenting and bewailing the
condition of disgrace! Oh! what sorts and difference of dangers and troubles
are to be feared? what unspeakable great and grievous Villainies? Oh! what
turbulent and damnable Seditions? Oh! what unlooked and unhoped for mischievous
kinds of death? Oh! what exalting of wicked and reprobate Men, the troubled
Stars of Heaven do belch out? Oh! what wretched and indigent Persons are every
where extolled, and the rich oppressed and impoverished? How many Subjects and
Servants shall rule whilst Kings and Masters shall obey. What Princes shall be
thrown out of their Dominions? Oh! what insolent, Drunken and Luxurious Men,
who shall have the Habit of Whoredom? What inventers of new and unheard of
Lusts, Buggeries, Gluttons, Murderers, Cruel, Deceivers, and Traitors, and
Thieves (without cause) such as shall deride, torment, and tear in pieces, and
kill with very vexation, all Men that be endued with Prudence, Knowledge and
Wisdom, but they shall be of a constant mind; and although these things shall
be fierce after the year 1630, yea more fierce after 1650; yet shall they be
most terrible and rigorous after the year 1660: God divert the evil that is yet
further portended from the effects of this New Star from the Kingdom of
England, for since the Year 1660 there has been a great deal of this
production come to pass, and a great deal more there is behind, which not only
England, but France and Spain, and Italy, and Germany, Holland, Scotland, and
almost all the whole World, in one measure or other, within this 20 years will
be sensible of, (viz.) Wars, Plagues, Famine and cruel destruction of Mankind,
with the burning of Towns and Citys. And so much may serve or the Judgment of
the New Star,

CHAP. V. Of the Comet that appeared Anno 1618.
OF this Comet has Mr. Lilly treated of in his Prophetical Merlin, therefore I
shall not undertake to write my Judgment thereon, because the Effects are
already past, only write down the Ephemeris thereof, and the Figure of the Full
Moon following, that from thence and the effects that be past, we may be able
to find out a true measure of time for such like Prodigies, which cannot be
done without Examples; for the Ancients have given us but very little light
therein.

The Comet first appeared about the 11 day, but was not seen by every one till

By this Table you may perceive the Cause of all the Troubles which happened
from 1640, to 1648. is fore-shewed by the Comet 1618. with other
Configurations; I shall proceed to the Conjunction, 1623.

CHAP. VI. Of the lesser Conjunction, Anno 1623.
OF this Conjunction I shall not take any great notice, seeing the effects
extended but to the following 20 years, only take notice, that soon after this
Conjunction King James died, and King Charles the First, whose Ascendant was
the Sign of the Conjunction, came by rightful Succession to the Crown: there
was also several years of great Drought and Scarcity, and a most furious
Plague; and seeing also that such like evils succeed the great Conjunction
1603, especially that great Plague in England 1605. Mr. Cambden observes, that
Saturn cannot (or seldom does pass through the Fiery Triplicity, but he does
afflict London with a Plague, or some other Epidemical Disease, of which I will
give a few Examples: Anno Domini 1348 Saturn was in Aries, an Universal Plague
in London: 1485 Saturn in Sagitarius a Sweating Sickness in London: 1507 Saturn
in Leo, another Sweating Sickness in London: 1517 Saturn in Sagitarius, the
third Sweating Sickness in London: 1530 Saturn in Aries, the fourth Sweating
Sickness in London: 1544 Saturn in Sagitarius, a great Plague in London, which
adjourned the Term to St. Albans: 1564 Saturn in Leo, the Plague in London
after the return of the Army from New Haven: 1594 Saturn was in Leo, a great
Plague in London, which caused the Term to be again holden at St. Albans: 1603
Saturn was in Sagitarius when that great Plague began in London which devoured
so many thousands; one thousand six hundred and 25 Saturn was in Leo when that
other great Plague began in Londonn which removed the Parliament to Oxford:
1633 and 1634, and 1635, Saturn was in Sagitarius when the Plague raged in so
many parts of England: 1665 Saturn had but newly entered Capricorn, when the
great Plague of all was in London; and truly I fear another great Plague in
London before Saturn has passed quite through Leo 1683, the more, because Mars
makes his Conjunction with Jupiter on the 6th. of September in 12 degrees of
Leo, and on the 11th. day of the same Month, Mars meets with a Conjunction of
Saturn in the 16 degrees of the same Sign Leo, and on the 17 day of October
Saturn and Jupiter make their Conjunction in 19 degrees of the same Sign Leo;
but that is not all, for on or about the 19th. day of January following, the
same Planet Saturn and Jupiter make their second Conjunction in 18 degrees of
Leo, and near the 10 day of May 1683, they make their third Conjunction in 16
degrees of Leo, in the very place of the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars the
September before; all these things make me to conjecture that we shall have
another great Plague ever Saturn has passed quite through Leo, and not only
that, but a many more great Calamities to a great many places of Europe, but
more of that in its proper place.

CHAP. VI. Of the lesser Conjunction, Anno 1641/3.
THis Conjunction, according to the usual Order of the Superiors, should have
been in Aries, and so have made their third Conjunction in the Fiery
Triplicity: but contrarily it happened in Pisces, which is a Sign of the ^ast
Triplicity, so that after two Conjunctions made in the Fiery Trigon, this
preposterously comes in to finish the Period of the last Triplicity.

And indeed the effects was of as contrary a Nature, as any one may see that
please to read the Anuals of those times, (viz.) from 43 to 1663. for was there
not a suppressing and abrogating of former Laws, Religion, Customs,
Privileges, and Government; if any one do but consider the Malevolent
Consiguration of the Planets, at the time of the Conjunction, may from thence
Judge from the Rules of Astrology, that this Conjunction was the forerunner
of much faction: but seeing Mr. Lilly in his Prophetical Merline, has handled
that Conjunction very well; I shall say no more of it, but have to that which
is more useful for our purpose.

CHAP. VII. Of the Comet that appeared, Anno. 1652.
IN the year 1652, December the 9. was the first time that this Comet was
observed by Instrument, although it did appear two or three days before, nor
could it be seen every night, so as to observe it. It was visible about 23
days, but was observed but 14 days, as by the Ephemeries of the Comet appears.

Mr. Lilly, and Mr. Edling, does allow a year for a day of the Comet's
appearance, then this Comet should continue its effects till 1675. but here I
allow a year for all the days it was seen, and that was but 14, and at the end
of 14 years, there did appear 3 more Comets, this Comet has been treated of by
Mr. Lilly in his Almanac 1654. and Mr. Edling in his Treatise of the
Conjunction 1663. and therefore I shall forbear to write my Judgment thereon,
only note thus much, that upon the 19 day of December, the Comet came to be in
Trine with Jupiter; that being the 9 time that the Comet had been observed; for
these 9 days I do allow 9 years, which being added to 1651, makes 1660, in that
very year did the King come in, the reason I add it 51, is because the first
day serves for the year it appeared in, and again upon the 30 day, the Comet
came in Opposition io the Moon, and to the place of the New Star, 1672. that
being the 14 day that the Comet was observed, which 14 years being added to
1651, brings us to 1665, in that year was London affticted with a great Plague,
and the year after, London was burnt, the reason (that this Comet should show
so much evil to fall upon London) it had its first appearance in Gemini, the
Ascendant of London in Opposition to the great Conjunction, 1603. and New Star,
1604. and in that year also did Mars in the great Conjunction 1603. come to the
place of the Conjunicton of Saturn and Jupiter it self.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Conjunction. Anno. 1663.
THis Conjunction is very learnedly Treated of by Mr. Edlin, in his
Prae-Nuncius Sidereus; therefore I shall forbear to write much of it, only
take notice of some Material things, for the better informing of the young
Artists in the Judging of such like Conjunctions, and seeing it is altogether
impossible to get the Figure of the Conjunction exactly, as is very well noted
by Mr. Edlin, the Motion of Saturn and Jupiter being so slow, therefore I have
set two Figures, one for the Full-Moon before and one for the New Mood
following the said Conjunction. That which is to be noted in these 1663. October.
6th day at 8 h 6 P. M. a London.

1663 October 20th at 10 h 56 P. M. a London.

two Figures is, that all the Planets, the Moon excepted, are under the Earth;
which was very well noted by Mr. Edlin, that the Material signification of this
Conjunction should lie obscure for a time, and not break out until the latter
part of the time determined for the Influence thereof: yet it may be inquired
(if the Influence of this Conjunction should not break out till the latter end
of the 19 years from the time of this Conjunction) from what natural Causes was
it that we in England had a War in 1665, 1666, and 1667. Also a Plague in 1665.
the burning of London, 1666. and a many more Material Accidents that has
happened in the World soon after this Conjunction; to this I answer, that the
Principal natural Cause that did foreshew the Plague, was the Comet that
appeared 1652. in Gemini, as was very well noted by Mr. Lilly, in his Anglicus,
1654. his words are these, London, said he, is more concerned by this Comets
Influence or Portents, than the effects of mere Calamities of a Plague or
Sickness upon Man, or Death of her Inhabitants; assuredly said he, there have
not been greater changes in the World, in general, or any City in particular,
then will happen in the City of London, before 1672. 2 great part, if not the
greatest Catastrophe this Comet designs, being to fix upon that City in the
end; thus much Mr. Lilly, of the Comet 1652. who is he that is alive, that is
not sensible of the truth of this prediction? But were it possible to get the
exact time of any Conjunction, there might be a sure way found out, as to the
measure of time, when any Accident should happen, by directing the Ascendant
and Midhaven, allowing the time between Ascendant and Ascendant, to be the
measure of time for the 20 years, that falls between Conjunction and
Conjunction: but seeing that is altogether impossible, we will use the same
Method for the Full-Moon, preceding this Conjunction, and the Full-Moon
precending the Conjunction 1682. By which meant there will be 52 (...) of time
allowed for the measure of time, for one whole, year to find which, you must
substrast the time of the Sign Ascending the Full-Moon preceding the
Conjunction 1663. from the time answering to the Sign Ascending the Full-Moon
preceding the Conjunction 1682. and that difference of time divide by 20
years, and the Quotia^ will be the measure of time for a yean. As

For Example.

In the Full-Moon, preceding the Conjunction, 1663, is Gemini 26 51. to which
answers in the Latitude of London, 21 h. 33 and in the Full-Moon, preceding
the Conjunction 1682. Capricorn 11.0. to which answers 14 h. 58 of time in the
Latitude of London, now by reason substraction cannot be made, and 24 h. H. H.
H. 14 58 with 24 added is. 38 58 from which substract 21 33 the difference of
time is 17 25 which being turned into Minutes is 1045. that being divided by 20
gives 52 15 for the measure of time for a year, and according to the Nature of
those Aspects, as the Ascendant and Midhaven meets with, such shall the
Accidents be, the speculum of the direction from 1663 to 1683.

This way of directing the Ascendant and Midhaven, will find out both the Time
and Quality of the effects, the Conjunction does signify the place, also if
the position of the Aspect at the time of the Conjunction be considered, as for
Example, in the year 1672. the Ascendant met with the Quartile of the place of
the Sun and Moon, in the Figure of the Full-Moon, 1603. and the Quartile of the
Sun and Moon, at the Full-Moon, before the appearance of the Comet, 1652. now
the square of both fell in Virgo, now the places under Virgo are Silesa, and
several other places belonging to Germany, in this year did France enter
Germany, and has made great devastation upon the Rhyne, and the Moon is the
Gubernator of Holland, and the Ascendant meeting with the Quartile of the Moon,
and did not Holland that year feel the smart of War also, and in the year 1673.
the Ascendant met with the Body of Mars, and the M. C. to the Quartile of Mars,
the Quartile fell. in 69. and the Body of Mars in Libra: Alsatia and Austria
are under Libra, with a many more places: and ever since these Places have selt
the like Calamity for some years. A many more Examples might be produced, but
by reason this Conjunction is at an end, and a more remarkable one approaching;
I shall rest silent as to that, and haste to that which is more Material to our
purpose: only note thus much, that Mars at the time of the sellebration of
this Conjunction, was in or near 9 Degrees of Leo, the very Cusp of the 12th,
the Full-Moon preceding, the appearance of the New Star, 1604, which Stars
place, fell near the place of the Conjunction, 1663, and Mars also was Lord of
the 9th in that Figure, and was placed in the 3d. of the Full-Moon, preceding
the Conjunction 1663. and in the New Mood following Mars, is placed in the
Ascendant; from hence should all the Actions of this last past 19 years, be
wholly of the Nature of Mars, (viz.) Wars, House-burning, and Plagues, and
seeing he is Lord of the 9th. of the Appearance of the New Star 1604 and 4th
also, this does, show that all his Actions should be under a show of Religion.

CHAP. IX. Of the Comets that Appeared 1664, and 1665, and that of 1671, and
1680, and 1682.
THat which did follow the Conjunction that was Material, was the two great
Comets, the first was observed by Mr. Hevelins of Dantzick, to appear on the 14
day of December, 1664 and he sinished his Observations of that Comet on the
12th day of February, 1665. the Ephemeris of which Comet, as Hevelins observed,
is as follows, as I had it from my very good Friend Mr. John Colsen.

Appeared on the 2d. of March 1671/2 and he observed it to Appear about the
beginning of Aries, and on the 21st day of March it was in the beginning of
Gemini, and was seen no more. The Table following is as I had it from a very

There has also been another Comet seen on the 23d and 24th of April 1677, but
by reason of its short a continuance; there could not be any considerable
observations made thereof, but only I observe, it was not far from the place of
Saturn and near to Meduses head, there was likewise a third Comet seen in the
Year 1665. but I could never get an Ephemeris thereof, the first Comet that was
seen in the Year 1664 was by all that observed it to be a Saturnal Comet,
(viz.) of a Saturnal color, and the Comet 1665. was of the nature of Mars, and
the Comet 1671/1, was of the nature of Saturn and Mercury, and the Comet 1680,
was of the nature of Saturn, and so is this last Comet that appeared 1682. I
would have the young Artist take notice that this last Comet had its beginning
about the middle of Cancer, but was not begun to be observed till it was entered
into Leo, and it has been observed to enter Scorpio before its disappearance.

CHAP. X. Of the Probable effects that attend these Comets in General.
COmets has always been known to be the Antecedents of Tragical Events, and
Astrologers have endeavored to give us Rules to Judge the Quality thereof.
First, By its motion in the Sign of the Zodiac, whether it be. Direct or
Retrograde. Secondly, By its Magnitude and Color, and Thirdld by the part of
Heaven, unto which their Stream does point; I shall say but little of the
Comets 1664, and 1665. Nor of the Comet 1671/2. Most if not all the evil that
was presignified by them, being all bypast, for had we not a devouring Plague,
1665. As also a War with Dutch and French: and in the year 1666. was not London
almost destroyed by Fire, had we not also an Invasion by the Dutch in Kent, and
sustained great loss by them, besides the great Calamity a great many more
parts of Europe had about those times; and after the appearance of the Comet,
1671/2 had we not a great Scarcity in the North Parts of England, as also a War
with the Hollander? Did not the French and English Invade Holland, to the loss
of a great many Men and Towns? And has not that War been prejudicial to Germany
ever since? who is he that is not sensible of the many brave Towns that has
been destroyed by that War, to the undoing of a many thousand Families?

And what Man is he that dare presume to say that Comets are not the
Premonisher to Men-kind, of some more than ordinary Judgment to fall upon them
for their sins? But such has been the secury of our Ages, that unless the
Judgment falls upon them, so soon as these Signs of Heaven appear, they cannot
be made to believe that those Signs signify any thing at all: but let those
rest themselves (as they believe) secure, but let them remember that security
dwell next door to destruction. For should any one have said to any of those
People, dwelling upon the Ryne, in Alsatio, in the year 1670. that they should
have so many of their Towns destroyed by a Foreign Invador, they would hardly
a believed you, but did rest themselves as secure as we or any one could do,
but this by the by, the Comets of whose effects we have had little or no many
festation as yet, is the Comet that appeared 1680 and the Comet that appeared
the while we were a Writing hereof: Now the Comet that appeared 1680 did first
appear in the Morning on the 7th day of November in or near 6 degrees of Libra, but
was not seen to any purpose till it appeared in Caprieorn, and did continually
appear until it had moved into Taurus, and near the 20 degrees thereof it
disappeared. Now Authors tell us that the Motion of a Comet out of one Sign
into another does manifest also an Hostile Motion of an Enemy from one Region
or Country into another. Now by these Comets (viz.) 1680, and 1682, manifests
the beginning of more Wars, and the sorrowful effects subsequent unto those
Wars. (viz.) the flight of many from their proper habitations, banishment of
others, death of great Men of the World, poverty and want to others, sudden
terror or astonishment to all sorrs of people, unushal. Tempests, obscure
Weather, many Shipwracks, great store of Snow in its Season, great Floods and
mighty Inundations, and forasmuch as both the heads of these Comers was of a
Saturn Color, from whence may be expected Plagnes and Famine to a great many
places; great Frost and Snow.

Now as to principal places that is like to be sufferers in these calamities,
are those places that both these Comets passed through, and those places that
are under those Signs that Rise all the time that both these Comets was
visible, now the Comet in 1680 passed through Libra, Scorpio, Sagitary,
Capricorn, Aquaries, and Pisces, Aries, Taurus, now while the Comet passed
through Scorpio and Sagitary, it was so near the Sun that it could not be seen
there, for those places are the least concerned in the effects of this Comet.

And during the time of this Comets appearing every Evening, Cancer and Leo did
Ascend, therefore those places under those Signs must expect to have a great
share, if not the greatest of the Calamity that this Comet does signify.

Under Libra are Austria, Alsatia, Livonia, Sabandia, Delphinat, Dastrina,
Caspia, Thebaida, Sundgova, Cities, Lysbon, Friburgh, Spiers, Frankford, upon
Menc, Halum, Suenorum, Heilbran, Frising, Vienna in Austria, Antwerp. Under
Scorpio, Norway, Bavaria, Matagony, Catalonia, Cities, Algiers, Valentia in
Spain, Messana, Vienna, in Holland; Gaunt, in Flanders, Frankford upon Odor.

Sagitary, Spain, Dalmatia, Sclavonia, Hungaria, Moravia, Misnia, Cities;
Toledo, Studgard, Rotenburg, Buda, Gascovis.

Capricorn, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Mascovia, Lituania, Saxony,
Hussia, Cities; Oxford, Mechlin, Berga, Brandenburg, Vilna.

Aquares, Muscovia, Sweadland, Westphalia, Mosel, Piemont, Bavaria, part
Cities, Hamburgh, Bremc, Trent, Salizburgh, Ingolstaec.

Pisces, Portugal, Galitia, Normandy, Cities, Alexandria, Hispolis, Rhemes,
Vorines, Rutisponc.

Under Aries are, England, France, Germany, Selesia, the Highest Polonia, part
Burgundy, Denmark, Cities, Naples, Capua, Ferrara, Utrecht, Crackow.

Taurus, Russia, Sweadland, North part; Lorraign, Franconia, Ireland, Cities;
Banonia, Mantua, Nants, Leipsig. Some of which Countries, the War is already
apparent, what is remaining, the next 20 years will make manifest.

Neither can it be expected that any of the places should undergo all the
Calamities that this Comet is the premonisher of: some places shall suffer by
War, others by Plagues; others by Famine; for the Comet will opperate variously
upon various places.

When this Comet first appeared, it appeared in the very places of Mars, in the
great Conjunction, 1603. and Mars at the time of the Comets appearance: was in
Virgo, in Quartile to the Sun, in that Conjunction, hence may War be expected:
Mars is Lord of the grand Seigniors Nativity, and he afflicts Sagitary, and
Gemini, and Pisces; therefore those places will be the first that suffers by
War, and that by the great Turk; the last Comet that appeared, had its
beginning about the middle of Cancer, and passed through Cancer, Leo, Virgo,
Libra, and ended in Scorpio, and during of this Comets appearing in the
Evening, Aries did ascend, therefore those places under that Sign, shall be the
greatest sharers in the Calamities that this Comet does foreshew, (viz.) Wars,
Plagues, and scarcity of Grain, and the like, when this Comet first appeared,
it did appear near the place Saturn, of the first appearance of the Comet 1680.
therefore shall this Comet have saturnal effects unto those places under Cancer
and Aries, those places under Cancer shall be subject to great Inundations, and
those under Aries, Plagues and Wars, the Comets having so swift a motion
through those Signs it appeared in, does denote the siddainness of the action
that shall follow, and for as much that it did not set at its first appearance,
therefore are these Northern parts of Europe, most concerned in the effects
thereof, among which places, let Scotland beware, I also fear London will be
sensible of the effects of this Comet, and before the year 1683. be quite over,
I fear a great Plague, from which good Lord deliver us; for all those places
are concerned in the effects of this Comet where it was visible, if we will
partake of the Sins, we must partake of the Punishment; I pray God keep the
people of England in peace.

The New Moon following the appearance of this Comet, we shall find Capricorn
ascending, and Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury in the 7th House, and the Comet,
and the Sun and Moon, in the 8th, the Comets being in the 8th, should show a
Mortality to those people under Capricorn and Cancer: but the principal
signification of this Comet declares War, the destruction of Cities, the ruin
and downfall of Kingdoms, the slaughters of Mankind, and a many other tragical
evils, experience confirmed by many Ages, and from thence observed, does inform
us, that the Comets seen in the Air have evident effects, but for the better
informing of those that are curious inquirers into the nature of Comets, I have
Incerted a Catalogue of all the Comets that has appeared since the coming of
Christ.

passed through Libra, Virgo, Leo, Gemini, and ended in Taurus, and was of a
Saturn color, and had a Retrograde Motion. Anno 1665 A Comet appeared in April
in Pisces, and moved direct through Pisces, Aries, and ended in Taurus. Anno
1671/2 A Comet appeared in February in the Sign Aries, and passed through
Aries, Taurus, and had ended in the beginning of Gemini. Anno 1677 A Comet
appeared on the 23d. of April in the Sign Taurus. Anno 1680 A Comet appeared in
Libra, and passed through Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius, Capricorn, Aquarius,
Pisces, Aries, and ended in Taurus, near the place of the Comet 1677. Anno 1682
A Comet appeared in Cancer about the 14th day of August, and passed through
Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, and ended in Scorpio, in Opposition to the ending of
the two last Comets.
Any one that has a mind to be versed in the Quality of the events of Comets,
must look back into History, and he shall inform his Judgment very much; yet
for the instruction of the young Artist, I shall recite a few Examples which I
hope will not be taken amiss.

1402 The Comet that appeared then was the forerunner of Tamberlain's entrance
into Asia, calling himself the Wrath of God, and the destruction of the Earth,
kills 200000 Turks, takes Bajazet Prisoner, binds him with Fetters of Gold, and
put him in an Iron Cage, and carrys him Captive through all Asia, making him a
Footstool when he ascended his Horse.

That which followed the Comet 1520 that passed through Cancer, Leo and Virgo,
was no less than 404 Parishes drowned by an Inundation, with all their People
and Cattle. The Turks take Buday in Hungary.

That which followed the Comet 1558, was the death of Emperor Charles V. and 3
Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Dukes, 15 Cardinals; besides a many more pety Princes and
one Pope.

That which followed the Comet 1559, was a great Famine in Austria, Swavia,
Bohemia, Bavaria, Russia, Lituania; also a very great Inundation in Flanders
and Holland, no less than 400000 People besides Cattle.

And that which followed the Comet 1618, the long War in Germany by the
Bohemians; the death of the Emperor and Queen Ann, with a many more eminent
Mutations in all parts of Europe, and so much shall serve at this time for the
Judgment of these Comets.

CHAP. XI. The Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, October 1682. Astrologically
handled.
THis Conjunction which we are now to handle, happens to be the fourth
Conjunction since their last entrance into this Triplicity; the first being in
the Year 1603, already handled in the Discourse going before. And forasmuch as
this Conjunction falls in the Regal Sign Leo, of the fiery Triplicity, and
being the fourth Conjunction they have made therein, which Conjunction 1603
being the seventh return into this Triplicity, since the Creation of the World,
and that this Conjunction in Leo being thrice repeated, will therefore produce
eminent effects; and seeing it being a thing impossible to get the true time of
the Conjunctions themselves, we must content our selves with the times of the
New and Full Moons before and after the Conjunction; the first Conjunction
happens about the 17th. day of October 1682; the second Conjunction happens
on or about the 20th. of January 1682/3, and the 3d. and last falls about the
10th. of May 1683, according to the Caroline Tables of Thomas Street, the full
Moon before the Celebration of this Conjunction falls on the 6th. day of
October at 1 h. 33 m. P.m. and the New Moon following falls on the 20th. day of
October at 1 h. 41 P.m. the Figures of Heaven are as follow.

Full Moon October. 6. at 1 H. 35 P. M. latt 51.32.

New Moom Oct. 20. at 1 H. 41 P. M. latt 51.32.



Now Authors tell us that if Saturn and Jupiter be conjoined in Leo, there
should be some sturdy Prince that should trouble all his Confederates, and that
all Princes should grow ravenous, and exercise Tyranny over their Subjects, and
shall endeavor to make himself great by undirect means, but in the height of
all his greatness vanishes by sudden death, or is much molested by his
Vassals, leaving his Posterity in a very unsettled condition; for although this
Trigon breeds valiant Men, yet they are extremely unfortunate, and those evils
that have a beginning under the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Leo are
fixed for a long time; for every Prince does vainly conceit himself to be the
only Alexander, but their Pride and Vainglory shall bring themselves and
Posterity to a State much worse than their beginning.

This last Conjunction we had in Leo, was that which happened in the Year 1623,
and that was followed with the Death of King James 1625, and a great Plague,
and we have cause to fear the approach of another great Plague in the Year
1683, from which good Lord deliver us; for if we do but consider the position
of Heaven the Full Moon preceding this Conjunction, you will find that Mars
Lord of the 10th. in the 8th. House, in Quartile to Mercury in the great
Conjunction, and the Sun Lord of the 8th. is in Quartile to the Sign Ascending,
and the Conjunction it self is not far from the 8th. House: these things make
me to judge that we have a Plague very near us, and a very great one, and that
before 1683 be over; but I dare not be too positive in such determinations, but
when I consider the Conjunction it self, I find it to fall in the sixth of
those places that have Aries for their Ascendant, and in the 4th. of those that
have Gemini, therefore let those beware, for they are threatened with no less
than a Mortality, and that a great one, which God in his Mercy divert.

For a preparative to this great Conjunction, we have the Sun Ecclipsed upon
the 24th. day of July, at which time Mars Lord of the 7th. was in the 10th. in
Quartile to the Sign Ascending, the Eclips falls not far in longated form, the
place of this Conjunction (viz.) in or about 11 degrees of Leo, Junctinus tells
us, that when the Sun is eclipsed in the Fiery Triplicity, denotes the
Banishment of some Great Person, with discord and hatred between the People and
some great Ruler or Governor; many repinings, grudgings and dissentions,
Motions of Armies, much War and slaughter of Mankind, burning of Houses,
depopulations of many Countries and Citys, very Pestilent Diseases, the Eclips
it self f^ll in the 10th. therefore it will chiefly concern those that are
Rulers and Covernours of Towns and Citys.

The next thing that helps to usher in this Conjunction is the Conjunction of
Tory Mars with Jupiter, as if he did intend to poysen Justice with a hasty,
choleric humor, and cause those whose places is to act prudently, to act like
Madmen, as if they did endeavor to set all in an uproar; Mars naturally, as
he is posited in Leo, does represent Men of a daring Spirit, hectoring and
bouncing, governed too much by their own will, and delighting much in
quarrelling, and can hear of nothing that will please them so much as Wars and
Battles, and his being in Conjunction with Jupiter makes him have a great show
of Religion with all his actions. Let those places under Leo look to it, for
they are principally concerned; yet those places under Aquarius and Scorpio,
and Taurus, will have a great share in these kind of actions; I pray God bless
the Kingdom of Ireland from unruly actions, for they are under Taurus, and this
Conjunction, and all the Conjunctions in Leo are in Quartile to that Sign.

Upon the 11th day of September 1682, there was a Conjunction of Saturn and
Mars, in or about the 16 degrees of Leo: this Conjunction on of Saturn and Mars
falls near the place of the last of the three Conjunctions of Saturn and
Jupiter May the 10th. 1683, from whence may be expected great Alterations as to
Mundane Affairs; Mars I find in the Conjunction to be elevated above Saturn,
having more North latitude than Saturn, and Saturn being very weak, therefore
has Mars more power than Saturn; therefore what is chiefly signified by the
Conjunction of Saturn and Mars will be wholly Martial; Now if the Ottoman
Family had their Rise under the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Scorpio,
as is verily believed it did, then that People shall afflict a great part of
Christendom, for he has lately, or will very shortly, change his Aphelion into
Virgo, which does show, that those People shall move out of their own Country,
in way of Conquest, and shall continue so doing for some years to come, even
till they have made themselves Masters of great part of Christendom.

It we consider the quality of Saturn in this Conjunction of Saturn and Mars,
we shall find Saturn to be very weak, for Leo is Saturn detriment, and is just
like a man that is an Enemy to his own House and Family, and one that should
seek to destroy his Posterity. Saturn generally is the cause of Matters
Political and Civil, all subtle and Politic Councils, deceitful, private and
cunning Stratagems, covetousness, self ends, destruction to some Ancient Family
and Building, as to Laws, Liberties, Customs and Privileges, depopulations.
And this he does signify in Political Matters.

In Ecclesiastical Affairs he portends great Superstition, Idolatry,
Hypocrisy, Monkery, Jesuitism, and all the several Orders of the Church of
Rome, and he does signify all manner of Debauchery and Baseness under
Religious Pretenses; all manner of Sects, Schisms, Heresies, Jewish
Superstitions and Ceremonies.

Unto Mankind in general he threatens great and difficult labor, poverty and
want to many; he afflicts the Body with tedious Infirmities and Diseases, as
the Consumption in the Reins and inward parts; ill and noisome Vapors, from
whence proceed a Plague, Hectic Fevers, destruction of Rheum, Quartan Agues,
and such like Diseases, as are not easily remedied by the most Skilful
Physician; he afflicts the Mind with sorrow, and fear of lamentable trouble, as
also Banishment and long imprisonments.

And as to natural things, he portends great want and scarcity, destruction of
Cattle, Corn and Fruits; Famine and Mortality; unwholesome Airs, cold, cloudy,
misty, soggy Weather, and long and tedious Frosts.

As to the Sea, he signifies Shipwreck, and great damage by ruin and decay of
Sea banks, from whence comes great Inundation of Waters, great scarcity of Fish
and Fowl that belong to the Waters.

Of Persons, he signifies those of superior Rank and Quality, because he is
the highest of all the Planets, and moves the slowest, and he does seldom apply
to any Planet, therefore he signifies great Princes, and stable Monarchs; but
in the general he signifies the laborious Country men, Husbandmen, Farmers,
Yeomen, etc.

And in this Conjunction he signifies a deceitful, sordid, pernicious sort of
People who will inhabit in the Court of Princes and Kings, who will undermine
and subvert the more wholesome purposes intended; but I say all these sort of
People shall suffer great loss of their Estates, and shall obtain in the room
thereof unexpected Slaughters, Imprisonments, Banishments and the like.

The last time we had Mars in Conjunction of Saturn in Leo was the 10th. of
August 1650, the December following we had a Comet appeared, and I have good
reason to predict the appearance of more Comets before 1683 be over, let any
one but look into the Annals for 1653 and 1654, and they will find what
followed that Conjunction 1652, but seeing that the effects of this Conjunction
of Saturn and Mars, cannot last but for two years, and Mars being swift in
motion at the time of the Conjunction, even so shall all that is portended by
this Conjunction be as swift in motion (viz.) Armies shall run like Lightning
over a great many Countries of Europe, and shall bring more under subjection in
2 years, than any Armies have done for this ten years last past, and forasmuch
as Christianity was first preached by Christ our Savior under the Conjunction
of Saturn and Jupiter in Leo, and now Mars being in Conjunction in this Sign
with Saturn, and having of the greater power, will afflict Christianity with
the Sword more than ordinary. At the time of this famous Conjunction we find
Mars newly entered into Virgo, in Quartile to the great Conjunction 1603, and
moves but slowly from whence the evils signified by Mars to be of long
continuance, (viz.) War and Bloodshed, Virgo is held to be sign of the
Conjunction before the coming in of the Normans, and Mars has not been in
Virgo in neither of the Conjunctions since 1603, therefore may more than
ordinary events follow; the more because Mars before the second Conjunction of
Saturn and Jupiter, January 1682/3, will pass the Quartile of Saturn and
Jupiter 1603, and also the Quartile of Saturn, Jupiter and the New Star 1604,
and the Quartile of Sol and Venus, and the Opposition of the Moon 1603, and
comes to the Conjunction of his own place 1603, and all before Saturn and
Jupiter meets the second time; let but any one consider the position of Mars
the first time the two Superiors meet, and they will find cause enough to
dread the evils of Mars.

Now Mars being placed in the 9th. from the Conjunction 1603, and meeting with
the Quartile of Mercury Lord thereof first; all those places that are under the
gubernation of Mercury, will feel the smart of the influence of Mars; now
because Mercury is posited in Sagitarius in the great Conjunction, and Mars
casting his Square there, out of the 9th. of that Conjunction, those places
shall feel the heavy effect of Mars (viz.) Wars: now the places under
Sagitarius, are Spain, Dalmatia, Sclavonia, Hungary, Moravia, with abundance of
more Countries and Cities that are under the position of Sagitarius for their
Ascendant; these places must expect to have great Calamity; some of them shall
suffer by Invasion; others by Plague; others by Famine, and a great destruction
of Mankind in general: Mereury generally signifies all manner of Arts and
Sciences, as also Merchants; these sorts of Men must expect to be great
sufferers by the power of Mars, (viz.) great Storms, from whence comes great
Shipwracks. Mercury and Gemini govern Flanders, part of England and Lumbardy,
Brabant, the Dukedom of Wertenburgh, London, Corduha in Spain, Bruges in
Flanders, Mentz, and a many more places, that are not yet attributed to Gemini;
in these places may expect to have Commotions; for Mars is the stirrer up of
Wars, damnable Seditions, Tumults, Insurrections, the frowns and indignation of
Princes toward their Subjects caused by Mars, he being Lord of the 11th. and
12th. of the great Conjunction 1603, and is placed near the Cusp of the 10th.
of that Conjunction, he does by the Positions represent Noblemen that should be
in great favor of Princes, but are great enemies of the People in general; if
we place Gemini upon the Cusp of the Ascendant, we shall find the Tory Mars to
be placed in fifth in Quartile to the Sign Ascending, he being Lord of the
12th. and in his last Conjunction with Jupiter in Leo, he opposed the 10th.
what can we expect from hence, but that Mars should act like a Tory as he is
among the Stars, setting all together by the Ears, and that now publicly in
those places under Gemini, and he will be as well rewarded for his pains; for
Mars is placed in the Eighth the House of Death, of the Full Moon preceding the
Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1682; if we place Aries upon the Ascendant,
we shall find both the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars, and Jupiter, and Mars
and Jupiter fall all of them in the 6th. in Quartile to the intercepted Sign
Taurus in the Ascendant, and the Sun Lord of the 6th. having lately suffered an
Eclipse in the 6th. all these will cause both the great and small Cattle to
suffer by Diseases, to the detriment of the Country Farmer that lives in those
Countries subject to the Sign Aries, the more because Mars is in Quartile to the
second, if we consider the place where Mars casts his Opposition, we shall
find it to be in Pisces, and Pisces is assigned by Astrologers to govern
Portugal, Galitia, Normandy, with the Citys of Rhems, Worms and Ratisbon, and
many more places, this hateful Opposition of Mars will cause in those places
great corruptions of their Fruits by impetuous blasts, and likewise will
destroy their Grain, causing a great scarcity thereby: He will cause great heat
and drought, and will exclte men's minds to great rashness, and to all manner of
evil, and likewise cause great dissension among Kindred; as for Virgo, the
place where Mars is at the time of the first Conjunction, are attribute to
govern Achaia, Greece, Athens, Mesopotamia, Babylon, Assyria, part of the
Rhyne, Silesia the lower; of Citys Jerusalem, Rhodes, Navar in Italy, Paris,
Lions, Basil, Heydleberg, Erphord, these are the chief places under the
dominion of unfortunate Mercury, and therefore must expect to meet with such
like misfortunes as are of the nature of Mars, among which Paris is like to
suffer by notorious Frauds, Cheats, Mutinies, Tumults, and most horrid
Villainies, and secret Conspiracies; nay more than that I fear another Massacre,
or some such unruly actions; and thus much for the general judgment of Mars,
during the time that he is in Virgo; but if we consider the second Conjunction
of Saturn and Jupiter; we shall find Mars then placed in Libra, and he does
continue 226 days in that Sign, and does stay but 53 days in Virgo, therefore
those places that are under Libra, Aries, Cancer, and Capricorn shall have a
longer time of suffering than those places that are under Virgo, Pisces, Gemini
and Sagitarius, because Mars makes such a swift passage through Virgo. Those
places under Libra are Austria, Alsatia, Livonia, Citys Lisbon, Fribourg,
Spiers, Frankford at Mane, Vienna in Austria, Antwerp, and a many more places,
not as yet allotted to this Sign; in these places will Mars power down his
Influence, which will be of the nature as before recited. Now during the time
that he passes through Libra, he will cast his hateful Opposition to Aries, as
if he did intend nothing but fire and sword to those places under Aries, but he
will not be able to do the mischief he intends, because he is in his detriment,
and the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter does behold the Sign Aries with a
Trine, yet nevertheless they must have their share of the effect of Mars, being
in Opposition to their Sign. The ingenious Anton in Satyr 5. has these verses
of the Qualities of Mars.

Blood, Death, and Tragic Stories, Mars does yield
A Golgotha of Graves, whose purple field
Died Crimson with his fatal Massacres,
Craves Bloody Ink, and Scarlet Characters.
A Pen that like a Bullets force would reel
A Marble Conscience. --
And this shall suffice for the Judgment of Mars in all the three Conjunctions.
Now let us consider the Conjunction it self. We find it falls in Leo, not far
enlongated from that famous fixed Star, called the Lions. Heart, which Star is
of the nature of Mars: We are advised by those that have been learned in this
Study, to take the Fortitudes and Debill^udes of all the Planets; both the Full
Moon going before this Conjunction, and the New Moon following; by which means
we shall find which is the strongest of them all, and he we must account to
have the greatest share of the effects. Now having considered, I find Saturn
and Jupiter to be equally fortified, and they two to be the strongest of all
the rest, both of them at the Full Moon having of 27 Testimonies of strength,
all the rest having of but few, Saturn we find to have no Essential Dignities,
and Jupiter to have but Triplicity.

The Declination of Saturn and Jupiter, is above 18 degrees North, at the time
of the Conjunction, by which means they have a great Diurnal Arch, and by that
means continue above 15 hours above the Horizon, between Rising and Setting;
therefore will these Northern parts be subject the more to their effects; for
by how much a Star does make the longer stay above the Horizon, by so much more
is he fitted by those his direct beams, to make a stronger impression of his
virtue over or upon those parts, and seeing that not only the places
particularly subject to the Dominion of the Sign wherein the Conjunction
happens, but also the Triplicity and Quadrangle thereto belonging according to
Ptolomy. Now the Triplicity Aries, Leo, Sagitarius, are said by most Authors to
operate most upon the Christians, and according to the opinion of Cardane the
Roman Empire, which if true, then by the declination of the Planets, the
Northern and North-East parts of Europe, will be the most principal places
designed for the operation of the effects of this Conjunction.

Now under the sign of this Conjunction, viz. Leo are Gallia Togata, the Alps,
Italy, Sicily, Apulia, Bohemia, Turkey part: Cities Rome, Damasco, Ravenna,
Cremona, Prague. Now all of these places shall feel in one kind or other, the
smart of this Conjunction.

Those eminent Persons who have the Sign Leo, ascending at their Nativity, and
near the Degrees of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, will be the Persons
most active in carrying on the affairs of those places wherein they live, but
by reason there is a Conjunction of Saturn and Mars near the same Degrees, and
near the same time (viz.) a Month before this, I say, will fling those Persons
into many Perils and Dangers, both to their Body by health, and Estate; and
those Persons that have this Conjunction in Quartile, or Opposition, to their
Degree, ascending at Birth, will be much afflicted with Sickness and Crosses;
and those that have the Conjunction in Quartile, or Opposition of their Degree
of their tenth or, or will find great Crosses as to Honor and Reputation; but
on the contrary, all those Persons that have the Conjunction in Trine, or
Sextile, to their Degree ascending, or to the Degree of their tenth or, or part
of Fortune, shall all of them enjoy health, and gain great Reputation and
Wealth; during the time of the Conjunction, the Operation, which is worth our
observation, is the New Moon before the second Conjunction, (viz.) the 17th day
of January, the Sun suffers an Eclipse near the cusp of the 9th, with the
Dragons-tail, and Saturn and Jupiter are in Opposition to both the Sun and
Moon: Now Saturn is Lord of the 7th, 8th, and 9th, and the Moon being Lady of
the Ascendant, and the Sun Lord of the second: Now the Ascendant does represent
the common sort of People, and the second the moveable wealth; therefore must
the common People suffer both in Body and Estate. Authors tell us that when the
Sun suffers an Eclipse in the first decade of Aquarius, it is the Forerunner
of public sorrow and mourning to those of the highest Rank and Quality, but
not so to the poor Husbandman, and by reason it falls so near the 9th, it shows
detriment to Religion, and all things relating to the 9th, and the Full Moon
following of this Conjunction, the Moon suffers an Eclipse in the 23d Degree of
Leo, near both the Conjunction, and that famous fixed Star Cor Leonis; and the
same Author tell us that if that Luna suffer an Eclipse in the third decade of
Leo, it declares the discontentedness of the people in general, and that they
should be desirous of new Laws and Governors.

If the Ascendant of an Eclipse does represent the common People, then is
Cancer the Sign, and the Moon their signification, and Saturn being Lord of the
8th. is in Opposition to the Moon, from hence may be conjectured the Death of
the vulgar sort of People, by a Plague or some such kind of Diseases; and in
the Full Moon following the Conjunction, the Sun is Lord of the Ascendant, and
is placed in the 8th. in a dejected condition, and Saturn is Lord of the 8th.
House, and in the Ascendant; from this Eclipse also may be predicted the Death
of the common sort of people by Sickness; neither will the Governors of Towns
and Cities escape Death; for Mars Lord of the 10th. of the Lunar Eclipses
following the Conjunction, January 1682/3, is placed in the 4th. in Opposition
to the 10th. in a very weak condition, from whence their Death shall come
through their own means.

If we consider the Sun Lord of the Conjunction, at the time of the
Conjunction, October 1682. which according to Mr. Street, falls on the 17th.
day, we shall find him placed in Scorpio, about 4 Degrees near the place of
Mercury, at the appearance of the New Star 1604, this does declare that the
Great of the Earth (viz.) Emperors, Kings, Princes, and chief Governors,
should adhere to the Counsel of those men that endeavor to destroy both them
and themselves, for although Mercury may be accounted for one that has wit,
yet being placed in Scorpio, at the appearance of that New Star shows him to be
but of little honesty, and Mercury also being in Scorpio, at the time of this
Conjunction in Quartile, to the Conjunction it self, and do dispose of Mars
also, from whence may be conjectured, that a cunning sort of People shall
endeavor to poison the wholesome Laws by bad Counsel, and fling the Governors
of Kingdoms, Towns, and Cities, into eminent danger of Destruction.

The first Aspect the Sun meets with after the Conjunction, that is of note, is
the Sextile of Mars; this will make those Persons signified by the Sun, to have
great trust in their Arms, Mars at the same time is in Quartile to the place of
the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1663, and to the Quartile of Saturn at
the appearance of the New Star 1604. I pray God in his mercy preserve the City
Gemini from being oppressed with the Sword and all Martial actions; the next
Aspect the Sun meets withal is the Quartile both of Saturn and Jupiter, this
according to natural causes should afflict those Persons, signified by Sol in
the Conjunction, with horror and amazement, and shall be in danger of their
Lives, Honor, and Estates, and be forced to fly for safeguard, for by bad
advice they shall attempt to do that which they shall never attain to, by which
means they shall bring themselves and fame to destruction for ever, for the Sun
is in a fixed Sign; let those Persons beware that have 10 or 11 degrees of Leo
Ascending, and Saturn 22 8 d. m. in Sagitarius, with the Sun 1.46 of Scorpio, I
say let those Persons beware, for they have lately had the Sun Lord of their
Ascendant, Eclipsed upon the very degree Ascending.

And there has been also a Conjunction of Jupiter and Mars upon the very degree
Ascending, and a Conjuction of Saturn and Mars not far from the degree thereof,
all these bring great sorrow and Tribulation to these Natives then born, and to
help forward, they have their mid-haven by direction to the Opposition of
Saturn, this destroys the Honor and Reputation of all those Persons aforesaid,
if they be a Tradesman he cracks his Credit, and is in danger of a Prison, he
will likewise be in danger of being brought to public Justice for some
treasonable practice that he has committed, and if there be a Prince in Europe
that was born under such a position of Heaven, he shall go nigh to be in danger
of his Life, by the wrath and Indignation of the common sort of Pople; in short
they will bend all their forces against him, and will reduce him to an Estate
far below his Birth; the Opposition falls in Gemini, therefore let such Persons
beware of committing of Crimes in those places under Gemini, for if they do
they must expect to come to public Justice let them think themselves never so
secure.

The King of France is thought to have about 22 degrees of Scorpio, Ascending
in his Nativity, if so then is this Conjunction in Quartile to his Ascendant,
this will cause that mighty Monarch to be afflicted in his Body with Sickness
if not Death.

Norway is under Scorpio, the house of Mars, where Mercury is unhappily
posited, and the Conjunction it self casting a Square thereto, this show the
great misfortunes these People are like to endure by War, Uproars, Tumults,
Shipwreck, if not a great want of Grane.

Taurus, the Opposite Sign, is the Ascendant of Ireland, Poland, and the North
part of Sweedland, the Conjunction casts it is Square to it also, from whence
those places may expect to have a great Mortality, because Taurus is upon the
Cusp of the 4th. and Saturn and Jupiter both casting their Square from the Cusp
of the 8th. and if we place Taurus upon the Ascendant, then will the
Conjunction fall in their 5th, and that does betoken Abortive Births, and some
more than ordinary Monstrous Productions, and that there should be many
Treaties, Embassies and Messages for Peace, all which are signified by the 5th.
House.

Italy in general, and Rome in particular, are under Leo, the Sign in which
this triple Conjunction falls, therefore will they be sensible in a high nature
of the influence of this Conjunction; it denotes to them great Droughts and
Barrenness of the Earth; as also, great Plagues they are threatened with, great
Calamity by Fire, the Sword, Uproars, Tumults, Murders, Grievous Contentions
and Quarrelling, and deposition of many Noble Princes and Rulers from their
Honors and Dignities, without hope of restitution; Death and Destruction to
others, Rome, many or most of them, these Enormities are threatened; then
certainly you Princes of Italy, and also the Roman Pontifex, or Conclave of
Cardinals of the Sea of Rome, will all of you find great and most grievous
Distempers in your Government, and so will many People and Nations be subject
to the Fiery Triplicity. There shall also be great Rents and Schisms amongst
the Religious Orders of Monks, Friars, Jesuits* so likewise shall there be
amongst those of different Judgments, call them by what name you please; in the
figure of the Full Moon, preceding the first Conjunction, we find all the
Planets above the Earth, the Moon excepted, this does denote that what is
pretended by this Conjunction, will break out in a short time of the
Conjunction it self, upon the Cusp of the 10th. House, we find Scorpio and Mars
Lord thereof in the 8th. and the Conjunction is in Quartile to the very degree
thereof. Now the 10th. House signifies all Magistrates (viz.) Kings, Princes,
Governors of Towns and Cities, (viz.) Majors, Bailiffs, all Captains and
Conductors in War, likewise all Justices of the Peace, all these shall find
great trouble in their place and Office, some of them shall exercise Tyranny
over them they are to rule, and by that means cause their Subjects to rebel,
and by that means bring themselves and posterity to great destruction, others
of them will act beyond their Legal Power, and by that means bring themselves
under the lash of the Law of the Country wherein they live, and shall end
their days by public Justice, others they will end their days by Plagues,
others will end their davs by Famine, and others by Gunshot: In short there
will be a great rout of such men, represented by the 10th. House.

Upon the Cusp of the 11th. House, we find Mars and Venus therein, and Mars
casting off his Square to Sagitarius out of the 8th. the House of death.

As to Kings and Rulers of Countries, the 11th. represents their Associates,
Counselors, Allies, their Treasure, Ammunition, Soldiery, now Mars being Lord
of the 10th, and being placed in the 8th. in Quartile, to the 11th. House, from
which may be conjectured, that the Princes of the Earth should grow very
ambitious, and shall wast their Estates by War.

If any one will be but pleased to inquire into History, they will find that
the Roman Empire had its rise under the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in
Scorpio, and that was 45 years before the coming of Christ, and by reason of
there being a triple Conjunction in the Sign Leo in Quartile to the Conjunction
that preceded the rise of that Empire, from whence may be expected great
calamity to befall that Empire, if not a final Catastrophe.

About the year 1331, began the Ottomon Family, and that was under the
Gubernation of a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Gemini. Now is this
Conjunction in Leo 1682, in Sextil to that Conjunction preceding the Rise of
the Ottoman Family, this shall cause that Monarch to thrive much, besides he at
this time has very good directions in his Nativity; and forasmuch as the
Conjunction favors that mighty Prince, and afflicts the Roman Empire;
therefore may it be conjectured that he shall dismember the Roman Empire of
some of his Territories; and shall continue so doing for some years.

If we consider the 9th. there we find Libra 21 degrees, and the Sun in the 9th
in his fall opposed by the Moon Lady of the 7th. and Venus Lady of the 9th. has
lately been in Quartile of Mars.

The 9th. signifies Religion, Pilgrimage, long Journeys or Voyages, Ceremonies,
Sacrifices, Faith, Clergymen of all Sorts, Arts, and Sciences, the Law, it
also signifies learning in general, and all Church livings.

That which is worth our taking notice of is the Comet that was seen in the
Year 1680. when it came to be visible over all Europe, it was in Quartile to
the degree of the 9th. as if the beginning of trouble should fall upon matters
of Faith, from whence may be conjectured that there shall be great persecution
to those that are of a contrary opinion, to those that are established by
authority, even to the undoing of many thousands, this Comet had its first
appearance not far from the degrees of the 9th. and therefore all matters
relating to the 9th. must suffer during the time of this Conjunction Operation,
and for as much as the Comet was in Opposition of Saturn, when it appeared
December 1680. shall there be great wrangling and great fewds, both about
matters of Law, as of Divinity.

If the Ascendant represent the vulgar sort of people, then does the 2d. House
signify their wealth, upon which we find Aquarius and the Dragons-Tail not far
from thence, and both Saturn and Jupiter are in Opposition to the second also.

Now the second House signifies Riches, Estate, Goods of Fortune, Money,
Plate, Houshold-slust, Corn, Jewels, and is the proper personal estate of any
man. Now this Conjunction falling in Opposition to the second House, signifies
there should be but small buying and selling, and as little enriching ones
Estate. Notwithstanding, many shall much desire it. I cannot but judge, from
hence the sudden undoing of many a man by Rapine, Thievery, Taxes legal or
illegal, there will great impoverishment to the Estates and Inheritance of the
Nobility, to the Clergy, to the Gentleman, to the Lawyer and the industrious
Merchant, and to the Yeomen, and hard laboring Farmer, the Diurnal operating
Labourer, the Curious or Idle Mechanic, the Collier, Tinker, and the most
sordid of all Professions, except the Hangman. To the Merchant I divine great
loss by Piracies, Shipwracks, and by broken Crediters, or Bankrupt Debtors: I
cannot imagine by this Conjunction, being in Oppositon to the second, who, or
what kind of man, or of what Nature and Profession he shall be of, that in
these Turbulent Times (as these are like to be for some years after the first
Conjunction) shall either thrive or keep his own: And forasmuch as the second
House has a fixed Sign on it, and the Conjunction it self in a fixed Sign
also, so shall be the means whereby men shall be impoverished. He that is rich
to day, is not certain to abound to morrow, he that kept Servants this month,
may be a Servant or a Slave himself the next. An Universal Poverty in Estate,
in Cattle, Corn, and what not; a time uncomfortable I see, for some succeeding
years, bad to all, good to few.

If the tenth signifies Kings in general, you shall find Mars but in a dejected
condition, in the 8th. and worst of all, he is in Quartile to the 11th. that
signifies the support of Princes.

With what difficulty, labor, and discontent, shall the Grandees of the World
have to supply their necessary disbursments for part of the years allotted to
the conclusion of this Conjunction: In the next place if we make Jupiter the
general Significator of the Nobility, Gentry, Episcopacy, Lawyers, Prelacy is
from Jupiter, Munkery from Saturn; so that Cloisters of Friars, as well as
Benefices of Bishops, will smart, and come short of their Revenues.

If you will know by whom this shall be, Mars being Lord of the 10th. points
Authority and strong-hand by the Soldiers, the Dragons-tail denotes vulgar
Persons, Clowns, day-labourers, Vagabond fellows, their own Tenants as forward
as any body, for what either the Soldier Regal commands, or Magistracy leaves
the Peasant, will in time lay hold of the rest. Guido Bonatus tells us, that if
Jupiter be corporeally joined to Saturn, men do their actions silently clocking
all their actions with Religion, with an appearance of Fidelity and Observation
of the commands of Justice, shall this Age be pestered; with such sort of these
men that shall pretend Justice and Law and rob men of their Rights and Estates,
it will be so.

Procus in Ptol. 71. fol. Tells us that an Artist is not satisfied in knowing
whether the thing signified by a Conjunction, be good or bad, unless he know
the Propriety or Quality (viz.) what manner of thing shall be good or evil, in
the figure of the Full Moon preceding this Conjunction Saturn and Jupiter, has
the greatest prerogative, and according to Cardanus Sig 4. Apho. 21. When two
Planets rule, the Judgment shall be mixed and taken from them both, but when
the Lord of the figure is joined with him, or to either, he shall obtain
principal Dominion. Actions signified by Saturn and Jupiter, shall give us the
most eminent directions in our Judgment. I say then Saturn for his part,
according to Escuidus fol. 13. has signification to some matters already begun
to Sects mutation, in the course of Worldly Kingdoms, and whatever may require
long time ere it be finished; Saturn denotes much decay in Trade, and Tillage,
and Husbandry, much loss to those that deal in Minerals, and so in Coal-Mines,
Tin or Lead, for it is probable, either the Banks shall fall in, or else be
over-flown with water, it also denotes, that they shall have more Damps than
formerly, which shall destroy a great many of the Workmen, also great
destruction to Fruits produced, or growing out of the Earth, or hindrance in
such Commodities that are got out of the Bowels of the Earth, many Towns and
curious buildings shall be levelled with the ground, for the Conjunction is in
Quartile to the 4th. House, a general Tribulation amongst all men, the Prisons
full of People, hundreds of People undone by unjust and irregularities of
proceeding of some Men in authority, extreme perplexities afflicting the minds
most Men, many desirous, but few shall be able to preserve a competency to
subsist with all, and according to Ptol. in 2. Quadripart. fol. 99. there shall
be great scarcity of grain, penury and great wast, or want of those things, are
most necessary for our Food and living, it makes a Dearth and Scarcity of
Beast, Oxen, Horses and Sheep, and so contaminates the remainder left behind
alive, that it breeds contagion in those that eat or use them, At Sea commonly
Shipwracks and cruel Storms succeeds, hard Passages or evil Voyages for the
Merchant. It pollutes the Body of Man with daily Diseases, Consumptions, dry
Coughs, Molestation of the Humors, Fluxes, Quartan-Agues, Banishment by
violence, great Poverty, Perplexities, Mournings, Fears possesses the
generality of Mankind; troubled Ayrs, thick Clouds, Darkness, plentiful Frost
and Snow, in the year 948. there was a Conjunction in Saturn and Jupiter in
Leo, and during the influence of this Conjunction, there was such thick Clouds,
that for six Months together, the Sun nor Moon did not shine, it was in the
year of our Lord 966. It denotes also a very cold Season, unseasonable Mists
and Fogs, many Apparitions in the Air, the color of the Elements changed, the
Skies many times varying from the former, had sights of Armed Men, People in
the night extremely frighted with those like Visions, when these or the like
appear, or are more frequent than ordinary, (viz.) these strange alterations in
the Air, or in the Heavens; in what part of the Heavens these do arise, or
where they first appear, or over what part of Heaven they centinue longest let
those places expect vengeance sudcenly to follow or else why did they appear.

Rigel 87 Aphoris. tells us, Kindled vapors streaming through the Air, whether
in form of Comets or otherwise, points out hot Diseases of an acute quality; as
also Wars, and the dissentions of Kingdoms, but running here and there and
through all Parts, they demonstrate an universal evil; if the appearance be
more in one quarter of Heaven then another, in that especially shall the
extremity of the signification be manifest, and not long after that, Famine or
Scarcity.

If we consider the natural signification of Jupiter in this Conjunction, we
shall find according to the opinion of all Authors, that he signifies naturally
the Nobility of the best Rank and Quality, Judges of the Law, Bishops, and all
sorts of Clergymen; as also Cities and Towns, Corporations, Subjects,
Privileges, Courts of Justice obedience to Princes, Justice of Kings to their
Subjects, Laws, Statutes, Ordinances, Decrees; but in this Conjunction he
principally looks upon the Gentry, because he is Lord of the 11th. and in Leo,
the house of the Sun, and is not far from the Cusp of the 11th. from the 10th.
I say all these sorts of Men and things, must expect to suffer by this
Conjuction, because he is in Conjunction with this envious Planet Saturn, in
his detroment, and for as much as he is in Quartile to the Cusp of the 10th.
declares a desention between some Prince of Europe and his Gentry, the more
because near the time of the Conjunction the Sun is in Scorpio, a hasting to a
Quartile of the Conjunction it self.

All those Laws that was confirmed, or had their original under the influence
of the Conjunction in Aquares, the last time they were in the Airy Trygon, that
is to say from the year, 1226. to the year, 1245. or from the year 1285. to the
year 1307. or from the year 1344. to 1364. shall by the influence of Saturn and
Jupiter, now in Leo, be in danger of subversion and utter ruin, and all those
Towns that had their original, or Corporations granted about those times, shall
be undone and impoverished, and scarce have a face of Government, or else loose
both Town and Government at once, those Laws, those Constitutions, Courts of
Justice, Commonwealths, Kingdoms, Monerchies, Titles of Honor, or earthly
Families and Names that had their beginning about the aforesaid time, must
expect to have great trouble and molestation, if not a final disolution, during
the time allotted for this Conjunctions influence, and so much for the general
Judgment of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter.

CHAP. XII. Of the most Principal Times wherein the effects of this Conjunction
will be manifested.
THe method that I shall take to determine the time of the effects of this
Conjunction is by directions, transits, lesser Conjunctions and Aspects of the
Planets (especially of the Superiors) also Eclipses of the Luminaries and
Comets that has lately appeared, and does opperate with this Conjunction,
these do most certainly show the particular Times of the Events, all which as
may be most necessary and beneficial for the young Students, I shall handle,
not troubling him or my self with Niceties.

These in themselves are not only demonstrative, and most rationally to be
observed; but is also the Judgment of the Ancient and Modern Astrologians; as
may appear by these Aphorisms following.

Ludoe de Rig. Alph. 44. In English is thus, not only by the revolution of the
years of the World, or of a City, or of a Sect, may thou have the knowledge
of future events; but it behooves thee also to consider the directions of those
Radixes or beginnings.

And also in the 47 Aph. of the same Author, new evils are moved or stirred up
in a City, when the direction comes to the Quadrature or Opposition of the
Infortunes, which if they be Retrograde, the evil will be the worse.

The 245 Aph. of Anonim in English is thus, in great Conjunction of the
Superiors, use directions that thou may know the times of the grand
mutations of Cities, and Countries, and the 293 Aph. of the same Author he
advises us to use directions in the beginnings of Sect. that we may know the
accidents attending, which is to be understood in all other Radixes.

Many more Aphorisms might be produced to this purpose but I must hasten, note
what has been said of the directions, is also as true in Aspects and other
configurations, according to that of Cardaneus, not only the Conjunctions of
the Superiors; but also the Quadrate and Opposite Rays or Aspects do produce
great nutations in the World.

The method that I have used in directing of the great Conjunction 1603 and the
New-Star 1604. Is according to Kepler who directs all the Planets in the
Ecliptic, allowing the motion of a day for a year, and the Ascendant and
Mid-heaven of the Full-Moon after the Conjunction I have directed, allowing
four minutes of time for a year, the same method have I used in the Full-Moon,
preceding the New-Star 1604.

But the method that I have used in the lesser Conjunctions of Saturn and
Jupiter, is the same that we use in Revolutions of Nativities that is to allow
the time between the Ascendant of the Lunation preceding the Conjunction, and
the Ascendant of the Lunation of the Conjunction following, to be the measure
of time for the year between the two Conjunctions, let be 19 or 20 years, as
has been already showed in the Discourse before going, now follows the Judgment
of the several years his Conjunction is allowed to opperate.

SECT. I. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year 1683.
IN this year that has been so pointed at by the Ancients, the Ascendant of
the Conjunction 1603. comes to the Opposition of the Conjunction it self, and
the Mid-heaven to the Trine of Mars and Mercury; comes also to the Sextile of
the Sun and Trine of the Moon, and Sextile of Venus; these are notable
directions, and will have as motable accidents to attend them; the Opposition
of the Conjunction falls in Gemini, those places that are under that Sign,
shall find great alterations both in matter of Trade, much affliction to the
common People in general, a Plague or some Distemper as bad will destroy a
great part of their Inhabitants, all things goes cross with them, an
Insurrection is feared, the Magistrates grows Tyranical and prove unjust in
most of their Actions, the People grow weary of their Burdens, and are
inclinable to Rebellion, the Gentry of those Kingdoms under Gemini, are also
much afflicted both in their Body and Estate, some of them will suffer
Imprisonment, others Death, in short, a change may be expected this year in
those places under Gemini; we have also the Sun in the Figure of the New-Star
directed to the Quartile of Mars, Lord of the 4th. House, and the Sun is Lord
of the 12th. in that Figure now shall those Villainies that has lain hidden for
many years, break out, and show themselves in their proper Colors.

The Quartile falls in Capricorn, the Ascendant of Oxford, I pray God that City
may not be afflicted; the Heavens points something more then ordinary should
befall that place, and all the places under Capricorn and Cancer; for the Moon
meets with the Quartile of Mars in Cancer, her own House, also at the same
time: shall Holland be free from trouble? No; for Mars is a stirer up of
Sedition and War, a sudden fear will possess that people of another Invasion.
Likewise they shall suffer great losses by Inundation of Water; the Mid-heaven
of the New star meets with the Quartile of Mercury, the Quartile falls in Leo
upon the Cusp of the 12th. Now if the Mid-heaven Represents all Kings and
Magistrates, then those shall find great trouble in those Countries under Leo;
the 12th. is the 3d. from the 10th. (viz.) Kings and their Kindred shall
disagree, the New Star 1604. meets by direction the Quartile of Saturn and
Jupiter 1603. Now this New Star (by the consent of Ancients) is thought to be
the forerunner of an universal Monarch, that shall be upon the Earth, which can
never be without having a great deal of War and Bloodshed. First, therefore
shall this Quartile excite men's minds to War and Contention to the utter
Destruction of most of these Monarchs now in being, in those places under
Pisces where the Quartile falls, and Mars the place of the New Star and the
great conjunction, and Gemini the opposite sign, and Virgo the opposite sign
to the Quartile; will be the Places most subject to the effects of the
Directions.

In the year 1683 January. About the latter end, there is another Conjunction
of Saturn and Jupiter, and the New Moon before that the Sun suffer an Eclips
near the Cusp of the 9th. and Saturu and Jupiter both of them oppose the 9th.
also; this shows that Religion shall suffer much this year, and so shall the
Clergy in general; it does presage public forrow to the Gentry, or men of the
highest Rank, those places under Aquares, Leo, Scorpio and Taurus, will be
subject most to the effects of this Eclips, the Moon also suffers an Eclips on
the first of February, about three a clock in the afternoon, upon the Cusp of
the second House, in 23 Degrees of Leo; at which time Saturn and Jupiter are in
the Ascendant; this foreshews the loss of the great Cattle, (viz.) Horses and
Cows, because the Moon is Lady of the 12th. the Vulger People shall have great
losses as to their movables; for which they shall grow discontended, and shall
be desirous of changing of their Laws and Governors, in hopes thereby to
better themselves; there will be also a second Eclips of the Moon, on the 28th.
day of July, at eight in the morning, at which time the Sun, Saturn and
Jupiter, and Mercury, will all of them be in the 11th. and Mercury hasts to the
Quartile of Mars, the Eclips falls in the 5th. and does declare the ill success
of Ambassadors, the abortion of Women with Child, it also declares some
strange Catastrophe or change to happen in those places under Aquares; Leo,
Scorpio, and Taurus.

The many Oppositions of that Saturn and Jupiter meets withal a little before
their second Conjunction, January. Does deolare the unsettled condition of the
vulger People, and that they fear some great Calamity falling upon them,
whether a Plague or otherwise, let time declare about the beginning of May;
Saturn and Jupiter makes their last Conjunction in Leo, a little before which
the Sun meets with the Quartile of both Saturn and Jupiter, in or about 14
degrees of Taurus, this will afflict a very great Person of Europe, that has
Leo Ascending, it will fling him into a great many troubles, it threatens the
Death of some of his Children, loss of Honor and Esteem in the World.

London Repent and be humble; for God's angry Sword is almost drawn against
thee; if thou escape from a Plague in the year 1683. then will England be
happy, the many directions that fall this year, bring me to mind what Mr. Lilly
writ the year 1656. in Verse.

In the Year of Eighty Three,
Great changes there shall be,
In England, but long are that,
Poor Merline Sleeps
In his Grave secure, poor England weeps;
Left he no Heir, Oh! unhappy Man,
That this obscured Riddle can,
Unfold. -- No.
In this year 1683. the Comet that appeared in 1680. comes to the Quartile of
the Moon in Taurus, and the Quartile of Mercury 1604. the Comet having passed
through Capricorn, and now is entered Aquares.

The places subject to this Comets influence is Russia, they shall be much
afflicted with the Sword and Fire: Sweadland will go nigh to be at War with
their Neighbors, and shall suffer much by it; Lorraign, Holvetia, Franconia,
and a many more Countries in Germany shall suffer by War and Famine; their
People shall many of them dye by the Sword, now shall the Austerian Family be
much afflicted; for the Princes of Germany will be unfaithful to him, and by
their discention shall cause a Martial Prince to take advantage against him, to
the disadvantage of the Empire and the Death of many of the Inhabitants; if we
confider Marce's long Trancit through the Sign; we may predict that those Lands
under Aries will be great sufferers, that is, France, Germany, in general,
Polonia; Burgundy, Denmark and England, in France we may expect to hear of the
destruction of the Natives by treachery, if I mistake not my Judgment, there
will go nigh to be another Massacre if not timely prevented, the poor People
shall suffer for a time but not much longer; for the common People shall join
with some of his Nobles and shall cause a Rebellion in the very Bowels of
France before which be over, that Monarch shall repent his being ruled; by the
Church of Rome, in the persecuting of his Protestant Subjects; Flanders and
Brabant, and the Dukedom of Luxenburgh, shall find great trouble with
Soldiers, and the People of those places suffer very much; they shall be
forced to fly from their Habitations, they shall have their Houses burned by an
insulting Enemy: Italy, the Comet comes now in Opposition to this Ascendant,
thou may rest yet a little while in peace, but hardly tell the year 1683 be
over; this Country must expect to have but lean Crops of Corn, a great Plague
will rage in the City of Rome, and a Fire of War will go nigh to break out that
will not be quenched for some years, Austrea, Alsatia, Spain, Dalmatia,
Hungary, all of them will go nigh to suffer this year by barrenness of the
Earth, and searcity of Food, sit for the nourishment of Mankind, the
Hungarians are at the writing hereof in Arms against the Emperor, and have
joined with the Turks; they shall this year prosper in their War with the
Emperor, they shall gain all Hungary to themselves before 1683 be over.

In the Figure of the Full-Moon, preceding of this Conjunction, the Ascendant
meets with the Quartile of the Sun and Moon in Capricorn, the Sun is Lord of
the 8th. House, this does denote a mortality to those that live in those places
under Capricorn, that is, Macedonia, Albania, Greece, Muscovia, Cities, Oxford,
Gant in Flanders, Brandenburgh, the more because the Comet of 1680 passed
through Capricorn, and there met with the Opposition of Saturn Lord of the
Ascendant.

We likewise have the Mid-heaven by direction of the Conjunction 1682. to the
Quartile of Saturn and Jupiter and Quartile of Mars 1682. and to the
Conjunction 1683. these are worth our noting; for if the Mid-heaven represent
Kings and Princes, and all Magistrates that Govern Towns and Cities, then all
of these shall find great trouble and vexation in their Government; some of
them will be called to an account by their superiors, and go nigh to come to an
untimely end; other (viz.) Kings shall find their Subjects ready to rebel
against them, in short, all of them shall find great distempers in their
Government, the vulger People will be enraged against them for some thing that
they have acted against the Commons good.

SECT. II. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year 1684.
IN this Year Mars Lord of the 10th of the Full Moon, following the great
Conjunction 1603, is come by direction to the place of the Sun and Venus, and
to the Opposition of the Moon, the Sun is in Sagitarius, and so is Venus, and
the Opposition falls there also; this is like to be a Year of much Action as
well as the last; Mars as he is Lord of the 10th, Represents Generals of
Armies, Kings, Princes, Colonels, Serjant-Majors, Captains, and Governors of
Towns and Forts, and Soldiers in general; all these sort of Men shall find
great opposition by the Commonalty in general, there Actions will grow odious
to the sight of all Men, and will make them endeavor to mend themselves by a
means contrary to the former ways; the Sun discovers all the Villainies that has
been acted for some Years past, many of them are brought to public Justice
that has been the Actors; now the people begin to be unanimous in all their
proceeding (finding their former Error) against all those that has been the
Authors of the mischief; that which was Treason in the Year 1682 in some
Countries, will now be made none; the City Gemini will have a great share of
these proceedings. France forbear being so Bloody-minded, to Butcher thy
Natives, nay, thy very own Blood and Bones, but if thou will Dance that Dance
of a Massacre, thou will in less then Two Years pay the Piper with a Vengance,
for if thou will Feast in Blood, thou must be Repaid, and by those that has as
little Conscience as thy self; thou have been one cause of the Turks entering of
Europe, he will hardly return until he has endangered thy Crown, and thou will
repent when it is too late, for thy own Subjects will betray thee.

January the 3d there is an Opposition of Mars and Saturn, Saturn being in
Virgo, Mars in Pisces, and there is a notable Conjunction of Saturn and Mars,
October the 3d, in 13 degree of Virgo, this Conjunction of Saturn and Mars is
very remarkable, because it falls in Quartile to the very degrees of the
Conjunction of Saturn and Jubiter, 1663. and also in Quartile to the great
Conjunction 1603, and in Quartile to the new Star that appeared 1604, this
tells us, that if there he ever a Prince in Europe that has about 13 degrees
Ascending, he may this Year return to the ground from whence he was taken, this
Conjunction falls upon the King of France, as 10th of his Nativity, this
destroys his former Honor; a very strange Rebellion in France in a short time
after this Conjunction. Spain will have cause to Curse her Counselors, her
losses are like to be very great, both by Sea and Land, in those Countries
where there is Armies a Foot, there shall be great slaughter of Mankind; there
is no less then Four Eclips this Year, the First is of the Sun on the 6th of
January, in 26 degrees. of Capricorn, not visiable; the Second is of the Moon on
the 17th of June, in 6 degrees of Capricorn; the Third is of the Sun of July
the 2d, in 22 degrees of Cancer; the last is of the Moon December the 11th, in
4 degrees of Cancer; these three last are all visible; Authors tell us, that
these Eclipses in Capricorn are the prodormus of Scarcity, and the motion of a
King or great Person in a tumultuous way, and that Men should be given to
slander one another, and signifies, that a great Person, or man of Eminency,
should come to an ill end, and the Eclipses in Cancer excites men's minds to War
and Treachery, and Seditions, and threatens men with small Pox, Dropsy, pains
in the Stomach, Consumption; and those places under Cancer and Capricorn will
be the places subject to the effect of the Eclipse.

SECT. 3. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year 1685.
IN this year the mid-heaven of the Conjunction comes by direction to the
Sextile of Mercury, and the new Star comes by direction to the Quartile of the
great Conjunction 1603; and Jupiter also comes to the Quartile of the great
Conjunction, much about this time; these are also notable directions, and will
be attended with at great events. The mid-heavens to the Sextile of Mercury,
does declare, that the Governors of those Countries under Aquarius should
thrive, and get Renown. The Sweed now at this time is inclinable to Peace, and
it is best for him so to do, for if he slips this opportunity, he may repent
when it is too late. The Tartar threatens Europe with Fire and Sword: Let
Poland beware. Muscovy seems to be in good posture to withstand the Tartar. The
Hungarians about these are courted from other Princes, they act like men to the
detriment of the Austrian Family. The effects of the last Conjunction of Saturn
and Mars in Virgo, now operates to purpose, both France and Spain, are both
concerned herein, if this present King of France be now living, he may expect
now about this time to be driven from his own Confines by his own Subjects, or
else he will come to a sudden and unexpected destruction. Few Kings are known
to Ceres, some to go un-butchered, Tyrants their days end so, for no evil man
truly happy is. There are this Year three Eclypses, one of the Sun, and two of
the Moon. The first being of June the 6th. in 26 degrees of Sagitarius, this
threatens Spain and Hungary with a Plague, or some such like distemper. There
is also an Eclypse of the Sun on the 21st. day of June, in 10 degrees of Cancer
visible, but it will be but a small Eclypse, and therefore have no great
signification. All that is, Men will be given to cheat and cosen each other,
under the pretense of Religion, but on the 30th, day of November, there will be
a great Eclypse of the Moon in 19 degrees of Gemini, the Ascendant of London,
Mercury you will find to be Lord of the Ascendant, for Virgo does ascend, and
the Eclypse falls in the 10th. House, if the 10th. represent all those in
Authority, whether Kings or other Magistrates, then they shall find but a
sickly time in their Govemment, there shall be great noises of the sudden
motion of Armies, in those places where Armies are, the Land of Virgo will have
it; so there will be quick dispatch made of those differences, that have been
afoot in those places under Gemini, men carry on the Affairs of the Public,
with a great deal of care. Now the Judges and Magistrares will be careful of
executing of Justice, but whether it will be for fear or otherwise, time will
declare, for I have good ground to believe that all those Magistrates and
Judges of the Law, that have formerly done otherwise, has or will do about
this time, sit down with the loss of both Lives and Estates. Therefore let all
those Magistrates act wisely, lest they Repent when it is too late, Saturn will
also behold the Luminaries and the time of the Eclypse, with an envious
Quartile, and Mercury Lord of the Eclypse behold the defect with an Opposition.
The Comet that appeared 1680, comes now to an Opposition of Luna, she being in
Leo. Now the Comet appears most on those places under Pisces, Virgo,
Sagitarius, Gemini. Now Portugal, Normandy in France, Spain, Dalmatia,
Hungaria, Moravia, Solavonia, Coratia, Babylon, Sardinia, Sweedland, Lumbardy,
England, Brabant, all of these places up in Arms against a Great and Potent
Enemy.

SECT. 4. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1686.
IN this Year there is no direction of the great Conjunction, but the New Star
which appeared 1604. come both to the Quartile of Saturn and Mars in Pisces.
Still the Austrian State is in danger, but a Powerful Enemy, and he may well
say, Lord how are my Foes increased? Livonia and several parts of Germany,
lamentably wasted by Fire and Sword, France and other Countries look blew upon
it, thinking themselves not secure. Now shall those Jesuitical Tribes of
Priests of the Church of Rome (that has set all Europe together by the Ears)
pay dearly for all their Villainies, their Monasteries shall be destroyed, and
they themselves either be destroyed by the Sword, or taken Captive. About
October the 24th, there happens a Conjunction of Saturn and Mars in 8 degrees
of Libra, and also the 14th, of January before there was an Opposition of
Saturn and Mars, Saturn in 29 degrees of Virgo, and Mars 29 degrees of Pisces,
this threatens Livonia and Austria, and Alsatia, with devastation; it also
threatnes loss and damages to the Hollander, neither shall Scotland be free,
things go not well there. We have but one Eclipse this Year, and that will be
of the Moon on the 19th. of November, at eleven of the Clock at Night, it will
be a great Eclipse, it being celebrated in 8 degrees of Gemini, near the Bulls
eye, it begins in the Mid-heaven, and ends in the 9th. House, Jupiter and
Mercury besiege the Sun, and all oppose the Eclipsed Moon, and this from as
violent Stars as she her self is near, Mercury is Lord of both the Mid-haven
and Ascendant, Jupiter is strong and Lord of 7th. and 4th. in Quartile to the
Sign Ascending; this Eclipse will have remarkable effects, it portends the
Incursions of Armies into those Countries under Virgo, Pisces, Gemini, and
Sagitarius. London thou art also concerned by this Eclypse, let thy Magistrates
be careful of doing unjustice, for the Commonalty will have Justice done them,
and those that act otherwise may expect when they least think of it, pay for
their Folly, when it is too late. London, thy Trade will not be good for this
Year, but be content, it is but for a time, if thou will but consider the State
of other Countries, thou will see that thine is not the worst, for in other
Countries there shall be pretended Negotiations for the Composure of
difference, only to delay time to get advantage of one another. There will be
many Ambassadors to the Covernors of thy Kingdom. In this Year 1686, the Comet
that appeared in the Year 1680. comes to the Quartile of Mercury and to the
Quartile of the great Conjunction 1603, and the Comet that appeared 1682, comes
to the Quartile of the Conjunction 1603, and makes a swift passage through
Virgo; those places under Sagitarius, Gemini, Virgo, and Pisces, will be
sufferers by this Comets motion; it declares Mortality to those People, and
great Famine in many places. And because I would not be too large in my
Repititions, take the words of Dubartas (as it is paraphrased by Jos. Silvester.

-- The Blazing-Star,
Threatening the World with Famine, Plagues, and War,
To Princes Death, to Kingdoms many Crosses,
To all Estates inevitable Losses;
To Herds-men Rot, to Plow-men hapless Seasons,
To Saylors Storms, to Cities Civil-Treasons.
On December the 22th day, Saturn and Jupiter make their first Sextile, Jupiter
being in Sagitarius strong, and Saturn in Libra weak, there shall be strong
endeavors made for Peace and Unity in a great many places, but because that
Saturn is so near the place of the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars, I fear it
will hardly be accomplished, yet in some places it may: Now is the War removed
out of Hungary into other Countries.

SECT. 5. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1687.
IN this Year, the Mid. heaven of the great Conjunction comes by direction to
the Sextile of the Conjunction it self, this is a very good direction, and
there is no bad signification this Year, only the Comet comes in Opposition to
the Moon from Pisces, the Moon being in Virgo, and so by that means affects
those two Signs, one by his presence, and the other by his Opposition: The
Comet is in Quartile to the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1663, and is in
Quartile to the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars in the figure of the Full Moon
preceding the Appearance of the New Star 1604. These Positions do afflict
Mars, and all those Countries under Virgo; France, and Paris it self, will go
nigh to be afflicted with a Plague, or some Distemper as bad, there is great
fear amongst of an approaching Catastrophe to befall the Peasants in France; a
Subject to rebel, their Oppressiors are so great, which if they do, the Roman
Party will have the worst of it; and they will in a short time Repent of their
being so barbarous to the Protestants, for their Universal Destruction is
drawing on, these kind of doings will be the beginning of the downfall of that
Tribe of God. Spain and Hungary are in yet free, but are still troubled with
Barren years, and one place, or other of Spain Territories are afflicted with a
Plague. This Year Hungaries Towns many of them are laid wast by the Sword and
Fire, some part of Portugal and Normandy, is also afflicted with a Plague. The
Comet 1682, comes to the place of Mars in the great Conjunction 1683, still the
Sword rages in Austria and Alsatia, and Livonia, Lisbon, Friburgh, Spiers,
Frankford at Ments, Vienna in Austria, and Antwerp; these are the places most
concerned this Year. There will be two Eclypses of the Sun this Year, one in
May, 1st day near noon, in 21 degrees of Taurus visible, the second in 13
degrees in Scorpio, on the 26th, at 6 of the Clock in the Morning, but part
visible.

These Eclypses have most signification upon great Cattle; showing, that there
shall be a Mortality among them (viz.) Horses, Cows, Oxen, and that Russia,
Polonia, Sweedland, Lorrain, Helvetia, and Ireland, shall be the places most
concerned. And let this serve for 1687.

SECT. 6. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1688.
IN this Year also, we have no directions of the great Conjunction, nor of the
New Star 1604, but to begin the Year, we have an Opposition of Saturn and Mars,
from Libra and Aries, then upon the 11th. day of March, Jupiter meets with the
first Quadrate of Saturn in 22.36. of Libra, Jupiter being in Capricornus: The
second Quadrate of Saturn and Jupiter, falls from Libra and Capricornus, Saturn
being 19.9. in Libra, and Jupiter 19.9. in Capricornus; and upon the 8th. day
of November, there is a Conjunction of Saturn and Mars, in 2 degrees of that
envious Sign Scorpio. There is also no less than 4 Eclypses of the Luminaries,
(viz.) 2 of the Sun, and 2 of the Moca. The first is an Eclypse of the Moon
April the 5th, at 6 of the Clock at night, in 26 of Libra. The second is an
Eclypse of the Sun April 21. 1 of the Clock in the Morning, in 11 degrees of
Taurus. The third will be an Eclypse of the Moon September 30. at 10 of the
Clock in the Morning, in 17 degrees of Aries. All these three being not
visible. The fourth is an Eclypse of the Sun, the 15th. day at 7 of the Clock
in the Morning, in 2 degrees of Scorpio, upon the very degree of the
Conjunction of Saturn and Mars. The November following, from all these
Configurations may be judged, that Italy suffers much, and will be enforced to
mourn, because of the sorrow that she does undergo, Austria is also afflicted
by Saturn, being in her Sign, and will not admit any good should be done unto
her; shall that Prince be always troubled with that Party (viz.) Jesuits that
lead him by the nose to his own Destruction? no, the Eclipse of the Sun in
Scorpio, and the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars upon the degree of the Eclypse,
will share their Crowns for them, the Hollanders hold up their Heads a little
longer, the Bavarians lose their Honors, the Turk will be much afflicted with
Domestic broyls and Foreign Losses, the Bohemians are very much disrespected,
but also poor Ireland I fear will have cause to groan for the lamentable
Massacres she does undergo. Now I fear a Rebellion in Ireland, with Massacres
of the English Subjects, but I hope that God in his Mercies will prevent it by
the industry of the Governor.

Had not Jupiter been so weak in Capricornus at the time of the 2d. Quadrate,
there might been hopes of a Reconciliation of differences, but the Eclypse of
the Sun and the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars in Scorpio the House of Mars,
and Mars is Lord of the Ascendant also, from whence he stirs up Men to War, and
Tumults, and Intestine Hatred, with much violence, by which means he knocks all
the former Treaties on the head, and nothing but Confusion follows.

SECT. 7. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1689.
IN this also, there is no Material Direction of the great Conjunction 1603.
nor of the New Star 1704. but on the 4th. day of January Saturn meets with the
Quartile of Jupiter, the third time Saturn is Scorpio 5.35, and Jupiter 5.35
Aquarius, and on the 22th. day of September Saturn is opposed by Mars, Saturn
being 6 degrees of Scorpio and Mars 6 degrees of Taurus. There is also two
famous Eclypses of the Moon, the first falls March 25th. day, at 7 of the Clock
at Night, in 15 degrees of Libra visible, the second is the Moon September. the
19th. day, at 2 of the Clock in the Morning, in 7 degrees of Aries. Were it not
for the Quartile of Saturn and Jupiter, Jupiter being in the House of Saturn,
we might expect to have our Troubles ended in the World. For the Moon bring
Eclyps'd in the second face of Libra threatens a Rot to fall among Informers
and Trapanners, and Catch-poles, and they shall suffer for their former
Knavery; the Sun being in Aries, the Land of England shall take part of this
Blessing, but the Opposition of Saturn and Mars from Scorpio and Taurus bring
affliction to Ireland and Russia, Peloria, Swedeland, and Norway; the City of
Algiers now is much afflicted, by having their Ships destroyed and their Men
taken Captive, Ireland is full of affliction, Swedeland, and Norway, are at War
up to the Ears, while Austria and Alsatia lament their former losses, Hamburgh
will go nigh to be at variance with the King of Denmark, and come to damage
thereby.

SECT. 8. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1690.
IN this Year, the great Conjunction 1603. comes by direction to the place of
the New Star 1572, which Star appeared in 1654 of Taurus, having of 5345 of
North Lat. and it was of a Jovial color, this direction is of a notable
signification. In this Year also there is a Conjunction of Saturn and Mars on
the 13th. of November in a 24th. degree of Sagitary.

All Europe up in Arms, nothing expected but an universal change, which I fear
will come to them. Now let them do what they can, this Conjunction will fall in
Quartile to the Conjunction. 1682. Now Italy where are all thy Princes, now
shut the Stable door to prevent the case of a Horse that is already stole. Oh!
what dangers and troubles art thou like to undergo! Oh! what unspeakable
Villainies have thou been guilty of! Oh! what unlooked and unhoped for Death art
thou like to endure, all caused by thine own wretched Villainies, strange
Apparitions in the Air, so likewise in men's minds. The Sea rages with mighty
Tempest, and whatever now the Mock-star came to declare to thee as to future
Contingencies, shall now and in this Year be made manifest to the purpose! Oh!
what running to and fro will there be of Ambassadors to make an Union among
themselves, but all will be in vain, for the bank being broke, the inundation
must needs follow, alas poor Ireland, are not thy troubles at an end? I could
wish they were, thou art pointed at this Year to suffer a little more. England
be thou content, for thy condition is better than thy neighboring Nations.

The Comet that appeared in 1680, comes to an Opposition of Mars, and to a
Quartile of Sol and Venus in the great Conjunction 1603. Spain now and Portugal
suffer much by the Sword, Plague, and scarcity of Food: France is still at
division among themselves, that Kingdoms nigh to an Universal Catastrophe, many
of her Towns will be laid wast now near these times.

SECT. 9. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1691.
THis Year has notable Directions, (viz.) the Sun, Moon, and Venus, all of
them meet with (by direction) to the Quartile of the Sun, and the Quartile of
the Moon, and Venus, that is, they come, to the Quartile of their own place,
the mid-heaven of the Full Moon preceed the appearance of the New Star, meets
with the place of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, 1682. and in this Year
also, have we a very considerable Opposition of Saturn and Mars, on the very
degree of Scorpio, as the Conjunction fell on, that is, Saturn is 23 degrees in
Scorpio, and Mars 23 degrees in Taurus; there is also this Year 2 Eclypses of
the Sun, the first will be February the 18th. day, at 5 of the Clock in the
Morning, in 10 degrees of Pisces, the second will be on the 13th. day of August
at 6 of the Clock at Night, in 1 degree of Virgo visible. The first will not
from these Configurations and Directions, do I judge that this will be a Year
of great action. Ireland still continues in trouble, and suffers great loss,
Russia and Sweedland are in great perplexity, they are both involved in that
trouble, they cannot be easily rid of it, it would have been better for the
Sweed not to concern himself with War, for he shall be a looser by it, the Moon
with all her Quartiles in Virgo; in those Countries shall be popular Tumults and
Insurrections. Croatia now suffers much, nor is France free, no not Paris her
self. Oh! what Consultations are there, how to cut off the Protestant Party by
a Massacre, or some such means? but they shall make the Proverb good, he that
diggeth a Pit for another, shall fall in it himself; for they have been the
chief cause of all Europe's Troubles that are now on foot, the Troubles that
were from 1672 to 1682, were nothing to these that are like to be about these
times, indeed the Trine of Saturn and Jupiter last year, did cause a great many
to endeavor for to make a Reconciliation of those differences, but the
Animosities among men were so great, that they were not able to complete any
thing; but it is possible, that some League was made there between some
Princes, to join against others, Saturn and Jupiter make this Year their first
Opposition from Sagitarius and Gemini, Saturn being in 5.48 of Sagitarius, and
Jupiter in 5.48 of Gemini, Saturn being so near the place of the great
Conjunction 1603, and there is opposed by Jupiter, this brings strange and
unheard of Translations upon the Stage of the World: Spain still is a looser,
and drinks deep of the Cup of affliction. Now London this Opposition points a
little at thee, a great deal of Faction is like to be in thee, thou harb'rest a
crew of Villains that seek thy Ruin, there will be a pay day for them. France
look thou to thy hits, thou of all Nations will be the greatest Sufferer, and
you may find about these times that God is just. Hungaria is made like unto a
Wilderness by her Devastations. But be thou content, after thy Storm is over
(which as yet must last a little longer) thou shall enjoy a long peace.

SECT. 10. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1692.
ALL the Directions that will be this Year, is only Mercury to the Quartile of
his own place, but there is the second Opposition of Saturn and Jupiter, Saturn
being 14.11. of Sagitarius, and Jupiter 14.11. of Gemini. There is also a very
remarkable Conjunction of Saturn and Mars in 15 degrees of Sagitarius, very
near the New Star, 1604. there is also no less than 5 Eclypses this Year; the
first falls on the 23d. of January (an Eclypse of the Moon) at 2 of the Clock,
in 14 degrees of Leo; the second is of the Sun, on the 6th. of February, about
5 of the Clock at Night, in 28 degrees of Aquarius, these two are not visible,
the third will be an Eclypse of the Moon on the 18th. day of July, at 4 of the
Clock in the Morning, in 6 degrees of Aquarius; the 4th. will be of the Sun
August the 2d. day at 9 of the Clock in the Morning, in 20 degrees of Leo, and
the last will be of the Sun on the 27th. day of December at 2 of the Clock in
the Afternoon, in 17 degrees of Capricornus. Both these two of the Sun, and the
last of the Moon are visible.

Now comes the tripple Conjunction 1682, to operate to the purpose: The Sun
suffering an Eclypse upon the very degree of that Conjunction, and the Moon
suffers an Eclypse upon the very degree of the Conjunction May 1683. Alas poor
Italy, how art thou afflicted? Spain is also Partakers with thee, thou art
threatened with scarcity of Grain, many of thy People will dye for want of
Bread, and those that are left will be Rebels against their Governors, it
declares damage to Kings and great Persons, (viz.) their Death, or Banishment,
a Pope if there be any about these times, will dye: France and England are
intoxicated with Tribulation, but in what nature, time will best declare: The
Hungarians drink deep of the Cup of Affliction, a great Famine is threatened
them, and all the East part of Germany: France is more concerned than England,
nay she shall quake for fear: Alas, Bohemia thou art in a bad condition, and
so is Sicily, the Tartars, and the Sweed, are much concerned this Year.

SECT. 11. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1693.
IN this Year 1693, Mercury in the great Conjunction, comes to the Quartile of
the Conjunction it self. And in this Year (viz.) April the 22d. day, Saturn and
Jupiter make the third and last Opposition, Saturn being in 21.16. of
Sagitarius, and Jupiter 21.16. And there is also an Opposition of Saturn and
Mars, in July following, Saturn 16-0 in Sagitarius, and Mars 16 in Gemini:
There are also 4 Eclypses of the Luminaries this Year, 2 of the Sun, and 2 of
the Moon; the first is of the Moon on January the 12th. day, at 4 of the Clock
in the Morning in 1 degree of Leo visible, and a great one, the second will be
of the Sun on the 23d. day of June near Noon, in 12 degrees of Cancer; this
will be a very great Eclypse as has happened this 40 Years; the third will be
of the Moon July the 7th. near 10 of the Clock in the Morning, in 25 degrees of
Cancer; the last will be of the Sun on December the 16th. day at Midnight, it
will be a great Eclypse, but not visible.

The judgment of this year differs but little from the last. Bohemia is
afflicted with a scarcity of Grain and other Provision fit for Food. The Comet
that appeared in 1680, has lately passed the Quartile of Saturn, Saturn is in
Cancer and the Comet in Aries: Hence are England and Scotland concerned, the
last time that Saturn was in Opposition of Jupiter, was in the Year 1634, and
then there was a great Plague in Rome, some such like Distemper will rage there
this Year, a great many of the great men will dye of that place, whether
Cardinals or Popes, let time declare, they have before now had 2 or 3 Popes in
a Year, I also fear that a many Towns about in England, will have a Plague or
some Distemper as bad. Spain, Hungary, and Dalmatia, are still in a
distraction, what must Spain still be a loser? Those places under Cancer will
be afflicted with Calamity, a Mortality will rage within the Countries;
Ceranado, Burgandy, and Holland, men shall be very much given to Knavery, many
Diseases to Women, sudden and unexpected Deaths to the meaner sort of People.
The City Gemini must expect to have share of this years Transactions, if some
of thy Magistrates should be brought to Justice, then say I am a true Prophet,
many Villainies will be acted in thee, some Plots will be discovered, and the
Actors brought to Punishment.

SECT. 12. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1694.
IN this Year there is no direction of the great Conjunction 1603, nor of the
New Star 1604, but we have a notable Conjunction of Saturn and Mars, December
the 10th, in 6 degrees of Capricornus. Besides there is a visible Eclypse of
the Sun, in Opposition to the Conjuction of Saturn and Mars, on the 12th. day
of June at 5 of the Clock at Night, The second Eclypse of the Sun is on
December 6, at 5 of the Clock at Night, in 25 degrees of Sagitarius, the place
of the Sun in the great Conjunction. The first Eclipse of the Moon is January
the first day at Noon, in 22 degrees of Cancer, not visible. The second of the
Moon falls on the 26th. of June at 12 of the Clock at Night in 15 degrees of
Capricornus.

From these foregoing Configuration, I draw these following Judgments. The
Sweeds and Tartarians are up in Arms, and so are the Muscov^tes; the Tartar
Invades Muscovy, and brings great Calamity upon that Country; the Dane or some
other Country Invades Sweedland, there shall be a great destruction to a many
Cities, and a great slaughter of their Inhabitants; the Hollander draws near to
an end of that manner of way of Government, yet shall no Crowned head ever
conquer it, the change will come by the Peoples consent. Scotland is much
disquieted, and will go nigh to Rebel; Burgundy shall taste of the Cup, and
Venice will go nigh to be taken by the Plaguerage; York will taste of the evil
of this Year, neither shall Oxford be free, there is a bitter potion for that
City to drink, which God in his Mercy divert; Brandenburg will feel the smart
of War; Ireland thou must come in for a share of suffering: in short, such will
be the subtilty of the Roman Clergy, that they by their insinuating shall draw
most if not all the Princes of Europe to their destruction, all which shall but
make way for their own, which will be completed in a few Years now.

SECT. 13. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1695.
IN this Year we have no Directions of the great Conjunction, nor of the New
Star 1604, that are considerable; therefore we look to the other Configurations
of the Planets and Eclypses. We have a famous Opposition of Saturn and Mars,
Saturn being in 8 degrees of Capricornus, and Mars 8 degrees in Cancer, it
falls on the 12th. of August. There are four Eclypses this Year. The first is
of the Moon, which falls on May the 18th. day at 10 of the Clock in the
Morning, in 7 degrees of Sagitarius, the place of the great Conjunction 1603,
but not visible. The second will be of the Sun on the first of June at 5 of the
Clock at Night, in 21 degrees of Gemini, the Ascendant of London, and visible.
The third will be of the Moon on November the 10th. day at 8 of the Clock at
Night, in 28 degrees of Taurus, near the Pleiades and visible. The last will be
of the Sun on the 26th. day of November, in 15 degrees of Sagitarius, near the
place of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1663.

From these Configurations, I find that the Sweed is still in Arm against a
Potent Enemy the Tartar, both afflicts the Muscovite and the Polander, he does
great mischief to Christendom, (viz.) he will destroy a great many Towns in
those Countries lying next him, and carry their People Captive. The Eclypse of
the Sun in Sagitarius brings great affliction to Spain, with the destruction of
their small and great Cattle, great Outrages, and Robberies, and Inhumane
Murders committed in Hungaria, Dalmatia, yea, and in England too, if not in
London; it declares the Death of a many of the Nobility in these places under
Gemini, Mars is Lord of the Ascendant of the figure of the Eclypse, and is in
Taurus in Opposition to it, from whence may be expected popular Insurrections
in those places under Gemini; Ireland cannot as yet be free from trouble, nor
Holland, Scotland, and Burgundy. In this Year Saturn and Jupiter makes their
first Trine from Capricornus and Virgo, Saturn being in 8.8. of Capricornus,
and Jupiter in 8.8. of Virgo, this Trine were it for the weakness of Jupiter
might produce peace to the World, there will be great Meetings and Treaties for
Peace, but the strength of Saturn and the Conjunctions of Saturn and Mars in
Capricornus, hinders the good design of Saturn, and instead of Peace, flings
Europe in worser Broyls than before.

SECT. 14. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1696.
IN this Year, the Ascendant of the New Star comes by direction to the body of
Mercury in Scorpio, and the Mid-heaven to the Conjuction of Saturn and Jupiter,
1682. There is also a notable Conjunction of Saturn and Mars ou the 16th. day
of December. There is also two remarkable Eclypses of the Moon, the first falls
on May the 6th. at Midnight, in 27 degrees of Scorpio visible; and the second
falls on October 30 about 4 of the Clock in the Morning, in 18 degrees of
Taurus also visible.

The Figurations of this Year make me to judge that the Turk is not as yet in
Peace neither has the Tartar returned into his own Country, the Muscovit is
still very much disturbed, and will not rest in Peace for some years. The
Hollander about this time recelves very much damage by Inundations, and their
loss of their Ships abroad; Ireland cannot be free from the
Male-volent-influence of the Stars, the poor English that inhabit there will
suffer much; thou treacherous Irish forbear to do so much mischief, if thou
does attempt to Invade England, you must expect to return if you could,
although at the first you may seem to get the better, yet it will be but a
lightning before Death: Thou must not expect to be a free People, not this 20
Years thou art like to have but small Crops of Corn, whether it will be from
the Barrenness of the Earth, or because the Corn was destroyed upon the ground
by a rebellious sort of People, or both, time will best discover; a Person
little less than a Queen should dye this Year in some Country under Taurus. The
Eclypses of the Moon in Scorpio, declares Seditions, Murders, and all manner
of wretchedness: In this Year there is no less than two Trines of Saturn and
Jupiter from Capricornus and Virgo, Saturn being in 23 degrees of Capricornus,
and Jupiter 23 degrees of Virgo; strong will be the endeavors of the Princes
of the Earth for Peace, and most People are in hopes of accomplishing that so
much longed for thing, but behold, they have brought things as to every one's
thinking, to a Conclusion; then comes the Conjunction of Saturn and Mars in
Capricornus, and destroys all their hopes in a moment, and bloody Wars succeed.

SECT. 15. Of the Astrological Judgment for the Year, 1697.
IN this Year we have no directions of the great Conjunction, nor of the New
Star 1604, but about August the 27th. day there is an Opposition of Saturn and
Mars, Saturn being in 2 degrees of Aquarius, and in 2 degrees of Leo; and there
are 3 Eclypses this year; the first is of the Sun, on the 11th. day of May, at
one of the Clock in the morning, in 1 degree of Taurus; the second is the Moon,
on May the 26th. day at 8 of the Clock in the morning, in 16 degrees of
Scorpio; the last is of the Moon October the 19th. day at 8 of the Clock at
Night, in 7 degrees of Taurus visible. There is also the first Square of Saturn
and Jupiter this year, Saturn being in 1.3. of Aquarius, and Jupiter is in 1.3.
of Scorpio.

Hard is the fate of poor Holland, Scotland, and Ireland, for to endure so long
a time of sorrow, yet thou art not alone, for Tartary, and Muscovia, shares
with thee, for the Polander now beats the Tartar, and sends him home with a
Flea in his Ear: Now does the Turk gain ground upon Italy, now does he feel the
effects of the triple Conjunction to purpose: This first Quartile makes a
beginning, which will continue now until almost all Italy is lost, which will
be in 3 or 4 years after this; yet is poor Oxford afflicted, that City will
find what it is to have a Comet appear in their Sign, but be thou patient, when
thou have been tried, thou will appear like burnished Gold, it is in vain to
contend with so Potent an Enemy as thou have to deal with; this being all the
has to boast of, that her sufferings are not alone.

There is a Family in Europe that had its rise to greatness about the Year
1344, that Family now will find a downfall for ever, the Name of Percys had
their Original about the year 1067, under a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter
in Virgo, and the Conjunction in Pisces 1642/3, brought that Name and Family to
nothing.

SECT. 16. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, School.
IN this year we have no Directions of the great Conjunction, only we have the
Mid-heaven of the appearance of the New Star 1604, to this Conjunction of
Saturn and Jupiter 1682, we have also a famous Conjunction of Saturn and Mars
in 18 degrees of Aquarius in Opposition to the Conjunction 1682 and 1683. There
is also a famous Conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in 22 degree of Scorpio,
August 29 we have also two Eclypses of the Sun, the one in Aries England's
Sign, the other Libra. The first falls March the 31st. at 7 of the Clock at
Night, in 21 degrees of Aries not visible. The second will be September the
24th. at 4 of the Clock in the morning, and therefore not visible, it falls in
11 degrees of Libra, there is all the second Quadrate of Saturn and Jupiter;
this year Saturn is in 19.28. of Aquarius and Jupiter in 19.28. in Scorpio.

This is like to be a year of much action, for now Saturn transites the
Conjunction 1682, by an Opposition, and Jupiter by a Quadrate, great shall be
the effect of this Quadrate, it threatens Italy with no less than Confusion and
a total subversion of the triple Crown, although it may not be fully completed
this year, yet this year sets a great say to it, the Sea shall swell with great
Navies of Ships, and there shall be great Sea Fights; England thou shall have a
hand in it, thou shall be victorious: Now France's Power is brought low, the
late War has destroyed thousands of his Subjects, few or none of them but has
suffered to purpose through the pride of an insulting King, and the envy of the
Roman Clergy, the vallant Tartar received a great Thunder stroke; but if you
will look for the Bolt, you must go to Ireland. The Eclypse of the Sun in Aries
destroys the Sheep and Hogs, it denotes the Death of a Woman of great note, and
also lamentable woe to most men, and in Libra denotes the Death of Kings and
Nobles; it stirs up Sedition and Trouble about Customs and Privileges, it is
the Forerunner of a Famine, and those places under Aries and Libra are most
concerned.

SECT. 17. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1699.
THis year we have the great Conjunction 1603, comes by direction to the
Opposition of Mercury, and the Sun to the Opposition of Mars, and Venus to the
Opposition of Mars, and the Moon to the body of Mars also, and we have the New
Star 1604, comes by direction to the Quartile both of the Sun and Venus,
besides the effects of the last Conjunction of Saturn and Mars last year, and
the Opposition of Saturn and Mars this year. Besides, we have no less than 4
Eclipses this Year. The first will be an Eclypse of the Moon, on March the 5th.
day at 8 of the Clock at Night, in 26 degrees of Scorpio, visible. The second
will be of the Sun on March the 21st. day about 8 of the Clock in the morning,
in 11 degrees of Aries. The third will be an Eclypse of the Moon on August the
30th. near Noon, in 17 degrees of Pisces. The last will be an Eclypse of the
Sun, on the 13th. day of September about 11 of the Clock in the Morning, in 1
degree of Libra, and much about the time of this Eclypse there happens the
Opposition of Saturn and Mars, which will aggravate the effects thereof.

Great will be the Action of this Year, those Villainies that have for many
years been kept as a Secret, will now be made known to every one. All Nations
will be troubled with Rumors of Wars, every Religion preparing Armies. Traffic
prohibited both by Land and Sea, the Main Sea shall hugely swell with mighty
Tempests, so that the Sea banks in many places shall overflow their accustomed
bounds, Inundations universally every where, now Holland look to thy self,
terrible Sea Fights will be this Year occasioning the water to look more red
than the Red Sea, the water turned to Blood, War and Blood shed over all the
Earth; one Nation shall send so many Men to the Wars, that it for a time shall
seem to be desolate of Men; in the Eastern part of the World a whole Army shall
be destroyed by Fire from Heaven, with their Wealth and Treasure: There shall
also be a great drought and want of Water, and the Earth shall be so parched
that there will be no food for Cartle: Great Plagues and War shall cover the
whole face of the Earth, and so destroy Mankind, that there will not be
sufficient Laborers to get in Harvest, and the Vermin shall so destroy the
Fruit on Trees, that all be barren; a general Famine and Dearth of Corn will
overspred most Nations of Europe, so that Thousands shall starve for want of
Bread; yet at the last we have a Sextile of Saturn and Jupiter, each of them
being in their own House: Now shall one appear suddenly, a great Conqueror,
the World filled with the fame of this Man, who shall all of a sudden give
Peace to all Europe. Oh! Happy time.

SECT. 18. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Year, 1700.
IN this year we have the Ascendant of the great Conjunction 1603 by direction
to the body of the Moon and Opposition of the Sun and Venus. There is also a
Conjunction of Saturn and Mars in Pisces December 29th. day we have also two
Eclipses of the Moon. The first will be on February the 26th. day about 6 of
the Clock in the Morning, in 15 degres of Virgo visible. The second will be on
August the 18th. about two of the Clock in the Afternoon in 6 degrees of Pisces.

This year will produce no great matter, only every Nation is endeavoring to
settling it self; now is Rome destroyed, and the downfall of the Seat of Peter,
the Conversion of Turks and Jews soon follows, Religion truly preached
universally over all the World, a general Peace, no more Treason or Rebellion
for a great many years, every Man now possesses his own Vineyard, our youths
grow up to Men's Estates, old Men live their full years; England thou shall
rejoice as well as other Nations in the many blessings God affords you annually.
