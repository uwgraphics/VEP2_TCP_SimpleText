By the GOVERNOR.
I Desire that present notice may be given by the Vice Chancellor, to the
several Heads of all Colleges and Halls, and by the Major to the several
Aldermen, and Churchwardens of every Parish, that they publish within their
several limits; That it is His Majesty's Pleasure, That a strict account be
forthwith taken of the Provisions enjoined by His Majesty's late Orders and
Proclamations for every person for six months. To which purpose, I have
again recommended it to the Gentlemen that made the former Search, to make
another Search: And to begin on Monday the 19th of this instant January. And in
respect such persons as upon this second View, shall be wanting of their due
proportions, are severally to be proceeded against, without distinction of
persons. I thought fit to give them this warning; And therefore pray you not to
fail to take all due means to make this His Majesty's pleasure known; And to
that end likewise Mr Pie, His Majesty's messenger, is to see many of these
printed Papers in the several parts of this University and City to be set up.

Given under my hand at Oxford, this 12th of January, 1645.
Printed at OXFORD, by LEONARD LICHFIELD, Printer to the University, 1645.
