PREFACE.
WHatever falls under the Law of Creation, The Corruption of Philosophic.
is thereby limited and confined: and by how much the more excellent and
perfect the thing is, by so much the greater is its Vitiositie and Vanity, if
it excede its just limits: For the corruption of the best things is ever worst.
This is in nothing more evident than in Philosophy, which in its original and
primitive Idea was most August and Gloriose: but now, alas! alas! what an
inane, confused, sterile thing is it! How difficult is it to separate any
regular Use from the Abuse thereof! The Design of this following Discourse is
to explicate, and demonstrate the prodigiose Abuses, which Philosophy, by
reason of the Vanity, Errors, and Prejudices of man's corrupt mind, has been
obnoxious unto; whereof we have prefixed an Introductorie Breviarie in our
Preface to the second Part, as also in the Contents of this third; so that we
shall not need to Preface any thing farther hereof. That which we have now under
Contemplation is a Proemial account of the grand Design, Moment, and Use of
this Third Part, touching the VANITY OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY, in order to a
separation of its Abuse from the regular Use thereof.

As for the grand Design of this Discourse, The Design of this Discourse.
we must ingenuosly confess, it gave us some of the first and principal Ideas
and Impressions of al our Contemplations for the Reformation of Philosophy.
For after long Observation and Inquisition made into the many prodigiose
Errors, and grand Apostasies of the Church in all Ages, specially under
Antichrist, we find that Vain Philosophy lies as a latent root, and conceled
spring of this Mystery of Iniquity. Whence springes al Apostasy in
Profession, but from some degree of Apostasy in Light and Affection? As God's
departure from Churches is gradual, so the departure of Churches from God: And
what are the first steps of departing from God, but when the Love of God and
his Evangelie Truths is shut out of the heart? Is there not a strange
Infatuation and callose stupiditie in the least degree of backsliding from the
love of the Truth and its simplicity? And was not this that which gave the
first lines to the formation of that Man of Sin, and his Antichristian
Apostasy? This the Spirit of God assures us of, 2 These. 2.10, 11.
2 These. 2.10, 11. foretelling, [That the Man of Sin should come] with all
deceivablenesse of unrighteousness; because they received not the love of the
Truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong
delusion, that they should believe a lie. The whole stresse of this
Antichristian Apostasy seems to be laid on this, that men received not the
love of the Truth; or the Truth in the love thereof. This was that malign
worm that lay at the root of the heart, which caused a vital decay in
Christianity, and so laid the foundation of that great Antichristian
Apostasy, even in those Primitive Churches. As in Nature al withering begins
at the root, though it first appear in the branches; so in all Apostasy, the
consumtion begins first at the heart. And whence proceeded this vital consumtion
at the heart of the first Christians and Churches, but from want of love to
Evangelic Truth, and its simplicity? Was it not hence that many of the
Fathers, specially Origin, and such as were educated in the Schole at
Alexandria, labored under a libidinose insatiable thirst after Vain
Philosophy; vainly hoping thereby to beautify and adorn Christian Theology?
But did they really attain their End? was not the whole Systeme of
Antichristian Errors, Apostasies, and Abominations introduced hereby? This we
have copiosely demonstrated, Book II. of this Third Part.

If it be further inquired, how it comes to pass, The malignitie of Pagan
Philosophy.
that Pagan Philosophy, which contains in it so many useful Philosophemes and
Contemplations, should have such a venomous influence on the worst of Errors
and Apostasies? That which satisfies mine own Inquisition herein may be reduced
to these three Heads: 1. As considered in it self.
(1) The Vanity and Malignitie of the Object. (2) The Vanity and Malignitie
of the Subject. (3) The Curse of God on both. 1. The Object, Pagan Philosophy,
considered in it self, contains in it much of Vanity and Malignitie. This we
have sufficiently demonstrated, B. 1. throughout, from the Causes, Parts, and
Adjuncts of Pagan Philosophy. But that wherein the Spirit of its malignitie
seems to consiste is not so much its Matter, Parts, Adjuncts, or effective
springs, as its principal End and Design, which is to reduce and advance
lapsed man to a state of Integrity and Perfection, by the force and
improvement of his own Free Will. The grand Design of Ethnic Philosophy, in
its original constitution, was to put men under a Covenant of Works, thereby
to keep them from Sin, and to merit Life. Proud nature ever affectes an
Independence as to God, and to procure a Divine life by its own forces: What
more pleasing to corrupt nature than to act from, and for it self? O! how
fruitful is the root of the Old Covenant in corrupt nature! How apt is every
man by nature to run himself on a Covenant of Works, and deifie some
righteousness of his own, though never so unrighteous! What latent venes of
Pelagianisme are there in the hearts of al by nature! whence, according to
Augustine, Pelagianisme is the Heresy of Nature. Now what was the (...), or
prime Error of al Ethnic Philosophy but this, so to cultivate, refine and
elevate corrupt nature, as to render it a sit Temple of the Deity, without the
superaddition of Medicinal Grace? It Is true, that Socratic and Platonic
Philosophy speaks much of the Divine Infusion of Virtue; yet still as the
reward of men's endeavors, without the least regard to the New Covenant or true
Mediator.

2. But yet the principal poison and malignitie of Pagan Philosophy arose from
the Spirits and Principes of those who composed the same, 2. As to its Subject.
or were conversant therein. Had Philosophy been never so pure and virgin in
it self, yet falling on carnal, proud, and wanton wits, how soon was it
adulterated and rendered vain, yea noxious! We see, by sad experience, how soon
the Evangel of our Lord, and Evangelic Dogmes are turned into the greatest
Errors, when men of corrupt minds engage therein. How much more then was
Philosophy, in it self so corrupt, obnoxious to Vanity and corruption, when
the minds of men engaged therein were so vain and corrupt! Thus much the
Scripture takes notice of, touching the Philosophers, Romans 1.21.
Romans 1.21. But became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts
were darkened. The natural imagination is the most vain thing in the world: how
does it like the silke-worme, lie entangled in those Philosophemes, which came
out of its own bowels! How soon did lust in those blind Philosophers, put out
the light of Reason, and so darken their foolish hearts! Ver. 22.
Hence it follows, v. 22. Professing themselves to be wise [ i.e. great
Sophistes] they became fools. There is nothing more worthy of compassion, than
the blindness of such proud Sophistes, who profess themselves the most
quick-sighted and sage in the world. Is not the terrible pestiferous darkness
of such, by so much the more deplorable, in that they take it for Light, which
they follow with pleasure, as Children do the Ignis fatuus, which leads them
to precipices and ruin? Are not such greatly to be pitied, who use their
Reason only to render them more unreasonable? And has not this been a principal
cause of the Vanity of Philosophy, and its pestiferous influences on al great
Apostasies?

3. We may add hereto the Curse of God on Philosophy and Philosophers, 3. As
to the Curse of God.
for the abuse of that Natural or Traditional Light vouchsafed to them. This is
more than intimated by Paul, in his Sacred Discourse of the Gentiles
Philosophy, Romans 1.28. Romans 1.28.
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them
over to a reprobate mind, to do those things that are not convenient. He says,
(1) They did not like to retain God in their knowledge. (...) signifies [1] in
the general any Agnition, whereby a thing is acknowleged to be what it is. So
Romans 3.10. Col. 1.2. and 2.2. as elsewhere. And then the sense is, they did not
like to retain God in their acknowlegement; i.e. to acknowledge him such as
indeed he is, most perfect, alsufficient, simple, pure, just, etc. [2] Science,
Intelligence, right Reason, as Romans 10.2. And thus the sense is; albeit they
had some notices of God, yet they did not like to retain him in the true
science or right understanding of him. [3] More particularly, a faithful,
salutiferous, obediential acknowlegement. Thus Ephesians. 1.17. and 4.13. Phil.
1.9. So it implies, a more accurate, exact, active knowledge, according to that
Greek Gloss, (...), Agnition, is knowledge superadded to knowledge, i.e. to
speak in the Scholastic idiome, cognition practically practic; affective and
effective knowledge; distinct exact knowledge. They had many sublime notices and
Metaphysic Contemplations of God, but not such as did work their hearts to any
real love, and obedience of God. Whence it follows: (2) God gave them over to a
reprobate mind. (...) notes, [1] Rejected. So Hebr. 6.8. (...), rejected and
nigh unto cursing. Thus the sense is, they rejected God in their mind, and God
delivered them up to a rejected mind. [2] Adulterine, spurious, and thence
rejectaneous: as (...), rejectaneous, adulterine money. Thus it is taken, 2 Cor.
13.5, 6, 7. 2 Timothy 3.8. Tit. 1.6. and so the sense is, God gave them up to a
drossie, vain, adulterine mind. [3] Perverse, contrary to right Reason. And
thus it is primarily to be understood here; and so there is an elegant allusion
between (...), they did not approve of, and acknowledge God in their practic
Judgments or Consciences; and therefore God did not approve of, or own their
practic judgments, but delivered them up to a reprobate or perverse judgment;
which hurried them into al manner of Idolatry and wickednesses, as is
specified v. 26,-31. Thence it follows, (3) (...), To do things not convenient.
These proud Sophistes, specially the Stoics, boasted greatly of their (...) and
(...), that which is congruous and convenient: wherein they placed the whole of
Philosophy. So Clemens Alexandr. Paedag. page 101. The Stoics call that which
is done according to the obedience of Reason and Virtue, (...), congruous and
convenient. And O! how much did they vainly glory in this Congruitie and
Convenience of their actions! Yea, did they not as many now-adayes, measure the
Great God, and his Divine Perfections by Rules of Congruitie and Convenience,
coined by their vain imaginations? But Paul gives us their true Character, that
being delivered up to a reprobate mind, they did things not convenient; i. e.
they fell into the most prodigiose Immoralities, notwithstanding al their
pretended Morality. And how justly does God leave such as place their own
Wisdom and Morality in the Throne of God, to commit the most undecent
Immoralities? Thus God bemisted the degenerate minds of those proud Sophistes
and Moralistes, causing their very light and Moral Virtue to play the Knaves
with them, and betray them into the hands of the worst Immoralities; as v. 29,
30, 31. Oh! how mysteriose and invisible are Gods ways of giving men up to a
Reprobate mind! How soon does light harden those whom it does not soften! Can
there be a more severe judgment, than for men to be given up to a Reprobate
mind, and the lusts of their own hearts? May we then wonder that Ethnic
Philosophy should prove in it self so vain and venomous, as also in its
influences on the Church of God, when it was under so great a curse of God?

Neither has this Judiciary curse terminated only on Pagan Philosophy, but
also diffused it self throughout almost the whole of Scholastic Theology. Yea,
I must confess my self to be in this point of the same persuasion with pious
Jansenius, that great Patron of Medicinal Grace, who, in his August. Tom. 2. l.
2. c. 2. page 326. tells us, That he could not but vehemently wonder, that many
of the Gentile Philosophers Philosophised far more piously and rightly, of the
principal heads of Moral Doctrine and Grace, than many Christian Scholemen,
etc. Of which see more Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 1. 4. of this Part 3. And a great
Prelat of this Age and Nation assures us, That there has not been a greater
plague to Christian Religion than Schole-Divinitie. And he gives this reason of
it: When men will be wiser than God, and think by their foolish wisdom to add
to Gods Word; God, to convince them of their folly, suffers Satan to sow seeds
of Heresy and Division among them. Such is the vanity and malignitie of
Philosophy, and al human wisdom, when abused by men of reprobate minds, and
so brought under a Divine Curse.

Hence we see how necessary it is for any, The right use of Philosophy.
that will make a right use of Philosophy, to separate therefrom its vanity
and abuses: and how can this be duly performed, but by a curiose Contemplation
of, and Inquisition into the Causes, Adjuncts, and Effects of vain Philosophy;
which is the principal Intendement of the following Discourse. And if we will
indeed render Philosophy useful we must observe these general Rules: (1) That
al Philosophy be reduced, See more of these Rules Philos. Genera. Disser.
Prooem. p. 7, etc.
to and measured by its original and perfect Exemplar, the Divine Word and
Light. Had the first Fathers, Origin, etc. as also the Scholastic Theologues,
their Successors, taken this course, what great use might they have made of
Ethnic Philosophy, and preserved the Church from those monstrose Errors, and
Abuses that followed the same? (2) That so much only of Pagan Philosophy must
be admitted as may subserve Christian Theology, not oppose the same. (3) That
not the end of Ethnic Philosophy, or Philosophers, may be assumed by us, but
only such Philosophemes as may serve to explicate Dogmes in Theology. The End
both of Pagan Philosophy and Philosophers, being to exalt the Lights and
Heats, or Forces of corrupt nature, and to reduce men to the old antiquated
Covenant of Works, this may in no regard be admitted by Christians, who are
under a New Covenant: yet there are many excellent Philosophemes and Notions
both Moral and Metaphysic, which if improved by an humble fidele mind, on
Evangelic Principes and Motiyes, may be of great use, not only for the
Moralizing of Persons and Republics, but also for the Explication of many
momentose Verities in Christian Theology. Hereof we have given many Specimens
in our Fourth Part of the Court of the Gentiles, as also in our Philosophia
Generalis, Part 1. Lib. 3. Chap. 3, 4. and Part 2.

We are also to premit something touching the Form and Method of this
following Discourse, The Form of this Discourse.
which we have endeavored to suit to our Matter, as Nature does her Forms. And
whereas we have explicated and insisted on so many Textes of Scripture, we
presume that will not be thought impertinent, sithat our main subject is the
Vanity and Abuses of Philosophy, which are best evidenced by Divine Light. We
may not also pretermit without some mention the many Citations and Explications
made use of by us out of Grotius; whose Annotations and Illustrations we have
frequently cited; not as if we estimed him an authentic Judge in matters of
Faith or Scripture; but as he was a good Critic, wel-skilled in Antiquity, and
a person of great estime for his Learning; so that it cannot be conceived, that
his Indignation against Pagan Philosophy should proceed from any groundless
prejudice against the same, but rather from a just and deserved apprehension of
the many evils and pestiferous effects that attended the abuse thereof. I must
ingenuously confess, that when I did read Grotius's Annotations on the New
Testament, and diligently observed, how much he decried vain Philosophy, by
reason of its noxious Infusions, and venomous influences on the principal
Errors in the Christian Church, it put me on more curiose Inquisition and
diligent researches into this matter: wherein I found the Abuses of Philosophy
much greater than ever I imagined.

As for Grotius himself, if it may not seem too great presumtion to give the
world my Character of so Learned a man, I conceive he did the Church and
Learned men good service, before he, by reason of Interest or Discontent, fell
off to Socinianisme, and Cassandrian Popery, which his Controversies with
Rivet demonstrate him greatly propense unto. And to make good this my Charge, I
shall give a Specimen of some Socinian and Popish Errors, which lie scattered in
his Annotations on the New Testament. On Joh. 8.58. he renders (...), eram, I
was. i.e. says he, Christ was before Abraham in Divine appointment. So Joh.
10.38. he says, That the Father was in him by his influence, and he was in the
Father by perfect obedience. So Joh. 17.5. he understandes, (...), of the
Divine Decree. Al which overthrow Christ's Deity. Again, Joh. 17.12. (...). i.
e. says he, I have by my daily precepts and exemple endeavored it, etc. Where
he makes Christ a Mediator only by Precepts and Exemple, according to the
Socinian Mode. And then he adds, that (...), Son of perdition, is said not of
any Destination of God, but of his own merit, whereby he denies Reprobation.
And ver. 21. (...), that they may be al one; i.e. says he, one in faith and
love: which notes only a Moral union with Christ. So ver. 26. (...). i.e. says
he, by Dogme and Exemple. Again, 1 Cor. 8.11. he says, that Christ died
altogether for all men, that they might be converted by the Gospel; therefore
also for them that perish. Which is both Pelagian, Socinian, and Popish. Ephesians.
6.19. he has this expression, Shall we think, that the prayers of Paul
reigning with Christ profit us nothing? where he assertes the Intercession of
Saints. And ver. 23. (...), he thus explicates: He has joined the principal
cause with the second cause. Where he makes Christ a second cause, which is
rank Socinianisme, and Arianisme foisted into the Primitive Churches by
Origin, as we have demonstrated, Book 2. Chap. 1.. 8, 9. So Philip. 2.6. he
interprets (...), to be locked on as God. And on Phil. 3.11. he says, (...),
shows the thing to be uncertain; whereby he agrees with the Papists, in
denying Assurance. So in ver. 12, 13. he assertes falling from Grace. Also Col.
2.13. (...), Dead in sins, he understandes with a diminution, as it were dead.
Moreover on 2 Timothy 4.7. he upbraides such who trusted in imputed
Righteousness, which is the spirit of Popery. And 1 Timothy 3.16. God was
manifest, etc. he leaves out God, and applies al to the Gospel: which he
learned from the Socinians. Again, Tit. 1.1. (...), he interprets of Election
by or for faith. And on Heb. 6.4, 5. he concludes, that the best of Christians
may fall from Grace. And Hebr. 10.5. he interprets Christ's coming into the
world, of his passing from a private life to his Ministerial Office, which
subvertes the Deity of Christ. And ver. 18. by (...), Remission of sin, he
understandes the sanation or curing of the soul from sin, which is manifest
Papisme. And Hebr. 10.29. he says, that justified persons, who have received
the spirit, may fall away. And James 2.23. by (...), imputed, he understandes,
that faith was reputed by God as an egregious thing, which is rank
Socinianisme. And Revel. 20.15. on (...), he says, that it suffices not, that
the name be sometime written in the book of life, etc. How much he endeavored
to elude and evade al those Characteristic notes of Antichrist given by Paul
and John, affixing them on Simon Magus, or some other, is evident by his Notes
on 2 These. 2.3, 4, 5, etc. as also by his Epistles, specially Epist. 199. to
Curcellaeus.

These Reflections on Grotius I conceive expedient, as a Premonition to young
Students, that they imbibe not his erroneous Infusions, together with his
Learned Annotations. I am not ignorant that by opposing Grotius, I greatly
incur the censure and displeasure of some Learned men, which is no way
desirable to an ingenuous spirit, or to any that love their repose; but this I
can truly say, that I would differ from none farther than they differ from
Truth, which ought to be more estimed by us than the estime of men, or our own
quiet, of which more fully in the close to our Preface, Part 4.

. 1. HAving in the former Part contemplated Philosophy in its origin and
progress, Vain Philosophy from ignorance.
we are now to take view of it in its degenerate, corrupt and deformed Idea or
visage: For though it were in its origin a weak imperfect reflection of that
gloriose Divine Revelation, which shone from the Sun of Righteousness on the
Jewish Church; yet falling on proud, carnal, indisposed hearts, it did but
harden them the more: So that, Holding the truth in unrighteousness, they
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened: for
professing themselves to be wise, they became foolish, as Romans 1.18, 21, 22.
Now to penetrate fully the Corruptions and Vanity of Pagan Philosophy, we
shall consider it, (1.) In its Causes. (2.) In its Matter and Parts. (3.) In its
Form and Proprieties. (4.) In its Effects.

We shall begin with the Vanity of Philosophy, as considered in its Causes.
And the first prolific seminal cause of all the Vanity and corruption of
Philosophy, was the innate congenite darkness, or the native ignorance of the
natural understanding. 1 Cor. 2.14, The natural man, i. e. Nature in its
highest Philosophic elevation. By (...), the Animal or natural man, we are to
understand, not only the brutish, sensual man; but man under the highest
raisures of natural or moral endowments, so far as he is void of the Spirit of
God, and opposite to the spiritual man, ver. 15. Thus Chrysostom interprets
this (...), to be (...), who lives after the flesh, not having his mind
illuminated by the Spirit, but clothed only with a natural human intelligence,
which the creator has more or less invested the souls of al with. This Dr.
Reynolds, in his Conc. ad Clerum, has largely proved. These first Sophists or
Philosophers, finding themselves in the dark as to the origin and first
principes of the Universe; but much more, as to the sublime Mysteries of
Divinity; they considered how they might reduce their (...), those dark
Notices and Remains of natural light, unto a more perfect contemplation of
things in their true and genuine Ideas. And in order hereto, that they might
the better foment and improve these few commun Principes, contemplative and
active, they under-took many tedious Travels and Labors; they went far and
near, to the Egyptians, Phenicians, and Chaldeans, but principally to the
Hebrews, who were scattered amongst al these Nations; from whom they received
immediately, or by the mediation of those neighboring Nations, some fragments
and broken traditions of the first origin of things; their Connexions,
Causalities, Effects, etc. Also of the first Eternal Being, his Perfections,
Operations, and Modes of worship, etc. which foreign heavenly Plants of Divine
Revelation, they endeavored to transplant into the Garden of their natural
Understandings and Philosophy; hoping thereby to cultivate and elevate their
own natural Principes. But these Divine Mysteries being too big for their
natural Acumen, they soon degenerated into vain imaginations. We find all this
set forth to the life by Paul, in his Discourse to the Athenian Philosophers,
Act. 17.27. Act. 17.27. (...).
(...), If happily they might, by groping after him, find him, i. e. like blind
men, etc. (...), primarily and properly signifies, to touch, as they who play
on a Music Instrument. But thence, in a more laxe notion, it notes, to grope
with the hand, as blind men grope for the Wall: and thence metaphorically, as
applied to the mind, it imports the dark inquiries of blind nature after God
and things Supernatural. This is excellently illustrated, 2 Pet. 1.9, But he
that wants these things, is blind, and cannot see afar off. (...), 2 Pet.
1.9. (...).
i. e. not able to open his eyes: Or as Beza, Not able to see far. So Aristotle
defines (...), i. e. (according to Budaeus) Myopes are such, who from their
birth see things next them, but things remote they cannot see. Or as Beza,
(...), because they always blink with their eyes. Thus learned Bochart, in his
elaborate Book De Animalibus Sacris, part. 1. lib. 1. cap. 4. page 31. Where
having laid down three interpretations of the word (...), he adds a fourth,
which he closes with: I prefer, says he, the fourth interpretation of them
who render (...) to shut the eyes, to twinkle, to blink with the eyes. So
Hesychius, (...). So Isa. 6.10. Matt. 13.15. Act. 28.27, (...), they twinkled
with their eyes. Thus also the simple (...) is often taken: so that (...),
implies no other than (...), to shut the eyes, as Isa. 33.15. Therefore this
(...), is he who is blind, because he voluntarily shuts his eyes that he may
not see, or who seems to see, what he unwillingly beholds. Such are by Job
24.13, called (...) Rebels against the light, John 3.20. This fully agrees to
these Gentile Philosophers, Romans 1.18.
who are said, Romans 1.18, To hold the truth in unrighteousness: i. e. They had
some (...), commun notions of a Deity, which they cultivated by studiose
Contemplation of the invisible perfections of God in his visible works, as
ver. 19; and farther, by some broken Tradition; borrowed from the Church of
God. Yet all this while, the truth being captivated by their dark minds, they
could not see afar off: they had only a purblind light, or as Plato calls it,
(...), a night-day knowledge of Divine things, which rendered them only skilful
in coining vain imaginations, etc. They may be said to hold the truth in
unrighteousness, on a twofold account. (1.) As by their unrighteousness they
captivated the Truth: Their unrighteous lusts were too strong for Truth. Or
(2.) As they did captivate Truth unrighteously, against al equity and justice.
Had they given Truth fair play, it would have dealt roundly with them, and made
them sensible of their Crimes; but their unrighteous lusts, did against al
rules of equity, unrighteously captivate Truth, that so it might not disturb
them in their wicked practices.

. 2. A Second Cause of the Vanity of Pagan Philosophy, 2. Human Inventions.
was the human Figments and Inventions of their own, which they mixed with
those broken Traditions, they received originally from the Jewish Church;
whence the whole of their Philosophy, according to Divine estimation, is
judged to be at best but human Invention and Tradition. This is fully laid
down, Col. 2.8, Through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of
men, etc. Col. 2.8.
The Apostle seems to strike primarily at the Pythagorean Philosophy, as it
appears by the following, verse. 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, which were Pythagorean
Doctrines. Thence Grotius, and Hammond out of him, understand this Discourse of
the Gnostic Theology, composed for the most part of Pythagorean Principes. Now
here the Apostle exhorces them First, That no man make a prey of them through
Philosophy. What the proper import of (...) is, we shall hereafter show. He
says, (...). Grotius observes, that here is the figure (...), one and the same
thing signified by two expressions: For (...), by Philosophy and vain deceit,
avails as much, as if he had said, (...), by the vain deceit of Philosophy.
Thence the Apostle proves, that it was vain Philosophy, from its Causes,
(which is the highest kind of demonstration) (...), according to the tradition
of men. Very right: (adds Grotius) for that which these Greek Philosophers
taught, proceeded, (...), for the most part, from their human ingenie, or own
invention. But what true account can we have of God, and of his Decrees,
unless we are taught of God? Hence therefore those perpetual and inexplicable
dissentions amongst the Philosophers: Hence also their industrious labor and
study, in things that were neither in themselves certain, nor yet rendered men
better. (...), according to the institution, which came not from Heaven; but
from this world: and thence is partly false, partly imperfect. (...) properly
signifies the Elements, which the Philosophers suppose to be the first
principes of Natural bodies. Thence in Philosophy the word was used to
signify the first principes, or rudiments of any Science, which have an
analogy with the natural elements. So that by rudiments, or elements of this
world, is evidently meant those principe, of Philosophy, which had their main
origin from the world; that is, the invention of man, though grounded on some
Jewish traditions. So it follows, (...), and not according to Christ: i. e.
says Grotius, Not such rudiments or institutions, which were brought by Christ
from Heaven. It Is true, much of their Philosophy, its first Rudiments and
Elements, descended originally from Heaven by Christ. For, as it has been
proved, the chief principes of al Philosophy were but corrupt traductions, or
broken traditions derived originally from Gods sacred Oracles: Ay, but in as
much as the manner of traduction, or conveighance was but human, not according
to Gods Ordinance; yea very broken and imperfect; and moreover, these purblind
Philosophers mixed their own figments and inventions with their Jewish
Traditions, which they understood not, neither emproved to any other use or
end, than a little to elevate their own commun principes; hence the Apostle
styles the whole of their Principes and Philosophy but Traditions of men,
worldly rudiments, which were partly false, partly imperfect; but wholly vain
and useless as to Divine Institution and Instruction of men, in the saving
knowledge of God in Christ. Not that the Apostle condemns al Philosophy as
vain, because it was of human Invention or Tradition; but his design here, is
to preserve these Collossians from the contagious infusions of the Gnostics,
and other Heretics, who mixed Pythagoric Traditions and Rudiments, with Divine
Revelations and Institutions; and so rendered both vain and useless. This our
Apostle over and again inculcates, Col. 2.20.
verse. 20.21, 22, Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ to the rudiments of the
world, etc. i. e. says Grotius, Christ has delivered you from this human
Institution. He that is dead, is freed from the incommodities of life.
Therefore to dye here, is taken in the better part, as Romans 6.2. Gal. 4.3, 9.
(...), Rudiments, are every institution, as Gal. 4.3, 9. Where you will see the
reason, why they are called (...), Rudiments of the world; namely, because they
were commun to the Jews with the Gentiles. For there was nothing in these Rites
peculiar to the Jews, yea they rather came by Gods permission from the Gentiles
to the Jews, than from the Jews to the Gentiles. And indeed it is evident, That
these Rudiments or Institutes here mentioned, ver. 21, 22, were not Jewish but
Pythagorean, (as Grotius observes) which the Gnostics transplanted out of the
Pythagorean Philosophy, into their Theology. This further appears by what
follows, ver. 20, (...); Why, as though living in the world, are ye subject
unto ordinances? (...), says Grotius, signifies here, Why do you suffer your
selves to be thus taught, as though your life were to be composed according to
the exemple, not of Christ, but of the World? Or, as Schmidius, Why do you bind
your selves, ad (...), to the Dogmes, Rites, and Institutes of men? (...), as
it is well known, is a Philosophic term, and signifies to impose a Dogme, or
Doctrine, as (...), to impose a Law. The Pythagoreans had their (...), Dogmes,
imposed on al their Sect; so that (...), he said it, was a Law to them. Now,
says the Apostle, Why do you suffer these Pythagorean Dogmes to be imposed on
your Consciences, instead of Christ's Laws? Why do you subject your Consciences
to these worldly Rudiments, or Pythagorean Ordinances, which are vain and
useless, in point of salvation; as to matters of Faith and worship, etc? Then
our Apostle procedes to lay down some of these Pythagorean Dogmes or
Ordinances, ver. 21, Col. 2.21.
(...). That these are no Mosaic Ordinances, is affirmed by Tertullian. It
seems to me (says Grotius) that he uses words commun, which comprehend both
the Jews and the Philosophers, principally the Pythagorist, etc. Then it
follows, Col. 2.22.
ver. 22, (...), according to the commandments and Doctrines of men. This,
says Grotius, ought to be referred to the remoter, namely to that (...),
ordinances, ver. 20, which were the inventions of men, not of God. (...), are
such things as are commanded by men's Laws: (...), are the Injunctions or Dogmes
of the Philosophers. So that we see the sum of our Apostles Discourse, and
scope in these forecited places, is, to show the vanity and deceit of this
Pythagorean Philosophy, which these Gnostics (pretenders to wisdom) had
foisted into their mystic Divinity. And this he does fully demonstrate from
its main cause; namely, that al these Pythagoric Principes (which these foolish
Gnostics so much doted on) were but men's Traditions and worldly Rudiments, as
ver. 8, or Dogmes, Mandates and Doctrines of men; as ver. 20, 22: i. e. Though
they might have some origin Idea in, and Tradition from Gods sacred Oracles;
yet, in as much as this Tradition was only human, broken and corrupt, and no
way apprehended, much less rightly improved, but rather abused to vanity,
pride and idolatry, by these foolish Sophists; hence the whole of their
Philosophy, according to Divine estimation, was judged at best but of human.
Invention and Tradition; and therefore vain and deceitful, when made the
measure of Divine things, or rule of faith and worship, as here it was. And
this indeed the wiser of the Philosophers, Pythagoras and Plato, seemed
sensible of; as also of their need of an higher and more Divine light, than
what they had attained unto by Traditions received, and the improvements of
their own natural principes thereon. What else mean those Pythagoric Symbols,
Look not in a glass by Candlelight? Discourse not of Pythagorean things
without light, etc. And Plato gives us many great acknowlegements of his
natural ignorance, and of the need he had of a Divine light, to direct him into
the knowledge of Divine Mysteries, etc.

. 3. Another Cause of the corruption and vanity of Philosophy, Curiosity and
affectation of Novitie. Col. 2.18.
was Curiosity, and affectation of Novitie. This is more than hinted in that
of the Apostle, Col. 2.18, (...), i. e. (says Grotius) Penetrating into those
things, which he has not seen or known; claiming a privilege of discoursing
concerning things unknown or hidden. (...), in the Glossarie, signifies to dive
or pry into. It is placed for the Hebrew (...) Psalm. 19.51. They preferred
Angels to what Offices they pleased, coining Names for them, distributing them
into Classes, etc. Schmidius renders (...), Invading, or proudly intruding on
things he has not seen. (...), properly signifies, to place the foot on
somewhat; and thence sometimes, proudly to undertake a matter beyond a man's
capacity. Our Apostle here strikes immediately at the Pythagorising Gnostics,
their proud and curiose speculations, concerning the Pythagorean Aeones or
Angels; whose Natures, Proprieties, Orders and Offices, they so busily, but
vainly pryed into: As after them, the Popish Monks and Scholemen, who exactly
follow the Gnostics and Pythagoreans herein; and so are without dout struck at
here, by this Apostolic charge. This curiose inquisitive humor was an original
sin amongst the Greek Philosophers, specially the Pythagoreans; who having had
some dark notices of Divine Jewish Mysteries, were greatly inquisitive into
them, even beyond sobriety and modesty; in so much, that being, as it were,
drunken with their own curiose conceits and speculations, they grew extreme
vain in all their Imaginations and Philosophy. This sin of curiosity, and
affectation of novitie, was that which Luke charged upon the Athenians, as the
source of their vain Philosophemes, Act. 17.18, 21. ver. 18, we are told, that
he was encountered by certain Philosophers, Epicureans and Stoics, who ver. 20,
seem very inquisitive to know what Paul's new Doctrine meant; and ver. 21, Luke
gives us the root of al their Vain Philosophisings, namely, their Curiosity,
Act 17.21.
who spent their time in nothing else but some new thing. (...), i. e. they
were wholly busied, or, they counted their time in nothing else well spent but
in Novities. This humor of Curiosity was that which the Corinthian Sophists or
Wisemen were drunken with; for which Paul frequently rebukes them, specially,
1 Cor. 15.32, 1 Cor. 15.32.
Awake to righteousness, etc. (...) (says Beza) to awake, properly belongs to
persons Drunken, who at length after sleep grow sober. He speaks here of the
sobriety of the mind, to which he exhortes them to return, who had been, as
it were, drunken with their many and curiose speculations. This itch of
Curiosity is that which has ever proved noxious (yea, perniciose where it
prevails) not only to Pagan Philosophy, but also to Schole-Divinitie; and it is
like to prove as destructive to Sacred Philologie or Scripture-Criticisme,
(according to the Prophetic fears of Pious Usher) if Critics awake not to
righteousness. This peccant humor of Curiosity, as Aquinas has well observed
in 2a 2ae, Quaes. 167. is not directly opposed to a through disquisition and
knowledge of Truth, but to the irregular Appetite thereof, or Studies therein;
which Irregularitie may be occasioned several ways. As (1.) when our
Curiosity leads us to the study of Truth only upon some lower motive or base
ends; namely, to feed our Pride, or gratify Lust. (2.) When our very Appetite
or desires and studies after knowledge are inordinate and excessive. (3.) When
the matter of our Studies and Inquiries is irregular, i. e. things secret, and
above our capacities: or else things forbidden and sinful. (4.) When the manner
of our disquisitions and contemplations is irregular; which happens sundry
ways. [1.] When we are preposterous in our studies, and make that subservient
which should be ultimate, and that ultimate which should subserve. [2.] When we
violently pursue shadows or things less useful, and neglect substantials or
matters of moment, etc. [3.] When al is done in our own strength and confidence.
Al these pieces of Curiosity the Pythagoreans, with the rest of the
Philosophers, were greatly guilty of, which rendered their Philosophy exceeding
vain and degenerate: and the Schole-men have herein followed, if not out-gone
them. Spiritual Pride, the Cause of Vain Philosophy.


. 4. Another great Mother-root of the Vanity of Philosophy, was Spiritual
Pride, which attended and influenced all the Disquisitions and Contemplations of
those Pagan Philosophers. This is sufficiently expressed by our Apostle, Col.
2.18.
in his forecited caution to the Colossians, Chap. 2. ver. 18. (...), vainly
puffed up by his fleshly mind. (...) (says Grotius) here is spoken of human
Knowledge, not reveled by God. So (...) is taken, Matt. 16.17. This knowledge
swells them like to the wind. The word (...) we have 1 Cor. 4.6, 18, 19, etc.
They much pleased themselves in vain matters, as Ezech. 13.3. It is most
evident, that our Apostle persues his great undertaking begun ver. 8, to prove
this Gnostic Theology, composed for the most part of Pythagorean Philosophy,
to be vain and deceitful. He had showed, in the former part of the Verse, the
Vanity of these their Pythagorean speculations from the Curiosity that
attended them: he here procedes to a more pregnant Cause, which had an
universal influence both on the Curiosity and Vanity of their Philosophy;
and that was their Pride. Vainly puffed up, i. e. swollen with Pride, as an
emty Bubble or Bladder full of nothing but Wind; which al procedes originally
from their fleshly mind, i. e. as Grotius well observes, their human knowledge or
Philosophy; which springing from their proud carnal minds tended to no other
than the puffing up and exaltation of carnal self or fleshly interest: For we
know nothing ascends higher than its springhead and origin: When the proud
fleshly mind is the source, proud fleshly self will be the center or end of al
our contemplations. 1. Cor. 8.1.
We have the like anatomy of Vain Philosophy, 1 Cor. 8.1, 2. Ver. 1,
Knowledge puffs up, but Charity edifieth. (...). He does, as some conceive,
here also strike at those Pythagorising Gnostics, who were carnal Gospellers,
but yet pretended to an high spiritual (...), or Knowledge; whence they were
called (...), Gnostics: which is the same with (...), Sophists or Wise men;
whose pretended Wisdom or Theology was nothing else but a degenerate
composition of Judaisme and Pythagorean Philosophy; which puffed them up with
a proud, vain, windy conceit of, I know not what, Mystic knowledge. Thence says
the Apostle, Knowledge puffs up, 1 Cor. 8.2.
etc. So it follows, Verse. 2, If any man thinks he knows any thing, etc.
(...), i. e. says Grotius, if any man pleases (or prides) himself in this,
That he is ingeniose, that he is learned, that he knows Dialectic Disputations,
or is skilled in Philosophy. (...) here notes one that fondly conceits,
presumes, or arrogantly persuades himself, that he knows something: It importes
a proud self flaterie and groundless presumtion of what he has not indeed. So
it follows, (...), He does in no wise know any thing as he ought to know it. i.
e. He is ignorant of the principal thing. That Knowledge is not saving which
tends not to love. To know as one ought, is to use his Knowledge for the
salvation of himself and others. The sum of al is this, That conceited, windy,
emty, speculative Knowledge or Philosophy does but puff up the mind, and sil
it with Pride, Vanity and Ostentation; which is but conceited Ignorance. And
this was an Epidemic Disease and Universal Contagion, which tainted al Pagan
Philosophy and Philosophers, though some had more skill than others to concele
their Pride and Vanities under modest Titles and Habits, as Pythagoras,
Socrates, and Diogenes the Cynic, etc. Yea this original sin of Pride and
Vanity so much reigned amongst these first Philosophers, as that they
themselves could easily discern it in each other, although they could not or
would not see it in themselves. Thus Plato and Diogenes accuse each other, as
Diogenes Laertius, in the Life of Diogenes the Cynic, informs us: Diogenes,
says he, trampled upon Plato 's Bed (where he Philosophised) saying, (...), I
tread upon Plato 's vain study. To whom Plato replies, (...), O Diogenes, how
much Pride do thou discover, in seeming not to be proud (but to tread on
others Pride)? So Antisthenes, seeing the Vessel wherein Plato's Vomit lay,
said, (...), I see Plato 's Choler, but I don't see his Pride; meaning that
Plato's Pride was too deeply rooted to be vomited up. This Spiritual Pride was
an universal contagion which infected all the Philosophers: Whence, says
Minutius Faelix, We contemn the proud looks of the Philosophers, whom we know
to be Corrupters, and Adulterers, and Tyrants, and yet always eloquent against
their own vices. We Christians) who boast not of our wisdom by habit, but keep
it in our mind, do not speak, but live great things. Now the Pride of these
Pagan Philosophers rendered their Philosophy and Imaginations vain in these
particulars. Pride brings al Divine mysteries to the measure of carnal Reason


1. In that they endeavored to measure things Reveled and Divine (concerning
which they had received some broken notices by Jewish Traditions) by their
corrupt, proud, and vain understandings. Thence, says Minutius Faelix, It is a
piece of the greatest sacrilege to seek that on the ground which thou ought
to find above. And indeed there is nothing in the World, that has been a
greater enemy to Gods Word, or Divine Revelation, than proud and vain
Philosophy: which, albeit it received the first rudiments and elements of al
its contemplations about God and Divine Mysteries from the sacred Oracles, yet
has it ever rejected, yea opposed the same, endeavoring, by its vain and
curiose searches into sacred Mysteries, to comprehend and reduce the same to
the measure of its proud conceivings. This, says Calvin, is the greatest
arrogance, not to allow God his secret Reasons, which our Reasons cannot fadome.

2. The Pride of their vain Philosophy, Pride makes men intemperate in desires
of knowledge.
appears in their intemperate desires of Knowledge, which indeed is of all the
worst intemperance. So Seneca: To desire to know more than we ought, is an high
degree of intemperance.

3. The Pride and Vanity of Pagan Philosophy appeared in their busy Disputes
and Contemplations about trifles and unprofitable matters. Pride is much busied
about trifles.
This Plato himself was sensible of, when he said, (in his Meno,) (...), We
account such mad, whom some count most wise. And Calvin pronounces universally
of such vain Philosophers, Sedulo in hoc omnes incumbunt, ne absque ratione
insipere viderentur, They al labor with all their might in this, that they might
not seem to play the fool without Reason. We find this proud vain Philosopher
notably Characterised by Paul, 1 Timothy 6.4, (...). He is puffed up (as
hydropical bodies, or Toads swollen with poison) with his aerial, proud, vain
speculations, without true solid knowledge which humbles, etc. of which
hereafter.

4. That which rendered the proud Philosophers so vain in their Disquisitions
and Inquiries, Pride exposed Philosophers to the Divine Curse.
was the peculiar curse of God upon them for their Pride. This was observed by
some of the soberest amongst themselves. For Chilo (as Diogenes Laertius) being
asked, what Jupiter did? Answered, (...), He casts down the high things, and
lifts up the low. This is more fully expressed by the Spirit of God, 1 Timothy
3.6. 1 Timothy 3.6,
Where (...), the novice in Christ's Schole is dehorted from Pride, (...), lest
being lifted up, or waxing mad, [So Physicians call (...), one that labors under
a Frenzy.] he falls into the condemnation of the Devil i. e. passively, the
Devils cursed condition, etc. Thus through the Fever of their Pride they lost
the understanding of their frail condition. God is said to resist the proud:
And thus he did those proud Philosophers, by leaving them to be entangled and
ensnared in their own proud Imaginations, and Philosophic Contemplations.

5. Hence this Pride of their hearts caused their Philosophy to determine in
Atheism, Blasphemy, Idolatry and Sensuality. Pride turned Philosophy into
a seminary of 'Blasphemie, Atheism, Idolatry, Sensuality.
For God leaving them in judgment to their own proud Imaginations, they fell
first into doutful Disputations, thence into Skeptic Conclusions, and at last
arrived unto Atheism, Blasphemy and Sensuality: for their Scepticisme ended
in Epicurisme, as we shall after show. And al proceeded from the Pride of their
hearts, according to that prophetic saying of the Psalmist, Ps. 10.4, The
wicked through the pride of his countenance. Psalm. 10.4.
(...) the Particle (...) here is causal, denoting the cause of al their
Atheism to be Pride. The Countenance is here put as that which is the Index of
the heart. The Thargum reads it, (...), his spirit. God is not in all his
thoughts, or al his thoughts are, that there is no God. This is the effect of
al his proud vain Philosophy, to believe there is no God. It is certain, that
Atheism was the effect of proud Philosophy, as hereafter.

It Is a good observation of Senault, that sober Jansenist: There is no one but
knows, that Pride has always accompanied the Sect of the Stoics, who to
elevate man, have abased God; and who often have made their Wiseman more blessed
than their Jupiter. What greater Pride can there be than this, for a man to
say, unless he be lest to his own corrupt will, he will do nothing? Which was
the case of the Stoics, and most Philosophers, who walked in the sparks of
their own fire, pleased themselves in their own abilities, both Contemplative
and Active, but had not the least regard to Gods glory. It was well observed by
Austin, That they who will ascend to God, must descend in self-abasement and
humility. The further from Pride, the nearer to God: He that ascends in
himself, descends and falls from God. Pride and Vain-glorie are the prime
elements of vain Philosophy; whereas sacred and sound Philosophy is sounded
in Humility. Ships that are heaviest laden, fail lowest: So a Mind laden with
sound Philosophy is most humble.

. 5. The Vanity of Philosophy sprang much from the carnal presumptions or
confidences of these Philosophers in their own wisdom or conceited ignorance.
Carnal confidence another cause of vain Philosophy.
This was another Master-Vice, which originally sprang from the forementioned
Pride of their hearts, and had a potent influence on the Vanity of their
Philosophy. This also is implied in Paul's Anatomy of the Pythagorising
Gnostics, Col. 2.18. Vainly puffed up. Hab. 2.4.
their proud vain Philosophy, Col. 2.18, Vainly puffed up by their fleshly
mind, i. e. by carnal presumtion and confidence on their own fleshly human
wisdom. So Hab. 2.4, we read of an heart lifted up, i. e. with its own
swelling proud confidences, or self-dependences on its own wisdom and
strength; Affected ignorance the effect of carnal presumtion.
which indeed turns the best human Knowledge into the worst ignorance: Whence,
says Seneca, (de Tranquil.) I think many might have attained to wisdom, if
they had not thought they had already attained to it. Therefore we are
unwilling to learn, because we conceit our selves already learned. If thou
desire to learn, or know any thing with profit, learn first to know thine
own ignorance. There is nothing that proud nature more affects, than to be
reputed wise; and thence it is most prone to slater it self into a fond
presumtion of its own knowledge; and so to aquiesce therein. It Is rare, that
such as are wise in their own conceit, have so much humility as to suffer
themselves to be taught by others. Whence it is accounted by wisemen better to
have little of knowledge with humility, and a teachable heart, than treasures
of Sciences with vain self-complacence and confidence. For affected Ignorance
is usually the fruit of such presumtuous confidence: When ever a man leanes on
his own understanding, he usually falls into some conceited Folly, or vain
Imaginations. This Aristotle, Rhet. l. 2. c. 14. makes the cause why young men,
or Novices, so often fall into foolish, indeliberate actions: (...), Young men
think they know althings, and thence are strong in confidences. And as this is
usually the crime of Novices in Philosophy, so was it generally of all the
Pagan Philosophers; and so the root of much Vanity in their Philosophy. Man
indeed naturally affects a kind of Divinity: he would fain (with his first
Parent Adam) be a God to himself, and thence he makes an Idol of his own
wisdom, which is an high piece of Idolatry, and therefore provokes the great
God, to leave such to al manner of foolish conceits, and vanity of
Imagination. That this was a main cause of those vain Pagan Philosophisings, is
excellently laid open by Owen, Theolog. l. 1. c. 7. The Philosophers, says he,
being instructed by the advantage of some Revelation in the works of Creation
and Providence, with some notices of the Power and Divinity of God, endeavored
with all their might to promote their (...), their own commun principes; and
this gave origin to Philosophy, etc. These their endeavors being grounded
only on the presumtion of their own wisdom and parts, proved altogether vain.
This Socrates, one of the wisest of them, seems sensible of, as Plato in his Al
ibiades brings him in thus Philosophising: Socrates's sense of his dependances
on God for light.
(...), Thou know that errors in practice come from this ignorance, that men
think they know what they know not, etc. Then he adds, When men are conscious
of their own ignorance, they are willing to be taught by others. Again, But
believe me and the famous Delphic Oracle, (...), Know thy self. This Plato, in
his Charmides, ingenuously confesses; Many have erred from their scope, (...),
by trusting to their own opinion without judgment. Again, It is a great piece
of temperance for a man to know himself. It would be a great advantage, if none
would act beyond their knowledge and strength. We seem to know althings, but
indeed we are ignorant of every thing. It is an absurd thing to Philosophise of
things we know not: When any attemtes a thing above his strength, he greatly
erres. Thus Plato, out of what he had learnt from his Master Socrates. So again
in his Legib. 5. Plato discoursing of (...), self-love; From this, say he,
procedes this great error, that al men estime their ignorance to be wisdom,
(...), whence knowing nothing, we think we know althings. Thence (adds he)
not permitting our selves to be taught what we are ignorant of, we fall into
great errors. We have indeed a great saying of Plato, in his Epinom. page 980.
showing, That we can get no true knowledge of God, but by dependence on, and
prayer to him. His words are, (...), Trusting in the Gods, pray unto them, that
thou may have right notions of the Gods. Thus it shall be, if God as a Guide
shall show us the way; only help thou with thy Prayers. Had Plato really
practiced what he here teaches of Faith, Dependence, and Prayer to the true
God, it is probable his Philosophy had not been so vain as it is. Lastly,
Plato, Legib. 4, tells us, That he who is humble and modest will adhere to Divine
Justice: (...), etc. But he that is lifted up in his own proud confidences,
(...), as though he wanted no Guide or Governer, he is deserted by God; and
being deserted disturbes others; and although he may for a while seem some
body, yet at last he is sufficiently punished by Divine Justice, etc. Which
indeed was Plato's own case, as well as the rest of the Philosophers, whose
presumtuous confidences in their own wisdom and reason proved the bane of
their Philosophy; as it proved also with the Jews, Romans 2.17, 18, 19, 20.

. 6. The Vanity of Philosophy received a great foundation and improvement
from their vain (...), The Vanity of Philosophy from its vain contentions.
or Litigations about words and trifles. For we must know, that the (...), That
vain contentiose, mode of disputing, so much adored by the Greek Philosophers,
had its foundation in the Italic or Pythagoric Schole: For the Eleatic Sect,
where it first flourished, was but a branch of the Italic: And Parmenides, with
Zeno the Eleatic, who were the great promoters of this (...), Dialectic vain
Disputation, did herein, as in other matters, Pythagorise. And the Gnostic
Christians sucked in this itching humor of vain Disputation, together with
their other Pythagorean Dogmes; which Paul does most professedly set himself to
beat down, as that which he, by a Prophetic inspiration, foresaw would prove a
mighty Engine to promote Antichrist's throne; as indeed it did, when the
Schole-Divinitie, which is wholly composed of vain Disputations, came in
fashion. Therefore Paul lays in many precautions against this vain (...), or
Litigiose Dialectic Sophistry, hatched in the Pythagorean and Eleaatic Schools,
and foisted into the Christian Theology by the Gnostics, and after them by the
Scholastic Divines. And the seat of our Apostles Dehortations against this itch
of vain Disputation lies manely in his Epistles to Timothy, who, as supposed,
was very much infested by those Pythagorising Gnostics. So, 1 Timothy 6.3.
1 Timothy 6.3, (...), If any one bring in any other Doctrine: Which was the
design of the Pythagorising Gnostics, who abounded at Ephesus, where Timothy
had his residence, and endeavored to compose a new Mystic Theology, out of
Judaisme and Pythagorean Philosophy, tempered with some Christian Dogmes.
Thence it follows, and consent not to wholesome words; (...), says Grotius,
answers to (...), which is a Temple-Phrase, belonging to such as approach to
the Altar, as Lev. 9.7: as if our Apostle had said, These Gospel-Dogmes are
sacred things, and ought to be handled with as much reverence as the Jewish
Sacreds were. They are indeed (...), wholesome words, without any corrupt or
poisonous mixtures; not like the Gnostic Infusions, composed of the venomous
ingredients of Rabbinical Fables and Pythagorean Philosophy. And to the
Doctrine according unto godliness; (...), and, is here as often elsewhere
exegetic: For the words of Christ truly are a Doctrine tending unto
godliness, whereas those Pythagorean Gnostic contentions tended only to
profaneness and licentiousness. (...), i. e. which is both agreeable and
conducible unto godliness, as Tit. 1.1. Then it follows ver. 4. He is proud
knowing nothing. i. e. He is as an emty vessel filled with nothing but airy
speculations, 1 Timothy 6.4.
which conduce nothing to true godliness, (as before. 4, 5;) But doting about
questions; (...), i. e. Physic, Dialectic, or Metaphysic Quaestions and
Disputes touching their Aeones, or suchlike unintelligible Mysteries, which no
way conduce to edification. And strife of words, (...) i. e. says Grotius,
There were many disputations amongst the Philosophers merely about words:
namely Aristotle and Plato call such things as conduce to the wel-being of the
Body and Life, Goods: The Stoic will not have them called so, but (...),
Conducibles. The Platonist and Aristotelian, say, A wise man has mercy: Illud
semper egerunt sectae usque ab initio originis suae, ut quocunque modo a
cateris distarent: unde quod uni placuit alteri displicuit: Omnia pugnabant
adversis frontibus. Horn. Hist. Phil. l. 7. c. 13.
The Stoic will not allow that he has mercy, but that he spares. The greatest
part of the Stoic Disputations, says Cicero, is spent about words. What more
vitiose than to intend a controversy merely about Words? We may add to these
the (...), in the Pythagoric and Eleatic Schools, the (...), the
probationatory, or problematic disputes in the old Academie begun by Socrates
and Plato: Also Aristotle's Dialectic Disputations, with all the sharp
contentions in the New Academies, and by the Skeptics, etc. which were al but
so many (...), or needless strifes about words. See more of this in Plutarch,
(...), concerning the various placites, or opinions of Philosophers.

Whence follows Envy, The effects of these verbal Disputes, Strifes, Railings,
etc.
Strife, Railings, evil Surmisings: These, says Grotius, were frequent amongst
Philosophers. (...), Envy, was the natural product of their (...), or strife
about words. What Envyings and Emulations were there betwixt the Italic and
Ionic Sect, the Pythagoreans and Eleatics, the Platonics and the Peripatetics,
with the other Sects. Hence follows, (...), Strife, or Contention: Such was
their (...), Contentiose Logic, in the Eleatic and Megaric Schools, which was
frequently attended with railings; (...), Blasphemings of each others
reputation: al which ended in Evil surmisings. (...), i. e. says Grotius, evil
opinions or vain Philosophy: For (...) is here put for (...), to think. Such
were the opinions of Diagoras, who held there was no God: Of Epicurus, who
asserted that God regarded not human affairs; which also seems to be the
opinion of Aristotle, (...). Such also were the opinions of the New Academics
and Skeptics, who held nothing to be knowable or perceptible; nothing to be in
it self shameful, etc. Such were the fruits of this vain (...), which we find
excellently set forth by Plato in his Repub. 7. from page 532, to 539; where
discoursing professedly of Dialectic Disputes or Logic, and having opened the
nature of it, that it is (...) and (...), wherein we proceed from some lower
Hypothesis, to the first Principes, etc. he procedes to show the Qualities of a
good Logician, and evil fruits of contentiose Litigations. And his general
direction is, That men study not Logic before they are Thirty years aged:
for, says he, young men engaging in Dialectic Disputes, abuse this Art to
contradictions each of other; and so sometimes overcomming, and sometimes being
overcome, at last they come to believe nothing: whereas elder Persons, seeking
not childlike glory but truth, are more moderate and grave; but young men
(...), etc. being always used to contradictions, affect, like little Dogs,
mutually to overcome each other. 1 Timothy 6.5.
Thus Plato. It follows 1 Timothy 6.5, Perverse Disputings, (...). Some Copies
read it, (...), which to Grotius seems the truest. (...) is properly a
Philosophic term, and signifies their more solemn Disputations: Whence
Gellius calls the very place where they disputed (...). Paul adds (...), which
usually in composition signifies perverse or not right, as in (...) so Jam.
1.22, (...), deceiving themselves with a Paralogisme or false dangerous
reasoning and dispute. Hence (...) properly signifies a perverse and inane
Disputation or Exercitation, a curiose, jejune concertation. It Is rendered here
by the Syriac, (...), and the conflict of the Sons of Man: Or, and the mutual
attrition; for those Sophists mutually brought down each other, and by their
Scab infected each other. Chrysostom, and Theophylact out of him, render it
confrications: For those vain Sophists mutually rubbed each other, like scabbed
Sheep, and by their Philosophic confrications or rubbings mutually infected
each other. Thence it follows, (...), i. e. having their minds altogether
averse from piety, which is the greatest corruption. Such were these
Pythagorising Gnostics, who albeit they pretended to a sublime mystical (...)
or knowledge, yet were they professed enemies to Piety, being indeed guilty of
unheard of uncleanness and wickednesses. So it follows, (...), i. e.
destitute of al true saving practic knowledge, notwithstanding al their
Pythagoric Dogmes and Institutes. (...), i. e. making use of the Christian
Religion only as a blind, or politic medium to promove their gain and cover
over their sensual designs: Their godliness lies in gain, here lies their
Religion or measure of good and evil: whereas, says he, ver. 6, Verse. 6.
Godliness with contentement is great gain to a sincere Christian. This is
added to the former by an allusive Antanaclasis, as Glassius; or by an
Epanorthosis, as Schmidius. The Pseudo-Christians estimed Gain Godliness, i.
e. They by their perverse Philosophic Disputations wrested the Scripture and
Religion, so as to make al subserve their private Gain: These Nazianzone styles
(...), such as Hucstered and made Morehandise of Christ. But the Apostle
assures us, That godliness is the best gain, i. e. it brings the best profit
to men's souls. Thus we see how Paul does here anatomise this Philosophic (...)
or contentiose Logic, as the pregnant cause of their Philosophic Emulations,
Contentions, Railings, Evil opinions, and al manner of vain Philosophisings.
And indeed nothing more natural than that such perverse Disputings should
determine in Scepticisme and Atheism, as Jansenius has well observed of the
Scholemens Disputes. Therefore our Apostle, in the end of this Epistle, does
further inculcate this his Exhortation against these vain Disputes, 1 Timothy
6.20, O Timothy, 1 Timothy 6.20.
keep that which is committed to thy trust, (...) being a decomposite of (...),
and (...), signifies a Depositum committed to the trust of another. This
Depositum, which Timothy was so charily to keep, was the great Doctrine of the
Gospel; which he calls a Depositum, because it is committed by Christ to his
Ministers in charge. So 2 Timothy 1.14, we find the word (...) used in the same
sense, 1 Timothy 1.18. 2 Timothy 2.2. So in the Book called Musar the precepts of the
Law are called a Depositum, as some observe. Thence it follows, avoiding
profane and vain bablings, (...), according to the Glossarie, is the same with
(...) vain speech. (...) here is either a clamor about vain matters, or of vain
words; such as agree not with the form of sound Doctrine. Chrysostom
understands it of novel words and forms of speech introduced. Theophylact here
renders it (...), vain discourse or Disputation; which is therefore vain,
because it is matter, form, concomitants and effects were al vain and
fruitless: It was conversant only about vain matters, Genealogies of the
Aeones, etc. and it tended only to vain ends, vain glory, etc. Further, he
says these bablings were (...), not only vain but profane, i. e. they being
foisted into sacred Theology, not by Gods appointment, but from their own
inventions, merely to symbolise with Pagar. Philosophers, etc. they were thence
profane. It follows, (...), and oppositions. The Greeks interpret (...) by
(...), Contradictions. Much of the glory of these vain Disputers lay in their
faculty of contradicting each other. The Peripatetic studies how he might
contradict the Academic; the Stoic opposes both the Peripatetic and the
Platonist; the New-Academic and Skeptic al other Sects. Thus were they involved
in perpetual contradictions; and the fruit of al these Litigations was no other
than a false Science or vain Philosophy. So it follows, (...), of Science
falsely so called: i. e. Of spinose, frivolous questions, such as assume the
name of Science, but deserve not the same. You see here (says Grotius) how
ancient the name of Gnostics was; which these Philosophers mingling with the
Christian Churches assumed to themselves, despising al others as rude and
ignorant, but boasting of their knowledge falsely so termed. Clement Alex.
says, this Epistle was upon this account rejected by the Gnostics; because
they saw themselves herein described to the life. (...), As Pride and vain
Opinion has hurt Philosophy, so false, or falsely so called Knowledge, has
spoiled their Knowledge. Thence he produces this Text. True Knowledge is that
which profits to eternal life. Whence ver. 21 he adds, which some
professing, have erred concerning the faith: 2 Timothy 6.21.
(...). i. e. These Pythagorising Gnostics, being swollen with proud conceits,
and presumtuose confidences of their own pretended Knowledge and contentiose
Philosophy, have deserted the true Orthodoxe Christian Faith. Paul gives us
much the same account in 2 Timothy 2.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23. touching these
Gnostic (...) or vain Disputes, of which in the following Chapter. At present
we may take notice that our Apostle, though he strike immediately at the
Gnostics who abounded then at Ephesus, yet in them he does propheticly strike
through the Schole-Divines, who have, by their vain Aristotelic (...), rendered
not only Philosophic but Divinity also vain and useless.

. 7. Another cause of the Vanity of al Philosophy, Opiniatrctie and a
Dogmatising hum or, its origin and and vanity.
was the Opiniatretie and Dogmatising humor of the Philosophers. This indeed
has an intimate and causal connection with the forementioned vain Disputation.
For Self-love produces in us al a fond conceit of, and regard unto our own
Phenomenon and Principes: The contradiction of others is as fuel to feed this
self-flatering opinion of our own conceived notions. This Self-love or flaterie
being engaged to maintain what it has undertaken, sets the wits on work to
contrive, study and dispute for the defense of its espoused persuasion: And
the effect of al is a fixed Opiniatretie or abounding in our own sense, and
stiff adherence to our own judgments; so that in this case men's stiffenesse
in adhereing to their own opinions or persuasions, is not from the force and
strength of the reasons on which they are grounded, but rather from the force
of their own violent Self-love. For when the strength of adherence to any
opinion arises from grounded reasons, it will be either stronger or weaker,
according to the force of those Reasons on which our Opinions are grounded: so
that if we cannot show some proper motive or particular reason, as strong as
the Opinion we espouse, it is apparent that the said Opinion is founded on
assectionate Opiniatretie rather than on grounded Reason. This was the general
fate of those Greek Philosophers, specially of the Pythagoreans, with whom
(...) he said it, had the force of a first Principe or the most binding Reason.
They generally affected (...), to be slaves to their own Hypothesis, rather
than (...), to sacrifice to truth. Aristotle gives us a good character of a
Philosopher, that he should be a slave to truth, (...), to the abandoning his
own persuasions: which is quite contrary to this philosophic humor of
Dogmatising Opiniatretie, which makes men to abandon Truth for the preservation
of their own Phenomenon. This seems struck at by the Apostle in that Col. 2.20,
Col. 2.20.
Why are ye subject to ordinances? (...), i. e. Why do you suffer your selves
to be imposed on by those Pythagorean Gnostics, who would fain bring you under
the yoke and bondage of their Pythagorean Dogmes, ver. 21, 22. (...) among the
Graecians signified primarilie a placit, or confirmed, established opinion of
any Sect; and thence an Institute, Edict, Decree. Whence (...) primarilie
importes to give a sentence, to impose an opinion, or tenaciously to adhere to
an opinion. Thence it is opposed to (...), to suspend assent, or to hesitate:
which kind of Suspension and Hesitation the Academics and Skeptics affected. It
was a great question amongst the Philosophers, whether those of the Old
Academie, namely Plato and his followers, might be said (...) and it is
generally concluded in the affirmative. Yea some would bring in those of the
New Academie, who seemed most averse from this humor, under this mode of
Dogmatising or Opiniatretie: For, say they, their stiff and tenacious
adhereing to this Persuasion and Dogme, That there is nothing knowable, is a
great degree of Dogmatising. Though the Skeptics endeavored to avoid this
imputation of Dogmatising, by affirming, That they gave not a dogmatic assent
to those Skeptic propositions, viz. Nothing is knowable, I assert nothing, etc.
Yet certain it is they were too opiniatre, tenacious, and stiff in renouncing
those (...), commun notions of a Deity so deeply engraven on human nature,
(for their Sceptisme determined in Atheism) which is an hellish piece of
Opiniatretie or Dogmatising.

. 8. Another poisonous root which infected and tainted al Pagan Philosophy,
Carnal policy of Philosophers.
was the carnal policy of their Philosophers; which appeared many ways. (1.)
In their conceling the Authors and origin of those Scriptural Traditions they
borrowed from the Jews. (2.) In their clothing these Jewish Traditions with a
Grecian fabulose Garb, thereby to make them seem their own. (3.) In conceling
their own Ignorance of those Jewish Dogmes, on which they so boldly
Philosophised under mystical, unintelligible Terms and Fables, like Apollo's
Oracles, etc. (4.) In converting al their traditional and invented Philosophy,
to a subservience to their carnal Interest or superstitiose Idolatrical
designs, etc. These and suchlike were the branches of their Carnal Policy,
which rendered their Philosophy so vain and useless. We find this Philosophic
craft well described in the Platonic definitions: (...), Craft is an affection
whereby he that has it is enabled to design and promove his private end.
Psalm. 112.113.
But we have it more fully unbowelled by the Spirit of God, specially Psalm.
119.113, I hate vain thoughts. (...) French: les Discourse, i. e. the vain and
fraudulent Discourses of carnal sapience, contrary to the simplicity of Faith
and that obedience due to God. So again, ver. 118, for their tromperie is
falsehood, (...), Ver. 118.
i. e. their cautelose Artifices, on which they trust, shall in the end deceive
themselves, they being not able by all their cunning to avoid thy judgment: or,
they are to thee abominable, in as much as in all their train and politic wiles
there is nothing but fraud. So again, verse. 128, Therefore I approve as right
(...) al thy commandments of al things, but I hate every false way, i. e. al
Carnal Policy and shifts. The like ver. 163, I hate and abhor lying, i. e.
politic craft, etc. And the Apostle seems to strike directly at this Carnal
Policy of the Greek Philosophers, 1 Cor. 2.6, Not the wisdom of this world,
nor of the Princes of this world, that come to naught. 1 Cor. 2.6.
Grotius and Deodate understand this last clause of false reason of state, or
politic prudence of the worlds Grandees, which directly opposes the Kingdom
of Christ, Matt. 11.25. 1 Cor. 2.2. And we need not dout, but that the Apostle
here takes in the worldly wisdom and politic prudence not only of Statesmen,
but also of the Philosophers who passed for Princes and Rulers of this World,
specially the Pythagoreans, who were great Statesmen and Politicians as well as
Philosophers. This Carnal Policy was the great engine of the Gnostics, those
sensual professors, who, to symbolise and keep fair both with Jews and
Gentiles, composed a politic and flesh-pleasing Theology of worldly Rudiments
and Elements, partly Pythagorean and partly Jewish, as before on Col. 2.18, 19,
20, 21, wherein Antichrist and his Adherents (as in other Institutes) have
exactly followed them, as hereafter.

. 9. The great judicial Cause, which rendered al Pagan Philosophy vain and
cursed, Judiciarie blindness and hardness.
was Judiciarie Hardness of heart and Blindness of mind; or Gods delivering
those Pagan Philosophers up to spiritual Occecation, Blindness and Hardness
of heart. This was the effect of all the former causes, and a great cause of al
their vain Philosophy, as we find it fully laid down by the Apostle, Romans
1.18, 21, 22, 28.
Romans 1.18, 21, etc. Verse. 18, he says, The wrath of God was reveled from
heaven, against such as hold the truth in unrighteousness. We must know, the
Apostle in these Verses discourses of the Gentile (...) or Philosophers, as
ver. 22. And I conceive principally of the Pythagoreans, who were of the Italic
Sect, and therefore flourished at Rome. Now of these Paul says, That the wrath
of God was reveled against them, because they held the truth in
unrighteousness, i. e. whatever knowledge of Divine truth they had acquired
either from Jewish Tradition, or from the Improvements of their own commun
Principes, by which they were capacitated to contemplate the invisible
perfections of God in the visible creatures, it was al captivated by, and made
subservient to their lusts; whence God gave them up to their own vain
Imaginations and foolish hearts, as verse. 21, Because when they knew God, they
glorified him not as God, i. e. Their knowledge was not active. Neither were
thankeful, i. e. They ascribed not the glory and praise of their Philosophic
contemplations unto God, they owned not him as the Sun of righteousness,
whence al these rays of human knowledge sprang: but they attributed al their
Philosophic seize to their own parts, Sagacitie and Disquisitions; and so
improved al for the greatening and advancing of themselves, their Idolwisdome,
etc. Whence it follows: (...), They waxed vain in their Discourses, Reasonings
or Philosophisings: For (...) is a Philosophy term, the manner of Disputing
amongst the Ancients both Jews and Grecians being by Dialogues. The meaning is,
al their Philosophic reasonings and disputes proved by Gods secret judicial
dereliction and permission of them vain, yea cursed. And thence it follows,
(...). i. e. (says Grotius) Such as the sin was, such was the punishment. They
shook off the light of Reason and God took away the remainders, as Ephesians. 4.18.
So verse. 22, Professing themselves wise. (...) i. e. glorying in their wisdom.
(...), they were made fools: God in his righteous judgment befooling them.
Which is more fully explained, verse. 28, as they did not like, etc. Here is an
elegant Paranomasia or allusion in the words, (...) and (...) they reprobate or
reject God in their knowledge, and God gives them up to a reprobate or drossy
mind. So we read of (...), reprobate money, i. e. drossy, etc. Justly does God
leave such to a reprobate mind who reprobate him.

10. We might mention also, Idolatrical inclination.
as another fruitful womb of vain Philosophy amongst the Pagans, the universal
Inclination of al, more or less, unto Idolatry and Superstition, as Romans
1.23, 24, 25, 26, which is, Act. 17.18, applied to their Philosophers, (...)
but of this more in the effects of vain Philosophy, B. 2. Chap. 1.

11. Lastly, Fabulous Imitation.
Mythologic or fabulose imitation of Divine Truths and Mysteries might also be
mentioned, as that which had a great influential causalitie on the vanity of
the Pythagorean, as of al other Philosophic: Of which we have already largely
treated in the causes of Mythologic Philosophy, Part. 2. B. 2. C. 2.. 3, etc.

. 1. WE have hitherto only considered the vanity of Philosophy in its Causes
and Roots; The vanity and corruption of (...), or Logic.
we shall now proceed to demonstrate the said vanity of Philosophy from its
own essential Idea or Nature, Parts, and Proprieties. The essential Idea,
Nature, and parts of Philosophy (as of other things) consist in its Matter and
Form; both of which have great mixture of vanity in them. As for the matter of
Philosophy, it contains Naturals, Morals, and Supernaturals. Natural
Philosophy comprehends Logic, Physics, and Mathematics. Concerning Logic, we
have no full mention of the Pythagoreans being much versed herein; yet are we
not without some concluding, though indirect Arguments of their skill herein.
For Porphyrie tells us, That Pythagoras had, besides his (...), also (...), a
plain and familiar way of Philosophising. And we have already shown, how that
Parmenides and Zeno the Eleatics (who belonged to the Italic Sect) did much
Pythagorise, as in other points, so likewise, as we may presume, in this of
Logic, of which they are thought to be the first Inventors, at least great
promotors; as it appears by their (...), that contentiose mode of Disputing,
for which Zeno has been so famous ever since. As for the vanity of this
ancient Dialectic or Logic mode of Philosophising, it has been already in part
demonstrated in the foregoing Chapter,. 6. But in as much as I find the Spirit
of God so much in invectives against this piece of vain Philosophy,
(foreseeing that it would prove, as abused by Scholastic Divines, a main engine
to pull down the Kingdom of Christ, and settle Antichrist upon his Throne;) I
shall follow the sacred method herein, by endeavors to give farther
demonstration of the vanity of this (...), contentiose Logic, thereby, if it
may be, to open in any degree a door to some more useful kind of Logic in the
Schools of Christ. And lest I should be thought singular herein, I shall follow
the steps of Lud. Vives, Grotius, Jansenius, yea of the Philosophers
themselves, in opening the vanity of this contentiose Logic. We find the
Apostle accusing the Sophists, (and I conceive particularly the Pythagoreans)
of a vanity in their reasonings, Romans 1.21. (...), They became vain in their
disputes. Romans 1, 21.
For the way of Disputation in the Old Academie was by Dialogues; which mode, I
presume, they traduced from the Jewish Schools. And thus Grotius understands
these reasonings here: As the Academics disputed for and against every thing.
Thus is truth lost by altercation, Jer. 11.5, by great Essays to act the
greatest trifles; such as are not only unprofitable, but damnable to themselves
and others, Esa. 41.29. We find the same word used, Phil. 2.14. Disputings.
Phil. 2.14.
(...), says Grotius, here seems to be bitter railings about matters no way
belonging to godliness, of which there were many amongst the Philosophers,
specially the Aristotelics, whereof there were many in Macedon, where Philippi
stood. So 1 Timothy 1.6, Paul mentions some who had turned aside, 1 Timothy 1.6.
(...), i. e. to unprofitable dissertation or disputation. They who use such
are called (...), Tit. 1.10. This, 1 Timothy 6.4, he terms (...), as ver. 20,
(...), which he opposes to sound Doctrine, 1 Timothy 1.6. We find all this fully
laid open and confirmed, 2 Timothy 2.14, etc. (...). i. e. be thine Auditors daily
remembrancer of this. The Hebrew express it by (...). Paul charge him to
inculcate this continually on his hearers; yea to charge them as before the
Lord, (...), That they strive not about words to no profit. That this (...) is
the same with the Philosophers (...), 1 Timothy 6.4, 20.
Contentiose Logic, we have proved from 1 Timothy 6.4, 20, Chap. 1.. 6. He is the
more warm in his exhortation against this (...), because it was not only
unprofitable, but destructive to their Christian Faith and Communion. So it
follows, (...), to the subversion of the hearers. For, says Grotius, the
hearers by such strifes are divided into parties: they lose mutual love. It
answers to (...), Eversion, is in the Glossarie, Subversion, Destruction. This
Paul gives as a good Antidote against the contagiose infusions of the
Pythagorising Gnostics, who by their (...), and strife about words insinuated
much of their poisonous Doctrine, as the Scholemen after them their
Antichristian Dogmes. Our Apostle inculcates this caution, ver. 16, calling
these strifes, (...), which he says, ver. 17, eat like a gangrene; and ver.
23, foolish and unlearned questions which gender to strife, etc. of which
hereafter. This (...), Eristic Logic, began, as we have once and again hinted,
in the Italic and Eleatic Schools, and was improved by those of the Megaric
Sect, Euclid, etc. It was also of some use in the Old Academie, The origin of
this Eristic Legic.
passing under the notion of (...) and of great use amongst the New Academies
and Skeptics. But none gave so great an advance and perfection to this
Dialectic litigiose mode of Philosopising, as Aristotle; who having naturally a
mighty Logical Acumen, and the same much improved by study and artificial
disputes, made it his business to carp at al such opinions of his
predecessors, as were not parallel with his artificial Scheme or Method of
Philophising. He spared not his own Master Plato, nor any other whose Dogmes
were not commensurate with his Phenomenon. And foreseeing that posterity might
with the same censorious Rod strike at him, with which he had struck at his
foregoers; to prevent the same, he reduced his Philosophy to the most acurate
Method, his Logical head could invent; and withal frames a Logic answerable
thereto; which he intended not only as a Key or Organ to open the way to his
Philosophy, but also as a Shield or Buckler to preserve the same from such
blows or objections which posterity might offer against it. And indeed (as
Learned Owen has observed in his Praefat. Theolog.) Aristotle, in the whole of
his Philosophy, seems to design and study more how to defend himself from the
objections of others, than to evince truth; which rendered his followers more
skilful in hatching intricate controversies, subtle nice distinctions, and
wrangling Sophistry, than true solid Philosophy. But yet to give Aristotle
his due, I think it may be made evident, that he was not the main Author of
this Sophistic kind of Disputation, which now reigns in our Schools, but rather
the Arabians, Aristotle's Logic sophisticated by the Arabians and Scholemen.
Averroes, Avincenna, his Commentators; who, being wholly unacquainted with the
Greek Tongue, were fain to depend upon the versions of Aristotle, which being
very imperfect, left them under great darkness and ignorance touching
Aristotle's mind and sense; whence there sprang a world of unintelligible
Terms and Distinctions, with as many Sophistic Disputes and Controversies.
These the Scholemen (more barbarous than the Arabians) greedily licked up (as
the Minor Poets Homers vomit) and incorporated with their Theology; which
filled the Universities of France, (where this Schole Divinity was first
broached) and England (which had continual recourse to Paris for Learning) with
nothing but vain (...), or strifes about words, instead of solid Philosophy
and Divinity; far worse than what was to be found in the Pagan Schools: Which
vain itch of Disputation has proved the Scab of the Church, as Erasmus,
Ludovicus Vives, Sir Thomas More, the Lord Bacon, Sir Henry Wotton, Jansenius
and Owen, with other Learned men have well observed. Yea, A general consent
against Eristic Logic.
the vanities of this Dialectic Sophistry was observed and decried by many of
the old Philosophers. Both the Sect of the Cynics and Stoics (as Diogenes
Laertius observes) took away Dialectic Philosophy as vain, holding that our
end is, (...), to live virtuosely; which this wrangling Logic no way conduces
to. Aristo Chius the Stoic (says Diogenes) compared Dialectic Dissertations to
a Spiders Web, which is artificially made but yields no profit. And Plato,
Repub. 7. gives us his judgment against this (...), etc. It seems to me that
there should be no controversy about words amongst such as have so great
matters to discourse of. Wiclef was much offended at this kind of Sophistic
litigation in matters of Faith: So was Calvin, who affirms, That whoever does
pertinaciously strive about words, soments some secret Poison. But in this age
none has more amply, fully, and learnedly opened the vanity of this
Sophistic, Eristic mode of Disputation, so much Idolized by the Scholemen, than
Jansenius, in his August. Tom. 2. Lib. Proaem. Cap. 28, and elsewhere; with
Owen, in his Praefat. to his Theolog. also, Lib. 6. Cap. 7. Page 512 unto 520.
I have insisted the longer on the vanity and corruption of Sophistic Logic,
because it has been, and still is greatly abused and noxious in some of our
reformed Universities, to the corrupting the minds of many wel-disposed young
Students. I must confess my self to have been too far in love with and
entangled in this Snare; which had not the Lord by his sovereign hand of
free grace broken and delivered me from, might have proved the ruin, not only
of my Studies, but Soul. Thou Wilt therefore, Reader, pardon this invective
against the corruption of vain Logic; which designs not the utter Rejection,
but Reformation of Logic in Reformed Schools. We shall conclude this Digression
with the Apostles Exhortation, 1 Cor. 14.20, Brethren, be not children in
understanding. 1 Cor. 14.20.
It Is, says Grotius, the property of Children to make an ostentation in
things unprofitable. But in understanding be men, (...), i. e. like persons
adult, Ephesians. 4.13, who are ashamed to play as Children with baubles and Rattles.

. 2. The vanity of Pagan Philosophy discovered it self much in their Physics,
The Vanity of their Physics.
which are at best dark and cloudy, but for the most part fabulose, grounded
only upon some broken Traditions, traduced from Moses's description of the
Creation, Genesis 1, and Job's Discourses of Meteors, etc. with Solomon's Natural
Philosophy of Plants, Animals, etc. which being but imperfectly traduced unto,
and more imperfectly understood by these blind Philosophers, they turned al
these Jewish Traditions of the origin of the Universe, of the first principes
of Bodies, of Plants, of Animals, etc. into mere Fables, or unintelligible
Speculations and Controversies. This vanity of their Physics our Apostle seems
to strike at (inclusively if not exclusively) 1 Cor. 1.20, 1 Cor. 1, 20.
Where is the disputer of this world? (...): This (says Grotius) strikes at
the Inquisitor or searcher into the natures of things, which the Hebrews call
(...) of this world, i. e. the Physiologist. This study they are wont to call
(...), which properly answers unto (...), Disputation: So Baruch, 3.23, etc.
(...), are Physiologists. The Apostle Paul chooses to call him (...), a
Disputer, rather than (...) an Inquisitor, (as Baruch) because their Physic
questions were wont to be ventilated or agitated by many Disputations, which is
(...). Hence the Syriac Version renders it, (...), Investigator; and the Arabic
by a word that signifies Scrutator: Because such Physiologists spent their
whole time in acute Researches and Inquisitions into the Bowels of nature,
which afforded infinite vain Disputes. And indeed their Physics did abound with
almost as much (...), or Verbal, Captiose, Sophistic Questions and
Controversies, as their (...), or Logic: which made the Cynics, as also the
Stoics (who symbolised much in this as in other points) to reject Physics or
Natural Philosophy as well as Logic. Socrates also seems to be much of the same
persuasion, who perceiving how much his Predecessors, Thales, etc. (who were
generally Physiologists) had abused Physics, addictes himself chiefly to Moral
Philosophy. The like is reported of Padre Paul, that great Venetian, who
finding the vanity of contemplative Philosophy, converted his studies to
Active, or Morality. But it follows in the same verse 20, Has not God made
foolish the wisdom of this world? (...), from (...) a Fool or Madman, 1 Cor.
1.20.
answering to the Hebrew (...), signifies here to convince of folly, or make to
appear as such, according to the import of Verbes in Hiphil amongst the
Hebrews; as if he had said: has not God made al those pompose contemplations
of these proud Philosophists (who have pried into the Bowels of Nature for
hidden Philosophy) to appear to be foolish and vain? in that they have not as
yet, by all their Natural Philosophy, attained to any true notion and
discovery of the first Principe or God of nature, which is the chief end of al
natural as well as other Philosophy? So it follows verse. 21: For after that in
the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God. (...), The wisdom of God
(says Grotius) he here calls, That knowledge of God, which results from the
contemplation of Natures Bowels. This answers to that Romans 1.20, Romans 1.20.
The visible works of God have impressed upon their natures certain visible
stamps or legible Characters of the invisible glories of God, which these
purblind Physiologists could not, by all their natural Inquisitions, come to any
serious reverential acknowlegement of. So much is implied in (...), as it is
used in the same sense, Joh. 1.10, and answers to (...), Romans 1.21. Al their
anatomisings of Natures bowels could not give them any true Idea or notion of
the first Principe or God of Nature. Which gives us an evident demonstration,
that al their Natural Wisdom was but folly, because it reached not its first
Principe and last end. Therefore it follows, It pleased God by the foolishness
of preaching to save them that believe. 1 Cor. 1.20.
i. e. Our Gospel, which seems folly to these Sophists, or Naturalists, has
availed more to the knowledge of God, than al their Physiologic Contemplations.
The same v. 27. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound
the wise: i.e. Our Gospel, which seems foolish in the worlds eye, in regard of
the discoveries it makes of God, leaves a blush and confusion on all the vain
Contemplations and Philosophy of these proud Naturalists. We find the like
encomium of Gospel Light and depression of Natural Philosophy, 1 Cor. 2.6.
1 Cor. 2.6, Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: Yet not the
wisdom of this world. (...), i. e. (faies Grotius) not that Physic or Natural
Philosophy, of which above Chap. 1.20, etc. This great vanity and folly,
which attended the Natural Contemplations or Philosophy of these Pagan
Physiologists, proceeded not from any defect in the objective wisdom, or light
of Nature, but from the subject; the darkness, pride, Romans 1.21.
lusts, and vanity of their hearts, as Romans 1.20, 21. The visible works of God
have as well since, as before the Fall, sensible images, or visible gloriose
Ideas of the invisible glories of God, his Wisdom, Power, and Goodness
stamped on their Beings and Operations; but the most acute Philosophers (like
Seneca's fool, who went up and down his house complaining the rooms were dark,
when as the darkness lay in her eyes), could but go up and down groping after
God, by their Physic contemplations, as Act. 17.27. Natural Philosophy the
cause of Idolatry.
Yea, the most sharp-sighted of these Heathen Philosophers, though by the
Divine assistance of some influential rays of commun illumination, they espied
some vestigia or obscure impresses of Gods gloriose Wisdom, Power and
Goodness shining in created emanations on his Works; yet were they so far from
glorifying God as God, and giving thankful acknowlegement of that commun light
they had received, Romans 1.21, 23.
(according to Romans 1.21.) as that they changed the glory of this
incorruptible God into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds,
etc. Romans 1.21, 23. i. e. they idolized those Divine Virtues, Powers and
Excelences, which they found in the Creatures. Not that the Philosophers or
wiser Heathens made the Creatures the ultimate object of their worship; no,
that gross Idolatry was peculiar to the Mythologic Poetic Theology: But the
great Idolatry of these foolish sophists was, that where they espied any
eminent Divine Quality or Power shining in the creature, they idolized that
creature so far, as to make it a Mediator or medium of their worship performed
to the great God. This they caled (...), Natural Theology, we rather,
Idolatry, which was the fruit of their Natural Philosophy; of which more
hereafter.

. 3. What has been discovered of the vanity, The vanity of the Mathematics.
yea Idolatry of the Physiologists, is applicable to the Mathematicians, both
Pythagorean, as well as other. Indeed the Mathematics seem to be the soundest,
the most pleasant, and most useful piece of their Natural Philosophy; yet it
has not been exemt from much corruption and vanity. For 1. It had the same
cursed effect on their corrupt foolish minds, as that Natural Physiologie
before mentioned: namely those blind Mathematicians, by continual Astronomic
contemplations of those gloriose Celestial bodies, fell first into deep
admiration of them, Astronomy the cause of Idolatry.
their excellent composure and perfection, their excellent virtues and powerful
influences on al sublunaries, their admirable order and harmonious regular
motions. These and suchlike eminent qualities, which shone so brightly, could
not (and that justly) but fill them with Admiration. And this Admiration, which
should have led them to admire infinitely more the Creator and Conserver of
these gloriose creatures, was so far from having such an influence, as that it
drew their Idol-framing hearts to set down and terminate their Adoration on
these creatures, the Sun, Moon and Stars, etc. And this Idolising these
Celestial creatures as Gods opened also a door to their Judicial Astrology, or
the black Devilish Art of Divination by the Stars, wherein the Pythagoreans
pretended to have a more than ordinary skill; which Pythagoras brought with him
from the Chaldeans, who were the first that fell into this piece of Idolatry or
Star-worship, and that from their Astronomic observations and admirations of
these Celestial Bodies; as we have before shown in the origin of the Chaldean
Philosophy, from Job. 31.26, 27. P. 2. B. 1. C. 4.. 3, 4. Of which more
hereafter.

2. Another great Corruption which attended their study of the Mathematics, 2.
Of Atheism.
was, that it determined in Atheism, and that two manner of ways; (1)
Indirectly and Consequentially, in that it brought them first into Polytheisme,
or belief of many Gods; which had this fate attending it, that at last it led
them to Atheism, to believe there was no God: for Polytheisme naturally
degenerates into Atheism. (2) But the study of the Mathematics has this more
direct influence on blind proud hearts to lead them into Atheism, in that
Mathematicians being wholly versed in Demonstrations, and those for the most
part ocular and most evident, they cannot bring their proud minds to stoop or
assent to any thing, no not to Divine Revelation, without a Demonstration. This
made Aristotle, who had a Mathematic head, to reject all the Oriental Traditions
which his Ancestors Thales, Pythagoras, and Plato had gathered up, touching the
origin of things and Divine matters; and rather to believe an Eternity of
matter, because those Jewish Traditions were not backed with Demonstrative
Arguments. This also made the Epicureans and Stoics reject Paul's new Doctrine,
(albeit they seem at first a little tickled with the novilty of it) because his
Testimony was not backed with Demonstrative Arguments; though indeed Paul gave
them sufficient Demonstrations, had they had eyes to see them, Act. 17.18, to
30. This Mathematic humor was that which made the Grocians generally offended
at the Gospel, accounting it but foolishness, because it was not proved by
Demonstrative Reasons and Arguments, as Paul frequently observes, specially 1
Cor. 1.20, 21. and 2.6. of which before. And indeed this has been the sad fate
of some great Mathematicians of this, and of former ages, who being wholly
taken up in Demonstrations, expect the same in Divine matters; and not finding
that footing their Atheistic hearts expect for their Mathematic fantasies to
build upon, in order to a Demonstration of the Scriptures authority, etc. they
reject al Divine Revelations, yea al true and found notions of a Deity and of
the Creation, with inclinations rather to believe the Worlds Eternity, or such
like monstrose Phanomena. I wish there were not too many such Mathematic
Atheists breathing in Christian air. But of this more hereafter.

. 4. We proceed to show the vanity and corruption of Moral Philosophy, The
Vanity of Moral Philosophy.
as well amongst the Pythagorean as other Philosophers. Moral Philosophy (as
has been mentioned) regards either single persons, and so it is styled Ethics;
or Corporations and Societies, and so it passes under the name of Politics.
Both of these had great corruptions attending them, both in the Italic and
Jonic Schools. As for Ethics, it is true, the Pythagoreans with the other
Philosophers had their (...), Ethic sentences, or Symbolic characters,
answering to, and, as I presume, traduced from the (...) Proverbial sayings
amongst the Jews: yet we are to remember, that these their Ethic precepts were
at best very imperfect, and not without a great mixture of vanity and
corruption. As for the Pythagorean Ethics they were very mythologic and
enigmatic, wrapped up under such dark symbols and figures, as that it was
difficult to come to a true understanding of them. The first that reduced Moral
Philosophy to a naked familiar dress was Socrates, who yet was excedeing
defective both in his precepts and practice of Morality; for Incest,
Fornication and Sodomie, were things not only allowed, but the later of them
practiced by him, if he be not belied, on his Minion Alcibiades: and Plato
brings in Socrates expressing great affection to Alcibiades, telling him that
he loved him for himself, etc. which argued an extreme affection toward him.
Grotius informs us, that this sin of Sodomie was generally allowed by the
Philosophers. So on Ephesians. 5.6, Ephesians. 5.6.
Let no man deceive you with vain words. (...), i. e. with vain Reasonings or
Philosophy. He notes here (says Grotius) the Philosophers, who taught there
was no sin in Incest, and (...), Sodomie; and who commended (...), community
of Wifes, (which Plato did) and who thought that it was lawful for buyers and
sellers to circumvent each other. Whence the Apostle exhorts them, Ver. 15, To
walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise; Ver. 15.
(...). He does (says Grotius) by a witty Paronomasia or allusion call the
Philosophers (those proud Sophists) (...), unwise, in as much as their
Morality was but vain and foolish if compared with the Gospel; wherefore he
exhorts them, Ver. 14. Awake thou that sleep, and arise from the dead, Ver.
14.
and Christ shall give thee light. Al their Moral Philosophy was but a
dreaming, dead, shadowy light; 'twas Christ only that gave them the true (...),
or light. So 1 Cor. 1.20. (...), 1 Cor. 1.20.
etc. Where is the wise? (...), says Grotius, amongst the Greeks, as (...)
amongst the Hebrews, were, by way of excellence, such as delivered Moral
precepts, as those seven Wisemen so famous in Greece, and after them Socrates
with others. The meaning is, show me the Philosophers and Philologists, who
have reduced so many persons to such Probitie and Morality, as we have done by
the preaching of the Cross. Their Disciples are but few in comparison of ours;
and they continue Fornicators, if not some somewhat worse: They continue (...),
emty vessels silled with nothing but vain opinion and ostentation, as Timon
said; they remain proud, litigious cursers, etc. So Grotius on 1 Cor. 2.14. The
Greek Philosophers were Fornicators, corruptors of youth, hunters of
Vain-glorie, cursers, envious, etc. Thence says, Minutius Faelix, We contemn
the proud looks of the Philosophers, whom we have known to be corruptors of
youth (or Sodomists) and Adulterers, and Tyrants, and always eloquent against
their own vices. And indeed it was just with God to leave the wisest and best
of their Moralists to fall into sins against nature, who abused their natural
light unto so much pride, presumtion and vain ostentation. Yea take Moral
Philosophic in its highest elevation and refinement, as seated amongst the
Stoics, and we shall find it a very poor imperfect vain shadow, if compared with
those precepts of Morality contained in the Word of God. The defect of Ethics
as to its matter.
For first if we consider the matter of al their Philosophic Morality, it was
very narrow and far short of those Moral duties taught us in the Word of God.
(1) The Philosopher's (...), right Reason, which they made the measure and rule
of their Morality, being but crooked and depraved, allowed them many sins, as
Incest, Fornication, Sodomie before mentioned, which Gods Law forbids. So
Grotius on 1 Cor. 5.2, tells us, that both the Cynics and Stoics judged Incest
amongst their (...), things indifferent. (2) Neither did it give any conviction
or prohibition of the first motions or ebullitions of Original Sin. (3) Neither
did their Right Reason back its precepts with such forcible promises, motives
and threats, from future happiness or punishment, as the Word of God does.

2. Pagan Ethics vain as to its end.
Neither were the Ethics of the Stoics and other Moralists defective, and so
vain in the matter and duties only, but also in the principes, form, and manner
of Morality: For (1) The soul and spirit of al Morality is placed, and that
by the Philosophers themselves, in the End. For, say they, such as the form is
in Naturals, such is the end in Morals and Spirituals; such as the Principe is
in Demonstration, such is the end in Action: Or, the end has the same place in
Actives, as the Principe has in Speculatives. The persection of every thing is
measured by its end, which is the term of al actions, as the form is of
productions. Now it is most certain, that the chief, yea the only supreme End
of al Morality (as well as of Divinity) can be no other than the glorifying
and enjoying of God; as Augustine long since, and Jansenius out of him has
demonstrated, Tom. 2. l. 3. c. 17. page 208. And how far these proud Moralists
were from this End is apparent to all that are versed in their Ethics. the
Romans end vainglory.
For (1) what was the main End which the ancient Romans (amongst whom the
Pythagoreans flourished) proposed as the scope of their Morality? surely
nothing but Honor, Renown, or Vain-glorie; arising from the splendour, luster,
or shine of their glittering heroic and seemingly virtuose actions, which
rendered al their good works but splendid sins, as Augustine. (2) The Stoics and
Peripatetics seem a little more noble and refined in their ends, The Stoics end
to live virtuose.
proposing it as their main design, (...), to live according to virtue; or, to
desire virtue for virtues sake. But what was the virtue they aspired unto? it
was a virtue spun out of the bowels of their own free will: so that they still
make Self the objective matter of their felicity: they deify and idolife Self,
their own homespun Virtues. Whence Augustine pronounces universally of these
Stoics, That they lived according to the flesh no less than the sensual
Epicureans; for (says he) to live according to the flesh is to live according
to a man's Self, his own Virtues, etc. as Jans. Aug. Tom. 2. l. 4. cap. 14.

2. Hence follows another great spring of vanity and corruption in all their
Philosophic Morality; in that, The Moralists make self the first efficient of
al good.
as they made Self the great standard, measure, and last end, so also the first
influential and effective principe of al their good works. They acted al not
only for, but also from Self their great God, or Idol, as Nebuchadnezar, Dan.
4.30, BY the might of my power, and FOR the honor of my Majesty. He makes
himself his first principe and last end, which is the highest Idolatry. So
these proud Moralists they al made self as the last end, so the first spring of
Morality. For (1) They al supposed those (...), 1. Their (...) is their rule.
commun principes, which some called (...), presumtions, or presuppositions of
natural light remaining in their corrupt understandings, to be if managed
aright a sufficient Rule or Law to guide them in their Morals. Whence these
dark glimmerings of corrupt nature were generally styled by the Platonists, as
also by the Stoics, (...), right reason. Though indeed Plato now and then seems
a little modest in acknowlegeing his ignorance, yet generally they supposed an
(...), a right reason, which if well improved might bring them to the (...), or
top of their Morality. This right reason was in a more particular manner the
Stoics (who pass for the greatest Moralists) Diana or Goddess, as we find it
excellently observed by Jansenius, in his August. Tom. 2. lib. 4. cap. 12. page
205. The Stoics (says he) and al other, who thought the offices of Virtue were
to be desired for their own honesty and pulchritude, made human reason, to
which they thought this was most consentaneous, Judge; and they would that she
as Mistress and Queen should govern al; to whom, as holding the chief
supremacy over the other parts of the Soul, al should be obedient. For hence
it is they so often crack, that the duties of Virtue are therefore honest and
desirable, because they are consentaneous to right reason: But in this mode of
desiring Virtue there lies hid the greatest Pride; for that which terminates
their appetite is their very Reason, as she is the Queen and Emperesse, and
utmost rule of a good life. Whence it comes to pass, that whosoever desires
Virtue in this manner adores his own Reason as the Princess which he serves,
which without al peradventure is the worshipping, and honoring, and taking
complacence in himself. Here we may see whence the Scholemen borrowed their
Recta ratio, right reason, which they make with the Philosophers to be the
Regula esse moralis, the rule of Moral Beings and Actions. So Suarez in his 1a
2ae, or Ethics, touching esse Morale, its rule, etc. Yea indeed the Scholemen
herein came much short of many of the more modest Philosophers, namely Socrates
and Plato, who make frequent acknowlegements of the imperfection of their
Natural light, and therefore by their (...) seem to understand the objective
Divine light, or Law of God, The Heathen Moralists assert a freewil, or seeds
of virtue.
of which I dout not but they had received some notices from Jewish Traditions,
as we have proved, Court Gentiles, P. 2. B. 2. c. 10.. 2. (2.) The Heathen
Moralists, both Romans, Pythagoreans, Platonists, Peripatetics, and Stoics,
supposed there was in men a Goodnature, disposition, seeds of Virtue, or Moral
Free Will, which if well improved would raise men to the highest elevation of
Virtue. This the Romans, (where the Pythagorean Philosophic flourished) called
the Elements, or root of Virtue. Some Platonists call it (...), a Goodnature;
The Aristotelics (...), Free Will; The Stoics, the seeds of virtue. And none
abounded more in this Idolising of their own Free Will than the Stoics, whose
(...), first truth, or according to the Christians Philosophic, (...), first
lie, was, That it was in the power of a man's own Free Will to make himself
virtuose or wicked, happy or miserable; yea a God if he pleased. So Diogenes
Laertius in the life of Zeno tells us, the Stoics held (...), etc. That virtue
was teachable, because good men are made of bad. Again (says he) because reason
is given to reasonable creatures, (...), To live rightly according to reason
happens to men naturally. He also tells us, that the Cynics held the same
principe, (...), that virtue was teachable. Plutarch has a Book thus titled,
(...), that virtue is a thing teachable. Yet we must confess that some of the
more modest Moralists made it a matter of question, Whether virtue were
teachable? Plato, or rather Socrates, in Plato's words, utterly denies it: so
Meno page 89, he brings in Socrates thus speaking, Socrates against Free Will.
(...), I have often sought if there were any Preceptors of virtue; and doing al
I can, I can find none. Whence he concludes, (...), Virtue comes not from
nature, neither is it teachable, but (...), by a Divine fate it is produced,
without the active concurrence of the mind in those where it is. Thus Socrates
in Plato's Meno, (...) page 99. whereby it seems he had some apprehension of
the insufficience of corrupt nature, or Free Will, to afford any spark of true
Virtue, and that it must come from some Divine fate. Though what this Divine
Fate was, and how Virtue was communicated by him, he was altogether at a loss.
Timaeus Locrus the Pythagorean, from whom Plato borrowed the main Ideas of his
Physics, asserted seeds of Virtue in corrupt nature. Thus page 103, (...), The
Principes of these Virtues are from nature, but the middle and end from
diligence, with the benefit of Philosophic institution, which nourish and
corroborate virtue, as exercices do the body, etc. This Philosophic Dogme of a
Moral (...), good nature, free will, or seminal virtue implanted in corrupt
nature is excellently opened to us by Jansenius, August. Tom. 2. lib. 4. cap.
12. page 256. This Dogme, says he, which asserteth seeds of Virtue to be
implanted in men naturally, we admonish that it sprang from the Gentile
Philosophy. For the Philosophers, when they observed that there flourished in
every man's nature a certain judgment concerning the honesty of many Acts, and
a remorse of Conscience following their pravities, etc. they attributed to the
human mind seeds of al virtues; which would by good culture and exercitation
bud forth and grow up unto ripe Virtue! Hear Tullie attributing the Elements of
the more refined Peripatetic and Stoic Virtue to nature it self, Tul. lib. 5.
de finibus: Nature brought in the Elements of virtue -- but it only began
virtue and nothing more. It Is true, (as Jansenius before well observes) if we
consider Virtue only in regard of its office, duty, or matter, it may not be
inconvenient to allow some more noble spirits, some kind of seminal
inclinations or radical dispositions to many heroic actions materially good,
with which many Noble Romans and Grecians were endowed. But alas! such seminal
material dispositions to actions materially good, are but the corpse or body of
Morality, or Virtue; it is the Principes specially the End, that is the soul,
which spirits and informs every good act, and renders it truly virtuose: in
which regard to suppose with the Philosophers any seeds of virtue in corrupt
nature, is to suppose a contradiction, or an opposite in an apposite, i.e. pure
nature in corrupt. From this Philosophic Dogme of the seeds of virtue in human
nature, the Pelagians and semi-Pelagians, Cassianus, This Doctrine of the seeds
of virtue or free will the root of Pelagianisme.
etc. drew their Doctrine of Free Will, which Augustine does so greatly inveigh
against. This opinion has been since espoused by the Scholemen, who finding
themselves opposed herein by all Christian Catholics, they invented this new
stratageme or blind to salve their Phenomenon, namely by distinguishing Virtues
into Natural or Moral and Supernatural or Divine. Whereas indeed there can be
no Virtue truly Moral, but what is also Supernatural or Divine; No moral or
natural virtue but what is divine and supernatural.
for according to their own Schole-maxime, Bonum constat ex causis integris,
malum ex quolibet defectu, Good must have al its causes, but evil arises from
any defect. We find this piece of Scholastic vanity or corruption fully laid
open by Jansenius, August. Tom. 2. lib. 4. cap. 12. page 256. On those seeds of
Virtue the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians first founded their Heresy; which
afterward the Scholemen brought into the Christian Schools, to no small
prejudice of Scholastic Doctrine. For these Heretics affirmed, That from these
Philosophic Seeds true Virtues might, by the alone power of the human will,
spring; which the Scholemen perceiving to be manifestly repugnant to the most
constant Catholic Doctrine, they framed a double man in one man, a double
Charity, double Virtues, double Works; the one Natural, the other
Supernatural, of which in the whole Doctrine of Augustine, etc. there cannot be
found the least Vestigium. As if those very Virtues, which the Philosophers and
Scholemen call Natural, would not have been called by Augustine Vices. That there
is no Virtue natural, or truly moral, but what is supernatural, see Court Gent.
Part 4. Book 1. Chap. 2.. 4. Indeed herein the vanity and corruption of the
Pelagians and Scholemen excedes that of the Philosophers: The Pelagians worse
than Philosophers.
for these having no Divine Revelation to measure Virtue by, but only some dark
glimmering of Nature's light, could not attain unto any entire or true Idea and
notion thereof, as to its principe and spiritual quality, and therefore no
wonder if these poor Philosophers, who by reason of their darkness accounted
the picture, shadow, or matter of a good action to be Virtue, supposed an (...),
or some seminal dispositions to the matter of Virtue to be Virtue. But as for
the Pelagians and Scholemen, who have a clear rule to judge of Moral good by,
and also confess, that every good action must consist of al its causes; for
such to allow of any seeds of Virtue, or Moral Free Will in corrupt Nature, is a
piece of pride and vanity far beyond that of the Philosophers.

3. Hence follow many other Essential defects in all the Philosophic Ethics of
the Pagan Moralists. 3. Other Essential defects as to the Principes of their
Morals.
(1) We find no one precept in all their Rules of Morality, pressing men to
spiritual poverty, self-emtinesse, etc. which Christ's Ethics make the
foundation of Virtue, Mat. 5.3, 4. But we find the quite contrary everywhere
in the Philosophers Morals, which wholly tends to feed spiritual pride. (2) We
find no mention of Christ, and Dependence on Him, which is Essential to every
good work. It Is true, Socrates bids his Friend, (...), depend on God, and pray
for assistance to perform good acts: But it is most probable he knew not what
this Dependence meant, or where to pitch it on its right Object: for if he had,
he might have been reckoned a Believer, which we have no ground to believe he
was, but the contrary. (3) In all their Philosophic Ethics we find not any one
word of performing Virtuose Acts out of Filial love to God, which is part of
the spirit, or Essential constitution of Morality. Many other defects in their
Ethics might be mentioned.

. 6. The Vanity of Philosophic Politics. 1 Cor. 1.20.
A second part of Moral Philosophy is Politics, wherein the Philosophers were
not a little vain and corrupt. So 1 Cor. 1.20, (...); Where is the Scribe?
(...), (says Grotius) according to the Hebrew (...) in the Hellenistic manner
of speaking, signifies him that is skilled in the Law or History. So in Baruc.
3.23, etc. (...), are such as have skill in the Law or History. There was a
twofold Scribe among the Hebrews, the one Politic, the other Ecclesiastic. The
Politic Scribes were, (1) Ministers of State, such as were the King's Privy
Counselors, or persons constituted in some Office of trust. Thus (...)
Officers, Exodus 5.6, is rendered by the Seventy (...), Ezr. 4.8.
Scribes. So Ezra 4.8, (...), Scribe, notes civil Dignity and Office; whence
it is rendered in our Margines, Secretary. (2) There were also among the Hebrews
inferior or plebean Scribes, for the making private Contractes, answerable to
our public Notaries. The Ecclesiastic Scribe was a Doctor, Expositor, and
Interpreter of the Law; whose Office it was to meditate on, expound and
vindicate the Law. Scribe here is to be understood chiefly in the last sense,
yet not exclusively as to the first notion of it. But we find a more full
account of the Vanity of al Philosophic Politics, or Civil Wisdom, 1 Cor.
2.6, 1 Cor. 2.6.
(...), Nor the wisdom of the Princes of this world. He means (says Grotius)
Politic Wisdom, to which belongs Jurisprudence, or skill in Laws and Histories.
As if he had said, Take notice, that al these proud Monarchs, notwithstanding
al their Politic Laws and Government, are come to naught, or spoiled of al
their Politic Designs and Interess. For this seems the proper import of (...),
that come to naught. (...) is said (1) Of that which has lost its efficacitie,
as Luke 13.7. (2) Of that which is abolisht and made void. Politic Philosophy
has lost its spirits and efficace. So Grotius. The Empires that now are shall
perish, as well as those figured by Daniel's Image, Dan. 2.44, etc. 1. 1. Their
imperfection in comparison of Divine Politics.
The Vanity of al Human Politics discovers it self by their imperfection if
compared with Divine Politics. Human Politics consist of two parts, Legislation
and Administration. Legislative Politics had for their main Institutors Minos
the Cretian Legislator, Lycurgus who gave Laws to the Lacedaemonians, Solon the
Athenian Law giver, with Draco. Also amongst the Romans, Numa Pompilius, who
gave Laws to Rome; Zaleucus the Locrian Legislator, and Charondas the Thurian,
both Pythagoreans. Amongst the Philosophers, who gave an Idea both of
Legislative and Administrative Politics, we have first Pythagoras, who spent
the Afternoon in instructing his Disciples in Politics; besides his (...),
which Laertius says he writ. Also Plato who left behind him an excellent Idea
of Politics, both Legislative, in his several Books of Laws, and
Administrative, in his Books of a Communwealth. Aristotle likewise has given us
a good Idea of Politics. Yet al these Human Politics, both Philosophic, or
Contemplative and Active, if compared with Divine seem but shadows, The
imperfection of Human Politics. 1. As to their origin and extent.
very imperfect, yea vain: for (1) Al these Human Politics were but broken
imperfect derivations or traditions from the Divine Jewish Politics; as
elsewhere. (2) Al Human Politics were very narrow and particular, not general
and comprehensive of particular circumstances. Therefore Aristotle, lib. 1.
Polit. observes well, (...), Al things are most evident to such as consider
particulars, but they who pronounce universally, deceiving deceive themselves.
So Trajan in his directions to Pliny, says, That nothing could be constituted
universally as a certain form. (3) Hence it follows, that al their general
Laws and Politic Precepts, whether Ideal or Practic, were liable to a world of
Exceptions, Restrictions, Limitations and Alterations: for their best Idea of
Politics was but (...), for the most part, not universally true and good;
because particulars, the object thereof, are infinite. Hence, says Aristotle,
Rhet. l. 1. c. 8. (...), no Art considers (or comprehends) particulars, because
infinite: which is most true of al their Human Politics, which could not
consider or comprehend those infinite circumstances which attend Human actions;
and therefore such of them as ventured to lay down an universal Idea, or
general Rules of Politics, discovered much vanity and imperfection; besides
the many Exceptions they were fain to admit: and after al their most possible
exactness in their Politic Constitutions, they were forced to have recourse to
their (...), the Law of Equity, or Court of Chancerie, for the emendation,
correction, or supplement of such things as were not excepted or provided for
in their universal Idea of Politics. But now the Divine Politics admit not of
such imperfections; because the Divine Law is the most August, Equal,
Universal, Adequate Rule of al Politics, as well as Ecclesiastics, as we have
copiosely proved, Philosophle Politics vain.
Idea Theolog. l. 1. c. 8. 2 These Human Philosophic Politics are not only
imperfect and vain comparatively in regard of Divine Politics, but likewise in
themselves, in regard of that Corruption, both inherent and subsequent, which
attends them. 1. As to their End.
As (1) in regard of their End, in that they made their carnal Interest the
only measure of Good and Evil, without the least respect to Divine Interest, 2.
As to their Matter.
or Glory, as before. (2) The matter of their Politics was very corrupt, in
that they allowed many things in themselves evil, and very destructive to Human
Societies: as Community of Wives, Fornication, Incest, Sodomie, Drunkenesse,
3. As to their effects.
etc. (3) But the greatest Corruption in their Human Politics was in regard of
their sad effects many ways. 1. Atheism.
[1] In that al their Politics were the mother and nurse of Atheism: For (1)
they made Religion subserve their Politic Interests and Constitutions. So Owen
Theol l. 1. c. 8. These Lawgivers, in framing their Politic Theology, had
scarce any thing else in their aim, but how they might so temper Religion,
that thence there might not arise any disturbance or evil in the Civil state.
Such was Numa's Politic Religion with the rest. (2) Their Politics were the
mother and nurse of Atheism, in that these great Politicians attributed the
good or il success of Human affairs to their Politic wisdom or contrivances.
In which regard they made their Human Prudence their God, or great Idol, unto
which all the great occurrences and dispositions of Providence must stoop, which
opened the door to Atheism, 2. Idolatry.
and shut God out of the World. [2] The Philosophic Politics opened the door
also to Idolatry: for these Politicians had their (...), a Politic Religion,
which out of compliance with the peoples Idolatry humor proved a great nurse
to Idolatry, as hereafter.

CHAP. III. The Vanity of Metaphysics, or Natural Theology, and Divination.
The Pythagorean Philosophic Theology of al most vain. (1) In regard of God:
[1] They understood not their own notions of God; [2] Nor the Trinity; [3] Nor
their Ideas. (2) The vanity of their Theology as to the Divine (...), Word,
and Demon-Doctrines. Col. 2.8, 9. (...), i.e. really, essentially, perfectly.
Col. 2.10, 18, 19, largely opened. (3) The vanity of their Daemon-worship. (4)
Also of their notions about the Soul. (5) The hellish corruption of their Magic
and Divination, which they took up in imitation of the Jewish modes of
Revelation. Their Art of Divination part of their Doctrines of Demons. 1 Timothy
4.1. Apollo their great God of Divination, his Origin and Temple at Delphus,
etc. The nature of Divination out of Plato, (1) Its origin, Divine afflation.
(2) Its instruments, at first Poets, then Philosophers. (3) This mode of
Divination usually extatic. (4) Also by Enthusiasme. (5) These Enthusiasts had
their Judges, as the Jewish. (6) The End of Divination. (7) The sundry kinds of
Divination, by Dreams, Maladies, etc. (8) Divination by Magic: of Apollonius
Tyanaeus: 1 Timothy 4.1. (9) Divination by Animals, Plants, Men, Elements, Stars,
and things artificial, Glasses, Axes, etc.
. 1. HAving discoursed of the Vanity of Philosophy in Naturals and Morals, we
now proceed to the Vanity of its Metaphysics, or Supernatural Philosophy,
which contains Natural Theology, and Divination. As for the Pagan (...), The
Corruption of Natural Theology.
Natural Theology, there was none more famous than that of the Pythagoreans,
which came the nearest of any to the Scripture Theology, and yet was
nevertheless corrupt. Yea indeed there seems to be this peculiar curse on the
Pythagorean Natural Theology, that though it came the nearest of any to Divine
Theology, yet was it the most corrupt of al both in it self, as also in its
effects. For none more devoted to Superstition and Idolatry than the
Pythagoreans; none greater Heresiarches, or founders of Heresy in the
Christian Church than they. This we may look upon as procedeing from a
particular curse of God upon this, as on al other Human Inventions in Divine
Matters, which usually the nearer ressemblance they have with Divine
Institutions, the more are they blasted by God, even to the turning aside and
subverting such as depend upon them. Thus the case stood with these
Pythagoreans, as well as with the rest of the Philosophers; who finding
themselves fallen from that Natural Theology their first Parents were
possessed withal, and which their natures still retained some Physical and more
remote capacity unto, they studied al ways possible to recover the same: in
order whereto having acquired some broken Jewish Traditions of that new model
of Religion God was pleased to vouchsafe unto his Church, they hoped by the
improvement of their own (...), commun principes, on these rudiments or
foundations received from the Jewish Church, to erect a new frame or body of
Natural Divinity, in lieu of that which they found themselves deprived of.
Which design of theirs proved altogether abortive; yea so far were these blind
Philosophers from reaching their End of attaining a new edition of that Natural
Theology they had lost by the Fall, as that al their attemts and studies in
order hereto serve only the more effectually to envelop and entangle them in
grosser ignorance, Atheism, Superstition, and Idolatry. This has been
excellently opened to us by Owen, Theolog. lib. 1. cap. 7. where having laid
open the design of the new Platonists, after the breaking forth of the Gospel
to reform Philosophy, so as to make it a Vicarious Natural Theology, he
adds the same of the Pythagorean Philosophy: All that ancient Wisdom (says
he) of Pythagoras consisted in a way for the Institution of Religion. I
confess the whole of that Philosophy savored of Idolatry superstition; which
yet retained some obscure Images and Characters of the Truth. The event
therefore answered not this famous attemt; yea by these undertakings Natural
Theology was more corrupted rather than repaired. Such were the miserable
effects of their proud and vain attemts, by which hoping and endeavoring to
restore themselves to their ancient inheritance of Natural Theology, founded
on the Covenant of Works, and possessed by their first Parents in the Golden
age of Innocence, they fell into greater bondage of Superstition and Idolatry.
But to treat more particularly of the corruption of this Philosophic Natural
Theology, we shall consider it (1) In its Ultimate object. (2) In its Mediate
object. (3) In its parts.

. 2. As for the ultimate and supreme Object of their Metaphysics or Natural
Theology, it was God the first Eternal Being, The corruption of Natural
Theology as to its ultimate object, God.
and last end of althings. And here it cannot be denied but that the
Pythagoreans, and Platonists after them, had many good Metaphysic
Contemplations of God, as the first Being and last End; also of his Divine
Perfections and Ideas, as we shall Demonstrate Part. 4. B. 2. Yet these their
Metaphysic notions of God were not without great mixture of vanity and
corruption. For (1) few or none understood their own Philosophic notions
touching God, their (...), The Philosophers understood not their own notions of
God; nor how he was the Author of Eternal Life.
etc. but receiving the foundations of these Metaphysic Contemplations from
Scriptural Traditions, as Exodus 3.14. or the like, they Philosophised thereon,
without right conception of the things of which they discoursed. This seems
more than hinted in Paul's observation touching the Athenian Altar, To the
unknown God, Act. 17.23. That there was a God the wiser of these blind Grecians
knew, partly by Tradition, partly by the improvement of their own commun
Principes: but what, or who this God was, that was to them a thing unknown; and
therefore some suppose Saturn to be this one God, i. e. Adam or Noah: others
call him Jupiter Hammon, i.e. Cham: and others of them could reach no farther
than the Sun, whom they supposed to be the most gloriose Creature, and
therefore God. The wisest of them knew not where to find, or what to make of
this God, on which they thus Philosophised. They only groped after him, as Act.
17.27. 1 Cor. 1.21.
So 1 Cor. 1.21, For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
not God: i.e. By all their Metaphysic wisdom, whether Traditional or acquired
from the improvement of their Natural Principes, they could not come to any
right Idea or true notion of God, what he was and where to be found. It Is true
they had some general speculations of him as the first Being, self Being,
infinite, eternal, and most simple Being, etc. yet they knew him not as the
Author and Object of Eternal Life, as Joh. 17.3. whence al their knowledge of
him proved altogether vain and unprofitable. This Grotius makes the import of
Paul's declamation against the vain deceit of Philosophy, (principally the
Pythagoreans,) Col. 2.8. (...), take diligent heed, Col. 2.8.
look well to it. It notes, that men are very prone to fall into this snare, and
therefore ought to take the more heed. That no one spoil you. (...), is
interpreted by Hesychius (...), that no one strip you naked. Vain Philosophy
strips men naked of their best Robes, namely the Righteosenesse of Christ, and
saving Knowledge of God. (...), is a Military notion, deduced by Critics from
(...), a prey, or spoil taken in War, (from (...) to spoil) and (...) to lead.
Whence it primarily notes, to lead or carry away by an armed power in an
hostile manner. Thus many Pythagorising Gnostics seduced and led captive many
carnal professors, and stripped them naked of their Christian Doctrines, by vain
Philosophy. (...). He uses (says Grotius) the Greek word Philosophy,
because it was received; but it truly deceived men: for either it did not
promise Eternal Life, or else it showed not the true and certain way which
leads thither. So that in truth al their fine-spun Metaphysic Contemplations
of God the first Eternal and all-sufficient Being, were as to them altogether
vain and useless; because they had no regard to God as the Author, Object,
Matter and Way to Eternal Life, 2. They had no true knowledge of the Trinity.
which they were wholly ignorant of. (2) Much less had these Pagan
Philosophers any true notions of the Trinity. This great Mystery of Trinity
in Unity, and Unity in Trinity was altogether hid from them. I shall not
deny, but that these blind Heathens, specially the wiser of them, might have
some very dark and imperfect Traditions concerning a Trinity: whence some
conceive that great Oriental maxim, How far they had notices of a Trinity.
which Pythagoras brought with him into Greece touching God, that he was (...),
One and many, was but some broken Jewish Tradition of the Trinity. We may
grant also that the Platonists had some weak corrupt Traditions of three (...),
Hypostases, or Persons, which they called (...), Trinity; whereof the first
was by them named (...), Self-being; (...), the good, and (...), the Father:
The second Person they called, (...), the Mind; (...), the Word; and (...), the
begotten; also (...), the framer: The third, (...), the Soul of the World.
These and suchlike poor dim notices of a Trinity, it is likely Pythagoras and
Plato after him traduced originally from the Jews, if not immediately, yet
mediately by the Phenicians and Egyptians. Of which see more fully, Philos.
General. p. 1. l. 3. c. 4. Sect. 1,. 13. But yet that neither the Grecian,
Egyptian, or Phenician Philosophers had any true or sound notion of the
Trinity, I think, will be sufficiently evident to any sober mind, that shall
consider what a world of fables and contradictions they mixed with these broken
discoveries they had received of a Trinity. This indeed Plato ingenuously
confesses, in saying, That he had received many Mysteries from the Ancients,
which he understood not, but expected some Interpreter to unfold them to him.
And indeed he never spoke more truth; for both he and Pythagoras before him,
having an infinite thirst after Divine Mysteries, to satisfy their inquisitive
humor, they would catch at every shadow of Oriental Jewish Antiquity, though
they understood nothing thereof. This seems the true account of their
Philosophic Speculations about the Trinity, which is confirmed by Justinian,
on 1 John 1.1, etc. Sect. 52, 53, 54. That these Philosophic notions about
(...), etc gace occasion to the Arian Heresic, see B. 2. Chap 1. Sect. ^.
where having mentioned the many Metaphysic Contemplations of the Pagan
Philosophers about (...), he concludes thus: Truly many things have been taken
out of Moses his Law by the Philosophers and Poets, but depraved, changed, and
wrested, as we learn out of Augustine, de Civit. Dei, l. 8. cap. 11. and lib.
18. c. 37. In which manner also perhaps they corrupted such notions as referred
to the origin of the Divine (...), Word; and taught that those Persons
differed in nature, who are only distinguished in Hypostasis: and so the first
Mind they called Good it self; the second, the Opisicer or Framer of the World;
the third, the Soul of the World. From which error some suppose the Arian
Impiety to have sprang. Which things being thus, it seems most likely, that
these Philosophers, by a certain magnitude of ingenie and assiduous study and
diligence, might come to know something of God; which yet was mixed with many
errors: neither yet could they attain in any measure to the Mystery of the
Trinity, or the Eternal Production of the Divine Word. The like account I find
in Serranus, on Plato's Epist. 6. page 323. where Plato speaking of God in
these words: God the Imperator of al things that are, or that shall be; and the
Father of this Principal Cause: [Et illius Principis Causae Patrem.] These
words, says Serranus, some of our Writers understand as if Plato hereby hinted
to us the Mystery of the Trinity: so also they understand (...) in his
Epimon. But away with these madnesses! Plato truly might speak many things,
which he traduced from the Phenician Doctrine, but understood not; yea it is
not likely that the Phenicians or Egyptians, who were the conservators of these
Platonic, (...), ineffable Doctrines, understood so great a Mystery as this of
the Trinity. I find something also in Sanchoniathon's fragments much like this
passage of Plato: (which confirms what has been quoted out of Serranus) (...),
according to these was there begotten a certain Eliun. That Eliun is the same
with the Scripture (...) Elohim God, or (...) Elion the Most High, is plain;
though Sanchoniathon's Fables touching this Eliun argue he understood not what
he said. This may suffice to prove, that al those Metaphysic Contemplations,
which peradventure had their origin from some shadowie dark Jewish notices
touching the Trinity, as managed by the Philosophers, were but vain corrupt
and unintelligible notions; yea, that they gave foundation to the Arian
Heresy, which was hatched in the Schole of Alexandria, where this Pythagorean
Platonic Philosophy then flourished, as we shall prove, Their vanity as to the
Divine Ideas and Decrees.
B. 2. c. 1.. 9. (3) What we have mentioned of the Trinity holds also true to
prove the vanity and corruption of the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophemes
about the Divine Ideas, and Decrees. It Is true, Pythagoras, Parmenides, Timaeus
the Locrian, and Plato out of them, had some more tolerable Contemplations
concerning the Divine Ideas, both of things possible and future, inherent in
the Divine mind; yea they seem to assert the Eternity, Simplicity,
Immutabilitie, absolute Soveraintie and Independence of these Divine Ideas; to
the shame and consusion of the Pelagians, Scholemen, and Arminians; as we shall
prove, Par. 4. B. 2. c. 5.. 2. of Divine Ideas. Yet these their Metaphysic
notions of Divine Ideas were not without great commixture of vanity and
corruption in themselves, and of much more dangerous influence in the Christian
Schools: for much of the Gnostic Infusions in the primitive Churches, as also
of the Monkish Mystic Divinity, and the Scholastic corrupt speculations about
the Decrees of God, received their origin from these Pythagorean and Platonic
Ideas, as it may appear hereafter, B. 2.

. 3. The vanity of the Philosophers Natural Theology as to its mediate Object.
As the Pagan Philosophic Theology was vain and corrupt as to its ultimate
Object, the Divine Being, Persons, and Ideas; so was it much more corrupt in
regard of its mediate Object, or the mediums and ways, by which the soul was
to be raised up to the knowledge, worship, and enjoyment of this first Eternal
Being. It Is true, the light of Nature, and those visible Ideas of Gods Wisdom,
Power, and Goodness impressed on the Book of the Creatures, together with
those imperfect notices traduced from the Jewish Church, gave these Natural
Theologists some glimmering notions of the Deity, his Perfections and
Operations: but as for Christ the mediate Object, or Mediator betwixt God and
Man, Him they seem to have been altogether strangers unto. It Is granted they
had some fabulose Traditions touching their Sheepherd-God Pan; touching Minerva
the Goddess of Wisdom, her being produced out of Jupiter's brain; touching
Silenus, etc. which some conceive to be but corrupt imitations of and
reflections from the Jewish Messiah, his Name and Offices; who is in Scripture
called a Sheepherd, Shilo, the Wisdom of God, etc. But yet the many Fables
which they mixed with these Traditions, (perhaps originally Jewish) argue their
stupid ignorance of Christ the Savior of the World. We shall hereafter B. 2. C.
1.. 5. and C. 2.. 2.. 3. show how that all the Phenician Baalim, and Grecian
Demons, were but Idolatry Imitamens or Apes of the true Messiah; yet were
these blind Heathens so far from gaining any knowledge of the true Messiah
hereby, as indeed al their Demon-contemplations and worship did but leave them
under greater darkness and distance as to the true Mediator. For this was the
great design of Satan, Al their Demon-Doctrines vain and corrupt.
by these Idol-Demons or Mediators (which he fat up in opposition to, though in
imitation of Christ) to shut the door against Christ, that so he might detain
those blind Sophists in ignorance of, and estrangement from him the way of
Life. It Is true, these Gentile-Philosophers, the wiser of them, Thales,
Pythagoras, and Plato, (who having conversed abroad in the Oriental parts, seem
to have had some more awakened thoughts touching the Fall and lost condition of
Mankind by reason of Sin) could not but conclude a necessity of some
Satisfaction to be made to Divine Justice; and finding nothing in themselves as
a fit Atonement, they found out these new Mediators their Demons, whose Office
it was to intercede betwixt Men and the supreme God; conveighing men's
sacrifices, supplications, and worship to God; and God's Divine commands,
Gifts, and other vouchsafements to men; by which means there was a Communion
maintained betwixt the supreme God and Men. This was the substance of that
(...), Natural Theology, brought in by the Philosophers, in distinction from
(if not opposition to) (...) the fabulose Theology of the Poets; as also to
the (...), Politic Theology of Statesmen, Priest and People. This Natural
Theology of the Philosophers, specially of the Pythagoreans and Platonists,
which comprehended this Doctrine of Demons, was not less injuriose to Christ,
than the fabulose Theology of the Poets, or the Politic of the Statesmen: For
look as in the Christian Church Antichrist sits in the Temple of God, as a
counter-Christ; so amongst these Pagans, their Demons were a kind of
Gentile-Antichrist, or counter-Messias. Yea, which is more, al Antichrists
Apostasy to Saint worship; al his Images, Shrines, Relics, Canonifations,
Invocations, Intercessions, Satisfactions of Saints, with all his Festivals,
Abstinences, etc. were al but branches of this Demon-Worship, as it is evident
from 1 Timothy 4.1. Act. 17.18. 1 Cor. 10.21. Rev. 9.13. This will appear in its
place, B. 2. C. 2.. 3, etc. which is a sufficient demonstration of the
monstrose vanity and corruption of this Natural Theology, which these vain
Sophists so much prided themselves in, as that whereby they hoped and
endeavored to restore that Natural Theology they lost in their first Parents.
But at present it shall suffice us to discover, how this piece of their
Metaphysic Philosophy, or Natural Theology, was not only void of, but also
Diametrically opposite to Christ as Mediator, and therefore most vain and
degenerate. And for the proof hereof I shall have recourse to that great
Chapter, wherein Paul seems professedly to set himself against the vanity of
the Pythagorean and other Philosophy. Col. 2.3.
Col. 2.3, he tells them, That in Christ were hid all the treasures of wisdom,
etc. (...), are hid; the similitude seems to be taken from a Chest, wherein men
lay up their money, to be taken forth as occasion may serve. Thus the LXX, Dan.
11.43. (...), in the hidden treasures of Gold. What infinite hidden Treasures
of Wisdom are there in Christ! The Wisdom of Christ is compared to Treasures,
Prove. 8.10, 11, 19. Whence Paul adds, V. 4. And this I say, Ver. 4.
lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. (...) answers to the
Hebraic (...) and (...), for which the LXX place (...). It signifies primarily,
by false Ratiocinations, which yet have the color and tincture of truth, to
circumvent the simple; by sophistic reason to impose on others; by a captiose
fallaciose syllogism to deceive. Thence (...) is, by Hesychius, made
Synonymous and equipollent to (...), Deceit; and (...) to (...). The Apostles
mind seems this: Let no Pythagorising Judaising Christians plunder you of your
Christian Wisdom and Theology, by the enticing heart-bewitching notions of
vain Philosophy. Grotius observes, that there were, even in those dawnings of
Christianity, sown in Phrygia the Seeds of the Phrygian Heresy, composed of
Judaic and Pythagoric Dogmes, mixed with Christian Theology; and those that
would not espouse this Heresy were styled by these Sectaries carnal and
illiterate. Whence Verse. 8. he exhortes, Ver. 8.
that None spoil them of Christ's treasures of Wisdom, through Philosophy and
vain deceit, after the tradition of men. i.e. (says Hammond in his Paraphrase
on these words,) And take care that no body plunder you of all that you have,
your Principes of Christian Knowledge, by that vain, emtie, frothie, pretended
knowledge and wisdom which the Gnostics talk of, 1 Timothy 1.4. 1 Timothy 6.20. taken
out of the Heathen Pythagorcan Philosophy, together with the observances of
the Mosaic Law, and very distant and contrary to Christian Divinity, etc.
It Is evident, he opposes the vain Philosophy of these Pythagorising Gnostics
to those Treasures of Wisdom which were hid in, and reveled by Christ the only
Mediator, whom these Pythagorean Gnostics endeavored to exclude, placing their
Aeones and Demons in his room. Whence it follows, Verse. 9. For in him dwells
all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. (...), bodily; i.e. (1) really, Ver. 9.
(...). 1. Really.
and that [1] In opposition to all the Jewish Types and Figures, which were but
shadows of Christ the substance or body; [2] Really, in opposition to al those
false Demons or Aeones, which were at first hatched by the vain Metaphysic
Philosophy, or Natural Theology of the Heathen Philosophers, and now brought
into the Christian Theology by these Pythagorising Gnostics, as forerunners of
Antichrist. (2) (...) signifies also essentially, or substantially. Thus
Occumenius interprets it by (...), essentially. So among the Hebrews (...)
signifies essence as well as body; and (...), Ver. 11. denotes essence: 2.
Essentially.
and then the meaning is, That the whole Divine Nature or Essence dwells in
Christ, so that he is truly and Essentially God, in opposition to their
Philosophic Demons, which were but Idols. (3) (...) may be rendered personally.
Thus (...) signifies a Person, 3. Personally.
Romans 12.1. 2 Cor. 10.10. So Pindar, (...), four Persons: and Sophocles, (...),
My person. The Deity dwells in the Human Nature of Christ personally, by an
Hypostatic personal Union, typified by Gods habitation over the Arc, which was
but the Type of Christ's Human Nature. 4. Perfectly.
(4) (...) may signify perfectly and eminently; as Christ is said, Ver. 10. to
be a complete Head, above al Principalities. (5) (...) may also denote the
perfection of Gospel-revelation delivered by Christ, in opposition to the Typic
shadowie Theology of the Jews, and to the false Natural Theology of the vain
Philosophers, Ver. 8. Thus Hammond in his Paraphrase: For the whole will of God
(says he) is by Christ really made known unto us, as his Divinity really
dwells in him; and therefore there is little need of the additions of the
Gnostics, which they borrow out of the Heathenish and Jewish Theology, to
supply the defects of the Evangelie Doctrine. Though this sense seems also
included, yet the former may not be excluded, as it appears by what follows, v.
10. Ye are complete in him, which is the Head of al Principality and power.
Ver. 10. Complete.
i. e. He is a complete Head, or perfect Mediator, infinitely above al Angelic
Principalities and Human Powers, whence those Pythagorean Demons and Aeones had
their origin. For all their Demons were but Human powers, or great Heroes
deified; and al their Aeones, but Angels of a superior or lower degree; al
infinitely short of Christ, who is the Head of al Principalities and Powers,
and therefore a perfect Mediator in whom you are complete, in opposition to al
their Gentile Demons or Aeones, etc. I am not ignorant, that Hammond in his
Paraphrase on these words, (following the humor of Grotius, who was too much
Socinian and against the Deity of Christ) interprets this of their being
complete in knowledge by the Doctrine of Christ, without such supplies as these,
from the Doctrines and Divinity of the Gnostics about their Aeones, looked on
by them as Divine immortal powers. Which sense, though true and included in the
words, yet may it not exclude Christ as the simple object of Faith, or as he is
the complete only Mediator, in opposition to al those Philosophic Demons,
Aeones, or Idol-Mediators, which these Pythagorising Gnostics then began to
foist into the Christian Theology, and were afterward in a more perfect manner
established by Antichrist, that great Demon, or Idol set up in God's House.
These Pythagorean Demons and Aeones, which were the great Mediators in the
Philosophers (...), Natural Theology, and brought into the Christian Theology
first by the Gnostics, and then by Antichrist, are again openly struck at by
the Apostle, in this caution of his to the Colossians, Chap. 2. v. 18, 19. V.
18, (...). Col. 2.18, 19.
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and will worship
of Angels. (...), according to its origination, signifies an humility of mind,
quasi (...), minding low things. But here it signifies a superstitiose and
servile demission or prostitution of the spirit to false objects of worship,
together with an hypocritie show and study of humility. Here is, says
Grotius, (...). i.e. In an humble Will Worship performed to Angels; which these
Pythagorising Gnostics called Aeones, and worshipped as Mediators to God,
distributing them into certain Classes, and allowing them their respective
Offices, without any other ground than their own fantiastic imitation of that
Natural Theology amongst the Heathen Philosophers. (...), let no man beguile
you. (...) signifies (1) and properly, to give sentence against any one,
whereby he is pronounced unworthy of the (...), or the reward given to such as
contended for victory. And so it is an allusion to such as ran in the race,
who if they were defective or irregular in their race, were condemned by Judges
appointed for this purpose to lose the reward; whence (...) is rendered by
Phavorinus, (...), let no man condemn you, as defective or irregular in your
Christian race; beware of losing your reward by an Idolatry Will Worship given
to Angels or Men, answerable to the Heathens Natutural Theology. (2) (...)
notes (...) praeripere, by craft to cheat men of their crown or reward. So
Pausanias, (...). So Jerome says, That Paul used this word, according to the
custom of his own Province, namely, Tarsis and Cilicia; for (...) in the
Cilician tongue notes cunningly to cheat another of his reward. And then the
sense is, let no one, by these Pythagorean Dogmes, craftily cheat you of your
reward, by inducing you to bow your souls, in a superstitiose servile manner,
to worship Angels, and thence to reject Christ your Head. So it follows v. 19.
(...) i.e. (says Grotius) not keeping close to Christ, whom God has therefore
given to be Head of the Church, that so by him our desires may be offered up
unto himself. The sum of these Apostolic exhortations is this: Paul saw the
Pagan Demons (which were the main subject of their Natural Theology) creeping
in apace into the Church of God, under the Mystic Theology of the
Pythagorising Gnostics: he foresaw also by the spirit of Prophecy, that
Antichrist, the great Christian Demon, would advance the said Demons on Christ's
throne, by assuming to himself a power of Canonising Saints as Intercessors or
Mediators; giving Indulgences, making Laws, erecting Images, etc. al which were
but branches of the old Pagan Demon worship; which Paul foreseeing Antichrist
would erect in the room of Christ, he was the more invective against this their
Pagan Natural Theology touching Demons, etc.

. 4. 4 Demon-worship vain and corrupt.
Hence it followed that the Natural Theology of these Pagan Philosophers
proved exceeding vain, corrupt, and abominable, as to al those modes or rites of
Worship, which they either invented themselves, or traduced from the Jewish
Church. It has been acknowleged, that these blind Philosophers, specially the
Pythagoreans, had very many Rites and Modes of Worship by tradition from, and
in imitation of the Jewish Rites and Worship, as Part 2. B 2. chap. 2.. 4. But
al these apish Modes of Worship being not received as Divine Institutes, but
mixed with their own fantastic Idolatric inventions, and passing through the
hands of their Demons, and thence terminating on some Idol-God, proved but a
miserable piece of Heathenish Will Worship and Idolatry. It Is true, these proud
Philosophers aspired, by this their Demon-worship (the fruit of their Natural
Theology) to reduce themselves to a friendship with the great, though unknown
God: but al their attemts herein proved vain and successelesse; yea al did but
cast them at a greater distance from the true God, into a servile subjection to
Satan the God of this World. The Demon-Theologie, or Will worship of the Pagan
Philosophers was brought into the Christian Church first by the Gnostics, and
afterward by Antichrist; which the Apostle Paul foreseeing does greatly caution
Christians against in the forementioned Epistle, Col. 2.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
specially v. 23. (...). Also in the 1 Timothy 4.1, 2, 3, of which hereafter, when
we come to Antichristian Will Worship, which was but the effect of this Pagan
Demon-worship.

. 5. 5 The Vanity of their Metaphysic Philosophisings about the Soul.
Another part of their Metaphysic Philosophy, or Natural Theology, consistes
in some Traditions and Contemplations touching the Human Soul, its Divine
Origin, Infusion, Separation, and Immortality; concerning which it cannot be
denied but that the Philosophers, specially such as had conversation with the
Jews or Jewish Traditions, had very many good speculations and notions, far
beyond many atheistic spirits of this age; but yet such as were mixed with many
vain corrupt conceptions and gross superstitions: Pre-existence of al Souls.
as (1) They held the Soul to be of Divine extract and origin, according to
that citation of Paul, Act. 17.28. Of which see Court Gent. Part 2. B. 3. C. 9.
Sect. 3.. 3. But yet withal they held the eternal simultaneous production and
Pre-existence of al Souls: which opinion of theirs Origin, with some other of
the Fathers, who did much Pythagorise, are said to have sucked in.
Metempsychosis.
(2) The Philosophers also held the Subsistence, yea Immortality of the Soul
after its disunion from the body; but withal they held also a Metempsychosis
or Transmigration of the Soul into other bodies: which opinion the Jews,
specially the Pharisees, drank in from the Pythagorean Philosophy, if the
Pythagoreans had it not from the Jews first. Purgatory.
(3) The Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophers asserted some kind of
Purgatory, which they called (...), Purification of the Soul by fire; whence
the Papists had their Purgatory, as hereafter, B. 2. C. 2. Sect. 3.. 11.

. 6. But amongst all the pieces of Pagan Metaphysics, 6. The hellish Corruption
of their Magic.
or Natural Theology, none is more corrupt, yea Satanic, than their Magic, or
black Art of Divination, wherein the Pythagoreans and other Philosophers were
greatly versed. That this Satanic Science of Divination, or Witchcraft, so much
in request amongst the wisest of Pagan Philosophers, proceeded originally from,
and in imitation of the Divine Oracles vouchsafed the Jewish Church, will be
evident to any that shall give himself the trouble of drawing a parallel betwixt
the one and the other. That the Pythagoreans were famous for this Art of Magic,
see Jamblicus in the Life of Pythagoras, Cap. 29. Pythagoras, as it is
supposed, had it from the Chaldeans, or Egyptians, or peradventure immediately
from the Jews; amongst whom having observed a spirit of Prophecy, or
Divination vouchsafed them by their God, with which Jeremie, Ezechiel, and
Daniel (who lived much about his time, and with whom some think he had
converse,) were endowed, The four ways of Divination amongst the Jews imitated
by the Pagan Diviners.
he affecting an imitation of them herein, enters into a compact with the Devil
his God in order hereto.

The Jews had four kinds of Divine Revelation. (1) (...) Prophetie: which was
either [1] by externe Vision; or [2] by interne Imagination, or mental Vision,
vouchsafed either to persons sleeping, and so it was called Dreams; or to such
as waked, and so it was called Ecstasie, Apoc. 1.10. Ezech. 1.12. we have both
mentioned, Numb. 12.6. in a Vision and in a Dream. Answerably whereto the Pagan
Diviners had their night-Dreams, and day-Visions, whereby they divined things.
(2) The Jews had a more gentle and commun kind of Enthusiasme, or Divine
Afflation of the Spirit, which they called (...), the Afflate of the holy
Spirit, as in Job, Moses, David, and other Penmen of the Sacred Scripture; who
had also the spirit of Prophetie, though not in such an Ecstatic mode as some
other Prophets, Ezechiel, Daniel, etc. Answerably whereto the Pagan Diviners
had also their milder Enthusiasmes, vouchsafed their Poets by Diabolic
Inspiration. (3) The Jews had their Vrim and Thummim, which was the Oracle by
which God vouchsafed Answers to his People. In imitation whereof Pagan Diviners
had their Teraphim, which Mede on Deuteronomy. 33.8. ( Diatr. 2. page 368.) says, was
amongst these Idolaters answerable to the Vrim and Thummim of the holy
Patriarchs. And such also was the Ephod of the Idolatrous Jews, which they
consulted as their Responsorie, Jud. 8.27, 33. Answerably whereto the Egyptian
Priests (as Elianus and Diodorus write) had their (...), their little image of
Saphir; which was called (...), truth, in imitation of the Jewish Vrim and
Thummim, as Grotius. (4) The Jews had another kind of Divine Revelation, which
they called (...) the daughter of voice, or vocal revelation, which seems
mentioned Numb. 12.8. but was more usual under the second Temple, after the
Vrim and Thummim ceased, whereby God reveled himself to his people, as at
Christ's Baptism, Mat. 3.17. Answerable whereto the Gentiles had their (...),
Aparitions of their Gods, with Vocal tradition or declaration of their minds to
men, which gave the first occasion to their (...), Pillars of Stone, erected as
Memorials of their Gods Aparition, in imitation of the Stone which Jacob
erected at Bethel, as a Memorial of God's Aparition and discourse with him. Of
which more fully, B. 2. C. 2. Sect. 3.. 3.

That this black Art of Divination was in much use, The Art of Divication part
of their Doctrine of Demons.
not only amongst the Poets and Priests, but also amongst the wisest of the
Philosophers, the Pythagoreans and Platonists, is evident by this, that it was
a part of that Doctrine of Demons, or (...), Natural Theology, which did in a
more peculiar manner belong to the Philosophers. So Plato, in his Symposium,
page 202, 203. treating professedly of these Demons, he brings in Socrates
demanding of Diotima, what faculty this his (...), Demon, had. To which
Diotima replies, (...), a faculty of Interpreting the Gods mind, etc. And
having discoursed at large of the Offices of this Socratic Demon, he adds,
(...), from this Demon all the Art of Divination procedes. Whence Mercury the
great Egyptian Demon, was called (...), an Interpreter, as it is supposed, from
and in imitation of Joseph that great Divine Interpreter. Farther, that this
Satanic Art of Divination was part of their Demon-worship, and thence of their
Natural Theology, is evident by what Diogenes Laertius reports of Pythagoras
in his Life. Pythagoras (says he) affirmed, that the whole air was full of
Souls; which he supposed to be Demons and Heroes, by whom there were infused
Dreams and Signs, and Diseases, both into Men and Bestes; from whence arose
Lustrations, Expiations, and al Divinations, and Propheties. Diog. of Pythag.

The great Oracle to which al their Diviners resorted, Apollo their great
Oracle.
was that of the Idol-God Apollo, (whose Temple was erected at Delphus, in
imitation of God's at Jerusalem) and al inferior Vates or Diviners were but his
Interpreters. This is well set forth by Plato in his Io, page 534. (...), The
Vates are nothing else but Interpreters of the Gods. Page 536. he gives us the
manner how their Idol- Apollo inspired these Diviners; (...), God, by the
endeavor of al these, draws the mind of men where he pleases. Plato here
(according to his Allegoric mode) supposes a long chain or series of Diviners
impelled or drawn by their God Apollo, whom he makes to be (...), the prime and
first mover. That this their great Oracle Apollo was no other than the Devil,
is most evident, who is called by the same name in Scripture: as Deuteronomy. 32.17.
he is termed (...) a Destroyer; Deuteronomy. 32.17.
which the Greeks call most properly (...), Apollo; and so Rev. 9.11. the
Devil's name Abaddon, which signifies a Destroyer, is by the Spirit of God
rendered Apollyon, which is the same with Apollo. The origin of the Delphie
Divination.
That Apollo was the great God of Divination is asserted by Augustine, de Civit.
Dei, l. 4. c. 11. In Divinations Apollo, etc. where Lud. Vives on these words
observes, That they supposing this Apollo to be the Sun, i. e. the Eye of the
World, easily believed that he beheld and knew althings, both past, present,
and to come; wherefore he was everywhere consulted, and gave answers, as in
many other places, so specially at Delphus, as Diodorus in the Life of Philip;
whose origin he thus relates: In that place, at the entry of the Delphic
Temple was a Den of a great and obscure winding, unto which a Goat feeding
thereabout ascending, received an Afflation from that subterraneous spirit, and
began in an unusual manner to dance; which the Pastor admiring, he himself
approaching to the mouth of the Den was surprised with a Furor, and began to
foretell things future. This some others attemted, and were affected in like
manner. The matter proceeded thus far, that he who would know things future
brought some, who thrusting in the head into the mouth of the Den might Divine.
Which seeing it could not be done without danger, no, nor without the
destruction of many, the Delphics erected a Temple there to their Divining-God
Apollo; and appointed a Virgin, who setting in the Machine, might safely
receive the Afflation of that Divine spirit, and give answers to such as
consulted the Oracle: Which Machine was called from its three Pillars, Tripos,
as it were of three feet, much of the same form with the usual Tripet. The
Priest was called Pythia, who in the beginning was a Virgin like to Diana.
Afterward a certain Pythia being defloured by Echecrates, the Delphics
rejecting Virgins appointed a Woman no less than fifty years aged; who yet was
to use a Virgin habit, that so the old custom might not altogether perish.
Thus Diodorus Siculus, and out of him Ludov. Vives.

. 7. The nature of Divination out of Plato.
To treat a little more distinctly of the nature of this Pagan Divination,
whereby both its origin and vanity will more fully appear. The Greek name
(...), or (...), is by some derived from (...), because they supposed its cause
to be externe, spiritual, and divine. I find nowhere a more full and clear
account hereof than in Plato, who both in his Timeus, Phaedrus, and more
professedly in his Io treats of this Subject. 1. As to the origin of
Divination, Plato Io, p. 533. says, That Poetic Enthusiasme comes not by Art,
but by a Divine power, like the stone which Euripides called (...), Magnetem,
Loadstone; which stone does not only draw iron-rings, but also puts a virtue
into them to draw others to them. So Prophetic men are inspired by the Muse. 1.
Its origin not by Art but divine Afflation.
Thence he, in his Io, page 534. tells us, That it comes not by Art, but by a
divine power: (...), The Prophets utter these things not by Art, but from a
divine power: For (adds he) Art extendes it self to althings under the same
kind. So again page 536. (...), etc. not by art but by a divine fate, or
afflation. And more particularly in his Phaedrus, page 245. (...), etc. But the
third sort of madness and transport, surprising the tender and inaccessible
mind is from the Muses, exciting and inspiring it unto Enthusiastic Songs and
Poems. But he that undertakes this Prophetic Poesy from a confidence on some
art, is very imperfect, in comparison of him that is possessed with an Ectastic
furor. Wherefore all that Prophetic Poesy, which issues from the mind of a
sober temperate man, vanishes. Truly I could reckon up to thee so many and
more illustrious effects of this furor inspired by God. His design is to show,
that al Poetic Prophecy comes from a Divine Enthusiasme or afflation without
art. Thence he tells us, (...) This furor is given by the Gods with the greatest
felicity. Whence in the Platonic Definitions we find Divination thus defined,
(...), Divination is a science discovering a matter without Demonstration; i. e.
by mere Enthusiasme. 2. The Instruments, Poets and Prophets.
The usual Organs or Instruments the Devil (under the name of Apollo) used to
deliver his Oracles by, were at first the Poets; whence amongst the Grecians
(...) and (...), Poets and Prophets, were of the same import. So Paul, Tit.
1.12. calls one of their Poets Prophet, and Vates signifies both a Poet and
Prophet. Yea the Philosophers (who were many of them Poets also) were not a
little guilty of this Satanic Art, specially the Pythagoreans. These Organs,
Plato tells us, the God used in delivering his Oracles to men: So Io 534, (...),
Wherefore the God whiles he takes from them their mind, uses these ministers
as messengers to deliver his Oracles, and divine Prophets; that we who hear may
understand, that it is not they who are thus deprived of their mind, that speak
things of so great moment, but that it is God that speaks them, and by the
ministry of those men speaks to us. Wherein observe, (1) That the Devil under
the Title of Apollo, and as an Ape of God, deprived his Prophets of their right
mind, and put them into an Ecstatic rapture, thereby to declare unto the World,
that his Oracles came not from the exercitation of Reason, or by Art, but by
Divine Enthusiasme. (2) That the Prophets were but mere Organs used by this
God, to declare his Oracles. Thence he subjoins, (...), etc. We have an
infallible demonstration hereof in Tynnichus Chalcidensis, who never composed
any other Verse worthy of memory, save that Pean in the honor of Apollo, which
is in the mouth of al, and indeed the most excellent of al Poems, which he
himself styles the Invent of the Muses. Now hereby it seems to me that God has
demonstrated, that we may not dout, but that these excellent Poems were in no
regard human, or the product of men's wits, but divine and coming from God; for
the Poets [or Prophets] are no other than Interpreters of God. This description
which he gives of these false Diviners suits well with Gods true Prophets, 3.
These Diviners in an exstatic rapture or fury.
who are but Instruments by which he speaks. (3) Plato tells us that these
Organs or Prophets, which the Demoniac power inspired, were, whilst under this
spirit of Divination, in an Ecstasie or Rapture. So Io 533. (...), Thus
therefore the Muse her self by a certain divine spirit does inspire some; and
by the ministry of such inspired persons there is a series of others inspired
aptly connected. Again, (...) They rage and foam, and are possessed like the
Priests of Bacchus. And page 534. he says, that this his Diviner was (...),
etc. Rapt into a divine ecstasie, and mad, neither did he continue in his
senses or mind, being moved (...), by a divine fate. The meaning is, he was in
an ecstatic rapture, not (compos mentis) in a sound mind. This Plato explains
yet more fully in his Timaeus, page 72. (...), This is a sufficient sign, that
God has vouchsafed this faculty of Divination to human madness: (i.e. to men
furiose:) and he gives this reason for it, because God has planted this power
of Divining in part of the Liver, etc. Then he adds, (...), etc. for no one in
his right mind or senses is inspired by this spirit of Divination, but such
only whose minds and senses are bound up by sleep, or disease, or Enthusiasme,
etc. Herein also the Devil played the Ape, and imitated the Divine mode of
Prophetie, which for the most part was by ecstatic raptures and visions.
Whence, 4. Divination by Enthusiasme.
(4) The usual mode or way by which this their Demoniac spirit inspired or
possessed these ecstatic Prophets, was Enthusiasme. So Plato in that
forementioned place of Timaeus, page 72. None is inspired with this true
divine power of Divination continuing in his mind, (...), But having his
prudence or reason bound either by sleep, or by a disease, or changed by some
Enthusiasme. And then he gives the reason, (...), etc. But it belongs to a
prudent man to understand such things as are spoken, or expressed by certain
signs, either by dream or watching, from the Enthusiastic nature. This
ecstatic (...), Enthusiasme, Plato in his Io makes to be (...), an imitation of
Divine ecstasie or rapture. And indeed it was but a Satanic imitation of Divine
Enthusiasme, which Divines describe to be a Divine extraordinary immediate
Inspiration of God, in the reception whereof the Soul is merely passive, and
yet vehemently moved or agitated thereby, even unto an Ecstasie or Divine
Evagation; as the Apostles were inspired after Christ's Ascension. This
Demoniac Enthusiasme, of which Plato so much treats both in his Timaeus and Io,
was but the Ape of the Divine. (5) Hence, says Plato, These Enthusiastic
Diviners could not judge of their own Divination, but had there Judges.
these Ecstatic Diviners could not judge of their own Enthusiasme, but had
Judges appointed them by the Law. So it follows in that forecited place of
Timaeus, page 72. (...) The work of such an ecstatic Enthusiast, whether he
remain under this Enthusiastic furor, or not, is not to judge of those things
he saw or spoke. -- Hence the Law has appointed a sort of Prophets as Judges
over these divine Vaticinations, which some call Vates, -- which name they are
worthy of, who are certain Interpreters of things uttered in Propheties. Herein
also these Demoniac Diviners imitated the Jewish Prophets, amongst whom there
were some who had a gift or spirit of discerning touching the Prophetic
revelations of others, as 1 Cor. 12.10, Discerning of spirits. 1 Cor. 14.19,
Let the other judge. 1 Cor. 12.10.
So v. 32. which though here perhaps it may be meant of ordinary teaching; yet
there was the same gift of discerning and judging extraordinary Prophets in the
Jewish Church. The end of Divination to breed a friendship with God, and
restore Natural Theology.
(6) The main end or design of this their Demoniae Divination was to bring
them into a Reconciliation, and friendship with God. So Plato in his Symposium,
page 188. (...) Divination is to breed a friendship between God and men;
because it knows those amorose impetuosities that are in men, and tend to
piety or impiety. By which it appears, that the main end or design of those
Natural Theologists in erecting this Demoniac mode of Divination, was to make
up those defects that were in their Natural Theology; thereby to breed a
reconcilement and friendship with their Gods: wherein they also affected an
imitation of Divine Oracles and Propheties, whose main end was to restore lost
man to a friendship with God. And thus far indeed these Demoniac Oracles
attained their end, that they brought such as subjected themselves to them into
a miserable compact and friendship with the Devil, their great Apollo or Soul
destroying God.

. 8. The sundry kinds of Divination.
As for the sundry kinds of Divination, the Philosophers (who were sufficiently
vain herein) were not yet so vain as the Poets or common Prophets: for Plato in
his Timaeus, page 7. makes mention only of three sorts of (...), Enthusiastic
Divination. (1) (...), by sleep or dreams. (2) (...), by some disease or
frenzy. (3) (...), by some Enthusiasme, properly so called. These also were the
chief of the Pythagorean Divinations, and the effects of their Demon-worship;
(as was before observed) wherein they affected an imitation of Divine Oracles.
1. Divination by Dreams.
(1) As for that of Enthusiasme, we have already sufficiently opened it. (2) In
their Divination by Dreams they had their (...), Onirocrites, Judge and
Interpreter of Dreams, as before out of Plato. Apollonius Attalus writ of the
(...), as Artemidorus after him. Diogenes Laertius reports of Diogenes the
Cynic, That when he saw Physicians and Philosophers, he said, Man is the wisest
of al creatures; but when he saw Interpreters of Dreams, Conjecturers,
Prophets, etc. he said, (...), nothing is to be estimed more vain than man. To
some that were affrightned at their Dreams, he said, You consider not the
things you do waking, but your imaginary dreams you curiosely examine. So that
we see some of the Philosophers were not so vain and doting on Dreams as
others. Yet were the Pythagoreans greatly vain in this piece of
Dreaming-Divination: So Epicharmus, (alias Cous) that famous Pythagorean
Philosopher, of whom Tertullian in his Book de Anima, cap. 46. speaks thus, But
Epicharmus with Philochore the Athenian, amongst Divinations gave the chiefest
place to Dreams. He makes mention also of Hermippus, who writ five Books of
Dreams. (3) Their Divination by Diseases may take in that of Sternutation or
Sneesing, which they called (...), and made use of as an instrument of
Divination. This mode of Divination was very ancient. Aristotle, 1. de Animal.
says, That Sternutation was an angural sign, and that the ancients estimed it
ominose. Yea Casaubon, ad Athenae, l. 2. c. 15. says, that they received
Sternutament with Adoration; because they not only thought it sacred, as
Aristotle, but also a God. Thus Salmasius, among the Letters collected by
Beverovicius, Quaest. Epistol. p. 31. Moreover in all good Omens or Auguries
objected to them, they were wont to adore, either God himself, from whom they
conceited the Omen came, or the very Omen it self, if it seemed to have any
thing of Divinity. So that of Xenophon, l. 3. de Expedit. Cyr. must be
understood; where it is said, That all the Soldiers having heard the
Sternutation, (...), with one impetus worshipped the God, i.e. the Sternutament
which they estimed as sacred, and God. And as Sternutation was reputed ominose
among the ancient Grecians and Romans, so also among the later Jews, who were
wont to say to him that sneesed, (...) Good life be to you, i. e. God save you.
If any sneesed in prayer they thought it a good Omen, as Buxtorf. Synagog. c.
5. From this Pagan Superstition of saluting such as sneesed, many Christians in
the times of Papal darkness sucked in the like custom; which continues to
this day in France, where generally al salute such as sneese, and pray, God
save; as if it were a thing very ominose. Thus among the Abassines in Africa,
when their Negus or Emperor sneeseth, he is saluted by all throughout the City
with great solemnity, such as are next him at the Court beginning first, and
thence others following. More of Divination by Sternutation, see Voctius,
Disputat. Part 3. p. 132. Again, the tinkling noise of the ear was by Pagans
used as a medium by which they divined. Likewise the salissation or palpitation
of any member called by them (...), was another mode of their Divination.
Whence Melampos the Hierogrammatist his (...), etc. yet extant; and Suidas tells
us that Possidonius writ his (...), in which he expounded what the sudden
motion of every Member did indicate. Isidorus, Origin. lib. 8. c. 9. acquaints
us, that these Salissators were so called, because when any parts of their
Members suffered a palpitation, or leaping, they foretold something prosperous
or sad to happen. These three were branches of their (...).

. 9. Of Divination by Magic.
They had another kind of Divination strictly called Magic, which was, as they
say, the Invention of the Persians, (whence their wisemen were called Magi)
wherein the Pythagoreans and other Philosophers were not a little versed; of
which Suidas gives this account: (...), Magic truly is the Invocation of the
Demons, those benefactors, for the procuring of some good; such were the
Predictions of Apollonius Tyanaeus. Apollonius Tyanaeus his Magic and
Demon-Doctrines, a type and forerunner of Antichrist, and his Saint-worship.
Whereby we are informed that Magic was a part of the Demon-worship; which as
it is supposed, Pythagoras brought into Greece. That the Pythagoreans were
generally exercised in Magic is a commun opinion. And this Apollonius Tyanaeus,
whom Suidas here brings in for a famous Magician, was indeed of the Pythagorean
Sect, who by his Magic and Sorcerie produced many lying wonders; for which he
was greatly extolled by the Pythagorising Platonistes, Porphyrie and others;
who endeavored to equalize him with Christ in point of Miracles and Divine (or
rather Diabolic) Predictions; thereby to cast a disgrace upon the Christians
Redeemer and Religion, in order to the advancement of their own Natural
Theology or Metaphysics. We have the Life of this Apollonius Tyanaeus writ by
Philostratus, by which it is apparent that al his Predictions and lying wonders
were wrought by commerce with the Devil, who was the Philosophers great (...),
Demon or Diviner. Philostratus having, Chap. 1. shown how much Apollonius
affected an imitation of Pythagoras, procedes Chap. 2. to vindicate him from
the Imputation of Magic. They do, says he, unjustly condemn Apollonius, who
foresaw and foretold many things, as guilty of this crime; as if they should
accuse Socrates, who foreknew many things by his Demon; or Anaxagoras, who knew
many things before they happened, etc. Thence he goes on to give us the
History of his Life, and the many Miracles he did. Hierocles out of this
History of Philostratus, equaliseth this Apollonius, in point of Miracles
wrought, to Christ. Eusebius answers Hierocles, and demonstrates, that al
Apollonius's Miracles were but Lying wonders, or Magic Delusions, wrought by
Diabolic Inspirations. Grotius relates, That there was a statue of his that
spoke, being inspired by some Diabolic spirit, but that his mouth was soon
stopped by the power of Christ, and the preaching of the Gospel. More, in his
Mystery of Godliness, B. 5. C. 7. proves, That there is nothing in the
History of Apollonius that can answer to Christ's Resurrection, etc. It is
evident that al his Prophetic Predictions were but Satanic Delusions. Thus
Grotius understands that Prophetic prediction of Paul, 1 Timothy 4.1, 1 Timothy 4.1.
And the Doctrines of Devils, (...). He mainly points out (says Grotius) the
Pythagoreans; of whom the chief were Magi, Magicians, and had commerce with
Devils or Demons. Amongst those Apollonius Tyanaeus was very famous, who is
here in a more particular manner denoted: for he came to Ephesus while Timothy
yet lived. Though I can no way fall in with Grotius's design, to interpret this
(as he does others) Scripture chiefly of Apollonius Tyanaeus's Magic Art,
thereby to secure Antichrist's Doctrines from the dints of this Prediction; yet
thus far I think we may safely allow him, that this Text may have some eye or
regard to Apollonius Tyanaeus, and other Pythagorean Philosophers, who were the
inventors and promotors of these Doctrines of Demons here mentioned, and so
counter-Christs, or Pagan-Antichrists; and therefore be consequence, great
promotors of those Antichristian Demons and Doctrines, which (by means of their
Philosophy foisted into the Christian Church by the Pythagorising Gnostics)
were now gendring. Thus may we safely understand this (and so other) Scriptures
of the Pythagorean Demons, and particularly of Apollonius Tyanaeus, (who was
famous in that Sect) as he was a Type and forerunner of Antichrist, by reason
of his Pythagorean Doctrines of Demons, and Magic Art, which Antichrist
atterward was to reassume and practice, according to that 2 These 2.9, 2 These.
2.9.
Lying-wonders. And indeed al Antichrist's Lying-wonders, al his Saints, and
Saint-worship, are but Satanic imitamens of the Pythagorean Demon Doctrines,
Worship and Magic; as hereafter, B. 2. C. 2. So that we may well allow this Text
a collateral typic regard to the Pythagoreans, though its principal eye be on
Antichrist and his Demon-Doctrines, as Mede observes.

. 10. Divination 1. by Birds.
There were many other kinds of Satanic Divination, more ordinary and usual
amongst the Priests and vulgar people. As (1) Divination by Birds, which
principally belonged to the Augures: who were so called by the Romans, as if
one should say Avi-geres, because they observed what the Birds did. Now this
Bird-Divination was gathered chiefly by the flying, or singing of Birds. To
which also we may refer their (...) Divination by Cocks, 2. From four
four-footed Bestes.
etc. (2) They had also their Divinations from fourfooted Bestes, specially
their Sacrifices, which belonged to their Aruspices; who were so called from
aras inspiciendo, beholding the intrals of the Sacrifice on the Altar. The
first inventor of this kind of Divination was, as it is said, Tages. There was
in like manner matter of Divination taken from the meeting of four-footed
Bestes; also from the neighing of Horses; but specially from any monstrose
production in nature, or preternatural motion; as if there were any excess or
defect in Nature. 3. From Men.
(3) They had likewise their Divinations from Men, as from the lineaments of
the Body; (...), Chiromantie, from the Hand: (...), Physiognomie from the
Face; also from meeting of Men, from casualties at Festes, and from dead
persons, which they called (...), Necromantie. Hornius Hist. Philos. l. 5. c.
2. speaks thus of (...), Chiromantie, etc. There is no dout to be made but this
Art was most ancient, and had its rise in the East, where that mad study of
Astrology flourished. For when they perceived the Influences of the Heavens on
these Inferiors, it remained that they showed the convenance of these Inferiors
with the Superiors. Therefore making Man a little World, they reduced each of
his parts to the Celestial lineaments. Whence sprang that Discipline called by
the Greeks (...), which they distributed into (...), and (...). 4. From Herbs.
(4) They had their Divinations from Plants, called (...), 5. From Inanimates.
practiced by Witches. (5) They had their Divinations from Inanimates; [1] From
Natural Elements, Water, Earth, Fire.
as [1] from the Elements: from Water, which they called (...). So Numa, to
prove that his Sacred Constitutions came from the Gods, was compelled to make
an Hydromantie, affirming that he saw in the Water the Images of the Gods, or
rather the Devils, from whom he received his Constitutions. And Caesar says,
there were Women in Germany, who divined from the course and noise of Waters.
They had also their Divination from the Earth, called (...), from the Fire
called (...), from the Smoke called (...). [2] They had also their Divinations
from Celestial Bodies; [2] From Celestial Bodies, Stars, Meteors, etc.
from the Stars called (...), Astrology; wherein the Chaldeans were much
versed: from Thunder and Lightening, etc. [3] They had likewise their
Divinations from things Artificial, as (1) from Glasses; which they called
(...) and (...). [3] From things Artificial.
(2) From Sieves, called (...). (3) From Keys, called (...). (4) From Axes,
called (...). (5) From Rings, (...). (6) From Phials, (...): (7) From Meal,
(...). (8) From a Basin, (...). (9) From Lots, (...). Of these sundry kinds of
Divination, see more Lud. Vives, in August. de Civit. l. 7. c. 35. Vossius de
Philosophia, p. 1. c. 22. and our Philosoph. General. p. 1. l. 1. c. 4. Sect.
9.. 8. So monstrose and Hel-bred was the Ethnic Divination and Natural
Theology.

. 1. The Corruption of Philosophy from its Symbolic form or mode.
WE have hitherto endeavored a Demonstration of the Vanity of Pagan
Philosophy from its original Causes and Matter, both Natural, Moral, and
Supernatural: We now proceed to make good and strengthen the said Demonstration
from the Consideration of that Vanity which attended the formal nature and
proprieties of the same. And herein we shall begin with the Pythagorean, which
was the source and most principal part of all the Grecian Philosophy; yea, that
which had the most cognation with, and ressemblance of the sacred fountains
from whence it was, though by very corrupt derivations at first traduced. So
that by proving the vanity of the Pythagorean Philosophy, which was the most
noble, and so the measure of all the rest, our Conclusion will hold much more
true of the other Parts and Sects. The Form or Mode of Philosophising (as we
have frequently observed) amongst the Pythagoreans was Symbolic and Enigmatic:
yea indeed this was the usual mode of Philosophising amongst the Ancients
before Aristotle's time, as he himself confesses; which we no way dout they
took up in imitation of the Jewish Church; as it is well observed by Clemens
Alexandr. lib. 1. (...), The ancient mode of Philosophising was Hebraic and
Enigmatic: Therefore they embraced short speaking, which is most apt for
admonition, and most profitable. That this mode of Symbolic discourse was
frequent amongst the Jews in Pythagoras's time is apparent from what we find in
Ezechiel, (who is thought to be Contemporary with, yea the Instructor of
Pythagoras) as Ezech. 17.2. Put forth a riddle and speak a parable, or Symbol.
Now albeit this mode of Symbolic Philosophising was originally Divine, and very
useful for the infant-state of the world, in that it affordes the fantasy
most pleasant and lively colors or images of truth; yet was it not without much
vanity and corruption as made use of by those ancient Philosophers, both
Pythagoreans and others. The origin of Symbolic Philosophy and its vanity.
And the great principe on which this Symbolic mode of Philosophising was
founded, was this: (...), Things sensible are but Imitamens of things
intelligible. i. e. There is nothing in this inferior sensible world, but does
ressemble something in the superior Intelligible world: sensible forms are but
Symbolic Images of insensible perfections. Whence these blind Philosophers (who
traded in Oriental Jewish Traditions) were mighty greedy in catching after
every sensible form, corporal image or shadow, whereby Divine Truths were set
forth: wherein none abounded more than the Jewish Church, which was the chief
seat of al Symbolic Wisdom. Hence therefore those Grecians derived either
immediately or mediately the chief of their Symbolic learning, both as to matter
and form: But not understanding the true mind and scope of these Jewish
Symbolic Mysteries, they at first amused themselves in contemplating the shel,
cabinet, or bone only, without ever attaining unto the kernel, jewel, or marrow
of Divine Truths. Thence having satiated their fantasies, and glutted their
curiosity in their dreaming contemplations of those Jewish Symbols, without
any real notion of those Truths which were wrapped up therein, they coin an
infinity of fables or false images, which they mix with those Jewish
Traditions they met with in their travels; and herein their fantasies (which
are the greatest Apes in the world) were so skilful and unwearied, as that they
soon rendered the whole body of their Symbolic Philosophy cloudy, dark, vain
and monstrose; no way like its original Idea in the Jewish Church. This Grecian
itch and humor of coining, fables (not for the illustration, but to the
darkening of truth) the Jews also when they came under the Grecian Monarchy,
sucked in to the prejudice of their Religion; wherein they were in like manner
followed by those carnal Gospellers the Pythagorising Gnostics in the Christian
Church: and al was by the father of Liars made use of as the foundation of
Antichrists throne, which was founded on Lying-wonders, or fabulose lies, as 2
These. 2.9. And this is a good key to open to us those bitter invectives used by
the Apostles, specially Paul, against those Pythagorean and Jewish fables,
which the Gnostics then endeavored, and Antichrist after them, to bring into
the Temple of Christ. And it seems there was none more infested with these
fable-coining Pythagorising Dreamers, than the Church at Ephesus, where
Apollonius Tyanaeus, that great Pythagorean Sorcerer, had been, and as it is
thought infused some of his poison about the same time that Timothy resided
there. Also there were many Jews at Ephesus, who in this faculty of coining
Fables and Wonders fully jumped with the Pythagoreans; and both joining their
forces had a mighty influence on those many Gnostic Antichristian Fables, which
creeped into the Christians Theology. Whence we see the ground why Paul in
both his Epistles to Timothy, gives such severe censures of and cautions
against this Pythagorising Jewish humor of Fable-framing Philosophy; which he
then saw creeping into the Church, and which he foresaw would give a mighty
lift to help Antichrist on his throne. 1 Timothy 1.3.
So 1 Timothy 1.3, I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus. Paul saw these
Pythagorising Judaising Gnostics creeping into the Church at Ephesus, and by
their Pythagorean Jewish Fables laying a foundation for Antichrist; wherefore
he besought Timothy to continue at Ephesus, and behave himself there as a
stout Soldier of Christ, against those Gnostic Antichristian false Teachers. So
it follows: (...), That thou may charge some that they teach no other
doctrine: i.e. That they do not overthrow the Gospel of Christ by their
Pythagorean and Jewish Fables, as he expresses himself v. 4. (...), Neither
give heed to fables. Ver. 4. (...).
(...) is a Philosophic notion, and amongst them it signified a Symbol or
Fable, whereby they expressed some Philosophic mystery. (...) and (...) are
much of the same import amongst the Philosophers. Thus Plato often makes mention,
(...), Of a Syrian and Phenician Fable; also (...), of an ineffable fable,
whereby he understandes some Oriental Hebraic Tradition. But (...) signifies
also a feigned Oration, Fable, or fictitious discourse: thence it is expounded
by Hesychius, (...), vain false speech, representing truth. Thus it is taken in
the New Testament, as here, so C. 4. v. 7. 2 Timothy 4.4. Tit. 1.14. 2 Pet. 1.16.
of which hereafter. (...) does here also take in the Jewish Fables, which these
vain Gnostics so much addicted themselves unto. So Grotius on this place: The
Apostle treats here (says he) of such as were converted from Judaisme to
Christianisme, and mixed Jewish Fables with Christianity, as it appears by
what follows, also by Tit. 1.14, etc. Such were those Jewish Fables concerning
those things which God did before the beginning of the world; of the first man
which God made (...), ( i.e. partly man and partly woman) of his copulation
with the bestes, and with Lilith, with the Demons that sprang thence; of
Behemoth and Leviathan; of the Pre-existence of Souls before the Body; of
Angels their distribution into Stars and Regions; with the like. These Fables,
though they were entertained by the Jews, yet were they many of them of
Pythagorean extract; namely that of the first man's being (...), which also
Plato asserted; likewise the opinion of the Souls Pre-existence; to which we
might add that of the Metempseuchosis, which the Jews also, together with the
Pythagoreans and Platonistes asserted. It follows: (...), (...).
and endless Genealogies. These Genealogies the Jews call (...), because they
supposed successive Productions and Emanations one after another. So Philo
Judaeus discourses much of such Genealogies. The origin of these fabulose
Genealogies began with the first Poets, Orpheus, Hesiod, etc. Pherecydes also
had his (...), and the Pythagoreans after him filled up much of their Theology
with such fictitious Genealogies, whom the Jews followed herein, as also the
Gnostics; the most of whose Divinity consisted of (...) and (...),
Conjunctions, and from them Genealogies, how one thing joining with another
begets a third; whence sprang their Aeones or fabulose Gods. So Grotius here:
They feigned Emanations and Productions of one from the other: for which they
would seem more learned than others, and so despised other Christians as more
rude; whence they assumed the name of (...), Gnostics. I do not conceive that
they were called Gnostics in the Apostles times, but in the following Age,
partly from their own Pretensions to a (...), i. e. an high speculative, mystic
knowledge; and partly from those Characters which are given them in Scripture,
as hereafter. Indeed the whole of their Theology seems to have consisted only
of some mystic Fables and Genealogies, borrowed from the Pythagorean
Philosophy and Cabalistic Traditions. It follows: (...), which minister
questions rather. i. e. These Pythagorean Jewish Fables, and Genealogies, taken
up by these carnal Gnostics, produce nothing but vain Questions, which the
Rabbines call (...), than edification of God in faith. As if he had said, these
Pythagorising Gnostics pretend to make use of these their Mystic Fables and
Genealogies, as explications of Evangelic Dispensations and Mysteries; but
indeed they effect nothing less; for the Oeconomie of the Gospel holds forth a
plain and simple way of believing in Christ, Verse. 5.
without such fabulose narrations. So v. 5. (...), Now the end of the
Commandment is Love. i.e. The scope and drift of our Gospel is Divine Love;
whereas their pretended (...), or fabulose Speculations tend only to foment
endless disputes and strises about words. Then our Apostle procedes to give us
the true Genealogy of Divine Love, in opposition to the fabulose Genealogies
of those Pythagorising Gnostics: (...), out of a pure hears, and of a good
conscience, and of faith unfeined. Paul (says Grotius) gives us a short but
very useful Genealogy. The Pythagoreans, and Jews after them, make much ado
about the Genealogies of Virtues. Philo Judaeus (who did greatly Pythagorise)
turns much of the History of the Old Testament into Allegoric Genealogies of
Virtues, etc. The Gnostics followed in the same paths: Paul here gives us an
easy and familiar Genealogy of true Christian Love, in opposition to all
their Mystic Fables, which tended only to turn them aside to vain janglings.
So v. 6. (...), From which some having swarved have turned aside to vain
jangling. Ver. 6.
(...) primarily notes such an one as unhappily erres from his scope or marque:
Thence (...) signifies, either properly or figuratively, not to reach the
marque. These Pythagorising Gnostics aimed at high Speculation and Mystic
Notions, but they reached not their marque or end, but fell into a vain
contention and strife about words. (...) were such as busied themselves only in
vain disputes, as Tit. 1.10. or fabulose narrations, as these Gnostics here,
who would fain pass for some grand Sophists or Teachers. So v. 7. (...), Ver.
7.
desiring to be teachers of the Law. That first notion (...) is very emphatic,
denoting here an ardent desire and ambitiose affectation of a name and repute
for Doctors of the Law. There were (says Grotius) many Jews at Ephesus, some
of whom embraced Christianity, but in show only, retaining much of Judaisme.
Amongst their Jewish Fables they asserted a Colloque of the Law with God before
the Creation of the World; they would that the World should have been made for
the Law. Thus fabulose and vain were these Pythagorising Jews and Gnostics, who
delighted themselves in nothing more than in unintelligible fables. So it
follows: (...), understanding neither what they say, neither whereof they
affirm: i. e. they wholly give up themselves to fabulose Genealogies and
Mystic Traditions, which they neither understand, nor yet can affirm any thing
positively of, as Tit. 3.8. which Fables are directly opposite, (...), verse.
10. as also to that great Evangelic Cabala or Divine Tradition touching Christ,
v. 15, This is a faithful saying and worthy of al acceptance, 1 Timothy 1.15.
(...).
that Christ came into the world to save sinners, whereof I am chief. Our
Apostle had in ver. 4. given a caution against those Pythagorean Cabalistic
Fables and Genealogies, which the carnal Gnostics had sucked in, to the great
prejudice of Evangelic Mysteries: in this v. 15. he gives them a Divine Cabala
(in opposition to their fabulose Cabala, ver. 4.) (...), and worthy of al
acceptance. (...) answers to the Hebrew (...) Cabala, unto which our Apostle
seems here to allude, as Paulus Fagius has observed on Deuteronomy. 5.27. Our Apostle,
says he, alludes to that Cabalistic mode: as if he had said, If any affect to
hear a Cabala, I will show unto him the true certain and undouted Cabala, which
is no other than this, That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
etc. The origin of the Jewish Cabala.
For the more full explication hereof, we must know that the Jews, when they
came under the Grecian Monarchy, imbibed together with many other gross
corruptions this mythologic fabulose mode of Philosophising, which was so
commun amongst the Grecian Philosophers, specially the Pythagoreans, and indeed
proved the bane of the Jewish Religion, as we shall show hereafter. For look as
Pagan Philosophy was in its origin but a corrupt Imitamen of Sacred History
and Mysteries, so the great corruptions which crept into the Jewish Church
after the Babylonian Captivity, had their foundation in some corrupt Imitation
of Pagan Philosophy; amongst which this of their Jewish Cabala was one of the
worst. For these vain Jews growing weary of the plain and familiar simplicity
of Sacred Revelations, fall in love with that Mythologic, Symbolic, Enigmatic,
or Mystic kind of Philosophising, which they observed amongst the Grecians,
specially the Pythagoreans. This fabulose and Mystic mode of Philosophising
they make use of in their Commentaries on the Sacred Scriptures, which they
called (...) a Cabala, i.e. a reverential reception of their Rabbis
Traditions: wherein they grew so vain and fabulose, that there was not the most
plain, naked, and Historic Text, but they would bring it under some Cabalistic,
Enigmatic or Mystic sense: which they caled (...), or (...) the hidden sense,
which must be curiosely searched into. Whence it grew into a commun saying
amongst these Cabalists, That there was no Scripture without its Cabalistic or
Mystic sense. These Pythagorising Cabalists were at first followed by the
licentiose Gnostics, whose whole design was to compose a flesh-pleasing
Theology out of Pythagorean and Jewish Dogmes and Fables, which were afterward
greedily received by Antichrist and his Adherents; who glory much in their
Mystic, or rather fabulose sense and interpretation of Scriptures. Yea it
cannot be denied but that some of the Fathers, specially Origin (who being of
the Alexandrian Schole did much Pythagorise) were too guilty of mixing their
Fables, Allegories, or Mystic sense with Divine Revelations. All this the Spirit
of God foresaw; and therefore he abounds the more in his Divine Cautions
against such Pythagoric, Cabalistic, Mystic and fabulose mixtures in sacred
Theology. 1 Timothy 4.7. (...).
We find the like sacred premonition, 1 Timothy 4.7. (...), But refuse profane and
old wives fables. (...), from (...) an old woman, signifies anile, or absurd,
ridiculose. He understandes, says Grotius, the doctrine (...), of the
Metempseuchose or Transmigration of Souls from one body to another, which is
the foundation of this (...), abstinence. These Fables are first profane,
because they are bottomed on no Divine Revelation; thence they are old wives
fables, i. e. absurd, like such as old wives recite to Children. That this
fable of the Metempseuchose, which Grotius conceives to be here understood, was
indeed of Pythagorean extract, has been at large proved. This and other Fables
these Pythagorising Gnostics made the foundation of their Abstinences, wherein
they were afterward followed by Antichrist, whose Doctrines of Demons were but
one great fable or lie; which the Apostle here dehortes al Christians from,
under the name of Timothy, whom he exhortes rather to exercise himself to
Godliness: But exercise thy self rather to Godliness. (...), properly
signifies to exercise in the Gymnade. It follows, v. 8, 9, (...), etc. Of which
see hereafter, B. 2. C. 2. S. 3.. 10. Our Apostle gives the like exhortation to
Titus, whom he left in Crete to preserve those Churches from the leven of the
Jewish and Gnostic infusions. So Tit. 1.14, Not giving heed to Jewish fables:
Tit. 1.14. (...).
There were in Crete many Jews, who had sucked in this Grecian humor of coining
Fables. They had their Fables concerning Behemoth, Leviathan, (...),
Metempseuchosis; also of their Messiah his being a temporal Monarch, his War
with Gog and Magog, etc. which they took up in imitation of the Grecian Fables.
By all this we see how much Vanity and Corruption ensued upon that Mythologic,
Symbolic, Enigmatic, or Mystic mode of Philosophising, which was at first taken
up, in imitation of Sacred Oracles, by the Phenicians and Egyptians, from whom
the Grecians derived it; and from these the Jewish Cabalists, after their
subjection to the Grecian Monarchy, brought it back again and mixed it with
their Divine Oracles and Mysteries, to the great prejudice of their Religion,
as also of the Christian: for the Pythagorising Judaising Gnostics, to save
themselves from persecution, did herein symbolise both with the Jews and
Grecians, as also Antichrist and al his adherents, who have been as fruitful
in fabulose mystic Theology, as the Grecians, Jews, or Gnostics ever were.

. 2. Having demonstrated the Vanity and Corruption of Philosophy, The Vanity
of Philosophy in regard of its Proprieties.
specially Symbolic, from its form or mode, we now proceed to demonstrate the
same from its Proprieties. And herein we shall only mention such Proprieties, as
the Philosophers themselves have made essential to true Philosophy; showing
how defective, yea corrupt their Philosophy was in regard of those very
Attributes, which they themselves constituted as essential thereto. 1. The
desicience of Philosophy as to truth.
For, 1. The Philosophers generally supposed that Truth was an essential
ingredient, yea the spirit of al Philosophy. This Plato largely proves, Repub.
6. page 485, etc. where he affirms, That there could not be (...), any thing
more proper to Wisdom than Truth; whence he adds, that it was impossible that
the same nature should be (...), a Philosopher and yet a lover of falsehood.
That truth is an essential Attribute, yea indeed the principal end of al true
Philosophy, see Philosoph. General. P. 2. l. 3. c. 1. Sect. 3.. 1. Now that all the Pagan Philosophy was greatly defective, and thence vain in regard of this
Propriety, is evident in that it was not only for a great part fabulose and
false, but wholly shadowy and conjectural only. 1. It was for the most part
false.
(1) That a great part of the Ethnic Philosophy was fabulose and false, has
been already sufficiently demonstrated from its effential parts both Matter and
Form, namely that al Physic Speculations about the origin of the Universe,
its first Matter, Form, and Privation, etc. were but fabulose, and for the most
part false Traditions about the first Creation: that their Ethics were but
false, or at best imperfect Ideas of Virtues: that their Politics were but
carnal, and so false Reasons of State; and therefore styled in the Scripture,
tromperie, deceit and lies, as Psalm. 119.113, 118, 128, 163. That the whole of
their Theology, as to their Doctrine of Demons, etc. was most corrupt and
Idolatric. We have al summed up, Romans 1.28. (...), i.e. a drossy, spurious,
reprobate mind or judgment. 2. Philosophy but a night-day.
(2) That the whole of Pagan Philosophy was but (...), (according to the
Platonic notion) a cloudy dark nocturne Philosophy, is most apparent; whence
it also follows, that it had little of truth in it: for all true knowledge
supposes ideal existence or in-being of the Object in the Understanding; also
that this existence, which the Object has in us, be agreeable to the existence
it has in it self, otherwise our conceptions of it cannot be said to be true.
For what is knowledge but the Imitamen, Idea, or Image of a thing impressed on
the Mind? how then can any have a true knowledge of a thing, unless the
subjective Idea in his mind exactly answer to the objective Idea of the thing
in it self? Yea, he that Philosophiseth on a thing truly, must have in his
formal conceptions the latitude, and other dimensions of the thing; also its
Causes, Proprieties, Qualities, Operations and natural effects, al which
suppose the inherence of the thing in the mind, (not Physically, but) in its
ideal form or image, as Digby has at large proved, in his discourse of the
Soul. Now how vastly short these poor blind Philosophers came of such true
ideas and notions of things is easy to guess by their own Confessions. Plato
ingenuously confesses, That al men did but as it were dream in their
contemplations and notions of things: And this dreaming Philosophy he thus
describes, Repub. 5. p. 476. (...), To dream, is when a man counts that which
is like to another, not like, but the same with that other, to which it is
like. So again, says he, (...), etc. Men curiose to hear and see are much taken
with beautiful, words and colors, and figures, and whatsoever proceeds hence:
(...), but it is impossible for the mind of such to see and embrace the nature
of beauty it self, (he means God.) Then he adds, That such as judge of good
things, but yet cannot judge of good it self, or the first Beauty, can be said
only, (...), to live in a sleep or dream. Such he calls, page 480. (...), Lovers
of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom; which is a true character of all the
Philosophers. The like Plato adds, Repub. 7. page 534. (...), Such an one
knows not either good it self, or any other good; but if he has attained to
some shadow of good, it is rather in opinion than certain knowledge: and thence
the life which he now leads is as it were sleepy and buried in the vain Images
of Dreams, until he awake; and so descendes into Hell, there to take an eternal
nap. I grant Plato in this and the forementioned citations speaks not
universally of al Philosophers, but only of some who rested satisfied in the
contemplation of some lower shadows, pictures, or reflections of good, but
contemplated not the supreme original Good, Beauty it self, or God: But yet
upon the supposition of his Position, viz. That al true Philosophy leads men
unto and terminates on God, the knowledge, love and imitation of him, as (...),
the first Beauty and Good it self; this, I say, being granted, (as it is
eternally true) hence our assertion will necessarily follow, that the wisest of
these blind Philosophers were indeed but Dreamers, void of al true practic
knowledge of God. But will you hear Plato speaking Categorically and universally
of the whole mass of Mankind plunged in Cimmerian darkness? Consult then what
he lays down in his Repub. 7. page 514. Let us suppose (says he according to
his Allegoric mode) a Subterraneous habitation in the fashion of a Den, whose
entrance lies open at a great distance; in which there are men even from their
infance bound neck and heels together, lying on the ground, and beholding
nothing but what lies before them, without being able to turn their heads: Let
there be likewise a fire kindled over head behind their backs afar off: Let
there be also a way made betwixt the persons bound and the fire, for men to
pass up and down, and a wall made some distance from the way, and over-topping
it: Then let men walk up and down, carrying statues and vesseles of al sorts,
sometimes talking, sometimes silent: Hence let their some shadows of the
shining fire fall upon the opposite part of the Den; neither let these men
behold any thing save these shadows: without dout they will think these shadows
to be the things themselves, and the truth of the very things: they will think
also the words of the men walking over head to be the words of these shadows.
Such is the state of these men lying bound in darkness: The Den is this World
in which we men lie prostrate on the ground bound by chains of native
ignorance, so that we cannot turn our heads about, whence we cannot
contemplate the true light (...), of Being, [ i. e. God] or (...), of other
Beings; but we can see only the shadows of things, which yet we guess are the
things themselves; and thus we accommodate our words, which are (...), the
symbols of things, etc. Thus Plato ingenuously acknowlegeth man's native
ignorance, in words worthy of a Christian. He says p. 533. that Human nature
is fallen into a gulf of darkness and ignorance: (...), The eye of the soul is
immerst in the barbaric mire of Ignorance. Again he tells us, Rep. 7. p. 521. how
the Soul may be delivered from these chains of native ignorance, and that his
Philosophy was intended for this use: (...), To be is the knowledge of the
reduction of the Soul from its night-day (or ignorance) to the true knowledge of
Being. (or God.) This knowledge of God he calls (...), the Idea of the chiefest
Good: also the Contemplation (...), of being, not according to opinion, but
according to essence. This he terms (...), true Philosophy; which he and al
those of his Tribe were void of. For albeit they pretended to some Metaphysic
Contemplations touching the first Being, yet that they were without any true
Idea of God, and so without true Philosophy, I think is evident by what has
been said. But the Scripture speaks more fully of the falsehood and vanity of
Pagan Philosophy: so in that famous Text, Col. 2.8, Philosophy and vain
deceit; i.e. as Grotius, vain and deceitful Philosophy. So 1 Timothy 6.20, 1 Timothy
6.20.
(...), of false knowledge; which Grotius understands of the Pythagorising
Gnostics, their Philosophic infusions. (...) from (...) a lie, signifies
primarily falsely so called, assuming a name not belonging to it, or, not
answering its name. These Pythagorising wanton Gnostics affected the name of
Mysterious science, or knowledge; they would fain pass for knowing men, such as
had a deep insight into the most abstruse Mysteries: But Paul assures us, That
al their Mystic science was but falsely termed such: their spinose and argute
questions were but frivolous and vain, imbibed from the Pythagorean source, and
no way deserving the name of true science. So Clemens Alexandr. applying this
Scripture to the Gnostics, says, (...), as pride and arrogant opinion spoiled
Philosophy, so false knowledge, knowledge, etc. With which that of Plato suites
well, (...), I think nothing has done so much hurt to man as false opinion. To
all which we may add that of our Lord, Luke 11.35, Take heed that the light
which is in thee be not darkness; i.e. content not thy self with (...), a
dark, spurious, false night-Philosophie, etc.

. 3. A second Propriety of true Philosophy, according to the Philosophers
themselves, 2. Propriety of vain Philosophy, that it is only Traditional,
Equivocal and Artificial, not Intuitive and native.
is that it be a contemplation of things, (...), or (...), not only by
phantasmes or imaginations, but according to the nature or essence of the
things themselves: i. e. al true Philosophy gives a natural or native Idea of
things; it is substantial, solid, real, intuitive knowledge. But now it is
apparent, that Pagan Philosophy was but artificial imitamens, traditional emty
notions, and aerial speculations about the pictures of things; they never saw
nor yet understood the things themselves, more than by some broken corrupt
Tradition. And surely this gives us a great demonstration of its vanity. We
have sufficiently proved, that al Pagan Philosophy was no other than
traditional imperfect corrupt Imitamens of Jewish Revelations and wisdom.
Those blind Philosophers had no substantial, real, native, intuitive
Contemplation of those things about which they Philosophised; they could obtain
no more than some artificial pictures, or rather shadows only of the first
principes of Nature, of God, and of other Divine Mysteries, which were
conveyed to them by some broken oriental Jewish Traditions; these did much
please their fantasies, (as pictures do Children) but gave them no solid,
real, intuitive notices or Ideas of those Divine things they related to. Now we
know Pictures or artificial Images give but equivocal, Pagan Philosophy but an
equivocal picture, not an univocal image or idea of truth.
not univocal or natural representations. Al know what a vast difference there
is betwixt a real substantial intuitive view of the Sun in the Firmament, and
the mere artificial equivocal Contemplation of its picture on a Signe-post: or
betwixt the view of a Country with our own eyes, and the viewing of it in a
Map, or by Tradition: such is the difference betwixt the Mimic, Traditional,
Artificial Philosophy of the Pagans, and the real, substantial, native,
univocal Wisdom vouchsafed the Jewish Church. That al Pagan Philosophy was
but an equivocal image, an artificial picture, or rather but an imperfect dark
traditional shadow of Divine Wisdom and Philosophy, may be easily gathered by
their own concessions: so Plato, Repub. 10. (...), Mimes or imitators make only
phantasmes or pictures, not things. This he more fully explicates elsewhere,
telling us, That imitation is the third degree from truth; for it considers not
the things themselves, but their (...), Idols or pictures, (...), making
phantasmes of thing. Again, Repub. 10. he adds, (...), The Mime will neither
know nor think aright of those things he imitates as to good or evil. This he
does more fully explain in what follows, (...), The Imitator knows nothing
worthy of reason about those things he imitates; but imitation is but a kind of
jest or play, not a serious study. This he proves in that al imitation is
employed only in drawing shadows of things, it reaches not the things
themselves. This indeed is an exact character of Pagan Philosophy, which was
but an artificial imitation of, or shadow reflected from Jewish Wisdom and
Mysteries. These Gentile Philosophers, the most sharp-sighted of them, saw
those Divine Mysteries they so boldly Philosophised on in a Mimic broken
glass, or abstract Idea only, conveyed to them by some imperfect corrupt
Tradition; they had not any real intuitive vision or contemplation of the
things themselves in their own native Idea, Proprieties and Effects. Thus much
is acknowleged by Plato, Repub. 5. page 476. where speaking of such as were
very curiose to hear sweet words, and contemplate beautiful colors and figures,
he says, (...), It is impossible for the reason of such intuitively to behold
and embrace the nature of beauty it self. This which he applies to particulars
is universally applicable to the whole tribe of Pagan Philosophers, who
received sweet sounds, and saw some beautiful colors, figures, and pictures of
Divine things in the broken glass or abstract of Jewish Tradition, but never
had an intuitive contemplation of those Divine Mysteries shining in their own
real, native, gloriose Ideas on the glass of Sacred Revelation in the Jewish
Church. Thus much indeed seems acknowleged by Plato himself in the aforesaid
place, Repub. 5. page 476. (...), Are there not very few if any who are able to
know and contemplate beauty it self, [ i.e. God] according to himself? i.e.
intuitively. Whence he adds, (...); Is not this therefore true knowledge, to
contemplate the first Being in his native perfections, (...), as being, under
this reduplication? Again, Repub. 5. page 480. Plato concludes thus, (...), Such
therefore as have embraced this singular self-Being, are to be called
Philosophers, not Opiniators, or lovers of opinion. i. e. None deserve the name
of Philosophers, but such as have had a real intuition and contemplation of
God; al others are but lovers of phantasmes, pictures, or opinions. And Plato
in his Philebus, page 40, gives us a more particular (...), or discrimination
of such Philosophers as had this intuitive, real knowledge, (...), Virtuose
persons have for the most part true ideas or images engraven on their minds,
because they are Theophilists, or beloved of God, but wicked men have for the
most part the contrary. These (as he elsewhere adds) contemplate only
beautiful colors and pictures, not beauty it self. And if so, we may certainly
conclude, that there was not one of those Heathen Philosophers that was truly
such as they pretended to be; for they were al wicked men, and therefore could
not have a real, native, intuitive contemplation of God, who is Beauty it
self, which they make to be essential to al true genuine Philosophy. Col.
2.18.23. (...).
Thus much also our Apostle, in his discourse of that vain Pythagorean
Philosophy, which was sucked in by the Gnostics, Col. 2.18, 23. v. 18. he
speaks of their intruding into things they had not seen. (...) signifies,
proudly invading or intruding into things beyond their reach; as before, c. 1..
3. i.e. They pretended to an intuitive knowledge of Angels, etc. but Paul gives
a true character of al their Philosophy, v. 23. which things have indeed a
show of wisdom; (...), i. e. of some excellent Philosophic Contemplations, or
sublime notions, which seem rather to be dropped from Heaven than invented by
men: but all this, says our Apostle, is but a show. (...), i.e. says Erasmus,
a species or form, as it is opposed to a thing or substance; they had only a
picture and artificial form of wisdom, or rather a false opinion, or apparent
shadow, not a real substantial intuitive contemplation of things. This our
Apostle affirms universally of the Jewish wisdom or Philosophy in its
degenerate state, Romans 2.20. (...).
Romans 2.20. (...), a form of knowledge. (...) signifies the form of a thing
that is beheld; and being translated to the mind it signifies the impressing or
forming of an idea of the thing thereon; but here it seems to import only an
abstract form, or artificial scheme, and picture of truth; so Oecumenius,
(...), manifesting that they had not the true knowledge and godliness, but an
artificial image; for they had the scheme of truth, not the substance. Thence
Hesychius expounds (...) by (...), an artificial scheme; and Phavorinus, by
(...), a feigned scheme, form, or picture of true knowledge; how much short
were the blind Pagans of any real, solid, substantial knowledge of things
Divine? Is not this proper only to the true Church and people of God? Thence
it is said, Prove. 2.7, Prove. 2, 7.
He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous. (...) signifies primarily, that
which really is essence, substance; thence it notes real, solid, and
substantial wisdom, such as carries with it an essential true Idea of the
thing known; which as to things Divine is proper only to the real Christian.
The same we find, Prove. 3.21, Keep sound wisdom.

. 4. Hence it follows, that al Pagan Philosophy is only universal and general,
not particular and experimental; 3. Pagan Philosophy vain; because only
general, not particular and experimental.
which gives us a farther demonstration of its imperfection and vanity,
specially as to Morals and Metaphysics. For Aristotle rightly informs us, that
universal knowledge in matters of practice is vain, but particular more true. So
Aristot. Eth. lib. 2. cap. 7. (...), In Practic discourses universals are more
vain, but particulars more true; for Actions are about singulars. This the
Civilian has well observed: Then only (as Aristotle says) we know any thing,
when its parts are known and considered by us. i. e. When its Causes, Effects,
Adjuncts, Qualities and Parts are apprehended by us. And it is a received
opinion in the Schools, That to know a thing in universal, as to the thing
known, is more imperfect than to know it in particular; though an universal
knowledge, as to the medium of knowing, be more perfect than a particular. Now
this was the case of al those Pagan Philosophers, they had only some General
Ideas, or loose broken notices of those things they discoursed of; they had not
any particular apprehension of the Parts, Qualities, Causes, Influences, and
Effects of things, specially such as depended on Divine Revelation: They had
only some general rumors, or traditional notions of God, his Divine
Perfections, Operations and Effects of Providence; they had only some
traditional fragments of the first Origin of the Universe, the state of
Innocence, the Fall of Man, etc. but al their Philosophisings on, or notions of
these things were only general, and so very imperfect and vain. Yet the main of
their vanity in this regard lay not so much in Naturals as in Morals and
Supernaturals: For it cannot be denied, but that many of the Pagan Philosophers
had very particular, experimental, and curiose Contemplations about Natural
things; they were very exact in anatomising the bowels of Nature, and gathering
up a Systeme of Natural Experiments, which is the choicest part of Natural
Philosophy, as it appears by Aristotle's excellent History of Animals, and
Theophrastus his Discourse of Plants; wherein they have excelled most of this
later age. But yet as to Ethics and Metaphysics their Philosophy was only
traditional, general, and notional, not particular and experimental; and
therefore very vain and useless. This also may be demonstrated out of Plato's
own Concessions; for in his Theaetetus he lays down this as his opinion,
(...), It seems to me, that he who knows any thing has a sensate cognition of
what he knows; for, as it now appears, science is nothing else than sensation,
or a particular experimental feeling knowledge. So Timaeus, page 103. (...),
wisdom is a good sense of soul. So Plato in his Gorgias, (...), Experience
makes our life to pass away according to rules of art, but Inexperience
casually. Again he adds, That an experimental Philosopher only can judge
prudently of things; for, (...), persons unexperienced of the truth and other
matters, have no sound opinions of pleasure and sorrow. Now that none of these
blind Philosophers had this (...), good sensation, or experimental particular
knowledge of good and evil, pleasure or sorrow, is most evident; because they
had not (...), a good habitude of soul, which they themselves make essentially
requisite to this spiritual good sensation or experimental Philosophy. So
Aristotle, Eth. lib. 3. cap. 6. (...), A virtuose man judges truly of what is
good, but a wicked man casually: as it is in bodies, such as are wel-disposed
can judge truly of things that are wholesome, or conducing to health; but
those who are sick, otherwise; for to these bitter and sweet have the same
relish. This indeed was the very case of al these Pagan Philosophers, they had
(...), an il habitude of soul; and so were void of this (...), right sensation,
or experimental knowledge; they had not those (...), Heb. 5.14. which rendered al
their Morals and Metaphysics vain.

. 5. Whence it follows, That al Pagan Philosophy is but cloudy, obscure, and
confused, not evident, clear, and distinct: 4. Pagan Philosophy cloudy and
confused, not evident and distinct.
for it is a commun and true maxim, that in Vniversals and Generals there lies
much Ambiguitie, Obscurity, and Confusion; al clear, evident, distinct
judgment procedes from the consideration of particulars. And that the evident,
clear, distinct contemplation of things is essential to al genuine Philosophy
may be easily gathered from the Philosophers themselves, their own
acknowlegements. Plato, Epinom. page 976. makes mention of an admirable
faculty of discerning, which belongs to a Philosopher; (...), etc. Which many
call nature rather than wisdom; and it is conversant in this, that a man does
with facility and dexterity learn a thing, and having learned it, commit it
to a faithful and firm memory, and recals it with celeritie as occasion
serves. This some call (...), wisdom; others (...), nature; others (...),
Sagacitie of nature. This natural Sagacitie is thus described, Platon. definit.
(...), Sagacitie is a good disposition of soul, whereby he that has it is
enabled to discern what becomes every one; or more briefly in what follows,
(...), an acumen of judgment. This, says Plato Repub. 2. page 376. Dogs are
in some sense endowed with, which have a natural sagacitie to discern their
friend from their foe, only by the countenance. This Repub. 7 page 537. he
makes a character of his Logician, that he be (...), one that can accurately
look into and distinguish things. And in his Repub. 9. he makes a Philosopher
to be (...), a diacritic or very critic instrument; for look as the eye is
(...), an accurate critic of bodies, such should the Philosophers mind be of
good and evil. He tells us also in the same Repub. 9. whence this critic
judgment springs, (...), a critic judgment is made by Experience and
Prudence, and Reason or Discourse. And Seneca Epist. 71. tells us, That
Socrates, who reduced al Philosophy to Morals, affirmed, that this was the
highest wisdom; to distinguish betwixt good and evil. By all which it is
evident how little of true wisdom these Pagan Philosophers had: For how could
they distinguish aright betwixt Good and Evil without spiritual senses
exercised, as Heb. 5.15? This Intellectual Sagacitie is called (...),
dexterity; which according to the Platonic definition, is (...), an habit of
choosing what is best; which al will grant these Pagan Philosophers were void
of. And indeed Plato ingenuously confesses, That this faculty of
distinguishing or discerning what was best, was not commun, but peculiar to the
judgment of Jupiter. And Aristotle seems sensible of this, that there was much
difficulty in distinguishing betwixt truth and falsehood; because there was so
much falsehood like to truth. So Rhet. l. 1. c. 1. (...), for it belongs to the
same faculty to judge of truth, and that which is like unto truth. Which
faculty he and the rest of his Tribe were greatly void of; for how often does
a falsehood, if like to truth, pass with them for truth? so confused and
indistinct were they in all their Philosophemes. This is excellently set forth
by Aristotle, Ethic. l. 3. c. 6. (...), for a righteous man judges rightly of
althings, etc. Then he adds, that this righteous or virtuose man does
accurately difference things, (...), being as it were the canon, rule, and
measure of althings: i.e. (says Lambinus) not that truth dependes upon the
judgment of a virtuose man, but that his judgment is conformed to truth. But
then Aristotle concludes, (...), the most of men seem to be under deceit by
reason of pleasure, etc. This indeed was the case of al those poor
Philosophers; their foolish hearts were darkened and deceived by lust, which
rendered their Philosophy, specially in Morals and Supernaturals, extreme
confused and cloudy. It is Faith only, according to Heb. 11.1. that is (...),
an evidence of things not seen, i.e. Supernatural. Heb. 11.1. (...).
(...) is either (1) a natural evidence; as the light is the evidence of it
self and althings else. (2) A Philosophic evidence, as first principes are in
themselves most evident, and give evidence to al other lower principes; or as a
demonstrative argument is evident, and gives evidence to the conclusion. (3)
Legal evidence; which is either of Right or Fact. (4) Supernatural evidence;
such is Faith of things naturally and rationally invisible.

. 6. Another Adjunct, 5. Pagan Philosophy uncertain and Opiniative only.
which the Philosophers made essential to their Philosophy, is Stabilitie and
Certainty of Assent. For, says Plato, Repub. 5. such as content themselves
with fluid weak Opinions, are not (...), Philosophers, but (...), lovers of
Opinions. So again in his Phaedrus, page 262. (...), He that knows not the
truth, but hunts after Opinions, will exhibit only a ridiculose and inartificial
Art. But Repub. 6. page 506. more fully thus, (...), What then? do thou not
know that Opinions without science are base, the best of which are but blind?
or do they seem to thee to differ any thing from blind men, who, though going
on in a right way, have only some opinions about truth without understanding?
surely nothing. Whence he concludes, That it is not lawful to contemplate base
and blind Opinions, when things more certain are before us. And in his Meno he
gives us the privilege of a certain knowledge above opinion; (...), He that has
science or certain knowledge always reaches what he aims at; but he that has
only a right opinion sometimes attaines his end, sometimes not. Now that these
Pagan Philosophers had not this Scientific or certain knowledge of things,
(excepting some of their Mathematic Demonstrations) but only some weak fluid
dark opinions, is very evident. For according to their own principes, science
or certain knowledge is the result of (...), Demonstration, which supposes a
clear, steadfast knowledge of the Causes, and their causal connection with the
Effect; which the Pagan Philosophy was, in its chiefest parts, wholly
destitute of. For what jejune and slender notices had these purblind Sophists
touching God, the first Cause of althings, his great Productive Acts of
Creation and Providence? The certain knowledge hereof dependes wholly on Divine
Revelation, the proper object of Faith, according to Heb. 11.3, Through faith
we understand that the world was framed by the word of God. By which it is
evident, that there can be no certain unmovable assent or knowledge touching
the first origin of things, (which comprehends a great part of Pagan
Philosophy) but what procedes from Faith assenting unto Divine Revelation.
Whence the Spirits act in working this assent is called (...), 1 Cor. 2.4.
(...).
1 Cor. 2.4. Demonstration, i.e. The assent wrought by the Spirit of God is as
certain, as assent wrought by Mathematic ocular Demonstration. (...) is a
Mathematic notion, noting a most potent and essicacious conviction of the mind,
which leaves no place for douting; and so it is opposed to (...), which
signifies a dark Adumbration, or rude draught, like the first lines in a
demonstration; whereas (...) signifies a complete scientific certain assent.
The Pagan Philosophers had some kind of (...), or (...), dark adumbration, or
shadowy description of the first principes of nature, etc. which they received
by some broken Traditions from the Jews; but they had not this (...),
Demonstration, or certain assent touching the Worlds origin: this is peculiar
to Divine Faith, bottomed on Sacred Revelation, as Heb. 11.3. Yea, Divine Faith
has according to its Sacred character, Col. 2.2.
Col. 2.2. an objective (...), i.e. a full, stable, certain persuasion of the
veracitie or truth of its Object; the Metaphor being taken from a Ship carried
with full sails. Luke 1.1.
The like Luke 1.1. (...), of those things which are fully and certainly
assented unto by us. Every Believer has a direct, adhesive plerophorie, or
certain assent touching the certainty of the things contained in the Word of
God; albeit he has not a reflexe plerophorie, or cortain assurance of his own
propriety and interest therein. Thence Gal. 3.1, Gal. 3.1. (...).
Before whose eyes Christ has been evidently set forth: (...), painted forth,
or drawn to the life; they had as certain and steadfast a vision of Christ by
faith, as they had who stood by the Cross and saw him crucified. This (...) is
opposed to Plato's (...), dark adumbration, or opinionative knowledge. The
Divine Faith of Jews and Christians gives them a full, steadfast, certain,
spiritual vision of things invisible as to sense or reason, Heb. 11.27. (...).
But now the wisest of the Pagan Philosophers had only the (...), dark shadowy
notices of these Divine Revelations from Jewish Traditions. The Schole-men tell
us, that the certainty of Divine Faith, as bottomed on Divine Authority, is
more infallible than that of human Science bottomed on Demonstration. But this
the most quick-sighted of these Pagan Philosophers were void of, and therefore
could not attain to that certain knowledge of the principes of Philosophy which
they pretended unto. We have for this a great acknowlegement by Plutarch, one
of the wisest modern Philosophers, who in the life of Coriolanus speaks
thus: Many times we think we hear what we do not hear, and we imagine we see
what we see not; yet notwithstanding such as are piously bent, and zelosely
given to think on heavenly things, so as they can be no ways drawn from
believing that which is spoken of them, they have this reason to ground the
foundation of their belief on; that is, the Omnipotence of God, which is
wonderful, and has no manner of ressemblance or likeness of proportion unto
ours, but is altogether contrary, as touching our nature, our moving, our art,
and our force; and therefore if he do any thing impossible unto us, or does
bring forth and devise things above man's commun reach and understanding, we
must not therefore think it impossible at al. For if in other things he is
contrary to us, much more in his works and operations he far surpasses all the
rest. (...), Many of the Divine matters are (according to Heraclitus) by reason
of our unbelief hidden from our knowledge. Thus Plutarch ingenuously
acknowlegeth their ignorance of Divine affairs, as also the root of al, which
he makes to be unbelief. This incertaintie of Pagan Philosophy gives us a
farther Demonstration of its vanity.

. 7. Philosophers give this as a propriety of true Philosophy, 6. Pagan
Philosophy not truly discursive, but sophistic or paralogistic.
that it be (...), and (...), Dianoetic, Dialogistic, and Dialectic or
Discursive. i. e. originally springing from, and ultimately determining in some
necessary first Principes. Thence Philosophy is described in the Platonic
definitions, (...), a true and unerring Ratiocination in the Dianoetic
judgment. Thence Plato under the term of Dialectic or Logic seems to
comprehend the whole of his Philosophy. So in his Repub. 7. page 533. (...),
Dialectic method procedes this way only, namely that removing the Hypotheses it
may arrive to the first principe, and lay a firm foundation for assent --
using other arts as auxiliarie aides. Again in the same Repub. 7. he defines his
Logician thus: (...), Thou call a Dialectic one who considers the reason of
every Being; for he that accurately discerns things is a Dialectic. Yea
indeed he makes nothing true Logic or discourse but what determines in the
knowledge of God, the first Principe, who is (...), as the Platonists speak, the
sum and comprehension of al reason or discourse. By which it is apparent, that
al Pagan Philosophy was not truly Logistic or discursive, but rather
paralogistic and sophistic. For indeed most of their Disputes were but (...),
contentiose Ratiocinations, vain both in their Principes and Conclusions. This
Paul takes notice of in Romans 1.21. Romans 1.21.
Vain in their imaginations. (...), In their disputes, or Dialogistic
Ratiocinations: for their ancient way of disputing was by Dialogues, or
Interrogations and Answers, agreeable to the Judaic Argumentation, as we have
shown, Court Gent. P. 2. B. 3. C. 8.. 2. Al their Disputes both Mental and
Verbal were vain. So 1 Cor. 1.20. Where is the disputer of this world? i.e. Al
their Philosophic Disputations could not bring them to the knowledge of God the
first Principe. 1 Timothy 6.4, 5.
So 1 Timothy 6.4. Doting about questions; (...). Which, as he adds, were but
(...), strifes about words no way conducing to edification. Or, as he adds v.
5. (...), very busy, but perverse discourses about trifles. So that indeed al
their Philosophic (...), disputes, were but (...), perverse or false reasonings
no way conducing to clear up truth or any first principes, as has been observed
Chap. 1.. 6.

. 8. Another Attribute, Pagan Philosophy not truly Noetic, or Intelligent.
or if you will, formal part of Pagan Philosophy is, that it be (...), Noetic
or Intelligent; i.e. comprehensive of the first and highest Principes. This
part of Philosophy they usually style (...), Intelligence; which they make to
be a comprehension of the first Principes of Science; and so distinguish it
from Dianoetic Philosophy, which is the assent to Conclusions by discourse
from first principes; as also from (...), Sapience, which they take to be the
knowledge of the most excellent Being, God, etc. But Plato seems to make (...),
Intelligence, and (...) Wisdom, to be the same, and so at present we shall
consider them. This Intelligence or Sapience Plato makes to be the supreme and
most perfect of al Sciences. So Repub. 6. page 511. (...), Intelligence in the
highest place; which afterward he calls (...), the most perfect of al; and
(...), the end of al Disciplines: unto which al other Arts ought to be
subservient. So in his Phileb. page 58. he terms it, (...), the principal
Science; because it prescribes mea2ure, weight, and rules to al other
Sciences. And the original ground why this Intelligence or Sapience is so
excellent a Science Plato lays down, Repub. 7. page 513. Where he makes (...)
Intelligence to be the highest of Sciences; because it is employed in the
contemplation of (...), the first Being, or (...), the first Beauty, and
(...), namely from firm and eternal principles, (...), proceeding by discourse
to that which is singular; having cast off the ministry (...), of Idols: it
quits not this contemplation until (...), it comprehendes by its Intelligence
that which is good it self. This he explains more fully in his Theaetetus, page
140. where he says, this Intelligence is (...), the return of the soul from
its night-day to the true light of Being; i. e. of God. Whence he adds, page
176. (...), The knowledge of this first Being is true sapience and virtue, but
the ignorance of him the worst rudeness and evil. So Alcibiad. 2. page 146. he
says, (...), that the knowledge of other sciences, without the knowledge of that
which is best, is little advantageous. This gives us a farther demonstration of
the vanity of al Pagan Philosophy; which notwithstanding al its pretensions,
was altogether void of this Divine Intelligence or Sapience. Thus much indeed
Plato acknowlegeth in his Phileb. saying, that the knowledge of the one infinite
Being was, (...), a gift of God to men: which in his Theages, he says, God
gives to none but such as are his friends. And Plato, Repub. 6. p. 483. gives
us a large Analogy, or proportion, 'twixt the light of the Sun and this
knowledge of God; showing, that as the eye cannot contemplate the Sun but by its
own light, so neither can the mind contemplate (...), or (...), Being it self;
i.e. God, unless there be (...), some Idea or beam of this chiefest Good;
which, says he, is the cause of al truth in every intelligent faculty,
without which there can be no science. Now that the wisest of these Pagan
Philosophers were altogether void of this infused Divine Intelligence or light,
I suppose no Christian will deny.

. 9. Another formal Attribute or part they give Philosophy is, that it be
(...), Prudential. Of this (...), Prudence, 8. Pagan Philosophy defective as
to Prudence, viz. 1. Part of Prudence self-reflexion.
they make several parts. (1) Self-reflexion, or the knowledge of our selves,
specially our Souls. So Plato, in his Alcibiad. 1. page 133. (...), If the soul
wilknow it self, must it not reflect upon it self? -- And to know himself, we
confess is wisdom. And he adds, that such as know not themselves know not
either their goods or their ils, or any thing else that belongs unto them, etc.
(...), Therefore this part thereof seems to be most like to the Divinity; and
if any reflect thereon, and behold all that is Divine, and God, and Sapience, he
shall thus mostly know himself. By which he instructs us, that by knowing the
Divine part of the soul we come to understand what is Divine, both God, and
Wisdom, and our selves. So de legib. 1. page 650. he says, It is the most
profitable of al Sciences to know, 2. (...), or Providence.
(...), the dispositions and habits of the souls. (2) A part of this Prudence
they call (...) Providence; which the Platonists thus define, (...), Providence
is a Preparation for something future. Whence say they it is the part of
prudent persons (...) to foresee difficulties. And because they estimed nothing
more difficult than to die well, thence Pythagoras, Plato, and Tullie define
Philosophy, 3: (...)
the Contemplation of Death. (3) The chiefest part of the Philosophers Prudence
consisted in the framing of happiness. So in the Platonic definitions: (...),
Prudence is a science effective of happiness. So Stobaeus, Sermon. 1. (...),
Prudence is the science of Happiness as to life. So Aristotle. 4. (...), or
(...).
(4) As to present affairs, they make this Prudence to consist in the right
disposing and ordering of althings with subservience to our last end. So
Pittachus makes Prudence to lie in (...), the right management of what is
before us. And Socrates makes a young man's Wisdom to be (...), the doing
nothing rashly. This Plato calls (...), good consultation. So Rep. 4. page 428.
(...). And Aristotle makes Prudence to be (...), a consultation what is to be
done, 5. Practical knowledge.
and what not. (5) More particularly the Philosophers made Prudence to be
(...), a knowledge of good and of evil. i.e. [1] Rightly to distinguish betwixt
good and evil. [2] To imitate what is best: (...), Lay up what is best, and
those things do thou imitate, Stob. Sermon. 3. [3] (...), To use things conducing
to this life well, as Plato Charm. [4] To preserve the rectitude of the will, and
regular order in the affections, etc. By all which Descriptions of Prudence it
is apparent these blind Philosophers were altogether void of it. For (1) How
seldom or never did they reflect on their actions, souls, and state? (2) How
little foresight of, but much less preparation for a future state, had they?
(3) How little influential on future happiness was al their Prudence? (4) How
little practic or directive as to present affairs was their Prudence? (5) Much
less could they attain to any true virtue by all their Prudence. Indeed al
their human Wisdom or Prudence was but carnal policy, according to the
Platonic definition, (...), Craft is an affection, whereby he that has it is
enabled to design his private interest; which is the greatest solie, according
to Eccles. 10.3. His wisdom fails him; (...) his heart, or his Prudence.

. 10. The last Propriety ascribed to Pagan Philosophy is (...), a plastic,
efformative, or transforming virtue: 9. Pagan Philosophy defective as to that
transforming power they pretended to
So Plato, Repub. 6. (...), The Philosopher conversing with what is Divine and
excellent, becomes also, so far as its possible for a man, Divine and
excellent: by imitating these Divine things we become like to them. Again,
Gorgias, p. 460. he tells us, (...), He that studies any thing is wrought by his
science into the likeness of that which he studies, -- and he that studies
righteousness becomes righteous. But he speaks more fully, Repub. 6. p. 501.
where showing how Philosophers by their institutes do form men according to
the Divine Exemplar: This Divine Product in men (says he) Homer calls (...),
Deiforme, or little God in man. The like Rep. 9. p. 592. (...), But there is
placed in Heaven a most exact exemplar for any that will to contemplate, and by
contemplating conform himself unto it. Again, Theaetet. p. 176. he tells us,
That the Soul's (...), etc. assimilation unto God, so far as it is possible in
righteousness and holiness, is the product of Wisdom, or Philosophy. But
this Divine Metamorphose, or Transformation is peculiar to Divine and saving
Faith, according to 2 Cor. 3.18. (...), we are transformed; 2 Cor. 3.18.
i.e. by beholding the gloriose Ideas of Divine Wisdom and Grace, reflected
from the face of Christ on the glass of the Gospel, we are by the efficaciose
concurrence of the Spirit changed into the same gloriose image of Christ. This
Pagan Philosophy could never reach: al its transformative virtue was to change
men's minds and conversations into the image of Satan. Such was its Vanity and
Insufficience to reach those ends, which those blind Philosophers proposed to
themselves. But this may suffice to show the Vanity of Pagan Philosophy from
its Formal nature, Attributes or Adjuncts.

Origin and the Origenists, with other Greek Fathers, who did too much symbolise
with Pagan Philosophers herein. A Summarie of Pelagianisme and Augustin's zele

. 1. WE have discoursed of the Vanity of Pagan Philosophy from its Causes,
Essential Parts, and Attributes; we now proceed to demonstrate the same from
its Effects; wherein there appears much more Vanity than in the former. The
many vain Effects of Pagan Philosophy may be reduced to these commun Heads.
(1) They are more general, such as regard both Pagans and the People of God.
(2) They are more particular and peculiar, [1] To the Jewish Church: [2] To the
Christian Churches, both primitive or purer, and later under Antichristian
Apostasy. Pagan Philosophy vain as to its Effects. (1.) It came short of its
End.
We are to begin with the corrupt Effects of vain Philosophy in general, as
relating both to Pagans and the Professing People of God. And amongst these we
may reckon, (1) as one great piece of its Vanity, that it reached not that end
which it proposed: For a thing is said to be vain, when it attains not its
proposed End. Now the End which these vain Philosophers proposed was by their
Philosophy to reduce the Soul to that natural state of knowing and enjoying
God, which it was possessed of in Innocence. So Philosophy is defined by
Plato, (...), The reduction of the soul from its night-day to the true sight of
Being, i.e. God. Again, he calls Philosophy the contemplation, love, and
imitation of God. But now how far al Pagan Philosophy came short of this End,
is evident by what has been laid down in the foregoing Discourses. Yea take
Philosophy in its zenith or meridian glory, and it was but a mere (...),
Theorie, (...), likeness, or (...), as Romans 2.20, form of knowledge. It gave
not the least (...), Metamorphose to the Soul, as Faith is said to do, 2 Cor.
3.8. (...). Solomon gives an excellent character of all the Pagan Philosophers,
Prove. 7.7. (...)
Prove. 7.7, And beheld amongst the simple ones -- a young man void of
understanding. (...) of an heart: i.e. Practic understanding. Eccl. 10.2, 3.
(...)
So Eccles. 10.2, 3, we have an excellent antithese betwixt a true Philosopher
and the vain: we find the true Philosopher characterised thus, v. 2, A wise
man's heart is at his right; i.e. his Philosophy or Wisdom is practic and
directive, he can make use of it on al occasions. But a fools heart is at his
left; i.e. his Philosophy is no way practic or operative. So it follows, v. 3,
Yea also when he that is a fool walks by the way, his wisdom [(...) his
heart] fails him. i.e. Al his Philosophic Contemplations, when they come to
matters of Practice or Direction, fail him. Whence it follows: [and he says to
every one that he is a fool,] i.e. his actions bespeak him to be a mere fool,
void of an heart or practic judgment, notwithstanding al his pretensions to
Philosophic Wisdom. Such wise fools were Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, the
Stoics, etc. who, notwithstanding al their Philosophic Speculations, were void
of an heart or true pactic directive Wisdom.

. 2. Pagan Philosophy has not only come short of its End which was proposed,
but also proved a great snare, delusion, Pagan Philosophy souldeceit and
delusion.
and cloak for all manner of wickedness, which is an effect worse than the
former. This our Apostle Paul seems to give some hints of, 1 Cor. 3.1. He calls
them Babes. 1 Cor. 3.1.
They had much carnal wisdom, being seated in the eye of Greece, yet he looks
upon them as Babes as to Divine Wisdom. Ver. 10.
Ver. 10, etc. he gives cautions against building Hay and stubble, i.e. Human
Philosophic Inventions on the Gospels foundation. Then v. 18, Ver. 18.
he gives a particular caution against this self-deceiving, vain Philosophy,
Let no man deceive himself; if any man among you seems to be wise in this
world, etc. (...), Let no man deceive himself; i.e. with vain Philosophy, etc.
So Grotius on this Text: Al Philosophy (says he) repugnant to the Gospel is
deceit, 2 These. 2.3. Thence it follows v. 19, Ver. 19.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. (...), their
Metaphysic Sapience, or Philosophy. He notes the most sublime Contemplations
and Philosophemes among the Philosophers. Thence he adds, He takes the wise in
their own craftiness. (...), from (...), signifies al manner of Calliditie, or
Dexterity to cheat and deceive; an art of cheating; wherein many Corinthian
Sophistes or Gnostics were much versed. So again v. 20, Ver. 20.
The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. (...), the
Philosophic Reasonings or Disputes of the Sophists; they are both Philosophic
terms. These Philosphic reasonings are said to be vain, in that they deceived
those who trusted to them. (...) primarily notes, to confer among themselves by
Questions and Responsions or Answers; which was the ancient mode of disputing
both among the Jews and Grecians. Thus Mat. 21.25. Luke 12.17. Mark 2.6, 8.
Hence (...) signifies a Disceptation or Ratiocination either Mental or Oral.
Sometimes it signifies the same with (...), inane concertation or dispute of
words about things of no moment. Phil. 2.14.
So Phil. 2.14. (...) here, says Grotius, seems to be those bitter contentions
about things no way conducing to piety: whereof there were many among the
Philosophers, specially the Aristoteleans, who abounded in Macedonia where
Philippi stood. Our Apostle seems also to strike at this soul-deceit of vain
Philosophy in his Epistle to the Ephesians, amongst whom there lived many
Pythagorising Jews and Gnostics. Ephesians. 4.14.
So Ephesians. 4.14, That we be no more henceforth children tossed to and fro.
(...), i.e. fluctuating up and down like the waves of the Sea, and carried
about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men. (...).
(...). Amongst the Grecians (...) signified a Dice, and because the cast of a
Dice was most casual and uncertain as to its event, as also that whereby crafty
Gamesters circumvented the more simple; thence the word was by them translted
from its primitive notion to signify, (1) any casual and uncertain event; and
this signification here, though metaphoric and borrowed, is very emphatic, and
lively, setting forth the skipping levitie and inconstance of men's minds, more
uncertain than the cast of the Dice. Thus Beza understands the word here. But
yet (2) we must take in also the second notion of (...), as it notes crafty
circumvention of the more simple. There were at Ephesus many Pythagorising
Gnostics, who, by their sublime speculations and subtle fraudulent
distinctions, circumvented the more simple professors as well as themselves.
Thence our Apostle procedes to give a further account of the root of al: (...),
by cunning craftiness. It is the same with that before mentioned, 1 Cor. 3.19,
whereby he seems to paint forth the Philosophic sophisterie of those
Pythagorising Jews and Gnostics, who lay in wait to beguile and ensnare poor
silly professors. So it follows, (...), whereby they lie in wait to deceive.
i.e. By their cunning crafty Philosophisings. (...), method, is a compendiose
and artificial way of handling simple Themes, Propositions, or Sciences. Thence
(...) notes a certain Art of cheating or deceiving, comprehended under certain
general rules. Thus Chrysostom, (...), to lie in wait to deceive, is
artificiosely to circumvent some one, and by a compendiary way to reduce him
under his power. Again, (...), Lying in wait to deceive, i.e. Preparing a
persuasive discourse, and using artifices to cover the cheat. Which course
these Pythagorising Gnostics took. Our Apostle inculcates this exhortatorie
caution, Ephesians. 5.6, Let no man deceive you with vain words. Ephesians. 5.6. (...).
(...). He marks out, says Grotius, the Philosophers who asserted there was no
evil in Incestes, Community of Wives, overreaching of one the other in
buyings and sellings, etc. whose vain (...), i.e. reasonings or Philosophisings
the Pythagorising Gnostics made use of, to color over their gross
wickednesses, and so to deceive the more simple Christians. (...) may signify
Philosophic Arguments or reasonings as well as words. This our Apostle does yet
more professedly discourse of, and against, in his Epistle to the Colossians,
who were very sorely infested, at least assaulted, by the Pythagorising
Gnostics. So Col. 2.4, Col. 2.4. (...)
And this I say lest any one should beguile you. (...), i.e. Deceive you by
Sophistic disputes of vain Philosophy. (...) signifies to impose a sophistic
and fallacious argument, which yet has the color and show of a good argument,
thereby to circumvent the credulous and simple; which is the main work of a
Sophister. It answers to (...) and (...), which the Seventy interpret by (...)
and (...), to cheat and deceive. Hence Hesychius explicates (...), a
Paralogisme, by (...), deceit; and (...), a Paralogist, by (...), a Deceiver or
Cheater. So that (...) signifies properly by false ratiocination to deceive, by
sophistic reason, or captiose syllogism to impose on others, or on our selves;
and so it is opposed to (...), and (...), to dispute regularly. Jam. 1.22.
Hence Jam. 1.22. Such as content themselves with mere Philosophic reason, or
notional knowledge, are brought in as (...), imposing a Paralogisme, or
fallacious argument on themselves. Indeed for men to acquiesce in mere
Philosophic or speculative Wisdom, is the worst of Paralogismes, and
Sophisterie; for it is self-deceit, it is soul deceit: Therefore the Apostle
gives the more severe caution against it. Then it follows, Col. 2.4. (...),
with entising words. Col. 2.4. (...).
Here we have the matter of their Paralogistic fallacious Philosophisings; which
was fair plausible pretextes of Reason, probable or persuasive Discourses,
Artificially and Philosophically composed, thereby the more effectually to
deceive: so the word (...) importes. This our Apostle does more fully explain,
v. 8, Ver. 8. (...).
Beware lest any spoil you. (...). This term is military, signifying the
carrying away a prey. (...) notes a prey or spoil taken in war, and (...) to
carry away. (...) signifies properly, in an hostile manner, and by an armed
power to plunder and carry away: whence (...) is by Hesychius interpreted
(...), plundering, or stripping naked: and (...): as (...). As if the Apostle
had said: Let no man plunder and strip you naked of your Christian Dogmes,
which are your highest ornaments, by vain Pythagorean or other Philosophy.
Thence follows the great engine by which this was accomplished: By Philosophy
and vain deceit, here is (...), one and the same thing under a double
expression; as if he had said, (...), by the vain deceit of Philosophy. So
Grotius. The like he adds v. 18. (...), Ver. 18. (...).
Let no one deceive you of your brabium, or reward. (...) signifies to moderate
as a Judge in the Grecian Games, and so it is the same with (...), jus dicere,
to judge and pass sentence; whence the Judges were called (...), and the
Reward (...). Hence (...), signifies (1) and properly to give sentence against
any one as unworthy of the (...), or Reward. So Phavorinus, (...). So Beza here
understands it, Let no man act the part of a Judge against you. But (2) Jerome
tells us, that (...) in the Cilician tongue, wherein Paul was instituted being
of Tarsis, signifies to spoil or rob one of his reward. Thus here it signifies
in a borrowed notion, to beguile of the reward. And the medium by which they
did it, was Pythagorean Philosophy. (...), pede inferens. These Gnostics
having sucked in the Pythagorean infusions about Angels and Demon-worship, they
thence coined many curiose mystic speculations about these Philosophic
Mysteries, which had v. 23. (...), a pretext or show of wisdom, which deceived
the simpler sort of professors; but all this vain Philosophy was but (...), a
foolish deceitful wisd me, as hereafter. This gives us a sufficient general
account of those monstrose Soul-deceits which ensued upon the spreading of
Pagan Philosophy, and its infusions in the Churches of God. But to descend to
Particulars.

. 3. Another cursed Effect of vain Pagan Philosophy was Idolatric. 3. Effect
of Pagan Philosophy was Idolatry.
It Is granted that the Philosophers, the wisest of them, Thales, Pythagoras,
Socrates, Plato, renounced the Mythologic Theology of the Poets, as also
Politic in use amongst the Statesmen, Priests, and people, assuming a new
Divinity or Religion of their own inventing, called (...), Natural Theology:
which though it were less fabulose, Observatum est ibi maxim viguisse
superstitionem, (...), ubi maxim florebant philosophi. Quod vel Athenicasium
exemplo pater, de quo Act. 17.16. Hine factum est, ut ex ipsis Philosophis
Dcorum Saccr otes legerenlur. Hornius Hist. Philos. l. 3. The origin of Demons
from Pagan Philosophy.
and more suited to corrupt reason than either the Poetic or Politic Theology,
yet was it no way less subject to Superstition and Idolatry: For though in
this their Natural Theology they owned one eternal supreme God, yet they
withal asserted an insinitie of Demons, or petty Gods, which they made to be
Mediators betwixt this one supreme God and Men. Thence Plato styles them (...),
made and visible Gods: also (...), Idols and Images of the great God. Again he
says, they were (...), made by, but under the great God. It Is true he calls
them also (...), immortal; but then he tells us, they had only (...), a framed
Immortality, at the pleasure of the great God. In brief, they were but certain
Heroes or noble Personages deified after their Death, whom they supposed to
have their chief residence in the Stars; whence they were called (...),
deastri. So Tullie says of Julius Caesar, that he was turned into a Star, etc.
As they presumed the chief God to have his main residence in the Sun, whom the
Phenicians called Moloch, from (...), and the Grecians, Saturn, Apollo,
Jupiter, as their fantasies inclined them; hence Julian's Oration to the Sun,
which he makes the supreme God: So these Demons they placed in Dignity, (...),
Co-rulers with the great God, as Plato, Polit. page 251. The Romans called them
semi-Gods, and Medioxumi, or midling Gods, from their office; because they were
to be as Mediators betwixt Men and the supreme God. Such were Romulus,
Hercules, Aesculapius, Tyndarides, as Lud. Vives in August. Civ. l. 2. c. 16.
Plutarch, in his Discourse of the cessation of Oracles, does greatly extol such
as invented these Demons or midling sort of Gods, and made them Mediators
betwixt the supreme God and Men; which some attribute to Orpheus, or some other
Phrygian, others to the Egyptians. The office they give them is to be as
Mediators betwixt the supreme God and Men: Homer (adds he) promiscuously uses
the names of Gods and Demons. Hesiod was the first who distinguished the four
orders of Rational Nature into Gods, Demons, Heroes, and men: out of these
later Demons and Heroes were made. But none gives us a more clear and full
account of the origin, Nature, Office, and Worship of these Demons than Plato,
whom we have elsewhere quoted to this purpose; to which we may add, what he
mentions of them in his Cratylus, page 397. (...), etc. Know thou therefore
whom Hesiod makes these Demons to be? that he says they were men who lived in
the first golden age. Then he adds, (...), because they were wise and knowing
men, he called them Demons. Whence he concludes, (...), Every good man dying
gains a great fate and honor, and is made a Demon, according to the name of
wisdom. Here Plato gives us a true account of the origin of these Demons; who
were indeed at first men famous for Wisdom and Heroic Achievements; of whom
some think Joseph (whom the Egyptians worshipped as God under their Idol Apis,
etc.) to be the first; others make Belus King of Tire a Phenician (distinct
from the Assyrian Belus) to be one of the first of these Demons; who were
thence called by the Phenicians (...) Baalim. So Virgil tells us, That Belus or
Baal was a deified Phenician King. These Baalim (who were nothing else but the
Souls of deceased Worthies deified) were brought into Israel by Jezebel, the
daughter of Eth baal King of Tire, which laid the foundation of the Jewish
Idolatry, as hereafter. And that these Demons were not only Mediators, but
also Objects of Worship, even amongst the Philosphers themselves, is evident,
by what we find in Plato, Repub. 5.468, 469. In these things, says he, we
follow the authority of Homer. For we in our Sacrifices and such like
Assemblies, honor good and valiant men so far as their merits require it, with
Hymns and Honorable seats, and flesh sacrifices, and full cups, or
drink offerings. -- For he that after many noble achievements dies in War,
shall we not say that he belongs to the Golden age? -- Let us consult therefore
Gods Oracle, in what rank those blessed and divine men are to be placed, and
with what Ensigns they are to be honored; and we shall perform to them such
honors as he shall prescribe, (...), and for the future we shall serve them as
Demons, and worship their Sepulchers, or Shrines. Thus Plato, wherein we have
the origin and sundry modes of this Demon-Worship. 1. Demons worshipped by
Images.
(1) As for the manner how these Demon-Gods were worshipped, and as it were
brought to the lure of men, when they had occasion to make use of them, it was
transacted by Images, Statues, Pillars, etc. which they called (...). These the
Philosophers themselves made use of and worshipped; not that they looked upon
them as their Gods, but only as visible bodies, unto which they supposed their
Gods or Demons vouchsafed their presence and influence, answerable to Jeroboams
Calves, which he erected at Dan and Bethel, supposing that God would have
yielded his presence to them. We have this mystery laid open to us by Plotinus
and Hermes Trismegistus, who tell us, That Images were made as bodies to be
informed by Ghosts as with Souls: for an Image was as a trap to catch Demons,
and a device to tie them to a place, and keep them from departing away. Of
which see August. Civit. lib. 8. c. 23. (2) Another way whereby they worshipped
these their Demons, 2. By Sepulchers, Shrines, and Temples.
was by Religiose Sepulchers and Shrines: for there they hoped to find their
Ghost-Gods in a peculiar manner. And indeed it was not unusual for the Devil,
their great Demon, to frequent Sepulchers and Tombs; as we find him in our
Savior's time amongst the Tombs. And these Gentiles supposing some peculiar
presences and influences of their Demons at their Sepulchers, hence therefore
it was their custom to build Shrines and Temples at such places, where the
bodies or ashes of their Ghost-Demons lay entombed; whence the Primitive
Christians and Fathers upbraid the Gentiles, that their Temples were but the
Sepulchers of dead men; which custom notwithstanding the Christians
themselves, when Antichrist began to get head, took up, building their Churches
by the Graves of some Saint. (3) Moreover in the worship of their Demons they
used cuttings, 3. By Cuttings. 1 King. 18.28. Deuteronomy. 14.1.
and lancings of their flesh, as 1 King. 18.28. For their Demons being the
Deified Ghosts of men deceased, they made use of these Funeral rites in the
worship of them, in token that they were men deceased. Levit. 19.28.
Thence Deuteronomy. 14.1. and Lev. 19.28. God forbids his People this Funeral rite of
cutting and lancing; because abused to Demon-Idolatrie: yet did some
transgress, as Jer. 41.5. (4) Again, Jer. 41.5. 4. By Columns, Festivals,
Abstinences, sacred Vestments, etc.
in the Demon-worship they had many other rites; as worshipping of Columns,
Templing of Relics, Funeral-Orations, Festivals, Abstinences, sacred
Vestments, etc. which were al assumed by Antichrist, according to 1 Timothy 4.1.
as hereafter, C. 2. S. 3.. 1, etc. We have the whole of this Demonworship set
forth by Sacrifices to the dead, Psalm. 106.28, compared with Numb. 25.2, 3. and
Deuteronomy. 32.17. as Mede Diatr. 3. In short, it is evident both from the Pythagorean
Schools, as also from what is mentioned of the Athenian Philosophers, Act.
17.16. that the (...), Demon worship and Superstition flourished most there
where Philosphie flourished most, and that the former was but a Satanic effect
of the later. Thus pregnant was Pagan Philosophy for the conception and
improvement of Demon-worship; which was in some regard the worst of al Gentile
Idolatry, in that creeping into the Churches of God, it caused the greatest
Apostasy that ever was, (1) in the Jewish Church, which under Ahab and his
successors fell to this Demon, or Baal-worship brought in by Jezebel. (2) In the
Christian Churches under Antichrist, who brought in all these Demon-doctrines
and worship, applying the same to his Saints, according to 1 Timothy 4.1. as
hereafter, 1 Timothy 4.1.
C. 2. c. 3.

And as Pagan Philosophy had this Demon-Idolatrie contained formally in the
very bowels of its (...), Natural Theology; so had it also a great causal
Influence upon al other both Poetic and Politic Idolatry. What Influence al
Idolatry received from Philosophy.
For, as we before observed, al Idolatry had its origin from superstitiose
Admiration grounded on Philosophic Contemplations of those eminent qualities,
hidden virtues and influences, or excellent Beauties and Glories that shone in
the Creatures. So the Astronomers, by frequent contemplations of those
Celestial Bodies, their excellent structure, Beauty, and Glory, their regular
Motions, powerful Influences and Governments, were ravished into great
Admiration of them, and thence were enticed to Idolatric Adoration, etc. So the
Physiologist, or Natural Philosopher, observing many hidden qualities and
mystic Impresses or characters of Divine Wisdom, Power, and Goodness in
several parts of Nature, was so far ravished herewith, as that he adored the
Creature instead of its Creator; which was frequent amongst the Egyptians, who,
as Plutarch observes, adored every Creature wherein they perceived any Divine
quality to sparkle. Thus likewise the Politicians idolized human Wisdom and
Valor wherever they found it in any eminent degree: as the Stoics adored
Moral Virtue, and command of Passions, as their God, etc. Yea that this
Philosophic contemplation gave the first origin to Superstition and Idolatry,
is that which Plato long since observed, and makes mention of in his Cratylus:
where he says, That (...), [the Gods] had their origination (...), from
contemplation; because men being ravished with the contemplation of that
heavenly Machine, decked and adorned with so many gloriose Bodies, whose
admirable Power, Efficace, and Influence, they had daily experience of, hence
they called the Stars (...), Gods; giving them the names of Saturn, Jupiter,
etc. This origination, which Plato gives to these Pagan Gods and their worship,
seems most true: For certain it is, that their first Idol-Gods were the
Celestial Bodies, called by them (...) (from (...) or (...) the names of God)
the Heaven, the Sun, etc. which the Scripture terms the Host of Heaven. And it
is also generally confessed, that this Star-worship began amongst the
Chaldeans, who were great Astronomers, called Zabii; whence this piece of
Idolatry was called Zabaisme, as before, P. 2. Book 1. Chapter 4. And that
Idolatry was indeed the product of Pagan Philosophy seems more than probable
by what is mentioned, Romans 1.20, 21.
Romans 1.20, etc. For the invisible things, etc. They contemplated the invisible
Glories and Beauties of the Deity in his visible works. But v. 21. (...),
they became vain in their Philosophisings or reasonings. And he gives you the
mode or manner of their vain reasonings, v. 23, Ver. 23.
And changed the Glory of God into an image, etc. i.e. they contemplated those
eminent Divine qualities shining in the Creatures so long, til they fell to the
adoring and Idolising of them, (...), And changed. They changed the Glory of
the incorruptible God in the coined image of a corruptible man, etc. i.e. For
the gloriose incorruptible God they worshipped the Idols of corruptible men,
etc. Schmidius distinguishes here between (...), to change somewhat into
somewhat, whereby the subject, into which somewhat is transmuted, is noted; as
ver. 26. and (...), to change somewhat in somewhat, which notes the mode and
medium of the change. So here, they changed the Glory of the incorruptible
God, in the framed image of corruptible man, etc. i.e. whiles they worshipped
the image of a corruptible man, or best, for the true and gloriose God. Not
that the wiser of them made these Creatures the ultimate object of their
worship; no, that was too gross for such pretenders to Wisdom: but they
represented, according to their fantasies, the glorise God under the figures
and shapes of these vile creatures; to which they attributed the service and
honor due to the great God. So Plutarch says of the Egyptians, That they
worshipped not those several Creatures they met with simply as Gods, but those
Divine qualities they observed in those Creatures: as the Jews thought they
worshipped Jehovah under their Golden Calf. Thus much for the influence Pagan
Philosophy has on Idolatry. We might add to this Divination, which is but a
piece of Idolatry, and was the effect of Pagan Philosophy, as before, Chap.
3.. 7, 8, 9.

. 4. Another monstrose Effect of vain Pagan Philosophy is Atheism, Atheism
the effect of Pagan Philosophy. 1. (...) a preparative to Atheism.
which may justly challenge the Philosophers for its Parents; and that upon
sundry accounts and regards. 1. Pagan Philosophy had a mighty influence on
Atheism, in that it was a door and inlet to Superstition and Idolatry. For
there is (as has been observed) a very great cognation or affinity betwixt
superstitiose Idolatry and Atheism. Idolatry at first opened the door unto,
and since has very much advanced Atheism: (...), The Atheist believes there
are no Gods, and the superstitiose person wishes there were none. We have in
what foregoes shown, that the Philosophers Natural Theology and Religion was
but a (...), a superstitiose Demon-fear or worship. This was the Religion of
the Athenian Philosophers, Act. 17.18, 27.
Act. 17.18. (...). So v. 27. i.e. as being possessed with a dreadful
apprehension of your Demon-Gods, and so wholly addicted to a superstitiose fear
and worship of them. Al their (...), Demon-fear and Religion, arose from
slavish false apprehensions of an angry sin-revenging Deity, whom though they
flatered with their lips, yet they hated in their hearts, and therefore really
wished he were not. Thus did their (...) prepare the way to Atheism: yea not
only so, but it opened an effectual door thereto by bringing in a (...),
Polytheisme or Multiplicitie of Gods. For he that has power to believe a
plurality of Gods, is the next door unto Atheism, or a belief that there is
no God: To multiply the Deity is to destroy it, as Gaches l' Atheism
consondu, page 5. This indeed proved too true by the event: for the first
appearance that we find of Atheism, was when this (...), superstitiose
Demon-fear or Religion, invented by the Philosophers most flourished in Greece;
namely when those Skeptic wits, Democritus, Epicurus, etc. could not find any
rational (...), or Apparences of reason, for those multitudes of Demon-Gods
which were brought into Greece, they set their wits on work to salve the
Phenomenon of nature without the supposition of these or any other Deities.
Thus did Philosophic Polytheisme, or (...), make way to Atheism.

2. Pagan Philosophy had also a formal Efficience on Atheism, 2. Pagan
Philosophic had a formal influence on Atheism.
in that it made the Creature an Independent, self-sufficient, prime Agent and
Mover in natural Productions and Motions; and so left no room for, or
necessity of a Deity. This indeed is an epidemic contagion, which has more or
less infected every part of Pagan Philosophy, and laid open a broad gate to
Atheism. It Is confessed, true sane Philosophy, such as Adam had in Innocence,
gives a full demonstration of the Deity from his visible works, Romans 1.19, 20.
Ay but Pagan vain Philosophy in all its contemplations on the Creature, was apt
to leave out the Creator and acquiesce in the sensible objects it contemplated,
as in the first moving influential cause. Whence that great observation of Sir
Francis Bacon, That a little Philosophy makes men Atheists, though a great
deal would cure them of Atheism. And this indeed Plato takes notice of, as the
great crime of many Philosophers in his age, whom he calls (...), mere
sophisters; who, by reason of their Impiety, abused their Astronomic and other
Philosophic Sciences unto Atheism. So Plato, Leg. 12. page 967. disputes
against such impious Philosophers, who, from their Astronomic Philosophisings,
conceiving that things depended not on the Providence of God, but on the
necessary concatenation and connection of second causes, (...), became Atheists.
Whereas, says he, (...), It is the Divine Mind that disposes every thing: for
he that considers these things not impiously nor foolishly, will never become
an Atheist. But his and al other Pagan Philosophy was utterly void of such a
serious solid consideration of the visible works of God. Al their vain
Philosophisings were so much taken up in the admiration of those few rays of
Divine Wisdom, Beauty, and Order, which they observed in the Creatures, as
that they at first neglected, and then rejected the Creator of al, as one that
was invisible and unknown to their carnal Minds. This was long since observed
by Augustine, de Civit. l. 5. cap. 2. What the Physician believed to belong to
the like temper of health, this the Philosopher and Astrologer ascribe to that
Influence and constitution of the Stars, which was at the conception and birth
of every one. But we shall a little run thorough the chief parts of Pagan
Philosophy, and show how much each contributes to Atheism.

1. Pagan Physiologie, 1. What Influence Physiologie has upon Atheism.
or Natural Philosophy strictly so termed, has not a little contributed to
Atheism, in that those proud Physiologists, not understanding the true origin
of the Universe, nor that Divine Providence which governes and moderates al
Natural productions, and motions, assigned causes of things suitable to their
own humors and inclinations; excluding the great God from having any thing to
do in the World. Thus Democritus and Epicurus reduced the first origin of the
Universe to a fortuitous concurrence and casual combination of Atoms,
excluding Divine Providence from having any thing to do herein; which cursed
piece of Philosophy has taken too much root amongst some new Philosophers.
Aristotle, who endeavored to reduce al Effects to Matter and Form, asserted a
first eternal Matter ingenerable and incorruptible; which he made to be the
seminary of al Productions; out of whose passive power al Forms (by I know
not what kind of emanation) were educed. Which unintelligible opinion, though
it were but some broken Tradition of the first Chaos, yet it laid a foundation
for excluding al Divine efficience and concurrence in the production of things.
Neither are there wanting some in this Christian World, who dare assert an
Eternity of Matter, at least a possibility of the Worlds Eternity. As an
Appendix to Natural Philosophy we may add Medicine, Medicine how the cause of
Atheism.
which has had a powerful influence on Atheism in this regard; because these
proud Naturalists, observing by long experience many excellent qualities,
soverain virtues and Medicinal influences in several Minerals, Stones, Plants,
Animals, etc. hence they would fain persuade themselves and the world, that the
term of man's life was not fixed, but variable and determinable by their Art and
Medicaments: which piece of Atheism continues to this very day very commun. 2.
The Mathematic Sciences have had, 2. How the Mathematics are influential on
Atheism.
and still have no little influence on Atheism: and that (1) more general;
inasmuch as those profound Mathematicians, being wholly taken up in ocular and
sensible Demonstrations, they expect the same in Divine Matters, rejecting
Divine Authority and Testimony, though it be in some sense more certain and
infallible than their Mathematic Demonstrations. To pass by other instances
which are many, we need go no further than Hobs's Leviathan for proof hereof.
(2) But more particularly, Specially Astronomy.
Pagan Astronomy has had a powerful causalitie for the production of Atheism,
in that it brought in a fatal kind of necessity and absolute dependence not
only of Sublunary Bodies, but also of human affairs and things most contingent,
on Celestial constellations and influences. Those Pagan Astronomers held for
the most part (which some Judicial Astrologers still assert) an essential
subordination of al Sublunary causes and effects to the Celestial. Particularly
that the (...), Good order, good Temperament, good nature, and good operation,
as well moral as natural, in all human persons and affairs received measure and
determination, according to, and by derived influences from, the (...) or (...)
of the Heavens. Which persuasion yet was more tolerable in those blind
Heathens, who held the Stars to be Gods, than in the Atheistic Astrologers of
these days, who reduce the most contingent Effects and events of Providence to
some Astrologic Figures, abstract Forms, Celestial Governements, insensible
Influences, or such like Stoic Fate and Necessity, thereby to exclude Divine
Providence from ordering and determining human affairs. 3. Neither was their
Philosophy Politics less influential on this cursed root of Atheism. 3.
Philosophic Politics productive of Atheism.
For the great Politicians of former as well as of later Ages have been ever apt
to conceit, that the World is governed by no other Providence than that of
State-Wisdome and Interest: They would fain persuade themselves and others,
that al Mutations in States or private affairs do happen but from some politic
cause, contrivement, and resolutions of men. This Politic Atheism seems to
have had its birth and improvement from the Romans, (where the Pythagorean
Philosophy flourished) and the flourishing of their Empire; who finding the
success of their politic Contrivances and Resolutions, began to set the Crown
of al their successes on the head of carnal Policy and Courage, excluding
Divine Providence from sharing therein. Amongst these Politic Atheistes we may
well reckon Nebuchadnezar, according to his own proud assumings, Dan. 4.30, Dan.
4.30.
Is not this great Babylon that I have built -- by the might of my power. i.e.
By my politic contrivances and power. For the honor of my Majesty. i.e. For
the Advancement of my Name and Interest. Here we see how his proud Atheistic
heart shuts God out as efficient and final cause, both of which he ascribes to
himself. And how apt potent Princes and States are to follow proud
Nebuchadnezar, in making their own Wisdom and Power the sole efficient, as
also their own Majesty, Grandeur and Glory, the sole End of al State Affairs,
and Politic Undertakements, to the exclusion of Divine Providence, the
experience of some late years as well as former Ages has given us too great
Demonstration. That which gives these Politic Atheistes advantage is, that
whereas in the Infant-state of the World God kept alive the Memorial of his
Providence by Miraculose and amazing Operations thereof, he afterward about
the beginning of the Roman Empire, (which was the seat of Politic Atheism)
began to suspend those Miraculose Effects of his Power, employing more of
Wisdom in governing the Politic World, the effects whereof are not so obvious
to sense as those of his Power. This made these Politic Atheistes deifie their
own carnal wisdom and resolutions, as the only Moderators of human affairs.
And 'twere well if there were not too many such now-adaies. 4. But no part of
Pagan Philosophy did more directly and efficaciously conduce to the production
and improvement of Atheism, 4. Eristic Philosophy or Logic the cause of
Atheism.
than their (...), contentiose Logic, which the Scripture calls (...), etc. 2 Timothy 2.14. 1 Timothy 6.4, 5. of which before. Indeed Eristic Logic and Atheism
seem to have had their conception and birth from the same Philosophic womb, and
so, as twins, to run parallel til Pagan Philosophy grew extinct. For in the
Eleatic Schole, where this (...), contentiose Logic, received its formation and
spirit under Zeno, Democritus and others, Philosophic Atheism received also
its Conception and Birth, and that much about the same time. This appears in
that Melissus, who was condisciple with Zeno the Eleatic under Xenophanes,
seems to be the first that began (...), to suspend his belief touching the
Gods; affirming, that nothing was to be determined concerning them, by reason
of our dark and obscure knowledge. And Zeno himself held a multitude of Worlds,
and the Souls origin from the Temperament of the sour Elements: which were
both foundations of Atheism. But Leucippus, Zeno's Disciple, who is styled
(...), and Democritus, who was as to Physics Scholar to Leucippus, gave both of
them a great advance to Atheism, by their Eristic Philosophisings about
Atoms. For they asserted the origin of althings to be from the fortuitous
casual conjunction and combination of an infinite number of Atoms; which
opinion was greedily imbibed by Epicurus, and made use of by all as a medium to
solve the Phenomenon of nature, without any supposition of a Providence. This
was the product of their (...), Eristic Philosophising. And indeed nothing is
more natural and commun, than by frequent contentiose disputes at length to
grow Academics and Skeptics; so to disbelieve every thing, even the Existence
and Providence of God. And what a world of such Skeptic Atheistes are there in
this Age, who make it their (...), or work, to cavil at the Existence and
Providence of God! whose folly and iniquity is by so much the greater, by how
much the more credulous they are in matters more obscure. For the most
incredulous of these Atheistes, are as credulous in their kind as the most
simple; why else do they so greedily assent to the Principes of Epicurus, or
some modern Philosopher, upon Reasons infinitely more slight and trivial,
than those which are offered to prove a Deity? and why are they so opiniatre
and dogmatising as to the imposing their own Phenomenon, without shadow of
solid reason? Plato shall one day rise up in judgment against such Skeptic
Atheistes; who, in his Book 10 de Legib. from page 888, to 909, makes it his
business to cure a young man laboring under this Epidemic disease of Atheism;
proving, (1) That there is a God. (2) That this God takes care of human
affairs, even the least. (3) That this God is most just, and therefore not to
be flatered into favor by Prayers or Sacrifices. (4) That Atheism is the peste
of human kind, of Families, of Communwealths; and therefore to be restrained by
Penal Laws, Emprisonment, Banishment, and the like. Such are the evils of
Atheism, which had its origin from vain Philosophy influenced by pride, as
Psalm. 10.4, Psalm. 10.4.
Al his thoughts are there is no God. (...), i.e. These are the skeptic,
politic, mischievous Philosophisings of his proud heart, that there is no God.

and influences, see Court Gent. Par. 4. B. 2. C. 2.. 1. touching the Existence
of God.

. 5. We have laid down the evil Effects of Pagan Philosophy in general, as
they regard both the Pagans themselves, Pagan Philosophic the cause of Jewish
Apostasies.
as also the People of God. We now proceed to the sad evils which Pagan
Philosophy infused into the Church of God, both Jewish and Christian. We shall
begin with the Jewish Church: and here our main business will be to show that
all the great Apostasies of the Jews had their foundation in Pagan Philosophy.
To make our way clear hereto, we are to remember, that as the Pagan
Philosophers traduced the choicest pieces of their Philosophy originally from
the Jewish Church; so the Jews growing weary of their Sacred Oracles and
Mysteries, thirsted after those very corrupt Derivations and streams of Pagan
Wisdom and Mysteries, which were but dark Imitamens of, and broken Traditions
from their Divine Philosophy. So vain and foolish were their imagination. The
Jewish Baal-worship the Effect of the Philosophic Demon-Theologie.
1. The great Errors and Apostasy of the Israelitic and Jewish Church, before
the Babilonian Captivity, lay in Idolatry, and particularly in that of their
Baalim, or Demon-worship. It Is likely these Apostatising Israelites and Jews
had other vain Opinions and Heresies, besides those which related to their
Idolatry, yet we scarce find any other taken notice of and recorded in
Scripture. For the Spirit of God foreseeing that this Philosophic (...),
Demon-worship, would prove the great foundation of Apostasy both in the Jewish
and Christian Church, he seems to pass by other vain opinions, and make it his
business both by Prophetic Precautions, Threats, and Judgments, to strike at
this. So Deuteronomy. 13. throughout that Chapter, the Lord gives severe Comminations
and punishments to be inflicted on such as turn away to Idolatry; Deuteronomy. 14.1.
and more particularly Deuteronomy. 14.1. God gives a strict prohibition against
Baalim, or Demon-worship, Ye shall not cut your selves, 1 King. 18.28.
etc. That these Funeral-rites were a part of that worship they gave to their
Baalim is plain from 1 King. 18.28. Yet notwithstanding al Divine Comminations
and Maledictions, how soon did the carnal Jews affect an imitation of their
Idolatrous neighbors the Phenicians in this Baal-worship, which was the same
with the Grecian Demon-worship, and both but a Philosophic Imitamen of the
Jewish Messiah his Mysteries and Worship, as has been before once and again
proved. The sum of al is this, The Philosophers had a Divinity of their own,
(distinct from that of the Poets, which was fabulose, and that of the
Statesmen, Priests and people, which was Politic) which they called (...),
Natural Theology; wherein they, in imitation of the Jewish God and Messiah,
asserted (some of the wisest of them) one supreme soverain God, and many other
petty made Gods, which the Phenicians called Baalim, (from Belus a Phenician
King) Lords, and the Grecians, Demons: whose office was to be as Mediators
betwixt Men and the supreme God: whom the most of them conceited to have his
residence in the Heavens, yea in the Body of the Sun, as the soul in the
body, and therefore too remote, at least too sublime and pure to mingle with
Sublunarie affairs; whence there could be no communion with him but by these
Demons or Baal-Gods, who were nothing else but the Souls of great Worthies
deceased and deified. These the Apostle seems to hint, 1 Cor. 8.5, Lords many.
1 Cor. 8.5.
These Baalim were brought into Judea by Jezebel, daughter of Eth-baal King of
Tire, (where Baal or Belus the first of these Baalim reigned) and proved the
foundation of that great Israelitic and Jewish Apostasy. For no sooner were
these Baalim, by Jezebels politic contrivement, brought into the Jewish Church,
but presently they are according to, and in imitation of the Phenicians Natural
Theology, made as Mediators to the true God; and so they became as a
counter-Messias, or Anti messiah, excluding the true Messiah. For we must know,
that the Apostatizing Israelites did not wholly cast off the Worship of the
true God; no, that were too gross for such a knowing professing people: only
herein lay their Apostasy and Idolatry, that, in imitation of the
Philosophers Natural Theology, they worshipped the true God with a (...),
Demon-worship: they placed these Phenician Baalim, as an Anti-messias, in the
room of Christ. This Baal-worship is called the way of Ahab, because it was
brought into Israel by Jezebel his Queen, 1 King. 16.31, 32.
and established by him according to 1 King. 16.31, 32. which caused a total
Apostasy among them: For the true Prophets, who would not conform to this
Baal-worship, were destroyed or removed; and others, who were willing to
conform to Baals worship, put in their room; so 1 King. 18.22, Elijah says, 1
King. 18.22.
that he only of the true Prophets remained, but Baals Prophets were four
hundred and fifty men. And because these Baalim brought in by Jezebel were an
Anti-messias, hence the Gnostics infusions, who revived this Doctrine of Demons
and laid the foundation for Antichrist to build upon, is called the Doctrine of
Jezebel, Rev. 2.20.
Rev. 2.20. And indeed Jezebel was an exact type and forerunner of the
Antichristian Whore, who brought in her Saints and Saint-worship exactly
conformable to Jezebel's Baalim. As Mede on 2 Pet. 2.1. Diatrib. 3. Edit. 1.
page 548. excellently shows us: Here note, says he, that wheresoever you read
in Scripture of the Idolatry of Jeroboam's Calves, and of Ahab's Baalim, think
of what I have told you, and know, that whatsoever God speaks against these
things there, the same he speaks of the Apostate Christians under Rome, whose
case is the very same. The Holy Ghost places the essence of the great
Apostasy under the Man of Sin, in Idolatry, and spiritual fornication, etc.

2. The Apostasy of the Jewish Church after the Babylonian Captivity had in
like manner its foundation in Pagan Philosophy. The Apostasy of the Jewish
Church after the Captivity from Pagan Philosophy.
It Is true the Jews after their Captivity were professed enemies to Idolatry,
for which they had been so severely punished; yet had they great Errors and
Corruptions, which they sucked in together with the Grecian Philosophy. For
look as the Grecians, Pythagoras, Plato, etc. received the chief Rudiments and
Elements of their Philosophy from the Jewish Church; so the Jews, when they
came to live under the Grecian Monarchy, began to symbolise with their new
Lords in Wisdom and Philosophy. We find little of Pagan Philosophy in use
amongst the Jews before the Captivity, save only some few pieces of the
Mathematics, which we may presume they had from the Phenicians or the
Egyptians, or, as learned Dr Owen conceives, from the Chaldeans; and made use
of in their Idolatrous Worship. But after the Captivity, when they became
subject to their Grecian Lords, they soon drank in the Grecian Philosophy;
which proved the corruption, yea subversion of their Divine Theology. This the
pious and devote amongst them foresaw, and therefore in the time of the
Hasmoneans, or Macchabees, there was a Decree made, That whosoever taught his
Son the Grecian Philosophy should be accursed. Which notwithstanding could not
prevent the inundation of Grecian Philosophy on the Jewish Church, to the
infinite prejudice of their Sacred Theology, as it is well observed by Grotius
on Col. 2.8, (...), I do not wonder (says he) that in the times of the
Hasmoneans there was a decree made, That he should be cursed that taught his
Son the Grecian Philosophy; not that it was in it self evil to know it, but in
that they saw much danger therein. And truly we must confess, that after the
Jews gave up themselves to the study of Greek Books, their ancient Doctrine
was much sophisticated. It Is confessed, that the Jews before the Captivity had
very much perverted their Doctrine, Esa. 47.10.
according to Esa. 47.10. Thy wisdom and knowledge has perverted thee. (...),
i. e. caused thee to turn aside. But after their return from Babylon there
was an universal Reformation made by Esra and others both as to Doctrine and
Discipline, which continued til this new soundation of Apostasy was laid by
the mixing Grecian Philosophy with their Doctrine. This is well observed by
Owen, Theol. lib. 5. cap. 14. The Jewish Doctors before the Babylonian
Captivity seem (according to what mention we sind) to have received none of
the Exotic literature or sciences, excepting the Mathematics; which they seem
to have received from the Chaldeans, and to have abused to Idolatrous uses. For all human Wisdom is prone to Pride and (...), Superstition, specially when it
falls upon a Mind not brought into obedience to the Truth. For that Grecian
Philosophy being by degrees brought into the Church, it speedily turned to the
ruin of the more pure Theology. Hence they, whose Religion consisted only in
Faith and Obedience, began to erect Schools altogether unlike those over which
the ancient Prophets presided, and to sal into Sects. The names of Plato and
Aristotle were not more famous amongst the rout of Grecian disputers, than
those of Shammai, Hillel, etc. amongst the Jews.

Now the Corruptions that crept into the Jewish Theology by its commixture
with the Grecian Philosophy, may be reduced to these three heads. (1) Their
Cabalistic Mythologie. Tie Jewish Cabala from the Grecian Symbolic Philosophy.
(2) Their Pharisaic and Talmudic Dochrines and Traditions. (3) Their Eristic
or contentiose Disputations. 1. As for the Jewish Cabala or Cabalistic
Mythologie, it seems to be exactly framed in imitation of the Grecian
Mythologie and Symbolic mode of Philosophising. It Is true, the Jewish Church
had even from its first Institution its choicest Mysteries delivered in
Symbols, Parables, Enigmes, and other terrene shadows; whence we need no way
dout, the Pagan Philosophers, Egyptians, Phenicians and Grecians traduced their
Mythologic and Enigmatic modes of Philosophising. These the Jews, when they
came under the Grecian Government, so far fell in love with, as that, despising
their own Sacred Oracles and Mysteries, (by reason of their simplicity) they
clothe them with a new Grecian habit, or fabulose garb, which they call their
Cabala, or mystic sense; by virtue whereof they in a short time grew as skilful
in coming Fables as ever the Grecians were. This Jewish Cabala was so called
from (...) to receive: for as the office of the Rabbi or Doctor was (...) to
deliver; so that of the Disciple was (...) to receive: which sometimes also was
expressed by (...), to hear. Whence the Cabalistes were wont to express the
Traditions of their Doctors by this (...), the wise said: answerably to that
(...), he said it, in the Pythagorean Schole. Reuchlin, de Art Cabalist. l. 3.
p. 51. assures us, That the Judaic Cabala is nothing else but their Symbolic
Theology, wherein not only Letters and Names are signs of things, but also
things of things. The Papists make their Anagogic sense of Scripture
correspondent to the Judaic Cabala. Some refer the Origin of this Cabalistic
sense of Scripture to the Angel Raziel's consolation given to Adam in Paradise
after his Fall, as Reuchlin: others to Moses, as Johan. Picus Mirand. others to
Esra, as Paulus Fagius. But I conceive it no difficult task to demonstrate,
that this Cabalistic Symbolic Explication of Scripture found no place in the
Judaic Theology, 'til the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy was
incorporated therewith. And indeed Johannes Picus, that noble Earl of
Mirandula, and prodigiose Scholar, seems to grant this our Hypothesis, by
acknowleging the assinitie of the Jewish Cabala to the Pythagorean and Platonic
Philosophy. So learned Reuchlin, de Art. Cabalist. page 22, 23. makes this
Cabalistic Theology the same with the Pythagorean Doctrine. Hence also the
Gnostics and Valentinians imbibed their Mystic Theology, as hereafter,. 7.
These Cabalistes making it their main study to comment on the Sacred Text,
mingled, according to the Grecian Mode, so many Fables therewith, as that
little of the Divine Character appeared: there was no Text so clear, so
Historic, but they brought it under some Cabala, or mystic and allegoric sense;
so that the Jewish Theology seemed more like to Pythagoras and Plato's
Philosophy, than to the Sacred Institutes of Moses and the Prophets. That the
Hellenistic Jews generally followed the Symbolic, Allegoric Philosophy of
Pythagoras and Plato, is evident by the Writings of their chiefest Sophists,
Philo Judaeus, and al such as were bred up at Alexandria, where the Pythagorean
and Platonic Philosophy flourished. So Eusebius Hist. Eccles. lib. 2. cap. 4.
(...), etc. He greatly affected the Platonic and Pythagorean Philosophy,
speaking of Philo Jud us. But the Scripture gives us a sufficient account
touching these Philosophic Fables, which had been foisted into the Jewish
Theology by the Cabalistes. 1 Timothy 1.4.
So 1 Timothy 1.4. (...). He treats here, says Grotius, of such as turning from
Judaisme to Christianisme mixed many Jewish Fables with Christianisme, as the
consequents show, and Tit. 1.14. Such were those Jewish Fables concerning what
God did before the Creation: of Man being at first made (...), of his
copulation with the Bestes, and with Lilith, and of the Demons springing
thence, of Behemoth and Leviathan, of the Soul's pre-existence before the
body, etc. That many of these Fables were Pythagorean and Platonic is evident.
Which we may presume these Grecian Philosophers at first took up in imitation
of Jewish Mysteries, and then the Jews took them up again at second hand from
the Philosophers. The like 1 Timothy 4.7. (...). He understandes, says Grotius,
the Doctrine of Metempseuchosis, which was the foundation of this abstinence.
So Tit. 1.14. (...), i.e. says Grotius, of the Messiah being a Temporal
Monarch, of the first Resurrection on the Earth, of the War of Gog and Magog,
etc. Of which see what precedes, B. 1. chapter 4.. 1. See more of this Judaic
Cabala, Hottinger. Thesaur. Philolog. l. 1. c. 3. Sect. 5. p. 437, etc.

2. The Jewish Theology had in its Declension, besides the Cabala, 2. The
Jewish Talmud of Traditions.
or Mystic Explication of Scripture, a Talmud or systeme of Traditions, which
they pretend were at first delivered by God unto Moses on the Mount, to be
handed down by Joshua and his Successors unto Posterity. This they call (...),
the Oral Law, which they equalize unto, yea prefer before the Scriptures. For
they say, (just as the Papists of their Traditions) That we cannot arrive to a
perfect explication of the Divine Precepts, but by these Traditions of the
Ancients: again, that without this Oral Law, the whole written Law is wrapped
up in darkness. Whence they affirm, that men offend more by breaking these
Traditions, than by violating the words of the Law, as Sanhedr. c. 10.. 3. Yea
they command that al Talmudic Traditions be swallowed down with an implicit
faith, as R. Sol. Jarchi, on Deuteronomy. 17.11. See more of this, Hotting. Thesaur.
Philolog. l. 2. c. 3. S. 3. p. 560, etc. This Oral Law the Pharisees made the
rule of their will worship, as Mark 7.3-13. These in aftertimes they compiled
into their Falmuds; on which the Rabbines have spent vast Commentaries. But to
give the true origin of these Pharisaic Rabbinic Traditions, they were indeed
but corrupt imitations of Pythagorean Philosophy and Mysteries. For as the
Pythagoreans received their Mysteries and Discipline by Tradition originally
from the Jews, so the Jews when they came under the Grecian yoke reassume many
of these Pythagorean Dogmes and Institutes, and coin many more in imitation of
their Pythagorean Preceptors. That many of those Traditions mentioned in the
New Testament were Pythagorean as well as Jewish is evident: particularly Mark
7.3, 5. the Pharisees call them (...), supposing them to be traduced down from
Moses by Oral Tradition; but Christ calls them ver. 7. (...), i.e. of the
Pythagorean Philosophers, as Col. 2.22, 23. Again Christ calls them, Mark 7.8.
(...). by which also he seems to strike at the Pythagoreans, according to Col.
2.8, 20, 21. That the Rabbinic Pharisaic Dogmes of Freewil, etc. were of
Philosophic Origin shall be (as already it has been) proved.

3. Al those Eristic and vain disputes amongst the Jews had also their origin
from Grecian Philosophy. 3. The Jewish disputation from the Grecian
Philosophy. Tit. 3.9.
So Tit. 3.9. (...). i.e. says Grotius, those vain questions and various
emanations of Proprieties, or (...), the figments of idle Jews: thence (...).
i. e. says Grotius, contentions arising from the differing interpretation of
the Law. The Jews at Crete labored under the same disease with those of
Ephesus, 2 Timothy 2.23. The Jewish Doctors never knew what belonged to such
Eristic contentiose disputes before they were made drunken with Grecian
Philosophy. Lastly, the later Jews are thought to receive much of their
corruption from the Stoic Philosophy: so Heinsius, 2 de Sat. Horat. says,
That an egg is not more like an egg, than the Paradoxes of the Rabbines to
the Paradoxes of the Stoics. Yet Maimonides, and Aben Tibbon follow Aristotle
for the most part according to the Arabic Versions. For these later Jews
mingling with the Saracens have received their Philosophy from them, as
Hornius Hist. Philos. l. 5. c. 10.

. 6. As the Pagan Philosophic had a very poisonous pestilentiose influence on
the Jewish Church, Pagan Philosophic the cause of the greatest Errors in the
Christian Churches.
so has it been not less perniciose to the Christian Churches both primitive
and later. This the Spirit of God foresaw, and therefore he abounds in his
Divine Premonitions and cautions against admitting this vain Philosophy into
the Churches of Christ, so as to give any occasion for its mixture with the
great Doctrines of Faith. We have given several Scriptures to make this good,
and shall at present only add that, 2 Timothy 2.14, 16, 17, 18, 23. v. 14. (...),
2 Timothy 2.14, etc. (...)
put them in remembrance. (...), i.e. frequently inculcate this on thy hearers,
etc. (...), obtesting or adjuring them before the Lord. It notes the most
solemn Adjuration. And to what? (...), that they strive not about words; i.e.
according to the custom of the vain Philosophers, who had their (...), strifes
about words. In opposition whereto he exhortes Timothic, v. 15. To study, that
he approve himself to God, -- (...), Ver. 15. (...).
rightly dividing the word of truth. (...), from (...) and (...), properly
signifies to divide accurately: but here it is taken Metaphorically, as by the
Seventy, Prove. 3.6. (...). So Prove. 11.5. (...). Hebr. (...), which the Seventy
elsewhere render (...), and (...). Grotius and others take the Metaphor from
the accurate Section and division of the Sacrifices; which the Levites,
according to a certain solemn rite, accurately divided. But our learned N.
Fuller, Miscel. l. 3. c. 16. makes it to be a Metaphoric allusion to the
Section of the Law, communly understood by all. For, the Verses of the Scripture
were styled (...), i.e. (...), segmenta, or particles. Whence they who gave up
themselves to the study of the Scriptures, were styled (...), they who divided
the Law. Thus Paul exhortes Timothy, (who was from his infance instituted in
the Scriptures, and therefore well understood the import of this phrase) (...),
accurately to divide the word of truth: which he opposes to the (...), i.e.
striving about words, v. 14. So v. 16. (...), shun. Ver. 16.
There is a great elegance in the original, which signifies primarily to
circumclude, or shut up, thence to shun or avoid; because we are wont to shut
up what we fear and would avoid, as Lions, Bears, etc. The same word is used
Tit. 3.9. Then he adds the matter he was to avoid; (...), profane and vain
bablings; i.e. says Grotius, Men's comments or figments about Divine matters
without any Revelation. (...) signifies (1) Aclamor about vain matters: or (2)
Avain clamor; or clamor of vain words, such as agree not with the form of
sound Doctrine. So Chrysostom understands it here, of such new forms of
speech, or unheard of terms, which were not used in the Churches. (...) is of
the same import with (...), v. 14. and takes in all Philosophic discourses or
disputes; which in matters Divine without a Divine Revelation are (...), profane
and vain bablings. For, adds he, they will increase unto more ungodliness.
(...). i.e. such vain Philosophisings, though they seem to have some
ressemblance to Divine Truth, and but little error in them, yet will they in the
issue determine in the foulest Heresies and Abominations, even in
Antichristianisme. Ver. 17.
Thence it follows, v. 17. (...), their Philosophic discourse or Ratiocination:
(...)
for so (...) may signify as well as word. (...), will eat as does a Cancer. The
word we translate Cancer signifies properly a Gangrene, which is somewhat like,
though different from a Cancer. That phrase (...), will eat, has a peculiar
significance in it: for we know a Gangrene mightily spreads and feeds upon the
sound flesh: (...), as Lev. 13.22. Whence the Greeks derive (...), i.e. (...),
to eat; as Hesychius. It properly signifies the mortification of some carnose
part, by reason of an inflammation; so that if there be not some opportune
remedy immediately applied, or the part cut off, the Gangrene eats farther and
farther on the adjacent parts, until the whole man perish. Such a venomous and
dissusive influence has vain Philosophy on the minds of men, yea on whole
Churches. This (adds Grotius) he affirms, That Philosophic evil spreades far,
specially seeing many will embrace this mode of living, that they may avoid those
punishments which hang over the Christians. Nothing does so much hurt
Christianisme as those Institutes, which came very near to Christianisme, and
by certain interpretations mollified the (...), Polutheisme. Of whom is
Hymeneus and Philctus: v. 18. who concerning the truth have erred, saying the
Resurrection is past already. These Pythagorising Gnostics, by their
Philosophic Allegories, endeavored to make void the Doctrine of the Gospel
touching the Resurrection. The Philosophers, both Pythagorcans and Platonistes,
as they called a wicked life, (...), death; so a reformed life was by them
termed (...), a Resurrection, and (...), a new birth: and these sensual
Gnoslics, that they might the more freely enjoy their lusts without fear of a
future judgment, would needs persuade themselves and others, that the
Resurrection, of which the Gospel speaks so plainly, was already past;
intending thereby the Philosophers symbolic allegoric Resurrection. Then the
Apostle concludes, 2 Timothy 2.23.
v. 23. foolish and unlearned questions avoid. (...) foolish, i.e. because they
no way tend to true Wisdom: al these Philosophic Allegories and Questions are
but a mere (...), foolish wisdom. See the like, 1 Timothy 1.4, etc. (...),
unlearned. (...) uncorrigable, impudent. (...) is sometimes put for (...), as
Prove. 8.5. sometimes for (...), Prove. 15.13. as also sometimes for (...), Prove.
17.22. Paul here (says Grotius) understandes immodest Questions. For the
Greeks express (...) by (...), because (...) and (...) are of the same import.
Knowing that they gender to strife, as Tit. 3.9. The Hebrew (...) is sometimes
rendered (...), sometimes (...), as Grotius. By all which it is evident, that
this Gnostic Gangrene had its rise from Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy.
And indeed that the Philosophers were the great Heresiarchs, or founders of al
those great Errors and Heresies, which like a Gangrene insested the Christian
Theology and Churches, was a commun received persuasion amongst the Fathers
and Primitive Christians: the truth whereof will appear evident by an examen of
Particulars, and discovery how all the great Errors brought into the Christian
Church, both before and after the rise of Antichrist, had their origin from
Pagan Philosophy.

. 7. The first great Heresy, The Gnostics Errors from Pagan Philosophic.
which as a Gangrene did overspread and consume much of the beauty, glory,
and vigor of the Primitive Churches, was that of the Gnostics, which had taken
a considerable rooting in the Apostles days, as is gathered from the Epistles
of Paul to the Corinthians, Ephesians, Colossians, and Timothy; also from the
Epistles of Peter, and Jude; al which seem sul of severe admonitions and
invectives against these poisonous Infusions of the Gnostics; which the Spirit
of God did the more abundantly caution the Churches against, because he foresaw
they would open an effectual door to Antichrist, and his Exaltation in the
Temple of God. Theodoret, Eusebius, and Nicephorus make this Heresy of the
Gnostics to arise from Saturninus, Basilides, and Carpocrates, about An. 137.
But others refer the origin of this Heresy to the Apostles times, as in what
follows. Now that these Gnostic Infusions were but the corrupt offspring of
Pagan Philosophy is generally acknowleged by the Learned, and will be very
apparent by a brief consideration of Particulars. 1. As to the origination of
their Name, 1. The origination of their Name.
they were called (...), Gnostics, from their own assumings and pretensions to
an extraordinary (...), knowledge, which indeed was but spurious and false
Science, as the Apostle upbraids them, 1 Timothy 6.20. (...), of science falsely
so called. 1 Timothy 6.20.
You see here, says Grotius, how ancient the name of Gnostics is, which these
Philosophers mixing with the Christian Assemblies assumed to themselves,
despising al others as rude and ignorant, and falsely challenging the encomium
of Science. Clemens says, the Gnostics rejected this Epistle, because they saw
themselves so lively characterised herein. I will not positively affirm, that
the name (...), Gnostics, was given to, or assumed by them in the Apostles
days, though Grotius and Hammond favor this sentiment; because some learned
men contradict it: but this I believe, that the Gnostic Infusions and Errors
were very much diffused through some of the Primitive Churches in the Apostles
days; and therefore often struck at in their Epistles, as it will appear by what
follows, out of Irenaeus Disciple of Polycarp, who lived in the second
Centurie, and professedly wrote against the Gnostics, and Valentinus their
Sectator. Yea Eusebius and Photius tell us, that Irenaeus's five Books against
the Gnostics, and Valentinians, had this title, (...), a reviction of knowledge
falsely so called. That these Gnostics had dissused much of their poison in the
Apostles times, is affirmed by Ignatius in his Epistle to Philadelph. if
genuine.

2. As to their Doctrine; 2. The Gnostics mystic Theologic. Jude v. 19.
these Pythagorising Gnostics pretended unto a very mystic, sublime, and
spiritual Theologic, answerable to their name. So Jude v. 19. These be they
that separate themselves. (...), i.e. says Grotius, who separate and
distinguish themselves from others, as more wise and knowing, (...). Not having
the Spirit; i.e. they boast of very great spiritual Inspirations, but indeed
they are but Diabolic Infusions; not from the Spirit. That this Mystic
Theology of the Gnostics was indeed the issue of vain Pagan Philosophy,
together with some Jewish Observances, is a general persuasion of the Learned,
Grotius and others. Irenaeus and Epiphanius tell us, that the Gnostics had the
Images of Plato and Pythagoras, which they joined with the Image of Christ:
This indeed holds true as to al their Mystic Theology, which was but a
composition of Platonic and Pythagoric Philosophemes, persumed with some Judaic
and Christian Dogmes. Col. 2.8.
So Hammond on Col. 2.8. With Philosophy and vain deceit. Paraph. And take
care (says he) that no body plunder you of all that you have, your Principles
of Christian Knowledge, by that vain, emty, frothie, pretended knowledge and
wisdom, which the Gnostics talk of, 1 Timothy 1.4. and 6.20. taken out of the
Heathenish Pythagorean Philosophy, together with the observances of the
Mosaical Law, and very distant and contrary to Christian Divinity. Thus
Hammond, who adds the same in his Paraphrase on v. 9. for in him, etc. i.e.
for the whole will of God is by Christ really made known to us, -- and therefore
there is little need of the additions of the Gnostics, which they borrow out of
the Heathen and Jewish Theology, to supply the defects of the Evangelical
Doctrine. The like he adds v. 10. of which hereafter. But to treat more
distinctly of the origin of this Mystic Theologic taken up by the Gnostics, as
a medium for symbolising with the Gentiles, we must know, that it was partly
Mythologic and fabulose; partly Symbolic and Enigmatic; and wholly Allegoric.
(1) As for the Mythologic and fabulose part of the Gnostics Mystic Theology,
1. The Gnostic Theology mythic and fabulose.
it seems to be derived from the Mythologic Philosophers and Poets, Orpheus,
Hesiod, Amiphanes, Philistion, and Pherecydes, who writ of the (...),
Genealogy of the Gods; whence the Gnostics borrowed their (...), Conjunctions,
and from them Genealogies, how one thing joined to another begets a third: as
out of night and silence (say they) comes forth Chaos, etc. which indeed was
the same with the Theology of Orpheus, and the rest of these Theologistes. 1 Timothy 1.4.
So 1 Timothy 1.4. That they give not heed to fables and endless genealogies. He
calls them Genealogies, (says Grotius) because they feigned the emanation of
the one from the other. And for these Genealogies they would seem more wise
than others; whence despising other Christians as more rude and ignorant, they
made the name (...), of Gnostics, peculiar to themselves. Though indeed al
their (...), or Mystic Theology, was but a mere Mythologic Philosophic (...),
or fabulose Wisdom, taken up in imitation of the Orphic Mystic Theology, or
Genealogy of the Gods, etc. as hereafter. (2) Neither was this Gnostic
Theology only Mythologic, but also Symbolic, Enigmatic and Allegoric, in
imitation of the Pythagoric and Platonic Philosophy, 1. The Gnostics Aeones,
their office as Mediators and origin from Pythagorean and Platonic Ideas and
Demons.
as it may appear by the following Discourse of its parts.

1. A great and principal part of the Gnostics Mystic Theology comprehended
the Doctrine of their Aeones, their Origin, Genealogy, and Office, which they
took up in imitation of the Pythagorean and Platonic Ideas and Demons, applying
the same to the Angels. So Ireneus, advers. Haeres. lib. 2. cap. 19. where he
opens this mystery to us, showing how these Gnostics framed their Aeones in
imitation of the ancient Poets and Philosophers, Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato,
etc. Antiphanes, says he, in his Theogonie, says, that out of night and
silence the Chaos came forth, etc. Hence the Gnostics formed their Aeones. --
And that they call them Images or Ideas, they manifestly follow the opinion of
Democritus and Plato -- But in that they make the Savior to result out of al
these Aeones, they bring in nothing but Hesiod's Pandora. And in that they will
that all this be transferred into Numbers, this they had from the Pythagoreans,
etc. He tells us, that these Reveries were framed out of the Platonic Ideas,
etc. Tertullian, libro de anima, says, That the heretic seeds of the Gnostics
shined in the Platonic Ideas. Which he calls in the same place, The heretic
Sacraments of Ideas. And more fully, lib. de Praescript. cap. 7. Tertullian
assures us, That the very Heresies of the Gnostics had their composure and
ornament from Philosophy. Thence the Aeones, and I know not what forms and
Trinity of man in Valentinus, who was of this Gnostic sect, as hereafter. And
as the Pythagoric and Platonic Ideas contributed much to these Gnostic Aeones,
so also their Doctrines of Demons. Thus Grotius and Hammond out of him seem to
make those (...), Doctrines of Demons, 1 Timothy 4.1.
mentioned 1 Timothy 4.1. to be the character of the Gnostics Theologic, which so
far as the Gnostics were types and forerunners of Antichrist his
Demon-Doctrines and Apostasy, we may safely grant. Though, I conceive, that
Prophetic character primarily refers to the Antichristian (...), which was but
an imitamen of the Philosophers (...), or Demon-worship, as hereafter: yet we
may also take in the Gnostic Aeones, as forerunners of Antichrists Saints, and
Imitamens of the Philosophers Demons. And indeed these Gnostic (...), Aeones,
as to their Origin and Office, seem much the same with the Pythagorean and
Platonic Demons. For these Gnostics looked on their Aeones as midling-Gods, or
Mediators; which our Apostle seems to strike at Col. 2.10. Col. 2.10, 19.
Ye are complete in him which is the Head of al principality and power. i.e.
(says Hammond in his Paraphrase) By him you have knowledge enough to complete
you, without such supplies as these, from the Doctrines and Divinity of the
Gnostics about their Aeones, looked on by them as Divine Immortal Powers, of
which, whatsoever they are, (if they be not Idol-nothings) be they Angels of a
superior or second degree, Christ is the Head; and they that have Christ, need
not trouble themselves with these accessions. By which it is plain, that these
Gnostics made their Aeones, as Mediators, answerable to the Philosophers
Demons, and Antichrists Saints; which were al erected as Mediators in the room
of Christ. Therefore v. 18. we find mention of a Voluntary humility and
worship, which these Pythagorising Gnostics gave unto their Angelic Powers or
Aeones; which ver. 19. is styled a not holding the Head: i.e. (says Hammond in
his Paraphr.) They that be guilty hereof disclaim Christ, who indeed is the
Head of his Church, the only Intercessor to his Father. The Apostle seems the
more invective against these Gnostic A ones and Mediators, because they were
but the forerunners of Antichrist and his Demons or Saints. This seems to be
the meaning of that Scripture, '1 John 2.18. Ye have heard that Antichrist shall
come, 1 John 2.18.
even now are there many Antichrists. The Syriac renders (...), i.e. (...), a
false Christ. Such indeed were these Gnostic Aeones, as the Pythagorean Demons,
whence they sprang, and both the Parents and precursors of the great Antichrist
and his Demon Saints. I know Grotius, (and so Hammond who follows him) out of
his too great favor for the Roman Antichrist, restraines this and other
Prophetic discoveries of Antichrist to some Pseudochrist, or Antichrist started
up in the Apostles times; such as Barchochebas amongst the Jews, Apollonius
Tyanaeus amongst the Pagans, and Simon Magus amongst the Gnostics: but this is
too narrow a conceit to find room in any true Christian heart. Yet thus much we
may allow him, and al other Cassandrian Patrones of the Roman Antichrist, that
these holy Penmen, in their Prophetic discoveries of the great Antichrist,
might have an eye on those Pagan, Jewish, and Gnostic Antichrists of their
time, as forerunners and Ideas of the great Roman Antichrist. And indeed it is
our safest course to interpret Scripture in its largest sense.

But as to the origin of these Gnostic Aeones, they were taken up in imitation
of the Grecian (...), Generation of the Gods, begun by Sanchoniathon the
Phenician Mythologist, who was followed herein by Orpheus, Hesiod, and
Pherecydes, who was of Phenician extract, and spent a main part of his
Philosophisings in the explaining this (...), Genealogy of the Gods: from whom
we may presume Pythagoras his Scholar learned the same, as also from the Orphic
Theologistes, with whom he much conversed. Now the Gnostics apply the whole of
this Pagan (...), Generation of the Gods, to their (...), Aeones, or Angelic
Powers; which the Apostle seems to strike at, 1 Timothy 1.4. Neither give heed to
Fables and endless Genealogies, which minister questions, etc. i. e. (says
Hammond in his Paraphrase) warn thy flock not to heed those fabulose Pedegrees
of the Gods, which under the name of Aeones the Gnostics talk so much of, and
so bring in many perplexe disputes. The like in his note on (...). Most of the
Divinity, says he, of the Gnostics consisted of Conjunctions, and then from
them Genealogies, how one thing joins with another, and begets a third, and
applies all the Theology and Genealogies of the Gods in Orpheus, etc. to the
(...), Aeones, as they called the Angels, etc. See Iren. l. 2. c. 19.

2. These Pythagorising Gnostics abounded much in Will Worship, 2. The Gnostics
will worship from Pagan Institutes. Col. 2.16, 18.
and Superstitiose Ceremonies, in imitation of Pythagorean Institutes and
Demon-worship. This the Apostle seems to intimate, Col. 2.16. Let no man
therefore judge you in meat and drink, etc. As the Gnostics did. Then he adds,
v. 18. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility, and
worshipping of Angels, etc. i.e. (says Hammond) Let no man please himself, and
condemn you, in point of worshipping Angels as Mediators to God, as if there
were some special humility in so doing, etc. Which the Gnostics were guilty
of. Thence v. 20, 21, 22. he mentions sundry Pythagorean Institutes which these
Gnostics assumed. Ver. 23.
And then ver. 23. he concludes, Which things have indeed a show of wisdom.
(...), a pretext or vain umbrage of Pythagorean wisdom, etc. In Will Worship.
(...), i.e. according to the Thracian, Orphic, and Pythagorean Institutes,
which abounded in Will worship, and (...), Demon-fear. (...) signifies Religiose
Rites and Worship, which Plutarch deduceth from the Thracians, among whom the
Orphic Mysteries prevailed. Whence it is often used to signify Superstition and
superstitiose worship, Col. 2.18.
as Col. 2.18. (...), the superstitiose worship of Angels. So Hesychius
interprets (...) by (...), a superstitiose person. Hence (...) signifies
primarily, a worship invented and instituted by the will of man. So it is taken
materially and passively for any worship that receives its original Institution
from the will of man, not the will of God. Thence Hesychius explicates (...), by
(...), Will Worship: and Phavorinus expounds, (...), he worships according to
his own will, what seems good to him. And because al such Will worship is in
Divine estimation superstition, hence (...) is here rendered by the old Latin,
Ambrose, and Erasmus, Superstitio, q. Supra statutum. Such was the
superstitiose Will Worship of the Gnostics, which they invented in imitation of
the Philosophic (...), or Demon-worship, as hereafter, C. 2. S. 3.. 10.

3. More particularly these Gnostics affected Celibate, 3. Forbidding Marriage
Pythagorean.
and forbad Marriage, in imitation of the Pythagoreans. So Theodoret says, that
Saturnius, a Ringleader amongst the Gnostics, was the first amongst Christians
that affirmed Marriage to be the work of the Devil: and Clemens Alex. Strom. l.
3. says, this was generally the Doctrine of the Gnostics. So Hammond on 1 Timothy
4.3. Forbidding to marie. 1 Timothy 4.3.
Part of the character of these Gnostic Heretics is to interdict Marriages, and
speak against them as unlawful. -- These Heretics had much of their Doctrine
from the Pythagorean Philosophers, etc. Hence,

4. These Pythagorising Gnostics enjoined Abstinence from the flesh of Bestes,
and several other meats, as Col. 2.21, 22. 4. Abstinences.
Touch not, taste not, handle not; which were Pythagorean Injunctions assumed
by these Gnostics, as before. So Hammond on 1 Timothy 4.3. Commanding to abstain
from meats, etc. See Theodoret and Clemens Alex. Strom. l. 3. of the Gnostic
Abstinences.

5. The Gnostics also, in imitation of the Pythagoreans, 5. Their Sorcerie,
Divination, etc.
much addicted themselves to Divination, Sorcerie, and lying wonders. This was
that which Simon Magus, the Father of the Gnostics, endeavored to render
himself famous by, who would sain have purchased the gist of doing Miracles
from the Apostles; but when that could not be, he gives up himself to the Devil
for a purchase of the same; which, as the Ancients generally report, he grew
famous for both amongst the Heathens and Gnostic Gospellers. Insomuch that
Hammond and Grotius would fain restrain Antichrists lying wonders, 2 These. 2.9.
to Simon Magus, or suchlike.

6. These carnal Gnostics, 6. Their sensuality and uncleanness. 2 Pet. 2.18.
notwithstanding their pretensions to spiritual Mysteries, professed and
practiced monstrose Sensuality and uncleanness. These seem struck at 2 Pet.
2.18. (...), lasciviose ways. (...), Selga, was a Town in Pisidia, (...),
where men lived luxuriosely, and polluted themselves by mutual uncleanness.
Whence unclean persons were termed (...), eminently selgites, (...) being here
augmentative, as the Etymologist, Suidas, and Bochart. Whence Pliny, Not.
Hist. l. 15. c. 7. makes mention of Selitic Oil, which these Selgites invented,
to fortify their spirits and nerves, debilitated by luxury and uncleanness.
Schmidius and others give a contrary character of these Selgites; yet al agree
in this, that (...) signifies great luxury and libidinose uncleanness, which
the Gnostics were guilty of. For, says Grotius, they gave their Philtra, or
love-charmes, and counted lasciviose deeds amongst things indifferent. Jude 12.
So Jude 12. (...), in your love-festes; which these sensual Gnostics converted
into fuel for their uncleanness. The Nicolaitans, Rev. 2.15. seem to be of
this Gnostic Sect. He that has a mind to hear more of their monstrose
wickedness may consult Epiphanius and Irenaeus, who have laid them open.

7. These Gnostics had, 7. Their Expiations, etc. 2 Timothy 4.4.
in imitation of the Pythagorean Purifications, their Expiations. So Grotius on
2 Timothy 4.4. (...). These Fables (says he) were concerning the Expiations of
sins, according to the Chaldaic and Orphic Disciplines. In those a chief place
was given to Seawater, and thence to fountain water, Scilla, sulphur, bitumen,
etc. The Gnostics held also free will, as Jansenius informs us.

8. Lastly, 8. They turned the Resurrection into an Allegoric, as. 6.
to lay a sure foundation for their wickedness, these Gnostics denied the
Resurrection, turning all the Scriptures that tended to prove the Resurrection
into mere Allegories. So Hymeneus and Philetus, who were of this Gnostic sect,
2 Timothy 2.18. Saying the Resurrection is past already. i.e. They turned the
Scripture-relation of the Resurrection into a mere Allegoric (...) and (...),
in imitation of the Pythagorean and Platonic Resurrections, as Grotius.
Touching Pythagoras's (...), and its ressemblance to the Gnostic, see Court
Gent. P. 2. B. 2. C. 2.. 8. These were the noxious Infusions of the
Pythagorising Gnostics, who were herein but forerunners of the Roman
Antichrist, Pagan Philosophy the cause of many Errors amongst the Fathers, etc.
as we shall fully demonstrate, Chap. 2.

. 8. As Pagan Philosophy laid the foundation of the Gnostic Heresy, so also
of the great fundamental Errors, which have been ever since broched and revived
in the Churches of Christ. And indeed herein we may not excuse the Greek
Fathers, who being many of them brought up in the Schole of Alexandria, and
other Academies, where the Grecanic Philosophy flourished, drank in therewith
many Philosophic Errors and Infusions, which proved not a little prejudicial to
the simplicity of the Christian Theology. Thus Justin Martyr, having his
spirit deeply drencht in Platonic Philosophy, even to some degree of
Intemperance, (1) he presumed, That Plato's Dogmes were not aliene from the
Doctrine of Christ, as Apol. 1. (2) Hence he asserted, That such as lived
according to reason, albeit Pagans, as Socrates, Heraclitus, and suchlike,
might be saved. (3) He held, in imitation of the Philosophers Demons, that God
committed the care of human affairs, and sublunary things to Angels, as Apol.
1. p. 44. (4) He was too much a Patron of Moral free will, in corrupt nature, as
Apol. 2. Thus also Clemens Alexandrinus, so termed because brought up at
Alexandria in Egypt, having been educated in Philosophic, which then greatly
flourished in the Schole of Alexandria, he therewith imbibed many Errors, which
he mixed with his Christian Theology. As (1) He held, That Christ assumed
flesh, thereby to demonstrate unto men their sufficient forces to obey Gods
Commandments: whence also he asserted, That obedience and inobedience was in
our power; as Strom. 2. Likewise, That the precepts of God are such as may be,
or not be observed by us, as Strom. 4. Yea Strom. 2. he says, That Faith also
is in our power, because infidelity. Which Pelagian Infusions he imbibed from
the Stoic Philosophy, wherein his spirit was drenched. Yet Strom. 3. he
assertes efficacious Grace for the production of al Moral good. And Strom. 2.
he owns the Infusion of faith by God, which he makes to be (...). (2) He
asserted, That those who were before Christ, and lived honestly, were made just
by the Law, and by Philosophic, yet that they wanted faith in Christ; whence
that in Hell they expected the coming of Christ and his Apostles, by whose
Preaching there they were converted to believe in Christ, and so at length
saved. Again, That none were perfectly saved by Christ before his coming, as
Strom. 5.6. (3) He sometimes assertes Justification by Works: as in
Protreptico, he says, Men might purchase Salvation by their own works:
sometimes he joines Faith and Works together, as Strom. 5, and 6. (4) He held
with the Stoics, That perfection in Virtue was attainable in this life, Strom.
6, 7. (5) He calls Martyrie the purgation of sin. Strom. 4. But none imbibed
more Philosophic Errors than Origin, as in what follows. How much Philosophy
corrupted the Fathers, has been taken notice of by many Reformers; as by
Amesius, Bellarm. Enerv. Tom. 4. lib. 6. cap. 1. It is evident, that the
Fathers by and from Philosophy introduced into the Church various modes of
speaking, specially of human Merits, and of the righteousness of the Gospel,
which appear not in Scripture; whence there was occasion given and taken by the
Scholemen of framing perniciose Errors. The like Tilenus, Syntagm. part. 2.
Disp. 16. These. 31. Neither (says he) did the Fathers introduce into the
Church some Ornaments only from Rhetoricians, but also Dogmes from the
Philosophers Schools, specially from Plato's Academie; some also from Zeno's
porch; which were incorporated by little and little into the Church. At length
things growing worse and worse, Plato being ejected by the Scholemen
(successors of the Fathers) and Aristotle exalted into Christ's chair, he does
even engage in controversy with Christ about the Rule of truth, specially in
the Doctrine (...), about contingent and free will: although truly in this
point the most ancient Greek Fathers had rather hear Aristotle than Paul. Thus
Tilenus, who afterward himself fell into the same snare as to Free Will, etc.

This in a more peculiar manner concerns the Greek Fathers, Origen's Errors
from Philosophic.
such as were brought up in the Schole of Alexandria, specially ' Origin, who
being Scholar to Ammonius, that great Master of Platonic Philosophy, (whom
some reckon to be a Christian) follows his Masters steps in endeavoring to
reform Platonic Philosophy, and reduce it to the form of Christian
Theology; wherein he came infinitely short of his design: for he did by these
his vain attemts, but the more sophisticate and adulterate Divine Theology;
not only by his many Platonic Allegories, but also by those several Philosophic
terms and errors which he mixed with the Doctrines of Faith, Ludov. Vives in
August. Civit. lib. 9. cap. 11. tells that from Plato's Demons Origin without
dout derived his Error in asserting that Men's Souls were changed into Demons,
and these again into Men's Souls, as in Lib. (...).
namely his (...), or freewil, his Pre-existence of Souls, etc.

1. The Pelagian Errors came from Origin. Origin the Founder of Pelagianisme.
Jansenius, August. De Haeres. Pelagian, Tom. 1. l. 6. c. 13, etc. gives us a
particular and large account, how all the Pelagian Dogmes were formed out of
Origen's Philosophic Contemplations. (1) The Pelagians (says he) were severely
reprehended by Augustine for making Indifference to Good and Evil, with the
exclusion of Necessity as to one part, essential to the liberty of the will in
every state. For this is the most principal basis of the whole Pelagian
structure; which Origin entirely delivered: For he was so far fond of this
Philosophic liberty, and a Patron of this indifference to Good and Evil, as
that he decreed man without this was to be reckoned among Brutes and Stones.
Hear Origin discoursing of this liberty, Lib. 1. (...), C. 5. And by
consequence it is from us, and in our motions, that we are blessed or holy,
etc. See Jans. p. 150. (2) Origin everywhere inculcates and cries up the
sufficience of Natures Law to live well. As Lib. 2. in Romans Jans. c. 14. p. 151.
(3) Touching Grace and its Merit, the very error of Pelagius and the
Massilienses is delivered by Origin; as also touching the perfection of
Justice, and (...). As l. 4. in Romans And in his Books (...), his scope is to
show, That the Providence of God does govern immortal souls according to the
merits of each, as Jansen. c. 15. p. 152. (4) Origin, as Pelagius, utterly
overthrows Election, Predestination, and Vocation according to the purpose of
God. Jans. c. 16. p. 152. (5) All the Glosses of Scriptures touching Original
sin and Grace, which the Pelagians abuse, yea the whole systeme of Pelagian
Errors Origin preformed, as it sufficiently appears by his Comments on the
Epistle to the Romans, specially on Chapter 5. and his Books (...). Jansen. c. 17.
p. 153. gives this as the root of al Origen's Errors, namely the Ubertie and
Fecunditie of his Wit too much immersed in vain Philosophy, as hereafter,. 10.
and C. 2. Sect. 1.. 4.

2. Origin gave also a great foundation and improvement to 'the Arian Heresy.
(1) By asserting that (...), the Word, Arianism from Origin.
Joh. 1.1. is taken only Metaphorically, and Ideally, according to the Platonic
mode, as in what immediately follows. 9. (2) He held also, That the Son of God
saw not the Father, because he was a creature made, not borne the Son of God:
that the Son, who is the Image of the Invisible God, compared with the Father,
was not Truth, i.e. True God. That God the Father was an incomprehensible
Light; but Christ, if compared with the Father, was a very poor splendour, which
yet with us, by reason of our imbecillitie, may seem very great. That the Son
was not Bonitie it self, but a certain air or image of Bonitie, so that he
could not be termed absolutely good, but only with an additament, A good
Pastor, or the like. As Hieronym. Epist. ad Avitum. (3) He said also, That the
Holy Spirit was the third in Dignity and honor after the Father and Son, yea
inferior to the Son, as Hicronym. ad Avitum. Who also in Epist. ad Pammachium,
says, That he spoke il of the Son, but worse of the Holy Spirit. (4) He held,
That the Father contained althings, the Son was only in Rational Creatures, and
the Holy Spirit only in Believers, as Athanasius, Quaest. 71. ad Antiochum,
relates. These notions about the Trimtie he imbibed from that Platonic
Philosophy then taught in the Schole of Alexandria, wherein he was instructed;
which acknowleged a (...), Trinity; namely, [1] (...), the Father; whom they
made to be (...), the supreme Being. [2] (...), the Mind, or (...), the Reason;
whom they made inferior to the first. And [3] (...), the mundane Spirit; which
they made inferior to both the former. And hence Origin traduced his Trinity,
which gave the original Exemplar to Arianisme. Whence Epiphanius, in Epist. ad
Joannem Hierosolymitanum, calls Origin, the Father of Arius: and Hieronymus
Epist. ad Pammachium, styles him, the Ocean and Fountain of Arius. And
Socrates, l. 4. c. 21. with others, related, that the Arians frequently used
Testimonies taken out of Origen's Books. See P. 4. B. 2. C. 6.. 4.

3. Origin by his Platonic Philosophemes, Poperic from Origin.
gave a great advance to the whole Systeme of Papisme, or Antichristianisme.
(1) He gave the first lines to al Mystic Theology, by turning al Scriptures,
even the most plain into Allegories, according to the Platonic mode, of which
more hereafter, Chap. 2 Sect. 1.. 1. (2) He was the first Founder of Monastic
Life, Abstinences, and Austerities. [1] He emaseulated himself, i.e.
extinguished virilitie, thereby to preserve Chastity. [2] He understood those
Precepts of our Lord, against having two coats, shoes, and making provision
for the morrow, in a literal sense, as belonging to al Christians; and thence
affected voluntary Poverty, as the Monks of Egypt his Successors. [3] He
abstained from necessary food, as the Pythagoreans, and Popish Monks; whereby
he endangered his health. [4] He affected superstitiose sanctity and
severities, abstaining from necessary sleep, lying on the ground, etc. as
Monks. (3) He held human merits, and justisication by works, placing Man's
Satisfactions, Tears, Contrition, and other good works, as the causes of
Remission of Sins. So in his Hom. 24. on Numbers, and 24, and 23, on Joshua,
and Hom. 1. in Ezech. (4) He asserted, with the Papists, Perfection in this
life, namely, that Saints may extinguish al tho foam of sin in this life, and
so satisfy the Law. Of which see Lib. 1. in Job, Hom. 8. and Hieron. ad
Ctesiph. advers. Pelagianos. (5) He was the first that introduced Purgatory,
from the Platonic Schole at Alexandria, into the Church of God. Plato's notions
of Purgatory see in what follows, Chap. 2. S. 3.. 11. And Origin in imitation
hereof held, That some sins were purged out here, but others passed with us
into the next life, where they were by the torment of sire purged out. Of which
see his Hom. 8. in Leviticus. Hom. 2, and 3. in Psalm. and Hom. 14. in Jeremie.

4. There were many other great Errors asserted and introduced by Origin, Other
Errors of Origin.
from that Platonic Schole at Alexandria, and its corrupt Infusions. As (1) he
held the pre-existence of Souls. Thus Plato in his Timaeus, and elsewhere he
says, Thut al Souls were produced at once, and distributed into the Stars,
etc. So Nicephorus, lib. 5. c. 23. August. lib. 2. de Civit. Dei. c. 23. as
Epiphanius, Hieronymus and Suidas relate, that Origin held, Human souls to have
been before bodies, and that for their sins they were chained to bodies: which
was a great Philosopheme among the Platonistes. (2) Hieronymus, Epist. ad
Avitum, and Apol. 2. adversus Ruffinum, assures us, that he held, in imitation
of Pythagoras and Plato, (...), or the Transmigration of Souls from one Body
into another. (3) He held, That the Devils and souls of the wicked should be at
last saved, and that after long punishments they should be associated to the
good Angels. Thus (...), l. 1. c. 6, 8. Hom. 9. in Jerem. which also is related
by Theophilus, Epiphanius, Hieronymus and Augustinus. So lib. 2. contra Celsum,
he says, That the soul of Christ divested of its body converted many souls.
(4) He denied the Resurrection of the flesh, affirming, that our Bodies after
the Resurrection should be round, aereous, and not of the same substance they
now are. Thus de Resurrect. l. 4. and Expos. in Psalm. 1. as Hieron. ad
Pammachium.

How many and great the Errors of Origin were, which he imbibed from the
Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophic in the Alexandrine Schole, is more fully
explicated by Hieronymus, in Epistolis ad Avitum, and Pammachium, and Oceanum,
Tom. 2. Oper. p. 190. Also in Apolog. adversus Ruffinum. These his Venomous
Errors began first to be espoused by the Monks of Egypt, who drank in the
same with much greediness, and diffused them throughout the whole mass of
their Mystic Theology, which gave great contestes among the Churches of those
times, as Baronius has well observed on the year 256. Alexander, Eusebius,
Didymus, and others, studiosely endeavored the defense of Origin; but
Methodius, Eustachius, Apollinarius, Anastasius, Theophilus, Hieronymus,
Athanasius, Augustinus, and many other of the Fathers; and more particularly
the Constantinopolitan Council, An. 551. condemned Origin of many Pestilential
and prodigiose Errors, imbibed from Ethnic Philosophers. Cluverus in Apocalypse.
Tom. 2. p. 315, etc. applies that character, Rev. 8.10, 11. Rev. 8.10, 11.
And there fell a great Star from Heaven, burning as it were a lamp, etc. unto
Origin; who, as Severus Sulpitius observes, in what he did well came short of
none after the Apostles; but in what he erred, none was worse. That this Text,
Revel. 8.10, 11. points out Origin, Cluverus proves, (1) from the time of this
third Trumpet, which answers exactly to Origin. (2) From the several parts of
the character: [1] He burned as a lamp, which notes his spiritual gifts, as
Mat. 5.15. Joh. 5.35. [2] Yet he fell from Heaven; i. e. from his spiritual
celestial Light, into miserable terrene darknesses of Ethnic Philosophy. [3]
He fell upon the third part of the rivers and fountains of waters; i.e. on the
People and Ecclesiastic Assemblies, which were corrupted by him. [4] And his
name was wormwood, namely by reason of the extreme bitterness of his Dogmes
and superstitiose severities.

But to conclude Origen's Character, the original springs of these his
monstrose Errors seem these. (1) The natural Luxuriance of his exorbitant
fantasy, which recreated it self in the Allegoric mode of the Platonistes.
(2) His despising the simplicity of the Scriptures, and Christian Theology.
(3) His too great confidence in his own parts, and presuming himself to be
wiser than others. (4) His affectation of new Terms and Modes of interpreting
Scripture. (5) But most of al his insolent abuse of Divine Mysteries and
Truths, by reducing the same to Platonic Philosophemes. Hence basil, Hom. 3.
Hexaem. severely redargues Origen's Allegoric Mode of Theologising: and
elsewhere he terms it, (...), a fabulose figment. Greg. Nazianzen, Orat. 42.
styles Origen's way of commenting (...), worthy of a conjector of Dreams, in
allusion to the (...) of Artemidorus, and Apollonius Attalus, as before, L. 1.
C. 3.. 8. Greg. Nyssenus, in Cant. Praesat. and l. de ho. opat. c. 18. disputes
sharply against the Deliries or sick Dreams of Origin. Cyril Alexandrin. in
Act. Council. C P. stigmatiseth Origin with the character of Antichrist: (...),
Origin has started up in the midst of the true Church, as the Abomination of
Desolation. Epiphanius, in haeres. 64. has writ severely against Origen's
Errors, whom he terms (...), self-willed sophist, or one tenacious of his own
sentiments in wisdom. And he terms his Doctrine, (...), Absurdity and
perniciose Doctrine in many parts of says, etc. Whence the Greek Theologues in
the fifth Oecumenic Council anathematised him for his Errors. Of which see
more, Vincentius Lyrinensis, lib. advers. Haeres. c. 23. How much these
Primitive Churches were infested by Errors imbibed from Ethnic Philosophy,
specially those of Origin and the Schole of Alexandria, has been well observed
by that great French Divine Morelius, in his Discipline de l' Eglise, live. 2.
chap. 6. page 101. Human Philosophy has corrupted many, who desirous to mix
it with the Gospel, disfigured the Doctrine thereof, and at length made of it a
pure Human Philosophy. This happened not al at once, but by little and little,
until it came to darken Grace. For Origin endeavoring to exhort men to perform
works worthy of their Vocation, extolled good works without measure: and the
more to awaken men hereto, he gave them to understand, that these good works
were in their power and from their Free Will. Which opinion opened the door to
the Pelagians. -- In general the ignorance of al Science has produced great
evils: but yet the greatest part have had their fource from Reason, Human
opinion, and Philosophy; which for this reason Tertullian rejected and
banished from the Church, as being the mistress of Heresies. Again, live. 3.
chap. 14. page 260. Morelius adds, That Philosophy and Curiosity corrupted
this noble Schole of Alexandria, and by consequent the Church Which ought
therefore to be carefully avoided; because these two evils are natural to
Scholars, who not contenting themselves with the simplicity of the Gospel, are
ambitiose to beautify it with human ornaments of Eloquence and Philosophy;
and from a rage to get knowledge would fain mount up higher than their very
Doctors.

We find this mystery of iniquity excellently laid open by Owen, Theolog.
lib. 6. cap. 8. where he shows us, how this Pagan Philosophy at first crept in
amongst the Fathers, to the great prejudice of Christian Theology. The sacred
Chorus (says he) of the Apostles being removed, Satan again attemted the
corrupting of Evangelic Truth, and that not without success. For what he could
not accomplish by open assault, he gradually obtained in defense of the Truth.
For after the Apostles were removed, the Patronage of Truth came into the hands
of Learned men. Of this number were Clemens, Origin, etc. whom it sufficed not
to use the Word and Spirit of God against the enemies of Truth, but they were
pleased to engage also with reasons drawn from secular learning. And it
happened in progress of time, that these Philosophic arguments, which these
learned men used in the defense of Truth, yea the very terms and words, were
estimed as necessary parts of Religion. But this Philosophic fatal evil did in
a more particular manner infect the Church after the Peripatetic Philosophy,
(which for some ages had lain neglected) began to please Students in good
literature. For this Philosophy of Aristotle being revived and adorned by the
Mahumedan Arabians, and thence sucked in by the Scholemen, they utterly
abrogated the Evangelic Theology. And as many of the Fathers thus corrupted
the Doctrine of the Gospel by Philosophic Notions and Infusions; so in like
manner the Worship of the Gospel was by their assuming Philosophic terms and
rites greatly corrupted. Pythagoras, Plato, and other of the Philosophers had,
in imitation of the Jewish Church, their (...), etc. And the Greek Fathers in
imitation of these Philosophic Rites, call their Sacraments and other Mysteries
by the same Names; yea assume many of the same Rites to clothe Christ's
Mysteries withal. Thus the spurious Dionysius Areopagita calls the Eucharist,
(...). And Casaub. Exer. 16. c. 43. assures us, Of these Teletae, see Court of
the Gentil. par. 1. B. 2. c. 9.. 10.
that when the first Christians call their Sacraments Teletas, etc. these and
the like Names were transferred from the Sacreds of the Pagans. The Grecians
called the Deification of the Heroes (...). Hence among the Fathers, specially
such as were Popishly inclined, (...), and (...) is attributed to Saints. But
of this more fully in what follows of Antichristian Rites, Chapter 2. S. 3.. 11.

. 9. But to descend to particulars. 1. Al those hell bred, 1. The Samosatenus
and A^ian Heresy from Pagan Philosophy.
black Errors, which struck at the Deity of Christ, had their foundation in
Pagan Philosophy. Such were the opinions of Samosatemus, Arius, etc. As for
the Heresy of Samosatenus and its traduction from Pagan Philosophy, we find a
good account in Melancthon, Chron. lib. 3. of the state of the Church under
Valerius and Aurelianus: Paulus Samosatenus, (says he) who fell upon the
blasphemy of Ebion and Cerinthus, had this occasion for his Errors: Plotinus
the Philosopher (who was Scholar to Ammonius) reading in the Schole of
Alexandria, had mingled with his Philosophy Allegories touching the Eternal
Word. And in as much as there were many debates about these things from the
writings of the Ancients, Paulus Samosatenus drew thence his impostures, and
maintained, that Jesus Christ was only man, and that by (...), the word, Joh.
1.1. We may not understand any person subsistent, but the declaration and word
of promise. These Reveries were received with much applaudissement by curiose
spirits, and particularly by Zenobia Queen of Arabia and Dame of Antioch: by
whose means P. Samosatenus was maintained secure for ten years space. This
Heresy of Samosatenus denying the Divinity of Christ was revived by Arius,
and that from the very same foundation of Platonic Philosophy, yea in the very
same Schole of Alexandria. This is well explicated by Aquinas, Sum. part. 1. Q.
32. A. 1. We find, says he, in the Books of the Platonistes, That in the
beginning the Word was: by which Word they understood not a person in the
Trinity, but an Ideal Reason, by which God made al things -- whence sprang the
Error of Origin, and Arius, who followed the Platonistes herein. So again in
what follows, Q. 34. Art. 1. Aquinas assures us, That Origin laid the
foundation of Arianisme, by affirming, That the Word in Divine 'maters,
signified only Metaphorically, not properly. That Arius also had his Infusions
from the Platonistes in this Schole of Alexandria is evident: For Arius was a
Presbyter in this Church, and Student in this Schole, where the Pythagorcan and
Platonic Philosophy was at this time wholly in request, (for Aristotle came
not in play til afterward) which the learned Christians Clemens Alexandrinus,
Origin, etc. made use of as a medium to illustrate and prove the great
mysteries of Faith touching the Divine (...), word, mentioned, Joh. 1.1. hoping
by such symbolisings, and claiming kindred with these Philosophic notions and
traditions (originally Jewish) touching the Platonic (...), they might gain
very much credit and interest amongst these Platonic Sophistes. Hence these
learned Fathers Clemens and Origin made it their business to lay open the
cognation betwixt Pagan Philosophy and the Mysteries of the Gospel; proving,
that Philosophy was but a reflexe beam, or broken derivation and tradition of
Sacred Revelation. Which design and undertaking had been of excellent use, had
these learned Fathers withal discovered the Vanity and Corruptions of Pagan
Philosophy as then constituted: but this they were so far from undertaking, as
that they assumed a considerable part of the Pythagorean and Platonic
Philosophy, both Matter and Form, and mixed it with their Sacred Theology;
and so out of al framed an Image like that of Nebuchadnezar, Dan. 2.31, 32. And
amongst other Platonic Mysteries, that of (...), the word, on which Ammonius
and Plotinus had much commented, was taken and applied to the Divine (...),
Word, explicated by John; which gave occasion and foundation to many
Philosophic debates and contestes in the Schole and Church of Alexandria; as
also to the Heresy of Arius, as it had done to that of Samosetanus before.
This is well taken notice of by that great French Reformer Morelius, Discipl.
live. 2. chap. 4. page 87, 88. It has been the custom (says he) to use
Disputes in many places, whence many inconveniences may follow: For such
Disputes tend only to awaken and discover the spirit, whence follows much
presumtion and ostentation, and the starting of high and curiose Questions;
which may afterward trouble the Church. The Arian Heresy had its rise from the
particular conferences of learned men in the city of Alexandria. Indeed
Constantine sharply reprehended these curiose Disputes, etc. The same may be
applied to the Photinian Heresy, which was the same with the Arian and
Samosatenan. Of which see Melanchton, Lib. 3. of the Churches conflict after
Constantine. We have before touched on this ( Chap. 3.. 2, 3. of Book 1.) out
of Justinian, who acquaintes us, that these Philosophic Notions about the
Platonic (...), which supposed a real difference in nature betwixt the (...),
the Father, (...), the Word, and (...), the Soul of the World, gave occasion to
the Arian Heresy. See Justinian in 1 John 1.1. and Origen's influence on
Arianisme in what precedes,. 8.

. 10. Another great fundamental Error, which received spirit and life from
Pagan Philosophy, is Pelagianisme; 2. Pagan Philosophy the cause of
Pelagianisme.
which strikes diametrically at the free efficacious Grace of Christ, (as
Arianisme at his Divinity) and contains in it much of the spirit of
Antichrist. We have before in what was laid down touching the Vanity of Pagan
Ethics, B. 1. C. 2.. 4. proved, that the Philosophers generally asserted a
Moral power, or Free will, in all men to perform virtuose actions. They had
their (...), right Reason; their (...), good nature; (...), free will; (...),
things in our power, and seeds of virtue, which they made the spring of al
their good works. These notions the Greek Fathers, specially Origin, (who was
bred up amongst the Philosophers in the Schole of Alexandria) sucked in with
too much greediness, who made them the foundation of his Exhortations to good
works, which he cried up without end or measure; and to awaken Christians more
effectually hereto, he took up this Philosophic principe, That it was in the
power of men's free will to perform the same. This laid the foundation for the
Pelagian Heresy, as we have before observed out of Morelius, and we find this
excellently opened to us by Jansenius, Origin laid the foundation for
Pelagianisme.
in his Augustinus, Tom. 1. lib. 6 cap. 13, etc. Amongst al (says he) that
preceded Pelagius, I find no more skilful Architect of the Pelagian Heresy
than Origin; who gave origin to many Heresies, which for some ages after his
death infested the Church; specially by his Books, (...). But there was none
that he did more exactly form than the Pelagian. Neither will you easily find
any Dogme, one excepted, used by Pelagius, or Julianus, against the Church, or
any interpretation of Scripture favoring that Heresy, which Origin did not
form to their hands: so that sometimes they use the very words of Origin
against the truth; which, because it may seem incredible to some, I will a
little more fully demonstrate. Which he does, (1) From Origen's asserting an
Indifference of Free will. (2) From his supposing the Law of Nature sufficient
to guide us to live well, etc. (3) From his pleading for Merits, and perfect
Righteousness, and (...). (4) From his overthrowing the Doctrine of free
Election, Predestination, etc. (5) From his denying or lessening Original Sin
and Grace, as it appears by his Commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans,
specially on Chap. 5. as also his Book (...). And then he adds cap. 18. that
the whole of this Heresy had its foundation in the Pythagorean, Stoic, and
Peripatetic Philosophy. He also acquaints that the Origenists, or Monks that
followed Origin and his Doctrine in Egypt and Palestine, aspiring after a
Monkish Perfection and Religiose life embraced these Infusions of Origin, from
whom the Massilienses and Pelagians traduced their Heresy. Hieronymus Adversus
Pelag. ad Ctesiphontem, assures us, That the Doctrine of Pelagius was but a
branch of Origen's. And the same Hieronymus, Apolog. 1. adversus Ruffin. says
that Origin held, That God chose men, not that they might be holy, but for
their foreseen sanctity and holiness: which made way for that great Pelagian
Error, touching Election from the prevision of good Works. More touching the
Traduction of Pelagianisme from Origen's Dogmes, see what precedes. 8.

That Philosophy was the cause of Pelagianisme also, Godeau, that great French
Historian in the Life of Augustine, Live. 2. Chap. 2. p. 200. demonstrates thus,
Nevertheless the Philosophy of Aristotle and Zeno seems to have contributed
much to Pelagianisme. And if Tertullian has named the Philosophers the
Patriarchs of Heretics, that is particularly true in regard of the Pelagians;
who, if we may so speak, are descended in a direct line. For the first Error
of Pelagius was touching the perfection of justice and impeccabilitie, which he
held a man might attain to in this life. Which is the same with the Apathie, or
the exemtion from passions; which the Stoics attributed to their wise man. And
albeit Aristotle and the New Academics held, That a wise man is capable of
passions, but virtue consistes in the moderation of them; yet both one and
the other agreed in this, That virtue came from man, not from God. And Cicero
explicating their Doctrine, says, Who ever gave God thanks for being a good
man? And Seneca says, There is a good, which is the cause of a blessed life,
namely to confide in a man's self. Lo, the Abregement of the Pelagian Doctrine!
-- Philosophy furnished the Pelagians not only with Materials to build their
Forteresse against the Church, but also with Arms to defend it. And Augustine
does reproach Julian, with the subtilities of Logic, which he had learned, etc.
As Vanity and Pride is the character of Human Philosophy, so also of the
Pelagian Heresy; and it is its specify difference: For if a man examine al
its propositions, he shall find in them a spirit of pride in the most insolent
degree. -- We have a secret desire of Independence which is graven on the very
fund of our corrupt nature. Thence one being asked why Pelagianisme did spring
up in all Ages, answered, because there were Pelagianae sibrae, certain Pelagian
sibres, or small venes of Pelagianisme in the hearts of al.

Jansenius likewise tells us, Tom. 1. lib. 7. cap. 17. That the Greek Fathers,
out of too great opinion of Origin and his Commentaries, sucked in from him the
same opinions about Free Will; which Chrysostom, Oecumenius and Theophylact
were too guilty of Origen's opinion for Free Will see in his Philocalia, cap.
21, 23, 25, 26, etc. This may serve as a reason why Pelagius found so much
favor from the Greek Fathers in the Council of Dispolis, An. 415. That Pelagius
himself received much of his Heresy from these Origenistic Monks seated in
Egypt, with whom he had conversation whilst in those parts, may hereafter
appear, when we come to treat more fully of Pelagianisme revived by the
Scholemen. It suffices at present to show, what foundation was laid for the
Pelagian Heresy by the Greek Fathers, specially those of the Alexandrine
Schole; who out of a vain design to gain reputation to the Christian Theology
contempered some of the purer and more reformed parts of the Pythagorean and
Platonic Philosophy therewith, to the great prejudice, yea corruption thereof,
which Antichrist afterward makes use of for the exaltation of his throne, and
introduction of his Mystical, Scholastic, Canonic Theology, as it follows, C.
2. S. 1.. 1, etc.

But to give a Summarie account of the rise and progress of Pelagian Dogmes,
Bradwardine in his Preface to his never-enough to be admired Book De Causa Dei,
against the Pelagians, A Summarie of Pelagianisme.
tells us, that the lapsed Angels were the first Founders of this Sect, who
depending on their mutable Free Will, though then Morally holy, fell from their
Dependence on Divine Grace, into that miserable servitude of sin they are now
chained under. The same Error Augustine, Aquinas, and other Antipelagian
Scholemen make to be the cause of Adam's Fall. And if his Moral Free Will when
void of Sin could not preserve him from falling into sin and misery, when he
depended thereon, how is it possible that corrupt Free Will in his lapsed
posterity should raise them up to a state of Union and Communion with God,
from whom they are now, by reason of the spiritual death and servitude of Sin,
so far distant? Bradwardine also makes Pelagianisme to have been avouched and
owned by Cain, Nimrod, Nebuchadnezar, and other forerunners of Antichrist. That
it was the (...) of the Pharisees is most evident both from Sacred Scriptures,
as Luk 18.9, 11. and elsewhere, as also by the general consent of such as have
written of the Pharisees, Drusius, etc. In the Primitive Christian Churches
this Pelagian Infusion was diffused among the Gnostics, and other legal carnal
Christians, even in the Apostles days; as seems evident by their Epistles,
which elsewhere, if the Lord please, we shall make apparent. But the principal
founder of this Pelagian Placite in the Primitive times was Origin, as
Jansenius has incomparably well demonstrated in his History of Pelagianisme.
From Origin and his Sectators the Monks of Egypt, Pelagius, the reproach of
our ancient Britains, imbibed his venomous Infusions, which proved the vital
spirits of Antichrist that man of sin.

To give check and confusion to these proud sentiments of that Pelagian
Antichristian party God raised up Augustine for the succur of his poor bleeding
Church, Augustin's Zele against Pelagianisme.
against the most pestiferous Heresy that ever infested it. He was a person of
prodigiose natural acumen and Capacity: he had an ample vast soul, filled with
Divine Lights and Heats: he was indeed the Restaurator of the ancient Faith in
this point, and Doctor of Grace, being indeed an infatigable and invincible
champion of Free Grace against Free Will: He penetrated all the secrets of the
Pelagians, and opened their Vanity: he entered by the conduct of Gods Spirit
into the very bowels of corrupt Nature, and anatomised al its subtle Recesses
and Diverticules: He descended into the darknesses of the blind mind, and
discovered its venomous influences on human Acts: He also manifested the
feeblesses and impotence of the corrupt Will as to what is spiritually good: He
made a perfect Anatomy of the old Adam, dissecting the small fibers thereof.
And this Pelagian Heresy, which may well be styled the Heresy of corrupt
Nature, the daughter and mother of Pride, did but the more inflame his zele for
Divine Grace, and increase his profound Humility: and whereas the pride of
man's spirit takes great satisfaction in such flesh-pleasing notions, his
incomparable Humility led him to a more implacable enmity against them: and
being fortified with the armor of Divine Light and Grace, he confounded the
Fautors of Pelagianisme, and Patrones of corrupt Free Will, discovered their
puerile ignorant Sophismes, and impudent Blasphemies; as also contemned their
reproaches and calumnies. He explicated his Hypotheses with claritie, and
demonstrated them with invincible force, specially in his two last pieces;
those he writ against the Semi-pelagians, of the Predestination of Saints, and
of the gift of Perseverance. We have an incomparable Systeme of al his choifest
sentiments about Grace collected by that great Patron of Free Grace, and
Impugnator of Free Will, Jansenius, in his Augustinus; where also we find an
excellent account of Augustin's Life, and Zele against the Pelagians: the like
in Godeau, La Vie de St. Augustine. And because some of late have thought
Augustine too warm and passionate in his Zele against the Pelagians, I shall
give an abbreviate Idea or character of his spirit and zele for God, which is
more copiosely and lively delineated by Godeau, that great French Historian, in
the forementioned History of Augustin's Life. Augustine was a wonder of nature
for Parts, and a miracle of Grace for Piety. It were easy to find admirable
Parallels between those two great men, Paul and Augustine, which Godeau calls the
ancient and new Apostle of Jesus Christ. Augustine observed in Paul an admirable
Fidelity, a celeste Eloquence, which was by so much the more capable to
prevail, by how much the less human. He also observed in him a singular
adresse to manage Spirits, an incomparable claritie to explicate Mysteries, a
singular prudence to distribute Divine Verities according to the capacity of
his Disciples, a mavelous judgment in his counsels, a profound intelligence
to discover the secrets of men's hearts; a perfect charity for sinners, and yet
an amorous vehemence against Sin. Libertines were constrained to admire in
Augustine an exemple, which they were not willing to imitate. He studied more to
become pious than learned, and to purify his heart from carnal Affections,
than to enrich his Understanding with new Sciences. He thought he ought to grow
in virtue according to the measure he grew in dignity. He was the Master of al
by his Doctrine and Exemples; but by his Humility, charitable and prudent
Conduct, the Servant of al. The Son of God chose him to defend the principal
foundation of Christian Religion. Other Doctors had particular lights for the
defending diverse Truths, but he had extraordinary claritie for the defense of
the prime Truth and Grace. If it be the nature of Science to pusse up, then one
might think such an eminent Science as Augustine had should greatly puff him
up; but the malignitie of Science was never so perfectly extinguished as in
him: and he is yet more admirable for the profunditie of his Humility, than
for the sublimitie of his Doctrine: he searched not for the praise of men. We
might copy out al Augustin's Books, if we would report all the humble
Sentiments which he has couched touching himself, in a manner that is not
affected, and wherein one cannot accuse him, that he searched for Glory in a
seeming contemt thereof; he had no difficulty to confess his ignorance in
many things, which men believed he could instruct others in. He thus speaks: I
profess I am of the number of those which write in profiting, and profit in
writing. With what Sentiments of grief, with what sincerity, with what
simplicity, with what diligence, with what confusion does he in his
Confessions speak of the Errors of his spirit, of his foolish imaginations, of
his extravagant thoughts of Divine Verities? with what freedom does he open
his heart, that we may read all the disorders of his passions? we may call these
Confessions of his the triumph of Grace. Augustine had in his house an Assembly
of Ministers with whom he lived in commun; he forgot nothing to bring them to
perfection; he had for all a love truly Paternal: he counseled them in their
douts, supported them in their infirmities, fortified them in their seeblesses,
accommodated himself to their ignorances. He had a great natural tenderness of
love toward his friends, which Grace formed into a Divine love.

After Augustine, when Pelagianisme, by the growth of Antichristianisme was come
to a perfect stature, God raised up many great Reformers, specially Bradwardine
and Wiclef, to oppose the same. The Jansenistes Zele against Pelagianisme.
Many also among the Dominicans, as Aquinas, Ariminensis, Alvarez, etc. have
put forth great efforts to pull down this Idol of Pelagianisme. But none have
been more bold and successeful in the Roman Church, for the overthrowing this
proud Pelagian Idol, than pious and great Corn. Jansenius, and his Sectators;
whereof we have given a large relation in our Idea of Jansenisme. And we shall
here only add, that it is, or ought to be the great wonder of pious souls,
that in this Age, wherein so many Professors of the Reformed Religion have
turned their backs on the Doctrine of Free Grace, and imbibed so many Pelagian
Infusions, which are the very vital spirits and heart of Antichristianisme, God
has raised up, even in the bosom of Antichrist, Jansenius and his Sectators,
who, in vindication of Augustin's Doctrine, have approved themselves such stout
Champions and Assertors of Free Grace, against al Pelagian Dogmes. O! what
matter of Admiration will this be unto al Eternity?

SECT. I. Antichrist's Mystic and Scholastic Theology from Ethnic Philosophic.
. 1. WE have shown the sad and evil Effects of Pagan Philosophy in reference
to the Pagans themselves, the Jews, and the Primitive Christians; we now
proceed to demonstrate its perniciose causalitie and influence as to Antichrist
his hel-bred Doctrine and Discipline. And for our more Methodic procedure
herein we shall reduce the whole of Antichristianisme to these three Heads: (1)
Mystic Theology; (2) Scholastic Theology; 1. The Monks drew Mystic Divinity
from Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy in the Alexandrine Schole. 1 Timothy 4.3.
(3) Canonic Theology. (1) As for Antichrist's Mystic Theology, it was the
figment of the superstitiose Monks, who were the firstborn sons of this Man
of Sin, and the main Pillars of his Throne, according to that part of his
character, 1 Timothy 4.3. (...), forbidding to marie. It Is true, there were some
devote Christians, who in time of persecution chose a Monastic or solitary
life; but the imposing hereof under certain Rules, yea Vows, and that as a more
perfect state of Religion, proceeded from the spirit of Antichrist. Now these
superstitiose Monks were first seated in Egypt at Alexandria; where they
drank in the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy, and therewith many
Philosophic superstitions. And to treat a little more distinctly of the Origin
of these Monks, the first borne sons of Antichrist, and their Mystic
Theology, we are to take a brief view of the Schole of Alexandria, and its
Constitution when Monastic Life and Theology was introduced into the Primitive
Churches. This Schole of Alexandria, founded by Ptolomeus Philadelphus, was
indeed the seat of al Philosophy, yea the eye of the world as to learning, at
this time when Monastic Life and Theology crept into the Church, as we have
largely demonstrated, Court Gent. P. 2. B. 3. C. 4.. 4, etc. The Philosophy
that most flourished in this Alexandrine Schole at this time was Pythagorean
and Platonic: and the principal Professors thereof were the Egypt an Priests,
who were incorporated into Colleges, or Convents, affecting a Monastic Life and
Severities, in imitation of the Essenes among the Jews; who, in the times of
the Babylonian and subsequent Persecutions under Antiochus, etc. affected a
Monastic solitary life, and severe Discipline, to preserve the purity of
their Consciences and Religion, as we have shown Philos. General. P. 1. l. 1.
c. 1.. 11. Hence, I say, both the Pythagoreans and Egyptian Priests traduced
their Monastic Life and Discipline: of which see Philosoph. General. p. 1. l.
1. c. 2. S. 7. also l. 2. c. 3.. 4. and Court Gent. P. 2. B. 2. c. 6.. 9. Now
that the whole of Antichrist's Monks, their original Constitution, and
Discipline, and Mystic Theology, was but a superstitiose Imitamen of the
Egyptian and Pythagorean Monastic Life and Philosophy, 1. Antichristian Monks
an Imitamen of Egyptian and Pythagorean Colleges.
will be most evident by the subsequent Parallels.

1. As to the origin of these Antichristian Monks, their several Orders and
Rules, they were indeed al but superstitiose Imitamens, or Apes of Pagan Monks
and Discipline. We have before P. 2. Book 2. C. 6.. 9. shown how the
Pythagoreans, in imitation of the Jewish Schools and Essenes, affected a
Collegiate Monastic life, and Discipline. And that the whole of Antichristian
Monachisme was but a reflexe Idea or Imitamen of that Pythagoraen Constitution,
learned Bochart in his Treatise against Veron, part 3. chap. 25.. 4. Art. 1.
proves at large: showing, how this injunction of Celibat and Monastic life was
one great part of the Doctrine of Demons, 1 Timothy 4.1, 3. which was one of the
superstitions Pythagoras brought out of Egypt into Greece; for he forbad Marriage
to those of his Sect, and erected a Cloistre of Virgins or Nuns, etc. then he
proves, how that this institution of Celibat was by Christ's time established
almost throughout the Pagan World. But to come to Particulars: (1) The
Pythagorean Monks, in order to their more regular Collegiate life, entered into
a most strict confederation or covenant to walk by the same commun Rule,
enjoined by their Master Pythagoras, as Court Gent. P. 2. B. 2. c. 6.. 6. Thus
also the Egyptian Priests, as Philos. Gener. P. 1. l. 1. c. 2. S. 7.. 1. parag.
11. The same do the Antichristian Monks, who make a Vow to walk regularly
according to the Rule of their Founder: whence they are called Regulars, in
opposition to the Secular Priests. (2) Had the Pythagoreans in their College
Novices and Perfect? So have the Antichristian Monks. (3) Did the Pythagoreans
separate themselves and despise all that were not of their Order, as (...),
imperfect and uninitiate? So do these Monastic Sons of Antichrist, etc. (4) Did
the Pythagoreans affect a superstitiose silence? so do these Monks; having
this Motto over their doors, Silentium, silence. (5) The Pythagoreans enjoyed
althings in commun; thence their College was called (...), a community. The
same do Antichrists Monks in their Convents, which they call by the same name,
Caenobium. (6) Had the Pythagoreans their Rules for abstinence from flesh, etc?
Thus also the Egyptian Priests gloried much in their abstinences from flesh,
etc. as Philos. Gener. p. 1. l. 1. c. 2. S. 7.. 1. parag. 3. And have not
Antichrists Monks the same Abstinences? are not the Carthusians and
Praemonstrantes under a prohibition from ever eating flesh, according to their
character, Col. 2.21. 1 Timothy 4.3? (7) The Pythagorean Collegiates had their
white distinctive garments: so have these sons of Antichrist the like
distinctive Garments or Vestments, which Constantin styles (...), the Garment
of darkness. (8) Did the Pythagoreans greatly reverence their Elders? so do
these sons of Antichrist their Superiors and Elders, calling them, my Father,
etc. (9) Were the Pythagoreans and Egyptian Priests much addicted to devotion
or (...), superstitiose Demon-worship? so are these superstitiose Monks to
their (...), Saint-worship, which exactly answers to the Pythagorean
Demon-worship, as 1 Timothy 4.1. (10) Had the Pythagoreans and Egyptian Priests

superstitiose Monks the very same. (11) The Pythagoreans divided their life
into contemplative and active, etc. So also the Egyptian Priests, as Philosoph.

the manner how these Pythagorean and Egyptian Rites of Monastic Life and
Discipline were introduced first into the Egyptian Churches, and thence into
the Grecian, Roman, and other Churches, we must reflect on what was before
mentioned of Origin, C. 1.. 8. who, in imitation of that Monastic Life, so much
affected by the Pythagoreans, Platonistes, and Egyptian Priests in the Schole
of Alexandria, brought in the like Monastic modes into the Churches of Egypt;
wherein he was followed by his Sectators, the Origenistic Monks of Egypt; from
whom al Antichristian Monastic Life, Rules, Confederations, Orders,
Abstinences, and superstitiose Rites proceeded, as before, also in what follows,

2. To proceed to the Mystic Theology hatched by these Antichristian Monks,
and its production both as to matter and form, The Monks Mystic Theology from
the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy.
in derivation from, and in imitation of the Pythagorean and Platonic
Philosophy. We have already showed, that the Origin of this Mystic Divinity
was laid by the Monks of Alexandria, and other parts in Egypt; the Idea or
platform whereof was given them by Origin, who being brought up in the Schole
of Alexandria under Ammonius, that great Reformed, and as some think Christian
Platonist, was so drencht in Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy, as that he
fills his Commentaries on Scripture with little else save Allegoric and Mystic
Theology, answerable to the Pythagoric and Platonic mode of Philosophising.
Wherein he is followed by his successors the Monks of Alexandria: amongst whom
Origin, by reason of his great parts and acquired learning, was greatly
idolized and imitated; whence they were called Origenists. And that which gave
them great advantage for the spinning out this their Cobweb of Allegoric and
Mystic Divinity, was their solitary Monastic contemplative life, which they
greatly affected, and whereby they being freed from the encumbrances of worldly
affairs, had the more opportunity to broach and perfect their Mystic
contemplations. Thus also the Pythagoreans, Platonistes and Egyptian Priests,
spent a great part of their time in sublime Mystic Contemplations, which made
their Philosophy so Symbolic and Mystic, as Porphyrie, de Abstinent. l. 4.. 6.
p. 149. and Philos. General. p. 1. l. 1. c. 2. S. 7.. 1. paragr. 5. Farther,
that this Mystic Divinity was taken up in Imitation of, and Derivation from
the Pythagorean, Egyptian, and Platonic Philosophy, may appear not only from
the Authors of it, Origin, and his followers, (who were seated at the fountain
of Platonic Philosophy) but also by its essential parts, both matter and form,

or mode. (1) As for the matter of this Monkish Mystic Divinity, it aboundes
with many Philosophic Fables, and lying wonders, answerable to the Mystic
Fables in Pythagoras and Plato's Philosophy. Indeed the whole of Antichrists
Theology is but a mere Philosophic and lying Mystery, as 2 These. 2.9. But yet
no part of Antichristianisme is so stuffed with lying Fables and Demonic
Miracles, as this Mystic Theology, framed by these Antichristian Monks. By
whom were those Legends of fabulose wonders (supposed to be wrought by Saints)
framed, but by these Mystic Divines; and that in imitation of the Pythagorean
wonders wrought by Apollonius Tyanaeus and others of that Sect? Indeed the
whole of this Mystic Monkish Divinity seems to be but a mere Pythagorean and
Platonic Fable: for though the original Idea might be some Divine
Scripture-Mysterie, yet these fabulose Monks mix so many of their own
fantastic allegoric Fables therewith, as that a critical eye can hardly
discern any elements or characters of Divine Truth amidst so many Fables. (2)
Neither is the matter only of this Mystic Theology fabulose, but its form
also; Mystic Theology as to its Form, Pythagorean and Platonic.
answerable to the Mythologic, Symbolic, Allegoric mode of Philosophising so
commun amongst the Pythagoreans and Platonists. How much do these Mystic
Divines glory in their Tropologic, Anagogic, and Allegoric explication of
Scripture? Neither is there any Scripture so plain, literal, or historic, but
they have some Tropologic or Mystic sense for it: witness that of Job 1.14.
where by the Oxen plowing they understand, the people laboring: and by [the
Asses feeding beside them] they understand, the Priests feeding on the peoples
labors. In which Mystic Explication, though most absurd as to the Text, yet we
have more of truth than they ever dreamed of; namely, that al their Monastic
Orders and Antichristian Priests are but so many idle Asses, which feed on and
wax fat by the labors of poor Laics, as they call the people. Indeed this
Monkish Mystic Theology does, in point of Fables and Allegories, seem to
excede either the Jewish Cabala, or the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy,
whence it received its original Ideas. And we need no way dout, but that the
Spirit of God, in laying down such severe Premonitions and Cautions against
giving heed to Fables, had a very great eye upon this fabulose mystic
Divinity, which at first the Gnostics, and since these Monkish Divines, the
firstborn sons of Antichrist, took up in imitation of their Grandfathers,
the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophers. So 1 Timothy 1.4. (...), Philosophic
Fables. 1 Timothy 1.4.

Gnostics. The like 1 Timothy 4.7. where he adds this as one part of these
Doctrines of Demons revived by Antichrist, 1 Timothy 4.7.
that they should revive (...), old Philosophic fables: which these mystic
Monks were greatly guilty of. The like Tit. 1.14. In all which Textes we find
these mystic Divines the Monks fully characterised, as well as the Gnostics: of
which see B. 1. Chap. 4.. 1.

. 2. After the Mystic Theology framed by the Monks, The Origin of the
Schole-men and their Theology from Aristotle.
succeeded the Schole-Divinitie composed by the Scholemen, which received its
origin from the very same fountain of Pagan Philosophy, and tended to the
very same end, namely the confirmation and farther propagation of
Antichristianisme, though the medium and course taken up by the later was quite
different, yea opposite to that used by the former. For the Monks deriving
their Mystic Theology from the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy, made use
of al their fabulose Miracles and lying Wonders, al their allegoric and mystic
Interpretations of Scripture, with all their (...), or Pythagorean Institutes,
Abstinences, Severities, and other pretended Sanctities of their Monastic life,
as medium's to gain credit and authority to Antichrist, their Parent and Lord.
But now the Scholemen, those younger sons of Antichrist, though they had the
same end in their eye, yet they proceeded on a new and different medium or way:
For these vain Sophists traducing their Scholastic Divinity from their
Grandfather Aristotle his Eristic Philosophy, made it their (...), or
business, to maintain Antichrist their Father's Doctrine and Authority by
vain disputations, according to the (...), Contentiose Logic in the Eleatic and
Peripatetic Schools. And to make the demonstration hereof more firm and
evident, we shall a little consider the origin of Scholemen and their
Divinity, its parts essential and integral.

As for the origin of the Schole-Divines, they began to slourish in the
thirteenth Centurie, Scholasticorum apud Graecos Johan. Damascenus, apud
Latinos Petr. Lombard. fuit Pater. Hornius Hist. Philos. l. 6. c. 2.
about the middle thereof; and their chief feat was at Paris, which was then
the eye of Europe for Liberal Sciences and Theology. For Charles the Great
having in the ninth Centurie erected a famous Universitie there, those who had
inclinations to good Literature resorted thither, as to the commun Schole
thereof; specially considering the Inundation of Barbarism and Ignorance in
Italy. But that which rendered this Universitie of Paris more famous was the
College of the Sorbonne, instituted by Robert D. brother of Lewis King of
France, about the year 1270. Here the Scholemen, Albertus Magnus, Hugo the
Cardinal, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, and the rest of that Gang seated
themselves; making it their business to defend the Popes Doctrine and
Authority by their Philosophic distinctions and disputations; wherein they
found at first great opposition from more sober Divines and Professors of the
Universitie at Paris; specially from Gulielmus de sancto Amore, a pious
Reformer, who flourished about the year 1260, and greatly declaimed and writ
against those Schole-Divines their Philosophic Infusions, as that which was
likely to prove perniciose to the Church: wherein indeed he was a true Prophet.
He writ many excellent Treatises against these Schole-Divines, viz. A
Defensorie of the Scripture and Church, against the dangers which hung over the
Universal Church by Hypocrites and false Teachers: also of the perils of the
later times: of the signs of false prophets, etc. Yet notwithstanding the
Schole-men, those great Champions of Antichrist, found so much favor from
Alphonsus Earl of Poictou, another brother of Lewis King of France, as that
he, by threats and terrors, chased away the more zelose Reforming Divines, and
established these Scholastic Doctors in the Sorboune, as it is well observed by
our famous Baleus, de Script. Britan. Cent. 4 cap. 34. where he farther adds
this: And as Cantipratensis has it in his Book of Mystic Bees, Albertus Magnus,
Hugo Cardinalis, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, and others of the same meal did
many and wonderful things at Paris. And Erasnus says, that the Philosophy
which these our Masters afterward used in the Schools had its origin in these
days. Leland says, that in those times Arts degenerated from their purity,
and I know not what sophistic Garrulitie made a noise in the Schole. Thus
Baleus, who also ( cap. 77.) acquaints us, that Arnoldus de Villa Nova, a
famous Physician and Mathematician (who flourished about An. 1300.) opposed in
like manner these Divines; affirming, that they had perfidiously adjoined the
Dreams of the Philosophers to the Scriptures. Franciscus Petrarcha, lib. 1. de
Remed. utriusque fortunae, Dialog. 46. complains of these Scholemen thus: They
fable many things rashly of God and nature; by their airy Sophismes they
circumscribe the most Omnipotent Majesty: they dispute so of the secrets of
Nature, as if they came down from Heaven. By which we see, that in the first
peepings forth of this Schole-Divinitie out of its shel, there were not wanting
some zelose Reformers who opposed it, as being but a Philosophic dream, which
would greatly prejudice the true Christian Theology. And to make the same more
evident and clear we shall consider this Scholastic Theology in its Parts, both
essential and integral, with their origin from Pagan Philosophy.

. 3. The first Essential part of Scholastic Divinity, The Eristic mode of
Scholastic Theology from the Eleatic and Peripatetic Schools.
we shall consider, is its Form or Mode of Philophising, which is Eristic or
Dialectic, answerable to that in the Eleatic and Peripatetic Schole. For, as we
have formerly observed, B. 1. C. 2.. 1. there was in the Eleatic Schole a
(...), Eristic or contentiose mode of Disputing, whereof there was also some
spice in the old Academie called (...), a probationarie or problematic mode of
disputing, which yet was only about things doutful; but in the new Academies it
determined in an universal (...), or Sceptisme. This (...), contentiose Logic,
as seated in the old Academic Schools was more simple and plain, being managed
only in a way of Dialogue, according to the Scriptural mode of Disputation.
Whence (...) and (...) usually signify to dispute. But Aristotle, to avoid the
prejudices which such a naked form of disputation was exposed to, reduces the
disputes of his Schole to a more artificial form and method of syllogising;
wherein by reason of his natural acumen he was extreme dexterous. Him therefore
these Scholemen follow, as their Master; he having laid down a more succinct,
accurate, artificial form of disputation. Thus Luther (as Sleidan, Lib. 11.
Comment.) says, That Aristotle was in great repute among the Schole-Divines;
and there was nothing so absurd, so remote from our Religion, which they defend
not, which they clothe not with some interpretation, although far-fetcht, that
so his honor and name may be great. And Schmidius applies to them, 2 Timothy 2.23.
Foolish and unlearned Questions reject, knowing that they breed contentions.
But how guilty these Schole-Divines are as to contentiose disputes is set forth
to the life by one of their own Religion, Erasmus in his Annotations, on 1 Timothy
1.6. where he discovers how far they have, by their frivolous vain Questions
and Digladiations turned away, (...), to vain babbling. Though, to give
Aristotle his due, he was nothing near so vain and contentiose in his Disputes,
as these Scholemen are. It Is true, he left some Theses to be disputed by his
Scholars, (as also Theophrastus his successor after him) as an exercice of
their acumen and wits; but these disputations were nothing like those vain
(...), or contentiose disputes, which are in use amongst the Scholemen.
Therefore to give a more particular account of the origin of these vain
Scholastic Disputes, we must know, that these Scholemen, though they pretend
Aristotle to be their Master, yet they rather owe their Eristic mode of
disputing to Aristotle's Commentators the Arabians; How far the Arabians
contributed to Scholastic Theology.
particularly to Aben roes, who having little or no skill in the Greek, and not
much in the Latin, could only make some poor guesses touching Aristotle's mind
and sense: whence he framed many exotic terms, and uncouth notions and
distinctions as so many blinds to concele his ignorance. We sind this well
observed by Owen, de Theolog lib. 6. cap. 7. page 515, etc. In all the Eristic
disputations, Aristotle's name is pretended, when as they rather follow his
corrupt Interpreters and Commentators. For the Arabians, (from whom the
Scholemen derived al their niceties) being most ignorant of Greek and Latin,
were forced to make use of rude and unlearned Translations from the Latin to
the Arabic Tongue, which in many places could no way reach the sense of the
Original, etc. The like account I sind in Hornius, Histor. Philos. l. 5. c. 10.
of these Arabian Commentators on Aristotle, thus: I wish, they had been skilled
(which is altogether necessary to accurate Philosophy) in the Tongues, and in
Philologie. But they being borne in the midst of Barbarism, what else brought
they to Philosophy, but Ingenie and Industry? There happened another evil,
that whilst they estimed Aristotle for the God of Sapience, who could not
err, they ost err, with erring Aristotle. This also we may peremtorily
affirm, that they who gave up themselves to Aristotle's Philosophy, could not
understand Aristotle in his own tongue, nor yet in any tolerable Version. There
were extant Arabic Versions, but those in many places maimed, perverted,
corrupted. Which happened by the fault partly of the times, partly of men,
partly of the Tongues. The times were so barbarous, that Greece it self was
ignorant of her own Plato and Aristotle. For as it was difficult to turn
Aristotle out of Greek, by reason of his concise and interrupted manner of
speech; so was it most difficult for the Arabians, whose speech, as it is
evident, Quanquam dubium non sit, quin, si ipsos Arabes sua lingua, quae
scripserunt, lectitaremus, aut purior saltem versio adornaretur, propius ad
mentem Aristotelis accessuri essent. Horn. Histor. Philos. l. 5. c. 10.
is most disserent from the Greek: hence it was that these Commentators so
often mistake Aristotle. Thus Caelius, lib. 2. A. l. cap. 2. of Avincenna. He
being, says he, imbued with the Arabic Idiome, and no way verst in the Greek
literature, read Aristotle's Books not translated, but mutilated and perverted
in his barbaric tongue: whence no wonder if he could not attain to the sense
and mind of that most eminent Author, who for brevities sake often speaks so
concisely, that the best Philosophers can hardly reach his sense. Yea that
which adds to the Scholemens mistakes of Aristotle, is that they understood
only some Versions of these Arabic Commentators on Aristotle. That Abenroes,
(or as they write him Averroes) the chief of the Arabian Commentators on
Aristotle, was of great repute amongst the Scholemen at Paris, yea more studied
than Aristotle's Text, is evident, in that it was reputed the glory of a
Scholeman to be a good Averroist. And not many years since we found Averroes in
great vogue there. We find an excellent character of these Aristotelic Divines,
and their Eristic mode of disputing in Jansenius's August. Tom. 2. lib. pro em.
c. 28. The Scholemen being even drunken with the love of too much Philosophy,
would fain draw out, penetrate, form, and judge those secret mysteries of
Grace, almost buried and extinguished, according to the rules of human reason.
Hence that ardor of disputing every thing, and calling al those mysteries into
question. Hence their Theology is stuffed with a bundle of innumerable
opinions, by which al things though never so contrary are made probable, which,
according to their own declarations, it is lawful for any to defend. So that
promtitude has scarce lest any thing certain, but a belief that it is lawful to
form new opinions; for Scepticisme and incertitude is the punishment of such
temeritie: neither is any thing more natural, than that men from Peripatetics
should become Academics, etc. We find the like account of this
Schole-Divinitie, and its (...) in Owen, Theol. lib. 6. c. 7. page 516, etc. All the difference betwixt the Scholemen and Philosophers lies in this, that they
have mixed somewhat of Scripture with their Science. -- In the beginning of
Reformation nothing seemed so odiose in that Apostatised Church, as this
Theologic Science, which ruled in the Schole. -- From this Philosophic
Theologic there has sprung many Errors, infinite contentions, which might be
easily removed, if Christians would content themselves with the naked Word of
God, laying aside that spinose Theology, etc. Sir Francis Bacon, in his Novum
Organum, speaking of these Scholastic Divines, says, That besides their
reducing Theology into an order, and artificial form, they over and above
effected this, that Aristotle's contentiose and spinose Philosophy should be
more than was meet mixed with the body of Religion. This made Sir Henry Wotton
give this as his Epitaph, Disputandi pruritus est scabies Ecclesiae, the itch
of Disputing is the scab of the Church. And indeed Christ and his Apostles
foreseeing the noxious influences of these Scholastic disputes, give frequent,
and very severe Premonitions against them. So 1 Timothy 6.4, Doting about
questions and strife of words: 1 Timothy 6.4, 5.
(...), i. e. (as Grotius) answerable to the Philosophers (...), Again v. 5.
(...), or (...), Sophistic disputes: which he calls v. 20. (...), profane and
vain bablings: also (...), opposition of science falsely so called, of which
see more fully B. 1. C. 1.. 6. Again, 1 Timothy 1.6. (...), of which Book 1. C.
2.. 1. as also, 1 Cor. 1.20. (...). Which Scriptures, though they might have
some fulfilling in, and regard unto those vain disputings began in the
Primitive Churches; yet we may not limit them to those times: For without dout
the Spirit of God, in laying down such strict cautions against these vain
disputes, had a particular regard to following times, wherein he foresaw these
Philosophic contentions would be revived; as indeed they were by the Schole
Divines.

. 4. As the Form, so also the Matter of Schole-Divinitie, The matter of Schole
Divinity, specially Pelagian Infusions from Philosophy.
had its origin in good part from Pagan Philosophy. It Is true, the Text
these Scholastic disputers Theologise upon is usually the Sentences collected
out of the Fathers by Lombard, but their Comments are for the most part little
else but Philosophic Notions and Distinctions taken out of Aristotle and his
Commentators, Abenroes, etc. I shall not treat at large of the Matter of Schole
Divinity, but only of their Pelagian Infusions, which are their (...), the
spirit of Antichrist, which they have greatly fomented by their Scholastic
Disputes, and contemplations traduced from Pagan Philosophic. And here we may
not bring all the Schole-Divines under this imputation and condemnation. For
Thomas Aquinas and his followers the Thomistes, who keep more close to
Augustine, are nothing near so guilty of this Pelagian crime as the Jesuits.
Yea, many of the Thomistes, as Greg. Ariminensis, Alvarez, and others, have
greatly opposed the Pelagians and Jesuits in the most principal of their
Dogmes against Efficacious Grace. Yet, that the Scholemen have been the great
brochers and patrons of Pelagianisme, is evident by their Writings: neither did
Pelagius's Doctrine find any considerable favor and acceptance in the Catholic
Church til the Scholemen came in play. And that these Pelagian Infusions were
foisted into their Schole Divinity by Philosophic Disputes and Principes, is
as clear. We have in the foregoing Chapter,. 8, 10. shown, what foundation the
Pelagian Heresy received amongst the Grecian Fathers, particularly Origin, and
that from Pagan Philosophy. Now that the Scholemen build their Pelagian
Infusions upon the same foundation, will be easy to prove. We find a great
account hereof in Jansenius his Augustinus, Tom. 1. lib. 6. cap. 18. Although
if we, would reduce the Pelagian Error to its proper fountain, and weigh it in
its own balance, we shall find that it has been composed of nothing else but of
the Placits of gentile Philosophers. Neither is the apparatus of that whole
Heresy any thing else but pure Pythagoric, Stoic, and Aristotelic Philosophy;
so that what Tertullian and Jerome said of the Philosophers, that they were the
Patriarchs of Heretics, may be affirmed of none more truly than of the
Pelagians, their descent from the Philosophers. Which may easily be
demonstrated of each hinge of the Pelagian Error: 1. The Pelagian (...) from
Philosophy.
For (1) the first and chief Pelagian Dogme was concerning (...), Apathie, or
Impeccance; and what is this but that most known and proud reverie of the
Pythagoric and Stoic Philosophy? against which both the Peripatetics and new
Academics most stoutly dispute; whose opinions Tullie in his Tusculan Questions
has explicated. That the Scholemen have been great Champions for this
Philosophic Pelagian Impeccance, or state of Perfection in this life, 2.
Free Will from Philosophic.
is evident from al their writings, etc. (2) Another Philosophic infusion sucked
in by the Pelagian Schole-Divines, follows in Jansenius thus: It is the
unanimous opinion of the Philosophers, That other things are to be sought from
the Gods, but Virtue from a man's self. So Seneca, The only good which is the
cause and firmament of a blessed life, is to trust on a man's self. In which
words the whole venom of the Pelagian impiety is comprehended. So Tullie de
Not. Deorum, fine, Virtue, says he, is never acknowledged by any as received
from God. That the Philosophers generally asserted a natural power or freewil
to moral good has been before proved, Part 2. Book 3. Chapter 2.. 4. which some
called the seeds of virtue, others (...), good nature, others (...), others
(...), a self-power, others (...), an indifference to good or evil. Al which
the Scholemen have foisted into their Theology, both names and things. That
this Scholastic Free Will and indifference to good and evil, was originally a
Philosophic figment, 3. Pelagian Errors about Original Sin from Philosophy.
see more largely Jansenius, Augut. Tom. 2. l. 4. c. 24. (3) It follows in
Jansenius, Tom. 1. l. 6. c. 18. Also their disputes against Original Sin and
its punishment, whence came they but from the Ethnics Philosophy? for these
were not only ignorant of the traduction of Sin from the Parent to the Child,
but also assorded unto Pelagius such materials as served for a foundation to
his Error, etc. And have not the Scholemen made use of the same Philosophic
Arms to oppugn the traduction of Original Sin?

(4) Jansenius adds, That not only the Pelagian Dogmes, Pelagians Arms from
Philosophy.
but also the very weapons which are used by its Defendents to maintain the
same were taken out of the Philosophers Shop: which is so far true, that if you
take away the garrulitie or babbling of Philosophy, the whole Heresy may be
dissipated by one breath. Whence the Pelagians being condemned by the Church
fly to the Philosophers, even by their sentence to be absolved from
condemnation. Then he adds more particularly concerning the Scholemen, how
much they have somented and nourished this Pelagian Heresy, by virtue of
Aristotle's Philosophy incorporated into their own subtle Questions and
Scholastic niceties. Moreover as Philosophy alone produced this Pelagian
Heresy, so as many as in aftertimes amongst the Christians have adulterated
the purity of Divine Grace, by a predominant mixture of human liberty, have
been seduced by the inveiglement of Philosophy. -- For by how much the more
plain and simple the truth once was explained, and delivered; by so much the
more vexatious subtlety found or cast in scruples; and that which it found
certain, it made uncertain, by mixing therewith uncertainties: for too much of
Philosophy has ever sophisticated, not perfected Christian truth, in that it
does not believe sufficiently things divine and sixed; neither does it
sufficiently understand those human mixtures which by their seeming novitie
flater, etc. We find yet a more full confirmation hereof in Jansenius, August.
Tom. 1. l. 6. c. 23. Amongst the Pelagians there is a great estimation of
Secular Sciences; and because they are sons of contention, they greatly affect
Logic, because any thing is wont to be defended by the pertinacious against the
truth by Philosophic subtilties. Hence they would needs seem exact Dialectics
and Aristotelics, that so they may by their Syllogismes cast mists on the eyes
of the ignorant: Which vanity Augustine does most frequently upbraid the
Pelagians withal. Hence they would have althings doutful decided by human
reasons; which they ever-where crack, as the Philosophers were wont. Namely,
Reason holds the chief place amongst the Pelagians, to which they contend, all the Scriptures must conform, although they seem to speak what is contrary
thereto. Whence Julian fixing the Pelagian rule, says, What reason argues
authority may not deny. Thus Jansenius: wherein he gives us an exact
character of these Pelagian Schole-Divines, and their Philosophic Theology.
For what more Idolized in the Schools than their Recta Ratio, Right Reason, as
they style it, which they make the measure of Moral good and evil, answerably
to the (...), right reason among the Philosophers, of which see P. 4. B. 1. C.
2.. 2. Yea, that these Schole-Divines have out-gone the very Philosophers,
(those who were more ancient) in their Pelagian Infusions, is excellently laid
open to us by Jansenius, August. Tom. 2. de Not. pura l. 2. c. 2. p. 326. I
have more than once, says he, vehemently wondered, that the Philosophers,
before the light of the Gospel shone on the Gentiles, Philosophised far more
rightly, more accurately, more holily of the chief Heads of Moral Doctrine, of
the Infirmity of natural Ability to live well, of God to be loved in all acts,
of the Souls Purgation and Beatitude, of the Necessity of Grace, etc. than
many Christian Scholemen. Neither truly can I find any other cause hereof but
this, that they have universally followed Aristotle's (...), vain
ratiocination, who being willing to carpe at the choicest Heads of Learning in
his Master Plato, and that either from his ignorance of Divine things, or from
an emulation of his Master's glory, he by his minute reasonings contemplated
only terrene things: He supposed there needed not any Adjutorie of a superior
Being, either to Virtue, or Happiness its reward; but being ignorant of his
own Imbecillitie, he taught, that for every good work a man should confide in
his own strength and virtue. This is the very poison which the Pelagians sucked
from him as their Master, whilst they stifled the Grace of God as superfluous:
This is the Doctrine which the Scholemen have endeavored to moderate, whilst
they frame two men in one, a Philosopher, and a Christian. Whence also we see
it happened, that so long as Aristotle's Philosophy stood banished from the
Churches Schools, there was no mention found of these Pelagian Dogmes or
blandishments of pure nature in the Writings of the Latin Fathers, Cyprian,
Ambrose, Augustine, etc. But the Scholemen, because they remembered themselves to
be Christians, placed a supernatural and natural man, as the Arc with Dagon,
in the same house: For whatever they perceive to be predicated of Divine Grace
in Scripture, that they apply to the supernatural man: and whatever they find
mentioned in the Philosophers touching the power of the will, and Philosophic
Virtues, this they apply to the natural man. Whence their distinction of
Virtue and Happiness into natural and supernatural, as hereafter, P. 4. Book
1. Chap. 2.. 4. Thus we see how all the Pelagian Dogmes have been revived by the
Scholemen, and that upon Philosophic Principes.

SECT. II. A general Account of Antichrist's Canonic Theology and (...), with
its Traduction from the Philosophers (...).
ANother great Pillar of Antichrist's Throne is Canonic Theology;. 1. 3.
Canonic Antichristianisme from Pagan Philosophy.
the main design whereof has been to defend Antichrist's Authority and
Discipline by Ecclesiastic Canons. For look as the Monks by their pretended
Sanctity and Mystic Theology, and the Scholemen by their Eristic Theology;
so in like manner the Canonists by their Canonic Theology have endeavored to
their utmost to maintain and propagate Antichrists Soveraintie and Discipline.
The chief Head of these Canonists was Gratian, who reduced the Ecclesiastic
Canons to a body called the Canon Law; the scope whereof chiefly is to support
the Discipline of the Pope, under a pretension of the Catholic Church, and its
Authority. For as the Scholemens (...), or task was to defend the Pope's Power
and Doctrine by Disputation and strength of argument; so the work of these
Canonists was to maintain Antichrist's Soveraintie and Discipline by producing
the Canons and Authority of the Catholic Church. They pretend not to
Scholastic Reason or Argument; for that (say they) does but diminish the
Authority of a Law; but their great Diana is the Churches Authority, which
they urge as the fountain of al their Ecclesiastic Canons and Impositions. But
to run up this Canonic Theology to its origin or spring head, we no way dout
but to make it very evident, that the main, if not the whole of Antichrist's
Ecclesiastic Canons and Discipline owes its origin to Pythagorean, or some
other Philosophic Institutes. This we shall make good both by Divine and Human
Authority. And the great hinge on which this our Demonstration shall turn, is
that eminent Prophetic image or character of Antichrist, 1 Timothy 4.1, 2, 3.
compared with Col. 2.8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. And to give a general
key to these and such Prophetic descriptions of Antichrist; we are to know,
that though they might have some typic and initial fulfilling in the Gnostic
Heretics, which started up in the Apostles times, and were forerunners of
Antichrist, as has been once and agian observed, Ch 1.. 7. Yet their main scope
is to characterise and delineate Antitichrist his (...), superstition and
tyrannic Impositions. For it is usual with the Spirit of God in Scripture to
paint forth and decipher the great and famous Apostasy under Antichrist, by
lesser and more particular Usurpations and Apostasies of persons in those times
wherein the Prophecy was delivered. So in the Old Testament, what is
Historically spoken of Egypt, Babylon, Antiochus, etc. is in the New Testament
applied to Antichrist and his Kingdom; in like manner as David and Solomon are
made Types of Christ. So here, we deny not but that these Prophetic Characters
of Antichrist, laid down by Paul, and John might have some foundation in, and
regard unto those Gnostic Antichrists of their time, of whom Simon Magus was
the Head; but to confine al these great Prophetic descriptions of Antichrist to
Simon Magus, or some Heretic of those times, as Grotius and his Sectators seem
to do, savors too much of an Antichristian spirit. No, it is our safest course
to interpret Scripture in its largest sense: for as it has been well observed by
Sir Francis Bacon, in his Advancement of Learning, Prophetic Scriptures have
their fulfilling over and again in diverse Periods and Ages: so that al these
Scriptures which we have before made use of to characterise and describe the
Gnostics and their Philosophic Infusions, who were the Forerunners of
Antichrist, may much more truly and fully be applied to Antichrist, the great
Antitype; who though last in Execution, yet was first in Intention, as we need
no way dout. Having given this key, we shall proceed to demonstrate, That
Antichrists Canonic Theology, or Ecclesiastic Canons, were Derivations from,
and Imitamens of Philosophic, and principally Pythagoric Institutes. And herein
we shall follow our wonted method, reducing the whole of our Demonstration to
the Form and Matter of Canonic Theology.

. 2. As for the Form of Antichrists Canon Law, it received its Constitution
from its formal Object, answerably to al other Laws. The form of Antichrists
Canon Law from the Churches Authority, taken up in imitation of the Pythagorean
Dogmes or Canons. 1 These. 2.13.
For the formal Object of any Law is the Authority of the Lawgiver, which is
the principal foundation, or proper motive on which it dependes. Whence the
formal Object of this Antichristian Canon Law is the pretended Authority of the
Church, on which al their Ecclesiastic Canons are founded, as on their
principal ground and proper motive. For look as Christ's Divine Law has for its
formal Object his Divine Authority reveled in Scripture, according to 1 These.
2.13. As the word of God. This As is reduplicative, not specificative only, (as
quatenus is used in the Schools) i. e. they received the Word of God under this
reduplication, As the word of God, or as clothed with Divine Authority: so
parallel hereto Antichrist's Canon Law has for its formal Object the pretended
Churches Autoritic; whence resultes its formal constitution, or obligatorie
spirit and force. Now that this formal constitution of Antichrist's Canonic
Theology exactly answers to, and, as we may presume, was taken up in imitation
of the Pythagorean mode of dogmatising, or imposing Institutes, seems evident
from what intimations we find hereof in the forementioned Scriptures. So 1 Timothy
4.1. (...), 1 Timothy 4.1. (...).
Doctrines of Demons. (...), as used in the Pythagorean Schole, signifies the
same with (...), a Dogme, Decree, Institute, Canon: so also it seems to be
used, Col. 2.22. (...). Where (...) being appendent to (...), signifies the
Institutes and Dogmes of the Philosophers, (as Grotius) answering to (...), v.
20. of which hereafter, Sect. 4.. 3. Thus Mat. 15.9. as also S. 4. S. 3. So
that by (...), Doctrines of Demons here we may understand those Dogmes,
Institutes, and Canons, which Antichrist by his pretended Ecclesiastic
Authority and Traditions, should impose upon the Churches of Christ, in
imitation of those Pythagorean Dogmes, Institutes, and Canons imposed by
Pythagoras on his Scholars, in reference to their (...), Demon-worship. For the
Explication whereof we may remember, that amongst Pythagoras's Scholars (...),
ipse dixit, HE SAID IT, i. e. Pythagoras, had the same weight and authority, as
any Law or Canon in human Polities. They disputed not but obeyed their Masters
Canons and Institutes, with as great reverence as the Sons of Antichrist do his
Ecclesiastic Canons: so that a Dogme or Doctrine in his Schole had the sul
force and obligation of a Law, specially in matters of Discipline and
Demon-worship. In imitation whereof our Apostle here tells us, that Antichrist
should introduce his Demon-Dogmes, or Canons, under a pretext of
Church-autoritie or tradition. And this notion of (...), as it implies a Dogme
or Canon, suits well with our Apostles sense: for Antichrists Saints, couched
here under the notion of Demons, take up a good part of his Canon Law; yea the
whole of their Saintship and Mediatory Office owes its origin to some Popish
Canon; whence we find so frequent mention in their Canonic Theology of the
Canonisation of Saints, and Canonised Saints, etc. answerably to the Demon
(...), Deification. So that it is evident, this (...), which Antichrist was to
introduce, comprehendes his Ecclesiastic Canons, at least such as refer to his
(...), Saint-worship. This suites with v. 3 (...), which implies a Canonic
prohibition against Marriage, of which we find many branches in Antichrists
Canon Law; and with ver. 7. where we find mention of old wives fables, which
indeed is a good character of al Antichrists Canons, notwithstanding their
pretension to Church-Autoritie and Tradition. To which our Apostle opposes v.
9. a Divine Christian Cabala, Canon, or Tradition: This is (says he) a
faithful saying and worthy of al acceptance; (...), i.e. (as Paulus Fagius)
this is the true Christian Cabala, or Tradition, in opposition to al these
Pythagoric, Jewish, Antichristian Cabala's, as before, Book 1. Chap. 4.. 1. But
we find Antichrists Ecclesiastic Canons, and their origin from Pythagorean
Dogmes more fully laid open to us, Col. 2.8.
Col. 2.8, etc. where he gives them (1) a strict charge, that no one spoil
them. (...), i. e. plunder them of their Christian liberty, or lead them
captive: which exactly suites with Antichrist, his plundering Christians of
their Liberty, and captivating their Consciences, or bringing them under the
yoke of his Ecclesiastic Canons. Of which see what precedes, C. 1.. 1. We find
the like caution, Gal. 5.1. Gal. 5.1.
Stand fast therefore in your liberty, etc. Where, says Grotius, he calls
(...), the yoke of bondage, not only that which the Hebrews call (...), the yoke
of the Law; but also those Opinions or Rites, whereby the Gentiles bound
themselves. (...) signifies to be bound, or to be brought under an obligation.
(...) properly signifies to urge, to ensnare, to take al occasions of hurting
others, as Hesychius and Eustathius: so Mar. 6.19 Thence (...) primarily
signifies, to be ensnared, to be entangled, to be held bound. Thus these
Galatians had their Consciences entangled in the yoke of Judaic Ceremonies. It
seems to allude to Oxen, whose heads are entangled in their Harness, or the
cords of their yoke. Which exactly describes to us that obligation and bondage,
which the Conscience is brought under by subjection to the yoke of Antichrists
Ecclesiastic Canons. (2) Our Apostle, Col. 2.8. Col. 2.8.
lays down the medium or means by which Antichrist leads captive the
Consciences of men, and brings them under his Canonic yoke; that is, (...), by
Philosophy and vain deceit. Here is, says Grotius, (...), as if he had said,
by the vain deceit of Philosophy. By Philosophy here Grotius and Hammond
understand the Pythagorean; which was stuffed with Dogmes, Institutes,
Traditions, and Canons, which al who were of Pythagoras's Church or College
submitted unto, as their Canon Law or Rule of Discipline; wherein they were
followed by Antichrist and his Church: (as well as the Primitive Gnosties:) so
it follows (...), according to the tradition of men. This Grotius applies also
to the Pythagorean Philosophy, and its Human Traditions and Canons imposed on
al those of that Sect; who have been herein followed (...) (not only by the
Gnostics, but also) by Antichrist; for what are al his Ecclesiastic Traditions
and Canons, but corrupt Imitamens of Pythagorean and Talmudic Traditions and
Canons? It Is true, he pretendes unto a Church-Autoritie as the fountain of al;
and so did the Pharisees for all their Talmudic Traditions, or Oral Canon Law;
and yet notwithstanding both one and the other were but Traditions of men, yea of
blind Pythagoreans. Thence it follows, (...) in Philosophy signifies a first
Principe, Dogme, Institute or Canon: and he adds, of this world; because they
flowed from Pythagorean Human Institution, not from Christ. We find the like,
Gal. 4.3, 9. where (...) is evidently used to signify Injunctions or Canons.
And are not Antichrists Ecclesiastic Canons here characterised to the life?
which though they claim kindred with Heavenly Tradition, yet it is a thing most
plain, that they were al of terrene extract, rudiments of this world, or, as
Gal. 4.9. Beggarly elements, descended from Tradition, not from Christ, as it
follows: (...), and not according to Christ; i.e. says Grotius, not such
rudiments or canons as Christ brought from Heaven. It Is true, Antichrists
Canons have Christ and his Churches name affixt to them, as the Jewish Talmud
or Oral Law passes under the name of Divine Traditions; but in truth both one
and the other owe their origin to Pythagorean Institutes, Traditions, and
Canons, not to Christ his Royal Canon Law. Col. 2.14.
This is farther illustrated v. 14. Blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances.
(...) signifies a Bill or Bond under a man's hand, whereby he binds himself to
some payment of money or duty: Thence Hesychius interprets it by (...), i.e.
such a Schedule or obligation under a man's own hand, whereby he acknowledges a
debt, and promises the payment, according to the day appointed. So the Legal
Sacrifices, Oblations, Purifications, and Ceremonies were a bond or
handwriting, whereby the Jews testified and acknowledged their debt to Divine
Justice. This Bond, says our Apostle, Christ has cancelled, by nailing it to
his Cross, (this being one way of cancelling a Bond by striking a nail
thorough it:) beware therefore how you suffer your selves to be brought under
any fresh obligation by any Antichristian Canons or Injunctions. That this is
applicable to Antichrists Ecclesiastic Canons, is evident by the (...)
appendant thereto. It is well known that (...) is a Philosophic notion,
signifying an Institute, Injunction or Canon, imposed on their Disciples,
specially in the Pythagorean Schole: and it was used in the same notion in the
Greek Churches, for a Decree or Canon. So Luke 2.1. Caesar's Decree is called
(...), whence this handwriting of Ordinances is styled, Ephesians. 2.15. (...),
the Law of Commandments in Ordinances; i. e. the Jewish Canon Law consisting of
many Ordinances, which Antichrist has since revived, mixing therewith many
Pythagorean Dogmes or Canons. So it follows, v. 16. Let no man therefore judge
you in meat and drink, Col. 2.16. (...).
etc. (...), judge, is a Law-notion, and as here applied to meat and drink,
supposes some Ecclesiastic Canons or Traditions, concerning the same. Grotius
makes it the same with (...), as Romans 2.1. and understandes it of those
Pythagorising Masters, who imposed these their Ordinances under pain of
damnation. Which indeed is of none more true than of Antichrist, who enjoins
the Observance of his Ecclesiastic Canons and Ordinances under pain of
damnation, Purgatory, Ver. 18.
etc. The like he adds, v. 18. (...), Let no man plunder you of your reward.
By reward (says Grotius) he understands in this place the liberty vouchsafed
by Christ. Now what has more abreged this Christian liberty, than Antichrists
Ecclesiastic Canons? which we find more fully described v. 20. (...), Col. 2.20.
from the rudiments of the world. He repetes here what he had before mentioned
v. 8. (...) (says Grotius) signifies al Institutions. They are called the
Rudiments of this world, because they were commun to the Gentiles with the
Jews; yea they seem rather to be traduced from the Gentiles to the Jews, than
to proceed from the Jews to the Gentiles. So that we see what was the fountain
whence Antichrist derived his Ecclesiastic Institutes, namely some human, and
principally Pythagorean Institution or Canon; which the Apostle gives a strict
caution against in what follows, Why, as though living in the world, are ye
subject to Ordinances? (...), i. e. why do ye suffer your selves to be imposed
upon by those Antichristian Pythagorean Dogmes? (...), as has been before
observed, signifies to impose a Dogme, Institute, or Canon, answerably to
(...), to impose a Law. And look as the Pythagoreans had their Dogmes,
Institutes or Canons, which they imposed on their Disciples; so Antichrist his
Ecclesiastic Canons or Laws, which for the most part were of Pythagorean
extract, as v. 21. of which hereafter. Thence it follows, Ver. 22.
v. 22. (...), according to the Commandments and doctrines of men. This
relates to the (...), v. 20. as if he had said, Al these Pythagorean
Injunctions, Dogmes, or Canons, which these Gnostics have already assumed, and
Antichrist will hereafter reassume, they are but human sigments or Traditions,
not of Divine stamp and institution. Whence he adds, v. 23. Which things
indeed have a show of wisdom. Ver. 23.
(...), an appearance of Divine, Canonic institution. As al Antichrists Canons
have a show of Church-Autoritie, or Divine Canonic Institution, though they are
indeed but Human, Pythagorean, and Jewish Traditions, founded on Will Worship:
as it follows, (...), says Grotius, signifies Rites or Ceremonies; which had
its origin from the Thracians, as Plutarch teaches us. Whence (...) signifies
Rites and Observations taken up of our own accord; which the Hebrews call (...),
and the Greeks (...). Such indeed are al Antichrists Institutes and Canons, no
other than the Injunctions of his own Antichristian Pleasure, taken up in
imitation of Pythagorean Dogmes, mixed with some Jewish Ordinances, and framed
into a Canon Law, for the conservation of his tyrannic Will Worship, which he
imposes on al his slaves, under the usurped pretension of Church-autoritie,
and Apostolic Tradition. Thus we have shown what foundation Antichrists
Canonic Theology, as to its formal constitution, had in the Pythagorean
Philosophy.

. 3. 2. The Matter of Antichrists Canon Law from Pagan Philosophy.
As Antichrist derived the Form, so in like manner the Matter of his
Ecclesiastic Canons from Pagan Philosophy; the Demonstration whereof will
appear evident from an enumeration of Particulars. Indeed the whole body of
Antichrists Canon Law seems to be but a reviving of the old Pagan (...),
Demon-worship, according to Paul's Prophetic description of that Man of Sin, 1 Timothy 4.1. (...), etc. We shall insist only on such of his Canons as are
manifestly Derivations from, and Imitamens of the Philosophers Demon-worship.
And the main seat of this Discourse shall be that great character of Antichrists
Discipline, 1 Timothy 4.1, 2, 3. 1 Timothy 4 1, 2, 3.
Doctrines of Demons, etc. Before we enter upon the examen of Particulars, we
are to make our way plain by removing those Antichristian Glosses, which are
given by Grotius, and his Adherents, on this and suchlike characters of
Antichrist. Grotius restraines these words to Apollonius Tyanaeus, that
Pythagorean Sorcerer, and Hammond seems to limit them to Simon Magus, and other
Gnostic Heretics; which so far as they were Forerunners of Antichrist, we have
before admitted. But yet that the main scope of this Prophetic Character is to
delineate Antichrist, and his Demon-worship introduced by his Ecclesiastic
Canons, is excellently well proved to our hands by Mede, on 2 Pet. 2.1. ( Diatr.
3. page 532). In these Prophesies (says he) of a general defection and
Apostasy of the later times, 2 These. 2. 1 Timothy 4.1, etc. if St. Paul should
mean no other but the Errors of particular men, and their trouble from the
Church, they should make no Prophecy at al, or a needless one. For who knows
not, that in St. Paul's, St. John's, and the Apostles times were diverse
Heresies and Heretics here and there dispersed: of al these they could not
mean, when as (1) the known body of the visible Church disclaimed them. (2)
They foretell of a corruption to come in after times, or as 1 Timothy 4.1. In the
later times: for no man uses to foretell of things which are already, as if
they were to come. -- The corruption and defection therefore so much prophesied
of, was another manner of one; such a kind of one as had neither been before in
the Church, nor was to be; namely such an one as should not be disclaimed by
the body of the Church, but should surprise and overwhelme the visible Church
itself.

We now proceed to the particulars of Antichrist's (...), or Canonic
Demon-worship, according to 1 Timothy 4.1. 1 Timothy 4.1. (...), Doctrines of Demons
what.
(...). 1. That (...) here signifies not a mere Speculative Doctrine, but an
Institute or Canon, as Col. 2.22. answerably to the notion of (...), Col. 2.14,
20. we have proved. 2. To which we may add, that this also suites with the
notion of (...), which, according to Pagan and Scripture-phraseologie,
signifies not a mere Doctor and Teacher, but also an Institutor or Preceptor,
who has Authority to impose his Dogmes and Canons; whence the proper title
given to Christ is (...), answerably to the Hebrew (...), Rabbi. So that by
(...), we must understand those Ecclesiastic Institutes or Canons, which
Antichrist was to frame, for the introducing the Philosophic (...), or
Demon-worship. And that this is the proper notion of (...) in this place,
namely to signify Demons, (not Devils as Grotius will have it) is evident from
those parallel places, Act. 17.22. (...), Rev. 9.20. (...), 1 Cor. 10.21,
(...), etc. Of which more in what follows. Now these Demon-Dogmes or Canons
framed by Antichrist, in imitation of the old Grecian (...), (framed by the
Philosophers, and made a chief part of their (...), Natural Theology)
comprehend several branches parallel to the Pagan Demon-Canons.

1. As the Philosophers had their Deified Demons, 1. Antichrist's Canonised
Saints in imitation of Pagan Demons.
which took up a good part of their Natural Theology, so also Antichrist has
his Canonised Saints, who fill up a great part of his Canon Law, as 1 Timothy 4.1.
(...), Demons. Mede, in his excellent Discourse of the Apostasy of the later
times, opens this Text at large, and shows, That the Primitive Christians
Canonised Saints, and honored their Relics in imitation of the Gentiles,
their Demon worship, thereby to allure them; which laid the foundation of
Antichrist's (...), and Idolatric Apostasy. We shall discourse a little more
distinctly and particularly touching these Antichristian Saints, and their
derivation from the Pagan Demons. As for the origin of the Philosophers Demons
we have once and again discoursed thereof, as Part 2. Bock 2. Chap. 8.. 11. and
P. 3. B. 2. C. 1.. 1. also Philosoph. General. P. 1. L. 3. C. 4.. 4. We shall
add thereto what account we find hereof in Augustine and Ludovicus Vives
thereon. August. de Civit. Dei, lib. 8. cap. 18. tells us, That Apuleius (and
whoever are of the same opinion) does in vain defer or bestow this honor on
those Demons, whom he places as midling Gods in the Air, as those who must
transport the prayers of men to the Gods, and thence the commands of the Gods
to men. For they who believed these things thought it unworthy for men to
mingle with the Gods, or the Gods with men; but that it was meet for these
Demons to mingle with men and the Gods. Where Ludovicus Vives gives this whole
Mystery more fully to us: This is the opinion of Plato in his Convivium, and
attributed to Socrates, who asking Diotima what Love was? she made answer,
(...), A great Demon, O Socrates: for every Demon is a middle betwixt God and
Mortal. Socrates not yet understanding, demands what this Demon's power and
nature was? then Diotima answers, to interpret and conveigh human affairs to
the Gods, and Divine affairs to us: i. e. prayers and sacrifices from men to
the Gods, and precepts and rewards from the Gods to men. Wherefore Demons being
placed in the middle, they fill up that place, that so the universe may be well
disposed and conjoined. Hence flows Prophets, and al Sacerdotal art, and
whatever belongs to Sacrifices, and Incantations. To these she adds, what
Augustine cites, (...), etc. God mingleth not with man; but al commerce betwixt
men and God is by Demons. These Apuleius calls Administers and
Salvation-bringers. They are called by Capella, Angels, i.e. Messengers. Now
that the Popish Saints were taken up, and brought into the Church in imitation
of these Pagan Demons seems very evident, and that according to the general
consent both of ancient and modern Writers. Indeed there was a great
foundation laid for these Antichristian Demons or Saints in the fourth
Centurie, as soon as the Church began to have any relaxation from Pagan
persecution. This I gather out of Augustine, de Civit. Dei, lib. 8. cap. 26. But
that Egyptian Trismegistus seems to grieve, that the Commemorations of our
Martyrs should succeed the Temples and Commemorations of their Demons; so that
he who shall read these things with a mind perverse and averse from us, may
think, that as the Pagans worshipped their Gods in their Temples, so we worship
our dead Martyrs at their Graves, etc. By which it is evident, that in
Augustin's time the Christians performed many Commemorations and other
solemnities at the Graves of the Martyrs and Saints, al which had a very great
ressemblance with the Pagan (...), Demon worship; though as yet it was not
arrived to (...), a Saint-worship. For Augustine, in his following Chapter
endeavors to vindicate this respect which some gave to the Martyrs and Saints
from the imputation of Saint-worship; though it is most certain, that it laid a
very great foundation for the same, as it may appear by Augustin's own words,
and the observations of learned Papists thereon. August. de civit. Dei, lib. 8.
cap. 27. speaks thus, Neither do we notwithstanding constitute Temples,
Priesthoods, Sacreds, and Sacrifices to these Martyrs; because they are not our
God, but their God is ours. -- Wherever therefore there be performed
Religiose Obsequies, in the places where Martyrs suffered, they are only
Ornaments for Memorial, not Sacreds, or Sacrifices of the Dead, as if they were
Gods. Whoever also carry their Banquets thither, which truly is not performed
by the better sort of Christians, and in many Countries there is no such
custom; yet whoever they be who do this, (which Banquets when they have set
down at the Martyrs Sepulcher, they pray and carry them away, that they may
feste thereon, or that they may bestow them upon the poor amongst them) they
will that their Banquets be sanctified there, by the merits of the Martyrs, in
the name of the God of the Martyrs. But yet he who acknowledges one true God
does not acknowledge these to be Sacrifices of the Martyrs. We therefore worship
not our Martyrs with Divine honors, as they worship their Demon Gods. Thus
Augustine. By which, though he endeavors to vindicate the Christians of his age
from (...), Demon-worship performed to the Saints; yet it is evident by his own
confession, that some superstitiose Christians were too much inclined thereto:
for he says, That they carried their Banquets to the Sepulchers of the
Martyrs, and there prayed, and so carried them away again, supposing them to be
sanctified by the merits of the Martyrs. Yea, Augustine, Lib. 6. of his
Confessions, relates of his own Mother, That she brought to Milan, for a
Commemoration of the Saints, Bread, and Fruments, and Wine, and gave them to
the dore-keeper: But these things were prohibited by Ambrose, to avoid occasion
of rioting, and because these kind of Parentals were most like to the Gentiles
superstition. This also is taken notice of by Cassander, that learned and
moderate Papist, Consultat. Art. 21. de Venerat. Reliqu. Moreover, in the times
of Ambrose and Augustine this custom prevailed, that the people brought
Banquets for the Commemoration of the Martyrs, which that it was not done by
the better Christians, but prohibited by Ambrose at Milan, Augustine testifies,
Confess. l. 6. c. 2. And that these and suchlike Imitamens of the Pagan (...),
Demon-worship, gave a great and effectual entrance to the Popish Canonised
Saints, and their (...) is confessed by some ingenuous Papists. So Ludovicus
Vives, on these words of Augustine, de Civit. Dei, l. 8. c. 27. But these are
not the sacrifices of Martyrs. Many Christians, says he, often offend in a
good matter, in that they worship their He-and-She-Saints as God: neither can I
discern any difference in many things between this their opinion of Saints,
and that which the Gentiles had of their Gods. Which is indeed a great and most
true Confession, and is taken notice of by several of our Writers: as by
Reignolds in his Conference with Heart, where he tells, That Ludovicus Vives
says in his Comment on Augustine, l. 8. c. 27. that Saints are estimed and
worshipped by many as were the Gods amongst the Gentiles. The like Confession I
find in Cassander, that moderate Papist, in his Consultation, Art. 21. where
quoting this place of Augustine, he says, That the ignorance of the commun
people has attributed Divine honor to the Saints; as when Temples, Altars,
Sacrifices, Priesthoods, Vows, Festivals are conceived to be consecrated not
only to the memory, as the Ancients speak, but to the honor and worship of the
Saints. Which Error Augustine now and then refutes: We, says he, build not
Temples to the Martyrs, as to Gods, but memorials for them as dead men. Where
Grotius observes well, That we should take diligent heed, lest under too
favorable inclinations in this matter, the Pagan customs be reduced into
Christianisme.

Thus we see how Antichrists Canonised Saints were but Imitamens or Apes of the
Gentile-Demons. The Origin of Popish Saints the same with that of the Pagan
Demons.
And to make the parallel yet more exact and clear, we shall show how these
Popish Saints had the very same origin amongst Christians, as the Deified
Demons had amongst the Pagans. We have already, C. 1.. 3. treated of the
Origin of those Demons out of Plato, who tells us, That they were certain noble
Heroes belonging to the Golden-Age, who having been exceeding famous for their
Wisdom, Virtues, or some wonderful achievements and warlike exploits, were
after their death, according to the appointment of the Divine Oracle, Deified
and worshipped as Gods. We find the like account in Hesiod, (whom Plato cites
to the same purpose) who says, That the men of the Golden-Age being dead
became, (...), Demons and Conservators of mortal men. By men of the Golden Age,
we need no way dout but Hesiod and Plato meant the first Patriarchs and Heads
of mankind; who having gained a great estime with their Posterity, for some
conceived excellence of Wisdom, Virtue, or Warlike exploits, were, by the
Devils inveiglement, Idolized by Superstitiose spirits, as Demons, or Deisied
Mediators. This is well observed by Mede, on Genesis 3.13-15. ( Diatrib. 2. p. 428)
Here I observe, (says he) that overmuch dotage upon a conceived excellence,
whether of Wisdom, or whatsoever else, without a special eye to Gods
Commandment, has ever been the occasion of greatest Errors in the World; and
the Devil under this mask, uses to bleer our eyes, and with this bait to
enveigle our hearts, that he may securely bring us to his lure. The admired
Wisdom of the long-living Fathers of the elder World, having been for so many
Ages as Oracles to their offspring grown even to a People and Nation while
they lived, was the ground of the ancient Idolatry of mankind, whilst they
supposed, that those to whom for Wisdom they had recourse being living, could
not but help them when they were dead. This we may learn out of Hesiod, who
says, The men of the Golden Age being dead, became Demons, or Godlings and
Patrons of mortal men. So the opinion of the blessed Martyrs superlative Glory
in Heaven, was made the occasion of the Newfound Idolatry of the
Christian-Churches, wherewith they are for the greatest part yet overwhelmed.
And the estime which Peter had above the rest of the Apostles, in regard of
Chiesdome, even in the Apostles times, was abused by the old Deceiver, to
instal the man of sin. This made St. Paul to say, 2 These. 2.7. The mystery of
iniquity was then working, etc. Thus we see how the Popish (...),
Saint-worship, had the very same origin or foundation as the Pagan (...), viz.
some conceived excellence, pretended merit, or wonder-working power.

. 4. We have given some account of the origin of this (...), in the Primitive
Churches of the third and fourth Centurie, we shall proceed to treat more
particularly of it as reduced by Antichrist unto his systeme or body of
Canonic Theology in the following Centuries, with endeavors to demonstrate its
exact symbolisation with the Pagan (...). And in this procedure we shall
discourse more particularly (1) of the origin of these Canonised Saints; (2)
of their formal Canonisation; (3) of their Mediatory office; and al in
imitation of the Pagan Demons, their origin, etc.

1. 1. The Origin of Canonised Saints answerable to that of Demons from a fond
conceit of some great excellence in them.
As to the origin of these Canonised Saints, it was, as it has been hinted,
the very same with that of the Pagan Demons, namely from a superstitiose
conceit of some Divine Wisdom, Power, and Excellence in their Ancestors. For
look as in the old World, its infant-state, God vouchsafed several gloriose
Manifestations of a miraculose Power and Providence with his Church and People,
thereby to confirm their Faith and amaze their Enemies; which the Devil in
following Ages endeavoring to imitate by his fabulose Apparitions, and lying
wonders, allured the credulous Superstitiose World into a fond admiration of
their Demon-Gods, their Miraculose Apparations and Power: so in like manner in
the Primitive Churches, Christ vouchsafing a Miraculose Power and Providence to
the first Planters of the Christian Faith; Antichrist in following Ages
affected the like wonder-working Power, and ascribed the same to his Canonised
Saints. 1 Timothy 4.2. (...).
All this seems fully implied in that 1 Timothy 4.2. where having made mention, v.
1. of Antichrist's Doctrines of Demons, which he should introduce into the
Church under his Canonised Saints, he adds v. 2. (...), etc. Speaking lies in
hypocrisy, or through the hypocrisy of liers. These lies which Antichrist
speaks are called, 2 These. 2.9. Lying wonders, or lying miracles; which he
pretendes to work in and by his Demons, or Canonised Saints; and these he is
said to speak, (...), in hypocrisy. The primitive notion of (...), is the same
with (...), a personation, or imitation: so in Plato, (...), an hypocrite, is
the same with (...), an Imitator, or one that personates another. (...)
signifies, (1) to simulate, feign, or counterfeit either a person or thing.
Luke 20.20.
So Luke 20.20. (...), who feigned themselves righteous. Thence (2) to act the
part of another, to imitate, personate, or represent another. As (...), to
represent Nestor. Whence (...), signifies among the ancient Grecians, Histrio,
or Mimus, one that personates or imitates another. Thence also (...), from
(...), signifies an Histrionic Art, the representation or imitation of another
person, the fiction of a person on the Theater or Stage. And this seems the
proper import of it here, 1 Timothy 4.2. Where the particle (...) notes the cause
and manner of the action, and therefore it is rendered by Beza and Schmidius,
per, through the hypocrisy of liers. Which Mede understandes Transitively, and
so to be repeted (...), as applicable to all the following branches; namely,
that through the hypocrisy, simulation, or imitation of liers, of men of
scared Consciences, of those that forbid Marriage and Meats, etc. al those
Demon-Doctrines should be introduced by Antichrist and his Sectators. So that
(...), may be very properly rendered here, in or through Imitation, or
Hypocrisy, as Schmidius and Beza. By which is signified, that they should act
the part of Stage Players, or Mimes, that imitate some other person; and by
their Histrionic or Hypocritic Imitation introduce all the old Pagan
Demon-Doctrines and Superstitions. And so the sense is this: that Antichrist's
Canonised Saints should be introduced into the Church of Christ, in imitation
of the Pagan Demons, by lying wonders, etc. This began about the fifth
Centurie, after the death of Julian the Apostate; though these Saints came not
to be formally Canonised 'til about the middle of the ninth Centurie. We have
the whole of this Mystery of Iniquity excellently unfolded to us, by Mede on
this, 1 Timothy 4.2. Touching the Apostasy of the later times, Edit. 2. page 120.
The Deifying and invocating of Saints, and adoring relics, is the most
ancient for time of all the rest of the Demon Popish Idolatry, and began to
appear in the Church presently after the death of Julian the Apostate: the
grounds and occasions whereof were most strange reports of wonders showed upon
those, who approached the Shrines of Martyrs, and prayed at their Memories and
Sepulchers; Devils charmed, diseases cured, etc. which the Doctors of those
times avouched to be done by the power and prayers of glorified Martyrs, and by
the notice they took of men's devotions at their Sepulchers; though at the
beginning such devotions were directed to God alone; and those places only
chosen for the stirring up zele and fervor, by the memory of those blessed and
gloriose champions of Christ. But while the world stood in admiration, and the
most estimed of these Wonders, as of the gloriose beams of the triumph of
Christ, they were soon persuaded to call upon them as Patrons and Mediators;
whose power with God and notice of things done upon earth, they thought that
these signs and miracles approved. And then he adds, page 121,-123. But here
is the wonder of wonders, that none of these miraculose signs were ever heard
of in the Church for the first three hundred years after Christ. -- But in this
also the Idolatry of Saint-worship was a true counterfeit of the Gentiles
Idolatry of Demons. Did not Demon-worship enter after the very same manner?
was it not first insinuated, and after established by signs and wonders of the
very self-same kind? Whence he adds, page 125, etc. The second particular of
(...), was fabulose Legends of the Acts of Saints and Martyrs. This was also
another means to advance the Doctrines of Demons. For the true acts and stories
of Martyrs being extinguished for the most part, by the bloody Edict of
Dioclesian, they now begin to supply again that loss, by collecting such
tales as were then current of them, and adding such Miracles as were fabled
after their death, fashioned al to the best advantage of what they meant to
promote in the Church, and was already on foot in the same. Revel. 13.15.
Hence Revel. 13.15. it is said, that Antichrist, by his lying wonders and
hypocritic assuming of a Vicarious power from Christ, had power to give life to
the Image of the Best. (...), to the image, i.e. to form an Antichristian
Church, Worship, Ceremonies, and Institutes exactly conformable to the
Demon-worship, Institutes and Ceremonies of the Pagan Best. By all which it is
most evident, that, as face answers to face in the glass, so these Canonised
Saints, their origin from lying Wonders and fabulose Legends exactly answers
to the Pagan Demons, their origin from lying wonders, and Poetic fables. So
that we may safely conclude, according to 1 Timothy 4.2. that the origin of these
Popish Saints, The Canonisation of Saints an Imitamen of the Demon-(...).
etc. was but (...), through the personation or imitation of those liers, who
by their lying wonders, etc. introduced those Gentile Demons and their worship.

2. Having given the original grounds and occasion of Antichrists Canonised
Saints, exactly parallel to that of the Gentile Demons, we now proceed to their
formal Canonisation, to demonstrate how this also was according to 1 Timothy 4.2.
(...), in imitation of that fabulose, lying, Pagan (...), or Deification of
their Demons. And for the clearing hereof we must remember, that though
Antichrist's Demons or Saints had their vital and principal parts formed
betimes, even as soon as he himself received his Spirit, Head, and Power, namely
about the fifth Centurie, as has been proved; yet they came not to be Canonised
Saints, or complete Mediators, til about the middle of the ninth Centurie. For
we must know, that this (...), or Demon worship, introduced by Antichrist, was
opposed in the Eastern and Greek Churches by diverse Emperors, Nobles,
Bishops, and People, from the year 720 til after the year 840. Yea some denied
the title of Saints unto Martyrs: neither could any of the Popes before Adrian,
about the year 880 obtain a fixed Canon for the Canonising of Saints, and
establishing their (...). This has been well observed by a French Author, Traite
des anciennes Ceremonies, page 67. In the year 880, Pope Adrian was the first
who resolved to Canonise the Saints, imitating therein the Apotheoses of the
Romans under Paganism. And that this Canonisation of Saints was indeed the
very same with the Pagan (...), Apotheosis or Deification of Demons, appears
from the very confession of their own Canonists, quoted by learned Bochart, in
his Discourse against Veron, p. 815. The Roman Church has other Gods, the Pope,
the Masse-God, the Virgin Marie; to whom Leo the tenth gives the title of
Goddess; the Angels and all the Saints, who are Gods by participation,
according to the Doctrine of Cajetan: whence it is that the Director of the
Inquisitors calls the Canonisation of Saints, Apotheosis, i.e. Deification.
Wherein note, that Cajetan's Gods by participation, are the very same, both
name and thing, with Plato's (...), made-Gods, which is the title he gives his
Demons. And that this Popish Canonisation of Saints is but (...), a personation
and imitation of the Pagan (...), Apotheosis, is farther evident from the
samenesse of Rites and Modes used both in one and the other. As for the
Demon-Apotheosis we have it mentioned in Plato, Rep. 5. page 469. We consult
the Divine Oracle in what rank those blessed divine men are to be had, and with
what ensigns they are to be honored; and we perform unto them the same honors
which he prescribes, and for the future we serve and worship them as Demons.
And do not the sons of Antichrist take the very same course in the Canonisation
of their Saints? do they not first consult the Pope their great Oracle, and
then according to his Prescript or Canon, worship their Saints? yea, to
demonstrate this yet more fully, it is observable, that the Papists give unto
their Canonised Saints the very same Rites, Ceremonies, and Ensigns, which the
Pagans gave to their Demon-Gods. Thus Bochart against Veron, part. 3. cap. 25.
page 888. They have transferred to their Saints all the Equipage of the Pagan
Gods: to St. Wolfang the Hatchet, or Hook of Saturn; to Moses the Horns of
Jupiter Hammon; to St. Peter the keys of Janus. In brief, they have chassed
away all the Gods out of the Pantheon at Rome, to place in their room all the
Saints: Whose Images they worship with like devotion, as those of the Pagan
Gods sometimes were. They dress them up in apparel, they crown them with
garlands of flowers, they carry them on their shoulders, they bow before them,
they address their prayers to them, they make them descend from Heaven, they
attribute to them miraculose virtues, etc. By which it is manifest, that these
Popish Canonised Saints were introduced by Antichrist (...), as 1 Timothy 4.2. in
an hypocritic lying imitation of the Pagan Deified Demons.

5. 3. The Saints Mediatorie Office in imitation of the Pagan Demon-Mediators.
As Antichrist's Canonised Saints are parallel to the Pagan Demons as to their
origin and formal Canonisation, so in like manner in point of Office, as
Mediators betwixt God and men. This also is implied in 1 Timothy 4.2. (...). i.e.
teaching lying false Saint-mediators, in imitation of the
Pagan-Demon-mediators. We have before Chap. 1.. 3 proved out of Plato and
others, that the great office of the Pagan Demons was to be as Mediators
betwixt the supreme God or Gods, and men; because as Plato affirms, (...), the
supreme God mingles not with men, but by the mediation of these Demons. And
more particularly, he tells us, that these Demons were appointed (1) (...), to
interpret and transport the prayers and sacrifices of men to God, and the
commands and rewards of God to men. (2) That (...), al Divination was from
these Demons. (3) (...), al communion with God was by virtue of these Demons.
(4) To which add, that of Hesiod, (...), Demons are patrons of mortal men. So
Diogenes Laertius, in the Life of Zeno, says, that the Stoics held such
Demons, (...), etc. who had compassion of men, and a very great care of human
affairs. Now do not the Popish Canonic Saints exactly answer to these Pagan
Demons in all these points? Are they not made Interpreters of men's desires to
God, and conveighers of Gods gifts to men? do not these sons of Antichrist, by
virtue of their Saints work Miracles, divine, etc? Have they not al their
Tutelar Saints, or Demons? Lastly, is not al communion betwixt God and men in
the Roman Church transacted by their Canonised Saints or Demons? We have a good
reflection hereon made by judiciose and holy Deering, on Heb. 4 15. The Papists
have learned to make the Saints their Mediators from the Heathens. The Gods of
the Gentiles, which were Devils, had this worship amongst them: the Devils
amongst themselves, they who were reputed of a lower sort were made as means to
come unto the higher; whereof they were called Dii Medioxumi, i.e. Gods only
for intercession. The Gentiles Books are full of Exemples, how these things were
practiced: as if Neptune would speak to Jupiter, he made Mercury his
intercessor. -- And what else do the Papists but teach al their posterity in
choosing many Mediators, to have considence in none, no boldness unto God, etc?
Yea Cardinal Perron observing this ressemblance betwixt the Grecian Demons and
their Canonised, Saints makes use of the former to prove the later. So Bochart
contre Veron, page 883. The Sieur du Perron cites Plato to prove, that the Dead
have care of things here below. These Canonised Saints are also exactly
parallel with the Phenician Baalim (which were the same with the Grecian
Demons) brought into the Jewish Church by Jezebel, and set up as Mediators in
the room of the true Messiah, of which we find a good account in Mede on 2 Pet.
2.1. Diatrib. 3. page 548. The second main Apostasy is called the way of Ahab;
not because he was the first bringer in, but the chief establisher thereof, --
which was to worship Baal-Gods, or Baalim; supposing either by these to have
easier access to the Lord of Hosts the Soverain God; or that these he might
have resort unto at al times for all matters; as being near at hand, and not so
high in dignity, etc. when therefore Christians do worship or invocate Saints
or Angels, whether with Images or without, to be as under-Mediators with God
for them, or of themselves to bestow some favor upon them, those who do this
are fallen into the Apostasy of Ahab. -- Here note, that wheresoever you read
in Scripture of the Idolatry of Jeroboam's Calves, and of Ahab's Baalim,
think of what I have told you, and know that whatsoever God speaks against
those things here, the same he speaks of the Apostate Christians under Rome,
whose case is in all points the same, etc. These Baalim or Demon-Mediators seem
pointed at by Paul, 1 Cor. 8.5. 1 Cor. 8.5. (...).
Lords many. (...) answers to the Phenician (...), Baalim. They derive (...)
from (...), Cyrus, Pers. (...) Coresch; which among the Persians was one of the
greatest Titles of honor, signifying Lord; whereby they called, (1) The Sun,
their supreme Lord: So Plutarch in Artoxerxe, informs us, That the Persians
called the Sun, (...), Cyrus: and so it agrees with the Hebraic (...) Cheres,
which signifies the Sun. (2) Cyrus their great Emperor, who was dignified with
the same title of Honor, as their supreme Lord on earth, and after his death
worshipped by them as a Demon, or one of their Baalim, Mediatorie Lords. Hence
the Exploits of Cyrus being most famous among the Grecians, or else from the
Suns Dominion, (...), signified among the Grecians supreme Dominion, and (...)
supreme Lord, the same with (...) Baal. So that (...) here being of the same
import with (...) Baalim, plainly indigitates the Philosophers Demons, or
Mediatorie Lords, which were the original Exemplars of Antichrist's Mediatorie
Saints. But more expressly Col. 2.8, 9, 10, etc. v. 8. our Apostle gives us an
account of the means by which the Gnostics of that Age, and Antichrist after
them, should introduce these Demon-Mediators, and that is vain Pythagorean
Philosophy; to which v. 9. he opposes Christ, in whom dwells all the fullness
of the Godhead bodily. Col. 2.9, 10, 18, 19
(...), i. e. really, essentially, and perfectly, in opposition to those Demons
or Idol-Gods. Whence he adds, v. 10. And ye are complete in him, which is the
head of al principality and power. i.e. Christ is your complete Mediator, who
is Head or Soverain of al Angels and men, and therefore infinitely above al
tho2e Pythagorean Demons, Gnostic Aeones, and Popish Canonised Saints, be they
what they will. Thence he subjoines ver. 18. Let no man beguile you of your
reward, in a voluntary humility and worshipping of Angels. Which the Gnostics
then, and Antichrist since introduced, placing Angels as Mediators in the room
of Christ. So it follows, ver. 19. Not holding the head. i.e. They who are
guilty of this Angel-worship do thereby disclaim Christ, who is the only
Mediator and Intercessor to the Father. By which Prophetic discovery the
Spirit of God does fully strike thorough al those Demon-Saint-Mediators, which
Antichrist by his Ecclesiastic Canons has introduced and placed on Christ's
Throne. It would be an endless thing to enumerate al those Canonised Saints,
which Antichrist has by his creative power erected as Mediators, in imitation
of the Pagan Demons: I shall yet mention one or two of the chiefest. The supreme
and head of al Antichrist's Canonic Saints is the Virgin Marie, who passes
amongst his Sons for a Deesse or Godesse, yea they seem to lay more stresse
upon her Mediation and Intercession than upon Christ's. This our blessed Lord
foreseeing seems to give a tacit check unto, in not admitting her to be an
Intercessor here on Earth, in a small and trivial case. So Joh. 2.4. Joh. 2 4.
What have I to do with thee, O woman, etc.? Christ denies her Mediation and
Intercession in a trifle, thereby to rebuke those fond conceits, which he
foresaw Antichrist would in following times insinuate touching her prevalence
and Intercession with himself. Another great Saint-Mediator is Peter; to whom
they give the Keys of Heaven. But we find Paul to put a stop to this Idolising
humor, as much depressing him as Antichrist exalts him. Yea indeed nothing is
more injuriose to those blessed Spirits than to attribute to them a Mediatorie
Office. Whence the Spirit, of God calls this, blasphemy against those heavenly
inhabitants, Revel. 13.6.
Rev. 13.6. And them that dwelt in heaven; i. e. says Mede, (in his Clav.
Apocalyp.) against Angels and men, by Demon-worship. And indeed what greater
contumely or blasphemy can there be cast forth against those glorified
Spirits, than to place them in the room of Pagan Demons, to occupy and
possess the Mediatorie Throne of their dearest Lord, whose glory is so dear
unto them? Certainly Antichrist will never receive thanks from them for this
pretended favor, but real blasphemy against them.

SECT. III. That Antichrist's (...) is but an Imitamen of the Philosophers
(...), demonstrated from the several parts thereof.
. 1. Antickrist's Canonic (...) an imitation of the Pagan (...). 1 Timothy 4.1, 2.
WE have hitherto treated of the Origin, Canonisation, and Mediatorie Office
of Antichrist's Canonised Saints, and proved, that al was but, as 1 Timothy 4.2.
(...), a personation or imitation of Pagan Demons: We shall now proceed to
discourse more professedly and particularly of Antichrists Canonic (...),
Saint-worship, with endeavors to prove, That al is but, (...), a Mimic
imitation of Pagan (...), Demon-worship. And to make our way hereunto clear, we
shall lay down these two Premunitions. (1) That the formal constitution, or
essence of Antichrist's Apostasy lies in Idolatry. (2) That this
Antichristian (...), Saint-worship, is really Idolatry.

First, The essence of Antichrist's Apostasy in Idolatry. Revel. 17.5. The
Mother of Harlots. Why Antichrists Idolatry is styled Adultery.
That Antichrists formal Idea or essence consistes in Idolatry, is evident by
those Characters which are given him in Scripture. Babylon his royal feat, is
called, Rev. 17.5. The mother of Harlots; and so elsewhere the great Whore,
etc. Now this is the usual Character of Idolaters in the Old Testament, as Hos.
2. And there is much reason why Antichrist's Idolatry, as al other, should be
expressed under this Symbolic image of Adultery. For Believers in regard of
their Consciences are looked upon as the Spouse of Christ. So 2 Cor. 11.2. I am
jealous of you, etc. wherefore to submit the Conscience to any but Christ, is
according to Divine estimation spiritual Adultery. This is the case of
Antichristian, as of al other Idolatry, which cuts the bond of Communion
betwixt Christ and any Church, as Adultery does the Marriage bond betwixt
Husband and Wife. This is well observed by Mede on 2 Pet. 2.1. Diatrib. 3. page
554, 555. As a Wife who has given her faith to one Husband, if she commits
adultery with others, denies him to be that she calls him, though she call him
her Husband never so much; so the Church, the Spouse of Christ, if she bow down
her self to other Mediators, she commits spiritual adultery, i.e. Idolatry,
and denies the Lord that bought her, 2 Pet. 2.1.
as here 2 Pet. 2.1. That this should be the meaning here, let this one reason
serve the turn, that this is always the meaning of the like phrase in the Old
Testament; where instead of the Lord that bought them, we have the Lord that
brought them out of the land of Egypt. So Deuteronomy. 32.15. Judge. 2.12. Psalm. 81.10,
11. -- The Holy Ghost places the essence and soul of the great Apostasy,
under the Man of Sin, in Idolatry and spiritual fornication: other Errors or
Heresies, how gross soever are but accidental to that great Apostasy: even as
Whores have usually other faults, which yet are no parts of Whoredom; so has
the spiritual Whore many other Heresies, but her Whoredom is Idolatry.
Idolatry is the only character and note, whereby the great Apostasy of the
visible Church is distinguished from al other blasphemies and heresies of what
age soever. The same he adds, Diatr. 4. page 254. Babylon is not called the
Liar of Babylon, the Tyrant of Babylon, the Heretic of Babylon, the murderer
of Babylon; but the Whore of Babylon. -- Now if the Church of Rome be not an
Idolatresse or spiritual Whore, prostituting her self to other Gods, to Stocks
and Stones, and many ways breaking her faith to her one Lord and Mediator
Christ Jesus, by committing fornication with I know not how many other
Mediators, there never was a Whore in the World. And certainly if the Church of
Rome may herein be justified, the Church of Israel had but hard measure to be
condemned for spiritual Adultery or Idolatry. This also is well observed by
Mestrezat, de l' Eglise live 2. c. 4. Idolatry cuts the bond of Communion
betwixt the Creature and the Creator, in the same sort as Adultery does the
Mariage-bond, etc. And there is yet a farther mystery in this name of the
great Whore of Babylon, Rev. 17.5. Mystery, Babylon the great, mother of
Harlots. Revel. 17.5. Babylon the great. 2 These. 2.7.
(1) The first part of this Antichristian Name is Mystery, which denotes, that
her Apostasy is a Mystery of Iniquity, as 2 These. 2.7. i.e. [1] A profound
infinite Golphe or Abyss of al manner of Iniquity. So Josephus speaking of
Antipater the Son of Herod, a most wicked wretch, says, That man erres not,
who affirms, that the life of Antipater was (...), a mystery of iniquity.
Of which more hereafter, S. 4.. 2. [2] This Antichristian Whore is said to have
Mystery written on her forehead, in that al her Doctrines and Superstitions
were but a mysteriose hypocritic Imitamen of Demon-Doctrines and Superstitions,
under the masque and vizard of Christianity. Thence the Antichristian Best,
when he came upon the Stage, appeared in the form, not of a Dragon, as the
Pagan Best, Revel. 12.7. but of a Leopard, Romans 13.2.
or Panther, Rev. 13.2, which by his sweet smell and beautiful color allures al
Bestes to it. And it is said, Rev. 13.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. that Antichrist had
two horns like a Lamb, [ i.e. like Christ] and did wonders, and deceived men,
etc. and all this in a mystery, or under a semblance of being Christ's Vicar;
though indeed he gave life to the Image of the Best; i.e. revived all the
Demon-worship of the Pagan Best. And to decipher this Mystery of Antichrist,
what Joseph Scaliger mentions on Revel. 17.5. is worthy of particular remarque:
Mr. de Montmorency being at Rome, when they spoke freely of the Pope, was told
by a Father of good repute, that on the Frontal of the Pope's Mitre was writ in
letters of Gold, MYSTERIVM; which title was since altered by Julius, as that
which demonstrated this name, Revel. 17.5. to belong to him. But then, (2) Why
is she called Babylon the Great, etc? Why, we must know, that she is called
Babylon the Great, in the same respect that Nimrod is called a mighty hunter,
Genesis 10.9. i. e. in regard of tyrannic usurpation: for look as old Babel was
the first seat and pattern of ambitiose usurpation and tyranny under Nimrod;
so the Roman Church, which is here named spiritual Babylon, is the seat of
Antichrist's tyrannic Usurpation and Domination. But this is not al. (3) There
follows another part of her name, that is, the mother of Harlots, etc. Herein
also this Antichristian Whore imitates old Babel, which we know was the first
foundresse of Idols and Demon-worship or Idolatry which is spiritual
Adultery. And has not Rome exactly answered her pattern, old Babylon, in
Spiritual fornication or Demon-Idolatrie? So that we see this Mystic name of
the Whore of Babylon contains two parts. [1] Spiritual Usurpation. [2]
Spiritual Fornication, or Idolatry: and al in imitation of old Babel's
tyrannic Usurpation and Idolatry. And it is farther worth our observation,
that these two have usually by a secret judgment of God gone hand in hand; for
when Gods people will serve other Gods or Mediators, God in righteousness
leaves them to fall under the Tyranny of other Lords. This is Gods regular
course to punish Idolatry with slaverie, as Mede has well observed on Jer.
10.11. Diatr. 2.

2. Rev. 13.1. The name of Blasphemy.
Another name given to Antichrist, whereby his Apostasy is notified to us, is
Blasphemy; so Rev. 13.1. and upon his heads the name of Blasphemy. That this
name of Blasphemy is here given him to signify his Idolatry and
Demon-worship, is evident from the usual Phraseologie of Scripture, which
frequently expresses Idolatry by this name of Blasphemy. There are three
words in the Hebrew by which Idolatry is signified unto us, al which the LXX
and Vulgar Latin render Blasphemy. Ezech. 20.27.
(1) Ezech. 20.27. your Fathers have blasphemed me: the Original (...) garats,
signifies Idolatry. (2) Esa. 65.7. And blasphemed me: Isa, 65.7.
the Hebrew (...), which answers to the Greek (...), as Theodotion
translateth it, signifies also to play the Idolater. (3) Another word, whereby
Idolatry is signified, is (...), which signifies properly to provoke to wrath
by reproaches and contumeliose words; and therefore it is rendered by the LXX,
(...). It is used to express Idolatry, Deuteronomy. 31.20. (...). Deuteronomy. 31.20.
And indeed the very thing speaks so much; for what greater reproach or
blasphemy can there be against God, than to attribute that Mediatorie glory
to the Creature, which is due only to Christ, (...). Farther, that this name
Blasphemy given to Antichrist is a signal distinctive character of his
Idolatry, is apparent from the several branches thereof, Revel. 13.6.
mentioned verse. 6. where the general name is distributed into three severals,
each of which implies Idolatry. (1) He is said to blaspheme the name of God:
i. e. by (...), Image Worship. (2) His tabernacle; i.e. the human nature of
Christ, by worshipping his breaden God Transubstantiated. (3) The heavenly
Inhabitants; i. e. Angels and Saints, by (...) and (...), Demon and Saint
worship. As Mede, Clav. Apocalyp. on this place. By all which it is evident,
that the formal reason, essence, and soul of Antichrists Apostasy consistes in
Idolatry.

A second thing to be premissed is, that Antichrists (...), 2 Antichrists (...)
is really (...).
Saint-worship, is really Idolatry, yea the chiefest part of (...),
Demon-worship. This follows upon what has been already laid down, and will
farther appear from what follows: we have it proved at large by Mede in his
Apostasy of the later times, on 1 Timothy 4.1. page 44,-49. where he proves, that
the Holy Ghost places the essence of the Antichristian Apostasy, not in every
error or heresy, how foul soever, Saint-worship an imitation of Pagan (...),
Demon-worship.
but in this (...), Idolatry, etc.

Having laid this basis we shall now proceed to the Demonstration of our
Hypothesis, namely, That all that (...), Saint-worship, which sils up a great
part of Antichrist's Canonic Theology, was but (...), an Imitation, or
Imitamen of the Pagan (...), Demon-worship introduced by that man of sin. I
find a good general account hereof in Mede, his Apostasy of the later times,
on 1 Timothy 4.1. page 40,-42. The Doctrines of the Demons comprehended in most
express manner the whole Idolatry of the mystery of iniquity, the Deifying
and Invocating of Saints and Angels; the bowing down unto Images; the
worshipping of Crosses, as new Idol-columns; the adoring and Templing of
relics; the worshipping any other visible thing upon the supposal of any
Divinity therein. -- I must confess, I cannot think of this Demon-ressemblance
without admiration; specially in that the advancers of Saint-worship in the
beginning did not only see it, but even gloried, that they had a thing in
Christian-worship so like the Doctrines of Demons. Thus many of the Fathers, as
Eusebius, Theodoret, etc. Wherein we have several branches of this
Demon-worship and their Origin: of which more particularly hereafter. We have
also a good account of this Demon-worship, and the manner how it at first crept
into the Christian Church, in that great French Divine Morelius, Traite de la
Discipline, live. 1. chap. 5. page 22. Moreover this good Emperor Constantine,
making use of his coactive power, constrained every one to make profession of
the Christian Religion; whereby, instead of an infinity of Christians which he
hoped to make, he made an infinity of Hypocrites: who first under the Empire
of Constance his Son, who became Arian, conforming themselves to his pleasure,
followed for the most part, as it usually happens his error: and afterward
under Julian returned again to their vomit of Idolatry. Since that time,
albeit the people under the good Emperors made some semblance of Christian
Religion, yet were there very few who truly embraced the same. For by reason
of the defect in good Discipline, the precedent Idolatries were mixed with
Religion; 1. The Commemoration of Martyrs at their Graves by Panegyrics and
Temples from Demon-Panegyrics and Temples.
and the people brought in their spirit the conception of their Idols into the
Temple of the Lord, imagining Jesus Christ to be as one of their Heroes,
Demons, or Semi-Gods: unto which corruption all the evils that followed owe
their origin, etc. But to come to Particulars.

1. The first great piece of (...), Demon-worship introduced by Antichrist,
which makes a great part of his (...), is the solemn commemoration of deceased
Martyrs, and Saints at their Sepulchers, with the building and consecrating of
Temples in the same places. And this indeed is most easy to demonstrate;
namely, that al those Funeral-Orations, or Sermons, and al those consecrated
Temples, which Antichrist by his Canonic Law erected and dedicated to his
Saints, were but (...), an imitation of the Doctrine or Canon of Demons,
according to 1 Timothy 4.1, 2. For the clearing whereof we are to remember, that
all the Pagan Demons being but the souls of men deceased, they supposed these
Ghosts did still frequent those places where their bodies lay buried; and indeed
it was usual for the Devil, their great Demon, to appear and exhibit his lying
wonders in such places, thereby to gain credit to his petty Demons. Mark 5.2, 3.
So Mark 5.2, 3. these Demons or unclean spirits are said, to dwell among the
Tombs. Whence the Pagans sinding some Diabolic Presences and powers of these
Demons at their Graves and Sepulchers, they there built Temples to them, where
their bodies or ashes lay buried. So Plato Rep. 5. p. 469. speaking of their
Demons, says, (...), and we will worship their Shrines. And elsewhere he tells
us, That they had their yearly Funeral Orations and other Commemorations of
their Demons at their Sepulchers. Whence the Primitive Fathers, which writ
against the Heathens, do often upbraid them, That their Temples were nothing
else but the Sepulchers of dead-men. We have a good observation hereof in
Ludovicus Vives, on Augustine de Civ. lib. 7. cap. 34. The Religion of
Sepulchers, says he, is most ancient; whereby it was prohibited for any to
violate, throw down, or break them: which Law was not only in the twelve
Tables, and amongst Solon's, but also in the most ancient Laws of Numa, and of
both Latins and Greeks: which seem to belong not so much to the Civil Law as
the Sacreds; because Sepulchers were estimed as Temples of their Manes or
Demons: whence there was inscribed on them D. M. S. i.e. Diis Manibus Sacrum:
and the Sacreds which were performed to them were called Necia. We have this
well given us by Mede, Diatrib. 3. p. 545. Another way (says he) to worship the
Baalim or Demons was in Religiose Graves and Sepulchers, for there they hoped
to find their Ghost Gods; specially seeing, as we yet suppose, that spirits
frequent Churchyards and places of the dead. Thus in his Apostasy of the
later times, page 22. ( Edit. 2. 1644.) citing those words of Plato, (...), as
the Coffins of Demons, he tells us, That Plato would have the Shrines or Coffins
of his Canonised Demons worshipped. So Clemens Alexandr. Strom. 6. out of whose
words he observes, That the Heathens supposed the like presences and powers of
Demons at their Coffins and Sepulchers, which was exhibited in their Images; as
though there always remained some natural tie between the Souls deceased, and
their Relics, and therefore they builded Temples unto them, where their
bodies and ashes were entombed; and hence it is that the Primitive Fathers so
often upbraided them, That their Temples were nothing else but the Sepulchers of
dead men. Thus we see what the Pagan (...) was, as to the worshipping these
Demons at their Graves and Sepulchers. Now that Antichrists worshipping of
Saints at their Graves was but an imitation hereof, is evident. Indeed this
piece of Saint worship began very early, even in the second Centurie in some
degree, as we find it in a French Treatise, Traite des Anciennes Ceremonies, on
the year 160. Amongst the Greeks they celebrated yearly the memory of the
Heroes, those illustrious persons who died in the defense of their Country;
and this solemnity was performed at their Graves, thereby to animate the
survivant, and to encourage them to the like exploits. The Christians imitated
this exemple, judging it would prove a means very proper to induce many persons
to suffer death for the Gospel. After this there was a custom introduced to
make an yearly Commemoration of the combats and constance of the Martyrs, on
the same day in which they suffered death, and at the same place where they
were buried. Whence it came to pass, that the Cemeteries, or Church yards,
became the ordinary place of their Assemblies: for these annual Commemorations
were very frequent, by reason of the great number of Martyrs. Though as yet we
find no mention of any consecrated Temples or Holy Days dedicated to Saints,
nor in some following Centuries. I find the like observation in Mede, Diatrib.
3. page 613. The leaders of the Primitive Church, however they acknowleged
their liberty in choosing any place where they would for the worship of God,
yet they used to select for their Assemblies such places as God had any way
dignified, either by some work of mercy, or the gloriose sufferings of his
Martyrs; whereupon the most ancient Momments of the Christian Churches do
mention the Assemblies of Christians in coemeteriis martyrum. That this
superstitiose usage was taken up in imitation of the Gentiles solemn
Commemoration of their Demons celebrated at their Graves and Sepulchers, is
farther evident by what we find in Tilenus, Syntag. part. 3. disp. 10. Those
solemn Panegyrics of the Ancients at the Graves of the Martyrs, and their
Assemblies in those places, although at first they were instituted with no il
intent, yet have they eventually almost ruined the Church; and as they were
brought into the Church in imitation of the Pagans, so have they by little and
little been infected with Ethnic pollutions and Idolatry. We find the like in
the Nonconformists Admonition to the Parliament in Queen Elizabeth's Reign,
where they plead for the taking away of Funeral-Sermons, because they were
taken up in imitation of this piece of Demon-worship. This also has made some
Reforming Christians declare against Popish Temples, because consecrated to
Saints in imitation of the Demon Temples, erected at the Sepulchers of their
dead bodies. Though these beginnings of Saint-worship at the Sepulchers of
Martyrs had their foundation in the second and third Centuries, yet they came
to no perfection til about the year 600, when Gregory the first, setting
Saints in the place of Demons, dedicates Temples to them, etc. which was
afterward confirmed by the Canon of Pope Adrian, who Canonised the Saints about
An. 880. Yea these Popish Commemorations, and Dedications of Temples unto
Saints at their Sepulchers, seem to have had the very same origin with the
Demon-Commemorations and Temples. For what made the Pagans place so much
Religion in the Sepulchers of their Demons, but a superstitiose presumption,
(grounded on diabolic apparitions at such places) of some extraordinary
presence and power of their Demons at their Sepulchers? And did not the
sabulose Monks coin many strange stories, of Wonders wrought upon those who
frequented the Shrines of Martyrs, and made solemn Prayers and Commemorations
at their Sepulchers? Did they not make the Superstitiose people believe many
lying Wonders of Devils charmed, and Diseases cured, etc. by the Prayers of
glorified Martyrs, upon notice they took of men's Devotions at their Sepulchers?
Do not the Papists at this very day, specially on their Feste of Al-Saints,
pray at their Sepulchers and Graves? What more exact (...), or imitation could
there be of Demon-superstition?

2. 2. Popish Festivals, Hymns, Plays, etc. from Demon-worship.
Another piece of Pagan (...) introduced by Antichrists Canon Law, under the
form of (...), takes in all those Canonic Festivals, Hymns, Plays, and other
solemnities performed on certain Holy Days, consecrated and dedicated to their
Saints. I have before observed out of Plato, that it was the custom of the
Heathens to celebrate yearly the Commemoration of their Demons on certain days
dedicated to them, and that by Panegyric Orations, Hymns, Plays, and
suchlike solemnities: These Days they reputed very holy; whence Pythagoras
(as Jamblicus relates) required that on such Holy Days they cut not their
hair, nor pair their nails. Plato, Repub. 5. page 468. gives an excellent Idea
of these Pagan Rites, which appertained to their Demon worship: (...), etc. For
we in Sacrifices and suck-like Assemblies shall honor good men [or Saints made
Demons] so far as their merits shall appear, with Hymns, and that kind of honor
whereof we even now spoke, namely with the dignity of seats, and flesh, and
full cups; i.e. libamens. Then he adds, page 460. Therefore we will consult the
Oracle of God, in what rank those blessed and divine men are to be had, and
with what ensigns they are to be honored, -- and for the future we will worship
their Shrines as Demons, etc.

1. That all the Popish Holy Days were but an (...), or personation hereof, I
think will not need much proof more than a parallel. We shall mention only their
Festival of Epiphanie, which was but a Transcript of the Pagan Epiphanie.
Antichrists Epiphanie front Pagan Epiphanie.
For we must know that these Demons had their (...), Epiphanies, or Apparitions
to their Devoti, (in imitation of Gods Apparition to Jacob, as we have proved,
Court Gent. Part 1. B. 2. Chap. 7.. 8, etc.) which days the Heathens made
Sacred. This Feste the Sons of Antichrist transfer to the Apparition of the
Magi, and call it by the same name, Epiphanie. Of which we have this excellent
account in Isaac Casaubon, Exercit. 2. An. 1. Number. 36. Baronius erres, in that
he judges, that the Epiphanie was instituted, in the Primitive times, in
Commemoration of the Magi, their Apparition. This opinion is refuted first by
the very Appellation of Epiphanies, and thence by the use of Authors and
History. The Appellation (...), of Epiphanies was brought into Ecclesiastic
observation, from Pagan Rites on a pious account. Greek Writers call (...),
Epiphanie, the Apparition of a Deity, whatever the manner were, by which such
a Deity was supposed to have given some sign of his presence. So Diodorus, l.
1. says, that Isis was wont to appear by night, and to inject dreams, (...),
giving manifest Indices of her presence. And Dionysius Halicarn. often uses this
word, and somewhere greatly reprehendes such as (...), derided the Epiphanies
of the Gods, by which they manifest themselves to men. The Grecians, in
Commemoration of these Ephiphanies, or Apparitions of their Gods, instituted
certain Festival-dayes, which they called (...), Epiphanies. So Athenaeus
relates of King Demetrius, that he, (...), celebrated the memory of his dead
brother, whom he worshipped as one of the Celestial Divi, and called the day
Epiphanie. According to this Ethnic Exemple, in the ancient Greek Churches,
they had their (...), Epiphanies, wherein they solemnised the Day, not of the
Magi their coming, but of our Lords Nativitie. For his very Nativitie is called
(...), Epiphanie, by Suidas, Eusebius, and others. Thus also Schmidius, on Mat.
2.1. (...), Epiphanie, signifies an illustrious Apparition. This name was fixed
in the Greek Church on the sixth day of Januarie. Neither was the name
Theophanie, which signifies the Apparition of God, or the Gods, unusual even
among the Gentiles; which one of the Popish Monks not understanding, as it is
reported, he said, Perhaps this Theophanie, or Epiphanie was the Nurse of
Christ.

2. As the Pagans had their Holy Days dedicated to their Demons, 2. Popish
Hymns from Demon-Hymnes.
so also Sacred Hymns, whereby they sung their Praises, and solemnised their
Memorials. So Plato Rep. 5. says, That the Commemoration of their Demons was
celebrated with Hymns. Thus the Greeks had their solemn Hymns, called (...),
which they sung to their propitious Demons. So Bacchus had his (...),
Tragedies, and (...), Comedies: the former so called from the sacrifising a
Goat; the later, in that they were sung in the Villages, answerably to the
Popish Wake-songs. The Romans also had their Assamenta, or peculiar Hymns sung
to some private God, as their Assamenta Janualia, Junonia, Minervalia, etc. And
are not those Hymns, which the Sons of Antichrist sing to their Canonised
Saints on their Holy Days, an exact (...), or Imitamen of these Pagan Hymns?
etc.

3. 3. Popish Plays, and Mummings from Demon-Playes, etc.
The Pagans had also their Plays, which were a part of those Solemnities they
performed to their Demons on their Holy Days. So August. de Civit. l. 8. c.
26. I omit, says he, what Varro says, that al those dead Demons were estimed
Gods; and he proves it by those Sacreds which were performed to al those dead
men; where he mentions Funeral Plays, as though this were the greatest note of
Divinity; because Plays were not wont to be celebrated to any but Gods. He
says also, that this dead Demon was worshipped at the place where his
Sepulcher stood. And what are all the Popish Masks, Mummings, and al such
superstitiose plays, by which they solemnise the memory of their Saints on
their Holy Days, but Imitamens of these Demon-playes?

4. 4. Popish Festes from Demon-Festes.
The Pagans had their Festes, by which they solemnifed the memorial of their
Demons on their Sacred days. And have not the Superstitiose Sons of Antichrist
their Wakes, Revels, and other Sacred Festes, whereby they celebrate the
memorial of their particular Saint, answerable to, and in imitation of these
Demon-Festes. This indeed was commun amongst the Superstitiose Christians in
Augustins time, who, de Civit. l. 3. c. 27. makes mention of some, that brought
their Banquets to the Graves of the Martyrs, and then returning again fested
upon the same, in Commemoration of those Martyrs. Thus we have shown, what an
exact parallel there is betwixt Antichrists Holy Days, and al his Festivals,
Hymns, Plays, and other Solemnities performed to his Demons. By which it is
evident, that the former were but Imitamens of the later.

And to speak a little of the manner of the derivation, we must know, that
these Festival Solemnities had some foundation in the later end of the second
Centurie; for the Christians, living then under Pagan Persecution, were wont to
make Annual Commemorations of the sufferings and constance of the Martyrs, on
that very day on which they suffered Martyrdom, thereby to encourage others to
the like Christian sufferings and constance; and all this in imitation of the
Pagans Panegyric Commemorations and Festival Solemnities, which they vouchsafed
to their Heroes and Demons. But yet still these Primitive Christians meddled not
with those Idolatrous Rites, which the Pagans used in such Solemnities: neither
were those Festival days and Commemorations made Sacred or Canonic in the
second or third Centurie. But after Constantin had constrained al to make a
public profession of Christianity, and Julian had revived the old
Demon-worship, the carnal professors of Christianity, who were most numerose,
though they were content to assume the name of Christians, yet were they not
content to part with their Pagan Rites and Customs: wherefore to comprimise
the matter, they turn their Pagan Rites into Christian Solemnities; and so
Christen their Demon-Festivals under the name of some Christian Martyr and
Saint. And that which made this design more plausible was this, some
groundless hopes, by such symbolisings with the Pagans, to gain them over to
the embracing of the Christian Religion: which vain attemt was so far blasted
by God, as that it proved but a door to let in Antichrist and al his
Demon-worship into the Church of God. Yet these Demon-Festivals, or Holy Days
dedicated to Saints, came not to be established by Antichrists Canon Law, 'til
about the beginning of the seventh Centurie, under Gregory the first; who
placing the Saints in the room of the Pagan Demons, dedicates to them Temples
and Holy Days, etc. Yet were there not wanting some who opposed these
Demon-Festivals: yea the whole Council of Antisiodorense in France (Canon 74.)
declare, That it was not lawful to observe the Festivals of the Gentiles, to
keep their worship and observation of their Calends, to adorn Houses with
Laurel and green Bays; (at Christmasse) for all these practices (says the
Council) favor of Paganism. Thus much for Antichrists Canonic Festivals, which
he introduced as a main part of his (...), in imitation of the Demon-Festivals,
as 1 Timothy 4.1, 2. and Col. 2.16. In respect of an holyday. Which strikes as well
against Antichrist, as the Pythagorising Gnostics, and their Impositions.

. 3. As Antichrist has his Canonic Plays and Days, 3. Al Idol-worship from
Demon-worship.
so also his Images, Crosses, Relics, and other Idol-representations of his
Saints, and al in imitation of the Pagan (...). This also seems fully implied,
1 Timothy 4.1, 2. (...), The Doctrines of Demons, in Imitation, etc. i. e. al
Antichrist's (...), Idol-worship, (which takes in a great part of his (...)) is
but an Imitamen of the Pagan (...).

1. 1. Popish Images from Pagans.
One chief part of this Antichristian (...) is their (...), Image Worship,
which we need no way dout, was but (...), an Imitamen of Pagan Images or
Representations of their Demons. For the more full explication whereof we are to
remember, that howbeit some of the vulgar Heathen (as some Papists still do)
might worship the Images of their Demons as Gods; yet the wiser of them,
specially the Philosophers, were not so grossly stupid, as to conceit those
Images to be Gods: no, they looked upon them only as Demon-traps or lures to
allure their Demons to be present; or as Bodies which their Demon-Ghosts
informed and influenced. So Plotinus, Enn. 4. l. 3. c. 11. page 380. (...),
etc. And truly those Ancients seem to me wise, who desiring the presence of
the Gods, framed Sacreds and Statues, directing the eye of their mind toward
the nature of the Universe, etc. Whence he shows, That their (...), Image,
being erected, the Deaster or Heavenly Demon, to which it is dedicated,
presently descendes unto it, and informs the same, as the species or image of
the Sun does a glass held Diametrically opposite thereto. For (adds he) there
is nothing in nature, but there is some Heavenly power answerable thereto,
(according to that Oriental maxim, (...), whence there being in the matter of
the Image some ressemblance of that Divine Power, unto which it was erected,
hence there arises a relation between them, etc. We find this mystery well
opened to us, by August de Civit. Dei, lib. 8. c. 23. Hermes the Egyptian, whom
they call Trimegistus, says, that some Gods are made by the great God, and some
by men. He assertes, that visible Images are as the Bodies of the Gods, and
that these Bodies are informed by Spirits invited thereunto, which have power
to hurt men, or to fulfill their desires, who give them the Obsequies of Divine
honor and worship. Therefore to copulate or conjoin, by a certain art, these
invisible Spirits to visible Images made of Corporal matter, which are as it
were living bodies dedicated and subjected to these Spirits; this is (says he)
to make Gods: which great and wonderful faculty of making Gods men have
received. So again, August. Civ. l. 8. c. 24. A Demon being chained to an Image
by a Diabolic art is made a God, etc. These Images stood usually in their
Temples, where they had a chair of state placed for them. So Plato lib. 5. de
Repub. tells us, That they allowed their Demons Royal seats, etc. Now that all the Popish Images dedicated to their Saints were taken up in imitation of these
Demon-Images, is very apparent. This Mede, on the 1 Timothy 4.1. (touching the
Apostasy of the later times, page 22, etc.) proves at large, viz. That the
worshipping of Images is by its original a piece of the Doctrine of Demons,
etc. Yea it is farther evident, that the very original ground or end for which
the Sons of Antichrist have brought in this Demon (...), Image Worship, into
the Church of Christ, is the very same with that on which the Pagan
Philosophers at first took it up. For what made those blind Heathens at first
erect these (...), Images? was it not a sense of their Demon-God being absent?
with which the Prophet upbraides those Demon-Friests of Baal, 1 King. 18.27.
For we must know that the wisest of them, their Philosophers, supposed the main
residence of their Demons to be in the Stars; whence they called them (...),
Deasters: as they supposed their supreme God to have his residence in the Sun,
which they termed (...), the Divine body of their supreme God, styled Moloch,
Saturn, Jupiter, Apollo, or suchlike. Now they finding these Planetary Demons
very remote, they erected (...), Idols or Images, to allure them to their
Temples, and receive their Influences, as Glasses do the Image of the Sun. And
was not the origin of the Popish Images the very same? were they not at first
introduced as Symbols and pledges of their Saints presence? As the Golden
Calfe, Exodus 32.1. and Jeroboams Calves were pretended pledges of Gods
Presence. Do not the Papists vouchsafe their Saint-Images chairs of state in
their Temples, and costly apparel, with supplications to them, etc. exactly
conformable to the Pagans Demon-Images? hoping by such superstitiose honors to
gain the presence, attention and intercession of their Saints. It Is true, this
(...), Image Worship, being such an apparent gross Imitamen of (...), could
not for a long time after the rise of Antichrist gain the privilege of Canonic
Constitution: for it was opposed in the Eastern Greek Churches by diverse
Emperors, with the greatest part of their Bishops and People, from the year 720
'til after 840, as Mede in his Apostasy of the later times, page 131, etc.
Amongst these Popish Images we may reckon al their lesser Representations or
Images of their Saints, which they wear about their necks, or carry in their
Pockets, as their Agnus Dei, etc. answerable to the superstitiose Teraphim, and
the Pagan (...), Diana's Shrines, and the like.

2. 2. Popish Crosses Imitamens of the Pagan Columns.
Another fort of Popish Idols, or Idolatrous representations of their
Demon-Saints are their Crosses, erected in Highwayes, as memorials and
remembrances of some Saint, which also are but (...), an imitation of those
Pagan Baetylia, Columns, Pyramids, and Pillars of stone, which they erected as
memorials of their Demons, and their Apparitions. The most ancient of these
Demon-columnes were their Baetylia; whereof Sanchoniathon, in his Phenician
History gives us this account, according to the Version of Philo Byblius, in
Eusebius, Praep. Evang. (...), The God Vranus conceived the Baetylia, when he
had framed the living stones. Learned Bochart, Geogr. S. par. 2. l. 2. c. 2. p.
785. for living, reads anointed stones; Genesis 28.18, 19
and makes these Baetylia to be an Imitamen of Jacob's anointed stone, Genesis
28.18, 19. Which he erected as a memorial of Gods Apparition to him. This rite
the Idolatrous Phenicians transferred to their Baalim or Demon Gods, as a
Commemoration of their Apparitions. Dent. 16.22.
These Sacred Columns the Greeks call (...); So they render (...), Lev. 26.1.
Deuteronomy. 16.22. Here God forbids them to erect these Stela's or Columns; because
they were abused by the Pagans to Demon-worship, as Mede on this place. They
had also their (...), etc. which Clemens makes to be Imitamens of the Pillar of
Cloud, that went before the Israelites in the Wilderness. Now all the Popish
Crosses, and Fillars, which they erect in places most notable, are but corrupt
Imitamens of these Pagan Columns. Thus Mede proves, Apost. lat. page 48, 49.
That adoring Crosses came in the room of the Demons Idol-Columnes, etc. Yea
it is very evident, if we compare the origin both of one and the other: For as
the Pagan Columns were erected as memorials of their Demons, (...),
apparition, etc. So these Crosses were erected by the superstitiose Sons of
Antichrist, as memorials of their Saints, their famous acts done in such or
such places. 3. Templing of Relics.


3. Under this head of Popish (...) we may reckon also the Templing and
superstitiose Adoration of Saints Relics, with which the Roman Church
aboundes, and wherein they do but play the Apes or Mimes of Pagan Idolaters;
who had a very great respect for the Relics of their Demons: Of which see
Mede, Apost. lat. page 40, 42. So Traite des Ancien. Ceremonies, on the year
160, having showed how the Christians imitated the Pagans in the Commemoration
of their Demons, he adds: They had then a great care first to bury their
Martyrs; and where they could not recover the body entire, they endeavored to
gather up the least pieces, if the rage of persecutors had left any restes, or
relics. Now these Relics were buried honorably, without those practices,
which have since happened, etc. namely for the Templing and adoring of
Relics. This is well explicated by Cassander, that learned and moderate
Papist, in his Consultation, Art. 21. touching the veneration of Relics: In
these things, says he, abuse by little and little crept in. For Basil in
Definit. Latior. c. 40. complains, that the custom of holy men was corrupted.
-- And it is evident, that in aftertimes there was too much attributed to the
Relics and Memories of Saints. -- There happened also other Evils, namely
that out of Avarice to delude the simple people, false Miracles were coined and
cried up, whereby the superstition of the people was nourished; so that they
were more ravished into an admiration of the Miracles, than provoked unto an
imitation of the Saints, or unto an emendation of life: sometimes also by the
crast and illusion of Satan, abusing the superstition of men, new Relics were
reveled, whereby also Miracles seemed to be wrought. Hence that Lugdunense
Decree, c. 62. Let not Prelates suffer the people to be deceived by vain
figments, as for profit sake it is wont to be. Also many are found, who make
gain of the Saints Relics, whether true or false, so that they are
everywhere carried about by vile and vagrant men, like the Sacreds of Isis,
and are commended by many lies to the ignorant people. Whence he concludes,
That feeing al are full everywhere of the Relics of Saints, it is to be
feared, that if Princes and Prelates would inquire into them, great numbers of
them would be found to be impostures and cheats. Thus we have shown how al
these Antichristian Images, Crosses, and Relics, which fill up a great part of
their Canonic Theology, are but (...), in imitation of Pagan (...), as 1 Timothy
4.1, 2.

. 4. Another piece of Antichrists Canonic (...), Anticlrists Sacrifices from
Demon Sacrifices.
consistes in those Sacrifices and Offerings, which he brought into the Church,
(...), in imitation of those Sacrifices the Pagans performed to, and by their
Demons. We have shown before out of Plato, that one great office of the
Philosophers Demons was to conveigh men's Sacrifices to the supreme God, thereby
to render them the more acceptable; and do not the sons of Antichrist transfer
their Sacrifices to God by their Demon-Saints? But further, the Pagans had
peculiar Sacrifices which they offered to their Demons. So Plato, Repub. 5.
page 468. tells us, That herein they followed the Authority of Homer,
worshipping these Demons in their assemblies by sacrifices of flesh and full
cups, etc. And we have this expressly mentioned in Scripture. So Numb. 25.2,
3. where Israel is said, Number. 25.2, 3.
v. 2. To bow down or worship before the Gods of Moab, with their sacrifices:
and v. 3. particularly, Israel is said, to join himself to Baal-Peor. Again,
Deuteronomy. 32.17. it is said, They sacrificed to Devils, or Demons. And that this is
meant of these Deisied Baalim and Demon-Gods, is evident by David's
Explication, Psalm. 106.28.
Psalm. 106.28. where he says, They joined themselves to Baal-Peor, and ate the
sacrifices of the dead. By Sacrifices of the dead, is evidently meant, those
Sacrifices they performed to their Baalim or Demons, which were but great
personnages Deified after their departure out of this world, as Mede, Bochart,
and Diodate have observed. Now that Antichrist's Sacrifices are but (...), a
personation or imitamen of these Sacrifices, which the Pagans gave their dead
Heroes or Demons, will be evident by the following parallel.

1. 1. The Sacrifice of the Mass an Imitamen of Demon Sacrifices.
The great Sacrifice which the sons of Antichrist so much adore is that of
their Mass; or Hostie, as they call it, wherein they sacrifise and eat their
Breaden God, in Commemoration, as they fancy, of Christ's Sacrifice on the
Cross. Yet really it is no other, but an imitamen of those Heathenish
Sacrifices of the dead, Psalm. 106.28. Though we must acknowledge, that in this
piece of Blasphemy against the Body of Christ mentioned Rev. 13.7. these
Papists have much exceded the Philosophers (...), Demon-worship, or Sacrifices.
For those devote Heathens had more honor for their Demon-Gods, than after they
had made them such to eat them presently, as the Papists eat their Breaden God,
which is a piece of Idolatry so monstrose, that Averroes himself abhorred it,
Anima mea sit cum Philosophis. Mat. 24.26.
crying out, That he had rather his soul should be with the Philosophers, than
with such as did eat their God. This Idol-Christ seems Prophetically struck at
by our Lord, Mat. 24.26. where he tells us, that some should pretend their salse
Christ to be, (...), which we translate, in the secret Chambers; but it is more
properly rendered by the French, es ciboires, i.e. say they, in the Cabinets,
wherein meat is preserved: and so it properly denotes the Priests Pixe, or
Cabinet, wherein he lays up the Hostie, or Breaden God. And thus indeed (...)
in its primary notion importes, namely a secret place or Cabinet, wherein any
provision is laid up: whence also (...) signifies a Dispensator, or Steward
that lays up, and bringes forth, as need requires, provisions, etc. Thus our
Omniscient Lord foreseeing how much these sons of Antichrist would blaspheme
him, by pretending the Transubstantiation of the Bread, that Sacred Symbol,
into his body, and idolising the same, he gives this general premonition to al
Christians, Not to believe those Antichristian Priests, who pretend to have
Christ, (...) in their Bread cabinets, or Pixe, wherein their Hostie lies hid.
And O! what a world of contradictions lie involved in this Sacrifice of the
Mass? Is it not an high contradiction to pretend, that the quantity of the
Bread should continue without the substance? Do not al Philosophers now grant,
That Quantity is not really distinct, much less separable from the body it
appertains unto? See the Contradictions that attend this Popish
Transubstantiation well demonstrated by Derodone, in his Funeral of the Mass.
And as many Contradictions, so also many ridiculous absurdities attend this
Sacrifice of the Mass. We find this well described by Learned Bochart, in his
Conference with Veron, part. 3. chap. 24. Paragr. 122. page 1292. In this
Masse-Sacrifice what a world of ridicules are there? the Priest makes his
reverences to the Altar, kisseth it, sprinkles Incense on it on solemn days,
to chasse away the Devils: He runs on the right hand, and then on the left; and
anon turns toward the people; after he turns his back, he bows himself, and
then lifts himself up: he raises, and then lets fall the tone of his voice; he
beats his breast, he groans, he joines his hands, and crosses his thombes; he
closes and then extendes his arms; he makes many signs of the Cross in the
air; he seems to sleep, and then in a moment to awake; he shows his God in one
hand over his shoulder, then hides it, and again lifts it up with both hands
over his head; and after he has played with it, he eats it. Thus Bochart. Who
in what foregoes, Paragr. 15. of the same Chap. 24. page 1140. says, That
hence it comes to pass, that the Priests vante, how they create their Creator.
So Gabriel Biel, on the Canon of the Mass, Lect. 4. He that has created me,
has given me leave (if it be lawful to speak it) to create him. And in the Book
called Stella Clericorum, the Priest is named, the Creator of his Creator, etc.
This indeed excedes in some regards the Pagan (...), though it were originally
an (...) thereof, as 1 Timothy 4.1, 2.

2. The Cup in the Lord's Supper turned by the Papists into a (...). 1 Cor.
10.21.
Another part of the Pagans Demon-Sacrifices takes in their Libamina, or
Drinke-Offerings. So Plato in (the forementioned) Repub. 5. page 468. says,
They worshipped their Demons with full Cups. So Jer. 44.18. we read of
Drinke-offerings to the Queen of Heaven. But more expressly 1 Cor. 10.21. we
read of (...), Cup of [ Devils, as we render it, but it is better rendred]
Demons; i. e. those Drinke-offerings they offered up to Demons, as Mede,
Apostasy of later times, p. 29. The Pythagorising-Gnostics symbolised with the
Pagans in partaking of their Demon-cup, or Drink offerings. And do not the
Papists come under this very condemnation? don't they turn the cup of the Lord
into a Demon-cup? Surely this Popish Sacrifice of the Mass made up of their
Breaden-God and Wine-God equaliseth, if it does not excede, the Table and Cup
of Demons, which our Apostle strikes at, 1 Cor. 10.21. and therefore comes
under the same sentence.

3. Popish Tenths and Offerings in imitation of the Demons.
The Heathens (in imitation of the Jews) had their Tenths, and other kind of
Offerings, which they conferred on their Demons. So Tertullian, Apol. cap. 14.
says, That the Carthagineans paid their Tenths yearly to Hercules, who was
their chief Demon, and of Phenician extract. And Diogenes Laertius tells us, in
the life of Solon, That the Athenians separated their Tenths for public
Sacrifices. And are not the Tenths, which the sons of Antichrist pay unto him
their great Demon the Pope, an exact (...), or Imitamen of these Demon-Tenths?
Again, the Pagans had several other Offerings which they conserred on their
Demons, when they drew near to their Temples and Altars. And do not the sons of
Antichrist, when they draw near to his Demon-Table or Altar (as the Apostle
calls it, 1 Cor. 10.21.) give their Offerings to Antichrist, and their other
Demon-Saints, exactly conformable to the Pagans Offerings to their Demons? Thus
we see how Antichrists S crifices are al, as 1 Timothy 4.2. (...), in imitation of
Demon-Sacrifices.

. 5. Another part of Antichrists (...), is his Exorcisme, 5. Popish Exorcisme
and lying Wonders from Demon lying Wonders.
Sorcerie, and power of working wonders, which he pretendes unto and claims,
as a privilege appendent to his Chair, as successor of Peter, but indeed had
its origin from Pagan Divination and Sorcerie. That this also may be gathered
from Paul's character of Antichrist's (...), 1 Timothy 4.1, 2. seems probable from
Grotius's explication of these words; 1 Timothy 4.1, 2.
who understands them of the Pythagorean Magicians, amongst whom Apollonius
Tyanaeus was chief; 'Who (says he) came to Ephesus while Timothy lived, and
is here in a particular maimer denoted. Though we have no show of reason to
restrain this famous character of Antichrist, with Grotius to Apollonius
Tyanaeus, or with Hammond to Simon Magus and his Gnostic Disciples; yet thus
far we may yield to these learned men, that these famous Pythagorean Magicians,
as they were forerunners of Antichrist, may be allowed some room in this Text.
For look as Apollonius Tyanaeus was by reason of his Demoniac Wonders, made by
the Pythagoreans and Platonistes, Porphyrie, etc. a counter Christ, or equal to
Christ, as also Simon Magus by the Gnostics; so the great Roman Antichrist has,
by his lying Wonders, Sorcerie, and Exorcisme or Devil-chassing power, made
himself a corrival with Christ. This seems farther evident from v. 2. (...),
speaking lies in Hypocrisy, or (as the proper idiome of the word inclines) in
imitation. And so the meaning will be this, All the lying Wonders, Exorcisme, or
conjuring power, which Antichrist shall, by his Ecclesiastic Canons, bring into
the Church, are indeed but an Imitamen of the Pythagorean Sorcerie, and Magic
Arts, which they, (...), by virtue of their Demon Theology and power pretend
unto. Of which see more Book 1. Chap. 3.. 9. That the Pythagoreans were great
Magicians and herein types of Antichrist's Exorcistes, appears farther from
what Grotius observes on Ephesians. 4.15. (...), Ephesians. 4.14.
etc. We are to understand, says he, that these men acted very cunningly, and
that from an art of seducing, which they received from the Devil. The
Pythagoreans are chiefly indicated here, of whom the most part were Magicians.
That Magic Arts were much exercised at Ephesus, appears Act. 19.9. Thus
Grotius, whom I cite only for this, to show that the Pythagoreans, Apollonius
Tyanaeus, etc. were great Sorcerers, and so herein Forerunners of Antichrist,
whose sons glory in nothing more, than in their lying Wonders, whereby they
make good their Fathers Prophetic character. 2 These. 2.9.
2 These. 2.9. he says, They should come, (...), by lying wonders, which yet
they impose on the simple people as Divine Miracles. This Wonderworking Power,
which the Popish Exorcistes pretend unto, is also a part of their (...). For
(as we have observed before Sect. 2.. 4, 5. of this Chapter) these lying
Wonders were first brought into the Church by the fabulose Monks, immediately
after Julian the Apostates death, who coined many lying reports of Wonders
wrought at the Shrines and Sepulchers of the Martyrs, which they pretended to
be wrought by the Intercession of those glorified Martyrs, upon notice taken by
them of men's devotion at their Sepulchers. Whence Antichrist, when he came to
the stature of a perfect man of sin, appointes by his Ecclesiastic Canons
certain Exorcistes in his Church, for the continuation of this Wonder-working
Power, which he at first received in imitation of the Pythagorean Magicians,
and still exerted by virtue of compact with, and assistence from the Devil that
great Demon. And as the Popish Exorcisme in general, so particularly al their
lesser spells, for the chassing away of Devils, the healing of Diseases, etc.
seem to be but derivations from, and Imitamens of Demon-Magic, practiced by the
Pythagoreans and others. So Bochart against Veron, part 3. page 888. tells us,
That in the Popish Church they make use of the sign of the Cross to chasse
away Devils, in imitation of that we find in Ovid. lib. 3. de Fast. 'Signaque
dat digitis medio cum pollice junctis
'Occurrat tacito ne levis umbra sibi.
Baronius acknowlegeth, That the Agnus Dei, which they hang about their necks,
is made alike to those bulls or boulets of Wax, which they hung about the
necks of Children to defend them from charm. So Aelian tells us, That the
Egyptian Priests hung about their necks, (...), a little image of Saphir,
whereby they divined, etc. unto which the Agnus Dei, which the Papists make so
great use of as an universal spel, seems to answer. And the Jesuits generally
have some spel or other hanging about their necks or elsewhere.

. 6. 6. Invocation of Saints from Demon-Invocation.
But the great and masterpiece of Antichrists Saint-worship is his Invocation
of Saints, which fills up a good part of his Canonic Theology, and is indeed
but (...), an imitation of the Pagan (...), Demon-worship. That Invocation was
a chief part of that worship which the Pagans performed to their Demons, is
evident by what Clemens Alexandrin. Strom. 6. mentions of these Demons: Which,
says he, they made Temples unto, placed their Images therein, and called on,
etc. This is farther evident by what we have before cited out of Plato, who
makes it one main office of the Demons, to transfer men's Petitions to God. So 1
King. 18.20. Baal's Priests are said, to cry aloud to their Demons. And
Christ, Mat. 6.7. bids us, Mat. 6.7.
not to use vain repetitions, as the Heathens do. For the Heathens would repete
over their Demon's name, on whom they called, an hundred times. (...), Ye shall
not use vain Repetitions. (...) is deduced from (...), which some derive from
(...), Bata, to blaterate or babble. Hesychius with others make this Battus to
be a Lybian King, who stammered, and thence often repeted the same syllable:
others make Battus to be a certain Poet, who writ many Hymns, in which the
same things were repeted. But al grant, that (...) is the same with (...),
which follows in our Lords admonition, Mat. 6.7. So Casaubon, Exerc. 14. Sect.
8. 'In Battologie there are two vices, (1) vain Repetition of the same words.
(2) Multiloquie, or much speaking. And herein both the Pagans in their
Demon-worship, and the sons of Antichrist in their Saint-worship, have been
greatly guilty. As for the Heathens we find in Aeschylus an hundred times over
such vain Battologies as these: (...), etc. Io, Io, Io, etc. So (...), etc.
Phy, phy, etc. And have not the sons of Antichrist in imitation of the Pagans,
assumed the like Battologies in their Saint-worship? How often do they repete
their Ave Maria? so in their Psalterie they repete the name Jesu 15 times
together: as Jesu, Jesu, Jesu, etc. The Athenian Philosophers, who were
according to Paul's character (...), Act. 17.22. had their (...), consecrated
places, where they worshipped and invocated their Demons. So Act. 17.19. we
read of (...), Mars's Page, Well, or Column, where he was invocated; for (...)
comes from (...), a fountain; whence they who drank of the same Well were called
Pagans. Now that the Popish Invocation of, or praying to their Saints, is but
an (...), imitation of the Pagan (...), is largely proved by Mede on this 1 Timothy 4.1, 2. Apost. lat. Times, page 31, 32, etc.

. 7. Many Popish Rites and Ceremonies which they derived from the Pagans. 1.
Their Holy Water, and other Purisications.
There were many other Ceremonies used by the Pagans in their (...),
Demon-worship, which Antichrist has since reassumed, thereby to complete his
Prophetic character, 1 Timothy 4.1, 2. (...), etc. (1) The Pagan Philosophers,
specially the Pythagoreans, (who were (...)) had their Purisications,
Purgatories, and Washings, (as before Part 2. Book 2. Chap. 6.. 8.) whence the
Pharisees seem to have traduced their Purifications and Washings, as Christ
hints to us, Mark 7.2, 3, 4. And did not al Antichrists Purifications and
sprinklings of holy water receive their origin from this Pythagorean fountain?
2. Their Sacred fire.
(2) The Pagans had their Sacred sire, which the Grecks called (...), (as some
think from (...)) and the Latins Vesta. This they honored as a God or Demon;
so Stobaeus, Sermon. 3. (...), honor or worship Vesta: and for the conservation
of this Sacred fire in their Temples they had their Vestal Nuns, whose office
it was to preserve the same. And has not Antichrist the very same Sacred fire,
which is always burning in his Temples, and sed by Tapers, Lamps, etc? Yea,
has he not also his Covents of Nuns, whose main office it is to conserve this
his Sacred sire, and other Pagan Rites?

(3) The Pagans had Sacred Groves and Trees which belonged to their (...). 3.
Their Sacred Groves and Trees.
So here in Britannie the Oak was estimed most holy by the Druides; whence
according to Pliny, l. 16. c. 44. they were called Druides, (...), from an
Oak. And has not Antichrist his Sacred Groves and Trees in Churchyards, etc?
Deuteronomy. 16.21. God forbad the Jews planting Groves of Trees about their Altars,
because these were usual amongst the Gentiles.

(4) Another piece of Pagan (...) was their Ceremony of bowing and worshipping
toward the East. 4. Their bowing toward the East.
For the Pagans universally worshipped the Sun as their supreme God, even the
more Reformed of them the new Platonistes, Plotinus, Porphyrie and Julian the
Apostate, as it appears by his Oration to the Sun. Whence it came to pass,
that the Sun rising in the East, they usually worshipped that way: (as the Jews
in Babylon usually worshipped toward the West, because Jerusalem stood west
thence.) Hence also they built their Temples, and buried their dead toward the
East. So Diogenes Laertius in the life of Solon, says, That the Athenians
buried their dead toward the East, the head of their Graves being made that
way. And do not Antichrist and his sons exactly follow this Pagan Ceremony in
building their Temples and high Altars toward the East, and in bowing that way
in their worship?

(5) The Godfathers conferring gifts on the Baptized Insant, and al such gifts
brought to women in childbed are supposed to have flowen from the Heathens,
specialty the Grecians, who observed the fifth day for the purification and
naming their Children: on which day the neighbors sent in gifts called munera
natalia.

(6) We might add also al Antichrist's distinctive Garments, 6. Al distindive
Garments.
as Surplices, Gowns, Hoods, Caps, etc. which are but (...), an imitation of
Demon-Ceremonies as hereafter. Apulcius says, l. 11. Miles. That the Priests
of Isis were clothed with a white linen garment. And Herod. l. 2. acquaints
us, That the Egyptian Priests used a white linen Vestment as most pure. The
like we have proved of the Pythagoreans, P. 2. B. 2. C 6.. 8. But at present we
shall content our selves with a few Observations out of learned men. Bochart
against Veron, Part 3. Par. 84. Chap. 23. having given us the mention of
several Pagan Rites taken up by Antichrist, (of which before) he adds; from
the same Pagan source comes their holy water, their Tapers, their Incense,
their extreme unction; for all these were in use amongst the Pagans. Also their
baptising of Bells answers to the Pagan Tubilustrium, i. e. the purification
of Trumpets; their Canonisation, to the Apotheosis; the spittle which they use
in Baptisine is taken from that of Persius, Satyr. 2. Lustralibus ante salivis
expiat, etc. Baronius, on the year 44. Number. 88. makes a long list of those
Ceremonies which the Church has borrowed from the Pagans. The French Author,
des Anciennes Cerem. page 24. gives us an account how these Pagan Ceremonies
crept into the Christian Churches. He had shown before, That there were some
rudiments laid in the second and third Centurie. But, adds he, about the year
300, and since prosperity produced many Ceremonies. -- The people (from
Constantin's compulsion) presented themselves in troops to crowd into the
Church: but the simplicity of Christianity disgusted many, who retained
before their eyes the pomp and magnificence of Paganism: wherefore it was
thought expedient to clothe Religion with more splendid Ceremonies, that so the
splendour of these Ornaments might render it more august and recommendable. And
to accommodate themselves to the Jews and Gentiles, who talked of nothing but
Sacrifices, the Christians gave to the Lords Supper the name of Sacrifice, and
to the Table the name of Altar, though not in that sense the Papists now give.
The same Author acquaints us, that the body of these Ceremonies came not to be
formed into a complete Systeme of Canonic Rites 'til about the year 600, under
Gregory 1. So Traite des Ancien. Ceremon. page 59. The most notable
changement, says he, which happened in Religion, was about the year 600. Those
times were already very tenebrose; Gregory the first was then Bishop of Rome,
who set up the Saints in the place of Gods, dedicating to them Temples, Festes,
Sacrificators. Now according to the measure, that new Doctrines or new
Ceremonies were introduced, the form of Divine service was also changed. Til
now Liturgies had been always different, etc. But Gregory undertook to melt
all the Formularies of the Church; he changed and adjousted or adjoined many
pieces; and out of this Melange or mixture he composed the Office of the Mass,
almost in the same form as it stands at this day. Though we must acknowledge
with this Author, that these Antichristian Ceremonies were not formed into a
body, and imposed on al as matter of Ecclesiastic conformity 'til about the
year 600 under Gregory, and his successor Boniface the third, who obtained the
title and dignity of Universal Bishop; yet we are also to know, that there was
a very heavy yoke of Pagan Ceremonies imposed upon the Roman Churches, and some
other in the foregoing Centuries, specially about the year 410. by Innocent the
first, who brought in the worshipping of Relics, the erecting of Altars, and
offering of Sacrifices at the Graves of Martyrs: who also secretly permitted
the superstitiose people at Rome to worship their Demon-Gods. Under him also
the legenda aurea, or fabulose narrations of Miracles wrought at the Graves of
Martyrs, received a great composure. He also it was that framed many
Ecclesiastic Canons for Fastes, Abstinences from Meats, prohibition of Marriage
to Presbyters, and many Monastic Orders, (as Platina;) not to mention his
expelling the Novatians (those godly Reformers) from Rome, Excommunicating the
Emperor Arnadius, affecting an Universal Primatic in the Church, and Secular
Domination, as Socrates the Scholiast and Antichristi, Excidium Praefat. de
Innocentio 1, etc. And Augustine, who was Contemporary with this Innocent 1.
complains, That Ceremonies were grown so numerose and burdensome, as that
they well nigh exceded the yoke of the Jewish Ceremonies. Thus we have shown
how al Antichrist's Saints and Saint-worship is but according to what was
foretold of him, 1 Timothy 4.1, 2. Demon-Doctrines, Canons, and worship, (...), in
imitation of the Pagan, (...), or (...), Demon worship.

8. Another part of Antichrist's Canonic Law comprehendes al those Ecclesiastic
Abstinences, Fastes, bodily Severities, Al Antichrists Canonic Fastes and
Abstinences from Demon-worship.
and other Purgatories, which he enjoines his sons, by virtue of his Canonic
Supremacy. This also had its origin from the same fountain of Pagan (...),
according to that discovery which the Apostle makes thereof, 1 Timothy 4.3. (...).
1 Timothy 4.3. He having made mention of Antichrist's Demon-Dogmes, or Canons in
general, ver. 1. and then given the source or root of al, v. 2. (...), speaking
lies, or lying wonders in imitation of the Pagans lying wonders, which they
attributed to their Demons, and made the foundation of their Demon-worship; v.
3. our Apostle descendes to some particulars of these Demon-Dogmes or Canons,
which Antichrist should introduce; whereof this is one (...), to abstain from
meats. That those who were the great devoti and worshippers of Demons, were
also greatly addicted to superstitiose Abstinences from flesh, etc. has been
before once and and again observed. And herein none more exact than the
Pythagoreans, (who were also followed herein by the Pharisees as before) whose
Infusions were first sucked in by the Gnostics, those forerunners of
Antichrist, and after reassumed by Antichrist himself. And our Apostle Paul,
having by the spirit of Prophetie, a prevision of the dangerous consequences
which would ensue upon these Pythagorean Abstinences, and their establishment
in the Churches of Christ, gives many severe Prohibitions against them. So Col.
2.16. Let no man judge you in meat and drink, etc. Col. 2.16.
These Canons for Abstinences Grotius conceives to belong more peculiarly to
the Pythagoreans, than to the Jews. For, says he, to abstain from Wine was
not perpetually a Jewish injunction, but in some few only; but frequent amongst
the Pythagoreans. The Jews abstained from some Meats, but the Pythagoreans from
many more. And this he lays down more Categorically and Positively, on ver.
20. They are, says Grotius, Ver. 20, 21.
called the Rudiments of this world, because commun to the Gentiles with the
Jews: for there is nothing in these Rites proper to the Jews; yea they seem
to proceed rather from the Gentiles to the Jews, than from the Jews to the
Gentiles. So again on v. 21. Touch not, taste not. Tertullian denies, that
these words belong to the Jewish Canon. He seems to me to use words commun,
which should comprehend both Jews and Philosophers, specially the
Pythagoreans. These Pythagorean Canons or Dogmes touching Abstinence were
greedily embraced, first by the carnal Gnostics, and after them by the sons of
Antichrist, according to our Apostles prediction in 1 Timothy 4.3. And that al
Antichrist's Canons for Abstinence and Fastes were indeed a part of the
Doctrines of Demons, which he by his lies and Pagan imitation brought into the
Temple of Christ, see Mede on this Text, Apostasy of the later times, from
Page 141, to 152. Edit. 2. And to speak a little of the time When, and the
mode How these Pagan Abstinences crept into the Churches of Christ: If we may
speak the truth, there was some foundation laid for these Popish Fastes and
Abstinences even in the beginning of the second Centurie, as it is well observed
by the Author of Traite des Ancien, Ceremon. page 6, 7. About the year 110,
(says he) there was introduced the diversity of Junes, or Fastes, not as a
Canon whereof the observation was necessary, but only by custom, proceeding not
from any public Authority of the Church, but from the simplicity of private
persons. The custom was then in the most part of the Churches to keep their
Assemblies for the Celebration of the Sacraments and public Prayers on
Wednesday and Friday; and for the better disposing themselves unto the due
performance of their duties they fasted on those days. -- From the same root
sprang the observation of Lent, which began only with the observation of a few
days before Easter, set apart as preparatory to that work. Yet these Fastes
and Abstinences were not made Canonic, 'til the Monastic life began to be in
fashion. The same account he gives of the Popish Vigils, or Watches: In time of
Persecution the Christians often assembled in secret, and by night; and so when
they came to enjoy peace they retained the same custom. Thence we read, that
Constantin continued the Sacred Vigils even unto day, and caused Torches to be
lighted throughout the City, and Lamps in the places where they kept their
Assemblies. -- Yet these Vigils and Tapers were then without superstition. So
the forenamed Author, page 29. About the year 320, together with the Monastic
life there entered the rules for Abstinence: for until this time the Fastes
were left free and indifferent. At this time therefore, inasinuch as the
profession of Monks ought to consist in a more severe life than that of
others, there was imposed on them certain Canons for the regulating of
Fasting-daies, etc. As for the Monkish Abstinences, we have spoken thereof
before in the beginning of this Chapter, S. 1.. 1.

. 9. Popish Monastic life another part of the Doctrines of Demons. 1 Timothy 4.3.
We find another Species of Pagan (...) introduced by Antichrist into the
Church of Christ, 1 Timothy 4.3. (...), forbidding to Marie. i.e. Antichrist
should under a pretext of lying devotion, by virtue of his Canonic Supremacy,
institute several Orders of Monks, imposing on them certain Canons or Rules of
Monastic life, (...), in imitation of the Pagan (...), exactly answering in
this particular. That the Doctrines of Demons was greatly advanced by these
Monastic Orders and Rules, Mede proves at large from this Text, in his
Apostasy of the later times, page 141, etc. I come now (says he) to the last
description of the means, whereby the Doctrine of Demons was to be advanced,
viz. through the hypocrisy of such as forbid Marriage, etc. 1 Timothy 4.3. To
which we may add what he page 97, etc. mentions touching Antichrist, from Dan.
11.37. Not regard the desire of Women: Dan. 11.37.
By Desire of Women, which the Roman Antichrist of that time should not regard,
as he was wont, is meant desire of Wiving, expressed Genesis 2.24. And it might in
this place have been rendered desire of Wives, as well as desire of Women: for
there is no other word used in the Original for Wives above once or twice in
the whole Scripture, but this (...). The like use we find of the word Desire,
Cant. 2.16, and 6.3. and 7.10. Ezech. 24.16. That al Antichrist's Canons for
Monastic life and Orders are but Transcripts or Copies of those Institutes,
which Pythagoras imposed on his Collegiates in order to then Monastic life, we
have in part already proved, S. 1.. 1. of this Chapter, by a parallel drawn
'twixt one and the other. But to give a more full demonstration hereof, we shall
add the consent of Learned men hereto, with the time and manner how these
Monastic Constitutions, Canons and Orders were introduced. As to the first,
that the Pythagoreans were under a very severe prohibition against Marriage,
etc. appears by that great Pythagorean Canon, Colos. 2.2. (...), Col. 2.21.
handle not. This, says Grotius, refers to the avoiding of Women, which the
Jewish Priests sometimes did, but the Pythagoreans always. But learned Bochart
against Veron, part 3. chap. 25.. 4. Art. 1. proves, That the Law or Canon of
Celibat is the Doctrine of Devils, 1 Timothy 4.1, 3. which was wel-nigh stablished
throughout Paganism, then when Christ came into the world. There were some
Priests who castrated or gelded themselves, as those of Cybele, or of Phrygia,
who were called Galli and Archigalli; and the Megabyzes or Megalobyzes, Priests
of Diana at Ephesus, and the Therophantes at Athens. In brief, the Celibat of
Priests was in such estime amongst the Pagans, that Aeneas in Virgil, Aen. l.
6. passing through the Elysian fields, which they make to be Paradise, saw no
other Priests there, but such as had passed their life in Celibat. There has
been also a number of Philosophers, who have contributed to this Error. This
was one of the superstitions which Pythagoras brought out of Egypt, whence
returning unto Greece, he forbad Marriage to those of his Sect, and constituted a
Cloister of Nuns, over which he placed his daughter. Plato held the same
opinion, as also Heraclitus and Democritus, and Zeno the Prince of the Stoics,
who never approached to a Woman. By which it is apparent, that Antichrist's
prohibition of Marriage and Monastic Constitutions or Canons are but (...), an
imitation of the Pagan Celibat and Monastic Rules. That the Popish Nuns are but
Imitamens or Apes of the Pythagorean Nuns, seems evident from their origin and
office, as described, Traite des Ancien. Ceremon. An. 240 Lo the origin of
these Virgins: The Persecutions of those times obliged Christians not to engage
themselves in the world more than need required: Now in as much as Marriage often
hinders the liberty of this profession, many Virgins took up a resolution,
with the advice and consent of their Parents, to live in perpetual continence,
and so to join themselves more strictly to Christ, (according to Paul's
Counsel, 1 Cor. 7.40.) Thence they presented themselves to the Church, who
recommended them to God by solemn prayers, that they might take care of the
poor and sick. Yet were not these Vows of Continence estimed then irrevocable;
though afterward they were, in imitation of the Pythagoreans, etc.

But to proceed to the origin of these Monastic Constitutions and Canons,
stablished by Antichrist as part of his Demon-Theologie; The origin of
Monastic Constitutions.
it cannot be denied but that there was some foundation laid for Monastic life
about the middle of the third Centurie after Christ, though it is as certain,
that Celibat or Monastic life was never stablished by any Ecclesiastic Canon,
or judged necessary 'til Antichrist came to some Head and Supremacy. This is
well observed by the Author of Traite des Ancien. Ceremon. page 28. In time of
Persecution many Christians avoiding that tempest retired themselves into
deserts, etc. When the Persecution ceased, there were not wanting some who
having turned this solitude into habitude, continued and passed the rest of
their days there; either because accustomed to such a mode of life; or because
the simplicity of it was more agreeable to them than the noise of the Towns; or
because they feared subsequent storms. But others afterward, even in the midst
of peace affecting such a solitary life, made that voluntary, which was
before necessitated by reason of Persecution. And from hence sprang the origin
of the Monastic life, the first foundations whereof were laid in Egypt, about
the year 300, by Antonius; which were afterward extended even unto Syria, by
Hilarion; unto Armenia by Eustachius; unto Greece by Basil, unto Italy by
Ambrose. By which (as also by what we have before mentioned S. 1.. 1. of this
Chapter), it is evident, that this Monastic Celibat and Constitution began in
Egypt, at Alexandria, where was then the most famous Schole in the world for
Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy. For here the great Ammonius, Plotinus,
Porphyrie, and the rest of those Pythagorising Platonists, were bred up; who
were great Patrons of (...), Demon worship; and particularly of Celibat and
Monastic life; for which Pythagoras laid down such severe Institutes and
Canons, as Plato after him. Now Origin having been bred up in this same Schole
of Alexandria together with Plotinus, under the famous Ammonius, (whom some
take to be a Christian) he drank such full draughts at this fountain of
Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy, as that being made drunken therewith, and
thence forgetting himself to be a Christian, he at last drank in also much of
their (...), Demon-superstition and dregs; and amongst other
Demon-superstitions this of Monastic life and Celibat; which the Monks his
Successors, communly called Origenists, received from him as a foundation for
Antichrist to ground his Demon-Canons upon, according to 1 Timothy 4.3. as before
in our account of Origin, B. 2. C. 1. 8, and C. 2. S. 1.. 1. Thus we see how
Antichrists Canonic Constitutions for Monastic life, received their foundation
in the Schole of Alexandria from the Greek Fathers, Origin, etc. their
symbolising with the Pythagorising Platonistes in Demon Theology. And here
it is very observable, that the first entrance of Celibat and Monastic life into
Britannie was by Pelagius the Britan, that eldest son of Antichrist; who having
traveled unto Egypt, and there confirmed himself in his Pelagian Infusions, by
conversation with the Origenistes, he was by them also initiated in the Orders
and Rites of Monastic life, which he brought back with him into Britannie. For
before the return of Pelagius, Britannie knew not what belonged to
Superstitiose Monachisme, as Balaeus de Script. Brit. Cent. 1. c. 38. Yet we
must remember, that though Monastic life was introduced into these Countries by
Pelagius, and embraced by some, it was not however brought under any Canonic
Constitution 'til Augustine the Monk, that great (...) of Antichrist, his
entrance. So ^alaeus de Script. Brit. (...) came into England with Augustine
(...) and the Canonic Regulars with Birinus, (...) So again, Cap. 97. of Centur.
1. Until Augustine the Monke's entrance the Apostolic Monks in Britannie had
liberty of Marying, according to the exemple of Paulus Antonius, Hilarion,
Macdrius, Jerome, and other pious Hermites, who led a Monastic life in the
deserts of Egypt and Palestine, yet freely and without any prohibition against
Marriage. By which it is evident, that albeit some pious persons might affect
solitude and Monastic life in the third and fourth Centuries, yet there was no
prohibition of Marriage or Canonic Constitution of Monastic life 'til Antichrist
came to maturitie.

. 10. Al Antichrist's Works of Supererogation, Satisfactions, Merits, Al
Antichrists works of Supererogation and Merits parts of Pagan (...).
and other pieces of Will Worship, may deservedly be reckoned as a part of his
(...), Demon-worship, which he, by virtue of his Canonic Supremacy, stablished
in his Church. Plato, Repub. 5. p. 468. speaking of the Deisication of their
Demons, makes them to be originally nothing else but Good men, or Saints, whose
merits were maenifest, etc. And whence sprang al Antichrist's Merits and
Satisfactions, which he ascribes to his Saints, but from these Demon-merits?
And this indeed seems to be implied in our Apostles character of Antichrist his
Demon-Theologie, 1 Timothy 4.1, 3. For what design could Antichrist have in
Canonising of Saints, forbidding of Marriage, enjoining of Abstinences, 1 Timothy
4.1, 3.
and suchlike bodily mortifications, but thereby to fill up his Treasury of
Supererogations, and Merits, which he by his Indulgences would dispense forth,
according to his Soverain pleasure. This seems more fully hinted, Ver. 7.
in what follows v. 7. where he exhortes Timothy, and in him al Christians, to
shun (...), profane and old wives fables. (...) is a word much used amongst the
Philosophers, specially the Pythagoreans, who were great Mythologists; under
which they comprehended most of their Moral precepts or Canons: and it seems to
be used here by our Apostle to signify those fabulose mortifications and
bodily severities, which the Gnostics then, and the Monks afterward brought
into the Churches of Christ, for the filling up Antichrists Magazeen of
Supererogations and Merits. And that this is the true meaning of the words,
seems evident from what follows in the same verse. But exercise thy self to
Godliness. (...). Godliness is opposed here to (...), fables, before
mentioned. As if he had said, instead of these Pythagorean fabulose
Mortifications, which the Gnostics now, and Antichrist by his Monastic Canons
hereafter, will bring into the Church of Christ, I exhort thee and al Christians
to exercise your selves in true Gospelmortification and spiritual Godliness;
which though it has not those Supererogations, Satisfactions and Merits, which
Antichrist's bodily mortifications pretend unto, yet it is far more profitable
in all regards, both as to this life and that to come. And that this is the
genuine sense of the words appears from what follows, v. 8. (...), etc. For
bodily exercice, Ver. 8.
etc. Bodily exercice here signifies the same with, or is exegetic of old wives
fables, v. 7. i.e. Al those Pythagoric fabulose Abstinences, 1 Timothy 4.9.
Purifications, Severities, and other externe mortifications, which the
Pythagorising Gnostics then, and the Antichristian Monks since have foisted
into the Christians Canon. The word (...) signifies primarily, an exercice in
the Gymnade, which was greatly in use amongst the Grecians: it is also
sometimes used to express intellectual and moral exercices. It has here an
elegant reference to (...), v. 7. as if he had said, It Is true, these
Pythagorising Gnostics now, and the superstitiose sons of Antichrist hereafter
will al pretend, by these their bodily exercices and severities to promove
Mortification and Godliness, but in truth they effect nothing less: For
bodily exercice prositeth but a little, (...), to little. i.e. Al those
Pythagoric Abstinences, Severities, and other externe Mortifications, which the
sons of Antichrist make the foundation of their Supererogations and Merits, are
so far from meriting any thing at the hand of God, as that they are little or
nothing worth, etc. But Godliness is profitable to althings, having the
promises of this life, and that to come. i.e. True Christian piety, though it
can merit nothing at the hand of God, yet it has a very great instrumental
causalitie and influence, by virtue of Gods gratiose promise, on our well
being, both in this and the coming life. Whence our Apostle adds, 1 Timothy 4.9.
ver. 9. This is a faithful saying and worthy of al acceptance. (...) answers
exactly to the Hebrew, (...), Cabala, which the fabulose Jews, in imitation of
the Pythagorean Institutes, made their Codex, or Canon Law, by virtue of which
they introduced al their Fables, and mixed them with the Divine Oracles. So in
like manner the Pythagorising Gnostics, and fabulose Monks had their Cabala or
Systeme of Pythagorean Institutes, which they foisted into their Canonic
Theology, and thereby introduced al their bodily exercices or Mortifications.
To this Pythagorean, Jewish, Gnostic and Monkish Cabala, our Apostle here
opposes this Divine Cabala or Canon touching Christian Godliness: the like, 1 Timothy 1.15. B. 1. C. 4.. 1. Thus we see how these Pythagorean Abstinences,
Bodily exercices and Wilworship.
Mortifications, and other bodily exercices were brought into the Church by the
Monks, those eldest sons of Antichrist, thereby to lay a foundation for their
works of Supererogation and Merits; whereof we find the like account given by
Paul, Col. 2.23. (...).
Col. 2.23. Our Apostle v. 20, 21, 22. had mentioned some Pythagorean Dogmes,
Canons, and Institutes, which the Gnostics then, and Antichrist afterward
imposed, as Ecclesiastic Canons, on the Churches of Christ: and in this v. 23.
he runs them up to their spring head, Which things indeed have a show of
wisdom in Will worship. (...), i.e. an accurate, artificial Form, Image, Idea,
or Picture. (...), of wisdom; namely of some Divine mystic Cabala, or
Tradition dropped from Heaven. For both the Pharisees, Gnostics and Monks
pretended unto some Divine Cabala or Tradition for all their fabulose
Abstinences and Mortifications; though in truth they are al but, (...), in
imitation of Pythagorean Dogmes and Institutes, as it follows: (...), in
Will Worship. (...), says Grotius, is a middle word signifying Rites and
Ceremonies: and (...) implies, that these Rites were taken up of their own
accord, etc. Our English Councils, page 449. Canonibus sub Eadgaro, Can. 60.
amongst other particulars adds this, We teach that al Priests shall blot out al
superstitions of the Gentiles, and we forbid Wilweorthunga. Which is there
translated in Latin, Fictas ad libidinem adorationes, with a Marginal reference
to this (...), Col. 2.23. But learned Hammond, to avoid the force of so great a
Testimony against Will worship, for Wilweorthunga would read it Welweorthunga,
i. e. Wel-worship; it being, says he, commun then to worship Wels. But this is
too poor a gloss to need consutation: yea he himself grants in his Annotations
on this Text, That the Pharisees pride and boasting was censured by Christ; and
their forming those voluntary acts of Devotion into precepts, and entering them
into Books, and separating themselves from all that did not perform their
severe prescriptions, rendered them Pharisees, and divided them from the
Hasidei, etc. By which he grants, that the imposing human inventions is
Pharisaic Will Worship, and the cause of needless separation or division. But
it is evident, that our Apostle here strikes at the very root of al bodily
Abstinences and Severities, which he calls neglects of the Body; affirming,
that they were but (...), Will Worship. i. e. the original Idea of al these
externe Mortifications was some Pythagorean Dogmes, Institutes, and Canons, as
v. 8, 16, 20, 21, 22. Whence the superstitiose Pharisees transcribed al their,
as also the fabulose Gnostics and Monks al their bodily Severities, in order
to works of Supererogation and Merits. For it is evident, that nothing can
stablish a foundation for works of Supererogation and Merits, but some (...),
Will worship, or somewhat not commanded: and no Will Worship has more suited with
the palate of proud Pharisees, Gnostics, and the sons of Antichrist, than the
Pythagorean (...), which by reason of its many externe Severities seemed most
expedient to build human Merits and Satisfactions upon. Of which see more C.
1.. 7. And farther, that Antichrist's Ecclesiastic Canons for the stablishing
Merits and Satisfactions is but (...), or (...), an Imitation of the
Pythagorean (...), or Will Worship, appears by what Grotius lays down, 2 Timothy
4.4.
2 Timothy 4.4. And turn aside to Fables. (...). These Fables are concerning the
Expiations of Sins, taken from the Chaldean and Orphic Discipline: Amongst
which Sea water had the first place, then fountain water, Scilla, Sulphur,
Bitumen, etc. The Orphic Discipline, which Grotius here mentions, takes in also
the Pythagoric which was but a branch thereof. 2 Timothy 3.13.
And so Grotius on the foregoing, 2 Timothy 3.13. (...), deceiving and being
deceived. These Doctors, (says he, meaning the Gnostics) who deceived the
people, were themselves deceived by the Philosophers, specially by the
Pythagoreans, of whom there were many at Ephesus. And it is apparent, that the
whole of Pythagoras's Discipline was calculated to lay a foundation for human
Expiations, Satisfactions, and Merits: whence Antichrist did the more
cheerfully close with it, as most proper to stablish his works of
Supererogation and Merits. 1 King. 18.28. We find the Priests of Baal cutting
and lancing themselves as the sons of Antichrist now do: and therefore, Levit.
19.28. and Deuteronomy. 14.1. God forbids these Rites; because abused to
Demon-worship. We find also in Cicero de leg. lib. 2. Sect. 46. That our merits
carry us to Heaven, as Bochart observes. Indeed this Doctrine of human Merits
found too much footing amongst the Fathers, specially Origin, who being of the
Alexandrine Schole, affected too great a mixture of Pythagorean and Platonic
Dogmes, and amongst others this of Merits, (as in the foregoing Chap. 1.. 8.)
which opened a door to Antichrist, for the introducing his Canonic
Satisfactions, Merits, Indulgences, etc.

. 11. Antichrist's Purgatory and prayers for the dead is another piece of
(...), Antichrists Purgatory from the Philosophers (...).
which he introduced, (...), in Imitation of the Pythagorean, Platonic, and
Stoic (...), Purification of Souls by fire after death. That the Pythagoreans
and Platonistes held some kind of Purgatory or Purification of Souls
separated, has been before hinted. This they called (...), Purification of the
soul by fire; which the Stoics termed (...). That the Purgatory so much
defended by the Devoti of Antichrist, is indeed but an Imitamen of the Platonic
(...), or Purgation of the soul by fire, brought into the Primitive Churches by
Origin, we have before B. 2. C. 1.. 8. intimated. And to make good this charge
we may consult Origen's Comments on Exodus Hom. 6. Psalm. 36. Hom. 3. and Luke
Hom. 6. Where he would needs persuade men, That both Believers and Insidels
must pass through that fire, which at last shall consume the world. This
opinion was followed by his Sectators, the Oreginistic Monks of Egypt, yet
condemned by the Orthodoxe. But these disputes touching the condition and
Domicile of Souls after death, came to be multiplied: and about the year 400,
many had their minds corrupted with those fabulose Platonic Philosophemes, That
the souls of men were purged in a certain place, before they were taken into
Heaven. Yet these Sentiments were laid down only as Problemes to be disputed,
not in form of Dogmatic Articles, as it is well observed, Traite des Ancien.
Ceremon. page 64. That the Antichristian Purgatory is but an Imitamen of the
Platonic Purgatory will be evident to any that takes a view of Plato's Idea
thereof: who in his Phaedo, page 113. treating professedly of the threefold
state of Souls after their separation from the body, namely of the righteous
in bliss; of the desperately wicked in Tartarie, or the Stygian lake; and of
those who are wicked, but curable in a temporary Tartarie; he adds concerning
these two last, But if by reason of the magnitude of their sins they may seem
incurable, then an agreeable destiny casts them into Tartarie, whence they
never get out. But such as happen to be curable, though obnoxious to great
sins, on these there is laid a necessity of falling into Tartarie; but after
they have continued there one year, the Lake casts them out again. Thus Plato.
Where he evidently makes mention of a Temporary Tartarie, (distinct from the
eternal fixed Tartarie of such as are incurably wicked) which exactly answers
to the Popish Purgatory, or Temporary Hell.

Now such as were in this Philosophic Purgatory or Temporary Tartarie,
Plato's (...) or Sacrifice for the dead.
that they might have the more speedy egresse or dismission thence, Plato,
Repub. lib. 2. tells us, That there were certain (...), i. e. mysteriose,
sumtuose sacrifices offered for them. And that this is the proper import of
Plato's (...), Teleta, is made evident by Ludovicus Vives, on August. Civit.
lib. 4. cap. 31. Suidas, (says he) affirms, (...), Teletam, to be the
greatest and most sumtuose of all the mysteriose Sacrifices; so called because
the greatest part thereof was consumed. For (...) signifies to consume;
although it signifies also to perfect: and therefore there are some who think
these Teletae to be so called; because they were the most perfect Sacrifices,
to which there was nothing wanting. Such were the Sacrifices of the Sun and
Moon, and of Bacchus, and some Expiations, by which the sins not only of
private persons, but also of Cities, and of the Dead, as well as of the living,
were purged away by Sacrifices, plays, and al kind of sportes; which Sacreds
were called Teletae: and so Plato, Repub. 2. affirms, That these Teletae
belong only to the dead, and thence so called, namely from (...), being
Sacrifices appointed to deliver us from the infernal sufferings, or the
Temporary Tartaries. By which it is evident, that Plato his (...), were no
other than certain Sacrifices performed to ransom men's Souls out of the
Temporary Tartarie, or Purgatory. And further, that these Teletae, or
Sacrifices for the Dead, were part of their (...), Demon-worship is manifest,
by what Plato mentions thereof in his Symposium, page 202, 203. where having
discoursed at large of Socrates's Demon, his original nature and office, both
to conveigh the Gifts and Commands of the Supreme God to men, and the prayers
and sacrifices of men to the supreme God, he adds this as one, (...), and the
Teletas, etc. So that the Teletae or Sacrifices for the Dead did in a more
peculiar manner belong to their Demon-worship. Moreover Virgil ( Aen. 5, 6.)
teaches clearly a Purgatory and prayer for the dead, as Bochart, Contre
Veron, P. 3. C. 25. S. 4. Art. 1. has observed. By which it is evident, that
Antichrist's Purgatory, Sacrifices, and Prayers for the dead are al but (...),
(as 1 Timothy 4.2.) in imitation of the Philosophers Purgatory and Teletae, or
Sacrifices and prayers for the dead, their being delivered out of the
Temporary Tartarie or Purgatory.

Now to inquire a little when and how these Pagan (...), or sacrifices for the
dead, were introduced into the Christian Churches; we are to take notice that
something hereof was found in them very early; and that out of a symbolising
humor, thereby to induce the Gentiles to an embracement of the Christian
Religion; as we find it in Cyprian, l. 3. Epist. 15, 16. Tertul. de Moneg.
Origin l. 3. in Job. and August. Epist. 68. And the manner how they were
introduced seems this: After the death of any Christian; specially if a Martyr,
the following year on the day of his departure they made public Commemoration
in the public Assembly, of his Faith, Christian Exploits, and Divine
Assistances vouchsafed to him; with prayers to God, that he would vouchsafe
them the like good issue. Then the Parents or Friends of the Deceased, to
render the Commemoration more solemn, presented to the Church, or to the Poor
of the Congregation then present, a quantity of Bread and other food. Many
also to keep alive their memory in the Church, would leave on their last Will
and Testament certain Legacies to be paid annually on the day of their death.
And such were the foundations of these Anniversary Commemorations. Yet these
Offerings were looked on in those Primitive Churches, not as Expiatory
Sacrifices, but only as Memorials of the Faith and Christian Courage, with
other good deeds of their deceased friends, as we are assured, Traite des
Ancien. Ceremonies, l'an 200. p. 20. But lastly to confess the truth, it is
certain that many of those Primitive Christians, at least in the third and
fourth Centuries, did too much symbolise with the Gentiles Demon worship, and
particularly in these their (...), or sacrifices for the dead. This is
incomparably well explicated by Is. Cas. Exer. 16. N 43. where he shows, that
these Sacred (...), Teletae, were in use among the Grecians, who performed
their chief Sacreds by Night: and they were various, some greater, some lesser.
They were called (...), mysteries; and the operation of these Sacreds was named
(...), as they who partaked of them, were said (...), etc. The scope of these
Sacrifices they called (...), the end or consummation. This end they
interpreted the perduction of the Soul to that state, in which it was before
its descent into the Body. So Olympiodorus, in Platon. Phaedon, (...). The
scope of these Teletae is to reduce souls to that end, from which they at first
descended as from its principe. By which it is evident that they looked on these
(...), Teletae, to be as Purgatories for the purifying of the Soul. Thence
Augustine, de Trin. l. 3. c. 10. says, That Satan has cast deluded souls
headlong into Hell, by promising the purgation of their souls, by those which
they call (...), Teletas. Which gives us a great account of that Antichristian
Purgatory, so much pleaded for by the Sectators of Antichrist, and taken up by
them in Imitation of those Pagan Teletae. Of which see more Court Gent. P. 1.
B. 2. C. 9.. 10.

This Philosophic (...), or Purgatory, began indeed very early to gain footing
in the Churches of Christ, Antichristian Purgatory from the Schole of
Alexandria.
and as we need no way dout had its foundation from the Schole of Alexandria,
where the Pythagorean and Platonic Philosophy was then in great vogue; whence
Origin, with many other pieces of Demon-worship, sucked in this also of
Purgatory, Sacrifices, and Prayers for the Dead; which the Monks his
successors afterward digested and improved; and at last Antichrist stablished
and confirmed by his Ecclesiastic Canons, as before. These Antichristian
Teletae, or Sacrifices and Prayers for the Dead, were come to some maturitie
even in Augustin's time; for he de Civit. Dei, l. 8. c. 26, 27. tells us of
certain superstitiose persons, who carried their Junkets to the Graves of
Martyrs, and there made their prayers, etc. And the Author of Traite des
Ancien. Cerem. page 39. affirms, that about the year 380, there was a
considerable progress wade in Prayers for the Dead. And the same Author, page
44. shows us, how the Vigils or Watchings of the Dead, as also the usage of
Singing and Tapers at their Burials was brought into the Church about the year
400, as before. Hence also sprang the Passing-Bel (as they call it) at the
Soul's departure out of the body; which is always in the Roman Church
attended with Prayers. Lastly, al Funeral-treatments, Orations, Sermons,
Prayers at the Grave, so much in request in the Roman Church, seem al to be
(...), or (...), of these Demon (...), Sacrifices and Prayers for the dead,
thereby to redeem their Souls from Purgatory, etc.

SECT. IV. Papal Primatie and Traditions from Ethnic Philosophy.
. 1. ANother piece of Antichrist's Canon Law is that which concerns his
Canonic Papal Primatie, Antichrist's Canonic Primatic an Imitamen of the Pagan.
which we may reckon also as a part of his (...), foretold 1 Timothy 4.1. For, as
Mede well observes, the whole of Antichristianisme is comprehended under this
Prophetic character of Antichrist. And indeed, that the whole of Antichrist's
Primatie is but (...), or an Imitation of the Pagan Primatie stablished at Rome
and elsewhere, is evident from the confession of his own Canon Law: for Decret.
part 1. Distinct. 21. Edit. Colon. an. 1631. page 62. I find (according to this
exact Version) these very words: Amongst the Priests there is some difference
kept, so that some are called simple Priests; some Arch-Presbyters; some
Chorepiscopi; some Bishops; some Archbishops; some Metropolitans; some
Primates; some Patriarchs; some [summi Pontifices] high Priests or Popes. This
difference was introduced chiefly from the Gentiles, who called their Flamens,
some Arch-flamens, others Proto-Flamens. Thus the Canonist: who indeed gives us
a good Genealogy of al their Canonic Primatie. I find this well observed by
learned Bochart, Contre Veron, part. 3. Paragr. 86. cap. 23. page 883. To the
Ceremonies of the Jews they have joined those of the Pagans. It is upon this
Model that they have built al their Papal Hierarchy, etc. I find the like
observation in Grotius, de Imp. Sum. Potest. cap. 11. page 350. It may be
demanded by what exemple chiefly the Episcopal dignity was introduced into the
Church? That there were Degrees of Priests amongst the Gentiles is most
evident. Neither was this a new custom, or proper only to the Greeks, and
their Descendents, as the Discipline of the Druides teaches us. The Druides,
says Caesar, have one President, who has the chiefest authority amongst them.
Druidibus praeest unus, qui summam inter eos habet autoritatem. Caes. Comm.
Also that the Preeminence of the Metropolitan Cities in Sacreds was very
ancient, Thucydides teaches us, who speaking of the Corcyreans, Colonies of
the Corinthians, says, (...), there were the chief Rulers of the Priests. On
which place the ancient Scholiast adds, (...), It was the custom to take the
chief Priest from the Metropolis. Strabo makes mention of one chief Priest of
the Catti: and Marcellinus, of a chief Priest amongst the Burgondians, etc.
Thus Grotius. So Bochart tells us, there were Priests in Phrygia called Galli
and Archigalli as before, S. 3.. 9. of this Chapter. By which it is evident,
that the Pagans generally had an Hierarchy, and one chief Priest over the
rest: and it is apparent, that the Papal Primatie was but (...) or (...), an
Imitation of the Pagan; which will farther appear by the following particulars.

1. This Papal Primatie began at Alexandria; Papal Primatie began at Alexandria
in in imitation of the Philosophers Schools.
which as it was the chief Seminary of Pagan Philosophy and Demon-worship, so
also the fruitful womb, wherein all the principal Parts and Lineaments of
Antichrist received their first conception and Formation. And amongst other
Parts of this Man of Sin, his Head, which consistes in his usurped Primatie,
was also formed in this Philosophy Church or Schole of Alexandria. Thus much I
gather from Grotius his Gallic Epistles, Epist. 162. page 397. where proving,
that Clemens's Epistle to the Corinthians was genuine, he gives this as one
argument, namely, That he never makes any mention of that extravagant
Authority of Bishops, which, by the custom of the Church, began after Marke's
death to be introduced at Alexandria, and by that exemple elsewhere, etc. Thus
we see that Papal Primatie began very early in this Philosophising Church at
Alexandria, soon after Marke's death; and we may presume from their too great
symbolising with that Pythagorean Platonic Schole in point of Discipline.
Neither is Grotius singular in this his observation, for Jerome long ago
observed the same, who makes Heraclas and Dionysius in Alexandria, the first
Authors of advancing one Minister above another in power, about the year 140.
And a learned Divine assures us, That Julianus Bishop of Alexandria was the
beginner and breeder of Diocesan Government, which came in by little and
little, etc. Yea so speedy was the growth of this Antichristian Primatie at
Alexandria, as that at the Council of Nice it arrived to a Patriarchie.

. 2. But albeit the Papal Primatie had its first conception and Fomentation at
Alexandria, 2. The chief Seat of Papal Primatie at Rome, and that from
imitation of Pagan-Rome.
yet its chief Nurserie and Throne was at Rome: for here, according to Divine
prediction, Antichrist, that Man of Sin, and Head of this Papal Hierarchy, has
his main seat and residence. Now that the whole of this Papal Hierarchy
stablished at Rome was but (...) or (...), an Imitation of Pagan Hierarchy, or
rather Demonarchie stablished at Rome and elsewhere, we shall prove by its Parts.

First, 1. The Popes Supremacy an Imitamen of the Pagan Empire.
The Head of this Papal Primatie is the Pope, the whole of whose usurped
Dignity and Primatie is but an Image of, and extract from the Demonarchie or
Hierarchy of the Pagan Emperors, as it will easily appear to any that shall
consider, how exactly parallel they are. Touching the first stablishment of the
Roman Hierarchy by Numa, Plutarch gives us a good account in the Life of Numa.
Numa Pompilius, says he, erected the Pontific College; and he himself was the
first Pontifex; the chief of those Pontifices, whom they call the great
Pontifex: Who has the dignity and authority of the High Priest and Master of
the Pontific Law; who was to see that none brake the ancient Ceremonies, nor
brought in any new thing into Religion; but that every one should be taught by
him, how they should serve the Gods, etc. And has not the Pope assumed the very
same Pontific Dignity both Name and Thing? Has he not assumed the very Name of
Pontifex Maximus? and is he not Master of the Pontific Law, or the Ecclesiastic
Canons? Does he not take upon him to teach every one how they should serve his
Demon-Gods, or Saints? Again Augustine, de Civit. l. 15 c. 15. tells us, That the
Romans made Romulus a Flamen; which was a sort of Priesthood so excelling in
the Roman Sacreds, (witness the Apex) that they had only three Flamens
instituted to the three Gods; the Diale, to Jupiter; the Martiale, to Mars; the
Quirinale, to Romulus. Ludovicus Vives on this place, explicating what this
Flamen dedicated to Romulus was, tells us, That amongst the Orders of Priests,
Numa Pompilius made some, which he called Flamens; whose chief Ensign was an
Hat, as the Bishops now, wherein there was a thread of white wool; whence they
were called Filamines from fila lanae. And then as for the Apex, which Augustine
makes mention of, Ludovicus Vives gives us this account, That it was in the
Flamen, that which covered the Head, namely the fila lanea or Cap. This Apex,
adds he, the Romans gave to none but their chiefest Priests, as now the
Mitres. So Lucan, Et tollens Apicem generoso vertice flamen. And has not the
Roman Bishop the very same dignity and primatie, as it has been already
observed,. 1? Is he not the Proto-Flamen? and has he not his Mitre exactly
answering to the Proto-flamen's Apex? But to carry on this parallel a little
farther; the Roman Emperor, (as we just now observed of Numa Pompilius)
reserved to himself the Title and Dignity of Pontifex Maximus, the Great
High Priest; by virtue whereof he was Head in all matters Ecclesiastic, as well as
Civil; and had an absolute disposition of the Pontific Hierarchy, College, and
Law. This Title and Dignity the Emperors affected 'til the dissolution of the
Empire. Yea after Pagan Rome turned Christian, the Christian Emperors for some
while retained the Title and Dignity of Pontifex Maximus, both Name and Thing,
'til the Bishop of Rome, upon the declension of the Empire, usurped the same.
Which is a good Clavis to that prediction of Paul, 2 These. 2.7. He who now
lets; i.e. The Roman Emperor, 2 These. 2.7.
who had the very Title and Dignity of the Pontifex Maximus, which Antichrist
was to be invested with, but could not obtain 'til after the dissolution of the
Empire. And the event has made this evident, that the Rise and Growth of
Antichrist, and his Tyrannic Empire, was according to the Declension and
Dissolution of the Civil Empire; yea in the same measure and proportion that
the later decreased, the former increased, as it was foretold, Revel. 13.1.
That he should receive his power at the same time with the ten Horns: which
were to rise up out of the broken parts of the Empire. Thus was the generation
of Antichrist out of the corruption of the Empire. Yea, that Antichrist
exercises all the power which was exercised by the Pagan Emperor, seems clear
from that part of his Character, Rev. 13.12. And he exercises all the power of
the first Best before him. So v. 15. Antichrist's Character by Paul.


But all this will more fully appear by that Character which Paul gives him, 2
These. 2.3, 4.
2 These. 2.3, 4. That man of sin, etc. I know Hammond, in his Annotations on
this Text, [Note E] understandes by this Man of Sin, Simon Magus, and that
exclusively, without any respect to the Roman Antichrist. So Bellarmine also
understandes it of a single person, as Grotius after him. But this fond conceit
has been already refuted sufficiently out of Mede, S. 2.. 3. of this Chapter,
and the vanity of it will farther appear by an explication of the parts. (...),
That Apostasy.
It is said first, (...), there shall come a falling away, or an Apostasy; i.e.
a total, universal, horrid Defection of the visible Church. Which cannot be
meant of any particular Heretics, or Heresy in those times: (1) Because he
speaks of it Propheticly as a thing to come, not then existent. (2) He here
speaks of an universal and total Apostasy of the visible Church, which cannot
be applied to any Heresy then in being; because all the Heresies of the
Gnostics and others then on foot were but particular, and generally disowned by
the Churches of Christ, etc.

2. He describes this general revolt by its Head; That man of sin.
whom he calls, 2 These. 2.3. (...).
(...), That man of sin. (1) We may consider him as a Man, and so he is styled,
That Man, in a way of Eminence and singularity, which denotes him to be such a
monstre, as never had, nor shall have his parallel. If we have a curiosity to
know [1] his Names, he is styled ver. 4. (...), one that opposes Christ, or a
counter-Christ, i.e. Antichrist. He is styled also Rev. 13.11. The two-horned
Best; and Rev. 16.13, 19, 20. The false Prophet. [2] As for his Ancestors, we
may run up his Gnealogie to Cain, and the Pharisees, from whom he received his
Doctrine of Justification by Works; to Nimrod, Pharaoh, and Antiochus
Epiphanes, from whom he derived his Tyrannic persecution; to Balaam, Barchozba,
Apollonius Tyanaeus, and Simon Magus, from whom he received his Impostures and
Lying Wonders; to the Gnostics, from whom he received his Pythagorean Infusions
and Superstitions. Yet his immediate Parents were the Old Serpent, Rev. 12.9,
15. and Babylon the mother of Harlots, or the Apostate Church, Rev. 17.1,-5.
[3] As for his first conception, it was very early, even in Paul's time, as 2
These. 2.7. which John was more fully instructed in, as 1 John 2.18. [4] His
Nativitie and Birth, Cluverus on Revel. 11. Tom. 3. page 29, etc. refers to An.
440, or thereabouts: and so he makes Pope Leo Magnus, the first of the
Antichristian line, in whom the Number of the Best began. And indeed his
Arguments to begin the Antichristian Tyranny with Leo Magnus seem weighty;
because he was the first that assumed an Universal Domination, by virtue of the
power of the Keys given to Peter, Math. 16.18, 19. Of which see more Cluverus.
And if we begin the Birth of this Man of Sin with Leo Magnus, then his
Destruction will be about An. 1700 acccording to the Prophetic determination,
Rev. 12.6, 14. where Antichrist's Duration is confined unto 1260 years. But (2)
if we consider him as That man of sin, then observe here the abstract for the
concrete, which implies an universalitie or perfection both of Parts and
Degrees. He is a perfect man of sin, both Extensively and Intensively. [1
Extensively, or as to the parts and kinds of sin, he is the complexe of al
manner of sins. What sin is there so flagitiose and monstrose, whereof we have
not some Idea in this Man of sin? Does not his Head contain all the Heresies
that were ever found in the Church? Are not the Pelagian Infusions the vital
spirits of his heart? Is he not also a man of Schisms? Has not his Tyrannic
Domination proved the womb of the greatest Schisms in the Church? Is he not
also a man of Idolatries and Superstitions? Are not all the Demon-superstitions
to be found in him, as S. 3? Is not his Mother Church styled, Rev. 17.1. the
mother of Harlots, i.e. Idolatries? Yea is he not a man of Blasphemies, as Rev.
13.1, 5, 6? Does he not blaspheme the Tabernacle or Body of our Lord, by his
Doctrine of Transubstantiation? Are not the Heavenly Inhabitants, i.e. Angels
and glorified Saints, blasphemed by his (...), or Saint worship? Is not also
the Name of God, i.e. his Soverain Nature, Attributes, and Perfections,
blasphemed by his Idolatry and Will Worship? What is Blasphemy, according to
its formal Idea, but the diminishing or blemishing the Name and Honor of God?
(1) By taking that from God that belonges to him. (2) By ascribing that to God,
that belonges not to him. (3) By ascribing that to the Creature that belonges
to God? Is he not also a man of Pride, Ambition, and Usurpation? Can there be a
more Hel-bred piece of pride, than for a poor beggarly Priest to exalt himself
above all the Princes of the world, as 2 These. 2.4? May he not also be justly
styled a man of blood, as Revel. 17.6? Yea is not all the blood of Saints that
was ever shed from Abel to this day approved by him? Was there ever such a
Murderer found as this man of sin, Rev. 11.7? And is he not likewise a man of
avarice or covetousness? was there ever such an avariciose miser found as
this, who measures al Godliness by Gain? Is not the Chamber of Rome well
Characterised by one, who styles it an Infernal Golphe, which swallows up all that comes to it, without ever refunding any part? May we not also deservedly
term him a Man of Sorceries, and Witchcrafts? Is not Exorcisme or Conjuration
one of the principal Offices of his Church? Rev. 14.8.
Do we not read, Revel. 18 23. of his Sorceries? Rev. 18 23.
which we find explicated, Revel. 14.8. The wine of the wrath of her
fornication. (...) here signifies not wrath, but poison, the same with (...),
Revel. 18.23. namely those poisonous Philtres, or bewitching charms, whereby
the Whore of Babylon bewitches the Nations, in allusion to Whores, who were
wont to drink Philtres to their Paramors in a Golden cup, thereby to charm
their affections, as Mede. Again, is he not a man of sensualities and
impurities? was there ever any guilty of such uncleanness both corporal and
spiritual? O! what Luxury, Sodomie, and al manner of Sensuality is to be
found at Rome, under the Throne of this Antichristian Best? And does not all this proceed from the just judgment of God, who usually punishes spiritual
fornication with corporal, as before? Is he not also a man of Ignorance? Is not
his Kingdom subordinate to that of Satan, a Kingdom of Darkness? Is not
Ignorance styled by him the mother of his Devotion? How many intrigues has he
to keep his subjects in darkness? Does not the power of his Scepter consiste
in the power of darkness? With what black Curses does he seal up the holy
Scriptures from the peoples view? How do al his Devoti fly from the light of
life, and turn their backs on the Sun of Righteousness? Is not Ignorance the
main pillar of his Throne? What black darknesses covered Europe so long as this
man of Sin gave Laws to it? Yea farther, may we not with justice term him a
man of Atheism? Whence sprang all that Machiavellian Atheism, which like a
deluge has overflowen al Europe, but from the Doctrines and Practices of this
man of sin? What more potent to make men Atheists, than such a ridiculose
superstitiose Religion, as that of this man of sin? Does not carnal Policy,
which is the quintessence of Popery, naturally tend to Atheism? Moreover, is
he not a man of Irreligion and Profaneness? Has he not for more than 1000
years profaned the Temple of God by his Abomination of Desolation? how has he
polluted all the Ordinances, Sacraments, and holy things of God? Again, may we
not without injury term him a man of Hypocrisy, Lies, and Deceit? Are not
Lying wonders and fabulose Legends the main foundation of his Kingdom, as 2
These. 2.7, 10? Is he not said, Rev. 13.11. To have two horns like a lamb;
i.e. to counterfeit the power of Christ? So 1 Timothy 4.2. he is said to introduce
al his Doctrines of Demons, (...), by the hypocrisy, etc. as before S. 3.. 1,
etc. Yea what is al Popery but a profunde Mystery of Iniquity, a complexe of
Pharisaic rank hypocrisy, a mere carnal lie? Lastly, to sum up the Idea's of
Antichrist, is he not a man of Apostasy? Are not all the Apostasies of the
Church in all Age to be found in this man of sin? Is not this the principal
reason why Babylon is styled the mother of Harlots, Rev. 17.5? Thus we see how
he is That man of sin extensively; i.e. of al kinds of sin; the systeme and
complexe of al Heresies, sins, and blasphemies, etc. It Is true, there were many
errors and corruptions in the Primitive Churches, and many Antichrists, as 1 John 2.18. yet none of them were this man of sin; but he is the aggregate and
compende of al of them; he is as it were the Ocean, into which al those
foregoing Heresies and Abominations did flow. Thus he is said to be that man of
sin; i.e. of al kinds or sorts of Sin and Heresy, in whom al Heresies met as
lines in their center. [2.] This phrase, That man of sin, implies an intensive
universalitie, or perfection of degrees; i.e. in whom al sins meet in their
highest degree; for it is well known, that Abstractes speak, forms, essences,
and quintessences of things. So that Man of sin, implies the most notorious
sins, abominations, and blasphemies, enormities in the most soverain degree.
Some conceive this character given Antichrist to be borrowed from the like
given by the Jews to Antiochus his Type, 1 Maccab. 2.48, 62. who is there
styled, That sinner; i.e. such a sinner as outwent all that ever were. Hence the
prodigiose sin of Antichrist is termed, 2 These. 2.7. a mystery of iniquity;
i.e. a profunde infinite abyss of iniquity. So it is said of Babylon, the
royal seat of this man of sin, Revel. 18.5. For her sins have reached unto
heaven; (...), Rev. 18.5.
i.e. her sins following each other, and arising each from other grew so
numerose and great, as that at last they reached up to Heaven, just like a pile
of Wood, etc. Again, there is some emphasis in the article (...) that man; i.
e. (...), he who is not only a disloyal servant, or a declared enemy, but a
Traitor and Usurper of Christ's Empire. Oh! what a world of Treasons and
Blasphemies against Christ is he guilty of, and that under a pretexte of being
Christ's Vicar? In sum, if you should rake Hell, you could not find a sinner
either extensively or intensively equal to this man of sin.

Then follows the other part of his Character, 2 These. 2.3. (...). That Son of
Perdition.
(...), That son of perdition. i.e. (1) Actively, he who will destroy himself,
and all that adhere to him, as 2 Pet. 2.1. And bring upon themselves swift
destruction. Antichrist's Perdition shall arise out of his own bowels; he shall
perish in and by his own designs, endeavors, and oppositions. As Christ makes
the necessities of his enemies to serve his Churches conveniences; so also does
he not make the oppositions of his Enemies subservient to their own ruin?
Antichrist has been these twelve hundred years digging a grave to bury the
Church alive; but will he not at last fall himself thereinto, and fill up the
living Churches place? Do not Antichrist and his Adherents, whiles they strike
at Christ and his Members, break their own arm on that rock? (2) Antichrist
is That son of perdition, passively, [1] as worthy of perdition. So Ephesians. 2.3.
Children of wrath; i.e. who deserve wrath. If ever any deserved perdition, this
man of sin does. In which sense Judas as his Type is termed, Joh. 17.12. That
son of perdition. [2] As under the curse of God, which at last brings
perdition. So we read, 2 Pet. 2.14. of cursed Children, or Sons of the curse.
And is not Antichrist a son of all the Curses in the Word of God? What curse is
there which belonges not to him? [3] He is the son of that famous perdition, so
much spoken of in the Word of God, and typified by all the great Perditions of
Gods Enemies: a perdition in which al other perditions meet, the perdition of
the old world, Sodom, Pharaoh, Babylon, Jerusalem, etc. So Revel. 17.8. it is
said, that the Antichristian Best shall go into perdition; i.e. into that
famous perdition so much spoken of. [4] He is that son of perdition, because
devoted, adjudged, sentenced to perdition, as his proper Enheritance. As the
Enheritance belonged to the Son, so Perdition to the man of sin. What is said
of the destruction of the Ninevites, Nah. 1.9. He will make an utter end:
affliction shall not rise up the second time, shall be the portion of this man of
sin. As Judas was that son of perdition, because adjudged to it; so the man of
sin is that son of perdition; i.e. wholly devoted to perdition: it being an
Hebrew idiome where (...), a son, being used with a Genitive case of
Appellatives, signifies such an one as is wholly given up to such a thing, as
Prove. 31.8.

But then follows Antichrist's formal Usurpation of that (...), Demonarchie,
which the Pagan Emperors assumed to themselves, v. 4. And lifting himself up
above all that is called God; 2 These. 2.4. (...). called God. The Roman Emperors
called Demons.
i.e. Above the Roman Emperor, who was (...), called God, and that (1) Truly,
though Figuratively, as he was appointed by God, to be his Vicegerent in Civil
affairs. So the Scriptures call Civil Magistrates Gods, Psalm. 82.1. I said ye
are Gods, etc. in this sense the Emperor was truly called God. But this seems
not the whole or chief import of this phrase here. Wherefore (2) by called God,
we may understand the abused sense and opinion which Parasites and the vulgar
people had of their Emperors, to whom they ascribed a Divinity, specially
after their decease. For we must know, that the Roman Emperors generally
affected the title of Gods; and such as were deserving amongst them were
estimed as such, specially after their death, passing for Demons, Deastri, or
Medioxumi. Such were Romulus, Numa, Julius Caesar, and the rest of the more
noble Emperors reputed. Now it is said, that Antichrist should lift himself up
above all that is called God; i.e. he should usurp all that pretended Hierarchy
or Demonarchie, which the Emperor, as Supreme Head in all Matters Civil and
Ecclesiastic, assumed; yea he should lift up himself at an higher pitch of
usurped Empire, than ever the Emperor either as Civil Magistrate, or as
Pontifex Maximus, affected. So much (...), lift up, notes. Some render the
particle (...), contra, against: the meaning is the same. That this is the
proper import of the words, appears by what follows, (...), or that is
worshipped: the French renders it, (...).
Divinity. The Greek signifies whatever is in any soverain degree reverenced,
be it Civil, be it Religiose. (1) It signifies that Civil worship which they
gave to their Emperors: whence all the Emperors after Octavius were called
(...), Augusti, (which is of the same origination and import with (...) in this
place.) So Act. 25.21. (...), Augustus; and v. 25. (...), and Act. 27.1. (...).
Augustus signifies Illustrious, from (...), the luster of the Sun. (2) (...)
signifies also Religiose Worship, (from (...), to worship, The Emperor called
(...), i.e. Divus Augustus.
and this from (...), Sabah to celebrate), which the Emperors affected as well
as Civil. Whence the Roman Emperor was usually styled Divus Augustus, and so
worshipped as a Demon after his death. And that this is the genuine import of
the words is acknowledged by Milletere, (after his Apostasy to the Roman
Church) Positiones xii. Romae proponendae de fide propag. Posit. 3. Paul (says
he) points out to the believing Thessalonians the son of perdition by these
characters, 2 These. 2.4. That he exaltes himself against all that is called God,
(...), and Augustum. This is the proper name by which the Emperors were called,
(...), Augusti. The ordinary name of the Emperor was Divus Augustus, Saint
Augustus; which is formed of those two words used here by the Apostle (...).
Thus Milletere, who here sufficiently lays open the nakedness of his Father
the Pope, who has indeed fully made good our Apostles character, in exalting
himself above the Pagan Emperor, who was by his flaterers and the superstitiose
people called and worshipped as God, or as one of their Divi and Demons. And is
not the Pope indeed called Sanctissimus Papa, the most holy Pope; which is the
very name the Gentiles gave their supreme God Jupiter. So Bochart, contre
Veron, page 883. 'This name Papa is given him from that amongst the Pagans:
Jupiter was called Pappas, i.e. Father. So Jupiter is by Muis derived from the
Hebr. (...), jah, and (...), Father. (...), jah, being pronounced by the
Grecians first (...), and then (...), whence Ju-pater, Father Jah: whereunto
Pappas, and Papa answer. Neither does the Pope affect the name only, The Pope
above the Emperor.
but also the Divinity of a Pagan Demon-God; and that in an higher degree than
ever the Pagan Emperors did. For (1) does he not pretend to an extraordinary
Sanctity and Divinity, more than ever any Divus Augustus did? (2) Does he not
affect and usurp an absolute Supremacy both in Civils and Ecclesiastics,
beyond what the Emperor either as Civil Magistrate, or as Pontifex Maximus
assumed? (3) Does not the Pope assume a power of making Demons, or
Saint-Mediators, more than ever any Emperor did? (4) Are not the Popes, at
least some, Canonised as Saints, and so worshipped, as Demons were? (5) Yea,
are not the Popes worshipped while living with great Ceremonies, both Sacred
and Civil, more than ever any Pagan Emperors were? Thus this man of sin has by
his usurped (...), Demonarchie, exalted himself above all that is called God or
worshipped.

But then follows the description of his Papal Throne or Seat, Ver (...), to
rule, notes the Popes Empire
in that phrase, Sits in the Temple of God: (...), to sit, according to the
Scripture-Phraseologie, signifies to Rule, or Preside. So Psalm. 110.1. Sit thou
at my right hand etc. The like Psalm. 9.8. and 20.10. Revel. 17.15. and 18.8. So
Thomas renders it, Principari, dominari; and Theodoret, to usurp the chief
seat. In this regard Antichrist is said to be a counter-Christ, or an Usurper
of his Royal Throne; who is said, Heb. 1.3. Psalm. 110.1.
Heb. 1.3. out of Psalm. 110.1. To sit at the right hand of God, which denotes
his Prophetic and Regal office: for to sit in the Schole belongs to the Doctor;
and on the Throne, to the King. Thus Antichrist, by sitting in the Temple of
God, usurpes Christ's Dignity and Mediatorie Office as Doctor, and King in his
Church. Mestrezat, de l' Eglise, live. 2. Chap. 20. page 430. refers this to
what is mentioned of the King of Babylon, Esa. 14.12, 13. Esa. 14.12, 13.
I will sit also upon the Mount of the Congregation. To sit, (says he) in the
Scripture signifies, to exercise Authority and Empire. And we are to remarque
here, that the Apostle speaking of Antichrist, that he shall sit in the Temple
of God, alludes to Esa. 14.12, 13. where the Prophet represents the words of
the King of Babylon, Glorifying himself in having subjugated Judea, etc. The
Apostle therefore being about to describe the Usurpation of Antichrist in the
Church, does it by this of the King of Babylon, and by his pride; in as much as
the King of Babylon was the type and figure of Antichrist, who does that
spiritually upon Religion and the Consciences of men, which the other had done
corporally on the Church of the Jews, etc. Deodate, in his Annotations on
these words, 2 These. 2.4. Sits, etc. says, That this circumstance is taken
out of what is mentioned of the King of Tire, Ezech. 28.2. I am a God, I sit in
the seat of God, etc. Ezech. 28.2.
We may take in both; because they were both Types of Antichrist. Yea, we may
add hereto what is mentioned of Antiochus, Dan. 11.36. The King of Babylon,
and of Tire, also Antiochus and the Roman Emperor, Types of Antichrist. Dan.
11.36.
And he shall magnify himself above every God, etc. Also what is mentioned of
the Roman Emperor, Mat. 24.15. That he should set up his Abomination of
Desolation in the Temple of God. For all these Pagan Monarchs were, by reason of
their bloody Persecution against the Church of God, Types of Antichrist his
Spiritual Domination in the Churches of Christ, by virtue of his usurped (...),
or (...). Yea indeed this Tyrannic persecution of Antichrist in many regardes
excedeth al those former Persecutions of the King of Babylon, Tire, Antiochus,
and of the Roman Emperors, against the Jewish Church. So Augustine, de Civ. l.
18. c. 52, 53, etc. tells us, That this last Persecution under Antichrist which
he calls the Eleventh, would be of all the worst.

(...), in the Temple. (...), may be understood here (1) Subjectively, In the
Temple of God.
in, as we translate it, for his ruling in and over the Church of Christ, not
as an open enemy, but under the pretexte of being Christ's Vicar: and so it
denotes the difference between the Usurpations of Pagans, Nebuchadnezar,
Antiochus, and the Roman Emperors, who ruled over the Temple of Christ, but not
IN it, as Antichrist, whose Tyranny is not externe and open, but interne, and
under pretexte of a Vicarious power from Christ, Revel. 13.11. This Man of sin
is not a barefaced, but Masqued enemy. (2) We may render (...) contra,
against. Antichrist's sitting in, or ruling over the Church, being in order to
its ruin. Thus Mestrezat renders, (...), against the Temple of God. i.e.
Antichrist shall by his Empire ruin the Church Spiritually, as the King of
Babylon did it corporally: for it is a sitting or Domination for ruin, as it
arrives from a cancer on the body. (3) August. de Civ. l. 2. c. 19. gives this
gloss hereon: We need no way dout, but that in this place, 2 These. 2.4,-11.
The Apostle speaks of Antichrist, v. 4. he says not, in the Temple of God,
but for the Temple of God; as if he were the Temple of God, which is the
Church; as we are wont to say, sedet in amicum, he sits for a friend, i.e. as a
friend. Though this be a truth, yet I conceive our commun version is most
authentic, which also comprehendes both the former: For Antichrist sits in the
Temple, or Church of God, as an absolute Monarch, or counter-Christ, for the
Churches ruin, not edification: and thus, though his Session be in the Temple
of God, yet is it also against the Temple or Church of God; yea al his
Pretensions of sitting as Christ's Vicar in his Church, are but Politic
expedients, by which he does more effectually ruin the Church, etc. That the
Temple of God here, and else where in the Epistles, is used as an expression of
the Christian Churches, which are the Body and truth of that whereof the
Material Temple at Jerusalem was but the Type and Figure, is evident from, 1
Cor. 3.16, 17. 2 Cor. 6.16. Ephesians. 2.20, 21, 22. And thus the Fathers, (as
Augustine, etc.) generally understand

Then it follows, As God.
(...), as God; which seems also to refer to the description of the King of
Babylon, Esa. 14.12, 13. or of the King of Tire, Ezech. 28.2. For, adds
Mestrezat, who ever attributes unto himself Domination over men's Consciences,
and Empire over the Christian Church, he sits as God, and deportes himself as
if he were God. And has not Antichrist usurped such a (...), Demonarchie to
himself? does he not sit on his Pontific Chair, (which he styles St. Peter's) in
Christ's room? And has he not his Pontific Scepter or staff, i.e. his Canon
Law, which he sets up in the room of Christ's Scepter or Law? has he not
usurped the Keys of Christ, Revel. 1.18. to bind whom Christ absolves, and to
absolve whom Christ binds? Does he not condemn what God commandes, and
command what God condemns? Is not that evil by his Law, which is good by Gods;
and that good by Gods Law, which is evil by his? Do not al his Ecclesiastic
Canons bespeak him an Idol-God or Demon? So it follows, (...), showing himself
that he is God; i.e. exhibiting himself as one of those great Demon Idols,
which the Pagans erected in their Temples, and worshipped as Gods; attracting
to himself the eyes, hearts, and Consciences of al his Adorers. Or, as the
Roman Emperors, by assuming to themselves the Title and Authority of Pontifex
Maximus, did thereby virtually, if not formally, show themselves to be Gods,
and so were called Divi Augusti, and worshipped as Demons, at least after their
death: Just so, this Man of sin, though he does not formally assume unto
himself the Name of God or Christ, yet virtually he shows himself as God, or a
Demon-Christ, by usurping the Name and Power of a Pontifex Maximus, of the Head
of the Church, St. Peter's Chair and Keys, etc.

. 3. Antichrist's Ecclesiastic Traditions, Al Popish Traditions Doctrines of
Demons. 1 Timothy 4.1.
with which his Canonic Theology or Law is so greatly stuffed, are al but
(...), Doctrines of Demons in imitation, as 1 Timothy 4.1, 2. We have before S.
2.. 3, 4. spoken somewhat of Antichrist's Ecclesiastic Traditions, in relation
to the Form of his Canon Law; we shall now treat a little of them as they are
the chief Materials of his Canonic Theology. And indeed the main body of
Antichrist's Pontific Canon Law is made up of certain Ecclesiastic Traditions,
which he pretendes to have received down from the Apostles, by the hands of the
Church; but to give them their true Genealogy, they are in truth no other than
corrupt Imitamens of, and Derivations from the Pagan (...), Demon-worship. To
make this clear, we must recollect what has been before mentioned of the
Pythagoreans, (the great founders and Promotors of Demon-worship) who always
received Pythagoras's Institutes as Divine Traditions, delivered to him their
Master by the Divine Oracle. For all those great Founders of Demon-worship never
presumed so much on their own Authority, as to deliver any Institute or Canon,
touching the worship of their Demons, without some pretension of Divine
Tradition. So Numa Pompilius, Lycurgus, Solon, and al those great Legislators
pretended unto a Divine Tradition, for all those Institutes or Canons they
delivered touching the worship of the Gods. Plato aboundes in expressions to
this purpose, showing, How al their Traditions touching the worship of their
Demons, were received from the Oracle, as Repub. 5. and elsewhere. And the
Pythagoreans had so particular a veneration for their Master Pythagoras, as
that they looked upon al his Institutes to be Divine Inspirations: whence they
styled him, (...), The Divine; and judged his (...), a Divine Tradition,
specially as to such things as related to their Demon-worship. Now that al
Antichrist's Ecclesiastic Traditions, with which his Canonic Theology
aboundes, are but corrupt Derivations from this Pythagorean fountain, we shall
endeavor to evince from 1 Timothy 4.1. (...). 1 Timothy 4.1.
That (...) signifies as well a Tradition or Canon, as Doctrine, we have already
proved, Mat, 15.2, 6, 9.
S. 2.. 3. And this is very evident from Mat. 15.2, 6, 9. the consideration of
which Scripture will give us much light as to our present design. The Pharisees
v. 2. complain, that Christ's Disciples transgress the Tradition of the Elders.
They call them the Traditions of the Elders, because they pretended, these
Traditions were delivered by God to Moses when on the Mount, and so delivered
by him to Joshua, and from Joshua handed down by the Elders succeding in the
great Sanedrim. But Christ tells them, that these Traditions were not, as they
pretended, of Divine Origin; which he proves, because they make void the
Commandment of God, as v. 3,-6. And our Savior ver. 9. gives the true
Genealogy of al those Pharisaic Traditions: Teaching for Doctrines the
Commandments of men. (...), i.e. These your Ecclesiastic Traditions, which you
make to be so Canonic and Divine, are indeed but the Commandments of men, i.e.
Pythagorean Dogmes and Institutes: for such these Pharisaic Washings and
Purifications were, with all the rest of their Externe Abstinences and
Severities, as it appears by Col. 2.20, 21, 22, 23. as before, S. 3.. 10. see
the like Mark 7.2, 3, 4, etc. Book 2. Chap. 1.. 5. Under this description of
the Pharisaic Traditions our blessed Lord lays open to us al those Canonic
Traditions of Antichrist, and their origination. (1) It Is true, the Sons of
Antichrist pretend these their Traditions to be dropped from the mouth of Christ,
and so handed down by the Churches Oral Tradition in all Ages: and did not the
Pharisees pretend the same for their Oral Law, as they call it, or the
Traditions of the Elders? Would they not fain persuade us, that those Oral
Traditions were at first delivered by God to Moses on the Mount, by Moses to
Joshua, by Joshua to the LXX Elders, and by them in continued successions down
to their days? Which yet Christ tells us were but the Commandments or
Institutes of men, as Mar. 7.8. i.e. as Paul explaineth Christ's words, Mark
7.8.
Col. 2.8, 20, 21. of vain Philosophers; or according to 1 Timothy 4.1.
Demon-Dogmes, Canons and Traditions. (2) The Sons of Antichrist adorn and
dignifie their Canonic Traditions with all manner of illustrious Titles of
honor: and did not the Pharisees, and their successors the Talmudistes,
dignifie their Oral Traditions with as splendid Titles of honor? Do not both
one and the other estime it a far greater sin to break a Tradition of the Church,
than to violate the Law of God? (3) Antichrist commandes that al his Canonic
Traditions be swallowed down with an implicit faith, albeit never so
contradictorie to commun sense, reason, and Divine says: and did not the
Pharisees and their Sectators the Rabbines enjoin the same? So R. Sal. Jarchi,
on Deuteronomy. 17.11. Thou shall not, says he, recede from the words of the Elders,
albeit they should say unto thee, that thy right hand is the left, and thy left
the right. (4) The Pope does anathematise al those that violate his Traditions:
and did not the Pharisees of old, as the Rabbines do the very same? O! what an
exact parallel is there between Pharisaic and Antichristian Traditions! Thus we
see how these Demon-Doctrines or Traditions, which Antichrist's Canonic
Theology is full of, owe their origin to the Pythagorean Demon Theology,
Canons, or Traditions.

. 4. An (...) of this Chapter.
To conclude this Argument touching Antichrist's Demon-Dogmes, Traditions, and
Canons, we have sufficiently proved, that the whole of Antichrist's Canonic
Theology is but (...), an imitation of Pagan Demon-Doctrines and Canons: We
have also proved, that these Demon-Dogmes and Institutes were formed and shaped
into a Natural Theology by the Philosophers, and principally by the
Pythagoreans and Pythagorising Platonistes. It Is true Orpheus, Homer and Hesiod
were the first that brought in Demons, and Demon-worship into Greece; but yet we
must know, 'twas the Philosophers that formed and shaped these Doctrines of
Demons into a complete body of Natural Theology, constituting these Demons as
Mediators with the supreme God, etc. For the Poets, Homer, etc. confound their
Demons with the supreme Gods: so Homer calls Jupiter a Demon; as Iliad. (...) he
says, Jupiter, (...). And Plutarch, de cessat Oracul. tells us, that Homer made
no difference between the Gods and Demons. It was indeed the Philosophers,
Pythagoras, Plato, etc. those Founders of, (...), Natural Theology, who
formalised and shaped this (...), Demonologie, into its proper Form and
Figure; which afterward the Pythagorising Platonistes of the Alexandrine
Schole, Ammonius, Plotinus, Porphyrie, Jamblichus, Proclus, etc. reformed and
refined; so that it became a fit Idea or image for Origin, and his adherents
the Monks of Alexandria, to form and fashion the first lineaments of
Antichrist's (...) by: out of which Antichrist himself, when he came to the
stature of a perfect Man of sin, extracted al his (...), with all the other
parts of his Demonologie or Canonic Theology, according to 1 Timothy 4.1.
compared with Rev. 9.20. Rev. 9.20.
(...), Demons, i.e. says Mede, Deasters; consecrated both of Angels and dead
men, to be Mediators betwixt God and Men, which the Scripture calls Baalim, the
like Act. 17.22. Act. 17.22. 1 Cor. 10.21.
(...). i.e. Devoted to Demon-fear, or worship: so 1 Cor. 10.21. (...), i.e.
the Demons libamen or drink offering, as before, S. 3.. 4. By all which laid
together it is most evident, that al Antichrist's Canonic Theology is but a
reviving of the old Philosophic (...), Demonologie, or Demon-Dogmes, Canons,
and Traditions, formed into a Systeme of Natural Theology, by Pythagoras and
Plato, and since reformed by the Pythagorising Platonistes of Alexandria,
Ammonius, Plotinus, Porphyrie, Origin, and the rest. Yea we have demonstrated,
that the whole body and spirit of Antichristianisme had its conception and
formation in the womb of Pagan Philosophy, and was brought forth in this
Schole of Alexandria; which proved the Nurserie of Antichrist, and al his
Mystic, Scholastic, and Canonic Theology; specially (1) of Monastic Life and
Institutes. (2) Of al Pelagianisme. (3) Of al Demonologie and Demonolatrie. (4)
Of al Abstinences, Satisfactions, and Merits. (5) Of Purgatory. (6) Of Papal
Primatie, etc. By which we see how much Antichrist has been obliged to Pagan
Philosophy, and principally to the Schole of Alexandria, for his Nativitie and
Nurserie. Al which being superadded to our former Demonstrations from the
Causes, Parts, Properties and Effects of Vain Philosophy, sufficiently prove
our Conclusion touching the Vanity of Pagan Philosophy.
