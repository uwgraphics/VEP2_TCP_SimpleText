A TRANCE: OR, News from Hell, Brought fresh to TOWN BY Mercurius
Acheronticus.

LONDON, Printed, Ann: Dom. 1649.

Paraenesis Angliae.
O England, England If thou be not given quite over to a reprobate sense;
If the least spark of Grace, the least ray of Reason, be yet remaining in
Thee, be warned, be warned by this Trance, by the dreadful objects, the
hideous and horrid apparitions thereof: If no temporal respects can win Thee,
let the apprehensions of eternal ruin work upon Thee: If the hopes of Heaven
cannot prevail with Thee, let the torments of Hell deterr Thee, which are
represented to the very life unto Thee in this ensuing Vision. Be not accessory
to thy own destruction, to thy own damnation; Let not thy children be deluded
any longer with chymeras of more liberty, and advancement of common good. It Is
true, To love one's Country (which is the specious pretense of all these
insurrections) is a commendable thing, yet it is but a Pagan precept; To fear
God, to honor his Priests, to give Caesar his due, not to do evil that good
may come of it, these are all Christian precepts, and Scripture principles.

As the Author was in a Trance, so sure thou art in a fit of madness: Poor
thing, thou want a Physician to cure thee, rather than a Divine to confute
thee: Return then, O return to thy wits, to thy old English temper again, else
it is high time for Thee to make thy last Will, and that the Bell should ring
out to invite thy Neighbors to the funeral of thy Liberty; And because I have
already half promised, I will lay this Epitaph upon Thee:

(...).
TO ENGLANDS Imperial Chamber, THE Renowned City of LONDON: To the Right
Honorable the Lord Mayor, the Right Worshipful the Sheriffs, the Court of
Aldermen, and Common Council, the Noble Company of Merchant-Adventurers, and
Home-Corporations; to all the hopeful Apprentices, and all other Inhabitants,
Inmates, or Aliens, within the said spacious City and Suburbs, is addressed
what follows.
Perditio tua ex Te, L:
O London, understand thy woe,
Thou art thy Self thy greatest Foe;
Be warned, be wise, prevent the Fates,
Destruction bounceth at thy gates,
And know, There is no earthly thing
Can make thee happy, but thy King.
Think with what Honor the first dagger came
Into thy Shield, the Times are now the same.
A TRANCE.
The Proeme.
SVch is the force of Fancy, so large is the reach, so boundless is the
prerogative of humane Imagination, that though the small concave of a scull
some two or three spans compass be her ordinary and natural habitation, yet
the whole Globe of the Earth, nor all the elementary world can totally confine
her, but she will at pleasure clime up to the skies, and make a scale of the
Stars to conduct her to the Empyrean Heaven; Thence she can descend in a trice
to the great Abyss, and take a survey of the Kingdom of darkness; And though
it be a maxim among Divines that ab Orconulla redemptio, there is no return out
of Hell, and that the passage back thence is irremeable, yet the Imagination of
man has this privilege, that she can make egresses and regresses, she can
enter, and come off clear thence when she list, and all this if need be in an
instant; wherein she seems to partake of that admired quality which is
inherent in that most comfortable creature the Light, who is held the sovereign
of all sensible qualities among the Philosophers, and to come nearest to the
nature of a Spirit, which creature requires but an instantaneous moment and
point of time to perform his office of illumination, and dilate himself
throughout the Hemisphear* whence some infer that he is not corporeal, in
regard it is an unquestioned principle in nature that all bodies require a
succession of time in their motion: but there is this difference twixt the
Imagination and Light, that there be some places whereinto Light cannot enter,
but there is no part of the Universe so impervious, where the Imagination may
not make his accesses and recesses at pleasure; as will appear by the
following example.

IT fortuned very lately that I was in a Trance, a strange kind of Ecstasy
surpised me on a sudden, which lasted a good while; during the time, me
thought I was transported to the remotest place, and of the greatest distance
that possibly could be from Heaven; me thought I was in Hell, in Hell, God
bless us, among the Devils, and damned Spirits; I had neither that golden
branch, nor the help of a Sybilla Cumana to conduct me up and down as the
Trojan Prince had, but me thought a Spirit did lead me gently and softly all
along till I came to Plutoes Palace, where a special Counsel was held to take
a strict examination what service the three Furies, Alecto, Tisyphone, and
Megaera, with other inferior Fiends that were their Assistants, had done on
Earth, toward the advancement of the Kingdom of darkness, since their last
mission thither, which was presently upon the appearance of the last blazing
Star in the year 1618. Pluto vouchsafed to be present and preside at this
Counsel, and to be Chaireman himself, to which purpose he had a strong Legion
of Cacodaemons for his guard, but the business was prepared and facilitated
for his hearing before hand by a Committee appointed of purpose for that end,
whence I inferred that Committees were first hatched in Hell, especially some of
those that we have now adays. The three ghastly daughters of Night appeard
with dreadful fiery countenances before Puto, in lieu of air they evaporated
huge flakes of fire, which they took in, and let out with the accents of their
words, huge bunches of Snakes with their tails rooted in their sculls hung
dangling and waving about their heads like dischevelld hair: A furious
contestation fell between them who should be Proloquutrix, but in regard that
Alecto and Tisyphone had given an account of their former missions, the one of
the League in France, the other of the revolt of the Hollander, it came now in
due turn that Megaera should have the priority of speech, so the youngest of
the Tartarian Girls began as follows;

May your high Acherontic Majesty vouchsafe to understand, that since the last
happy Comet, which by the Parallax was found to be in the Heaven, appeard, we
have for 30 years together been more active, and more eager in your Majesty's
service than ever we were; We have incited the affections of the foolish
Inhabitants of the earth to war, and to worry one another like Wolves in most
places; To effect which our practice has been to bring the beggerliest and
toughest people upon the richest and softest; We brought the Swead upon the
German, the Catalan upon the Castillian, the Tartar upon the Chinois, the Scot
upon the English, and now lastly, the Turk upon the Venetian, and the Cosaque
upon the Pole; We have continued a lingering bloody war in Germany for thirty
years together, which entangled into it most of the neighboring States; We
have thrust diverse Princes out of their ancient Inheritances, among others the
Duke of Lorain, and the Palsgrave of the Rhin; We brought two Grand Turks to be
strangled which never happened before; We have often puzzled Italy, we have
made the Kings of Spain and France, though Brothers to bandy so fierce one
against the other, as if the one had been an Infidel, the other a Jew; But
Sir, the most advantageous and signal services we have done to your infernal
Majesty have been in the Isles of great Britain and Ireland: For whereas we
divided our selves before, and went singly among other people, we went jointly
thither all three, because we might be sure to bring our ends home to our aim.
The Nation fittest for us to work first upon was the Scot, who have been so
obedient to their Kings, that of above a hundred they brag of, scarce two parts
of three dyed in their beds; We did suscitate them first against their native
King, and to appear in a daring hostile manner before him upon the borders; At
which time it cost us a great deal of labor so to besot the English, to abase
their courage, and entangle them with Factions (having sure confidents among
them to that end) that they durst not present them battle, and this Sir was an
important piece of service, for had they fought then, or had they been sensible
afterward of the National dishonor they received at that time, their King
being in the field, and consequently had they stuck to him afterward to have
vindicated it, all those Wars we have fomented since might have been prevented:
We shortly after transmitted the same Spirit of Insurrection into Ireland, who
being encouraged by the good successes the Scot had (for he had what he list,
yet could he not sit quiet) and the Irish Commissioners being but harshly
entertained by this English Parliament who intended to send over a Deputy that
should pinch them more than they were before in their consciences, besides in
that they revoked that leave which the King had granted under hand and seal to
the Spanish Ambassadors to have some part of Straffords Army in Ireland (which
were our prime instruments for the Rebellion) to go for Spain, with other
incentives, we stird the Irish also to rise in blood, which they did to some
purpose. Then came we to work upon the English, whom we found as fit to
receive our impression as Flax is to take fire, in regard of their long surfeit
of peace and plenty. We broke up one Parliament because most of the Members
thereof were not for our turn; The first thing we did in this Parliament was to
indue them with a faculty to create fears and jealousies whereof we have made
excellent use, and although all those fears and jealousies appear since to
the common people, and City of London, more plain than their nose on their
faces to be but forgeries, yet we have so infatuated their intellectualls that
we make them still adore the Iuventors of them. And to give your Stygian
Majesty among diverse others one more pregnant and undeniable demonstration
what footing you have got you in that Island, we have within these few years
raised more Pythonesses (which the vulgar call witches there) than ever were in
that Island since your Majesty tempted Eve: And we enabled our Pythonesses to
send their Imps abroad in pursuit of your service. We stood at the Kings elbo
when he passed that happy Act of continuance, and and a Scot was our chiefest
engine to work that; The City of London stood us also in excellent stead to
bring our designs about; We made the riff-raff of that City, as V. with his
Myrmydons, and B. with his bandogs (for so they called the rakells they had
raised) to rabble the King out of Town; We brought also into London the silly
Swains of the Country in whole swarms upon they knew not what; We were in
KInton field, and made the youthful General of the Kings Cavalry de gayete de
coeur to pursue the Parlements Cavalry so far, as the day was lost by it,
whereas if he had stuck Gloss to the Infantry the business had been dispatched
then on the Kings side, and so your Majesty's service since had been
frustrated; We were at Marston Moore, and made the same General so impatient
that he could not forbear fighting till the next day, else he had taken all
the Roundhead Army in a pound; We took great pains at Leycester that the King
should not march Northward, but fortify the place and go back to Naseby where
we had our Imps that bestird themselves notably; We so managed the business
afterward that we made the King, because he is a professed enemy to your
Majesty, to go disguised in a Servingmans habit to his Countrymen the Scots,
and we prevailed so far with them that they delivered him over as a Sacrifice,
and betrayed him like Judas to the English who have crucified ever since like
Jews, by tossing, and tumbling him up and down, and by compulsory means to
work upon His conscience, and stretching it upon the tenter; We made Pembrock
Castle, and Colchester, with other single (or rather simple) Counties to rise
of purpose to betray themselves: In sum, we have reduced that Kingdom to a
new conformity with this of your Majesty's, to a sweet Chaos of all confusion,
we have brought the sway solely into the common peoples hands; And never did
common people more truly act the part, and discover the genious of a common
people more lively, whose nature is still thursting after novelties and Utopian
reformations, though they fool themselves thereby into a baser kind of
slavery, finding when it is too late those sprecious idaeas, and confused forms
of Government they apprehended before, and hugged in their own conceits to be
meet absurdities, when they come to the application and practice of them.

And Sir, the most advantageous instruments we have used to bring all this
about, have been the Pulpit and the Press; by these we diffused those surmises
and suppositious fears formerly spoken of, to intoxicate the brains of the
people: In stead of Lights we put Firebrands into their Churches, who, as we
did dictate unto them, did bawle out nothing but Sedition and Blood, we have
made some of them to bring diverse to have as good an opinion of the Alchoran as
of their Liturgy; we have made secular Ordinances to batter down all ancient
Ecclesiastic Canons; we have made them to unsaint all those whom they call
Apostles in heaven, and to rob their Churches on earth; we have made them put
division twixt the Trinity it self; we have made their Pulpiteers to preach the
Law and your Kingdom in the Church, but the Gospel and Heaven in the Chamber;
we have brought them to keep their Fast day more solemnly then the Sabbath,
upon which, we have made them not only to sit in Counsel, but to put in
execution all designs of blood. But the main, and most material thing we have
made use of, was spiritual pride, your Majesty's old acquaintance, which we
have infused into the mind of every Mecanique and Country Swain, who will
boldly now undertake to expound any Text of Scripture, New or Ol, dupon the
warrant of their own brains, and by the light of their own fires; Insomuch
that we have made that Book which they call the Bible, that was ordained first
for their Salvation, to be the chiefest Instrument of their Damnation We have
brought these Exotic words, Plundering and Storming, which were never known
among them before, and that once abominable word, Excise, to be now familiar
among them, they are made all three free Denizons, and legitimated among them;
We have raised an Army of the dreggs of the people, though of precious stuff
to your Majesty, and so puffed them with the pride of their good successes, and
so fleshed them in Blood, that they are no more tender of a man's or woman's life
then they are of a dog or a cats; We have made those that came Petitioners for
Peace to be murdered, and those that came for War to be thanked and hugged;
We have reduced them to such slavery as to make the very countenances of men
to be commented upon, and their very thoughts to be plundered; We have made the
mother to betray her child, the child the father, the husband his wife, the
servant his master; We have brought a perfect tyranny ore their very souls
and bodies; upon the one, by tedious and endless imprisonment, with the
forfeiture of all their livelihoods before conviction or charge; upon the
other, by forcing them to swallow contradictory Oaths. On that foolish
superstitious day called Christmas, with other Festivalls, we have brought them
to shut up their Churches, and open their shops, so that in time they will
forget the very memory of their Saviors Incarnation; We have brought them to
have as little reverence of their Temples as of their Tap-houses, and to hold
the Church to be but a Charnell-house of rotten bones; and though they cringe,
and knee, and stand bare before any wrangling Bench of Common Pleas, yet we
have so stiffned their joints, and made their heads so tender in that which
they call Gods House, that they can neither bow the one there, nor scarce
uncover the other; We have filled lately the Tribunals in Westminster Hall with
Favorers of your Cause, which makes some of them look rather like Iuglers than
Judges; We have made the Fundamentals of Law to be termed but Formalities; We
have caused Magna Charta to be torn to a thousand flitters, and stretched the
privilege of the Commons so wide, that it has swallowed up all other; We have
grub'd up and cast away those hopeful Plants that grew in their two Seminaries
of Learning, and set in their room grafts of our own choice. And Sir, your
precious children, and our dear brethren, the Angels of the Army, have
comported themselves notably for the improvement of your Majesty's service in
all these things, into whom we have infused such principles that Machiavill
himself were he alive there, would be accounted a Baby in comparison of them.
Among diverse other wholesome maxims, we have instilled this into their brains,
that Villainies must be supported by Villains, and mischief cannot be safe but
by attempting greater; We have made the wealth of Town and Country, of poor
and rich, to glitter in Plunder upon their backs; We make them to command
Free Quarter of those who who were fitter to ask them Alms; We have made them
to rifle the Monuments of the Dead, to rob the Lazaretto, to strip the Orphane
and Widow, to violate and pillage all things that were dedicated to God; We
have made them wreek their revenge upon the very vegetables, to make socks of
Surplices, to water their beasts at the Font, to feed them on the Communion
Table, and to term the thing they call a Sacrament, a Two penny Banquet: Sir,
we have turned supposed Superstition to absolute Profaneness, Government to
Confusion, and Freedom to pure Slavery; We have brought their King to live in
a manner upon Charity, and His Queen to beg of the French Friars, and His
Children to be a kind of Runnagates up and down the world; We have so
intoxicated that dear Daughter of yours the City of London, that she knows
not which way to turn her self; And whereas her Apprentices did rise up like
Tigers against their King, they are now become as so many silly Sheep against
our Army; We have puzzled them with such vertiginous fancies and fears among
themselves, that one neighbor dare not trust the other. To conclude Sir, we
have eclipsed the glory of the English Nation, we have made them by all people
far and near that ever had knowledge of them, to be pitied by some, to be
derided by others, to be scorned of all, and to become the very tail of all
Nations; In fine Sir, we have brought that Kingdom to such a pass of
confusion, that it is a fit place only for your Imperial Phlegetontic Majesty
to inhabit; And Sir, there is never a Cross now there fright you, unless it be
upon their Coins of Gold and Silver, whereon they leave Crosses to be still in
honor of your Plutonian Highness, as you are Dis, and God of riches.

Megaera having thus given up her account in behalf of her self and her two
Sisters, they all bowed their snaky heads down to their feet, which were toed
with Scorpions, before the black Throne of Pluto, who giving a humme that made
all Hell to tremble, answered thus:

MY precious and most trusty Tartarean Daughters, we highly approve of the
supererogatory service you have done us for the propagation of the Stygian
Empire upon earth, and specially in great Brittany: we have sued a long time to
have a Lease of that Island (touching Scotland we have no mind to go thither our
self) and we hope to obtain it; therefore when you have visited those of that
Nation whom you have sent hither already to people this P^t, I would have you
return thither, and prepare that place for one of my principal habitations:
The proper'st instrument you are to employ, is the Army, and you must continue
to infuse such principles into their heads, that they never desist till they
have quite thrust out Religionem ex solo, Regem ex solio, and Dominium ex salo.
Nec sic recedant odia, vivaces agat
Violentus iras animus, and saevus furor
Eterna bella pace sublata gerat.


Make Rebel to fight against Rebel, Independent against Presbyterian, London
against the Army, and all against the Cavalier, till that Nation be wholly
extinguished, that one may not be left to piss against a wall; Let them never
rest till they have made an end of the King who is our greatest enemy; Let
those Idolatrous Bishops which in that idle legend their Gospel are called
Angels, be utterly extirpated, and the very name of them banished for ever, as
the Tarquins were once at Rome; Let not a Church or Chapel, or any
consecrated place stand in the whole Isle, I intend to have a new Almanac of
Saints made at my coming, for I have some Star-gazers there already fit for my
purpose; make haste, for fear a peace be shuffled up on a sudden, and acquit
your selves of your duties, and I may chance get you Scotland for your reward.

The three Furies with a most profound reverence replied, May it please your
Majesty, your Ferriman Charon is hourly so pestered with such multitudes of
English and Scots Roundheads, that we were forced to stay a long time ere we
could get a passage hither, and we fear we shall be so hindered again;
therefore we most humbly desire for our expedition, that your Highness would
vouchsafe to give us a special warrant to be served first with a non obstante
when we come to the banks of Styx. You shall dear Daughters, says Pluto, and
my warrant shall be adressed to a new Journey-man, an English Tarpaling that
came thither lately to serve Charon, upon whom I will lay my commands of
purpose to attend you upon all occasions.

Having all this while listened unto what passed 'twixt Pluto and his Furies, my
Spirit lead me up and down Hell to see the various sorts of torments that are
there, which indeed are innumerable: the first I beheld was Ixion, tied with
vipers to a wheel, and whirld about perpetually, I might perceive a multitude
of lesser wheels newly made thereabouts, whereunto great numbers of English,
and diverse of my acquaintance were bound; hard by I might discern a huge
company of windmils, and bodies tied with ugly Snakes at every wing, turning
round perpetually; a little further there were a great many broken by
millstones, who were whirld with them perpetually about; in another place I
might perceive black whirlepooles full of tormented souls turning incessantly
about: I asked what might be the reason of so many whirling tortures, my good
Spirit answered, all these except Ixions wheel are new torments appointed for
english Roundheads, who have destroyed from foundation to top, all Government
both of Church and State; and as their brains turned round there, after every
wind of Doctrine, so their souls turn here in perpetual pains of rotation: A
little further I spied Prometheus removed thither from Caucasis, with a
ravenous Vulture tearing and feeding upon his Liver, which as one part was
eaten, renewed presently after, and abundance of new comers were tormented in
the same manner, these I was told were English men also that are punished like
Prometheus, because as he is tortured so for stealing fire from heaven, so
those fiery Zelots of England would presumptuously pry into the secret, and
Cabinet Counsels of God Almighty, and dive into those high points of
Predestination, Election, and Reprobation, being not contented sapere ad
sobrietatem, but expect ever and anon to have new lights and flashes of
illuminations. Then came I to the bottomless tub which Danaus Daughters were a
filling, a numberless company of other such tubs were there, and English women
and men were incessantly laboring to fill them up with the stenchy black
waters of Acheron: Those I was told were those overcurious people in England
which would be never satisfied with Christian Knowledge, and had no other
devotion then to be always learning and never coming to the Truth, as these
restless fillers never come to the bottom; Then I beheld the most horrid
tortures of those Giants that would have thust Jove out of heaven, and a world
of English among them, who partaked of the same punishments, because they had
conspired upon earth to dethrone their lawful King; Not far further I might
epsy glowing fiery tubs made Pulpit like, and I was told they were prepared
for those profane and presumptuous Mecanicks and other Lay men, who use to
preach in London, and abuse the Sacred Oracles of God; and Vzza was not far off
tormented there for being so bold with the Arc; A little thereabouts I saw
hoopes of Iron were made Garter-like, of hot glowing steel, these I was told
were designed for those perjured Knights of St George in England, to wear upon
their legs, when they come thither for breaking in the late war that solemn
Oath they had taken at their instalement, to defend the honor and quarrels,
the rights and dignities of their Sovereign; A little distant I might see
diverse brass hoopes glowing with fire, and they were scarfe-like, I was told
they were ordained for those Knights of the Bath to wear for Ribbands next
their skins when they came thither, for infringing that Sacred Oath they made
at their Election, which was, To love their Sovereign above all Earthly
creatures, and for his right and dignity to live and die; A little beyond I saw
a Copper Table, with Chaires of the same, all candent hot, I was told those
were for perjured English privy Concellors, who had bro^k their Oath to the
King, which they took to be true and faithful servants unto Him, and if they
knew or understood any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against
His Majesty's Person, Honor, Crown, or Dignity, they swore to let and
withstand the same to the uttermost of their power, and cause it to be
revealed, either to himself, or any other of his Privy Council; Some few paces
off I might descry a little round place like a Porters Lodgeat Court with a
Fane on the top of it, where was a new kind of exquisite torment provided, but
I could not discern it by reason of the smoke; for once a Secretary of State
and his Son in England, who though they were of differing opinions in every
thing else, yet jumped in this, to destroy their King and Country; Hard by, I
saw a little furnace so candent glowing hot that it looked of the color of a
Rubie or Carbuncle, I was told that was to clap in the Master of the Kings
Jewell-house when he comes thither, for being so perfidious and so perjurious
to his Master; I asked whether there were any other infernal tortures besides
fire, yes I was answered, for to speak of fire to a people habituated to a
cold clime, were not only to make them to slight Hell, but to invite them to
come to it; So my Spirit brought me Northward a little, and showed me a huge
lough, where there were frosted mountains up and down, and I might discover
among them a world of Blewcaps lying in beds of Ice with their noses and toes
nipt, the icesicles stuck to their fingers ends like horns, and a bleak
hispid wind blew incessantly upon them, they made the most pitious noise that
me thought I heard in all Hell; for they wawld, screechd, and howld out ever
and anon this note, Weae is me, wea is me, that ever I betrayed my gid King.

Among all these damned souls, I desired to see what punishment an Atheist
had: my Spirit answered me, there were no Athiests in Hell at all, they were so
on earth before they came hither, and here they sensibly find and acknowledge
there is a God by his Justice and Judgment: For there is here paena sensus,
and paena damni; the outward torments you behold is not so grievous as the
inferior regrets and agonies the souls have to have lost Heaven, whereof they
were once capable, and to be eternally forsaken by their Creator; add hereunto
that they know these torments to be endless, easelesse, and remediless:
Besides these qualities that are incident to the damned souls, they have
neither patience toward themselves in their own suffrances, nor pity toward
others, but their nature is so accursed, that they wish their neighbors
torments to be greater then their own: Besides, their torments never lessen
either by tract of time or degree of sense, but they persever always the same;
they are still fresh, and the soul able to bear them. I saw that everlasting
Villain who committed the first Sacrilege we read of, by burning Dianas
Temple, and his torments were as fresh and violent upon him as they were the
first day he was thrown in thither; Judas was in the same degree and strength
of torture as the first moment he fell thither; Jack Cade, Wat Tyler, Jack
Straw Kit the Tanner did fry there as fresh as they did that instant they were
cast thither: Amongst whom it made my heart to melt within me to see some of
their new-com'd Countrymen amongst them, whereof I knew diverse: And though
Society uses to be some solace to men in misery, yet they conceived no comfort
at all by these fresh companions.

It is high time for us now said my good guiding Angel to be gone to the other
world, so we directed our course toward the Ferry upon Styx; Lord, what
varities of lurid, and ugly squalid countenances did I behold as I passed!
There was one sort of torment I had not seen before, there were diverse that
hung by their tongues upon posts up and down; I asked what they were, answer
was made, that they were English Divines, and Lawyers, who against their
Knowledge, as well as their Consciences, did seduce the ignorant people of
England in the late Civil War. A little further I might see abundance of
Committee Men and others, slopping up drops of moulten lead in lieu of
French-barley broth, with a rabble of Apprentices sweeping the gutters of
Hell, with brooms tufted with Addars and Snakes, because they resorting to the
Wars, had thereby broke their Indentures with their Masters, and their Oaths of
Supremacy to their Prince.

Passing then along toward the Ferry, a world of hideous shapes presented
themselves unto me; there I saw Corroding cares, panick fears, pining grief,
lethargy, sleep, ugly rebellion, revengefull malice, snakie discord, and
spiritual pride, the sin that first peopled Hell: Couches of Toads, Adders,
and Scorpions in a corner hard by, I asked for whom they were prepared, I was
answered, for some English Evangelizing, Anabaptisticall, and Legislative
Ladies, which make writing of Notes at Sermons, and Religion a mere veil to
cover their hypocrisy; So having me thought by a miraculous providence charmed
Cerberus by pointing at him with the sign of the Cross upon the fingers, we
passed quietly by him, and being come to the Ferry, I found true what Pluto had
said before, that there was a new English Tarpaulin entertained by Charon, but
he was in a most cruel torture, for his body was covered thick all over with
Pitch and Tar, which burnt and flamed round about him: And here the Trance
left me.

Having thus come out of this sad swound, I began by a serious recollection of
my self to recall to my thoughts those dismal and dreadful objects that had
appeared unto me; for though I was in Hell I did not taste of Lethe all the
while, so that I did not forget any thing that I had seen; all things seemed to
appear unto me so really, that if I had been of that opinion (whereof many have
been) that Devils are nothing else but the ill affections, the exorbitant
passions, and perturbances of the mind, it had been able to have convinced me.
The Reader may easily imagine what apprehensions of horror these apparitions
left in my brain: For as a River being by an inundation swelled out of her
wonted Channel leaves along the neighboring Meadows seggs and sands, and much
riff-raff stuff behind her upon her return to her former bed; So did this
Extasis, with that deluge of objects wherewith it overwhelmed my brain, leave
behind it black sudds, and ghastly thoughts with in me, which have done me no
hurt I thank God for it, it being a true rule that Malum cognitum facilius
evitatur: And I wish they may produce the same effects in the Reader as they
did in the Author. We find in the Sacred Oracles that Dives in his discourse
from Hell with Abraham, wished that some body might be sent from the dead to
inform and reclaim his Brothers upon earth, because the words of a dead man
would gain more credit with them then any others. Let the Readers of this
Trance make account that the Author was such a one; for he has been buried
many years, and so let it work within him accordingly.

FINIS.
