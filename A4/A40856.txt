LONDON, Printed by R. I. for Francis Grove dwelling on Snow-Hill.

When Love and Valor both together meet,
The Story is most pleasing, and most sweet;
Here you may read how Fortune led him on,
And did advance him first to Venus Throne:
Three nights be reigned, but then deposed himself,
From Loves fond kingdom, having spent Loves wealth,
To other Kingdoms then he travailes forth;
First Ireland was acquainted with his worth,
Then boisterous winds did force his Ship on Spain,
Where he a Spanish Ladies Love did gain,
Was freed by her from danger, but at last
Fortune when all these fair bright days were past,
Led him unto the Wars in Barbary,
Where he did in his friends embraces dye;
Lovers embraces do grow loose and end,
But Friends embraces are fast to their friend;
Thus lusty Stukley lived, thus Stukley died,
His fame is in this Story glorified.
The Famous History of stout STVKLEY.
IF you delight to read the passages of Love, and to see how affection soon
cooles when the little smith Cupid does cease to blow with his amorous Bellows,
you may here read this History of Thomas Stukley a Gentleman, a Lover and a
Soldier. Fortune brought him first acquainted with the only Daughter of Sir
Thomas Curtis, whose name was Nell; she had at that time another Suter one
Vernon, of a noble soul, and gentle Nature; but he finding that his friend Tho:
Stukley was in love with Nell and beloved by her, their affections being
mutual, and state equal, he expressing therein the part of a worthy and noble
friend, left the sole happiness of his heart to his friend Tho: Stukley
resigning up his right and interest unto him, and afterward to smother his
discontents, and beat off the remembrance of his forsaken Sweetheart, he
travells beyond Sea, so at once to lose her name and memory Now Stukley being
them an entertained to his friends felicity, both by the father, and mother,
and beloved by Nell: after some exchange of Ceremonies about the contract, some
chiding of her for her choice, which are usual matters; Stukley was received
by Sir Thom. Curtis and his wife, for their son, and by Nell for her wished
husband. Suppose now their wedding was desired to be kept with great cost and
solemnity, and in the mean time the promised Bride fed upon the expectation of
the wedding night.

Chap. II. How old Stukley came up to London to see his son, and how young
Stukley acquainted his father with his intended Marriage.
FAme having reported unto old Master Stukley, that his Son had gotten into the
favor and affection of Sir Thomas Curtis's daughter, he comes presently up to
London in all haste, and first he goes to visit his son young Stukley at the
Temple, and to come upon him like an old Fox unawares, that he might take him
in the security of all his youthful negligence; so coming to his Chamber, he
knocks, and finds no body within but his Page, who had a ready wit to give his
old Master an answer in his young Masters behalf, at last Stukley bids his Page
deliver him the key of his Study, but the Page, to save his Masters credit,
told him that he ever carried it about with him, but at last the old man
peeping about found the door standing open, and there discovers his Sons books,
which were these following, Long-Sword, Short-Sword and Buckler, Foxes and
Bilboes Blades, but never a Candle-stick but an old Hilt of a broken sword, and
the bottom of a Temple Pot, with a little sarsenet in it, did serve him for a
Candlestick; at last comes in Stukley not suspecting that his Father was there,
but at last perceiving that he had been taking an Inventory of his Books, and
House-hold-stuff, he kneeles down to receive his Fathers blessing, who at first
begins to scold at him, but he puts him out with other questions; at last he
begins to come over him with honest wholesome counsel, upbraiding him with those
that were of his age, setting the^ before him as examples of good Students and
thrifty young Gentlemen, but Stukley told his father that Iohn-a-Nokes, and
Iohn-a-Stiles and he could not coten, and that the French Law was worse than
buttered Mackerell full of bones; at last he plainly told his Father, that in
stead of scratching things out of a Standish all a man's life time he had found
out a nearer cut to preferment, which was, that he was in possibility to marry
Alderman Curtis his Daughter, and therefore if his father would but promise the
Alderman that he should make her a Ioynture, all would be done, for he had his
daughters good will already: Old Stukley conceiving the plot it being a matter
of gain, where by his son should obtain a wife worth forty thousand pounds, he
presently consents to his son, who had already tampered the Wench wrought the
Alderman and his wife, and now persuaded his father to assist to this matter of
money, and so you must expect his Marriage.

Chap. III. How Stukley was married, and how on his VVedding-day he fell out
with one Herbert, about some disgraceful speeches, and how Vernon went to
travel.
NOw came the wedding day, and the Bride like a spreading Rose opened all her
beauties, desiring to be gathered; Stukeley, that had put on his best Apparel,
was ready to do the service of a Bridegroom, wherewith he had been acquainted
and was no Novice in Cupids ways; but as the Bride sat simpering at dinner,
and the old folks conceiting their Daughters happiness, it chanced that a
sudden accident disturbed Hymen's Feast, some words had past between one M.
Herbert and Stukley, Herbert prophesying to this effect that Ald. Curtis had
undone his daughter by this marriage; Stukley being angry hereat presently
challenged Harbert, and they presently rose from the table, but were at last by
the Alderm. persuasions pacified and the brides tears, who loath to lose her
Stukley, and to be divorced from him on the wedding day, wrought so with
Herbert, that their quarrel was deferred until a fitter opportunity, when they
might both question and decide the former injury; so the wound given to Stukley
was for a while closed up, and the wedding went forward to the Aldermans
contentment, and the old mothers great joy, who was glad in her daughters
behalf; and now Candles were lighted, Supper was served in, and after many
dishes had been rifled, and a Banquet wholly destroyed by the Guests, after
many Ceremonies, the long delayed night growing on, Stukley and his beloved
Nell were brought into their VVedding-Chamber, and the Bride like a Sacrifice
laid into her bed, while merry T. Stukley taught to see fear and desire
expressing themselves in the blushes of Nells cheeks; and now the Curtains
being drawn all the company left them, and what followed must be left to your
imaginations.

Chap. IV. How Vernon resolved to go into Ireland with Herbert and another
Captain, and how Stukley paid all his Creditors.
NOble and brave-minded Vernon. having crossed himself in love, by giving away
the treasure of his soul, and now drooping like a shadow, having lost the
substance which he followed, to ease his discontent, and change his mind, and
forget Nell, fresh yet in his remembrance, resolves to travel, and by changing
his air to change his mind, and thereupon imparts his purpose and design to
two friends of his, Hamdon and Ridley, they with many powerful reasons
dissuaded him, all which he answers, and by admitting no argument to the
contrary, so far prevailed with his friends, that they unwillingly consented
to his desire, which was to travel, and first to go into Ireland with Master
Herbert and another Captain; Herbert going also to the wars, and intending if
ever he met Stukley he would draw out their former quarrel in characters of
blood, and be revenged of Stukley, and with these purposes and intents Vernon
and Harbert went to the wars in Ireland: now Stukeley having performed his
first prize on the Wedding night with his kind Nell Alderman Curtis his
daughter, was somewhat prettily abated in his wild fancies, and had been
humbled by his own insolent spirit, whereupon the wives portion was the next
Virgin must be ransackt; he had gathered all the Flowers and Roses which Love
and Poetry can imagine, and now he came to the golden Apples of his wives
Portion, and first he had occasion to begin with some old debts, which his
youth in the days of his Batchelorship had run into; and first there comes to
visit him a crew of old debtors, namely Arthur Cross the Mercer, John Spring
the Vintner, Will. Sharp the Cutler, Thump the Bucklemaker. George Hazard the
Tennis-keeper, Henry Crack Fencer, and Jeffery B^urt Bailieffe of Finsbury, all
these came after him with Bills and Notes in their hands to visit him in the
health of a good Fortune; Stukley seeing such a number of Citizens and trading
fellows came to claim moneys before he was scarce warm in his new Marriage,
he being of a generous spirit, and accounting money but the admiration of
dunghill Clownes and Peasants, presently summons all his Creditors, and makes
his old father Curtis do a deed of conscience and pay to Mr. Cross the Mercer
for Silks and Velvets two hundred pounds, to M. Spring the Vintner for Tavern
Suppers and Wine thirty pounds; to Sharp for Bilboes Foxes and Toledo Blades
forty Marks, to Mr. Thump the Buckle-ma^^r for broad lined Bucklers and steel
Pikes, fifteen pound; to Hazard the Tennis-keeper, for Tennis Balls, thirteen
pound; to Crack the Fencer for forfeits and venies given, thirty crowns, and to
the Bailieffe of Finsbury for Rapes and Bloodsheds in the Fields, five Marks.
Old Curtis having paid these several debts and legacies, bequeathed to vanity
and youths folly, put the old man into a kind of rage, and wounded his baggs
so, that the old man's conscience smarting in the behalf thereof, he began to
cry out upon Stukley, and to tell him as old Fathers will do, that his daughter
was a destroyed creature, and quite overthrown, and he a Prodigal; whereupon
Stukley informed him of the equity of the action in paying his debts; and that
seeing he had satisfied his daughters whole sum of love in a round manner,
therefore he ought to satisfy these pedling debts, but this could not appease
the wrong he had done old Curtis, sensible in a deep manner of the payment of
these debts; whereupon Stukley left him to make a tedious complaint to his old
wife Lady Curtis, who apprehended the matter with the like passion, and both of
them join together to make old Stukley out of conceit with his mad Son Tom
Stukley; and the conclusion of all their accusation ended concerning Tom
Stukleys prodigality, which his father strove to excuse, but would not defend,
though he knew his high mind and contempt of money, but thought he, he is my
own son, that prefers credit in a good cause, before coin, and makes a Wife but
a piece of vendible hous-hold-stuff that may be converted to a proper man's
uses; but he dissembled with the old Alderman Curtis and his wife, thinking
their hearts were drowned in the baggs that Tom Stukley had emptied and they
feared this was but the beginning of the miseries of their daughters marriage.

Chap. V. How Stukley, though dissuaded by his wife his Father-in-law Alderman
Curtis, and old Stukley his own Father, would yet needs go to the wars in
Ireland.
STout Stukley having begun the new life of marriage with a brave act in paying
his Creditors with part of his wives portion, was now enflamed with a new
desire, and had entertained a fresh affection to honor, pettycoat-fancies were
blown and stale, things of common enjoying, and therefore now his thoughts were
wholly fixed on the wars, no soft and gentle whisperings which his wife could
in vent, though mixed with wanton willing kisses, could detain him in her
embraces, he must away, and though the power of Love commanded him to stay, yet
valor drew him to the wars then maintained in Ireland; when his wife
perceived his purpose, she set all the spells of Love to work, and conjured him
a bed; not to go to the wars, but he answered all her objections, and told
her, that though he should leave her poor he intending to take with him all her
Jewels, and the money which he received for her portion, yet both their fathers
would maintain her to her own content, so that after many exchanges of loving
kindnesses, not here to be repeated, she sought with tears to make him more
soft and compassionate; will you be gone said she after three days? are we
scarce warm in love, and shall we be divorced again before our joys are
scarcely perfected? tepetitions in Loves School make the best Scholars, and
when you go I shall forget that new Lesson which you taught me, for when you
are gone I must live widdowed of all former comfort, therefore recall that
hasty word, and since you had my heart, and cannot give back what you have
received, stay with me, in me enjoy the world, in me behold the wars, I Will be
your foe, yet never kill you, unless it be with kindness. When she had
breathed forth this sad complaint unto Stukley, he sighed and said, Nell, your
complements are good, and such as speak your heart, but I must go, therefore
give me thy consent, and then I shall depart with a cheerful Resolution to the
wars in Ireland. When they were agreed, and after much debating of the matter,
had consented to a separation; for a time, his Father-in-law Curtis, and his
own Father old Stukley set upon him with many old moldy reasons, intending to
dissuade him from going to the wars, but he soon gave him an answer, and made
them soon to understand the power of valor, whereof the poor old Dons were
insensible, loving security before honor, and so Stukley having now fealed a
farewell on Nells lips, and took his leave of his two old Dads, carried over a
company of Soldiers to the wars.

Chap. VI. How Stukley met with Vernon and Herbert in Ireland, and how he was
shut out of the Town by Herbert, Governor of the Town for the English.
THe Wars continuing in Ireland, Stukley, as was said, went over with a brave
Company of soldiers to aid them against the Irish Rebels, and coming to a
strong English Town called Dundalke, summoned them to the walls with his
Drum; whereupon presently appeared Vernon, Gainsford, and other Soldiers,
and at last Harbert who was Governor of the town; and at their first
interview, grief and anger strove in their breasts, Vernon was sorry to see
him that had robbed him of the jewel of his love and life Nell Ald. Curtis his
daughter and to increase his sorrow* Stukley's Lieutenant delivered him a
Letter, wherein he understood from one W. Mallery, that Stukley had used his
wife unkindly, wherewith Vernon acquainted Stukley and told him that it seemed
he did not love his wife, but was unkind, and did not make much of her,
whereupon Stukley told hm that he made very much of her, for he had made away
her portion and plate, her jewels and rings, and all her clothes except one
poor gown, and he that can make more of one poor wife, let him take her:
Vernon, hearing this was much grieved at Stukley, that he should use her so
unkindly, and to avoid the hated sight of Stukley, he resolved to travel into
Spain or France, and leave the wars; after this Harbert the Governor
commanded Stukley to bring his company into the town, where being entered, he
begins to renew his quarrel with Harbert, about words spoken in England, which
were, that old Sir Tho Curtis had cast away his daughter upon him, but being
ready to fight, the enemy charged against the walls, whereupon they were fain
to desist and leave off, to make a sally sorth upon the Irish, whom they soon
put to flight and pursued, retiring afterward again; but Stukley and his
company drawn on with the hope of booty, pursued the Irish so far that the City
gates were shut, at last Stukley returning with a great booty of Cows gotten
from the Irish, Harbert, Governor of the Town, would not suffer Stukley to be
admitted within the gates, hoping the Irish would come down and cut both
Stukleys throat and all his soldiers; this affront Stukley took in such
dudgeon, waiting opportunity to be revenged on Harbert, that be gave all the
former booty to his soldiers, except thirty horses or hobbies, which he sent
aboard, and giving his soldiers a hundred pound to drink for his sake, he went
aboard his ship to try his fortune in some other Country.

Chap. VII. How Stukley denied the Governor of Cales in Spain five of his
horses, and was by the Governor committed to prison, and how the Governors wife
fell in love with him.
FOrtune being willing to try the brave and generous mind of Stukley, put such
winds into the sails of his ships, as drove him perforce into a harbor upon
the Spanish Coast; being here arrived, notice was given to the Governor; and
five of his horses demanded as a present for the Governor, which he denied and
thereupon being brought before him, he told him that he should not have a hair
of one of his hobbies, nor a nail of one of them, though he would draw it with
his teeth. Stukley, and the Spanish Governor being thus at debate, the
Govornours wife being then present, and beholding Stukley, began to entertain a
thought of love toward him, and in her mind silently commended him for a brave
proper man, wishing she could excuse his rudeness toward her husband the proud
Spaniard; at last, Stukley still contesting with the Governor, he both seized
upon his ship and horses, and committed him to prison, intending to inform the
King of Spain of Stukleys, stout carriage; he being carried away, the
Governors Lady began to persuade her husband in his behalf, and to work him
to a milder temper toward Stukley, but all in vain, whereupon she commanded the
Provost that was ready to carry him to the Marshallsey, to bring him to her,
and when he was come into her presence, she began to persuade him to submit
unto her husband, but that not prevailing, she offered him further help,
insomuch that Stukley had obtained one of his Hobbies, and leave to ride unto
the King of Spaines Court in her husbands absence, promising upon the honor of
an Englishman, word to return by six a clock in the evening, whereupon the
Spanish Lady took his word, and he repaired to the Spanish Court.

Chap. VIII. How Stukley went to the King of Spain, and returned again
according to his promise to the Spanish Lady.
VAliant Stukley, being mounted upon one of his Hobbies, posts away to the K.
of Spains Court, and, being admitted to his presence, lets his Majesty
understand how that he coming to Cales Don Herando his Majesty's Governor, had
there attached both his Ship and all therein, together with thirty Hobbies
brought to present unto his Majesty and had clapped him in prison from whence he
had by good fortune escaped, to bring his Majesty acquainted with his wrongs
and injuries: Now all the while that Stukley was gone to the Court, the
Governors wife and the provost were in a great perplexity, lest Herando (for so
was the Governor called) should discover the matter, and especially because he
had command that he should be brought before him, the Provost knew not what to
say or do, for he knew Stukley was out of his reach, but his wife whose wit was
sharpened by love and fear, told her frowning husband, that the English Captain
was changed by his imprisonment and his high mind come down, being willing to
offer submission if accepted, and was penning an humble Petition to that
effect: this pleased the Spaniards ambition, being glad to make virtue stoop
unto his pride: at last he would needs fetch Stukley himself and commanded the
Provost to give him the Key of the Iayl, but then his wife with her womanish
wit told him that there were many sick in Prison, and therefore it would be
dangerous for his Lordship to venture in amongst them; Thus did she seek to
stay his furious anger, and to keep all matters safe from his knowledge; at
last when she had spent her last excuse, and that she knew not how to devise
another, in comes Stukley in gives and fetters led by the Provost, which
comforted the poor Lady, but the Governor expecting submission, found nothing
less, but began to threaten him with death when presently a Marshall arrives
sent from the K. of Spain to apprehend him and bring him before him: whereupon
he began to flatter Stukley, protesting that all he had done was but to try his
fortitude and valor, and Stukley desiring the Lady to let him know how he
might gratify her love she answered that virtue was reward enough unto it
self, giving him a Scarf to wear also for her sake, which he with complement
received, and so he and Herando went to the Court where he gave all his thirty
Hobbies to the King of Spain, which were so graciously by him received, that he
was much esteemed by the King. Now it happened that Vernon whom he had made to
wear the willow-Garland, escaping the fury of a Tyrant storm all the rest being
sunck and perished, and being abused by the Governor of the Haven wherinto
they were driven, came also to complain unto the King for redress of his
grievances, where he presently beheld Stukley, who being in high favor with
the King, spoke unto his Majesty in Vernons behalf, but Vernon grieved at the
sight of him, and sorry that he should still become the hateful object of his
sight, which he shunned, shrunk away with discontent and anger. But afterward
Stukley grew in great honor, for the King of Spain would needs send him
Ambassador to the Pope, to know if he might aid Don Sebastian himself, in his
Wars in Africa against the Barbarians, and commanded that five thousand Ducats
should be delivered to him, who though he sought to avoid so great an
employment, yet at last he was fain to accept thereof, but when he was to
receive the five thousand Ducats because there wanted twenty of the five
thousand he would receive none, but taking it as a disgrace, it was told him
that the bags would receive no more; but he imagining that the King had
abridged his bounty, would receive none of them, but bid them tell the King
that he would bear the charge of the Embassage himself: So being come to Rome,
he was created by the Pope Marquis of Ireland, and so contrary to his
intention, he imbarks with his Italian bands for Italy; but the winds
conspiring to discover his treachery, drove him a shore on the West of
Barbary, and so with Philips forces landed there, and were received into the
Town of Terrill in Barbary; at last the day came when the great battle of
Alcazal was to be fought, and the earth made to blush with the blood of
Spaniards and Turks, in which battle, three Kings (to make it a Royal field)
were slain, and Stukley behaved himself to the wonder and amazement of all
Nations, and to the glory of his own Country, and being faint and wounded, met
with Vernon, unto whom he had always been like a walking Apparition or Ghost,
and ever hanted him, but now death thought to make them friends whom life could
not reconcile: and now Vernon told him the sum of all his story, which was,
that after he resigned up his right and title to Alderman Curtis his daughter,
he did always avoid his sight, because it did refresh the remembrance of Nell,
but yet still they met in Ireland, Spain, and Rome, and now at last in Africa,
and here we must part again by death. Stukley sighing said; I hope, though we
part here on earth, we shall meet in Heaven, for Vernon, we were always
friends, we bore one mind, loved one Woman, and breathed one air, followed one
kind of life, and now we shall dye one kind of death, yet let this be our
comfort, that our fame shall after death survive, and our blood mingle with the
blood of Kings, and our names remembered by posterity: so having mutually asked
forgiveness of each other, they embraced like a pair of noble constant friends,
and then to accomplish their Tragedy, Stuklies Soldiers mutining against him,
came and found Vernon and he thus embracing, whereupon Vernon asked the furious
Soldiers whether they would mutiny against their Leader, whereunto the bloody
Soldiers replied, that if Stukley their leader had kept his oath which he
swore unto the Pope, they had been safe in Ireland, and had not traveled to
find out a foreign grave in Africa, and therefore they would stab Stukley to
the heart, that had thus brought them all to untimely deaths. When Vernon saw
how they were incensed against his friend Stukley, he began to persuade them in
his friends behalf, but sooner might he move a Lioness robbed of her young, or
with soft and gentle words make the sea waves leave raging, then reduce these
soldiers to a milder temper; so that desparing of any mercy from such
iron-hearted minds, he desired them that since they were bent to sacrifice
their Captain to their offended wrath, they wo^ld first execute their wrath on
him and let his blood quench their fury, and thus like another Priades he
pleaded for his friend Orestes; when he had seen the faithful love of Vernon
and how he desired to die for his friend, he desired his Soldiers to hear him
speak but one word: but they all cried and said, stab him, stab him but then
when words and persuasions could not take place. Vernon like a noble friend
enterposes himself to save Stukley, and with his sword labors to preserve his
life, but all in vain; Virtue has his period, beyond which it cannot pass, and
must be mortal here, that it may gain immortality hereafter: oppressed with the
multitude, like Hercules fighting with too great odds, so Vernon fighting for
his friend Stukley falls in the Skirmish, and then the soldiers rushing in
upon Stukley, stabbed him to the heart, then Love and valor lying both a
bleeding in the open field Stukley concludes his life with these Words,
Villains have you slain my friend.
Then here my love and life does end.


Stukley again being mortally wounded said, farewell Vernon, Fortune was and --
but before he could end his speech, his life ended, both dying one death, like
the Pictures of two friends, on whom an Epitaph might be writ, though the story
says, that Stukley was afterward buried, and had a most royal Tomb built
over him for his Monument; and thus lived and dyed the valiant stout Stukley.

The famous life and death of the renowned English gallant, Thomas Stukley, who
lived in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and ended his days in a Battle of three
Kings in Barbary.
To the Tune of, Henry's going to Bulloin.
IN England in the West,
Where Phoebus takes his rest,
There Lusty Stukley he was born;
by birth he was a Clothiers son,
deeds of wonder he has done,
Which with lasting praise his name adorn
Lusty Stukley he was named,
and a broad much honor gained,
For so reports the story of his life,
he married with a London Dame,
daughter to an Alderman,
And had great store of treasure with his wife.
But he in riot soon,
her portion did consume,
Which struck old Curtis so unto the heart,
who was his wives own father,
that he with age, or rather
With sorrow, did this life depart,
When he was laid in earth,
Stukley began his mirth,
His golden Angels then began to fly,
he night by night in pleasure,
did melt away his treasure,
And wished that his loving wife would die,
While vice he maintained,
his wants at last constrained
Him for to sell the pavements of his yard,
which with blocks of Tin were lined,
old Curtis left the same behind,
But he the same did never the more regard,
His wife hereat lamented,
and was much discontented,
Make much of me dear husband she did cry,
I Will make much more sweetheart of thee
Than any other shall, quoth he,
I Will sell thy clothes and so from England fly
so first he went for Italy,
and then again to Barbary,
Where by his valor he did soon obtain
the Standard royal for to bear
while in one field did appear
Three Kings their rights for to maintain.
The Sun did never behold
a battle fought more bold
And afterward brave Stukley there was sla^n
by those Italians of great worth
which Stuk^ey to the stei^ drew forth,
And thus unto himself he did complain,
Was I mad, or did I rave
thus to seen a ^orreign grave,
And at home abuse my loving wife?
Stukley on the ground now lies
like to Mars his sacrifice,
And bleeding here must end my wretched life.
And with this word his breath
was stopped soon by death,
His empty body lay upon the groun^,
which buried once, they did make,
a royal Tomb or Stukl^'s sake.
And still his noble valor is renound.
FINIS.
