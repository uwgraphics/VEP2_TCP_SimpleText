News from Dunkirke.
DUnkirke is a Town of Flanders of great strength and circuit; some five
leagues or hours going from Calice in France, being indeed the only
considerable Port of Flaunders, Graveling, Newport, Ostend and Sluice, though
all bearing the name of Havens, being indeed rather mere Fisher-Townes, then
worthy of that title, ships of above sixty Tun, being debarred entertainment
into them. When over the sandy bar of Dunkirke, at a high tide safely may pass
Vessels of four and five hundred Tun into the very Town walls, nay within
their outworks, or safely ride if not in very great tempests, under the
protection of the Forts of Mardike, and the wooden Fort, which being a
miraculous Fabric of timber, extended far into the maine Sea, secures all
there with its commanding Ordnance, at least a large league and a half before
you come to Dunkirke. This then is the rendevouz for all the King of Spaines
ships; this is that Town which makes a benefit of that which is destruction to
others; they are g^owne abundantly wealthy by their spoils, taken both from
the Hollander and French; this is that Town which in our lusts and former
contentions with Spain, has infested so obnoxiously our Seas with the
excursions of their nimble Frigates. To conclude* this is a Town which for
plenty of mariners of all Nations, multitudes of soldiers, and light, nimble,
and serviceable Ships and Frigots, gives place to never a Town of Christendom
of its dimensions; Here constantly have those disturbers of our public peace
and seducers of our people from the true Religion, those fugitive English
Jesuits. Constantly in the Dutch College of the same Society there, their
Agents resident, who lie as it were intelligencers there, to receive news from
their pernicious brethren in England of their succeeding there: For though the
care of this present sacred Parliament have taken what possible order can be
thought on for extirpation of that brood of Vipers; yet in all this Session has
there not one o^ the Jesuits bin apprehended or brought to condign
punishment, the sword of justice lighting only on the less hurtful branches
of that poisonous Romish Tree, that would shadow all the corners of the earth;
the Friars and secular Priests, the Popes Assasine Champions, the Jesuits,
though certainly many of them are obscured in this Kingdom, nay in this very
City, under strange names and habits, being as full of craft as their
generality in the Devil; keeping themselves not only from detection but
surprision: But to our purpose, these base bastards to their Country, and
m^screants to Heaven and truth; having these Agents in Dunkirke, do constantly
give notice to their superiors at their fore-neighbouring Colleges, Watton
and Saint Omers; the former being the Noviship or Domus probationis of their
order, three leagues and a half from Dunkirke, the other their Seminary, where
they teach children only the rudiments of Gramaticke learning, a league and a
half further off* All accidents that have happened in this Kingdom, in these
lamentable and distracted times, they again transferring that notice by their
Emissaries to their Agent at the Court at Bruxels, who is now their
Vice-Provinciall (their Provincial being here in England) Father Sibesden,
right^y Bedinfield, a man of much precious sanctity, but inward and real
craft, who makes what use he can of those advertisements to the advancement of
the Catholic cause, as they call it, hearing therefore as quae regio in
terris nostri non plena laboris, of the still emergent distractions between His
Majesty and the Parliament, which certainly took their Original from some
Jesuitical counselors. This Sibisdin or Bedinfield, call him whether you
please, has lately been very urgent with Don Francisco De Mela, the Spanish
Prefect now in Flaunders, and with his Council, in which the Jesuits have no
small party to command of the Dunkirke Frigates, to be made ready and fraught
with such soldiers as are there of our Nation, under the Regiment of Colonel
Guy, with such Ammunition as the Jesuits his fellows could provide at their
own charge to be sent into the North of England, to be landed there for the
assistance of the malignants against the Parliament, intimating to him how
acceptable that service would be to his Holiness, and the Conclave at Rome,
how advantageous to the advancement of the Catholic cause, and
re-establishment of their Religion here in England; nay, that he was even in
part of his honor engaged to return these soldiers back: His Majesty the
King of England now he had need of them, himself when he had bin so courteously
permitted to condescend to the Spaniards assistance, and lastly, that this
action would not only be unpre judicial to the league now in force with
England, but rather an additament to cement it faster. It being made with the
King of England, to whom the Parliament was refractory, and with open arms
sought to diminish His Royalty, and bring in instead of the Protestant Religion
(which was less opposite to theirs) Puritanisme, Brownisme, or Anabaptisme. So
malicious are these miscreants, and apt to traduce the Parliaments honorable,
just and religious proceedings. Don Francisco de Mela, a Portuguise by Nation,
a person of a sound and solid judgment, not easily to be misled by such Ignes
faetui, or false fires, mildly answered his reverence, that though he wished as
well to the Catholic cause as any, and ought His Majesty of England as much
service as any foreign Prince whatsoever; yet that he durst not without
express command of the King his Master, send any of his Frigates to their
places, or employ them to other uses, then to the guard of the Flemish Coast
against their inveterate adversary the Hollanders who, for the alliance they
have to the State of Engl. to which they were engaged, would be sure to
interrupt them in their passage, that for the English Regiments, though they
were King Charles his Subjects, they were King Philips soldiers there, ere he
came to the government, and that he was resolved to leave all things in those
Provinces as he found them; that he could not with the safety of his wisdom
or allegiance to his Masters service, dimisse so many able and experienced
soldiers, dangers both from neighboring France, and not far distant
Holland, threatening on every side those Countries, that for the quarrel or
contention between his Majesty of great Britain and his Parliament, as he was
unconcerned in it, so he was resolved not to intermeddle in other men's
business, but to preserve the league nnviolate, and for their reverences, the
Fathers of the society, purchasing ammunition to transfer hither, Don
Francisco told Father Silisden, that they might Con muy buena gana, with all
his heart use their own discretion, do with their money what they please; he
would neither give them commission for transportation, or laying any such
provision, nor yet impeach their purpose, and so desired to be excused from any
further trouble in the motion of that business which he could neither in
honor nor salva obedientia to his Master, put in practice; Father Silisden
intimating this unexpected resolution of Don Francisco, to Father Iarret and
Father Worsley the Rector of Watton and Saint Omers, and by the counsel of
Father Freeman the Rector of Gaunt, and Father Spencer, the Rector of Liege
(these being all the Rectors and Colleges of those demy-Divels in those
Countries, out of their common treasury levied the sum of ten thousand
pounds, and from their great friends and intimates, the wealthy Benedictine
Nuns at Buxels, Gaunt and Cambray, all English Voteries, they borrowed six
thousand pounds more, which sums delivered into the hands of one Coldwell an
English man of ability in Dunkirk, and a Brewer; after he had purchased
therewith much match* Pistols, Carabines, Powder, and other ammunition, and
waited for an opportunity to transport it into the North of England in the
Coleships, which bring that much esteemed Jewel from Newcastle hither, but
failing of those intentions by directions from his great Patrons the aforesaid
Jesuits, he made purchase of three good tall barks, (which are very good cheap
at Dunkirk) French bottoms, that they might pass without examination from the
Hollander, and in them landed this Ammunition: committing the care thereof, and
the Barks to some English Mariners, of which there are plenty always at that
town, and so with a good Gale of wind, they set forth for the Coast of
England, and after two days being at Sea, off from the Coast of Holland, some
of the Statesmen of War, continually hovering about those Coasts, had espied
them, and taking them for French, both by their building and Colors,
friendlily had permitted them to pass, had not they had an express command to
stay all Vessels, passing along those coasts; and examine them whither they
were bound, and how laden, lest they might either be Danes, or bound thither
with ammunition, so being haled abord, they knowing it was in vain to resist,
struck their tops, and came in, affirming themselves French, bound from Saint
Maloes, to Boston in Lincolnshire, but they having examined their lading, and
found most of its Ammunition, began to ask for their Cockets, which produced,
testifies what they had declared, but one of the States Soldiers, an
Englishman, running between Decks, found there in their admiral, some twenty
young and middle-aged men* which by their complexion appeared rather French,
then making bolts therefore to search some of their pockets by diverse letters
he found, both what they were, whence they came, and whether they, and their
ladings were bound, giving notice of it with certain, that the men were
Priests, for so indeed they wete, most of them new-made-ones, that this
Micha^lmachado startet out of their Colleges at Rome Civil, and Valladolid in
Spain, out of a desperate bravery intending hither to defy our just Laws,
and seduce the people with their false Doctrine, and die as they believe
instead of Malefactors, which indeed they are Martyrs: the Captain instantly
conjecturing, and they upon examination, confessing whither they were bound,
and from whom sent with those Provisions, made lawful prise of them, sending
them after to Rotterdam, where both the Mariners and Priests are in prison
Thus we may see what plots the wicked have against us, and how the Lord in his
mercy bring the practices of the heathen to naught, so that we may hope he will
give us peace and safety in our dwellings, which God grant, Amen.

FINIS.
