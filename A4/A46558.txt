Henry the Eighth, for Prizing of VVines, it is Provided that the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, Lord President of the Kings most Honorable
Council, Lord Privy Seal, and the Lord Chief Justices of either Bench, or Five,
Four or Three of them, shall have Power and Authority by their Discretion to
set the Prices of all kinds of VVines, as in the said Statute is expressed: By
virtue whereof the Lord Chancellor, Lord President, the Lord Chief Justice of
the Court of King's Bench, and the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common
Pleas, the Twelfth day of this instant December, upon Consideration of the
present State of the Canary Trade, did Order that no Canary Wine be Sold for
the ensuing Year at more than Nine pence per Pint by Retail, and Twenty eight
pounds per Pipe in Gross. Now that all cause of excuse may be taken away, and
that such as shall be found Delinquents herein, may acknowledge their own
wilfulness to be the cause of the Danger and Penalty they fall into, after
Avertisement. His Majesty's Will and Pleasure is, and by the Advice of the
said Lords and the rest of His Privy Council, according to one other Statute in
that behalf made in the Fourth year of the Reign of His most Noble Progenitor
King Edward the Third, by this His Royal Proclamation does Publish and Declare,
That for One Year next following, to be accounted from the First day of
February next, Canary VVines be not Sold by Retail at more than Nine pence the
Pint, and in Gross at more than Twenty eight pounds the Pipe, and according to
these Rates (and no Higher) in proportion for greater or lesser Quantities,
either in Gross or by Retail, which Rates and Prices His Majesty's Pleasure is,
shall be duly observed in all His Ports and other Places within this Realm
where VVines are Landed, or within Ten Miles of those Ports and Places. And it
is His Majesty's Pleasure, That in Places where Canary VVines by Land Carriage
shall be conveyed more than Ten Miles from the next Port, the said VVines shall
and may be Sold according to the Rates aforesaid, with an allowance not
exceeding Four Pounds the Tun, and One penny the Quart for Carriage thereof upon
Land every Thirty Miles, and according to that proportion, and not at greater
Rates, str^ctly Charging and Commanding such of His Subjects and others whom it
shall concern, That none of them during the time aforesaid presume to sell any
of the said Canary VVines in Gross or by Retail at h^gher Rates than by this
His Majesty's Proclamation are appointed, under the Forfeitures and Penalties
mentioned in the said Statute, and other the Laws and Statutes of th^s Realm
Ordained in that behalf, and such further Pains and Penalties as by the Laws
and Statutes of this Realm can or may be Inflicted upon wilful Contemners of
His Majesty's Royal Command and Proclamation: Requiring and Commanding all
Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, Bailiffs, Customers and Comptrollers,
and other Officers of His Majesty's Ports, and all others whom it shall
concern, diligently to observe and attend the Execution of this His Royal
Pleasure, and to give Information to the Lords and others of the Privy Council,
of the Delinquents, that they may be proceeded against, and receive Punishment
according to their demerits.
