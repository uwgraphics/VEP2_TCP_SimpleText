These are therefore to give notice thereof to all persons concerned; And we do
hereby strictly charge and command all such Officers, of what Degree soever
(excepting Members of the Privy Council) as are now absent from their Garrisons
or Quarters without License from Us, immediately after publication hereof, to
return to the same, and there continue without absenting themselves upon any
pretense whatsoever; and also that every of the said Officers who are now

service of their places, wherein We expect punctual obedience; for as We shall
be careful to inform Our selves of any that shall neglect to observe Our

Articles of War in that case provided.
