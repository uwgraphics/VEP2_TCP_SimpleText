ANNOTATIONS UPON Some DIFFICULT TEXTS In all the BOOKS OF THE New Testament.

By Sr Norton Knatchbull Knight and Bart.

CAMBRIDGE, Printed by J. Hayes, Printer to the University; for W. Graves
Bookseller there. 1693.

THE PUBLISHER TO The Reader.
THese Annotations are entirely the product, and result of all those Critical
Researches into, and most solid and happy Conjectures upon the most Difficult
passages of the New Testament, made by the sincerely Religious, and profoundly
Judicious, as well as Learned Author, the late Sr Norton Knatchbull Knight and
Bart: and which are only and altogether his own particular discovery's, and
most Select observations. Upon which account, that most distinguishing
character, and singular Elogy given by St Luke to those more noble Berean
Converts, Act. 17.11. (...).
is most eminently due to Him, who with a like truly noble and generous
disposition, with the same pious intention, and application of mind, and with
equal success, (...).
daily searched (or as that word imports, and more significantly might be
rendered) critically conferred, or compared the Scriptures together, whether
those things were so. Of which most exact and diligent scrutiny of his into
those Holy Oracles, this evident proof, and lasting Monument will remain to
Posterity; which therefore by most Competent Judges is thought most worthy to
be recommended, and communicated, as a more useful, elaborate, and succesful
Essay in its kind then has hitherto been published. In which, the most proper
sense, and right use of each ambiguous particle, word, and phrase; and likewise
the genuine construction of all those intricate periods, obscure transitions,
and most perplexing trajections which occurr frequently in those Sacred
Writers, are vindicated, and cleared, by a more plain, and accurate Version, or
a more intelligible, and commodious Exposition of them. Concerning which,
perhaps it may not be impertinent to give the Learned Reader especially, this
further Advertisement; namely, that this is not a bare Translation only of the
former Latin Edition thrice Printed at Oxford, which is now put into his hands;
but this English Copy (as that word is commonly understood by the Booksellers,)
may rather be esteemed as an Original Piece, or a new, more complete, and
perfect draught, begun, and finished afterward by the same hand; by which it
is besides very much enlarged with diverse interpolations, and an addition of
new Remarques upon several other Texts. The whole Work, with the Latin Preface
now set before it, as it was also found together with it, being fairly
transcribed, and prepared for the Press, by the Author himself, as it is most
probably supposed, not long before his death.

AN ENCOMIASTICK Upon the Most Learned and Judicious AUTHOR OF These Critical
Annotations.
SOme have the race of Glory vainly run:
Have Countries spoiled, and Cities vilely won:
From hence those Triumphs, and that Grandeur rise,
Which Flatt'rers have exalted to the Skies;
Whilst tears still swell the vanquished captives eyes.
Knatchbull a different Conquest has obtained,
Old Greece subdued, and Palestine regained;
Has over the Empire of the Romans run,
And viewed the Regions of the rising Sun.
From thence has ample spoils, and Trophies brought,
TO enrich the soul, and to adorn the thought.
No tears upon the unbloudy conquest wait;
His Gentler victr'y makes the conquered great.
As in a Map the world described we find,
And spacious Kingdoms to a spot confind:
So here; this little Volume does contain
The Vast Ideas of a thoughtful brain:
Like Crystal bright, and solid too, they shine
In each elab'rate page, in every Line.
Our errors they reform, our doubts dispel,
And all our weak opposing force repel.
No dry dull periods here our Fancies cloy;
Deep sense, and manly lines our wits employ.
Here no impertinence provokes our rage;
Nor empty bubbles swell the frothy page;
But weighty Truths our studious thoughts engage.
Some Books like Deserts, are of vast extent:
Much time and pains to trace them over is spent.
Now here, Now there, an useful Plant is found:
We traverse then large Tracts of moorie ground
Where only Moss and barren Fern abound.
In devious paths over rugged Hills we go,
Whose Tops are covered with eternal snow,
Scarce once saluted by a human face:
Dragons and Owls possess the baleful place.
This, like a Plat of rich enclosed Mead,
Is all with Flowrie grass, and herbs or' espread;
And yet no Serpent in the Grass lies hid.
From every part surprising scenes arise,
And charming objects feed our longing eyes.
New fresh delights so crowd upon the brain,
We Are forced from too much pleasure to refrain:
Excess of Joy's converted into pain.
Some have to men assigned a Monstrous birth,
That they first sprang like Mushroms from the earth.
Can such mean thoughts debase the Great and Wise?
Nothing from earth but earthly things arise.
The senseless clod may flesh and blood impart;
Heaven claims the glory of our nobler part.
The finest Atoms, in their nimblest dance,
To sense and reason never could advance.
This truth our Authors Matchless works proclaim,
Which nothing but immortal wit could frame;
Which will endure 'till the Universal Flame.
Happy the man whose uncorrupted Soul,
No vicious passions fetter, and control
From soaring up to its celestial seat;
Contemning what the giddy World calls Great.
Whose willing heart cleaves to the Sacred Laws
As close as Iron which the Loadstone draws.
These are his study, these his chiefest Joy,
These both his Youth, and riper years employ.
Such was our Author; such was his delight:
It Was food by day, and rest to him by night,
To search the Records of the Will divine,
A rich and yet an inexhausted Mine.
Great Man! endu'd with more than human Arts:
Such heavenly knowledge heaven alone imparts.
Now he augments the number of the Blessed.
His Labors end in everlasting rest,
And hospitable Saints caress their welcome guest.
Nor So has left this World; but that his Name
Is born aloft upon the wings of Fame.
Even for his sake these lines may chance to live;
For his to them will life, and luster give.
As Oaks the Ivy which enclasps them round,
They Will bear them up from sinking to the Ground.

ANNOTATIONS ON S. Matthew.
St Matthew Chapter 1. v. 19.

_(...). Then Joseph her husband being a just man, etc. and so accordingly read
all Interpreters. But in my opinion as we ought to speak, so ought we to
interpret, if lawfully we may, to the capacity of the vulgar. It being
therefore familiar to have recourse to the Idiotisms in the Old Testament for
the explanation of words or phrases in the New, as even to profane Authors
also, and the involved or complexed sense in this place such as is just in the
general signification, being not so explicit and plain, as that it can be
rightly understood of the common sort of people, the particular and specific
one, whose reason the meanest capacity understands at first sight, is surely
the more fit and proper, and that is, merciful. For if the Evangelist in this
place had intended Joseph as a just man, in the common acception of the word,
then ought Joseph as a just man to have made her an example, and to have
divorced her publicly according to the law, Deuteronomy. c. 24. v. 1. but he was not
willing to make her an example, but was minded to put her away privily, which
plainly argues by that intention that he was merciful rather then just. And
therefore the translation were more proper, Then Joseph her husband being a
merciful man, Misericors existens, and not willing to make her a public
example, was minded to put her away privily. And for this Translation we have
the Authority of the Old Testament, where the word (...) which properly
signifies an affection of piety and mercy, and that in the very places, wherein
we commonly render it mercy or merciful, the Greek Translaters render according
to the variation of the points, (...), or (...). As Genesis c. 19. v. 19. (...),
Et magnificasti misericordiam tuam, And thou have magnified thy mercy. c. 20.
v. 13. (...), Hanc misericordiam facies mecum, This is thy kindness which thou
shall show unto me. Exodus Chapter 15 v. 13. (...), Dux fuisti in misericordia tua
populo quem redemisti, Thou in thy mercy have led forth the people which thou
have redeemed. Isai. c. 57. v. 1. (...), Et viri misericordiae colliguntur, And
merciful men are taken away. And so in many other places. So Chrysostom (...),
i. e. Mitis and benignus. that is meek and courteous. Whom Theophylact
expresses yet more plainly, (...), etc. Noluit crudelis esse, etc. He would
not be cruel, but used her with all gentleness and mercy.

V. 24, 25. (...). And he took unto him his wife, and knew her not till she had
brought forth her first born son. That is from the time he took her home unto
him unto the time she brought forth her first born son he knew her not, to wit,
the whole intervenient time, in which she was with child. And all this the
Evangelist does purposely record, that he may take away all pretense of cavil,
and fix it for an undeniable truth, that Jesus was not only conceived of a
Virgin, but also of a pure Virgin born. Least any prying inquisitor, by
sinisterly interpreting the words of Isaiah going immediately before, might
chance to argue Thus, Isaiah truly says, a Virgin shall conceive, and bring
forth a son, but he says not, a Virgin shall bring forth a son; For he might
say, she was a Virgin when she conceived, and yet not when she brought forth.
Neither can there be any thing else ingenuously or fairly drawn from these
words.

C. 2. v. 6. (...). Nequaquam minima, In no wise the least; or, as we translate
it, art not the least. This place as to the words does diametrically fight with
that in Micah c. 5. v. 2. out of which nevertheless it was probably cited, it
being not to be found in any other Prophet. And thou Bethlehem art not the
least, as it is here in Matthew. And thou Bethlehem Ephratah art little, as it is
in Micah. Though as to the sense all Expositors agree they both mean the same
thing. But they say this place in Matt. is the more significant and plain,
supposing that he restored it to its original and proper meaning. When as in
truth the words are not the words of Matthew, being only by him historically
recited, but properly the words of the high Priest and Scribes, who answered
Herod upon his demand, where Christ should be born, In Bethlehem of Judea, for
so it is written by the Prophet. And thou Bethlehem in the Land of Juda art not
the least among the Princes of Juda, etc. And that they so answered according
to the reading of the Greek Bibles which were then among them common, I think
there is no cause to doubt. But this difference in the reading giving a just
occasion to inquire farther into the reason and mystery thereof, I hope it will
be an offense to none, at least to move the question, whether it may not be
possible that some fault might creep into this place of Micah by the neglect or
inadvertency of one of the first Transcribers, (whom afterward posterity did
follow with a well meaning and uninquiring faith) when as it is so prone and
easy to mistake in the Hebrew letters, because of the great likeness of the
Characters, as that such mistakes have been in many places is not to be denied.
And if so, why may there not have been a mistake in this word (...), Little,
which perhaps should have been rather read, (...), Go forth, an error apt
enough to be committed by reason of the similitude of the Characters of (...),
and (...). and (...) and (...). Neither is this a new thing in the sacred Page,
for the Greek Interpreters did certainly mistake in this very word, Genesis c. 49.
v. 22. reading (...) and rendering (...), adolescentior, younger, instead of
(...) incidebat, or discurrerunt, as in the English, whose branches did run
over the wall. And the like error is also as easy between (...) and (...).
And so it happens in all the four forementioned letters in one and the same
word, Ezekiel. c. 34. v. 16. Where the Greek Interpreters instead of (...), I will
destroy, read, (...), (...), I will keep. And if this mistake be granted to be
probable, as it is so possible in this place of Micah, then will the sense be
without all difficulty plain and extremely suitable to the scope thereof,
(...). Et tu Bethlehem Ephrata progredere, or according to the force of the
Hebrew, Cum pompa progredere, ut sis inter Chiliadas Judae, etc. And thou
Bethlehem Ephrata go forth or march forth with pomp that thou may be among
the thousands of Juda, for out of thee shall he come forth who shall be ruler
in Israel. And if I affirm this to be probable, what new thing do I assert,
that the most learned and judicious Capellus has not already abundantly
asserted in his Sacred Critics?

C. 2. v. 10. (...), Subaudi, (...), or (...), But seeing the Star, understand,
stand still, or where it stood. For its said in the former verse, And behold
the Star which they saw in the East, went before them, till it came and stood
over where the young child was. When therefore they saw the Star stand still,
(for they could not but before see the Star which they followed for their
guide) they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

V. 16. (...), A bimatu and infra, as the Old Latin, a bimulo and infra, as
others, From two years old and under, in our own. But read which you will,
either (...) substantively, or (...) adjectively understanding (...), it
matters not, whilst all mean the same with the English, (...). As it is said,
Acts c. 24. v. 27. A biennio expleto, From after two years, or from two years
and under. Which sense I can by no means think agreeable to this place, but
that the words are rather to be rendered and understood according to the manner
of speech with both Greeks and Latins, and the very scope and reason of the
place, in this manner, Then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise
men, was exceeding wroth, and sent fortb and slew all the male children that
were in Bethlehem and all the coast thereof, (...), that is, (...), and not
(...), a biennio, or bimatu incipiente, and not expleto, or a bimulo and infra,
From a two yearing child and under, that is, as I suppose Piscator means,
incipiendo a bimulis exclusive and descendendo ad eos qui infra bimatum erant;
as if he had said, All the male children of a year old and under, according to
the time he had diligently inquired of the wise men. For from a full whole year
and upward a child begins to be called with the Hebrews (...), filius duorum
annorum, with the Greeks (...), with the Latins, Bimus. In which sense the LXX
do I conceive rightly translate (...), secundo anno post diluvium, Genesis c. 11.
v. 10. And so reads St Augustine, de civit. Dei. lib. 5. so Noah is said to be,
(...) Sexcentorum annorum filius, a son of six hundred years (...) in
sexcentesimo anno vitae suae, in the six hundredth year of his life, Genesis c. 7.
v. 6. and 11. So thought Hesychius (...), that is, post annum integrum, after a
whole year, as if then a child began to be or to be called (...) being put for
(...), which is usually done, cum de interjecto tempore dicitur, as (...), post
annos fere quadringentos, Plut. (...), post annum unum and dimidium, Anonym.
(...), post plures annos, Act. c. 24. v. 17. And so (...), ought to be rendered
from after a whole year; so also Aristotle understood the word lib. 9. c. 5. de
hist. Animal. whose words there of the Heart or Stagg are these, (...), bimi
primum generant cornua, the two yearings first generate horns. Now there is
nothing more certain then that they begin to generate their horns as soon as
they are once a full year old, and have entered into the second, at which time
they begin to be called (...), and so continue to be called, until in the end
of that second year they begin to cast them. And to demonstrate this more
plainly, that which with us is called the Calf of a red Deer, or the Fawn of a
Fallow, the whole space of the first year, is with him called (...), as also a
Lamb in the Scripture is with the Hebrews called (...), with the Greek
Interpreters (...), with the Latins, Anniculus, with the English, A lamb of the
first year. And what with us is termed a brocket or a pricket, the whole space
of the second year of his age, is with him termed (...) or (...), in Latin
subulo or bimus, in the beginning of which year he begins to generate his
horns, and in the end thereof to cast them. (...), as he says, that is, as
soon as they enter into the third year of their age, (...), bifida generant,
they begin to have forked horns, and are called that third year of their age
with the Latins, trimi, with the English, spaydes or sorells. Where note that
(...), and (...) with him are all one and the same manner of phrase, so as he
might have as well said, (...), and (...) as well as (...). From whence it
manifestly appears, that (...) may be taken either a bimatu incipiente, or
desinente, from the time a child begins to be two years old, or from the time
they cease to be so, the praeposition (...) being exclusive to the one or to
the other, to the beginning or to the end; but because the word (...) is here
added, I conceive it ought to be taken, a bimo, or bimatu incipiente, from the
time the child begins to be two years old, or from a two yearing child and
downward, as contrariwise, 2. Chron. c. 31. v. 16. where it is said (...), it
cannot but be understood of children of three years of age complete. A nato
tres annos and deinceps, as Jun. as if it were said, (...). So also where
Aristotle says, lib. 2. c. 1. de hist. Animal. (...). Cervus solus singulis
annis abjicit cornua, incipiens [abjicere] a bimatu, and rursus gene at, The
Stagg alone casts his horns every year, beginning to cast them, from two years
old, and then again he breeds new ones; it cannot be otherwise understood,
then (...), a bimatu expleto, from two years expired, for until that time they
cast not their horns, but then immediately in the entrance of their third year,
(...), they again generate new ones, as was said before, (...). If therefore
the Evangelist had meant children of two years of age complete, he would surely
have said, (...). A trimatu and infra, from three years old and under, or from
a three yearing child and under. For certainly there must be a difference
between, A bimatu and infra, and a bimatu and supra. Neither is the Latin
manner of speech at all unlike unto the Greeks: For bimus and (...), bimatus
and (...), trimus and (...), have one and the same signification. Bimus,
commonly, qui in bimatu est. Bima dies, that is bimatus, tempus biennii, Vall.
lib. 4. c. 80. We have also in the vulgar Latin. Isai. c. 15. v. 5. Vitulam
conternantem. i. e. as Grammarians expound, quae est in complexione tertii
anni, that is in the compass of her third year, which with the LXX is called
(...), with the Arabic, vitula trima, as the Latin expounds it. So that from
both manner of speeches either Greek or Latin, we must necessarily conclude,
that not one two yearing child was slain of Herod, but only those who were one
year old complete and under, all who perished to the Babe that was newly born.
And now it remains to demonstrate, how this interpretation is more suitable to
reason, and the scope of the place. And that especially for this cause, for
that Herod slew the children, (...), secundum tempus quod exquisierat a Magis,
According to the time which he had inquired out of the wise men. And this was
the time wherein the Star appeared to them in the East, according to the
computation whereof, supposing that Christ was born about that time he slew the
children. Now I do not conceive it agreeable to reason to say, that the Star
appeared two whole years before the wisemen came to Jerusalem, which
notwithstanding some have thought, being I suppose carried away with the Vulgar
interpretation. For it is scarce credible, but that the wise men did
immediately after the appearing of the Star begin to prepare themselves for
their journey, in the expedition whereof they could not have spent two whole
years, had they come from the farthest parts of the world, much then surely
less if they came no farther then from Arabia, that is conterminous to Judaea.
And that they came from thence there are many convincing arguments. First, for
that the Text says, that they came to Jerusalem out of the East. Now that
Arabia is scited on the Eastern side of Judaea the Scripture witnesses in
diverse places, as Genesis c. 10. v. 30. c. 25. v. 6. and elsewhere. As does also
Tacitus in his description of Judaea, Terra finesque qua ad Orientem vergunt
Arabia terminantur, and Ptolomaeus Geograph. lib. 5. c. 16. (...), Palestina
Judaea Syria terminatur ab Orient and Meridie Arabia Petraea, etc. Secondly,
because there were Magi or Wise men also in Arabia, as Grotius shows by many
arguments. Thirdly, They presented gifts singularly proper to that Country,
Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh, of the abundance, pureness and excellency of
each whereof in that Country you may see the testimonies of various Authors in
Bochart. Geograph. sac. par. 1. Nay Grotius affirms, Myrrha non nisi in Arabia
nascitur, nec Thus nisi apud Sabaeos Arabum portionem. Myrrh also seems to
have its denomination from an Arabic primitive (...) mur. Fourthly, because of
the prophecies, Psalm. 72. v. 10. The Kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring
gifts, and v. 15. And there shall be given to him of the gold of Saba; and
Isai. c. 60. v. 5. and 6. The riches; or forces of the Gentiles shall come unto
thee, they shall all come from Sheba, they shall bring gold and incense, and
shall show forth the praises of the Lord. These things might be possibly spoken
typically of David or Solomon, but primarily surely they looked at Christ, in
whom they were truly fulfilled, when the wise men came to worship him.
Fifthly, and lastly, the Arabians were doubly Hebrews, descending from Joctan
the son of Heber, and from Abraham by Ketura. And for this it is probable
enough, that they were better instructed then other Nations concerning the
expectation of a Messiah, or that God had more kindness for them, because of
their Original, and therefore gave them a more quick and singular notice of the
Birth of a Savior to be born unto the world, that so they might have the
pre-eminence to worship him before any other of the Gentiles. According whereto
they are styled, Primitiae Gentium, The first fruits of the Nations. If
therefore the Wise men came from Arabia, we must fit a time wherein we may
determine the Star to have appeared in the East (for that the Star was and
appeared locally in the East, and was not only seen at a far distance as far as
Jerusalem of the Wise men who were in the East, as some do say, and that they
followed it as their guide I do most firmly believe with our most Reverend
Primate) from which and in which time the wise men may properly be said to have
been in their journey out of Arabia to Jerusalem. Now though Arabia be
conterminous to Judaea, yet some parts and regions of it are so far distant
from Jerusalem, as that reckoning the Deserts they were to pass, and the
preparations and many impediments which use to accompany such long voyages, you
may fitly and lawfully allow them for the finishing of their journey about
forty weeks, from the beginning of which time it is not at all absurd to
conjecture, (Et qui in hac re been conjiciet hunc vatem ego perhibebo optimum,
And who in this matter shall conjecture well, is to be reputed the best
Prophet.) that the Star might appear to the wise men, to wit about the time of
the salutation of the Virgin, and the Conception of the Redeemer of the world;
About which time, wherein the Son of God descended from heaven to become the
son of man in the womb of the Virgin, I say again, it is not at all absurd to
conjecture that the wise men first saw the Star in the East, and that as soon
as ever they had seen it, (...), being warned from above, that the Star
portended a King to be born unto the Jews, began forthwith to prepare
themselves for their journey to Jerusalem, in the expedition whereof when they
had spent about the aforesaid forty weeks, they arrived at that city. (...), I
say, warned from above, for I do not believe they were so skilled in Balaams
Prophecy or the aspect of the stars, that out of them they could know that that
Star did portend a King to be born unto the Jews, unless they had been warned
and instructed from above, no more then they knew that Herod had it in his mind
to slay the child, had they not been first warned by a dream. If then we add to
these forty weeks twelve days after the birth of Jesus before the day in which
the wise men came to worship him, which time its reasonable enough to guess
they might spend in inquiring out where the New born King of the Jews might be,
and after that, thirty days of the Purification of Mary according to the law,
and the Presentation of her Son in the Temple were past, about which time its
probable the wise men returned into their Country, and allowing farther for
their return from Jerusalem to their own City Nazaret when they had performed
all things according to the law of the Lord, Luke c. 2. v. 39. and from thence
back again into Egypt, Matthew. c. 2. v. 14. and 16. according to the order of
the Chronology of our most reverend Primate, before that Herod saw that he was
mocked of the wise men, and became exceeding wroth, and sent and slew the
children, six weeks more, you will have in the whole fifty and two weeks, from
the time wherein we say that the Star first appeared to the wise men in the
East, unto the time wherein Herod slew the children; so that it will not be at
all besides the scope of the text to say, That Herod slew all the male children
in and about Bethlehem, (...), which were under the second year of their age,
or from the second year of their age and under, that is, all who had completed
the first year of their age and under, according to the time he had diligently
inquired of the wise men. But perhaps it may seem more probable, that Herod did
not stay so long, as till the year was expired, because that was beyond the
time of life, according to the time which he had inquired of the wise men, but
that he rather slew them within the space of a year from the appearing of the
Star, about which time he thought the King of the Jews was born, some weeks,
that so killing all the male children of a year old, he might be the more sure
to kill him whom he so much feared. Though he knew according to the time he had
learned of the wise men, that he had not yet attained that age. If any man
shall question the distribution of the times, I would have him to know, that it
was not in our mind to adjust them so exactly, as that there should be no place
left for exception or correction, but that it sufficed me, if what I have here
proposed have in it in sum a show of truth. Or if any shall contend, as many
of the Learned do, that these wise men came from Persia, it is all one to me,
whose main design is to demonstrate, (...), that a bimatu, or a bimulo and
infra, is not rightly understood but of children who were under the second year
of their age. And that the wise men, wheresoever they were in the East, first
saw the Star about forty weeks before the Birth of our Savior, from which and
in which time they were coming to Jerusalem, that space of time fitting their
journey from some part of Arabia, as well as from some parts of Persia; though
for my part I retain the same opinion firmly with Grotius that they came from
Arabia. En vero quam absurdum errorem peperit (...) ille perperam intellectus?
But behold how absurd an error this (...) has begot being not rightly
understood? They are the words of Joseph Scaliger, lib. 6. de Emend. Temp. The
Error he understood of those who would have Jesus to be (...), that is, two
whole years old when Herod commanded the male children to be slain a Bimatu and
infra.

C. 3. v. 2. (...). Appropinquat enim regnum caelorum, For the Kingdom of
heaven is at hand. That is, the time of the Gospel, in which Christ the Messiah
was to reign. And this kingdom began immediately after the Resurrection of
Christ, when God according to his Prophet had raised up Christ in the flesh to
sit upon his throne, Act. c. 2. v. 30. Psalm. 132. v. 11. From the time he said
unto his Apostles, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, Go ye
therefore and teach all Nations, etc. Matthew. c. 28. v. 18, 19.

V. 4. (...). What (...) signifies here is no small dispute among
Interpreters. But they generally agree that St John did, vesci cibo parabili,
feed on such meat or nutriment as nature did offer of herself unto him, without
any help of art or cookery, such as was (...), the wild honey he did feed on.
And if so, (though for the most part it be translated locusts) surely the tops
of the leaves of trees or plants, which some have thought these (...) here to
signify, such as were those (...), siliquae, husks or cods wherewith the
Prodigal son desired to fill his belly, Luke c. 15. v. 16. were a much more
Parable food then that of Locusts. Neither have I read that ever any fed on
locusts raw, but they were first prepared by some art or cookery, either
boiled, or roasted, or dried in the sun, and after that beat to powder, or
dried with smoke and salt, or pickled and eaten with oil; none of which arts
or cookeries can we reasonably suppose the Baptist used in the wilderness,
where he had no fire to serve his turn, and whether he took the pains to dry
them in the sun, or to hunt for them in the fields, there being not like to be
many in the wilderness, they for the most part frequenting those places which
abound with corn, I submit to sober judgments. Whereas the (...), siliquae,
husks or cods of trees were ready at his hand without the pains of labor, art,
or cookery. And that these (...) were not locusts, but (...), the tops of
shrubs or trees, was the confident Opinion of Isidor. Pelus. lib. 1. ep. 5. and
132. Of which opinion also were Paulinus and Nicephorus, and others whom
Euthymius and Theophylactus mention, neither did it displease our most Learned
Dr Hammond, nor Baronius whose words are these, Haec cum scribat Isidorus, and
non nisi majorum authoritate, quid de his sentiendum, definiendum nobis non
est, sed totum relinquimus lectoris arbitrio, Nam constat Graecam dictionem
(...), and locustam insecti genus infirmas alas habens ad volandum, and
summitates herbarum significare. When Isodorus writes these things, and that
with the Authority of the Ancients, what is to be thought of them, is not for
us to determine, but we leave it all to the readers choice, For its apparent
that the Greek word (...) signifies both a kind of insect, that has weak wings
to fly, and the tops of herbs. Besides, that which moves me much, these (...),
which I take to be all one with these (...), and are so called because reflexed
like a horn, and interpreted by the Latins siliquae, either ex silo propter
formae similitudinem, as some would have, because silus appellatur naso sursum
versus repando, and so the tops of these leaves likewise are reversed, or from
(...) as others, because they have a wooden taste, are and have been anciently
with the Germans called, St Johans Brot, that is, St John's bread, as if it were
their constant opinion that the Baptist fed on the tops of those trees when he
abided in the wilderness. So that for these reasons, what ever is so strongly
contradicted, I cannot but think that the version with Baronius is equally as
good, if not more proper, And his meat was the tops of the leaves of trees or
shrubs and wild honey. Neither did Erasmus, when he had spoken what he could for
the maintenance of those who would have locusts here to be understood,
confidently assert it, but modestly concluded, Neque haec commemoramus, quod
omnino negem hic (...) accipi posse pro frutice, aut herbae genere, Neither do
we speak this, as if I did altogether deny that (...) might not here be taken
for some shrub or kind of plant. Now that these (...), husks or cods of the
leaves of trees or shrubs in the Countries where they grow, are frequently the
food of the poor, and are commonly sold in the streets and Markets in Italy,
Spain and Africa, and elsewhere, is abundantly testified by Authors. Among the
rest Lobelius has it in Advers. Multum haec [nempe siliqua] cognita Nicaeae
and maris Ligustici accolis, ubi eam esitant pueri etiam and porci, The siliqua
is much known to the inhabitants about Nice, and the Ligurian sea, where the
boys eat them and also the hogs. And Galen. 2. de Aliment. (...), etc. Est
autem pravi succi edulium and lignosum. Pro-inde satius est a regionibus
Orientalibus in quibus nascitur ad nos non importari, The Keratium is a food of
ill juice and woody. Wherefore it were better it were not imported to us out
of the Eastern Countries where it grows. And he was of Pergamus in the lesser
Asia, on whose side toward the East was Judaea not very far distant, from
whence its very probable they might be imported to Pergamus in the time of
Galen, at least from Syria which was conterminous to both, for they were not
worth the carriage from far.

C. 4. v. 5. (...), Supra summitatem, Upon the top of the temple. (...),
Fastigium or summitas, Hesych. so the Aethiopick Interpreter. Statuit eum in
summitate domus sanctae, He set him on the top of the holy house. Neither was
it at that time the business of the Lord to show a miracle, such as is to stand
upon the point of a pinnacle, but he was carried by the Tempter to the top of
the Temple there to be set in any part thereof, from whence he might be tempted
to cast himself down headlong. The leads or battlements being a sufficient
precipice for the Devils purpose.

V. 7. Jesus said unto him, it is written again. But to my apprehension its
better distinguished and translated thus. (...), Jesus said again unto him, it
is written. No readier way to stop the Tempters mouth, then with a scriptum est.

C. 5. v. 16. (...). This word (...) is not in the place of a conjunction
causal, as it sounds in the English translation, Let your light so shine before
men, that they may see your good works, etc. But it is an adverb of likeness,
which directly answers to the similitude which went immediately before, so that
properly it is to be rendered as it stands in the Greek, A city that is set on a
hill, cannot be hid, Neither do men light a candle and put it under a tub or
bushel, but on a candlestick, and it gives light to all that are in the room,
(...), In like manner, or even so let your light shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and glorify your father which is in heaven.

V. 19. (...), Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments.
So most interpreters, as if there were some remarkable Emphasis in the
expression, these least commandments. But I can by no means think, that Christ
did either affect or intend any extraordinary elegance of speech in these
words, but that he spoke in the common phrase and obvious sense, so as it ought
to be rendered by a familiar transposition of the words, Whosoever shall break
one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, etc. The very
same with that c. 25. v. 40. (...). Which we translate, Unto one of the least
of these my brethren.

V. 42. (...), And from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away. And
so accordingly is it in most Translations. But how in construction the words
can possibly be rendered so, I do not see. And therefore suppose they should be
rather translated thus. Put, or turn him not away that desires to borrow of
thee. For (...), though it be the passive voice, yet may it have, as many other
passives have in the New Testament, an Active signification, and so we find it
has, Psalm. 132. v. 10. Where Symmachus reads, (...). Turn not away the face of
thine anointed, as our English according to the Hebrew read it.

C. 6. v. 2. (...), They have their reward. Yet in the foregoing verse it is
said, if ye do your alms to be seen before men, (...), Ye have no reward, or
rather the present being put for the future, Ye shall have no reward from your
father which is in heaven. Why then should it be said in the immediately
following words, that hypocrites who do the same thing with the same purpose to
be seen of men, have their reward? Is not this a contradiction? Surely its more
agreeable to the context and to reason, that if any do their alms in the
streets or Synagogues, that they may have the glory of men, such persons should
be said rather not to have, that is to loose, then to have their reward. To
reconcile therefore these words in either verse to one and the same sense, I
would translate these latter words quite different from the former. Verily I
say unto you, (...), They forbid or hinder their reward. By seeking the praise
of men, they forbid their reward from God, from whom its no reason they should
expect any, when they did their alms before men to be seen of them, v. 1. I am
not ignorant, that the first and common sense is endeavored to be salved with
a proper (as some think) distinction. That is, They have a worldly and
perishing reward, but not an heavenly and during one. But what need is there of
so faint a sense, or forced distinction, if the sense be plain without it, and
the use of words do lawfully bear it? But certainly the use of words will bear
it, for with all Lexicographers, (...), (...), and (...), signify one and the
same thing, that is, to forbid or hinder. And in this sense by the leave of the
Learned Beza and Grotius, would Plutarch, who I suppose never dreamed of the
distinction of a worldly and heavenly reward, have the same word understood in
his Solon, where relating something which seemed hard by the sanction of the
laws, to wit, that those who were born of harlots were not bound by the law to
nourish or relieve their Parents, as they were who were legitimately born. He
gives the reason in the words following, (...). Which words that they may
mutually agree, must necessarily be translated thus, For he that despises the
honor of marriage, does plainly show, he used not a woman for childrens sake,
but for his lust, and forbids his reward, and has not left himself the liberty
to speak to those he has begot, whose very being he has made their shame. In
that he has not left himself the liberty to speak to those he has begot, he
forbids or hinders his reward, to wit, of alimony, the very thing in question,
which it was free for the Parents to have required of all their children that
were honestly born. I find the same word likewise in the same Author, in his
book of the failing of Oracles, (...), Nothing hinders the spirit of
divination, etc. As also in Dion. Halic. (...), No fear shall hinder me from
speaking what I think. Since therefore there is so good authority for the use
of the word in this sense, and that it agrees so well with the context, and
needs no strained distinction for its explanation, I see no reason, why it
should not be so accordingly translated, Verily I say unto you, they hinder
their reward. For surely it is a vanity to fly to a mystical sense, where we
have a litteral. And thus I suppose it is necessary to determine in all the
Parallel places where the word is used.

C. 9. v. 5, 6. The common pointing and inconvenient division of the verses
together with the parenthesis do so involve the sense, that it was not without
cause that Erasmus said orationem esse duriusculam, That it was a harsh kind of
speech. For remedy whereof, it is but pointing and distinguishing thus, v. 5.
(...); v. 6. (...), For which is easier, to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or
to say, arise and walk, but that ye may know that the Son of man has power on
earth to forgive sins? Then says he to the sick of the Palsy, arise, take up
thy bed, and walk. The sense being plainly this, as if he should have said in a
few more words, Jesus knowing their thoughts, that they said within themselves,
that he blasphemed because he said to the sick of the Palsy, thy sins are
forgiven thee, says unto them, it is all one to me to say, thy sins are
forgiven thee, or take up thy bed and walk, but only that you may know that
the Son of man has power to forgive sins upon earth, therefore I said unto the
sick of the Palsy, thy sins are forgiven thee. And then fitly follows, Then
says he to the sick of the Palsy, etc.

V. 18. (...), Filia mea modo defuncta est, Vet. and Beza, My daughter is even
now dead, in our Own: but I conceive the Translation were more proper, My
daughter is even or almost dead. For (...) signifies (...), nigh, or (...),
that which is presently to come, as well as (...), that which is present, as
Phavorinus tells us. So in the parallel places, Mar. c. 5. v. 23. (...),
Extreme habet, or as the Aethiop. and Arab. morti vic^a est, or as our English,
lies at the point of death, and Luke c. 8. v. 42. (...), and ea moriebatur, as
the Interlineary and Old Translation has it, that is (...), erat moribunda, as
the Syriack and Aethiopick have it, or as we interpret it, and she lay a dying.
And that she was not altogether dead when the Ruler spoke unto Jesus is
abundantly manifest by all three stories.

V. 23. (...), Tibicines, the Minstrells or Players on the Flute or Pipe. That
Flutes or Pipes were used in Funerals among the Heathen, we have the testimony
of Ovid. Cantabat maestis tibia funeribus.
In funerals the Flute is sung.
and Artemidorus, (...). To sound with Pythian Flutes betokens mourning. Which
custom to be in use among the Jews Jeremy does seem to intimate, in his
Lamentation for the destruction of Moab, c. 48. v. 36. (...), My heart shall
sound like Pipes for the men of Kirheris, that is with a mourning sound such as
the Minstrels make in Funerals. Such you may suppose to be (...), the mourners
that go about the streets, Eccles. c. 12. v. 5. and (...), the mourning Women,
Jerem. c. 9. v. 17. So Joseph. (...) the Jews are said upon the report of his
death (...), to have hired Minstrels who began their lamentations to them. As
the mourning Women in the forementioned place of Jeremy, were to be called to
take up a wailing for them. But that which concerns this place most, is that of
Servius upon Virgil, Majoris aetatis funera ad tubam proferebantur, minoris ad
tibiam, The Funerals of the Elder sort were ushered with the Trumpet, those of
the Younger with the Flute, or that of Statius, Tibia cui teneros suetum
producere manes
Pelopen monstrasse ferebant
Exequiale sacrum carmenque minoribus umbris Utile.
The Flute to usher wont the tender Ghosts
They say that Pelops taught
This mystery and charm for lesser souls.
For this Daughter of the Ruler, on whose Funerals the Minstrels were now ready
to wait, is called in this place of Matthew. (...), a little maid. Mar. c. 5. v.
23. (...), his little daughter. and Luke c. 8. v. 42. (...), About Twelve years
of age.

C. 10. v. 11. (...), Enquire who in it is worthy, and there abide. That is,
worthy with whom ye should abide, siletur (...), that which is intended, is
suppressed, and understood by the words subsequent or preceding. So Matthew. 22.8.
(...), They which were bidden were not worthy, that is, of the Wedding Feast
which was prepared. For they would not come, but went their way one to his Farm
another to his Trade. So Apocal. 3.4. They shall walk with me in white Robes,
(...). Because they are worthy so to do for that they have not defiled their
Garments, and 16.6. Thou have given them Blood to drink, (...). For they are
worthy to drink Blood, because they have shed the Blood of the Saints, etc.

C. 11. v. 19. (...), Et justificata est sapientia a filiis suis, But wisdom is
justified of her children. The proper meaning whereof, or at least a good one,
having relation to the Context is very difficult to unfold. Why therefore may
it not be better Translated thus? And This wisdom is justified of her children,
to wit of the Scribes and Pharisees who thought themselves the only Children or
Sons of Wisdom, who sat in the chair of Moses, and loved to be called Rabbi,
these were they that justified this Wisdom, that would not attend unto the
voice of those that exhorted them to repentance, who said that John had a
Devil, and that Jesus was a friend of Publicans and sinners. (...) is
frequently put for (...), so Hesychius (...), as is, (...), for, (...), (...)
or (...). Examples whereof you may see, c. 15. v. 12. (...), audito isto
sermon, when they heard this saying. c. 19. v. 22. the same. Gal. c. 5. v. 8.
(...), ista persuasio, this persuasion comes not from him that calls you,
and so elsewhere.

C. 12. v. 18. (...), etc. And he shall preach judgment unto the Gentiles. The
words following, (...) etc. he shall not strive, etc. unto (...), till he bring
forth his judgment in victory, being to be included in a Parenthesis, so that
the sense and cohaerence must be this, He shall preach judgment unto the
Gentiles, till he bring forth his judgment in victory, or for ever, as that
phrase does frequently signify with the LXX. (...), By judgment he seems to
mean his law, (...), the administration of his Church, that is, his Gospel, so
Procopius upon Isaiah. The sum whereof is this, that Christ shall cause his
Gospel to be preached to the Gentiles, till he exalt it in triumph over
Heathenisme; or for ever, that is so that it shall endure for ever, all Nations
being converted to the same. The intervenient words, (...), etc. He shall not
strive, etc. showing only his great meekness and tenderness in doing of it.

V. 20. (...), Smoking Flax he shall not quench. But Flax is here put by a
Metonymy for a Lamp which is made of Flax. (...) some interpret extinctioni
vicinum, near to going out, others, caligans, as we say in English, twinkling,
and others moribundum, dying, which all express the same meaning. So that to
speak to the capacity of the vulgar, it ought to be Translated thus, He will
not extinguish or put out the dying Lamp. Will thou break a leaf driven to and
fro? and will thou pursue the dry stubble? Job c. 13. v. 25.

V. 43. (...), Through dry places, that is, through desert places, and so reads
the Aethiopick Interpreter, per desertum through the desert. So the word (...)
which properly signifies solitudo, a desert, the Greek Interpreters for the
most part render (...), though sometimes (...), as Psalm. 106. v. 14. (...), And
they tempted God in the desert, and Isai. c. 43. v. 19. (...), I will make a
way in the wilderness, and Rivers (...) in the desert. Our Savior seems to
speak this Parable, as many times he does, to the sense and opinion of the
Vulgar, which probably was the same, that Psellus makes mention of in his book
of Devils, (...), Quod versentur in locis maxim caecis, quae extreme frigida
sunt and sicca, That they abide in the most blind places which are extremely
cold and dry: who also says, that there is a certain kind of Devils cold and
dry, which are called (...) lucisugi, haters of the light. Where by the way we
must observe that (...) and (...) are synonymous. The Devils also with the
Syriacks are called (...), from (...) vastavit, because they abide in wast and
desert places, as Schindler observes. And that this opinion was not vain, we
may gather from that place of Matthew, where our Savior is said to be led into
the wilderness or desert to be tempted of the Devil.

C. 13. v. 44. (...), Occuluit, Vet. Abscondit, Beza. Our English, he hides.
But surely it is more significant to say, The which when a man had found he
concealed it. For (...) does signify, celo, as well as, abscondo, to conceal,
as well as, to hide. And to be ingenuous the sense requires it. For the
Treasure was already hid, which being found the man concealed it, least it
should be known to others. And it had been a vain thing to have hid a new, that
which was hid before, and therefore he concealed it.

C. 16. v. 28. Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall
not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his Kingdom. This
place can scarce mystically be understood, by no means literally, but of the
coming of the Son of man to the Destruction of Jerusalem, who then may truly be
said to come in his Kingdom, when he came to Triumph over his enemies the Jews,
by taking a severe and just vengeance of them. Of his Resurrection, which also
is called his Kingdom, it reasonably cannot. For what wonder were it, if some
of the standers by should live to see him coming in his Resurrection, which
came to pass in so short a time? But if any of them should live to see the
Destruction of Jerusalem, which happened so many years after his Passion, that
might deserve the notice. And that some of the standers by when our Savior
spoke those words, did remain alive to that very day is true and known And in
this sense it is true, Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass,
till all these things be fulfilled, c. 24. v. 34. Neither before this time of
his coming did the Disciples go over all the Cities of Israel, c. 10. v. 23.
And in this sense did John among others remain alive till Christ came, whereof
see more, Joh. c. 21. v. 22.

C. 17. v. 11. (...), Et consummabit omnia, And shall finish all things. The
words are literally spoken of Elias, but by our Savior interpreted to be meant
of John the Baptist. And this version seems to me more agreeable, then that
which is commonly received, Elias truly shall first come and restore all
things. My reason is, because in John the Law and the Prophets had their end.
For the Law and the Prophets were until John, from that time the Kingdom of God
is preached, Luke c. 16. v. 6. and Matthew. c. 11. v. 12, 13. so that he may more
properly be said to finish all things then to restore. And therefore it is said
in the last forementioned chapter, v. 11. Among them that are born of women
there has not Risen a greater [Prophet] then John Baptist, notwithstanding he
that is least in the Kingdom of heaven, is greater then he. That is, the least
Apostle or Disciple under the Gospel, is greater, [for he knew more of the
counsel of God and the mystery of Godliness] then the greatest Rabbi or Prophet
under the Law. And surely in this sense it is more fit (which is something to
the confirming of our Opinion in this place) to translate the same word, Act.
c. 3. v. 21. (...), Quem oportet quidem coelum recipere usque ad tempora
consummationis omnium, Whom the heavens must contain until the times of the
consummation of all things, that is, to the end of the world, when he shall
come to judge the quick and the dead, (...), consummatio, Hesych. and Phavor.
and in both I conceive misprinted, (...), for (...), To finish, perfect, or
consummate.

C. 19. v. 28. This verse may be pointed thus, (...), etc. And Jesus said unto
them, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration
when the Son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory, even ye shall sit
upon Twelve Thrones judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel. (...), in Renascentia,
that is, in Resurrectione, in the Resurrection. So Munster, Haec Secunda
generatio est Resurrectio mortuorum. So Augustine, Regenerationem quippe hoc
loco, ambigente nullo, novissimam Resurrectionem vocat. Neither should our Lord
himself been styled (...), The first born from the dead, unless the
Resurrection had been accounted a (...), a kind of new Nativity. As Philo
Judaeus, when the world was as it were born again after the flood, calls it
(...).

C. 22. v. 32. God is not the God of the dead but of the living. Our Savior
speaks not this as to the present State of Souls, but he brings it as an
argument of the Resurrection of the dead, which is so certain and to God
already present, as in the parallel place of Luke c. 20. v. 38. For all live
unto him, that he is in present called the God of the living, meaning those
that are dead, that is of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who in the last day and not
till then shall rise in glory. So as the words plainly and strongly intimate,
that there is but one only proper Resurrection of the Soul and Body, against
those who would have the Fathers of the Old Testament to have risen and
ascended with Christ.

C. 24. v. 22. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
be saved, but for the Elects sake those days shall be shortened. (...), Non
servaretur ulla caro. The most received exposition of this place is this. The
mutual slaughters in Jerusalem (of which Christ did now forespeak) were so many
and so cruel, that unless the siege of the City had been extremely hastened,
there had not been one Person therein left alive, but they had all killed one
another, and utterly destroyed themselves. In consideration whereof God having
his chosen ones in the City, whom he was willing to save out of the common
calamity, or judgment, put it into the hearts of Titus and Vespatian to hasten
the siege by all means possible, and so to shorten the days of Jerusalems
destruction. But there may be another sense likewise given of the place, not a
whit less probable or proper, taking the word (...) in holy Scripture phrase,
And except those days had been shortened, that is, the days of Jerusalems
destruction, no flesh, that is not one Jew had been saved, but they had all
eternally perished. For as long as their Temple stood, and the Jewish
Sacrifices and Ceremonies remained, it was such a stumbling block to the whole
Nation, that almost all did stumble at it, neither were they few who for that
very cause and scruple became Apostates from the Christian faith, which they
had once embraced, supposing the Old Religion to be the truer, because God
permitted their Temple and Sacrifices to continue, of the certain and short
destruction and abolishment whereof they had been taught in the Christian
faith. For which cause also, as well as for their Persecutions sake, the Author
of the Epistle to the Hebrews seems to exhort them, c. 10. v. 25. that they
would not forsake their Assemblies, as the manner of some was, but that they
would exhort one another [to stand steadfast in the faith] and that so much the
more, because they saw the day approaching, that is, the day of decurtation,
the day of the destruction of Jerusalem, and desolation of the Temple drawing
nigh; for so that day here and elsewhere, as also the coming of the Lord, and
the end of all things do all relate unto the Destruction of Jerusalem. Because
therefore God had his Elect among them, whom he would have saved, that this
stumbling stone might be taken away, it pleased him to hasten the day of his
coming, and to cut short the time of the Destruction and desolation of
Jerusalem.

V. 28. Wheresoever the Carcass is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.
You have the same Proverbial speech, Job c. 39. v. 30. Where the slain are
there is she, meaning the Eagle. And here I cannot but take notice of the
happiness of his exposition, who gives this meaning of the place. The Carcass
is the Jews who lay dead in their sins, and by the Eagles are meant the Roman
Armies, who for every Legion bore two Eagles for their Ensign, so that the word
Eagles became often used by Poets and Historians for the Roman Armies, Nath.
Ward. And in my opinion this seems to agree much more with the scope of the
place, then that of others who liken our Savior to a dead carcass, on which
Christians like ravenons Eagles should make their prey. For to speak plainly.
Quid hoc ad Rhombum? What is this to the purpose? But as it is easy to add to
what already is invented, we may perhaps with better reason suppose that by
this Carcass may be meant the Jewish State and Government, which now by reason
of the many distructions among themselves, and their oppression under the Roman
power, lay plainly dead as is a Carcass. And so as Eagles and Birds of prey do
usually out of a supernatural sagacity follow Armies in expectation of the prey
of the dead bodies after the fight, so should the Roman Armies prefigured in
those Eagles, whose pourtractures they carried in their Banners, be gathered
together in that place, where the Jewish State lay now as dead and helpless as
is a Carcass, in hope and expectation of the spoil. And so our Savior, Luke c.
17. v. 37. the Disciples asking where? expressly answers, Where the body is,
thither will the Eagles be gathered together. Particularly denoting the place
where those things of which he spoke before should happen, to wit, the
desolation and sudden destruction of the Jews, which could be no where else but
in Jerusalem.

C. 26. v. 12. (...). Ad sepeliendum me, She did it for my burial. More
properly, ad funerandum, she did it for my funeral. So Mark c. 14. v. 8. (...),
Antevertit tempus ungendi corpus mecum ad funus, it should be also rendered, She
is come aforehand to Anoint my body to its funeral, and not unto its burying.
For in the Glossary, (...), is funero, and (...) does properly signify the
Rites of funerals, and (...) burial. For in the Rites of funeration they did
use to anoint the dead body with Aromatic Spices and Ointments, before they
buried them. And so was it the Jewish custom to perform their funerals, Joh. c.
19. v. 40.

C. 27. v. 3. (...). This word is used here in the Hebrews Hiphil, for (...),
redire fecit, he caused to return, and so in our English dialect might be
properly and Significantly Translated, He returned the Thirty pieces of Silver
to the High Priests. In which sense the same word is used before, c. 26. v. 52.
(...), Return thy Sword into its place.

V. 9, 10. (...). As to the name of Jeremy I suppose it is a mistake, or slip
of oversight or memory. As to the words in General, which as they are commonly
Translated, do by no means agree with one another, methinks as now
distinguished in the Greek do most perfectly answer each to other. For our
Evangelist does not entirely or precisely cite either Greek or Hebrew, but
renders only the sense which perfectly agrees with that of Zachary c. 11. v.
13. The words being expounded according as here the points are varied, without
disturbing the construction (as it is in all Translations now disturbed) or
common reading, and that word for word neither rendering more or less then is in
the Greek. Et accepi Triginta argenteos (pretium aestimati quem aestimarunt) a
filiis Israel, qui vel and illi dederunt eos pro agro figuli, quemadmodum
praecepit mihi dominus, And I took [in the first Person and Singular Number]
the Thirty pieces of Silver, (the price of him that was prized) of the children
of Israel, who, or and they gave them for the potters field, as the Lord
commanded me. That is, [to make the construction agree] I took, and not as
formerly they took the Thirty pieces of Silver of the children of Israel as the
Lord commanded me, and they gave them for the potters field. The words in the
Parenthesis being only appositive to the words going immediately before. And
thus the construction is salved, the incoherence avoided, and the sense
cleared. Those words, As the Lord commanded me, rightly answering to (...), in
the first Person of the Singular Number, as the Prophet Zachary also reads, c.
11. v. 13. And the Lord said unto me, etc. (...), And I took the Thirty pieces
of Silver and cast them [as it is here in Matthew. said immediately before, that
Judas cast them down in the Temple] (...), in domo domini pro conflatorio, into
the house of the Lord for the Potters Forge, by the same License that
Interpreters Translate (...) by, in this very place, (...), pro agro figuli,
for the Potters field, that is, that the Children of Israel, to wit, the Chief
Priests might give them for the Potters field, as it is expressly said, they
did, v. 7. That the word (...) is and may be thus used and interpreted is
abundantly common, though rarely observed. You may take these few examples in
this place instead of many, Luke c. 15. v. 15. (...), that is, (...), as the
English render it, And he went and joined himself to a Citizen of that Country
and he sent him into his fields, though Beza Translate it, Qui misit eum, Who
sent him. Ruth c. 1. v. 11. (...); Nunquid ultra mihi filii in ventre meo, qui
erunt vobis in viros? Are there yet any more Sons in my womb that, or who may
be your husbands? or and shall they be your husbands? In which place it seems
to be an Hebraism, for the Hebrew reads, (...). And you may find the like, 2
Kings c. 23. v. 29. (...). Et abiit Rex Josiah in occursum ejus qui, or and
ille occidit eum in Megiddo, And King Josiah went against him, who, or and he
slew him in Megiddo, that is Pharaoh Necho slew him. You may see the same
phrase in later writers, (...), Statim enim in proaemio dicis, O viri Latini,
quod est inassuetum, For thou say immediately in thy proem, O men of Rome,
which is unusual, or not familiar, Sgurop. You have it also in Plutarch in his
Timoleon, (...), Monstrarunt eas militibus, qui vel and illi ad precandum deos
conversi sunt, They showed them the soldiers, who, or and they turned to
supplicate their Gods. See likewise, Mark c. 1. v. 9. and 10. Acts c. 6. v. 6.
John c. 15. v. 6.

ANNOTATIONS ON S. Mark.
Chapter 3. v. 19, 20, 21.

(...). By the most received Translations Jesus is said to be besides himself.
An Interpretation (if it be lawful so to speak) unbeseeming the sacredness of
his Person, especially when a more probable one may be given. Thus, Et veniunt
in domum, and convenit iterum turba, adeo ut ne panem quidem edere possent, and
audientes quidam ab eo exiverunt, ut eam sisterent, dicebant enim quod
insaniret, And they went into an house, and the multitude comes together
again, so that they could not so much as eat bread, and some hearing of it went
out from him, to stay it, for they said, it was mad. To wit, the multitude was
mad, which for the vehement desire they had to come near to Jesus, did so
violently press upon them, that they could not eat their Bread. For (...) is
not a relative to (...), as generally it is made, but to (...), and (...) does
frequently signify, cohibere, or sistere, to restrain or to stay. (...) may be
by a common trajection either (...), some hearing of it, or (...), and some
from him when they heard it, that is, that the multitude was so mad to press
unto him, went out to stay them, as (...) with the Grammarians are nuncii tui,
or abs te missi, Your Messengers or some sent for you. Besides, Jesus was
within the house, so that it cannot be fitly said, that they who heard it went
out of the house to hold Him that was within the house. And to say that his
Kindred went out of their dwelings to hold him, is neither proper nor probable,
for how could the fame of the peoples thronging him, or the news of his being
besides himself, come so suddenly to them, that they could so soon meet
together? And if this perchance might possibly have been, (...), advenerunt,
they came, had been much more proper then (...), exiverunt they went out, which
is the Genuine signification of the word, notwithstanding the learned Beza
endeavors to maintain the other by examples that truly move not my faith at
all, it being more credible with me, that the Evangelist spoke in the common
dialect rather then in an unwonted phrase, especially when the sense agrees
with the context. And I cannot but extremely wonder, why Learned men do so much
labor to explode this interpretation (when the common one is so deservedly
misliked) which agrees with the sense, construction, custom of speech, and what
is more then all, with the Parallel places in Matthew. c. 12. v. 23. and Luke c.
11. v. 14. so perfectly as nothing can do more. For in Matthew. it is expressly
said in the very word, sense, place and time as all agree, (...), obstupuit
tota turba, that is, as Beza interprets it, for admiration were besides
themselves; or as we render it, were amazed. In this place, (...), the
multitude was beside it self, or mad. In Luke, (...), Mirata est turba, And the
people wondered. When therefore the sense agrees punctually in all Three
Evangelists with all the circumstances relating to the story, as you may there
compare, what man can reasonably doubt but one and the same word ought to be
understood and to relate in Mark as it does in Matthew, there being only this
difference, Matthew has (...) in the Passive voice in the Plural, and Mark
(...) in the Singular Number in the Active voice. Both whom Luke interprets in
a word Synonymous. For in Hesych. and Phavor. you shall find (...). So as the
one place must in all reason be an Expositor to the other, which mention all
the same time, place and thing.

V. 29, 30. (...). (...), the present for the future, as in Matthew. c. 26. v.
18. (...) or (...), I will keep the Passover at thy house, (...), is surely
more, then, in danger, as it is expressed in the English, for its possible to
escape from danger, but he shall never have forgiveness, neither in this world
nor in that to come, Matthew. 12. v. 32. It were better therefore rendered guilty
of, or subject to eternal damnation, (...), Hesych. The sense of the whole is
this, Because they said he had an unclean spirit, therefore our Savior tells
them, that whosoever sins against the holy Ghost, shall never have
forgiveness but is guilty of eternal damnation, that is, bound to suffer
eternal judgment. For their sin was therefore unpardonable, because they said
it of set malice, who when they could not but acknowledge that the miracles he
wrought were done by the operation of the power of the divine spirit, did
notwithstanding against the very dictates of the holy Spirit to their
conscience say, he did them by the Devil, and by the Prince of the Devils,
merely out of spite, to the end they might turn away the people from following
of him. (...), Obligatus, (...), Obligatio, Gloss. Vet.

C. 4. v. 29. (...), Cum autem se tradat fructus, But when the fruit offers or
shows it self, that is, ready to be reaped. For it is not properly called
fructus, fruit, dum fruendo sit paratus, till it be ready to be reaped and
gathered into the barn, as Varro and Donatus observe: Then does a man
immediately put in his sickle, for the harvest is come. (...), Phavor. (...),
Fruit, comes of (...), which signifies to dry, which being ripe is so dry as
that it will grow no more with any wet. So that properly the corn, is not
called fruit, till it be so ripe, that it will grow no more, and then it is time
for the Husbandman to put in his Sickle.

C. 7. v. 9. (...), Ye fairly reject the commandment of God. It is spoken,
(...), abusively, by way of Irony. Or it may be read with an interrogation,
(...); And he said unto them, Do ye well to reject the commandment of God, that
ye may keep your own tradition?

C. 9. v. 12. (...), Elias quidem veniens primo consummat omnia, etiam, quomodo
scriptum est de filio hominis, ut multa patiatur and pro nihilo habeatur, Elias
verily coming first finisheth all things, even, as it is written of the son of
man, that he may suffer many things and be set at naught. Concerning (...), see
Matthew. c. 17. v. 11.

V. 22, 23, 24. (...). Interpreters in this place for the most part pass by the
article (...), in which methinks there is an Emphasis by no means to be
pretermitted. That therefore the Emphasis may not be lost, neither the Syntax
violated, I would have the words distinguished as above and Translated thus,
(...), etc. Sed si quid potes, succurre nobis miserescens nostri, Jesus vero
dixit ei, (...); si potes? creed tu, omnia credenti possibilia, But if thou
can do any thing, have compassion on us and help us. But Jesus said unto him,
If thou can? do thou believe, all things are possible to him that believes.
(...) is here taken materialiter or (...), and supposes the matter whereof it
was spoken, and that was a question of the power of Christ. For the Father
having before brought his son to his Disciples who could not heal him, (...),
because of their unbelief, as our Savior tells them Matthew. c. 17. v. 14.
doubted probably whether Christ himself could do it, and therefore put the
question to him, (...), if thou can do any thing, for thy Disciples cannot,
have compassion on us. Whereto our Savior replies shortly by way of
objurgation or exprobration, as it were upbraiding his incredulity with
indignation: as if he should say, What do thou doubt whether I can or no?
do thou say, if thou can? believe thou, and despair not of my power, for
all things are possible to be done for him that believes. They are the words
of our Savior to the Centurion, As thou have believed, so be it done unto
thee, Matthew. 8.13. see the like c. 9. v. 22, and 29. and elsewhere. And that
this is so; the following words do strongly argue. For immediately the Father
of the child being struck with the Reprehension, cried out and said with tears,
Lord I believe, help my unbelief. It was the only time that ever question was
made to Christ of his power by any who came to be healed of him, whose common
address was, (...), Lord if thou will thou can make me clean, Matthew. c. 8. v.
2. or as it is v. 8. Speak the word only, and my Servant shall be healed. No
question of his power, but they implored his will, and therefore no marvail at
all, if Christ upbraided here the Father of the child for his incredulity.
(...) according to the accent, may be either the first Aorist of the Imperative
mood of the middle voice, or the Infinitive of the Active, understanding (...)
or (...), as is often frequent.

C. 11. v. 13. (...), Nondum enim erat tempus ficuum, For the time of Figs was
not yet. If ever that famous Person said any thing to the purpose, certainly
his emendation here is very opportune, by changing of the accents, the aspirate
into a dence (for the accent is not of the Author) and reading, (...), and
understanding (...), which is so very frequent, Ubi enim erat, erat tempus
Ficuum, For where he was, was the time of Figs. And so this History does
perfectly square, if applied to the Jews, of whom it was reasonable for God to
expect some fruit, if from any place in the world, for there, was even an
inexcusable time for Fruit. But it had been very hard for Our Savior to have
cursed the innocent Tree, if in that place at that time had not been the time of
Figs. Surely neither time nor place was wanting to the Jews. Neither can I find
in any Author Sacred or Profane, that (...) ever signified a fruitful year, as
some would have it, so as it might be lawfully Translated, Non fuit tempus
ferax Ficuum, It was not a fruitful time of Figs, or according to our English
phrase, It was not a Fig year. And yet suppose this to be granted, it had not
been less hard to have cursed the Tree, when it was not a seasonable year, than
if it had not yet been the time of Figs.

C. 12. v. 40. (...). Beza says, there is a Solaecism in these words, and that
to make construction between these and the former words, it ought to have been
in the Genitive case, (...). But surely there is no such cause or necessity.
For it is an ordinary Elleipsis, frequent almost in every Page, to understand
the verb (...). Thus (...) etc. (...), Beware of the Scribes which love to go
in long clothing, who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long
prayers. You may find the like Luke c. 6. v. 13. (...), where you must likewise
understand (...). And of them he chose Twelve. And Act. c. 24. v. 5. (...),
where (...) is to be understood, For we have found this man. You shall have it
likewise in the Hebrew, Psalm. 4. v. 6. (...), (...), multi dicunt, many say,
multi dicentes. Pagnin.

C. 14. v. 3. (...), And having shook the cruise together, she poured it on his
head. The common version is by no means proper, And having broke the box, etc.
For if she had broke the vessel whatever it was, how could she have poured it
on his head, but most if not all of it had been spilt? Neither is it said in
Matthew. that she brake it. Concussit therefore, or conquassavit, She took or
jogged it together, either that the oil or ointment might give the more
pleasing and fragrant smell, or that she might be the surer to pour out all,
and let nothing stick to the bottom. For in the old Glossary, (...) is
concutio, and in Phavor. (...), (...), conquassat, that is, shakes together.
(...) is (...), A vessel which has no ears or handle whereby to take hold of
it. Such as are at this day our Jars of Oil: from a privative and (...), To
take hold of: or (...), Vas olearium, or Ampulla unguentaria, such as we
commonly call a cruise.

ANNOTATIONS ON S. Luke.
Chapter 1. v. 54, 55.

THESE two verses as they are Translated in the English, may pass for good
construction, but then, to express the proper meaning of the place, these
words, [as he spoke to our Fathers] must be included in a Parenthesis alone,
the words following [to Abraham and his seed for ever] relating necessarily to
[by remembering his mercy.] Thus, He has helped his servant Israel by
remembering his mercy (as he spoke to our Fathers) to Abraham and to his seed
for ever. That is, by remembering his mercy to Abraham, and to his seed for
ever, as he spoke to our Fathers. And not as he spoke to our Fathers, to
Abraham and to his seed for ever. As if [to Abraham] were oppositive to
[Fathers] as the Parenthesis implies in the Greek Edition, and the Translation
in the Latin. Which though it seem a very nicety, yet is it such a Solaecism in
all Translations especially in the Latin, that I cannot but wonder at the
inadvertency of former times, I may say stupidity, that could possibly couple
(...) and (...) the Accusative and the Ablative together, as if (...) were
oppositive to (...), having little to salve the irregularity of the
construction, but by saying, that Luke varied his form of speech, that is in
plain terms, he writ incongruously, when in truth he is acknowledged by all
Expositors too knowing in the Greek to commit such a Solaecism. Infallibly
therefore the words must be pointed thus. (...), Et sublevavit filium suum
Israel, reminiscendo misericordiam (ut locutus est ad patres nostros) Abrahamo
and semini ejus in aeternum. The very words for more abundant confirmation are
almost verbatim taken out of the last chapter of Micah the last verse. (...),
Dabis veritatem Jacob, misericordiam Abraham, quae jurasti patribus nostris a
diebus antiquis, Thou will perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham
which thou have sworn unto our Fathers from the days of old. The very thing is
now fulfilled by remembering his mercy to Abraham and to his seed for ever,
which was before foretold, to wit, the calling of the Gentiles, Psalm. 98. v. 3.
(...), etc. Recordatus est misericordiae suae Jacobo, etc. He has remembered
his mercy to Jacob, and his truth toward the house of Israel, all the ends of
the earth have seen the Salvation of our God. (...), in Micah, no question was
(...), a fault of the Transcriber, for (...) which agrees with the Hebrew, and
the verb (...), Jurasti, in the second person, which immediately follows.

C. 2. v. 34, 35. (...), Behold this child is set for the fall and rising again
of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against (yea a sword
shall pierce through thy soul) that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed. And to this reading are conformable all Interpreters. But there is no
perfect agreement among them in the meaning of the Parenthesis. Some interpret
it of a Sword of sorrow that should pierce the Mothers heart, when she saw the
bitter passion of her Son; others of a Sword of diffidence, that struck her
through the heart, that is, she was overwhelmed with a distrust, that her Son
should be the Son of God, when she saw him die, until she was by his
Resurrection afterward restored and confirmed in her faith. Others of a Sword
of calumny and reproach, which the unbelieving Jews did cast upon her Son, that
did pierce her soul. And for the propriety of the Metaphor they have each
Interpreter his precedent to his peculiar sense. But take which of the senses
you please, they are not easily without some straining applicable to the scope
of the place, and therefore the words seem to be abruptly interposed, being as
it were severed with a Parenthesis from the context. And this has made me with
submission to conceive, there may be another reading and interpretation, which
will better reconcile the sense, without any Parenthesis at all, in manner,
thus, Ecce positus est hic in casum and resurrectionem multorum in Israel, and
in signum cui contradicetur, and tui ipsius gladius pertransibit animam, ut
revelentur multorum cordium cogitationes. Behold this child is set for the fall
and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken
against, and even thy Sword shall pierce their soul, that the thoughts of many
may be revealed. As if it were read by a familiar trajection. (...). And to
speak ingenuously the Translation and the Syntax is as lawful and as regular
as the other, if not more proper. Whether the sense be fitter, I shall leave to
indifferent judgments. It plainly and clearly runs thus, And that the
thoughts of the hearts of many may be discovered, even thy Sword shall pierce
their soul. That is, the word of God that shall proceed out of thy mouth, which
shall be more penetrating then the sharpest Sword, shall pierce through the
souls of many, so that it shall reveal the inmost secrets of their hearts. So
Heb. c. 4. v. 12. (...), etc. Sermo dei vivus and efficax, and acutior gladio
qui binas habet acies, etc. For the word of God is quick and powerful, and
sharper then a two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul
and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and
intentions of the heart. So, as we have here in Heb. (...), a two edged Sword,
have we, Revel. c. 1. v. 16. A sharp two edged Sword, and c. 19. v. 15. (...),
a sharp Sword, the very word used in this place, which as Grotius says, is
Evangelicus sermo ex Christi ore proficiscens qui intimo penetrat, etc. The
Evangelical word proceeding out of the mouth of Christ which penetrates the
inmost parts, and discerns not only our actions, but our very thoughts whether
good or evil. So Ephesians. c. 6. v. 17. We have the Sword of the spirit which is
the word of God. And what marvel if the Mother of our Lord with this Sword of
the Spirit which is the word of God proceeding out of her mouth should so
pierce the hearts of many, as that they should be forced to disclose the inmost
secrets of their hearts, by confessing of their sins and acknowledging the
ignorance of their ways? Who can question, but that Divine Canticle of hers, I
mean her Magnificat, did melt and pierce the souls of all that heard it? And to
confirm the propriety of the Metaphor in this sense, We have a Tongue that is
like a sharp Raser, Psalm. 52. v. 2. and words that were drawn Swords, Psalm. 55.
v. 21. and a Tongue that is a sharp Sword, Psalm. 57. v. 4.

C. 3. v. 19, 20. (...), etc. And beyond all the Evils which Herod had done, he
added yet this above all, (...), Prae omnibus cupere, To desire above all
things. Dion. Halic.

V. 23. (...) etc. These words seem to me to be rendered most significantly by
trajection, as if it were read, (...), etc. And Jesus was about Thirty years of
age, he himself beginning, being (as was supposed) the Son of Joseph, etc.
(...) i. e. (...), beginning his Genealogy, to wit, on his Fathers side by
reckoning upward, as Matthew recounted that on his Mothers side by reckoning
downward, where he was (...) the last. For it is not properly or significantly
said that Jesus began to be about such an age, it being either tautologous or
dubious. For, (...), About, signifies a time indefinite, either above or under
such a time. As for such trajections, they are most abundantly frequent, as you
may see, Animad. Act. 13.27. 2 Cor. 4.4. 1 Pet. 3.21.

C. 5. v. 14. And he charged him to tell no man, but go and show thy self, etc.
That there is an incoherence in the construction of these words, is evident
enough. And yet in the Greek the sense and Syntax are both good, and so may be
also rendered in the English. (...), etc. And he charged him, remember, or see
thou tell no man, but go and show thy self to the Priest. By a common Elleipsis
the words (...) or (...) are to be understood before, (...). As it is in the
Parallel story, in Math. c. 8. v. 4. (...), or as the same phrase is Translated
in the English, Act. c. 23 v. 22. (...), etc. having charged him, see thou tell
no man, that thou have showed these things unto me. See Act. c. 1. v. 4.

C. 6. v. 35. (...). It Is true the common version suites well enough with the
place. Et mutuum date nihil inde sperantes, And lend hoping for nothing again.
But it is as true, which Beza says, that the word (...) in this signification is
not to be found in any Author, and therefore I conceive it is fit to use another,
which as to the sense suits with the Context well enough, but is much more
agreeable to the dialect of the Greeks. With whom (...) does frequently
signify in the Hebrews Hiphil, desperare facere, to make desperate. In which
sense the Syriack, Arabic, and Persian Interpreters seem all to have
understood it, whereof the last most properly reads, Ne quempiam desperabundum
faciatis, as if it had been written in the Greek with an Apostrophe, (...),
Neminem desperare facientes, Love your enemies, and do good and lend causing no
man to despair. And in this sense may you find the word, Isai. c. 29. v. 19.
(...), Desperati homines implebuntur laetitia, Desperate men shall be filled
with gladness. And Ecclesiast. c. 27. v. 24. (...), Qui autem denudavit
mysteria desperavit, i. e. desperare fecit, He that has revealed secrets makes
men to despair of him, as it is in the Roman Edition; and in Stephanus, (...),
Desperare faciens Parents reditum, Causing his Parents to despair of his
return. And so we have in Pliny lib. 22. cap. 24. Vulnera desperantia, Wounds
that make the Surgeon to despair the cure. And this I take to be the proper
reading and Genuine signification in this place, (...), Neminem desperare
facientes, Causing no man to despair.

C. 7. v. 30. (...), Spreverunt voluntatem dei erga semetipsos. By a frequent
trajection, But the Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the will of God toward
themselves, who would have had them called to repentance by the Preaching and
Baptism of John the Baptist. (...), Hesych.

C. 11. v. 41. (...). I cannot but differ from Interpreters in the Translation
and meaning of these words, which I rather render thus, Immo quae insunt date
Eleemosynam, and ecce omnia vobis erunt munda, But give you the things that are
within for alms, and behold all shall be clean unto you, (...), and (...),
Phav. And this sense the scope of the place requires. For in allusion to what
is said before, (...) and (...) signify one and the same thing, and so does
(...) in the Parallel place in Matthew c. 23. v. 26. (...), Purga prius quod
intus est poculi, ut id quoque quod extra est fiat purum, Clean first that
which is within the cup, that is as here, Give you first the things that are
within for alms, that the outside may be clean also, that is also as is here,
and behold all shall be clean unto you, the sense requiring the same
interpretation in both places being Parallel. So as (...) must necessarily be
Translated here as (...) is there. The meaning of the place being thus, Ye
Pharisees make a fair show without, ye make long Prayers and perhaps ye give
alms to the poor openly in the streets, but within ye are full of rapine and
extortion. If therefore ye will that all ye have be clean in the eyes of God,
give to the poor for alms, all the goods you have gotten by rapine and
extortion, (...) and (...), these secret ill got goods which lie hid within
from the eyes of men, this is truly to purge the inside of the pot, and then
that which is without shall be clean unto you. Indefinitely whatever is within,
the inside of the cup is thoroughly to be cleansed, that is to say, all they had
got by rapine and extortion, were to be given to the poor in alms. Yet not so,
that the bare restitution of their ill got goods was alone satisfactory: No,
but until they did refund in alms (for it was impossible to make a restitution
to every man of his own,) all which they had got by evil means, nothing they
should give or offer unto God would be accepted of him, but that whatever it
were he would account it as unclean; but as soon as they had bestowed all their
ill got goods in alms unto the poor, then (...) and (...) the things without,
and all the rest they had should be clean before the Lord, so that whatever
they offered to him afterward should be pleasing and acceptable to him. And
this I conceive to be the proper meaning of this place; for it were a very
faint command for our Savior to bid them, to give of such things as they had,
it matters not how little, in comparison of bestowing all their ill got goods
in alms.

C. 12. v. 49. (...), Ignem veni mittere in terram, and quid volo? utinam jam
accensus esset, I am come to send fire on the earth, and what would I? O that
it were already kindled. But I have a Baptism to be Baptized with, and how am I
streightened until it be accomplished? It is the speech of a troubled mind, the
parallel whereof you may see Joh. 12.27. Now is my soul troubled, (...); and
what shall I say? Father save me from this hour, (...), but for this cause came
I to this hour, Father glorify thy name. He checks himself in either place,
(...) with the LXX is of the same force as utinam, Number. 22.29. Jos. 7.7. and
elsewhere. (...) is the fire of Persecution which began with Jesus.

C. 13. v. 33. (...), etc. For it may not, or cannot be that a Prophet perish
out of Jerusalem. And in this acception of the word is (...) very frequent in
Epicurus, (...), It may be the Moon has her light from herself, it may be from
the Sun, whom Lucretius interprets accordingly, Lunaque sive notho fertur
loca lumine lustrans,
Sive suam proprio jactat de corpore lucem.
And that it could not be otherwise but all the Prophets must perish in
Jerusalem, Drusius has observed, that the Prophets were not judged but by the
Judges in the Sanhedrim, who always had their residence in Jerusalem, in a
public house, such as is our Convocation or Chapter house. And so it
immediately follows, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem which killest the Prophets, etc.

C. 15. v. 4. (...), What man of you having an hundred Sheep, if he loose one
of them, does not he leave the Ninety and Nine, and goes after that which is
lost in the Wilderness, until he find it. This trajection is familiar, and so
we distinguish and read, Mat. c. 18. v. 12. He leaves the Ninety and Nine,
(...), and goes into the Mountains and seeks that which is lost. The desert
wherein John Baptist lived and taught, Mat. c. 3. v. 1. is called (...), and
Luke c. 1. v 39. (...), montana, wherein Zachary did dwell.

C. 18. v. 7. (...). Understand, (...), as the Old Latin seems to have done,
and patientiam habebit? (...), may be Translated two several ways. If you
understand the Elect, then it must be Propter illos, and patientiam habebit diu
propter illos? And shall he long have patience for them? (...) with a Dative
does sometimes signify, For, Scot. But if by (...) you understand, their
adversaries, as it may well be, for the Widow desired the Judge to avenge her
of her Adversary, v. 3. and so I suppose they understood it, who Translate, In
longum differet iram in illos? Shall he long defer his anger toward them? then
must you Translate, And shall he long have patience toward them, that is
toward the Adversaries of the Elect, as we Translate, Ecclesiast. c. 35. v.
18. (...), Neither will the mighty be patient toward them, meaning the
unmerciful and Heathen which are forthwith in the same verse mentioned. That
the verb (...) in all its Moods and Tenses is frequently understood, see
Animad. on Mar. c. 12. v. 40.

V. 8. (...); Verum cum filius hominis venerit, inveniet hanc fidem in hac
terra? But when the Son of man comes shall he find this, that is, such a faith
in this land [of Judaea?] For so (...) is often understood in Scripture, (...)
for (...), and (...) for (...). As is before observed, Matthew. c. 11. v. 9. The
sense is, When the Son of man comes to the destruction of Jerusalem shall he
find such a Faith in the Land, as shall importune God with its prayers, as did
the troublesome or importunate Widow who never left the unjust Judge till he
had avenged her? a faith which shall pray and never faint, according to which
he commanded his disciples to pray in the beginning of the chapter. Neither is
there any other commodious interpretation of the words. You have likewise,
(...) for (...) visibly and expressly, c. 21. v. 23. (...), Erit enim pressura
magna in hac terra, and ira in populo isto, For there shall be great distress
in this land and wrath upon this people.

C. 22. v. 20. (...), This cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed
for you. But this Translation makes a gross Soloecism in the Greek, whereof I
would not willingly allow our Evangelist to be guilty. For in my blood which is
shed for you implies that (...) relates to (...) the Nominative to the Dative,
which in Syntax is by no means to be allowed; neither do I think our Evangelist
did more intend to join (...), and (...), here, then he did to couple (...),
and (...), c. 1. v. 55. So that I cannot but admire with admiration, when the
Excellent De Dieu is so confident in saying, Et si (...) casu differat a (...)
dubium tamen non est, quin cum eo sit construendum, neque ullus hic praeterea
Solaecismus statuendus. And to prove that this construction is no Solaecism he
produces these examples following, where an Oblique case may be turned into a
Nominative, Ephesians. c. 3. v. 17, and 18. (...), etc. for (...), etc. But there as
Beza rightly tells you, (...), etc. does most properly agree with the verb
(...), (...) being to be construed by trajection, Ut in charitate radicati and
fundati possitis ass^qui, etc. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith,
that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend, etc. as it
is in our English, and Joh. c. 1. v. 14. (...), etc. for (...). But that
construction is much better salved by the ordinary Parenthesis, as it is in
Rob. Steph. Curcellaeus, the Old Latin, and our English. And lastly Apoc. c. 1.
v. 4, and 5. (...), etc, and (...), etc. For which construction there may be
this reasonable account, (...), ab eo, qui est nomine, (...), and a Jesu
Christo, qui nomine est, (...), From him who is by name, Who is, and who was,
and who is to come, and from Jesus Christ, who is by name, The faithful
witness, etc. like as when we say according to Drusius, Augustinus in de
Civitate dei, for in libris de Civitate dei. Besides this is a singular
expression in St John, and will not serve however to justify such an
irregularity in St Luke, who by all is acknowledged to be generally learned,
and not unskilful in the Greek, (...) Sophron. (...), Theophil. so that if
there be any way to reconcile the Construction and the Sense I would choose
That rather then to fasten such a Barbarism on our Evangelist, which truly I
conceive may be done by saying there is a (...), vitium scriptoris, a fault in
the transcriber, the like fault whereunto we do admit in other places, and that
instead of (...), it should have been written, (...), This cup is the New
Testament in my blood which is shed for you, and this supposition makes the
construction regular, and is but a light mistake, unless you will say that
(...) is appositive to (...). And then Translate it thus, This cup which is
poured forth for you [in token of my blood which is to be shed for the
remission of your sins] is, or does signify the New Testament in my blood.
Neither is this exposition or sense so harsh and difficult, but it may be
fairly admitted and understood.

V. 32. (...). I confess that the Passive is often taken for the Active in the
New Testament, and sometimes, though much more seldom, the Active for the
Passive, but why it should be taken in this place I see no necessity at all,
especially when the proper interpretation of (...) in the Active sense does on
the contrary better agree with the scope of the place. Thus, The Lord said unto
Peter, Simon, Simon, behold Satan has desired thee to sift thee as wheat, but
I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not. And when thou art converted
strengthen thy brethren. As if he should say, As I have prayed for thee that
thy faith may not fail, when Satan shall tempt thee, so do thou likewise, when
thou have converted any of thy brethren to the faith, pray for them, i. e.
confirm them or strengthen them by thy prayers, that their faith may not fail,
when Satan shall tempt them. As if it were read, (...). which word (...) is to
be understood, or (...) to be repeated, a form of speech extremely frequent.
You have it in the very preceding verse but even now mentioned. (...), i. e.
(...), and in the 54. following, (...), for (...), Then took they him and led
him, etc. See Animad. Act. 13.27. According to the common Translation, it
should have been written properly in the Passive voice, (...), And thou when
thou art converted. Neither does it seem at all fit to say, And thou one day
when thou shall be converted, who was already before converted, though he
afterward fell, as our Savior had foretold him. Neither I think will any man
fix the moment of Peter's conversion in the crowing of the cock, if any do,
(...), One day, is said in vain, for that word intimates a more distant time,
then the space of a few hours, or minutes.

ANNOTATIONS ON S. John.
Chapter 5. v. 4.

(...), Whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was
healed, or made whole of whatsoever disease he had. Many things concurred says
learned Grotius, that this should not be thought any natural kind of healing by
the water. And I conceive this alone to be argument enough, That none was
healed but he who first stepped in after the troubling of the waters. One only
was healed by one only moving of the waters. If the cure had been by a natural
cause, why were not more healed then one at the same time? But certainly there
was something supernatural in this matter, the reason whereof it is not
necessary for us to know. It is enough for us that we are assured of the truth
by Evangelical Authority.

Chapter 7. v. 22. Moses therefore, (...), etc. Certainly these words (...), ought
to have been severed by a distinction to the former. Thus, (...), etc. Unum
opus feci, and omnes miramini propter illud. Moses dedit vobis circumcifionem,
etc. I have done one work and ye all wonder because of it. Moses gave you
Circumcision, etc. And so is the sense perfect without any Solaecism, neither
is there any need of any disquisition concerning the unusualness of the phrase
or inconsequence of the words. The Verb (...) being familiarly used in our
sense with a Praeposition, as Mar. c. 6. v. 6. (...), Et mirabatur propter
incredulitatem eorum, He marvelled because of their unbelief. And so elsewhere.

C. 8. v. 4. (...), This woman was taken in Adultery in the very act. The
Syriack reads aperte. But in my opinion it should be rather written with an
Apostrophe, (...), and Translated thus, Haec mulier deprehensa est in sui
ipfius conspectu Adulterans, This woman was taken committing Adultery in her
own very sight. So openly that she cannot with any face deny it. The word
comes from (...) and the Praeterperfect tense of the Verb (...), (...). So
says Phavorinus, (...), and (...), Qui a seipso redarguitur, and conspectus
est, He who is convinced and seen of himself.

C. 11. v. 10. (...), Quia lux non est in eo, that is, in mundo, Because there
is no light in it, that is, in the world. Not, in him, as is commonly rendered,
which agrees not with common sense. But thus it is perfect sense and
construction both. If any man walks in the day he stumbleth not, (...),
Because he sees the light of the world, but if a man walks in the night, he
stumbleth, (...), because there is no light in it, that is, relating to the
foregoing word, in the world. He does closely reprehend his disciples by a
Parable, who stumbled at the mention of his going up to Jerusalem, telling them
they ought not to stumble as long as he who was the light of the world was in
the world, c. 9. v. 5. but when he should be taken out of the world, it would
be no marvel if they stumbled, and therefore he exhorts them, c. 12. v. 35. To
walk while they have light, least darkness should come upon them, for yet a
little while the light was with them, and he that walks in darkness knows
not whither he goes. Or thus, The disciples stumbled or were offended, when he
said let us go up to Jerusalem. The reason was they walked in the night of
infidelity and ignorance, for they would not, or did not understand that our
Lord should suffer. As it is likewise said Luke c. 18. v. 34. When Jesus said
unto them, behold we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be perfected
which are written by the Prophets of the Son of man, etc. They understood none
of these things, and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the
things which were spoken. They dreamed so of a temporal Kingdom, that they
could by no means understand that our Lord should suffer, whom they expected to
be a King to restore the Kingdom of Israel.

V. 33. (...), He groaned in his spirit, which troubled him. The conjunction
(...) is frequently so to be interpreted in the New Testament, as you may see,
Animad. 15.6.20.18. Apocal. 1.6. According to the Hebrew Idiotum, as Beza
says, which while Interpreters do not observe, they often trouble the Syntax
and the sense, as in this very place: for certainly it is not good sense to
say, He groaned in the spirit and troubled himself. But to say his spirit
troubled him, is all one with that, 13.21. (...), he was troubled in his spirit.

V. 39. (...), For he has been dead Four days. Rasis the Arabic Physician
has left it written, as I have it from Quistorpius, That it was ordained by a
law, that no Apoplecticks, who foamed about the mouth, should be buried, till
after 72 hours, and considering the reason he declares it to be an excellent
law, because all the humors had perfected and finished their motions in Three
days, that is in 72 hours, which term of the motion of the humors being once
finished, there is no more of life to be expected. And from hence he infers,
that Jesus Christ did not raise up Lazarus again to life till he had been Four
days dead, that there might be no place of objection left to the speculation of
any Naturalist, who, if he had been raised within the 72 hours, would have
denied it to be a Miracle.

C. 13. v. 10. (...), He that is washed needs not to have even his feet
washed, but is clean every whit. For what need can there be pretended to wash
his feet, who has been before washed all over from head to foot, yet to follow
his discourse, which notwithstanding was besides his purpose which he intended
in the washing of his disciples feet, he farther tells them, But ye are not
all clean, for he knew who it was that should betray him. His principle meaning
was to teach them Humility by his example as is evident by the Context.

C. 15. v. 6. (...), Si quis in me non maneat projicitur for as ut palms qui
exaruit, If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch which is
withered. And thus it is entire and perfect sense, neither is the construction
or Translation at all new or unusual, though the want of the thought thereof
has puzzled most Interpreters in the rendering of this place. Our very
Evangelist has the same manner of speech, c. 20. v. 18. (...), Quod vidisset
dominum qui ea sibi dixisset, That she had seen the Lord who had spoken these
things unto her. And Luke c. 15. v. 15. (...), Abiit igitur and adhaesit uni ex
civibus regionis illius qui misit eum in agrum, And he went and joined himself
to a Citizen of that Country who sent him into his fields to feed swine. And
Act. c. 6. v. 6. (...), Quos statuerunt in conspectu Apostolorum qui adhibitis
precibus imposuerunt eis manus, Whom they set before the Apostles who when they
had prayed laid their hands on them. In all which places Beza renders (...),
Qui, bringing on this last place in his Annotations two examples of the same
phrase, the one out of Mark c. 1. v. 10. the other out of Plutarch. For more
abundant satisfaction, see note on Matthew. c. 27. v. 9, 10. and Act. c. 7. v. 10.

V. 20. (...). The word (...) without doubt in this place ought not to be
taken, for to keep or observe, simply, but rather to be understood in the
worser sense, and seems to be used for (...) insidiose observare, that is to
watch, with intention to entrap, as it is said, Luke 14.1. (...), And they
watched him, Ut captarent quod in eo reprehenderent, as Stephanus observes. And
20.20. (...), etc. And they watched him and sent forth spies, that they might
take hold of his words. And that this is the meaning of (...) and (...) in this
place, the joining of (...) with (...), makes very probable, but the whole
sense together beginning from the 18 verse does evince it clearly. (...), etc.
If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you, etc.
Remember the word that I said unto you, 13.16. the servant is not greater then
the Lord, if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you, if they
have watched my sayings, they will also watch yours, But all these things will
they do unto you for my Name sake. Certainly all in the worser sense, They will
persecute you, they will treacherously watch your words for my Names sake, that
they may catch somewhat out thereof, whereof to accuse you, as they have done
to me, for the Servant is not above the Lord. If they have called the Master of
the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household so?
Matthew. 10.25. Neither is the use of this word (...) for to watch or to observe
in the same sense insolent at all, as you may see in Stephanus. You shall find
it bears much the like sense, Ecclesiast. 11.4. (...), He that observes the
wind, shall not sow, (...). In which sense you have the word (...) often in the
Old Testament, and somewhat more to our purpose. As Psalm. 56.7. (...), They
shall watch or observe my steps, Calcaneum meum observabunt, (...). A word
Synonymous to (...). And 71.11. (...), Et observationes animae meae, (...), And
they that lay wait for my soul consult together. In both which places it might
have been lawfully Translated (...) and (...) instead of (...) and (...).

C. 16. v. 26. (...), In that day ye shall ask in my Name, and not, I say unto
you, because I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himself loves you,
etc. I say unto you, intervenes by way of Parenthesis, and answers in effect to
both members of the speech. As if he should have said, I say unto you, in that
day ye shall ask the Father in my name, and he shall hear you, not because I
will pray him for you, but because he himself loved you, for that ye have loved
me, and have believed that I came from God.

V. 30. (...), Now are we sure that thou know all things, and need not
that any man should ask thee, by this we believe that thou came forth from
God. If any man ask, What means [And need not that any man should ask thee.]
Let him but look back to the 19 verse, where it is said that Jesus knew his
disciples were desirous to ask him, although they inquired only among
themselves, what it meant, that he said unto them, Yet a little while and ye
shall see me, etc. For this therefore do they now say that they did believe
that he came forth from God, because he knew what they intended in their
thoughts, and therefore needed not that they should ask him any question.
(...), For it is God alone that knows the secrets of the heart.

C. 18. v. 17, and 25. (...); Nonne and tu ex discipulis es hominis istius? Art
not thou also one of this man's disciples? (...), nonne.

C. 20. v. 17. (...), Jesus said unto Mary, Touch me not. What can be the
meaning of that? Matthew. c. 28. v. 9. (...), They held his feet. After the
Resurrection. They must needs therefore touch him, which Thomas also might have
done, v. 27. The Old Latin therefore not willing an argument should be drawn
from the words next following, that he would not be touched, does prudently and
very rightly include them in a Parenthesis and so Connects noli me tangere with
vade autem ad fratres meos, etc. Meddle not, as may be more significantly
rendered, with me, (for I am not yet ascended to my Father.) But go unto my
Brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, etc. As if
he should say, he would not have her stay any longer in embracing of him, or
meddling with him, but that she should forthwith go unto the Disciples and
comfort them, who no doubt were dismayed, by telling them, that he was not yet
ascended, but that he would shortly ascend to their Father and his, and to
their God and his. Then which there never was a more comfortable Message, all
circumstances considered.

C. 21. v. 22. If I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee? And by
this speech he did plainly intimate, that John should remain alive till in
truth he should come, as in very deed he did, to wit, to the destruction of
Jerusalem, and Thirty years after, if we may believe Historians and
Chronologers, in which number also they are to be reckoned, Matthew. c. 16. v.
28. who Jesus says should not taste of death, though then standing by, till
they saw the Son of man coming in his Kingdom. The Destruction of Jerusalem
being frequently understood by the coming of Christ. Which notwithstanding was
not at that time known. For there went out a saying among the Brethren that
this Disciple should not die. And so Tertullian, misled with this error,
affirmed, That they were deceived in their hope who expected that John should
remain alive until the coming of the Lord; Obiit enim and Johannes, For John
was also dead. For he understood not those words of the coming of the Lord in
his Kingdom to take vengeance of the Jews by the Destruction of Jerusalem, but
of his last coming in the day of Judgment, and in that sense he said they were
deceived of their hopes.

ANNOTATIONS ON The Acts.
Chapter 1. v. 4.

(...). The proper interpretation of this word is to be fetched out of the
parallel place in St Lukes Gospel, c. 24. v. 26. etc. Where he relates the same
continued story, which immediately preceded the Ascension of our Lord, varying
only the circumstances and words. How Jesus after his Resurrection, that he
might take away all doubting out of the minds of his Disciples, who believed
they saw a spirit, when he appeared to them, after that he had showed them his
hands and feet to feel, and yet they would not believe; for a most certain
argument of his Resurrection, that they should no longer think they saw a
Vision or Spirit, he ask't them if they had any thing to eat, and when they had
given him part of a honey comb and a broiled fish, he did eat before them, and
at the very same place and time whilst he was eating with them, he said unto
them, Behold I will send the promise of my Father unto you. And by this
argument, says St Chrysostom, the Apostles did always assert the truth of his
Resurrection, and therefore Peter, as he has it, (...), when he would gain
faith to the Resurrection, uses the same argument, Act. c. 10. v. 41. How God
raised him up the third day, and showed him to us, who did eat and drink with
him after he was risen from the dead. So as I think we may with confidence
resolve, that the true interpretation of (...) in this place is that of the Old
Latin Interpreter, that is, Convescens, whilst he was eating together with
them. For he repeateth here all the rest of the same things, which he had
commanded in his Gospel at the same place and time. Ibid. (...). These words as
I conceive may be more truly Translated being thus distinguished without any
supplement or breach of Syntax, and yet with a more commodious sense in this
manner, Praecepit eis. Nolite ab Hierosolyma discedere, sed expectate
promissionem patris, quam audistis, mei, He charged them, remember or see ye
depart not from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of my Father which ye have
heard of me. You have the very same sense, almost the words in the Parallel
place in his Gospel, c. 24. v. 49. And behold I send the promise of my Father
upon you, but tarry ye in the City of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power
from above. By a most familiar Elleipsis the Infinitive is put for the
Imperative, understanding (...) or (...), or the like before (...) and (...).
Examples whereof are frequent in Heathen Authors, especially in Phocylides
almost in every verse, (...).
(...),
(...), etc.
Ne ditescas injuste sed ex just partis vive.
Esto contentus praesentibus and ab alienis abstine,
Omnibus justa tribue.
Wax not rich unjustly but live of well got goods.
Be content with present, abstain from other men's,
Give every one his due.
You have the very like in Sacred writ and that often, Act. c. 23. v. 22.
(...). Where the English reads, And charged him, see thou tell no man that thou
have showed these things to me. And this version the sense and Syntax do in
both places necessarily require. So you have Romans c. 12. v. 14, 15. (...),
Benedicite and ne imprecemini, gaudete cum gaudentibus, and flete cum
flentibus, Bless and curse not, rejoyc with them that do rejoice, and weep with
them that weep. See Ruth c. 1. v. 6. Matthew. c. 5. v. 39. Luke c. 5. v. 14. Act.
c. 23. v. 24. And in many other places. As for the particle (...), I conceive
it is more suitably, as without doubt it is more regularly, rendered in this
place, The promise of my Father which you have heard, because (...), are the
very words our Evangelist uses in the Parallel place in his Gospel, much
rather then, The promise of the Father which ye have heard of me, as usually
they do with a most violent construction. Whereas the trajection is most common
and familiar.

V. 25. (...), That is, (...), or (...). And that (...) may be taken here for
(...) Oecumenius teaches clearly in his Exposition on these words, (...), etc.
(...). His proper place, he either calls the strangling [whereof Judas died] or
because Judas being fallen, he had his place who took his Bishopric, for it
cannot be imagined what (...) can possibly signify in this place of
Oecumenius, but (...), locum ejus, his place into which Matthias was to
succeed, that is the Apostleship of Judas from which he was by transgression
fallen. As out of this very place Clarius has animadverted on these words, In
locum suum, si ad Judam referas, videtur intelligere laqueum quo se dignnm
judicavit ob proditionem, sin ad Matthiam, intellige Episcopatum cui successit.
Unto his place, if you look on Judas, it seems to mean the halter whereof he
thought himself worthy for his treachery, if on Matthias, understand the
Bishopric into which he succeeded, that is Judas his Apostleship, for they
were not then ordained Bishops. So Cicero does most frequently use suus instead
of ejus, and that in imitation of the Greeks, as Budaeus says, for, suus, non
modo (...), sed etiam (...) significat and utroque modo apud Graecos accipitur
ut (...) saepissime pro sibi and pro ei, Bud. Com. page 28. So that the
Translation is properly this, Thou Lord who know the hearts of all, show
whether of these two thou have chosen to take part of this Ministry and
Apostleship, from which Judas is by transgression fallen, that he may enter
into his place. That is, that he whom thou have chosen may succeed into the
place of Judas his Apostleship. (...) is the same phrase with (...) in
Demosthenes, which Budaeus interprets Haereditatem adire. For in Cicero,
Haereditatem adire is haereditatem subire or suscipere, To enter upon or to
take upon one the inheritance, as our Holyoak has well observed. And this
interpretation seems to be more reasonable, then that of their's who interpret
it of Judas, as if St Luke should mean, that he was gone to his own or to his
proper place, to wit, as they would have it, unto Hell. It Is true, no man can
make other judgment. But I cannot for all that think the Evangelist had any
such meaning in these words, I rather with Chrysostom look upon, (...), etc.
The prudence of the man, how he speaks not contumeliously nor insults, etc.
Which plainly argues that he thought not, that it was the meaning of St Luke in
these words to adjudge Judas into Hell, For what could he have said of Judas
more contumelious, then that he was gone to his own place, meaning Hell?
Neither was it the business of an Historian or Evangelist to interpose his own
opinion, but rather to leave Judas to the judgment of God, it being enough for
him to have related matter of fact, as he had promised and professed to do in
the beginning of his Gospel. (...), etc. Even as they had delivered things unto
us who were eyewitnesses from the beginning, etc. But who will you say was an
eyewitness of Judas his going to or being in Hell?

C. 2. v. 27. (...), Quoniam non derelinques animam meam in Hade, neque dabis
sanctum tuum videre corruptionem, Because thou will not leave my soul in Hell,
nor give thy holy one to see corruption. The first branch of this verse seems
to concern his Soul which was not left in the state of death, as other humane
Souls. I say, left in the state of death, for it is not one and the same thing
to die, or to be dead, and to be or to remain in the state of death, or if you
please, as it is v. 24. (...), that is (...) in vinculis, in the bonds of
death, as Athanasius and Beza interpret the word; and so in the Psalmist, in
the LXX (...) and (...) are Synonymous, or in those receptacles where the Souls
of the Godly are reserved till they receive their crown, as St Augustine; or in
the middle of the shadow of death where the Souls of the dead are, as Irenaeus;
or in Hades, or in Hell, whither we are taught by the Apostles Creed that he
descended, or went into. Where by the way I cannot but observe, that our
English Hell, comes from the Saxon HELAN, celare, tegere, to hide or cover, so
as it may be said to have the same signification with Hades, (...), (...), a
place that cannot be seen, (...), locus sine luce. Phavor. or else in Paradise
with the Soul of the Thief. All which several expressions serve but to signify
one and the same thing. For I do not see but Paradise may very lawfully be
interpreted a receptacle or separated place for departed Souls, from the Hebrew
(...), separavit, locus separatus, or septum, a close, such as for pleasure and
delight our Parks and Gardens are, from which cause this word has obtained
with the Hebrews the meaning of bliss and pleasure. And I cannot but think the
Greeks borrowed the word from the Hebrews, and that neither of them owe it to
the Persian. For though perchance (which yet is by no means certain) Nehemiah
might borrow it from the Persian, who lived in the Persian Court, yet Solomon
it is certain, which used the same word in Ecclesiastes and in Canticles many
ages before Nehemiah's time, writ in the Hebrew tongue, neither is there any
reason at all to think that he ever used the Persian dialect. Neither is such a
termination with the Hebrews so unusual, with whom such Anomalous words are
frequent, that we should so earnestly disown it, as their due. Neither does the
Rabbis (...) which signifies death, which is a separation, differ from our
sense. Why should we therefore fly from the Hebrew to the Persian, and
acknowledge him to be the true owner of the word? I confess I value the
Authority of Julius Pollux, but I shall not swear unto it. However in sum I
conceive it not unreasonable to say, that the Godly who are in the state of
death, are in Paradise, in what ever place secluded, and finally to conclude,
that this first branch of the verse concerns only his Soul, as the latter
plainly concerns his body, which saw no corruption as other human bodies do.
And in this sense does Peter expressly explain the words, v. 31. (...), Non
relicta est anima ejus in Hade, neque caro ejus vidit corruptionem. That his
Soul was not left in Hell, neither did his flesh see corruption. Plainly
distinguishing between his Soul and Body, as if he did it of set purpose, to
the end that none should think this place concerned the Sepulcher or Grave of
Christ alone, as some would have, that say, that Hades signifies nothing else.
For Perversissimum est, etc. as Tertullian, says, lib. de Carne Christi. It is
a most perverse thing, that naming the flesh, we should understand the Soul, or
naming the Soul we should understand the flesh, The truth of their names is the
safety of their properties. Neither does Athanasius speak less plainly to our
purpose. (...), etc. Neither did death prevail to subjugate his human nature so
far as to detain it in its bonds, neither could corruption by any tyrannical
invasion exercise its power to the putrefaction of his body. Humanae ista lex
necessitatis, etc. says Hilary, It is a law of humane necessity, that the
bodies being buried, the Souls descend into Hell, which descent the Lord
himself did not refuse, to show the truth of his manhood, or human nature. And
doubtless this is the scope of Peter's words in this place, of purpose to prove
the Resurrection of Christ, and that he was not left in the state of death as
other mortals are. And this opinion I hold to be pious and consonant to faith.
I believe the immortality of the Soul, I believe the Resurrection of the body,
and its reunition with the Soul, and life everlasting, I am no friend to
Purgatory, nor to any prayer, supplication or application to any Saint, save
only to our sole Mediator Jesus Christ, who for that particular end ascended
into the holy of holies, that is, into the highest heavens, that there he may
commend our prayers to our Father which is in heaven; who from hence also
conceive may be drawn a cogent argument, that prayers ought not to be made to
Saints, whom Religion has not yet placed in that holy of holies, to wit, the
highest heavens, and so qualified for fitting Mediators. But there are not few
and those no mean ones neither, who positively say, there is no receptacle of
Souls, but affirm that the Souls of the Godly do immediately after their
separation from their bodies go into heaven, that is to say, as I suppose, that
heaven which is properly called heaven. One of whose great Arguments is from
that of Luke c. 23. v. 43. Hodie eris mecum in Paradiso, Thou shall be with me
this day in Paradise. But that day our Savior was not in heaven, unless they
speak and mean aequivocally, for he was not yet ascended either in human Soul
or Body, as far as Scripture does, or reason can inform us. Paradise therefore
must be some other place, namely, this Hades or Hell, as we Translate it, in
which for a short time his Soul was held, to which he properly went, or may be
said to have descended, and in which the same day together with his Soul was
also the Soul of the Thief, where together with the rest of the Souls of the
Godly that are departed (our Saviors only being delivered or loosened from its
bonds the Third day) this Soul of the Thiefs does rest till the last day of the
Resurrection. (...) in horto Eden qui locus est receptaculum animarum post hanc
vitam, Drusius ad locum, Lucae c. 23. v. 43. He speaks the same lib. praeterit.
3o. Paradisum a caelo distingui, quod ille sit receptaculum animarum post
vitam, caelum autem recipiat omnes post judicium extremum. They urge another
argument from St Ambrose, Christum introitu suo aperuisse credentibus regnum
caelorum, That Christ by his entrance had opened the Kingdom of heaven to all
believers. Before which time the Fathers were not made partakers of the
Promise, but that from the death and ascension of Christ they also ascended
with him into heaven, and were there consummate and made perfect, as to their
Souls which then were received into heaven, which before the Ascension of
Christ were not ascended. In answer whereunto, I do truly acknowledge, but not
in their sense, that Christ by his Entrance or Ascension into heaven did open
the Kingdom heaven to all believers, which before was shut to all the world
save only to the Jews, but since the time of his Passion and Ascension open to
any one that strives to enter, so as its now lawful for all persons of all
Nations to press into it, who shall believe in his Name. But to meet the
argument, I beseech you, where were the Souls of the Fathers before they
Ascended with Christ into heaven? For where ever they were, reason persuades
it, and Scripture does not deny it, in the same place was the Soul of Christ,
and where was the Soul of Christ there was also the Soul of the Thief, They
were not yet Ascended, Neither surely were they in a place of torment, for I
cannot think it could be any comfort to the Thief, as I suppose, it was
intended, if Christ should have told him that he should be that day with him in
a place of torment, it must therefore be rationally concluded, that they were
in some third place of rest. In which place if we affirm that the Souls of all
the Godly departed remain till the last day, what danger is there, what
incommodity? If we believe, I say, and believe no more, that there remains to
all a Resurrection in the last day, both Fathers and us, in which day we with
them shall be most perfectly consummate, and that in the mean while all the
Souls of the Godly are in the hands of God, (...). In a place due and proper to
them, as it is in the Epistle of Polycarpus to the Philippians. And all this
while not a moment of time if compared with Eternity. Neither were the old
Christians wont, as Grotius says, to call this middle state of place and time
between this life and the Resurrection, by the name of heaven. But I contain my
self, this question requiring a longer and larger disquisition, then to be shut
up in so narrow limits. And yet a question, which neither Scripture nor any
general Council or Synod had ever yet explicitly determined for an Article of
Faith, before the Convocation at Dublin 1615. Which did then indeed so define
it. That after the end of this life the Souls of the Sons of God were
immediately received into heaven, etc. Perhaps of purpose to meet with the
Romish Purgatory. Neither should I have said thus much, but that many persons
do so tenaciously maintain this last opinion for an Article of their Faith,
that they condemn all who hold otherwise of impiety and heresy. And that these
words seemed to me so plain, that as it were they led me by the hand to the
sense and meaning which I have here laid down, though rarely in that respect
observed of any. I am very much pleased with the modesty of Calvin in this very
argument, when speaking of the Souls of the faithful, and their place and state
after this life, he says, Valde se torquent multi, etc. Many do very much
trouble themselves in disputing what place departed Souls possess, and whether
they enjoy a heavenly glory or not, But it is a rash and foolish thing to enquire
farther or deeper of or in things unknown, then God has permitted us to know.
And elsewhere upon that place of the Gospel aforementioned concerning the Thief
and Paradise, De loco Paradisi curiose and argute disputandum non est, etc. We
must not dispute curiously or subtly of the place of Paradise, let it suffice
us who are ingrafted into the body of Christ by faith, that we shall be
partakers of his life, and so after death enjoy a blessed and cheerful rest,
till that in the coming of Christ the perfect glory of a heavenly life shall
solidly appear unto us. In which opinion I do willingly acquiesce, conceiving
that which I hold to be safe, Probable with Peter Martyr, agreeable to reason,
and not disagreeable to Scripture.

V. 30. (...) in this place is to be taken, (...), or as they say,
materialiter, and denotes the matter of the oath which God swear unto David,
that is, ex fructu lumbi ipsius (...), resurgere facturum Christum, (...), in
carne ut sederet super solium ejus, That out of the fruit of his loins he would
raise up Christ in the flesh to sit upon his Throne. And this is the (...), the
very thing the Apostle seeks to prove, to wit, that Christ rose in the flesh,
which out of the Context is most evident and plain. For he seeing this before
spoke of the Resurrection of Christ, v. 31. and in the following verse it is
positively affirmed, That this Jesus has God raised up, whereof we are
witnesses. So that the word (...), raise up, must not be understood de adventu
Christi, of the coming of Christ into the world, as some would have it, but of
his Resurrection; and so affirms Beza, (...), melius praesenti argumento
quadrare, si de Resurrectione Christi accipiatur, quam si ad Adventum referas,
That, to raise up Christ, does better square with the present argument, if it
be understood of his Resurrection then if you refer it to his Coming. But if
that word alone square better with the scope of the place, then does it much
more to raise him up (...) in the flesh, it being the very thing which was to
be proved. So as it cannot be denied, but it does much obscure the sense and
scope of the words to say, that according to the flesh he would raise up Christ
to sit upon his Throne. (...) does frequently signify In, as (...), in
Antiochia. Act. c. 15. v. 23. (...), in tempore, in due time. Romans c. 5. v. 6.
(...), Hesych. (...), manserant in loco, Phavor.

C. 3. v. 18, 19, 20. These three verses I suppose may better be distinguished
and Translated thus, (...), etc. Deus autem secundum ea quae praenuntiavit per
os omnium prophetarum Christum perpessurum, implevit ita (paenitemini igitur
and convertimini ut deleantur peccata vestra) ut venerint tempora refrigerii ab
ira domini, and miserit qui vobis praenunciatus est Jesum Christum, quem
oportet caelum recipere, etc. But God according to what he had foretold by the
mouth of all his Prophets that Christ should suffer, has fulfilled so (repent
ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out) that the days
of refreshment from the anger of the Lord are come, and that he has sent unto
you who was before foretold of, Jesus Christ, Whom the heavens must receive,
etc. These words by postponing of the Parenthesis to its proper place,
according to our common way of speaking, are more clearly understood Thus. But
God according to what he had foretold by the mouth of all his Prophets that
Christ should suffer, has fulfilled so that the days of refreshment or rest
from the anger of the Lord are come, and that he has sent unto you who was
before foretold of Jesus Christ, whom the heaven must receive until the times
of the consummation of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all
his holy Prophets, since the world began. Repent ye therefore and be converted
that your sins may be blotted out. You have the like intervenient Parentheses
in many places, as Joh. c. 1. v. 14. Luke c. 1. v. 55. c. 2. v. 34, 35. and
elsewhere, (...), for (...), a common Grecism, and so read the Syriack, and the
Aethiop. (...), Bud. and so is it Translated often, as Matthew. c. 6. v. 5.
(...), Ut appareant, That they may appear. Luke c. 2. v. 35. (...), Ut
revelentur, and elsewhere. (...), lawfully, ab ira domini, for (...) in Hebrew
signifies faciem and iram. (...), Hesych. (...), praenuntiatum, rightly. (...),
tempora consummationis. (...), Hesych. and Phav. And so Oecumenius, (...), It
behooves all things to be finished and brought to an end. See Matthew. c. 17. v.
11.

C. 7. v. 4. (...), etc. Et inde postquam mortuus est pater ejus, transtulit
illum in hanc terram in qua vos nunc habitatis, And from thence after his
Father was dead, he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell. It has
not a little troubled Interpreters, that Stephen should here say, that God
removed Abraham out of Charran after the death of his Father, because it is
said, Genesis c. 12. v. 4. That Abraham went out of Charran in the 75 year of his
age, and c. 11. v. 26. that he was born in the 70 year of Terah his age, and v.
32. that Terah was 205 years old when he died. For from hence it follows that
Terah overlived the departure of Abraham out of Charran 60 years. Therefore to
untie this knot almost all our late Chronologers and Interpreters, all other
opinions exploded, will have Abraham to be born in the 130 year of Terahs age,
and not in the 70, as others of Ancient times have thought, for if to 130 years
you add 75 which was the age of Abraham when he went out of Charran, you fall
just into the true year of the death of Terah. And to make this opinion good,
they say, it is not necessary that from Genesis c. 11. v. 26. it should be
understood that Abraham was born in the 70 year of Terah, but that in that year
Terah began to be a Father. For that it is not expressly said that Abraham was
born in that year, but that Terah lived 70 years and begat Abraham, Nahor, and
Haran, from whence they will not have it concluded that Abraham was the Eldest
Brother, because first named, but say they, it is more likely he was the
Youngest, and that for preheminencies sake only he was first named of Moses.
And that they may make this opinion yet surer, they frame an argument out of
their own supposita, whereby they think to fasten an absurdity upon those of
another judgment. Thus, If Abraham were the Eldest Son, then Sarah his wife the
Daughter to his Brother Haran, and but Ten years Younger then Abraham, Genesis c.
17. v. 17. must necessarily be born to Haran in the Eighth year of his age,
which would be ridiculous to affirm But to answer this argument in the first
place. First, I see no cause to grant that Sarah was the Daughter of Haran. For
that question is not yet resolved. For who that reads Genesis c. 20. v. 12. Indeed
she is my sister, she is the daughter of my Father, but not the daughter of my
Mother, will not confidently conclude that Sarah was the Sister of Abraham and
the Daughter of Terah, but not by one and the same wife? especially such a
Solemn asseveration being added, as if he had spoke it purposely to free
himself from the suspicion of speaking falsely. Whereupon Hierome, after another
Exposition of the words first, adds, Sed quia in Hebraeo habet, Vere soror
mea est, filia Patris mei, sed non filia Matris meae, magis sonat quod Abrahae
soror fuit. In excusationem ejus dicimus, nec dum illo tempore tales nuptias
esse prohibitas. But because it is in the Hebrew, Indeed she is my sister, she
is the daughter of my Father, but not the daughter of my Mother, it sounds
rather that she was Abraham's sister. We say for his excuse, that as yet such
marriages were not prohibited. As also the Hebrew Doctors, among the six sorts
of unjust copulations, reckon that for one, cum sorore uterina, with the sister
by the Mother. Nay Musculus is yet more plain, Omnia haec commenta simplicitas
Hebraica respuit, quid est enim necesse torqueri in re tam clare expressa? etc.
The Hebrew simplicity rejects all these devices, for what necessity is there to
be troubled in a thing so clearly expressed? He says, Indeed she is my sister,
the daughter of my Father, and that she might not be thought to be of one and
the same belly, he adds, and not the daughter of my Mother, so that it is
manifest, that Sarah was born to Terah by another wife, then that of whom he
had Abraham. To this may be added out of Eusebius, (...), Abrahamus vero a
Patre accipit uxorem suam Saram, Abraham takes his wife Sarah from his Father,
not from Haran. And by this appears that this question is not yet determined
But be it granted that Sarah was Ischah and the daughter of Haran, what hinders
but Abraham might be born when Haran was Forty years of age? And then how
easily might Sarah be the Daughter of Haran, and but Ten years Younger then
Abraham, and no absurdity follow that Haran was but Eight years old when Sarah
was born? For though the Scripture say, That Terah lived 70 years and begat
Abraham, Nahor and Haran, it does not therefore necessarily follow, that Terah
at that time began to be a Father, no more then that Terah begat them all in
that year, which I suppose no man will affirm; or that Noah began to be a
Father, when he is said to have been Five hundred years old, and to have
begotten, Shem, Ham and Japhet. But certainly it is much more probable, that
Terah began to be a Father about the 30th year of his age, and about that time
begat Haran, about which time his Progenitors began to be Fathers, and about
which time our late Chronologers would have Cainan (whom Luke interposeth in
his Genealogy) begin to be a Father. I say Haran, because he seems to be the
Eldest Brother, if both Nahor and Abraham married his Daughters. But if Haran
were born to Terah in his Thirtieth year, it behooved him to be 40 years old
when Abraham was born to Terah in his 70th, and if Sarah were born to Haran in
the 50th year of his age, which it is lawful and fit enough to guess, then must
she be Ninety years old when Abraham was an Hundred. So that the argument which
would fix an absurdity upon Dissenters, falls to the ground either way. And of
this opinion, which to me seems very probable and equal, Josephus gave me the
hint, Antiq. Jud. lib. 1. where he expressly affirms that Abraham was born in
the 70th year of Terah, and afterward apart, that he had to his brothers Nahor
and Haran, without having any regard to their age, as being not material, and
as if they might have been born at any other time, even before the 70th of
their Father. For there is mention made of them only because they are named in
the sequent History. And the same with Submission I suppose may in the like
manner be understood of the Patriarch Noah, that is to say, that he begot Shem
in the 500 year of his age, neither in that year began to be a Father, but that
Shem had Brothers, Japhet and Cham, who might likewise have been born many
years before the 500 year of Noah, named only Gen, c. 5. v. 32. because there
is mention made of them in the following Story, as in the same manner are named
Nahor and Haran, Genesis c. 11. v. 26. My arguments for either opinion are these.
First, It argues, that Shem was born in the 500 year of Noah, because it
behooveth his age, as also that of Abraham to be fixed, in whose offspring,
Tendens ad Abrahamum civitatis dei ordo dirigitur, The line of the City of God
[that is of his Church] was to be directed down to Abraham. As it is in titulo
c. 10. lib. 15. August. de Civit. Dei. But it is objected, that Shem could not
be born in the 500 year of Noah, because its said, Genesis c. 11. v. 10. That Shem
was an Hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad Two years after the Flood, from
whence they gather that Noah begat Shem in the Five Hundred and Second year of
his age. Whereof Scaliger gave warning, Can. Isag. lib. 3. Sciant vero Studiosi
quosdam biennium plus quam nos ab Adam ad Exodum putare, idque propter Natalem
Arphaxad, qui contigerat anno secundo Diluvii. Nos non omisimus quidem illum
annum, sed annum Quingentesimum Noae, and Millesimum Sexcentesimum
Quinquagesimum Sextum Diluvii currentes accipimus, But let Scholars know, that
some do reckon two years more then we do from Adam to the going out of Egypt,
and that because of the Birth time of Arphaxad, which happened the second year
of the Flood. We have not omitted that year, but we take the Five Hundredth year
of Noah, and the Thousand, Six Hundred Fifty and Sixth year of the Flood from
the Creation of the World both current. For demonstration sake suppose, that
Noah was born the first day of the first month (as all agree that he was born
in the beginning of the year) and that in the Five Hundredth year of his age he
begat Shem, perhaps Fourteen days before the year was fully ended, and then
must Shem be an Hundred years old fourteen days before the Six Hundredth year of
Noah's age was expired. So that when the Flood was dried up and Noah went out
of the Ark in the Six Hundred and first year of his age, in the second month
and the Seven and Twentieth day of the month, Genesis c. 8. v. 13, 14. then was
Shem an Hundred years old, 14 days, one month and 27 days, that is, one Hundred
years and 71 days old, on which Seven and Twentieth day if Shem did first begin
(as it is reasonable and lawful enough to conjecture) to give his mind to the
duty of Marriage after the Flood, then from that day within the space of 280
days, according to the time of life, might Arphaxad be born, unto which if you
add 71, the remainder of the age of Shem after the Hundredth already reckoned,
there will be in the whole 351, so that there will be still remaining of the
Hundredth year of the age of Shem yet current, taking out 351 out of 365 days
the whole space of a year, 14 days. And therefore did not Scaliger unfitly take
the 500 year of Noah current, and it is rightly said according to the plain
letter of the Scripture, Et Semus erat Centum annorum filius and genuit
Arphaxad secundo anno post Diluvium, And Shem was an Hundred years old and
begat Arphaxad the second year after the Flood. But here they further object,
that Arphaxad was born (...), which they interpret, duobus annis, two years
after the Flood. But what (...) means, I conceive the LXX did more rightly
interpret (...), as also did Augustine and Scaliger, secundo anno Diluvii, or
post Diluvium. For if from the Creation of the World to the Flood be reckoned
1656 years, as all confess according to Hebrew account, and from the Flood to
the Birth of Abraham, suppose him to be born in the 70 year of Terah, 292, it
is necessary, that the first year of those 292 years begin from the Flood
beginning, or the beginning of the Flood, and consequently the 1657 year from
the Creation of the World, in which we say Arphaxad was born, must of necessity
be the second after the Flood. As to this proof it is the same though you admit
Abraham to be born in the 130 year of Terah. So that Scaliger did neither
unfitly take the year of the Flood also current. If any shall yet cavil at the
interpretation of (...), besides the very demonstration, he calls the judgment
of the LXX, as also the judgment of those persons whom all ages must
acknowledge to be learned, and the very use of speech with the Hebrew into
question, with whom (...) is filius secundi anni, that is a son who is in the
compass of the second year of his age, with the Latins termed bimus, and with
the Greeks (...), whereof you may see note on Matthew. c. 2. v. 16. But suppose
the word be taken in the strict sense as they would have it, and be Translated
two years after the Flood, why may not Moses, though Arphaxad was born within
the space of two years complete, speak (...) sed (...) numero completo forte
posito pro fracto, using a complete number perhaps for a broken one, ut etiam
apud Demosthenem and Plautum talentum numerari videmus ubi non exiguus
drachmarum numerus deest vel superest. Et vulgatissima est haec numerandi
(...). And this is a common abuse of numbering, as Scaliger has observed. And
surely very frequent with Moses himself, for who can imagine that all the
Fathers lived precisely whole years, no months, nor days over or under? What
end is there then in so troubling the Chronology of the Church of God, and the
distracting the letter of his Word, when it is so easy to demonstrate, that
what the Scripture says, might lawfully be done, and probably also was so? And
if these things be so, how in the second place can it be said, that Noah began
to be a Father in the 500 year of his age? For if Shem were born to Noah in his
500 year, and Japhet were the Eldest Brother, as do rightly Translate Pagnin,
the LXX, and the Chald. Paraph. Genesis c. 10. v. 24. (rightly I say, for if Moses
had intended Shem for the Elder Brother, he would surely have said (...), and
not (...)) and Cham also the Younger Son, as for the most part he is said to
be, that is younger then Japhet, for Shem was the Youngest of all, which also
among many others, Josephus does confirm, Antiq. Jud. lib. 1. c. 7. Where he
calls Shem, (...), the Third son of Noah. And Schindler also, a man of no
vulgar judgment in holy matters, who says in his Pentagl. in the word (...),
that Cham was the second son of Noah, and Shem the youngest. How as I said
before, can Noah be said to have began to be a Father in the 500 year of his
age, when it appears so manifestly that Japhet and Cham must be born before?
Neither is it credible, at least not probable, that he began not to be a
Father, till his age began to decrease, and that he was made a Preacher of
righteousness unto the perishing World; But it sounds much more likely, that he
began to be a Father about the same time that his Progenitors began also to
beget Sons, perhaps about the Hundredth and Eightieth year of his age, about
which time Methuselah begat Lamech, and Lamech begat Noah, or perhaps enlarging
the time, about the Two Hundredth or Three Hundredth year of his age. Neither, if
Noah had begun to be a Father in the 500 year of his age, and Shem were his
Third son, can it in any sense be said that Shem begat Arphaxad in the Hundredth
year of his age, two years or the second year after the Flood, but Three years
or in the third, unless we will say that all Three were born in the space of
Two years, which were a strange thing to affirm. But to return to the matter it
self. Their reasoning seems to me so far from reason, that I can by no means
rest satisfied in it. For, first, whereas they would have Abraham to be born in
the 130 year of Terah, has little probability in it. For why should Abraham
wonder so, as if his reason strove with his faith, that a child should be born
to him that was an Hundred years old, if he had been born to his Father in the
Hundredth and Thirtieth year of his age? But this objection they value not a
straw, (although it be indeed (...).) They tell you the wonder of the Patriarch
is not rightly understood. For he had a respect only to his wife, and not to
himself, when he spoke thus within him, It ceased to be with Sarah after the
manner of women, There was the wonder, as for Abraham, he had sons by a young
wife Thirty and Seven years afterward. Say they so? But how then will they
answer Paul, Romans c. 4. v. 12. (...), Non consideravit corpus suum jam
emortuum, And he considered not his own body being dead, and Heb. c. 11. v. 12.
(...), etc. Quocirca and ab uno orti sunt eoque emortuo, tanquam sidera coeli,
Therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead, as the stars of the
sky in multitude. Out of which places compared together Estius concludes, Satis
ex his liquere scripturam non solum in Sara ponere miraculum sed etiam in
Abraham. What to Musculus? Certe negari non potest ista verba Abrahami
exprimere quandam senilis and emortui corporis considerationem tam in Abrahamo
quam in Sara. What to Ambrose? Non dubito quod facias, ut and centum annorum
seni dones filium, and Naturae auctor Naturae metas relaxes. What to
Chrysostom? (...), Supra humanam naturam promissa; erat enim Patriarcha prae
senectute prope impotens and ad filiorum procreationem omnino inutilis. As to
his having of sons by his young wife 37 years after, Why should not the Author
of Nature enlarge the bounds of Nature? Why should not he by divine miracle
repair and restore the strength of him that was almost dead, and make him to
wax young again, whom he had foretold should be the Father of many Nations?
Secondly, It does not agree with reason, that Moses should leave the age of
Abraham, on which depends the whole Chronology of the Church of God, in such
uncertainty, that either we must fish it out or extort it by conjecture. They
are the words of Langius upon another matter but of the same nature, Quem
quaeso in finem haec a Mose proscripta sunt, nisi ut temporum constaret ratio?
Propter hoc ergo Moses tempora apposuit, ut veritas manifestior esset, To what
end were these things written of Moses, but that there might appear a clear
account of the times? For this reason therefore Moses set to the times, that
the truth of them might be the more manifest. But that the truth of them might
be the more manifest as to the Chronology of the Church of God, whose age I
beseech you ought to be more accurately certain, Abraham's, or Terah's? The
knowledge truly of the time of the Birth of Abraham was absolutely necessary,
but so was not the knowledge of the time of the death of Terah. How shall there
appear a certain account of times, if it depend wholly upon conjecture, and
that so improbable, most certainly disputable? But when you have the time of
Abraham's Birth, and of his departure out of Charran, you have a most sure
account of the times, in which you may safely rest. Thirdly, That Abraham was
not born in the Seventieth year of Terah, is against the most general opinion
of the Ancients, to whom some reverence is due. Whereof I shall produce some
Testimonies. The first shall be that I mentioned before out of Josephus, (...),
Thara 70 genuit Abrahamum, and a little after (...), Abrahamus vero habuit
fratres Nachorem and Haranem. From whence it manifestly appears what was the
Jews opinion in Josephus his time, whatsoever they have written of that matter
since, and that he thought it his business to determine the age of Abraham
certain separately by it self, being not at all solicitous for the age of Nahor
or Haran. There is another Testimony of the Patriarch Nicephorus before
Eusebius his time, (...), Thara septuagenarius genuit Abrahamum. Besides the
judgment of Eusebius himself frequent in his Chronicles, as also of the Latins,
as is to be collected out of August. de Civit. Dei lib. 16. c. 10, and 15. and
in Quest. super Genesim. Neither is the Testimony and judgment of that learned
Arab. Gregorius Abul Pharaiius in his Hist. dinast. to be despised. Tareh
filius Nahor. Natus est illi Abraham cum esset secundum utramque simul
sententiam 70 annorum, and ab hoc tempore convenit inter duos computos LXX and
Hebraeorum, Terah was the son of Nahor. To him was Abraham born when he was
according to both opinions jointly of the age of 70 years, and from this time
there is an agreement between the two accounts of the LXX and the Hebrews. And
this Testimony serves to show the general opinion of the world. But how can
there be said to be an agreement, if still they differ 60 years concerning the
time of the Birth of Abraham? For these reasons therefore and Testimonies I
cannot consent to the judgment of those that would have Abraham to be born in
the 130 year of Terah. What then remains? If Abraham were born to Terah
according to the letter of the Scripture in the 70 year of his age, and went
out of Charran after the death of his Father in the 75 year of his own age,
then must Terah die but 145 years old, for 70 and 75 make 145. And this is much
more agreeable to reason, then the Hebrew reading. For it can scarcely be
believed, that Terah should live 57 years longer then his Father Nahor, who
lived but 148, when now the age of man began to decrease, neither did any of
the succeeding Patriarchs ever attain that age, to wit, of 205 years, although
they all received the blessing and the Promises, whereas Terah is said to have
served other Gods, Jos. c. 24. v. 2. And if you will believe Suidas he was
himself (...), A maker of Images; neither does the Scripture say any thing
explicitly of his conversion. Though notwithstanding Charity and even reason it
self persuade us to believe that he did not persist in his Idolatry unto the
time of his death, because he went out of Vr of the Chaldees with Abraham to go
into the land of Chanaan, and abode together with him in Charran until the day
of his death. Yet notwithstanding I cannot think he deserved from God the
favor of an age so much longer then that of his Fathers, or of any of his
successors. And why may it not be lawful by the same license, whereby they deny
that Abraham was born in the 70 year of Terah according to the letter of the
Scripture and the opinion of the Ancients, for us to collect, and as
confidently to affirm, that Terah was but 145 years old when he died,
especially having for our more abundant credit a witness in Eusebius of more
then 1300 years Antiquity, the Samaritan Chronology. (...), Thara cum esset 70
annorum genuit Abrahamum and supervixit 75 usque ad 75 annum Abrahami, Terah
being 70 years of age begat Abraham and lived after 75 years until the 75 of
Abraham. And with this does the Samaritan Pentateuch perfectly agree, Genesis c.
11. v. 32. And the days of Terah were 145 years, and Terah died in Haran, Et
fuerunt dies Tharae Centum and quadraginta quinque anni, postea mortuus est
Thara in Haran. And why should not this Samaritical witness be a witness of
good credit, especially in a matter that is of it self so probable? What danger
is there if we admit a fault or lapse in the Hebrew copy? We admit various
readings in it, and why should not this difference between the Samaritan and
the Hebrew be reputed a various or diverse reading? It was the opinion of
incomparable Capellus in his Sacred Critics, Diversitatem inter Cod. Heb. and
Samar. non alio referri videri quam ad variam quae inter describendum solet
accidere lectionem, That the diversity which is between the Hebrew and
Samaritan books, seems not to be referred to any other cause, then to the
various reading which does often happen in the copying of them. Nay, if I
mistake not, we meet with as gross a fault (if it be lawful to say so) and not
less to be observed, and that likewise in point of number, Genesis c. 2. v. 2.
Complevitque deus (...) in die septimo opus suum quod secerat, And on the
seventh day God finished the work which he had made. And who is so tenacious of
the Jewish Masora who will not acknowledge an error or mistake in this place,
and confess it ought to be read, Et perfecit Deus (...) in die Sexto opus suum
quod fecerat, and requievit in die Septimo ab omni opere suo quod fecerat, And
in the Sixth day God finished the work which he had made, and he rested (as it
follows) on the Seventh day from all his work which he had made. As the
Samaritan, the Syriack and all the Greek Interpreters do read? If then it be
equal to mend the reading in this place, why should it not be lawful to mend it
in the age of Terah, the sense requiring an emendation in both places? They are
the words of the same Capellus, Non pauca esse (...) quae vix alia ratione
solvi aut conciliari possunt quam admittendo levem in sacro codice lapsum
emendandum, That there are not a few irreconcilable doubts in the Scripture,
which are scarce by any other means to be solved or reconciled, then by
admitting some light fault to be amended in the holy Bible. Which why it should
not be done here in this very place of the age of Terah, when as the Samaritan
reading does so hansomly reconcile Stephen with Moses, and Moses with himself,
I see one only obstacle, which also that incomparable man observed, Religio est
vel latum pilum a codicibus Hebraeis ut Rabbinorum cura nobis transmittuntur
recedere vel ipsorum lectionem vitii arguere, We count it a scruple of
conscience to depart but a hairs breadth from the Hebrew Copies as they are
transmitted to us by the care of the Rabbis [our professed enemies] or to find
the least fault with their reading. And if we be so resolved, the best way is,
with Scaliger, to leave this knot to be untied till Elias comes.

V. 15, 16. (...), Et descendit Jacob in Aegyptum and defunctus est ipse and
patres nostri, and translati sunt in Sichem, and positi sunt in sepulchro quod
emit Abraham pretio argenti a filiis Emmor Patris Sichem, So Jacob went down
into Egypt, and died he and our Fathers, and were carried over into Sichem,
and laid in the sepulcher which Abraham had bought for a sum of money of the
sons of Emmor the Father of Sichem. This Translation makes this place subject
to many mistakes and difficulties out of which we are not yet fairly delivered.
For first it implies by the connection of the conjunction copulative, that Jacob
as well as the Fathers were carried over into Sichem, etc. Whereas Jacob was
buried long before the coming up out of Egypt by Joseph and the Elders of
Israel, in the cave of the field of Macpelah which Abraham bought of Ephron the
Hittite, Genesis c. 50. v. 13. Next it avoweth a positive contradiction to the
letter of the Old Testament, in saying that Abraham bought a burying place of
the Sons of Emmor the Father of Sichem, when as that which he bought was of
Ephron the Hittite, and Jacob the purchaser of the Sons of Emmor. Lastly it
necessarily implies that the Fathers were buried in Sichem, whereas in all
reason and probability they were buried in the same place where their Fathers
were, to wit, in Hebron. For as I said before Jacob was surely buried in the
cave of the field of Macpelah which Abraham bought with the field for a
possession for a burying place (questionless for his Family) of Ephron the
Hittite, Genesis c. 49. v. 30. As he swear his son Joseph to bury him in the
burying place of his Fathers, Genesis c. 47. v 30. Where they buried Abraham and
Sarah his wife, where they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife, and where he
buried Leah, Genesis c. 49. v. 31. And where Jacob and Leah were both buried, (and
their Fathers and Mothers also) its more then probable, that all their Family
was also buried, Joseph being only buried in Sichem (and probably his Family,)
according to the oath which he took of the Children of Israel, Genesis c. 50. v.
25. In a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of Emmor and gave his son Joseph
for a portion above his Brethren, and which afterward became the inheritance
of his Children, Jos. c. 24. v. 32. And to this conjecture, if it be not more,
there is nothing to object (besides this place which I shall endeavor to
reconcile) but the testimony of St Hierome who in his Epitaph upon Paula says,
that the brothers of Joseph were buried in Sichem. But with reverence to so
great a Father, I suppose I may without offense oppose to his the Testimony of
Josephus, who in his second book of Jewish Antiquities expressly says, (...)
etc. And the bodies of these, that is, of the brethren of Joseph, were carried
back by their Children and Grandchildren and buried in Hebron, But Joseph's
bones were carried by the Hebrews into Chanaan when they departed out of
Egypt, as he had bound them by an oath, Gen c. 50. v. 25. Exodus c. 13. v. 19.
According to which they were buried in Sichem, Jos. c. 24. v. 32. Neither was
this at all abhorring from reason or duty, that they should first bury the
bones of Joseph in Sichem, for honors sake, he having been the President of
Egypt, and from thence carry over the bones of the rest of the Fathers to be
buried in Hebron. And truly if we weigh the Testimonies, I know not why
Josephus may not be credited in a matter of Story which concerns his own
Nation, also of whom he writ of purpose, especially coming nearest to reason
and the sense of Scripture. To rectify therefore the first possible mistake, I
would have it rendered thus, Et descendit Jacob in Aegyptum, and defunctus est
ipse, and Patres nostri, (...), and ipsi translati sunt in Sichem,
understanding (...), or qui translati sunt, as Beza interprets (...), Act. c.
6. v. 6. and elsewhere. Whereof you may see examples in note on Matthew. c. 27.
v. 9, 10. and on Joh. c. 15. v. 6. So Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died,
and our Fathers, and they were carried, or who were carried over into Sichem.
That is, our Fathers and not Jacob. And to reconcile the two latter
difficulties, I would have it Translated and pointed thus, (...), Et ipsi, or
Qui translati sunt in Sichem, and positi in sepulchro (quod emerat Abraham
pretio argenti) a filiis Emmor Patris Sichem, And they, or Who were carried
over into Sichem, and laid in the sepulcher (which Abraham had bought with a
price of money) from the sons of Emmor the Father of Sichem. That is by a
frequent metathesis, And they were carried over into Sichem, and from the sons
of Emmor the Father of Sichem, or from Sichem, which in effect is all one, they
were laid in the Sepulchere which Abraham had bought with a price of money. And
by this Translation, which in its self is lawful, as to the Grammar or use of
speech, there is no violence at all to the truth of the History, for hereby it
is not affirmed that they were laid in the sepulcher, which Abraham had bought
of the sons of Emmor, which does so grossly contradict the letter of the Old
Testament, or that they were buried all in Sichem, it implying quite otherwise
that from Sichem they were laid in the sepulcher which Abraham had bought with
a price of money, to wit in Hebron according to the saying of Josephus,
probability of reason and sense of Scripture. Neither is this Translation
forced at all. For (...) does as well nay more properly signify, From, then,
Of, for it properly signifies motum a persona, the motion from a person, nay
sometimes from things inanimate, as (...), from the ships, in Homer; so as I
know not why if need were it might not by a familiar transposition be rendered
thus, (...), From Sichem that is (...), from the field of Sichem, as it is
called in the Old Testament, which was the sons of Emmor. Neither am I
altogether without a witness, Learned De Dieu agrees with us, when he says
(...) non esse construendum cum (...) sed cum (...), which opinion he thought
was the best because of the Authority of Josephus.

V. 19. (...). These words under favor are not aptly Translated by any
Interpreter that I ever yet read. For I cannot be persuaded that the Hebrews
could possibly be so barbarous and inhumane, though forced with never so much
cruelty, as to cast forth their own Infants to the end they might not live, as
the Translations do generally imply. Neither does Moses tell us of any such
thing in Exodus, but that Pharaoh commanded his own people (the Hebrew Midwives
refusing to execute his commands because they feared God) expressly in these
words, Every Son that is born to the Hebrews ye shall cast into the river,
Exodus c. 1 v. 22. So that to bring these words to a more proper and truer
sense, I conceive they may be more rightly Translated, and that without force
in this manner, Hic circumveniens genus nostrum, afflixit Patres nostros
faciendo projici infantes eorum, ne servarentur vivi, The same dealing subtly
with our kindred, evilly entreated our Fathers by causing their children to be
cast forth, to the end that they might not live. (...) with Suidas, (...),
projecta, exposed or cast forth, (...), is all one with (...) and may by good
Authority be Translated, faciendo projici, by causing to be cast forth. You may
read the same phrase purely in the same sense, 1 King. c. 17. v. 20. (...), Tu
afflixisti viduam faciendo mori filium ejus, or as the Latin Interpreter of the
LXX, interficiendo filium ejus, or as our late Interpreter, mortem afferendo
filio ejus, Thou have also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn by
slaying of her son. The like you have in Ruth c. 1. v. 6. (...), Quod
visitaverat dominus populum ejus dando eis panem. As Pagnin rightly renders it.
That the Lord had visited his people by giving them bread. And Psalm. 78. v. 18.
(...), Et tentarunt deum in cord suo petendo cibum, etc. And they tempted God
in their hearts by asking meat for their lusts.

V. 30. (...). Et expletis annis quadraginta, And when Forty years were
expired. That is, From the time that Moses was said to be full Forty years old,
v. 23. for now he was Fourscore, when the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him
in the bush. v. 35. (...), By the hand of the Angel which appeared unto him in
the bush. But that Angel was God himself, Exodus c. 3. v. 6, and 13. and so
beneath, v. 38. (...), Who was with the Angel who spoke to him in mount Sina.
But that Angel is several times called God, Exodus c. 19. and so again it
follows, v. 53. (...), Who have received the law by the disposition of Angels,
the same with that, Gal. c. 3. v. 19. (...), The Law was ordained by Angels.
When yet it is expressly said, Exodus c. 20. v. 1. Et locutus est Elohim, And God
spoke these words and said. So also it is said, Genesis c. 48. v. 15. (...), etc.
(...), etc. The God of Abraham and Isaac, the God which did feed me all my life
long unto this day, the Angel, which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads.
And Judge. c. 13. v. 21, 22. Manoah calls the Angel of God, God, for he knew
that he was an Angel of God, and yet immediately says, we shall surely die
because we have seen God. So Luke c. 2. v. 9. The Angel of the Lord came upon
them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, that is of the Angel of
the Lord. From which examples it is manifest, That it is no strange thing, to
have that ascribed unto Angels, which God does by their ministry, and that
sometimes Angels are called by the name of God, and God, sometime by the name
of an Angel. The reason is because all the outward works of God are done by the
ministry of Angels. For God cannot properly be said to have a mouth or hands or
feet, to speak or go before, or to appear. With or by his will he does all
things, putting it in execution by his ministering spirits, who are his
intermediate Messengers and Actors. Which very order is observed also by
earthly Princes, who for the most part execute all public matters by their
Ministers.

V. 45. (...), Quod etiam introduxerunt Patres nostri accipientes successive
alius ab alio cum Jesu in possessionem Gentium, Which also our Fathers
receiving successively one from another brought in with Jesus into the
possession of the Gentiles. (...), Phav.

C. 10. v. 36, 37, 38. (...), etc. (...) is here to be taken (...), or
appositively. Before (...) I conceive with the Syriack Interpreter you are to
understand (...), then which nothing is more frequent. Verbum quod misit filiis
Israel annuncians pacem per Jesum Christum (hic est omnium dominus) vos nostis,
verbum scilicet quod fuit per totam Judaeam, initium sumens a Galilaea post
baptisma quod praedicavit Johannes de Jesu Nazareno, quomodo unxerit eum Deus
spiritu sancto, etc. The word which he sent to the children of Israel preaching
peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all) ye know, to wit, the word which
was through all Judaea beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John
preached, concerning Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the holy
Ghost, etc. Ye know, that is, ye have heard of, ye cannot be ignorant of a
discourse or talk that has been so common through all Judaea, how the holy
Ghost descended upon him when he was baptized of John in the River Jordan, and
how afterward he went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of
the devil.

C. 13. v. 20. (...), etc. And after that he gave them Judges the space of 450
years until Samuel the Prophet. This place, says Scaliger, is crux
Chronologorum. The truth is, Interpreters also have not been a little vexed
with it. Among whom there are not few, who maintain this reading and
interpretation, which our English here have used. And this is very plausibly
made good by Beroaldus Chron. lib. 3. c. 4. by adding in his computation the
years of the Oppressers to the number of those of the Judges, which beginning
from the time that Cushanrishathaim began to oppress Israel, Judge. c. 3. v. 8.
do make up the just number of 450 years until Samuel. But besides the just
exceptions which may be taken to this account, as that the time of the Elders
who judged Israel immediately after Joshua is not mentioned nor comprised in
it, who cannot be denied to have been Judges, though how long, it is not
evident in Scripture. Eusebius says, Tradition gave them 18 years, Africanus
allowed them 30, but how long or short so ever, it adds to the account of 450
years, so that the number cannot be so precise as he would have it: And besides
that the 20 years of Sampson, in which he Judged Israel in the days of the
Philistines, into whose hands God gave the Israelites the space of 40 years, are
to be deducted out of those days, which must necessarily make the account not
to be so exact. Beroaldus has made himself an unanswerable objection. And that
is this. Putting or supposing that the time from the coming out of Egypt to
the building of the Temple may not be questioned to be other then 480 years, as
it is punctually set down, 1 King. c. 6. v. 1. which account himself and Beza
do both maintain is precisely to be observed, if we allow 450 years to the
Judges, adding 40 to Moses in the wilderness, 18 to Joshua, (and none allow him
fewer) 40 to Samuel and Saul, 30 to David, and 4 to Solomon before the
beginning of the building of the Temple, the whole will be (not reckoning the
Elders) 582 years, so as observing his own rule, it is impossible that 450
years can be allowed to the times of the Judges. It Is true he tells you, That it
is to be noted for the better understanding of the Apostle, That some years are
repeated twice, as the years of the Israelites oppression are said to be
comprehended in and referred to that sum of years, in which its said there was
peace, and that the land had rest from war. Whereof the Apostle being not at
all solicitous, did nominate that sum, which all the several sums [of Judges
and Oppressors] made up together. But that the Apostle had these
considerations, the times of the Elders and the 20 years of Sampson making also
the account so imperfect and uncertain, or that he had none at all, is not
probable. Neither is it credible, that against the light of his own and common
knowledge he would have mentioned a sum of years which was not reconcilable
with the letter of holy Scripture. For that had been an egregious scandal to
the Jews. who were neither ignorant, nor inobservant of the computation of the
Times. This reading and interpretation therefore being subject to so just
exceptions, I suppose we may without injury inquire into some other, and truly
I meet with none less liable to exception then that of those, who would not
have it here meant, how long God gave them Judges, but when he gave them, and
for that cause distinguish and refer those words, (...), to the words going
before, v. 17. that is to the time when the God of the children of Israel chose
their Fathers, so as the words ought to be pointed, and rendered otherwise then
commonly they are in most Translations, in English thus, And afterward about
450 years, that is by a familiar Metathesis, (...), etc. And about 450 years
afterward he gave them Judges, etc. according to which sense read the Old
Latin and the Aethiopick Interpreters. Now this time wherein God may properly
be said to have chosen their Fathers, about 450 years before he gave them
Judges, is by them computed from the Birth of Isaac, in whom God may properly
be said to have chosen their Fathers. For God who had chosen Abraham out of all
the people of the earth, out of the children of Abraham at this time chose
Isaac, in whose Family the Covenant was to rest. And to make this computation
evident; From the Birth of Isaac they say, to the Birth of Jacob are 60 years,
from thence to their going into Egypt 130, from thence to their coming out
210, from thence to their entrance into the land of Canaan 40, and from thence
to the division of the Land, the time wherein it had rest, about which time its
probable they began to settle their Government by Judges, 7 years, which
altogether make up 447. And if it should be reckoned from the year before when
God established his Covenant between himself and Abraham and Isaac, even before
he was born, and all his seed after him, Genesis c. 17. v. 19. at which time God
may be said as properly to have chosen their Fathers if not more, then it will
be 448 years, which comes one year nearer to our number of 450. But our Learned
and Judicious Usher makes it from the Birth of Isaac to the division of the
Land (which he says was about 450 years after the election of the Fathers) 452
years. And others almost if not just 450. From whence we may conjecture that by
reason of this uncertainty of computation, The Apostle did express the
circumstance of the time with an (...), a circiter, an about 450 years. So as
Scaliger says, it was very wisely said of Eusebius, (...), etc. That the
Apostle spoke not according to exact account, but with a common exception, that
is, so as it be a number according to ordinary speaking, whereby we pronounce
any sum totally, but not exactly. So with Demosthenes and Plautus we see that
called a Talent, where notwithstanding some dramms are wanting or abounding.
And this, says he, is vulgatissima numerandi (...), as was mentioned before.

V. 27. (...). The English Translator has expressed the sense, but not
Translated strictly to the words, which by reason of the Synchysis, and
involved and perplexed trajection being not well distinguished, are not for the
most part so rightly rendered as they ought. And from hence it is, as Heinsius
has observed, that the force and emphasis of the reprehension is quite lost,
by which the Apostle most elegantly seems to reprove the blind ignorance and
stupidity of the Jews, who when they pored altogether on the Scriptures, did
yet do the very same thing of which they were in them forewarned, that is, they
went about to take him away who in them was to the Eye pointed out their
Messiah, the very Person whom they expected. The words therefore may in my
opinion be more lively rendered, as they are before distinguished, Thus, Qui
enim habitabant in Jerusalem, and principes eorum, hunc condemnantes,
ignorantes etiam voces Prophetarum quae unoquoque legebantur Sabbato
impleverunt, For they which dwelt in Jerusalem, and their Rulers, condemning
him, not understanding even the voices of the Prophets which were read every
Sabbath, fulfilled them. That is, by condemning of Jesus, they fulfilled the
Scriptures although they were duly read unto them every Sabbath. The like
implicit and perplexed trajections you may find in Demosthenes, whom Stephanus
affirms to have used them. Ad venustutem sermoni conciliandam, To gain a grace
unto his speech. And in Plato, such as is that in his Phaedras, (...), Vera,
inquit, dicis, Socrates, O Cebes. For, (...), Vera dicis O Cebes, inquit
Socrates. Which kind of speech Cicero seems to have imitated and affected. As,
Noli, inquit, mirari, Africanus. And O magnam, inquit, artem, Brutus. See Beza
his Exposition upon Act. c. 24. v. 22. and Joh. c. 13. v. 8. (...), Nunquam
lavabis pedes meos. See also Luke c. 8. v. 14. 1 Cor. c. 10. v. 27. Philp. c.
1. v. 21. (...), Mihi enim Christus est in vita, and in morte lucrum,
understanding (...) before (...), and (...). See James also, c. 2. v. 1. c. 3.
v. 3. and Pet. 1 Ep. c. 3. v. 21. and 2 Ep. c. 1. v. 19.

V. 41. (...), etc. The Apostle cites neither Greek nor Hebrew strictly, but
comes nearest to the Greek, whom saving the sense he has contracted, For with
them Habak. c. 1. v. 5. it is read, (...), but in the Hebrew, (...) Videte
intergentes and aspicite, and obstupescite, obstupescite, as some Translate it,
one and the same word being twice repeated. But the LXX whose custom it is to
render one and the same word diversely according to the possible diversity of
the points or letters, after they had according to the common reading rendered
the words suitably, (...), supposing the ingemination of the Hebrew meant some
intenceness in the act, as if you should say, mire miremini, be ye wonderfully
astonished, suspecting still the word (...), might possibly and ought to be read
(...) rather then the other word twice, the mistake also being so easy by
reason of the likeness of the letters, especially if blurred or blotted, or any
corner of a letter at all omitted in the copy, added likewise (...), which
aptly suites with (...), that signifies, (...), latibulum quaerite, or
tegimini, seek ye a hiding place, or hide your selves. In which sense you may
see it Translated, Psalm. 60. v. 4. and Isai. c 30. v. 2. And so (...) with
Hesychius is (...), tegere or abscondere, to hide or cover. So Plut. de Pyth.
Orac. (...), Non vult abscondere veritatem, He will not conceal or hide the
truth. And elsewhere, (...), Cervi quando decidit cornu defodiunt and
abscondunt in terra, Stags when their Horns fall off dig and hide them in the
earth. So Job c. 22. v. 20. the word (...) which signifies to hide, the LXX
render (...). And in this sense this word may possibly be more aptly and more
significantly rendered here, Videte Contemptores, and obstupescite and
adscondimini, Behold ye Despisers, and be amazed, and hide your selves, or seek
ye hiding places. And that this may be so, I believe the rather because of the
similitude of the Hebrew Characters, which makes them so prone to be mistaken,
and that we may almost infallibly conclude the same has happened in another
word in this very place of Habak. where instead of (...), as it is now read in
the Hebrew, and accordingly Translated, inter gentes, among the nations, the
Greek Interpreters did surely read (...) and accordingly Translated, (...),
Contemptores, Despisers. And so they frequently Translate the same word, as
Prove. c. 13. v. 16. (...), (...), Viae contemnentium in perditione, The way of
Despisers is in destruction. Zeph. c. 3. v. 4. (...), Prophetae ejus portantes
spiritum, viri contemptores, Her Prophets carry the spirit, men that are
despisers. You shall find the same word in this very chapter of Habak. v. 13.
And in truth these words seem not to be spoken to the Gentiles, but to the
Jews, whom alone the Prophets immediate discourse did totally concern, upon
whom even in their days was to come that great devastation of the Babylonish
Captivity, of which he here surely Prophesied (and not against Nebuchadnessar
and the Chaldeans, as Expositors do generally conclude, led thereunto by the
misreading of these very words (...) inter Gentes.) For it is the common
opinion Habakkuk prophesied in the days of Manasseh, and it suits well with the
matter of his Prophecy and the circumstance of time, For in Manasseh his days
for the abominable wickedness which was committed in the same did the Lord
speak by his Prophet saying, Behold I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and
Judah that whosoever hears of it both his ears shall tingle, and I will
forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hands of
their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies, 2
King. c. 21. v. 12, 14. The very subject matter of our Prophets prophecy, so
that Habakkuk might probably enough be that very Prophet, who here comes with
an Ecce to them, because they perverted judgment, despised the Law of God and
were full of violence, (...), etc. Behold ye despisers and be amazed, and hide
your selves, for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe,
though it be told you, For Lo, I will raise up the Chaldaeans, etc. and they
shall gather the captivity as the sand, v. 9. So as without question this
denuntiation of the Prophet was here directed to the Jews, whom he here calls
(...), despisers, that they should behold and with astonishment admire the work
of the Lord which he was to do in their days, so as for very amazement and
consternation they should seek to hide themselves, and wish the very hills
would come down and cover them from the dreadful wrath which was to come. And
least this fate should now come again upon the Jews, the Apostle bids them in
this place beware, in the foregoing verse, foresignifying the fearful
Destruction of Jerusalem, then near at hand.

V. 48. (...), Et crediderunt quotquot erant praeordinati ad vitam aeternam, as
the Old Latin: Ordinati, as Beza, but in the same sense as we Translate it
also. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. But this is but a
harsh and unusual version of (...), the word (...) or (...) being no where to
be found in that sense, neither does it agree with the sense of Scripture, as
many are of opinion. And truly I for my part doubt whether all that then
believed were praeordained to eternal life [might there not be some Apostates?]
I am sure there is nothing to oblige my faith thereto, I conceive no more then
those which in Corinth are called Saints, who surely believed also, otherwise
the Apostle would never have called them Saints, neither had they been reputed
part of the Church which was in Corinth, who I suppose there is no man will
affirm, were all saved, as are in their sense, those who were preordained to
eternal life. That therefore this place may bring no weight to the establishing
of so controverted a sense, of which there will never be an end of disputing
till Elias comes, why may not these words be better distinguished and
Translated, thus? (...), Et crediderunt, quotquot convenerunt, in vitam
aeternam, And as many as were met together, believed in eternal life. The Jews
held themselves unworthy of eternal life, by putting the word of God from them,
v. 46. But the Gentiles when they heard it, they were glad and glorified the
word of the Lord, and as many as were met together believed in eternal life.
(...) being taken in the same sense with (...), which word was used, v. 44.
(...), is one of the articles of our Creed, the very subject of the Apostles
preaching, Joh. c. 17. v. 3. And as for the interpretation of (...), as it is
not unsuitable to the place, no more is it new without Authority. For the
Hebrew (...), which is frequently by the LXX Translated, (...), and (...),
convenio, and congrego, is also by them Translated, (...), Exodus c. 29. v. 43.
(...), Et conveniam ibi filiis Israel, Pagnin. And there I will meet with the
children of Israel, as in our own Translation. And though some perhaps may say
that this was a mistake in the Seventy Interpreters, which yet is but spoken of
free cost, for Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotio Translated so likewise, or that
they meant [ praecipiam] as their Latin Interpreter would have it, certainly
the genuine sense of (...) has in it something near of kin to our
Interpretation. For (...) is properly (...), in ordine colloco, to place in
order, so as it aborreth not from our sense to say, And as many as were placed
in order, [to hear the word of God] believed in eternal life, or as many as
were instructed, according to the force of the word, praecipiam, that is, as
many as were instructed in what the Apostle taught them. Nor can I be otherwise
persuaded, but that (...), must necessarily be construed with (...), what sense
soever is put upon (...).

C. 14. v. 23. (...), etc. That is, as some, (...), And when they had appointed
them Elders, or as others, When they had ordained them Elders, in the
Ecclesiastical sense as it is at this day used. But which of these two is the
truer or more proper in this place, is no small question. If I may speak with
liberty, after a serious disquisition, I cannot but profess, I totally assent
to them who would have Luke here mean (...), having appointed, and not
Ordained, in the other sense. For I am not convinced with Argument or
Testimony, so as to believe, that (...) did by it self alone at that time, or
many years after signify either (...), Imposition of hands, or (...),
Consecration. So that all which Zonaras affirms concerning the true acception
of this word in the beginning of his Scholia upon the first Canon of the
Apostles, (to what end or by what impulse soever) I think is very really right
and true. Whose words, because they fully express my meaning, and that they may
be better understood by other Authorities, which I shall allege, I have
thought fit here to set down. (...), etc. Now adays a course of prayers, and
invocation on the holy Spirit, when one is initiated into the Priesthood, and
receives consecration, is called Cheirotonia, from thence so termed, because
the Bishop extends his hand over him whom he blesses, when he is chosen into
holy orders, But Anciently the choice or suffrage was called Cheirotonia, For
when it was lawful for the multitude in their Cities to choose their Priests or
Bishops, the multitude met together, and some chose one man, some another, but
that it might appear, whose suffrage won, they say the Electors did use (...),
to stretch forth their hands, and by their hands so stretched forth or up, they
were numbered who chose the one and who the other. And him who was Elected by
the most suffrages or voices, they placed in the high Priesthood, that is, made
him Bishop. And from hence was the name of Chierotonia taken, which also the
Fathers of the Councils are found so to have used, calling their suffrage,
Cheirotonia. An example whereof he brings out of the fifth Canon of the
Council of Laodicea. And thus far Zovaras. From whom it manifestly appears,
that the word Cheirotonia in the Ecclesiastical sense, as it is now used of
Ordination, was then new and borrowed long after the Apostles times. And to
prove this yet more fully, laying aside and barring all suspected and
questionable Authorities, let us do it with such Testimonies of Primitive
writers, whose Authority is sound and received of all. Beginning first with
Paul himself, 2 Cor. c. 8. v. 19. Where the brother whose praise is in the
Gospel, and that was questionless St Luke, is said to be (...), appointed by
the Churches, a companion to travel with St Paul. And I cannot think that any
man will soberly and seriously affirm, that he was ordained by the Churches in
the sense of Ordination as it is now understood, by Invocation, Imposition of
hands, and Consecration. And from him let us descend to the next Writers who
are universally counted genuine. In which rank in the first place is Ignatius
in his Epistle to the Philadelphians, where you have these words, (...), Ye
ought as a Church of God to choose or appoint a Bishop, to wit, for or to the
Church of Antioch in Syria. Where I suppose likewise no body can soberly say
that the Bishops are there understood, as if he had written to the Church
Representative, when he writes indefinitely to all the Philadelphians, whom he
calls collectively the Church, and to whom he gives particular instructions,
not proper to the Bishops if alone. And from him let us come to the
Ecclesiastical Historians, Among whom for the most part, if not altogether the
words (...), and (...) do signify or import election or constitution, to
choose or to appoint. Nay in some places it must be necessarily Translated, and
I believe it may be lawfully so in all. So we read, Eusebius. Hist. Eccles. lib 6.
c. 29. (...), All the brethren being gathered togetber in the Church for the
election of a Bishop. So Socrat. lib. 2. c. 6. Alexander the Bishop of
Constantinople is said to have died, (...), not having appointed any body in
his place. And c. 26. (...), etc. There was a great contention about the
election of a Bishop, some desiring one and some another. So Theodoret. lib. 4.
c. 6. (...), I gave a voice with others to thy election. There are many more
examples in the same Authors to the same purpose, as in Zozomen, also, lib. 3.
c. 7. and elsewhere, and in Evagr. lib. 3. c. 13. Pergamius is said to be
(...), Appointed President of Egypt. And so we have in Philo. in leg. ad
Caium. (...), To those who were appointed Governors of Provinces. Not to speak
of Profane Authors, among whom Maximus Tyrius has a notable example of Darius
his wanton Horse, who (...), chose his Master to be King. So that as far as I
can collect from the Testimonies of the Ancient, (...) with them did signify
to elect or to appoint. It Is true, we find the word in the other sense of
Ordination, in several Books which pretend to great Antiquity, as in the Canons
of the Apostles, the Constitutions of Clemens, and Respons. ad Orthodoxos,
which passes under the name of Justin Martyr, but there being just cause of
suspicion among the Learned of the Authors and Antiquities of every one of
them, it is not reasonable that their suspected Authority should impose a law
for the use of a word, on the Testimony of others whose truth or credit was
never yet called in question. I shall only add an argument or two. It is not
likely that Luke whom all acknowledge skilful in the language of the Greeks,
would use a word in a sense not known unto them, nor possible to be known
Neither is it probable that none of the Ancient Lexicographers should make any
mention at all of any such sense as is that of Zonaras his Ordination, with
Invocation of the spirit and Imposition of hands, who generally say (...).
Being therefore convinced with these Testimonies and arguments I cannot but
believe, that in Ancient times (...) did signify no more then to elect or
appoint, and consequently that (...) in this place denotes no more then the
bare appointing of Elders by Paul and Barnabas, and not Imposition of hands or
Consecration, or, which we call now a days, Ordination. The first notion of
that sense in express words in an approved Author is in Hierome upon Isaiah c.
58. where he says (...) esse ordinationem clericorum, quae non solum ad
imprecationem vocis sed ad impositionem impletur manus, That Cheirotonia was
the Ordination of Clerks, which is accomplished not only by the prayer of the
voice, but also by the Imposition of hands. Which acception of the word in that
sense seems first about those times to have been taken notice of, about those
days when sundry tumults happening between the people themselves, and the
people and the Clergy about the choice of Bishops, the people by the decree of
the Bishops were prudently excluded from having or giving any voice any more in
election of their Bishop. But the word (...) remained still, being by them
assumed, and in tract of time substituted and accomodated to their use in the
sense of Consecration, or as we now call it, Ordination. In sum least any
should wrest my meaning, I have only to do with those, who would have (...) in
this individual place properly and by it self to signify (...), that is solemn
Ordination, by prayer, fasting and Imposition of hands. This only I deny (...)
to signify in this place. That these Elders whom the Apostles had chosen or
appointed in several distant places were all consecrated with prayer and
fasting in the several places where they were chosen, I do not deny but verily
believe. Though these words in this place do not evince so much, as some have
thought, who by (...) of blessed St Chrysostom, do not imprudently or
incogitantly refer the prayers and fasting to the valediction of Paul and
Barnabas, and not to the constitution or appointing of Elders, as if that were
only mentioned by the by, and that the sense should be according to the right
construction, Thus, (...), Et cum constituissent illis per singulas ecclesias
presbyteros, precati cum jejunio commendarunt eos domino, And when they had
appointed them Elders in every Church, having prayed with fasting they
commended them to the Lord on whom they believed. As if the prayers and fasting
belonged to the farewell of the Apostles. Neither was such a farewell at all
incongruous or unusual. Act. c. 20. v. 36. Paul being to take leave of the
Ephesians, prayed with them all, and c. 21. v. 5. taking leave of the disciples
in Tire, he prayed with them kneeling on the shore. If they did also sometime
at parting fast, it is a thing probable enough in a business which always was
so solemn. Neither could the Ordination of Elders with prayers and fasting in
every Church at Derbe, Lystra, Antioch and Iconium possibly be the work of one
day and time, as is necessarily implied, if immediately after the Ordination,
the Apostles commended them to the Lord and took their leaves, and so departed.

C. 15. v. 10. (...), etc. Nunc ergo quid tentatis Deum imponendo jugum cervici
discipulorum? Now therefore why tempt ye God by putting a yoke on the necks of
the disciples? The same manner of speech as is, (...), Act. c. 7. v. 19.

V. 14. (...), Symeon narravit quomodo Deus primo visitaverat, sumendo ex
gentibus populum nomini suo, Simeon has declared how God at the first did
visit them, by taking out of the Gentiles a people for his name. You must
understand after (...), them, that is the Gentiles mentioned, v. 7. (...) is
the same phrase with that immediately before. It is an elleiptical kind of
speech, and is to be supplied with some Praeposition and the article (...) as
is most congruous to the sense, sometimes (...) sometimes (...), as Act. c. 27.
v. 1. (...), etc. That is (...), Vt autem decretum est de navigatione nostra in
Italiam. Or the like.

C. 16 v. 13. (...), Ubi domus orationis lege sancita est esse, Where a house
of prayer was by the law appointed to be. For (...) is properly, lege sancio.
As for (...) it signifies in all probability in this place, an oratory, or
place of prayer, as the Syriack and Arabic both interpret it, which was
allowed it seems by the Magistrates of Phillippi to the Jews that dwelt
thereabout for the exercise of their devotions. So Josephus who was not long
after Luke, if not contempo^ary with him, calls (...), in his life, (...), A
great room capable to receive a multitude of people, wherein they used to pray
as is evident by the History. So you read in Philo against Flaccus, that the
people of Alexandria cried out with one consent that the Images of Caesar were
to be set up (...), in the Oratories of the Jews: and in his Embassadge to
Caius, that the people being gathered together in great multitudes (...), of
the Jewish Oratories cut down some, demolish't others, and others burned, and
(...), as many Oratories as they could not burn, they vex't another way, by
setting up in them the Statues of Caius. And indeed the word is familiar with
him in this sense.

C. 17. v. 15. (...), Qui curam habebant Pauli, But they who had the care of
Paul. (...), Phavor. or Qui disponebant Paulum, (...), dispono, Gloss. Vet.

C. 18. v. 5. (...), Constringebatur spiritu, i. e. Intus apud se aestuabat
prae zeli ardore, Beza. But its nearer to the letter, to say, Tenebatur animo
testificari Judaeis Jesum esse ipsum Christum, Paul was earnestly minded to
testife unto the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. As (...), and (...) in
Chrysostom, and teneri desiderio and teneri metu with the Latins, (...), for
(...). The Particle is put for the Infinitive with words signifying any
affection of the mind.

C. 19. v. 9. (...). So reads Rob. Steph. and (...), with a great letter, as
others. In Schola alicujis civitatis principis, Disputing daily in the school
of one of the Rulers of the city. (...), Princeps Civitatis, Phavor. And in
this sense the Aethiop. and Arab. Interpreters seem to have understood it. The
word is often used by the Chald. Paraph. Jos. c. 13. v. 3. and Judge. c. 16. in
several places, instead of the Hebrew, (...), which the LXX render (...),
reading (...). We have the same very word likewise in the LXX, Dan. c. 3. v. 2.
Esth. c. 9. v. 3. Habak. c. 1. v. 10. Neither if it were a proper name, is the
word (...), proper to be added. Si nomen est proprium cur addit (...), Eras.
Yet see Zeger. and Grot.

V. 21. (...), etc. Paul resolved in his mind passing through Macedonia and
Achaia to go to Jerusalem, (...), Statui dicere, I was resolved to speak.
Aelian, de Animal. lib. 2. c. 11. (...) is sometimes animus, as Ezekiel. c. 20. v.
32. (...), And if this come into your mind. So c. 20. v. 22. (...), Et ecce ego
nunc obstrictus animo proficiscor in Jerusalem, And behold I am now bound in my
mind to go unto Jerusalem, that is, I am thoroughly resolved to go unto
Jerusalem, though I know not the things that shall befall me there.

C. 20. v. 8. (...), In the upper Chamber, In caenaculo, In the Room wherein
they usually supped. In the Hebrew (...). From the verb (...), Ascendit. So
(...) with Schindler is Superior pars domus, etc. The upper part of the house
unto which they went by stairs, in which Anciently they were wont to sup,
(...). And so it is frequently Translated in the Old Testament by the Greek
Interpreters, and caenaculum by the Latins, Caenacula dicuntur ad quae scalis
ascenditur, Fest.

C. 21. v. 16. (...). You must necessarily understand (...) or (...) to agree
with (...) and (...). Venerunt simul cum nobis quidam ex discipulis a Caesarea
ducentes ad Mnasonem quendam Cyprium, antiquum discipulum apud quem
hospitaremur, And there came also together with us certain of the disciples
from Caesarea who conducted us to one Mnason a Cyprian an old disciple with
whom we should lodge, (...) for (...), That is, to Mnasons house. To words that
fignisie motion to a place, the Dative is oftentimes put for the Accusative
with a praeposition. As, (...), for (...). In the mean time I cannot but wonder
that most Interpreters Translate adducentes secum Mnasonem, and brought with
them one Mnason, when as it agrees neither with sense nor Grammar, It being
much more probable that Mnason with whom they meant to lodge was at that time
at Rome.

C. 24. v. 18. (...), properly, Inter quae, The which whilst I was doing,
certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the Temple. You have the same
phrase in the same sense, c. 26. v. 12. (...), The which whilst I was doing,
that is, whilst he was persecuting the Jews, v. 11. As he went to Damascus,
etc. He saw a light from heaven, etc.

C. 26. v. 23. (...), etc. Saying nothing other then what the Prophets and
Moses said should come to pass, if Christ was subject for to suffer, if he was
the first from the Resurrection of the dead, etc. Si passibilis Christus, is
the Translation of the Interlineary and the vulgar Latin, neither can the Greek
words admit any other. The Jews expected then, as still to this very day they
do expect, a Messiah whose Kingdom should be of this world, and so did the
Apostles also at the first before his Resurrection, and therefore could by no
means believe, that he could be subject unto Death or Passion. To root out
which opinion out of their thoughts, St Paul would not have them persuaded
barely by his word, but convinces them by the Testimony of their own very
Prophets; before (...) is to be understood.

C. 27. v. 21. (...), Hanc injuriam, commonly, This harm, but why not better,
this storm, if it be true that Suidas says, (...), Eo quod pluat pondus, or
graviter, Because it raineth heavily, or grievously. And we have in Julius
Pollux, (...), Ventus insolens or procellosus, A boisterous or stormy wind. And
thus Translated the sense is altogether as good if not better, Oportuit
auscultasse mihi, and non solvisse a Creta, vitasse hanc tempestatem and
jacturam, Ye ought to have harkned unto me, and not to have loosed from Crete,
and to have avoided this storm and loss.

ANNOTATIONS On the Ep. To the Romans.
Chapter 1. v. 17.

(...). These words seem to be expounded with most significancy by trajection,
For the righteousness of God by Faith is in it revealed for Faith, that is to
be believed. As if it were written, (...). That such trajections are very
frequent I have showed in sundry places, it is called, c. 3.22. (...), The
righteousness of God by Faith of or in Jesus Christ. And in truth is the main
purpose of this Epistle. As for the phrase (...), it is used in the same sense
immediately before, v. 5. (...), To or for the obedience of Faith, that is,
that the Faith may be obeyed among all Nations, as also, c. 15.18. (...), For
the obedience of the Gentiles, that is, that the Gentiles may be made obedient.
(...), For the Gospel is the power of God unto Salvation to every one that
believes, [there is (...)] to the Jew first and also to the Greek, v. 16. So
that it most fitly follows, For therein is the righteousness of God by Faith
revealed that it may be believed, as it is written, Justus autem ex fide vivet,
That he that is just by Faith, shall live, to wit, he shall inherit eternal
life. For the Gospel is the power of God to save every one that believes in
his Son. You may see the like trajections, Act. 13.27. 2 Cor. 4.4. 1 Pet. 3.21.

C. 2. v. 15. (...), Opus legis, The work of the law. The work or business of
the law, is to accuse, or to excuse, and this is that conscience which is
written in the hearts of all.

C. 3. v. 5, 6, 7. (...), Si vero iniquitas nostra justitiam dei commendat,
quid dicemus? Nonne injustus est Deus qui infert iram? (secundum hominem
loquor, absit. Tum enim quomodo Deus judicabit mundum?) Si enim veritas dei in
meo mendacio abundavit ad gloriam ipsius, quid ego tanquam peccator adhuc
judicor and non (sicut blasphemamur, and sicut quidam nos aiunt dicere) quoniam
fecerimus mala ut venirent bona? quorum judicium justum est, But if our
unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? is not God
unjust who inflicteth punishment? (I speak as a man, far be it. For then how
shall God judge the world?) for if the truth of God through my falsness has
more abounded unto his glory, why am I yet judged as a sinner and not (as we
are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say) because we have done
evil, that good might follow? whose judgment is just. Most Interpreters do here
omit the conjunction (...), as redundant. But I conceive it is by no means to
be pretermitted, for that it is the very word that explains the whole sense,
which hitherto is very perplexed and obscure. The word (...), which is commonly
rendered in the Imperative, Faciamus, Let us do, I have Translated in the
subjunctive Aorist in its proper sense together with the conjunction (...),
quoniam fecerimus, because we have done. The particle (...) I have Translated
with Grotius in the Interrogative Negative, Nonne, is not? for so the sense
requires, it being spoken carnally, or like a man, to charge God with
injustice, and so you shall find the word to be taken, Matthew. c. 12. v. 23.
Joh. c. 4. v. 29. and elsewhere. Those words, (...), etc. which divide the
coherence, I have distinguished with a larger Parenthesis, that the connection
and inference of the sense may more easily appear, which is plainly thus, For
if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God what shall we say? is
not God unjust who inflicteth punishment? for if the truth of God through my
falsness has more abounded unto his glory, why am I yet judged as a sinner,
and not rather judged, because we have done evil that good might come, whose
judgment that so judge is just. For if they were called into judgment because
they had done evil that good might come, (...), according to man they might
say, that God was unjust for punishing them as sinners, who had done nothing
but what tended to his glory, and this judgment in their opinion is just. But
if this should be granted, how should God judge the world? if with this plea
the wicked might avoid his judgment, there would be none left to punish. And
therefore the Apostle adds, I speak as a man, according to the Sophistical
argumentation of the Jews, or as Hierome says, Secundum te qui talia sentis,
According to thee who so think. But far be it from our thoughts, for God
cannot be unjust.

C. 5. v. 7. (...), For a righteous man scarce any man will die, but for a good
man peradventure some will dare to die. (...) in the Old Glossary is benignus,
and (...) with Suidas are (...), ad misericordiam propensi, such as are very
prone to mercy. And in Phavorinus (...), is (...), Qui non rogatus bona sua
largitur citra invidiam, Who bestows his goods unaskt without grudging. (...),
as Theocritus says of Menalcas. So that, Good, is a complex word that has
several meanings, it signifies, Courteous or kind, merciful or liberal, and
such is a friend in all respects, and for such a friend perhaps some would dare
to die, as some rare examples tell us; or perhaps Good may be taken here as
personally good to such a man, and such a one is properly a friend. Let a man
be never so just or righteous, there is none will lay down his life for him, but
for such a one as has been good to me, as my friend has been, perhaps for
such a one I shall dare to die, and farther reaches not the love of man.
(...), etc. No man has Greater love then this, that he lay down his life for
his friend, Joh. c. 15. v. 13. But God commends his love to us, in that while
we were yet sinners, that is enemies, Christ died for us. This is the love
which exceeds knowledge, Ephesians. c. 3. v. 19.

V. 12, 13, 14. etc. (...). In most Interpreters you have in this place an
Anantopodoton, that is a deficiency in the reddition of the sense, a sicut
without a sic, which ought by all means to be avoided, if without violence to
the Text it possibly may. Nor can I assent to those who to prevent the
inconvenience of an Anantopodosis would have the 18 and 19 verses answer to the
12. which seems to me too constrainedly forced. I rather approve their
judgments who Translate (...), by a frequent Metathesis, ita quoque, so also,
as the Old Latin Interpreter of Chrysostom; the Syriack and Arabic read, or
etiam ita, even so, by which version there is no wrong either to the
construction or the sense, but all is whole taking (...) only in the redditive
and not in the copulative sense, as it is in the Lords prayer, (...), Ut in
coelo etiam in terra. (...), etc. (...), etc. Propterea sicut per unum hominem
peccatum in mundum introiit, and per peccatum mors, etiam ita mors in omnes
homines pertransiit eo quod omnes peccaverunt, Therefore as by one man sin
entered into the world, and by sin death, even so death passes upon all men,
for that all have sinned. For until the Law, that is, before the Law sin was in
the world. That sin was in the world before the Law, seems to be the main thing
that the Apostle here labors to prove, that he might meet with the tacit or
implied objection of those who probably did deny that all men were sinners and
the enemies of God, as he had before affirmed, v. 8. and therefore did
Sophistically argue, that Christ died not for all, because sin is the
transgression of the Law, but they which had no Law, could not transgress that
which they had not, for the Law was from Moses, Joh. c. 1. v. 17. To meet
therefore with their objection, he uses this argument, As by one man sin
entered into the world and by sin death, (...), For this very reason, Even so is
death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned, none excepted. So that it
appears most certainly true that from the fall of Adam to the Law given by
Moses, for he speaks of no other Law throughout the whole Epistle, sin was in
the world. But it is farther objected, that sin is not imputed where there is
no Law, for the Law works wrath, c. 4. v. 5. To which he gives no other
answer, but an implicit one, the same in effect which he gave before, Immo, for
so (...) I conceive is to be rendered here, Regnavit mors ab Adam, etc. Yea
death reigned from Adam to Moses, therefore was sin not only in the world
before the Law, but also imputed before the Law. Their dying was an argument
not only that they had sinned, but that also their sin was imputed, for the
wages of sin is death, and therefore because death has passed on all men, its
necessarily determined that all have sinned, and so become obnoxious to the
punishment of death, even they who had not sinned after the similitude of Adams
transgression, for death reigned on very Infants, who sinned not actually, as
Adam did, (...), that is, (...), who is the type of man to come, to wit, of all
mankind. For Adam did in his person represent all the Race of men which were to
spring from his loins. And in this regard and sense Adam seems to me most fitly
to be styled in this place, (...), The type of man which is to come. I
acknowledge all Interpreters elder and later understand Christ to be him that
was to come, but I see no cogency in the Text to bind my Faith to that
interpretation, but rather arguments to dissuade it. For truly if we speak in a
proper sense, Adam cannot be said to be the type of Christ. For a type is the
express Image or Figure of the thing it represents, (...) respondet (...), ut
sigillo cera, the type answers to the antitype, as the wax unto the seal. It
is absolutely necessary that the type of that which is good be good it self,
and the type of that which is evil must be evil, otherwise it cannot be a type.
It is the sense of Chrysostom in his Comment on the Epistle to the Hebrews, c.
9. v. 23. Neither is there any will say that Adam is a true and proper type of
Christ, but that he is so only per antithesim, or analogiam, by opposition of
contraries, or proportion, or by some intricate distinction, such as is that of
Origen's, Juxta genus constare similitudinem, juxta speciem repugnantiam esse,
That there is a similitude as to the Genus, a repugnancy as to the species.
Whereas Adam is properly, truly and significantly, I may add aptly and
appositly to this place, said to be the type of his offspring which was to
come from his loins, and which he did so virtually represent in his person, as
that by his sin they all became obnoxious to sin and death. And from these
words thus expounded is formed as strong an argument for Original sin as from
any Text of Scripture. Neither do I seem to be altogether without witness, I
have the Aethiopick Version or Paraphrase for me. The words whereof in Latin
are these. Veruntamen dominata est mors propterea ab Adamo usque ad Mosem, tam
in iis qui peccaverunt, quem in iis qui non peccaverunt, per illud peccatum
Adami, eo quod unusquisque in similitudine Adami creatus est, and quia Adamus
typus fuit illius qui erat venturus, Nevertheless death reigned therefore from
Adam to Moses, as well in those that sinned, as also in those that sinned not,
by that sin of Adam, because that every one is born in the likeness of Adam,
and because Adam was the type of him that was to come. From which words I could
make no other construction, but that he plainly means that death did reign over
all by the sin of Adam, for these two causes, because every one was born, in
the likeness of Adam, and because Adam was the type of him who was to come.
Both which reasons seem to me one and the same, the one being a reddition or
explication only of the other, it being all one to say, that Adam was a type of
his Posterity, and that Adam's Posterity was born in his likeness. But to say
that death reigned over all by the sin of Adam because Adam was the type of
Christ, is surely an inconsequent argument. Whereas to affirm, that death
reigned over all by the sin of Adam, because Adam was a type that represented
all his Posterity, methinks, answers fitly to the place, and is very easy for
the lowest capacity at first sight to apprehend.

C. 6. v. 4. Christ is said to be raised from the dead, (...), By the glory of
the Father, as it is commonly rendered. Beza would have it, In gloriam Patris,
(...) being put for (...), For the glory of the Father. The Translation either
way is harsh. Why may it not be much better rendered by a familiar trajection?
Per Patrem gloriae, By the Father of glory, which is significant and apt, as he
is elsewhere called Dominus gloriae, and Deus gloriae, The Lord of glory, and
the God of glory. And so is he expressly called, Ephesians. c. 1. v. 17. (...), Pater
gloriae, The Father of glory.

C 7. v. 24. (...), O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? Or as it is in our margin from this body of death? And why
not, O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the death of this body?
that is thus captivated under the Law of sin which is in its members, v. 23.
And so the sense without any Metaphor is plain and suitable to the scope of the
place. There being nothing more familiar then such trajections. Examples
whereof you may see, Heb. c. 7. v. 4. Jam. c. 2. v. 1. c. 3. v. 3. 1 Pet. c. 3.
v. 21. 2 Pet. c. 1. v. 19. You have one in the margin of this very place.

V. 25. (...). These words are to be supplied out of the former, whereto they
are a perfect answer. The Apostles trembling question was, Who shall deliver me
from the death of this body, that is such a slave to sin? to which he forthwith
answers, I thank God he will deliver me, through Jesus Christ, (...), being to
be understood, as a reddition to the question.

C. 8. v. 3. (...), etc. I cannot see how there can be construction here but by
a Metathesis, (...), etc. Eo enim quod impotentia legis debilis erat propter
carnem, Deus filium suum mittens, etc. For in that the weakness of the Law was
impotent because of the flesh, God sending his own Son, etc.

C. 9. v. 10, 11. (...), etc. (...), etc. To reconcile the sense and
construction of these words wherein there has been so much labor, you must
understand the verb (...) before the participle (...), by an Hebraism or
Graecism frequent in every Page almost in Holy Writ. Whereof see note on Mar.
c. 12. v. 40. Promissionis enim verbum hoc est, secundum tempus hoc veniam and
erit Sarae filius, non solum vero, sed and Rebecca ex altero erat gravida ex
Isaac patre nostro, nondum enim natis, etc. Dictum est ei, major serviet
minori, For this is the word of promise. At this time I will come, and Sara
shall have a son, and not only so, but Rebecca also by another was with child
by our Father Isaac, For the children being not yet born, etc. It was said unto
her, The elder shall serve the younger. As much as to say, that Rebecca was
with child also by another word of promise, (...), relating to (...). (...), I
conceive to be a more proper phrase, then (...), For if a man be said (...),
Numb. c. 5. v. 20. then is it rightly said (...), Rebecca retinuit semen patris
nostri Isaac, that is, concepit, she was with child by her Father Isaac. So
that there was not such necessity for the learned Beza to pronounce so
positively, Est itaque depravatus hic locus a quopiam Graecae linguae prorsus
ignaro, This place is depraved by some person ignorant of the Greek tongue.
When as so easy and frequent a remedy is at hand. (...), According to this
time, are the words of the LXX, whom Paul it seems did follow, and they
questionless read (...) instead of (...), and so rendered it (...), this time,
for (...), the time of life, accoding as it is Genesis c. 18. v. 10. and 14.
(...), Secundum or circa tempus vitae, At or about the time of life I will
return unto thee. And I suspect it is not rightly read in the Hebrew it self,
Genesis c. 17. v. 21. (...), at this time, which should have been rather written
conformably with the other places, relating to this story, (...), at the time
of life. As for the word (...) in our sense, it is abundantly familiar, The LXX
use it for, (...) altero, another, Genesis c. 43. v. 13. Psalm. 108. v. 14. You
shall find it likewise in the same sense, 1 Cor. c. 4. v. 6. and in Dioscor.
and Greg. Nazian. take but the pains to look in Steph. These.

V. 22. (...), etc. Here is no necessity for Anantopodosis, the coherence of
the place is plain and ready, distinguish but the words aright. Nay but O man
who art thou that reply against God, if God being willing to show his wrath
and to make his power known has endured with much long suffering the vessels
of wrath fitted for destruction? The intervenient words, Shall the thing formed
say unto him that formed it why have thou made me thus? Has not the Potter
power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another
to dishonor? being all to be included in a Parenthesis. Thus (...); etc. The
Conjunction (...) before (...), is expletive, as is usual.

C. 10. v. 16. (...), Sed nulli obedierunt Evangelio, But none have obeyed the
Gospel. For Esaias says, Who has believed our report? plainly intimating not
any, or scarce any had believed. The phrase is familiar, Act. c. 10. v. 25.
(...), None of you shall see my face any more. 1 Cor. c. 1. v. 29. (...), etc.
That no flesh should glory. And so frequently in the Old Testament, and
elsewhere in the New.

C. 11. v. 21. (...). What need is there of any supplement? For it is (...)
rightly spoken according to the use of speaking with the LXX (...) forte,
perhaps. For if God spared not the natural branches perhaps he will neither
spare thee. See 2 Timothy c. 2. v. 25.

C. 12. v. 19. (...), But give place unto vengeance, that is to the minister of
God who is (...), the avenger to punish him that does evil, c. 13. v. 4. So
frequently in the Old Testament, where God is meant to be avenged of his
people, it is said (...), And the wrath, that is, the vengeance of God came
upon them, Psalm. 78. v. 31. So Romans c. 3. v. 5. (...), we Translate, Who takes
vengeance. But we ought by no means to give place unto anger, Ephesians. c. 4. v. 26.
Be ye angry and sin not, let not the sun go down upon your wrath, (...),
Neither give place to the Devil, that is, to the passion of anger. So Plutarch,
(...), We ought not to give place to wrath no not in jest or play.

C. 14. v. 1. (...), Infirmum fide assumite non ad dijudicationes cogitationum,
Him that is weak in the Faith receive, not to judge of his inward thoughts. By
a frequent phrase, such as is (...), c. 1. v. 5. and (...), c. 15. v. 18. In
which sense that these words are to be understood the following declare. Tu
quis es qui judicas alienum servum? Who art thou that judge another man's
servant? Temerarias censuras prohibet Apostolus, The Apostle forbids rash
censures, says St Hierome. As if he should say, Him that is weak in the Faith
receive into your fellowship, but not to discriminate or judge his private
opinions, if perhaps out of the weakness of his judgment he thinks otherwise
then ye do. For one believes that he may eat all things, another who is weak
eats herbs. Let not him that eats, despise him that eats not, and let not
him that eats not, judge him that eats. Neither is that Translation, which
renders, To doubtful disputations, very significant, besides that it is
unusual. For (...) in the Old and New Testament is for the most part taken, Pro
cogitatione hominis secum ratiocinantis, For the thought of a man reasoning
within himself. As Stephanus has well observed.

C. 16. v. 25. (...), etc. But to him that is of power to establish you
according to my Gospel, etc. Why this Doxology is annexed now a days to the end
of this Chapter, I cannot but wonder at, when it is confessed almost by all, that
these verses, to wit, the 25, 26, 27, are found in all ancient copies, as they
do also remain in the Greek Fathers, written in the end of the 14 chapter,
after those words, Whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin, except the Alexandrian
transcript, which (perhaps out of abundant caution) reads it in both places. As
far as I can conjecture of this matter, it seems to me to be thus. There was a
common opinion which possibly from Hieroms words upon this place was derived to
posterity, that Marcion the Haeretique did raze or cut out all the 15 and 16
Chapters because they thwarted his opinion, and that he might the better cover
his fraud, placed this Doxology at the end of c. 14. because he would have had
the Epistle to end there. But I do very much doubt that this was ever done by
him, though I will not question but he endeavored to raze out all the rest. I
rather believe that the Orthodox Christians of those times and their followers,
induced with this opinion out of their zeal to meet with Marcion, did purposely
remove this Doxology from the end of c. 14. where it was not fixed by the fraud
of Marcion, but by the Apostle himself, to the end of c. 16. that so they might
include all which Marcion would have rased out. I say they removed it from its
proper place for this cause, for I cannot conjecture for what other reason they
should do it. Was it because Doxologies were more commodious in the end of an
Epistle? surely no. For Ephesians. c. 3. v. 20, 21. there is the same Doxology in the
middle, and Gal. c. 1. v. 5. and 1 Timothy c. 1. v. 17. there is the like in the
beginning, and so in diverse other places scattering through Paul's Epistles, but
none in the end of any, where it was his solemn custom to use another Epilogue,
which was his sign in every Epistle, So I write, The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all, Amen. Or was it because this Doxology was more
extraordinarily fit and proper for the end of the Epistle? surely no. For it
has no coherence at all with the precedent matter, but it suits and agrees
most exactly well with the end of c. 14. where when the Apostle had through the
whole chapter almost discoursed of the danger of a doubting mind, most fitly
follows this Doxology, (...), etc. But to him that has power to establish you,
etc. be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. So Chrysostom and other Greek
Interpreters have observed on this place, (...), It was the custom of Paul to
close his exhortations with prayers and Doxologies. Since therefore the cause
is ceased, and almost all knowledge at least remembrance of it, for which these
verses were perhaps with a pious zeal at first removed to the end of c. 16.
that they might reinclude all that Marcion would have expunged, I conceive he
shall commit no offense, but rather do a grateful service, who ever shall remit
them to their proper place at the end of c. 14. After those words, (...).

ANNOTATIONS On the I. Ep. To The Corinthians.
Chapter 2. v. 2.

(...), etc. Non enim decreveram scire quicquam inter vos nisi Jesum Christum
eumque crucifixum, For I determined not to know any thing among you but Jesus
Christ and him crucified. But to confess my ignorance, I profess, I do not
comprehend the meaning of this expression, I had rather thought the Apostle
intended to tell the Corinthians, what was necessary for them to know, and not
for himself. Some therefore seeking to avoid the inconvenience of this phrase,
would have (...), to signify, (...), to preach or to declare, but that
signification is surely strained too far from the genuine sense and common use
of the word to deserve acceptance. That the interpretation may be fitted to a
better sense, the use of words and Grammatical construction, I think we may
more rightly say, that (...) is an elleiptical expression instead of, (...),
like to that in the Hebrew, Habak. c. 1. v. 5. as it is usually read and
Translated (...), Videte intergentes, Behold among the Heathen, that is, ye who
are among the Heathen, or behold ye Heathen. Or in Luke c. 21. v. 16. (...),
And some of you shall they cause to be put to death. Or Joh. c. 6. v. 17.
(...), Dixerunt ergo discipuli, as the Old Latin, Then said some of his
disciples. And so we may render it with very good sense, Non enim decrevi eos
qui inter vos sunt aliquid scire, nisi Jesum Christum eumque crucifixum, For I
determined not, that you or those that are among you should know any thing but
Jesus Christ and him crucified. And therefore he says, He came not with
excellency of speech, or wisdom, but in weakness and in fear, not with the
persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the spirit and of
power.

V. 6. (...), Sapientiam loquimur in perfectis, We speak wisdom in things that
are perfect. He speaks not of persons, meaning the Corinthians, whom in the
following chapter v. 1. he calls babes in Christ, so far were they distant from
perfection, but rather in things that are holy or sacred. For (...) are (...),
and (...), Hesych. and Phavor. So Heb. c. 2. v. 10. (...) and (...), to make
perfect and to sanctify or consecrate, are all one. It is a manner of speech
peculiar to this place. My speech and my preaching was not (...) in the
persuasive words of humane wisdom, but (...) in the demonstration of the
spirit. We speak wisdom (...) in things sacred or holy, (...), in a mystery,
(...), in words taught of the holy spirit. Through the whole series of his
discourse in this chapter there is no mention of to whom he spoke, but of what
or how he spoke, to wit of things sacred and mysterious, which eye has not
seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man, v. 9. (...) a
Dionysio vocatur vis divina operans in sacris Ecclesiasticis. (...), sacro and
consecro, (...) Greg. Naz. appellat baptismum, (...), Idem. (...) etiam (...)
dicebant eximia vel sanctiora vel Justa, Bud. com. ling. Grae. p. 624. 625.
(...), was with the Athenians, (...), the lawful oath, Andocides in the same
place.

C. 3. v. 12, 13, etc. (...), etc. The sense of this place is this. If any
Minister of the Gospel shall build upon this foundation, which is Jesus Christ,
gold, silver, or precious stones, that is, a pure, solid, and stable doctrine,
concerning the Faith of Christ, or hay, wood, and stubble, that is, a frail,
fading and temporary doctrine, what ever it be, the day shall declare it, when
the fire of trial comes, what every man's work is, (...), the fire of
persecution shall try. In that day they who were builded on the pure and solid
doctrine of Faith, shall remain steadfast, and so the Minister shall receive his
reward, to wit, the perseverance of his disciples, but they who were faintly
rooted in the Faith, when the trial of persecution comes, immediately fall
away and become Apostates from the Faith, and so that Minister shall suffer
loss, he shall lose his labor and the reward of his pains, but he himself
shall be saved, (...), But so as he pass through the fire of persecution with
constancy and steddiness to the Faith himself. Upon this account it was, that
St John, after he had forewarned the Elect Lady and her Children, of the
deceivers and the Antichrist who were entered into the world, gives them this
farther caution, 2 Ep. v. 8. (...), Videte vosmetipsos, ne perdamus quae
operati sumus, sed ut mercedem plenam accipiamus, Look to your selves, that we
loose not those things which we have wrought, but that we may receive a full
reward. Not as in the Vulgar Latin and some Greek copies, (...), (...), and
(...), Videte vosmetipsos, ne perdatis quae operati estis, sed ut mercedem
plenam accipiatis. Whereby the allusion to St Paul is wholly lost. See Philip.
c. 2. v. 16. (...), Verbum vitae firmiter tenentes, Holding fast the word of
life, Ut gloriari possim in die Christi, That I may glory in the day of Christ.
Behold the reward of Paul, the perseverance of the Philippians in the word of
life.

C. 4. v. 3. (...). Literally, of man's day, but the sense is the Judgment of
man. In our language we call him a Days man, that is chosen an Vmpire to judge
between party and party, probably from the Latin phrase, a dicendo diem, from
appointing a day in which the Days man was to give his judgment.

C. 5. v. 13. (...), Quid enim mihi de iis qui foris sunt judicare? Nonne de
iis qui intus sunt vos judicatis? eos vero qui foris sunt judicat Deus. Tollite
ergo sceleratum istum ex vobis ipsis. For what have I to do to judge them that
are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? but them that are without
God judges. Therefore put away from among you that wicked person. This reading
and Translation do neither agree with the context nor with the scope of the
Apostle, whose main business is in this Chapter to reprove the Corinthians
because they had not judged the incestuous person, who was a brother and within
the Church, as they ought to have done; and in the next, because they had no
Judgment seats at all, Whereas by this question [ do ye not judge those that
are within?] is implicitly granted, that they were not to be blamed at all for
their slackness in this duty. That therefore we may reconcile the coherence of
the Text, and the Apostle to himself, and the meaning of the place may be made
somewhat plainer then hitherto it is, We must first alter the points, as
Theophylact does witness some did before his time, and then the reading in a
letter, and an accent, and that not without Authority, for so Theodoret did
read, (...), the evil, for (...), the evil person, and (...) shall judge, for
(...) judges. And so reads the Greek edition of Aldus prepared by Asulanus and
set out in print 1518. And so does the Old Latin read judicabit for judicat,
and malum I suppose in the Neuter gender. Thus, (...), Quid enim mihi eos qui
foris sunt judicare^ Non omnino. Eos qui intus sunt judica^ vos, eos vero qui
extra sunt judicabit De^, and tolletis malum e vobis, For what have ^ to do to
judge them that are without? Not at all. Judge ye those that are within, but
those that are without God will judge, and ye shall take away the evil from
among you. As if he should say, It concerns not us at all to judge those that
are without the Church, do ye your duty in judging those that are within it,
and so doing ye shall take away the evil from among your selves, that is, ye
shall not be guilty of the evil; but as for those that are out of the Church,
its fitting for you to leave them to the Judgment of God. And to speak the
truth, as (...), the evil, in the Neuter gender, does very well suit with the
scope of this place, so does it with the use of the phrase in the Old
Testament, from whence without doubt the Apostle borrowed it. So Chrysostom on
the place, (...), Meminit dictionis in Veteri, He remembered the phrase in the
Old Testament, and so Theodoret, (...), Mosaicum apposuit Testimonium, He put
to the Testimony of Moses. But that this phrase will bear no other reading or
sense in the Old Testament, but in the Neuter gender, will evidently appear to
those who shall diligently examine the circumstances of the places, wherever
they find it. For example, where is mention made of the Damosel on whom her
virginity was not found, Deuteronomy. c. 22. v. 21. She shall be stoned with stones
that she die, (...), So shall thou put away the evil from among you, that is,
the guilt of the evil, as Deuteronomy. c. 21. v. 9. And he that is but a smatterer in
Greek, will presently discern it to be a fault in the Roman edition of the LXX,
which renders in this place (...) in the Masculine gender, as also in the 22.
and 24. verses of the same chapter, in both which places the same reading is
altogether as incongruous, though it was prudently forborne in our new Poliglott
Bibles from the emendation of it, least the Romanists should from thence have
taken occasion to cavil with our Edition for corrupting of their copy.

C. 6. v. 1. (...), Negotium habens, Having a matter, that is, litem, a
controversy, suite or action against another, so as it might more properly and
significantly be rendered, having a suite or action against another, in which
sense (...) is frequently understood with the Greeks, as is negotium also with
the Latins.

V. 2. (...); Indigni estis ut de minimis judicetis? As the vulgar Latin. Are
ye unworthy to judge of the smallest matters? But this Translation is not
adequate to the words. Beza seems to go somewhat nearer. Indigni estis minimis
judiciis? But neither is that plain. For the Apostle intends not the act of
Judgment, but the place. And therefore it would be more fitly rendered according
to the force of the word, Indigni estis minimis fubselliis? Are ye unworthy of
the least places of judicature? For (...) in no Author signifies the act of
Judgment, but the Bench or Seat where Judgment is given, the same with (...),
in which sense it is used, Jud. c. 5. v. 9. Dan. c. 7. V. 10. Susan v. 49. Jam.
c. 2. v. 6. As if he should have said, What? Are ye who shall sit on Thrones
(as it is in another place) judging the Twelve tribes of Israel, unworthy of
the smallest seats of Judgment here? Subsellia are called the seats of
Judicature, in which Judgments are given of the smallest matters, according to
Asconius.

V. 4. (...), etc. The commmon version suites neither with the custom of speech
among the Greeks, with construction, or with sense. Secularia igitur judicia si
habeatis, contemptibiles qui sunt in Ecclesia, illos constituite ad judicandum,
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge
who are least esteemed of the Church. Where by the word (...), judicia,
judgments, the Interpreters seem to understand suits at Law, but as I told you
in the former animadversion, (...), in no Author signifies any such thing as a
suit at Law. If they say, they mean Judgment seats, their language is not
clear, and besides they then plainly affirm, that which the Apostle positively
denies, who reproves them for that very cause, for that they had none, but
would be judged rather by Infidels. And if this were granted the inference is
not so suitable to sense and reason, but that there may be cause enough (...),
to suspend a man's assent, and to enquire further into the truth of the
Translation. Which I conceive with the leave of Antiquity may be very easily
restored into a more commodious sense and Syntax, thus, only varying the
points, (...), Secularia igitur subsellia, si habeatis hos contemptibiles in
Ecclesia, constituite, Set ye up therefore secular Judgment seats, if ye
account these persons contemptible in the Church. As if he should say, What
will ye go to Law before the Infidels, who cannot but be despicable to the
Church, in that they are no part of it? Will ye suffer the unjust and wicked to
judge between you, whom ye your selves shall one day judge? Are ye ignorant
that ye shall Judge the very Angels? How much more worthy then are ye of these
petty seats of Judgment? Appoint ye therefore Judges among your selves, set up
some Judgment seats, I speak unto your shame, is it so, that there is not a
wise man among you, not one who can judge between brother and brother, but that
you go to Law with one another and that before the unbelievers? Far is it from
the Apostle to bid them place contemptible Persons in the seat of Judgment.
Nothing less, He reproves and checks them, that they should think so meanly of
themselves, as to appeal to the Courts of Infidels, as though there were not a
wise man among themselves, who might be judge among them. Surely by that very
speech severely intimating, that he ought to be a wise man and no contemptible
person, who should have the Authority to be Judge in the Church. And in
contradiction to this Interpretation there is not one thing can be properly
objected, the sense, the grammar, and form of speech so perfectly agreeing,
whereas there are so apparent Solecismes in the other, as are not to be by any
art reconciled. For besides that (...) was never used in that sense, as it is
here commonly taken, the phrase (...), is extremely harsh and insolent, not to
be salved with an Hebraism. For if it were a true Hebraism, it should be read,
(...), and not (...). As to the phrase, (...), it is the same with (...) in
Aristophanes and Libanius. But the inveterate opinion is more deeply rooted,
then to be removed without some Magisterial Authority, or else a supine
negligence has prevailed over us. And indeed the same fate is common to
profane Authors, else how is it possible, so stupid or irrational a version
should still pass unobserved by Interpreters to this very day, and that in a
place of moment, in the very entrance of Ptolomy, in the very definition of
Geography, unless men were blinded by some fate, seduced into error by the
unhappy connection of two words together, by reading of (...), in one word, for
(...), in two. (...), Geogrophia est imitatio picturae totius partis terrae
cognitae, Geography is an imitation of the picture of all that part of the
earth which is known. A definition surely absurd and insignificant. Whereas it
ought without all question to be read and Translated, Thus, (...), etc.
Geographia est imitatio totius partis terrae cognitae per picturam, per
descriptionem, or in tabula, Geography is an imitation of all that part of the
earth which is known, by picture, description, or map. The very name of
Geography, signifying nothing else but a description of the earth.

C. 7. v. 14. (...), For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife,
[that is the believing wife] and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the
husband [that is the believing husband] else, unless one of the Parents were a
believer, your children were unclean, that is remain heathen, as (...) is in
other places understood; but now [because one of the Parents is a believer] are
your children holy, that is reputed members of the Christian Church. And in
this sense does the Apostle often use the word (...), as in the beginning of
this Epistle, (...), To the Church of God which is in Corinth, that are called
Saints, Not that all who were in the Church of Corinth were real Saints, but
because they were reputed members of the Church, therefore were they called
Saints. And for that cause the children of that Parent that was (...), called a
Saint, or reputed a believer, were reputed Saints and holy also, and
consequently admitted to the participation of Baptism, as the son of a
Proselite was capable of Circumcision, and thereby admitted a member of the
Jewish Church. The unbelieving Parent is said to be sanctified by the believing
wife or husband, only to this purpose, to the making of the children holy, that
is, capable of being members of Gods visible Church, as appears by the
connection and consequence of the words.

V. 17. (...), But as God has distributed to every one, etc. To Translate,
(...), but, in this place is somewhat harsh, and besides it marr's the sense.
For remedy whereof the Greek Scholiast reads, (...), fitly joining the words to
the verse before, (...), etc. Or what know thou O man whether thou shall
save thy wife, or not? But there is no need to alter the reading at all, the
common one with this distinction is enough, (...), etc. What know thou O
man, whether thou shall save thy wife, whether not? As God has distributed to
every one so let him walk.

V. 23. (...), Pretio empti estis nolite fieri servi hominum, Ye are bought
with a price, be not ye the servants of men. This reading and Translation seems
to respect our redemption by Christ, and literally implies a strange doctrine
contrary to what he had taught immediately before, As if because they were
redeemed by the blood of Christ, they should no more be servants, whereas
before he bad them not to care if they were called being servants, but to
remain in the same calling wherein they were called. So that I conceive there
is some other sense more proper to the place, which possibly reading the first
words with an interrogation may be this, (...), Pretio redempti estis? Nolite
fieri servi hominum, Are ye redeemed with a price? Become not the servants of
men. He speaks not here, of a redemption from the captivity of sin or the
bondage of Satan, but from the service of man, as is to be gathered from the
context which has nothing relating or common to or with a spiritual
redemption. The coherence being plainly thus. Art thou called being a servant,
care not for it, Are ye redeemed with a price? that is, are ye bought out and
made free by a sum of money? Why then, become not again the servants of men. If
thou may be made free, use it rather, otherwise, let every man abide in the
calling wherein he was called [to be a Christian.] But for a more perfect
understanding of the place, These, (...), men, whose servants he would have
them no more become, are to be supposed (...), unbelievers; As before, v. 14.
where the unbelieving husband is said to be sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife to be sanctified by the husband, you are to understand (...),
the wife that is a believer, and (...), the husband that is a believer, as it
is in some Greek copies and in the Old Latin, so here in like manner is to be
understood, (...), Become not again the servants of men who are unbelievers. As
before he advised in impari conjugio, so here he advises in impari servitio.
As if he should say, Art thou called to the Faith of Christ being a servant to
an unbeliever? Care not for it, it is no matter, continue thou still so, and be
content, That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed, 1 Timothy c. 6.
v. 1. Nevertheless if thou can be made free and redeemed with a sum of money,
choose that rather, and become no more again a servant to any man that is an
unbeliever. He does not advise him for ever to decline all manner of service,
from being a servant to all manner of persons. But in case he may have a
believer to his Master, surely it was not the Apostles meaning to forbid such
service. Who in the place aforementioned of Timothy, advises, that the
servants who had (...), believing Masters, should by no means despise them
because they were brethren, but to serve them so much the rather because they
were believers. For service surely is not only necessary, but in some cases
commendable.

V. 26. (...). These words some would have to refer to the Desolation spoken of
by Luke 21.23. But that (...), great distress, whereof our Savior did there
foretell, was to be (...), In this land and in this people, that is, in the land
of Judea and among the people of the Jews where then our Savior spoke. So that
it is not probable that Paul should write to the Corinthians to abstain from
Marriage for that distress or tribulation, which was so far distant from their
borders, neither did personally concern them. Others I confess with more reason
understand it of the Persecutions which were then at hand. But if you compare
the context, there seems more reason to say, it was for the imminent pressure
of the incommodities which for the most part accompany Wedlock, and are after
mentioned by the Apostle, (...), For the difficulties and troubles of Marriage,
Theophylact.

V. 29. (...), etc. (...), But I say this, [because that which is remaining is
but a short time,] that both they that have wives be as though they had none,
and they that weep, as those that do not weep, and they that rejoice, as those
that rejoice not, etc. For the form of this world passes away, After (...), is
probably to be understood, (...), the remainder of their lives. As if he should
have said, Because the time of life is so short upon earth, and the world
passes so suddenly away, neither have we here an abiding City, Heb. 13.14. I
tell you this, that ye be not too sollicitous, as he forthwith admonishes them
not to be, either for the miseries or pleasures of the world, as in some men's
sense virginity and marriage, joy and weeping are accounted, but to be of an
even temper in both estates.

V. 35. (...), Hoc vero dico ad utilitatem vestram, non ut vinculum vobis
imponam, sed ad id quod honestum est and decorum domino, sine violenta
abstractione, But this I say for your own profit, not that I should put an
obligation or bond upon you, but for that which is comely and well befitting
the Lord, without any forcible withdrawing or wresting of you. (...), with
Suidas is (...), Vi aliquid abripere, To wrest a thing away by force. So as the
sense is this, I tell you this for your own good, for that which is becoming
you, and well befitting the Lord, not that I go about under the pretense of my
Authority to impose a bond of necessity upon you to do the thing I commend unto
you, (...), Not that I should compel you to continue in virginity whether ye
will or no. (...), For he calls necessity a bond, as the Greek Scholiast has
it, (...), But without any compulsion, or forcible wresting of you to my
opinion. For, for what I now say, I have no commandment from the Lord, etc. v.
25. (...), Hesych. (...), in the French tongue is, bienseant, well befitting,
quod been assidet, word for word. How the common Translations, either that of
the vulgar Latin, Sed ad id quod honestum est, and quod facultatem praebeat
sine impedimento dominum obsecrandi, or that of Beza, Sed ut decenter and apt
adhaerescatis domino absque ulla distractione, or that of the Interlineary, Sed
ad decens and been adhaerens domino indistracte, or that of our English, But
for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord without
distraction, may or possibly can be reconciled in any lawful construction to
any of the senses imposed by them, I do by no means perceive or understand.

C. 11. v. 7. (...), But the woman is the glory of her husband. The meaning
whereof is certainly extremely difficult. Why not rather, the Image of her
husband? A man indeed ought not to cover his head, (...), Quoniam sit figura
and Imago Dei, Because he is the figure and Image of God, but the woman is the
Image of man. She is properly termed the Image of man, because she was taken
out of him, as properly as Seth may be termed the Image of Adam who begot him
in his likeness, Genesis c. 5. v. 3. So (...) which with the Hebrew signifies the
Image, Figure or Similitude which is drawn from another thing, the LXX
Translate, (...), Numb. c. 12. v. 8. and Psalm. 17. v. 15. and so Phavorinus,
(...), Effigies, Imago.

V. 10. (...). I was never yet satisfied with any Interpretation or Exposition
upon this place, and therefore must crave leave to venture on a new one,
resolving not to swerve from rules of Grammar, the use of words, or the scope
of the place. Thus, Propter hoc debet mulier potestatem habere in capite per
Angelos, For this cause ought the woman to account the power to be in her head
by the Angels. So does (...) often signify with the Greeks, and habere with
the Latins, (...), in capite, in her head, is, in viro, in her husband, as he
is called, v. 3. And Ephesians. c. 5. v. 23. (...) is properly enough Translated
per, by, as (...), Per Deos servatus sum, five a Diis, I was saved by the Gods,
Demost. Or be it Translated propter Angelos, because of the Angels, the sense
will be the same. For the confirmation of this sense and Interpretation I shall
borrow two arguments, the one from the words immediately preceding, the other
from those which immediately follow. The force of the argument from the words
preceding is this, For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man,
neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man. v. 8, 9.
Ergo, Therefore ought the woman to acknowledge or account the power to be in
her husband, who is her head. You have the same argument, 1 Timothy c. 2. v. 11,
12, 13. Let the woman be in silence in all subjection, for I suffer not a woman
to teach, nor to usurp Authority over the man, but to be in silence. And why
so? For Adam was first made, then Eve. So as for this very cause she ought to
acknowledge the power in her husband, to whom she ought to be in subjection,
and over whom she ought not to usurp Authority. When therefore the arguments
are both the same, why should we question, but the Apostle intends the same
direct sense in the one place, as in the other, when construction and the use
of words do bear it? Why should we fly to violent notions and remedies when
there is no need? The force of the other argument from the words that follow,
v. 11, 12. is this, because they are a qualification or mitigation of the
rigor of the injunction, least it might be taken by the husband in too strict
and severe a sense. As if he should say, Although a woman ought to acknowledge
the power in her husband by the Law of their creation which was delivered by
the Angels, Genesis c. 3. v. 16. Nevertheless, neither is the man without the
woman, nor the woman without the man by the Lord, for as the woman is of the
man, even so also is the man by the woman, but all things are of God. From
whence is necessarily intimated, that such is the mutual bond of relation
between the man and the woman, that because one cannot be without the other,
and because whatever they be, they are all of God, the man ought not to
indulge, challenge or assume by any means too much to his own power, though
given him by the Law of his creation by God himself, but to use it with modesty
and sobriety, without the admission of which supplemental exposition, these
latter verses for ought I know have no coherence with the former. And thus I
suppose we rightly take these words as arguments of the woman's subjection, nor
deny we, but her subjection was an argument why she should be covered But
others who eagerly contend for a Foreign and unusual Interpretation of the
word (...), that they may expedite their business, pass by or rather reject
this argument from the reason of the woman's subjection, which is the most
rational and certain, and frame another of their own, as we say per saltum, by
a leap, or at least admit it. The man is not of the woman, but the woman of the
man, etc. Therefore ought the woman to wear a hood or covering on her head, and
therefore (...) in this place does signify velamen or signum potestatis viri,
a covering or sign of the husbands power. To defend which opinion, some would
have (...), the power, by a Metonymy to be put for a covering, the sign of
power. But this I take to be spoken of free cost, till I hear some more cogent
Authorities. Others say, that the Apostle put (...) here, pro velo, for a
covering or a veil, because the Hebrew word (...), peplum, or velum, comes from
the root, (...) which signifies subjecit, to subject. But (...), which
signifies peplum, a veil, comes not from that root that signifies to subject,
but from (...), which signifies extendit or expandit, to extend or spread, and
therefore, (...), is expansum aliquid, something spread, as is, velum or
lamina, a veil or plate of metal, but has nothing common with the former
sense, but the sound, and therefore indeed has no relation to (...). It is
frequent with the Hebrews who have no such abundance of words, for one and the
same root as to the letters, to have diverse significations, according to the
pricks, and according to the diverse significations to have diverse yet proper
derivatives, which I suppose are not promiscuously communicated one to another;
or perhaps the same root or word written with the very same letters may be
Hebrew, Syriack and Arabic. And so if we may believe Schindler, this very word
(...) which signifies peplum a veil, is an Arabic word, and not an Hebrew one,
so that I cannot possibly think, that this notion ever came into the Apostles
thoughts, but that he rather endeavored to express what he meant in the most
vulgar speech and common phrase. And truly this argument of theirs seems to me
very preposterous, as if they meant to tie two extremes together without a
medium. For who with reason can affirm, Because a man is not of the woman, but
the woman of the man, etc. Therefore ought a woman to wear a veil or a hood on
her head, by an argument fetched from the moral Law of their creation? truly I
have often heard that the whole Law of God was to be known by the discourse of
reason, and was called moral, except the Sabbath, which some will not have
therefore counted moral, because it is not to be known by the discourse of
reason. But whoever could from the dictate of reason know, that a woman because
she was made of man and for man, ought therefore to wear a veil or hood on her
head especially in the Church? That she is therefore inferior to her husband,
and that therefore she ought to be subject unto him, is not abhorrent from the
discourse of reason, and because she is for that cause subject to her husband,
reason dictates she ought to acknowledge it, but by what means or sign she
should do it in the Church or elsewhere, custom seems only to have taught,
especially in Christian Churches, as the Apostle intimates in this place. For
we read not of any such custom in the Old Testament. Rebecca truly might [which
they instance for an example] when she came near to Isaac, Genesis c. 24. v. 65.
take a veil, and cover herself as well for modesty as for reverence. But Judah
thought Thamar to be an Harlot, because she covered herself with a veil, Genesis
c. 38. v. 14.15. So that from the beginning the covering of a veil was no
certain sign of subjection. And therefore I cannot but be still of the same
opinion, that it is rightly interpreted according to the order of the
arguments. Because the woman is of the man, and the man not of the woman, etc.
For this cause ought a woman to acknowledge the power in her head, that is, her
husband, according to the legitimate and known acception of the word, (...).
That is, ought to be subject to her husband, and because she is subject, ought
in sign of her subjection to be covered in the Church, because it was comely
and according to the institute of nature, v. 13, 14. As for the following
words, (...), I conceive they are properly expounded, either by or because of
the Angels, that is, by or because of the Law of their creation or the
ordinance of God, who in the first creation did create them in that order by
the Ministry of Angels, and at the same time by the same Ministry of Angels
did impose this Law of subjection upon the woman, of which the Apostle makes
mention 1 Cor. c. 14. v. 34. where the woman is commanded to be under
obedience, (...), as the Law says. Which Law all Expositors agree to be that
in Genesis c. 3. v. 16. (...), And he shall rule over thee. And this was most
certainly given by the Ministry of Angels, as was that of Moses, Act. c. 7. v.
53. Gal. c. 3. v. 19. Heb. c. 2. v. 2. For all the external works of God are
done and executed by the Ministry of Angels, whereof you may see more at large
in Note on Acts c. 7. v. 35. In conclusion, this Interpretation does flow so
naturally from the words, and has so little need of any Foreign help for its
explication, that I have a very strong presumption, its the true and genuine.

V. 21. (...). In most books, if not in all, the comma is after (...), and
accordingly Translated. But that reading and version, (...), Propriam caenam
praesumit in edendo, In eating every one takes before other his own supper, is
surely not only harsh unto the ear, but incommodious also as to the sense. For
remedy whereof I have thought it better to distinguish after (...), and it
being, as to the trajection of the copulative, (...), so frequent in the New
Testament, I cannot but wonder at those that make any scruple of it, especially
if it help us to an apter sense, and prevent an insolence of speech, as it does
in this very place, Unusquisque enim praesumit caenam propriam, and in edendo
hic quidem esurit, ille vero satur est, For every one takes his own supper
before hand, and in eating one is hungry, and another full. So as the sense and
coherence with the verse next going before and following after, and with v. 33,
34. is plainly this, When therefore ye come together in one place, that is into
the Church, it is not to eat the Lords supper [that which ye do] for every one
takes and eats his own supper first, before others are come together, and so
when ye eat, one is hungry and another full. The rich are full, but the poor
(...) (understand (...)) who have no supper of their own, are hungry. It seems
there was a custom among the richer sort of the Corinthians to anticipate the
Lords supper by eating every one their own which they brought with them
privately, before the poorer sort were come together, But this he tells them
was not to eat the Lords supper, and therefore he goes on to reprove them,
What have ye not houses to eat and drink in, but you must surfeit and debauch
(...) here? or despise you the Church of God and shame (...), them that have no
suppers? What shall I say unto you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you
not; And so at length after a digression to another discourse concerning the
Lords supper, to v. 33. he returns again to this, which he concludes with a
short monition, Wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat, that is,
the Lords Supper, tarry ye one for another, and if any man hunger let him eat
at home, that ye come not together (...), for your condemnation, that is, so as
you may be blamed for so doing.

C. 12. v. 11. (...). The Arabic Interpreter seems to have read (...).
Distribuens unicuique quod ei proprium est, prout vult, Dividing to every one
what is proper to him as he will. Rather, Dividens propria, i. e. sua
unicuique, etc. Distributing his own [gifts] to every one as he will, which is
more suitable to the sense, and to propriety of speech, (...), for its said, v.
4. (...). There are diversities of Gifts but the same spirit, And immediately
before, (...), Haec autem omnia operatur unus atque idem spiritus, But all
these works that one and the self same spirit, dividing his own to every one
as he will. (...), Ut dominus and Deus, Theophylact. They are called (...), the
Distributions, or as we Translate it, the Gifts of the holy Ghost according to
his will, Heb. 2.4. See Joh. 3.8.

V. 29. (...); These words are better conjoined and distinguished with those
that follow, v. 30. (...); Have all the power of working Miracles, have all the
gifts of healing? repeating the word (...), have, (...), as common to both. For
surely it is not proper to say, are all powers to work Miracles? as necessarily
we must, if we refer the words, to those that went before.

C. 13. v. 13. (...). Certainly these words are rendered best by a vulgar
Metathesis. And now abide these three, Faith, Hope and Charity, but the
greatest of these is Charity. (...) for (...), as (...), for (...), and (...)
for (...), which happens very frequently, to wit, that Comparatives are taken
instead of the Superlatives, as (...), Socrates was the wisest of all men, and
so you have, c. 15.19. (...) for (...), The most miserable of all men.

C. 14. v. 2. (...), Qui loquitur lingua [exotica] non loquitur hominibus sed
Deo, nemo enim intelligit, spiritu vero loquitur mysteria, For he that speaks
in an unknown tongue, speaks not unto men but to God, for no man
understands him, but with his breath he speaks mysteries. That with his
voice he speaks hidden things which are not understood of them who are but
Idiots and understand no other then their mother tongue. (...) in this place,
as spiritus likewise, is taken as (...) is often taken in the Hebrew, for
halitus, breath, the organ of the voice, Metonymically for the voice, (...),
the voice is from the lungs, as Hippocrates, yet not immediately, but by the
mediation of the breath which is caused by the lungs, and so Hesychius. (...),
Spiritus causa est pulmo. But the next cause of the voice is (...), spiritus,
the breath, and from thence it is that Phavorinus says, (...), Spiritus elatio
dictionis, Breath is the bringing forth or the conveyance of the speech, which
differs not from the very voice, For without breath the principal organ of the
voice its impossible to utter any sound. And that this is the Apostles meaning
in this place, appears by the whole series of his discourse in this present
Chapter. For it follows, v. 13. (...), Quapropter qui loquitur lingua
peregrina precetur ita ut interpretur, Wherefore let him that speaks [that
is, that prayeth] in an unknown tongue, pray so as he may interpret, that is,
that himself or some body else may interpret so that others may understand, as
it is, v. 27. And of this use of the word (...) you may see Budaeus, which also
must be necessarily taken in the same sense, Joh. c. 10. v. 17. Because I lay
down my life, (...), so as I may take it up again. He laid not his life down,
to the end he might take it up again, but in such a manner so as he might take
it up again, for as it immediately follows, He had power to lay it down, and he
had power to take it up again. And thus it follows still in the same phrase and
manner of speech, (...), Si enim precer lingua peregrina, spiritus meus
precatur, men's vero mea est infructuosa, For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my
breath [that is, my voice] prays, but my meaning is of no benefit to others,
because they understand not what I say. What therefore is to be done? v. 15.
(...), Precabor spiritu, precabor etiam cum intellectu, I will pray with my
breath or voice, and I will pray with understanding also, that is, so as I may
be understood of others. (...) with Aristophanes and in the Glossary is sensus,
meaning, as (...); Quis est horum verborum sensus? What is the meaning of these
words? And with this key its easy to open the mysteries of this Chapter, which
otherwise are hard to be understood.

V. 27. (...), Sive quis loquatur lingua peregrina, duabus vel ad maximum
tribus [scilicet linguis] fiat, idque singulatim, and unus interpretetur, quod
si non sit Interpres, sileto, Or if a man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be
in two or three [tongues] at the most, and let one interpret, But if there be
no Interpreter, let him keep silence in the Church. It is very probable, that
there might be diverse in the Church, who could speak in many tongues, but
(...), for orders sake he permitted them to use but two or three tongues at
most, and that by turns and not confusedly, nor without an Interpreter. But
whereas most interpret those words (...) of the persons, seems to me by no
means to agree with the sense or Syntax. For how one man should speak by
another man according to the scope of this place is beyond my comprehension,
(...), fiat, is familiarly understood.

V. 30. (...), etc. But if any thing be revealed unto another that sits by,
let the first hold his peace, that is, before that other speak, to whom it is
revealed, as much as to say, Let not him to whom any thing is revealed, offer
to speak, till the other who was first speaking, has made an end. For ye may
all prophecy one after another, that all may learn and all be comforted, or
exhorted, (...), The meaning of which words is, either, the spirits of the
Prophets are subordinate to the Prophets, that is, they are so mutually
subordinate one to another, that they ought not to confound one another, or
their hearers by unseasonable speaking two or more together, but to keep order
in the Churches. For God, as it follows, is not the Author of confusion, but of
peace in all the Churches of the Saints. (...), Let all things be done in
order, Or thus, The spirits of the Prophets whereby any thing is revealed to
them, are subject to those Prophets, to be guided by them, to be suppressed and
uttered when they please, so that to prevent confusion in the Church, he to
whom any thing is revealed, ought for a while to suppress his Spirit of
revelation, till he who was first speaking has made an end. Nor can I by any
means think that out of these words there can be any argument raised for the
trial of men's spirits or doctrines, a sense so generally imposed.

C. 15. v. 29. (...), Alioquinquid facient qui Baptizantur pro mortuis si
omnino mortui non resurgunt? Quid etiam Baptizantur pro mortuis, Else what
shall they do who are Baptized for dead if the dead rise not at all? Why are
they then Baptized for dead? Here is as it were a gemination of the question to
make the matter of it the more observed. As if he should say What do men do or
mean when they are Baptized? or why are men dipped under water as if dead
(...), Buried with Christ in Baptism, Romans c. 6. v. 4. Col. c. 2. v. 12. if by
rising out of the water, which is a type of the Resurrection after death, they
be not ascertained, that Christ is risen from the dead, and that they also, if
they rise from the death of sin to newness of life, shall likewise rise again
with Christ after death to glory? In vain does the Church use this sign of
Baptism, if there be not a Resurrection. For Baptism is the lively type of the
death and Resurrection of Christ, and consequently of all the faithful. And so
has it been received always by the Ancients, whereof you may see in note 1
Pet. c. 3. v. 23. And this doctrine Zonaras calls (...), Vim mysterii
Religionis Christianae, The very life and virtue of Christian Religion, plainly
affirming that they do, (...), loose their labor, who are Baptized if they
doubt of the Resurrection, in that that they demonstrate or set forth by their
Baptism, that is, by their immersion into the water, and their emersion out of
the same, their death, and Resurrection, but doubt or not believe it in their
hearts. And who so do, what they do, they do in vain. From whence you may
conclude it was the opinion of those times, that the act of immersion in the
water, in which the body is buried for dead, or as if it were dead, and the
emersion again out of the same did lively represent the real death and
Resurrection of the body, both in Infants, that could not confess the same, as
also in grown persons, though they confessed not with their mouths what they
acted in their bodies. The sign was still the same. Though it be likewise true,
that those who were grown to the years of discretion when they were Baptized,
as St Chrysostom tells us, did publicly confess, that they did believe in the
Resurrection of the dead, and were Baptized in that Faith, adding farther in
the same place, that for the better explaining of, (...) was to be understood,
that they were Baptized for dead bodies, adding yet for farther confirmation,
Thou art therefore Baptized because thou believe the Resurrection of the
body, that is, that it remains not for ever dead. And thou by word of mouth
confessest the Resurrection of the dead, and the Priest as it were in a certain
figure or representative does manifest unto thee by the things themselves, what
thou do believe and have confessed, etc. In like manner Tertullian, Pro
mortuis tingui est pro corporibus tingui, mortuum enim corpus ostendimus, To be
dipped for dead is to be dipped for dead bodies, for thereby we show our bodies to
be dead. Then which I think there can be nothing spoken plainer. And to this
opinion agrees Theodoret also upon this place, (...), He who is Baptized is
buried with the Lord, that when he has been partaker with him of death, he may
with him be also partaker of the Resurrection. But if our body die and rise not
again why is it then Baptized? And this I hold to be the proper exposition on
this place and the scope of the Apostles meaning.

C. 16. v. 3. (...). And when I shall be with you, whomsoever ye shall approve,
I will send by letter to carry your liberality to Jerusalem. In Translating of
which words, I conceive under favor there are two mistakes in the Engglish
Interpreter, First in saying, whom ye shall approve by your letters, when Paul
was come unto them, and secondly, in Translating to bring your liberality to
Jerusalem, whereas Paul was not at Jerusalem, but at Philippi, when he wrote
this Epistle to the Corinthians. Beside that, (...) does properly signify,
auferre, to carry away.

ANNOTATIONS On the II. Ep. To The Corinthians.
Chapter 1. v. 9.

(...), Immo habuimus in nobis or in nos condemnationem mortis, Yea we had the
sentence of death upon us. As if he should say, Yea we were so far in despair
of life, as even the sentence of death was past upon us, that we should not
trust in our selves, but in him who raises the dead, who delivered us from so
great a death, (...), Hesych. Phavor. and Suid. And to this so great a death
its reasonable to suppose he was adjudged by some sentence or conspiracy of the
Jews.

C. 2. v. 12. (...), etc. Quum venissem autem Troadem, and ostium mihi apertum
esset per Dominum ad Evangelium Christi, non habui requiem spiritui meo, But
when I was come to Troas, and there was a door opened to me by the Lord to the
Gospel of Christ, I had no rest to my spirit, not finding my brother Titus
there, who if present would have eased me of a great part of my burden, which
lay so heavily upon me being all alone, that I had no refreshment to my spirit,
but taking leave of them I went into Macedonia. There is nothing more familiar
then the trajection.

C. 4. v. 4. (...), etc. To make a fitting sense and a true construction, you
must Translate, the Praeposition (...), among (as commonly it is,) both in this
and the preceding verse, and the words that follow by trajection. If our Gospel
be hid, it is hid, (...), among those that are lost, among whom God has
blinded the minds of the unbelievers of this age, least the light of the
glorious Gospel of Christ, should shine unto them, that is, so shine, as that
they should see and understand. And that this is the proper rendering and
meaning of the words, I am much induced to believe, because the Apostle seems
to have a direct eye to that of Isaiah 6.10. Where the Lord bids them go and
make the ears of this people heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with
their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and be
converted. Besides (...) is properly an age, saeculum, and not the world. The
unbelievers of this age are meant, especially the Jews. As for the trajection,
besides that diverse of the Ancients did use the same in the exposition of these
words, it is so familiar in the New Testament, that I cannot but wonder that
any should scruple at it. And yet for better confirmation I shall allege an
Example or two, as Joh. 11.54. (...), for (...), He went unto a city called
Ephraim. Act. 13.1. (...), for (...), Now there were certain Prophets and
teachers in the Church that was in Antioch, and c. 25.22. (...), for (...), And
he said, to morrow thou shall hear him. Whereas it is literally, And he to morrow
said thou shall hear him. And there were some in Antioch in the Church that was
Prophets and teachers. And he went unto Ephraim which is called a City.

C. 5. v. 1. (...), Trajectio insignis, pro (...), If the earthly house of our
Tabernacle were dissolved.

C. 6. v. 13. (...). Before (...) you are to understand (...), Then which
nothing more familiar. Now according to the same compensation, (I speak to you
as my children) be ye also enlarged. As if he should have said, O ye
Corinthians our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged, Ye are not
straightened in us, but ye are straightened in your own bowels [towards us,] ye
have not the like affection for us as we have for you, As my heart therefore is
enlarged toward you, so be ye also in like manner mutually enlarged in your
bowels toward us.

C. 8. v. 1. (...). Moreover we do you to wit, or we would have you take notice
of the great gift that has been given by the Churches of Macedonia to the
Saints. He stirs up the Corinthians to the like liberal contribution by the
example of the Macedonians. (...), Hesych. (...), Phavor. (...), a goodly gift,
as we Translate (...), the goodly Cedars, Psalm. 80. v. 10. and (...), the high
or great mountains, Psalm. 36. v. 6. See note on, c. 10. v. 4. So Beza
Translates (...), beneficentiam, v. 6. And so might he have done also, v. 7.

V. 18, 19. (...), And we have sent with him the brother (whose praise is in
the Gospel throughout all the Churches, and not so only, but who was also
appointed of the Churches our fellow traveller) with this charge which is
administered by us for the glory of him who is our Lord, and your encouragement.
In the first place I thought fit to make this large Parenthesis that the
coherence might appear the better. For I thought it more rational to say, that
this Brother was sent with this charge of Ministering to the Saints, then to say
he was appointed or chosen with it. In the next place it is manifest that (...)
in this place can signify nothing but gratiam Ministerii in Sanctos, the
charge or office of Ministry to the Saints, committed to Titus and this
Brother, and to Paul himself. And so do Theophylact and the Greek Scholiast
both interpret it. As concerning (...) you may see note on Act. c. 14. v. 23.
Lastly follows (...), which I have not doubted to render, and for your
encouragement, for (...), alacritatem injicere, is to encourage. That is, that
ye may be more cheerful in giving, more forward in your beneficence, when you
see they are honest and creditable persons, who are to collect and dispense
your money, so that no man can blame us in this abundance which is administered
by us, or conceive the least suspicion of us, as if we made any private use to
our own gain of the moneys committed to us. Persons of integrity and fidelity,
and that not only one, but two or three, that the honor of God may be
preserved and not blasphemed among the Gentiles. For we provide for honest
things not only in the sight of the Lord but in the sight of men.

C. 9. v. 5. (...), Your bounty or liberal collection, from (...), colligo, to
collect. So (...) in Phavorinus is (...), An abundance of good things freely
given.

V. 8, 9, 10. (...), etc. Qui vero potens est Deus omnem gratiam faciat
abundare in vobis, ut in omnibus semper omnem sufficientiam habentes abundetis
in omne opus bonum (sicut scriptum est, dispersit, dedit pauperibus,
misericordia ejus manet, in aeternum. Qui suppeditat semen seminanti and panem
ad escam, suppeditet and multiplicet sementem vestram, and augeat fructus
misericordiae vestrae) in omni divites facti ad omnem liberalitatem, (quae
adoperatur per nos gratiarum actionem deo, quoniam ministerium oblationis hujus
non solum est adsupplens inopias sanctorum, sed etiam redundans per multas
gratiarum actiones deo) per probationem hujus ministerii glorificantes deum in
vestra subjectione, etc. But God who is able make all grace to abound toward
you, that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every
good work, (as it is written, he has dispersed abroad, he has given to the
poor, his mercy endures for ever. Let him that Ministers seed to the sower
and bread for his food, Minister and multiply your seed, and increase the
fruits of your mercy) being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness (which
works through us thanksgiving unto God, because the ministration of this
service does not only supply the want of the Saints, but does also superabound
by many thanksgivings unto God) by the experiment of this ministration
gloryfying God in your blessed subjection to the Gospel of Christ, and your
liberal distribution, etc. I see no need of Hebraism or Atticism to salve the
sense and construction in this place, for if the two Parentheses as they are
here distinguished be duly observed, the sense and Syntax is so plain that he
that runs may read and understand, the participles (...) and (...) being to be
governed of the verb (...), v. 8. I have chose to render the words in the form
of a prayer, because it is usual with St Paul, as the Fathers have observed, to
conclude his exhortations with a prayer. (...) I suppose is in this place
properly Translated mercy, as also in the Psalm from whence the words are
cited. So Theophylact interprets it on this place, (...), Misericors ab omnibus
diligitur, The mercyful man is beloved of all. And so the LXX do frequently
render (...), as you may see in note on Matthew. c. 1 19. (...) before (...) is
in this place redundant.

C. 10. v. 4. (...) Exceedingly powerful, just such another phrase, as (...),
exceeding fair, Act. c. 7. v. 20. It is Beza his animadversion, and that it is
to be expounded by an Hebraism, so (...), (...), Magna deo, magna civitas, Now
Niniveh was an exceeding great City, Jon. c. 3. v. 3. So c. 11. v. 2. (...),
that is, as the Greek Scholiast says, (...), ardenter amo vos, for I love with
an exceeding zeal. So Psalm. 80. v. 10. you have (...), (...), Cedros dei, The
goodly Cedars, and Psalm. 36. v. 6. (...), (...), Sicut montes dei, As the great
mountains. For the Scripture when it denotes any thing to be excellent, it adds
one of the names of God. As Genesis c. 30. v. 8. Colluctationes dei colluctata sum
cum sorore mea, (...). With great wrestlings have I wrestled. And 1 Samuel c. 14.
v. 16. Et factum est in trepidationem dei, (...), So it was a very great
trembling. So Jud. c. 13. v. 6. The Angel of the Lord that appeared unto the
wife of Manoah is by her termed (...), (...), in the LXX. which I conceive by
the context may be in the same manner best Translated, A goodly man, whose
countenance was very terrible, cujus species erat augustior quam hominum
communiter, who had a more noble aspect then commonly men have, as Drusius; or
Qui mirum in modum erat facie veneranda, That had a wonderful venerable face,
(...), which word (...) signifies what ever excels in quantity or quality. And
so perhaps those words Pro. c. 20. v. 27. (...), etc. (...), etc. may be better
Translated Spiritus hominis lumen valde excellens investigans omnia penetralia
ventris, The spirit of a man is a most excellent light that searches the
inward parts of the belly, that is, the secrets of the heart. Whereas the
common Translation [the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord] is an odd
expression, and somewhat difficult surely to make a good sense of.

C. 11. v. 4. (...). Seems to be spoken sarcastice, or illusorie, bitingly or
tauntingly, the word (...) being to be understood here, as I conceive it ought
to be Mar. c. 7. v. 9. (...), Ye fairly reject the commandment of God, that ye
may observe your own tradition. And so here, For if a man come, and preach unto
you another Jesus, whom we have not preached, etc. Ye would fairly suffer him,
For ye suffer a man to bring you into bondage, etc. v. 20. He reprehends their
levity, and shows them how their minds were corrupted from the simplicity or
sincerity which is in Christ, v. 3.

C. 12. v. 21. (...), Ne rursus quando venero Deus meus me vilem reddat apud
vos, Least my God when I come again make me vile among you, or in your eyes, as
before c. 10. v. 1. (...), Qui coram vilis, Who in presence am base among you.
As (...) is base or vile, so (...) is vilem reddo, to make base or vile. As if
he should say, I am afraid that as I was base and contemptible in your eyes
when I was with you before, so also when I come again God will suffer me to be
reputed vile in your eyes, and so I shall be forced to bewail many of you who
have sinned and not yet repented. He was afraid they would slight him, and
therefore take no care to repent.

C. 13. v. 5. (...), Examine your selves whether ye be in the Faith, prove your
own selves (or do ye not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you or
among you?) whether ye be not void of this proof [which ye seek in me.] This
verse and the next following verses do perfectly answer to the Apostles words
in the beginning of v. 3. The sense following necessarily, Thus, (...) ((...)
etc.) (...), etc. Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (who toward
you is not weak, etc.) examine your selves whether ye be in the Faith, prove
your own selves whether ye be not without the proof [of Christ in you,] But I
hope ye shall know that we are not without the proof of Christ speaking in us.
(...) is compounded of, a, privative, and (...), Without proof. The Apostle
plays upon the word through the whole discourse. The scope whereof to make
more clear, I shall in a short Paraphrase run through the whole discourse of
the Apostle upon this subject. He had heard that there were some among them who
did not esteem him according to the dignity of his Apostleship, but held him
for a man that walked after the flesh, c. 10. v. 2. and did not stick to say
among themselves that though his letters were weighty and powerful, yet his
bodily presence was but weak, and his speech contemptible, and from hence
assumed unto themselves a liberty of sinning more freely, not believing that he
would come at all, and therefore puffed up, 1 Cor. c. 4. v. 18, or if he did
come, that he would not come with a rod and terror, yea that were not afraid
to call his very Apostleship into question, who required (...), a proof of
Christ speaking in him. To meet therefore with the boldness of these men, and
yet not be compelled to use (which by all means he avoided) his power, with
severity, which God had given him for edification, and not for destruction, he
being absent writes thus unto them, This third time come I unto you, [in this
Epistle] because every word may be established by the mouth of two or three
witnesses, that ye may be sure without all doubt that I will come, and that
with a rod, for as I told you before when I was present with you, and as I
being absent likewise told you in my former Epistle, so do I now write again
unto you, and to those that have sinned, and to all others, that when I come
again I will not spare. But, as I hear, ye do not believe that God has
committed this power unto me, but ye account me as some contemptible person,
and therefore, (...), ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, whom ye shall
find when I come not weak, but powerful enough, for though he was crucified
because of his weakness by being man, he lives yet by the power of his
Godhead; and though we also be infirm and weak, as he was, ye yet shall feel,
that we also live by the same power of his Godhead, when we come unto you. But
since you require (...) a proof of Christ speaking in me, I pray first prove
your own selves, whether ye be not your selves without this proof, (...), ( or
is it possible when I have preached and written to you so many times that ye
should not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in or among you?) but I hope
ye shall know however, that we are not (...), without the proof of Christ in
us. But I am loath to use it, and therefore pray that ye may do no evil, (...)
understand (...), [(...)] I do not pray that we may appear with this proof of
Christ speaking in us with power, but that ye may do that which is good, and
that we our selves may be (...), as without this proof, not having need to use
our power with severity, which God has given for edification and not for
destruction, etc. And thus I suppose I have sufficiently explained the proper
meaning of (...) and (...) in this place. In the explication whereof under
favor in my weak opinion Interpreters have very much labored besides the
meaning of the Apostle.

ANNOTATIONS On the Ep. To the Galatians.
Chapter 2. v. 2, 3, 4. etc.

(...). Interpreters generally would have this place understood, as if (...),
etc. because of the false brethren who were brought in unawares and came in
privily, etc. Titus were not compelled to be circumcised, and as if these false
brethren were they, (...), etc. to whom he writes he would not give place no
not for an hour. Neither of which do I conceive to be the meaning of the
Apostle. But rather, that he communicated his Gospel which he preached among
the Gentiles privately to those of reputation, that is, to those (...) who were
reputed pillars, because of the false brethren, (...), who used to creep in
privily, (for so may (...) being a tense indefinite be lawfully interpreted)
that they might spy out the liberty they took upon them in Christ Jesus, And
that for maintenance of the truth of his Gospel which he had preached among the
Gentiles that the Mosaical Law was abrogated, least he might seem to preach or
to have preached and labored in vain, and for no other cause was Titus not
compelled to be circumcised. And therefore does Estius rightly conclude in the
voice of Paul. Quod si Apostoli, etc. If the Apostles to whom I communicated my
Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles had thought the Mosaical Law, whereof
Circumcision is a principal part had been necessary for the Christians, they
would certainly have caused Titus whom I brought with me to be circumcised,
atqui id factum non est, but that was not done, etc. Whereby he clearly
intimates his opinion, that the reason why Titus was not compelled to be
circumcised was, that the truth of Paul's Gospel might remain. And as this
reason suites best with the coherence of the Text, so does it likewise best
agree, That the Apostle did communicate his Gospel to those who were reputed
pillars in the Church (...), privately apart from the rest, of purpose, because
the false brethren who used to creep in privily into their assemblies, might
not be present to spy their debates and actions, and consequently it is to be
presumed they were not present, for whose sake the meeting was purposely
appointed private. And then how can it properly be with reason said, that Titus
was not compelled to be circumcised for their sakes, who were not at all
present, their company being purposely declined. And if this be so, then must
we without farther dispute conclude, that (...), the persons to whom, v. 5. the
Apostle thought not fit to give place no not for an hour, must be those of
reputation, the (...), v. 2. that is, to the chief Apostles, Peter, James and
John. Between whom and Paul, we may gather from the discourse of the place,
there was no small contention, probably about the circumcision of Titus, Paul
producing that to the Galatians in the first place, as it were by way of
triumph, to let them know he had the better of it. I communicated my Gospel to
them which I preach among the Gentiles. But, they were so far from having any
thing to find fault with in my preaching, (...), as Theophylact has it, that
neither was Titus who was with me being a Gentile compelled to be circumcised.
And surely there was some heat between Paul and them, concerning the
observation of Moses Law, and its possible they might be too much (...),
servants to the time, they might possibly connive at some things, least the
faithful among the Jews, (who being Zelots of the Law. Act. c. 21. v. 20.
thought they were bound to hold it fast) might chance to be offended, and so
fly back from the Christian Faith. For which their prudence Paul, as the Greek
Scholiast has observed in his praise, has not stuck to call them, (...),
persons of reputation, or of great esteem, worthy of reprehension, and
dissemblers who walked not aright, so that he may establish the Gospel of
Christ. Now to these chief Apostles who were reputed Pillars, it was, that Paul
thought not fit to yield, as he after says, that he resisted Peter to the
face, v. 11. Neither ought we to think so meanly of our Apostle, as if he would
on any terms have yielded to the false brethren, though possibly he might have
done it to the chief Apostles, whom he knew to be at least (...), of equal
honor, and Ministers of the same Spirit and Gospel with him. In sum,
Transpose but (for your present understanding) those words, (...), after the
word, (...), and I conceive the sense runs most perfectly clear. And I went up
by revelation, and communicated to them the Gospel which I preach among the
Gentiles, least by any means I should run, or had run in vain, Yea neither was
Titus who was with me being a Gentile compelled to be circumcised, but
privately to them of reputation, and that because of false brethren unawares
brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
Jesus that they might bring us into bondage. To whom we gave place by
subjection no not for an hour, that the truth of the [or my] Gospel might
continue with you. To whom, relating, to them of reputation, and not, to the
proximum antecedens, which is not at all times necessary. If any demand what
means (...), by, or according to revelation. For my part I think there is no
necessity to run to any vision by day or night, but that (...) does here
signify some Revelation or Manifestation which had been made unto him either
by fame or word or Letter, that there was a rumor at Jerusalem that he taught
a doctrine differing from the Apostles, of which James gave him notice in
express words, Act. c. 21. v. 21. (...), etc. They have heard of thee, that
thou teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses,
saying that they ought not to Circumcise their children, neither to walk after
the customs of their Fathers. For which rumors sake perhaps it is said, Act.
c. 20. v. 22. Behold I am (...), obstrictus animo, resolved in my mind to go to
Jerusalem, what ever becomes of me to testify (as follows) the grace of God,
but whether that journey and this were (...) at one and the same time I cannot
determine, but it is certain he went for one and the same cause to testify and
vindicate his Gospel which he had preached among the Gentiles. In the last
place come to be considered the words that follow; (...). In the explication of
which words there is no need of any figure or other supplement then is common
in the Testament. Understanding (...) before (...), the like whereto you have
Joh. c. 16. v. 17. (...), for (...), Dixerunt discipuli, as the vulgar Latin,
Then said some of the disciples, And Act. c. 21. v. 16. (...), for (...), Then
came with us some of the disciples. The same construction Beza and Grotius both
allow, Matthew. c. 27. v. 9. (...), for (...), Filii Israel. The phrase it self
is frequent, as (...), The Platonicks, (...), The Plebeians, (...), Those that
are of the Faith, Gal. c. 3. v. 7. And (...), Certain of the sect of the
Pharisees, etc. So as you may very lawfully Translate, Qui vero videbantur esse
aliquid, qualescunque tandem illi fuerint, nihil mea interest, But what ever
they were, who seemed to be something, it is no matter to me, God accepts no
man's person. Or it may be Translated thus with regularity and sense enough,
distinguishing only after (...). Nihil vero ab iis, qui videbantur esse
aliquid, qualescunque illi fuerint, mea interest, But nothing from those who
seemed to be something, what ever they were, concerns me at all. That is,
nothing that they either said or did concerns me, for as it follow, (...), They
that seemed to be something added nothing to me.

V. 19. (...), For I through the Law am dead to the Law, that is, by the
knowledge of the Law do know that by the Law there is no life, and therefore to
the Law acknowledge my self dead, that I may live unto God.

C. 3. v. 20. (...). The best Expositor of these words without comparison is
the Aethiopick Interpreter. Deus tamen unus est duorum, But God is one of the
two. Wherefore then is the Law that was ordained by the Angels by the hand of a
Mediator? But a Mediator is not a Mediator of one party alone, it being
necessary that there be two parties between whom there is a Mediator. Now one
of these two parties (between whom there was a Mediator to convey the Law) is
God. Neither can there be any other intelligible sense rendered of the words.
What is the unity or simplicity of the essence of God to the scope of the
place, or the Apostles purpose? But if he say that God is (...) one of the two
between whom Moses was a Mediator, the sense is obvious, do not the promises
of that very God which he gave to Abraham, fight with the Law, he gave by the
hand of Moses? God forbid, etc. How Moses was this Mediator between God and
the children of Israel you may find punctually recorded, Levit. c. 26. v. 46.
(...), etc. Haec sunt lex quam dedit Dominus inter se and filios Israel in
monte Sina per manum Mosis, These are the Law which the Lord gave between him
and the children of Israel in mount Sina (...) by the hand of Moses, the very
phrase used in this place.

ANNOTATIONS On the Ep. To the Ephesians.
Chapter 1. v. 7, 8.

(...), Secundum divitias gratiae ipsius quam abundare fecit in nobis,
According to the riches of his grace which he has made to abound in us in all
wisdom and prudence. (...) is to be understood here in the Hebrews Hiphil, as
(...) is 2 Cor. c. 9. v. 8. (...), is a common phrase with the Greeks, who
according to the Atticks do put the Relative in the same case with the
Antecedent, as, (...), and (...), Coram Deo cui credidit, Before God whom he
believed, Romans c. 4. v. 17.

C. 2. v. 1. (...). Of what word, (...), you, should be governed, I conceive,
there has been a long mistake by reason of the incommodious distinction of the
Chapters. Most Interpreters after (...), vos, you, add of their own the verb,
vivificavit, has he quickened to supply the sense. One affirms that this
Accusative, (...), you, is governed of (...), has he quickened, v. 5. by a
chain of figures. For he says, there is in this place an Hyperbaton, and a
Synchysis, an Apocope, or cutting short of the Period, which is a kind of an
Anantopodoton, the cause of which anomaly or irregularity, is the interjection
of some long sentence. But to what end serves all this pomp of figures? What
need is there of them in a matter which if duly observed, is not at all
obscure? For look but back to the Nineteenth verse of the foregoing Chapter,
and you shall find, sense, coherence and construction extremely plain and safe
without supplement or figure, (...), etc. And what is the exceeding greatness
of his power toward us who believe () and toward you who were dead in
trespasses and sins. The intervenient words, (...), etc. According to the
working of his mighty power, etc. to the end of that Chapter being all properly
included in a Parenthesis. To this I cannot imagine any thing to be objected but
the length of the Parenthesis, it being of it self not only plain but extremely
fit and proper, not to say, necessary. But I beseech you is not the Parenthesis
altogether as long, if (...), you, be governed of (...), has he quickened, v.
5. and the construction much more harsh? see also, Romans c. 1. v. 1. etc. unto
the 7, and c. 2. where, v. 13, 14, 15, are all included in one Parenthesis, not
much shorter then this. Besides many other places in which you may find
Parentheses well near as long, but much more perplexed and intricate. Nay no
less then a whole Chapter has been allowed to a Parenthesis by no mean
Judgment. In the mean while you may observe, what obscurity this importune
division of the Chapters causes to the Text. And where it brings not
obscurity, it is yet an unhansom fraction dividing matter that is coherent. As
you may see in Colos. c. 4. v. 1. which in all reason should have been joined
to the foregoing Chapter. Coherent cum superioribus neque scindenda fuere, Grot.

C. 3. v. 10. (...), That now may be known to principalities and powers the
manifold wisdom of God in heavenly things throughout the Church. Things that
pertain to the leading of an eternal life in heaven, Joh. c. 3. v. 12. Ephesians. c.
1. v. 3. They are called (...), heavenly things though done on earth, as
Chrysostom observes in another place. Whereas some interpret the Principalities
and Powers to be the Angels, methinks is far from the scope of the place. For
to what intent or advantage were it, if perhaps by the preaching of the Gospel
many mysteries of Christianity might be made known unto the Angels, which to
them were hid before? This grace v. 8. was given to Paul to make known these
things. But Paul had no Commission to preach unto the Angels, neither did he
but to the Princes of the Gentiles. Others object that the Gospel was not known
to the Princes of the Gentiles, or to earthly Powers till the days of
Constantine, and that therefore the (...), now Principalities and Powers must
be meant the Angels. But if it were not known, surely it might have been. I
beseech you who were Herod, Faelix, Festus and Agrippa, the Magistrates at
Philippi, Thessalonica and Athens? were they not all (...), Principalities and
Powers? of whom speaks Paul when he admonishes Titus to be subject (...), to
Principalities and Powers? were not these earthly Magistrates? Could not then
the Gospel be known to all? Nay was it not preached to all, and was it not
known to all though some rejected it?

C. 4. v. 26. (...), Be angry and sin not. There is no doubt but the Apostle
borrowed these words of the Psalmist, from the Greek Interpreters, Psalm. 4. v.
4. though Beza and our English Interpreter have made no reference thereto in
the margin. The reason whereof I suppose is, because they did otherwise
interpret the Hebrew, as have many others, reading, Contremiscite and nolite
peccare, Stand in awe and sin not. But I rather assent to Musculus who retains
the vulgar reading in the Psalm, Irascimini and nolite peccare, Be ye angry and
sin not, ductus Autoritate Pauli, being thereunto led by the Authority of St
Paul. Besides that the Hebrew (...), signifies not only to stand in awe but
also to be angry, a man's passion is as well moved for anger as for fear, for
even anger makes a man to tremble. Neither have we Paul's Authority alone for
the reading but his exposition of the sense. For the words following of St Paul
are mere Paraphrase on the words following in the Psalmist, both agreeing in
one and the same sense, (...), Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath, neither
give place to the Devil, says the Apostle, (...), Dicite in cordibus vestris
super cubilia vestra, quieto estote animo, Commune with your hearts upon your
beds, and be still, says the Psalmist. As if the meaning of both were this, If
perhaps it happen that ye are angry, neither is any passion quicker, take heed
ye sin not by being angry longer then is fit, let not your anger abide till the
going down of the Sun, neither make ye that Devil a nightly guest, suffering
him to lodge with you, but chase him away, let him vanish before ye go to bed,
that on your beds ye may be still and quiet, in a posture to commune with your
selves, to say your prayers in your hearts, as the Chaldee has it, plainly
showing how comfortable, how necessary a thing it is for our thoughts to be
free for our pious meditation, when we are newly laid in our beds, to which
nothing is a greater enemy then to have any exacerbation rest upon our spirits.
The vulgar and Greek Translation render (...) compungimini in this place. For
the Hebrew is (...), which Pagnin and others Translate, Et tacete, And hold
your peace, but (...), signifies to be quiet, as well as to hold ones peace,
and so reads Aquila, (...), quieti estote, and be still, as we render it. So
with Hesychius, (...).

C. 6. v. 20. (...), Pro quo legatione fungor in vinculis, For which I am an
Ambassador in bonds. But why may it not be more properly translated, Pro quo
senesco in vinculis, For which I wax old in bonds. So Paul styles himself
Philem. v. 9. (...), Paulus senex and vinctus, Paul the aged and a prisoner of
Jesus Christ. According to the most proper signification of the word.

Circumcisio erat octiduana, My circumcision was the eight day, ut pateat, as

Proselyte, Ex gente fui Israelis, I was of the stock of Israel, Ut pateat neque

born of Prosylite parents, etc. So that if any had cause to have confidence in

perfect, let us be thus minded, and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God
will reveal, or God reveal this also to you (besides what ye have already
attained unto) to walk by the same rule, to mind the same thing. The Future
Indicative for the Imperative is a frequent Hebraism. But whereas Interpreters
do generally Translate (...) and (...) in the Imperative in the first person
plural, Eadem incedamus regula, idem sentiamus, Let us walk by the same rule,
let us mind the same thing, alleging it to be an Atticism, truly when I cannot
find such another Atticism in all the New Testament, and when I see no
necessity at all for pretending such a figure in this place nor advantage to
the mending of the sense thereby, I thought it better to Translate them in the
Infinitive according to the usual manner of speech, it being as I conceive, not
only more Grammatical, but more agreeable also to the Apostles purpose. For as
I have heretofore more then once observed out of the Fathers, that it is the
Apostles custom, to conclude his exhortations with a wish or prayer, so when he
had exhorted them here to be so minded as he himself was, he presently prays or
wishes that God would reveal this also to them, besides the knowledge they had
already attained to, to walk all by the same rule that he himself walked, and
to be of the same mind that he was, that they might be followers of him, and
observe those who took him for their example, whose conversation was already in
heaven, etc.

with salt. Undertake not unseasonable contentions, but give to every one the
reverence which to him is due, so as you injure not your own souls. Hear Paul
himself speaking to Agrippa: I think my self happy because I shall answer for

V. 16. (...). There is no need with Grotius to vary the reading by leaving out
(...) contrary to the testimony of all copies, when as it is (...) dictum
rightly said as it is in the Old Latin, Et eam quae est Laodicensium vos
legatis, And read ye that of Laodicea, not that which was written from Laodicea
to them, but which was written from the Apostle to the Laodiceans, which why or
how it is lost as is that other to the Corinthians, and another to the
Ephesians, as also other books of Scripture, is known to God alone. For the
phrase is frequent, as, (...), some of the Synagogue, (...), the Faithful,
(...), the Stoics, (...), the night winds are grievous.

ANNOTATIONS On the I. Ep. To the Thessalonians.
Chapter 2. v. 16.

(...), But the wrath of God is come upon them in the end. They have killed
Jesus and their own Prophets, and they have persecuted us, neither care they
for God, but are contrary to all, forbidding us to preach unto you that ye
might be saved, but the vengeance of God is come upon them in the end. Their
measure was full, and the Destruction of Jerusalem was at hand.

ANNOTATIONS On the II. Ep. to The Thessalonians.
Chapter 2. v. 3.

(...). It is in all copies distinguished after (...), which does so confound
the Grammatical construction, that no true interpretation can be given of the
words, which is easily reconciled by this distinction after (...), plainly
thus, That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit,
nor by word, nor by letter as from us, (...), as that the day of Christ is at
hand, (...), understand (...) by a common repetition. Let no man deceive you by
any means, that it is at hand, (...), unless there come a falling away first,
and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition. It Is true Interpreters
make a shift to make out the sense, but they take no thought of the Syntax. For
what can be the meaning of, (...), I must confess is beyond my Fathom.

V. 7. (...). After (...) understand (...). Jam enim mysterium operatur
iniquitatis; tantum est qui ad praesens obstat, vel impedit, donec e medio
fiat, For the mystery of iniquity works already, only there is one who
hinders, [that is, the working of it,] till he be taken out of the way. Tantum
est qui nunc obstat, Only there is one who hinders. Quis nisi Romanus status?
Who but the Roman state? Tertullian. Non absurd de Romano imperio creditur
dictum, It Is not unfitly thought to be spoken of the Roman Empire, August. Hunc
locum exponunt de Imperio Romano, quo soluto fit venturus Antichristus, Erasm.
and many others.

ANNOTATIONS On the I. Ep. To Timothy.
Chapter 1. v. 3.

(...), etc. (...) being accented with a Circumflex in the middle syllable, the
Imperative (...) or (...) is to be understood, for by a familiar Elleipsis the
Infinitive is frequently put for the Imperative, as you may see, Act. c. 1. v.
4. and elsewhere. But if it be accented with an Acute in the third from the
end, (...), as perhaps it ought, for the accents are not the Authors, then is
it the Imperative Aorist of the middle voice, which is frequently used in the
Old Testament, so that either of these two ways the Anantapodosis is taken
away, neither is any supplement necessary of our own, such as is that vide ut
denunties, or so do, in the English. The Syntax being plain, As I besought, or
advised thee, abide thou a while at Ephesus as thou go into Macedonia, that
thou may charge some that they teach no other doctrine, etc.

C. 2. v. 6, 7. (...). It is a wonder to consider, how the unhappy pointing of
the words, and the unseasonable division of the verses has made Interpreters
destroy the sense and meaning of this place, and yet make no good construction
neither, whenas pointed and distinguished as they ought, the sense is
excellently good and the construction plain and easy, thus, (...), etc. The
sense running entirely thus, (...), v. 5. etc. Unus enim est Deus, unus etiam
mediator Dei and hominum, homo Christus Jesus, qui dedit semetipsum
redemptionis precium pro omnibus, ipsum testimonium, cujus ego proprio tempore
constitutus sum praedicator and Apostolus, etc. For there is one God, and one
Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for
all, the very Gospel, unto which in due time I was ordained a Preacher and an
Apostle, etc. (...) is doubtless here Appositive, taken as they call it, (...),
or materialiter. As if he should say, the sum or whole matter of the Gospel,
[for so (...) is often used by our Apostle, as 1 Cor. c. 1. v. 6. c. 2. v. 1. 2 Timothy c. 1. v. 8, 10, 11. and elsewhere] whereof I am ordained a Preacher,
consists in the knowledge of one God, and one Mediator Jesus Christ, who
gave himself a ransom for all. (...) is applied in the very same sense, Tit. c.
1. v. 3. As for the trajection of the words there is nothing more familiar.

V. 10. (...). The Parenthesis is best pretermitted as in Stephanus, before
(...) is (...) to be understood. Sed quemadmodum decet mulieres quae pietatem
spondent per bona opera, But as it becomes women who promise or profess piety
by their good works. It is neither proper sense or Greek to say, (...), which
should have been rather written with the Preposition (...) and the Dative case,
as in the foregoing words, with which according to that interpretation it ought
to agree, (...), etc, (...). The whole context running thus, I will therefore
that men pray, etc. In like manner that women adorn themselves in modest
apparel, with shamefaceness and sobriety, not with broidered hair, or gold, or
pearls or costly array, but as it becomes women professing Godliness by their
good works.

V. 15. (...). Interpreters for the most part render it, Salvabitur vero per
liberorum generationem, But she shall be saved by the Generation of children,
our own Translation says, by child bearing. But what thereby they mean I
comprehend not, unless they understand the Generation of the Son, the seed of
the woman that shall bruise the serpents head, by which both Adam and Eve and
all their offspring shall be saved, if they continue in Faith and Charity. He
begins in the Singular number, and concludes in the Plural, the like changes of
number being very frequent. You may see in particular, 1 Cor. c. 5. v. 12.

C. 4. v. 1, 2. (...), etc. Attendentes spiritibus erroris and doctrinis
daemoniorum in hypochrysi loquentium mendacium, etc. Giving heed to seducing
spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their
conscience seared with a hot iron. But the Syntax of the words cannot bear
these Translations. For (...) is in casu recto as Mr Mede has excellently
observed, but (...), etc. in the Genitive, so that they cannot be governed one
of another and so construed without breach of Grammar unsampled in Paul's
Epistles as that Author says. Though learned Beza faintly salves it by
conniving at it as a Solaecism, with a, Major est habita sententiae quam
constructionis ratio, The Apostle had more regard to the sense then to the
construction, whenas in truth there is no sense without the true construction.
For if you shall say they must refer to (...), daemoniorum, devils, what a
strange sense is that to say that devils should speak lies in hypocrisy, and
have their conscience seared? And therefore to salve these irregularities and
absurdities, he undeniably concludes, that the Genitives (...), (...), (...)
are all governed by (...), and that (...) here does signify causam or modum
actionis, the cause or manner of the action, so that the proper and genuine
Translation must be thus, Attendentes Spiritibus erroris and doctrinis
daemoniorum, per hypochrysim falsiloquorum, etc. Giving heed to seducing
Spirits and doctrines of devils through or by the hypocrisy of such as tell
lies, that have their conscience seared with a hot iron, and forbid to marry,
etc. The Aethiopick reads, Doctrinae Satanicae, Devilish doctrines, as we
Translate (...), Injustus Oeconomus, The unjust Steward and the like, or it may
be in the sense of Mr Mede, doctrines concerning demons, as (...), The
doctrine of baptismes, that is, concerning baptismes, Heb. c. 6. v. 2. and
(...), The Faith of the Son of God, that is, concerning the Son of God, Gal. c.
2. v. 20. Or if you will, Concerning Idols, For so (...) is put for Idola,
Idols, Psalm. 96. v. 5. in the LXX. And so perhaps it might be well interpreted,
1 Cor. c. 10. v. 20. and elsewhere. The meaning being this, that through the
hypocrisy of lying teachers, that have seared consciences, etc. Many shall
depart from the Faith, giving heed to spirits of error, and devilish
doctrines, or doctrines concerning demons or Idols, such as are worshipping of
Saints, etc. Castalio had probably the same observation concerning the
inconvenience of the construction, as the words are commonly Translated, and
therefore renders them in the same manner as Mr Mede, Per simulationem hominum
falsiloquorum, Through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, and have their
conscience seared. His note upon this place being this, Hominum, addidi, ne
falsiloquorum and sequentia referrentur ad daemonia, I have added, men, least
speaking lies and that which follows, might be referred to devils.

V. 3. (...), etc. I marvail that our late Interpreters take no heed at all to
what the Greek Scholiast has observed on these words. To wit, that there is in
them no (...), fault in the copy as some would have it, nor (...), slip or
oversight of the Apostle, as others, but that they were spoken (...), properly
according to a genuine Atticism, such as is, (...), Prohibuit furari, He forbad
to steal, (...), Vetuit actum nefandorum, He forbad the doing of what was unfit
to speak, (...) in this place being to be repeated (...), Forbidding marriage,
forbidding meats, For to words which are in themselves negative Atticks add a
negation, as (...); Quis est mendax nisi qui negat Jesum esse Christum? Who is
a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? 1 John c. 2. v. 12.
Whereas the literal interpretation is, Who is a liar but he who denies, (...),
that Jesus is not the Christ? So that we may with modesty say, that though the
word [commanding] as it is supplied, does express the meaning of the place
sufficiently, yet is it not according to rules of Grammar.

C. 5. v. 4. (...), But if any widow has children or nephews, let them first
learn to be pious to their own house, and to requite their parents. (...) is
all one with, parents revereri, to reverence their parents, for as Stephanus
tells us (...) does sometime signify pietatis officio fungi erga parents, to
perform the duties of piety to ones parents. For there is a piety toward
parents, as well as toward God. And in that sense, it is said in Virgil, Sum pius
Aeneas, he was called pious Aeneas, for his piety to his Father Anchises, in
that he carried him away being aged on his back at the firing and destruction
of Troy. And so you have in Cicero 3. Offic. Ipsi patriae conducit pios habere
cives in parents, It is behoveful for the common wealth to have citizens pious
to their parents. And in Quintil. Praestanda pietas parentibus, Piety is to be
performed to parents.

V. 13. (...), etc. The Old Latin Traslates it right, Simul autem and otiosae
discunt circumire domos, And withal being idle they learn to wander about from
house to house. Though Beza is pleased to blame this version, saying it was an
harsh Enallage, forgetting himself I suppose that with the Greeks the
participle is frequently put for the Infinitive with words that signify any
affection of the mind, as (...), Memini vidisse, I remember that I saw it. And
I hope it cannot be denied but (...), to learn, does signify an affection of
the mind as well as (...), to remember.

V. 23. (...), etc. Drink no longer water, etc. This verse seems to have crept
into this place besides the meaning of the Apostle, by some accident. Perhaps
it was added in the margent, and by the inadvertency of the Transcriber
inserted in its wrong place. For the 22 and 24 v. cohere punctually together.
(...), etc. Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's
sin, keep thy self clear, that is, be not guilty of their sin, for some men's
sins are manifest before hand, preceding to Judgment, that is which go before
the laying on of hands, of which he may possibly judge who lays on his hands,
wherefore he cannot be excused from the guilt of those sins if he lays on his
hands: and some they follow after, that is, their sins are not manifest till
after Judgment or laying on of hands, and of these there can be no certain
Judgment, and therefore he shall not be guilty or partaker of them, who lays
on his hands, and this is the sense of Chrysostom. So as the 23. v. seems to
have been inserted by some mistake, (...), Phavor, Purus, inscius, Pure, or
ignorant of.

C. 6. v. 2. (...), They who are to partake of their well doing, or honest
labor. The sense running thus, They that have believing Masters, let them not
despise them, because they are brethren, but let them rather serve them,
because they who are to partake, or have the benefit, of their work, are
believers and beloved. Or (...) may be taken in the common acception of the
word, that is, beneficii, who are to partake of the benefit, to wit, of their
service.

V. 5. (...), Existimantium pietatem esse quaestum or mercaturam, as the
Arabic Translater renders it. Supposing that Godliness is a trade to get by,
or a way or means to get a living. He speaks of those that profess Religion
that they may thereby grow rich or get a living. Yet Godliness with contentment
is mercatura magna (...), a great or sure way to get by. Whereas they who make
have to be rich, by the pretense of Religion, fall into temptations and a
snare, for the love of money is the root of all evils, v. 10. (...), ipsa actio
comparandi and acquirendi. Modus victus quaerendi seu quaestus faciendi, Steph.
(...), Dicunt enim duobus tantum uti modis faciendi quaestum, agricultura and
parsimonia, Plut. They used but two ways of getting, tillage and patrimony or
thrift. So quaestus is a craft or trade to get by, Vall. Cicer. Plaut. etc.

ANNOTATIONS On the Ep. To The Hebrews.
Chapter 1. v. 3. (...), etc. Certainly (...) in this place is somewhat more then
single (...), as it is commonly Translated, Splendour ejus gloriae, The
brightness of his glory. For (...) is as it were (...), A brightness shining
from the glory of God, relucentia or refulgentia, quod ex alio resplendet, as
Erasmus and Vatablus; so with Phavorinus (...) is (...), Fulgor vel splendour
emicans, A brightness springing or darting from another body, radius gloriae
dei, as the Syriack Interpreter has it. A beam of the glory of God, the very
character of his person, (...), light of light, as the Greek Scholiast observes
upon the place. (...), Refulgentia aeternae lucis, speculum sine macula
virtutis dei, and Imago bonitatis ejus, The refulgence of the eternal light,
the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the Image of his goodness, as
wisdom is styled, Wisd. of Sol. c. 7. v. 26. or as it is there immediately
before, (...), Emanatio gloriae omnipotentis, A pure influence flowing from the
glory of the Almighty, as we read it in the English.

V. 4. (...), Tanto superior factus Angelis, Being made so much superior then
the Angels. (...), Minus seu inferius a superiore benedicitur, The lesser or
the inferior is blessed of the superior, c. 7. v. 7. So we read in Philemon
(...)
(...).
Bonam uxorem decet non superiorem esse viro, sed obedientem, A good wife must
not be superior but obedient to her husband.

V. 7. (...), Who makes his Angels, his spirits and his ministers, a flame of
fire. The scope of these words is to show how much Christ was superior to the
Angels, in setting forth the inferiority of their office, in that they were but
the Spirits and Messengers of God. Whereas Christ his Throne was from
everlasting for ever and ever, God was to him a Father, and he to God a Son.
But as concerning the Angels he says, Qui facit Angelos suos, Spiritus and
Ministros suos, flammam ignis, Who makes his Angels, his Spirits and his
Messengers, a flame of fire. That the words should be thus Translated, I gather
from this, In that the Apostle calls them, v. 14. (...), Ministering Spirits
jointly, whom he here calls (...), his Spirits and his Ministers dividedly.
(...), a flame of fire, I conceive to be Appositive to the foregoing words. As
if he should say, That he made his Angels his Ministers sometimes in the shape
of a flame of fire, as Exodus c. 3. v. 2 (...), And the Angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a flame of fire. It being frequent in the Scripture for
the Angels to put on diverse shapes and forms according to the nature of the
employment which God commands them.

C. 2. v. 5. (...), For unto the Angels has he not put in subjection the [or
rather this] world to come, whereof we now speak, (...) for (...). The world to
come whereof he now speaks cannot be meant to be other, then the age of the
world wherein the dispensation of Salvation v. 3. began by Christ and his
Apostles, which was not now subject or committed to the Ministration of Angels,
as was the Law in former time, which was ordained by Angels, Act. c. 7. v. 53.
Gal. 3. v. 19. For before Faith came, (...), We were kept under the Law shut up
unto the Faith which was to come [in this world whereof he now speaks] to be
revealed. But now the administration thereof is subject to the Kingdom of
Christ by the preaching of the Gospel, in the latter times with signs and
wonders, (...), and diverse powers, which he calls, c. 6. v. 5 (...), the
powers of the world or age to come, which as I said before, can be no other
then, Saeculum salutis, and mundus Evangelii, The age of Salvation, and the
world of the Gospel.

C. 5. v. 7. (...), Et exauditus est a metu suo, i. e. servatus a metu suo, And
was saved from his fear. So heard that he was freed from the same. So Psalm. 55.
v. 16. Where the Hebrew is (...), The Greek Interpreters have, (...), I will
call upon God and the Lord shall save me. And so the Arabic, and Aethiopick
both Translate it, Et dominus exaudivit me. As also, 2 Chronicles. c. 18. v. 31. The
word (...), which signifies in Hebrew opitulatus est, he has helped me, the
LXX Translate (...), as it is in Wechelus his edition. And Jehosaphat cried
unto the Lord, and the Lord helped him, (...), The Lord heard him so that he
saved him. So the Roman edition reads, (...), And the Lord saved him. The
phrase is not unlike in our own Translation, Psalm. 22. v. 21. For thou have
heard me from the horns of the Unicorn, that is, thou have or wilt save me from
the horns of the Unicorn.

C. 6. v. 1, 2. etc. (...), etc. Quapropter linquentes prima elementa Christi
provehamur ad perfectionem, non rursum jacientes fundamentum resipiscentiae ab
operibus mortuis and fidei in Deum, etc. Therefore leaving the principles of
the doctrine of Christ, let us be carried on to perfection, not laying again
the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of Faith in God, of the
doctrine of baptism, and laying on of hands, and of the Resurrection of the
dead and eternal judgment. And this will we do, or let us do if God permit, for
it is impossible to renew again unto Repentance those who have been once
enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and been partakers of the holy
Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
come, and shall fall away, crucifying to themselves the Son of God afresh, as
much as in them lies, and putting him to open shame. He reprehends them in the
former Chapter, v. 12, 13. For that when for the time they ought to have been
teachers, they had need that one should teach them again which were the first
principles of the Oracles of God, that they were become babes again and had
need of milk. In these words therefore he exhorts them, that they should not
return again to learn the fundamentals of Religion, such as were the doctrines
of Repentance, of Faith in God, and of baptism, etc. But that they should
strive forward to perfection, perfection which consisted in perseverance. For
this he says he urges to no other end, v. 11, 12. but that they should show
their diligence ad pleniorem spei certiorationem, to the fuller assurance of
their hope unto the end, and that they be not slothful, but followers of them
who through Faith and patience inherit the promises, he would not have them
Apostatize from the Faith, and fall away crucifying againg the Son of God, etc.
For then how hard it will be to restore such again, the following words
sufficiently declare, (...), etc. For it is impossible to renew them again unto
Repentance, etc. In which place impossible is put for extremely difficult, as
Christ says in the Gospel, It is impossible, (...), for a rich man to enter
into the kingdom of heaven, that is, (...) in the opinion of men, or with men
it may seem impossible. And from this impossibility or difficulty of restoring
such a one, it is worth the observing, that Apostates were always the most
implacable and deadly enemies of the Christian Religion. But he adds a reason
of this impossibility, Nam terra quae generat herbam, etc. For the earth which
brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receives blessing from
God, but that which bears thorns and briars is (...), inutilis, unprofitable,
without any show of its fructification, and therefore, (...) and (...), as
Hesychius, (...), as the Fig tree, Luke c. 13. v. 9. nigh unto cursing, whose
end is to be burned. But from this similitude one may gather, that it is not
plainly impossible to renew such persons to repentance, but it notes a labor
or difficulty in doing of it, for if the husbandman shall with care and
diligence thoroughly weed these thorns and briars out of his ground, it is not
to be despaired but that this (...) unprofitable ground, may yet in due time
bring forth herbs meet for the use of man. It denotes a difficulty scarce to be
conquered, yet conquerable, it is not (...) or (...), extremo sensu, to be
rejected in the utmost sense, it is only vicina ad interitum, nigh unto
destruction, if the grace of God intervene, it is of power to deliver it from
the fire, it can extirpate the sinful corruptions of the flesh, it can change
the hardness and barrenness of the heart, and make it fruitful to good works,
it can give place for Repentance, and give the thing itself. And that this is
the proper meaning of this place, the scope of the Epistle argues, which
principally intends or makes it its whole business to stablish the Hebrews firm
and persevering in the Faith, and to keep them from Apostasy, to which they
were too prone, not only because of persecution, but also for that they had
been so long accustomed to the Ceremonies of the Mosaical Law, which they saw
God suffered still to remain in his holy Temple, that they could not totally
without reluctance free themselves from observance of them, and rely on Christ
alone. And for this cause he so often exhorts them in this Epistle, that they
hold the beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end, c. 3. v. 14. that
they hold fast their profession, c. 4. v. 14. that they hold fast the
profession of their Faith without wavering, c. 10. v. 23. And this exhortation
he strengthens with arguments from the excellency of the promise, and the
credit of the promiser. Whatever he inlargeth in this Epistle of the Law, of
its types and ceremonies, of their invalidity and abrogation, of the excellency
of Christ, and Faith in him, so frequently and so sublimely, tends all unto
this one end, that he may fix their Faith steadfastly in Christ, that they might
run with perseverance the race which was set before them, c. 12. v. 1. that
they might not be wearied and faint in their minds, v. 3. etc. Here is one
thing more observable, and that is, an eminent trajection in the words, as we
have before Translated them, neither can they be regularly Translated any other
way. (...), etc. (...), etc. For it is impossible to renew them again to
repentance who have been once enlightened, etc. and shall fall away, crucifying
to themselves the Son of God afresh, etc. The division of the verses having
made the Translation not so proper and Grammatical, though yet it has
generally expressed the sense.

C. 7. v. 1. (...), etc. Whilst I was long sticking in the interpretation of
this place, I by chance happened at length upon Cunaeus, who treats purposely
of Melchizedec, lib. 3. c. 3. de Rep. Heb. from whom (being a person of so
eminent a name) I expected to be satisfied in all my doubts; But when I had
attentively read him over, I became more uncertain then before, or at least not
at all edified in my judgment: For he confidently determines contrary to the
general opinion of the Fathers, and of all later Interpreters, that Jesus the
Son of God was the very same Melchizedec who met Abraham, etc. Genesis c. 14.
being clothed in a humane shape, with a habit of a high Priest and King. His
opinion being fixed in this foundation, Melchisedeci Sacerdotium a D. Paulo
perpetuum atque infinitum constitui, That the Priesthood of Melchizedec was by
St Paul determined to be infinite and perpetual, because its said, v. 3. that
he remains a Priest for ever, and v. 8. that it is witnessed of him that he
lives. From whence he necessarily concludes, Si Messiam atque Melchisedecum
non esse unum eundemque sed duos credimus, etc. If we believe that the Messiah
and Melchizedec were not one and the same, but two persons, then must there be
two Priests, whose function, circumscribed with no space of years, indures for
ever. Which certainly none of the Ancient nor later Interpreters yet ever so
much as dreamed of. And if this be not the true and genuine meaning of the
words of St Paul, there is an end of interpreting the Epistle to the Hebrews,
Thus Cunaeus. But when this opinion has been exploded from all Antiquity unto
Cunaeus his time, so that learned Beza stuck not to pronounce them that held
it, aperte Fanaticos, notorious Fanatics, I shall use no other argument to
refute it, but what Epiphanius used of old, (...), Neque enim sibi ipsi similis
appellari quisquam potest, For no man can be said to be like himself. For to
say, that the Son of God was made like unto the Son of God, as it is said, v.
3. or that the Son of God arises an high Priest after the likeness of the Son
of God, as it is, v. 15. or that God should swear Thou (my Son) art a Priest
for ever according to the order or similitude of my Son, as v. 21. Which
necessarily follows, if we make Jesus and Melchizedec one and the same person,
is to me so altogether unconceiveable, that I cannot but admire the confidence
of the person, when I consider his reputation. And therefore I cannot but
dissent from his opinion though never so highly prized, Confessing my self
prone toward the sense of them, who make Melchizedec a Type of Christ, although
I must ingenuously profess I do not understand, however they salve the matter,
how it can be said of Melchizedec, who as they confess, was a mortal man, in
one place, that he remains a Priest for ever, and in another, that it is
witnessed of him (by the Scripture for so I understand the word (...) in the
Apostles phrase) that he lives. I may perhaps apprehend their meaning who
refer these words by way of Allegory unto the Son of God, and it may be
consonant to my Faith, that it should be so, but it is not so to my sense and
reason how it can be so, which it is not just should be led captive without
show of demonstration, how the thing is done which they say is done, except it
be in matters of extreme necessity. For it is a safe rule and perpetually good,
Proprie semper sumenda sunt vocabula, nisi quid aliter accipere cogat, alioqui
nihil firmum erit in Scriptura, Words are always to be taken in their proper
sense, unless something necessitate to take them otherwise, else nothing will
be firm in Scripture. Riber. in Heb. But here is no such necessity in this
place. For if I be not extremely mistaken, there is yet an interpretation left,
which does reconcile these apparent difficulties in the Text fairly enough, and
also overthrow Cunaeus his opinion, by rendering and distinguishing the words in
another manner, then ever yet they have been, and that without any force to
Grammar or use of speech among the holy Penmen. To demonstrate this, I must in
the first place tell you, that these words, (...), etc. Hic enim Melchisedec,
etc. unto the end of v. 8. cannot be rightly construed and expounded but
jointly with the words foregoing, beginning, c. 6. v. 19, 20. (...), etc. Et
ingredientem usque in interiora velaminis, etc. And which enters into the
inner part of the vail, where the forerunner for us is entered Jesus, or, where
Jesus the forerunner for us is entered, being made an high Priest for ever after
the order or similitude of Melchizedec, etc. In the farther explaining whereof
you are to observe, that the word (...) is not a Relative to (...), nor to be
construed with it, but to (...), preceding immediately before, as also that
(...) is Appositive to (...), and ought to be construed separately in a
Parenthesis with the words following, unto (...), in this manner, (...). Hic
enim (ipse Melchisedec rex Salem, etc.) manet Sacerdos in perpetuum, For this
Jesus (the Melchizedec, King of Salem, Priest of the most high God, who met
Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him, to whom
also Abraham gave the tenth part of all, first being by interpretation King of
righteousness, and after that King of Salem, which is King of peace, without
Father, without Mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor
end of life, but made like unto the Son of God) abides a Priest continually.
(...) word for word, is This, that is, This man, or (...), Jesus may be
repeated, or understood. Either lawfully. In sum the meaning of the words is
this, For this Jesus, who is entered into the inner part of the vail, etc. c. 6.
v. 19, 20. being the Melchizedec (as it is elsewhere said, I am the true vine,
and that rock was Christ) that is, prefigured in Melchizedec, who was made like
unto him, in that he is called the Priest of the most high God, King of
righteousness and peace, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,
attributes congruous only to the Son of God, I say, this Jesus, according to
the true and genuine interpretation of the words, abides a Priest continually,
but not Melchizedec. But because Melchizedec is by Moses styled the Priest of
the most high God, and the King of righteousness and peace, and because neither
his Genealogy, nor Birth, nor Death are recorded in Scripture, therefore was he
a most fit and proper type and figure of the eternal Priesthood and Royalty of
Christ, and for that cause said to be (...), made like unto the Son of God. My
arguments for this interpretation are these, First, its lawful according to the
rules of Syntax. Secondly, because it accommodates the sense, and renders that
place interpretable, which the Apostle was pleased to call (...), Sermonem
difficilem explicatu, A speech hard to be interpreted, c. 5. v. 11. Thirdly,
because the Article (...), may be as well demonstrative, as expletive, and in
this place rather, for if it were to be rendered, For this Melchizedec, the
Article (...) had been more significantly omitted, reading, (...), but because
the Article is added, it seems to intimate, that (...) is a Relative to (...)
and that the Article (...) is to be construed with Melchizedec, (...), or
(...), The Melchizedec. As our learned Abbot upon Psalm. 110. v. 4. For Jesus
Christ indeed is the true Melchizedec. In which place he also reads, Thou art
the Priest for ever, as if it were read, (...), which reading in it self is
lawful, and does more eminently set forth his singular right to the eternal
Priesthood, with exclusion to any other competitor whatsoever. Fourthly and
Lastly, this interpretation avoids two egregious contradictions, the one in
nature, that a mortal man should live for ever, the other in Faith, that there
should be two high Priests that should remain for ever. And now follows the
other difficulty which arises from, v. 8. (...), Et hic quidem decimas
accipiunt morientes homines, ibi vero (accipit) de quo testatum est quod vivit,
And here men that die receive tithes, but there he that receives them, lives
for ever. From whence it is concluded without contradiction, that Melchizedec
is there said to live, because he who receives tithes is said to live, but no
body in the foregoing words is said to have received tithes but Melchizedec who
received them from Abraham, and therefore it must be Melchizedec, of whom it is
witnessed that he lives. Whereto it is briefly answered, First, that the word
[accipit, receiveth] is not in the Greek Text. Secondly, that the Scripture
does no where say that Melchizedec lives. What then? is the sense deficient?
by no means. It perfectly and formally agrees with the whole order of the
Apostles discourse both in this Chapter, and the foregoing Chapter and the
following, but especially with v. 23, 24, 25. of this instant Chapter, Where we
have the self same sense as to the matter, the words only varied. (...), etc.
And they truly were many Priests, because they were not suffered by death for
to continue, But this man because he continues for ever, has an everlasting
Priesthood, by reason whereof he is also able evermore to save them that come
unto God by him, (...), always living to make intercession for them. So that
they who receive tithes and die, v. 8. cannot be other then the many Priests
who were not suffered by death to remain, v. 23. And he of whom it is witnessed
that he lives, v. 8. cannot be other then the very Jesus who is said, v. 24.
to remain for ever, and v. 25. (...), always living, to make intercession for
them. And truly Heinsius as to the (...), certainty of the thing, did
positively affirm, that necessarily those in v. 8. and those in v. 23, 24, 25.
were all one and the same persons, and for confirmation cites St Ambrose upon
v. 8. Quis est qui vivit? ille etiam qui secundum ordinem Melchisedec factus
est Sacerdos in perpetuum, Who is he that lives? Even he who according to the
order of Melchizedec is made a Priest for ever. But he shows not the (...)
manner how the thing is so according to the ordinary way of speech, so that the
objection still remains, that howsoever, we may strongly guess that the words,
v. 8. are properly meant of Christ, yet are they so literally [in common
acception] spoken of Melchizedec, that they cannot regularly be construed with
any other. But to this objection, to clear the matter, I answer, that those
words (...), in the common way of Syntax properly without any Allegory, ought
to relate to Jesus the Son of God, the Analogy and order of the whole discourse
unanimously consenting thereunto. As for example, (...), Here, i. e. that is,
in this world, (...). Men that die receive tithes, that is, are Priests, for
none but Priests received tithes, so as the terms are clearly Synonymous,
(...), but there, that is, in heaven, (...), in the inner part of the vail,
where Jesus is for us entered, c. 6. v. 19, 20. is, [understand (...)] he of
whom it is witnessed that he lives, to wit, Jesus, of whom it is witnessed
according as it is there cited out of Psalm. 110. v. 4. Thou art a Priest for
ever after the order of Melchizedec, or as the Syriack and Arabic read, and
the Apostle in this very Chapter, v. 15. according to the similitude of
Melchizedec. The arguments to confirm this interpretation are these. First,
there is nothing in the New Testament more frequent then to understand the
verb, (...), is, you may observe it by the change of the character of the
letter in our English books almost in every Page, and therefore it is lawfully
expounded, (...), But there is he of whom it is witnessed that he lives.
Secondly, it is not always necessary that a word or sentence relate to the next
antecedent, but often by reason of some digression or intervenient Parentheses
to some remoter antecedent. Whereof you may see examples many, as Matthew. c. 3.
v. 16. the word, (...), him, does not answer to the next antecedent, that is,
to Jesus, in the same verse, but to John, v. 14. And Gal. c. 2. the Relative
(...), to whom, v. 5. is not a Relative to (...), the false brethren, next
preceding, v. 4. (as is commonly conceived) but to, (...), those of reputation,
v. 2. whereof you may see Animad. upon that place. So Romans c. 1. the seventh
verse answers to the first, whilst in the interim betwixt, there are three
Parentheses. And 1 Cor. c. 11. the words v. 33. do perfectly answer to v. 22.
the rest of the discourse between being a kind of digression. And such a
digression we have in this very Epistle, nay, in this very place and matter,
for when he had began his discourse concerning Melchizedec, c. 5. v. 10. he
suddenly diverts into another, which when he had continued unto, c. 6. v. 20.
he returns again to that of Melchizedec, Non abrupte [as Estius] sed molli and
artificioso nexu orationis, Not abruptly but with a smooth and artificial
closing of his speech. The which very thing he seems to have done in this very
place whereof we now speak, so that (...) does not unlawfully answer to (...)
in the former Chapter, the discourse between intervening by digression or
Parenthesis, which would appear much more plain, did not the troublesome
division of the Chapters hinder. Thirdly the Adverb of Place, (...) there does
most fitly answer to its Correlative, (...), where, as (...), For where your
treasure is, there will your heart be also, Matthew, c. 6. v. 21. And, (...), For
where the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together, Matthew. c. 24.
v. 28. So here, (...), Where Jesus is entered, there is he of whom it is
witnessed that he lives. Fourthly, as we must acknowledge, that it is most
certainly true of the word of God, what John says of himself c. 19. v. 35.
(...), His Testimony is true, so may we no less confidently affirm, whatsoever
is not to be found in it, neither can by consequence deduced from it, can in no
sense be said to have its Testimony from it; from whence it necessarily
follows, that it cannot in this place be understood that the Scripture bears
witness of Melchizedec, that he lives, when no such thing is to be found in
Scripture, or to be deduced from it by lawful consequence. And to speak the
truth, the common argument which they use to maintain their exposition, to wit,
Silentium de morte pro vitae Testimonio accipit, The silence of his death he
takes for a Testimony of his life, I say the argument wherewith they endeavor
to defend this exposition, and that is, Non valeret hoc quidem in aliis, sed in
Melchisedeco quatenus est imago Christi, valere debet, This were not of
validity in any else, but in Melchizedec it must be so, because he is the type
of Christ, has more presumption in it then reason or Authority; And certainly
the concession of this interpretation as rational and lawful, induced Cunaeus
into that vain (in my judgment) opinion, that Jesus and Melchizedec were one
and the same person, and that, as he thought, out of a necessary consequence,
that there might not be said to be two high Priests, who would remain for ever.
Fifthly, because this very Chapter does so often testify that the meaning of
the words is so, as you may see, v. 13. For he of whom these things are spoken
was evidently Jesus, our Lord of the tribe of Juda, v. 14. But what are the
things are spoken of him? to wit, that he is entered into the inner vail, that
he remains a Priest for ever, and that of him it is witnessed that he lives,
which is also farther testified, v. 16. v. 23 24 25. and v. 28. So that it is
more manifest then the Noon day, that, [of whom it is witnessed that he liveth]
cannot possibly be understood of any other then of Jesus. Sixthly and lastly,
our interpretation so perfectly accommodates the sense, and reconciles all the
difficulties which rise out of the common exposition, that I see no reason why
it should not be accepted, especially having nothing in it contrary to Syntax,
reason or Scripture, but agreeing to them all, and there being no other way
whatever, that can accord the construction and the sense, as far as yet appears.

V. 4. (...). Here is likewise an observable trajection, for (...), Unto whom
even the Patriarch Abraham gave the Tenth of the spoils.

C. 9. v. 1. (...), And a worldly sanctuary. It being so here called in
Antithesis to the heavenly, as it is an antitype of the true one into which
Christ is entered. And that was heaven it self, not (...), A Sanctuary made with
hands the figure of the true one, v. 24. The Antithesis standing thus, The
first Tabernacle had its ordinances of divine service, and a worldly Sanctuary,
etc. But Christ is become an high Priest of the good things to come, through a
greater and more perfect Tabernacle, (...), not made with hands, that is to
say, of this creation, v. 11. not a worldly Sanctuary made with hands, or of an
earthly building, but an eternal Sanctuary in the heavens, into which he is
entered by his own blood once for all. So that (...), and (...), Worldly, made
with hands, and of this building or creation, signify all one and the same.
Whereas some interpret a Tabernacle not made with hands, that is, of this
creation, to be meant of the body or humane nature of Christ, because a body is
sometime metaphorically called (...), a Tabernacle, I conceive is not suitable
to the scope of the place, nor to the doctrine of our Faith. For first, the
Tabernacle here mentioned seems rather to be the heavens into or through which
Christ is said to be entered to appear in the presence of God for us, v. 24. as
also he is called our high Priest which is passed into the heavens, c. 4. v.
14. And Secondly, as it is improper to say, that any humane body, was or was
not, (...), made with hands, so neither can it be truly said, that Christ his
body or humane nature was not (...), of this creation or world: For to say that
Christ his body was not of this world, because it was conceived in a
supernatural manner, is absurd and frivolous, For Christ had his whole humane
nature body and soul from his Mother, and she from Adam, that is, of his
creation. Else what becomes of Athanasius his Creed? (...), Man of the
substance of his Mother. (...), Perfect man of a reasonable soul and humane
flesh subsisting. Nay if Christ's humane nature were not (...), of this world,
then are we still in our sins, neither does his passion at all avail us. We are
still more miserable, (...), For what was not [by Christ] assumed, was by him
never healed, as Nazianzen most rightly tells us. But to return, a worldly
Sanctuary is a Sanctuary made by the work of man, (...), which man pitched, and
not the true Sanctuary which God pitched in the heavens, c. 8. v. 2. He
distinguishes between the heavenly Sanctuary which God made and not man, of
which Christ is the Minister or high Priest, and the Sanctuary that Solomon
built by the hand of man, of which those were high Priests that were after the
order of Aaron. Neither was Atrium Gentium, The court of the Gentiles, ever
called (...), the Sanctuary or the holy place, which some would have (...) to
signify in this place. Nay the persons to whom the court of the Gentiles was
permitted, were expressly forbidden by a public writing in Greek and Latin
(...), To come within the Sanctuary or holy place, Josep. de bell. Jud. l. 6.
c. 6.

C. 11. v. 1. (...), Est autem fides firma expectatio rerum sperandarum, But
Faith is the assured expectation of things to be hoped for. In which sense the
word (...) is often used in holy Scripture. As in this Epistle, c. 3. v. 14. 2
Cor. c. 9. v. 4. Ruth c. 1. v. 12. Ezekiel. c. 19. v. 5. Lam. c. 3. v. 18. Psalm.
39. v. 7. So Schindler, Fides est sperandorum substantia, h. e. expectatio,
Faith is the substance of things hoped for, that is, the expectation, Or, Faith
is the ground or foundation of things hoped for. For (...) is, quo quid
fulcitur, wherewith any thing is supported. And so hope is truly supported by
Faith. For what we do not confidently believe shall ever be, we can never hope
to enjoy, and therefore Faith is farther called (...), The evidence or certain
proof of things not seen, yea so certain as if they were already seen. For
(...) in the Old Glossary, is, indicium or probatio, a demonstration or
argument so sure as cannot be refuted.

V. 4. (...). After (...) understand (...), by an Elleipsis frequent in every
Page, as I have often observed. Et propter eam adhuc dicitur esse mortuus, And
for it, that is, for his Faith is he still said to be dead, or, to have died.
(...), praedicatur, Seal. Is yet spoken of, in our Margin. For we to this hour
say, that Cain killed his brother Abel for his Faith, for which Abel obtained
witness that he was righteous, v. 4. So 1 John c. 3. v. 12. (...); Wherefore
did Cain kill his brother but because his works were righteous? But how were
they righteous, but by his Faith in Christ to come, in assurance whereof he
offered of the firstlings of his flock? For his Faith therefore is Abel still
said to have died.

V. 11. (...), Virtutem accepit ad fundationem seminis, Through Faith even
Sarah also received strength for the foundation of a Seed, etc. which was to be
as it follows in the next verse, As the stars of heaven for multitude, and as
the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable, in which all the families of
the earth were to be blessed, for of that Seed wherewith she became then with
Child, came Jesus Christ the Savior of the world. (...), as (...), The
Foundation of the world, Revel. c. 13. v. 8. and c. 17. v. 8. and elsewhere,
(...), dicitur, cum res aliqua sumit exordium, etc. Hieron. it is called,
(...), when any thing takes its beginning. But by what Philosophy, Logic,
Grammar or Dictionary, it can be possibly Translated, that she received
strength to conceive a Seed, I confess is beyond my learning or capacity. Why
it should be therefore so universally accepted, I cannot but wonder, whenas the
sense as now Translated, is so proper, and the use of the word so fit and
common.

V. 37. (...), Tentati sunt, Were tempted. As Job, Schol. Graec. as Abraham and
Isaac, Theodoret. But our late Writers, as also some of the Ancient are of
another opinion, and therefore say, that the word is crept into the Text
imperitia amanuensis, by the unskilfulness of the Transcriber, or that it is
not written as it should be, either by the oversight of the Apostle, or the
Scribe. For because it would be a Tautology to say (...), they were tempted,
when immediately before it is said, (...), they had trials or temptations of
cruel mockings and scourgings, etc. and because there are words of each hand
denoting some kind of death, they think it probable, either that the word
should not be read at all, as it is omitted by Chrysostom, the Syriack and
Aethiopick Interpreters, and others; or that, if it be read, it ought to be
understood in some notion whereof there was no mention made before, and which
signifies some kind of death. And from hence some have been moved to read
(...), others (...), were burned. But if there be any leave for conjecture,
perhaps it should have been rather written, (...), They were stoned, they were
sawn asunder, they were pierced through, a kind of death so known in those
days, either by Spear or Stake, that it is scarce to be believed that the
Apostle in this place could possibly escape it, when he reckons up so many
several kinds of death, which the Christians in those times, and the Prophets
of old suffered for the Faith; among which Nicephorus and Eusebius out of the
Writings of Dionysius of the Martyrs of Alexandria, mention the
transverberation or piercing through of the bowels with stakes, which with
Phavorinus is called (...), For anciently they thrust or pierced through
malefactors, striking a sharp stake through the back bone, as they do fishes
which are roasted on a spit. (...), Hesyc. and Suid. (...), ut transfigam
turdos, Aristoph. and so verubus transfixa exta, Ovid. and perhaps so meant
Homer, (...), transfixit verubus.

C. 12 v. 24. (...), And to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better
things, then Abel, as some, or then that of Abel, as others, meaning the
sprinkling; or as some copies read, (...), and then is meant the blood of Abel,
or as the Interlineary in our Polyglot Bible, Sanguine aspersionis, in the
Ablative. And then the meaning's thus, And to Jesus the Mediator of the new
covenant, and who by his blood of sprinkling speaks better things then Abel.
But read you which way you please, the sense is still the same. And that is
this, That the Sacrifice or Oblation which Christ offered on the Cross by the
sprinkling or effusion of his blood, did speak better things to the pacifying
or atonement of the wrath of God, then did the Sacrifice or Offering of Abel,
or then the blood spoke, which Abel offered unto God for a Sacrifice, which was
a true type, and of all the first, of that Sacrifice which in the fullness of
time Christ offered on the Cross by the effusion of his blood, and for this
very thing, because Abel the first of all men living offered an offering to the
Lord of the firstlings of his flock, whereby he testified his Faith in Christ
to come and offer himself an oblation for the sins of the whole world, does God
altogether seem to have respect to Abel and to his offering. For by Faith is
Abel said to have offered unto God a better Sacrifice then Cain, c 11. v. 4.
and for this Faiths sake did he obtain a Testimony that he was righteous. When
therefore that Sacrifice of Abel was but a type or shadow of that great
sprinkling of blood which takes away the sins of the world, it is no more to
be compared with it which is the substance of the shadow, then is a picture to
be compared with the living person whom it represents. Concerning which
disproportion you may observe more, c. 9. v. 13, 14. and 23. So that (...) or
(...) in this place denotes nothing else but the rites and offerings of the Old
Testament, one example being put for all. As if he should say, The blood of
Christ speaks better things, that is, more available to the appeasing of the
wrath of God for our sins, then either Abel, or Moses, or all the Sacrifices
and Oblations of all the Patriarchs. That Christ his blood was praefigured in
the Sacrifice of Abel, to be shed for the sins of all mankind, and that the
Patriarchs before the Law was given, when they Sacrificed the blood of beasts,
had a respect to the Savior of the world, I think, there is no Divine but does
assent to, Modern or Ancient. Instead of all, I shall use but one Testimony
thereto out of Eusebius, Demonst. lib 1. c. 10. where speaking of Noah and the
rest of the Patriarchs before Moses, he has these words, (...), etc. The
Anciently beloved of God foreseeing by a divine spirit that some extraordinary
Sacrifice precious in the sight of God would one day come to men, that should
expiate the sins of the whole world, did in the mean while perform or act its
signs and figures, as Prophets typically expressing that which was to come, But
to say that the blood of Christ speaks better things then the blood of Abel
which cries to heaven for vengeance, to speak modestly, agrees not with the
scope of the place, it having been the Apostles great labor to demonstrate how
invalid the Ceremonies of the old Law were to acquire eternal life, and how
much in that respect the covenant of the New Testament was beyond that of the
Old, as is evidently apparent by the whole series of his discourse, c. 9, and
10. But to speak the very truth, with reverence to Antiquity, that exposition
is contrary to the very rules of Logic. For Comparata oportet esse secundum
majus and ejusdem speciei and naturae, Things compared ought to be according to
more or less, of the same species and nature. So as in a comparison of
betterness, the one may be said in some measure to be good for that end for
which the other is said to be better. So Chrysostom, although he hit not the
meaning in this place so luckily, upon those words (...), better Sacrifices
then these. c. 9. v. 23. says, (...), etc. That which is better, is better
then that which is good, therefore the types of those things which are in
heaven are good, for if the types were evil, then would those things whereof
they are a type be evil also. But to cry for vengeance, and to cry for grace,
are the whole heavens different and contrary natures. Neither can the blood of
Christ be said to be better then the proper blood of Abel, which was not at all
good, no not typically to that intent and purpose to which Christ his blood
was, to wit, for the redemption of mankind, and the expiation of the sins of
the whole world. That therefore this comparison may agree with it self, it is
unavoidably necessary, that here be meant the Sacrifice of Abel, which through
Faith he offered unto God, which with the Sacrifice of Christ is not to be
compared.

ANNOTATIONS On the General Ep. Of S. James.
Chapter 3. v. 1.

(...), Nolite multi fieri doctores, Do not many of you become teachers. That
is, do not many of you affect the gift of preaching, knowing that we, [who are
so] shall receive the greater judgment. A familiar trajection, for (...).

V. 3. (...). Here is another trajection likewise, for (...), Fraena immittimus
in ora equorum, We put bits into the mouths of horses, as if it were purposely
affected for the elegance. You have also the like observable trajection, c. 2.
v. 1. (...), for (...), Have not the Faith of Jesus Christ our Lord of Glory
with respect of persons.

C. 4. v. 5, 6. (...). From the consideration of the construction of these
words it seems to me necessarily to follow, that the first (...), and (...)
next following, can agree with no other word then (...), and that they must be
therefore rendered thus, Or do you think the Scripture says in vain, That the
spirit which dwells in us lusts to envy? But it gives a greater grace, for
that it says, God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble. The
sense and coherence being thus, He advises them against strife and envying,
against wars and fightings, which he tells them proceed from their lusts, for
confirmation whereof he produces a Testimony of Scripture. Do you think the
Scripture says in vain, the Spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy? as if
it had said, these bitter envyings come from the lusts of the spirit that is
within us. Surely no. The Scripture says it not in vain. The spirit of man is
carried on with passion unto envy, and from thence it comes, because he cannot
enjoy what the lust of his eye desires, he endeavors to satisfy his lust by
obtaining his desires by force. But the Scripture tendereth a more gracious
comfort, when it says that God resists the proud, and gives grace, that is,
shows favor to the humble. Intimating thereby, that though we be naturally
prone to strife and envy, yet if we humble our selves before God, to which he
exhorts us in the following words, he will show favor to us. Where this
Scripture is in express words, I cannot tell, but among the Writings of the
Prophets which are lost. As elsewhere the Apostle Paul cites words of our
Saviors, which we no where read that he ever spoke, It is more blessed to give
then to receive, Act. c. 20. v. 35.

C. 5. v. 9. (...), Nolite ingemiscere in alterutrum, as the Old Latin, Ne
lugete invicem, Bemoan not one another. He bids them in the former verses to be
patient and to establish their hearts, because the coming of the Lord was at
hand. And here he again exhorts them, not to lose their courage, and to bemoan
one another, least for their impatience they might be blamed. For behold the
Judge is before the doors, the Lord is at hand. Take ye therefore the Prophets
for examples of suffering affliction and patience. (...), is cum gemitu
deploro, to bewail with lamentation. As, (...), I bewail my own Soul, Basil. in
which sense you have (...) in Euripides. (...), is all one as if he had said,
(...). For (...) with a Genitive, signifies super, over. Bewail or lament not
one over another. As for the common reading, Grudge not one against another,
methinks, it agrees not at all with the scope of the place.

ANNOTATIONS On the I. Ep. General Of S. Peter.
Chapter 3. v. 20, 21.

(...). As the words are thus commonly pointed and distinguished, it is very
hard to give them a commodious sense and a Grammatical construction. For which
cause Beza would have this place amended out of the Complutense Edition,
affirming that in other copies, (...) or (...), is corruptly read for (...) as
it is in that. And him for a great part our late Expositors do follow, though
there be an old copy also in Oxford that reads (...) instead of (...), which
our Learned Dr Hammond is pleased to follow. The Syriack, to salve the doubt,
before (...) understood (...), according to which, perhaps lawfully enough. But
there may be no less question in another phrase of this period, for according
to the common use of words, it is not properly said, Octo animas servatas esse
per aquam, That eight Souls were saved by water, as the word (...) was
constantly understood by the Greeks. Though Beza to remedy this difficulty
also, will have (...) in this place to signify, In, that is, in his Country
language, parmi le'au, in or amidst the water. And to confirm his Judgment he
cites a precedent, Romans c. 4. v. 11. where he would have (...) to signify, in
praeputio, in uncircumcision, whereas (...) is three times used by the Apostle
in the same and the foregoing verse, but truly I see no such urgency in that
place to alter the proper signification of the Praeposition, it being as good
if not much better sense to Translate it, as the Old Latin does, Per
praeputium, By his uncircumsion, according to the common acception of the word.
The meaning of the place being this, That Abraham received the sign of
Circumcision the seal of the righteousness of Faith in uncircumcision, that
(...), by his uncircumcision he might be the Father of all believers,
righteousness also being imputed unto them. (...), being to be Transposed thus,
(...), and not to be construed with (...), as commonly it is, to the obscuring
of the Emphasis of the sense. Which is surely this, His circumcision was the
seal of his Faith when he was yet uncircumcised, for a sign, that by his
uncircumcision, that is, by his Faith when he was yet not circumcised, he might
become the Father of all believers throughout the world that are not
circumcised. However, this interpretation of Beza's is not only rare, but
likewise not much suitable to this place. Let us therefore with leave inquire,
whether these very words without altering at all the common reading (for
neither, (...), nor (...), nor (...) being all of the Masculine or Neuter
gender do or can agree with (...) which is of the Faeminine, as in their sense
who would so read they ought to do) only varying the points, and understanding,
(...), which is so frequent, and taking away the latter Parenthesis, may not
yield a truer and better sense then they did before. (...), In diebus Noae, cum

etiam quod est antitypum nos nunc servat Baptisma, non depositio sordium carnis
sed bonae conscientiae stipulatio in Deum per Resurrectionem Jesu Christi, In
the days of Noah when the Ark was preparing, wherein few (that is Eight) Souls
were saved. By water also Baptism which is the Antitype does now save us. Not
the doing away the filth of the flesh, but the covenant of a good conscience
toward God by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. And thus by this Translation
the unwonted use of (...) in the former sense is avoided, and the Article (...)
does fitly answer to the word, (...). Neither is the trajection harsh at all,
as some perhaps may object, (...), for (...), By water also Baptism which is
the Antitype [to the Ark of Noah wherein Eight Souls were saved] does now save
us. Is there not the same trejection, if you read (...) or (...)? Nay it is so
far from being insolent, as it rather seems elegant and pleasing, for as
Stephanus affirms, Demosthenes the great Orator was wont to use such
trajections ad venustatem sermoni conciliandam, to gain a grace unto his
speech. That others also of the Greeks, and the Latins also for the same cause
did the like, as you may see, Animad. on Act. c. 13. v. 17. And perhaps the
very Apostles themselves, is not strange at all. You have one in this very
place, (...), for, (...), and another in the same Apostle, 2 Ep. c. 1. v. 19.
(...), for (...). But if you would see more perplexed and involved trajections,
you may consult as I said before, Act. c. 13. v. 17. In sum the sense is this,
Baptism which does now save us by water, and is an Antitype to the Ark of Noah,
is not the doing away of the filth of the flesh (...), By water, but the
covenant or promise of a good conscience toward God (...), By the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ, so as there is a clear Analogy between (...), and (...), a due
proportion between, By water, and By the Resurrection. As if he should have
said, That the Ark of Noah (not the flood) was a type of Baptism, and Baptism
an antitype to the Ark, but not because that Baptism was a cleansing of the
filth of the flesh by water, in which respect it had no resemblance with the
Ark, but in that it was the stipulation of a good conscience toward God by the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ, in the Faith whereof and a life proportionable
toward God, we are now saved, as they of old time were in the Ark of Noah. For
the Ark of Noah and Baptism are both types and figures of the Resurrection. So
that the proper end of Baptism is not to be understood as if it were a washing
away of our sins, which is signified by the doing away the filth of the flesh,
(although it necessarily follows and is so often Metonymically taken by the
Fathers) but (...) properly it is the sign of Resurrection from death in sin to
newness of life by a true and lively Faith in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,
whereof Baptism was a most Emphatick figure, as was also the Ark of Noah, out
of which he returned as it were from the Sepulcher of death to a new life, and
therefore is of Philo not unfitly termed (...), The Captain or Leader of
regeneration, and so was the Whales belly out of which Jonas rose after a three
days burial, and the Cloud, and the Red Sea in which the people of Israel were
all Baptized, 1 Cor c. 10. v. 2. All which were types and figures of the same
thing with Baptism, to wit, of the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, it
being reputed an Apostolic constitution, (...), etc. Demersio in aqua denotat
mortem, emersio ex aqua Resurrectionem Christi simul and nostram, The demersion
in the water signifies the death, the emersion out of it the Resurrection of
Christ and also of us. So as by the leave of Interpreters who are of another
Judgment, I for my part think, that in these words is more Emphatically and
expressly set forth what Baptism means, both negatively and affirmatively,
then in any other place of Scripture, as if our Apostle did it of purpose to
rectify our Judgments concerning the true notion of Baptism. I say negatively
and affirmatively. Negatively, that it is not doing away the filth of the flesh
(...), by the efficacy of water, the outward sign of the inward thing, to wit,
the mystical washing away of sin, into which sense very obvious for the near
affinity of the use of water we are so prone to run into. For it is a cold
exposition of them who say, that the doing away the filth of the flesh does
signify the outward act of washing only, as if any man could be saved by the
outward act, unless the inward thing be applied by Faith, to wit, the remission
or doing away of sin. Affirmatively and positively, that it is the stipulation
or promise of a good conscience toward God by the virtue of the Resurrection of
Jesus Christ. And I conceive this sense concerning Baptism to be most consonant
and agreeable to the Judgment of the Fathers, who if they notwithstanding did
apply Baptism to that other notion of washing, they did it accidently, and by
the by, because of the Allegorical allusion of the element of water to the
blood of Christ, which is said to cleanse us from our sins, 1 John c. 1. v. 7.
But more surely there is in this word of Baptism according to Athanasius,
(...), a deeper mystery then that of washing, a mystery known and common to the
very Heathen, as their frequent lustrations do sufficiently witness. But as
concerning the Resurrection of the body, it was a thing to them unknown and
incredible, if not altogether imperceptible, [nay some of the Jews themselves
did not believe it.] It was the speech of one of their great Philosophers,
Seneca by name, Hora illa decretoria non est animo suprema sed corpori, The
determinate hour, of death, is not the last to the soul, but to the body. It
was no small matter to reach the immortality of the Soul, the top of their
knowledge, but of the Resurrection of the body Philosophers scarce ever dreamed
of. Mornaeus tells us of Zoroastres, who is of some reported to have held this
opinion, Quod animae immortales sunt, and quod corporum Resurrectio universalis
futura, That Souls are immortal, and that there shall be a universal
Resurrection of bodies. But this, but, a plerisque profertur, many say so, but
no certainty thereof. And Lactantius tells us of Chrysippus who had an
imperfect notion of it, the sum whereof was this. That after death within some
period of time, (...), we should be restored into the same form wherein we now
are. But who knows whether he meant the same Numerical body, or whether by this
same form he mean not the Soul, as the rest of the Philosophers did, or whether
he meant not rather the Pythagorean Metempsychosis? But this I say was a
greater mystery then that Allegorical washing of the Soul by which its said to
be cleansed by the blood of Christ. The notion of Resurrection was far higher,
the very life and mystery of Christian Religion, as Zonaras calls it. It is
indeed the stupendous mystery of mysteries, wherein to believe consists the
foundation of eternal happiness. That Christ the Mediator should become (...),
God and man, to be declared man in that he died, and to be declared God in that
he rose again from the dead, Romans c. 1. v. 4. This I say again was a mystery
beyond all Philosophical Speculation, and therefore there was need of some
significant type or figure, which might make so impenetrable a notion familiar
and perceptable to the sense of man, to which purpose nothing seemed more fit
and easy in the wisdom of God, then the burying of our bodies in water by
Baptism, from whence they receive an immediate Resurrection. So that in
conclusion we may positively affirm that Baptism is properly and solely a type
of the Resurrection. And to this truth do give their suffrage, The Apostles,
Fathers, Schoolmen, almost all Interpreters, Ancient and Modern, and even our
English Church it self, its Judgment being manifest in the Rubric of the
Common Prayer, which injoyns the dipping of Infants in Baptism, allowing only
in some cases the liberty of sprinkling, or perfusion. The thing of it self is
so manifest, that there is no need of Testimonies to confirm it; but because
there be not few who teach otherwise, led thereunto by example and vulgar
error, it will not be amiss, if but to free my self from the imputation of too
much confidence, out of innumerable Testimonies, to cite some few, And we first
begin from the Apostle Paul, (...), etc. Know ye not that so many as were
Baptized into Jesus Christ, were Baptized into his death? Therefore we are
buried with him by Baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised from the
dead by the Father of Glory, even so we also should walk in newness of life,
etc. Romans c. 6. v. 3, 4. etc. (...), etc. Being buried with him in Baptism,
wherein you are also risen with him through Faith of the working of God who
has raised him from the dead, Col. c. 2. v. 12. (...), etc. Else what shall
they do who are Baptized for dead [bodies] if the dead rise not? 1 Cor. c. 15.
v. 29. As much as if he had said, In vain does the Church use the sign of
Baptism if there be no Resurrection. You have it abundantly proved also in the
Primitive and later Writers. For example, That believing on his death, (...),
By his Baptism ye may be made partakers of his Resurrection, Ignat. Ep. ad
Trall. (...), Baptism was given to set forth the death of the Lord, Ep. ad
Philadel. in the name of Ignatius. The death of Christ, Constable. Apost. (...), In
Baptism we perform the signs of his Passion and Resurrection, Just. Mar. We
know one saving Baptism, since there is but one death for the world and one
Resurrection, (...), whereof Baptism is the type, etc. Basil. Mag. Hear what St
Paul says, They were all Baptized in the cloud and in the sea, (...), He
calls their passage through the sea, Baptism, for it was an escape from
death, etc. Basil. Seleuc. (...), When we go about to Baptize, we bid to say, I
believe in the Resurrection of the dead, and in this Faith are we Baptized,
Chrysostom. Baptismus Resurrectionis pignus, and imago, Baptism is a pledge and
figure of the Resurrection, Ambr. Baptismus arrhabo Resurrectionis, Baptism is
an earnest of the Resurrection, Lactant. Aquarum elemento sepelimur, We are
buried in the element of water, Anselm. Mersio mortis and sepulturae formam
gerit, Immersion bears the form of death and burial, Bernard. Laudabilius, and
tutius, and communius, etc. Baptism is performed more laudably, more safely and
more commonly by dipping, for by dipping the figure of Christ his burial is
represented, Tho. Aquin. Ipsum Baptizandi verbum mergere significat, etc. The
word Baptism does signify dipping under the water, and it is evident the
Ancient Church used the Ceremony of dipping, Calv. Baptismus Graeca vox est,
etc. Baptism is a Greek word and signifies properly, immersion into the water,
and this signification does properly agree with our Baptism, and has Analogy
to the thing signified, for by Baptism we are buried together and as it were
drowned with Christ being dead to sin, etc. Zanch. I could add to these an
innumerable heap of Testimonies, but these I think are enough to prove two
irrefragable doctrines, First, that Baptism is properly and solely, the type of
the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, by Faith wherein we are assured of
the humanity and Godhead of our Savior, the very foundation of our Christian
Faith. And Secondly, of the Resurrection of all true Christians, who are
Baptized in, and live according to that Faith, knowing that if they shall rise
from the death of sin to newness of life, they shall also after death with
Christ arise to glory. I shall only add the Judgment of an ingenuous and
learned man, whose Testimony in this matter is not to be suspected or refused.
His words are these, Porro quamvis immersionis Caeremonia and olim fuit
communior, etc. Though the Ceremony of immersion was anciently more common, as
appears by the unanimous discourse of the Fathers when they speak of this
matter, and does more lively represent the death, burial, and Resurrection of
the Lord and us, which are mystically done in Baptism. The which signification
of immersion the Fathers do often urge, etc. From whence St Thomas affirms that
the Ceremony or rite of dipping is the most commendable, Yet there have been
many reasons for which sometimes it was convenient to change this custom of
dipping into some other kind of Ceremony near unto it, etc. From hence
therefore the Ceremony of perfusion or pouring on of water as middle between
sprinkling and dipping was much in use, which custom Bonaventure says was in
his time much observed in the French Churches and some others, though he
confess the Ceremony of dipping was the more common, the more fit, and the more
secure, as St Thomas teaches. However where the custom of perfusion, or
aspersion, sprinkling of, or pouring on of the water is now in use, it ought
not to be altered by private Authority. Nay since now it is so generally in
practice throughout the Church, it ought by no means to be called in question.
Thus far Estius. In whose words we have a manifest and ingenious concession,
that dipping was the Ancient Ceremony, which constantly the Fathers taught, as
more lively representing the Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Christ and us,
that the Schoolmen held the same for the most secure and commendable custom,
that the custom of perfusion crept in unawares into the Church, for what causes
he mentions not. But because the custom has been long in use, he does not
think it fit it should be called into question whether it be lawful or no. And
to this Judgment I willingly subscribe, so as the Ministers of Baptism would
teach the true and genuine reason of its institution, which by the change of
the Ceremony is almost lost, so that they for the most part teach now a days
that Allegorical one of washing, occasioned by the now constant custom of
perfusion, which I will not yet deny may be piously and profitably taught
sometimes, for the Fathers and the Apostles themselves did sometimes do it.
Though, with leave be it spoken, I am still of opinion, that it would be more
for the honor of the Church, and for the peace and security of Religion, if
the old custom could conveniently be restored, which surely it might safely
enough in respect of indangering the health of the Infants, if Baptism were
only to be administered at set times in the year, as it was Anciently in the
Church. Which custom what should hinder to be revived I do not see, but the
opinion of those, who hold Baptism so necessary to Salvation, as that without
it there is none to be hoped for, and yet in danger of death, there might be a
liberty allowed for it at other times. The case then being thus, I beseech you
what so visible affinity is there between burial and washing, that Christian
Baptism should be thought to draw its Original from the lotions or washings of
the Jews? If it were true that our Baptism did signify washing or ablution, or
were it true that the Jews did Anciently admit into their Church either their
Own or Proselytes by collation of Baptism, which has been so much urged by
Learned men, they might be probable arguments, that the institution of our
Baptism was fetched from the Baptismes or washings of the Jews. But when the
contrary is made so evident concerning the first, and there appears no
certainty for the second, I conceive there is little reason to adhere to this
new and uncertain doctrine which the Fathers never heard or dreamed of. For
that our Baptism is truly a type of burial, and Resurrection, litteral and
mystical, and not of washing, has been already sufficiently declared. And as
for the other argument, as it is far off from any cogency in it to force the
assent, so is it liable to very much question, it having so little help of the
Authority of Scripture to defend it, that I can scarce find any footsteps of it
in the Old Testament. They would derive its Original from the word (...), lavit
or purgavit, to wash or cleanse, Exodus c. 19. v. 10. But as I take it the
Rabbis use for Baptism the word (...), which signifies dipping or immersion,
thereby notably showing that they owe the notion of the word to the Greeks, or
rather to the Christians. For what affinity is there so near between purgation,
and immersion, cleansing and dipping? But the thing of it self was so uncertain
that the Masters themselves did disagree about it. For in the very Text they
urge which is cited out of the Talmud, Rabbi Eliezer does expressly contradict
Rabbi Joshua, who was the first as far as I can learn that ever did assert this
kind of Baptism among the Jews. For Rabbi Eliezer who was at least coetaneous
if not elder to Rabbi Joshua, expressly says, Proselytum circumcisum and non
Baptizatum verum esse Proselytum, nam fic legimus de patribus, Abrahamo,
Isaaco, and Jacobo, qui circumcisi erant and non Baptizati, That a Proselyte
circumcised and not Baptized was a true Proselyte, for so we read of our
Fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were Circumcised and not Baptized. On
the other side Rabbi Joshua affirms, Eum qui Baptizatus est and non circumcisus
esse Proselytum, That he was a Proselyte who was Baptized and not circumcised,
But to which of these shall I yield my belief? To Eliezer who affirms that
which the Scripture affirms, or to Joshua who affirms that which the Scripture
no where mentions? It Is true the Masters stood all for Rabbi Joshua, it was
their interest so to do, it was for the honor of their Religion, that the
Christians might be said to borrow their Ceremonies from them. But when I see
learned and judicious persons in these times fetch the foundations of truth
from the Rabbis, and that to establish a new opinion, I cannot but wonder at
it. Unde nobis missus est Talmudus, etc. They are the words of Buxtorfius in
his Synag. Jud. From whence was the Talmud sent us, that we should give it so
much credit, as to believe that the Law of Moses could or ought to be
understood by it? And if not the Law of Moses, much less the Law of the Gospel
to which they were professed enemies. The Talmud is called by the same Author,
Errorum Labyrinthus, and fabularum Judaicarum fundamentum, The Labyrinth of
errors, and the foundation of Jewish Fables, and it was first perfected and
acknowledged to be Authentic Five Hundred years after Christ, and out of it
Maimonides and all the rest did suck their learning. Surely therefore there is
little reason to acquiesce in its Authority, or Testimony. But what was the
matter that this old Rabbin should so constantly deny that which was like to
advance the honor of his Religion, but that his conscience was thoroughly
convinced of his assertion? I cannot but admire the ingenuity of the man who
maintained the light of this truth so firmly against and amidst so many
Impostours of his Nation, who perhaps thought it a Glorious Triumph to obtrude
a counterfit opinion upon the innocent world not yet solicitous of their
machinations. And that which moves me more, Josephus himself [not to speak of
all the Fathers before the Talmud] who was likewise a Jew and of the same age
with Rabbi Eliezer, who writ also purposely of the customs and Ceremonies of
his Nation, is totally silent in this matter, so that it is an argument to me
next to demonstration, that two persons of such eminency, both Jews, and
coeval, the one should expressly deny, the other in all his History make no
mention of this Baptism. Besides if Baptism in the sense of our days had been
in use among the Jews in former times, wherefore did the Pharisees say to John
the Baptist, Joh. c. 1. v. 25. Why then Baptizest thou, if thou be not that
Christ, nor Elias, nor that Prophet? Do they not plainly intimate thereby, that
there was no use nor practice of Baptism before, and that it was a received
opinion among them, that there was none to be used till Elias, or that Prophet
came? Such a solemn and public mersation was altogether unusual with the Jews
till that time, as Grotius says upon the words aforementioned. How then there
can be any such affinity between our Baptism and the washings of the Jews, that
the one should therefore by any pretext or right be said to succeed the other,
I confess I understand not, it is beyond my Faith. But they say that Arrian
calls the Jew, (...), that is, one that is dipped, but I rather think with his
Commentator, Ipsum confuse loqui, and velle potius Christianum Judaeum, That he
[being a Heathen] spoke confusedly or promiscuously, and that he rather meant a
Christian Jew, as Lubin also upon that of Juvenal, Nunc sacri fontis nemus and
delubra locantur Judaeis,
will have the Jews there to be meant the Christians, Qui edicto Domitiani urbe
pulsi sylvas illas habitare cogebantur, Who being by Domitians Edict expelled
the City, were forced to inhabit those woods which were sacred to the
Heathenish devotions. But to put an end to this discourse, I do affirm with
Alexander de Halys, Tinctio est formalis causa Baptismi, That dipping is the
formal cause of Baptism. There remains only to resolve what (...) is.
Concerning which word I conceive with Beza, Grotius, Estius, and others, that
in this place it properly signifies, stipulatio, a covenant or promise. As it
is interpreted by the Glossaries, (...), and (...), stipulatio, (...), Promitto
spondeo, stipulor. In which sense I conceive (...) is also to be taken, Sirac.
c. 33. v. 3. (...), Homo sensatus credet legi, and lex ei fidelis, sicut
sponsio vel stipulatio justorum, A man of understanding will trust the Law, and
the Law will be Faithful unto him, as the promise or covenant of the Just. It Is
true, It properly signifies, rogatio, but as rogatio legis among the Latins was
used for legis latio, and for the Law it self, and rogare legem, for legem
far or statuere, because it was the custom that the Magistrate when at any
time a Law was to be enacted, did ask the people, Rogaret populum, Velitis,
jubeatis ne Quirites hoc fieri? Do you desire or will, that this be a Law? upon
whose answer that they did, the Law was published, and this was called rogatio
legis, or the enacting of a Law, so was (...) and (...) with the Greeks, though
properly it signifies rogatio, for the same reasons taken for stipulatio, or a
covenant, nay we have in our Holy-okes Etymological Dictionary, rogare,
stipulari, and surely the Law it self is nothing but a covenant. I say for the
same reasons; for as Pomponius tells us, Stipulatio, was, Verborum conceptio
quibus is qui interrogatur dicturum facturumve se quod interrogatus est,
responderit, A conception of words wherewith he that was asked, did answer that
he would say or do the thing which he was asked; and that it took its name from
the Interrogator, as the worthier person, was the opinion of Accursius and
other Interpreters of the Law. All which does suit very well in our present
case. For in Ancient times, when the Catechumeni, who were to be Baptized, were
interrogated by the Priest, whether they did believe in the Resurrection of the
dead, and the life to come, upon their answer that they did, the covenant was
accepted, and they were by him immediately Baptized in that Faith, as you may
see in Chrysostom and others, the like custom whereunto is still retained in
our Church when in time of Baptism, to the question of the Minister, Will thou
be Baptized in this Faith? the Sponsors or Sureties forthwith answer, it is our
desire. And this I take to be the Apostles meaning of (...) in this place. I
have insisted the longer on these words, that I might more evidently show, that
the proper end of Baptism is to represent the death and Resurrection of Jesus
Christ, and our Faith in it, and not properly a sign of washing from the filth
of sin, which the Apostle seems expressly in these words to deny, though many
think or at least speak otherwise.

C. 4. v. 4. (...). By a familiar trajection, In quo hospitantur blaspemantes,
non concurrentibus vobis in eandem luxuriae confusionem, Wherein they abide
continue or rest or lodge themselves blaspheming, you not running together with
them into the same excess of riot. (...), hospitatur, Act. c. 10. v. 6.

V. 6. (...). I suppose in this place, to make the construction and the sense
agree, you must understand the article, (...), before (...), and before (...),
a thing very frequent; or resume the Participle (...) in the third verse,
altering only the case. And then render it, For to this end was the Gospel
preached to them that are dead, that they may be condemned who were according
to men in the flesh, but that those who were according to God in the spirit may
live. Or thus, that they may be condemned who walked after men in the flesh,
and they live who walked after God in the spirit.

temperance, with your temperance patience, with your patience godliness, with
your godliness brotherly kindness, and with your brotherly kindness charity.
(...) is frequently put for (...). I cannot but think that the Apostle in this
place had some reflection on the Ancient customs of the Heathen, when they lead
their Chorus. For (...) does properly signify, Chorum ducere, or in Choro
ducere, To lead a Chorus, or in a Chorus, Now in their Chorus, (...), they were
complicated together, Steph. or as in Homer, (...),
They danced holding one another hands by the palm, waiting each on other, or
Ministering each to other, from whence this word seems to have obtained these
several significations. But behold here a goodly Chorus of Graces, where Faith
leads the Chorus, and the rest of the Graces wait all upon her, as it were
mutually joined by the hands, and sustaining each the other. And this sense I
suppose may well fit (...), Col. c. 2. v. 19. and (...), Ephesians. c. 4. v. 16.

V. 20. (...), Quod omnis Prophetia Scripturae propria interpretatione non fit.
Thus the Interlineary and the Old Latin Interpreter. That every Prophecy of
Scripture is not fulfilled in the proper interpretation, or that every Prophecy

Authors, (...), Phavor. Though others think it more Grammatical to Translate it
thus, Quod omnis Prophetia Scripture propriae interpretationis non est, That
every Prophecy of Scripture is not of its proper interpretation. But Translate
it which way you will the sense is still the same, all one as if he had said,
That every Prophecy was not accomplished according to the litteral, that is the
proper meaning of the Scripture. For Prophesies have for the most part a
typical, mystical, or analogical sense, though some time, some Prophecy has a
literal one, as that concerning Josiah, 1 King, c. 13. v. 2. and some time a
literal and mystical, Isai. c. 7. v. 14. and that of the Son of the Prophetess,
Isai. c. 8. v. 3, 4. As many of the Fathers do expound it. And this sense does
fitly agree with the context, v. 19. We have also a more sure word of Prophecy
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shines in a dark
place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. What I
beseech you is this light that shines in a dark place, but the Prophesies of
Christ, in the proper interpretation of the Scripture, that is in the letter
obscure and wrapped up in darkeness, until the day star of the Gospel do
manifest and declare the type and mystery in their hearts, and therefore he
tells them, that they ought to know this chiefly, and to take heed that they
stuck not too much in the naked letter, but that they should rather turn their
minds to the meaning of the Prophecy, to the mystery which was covered in the
letter, or written word. For, as it follows, v. 21. Prophecy came not of old
time by the will of man, that is, they did not Prophecy in old time of their
own head according to their own will, but holy men of God spoke as they were
inspired, and acted by the holy spirit, in figures, riddles, types and
mysteries, that those who saw (...), the letter of the Scripture, or the
written word, might not see (...), the solution, or interpretation of it,
unless to whom the day star of the Gospel was risen in their hearts.

Chapter 2. v. 22.

(...), To words that are in themselves negative the Atticks add a negation,
whereof you may see Animad. on 1 Timothy c. 4. v. 3. Who is a liar but he that
denies that Jesus is the Christ? he is Antichrist who denies the Father and
the Son, Whosoever denies the Son has not the Father. It is unseasonable and
needless to add those words which follow in the English, and are restored by
them and Beza out of the Syriack and Latin copies, they being wanting in the
Greek. To wit. He that acknowledges the Son has the Father also, Which words
are indeed altogether superfluous, and serve to no use, but rather destroy the
sense. For those words, Who ever denies the Son, has not the Father, are a
mere proof of the antecedent proposition, That he is Antichrist who denies the
Father and the Son, by an answer to a tacit objection. As if, if any should
object, I am not Antichrist, for I do not Deny the Father and the Son, for I
acknowledge the Father, it should be immediately replied, Yea, but thou art
Antichrist, whoever thou art and say so, and deniest the Son, for he who
denies the Son, has not the Father. For every one that loves him that begat,
loves him that is begotten of him, c. 5. v. 1. And he who honors not the
Son, honors not the Father who sent him, Joh. c. 5. v. 23.

of Christ exhibited in the type of the Lamb which from the beginning of the
world was slain by Abel for a Sacrifice, whereby he testified his Faith in
Christ to come, and offered himself a Sacrifice for the sins of the world. But
perhaps we may better say with the Greek Scholiast, (...), It is an Hyperbaton,
as if we were to read, Whose names are not written from the foundation of the
world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain. As were theirs which did
not worship the Dragon, such as were in the Greek Scholiast, (...), All those
that were Martyrs for their piety in the Old Testament, as also Luke says in
his Gospel, c. 10. v. 20. Rejoice that your names are written in heaven. And
for confirmation of this Hyperbaton, we read c. 17. v. 8. And they that dwell
on the earth shall wonder, (...), Whose names are not written in the book of
life from the foundation of the world, Where no mention at all is made of the
Lamb that was slain. Which is a kind of demonstration, that the words are to be
understood as they are before rendered according to the Scholiast.
