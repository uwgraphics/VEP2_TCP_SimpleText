AN INFORMATION OF THE Present condition of Affairs, AND DECLARATION Concerning
Present DUTIES from the COMMISSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, UNTO THE KIRK AND
KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND.

EDINBVRGH, Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. 1648.

Edinburgh, 9. October 1648. Post meridiem.
AS the only wise God is pleased to exercise his people, and carry on his work
in these Kingdoms with many strange revolutions of providence, so it becomes us
according to the variety of his dispensation to declare and make known unto the
Land the condition of the affairs of his house and the deuties which he calls
for in regard of the same.

After the foundation of that unlawful Engagement against England, so
destructive to Religion and the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, was laid in the
Isle of Wight, by the unhappy and sinful compliance of the Commissioners and
others of this Kingdom with his Majesty's purposes and desires; It was carried
on and concluded by a prevailing party of Malignant and disaffected men in the
Parliament, notwithstanding of the dissent and protestation of a considerable
number of the House who had been straight and active in the cause of God from
the beginning, and of the free and faithful warnings of the servants of God,
and the supplications of many Synods, Presbyteries and Shires to the contrary;
And was violently prosecute unto the great oppression of the Lords people in
their consciences persons and estates and unto the taking of Berwick and
Carlisle, and invading the Kingdom of England with a numerous Army under the
conduct of the Duke of Hamiltoun, until the Lord beholding the affliction of
his people and taking notice of the Pride and Blasphemy of the adversary did
scatter that Army, and bring upon them so shameful and total an overthrow, as
may be a witness unto the following generations of his sore displeasure
against the breakers of his Covenant and dispisers of his word: Wherein we do
not desire that any should rejoice according to the flesh, but wish that it may
be sanctified to those on whom it has fallen that they may repent, and unto the
lovers of God and his cause that they may acknowledge his work, and trust in
his name for the time to come.

A little before the defeat of those Forces in England, the well affected party
in this Land thought it necessary, and had resolved to bestir themselves upon
their former principles for the good of Religion and the safety of the Kingdom,
and their own defense and safety against the Tyranny and oppression of the
Malignant party, who were now wreathing their yoke upon the necks of honest
men by a second levy, and divine providence making the certain news of the
defeat tryst with the beginning of their motions, they looked upon it as an
invitation and encouragement from the Lord to follow their former resolutions
with the greater celerity and speed: And whilst they were advancing toward
Edinburgh for that end, some who had been active promoters of the Engagement
against England did issue out Commissions to classed Rebels and Incendiaries
to take Arms for acting their former mischief and cruelty, and taking
themselves into the fields did invite unto their help the Irish Forces under
the command of George Monro, and some other remnants of the scattered Army in
England, for keeping themselves still in capacity and power to prosecute their
own interests and ends, and carry on the Engagement; as is evident from their
letters of the 28 August sent to the Earl Marshall Vicount or Dudope, Clerk
Regester and George Monro (ten days after the defeat of the Army in England.)
Wherein speaking of the Engagement, they declare their resolutions to recruit
their Regiments, and to hazard their lives and fortunes and all that was
dearest unto them for carrying on against all opposition whatsoever, that pious
and loyal service, and that they and many others of this Kingdom did intend
not to live and outlive it. But afterward finding, themselves at disadvantage
did move for an accommodation upon such terms as were not only dishonorable
and dangerous but sinful and unjust, as including a real approbation of the
Engagement against England, and a continuing of these in place and power, who
had been mainly isntrumental in all the present evils: Yet that it might
appear how willing those with whom they had to do were to hearken to the
motions of peace, and to prevent the shedding of blood, they were content that
some of both sides should meet for composing of differences in a just and fair
way; And the Commission of the General Assembly also resolved to send some of
their number to exhort them to repentance and persuade them to just and
necessary overtours of peace, or if they should continue in their wicked way to
intimate to them that they would be necessitate to proceed against them with
the sentence of excommunication. A Treaty with cessation of Arms, during the
time thereof being concluded on both sides, in the mean while before any
meeting, the enemy marched unto Stirling, and surprising the Forces which were
there (who were secure upon the advertisement of the Treaty) did kill some, and
take others prisoners, and possess themselves of the Town and Bridge and
passes there, and left no means unessayed for strengthening and increasing of
their Army by laboring for a supply of Forces from the High-lands, and the
Northern Shires: Yet notwithstanding of this hightning of differences by such a
way of dealing, The Noblemen and Gentlemen in Arms for the Covenant, in
pursuance of their former resolutitions of Peace did intertain the motion of
the Treaty, and sent four of their number unto the place of meeting at
Woodside, with Overtours of disbanding all Forces on both sides, and referring
all things concerning Religion unto the General Assembly and their
Commissioners, and all Civil bussinesse unto a lawful and free Parliament.
And albeit those things could not but satisfy all unbyassed men, and that
they* who went from the Commission of Assembly did freely and faithfully acquit
themselves in all things which they had in charge, yet did they not condescend
or agree to accept of those conditions, And some days being spent in
fruitless debates, The Committee of Estates who were then returned unto
Edinburgh, consisting of such persons only as had dissented from the
Engagement, considering that as yet they had no modelled Army, and that those
in Stirling were strengthening themselves unto the raising a new and dangerous
war, did take in deliberation what was fit for them to do in such an exigent;
And whilst they were about their resolutions therein, they were informed by
letters from the English Forces, that they did resolve to prosecute the war
until their Enemies were put out of a condition of growing unto a new Army,
and the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle were reduced, and that they were
advanced into Scotland for pursuance of those ends; And the Committee not
finding themselves in a posture at that time, and that they could not in
Justice refuse to suffer the Englishes to pursue those who had invaded their
Kingdom, sent some of their number unto Berwick and Carlisle to persuade the
rendering of those Garrisons, and unto the English Army to take care that their
coming into the Kingdom of Scotland might be without any prejudice to
Religion and as little detriment to the Country as possible: A few days
thereafter the Forces at Stirling accepted of the conditions offered unto them
by the Committee of Estates.

It shall be needless to insist upon the vindication of the rising of these
Noblemen and Gentlemen and others that took Arms for the Covenant, the Tyranny
of those with whom they had to do being insupportable, and such as threatened
ruin and desolation to the Land, and tended unto the rending a sunder of the
Union betwixt the Kingdoms, the overturning of the work of God, and the putting
of an Arbitrary and unlimited power unto the hands of the King, and the setting
up of the Popish Prelaticall and Malignant party, for acting all their
mischievous and wicked designs; And they who took Arms being a considerable
part of the Parliament who had dissented from and protested against the
Engagement, and had been the chief instruments of carrying on the Lords work
from the beginning, and having assisting unto them many others of place and
power, and having also for them the body of the people of the Land, and the
Ministry and all the Judicatories of the Kirk, and being obliged by the
Covenant to promove this cause against all lets and Impediments whatsoever, It
were also needless to take pains in proving the sinfulness and unlawfulness
of the Engagement against the Kingdom of England, The General Assembly having
done it so fully from the word of God and from the Covenant, and the Lord
having engraven upon it so visible charactars of his heavy displeasure, not
only by giving up most of the instruments that were employed in it unto the
lust of their own heart to commit all sort of wickedness with greediness; But
also by so shameful and total a defeat of that Army, as has few paralells i^
(...) age; It shall be more useful in this posture of affa^^^, whilst the Lord
is breaking the horn and ^^^ging down the power and pride of Enemies, for (...)
one in the Land to consider his work and to regard the ^peration of his hands,
And therefore in the first (...)

1. It do^^ c^^^^rn all the Authors, Promoters and Abettors of (...) ^ick^^
^ourse, and all these who comply with the p^rposes and designs of the
Malignant party throughout the Land, to behold the Majesty of the Lord, and his
hand lifted up in behalf of his people, that they may learn Righteousness, and
dash themselves no more against the rock of his displeasure, by continuing to
oppose his work and disturb the peace of his people. The Lord has now for ten
years past showen himself against them in all their devices and designs; And
though he has many times suffered them to conceive mischief, yet they have
always traveled with vanity and brought forth the wind,. They have always
been snared in the work of their own hands, and their devises have returned
upon their own heads, yea their most subtle and malicious plots have in a
strange way of dispensation from him who is wonderful in counsel and
excellent in working, turned to the advantage of the Lords cause and good of
his people; And if they be not wise at last to observe and see these things, as
their way is delusion so the end hereof shall be bitterness and death? There
could be nothing more satisfying to us, then that the spirit of Malignancy were
banished from the hearts of men, and the name of Malignants buried never to be
revived nor remembered any more amongst us; And could such be induced to quite
their profane and formal way, and to turn unto God, we are confident that all
the enemity that they have against his work and his people, should quickly
evanish and that they should find mercy and comfort; But as long as they stand
at a distance with the Lord in regard of their private condition and carriage,
what wonder is it though they have no love to his cause nor his servants: We
wish that God may give them repentance, that they may recover themselves out of
the snare of Satan and come to amendment.

2. What ever shall be the frunt of the Lords work in these, It concerns such
who were formerly oppressed in their consciences persons and estates in this
day of reviving and delivery, to remember their ways and be ashamed as for all
the evil thereof, so for the great cumvence and countenance they gave unto
disaffected and Malignant men, and carried on that wicked War that has been
the cause of so much sin and misery unto this poor Land. Neither is it to be
forgotten that though many keep their conscienees pure, and did rather choose
to suffer the spoiling of their goods, and to expose themselves to the hazard
of all the violence and oppression of these who carried on the Engagement, then
to sin against God; yet not a few even of these who wish well to the Lords work
whether through fear or earthly mindedness gave so far place unto their
wrath, as in some measure to comply with the evil of their course, by giving
obedience unto their unlawful command, in putting out Horse and Foot, and
advancing moneys for that end, who albeit they have many things to plead for
themselves before men, yet their way has not been straight before the Lord who
searches the hearts and ponders the paithes.

3. It is high time for those in whose hands the Lord has again put the
managing of public affairs from dear bought experience to learn Wisdom, and
avoid the rocks upon which they have formerly split. Carnal counsel, foolish
pity and self interest made many of these not only to slack their hands and
remit their zeal against the opposers and underminers of the Lords work, But
also to receive them unto public counsels and employments; And if after this
way has been so much cursed of God unto them, they should again fall therein,
as the fault will be without excuse, so it cannot but bring some strange
testimony of the Lords displeasure, upon these, who, after that he has punished
them less then their iniquities do deserve, and given them such deliverance do
again return to break his Commandment by joining with the people of these
abominations: And therefore we trust that such will take heed that they be not
again deceived, neither by the carnal counsel of their own hearts from
within, nor by the fawnings and flatteries of these men from without.

As the Malignancie of some, and unrighteous dealing and loose and scandalous
walking of others in Judicatories and Armies and places of power and trust in
the Kingdom, have been a main cause of all the evils both of Sin and punishment
under which the Land groans; So it concerns these whom God has called
thereunto, to endeavor the Reforming and purging of Judicatories and Armies,
by removing from them all Malignant and scandalous persons, especially those
who have been Authors, Promoters or Abettors of the Engagement against England
and of the course pursued by the forces at Sterling under the command of the
Earl of Lanerk and George Monro, And that all places of power and trust may be
filled with men of known integrity and affection to the Cause of God and of a
blameless and Christian conversation. So shall Malignancie, injustice,
iniquity, profaneness, and impiety be suppressed and punished, and Religion
and righteousness be advanced and the blessing of the Lord shall be upon all
public proceedings, and his pleasure shall prosper in the hand of public
instruments: And though this duty may be attended with many difficulties, yet
it being such as without it we cannot expect any delivery from present evil, or
any stable enjoyment either of present or future blessings, We trust it shall
be seriously minded by those whom it concerns: Let them deal courageously and
the Lord shall be with the good.

Albeit the former design of the Malignant party be defeat, and their power
broken in both Kingdoms, yet it shall be no wisdom to be secure, as though
there were no more evil or danger to be apprehended from them, who retaining
their former principles will no doubt still study to drive their old designs:
And therefore as it would be the care of every one, to avoid their snares
discover their subtilties, and oppose their ways; So it concerns those who are
in power and authority in a special way to take heed that they do not trouble
the peace of the Land: And it does no less concern the watchmen of the Lords
house, both to endeavor to keep their People pure, that they be not infected
with Errors of Sectaries nor drawn away from the Truth, and also to purge out
from among them the leaven of Malignancie and prophanity, and to give timous
and faithful warning of dangers on all hands, and to exhort to a faithful
performance of all the duties, that the Lord calls them unto in these times,
especially of that solemn public acknowledgment of sins and the renewing of
the League and Covenant now resolved upon. It is a great obligation from the
Lord upon all that have been faithful amongst the Ministry in this Land, That
he was not only pleased in the day of temptation, to keep them in a straight
path, and to give them to speak his word withal boldness, notwithstanding of
the threatenings of enemies, but to preserve them from the wrath of men and to
confirm their testimony by so real a Declaration of his displeasure from
heaven, against these who despised the message of God in their mouths, which
should encourage all who speak in his name to do their duty faithfully and
without fear.

In the last place it is incumbent to all the Lords people throughout the Land
from the sense of his mercies and rods, to draw near unto him by unfeigned
Repentance and real Reformation; And as to mourn for all the breaches of the
Solemn League and Covenant, so to prepare themselves for the renewing thereof
with these suitable affection and dispositions that become so grave and great a
work, that his wrath may be turned away from them, and that they being
delivered out of the hands of their enemies may serve him without fear all the
days of their life in holiness and righteousness.
