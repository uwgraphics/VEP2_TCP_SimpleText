AN ACT For Encouraging PROTESTANT-STRANGERS And Others, To Inhabit and Plant
in the KINGDOM of IRELAND.
FORASMVCH as the Late Intestine Troubles and cruel Wars have much despoiled
and wasted this Your Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland, whereby the Trade and
Commerce thereof is much decoyed and lessened for want as well of Merchants,
Traders and Dealers of Ability to exercize a Traffic as of skilful Artificers,
Artizens and Workman for the making and working all Sorts of Manufactures there:

And whereas for this cause many of the Materials and Commodities of the growth
of this Kingdom, as Wool, Flax, Hemp, Woollen and Linen Yarn, Iron, and sundry
others the the like, are usually transported, and carried into Foreign Parts,
there to be wrought and manuf^ctured into sundry Commodities whereby the people
of this Your Majesty's Kingdom are de^ived of the benefit which might arise by
working those materials themselves, and for want of Employment are necessitated
to live idly, and poorly, and so apt to run into Thefts, Robberies, Rebellions,
and all other sorts of Mischiefs, and if any of the Materials and Commodities
aforesaid do happen to be wrought in this Kingdom, either through Unskillfulness
or other indirect practice of the Workmen, they are usually so wrought, as they
are most commonly unfit for wearing at Home, or Merchandising abroad, and
therefore much Coin, and ready Money is carried out, and transported for buying
and purchasing of Foreign Manufactures to the great exhausting and diminishing
the Treasure of this Kingdom:

And whereas many Strangers and other^ from the consideration of Your Majesty's
mos^ Princely Wisdom, Clemency and Goodness, and of the plentifulness of all
sorts of useful and pro*fitable Commodities with which this Your Majesty's
Kingdom abounds in a very great measure, might be induced and inclined to
transport Themselves and Families to the filling and replenishing of this
Kingdom, as well with people as Trade, if such Strangers might be made
Partakers of the Advantages, Liberties and Privileges which this Kingdom has
formerly and does still enjoy, under the most Gracious and Benign Government of
Your Majesty, and Your most Royal Predecessors, and have the free Exercize of
their Trades, Mysteries, Crafts and Sciences of buying, selling, working and
manufacturing the said Materials without Interruption and Disturbance.

May it therefore please Your most Excellent Majesty that it may be Enacted,
And Be it Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice
and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons in this
present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority thereof, That all and every
person and persons born out of Your Majesty's Dominions, of the Protestant
Religion, and all Merchants, Traders and Dealers in any Goods, Wares or
