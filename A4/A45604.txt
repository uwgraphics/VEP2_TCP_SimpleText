AN Appeal to thy Conscience, As thou will answer it at the day of Judgment,
Whether it be not lawful for a Nation to take up Arms, in the defense of
Religion Law, and the Office of a King, etc.
IT is the common discourse, among those that make seeming Loyalty to his
Majesty, their pretense of Malignancy to the Parliament, that it is unlawful
for a Subject to take up Arms against his Prince, or a Parliament, (as they
generally allege) to raise an Army against a King, though never so wicked in
his Life: nor never so tiranicall in his Government.

Under which pretense, they would manifest to his Majesty and to the world,
that it is their mere loyalty to his Majesty that does thus predominate in
them, and not any sinister end to themselves, when on the contrary, I will
instantly manifest unto you, by an undeniable argument, that it is merely a
covetous desire to secure them selves from that charge, which the common
callamity of this Kingdom requires, and not love to the King, nor from any
cause that they can really ground a hate or dislike to the Parliament, or their
proceedings.

You may be pleased to remember, that not many years ago, there was a (...) of
Ship Money imposed upon the Kingdom, which tax was pretended and avouched to
be warrantable by Law, by some that are very active in this War against the
Parliament, and and I am certain it was seconded with the Kings Authority, yet
then you may remember what General muttering there was against the King and
Nobillity, one cried out, the laws were abused, another wispered, the King was
misled by then these now strong Royalists, were Anti-Rounheads, then their
loyalty was not so great, neither were they so forward as they now profess,
(though in my conscience they never intend any such thing) to spend their lives
and estates in the defense of his Majesty, no, the very thought of parting with
a little money, had banished those thoughts out of their Breasts, then God send
us a Parliament, etc. Now compare the time past, with the time present, God has
been pleased to send them a Parliament who redressed those grievances of which
they so much complained, for which they thought themselves deeply engaged, but
now the practices of those persons, before mentioned, being grown to such a
dangerous head, that the necessity of the Kingdom enforces the Parliament to
leavy money for the raising and maintaining of Forces, to bring those to
condign punishment, that were the authors of those so much lamented
distractions both in Church and State, now they slip their necks out of the
Collar, nay think they if they raise war, we must part with money, and
therefore we will stand for peace, they could have else no pretense for their
malignity, those men that they formerly so much complained of, are honest men,
and good Protestants, and the Parliament is now the only obstacle, is not this
apparent, can thou whatsoever thou art clear thy self, where was thy Loyaty
to thy King then, why did thou not apply the lesson to thy self then, which
now thou appliest to others, (Give Caesar his due) it is easily proved that he
had as much right to that as to many things, which thou at this time pretendest
to be due to him.

To begin with thy main pretense, with which thou would deceive the world,
and do deceive thy own Soul.

Thou pretendest that it is not lawful for a Nation to take up Arms against a
King misled, in the maintenance of Religion, Law, the Office of a King, and
safety of the Kingdom, when the Religion, Laws, and Office of a King are
abused, and brought to apparent ruin.

Object. But you will object that you se none of these things in danger, which
are pretended.

Solution. It is not unknown to those that will not declare themselves ignorant
or wilful, that there were several Innovations crept into our worship, and
doctrine, nay they were enforced, and imposed, by those soul killing Prelates,
whose Idolatrous crimes, being neither punished, nor repented of, has caused
God to throw among us these Babels confusions, this diversity of tongues, and
diversity of opinions, each opposing other in the maintenance of that Religion
which their Sophistry has spoiled, and in so doing has destroyed the whole
Kingdom, and if the purging the Church of these innovations, and setting up a
true worship, with the endeavoring to bring those to a legal trial, that
were guilty of the said misdemeanors, to the end that they may receive the
reward of their labor, be not agreeable to the laws of God and the Kingdom,
may easily be discerned.

The like argument may serve concerning the abuse of the laws, but I shall
forbear to mention the particulars thereof, only I will appeal to thy own
conscience whether the laws were not abused, and leave it to the to consider
by whom and whose authority.

As touching the Kings Office, or the Office of the King, I shall insist upon
that, as the main thing which concerns this discourse, and upon which this
difference is grounded.

The Kings of England at their Coronation, swear solemnly to maintain the
Laws of the Land, and to govern the Land according to the Laws and Govenment
thereof, so that it rests not in the Kings power to alter the government of the
Kingdom, and to bring in a new, for he must maintain the ancient established
Laws of the Kingdom, and must govern by them, for the Laws of the Kingdom,
are the protection of the Subject, by which it is apparent, that it is the
Office of a King, (to which he stands engaged by his Oath taken at his
Coronation) to preserve the Laws, and to govern by the Laws, in which
consists the health and wealth, ipeace and security both of his Majesty, his
royal off spring, and the whole Kingdom.

Now if the King be wrought upon by evil Council, so that he is drawn
personally to make breach of the Laws, which by his Office and Oath he is
bound to preserve, without all question there is a dirivative power from the
first Principle of Law, from which the People may claim a lawful authority to
use the most effectual means to preserve themselves with the Office of the
King, and Laws of the Kingdom, from the violence of the King so sedued and
misled, for the Kingdoms safety is the supreme Law.

Now that the King was misled we may suspect, otherwise how came so many
Projects to be granted under the great Seal, which Projects granted by his
Majesty were great breaches of the Law, and great oppressions to the Subject,
and contrary to the Office of a King, which is to preserve the Subject from
oppression, and to maintain the Laws in full force and virtue.

And the King and Kingdom being thus abused by evil Counselors, to whom
could we the oppressed Subject appeal, if we did attempt to petition his
Majesty, we should meet with so many bribe taking Courtiers, between the
Porters Lodge and the Presence, that either we wanted money to purchase
preferrers, or else through the multiplicity of hands, our Petition was
presented to God knows who, and we had an answer God knows when, so that
despairing of redress, we were forced to return home to repent, or at least to
lament the abuse of Justice. If we petitioned the Judges, (especially the major
part of them) they must have a Bribe too, and at last, after four or five
Terms attendance, we should have answer returned (contrary to all reason) that
the Laws were so, and we must suffer. Thus at all hands the Laws were
abused, and most were officious to conceal the complaint of the Subject, the
King must not know the truth, all was Law, all was for the good of the Subject,
when their chief Design was, at one blow to destroy the Religion, Law,
Office, Authority, and Liberty, both of King, Parliament, and People.

The King and Kingdom being thus involved, and entangled in these destructive
Strattagems, the Laws of the Kingdom having lost their power, and all things
being become a Chaos of disorder, what (...) shall be used to reduce things to
their first Order, for certainly (although the King neglect it) the Kingdom
may, and ought to take order for its own safety, why surely a Parliament (in
which is represented the whole Body of the Kingdom) must be the safest, and
most effectual means, to redress former, and prevent future evils, now this
Parliament carries with it a near resemblance to the composition of the
Government of this Nation, being compounded of three degrees, the King, the
Peers, and Commons, all which should join together in the regulating and
reforming those things which were so burdensome to the Commonwealth, but if
the King shall neglect to join with his great Counsel, the Lords and Commons
of the Kingdom, and shall adhere to those evil Councillors, which have been
the authors of those former evils, for reforming of which the Parliament was
called, and shall not only neglect the Office of a King, which is to preserve
the laws and People from oppression, but shall join with those persons, which
have been such apparent Enemies to himself and the whole Kingdom, in the
abetting and maintaining those lawless practices against the Parliament, and
so consequently against the whole Kingdom: Now speak thy Conscience, without
fear or flattery, as thou will answer it at the dreadful day of Judgment,
where all secrets shall be known, whether thou think it most warrantable to
join with a King so misled, in the maintenance of such a cause, undertaken by
Papists and their adherents, Projectors, and their dependents, Delinquents and
deboist and despicable persons, or to ioyn with a Parliament, which has
reformed all those former practizes and abuses, and does endeavor to prevent
the like practices for the Future, and does daily labor to maintain the laws
in force, with the just Authority of the King, to the glory of God, and the
good of the whole Kingdom, now judge I say whether it be lawful for the
Parliament, which is the representative Body of the Kingdom, and was called
together to consult and conclude of those affairs which did conduce most unto
the security both of King and Kingdom: Now Judge I say whether it be not
lawful for them, in the behalf of the King and his just Authority, the Laws
of the Land, and the Kingdom in general, (all which are endangered by this
abused authority) to raise an Army to oppose those persons who have thus abused
the King, in telling him that was Law which was oppression, have caused him to
neglect his Office, and abuse his power, in giving way to have an Army raised
against himself, his Parliament and People, to protect them from the censure
of the Law, making a way to their own security, through the ruin of his
Majesty, and the whole Kingdom, and if (as I conceive, thou must be convinced
for Conscience must strike a true alarm) thou find thy own error, banish
that covetous desire out of thy heart, and seem not loyal from the teeth
outward, let not thy Purse only, be employed in forwarding this acceptable
service, but if thou art of ability, let thy Person second thy Purse, for know
it for a truth, in so doing, thou shall do God, thy King, thy Country, and thy
Soul good service, and it shall be imputed to the for good, and not for evil,
when Haman shall be hanged, then Mordecay shall be clothed in the Kings
Garments, and the religious Jews, respected by their gracious Sovereign.

God save the King and Parliament.
