By the King, A PROCLAMATION For Restraining all His Majesty's Subjects, but
the Members and Agents of the East India Company, to Trade in the East Indies,
and Recalling such as are there.
JAMES R.

Whereas the sole Trade to the East Indies, by diverse Royal Grants, as well of
the late King Our Dearly Beloved Brother of ever Blessed Memory, as other Our
Noble Progenitors, has been heretofore Granted to the Governor and Company of
the Merchants of London, Trading to the East Indies, with express Prohibition
to all other their Subjects to Trade there, and that such Trade by the great
Industry, Charge and Expense of the said Company, has for several years last
past, been maintained and carried on to the great Honor and Profit of the
Nation, till of late that several ill disposed Persons preferring their
peculiar Gain before the Profit and Reputation of the Nation, and to the utter
decay and overthrow of so beneficial a Trade to this Kingdom, which cannot be
Supported without the joint Assistance and Managery by a Company, have in a
Clandestine and Disorderly manner Traded into those Parts, in express
Disobedience, not only to the several Prohibitions contained in those Letters
Patents, but to diverse Royal Proclamations set forth for that purpose, pursuant
to the undoubted Prerogative of the Crown for Licencing, Limiting, and
Regulating such Foreign Trade into so remote parts of the World. And whereas
the late King Our Dearly beloved Brother, out of his abundant Grace and
Tenderness to his Subjects, was Graciously pleased to permit his unquestionable
Prerogative in that point, to be Argued and Disputed at the Common Law, to the
intent his Subjects might be without any excuse for their Disobedience, which
having received a public Decision and Determination in Our Highest Ordinary
Court of Common Law; We do expect from all Our Loving Subjects an entire
Obedience thereunto; And at the humble Petition of the said Company, We do
give Leave, and Direct, That such Offenders, who contrary to the said Letters
Patents and Proclamations, have Contumaciously Invaded the said Trade, in
Contempt of the Crown and Dignity of Our late Brother, be proceeded against at
Law, in Our Name, to the intent they may be Punished according to their
Demerits. And to the end all Our Loving Subjects may for the future avoid the
Forfeitures and Penalties, which may be incurred by their Disobedience in this
behalf; We have thought fit, by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council, to
Publish Our Royal Pleasure to be, and We do hereby strictly Prohibit and
Forbid all and every Our Loving Subjects whatsoever, Except the said Company
and their Successors, and others Trading by the said Companies License; to
Trade into, Visit, or Haunt the said East Indies, or any Port, Creek, Haven or
Place within the Limits in the said Company's Charter, Granted to them by Our
late Brother in the Thirteenth Year of His Reign, upon Pain of Our High
Displeasure, and of being Proceeded against as Contemners of Our Laws and Royal
Authority, and also of incurring the Forfeiture and Loss of the Goods and
Merchandises, and the Ships and Vessels with their Furniture, when and so often
as they shall be taken or found Trading or Navigating within any of the Ports,
Rivers, Creeks, Havens or Places within the Limits of the said Company's
Charter, or beyond the Cape of Bona Speranza: And to the end Our Will and
Pleasure herein may be the better Observed and Executed, We do hereby also
strictly Require and Command Our Governors, Deputy Governors, Admirals,
Vice-Admirals, Generals, Judges of Our Courts of Admiralty, Commanders of Our
Forts and Castles, Captains of Our Royal Ships, Provost-Marshals, Marshals,
Comptrollers, Collectors of Our Customs, VVaitors, Searchers, and all other Our
Officers and Ministers, Civil and Military by Sea or Land, in all and every Our
Foreign Dominions and Plantations, and also all and singular Captains and
Commanders of Ships, and all other Persons employed or to be employed in the
Service of the said East India Company, to be aiding and assisting to Attack,
Arrest, Take and Seize for Our Use the Ship or Ships, Vessel or Vessels with
their Furniture, Goods, VVares, and Merchandises, of all and every Our
Subjects, other then the said Company and their Successors, and such as shall
be Employed or Licensed by them, which they shall find on Sea or Land, within
the Limits of Our said Charter Granted to the said Company, according to the
Tenor of the said Charter Granted to the said Company, and to proceed to
Condemnation thereof in any of Our Courts in Our said Foreign Dominions and
Plantations, upon Pain of Our High Displeasure, and as they will Answer the
Contrary at their Perils: And We do by this Our Proclamation Require and
Command all and every of Our Subjects except such who are of the said Company,
or Employed or Licensed by the said Company, who are or reside within any of
the Parts and Places in the East Indies, or within any of the Limits of the
said Companies Charter, or are upon the Seas in order to their Voyages thither,
that they and every of them do within the space of Eight Months next ensuing
after the Date hereof return into this Our Kingdom upon Pain and Penalty that
shall fall thereon.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the First Day of April 1685. In the First
Year of Our Reign.
