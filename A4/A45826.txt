In Georgium Keithum Caledonium Apostatam EPIGRAMMA, Lucis Triumphum, and
Keithi cum Coni^^atis suis Catastrophen Praenuncians.
KEithus, Ecebolius, Jul'anus Apostata factus,
Antiquae Fidei perditus Hostis adest.
Credula belligeros memoravit Fama Gigantes,
Caelos Stultitia qui petiere sua.
Sed nova Bella parat Keithus, superatque Gigantes;
Fictum illi, Hic Verum jam petit ecce Deum.
Difficile est Keitho nihil, ipsum Acheronta movebit,
In Lucem Satyras ut Vomat ille feras.
Ast invicta stetit, stabitque per omnia Secla
Lux, Victo Keitho Sacricolisque suis,
The same in English Paraphrase.
An Epigram, upon George Keith, the Caledonian Light, and Overthrow of Keith
and his Accomplices.
KEith, Ecebolius-like now leads the Van
Of The Forlorn Hope; Apostate Julian!
The Apostolic Faith once owned, but now
This Renegade the same does disavow.
Poetic Stories Fab'lously Report,
On Heaven it self the Giants made Effort.
But Keith out-does them, his proud Folly view;
They a Feigned God attacked, but he the True.
Keith nothing Scares, into Black Hell he goes;
Thence Stygian Darkness at the Light he throws.
But the Light has still Triumphed over all
For Ages past, and Triumph ever shall:
Whilst Baffled Keith, who better Things once knew,
May Rave in the Dark with his Benighted Crew.
London, Printed for the Author, 1700.
