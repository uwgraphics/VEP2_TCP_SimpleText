Printed in the Year 1672.

WICKHAM WAKENED, OR The Quakers Madrigall In Rhyme Dogrell.
THe Quaker and his Brats,
Are born with their Hats,
Which a point with two Taggs,
Ty's fast to their Craggs,
Nor King nor Kesar,
To such Knaves as these are,
Do signify more than a Tinker.
His rudeness and pride
So puffs up his hide
That He Is drunk though he be no drinker.
Chorus.
Now since Mayor and Justice
Are assured that thus it is
To abate their increase and redundance
Let us send them to WICKHAM
For there is one will kick 'um
Into much better manners by abundance.
Once the Clown at his entry
Kissed his golls to the Gentry:
When the Lady took upon her,
'Twas God save your Honor:
But now Lord and Pesant,
Do make but one mess on it
Then farewell distinction 'twixt Plowman and Knight.
If the World be thus tossed
The old Proverb is crossed,
For Joan's as good as my Lady in the Light.
Chorus.
Now since Mayor and Justice, etc.
It Is the Gentry that Lulls 'um
While the Quaker begulls 'um:
They dandle 'um in their Lapps,
Who should strike off their Capps,
And make 'um stand bare
Both to Justice and Mayor,
Till when 'twill nere be fair weather;
For now the proud Devel
Has brought forth this Level
None Knows who and who is together.
Now since Mayor and Justice, etc.
Now silence and listen
Thou shall hear how they Christen:
Mother Midnight comes out
With the Babe in a Clout,
It Is Rachell you must know it is*
Good Friends all take notice,
It Is a name from the Scripture arising.
And thus the dry dipper
(Twere a good deed to whip her)
Makes a Christning without a Baptizing.
Now since Moyor and Justice, etc.
Their wedlocks are many,
But Marriages not any,
For they and their dull Sows,
Like the Bulls and the mull Cows,
Do couple in brutify'd fashion:
But still the Official,
Declares that it is all
Matrimonial Fornication.
Now since Mayor and Justice, etc.
Their Lands and their Houses
W'ont fall to their Spouses:
They cannot appoint her
One Turff for a Joynter.
His son and his daughter,
Will repent it hereafter;
For when the Estate is divided;
For the Parents demerit
Some Kinsman will inherit;
Why then let them marry as I did.
But since Mayor and Justice, etc.
Now since these mad Nations
Do cheat their relations,
Pray what better hap then
Can we that are Chapmen,
Expect from their Canting,
Their sighing and panting?
We are they use the house with a steeple,
And then they may Cozen
All us by the Dozen;
For Israel may spoil Pharoahs people.
Now since Mayor and Justice, etc.
The Quaker who before
Did rant and did roar;
Great thrift will now tell ye on.
But it tends to Rebellion:
For his tippling being don,
He has bought him a gun
Which he saves from his former vain spending.
O be drunk again Quaker,
Take thy Canniken and shake her,
For thou art the worse for the mending.
Now since Mayor and Justice, etc.
Then look we about,
And give them a Rout,
Before they Encumber
The Land with their number:
There can be no peace in
These Vermins increasing;
For it is plain to all prudent beholders,
That while we neglect,
They do but expect
A new head to their old man's Shoulders.
Now since Mayor and Justice
Are assured that thus it is:
To abate their increase and redundance
Let us send them to WICKHAM
For there is one will Kick'um
Into much better manners by abundance.
THE END.
