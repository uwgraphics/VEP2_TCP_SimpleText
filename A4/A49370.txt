THE LOYALIST Setting Forth the VVHIGG In his Own COLORS.
A New SONG, To the Tune of Sawny and Jockey.
I.
COme, fill it up, and give me a Brimmer Boy;
Jammey's come home again, with him his Dearest Joy:
Let Us Quaffe it round in spite of the Whiggish Crew,
Jack Catch I hope at last will give the Deele his due.
Let us true Loyal
Subjects Joy all,
In the Blood Royal without denial.
True Hearted.
Are Thwarted,
-- And oftentimes
Parted:
But never will start from their Principles Loyal.
II.
May Whiggish Designs, be always discovered,
The Ills of these Times will then be recovered:
Too lately they did Three Kingdoms Confound,
And made them Drink Healths of their Blood on the Ground.
For whilst the Nation
Is wrought into Passion,
By False Persuasion, Dissimulation:
True Subjects will
Suffer ill,
And bear the Burden
Still,
Till Loyalty is once more out of Fashion.
III.
Let Old Trinomen have his due in the end,
May G -- and M -- think him no more their Friend;
Let them no longer give Ear to his Policy,
For all his Cunning he may gain the Gallow-Tree:
But let them fly him,
No more come nigh him,
With Penitent Sighing, always defye him.
Let Coo -- r
Have fair Play,
C^re, Curtiss,
Janeway;
Jack Gatch can teach them the true way of dying.
IV.
Why should false Zeal expose us to Evil,
Where Out-sides's all Saint, and Insides's all Devil;
For thus it has proved e're since Reformation,
When Presbyter Swayes, Kings are out of Fashion:
Too late it was their Cry,
Let him die, Popery
Will through the Kingdom flee, stand for the Cause Boy:
We the Land
By our Hands,
Will Command
Who Withstands,
Shall for a Traitor unto the State die.
V.
Thus when the Zealots the Power had got,
True Subjects Estates, nay Lives went to Pot:
Then all were Rebels that Fought for their King,
And Damned Sequestration was then the next thing:
Choose, cries the City,
A Zealous Committee,
To Cavaleers grant no manner of Pity:
The Old Cause,
Destroys Laws,
Hangs, Draws
For Old Sawes:
And this was Poor Englands late Presbyter Ditty.
VI.
Then let us beware of a second relapse,
Long Live the King and York, cast up your Capps:
Let us endeavor to preserve the Nation
From Subtle Devices, Bills, Associations,
Then let 'em Plot on,
Lot on, Pot on;
In their Cabals Boys, still let 'em Sot;
Let Us Watch 'em,
And Catch 'em,
Dispatch 'em,
Rope Stretch 'em;
Vive le Roy, Then let the Pox Rot 'em.
