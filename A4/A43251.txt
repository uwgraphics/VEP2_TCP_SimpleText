The most true and wonderful NARRATION Of two women bewitched in Yorkshire:
Who coming to the Assizes at York to give in Evidence against the Witch after
a most horrible noise to the terror and amazement of all the beholders, did
vomit forth before the Judges, Pins, wool, and hafts of Knives, etc. All which
was done (to make the wonder more wonderful) without the least drop of blood
or moisture from their mouths. Also a most true Relation of a young Maid not
far from Luyck, who being bewitched in the same manner did (almost incredibly)
vomit forth wadds of straw, with pins a cross in them, iron Nails, Needles,
Points, and whatsoever she had seen in the basket of the witch that did bewitch
her.

As it is attested under the hand of that most famous Physician Doctor Henry
Heers

Together, how it pleased God that she was afterward recovered by the art of
Physic, and the Names of the Ingredients and the manner how to make that rare
Receipt that cured her.

Printed for Tho. Vere, and W. Gilbertson. 1658.

The wonderful Enchantment of two women not far from the City of York, who at
the last Assizes were brought in as evidences against two old Witches and the
most incredible Vomits which they made before the Judges on the Bench; with the
deliberate Counsel of the said Judges thereupon.
THere are some who are of opinion, That there are no Devils, nor any Witches;
but reason it self, and the Rul^ of Contraryes will easily detec^ that gross
Error. Men in this Age are grown so wicked, that they are apt to believe there
are no greater Dive^^s ^^en themselves and many of them do what they can to
justify that belie^.

Man indeed is a Devil unto man both by Temptation, and by cruelty. To his own
corruption he adds the Suggestions of the Devil, and though he star^te^h at
his presence he is apt to entertain his Counsels. Hereupon when the Devil
appears, it is commonly at the first in y^ shape which he knows to be most
agreeable to y^ person to whom he would appear.

We have read in Historyes of some persons who h^ve laid great commands upon
the Devil, which for his own ends he has readily obeyed: but women being the
weaker vessel^, their apprehensions are more sudden and violent. and are
therefore ready to be carried away with the least Temptation.

Du Moulin a famous preacher in France, in his Discourse on The Love of God,
represents That if a man had a good sword, w^erewith he had archieved many
great ^xploits, he would be sure to make much of that sword* he would keep it
bright, and enammell the hilts with all the Arts of the Artificer. In the same
manner (says he) woman being the most dangerous weapon which the Devil has
used to give so many a foil unto man, what does he not contrive to commend and
to increase the temptation of her beauties. He provideth Hypocrisy for her
heart, and ^able patches for her face: He is not wanting for inventions to keep
high her Complexion, and upon all occasions he has her ready in all mod^s and
fashions for the Allurement, and the destruction of men.

Certainly where there is much of vanity, there is but little of modesty or
Religion to be expected. But he insinuates himself even into tender Maids, and
by the Divine permission makes them the sad Subjects of his implacable malice,
And this should warn us of both Sexes to be careful al^ayes to seek for the
Divine protection.

At the Assizes this last Lent at the City of York* there were some old women
Arraigned for witches. The chiefest Evidences that came against them were two
young women, who being brought before yt Judges* did both of them fall into
wonderful fits: at the first time they were troubled with this strange
visitation, it seemed to be convulsion fits, but the possessing disease growi^g
by degrees upon them they began at last with great violence to cry out upon the
gripings which tormented them, and swounding away they did vomit wool, an^
crooked pins. and haf^s of knives, one whereof being of Marble made a great
noise by reason of yt weight of it, as it fell upon the floor. The Judges
desired to s^e it, and it was brought unto them amongst many other things which
these young women vomited.

The Jury being sati^fied with the Evidence and some other Iudictments. did
cast the Witches who ma^e these women to cast so l^mentably: But the Judges
were not thro^ghly satisfied, and therefore they thought it requisite to give
some respite of time for a more deliberate determination, being uncertain
whether this wonderful Vomit proc^^ded from the Devil, or whether i^ were
some artificial combinat^on of the two women to impose upon the Iu^ges, and
^he Court.

I should insist lonegr upon this story, according to your expe^^ation, but
havi^^ (...) same time, the same account in Latin as it is fully in print
expressed by that great an^ famous Scholar Henry ab Heores who wa^ but lately
living, and Physician extraordinary to the most Serene. the Prince Elect^r of
Colen. I h^ve thought it fit in this place to Translate it into English, and to
represent it to you because at large he does declare the Original and the
whole manner of the Disease, and how it pleased God that he should fi^d a cure
by the art of Physic for so wonderful a Visitation but I begin with my author.

A young maid, about nine years of Age; second to none in the City where she
lived. either for beauty or birth. having given unto a witch y^ beg^^ at the
door both bread and beer, did receive from her a leaf of Sorrel, which having
unwarily put into her mouth, and swallowed it down, not long after she was
troubled with convulsion (...) ^wounding awa^ she did fall down as dead. There
were c^ll^ to her help P^ysitians both male and Female (for at Tralectum upon
y^ river of M^sa where this came to pass) both sexes pr^ctice Physic, It was
in y^ month of May; in y^ year 1652.

Many Remedies for many days were applied but to no effect (...) y^ poor maid
being Tormented with (...) grievous fits it was thought expedient (according to
y^ (...) of y^ (...)) yt ^hey should have recourse to the Religious man, who
(...) appeared, and began ^o exercise his Function, b^^ y^ Ma^d began to turn^^
w^e^t^ her body into those form^ which (...) man (...) conce^ve but those yt
saw her, After y^ she spewed Horse-dung, (...) pins, hair, feathers, knots of
thread, pieces of broken glasses, (...) from (...) k^ife (...) then a spa^ y^
^hels of E^gs (...). In the mean time her parents, sisters and neighbors* did
observe y^ if at any ti^e (...) witch ca^^ (...) to the house* or but looke^
(...) it y^ poor maid was Tormented more then before, nor could be (...) from
her* fits* or gi^e any sign of life ^ill ^he was go^^ further off. The witch
was therefore apprehended* who confess^ng this and many other* Witch ^^a^ts,
was deservedly Hanged*

The reverend man who did go alongwith her to the place of Execution, did
desire her (as the hangman was fiting the halter to her neck) in this her last
agony, and moment on which Eter^ity does depend to un-bewitch the Maid, she
ma^e answer to the holy Father y^ ^he could not do it in regard y^ four times
(which we call days) had interveen'd since ^he had swallowed down the
Witchcraft, morover she affirmed yt if she could do it The young Maid would not
so easily recover, for she named two other witches who had practiced upon her
their deadly Arts, and if ever she escaped, she said it would ask a long time.

Her Father and her Mother therefore despa^ring of her Recovery, did bring
their daughter unto my house about the middle of September* whom I entertaine^
for some weeks: what things I then saw, and heard and touched because I know
that many who differ in Religion from me will hardly believe. So God shall save
me. I will give you here a perfect account of* and of no more ^hen what I saw.

The day after y^ she came unto m^ house, I sent to ^uick for the Reli^ious man
who is yet alive. Before he came near unto the Threshol^ by fifty paces, the
Maid fell down I did believe she had been dead f^r there was not the least sign
of breath to testify she was: living, The fingers of her hands, and her toes
(I should hardly have ^eleeved it, if I ha^ not seen and touched them) were by
a strange convulsion so contracted that the third joint was so sunk down and
knotted to y^ second, which could never come to pass by nature, that you would
h^v^ thought they h^d been both but one joint. I attempted but in vain, to
i^terpose a golden Bo^kin which I h^d, the like I made trial of with a nail,
and at last with a hot Iron but could not pre^ai^e. The mother (who was so
indulgent to her that she was a hardly ever from her) tol^ me that the holy man
sent for to Lu^ck was not far off, And in^ee^ so it was, for she scarce had
spoke the wor^ but he knocke^ at the door, and being come into the c^^m^er, he
no sooner pronounced the first words out of ^he Gospel when y^ poor maid who
lay before more senclesse then a carkase was so veh^men^ly shaken al her bo^^
over (the joints of her finger^ and her toes being still t^ed in a knot) that
six of us were not able to hold her I who endeavored with all the strength I
h^d to hold her head* did perceive both with my eyes and hands y^ do what I
could she by a formid^b^e convulsion did turn both head and neck toward her
shoulders* In the mean time the lower part of her belly being swelled high and
into a great bulk, did seem more nearer her throat then her groyn, and her guts
made so great a noise that plainly they might be heard of all being ten paces
from her. This sounding of her Bowels was much like unto the sound of the
waters which the wind does make under the stern of a ship when the tide and the
tempest do begin to scold she did vomit forth all this while some of those
things which I have already mentioned: I took compassion on the innocent Maid
and besought the Divine that he he would forbear to read any more. He was no
sooner silent but in that instant she lay most quiet and when he was gone out
of the house the young Maid rose up opening her eyes* and her fingers and toes
being reduced to their first natural posture she did weep a little, and did
chide her Mother that she had sent for the divine, although she protested that
she neither saw him nor heard any word he spoke. Immediately afterward as if
she had suffered nothing at all, she played with her companions* and did eat
and drink with them until the reverend man returning to his office, she
returned to her torments as before. I did then behold her to vomit many
feathers and w^^ds of straw, thicker then my thumb with pinns stuck a cross in
them and po^nts made of thre^ of several colors. I did b^hold her also at yt
same time to vomit four rows of p^ns stuck in a blew paper whole and fresh, as
if they had bin newly bought at the H^^erda^hers-shop.

Finally the poor M^id affirmed that she did vomit forth all those things which
she saw in the W^tches basket when she begged of her, which being contrary to
all Philosophy must certainly proceed from the Devil. Else it was impossible
that so long and sharp a knife as that which she vom^ted should not cut her
bowels and her throat: I therefore affirmed that there was some mist cast on
our eyes, and that which this young M^id seemed to vomit did only fall from her
lips into my hands by the illusion of the Devil: but the young maid being then
with us and of an app^ehension above her age, di^ interpose, and doubt not
(says she but these things do proceed out of my own body, and taking me by
the hand she did put it into her mouth, and sa^d you may feel a pin coming up
without a head: I did feel it. and thinking I had taken fast hold of it in her
throat I did perceive that it was suddenly plucked down into her body by force
from me, as some taggs of her points were heretofore by others. ^ut seeing her
prone to vomit I put my right hand into her mouth and with my fingers in her
throat I did take out a needle with thread, points and straw an^ other things.
Which I still preserve to satisfy the curious. Being sent afterward to
several places but to no effect, she was returned to me again in a sad
condition, not only loathing wine and beer, but bread and all manner of meat;
for forty days together she lived only on Grapes Almonds, Apples, and the
cold fruits of Autumn; neither did the rose fall from her cheek, nor the Lilly
wither from her brow.

At the last for f^steene days together she would take no sustenance at all,
how she could live so long without any food I must confess I cannot tell, but
that she did do it, both I and my servants are ready to take the greate^^ and
most obliging Oath that can be propounded to us

On the sixteenth day she of her own accord did call for drink, and ^o longer
did refuse her weat. Not long afterward, I prepared her a deco^tion of
Mugwort^ St John's Southernwood, Vervin, Maiden-haire, Rorida, and other
Ingredients which are behind to have a virtue to dispell the power of
witchcraft, and having for certain days u^'d her bo^y to this drink, I did
send her h^me. In the mean time turning over all Books of physic y^ were
written on this subject, I did light upon the Secrets of Charichter^s, who
prescribes a remedy for this Inch^ntment, which when I found to be highly
commended by ^chlandius y^ Physician of Wormtz, I did write to him, and to some
Ap^thecaryes in Franckford in whose shops he said it was to be sold, being
resolved to give any money for it, But when I found y^ they were loath to part
with s^ great a secret and being studious night an^ day to do the young maid
good, I took Cha^ichtorus into my hand again* and having at the last understood
him, for the Print^r by a great fau^t had made Hol^zbletterbe^r but one wo^d,
which should be ^ words in the German Tongue, I made the Ointment at last my
self* and I will describe unto you th^^ way to make it.

Take of the fat of a young Dog wel^ melted and cleansed 4 ounc^s, Of the fat
of a (...) Eight ounces of the fat of a Capon 24. ounces. Three stemms of the
green and cor^ell Tree, Tree y^ has the gum on it, Cut y^ pieces small and
beat them till they grow moist, beat the wood, leaves and berries together,
Then take all and put them into a pot, which having set in y^ sun 9 weeks; you
shall extract from thence a green balsom, with which anoint y^ Joints and those
places of y^ bewitched which do most pain them and by a sure experiment you
shall cure them, as appears by this Maid, who eversince has bin perfectly
recovered.

This we have thought fit to put into English, and who will refuse to read it?
And because this young Maid had more violent fits then those in Yorkshire, it
may please God that using the same remedy they and all others who are bewitched
in the same manner may find the same recovery which is the happy end that in
this paper we do aim at.

The End.
