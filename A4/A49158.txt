A Lookinglass for the WHIGS: OR, Down with Common-Wealths-Men.
A Country Fellow took a Daw,
A Pillaging his Wheat,
And, though 'twas Hanging by the Law,
Tied only one of's Feet;
Then gave him to a little Child,
Who with a deal of Joy
Made much of him, and laughed and smiled
At such a pleasing Toy:
But yet the Bird was mighty dull
To think he was confined,
And, though he had his Belly full,
Was not content in Mind;
Wherefore he from his Keeper slipped,
And, longing to be free,
To an adjacent Thicket skip'd,
And kaw'd out Liberty.
When 'twas not long before the String
He had upon his Foot
Entangl'd him, and made him sing
Another kind of Note;
And, ready to give up the Ghost,
For want of usual Food,
He owned that he himself had lost,
Not knowing what was good:
Fool as I am, I was preserved
While kept from being Free,
He cried, but now, alas I am starved,
And with my Life have purchased Liberty.
The MORAL
DOwn, down with Kings, our Common-Wealth's-Men cry,
The Name's infectious grown,
Nor let the Rays of Liberty
Be darkened by the Throne.
When, should the Powers they pray to grant
The Mischeifs they implore,
The Nation would experience the Want,
And starve, that pinched before.
