6. Fa^ewell. The twentieth of June.

Fam. 14.19.
8. M. T. Cicero to Terentia, etc.
1. THe sickness of our Tullia does much trouble me, amid my very great
sorrows; concerning whom, there is no cause why I should write more unto you,
for I am sure you have as great a care of her as I have.

2. Whereas you desire I should come nearer hand* I see it is fitting I should
do so; and I had done so already, but many things have hindered me, which are
not as yet dispatched.

3. But I expect a Letter from Pomponius, which I pray you take care it may be
conveyed to me with all speed.

4. Endeavor to keep your health.

Fam. 14.12.
9. M. T. Cicero to Terentia, etc.
1. FOrasmuch as you rejoice that we are come safe into Italy, I wish you may
always rejoice.

2. But I fear, lest, through the grief of a troubled mind, and great wrongs
done us, we have taken such a course, as we cannot well dispatch.

3. Wherefore, aid us what you can.

4. But what you are able to do, I do not conceive.

5. There is no cause for you to undertake a journey at this season; the way is
both long and dangerous.

6. Besides, I do not see what good you can do me if you do come.

7. Farewell, Dated the fourth of November at Brundusium.

Fam. 14 11.
10. M. T. Cicero to Terentia, etc.
1. IF you be in good health, it is well; I a^ in good health.

2. Our Tullia came to me the twelfth of June, in respect of whose very great
virtue, and singular humanity, I am also the more grieved, that it should be
long of my negligence, that she is in a far other-gates condition, than her
piety and worth did deserve.

3. I was in mind to send Cicero to Caesar, and Cneius Salustius with him.

4. If he shall make a journey, I will give you notice.

5. Look diligently to your health.

6. Farewell. June 15.

Fam. l. 16. Epist. 2.
11. M. T. C. to Tyro, etc.
1. WE have been held now seven days at Corcyra; and my brother Q^intus and his
son at Buthrotum.

2 We were very solicitous about your health; nor did we wonder that we
received no Letters from you; for men sail from thence where you are with those
winds, which if they had served, we would not have waited at Co^cyra.

3. Look therefore to your self, and get strength, and when conveniently, both
for your health, and the season of the year, you can sail, come to us that love
you very well.

4. No man loves us, but he likes you.

5. You shall come welcome to all, and looked-for.

6. My Tyro, have an especial care of your health.

7. Farewell. The 18th. of October. From Corcyra.

Fam. 16. Epist. 4.
12. M. T. Cicero to Tyro, etc.
I neither can, nor have I any mind to write with what passion I am troubled: I
only write, that it will be very great content both to you and me, if I may
see you recovered as soon as may be.

2. We came, the third day (after we departed) from you, to Alyzia.

3. That place is some fourteen miles on this side Leucas.

4. I thought I should find either you, or your Letter by Mario, at Leucas.

5. As you love me, or know that I love you, so look to your health.

6. From Alyzia, Nov. 5.

Fam. 16.25.
13. Cicero the son to Tyro, etc.
1. ALthough you have used a just and fit excuse of the forbearance of your
Letters, yet I entreat that you would not often do it.

2. For though I be certified by reports and messengers concerning the
Commonwealth; and my father writes continually to me concerning his good will
toward me; yet a Letter written from you to me upon any the least occasion,
has always been very welcome.

3. Wherefore seeing I desire your Letters above all things, do not deal so, as
to satisfy for the omission of your duty in writing rather by an excuse than
by continual sending of Letters. Farewell.

Fam. 13.25.
14. M. T. Cicero to Servius Sulpitius, etc.
1. HAgesaretus Larissaeus having received great favors from me in my
Consulship, has been mindful and thankful, and has ever since honored me
with all respect.

2. I heartily commend him to you, as both one that has entertained me and my
familiar friend, and a thankful person, and a good man, and a chief man of his
City, and most worthy of your acquaintance.

3. You will do me an especial favor, if you endeavor that he may conceive,
that this my recommendation has had great power with you. Farewell.

Fam. 17.18.
15. M. T. C. to Trebatius, etc.
1. I Cut in pieces your harmless Letter which I received of Lucius Aruntius;
for it had nothing in it which might not well be read in an open Assembly.

2. But both Aruntius said, that you had given charge so, and you had writ to
that purpose underneath.

3. But let that pass, I wonder that you writ nothing to me since, especially
there being so much news stirring. Farewell.

Fam. 13.6.
16. M. T. Cicero, to Quintus Valerius the son of Quintus Orca, etc.
1. PUblius Cornelius, who delivered you this Letter, is recomme^ded to me by
Publius Cuspius; for whose sake, you may indeed easily gather from me, how much
I desire and am bound (to give satisfaction.)

2. I ear^^si^^ request you, that Cuspius may give me very great thanks, out of
hand, and as often as can be possible. Farewell.

Fam 13.3.
17. M. T. C. to Caius Memmius, etc.
1. I Would have you so entertain Aulus Fusius, one of my intimate friends,
very observant and affectionate toward me, and a learned man, and full of
courtesy, and very worthy of your friendship; as you promised me when we were
together.

2. It will be as pleasing to me, as any thing in the world can be.

3. Besides, you shall engage him to you for ever, to be your most especial
servant, and most especially observant of you. Farewell.

Fam. 12.27.
18. M. T. Cicero, to Cornificius, etc.
1. SExtus Aufidius both comes near to my own kindred, in the respect which he
bears toward me; and he comes behind no Roman Gentleman in gallantry.

2. And he is of such temperate and moderate behavior, that singular gravitie
(seems to) be coupled with courteousnesse.

3. Whose businesses, which are in Asia, I so recommend to you, that I cannot
recommend them with more earnestness, or more heartily.

You shall do me a great favor, if you do your endea^ that he may conceive
this Letter of mi^^ has prevaile^ (...) much with you.

5. And this, my Cornificius, I most earnestly request of you. Farewell.

Fam. 6.16.
19. Cicero to Basilius, etc.
1. I Congratulate with you, I rejoice with my self; I love you, I protect your
affairs.

2. I desire to be beloved by you, and to be certified what you do, and what is
done in those parts.

Fam. 11.4.
20. Decimus Brutus Imperator, to M. T. Cicero.
IF I made any doubt of your good will toward me, I would entreat you more at
large, that you would defend me in my honor; but doubtless it is so as I
persuaded my self, that you are careful of me.

2 I went on to them beyond the Alps with an Army, not so much catching at the
name of Imperator, as desiring to satisfy my soldiers, and to make them firm
to defend our cause; which methinks I have obtained, for they have had trial
of my liberality and affection.

3. I have encountered with the most warlick people of all, I have taken many
Castles, I have dismantled many.

4. I sent a Letter to the Senate for a good reason.

5. Aid me with your opinion, which if you shall do, you shall almost-wholly do
service to the Commonwealth. Farewell.

Fam. 13.20.
21. M. T. Cicero, to Servius Sulpitius, etc.
1. I Am very well acquainted with Asclapo, a Physician of Patrae; and both his
Conversation was delightful to me, and also his Art, which I have had trial
of in my friends sickness, wherein he gave me content, both for his judgment,
and likewise for his fidelity and his good will.

2. I therefore recommend him to you, and request you, that you would
endeavor, that he may conceive, that I have written very diligently concerning
him, and that my commendations has been a great furtherance to him.

3. It will be a very great favor to me. Farewell.

Fam. 10.9.
22. M. T. Cicero to Appius, etc.
1. I Suppose you are informed touching my care for your welfare and safe^y, by
the Letters of your friends, whom I am sure I have abundantly satisfied;
neither will I come behind them, though they bear you singular good will, that
they should wish your welfare more than I.

2. They must needs yield to me in this, that I am able to do you more good at
this time than they; which certainly I have not failed to pe^form, nor will I
fail; and I have already do (...) an important matter, and have laid the
foundations of your safety.

3. See that you be of a good and stout spirit, and be confident I will not
fail you in any thing.

4. The sixth of July. Farewell.

Fam. 7.4.
22. M. T. Cicero to M^^ius, S. P. D.
1. THe 24th of June I came into Cumanum, with your Libo, or o^rs rather; I the
to go forthwith to Pompeianum; but I will let you know before.

2. I desire, both that you may always enjoy your health, and surely, while we
are here.

4. Wherefore if you be resolved to apply any thing to the Gout, see you put it
off till another day.

5. Be careful th^n of your h^^lth, and look for me within this two or three
days. Farewell.

Fam. 10.14.
24. Cic^^o to Pl^ I^pe^ator, Con^ul elect and.
1. O The grateful report two d^ys (...) V^ctory, concerning thy succor, and
(...) the forces, and also the enemies routed! All (...).

2. For, the most noted Commanders (...) ^rs are said to have fled from the
Battl^ of Matina.

3. And it is ^o less^ pleasing to destroy the remainder, than to discomfit the
first.

4 I indeed expected your Letter ere this, ^n^ that with many others.

5. And I hoped that Lepidus being admonished by the Times, would give content
to you and the Commonwealth.

6. Endeavor therefore, my Plancus, that no spark of that mischievous war may
be left.

7. Which if it be do^, you shall both do an extraordinary great benefit to the
Common wealth, and gain everlasting renown to your self.

8 The thirteenth of May. Farewell.

Fam. 9 23.
25. M. T. Cicero to Papirius Praetus, etc.
1. YEsterday I came to Cumanum, to morrow perhaps I will come to you.

2. But when I shall know the certainty, I will acquaint you a little before.

3. Although Marcus Ceparius, when he met me in the Poultry-wood, and I asked
him how you did, said, That you kept your bed, because that you were troubled
with the Gout. I was truly sorry at it, as I might well: Yet I resolved to come
to you, that I might both see you, and give you a visit, and likewise sap with
you.

4. For I do not think you have a Cook with the gout in his fingers.

5. Therefore expect a guest that is both a man that is no great eater, and one
that cannot abide costly suppers. Farewell.

Fam. 4.15
26. M. Cicero to Cneius Plancius, etc.
1. I Received a very short Letter of yours, whereby I could not understand
that which I desired to know; but I understood that which I made no doubt of.

2 For I did not understand how gallantly you bare the common miseries; but I
plainly perceived how much you loved me: but this I knew; if I had known the
other, I should have framed my Letter to it.

3. Yet for all that, although I have writ to you before, what I thought
fitting to be written, yet I thought good to admonish you in short at this
time, that you would not think your self to be in any peculiar danger; we are
all in a great, but yet in a common dysaster.

4* Wherefore you ought not to desire a private fortune, or the best, or refuse
that which is common.

5. Let us therefore be of that mind one toward another, which we ever were.

6. Which I can hope for on your behalf, and can warrant on my part.

Fam. 9.12.
27. Cicero to Dolabella, etc.
1. I Congratulate our Baiae, seeing, as you write, they are become wholesome on
a sudden: unless perhaps they are enamored of you, and flatter you, and
forget themselves, as long as you are there.

2. Which if it be so, I do not wonder that even the air and the earth forgo
their natural disposition, if it be for your commodity.

3. I had the short Oration in the defense of Deiotarus, which you desired, by
m^; which I did not think.

4. I have therefore sent it to you, which I would have you look upon, as a
mean subject, and incapable of ornament, and not much worth the writing. But I
would send my old host and friend a small gift, as it were a piece of
Linseywolsey, of a course thread, such as his Presents use to be.

5. I would have you to be wise and valiant, that your moderation and gravity
may bring dishonor upon others that offer you wrong. Farewell.

Fam. 2.14.
28. M. T. Cicero to Caelius Imperator, an head-officer of State, etc.
1. THere is great familiarity betwixt me and Marcus Fabius, a very good man
and a great scholar; and I love him exceedingly, both for his great wit, and
extraordinary learning, and for his singular modesty.

2. I would have you undertake his business so, as if it were my own matter.

3. I know ye are great Counselors.

4 He must kill a man, that will be your Client; but I admit of no excuse about
this man.

5 You shall say aside all other business, if you love me, when Fabius shall
desire to use your help.

6 I earnestly expect and desire to know how things go at Rome, and above the
rest I would understand how you dispose of your self.

7. For now no news has been brought us of a long time, by reason of the
hardness of the winter. Farewell.

Fam. 7.22.
29. Cicero to Trebatius, etc.
1. YO^ played upon me yesternight amongst our cups, because I said it was a
doubtful case, Whether an heir might lawfully accuse one of theft, which theft
had been committed before.

2. Therefore although I returned home full of drink, and late at night:: yet,
I noted the Chapter where this Case is, and have sent it to you written out,
that you may know that Sextus Aelius, Ma^^^s Manlius, and Marcus Brutus are of
that opinion, of which you said no body was.

3. Yet I agree to Scaevola and Testa's opinion. Farewell.

Fam. 11.15.
30. M. T. Cicero to Decimus Brutus Imperator, etc.
1. ALthough your Letters gave me very great contentment, yet it pleased me
more, that in the throng of business, you commanded Plancus your colleague,
that he should excuse you to me by his Letter, which he has performed
diligently; and there is nothing likes me better, than your courtesy and
diligence.

2. Your union with your Colleague, and your concord which was intimated by both
your Letters, was most acceptable to the Senate and people of Rome.

3. For the rest, go on, my Brutus; and now do not strive with others, but with
your self.

4. I must write no more, especially to you, whom I think to imitate in brevity.

5. I earnestly expect your Letters, and indeed such, as I heartily wish for.
Farewell.

Fam. 6.9.
31. M. Cicero to Titus Furfanus Praetor, etc.
1. THere was ever so great familiarity and acquaintance betwixt me and Aulus
Cecinna, that none could possibly be greater: for I was both well acquainted
with his father, a worthy man, and a brave gentleman; and I so loved him ever
from a child, (because he gave me great hope of his singular honesty and
eloquence, and lived very familiarly with me, not only in all friendly
offices, but also in like studies) that I liked to live with no man more than
with him.

2. It is to no purpose for me to write more: You see how needful it is for
me, to preserve his welfare and fortunes, by all the means I am able.

3. It remains, that, forasmuch as I understand many ways, what you think of
the condition of good men, and the calamities of the Commonwealth, I require
nothing of you, but that such an addition may be made to that good will, which
of your own accord you bare to Cecinna, by my commendation, according as I
conceive you respect me.

4 You cannot do me a greater pleasure than this. Farewell.

Fam. 12.20
32. M. Cicero to Cornificius his Colleague, etc.
1. YOur Letters pleased me well, but that you disdained the little inn at
Sinuessa; which contempt the poor little village will take very unkindly,
except you make amends for all in Cumanum and Pompeianum.

2. Therefore you shall do so, and let me have your love, and egg me on by
some Letter.

3. For I can more easily answer, than provoke another.

4. But if you shall be negligent, as you are, I will urge you, lest your
lithernesse breed sloth.

5. I will write more when I have more leisure.

6. I scribled these, when I was in the Senate. Farewell.

Fam. 12.81.
33. M. T. Cicero to Cornificius, S. P. D.
1. Caius Anitius a familiar friend of mine, a man well-accomplished in all
things, comes with a titular Embassage into Africa, about his own occasions; I
would have you further him in all things, and assist him that he may dispatch
his business with all convenience.

2. And especially, I recommend his honor unto you, a thing which is very dear
to him.

3. And I request you, which I used to do my self in my own Province without
entreatie, to allow Lictors to all Senators; which very thing I had heard and
known to be usually done by eminent persons.

4. Therefore, my Cornificius, do this, and upon all occasions (if you love me)
consult for his honor and business.

5. You cannot do me a greater pleasure.

6. Be careful of your health.

Fam. 12.9.
34. M. T. Cicero to Cassius, etc.
1. THe shortness of your Letters makes me also more brief in writing; and
(that I may say the truth) I do not well know what to write.

2. For I am sure, that our proceedings are brought to you in the Diurnalls,
but we know nothing of yours.

3. For as if Asia were stopped, no news is brought to us, only rumors of
Dolabella being vanquished; which are indeed very constant, but as yet without
any Author.

4. When we thought the war had been done and ended, your friend Lepidus put us
in a great deal of fear.

5. Therefore assure your self, that the greatest hope that the Commonwealth
has is in you and your forces.

6. We have the Armies very constant to us; nevertheless though all things
fall out happily, (as I hope they will) it imports you to come.

7. For the Commonwealth has but little hope, I am loath to say none at all:
but what ever it is, it is failing in the year of your Consulship. Farewell.

Fam. 13 30.
35. M. T. Cicero to Atilius, etc.
Lucius Manlius is of Sosa, he was sometimes of Catina; but he is now become a
Citizen of Rome together with the other Neapolitans, and he is made an Alderman
at Naples.

2. For he was made free of that Corporation before the freedom of that City
was granted to the Confederates, and the Latins.

3. His brother is lately dead at Catina, I suppose he will have no
controversy at all about the Inheritance, and he is already possessed of the
estate.

4 But forasmuch as he has old businesses besides in his country of Sicily, I
recommend unto you both his brother's inheritance, and all his affairs; and
above all I commend him to you as a very honest man, and familiar friend of
mine, and one that is furnished with those studies of learning and Philosophy,
which I am most taken withal.

5. I request you therefore, that, whether he come or not come into Cicilie,
you would take notice, that he is one of my intimate and nearest friends; and
that you would so entertain him, that he may perceive, my commendation has
stood him in great stead. Farewell.

Fam. 16.1.
36. Tully and Cicero and Quintus, to the most courteous and honest Quintus
Tyro, etc.
1. SEe what pleasantness is in you; we have been two hours at Thyreum: our
host Xenomanes loves you, as if he had lived with you.

2. He has promised to provide you all necessaries, and I think he will do it.

3. I liked it well, if you were better, that you should remove to Leucas, if
there you might wholly recover your self.

4. See how Curious, Lyso, and the Physician, like of it.

5. I had thought to send Mario back again to you, whom you might send to me,
when you were somewhat better; but I considered, that Mario could bring but one
Letter, and I expected many.

6. You may therefore procure, (and you will do it, if you love me) that
Acastus may be every day about the haven.

7. There will be many by whom you may readily send Letters, that will be
willing to bring them to me.

8. I indeed will not omit any body that goes to Patrae.

9. I am very confident of Curious, that he will be diligent in looking to you:
he is very kind and loving to us; refer your self wholly to him; I had rather
see you well a little after, than presently sickly.

10. Therefore mind nothing else but to recover your health; I will look to
other things.

11. Farewell again and again.

12. As I went from Leucas the seventh of November.

Fam. 16.7.
37. M. Cicero the father and the son, to Tyro, etc.
1. I Have written to you this third Epistle on the same day, rather to hold my
resolution, than that I have any thing to write.

2. Therefore, according to the love you bear me, be diligent in that matter.

3. Add this to your very many courtesies, which will please me the best of
all; seeing, as I hope, you have a care of your health, have a care also of
your sailing.

4. Send Letters to me by them that go into Italy, as I om^t no body that goes
to Patrae.

5. Have a care, have a care of your self, my Tyro; and seeing it has fallen
out, that you could not sail with us, there is no cause why you should make
haste; neither should you mind any thing, but that you may recover your health.

6. Farewell again and again.

7. From Actium, the seventh of November, in the evening.

Fam. 16.12.
38. M. T. Cicero to Tyro, S. P. D.
1. TRuly I have a desire you should come to me, but I am afraid of the way;
you have been very sore sick, and are wasted away, what with fasting, and
purging, and the strength of the disease.

2. Great hurts use to come of great diseases, if any disorder be committed.

3. Now to that two days, that you will be upon the way, whilst you come to
Cumanum, there will be five days added for your return forthwith.

4. I will be in Formianum until the latter end of the month

5. Let me find you there, my Tyro, lusty.

6. My studies (or ours rather) have languished for want of you; yet by this
Letter which Acastus brought, they have lifted up their eyes a little.

7. Pompeius was with me when I writ these things, I told him merrily and
freely, when he desired to hear of our affairs, that all mine were mute without
you.

8. Do you prepare to make amends to my Muses for your diligence omitted, ours
shall be done at the day appointed; for I have taught you the Etymology of
Fides.

9. See that you be thoroughly well; we are ready present.

10. Farewell. The fourteenth of the Calends of January.

Fam. 2.4.
39. M. T. Cicero to Curio, etc.
1. YOu know very well there are many sorts of Epistles, but that one is the
most notable, for whose sake the thing it self was invented; that we should
certify them that are absent, if there should be any matter, which it may
concern us or them, that they should know it.

2. Surely you do not expect such Letters as these from me, for you have those
that write and bring you news of your private affairs, and in mine there is no
new thing at all.

3. There are yet two sorts of Epistles, which please me; the one familiar and
conceited, the other familiar and grave.

4. I know not, whether of these I should less make use of.

5. Should I quibble with you by Letters? Truly I do not think he is a Citizen,
that can laugh in these times.

6. Should I write any thing grave? What is it that Cicero can write gravely to
Curio, except it be concerning the Commonwealth?

7. And in this ^^nd my case is such, that I am loath to write what I think.

8. Wherefore, because I have no other subject lest whereon to write, I will
close as I am wont, and encourage you to p^oceed to the height of glory.

9. For you have a great adversary set and provided, a marvailous expectation;
which you shall very easily overcome by one thing, If you resolve to employ
your self in those matters, the glory of whose praise you admire, by such means
as those praises are obtained.

10. I would write more to this purpose, but that I believe you are
sufficiently incited on, of your own accord; and this whatever it is that I
have touched, I have not done it to inflame you, but to testify my love.
Farewell.

40. M. T. Cicero to Brutus, etc.
1. I Make use of Lucius Titius Strabo, a very noble and gallant Roman Knight,
as my bosom friend: we observe all Laws of strict acquaintance betwixt us.

2. Publius Cornelius owes him money in your Province.

3. That matter is remitted into Gallia by Volcatius, a Judge in Rome.

4. I desire you more earnestly than if it were my own case, (because it is
more honest for one to stir about a friend's money than his own) that you would
take order to dispatch the business, that you would undertake it, and put an
end to it; and that you would endeavor (so far as you think it just and
reasonable) that Strabo's freeman, who is sent about that matter, may finish
his business upon very good terms, and come by his money.

5. This will both give me very great content, and you your self shall
acknowledge L. Titius to be worthy your friendship.

6. Wherein I heartily desire that you would have a care, a^ you are wont to do
in all things which you know I desire Farewell.

Fam. 5 8.
41. M. T. Cicero to Titus Fabius.
1. ALthough I, who desire to comfort you, stand in need to b^ comforted my
self, because I have a long time taken nothing so much to heart as your loss;
yet I do not only earnestly exhort you, but for our love's sake I request and
entreat you, that you would recollect your self, and play the man, and consider
in what condition all men, and what times we are born in.

2. Your own worth has given you more, than fortune has taken from you:
because you have obtained that, which few upstart men have gotten; and have
lost that, which many great nobles have lost.

3. Besides, such a condition of the Laws, of judgments, and times, seems to
approach, that he may seem to be best dealt withal, that is departed from this
Commonwealth with the leightest punishment.

4. B^t you, that have means and children, and us with others linked with you
in the nearest tie of acquaintance and love, and who are like to have a great
liberty to live with us, and all your friends; and seeing there is but one
judgment of so many, which may be blamed, as that which by one sentence, and
that a doubtful one, may be thought to be yielded to the power of some one
man: For all these reasons, you ought to bear that trouble very leightly.

5. My affection shall always be such as you desire, and as it ought to be
toward you and your children. Farewell.

Fam. 6 11.
42. M. T. Cicero to Trebatius, etc.
1. HEretofore I only loved Dolabella, and was nothing beholden to him,
neither had it happened that I had need; and he was engaged to me, because I
failed not him in his perils.

2. Now I am obliged to him by his so great courtesy, in that he has given me
abundant satisfaction, both heretofore concerning your estate, and at this time
concerning your safety, that I am more tied to no man.

3. Wherein I rejoice with you so much, that I had rather have you be joyful
with me, than give him thanks.

4. I do not at all desire the one, and you may do the other.

5. As for that which is behind, seeing your virtue and worth has opened you a
way to return to your friends; it will be a point of your wisdom and
gallant-mindednesse, to forget what you have lost, and to consider what you
have recovered.

6. You shall live with your friends, you shall live with us: you have gained
more honor, than you have lost in estate, which would then have been more
pleasing to you, if there were any Commonwealth.

7. Our friend Vestorius writ to me, that you give me great thanks.

8. This divulging of yours pleases me very well, and I am willing you should
use it both with others, and especially with our friend Syro.

9. For what we do, we desire may be very well liked on by every wise man.

10. I desire to see you, as soon as may be. Farewell.

Fam. 7.14.
43. Cicero to Trebatius, etc.
1. CHrysippus Vectius, freeman to Cyrus the Architect, made me think that you
had not forgotten me; for he brought me commendations from you.

2. You are now become very nice, who think much to write unto me, being
especially a friend almost as familiar as one of your own house.

3. But if you have forgotten to write, not many will be overthrown in their
suits, if you be their Counselor.

4. And if you have forgotten us, I will endeavor to come thither, before I be
razed quite out of your mind.

5. If the fear of Summer-quarters discourage you, invent some excuse, as you
did about Britannia.

6. I was very glad to hear by the same Chrysippus, that you a^e familiar with
Caesar; but indeed it would like me better, a thing which was more reasonable,
to understand as often as may be your own proceedings by your own Letter, which
certainly would be so, if you would choose rather to learn the Laws of Amity
than of Pleading.

7. But I have jested thus far, both after your wont, and something after my
own.

8. I love you very dearly; and both desire, and am confident, that you love
me. Farewell.

Fam. 10 27.
44. M. T. Cicero to Marcus Lepidus, etc.
1. FOrasmuch as I have a great desire, according to the infinite love I bear
you, that you should arise to some high degree of honor; I took it ill, that
you did not thank the Senate, seeing you were preferred to eminent honors by
that Order.

2. I am glad that you are desirous to make peace among the Citizens.

3. If you quit that peace from servitude, you shall do for the good of the
Commo^-wealth, and your own honor: but if that peace be like to re-establish
that forlorn fellow in the possession of his unbridled Dominion, know, that all
honest men are of this mind, to prefer death before servitude.

4. And therefore, in my judgment, you shall do wiselier, if you do not
interpose your self in this Pacification, which is neither liked on by the
Senate, nor the people, nor any good man.

5. But of these matters you shall hear by others, or be certified by Letters.

6. You, according to your discretion, will consider what is best to be done.
Farewell.

Fam. 10.2.
45. M. Cicero to Cneius Plancus Imperator, Consul elect, etc.
1. MY endeavor had not been wanting to your honor, in respect of our
acquaintance, if I could have either soon, or safely, come into the Senate.

2. But no man that has a free thought of the Commonwealth, can, without
danger, converse in this great licentiousness of swordmen; nor does it seem to
consist with my honor there to deliver my opinion touching the Commonwealth,
where men in Arms shall hear me better and nearer hand, than Senators.

3. Wherefore in private matters, you shall neither want any office or service
that I can do you; nor will I be wanting to your honor in public occasions, no
though it be to my peril, if there be any thing whereat I must needs be
present.

4. But in these things, which may nevertheless be done, though I be absent, I
desire you, that you would let me have a respect both of my own safety and
honor. Farewell.

Fam. 9.19.
46. M. T. Cicero to Papirius Paetus, etc.
1. ANd yet you forsake not your malice; you hint, that Balbus was contented
with a very little provision.

2. This you seem to infer, Seeing kings are so sparing, men that have been
Consuls ought to be much more.

3. You know not that I have fished all things out of him; for you know not
that he came straight from the gate to my house: neither do I wonder at this,
that he came not rather to yours; but that, that he came not to his own house.

4. And I asked him in the three first words, How does our Paetus? and he swear
to me, that he never was more willingly in any place.

5. If you have done this with words, I will bring you ears as dainty as his;
but if with good cheer, let me entreat you, not to think the Balbi are more to
be regarded than the eloquent.

6. One thing after another hinders me every day.

7. But if I can acquit my self so as I may come into those parts, I will make,
that you may not think that you were too late advertised by me. Farewell.

Fam. 12.16.
47. Caius Tribonius to Cicero, etc.
1. IF you be in health, it is well.

2. I came to Athens the 22 of May, and there (a thing which I very much
desired) I saw your son addicted to the noblest studies, and in great repute
for his modesty.

3. In which thing what pleasure I took, you may understand, though I say
nothing.

4. For you know very well, how much I value you, and how, in regard of our
ancient and real love, I rejoice at all, even your least, prosperities, and
not only at this so great a good.

5. Do not thi^^, my Cicero, that I speak this to flatter you.

6. There is no^ more beloved than your young son, and therefore mine, (for
there can nothing be mine but it is yours) by all them that are at Athe^s, nor
more studious of those arts, which you most love, that is, of the best.

7. So that I willingly congratulate with you, (because I can truly do, it) and
also with my self, that we find him, whom we must of necessity love, to be such
as we may willingly also love him.

8. Who, when he had cast out a word to me, that he had a desire to see Asia,
he was not only invited, but also entreated by me, that he would do it,
especially whilst I was governor there.

9. Whom you need not doubt, but we will use him with as much dearnesse and
affection, as you would do your self.

10. And I will take order, that Cratippus may be with him, that you may not
think he shall be like to lose time in Asia, from those studies, which you
exhort him to.

11. For I do not cease to exhort him, being, as I see, well-disposed, and far
entered, to go forward every day further, by learning and exercising himself.

12. I knew not what ye did in the Commonwealth, when I wrote these Letters.

13. I heard some turbulent reports, which I desire may be false, that I once
may enjoy quiet liberty, which thing I never yet obtained in the least.

14. Yet having gotten a little leisure in my Navigation, I have prepared you a
small present according to my wonted manner, and have added in the end a Saying
which you spoke in much honor of me, and underwritten it beneath for you.

15. In which verses, if I seem more free than one ought to speak in some
words, the baseness of that person against whom I inveigh too freely, will
excuse me.

16. Pardon also my choler, which is but just against such men and Citizens.

17. Besides, why shall it be more lawful for Lucilius to assume this liberty
to himself, than for us? considering, that although he bare them like hatred,
whom he nipped; yet verily he had none more worthy, against whom he might rail
with such liberty of words.

18. You, as you have promised me, will presently bring me in your Dialogues.

19. For I make no question, but if you write any thing of the death of Caesar,
you will afford me no small part both of the matter, and your love.

20. Farewell, and let me commend my mother and all mine unto you. From Athens,
May 25.

48. Cicero to Curious, etc.
1. BY your letters I plainly perceive two things, (which I always desired)
that you both love me very well; and that you conceive, how much I love you.

2. Which seeing we have both of us obtained, it remains, that we strive one
with another in good-turns, with which I may contentedly outstrip you, or be
out-stripped by you.

3. I am well-pleased, that it was not needful for my Letter to be delivered
to Ancilius.

4. I perceive by your Letter, that you had no great need of Sulpitius's help,
because your matter^s are so shuffled together, that, as you write, they have
neither head nor feet: truly, I wish they had feet, that you might once return.

5. For you see, that old witty-jesting is already decayed, as our friend
Pomponius might be bold to say, except we few do retain the ancient Attick
glory; he then comes very near you, and I to him.

6. Come therefore, that such a seed of urbanity may not be extinguished
together with the Commonwealth. Farewell.

49. M. T. Cicero to Acilius Viceconsul, etc.
1. IN the pleasant and noble City Alesa, I have Marcus and Caius Claudius's;
Archagathus and Philo, my very good friends, both in their entertainments and
familiarity: but, I am afraid, lest because I commend unto you many at once
after an especial manner, I should seem out of a certain ambition to make my
commendations all alike: although you have abundantly satisfied both me and all
my friends.

2. But I would have you understand, that this family and all these men are
linked to me by old acquaintance, good turns, and loving affection.

3. And therefore I the rather request you, that you would further them in all
things, as far as may stand with your honor and credit.

4. If you do this, I shall take it as a very great favor. Farewell.

Fam. 13 33.
50. M. T. Cicero to Acilius Viceconsul, etc.
1. I Make use of Cneius Otacilius Naso as my very familiar friend, and so far,
that I am not more familiar with any man of his rank: for I am very much
delighted both with his humanity and honesty, in my daily converse with him.

2. You need not now expect, with words I should commend him to you, whom I so
make of, as I have written.

3. He has some business in the Province, which his freemen Hilarious,
Antigonus, Demostratus look after, whom I commend to you, and all Naso's
affairs, just as if they were mine own.

4. You will do me a very great favor, if I may understand, that this
commendation of mine has prevailed much with you. Farewell.

51. M. T. Cicero to Acilius Viceconsul, etc.
1. I Have had ancient acquaintance with Lyso of Lilybaeum, the son of Lyso,
and I am much respected by him; and I know him to be worthy both of such a
father, and grandfather, for it is a very noble family.

2. Therefore I do the more earnestly commend to you his estate and house, and
heartily desire you to take care, that he may understand that this commendation
of mine has been a great furtherance and honor to him with you. Farewell.

52. M. T. Cicero te Acilius Viceconsul, etc.
1. Caius Avianus Philoxenus is my old host; and, besides his hosteship, also
my very familiar friend, whom Caesar, to do me a courtesy, made a Citizen of
Novum Comum.

2. Besides, he has taken upon him the name of Avianus, because he was more
acquainted with no man, than with Flaccus Avianus, one that was my very
familiar friend, as I suppose you know.

3. All which things I have ripped up together, that you may conceive this is
no ordinary commendation of mine.

4. Therefore I request you, that you would assist him in all things, which you
may do without any trouble to you, and reckon him in the number of your
friends; and effect things, that he may understand, that these my Letters have
been a great furtherance to him.

5. That shall be a very great favor to me. Farewell.

53. Cicero to Plancus Imperator, Consul elect, etc.
1. AS soon as I had occasion given me to advance your honor, I omitted
nothing in your commendations, which consisted in the reward of virtue, or in
the honor of words.

2. You may perceive that, by the order of the Senate; for it is so recorded,
as I gave my judgment out of a writing; which a full Senate allowed, with an
earnest desire, and general consent.

3. Though I perceived by the Letter which you sent me, that you were more
delighted with the approbation of good men, than with the badges of glory; yet
I deemed, we ought to consider, though you desired nothing, how much the
Commonwealth was engaged to you.

4. You shall finish that which others have begun.

5. For he, that shall suppress Marcus Antonius, shall put an end to the war.

6. Therefore Homer called neither Ajax, nor Achilles, but Ulysses, A Conqueror
of Cities.

54. M. T. Cicero to Cassius, etc.
1. WHat was the state of things then when I writ this Letter, you may know by
Tidius Strabo, an honest man, and well-affected to the Commonwealth; for why
should I say, most affectionate toward you, who having left his house and
means is gone chiefly to you?

2. Therefore I do not so much as commend him to you, his coming will
sufficiently commend him unto you.

3. I would have you thus think, and persuade your self, that all the refuge of
good men lies in you and Brutus, if any thing cross happen, which I should be
loath.

4. For when I writ these things, matters were brought to the last cast.

5. For Brutus had now much ado to hold out at Mutina; who, if he be preserved,
we have got the victory; but if he be suppressed, (which God forbid) all men
will fly unto you.

6. Wherefore see you have so much courage, and so much provision, as is
necessary for recovering the whole Commonwealth. Farewell.

Fam. 12.17
55. M. T. Cicero to Cornificius his Colleague, etc.
1. YOur mindfulnesse of me, which you signified in your Letter, is very
pleasing to me; which I entreat you keep, not because I doubt of your
constancy, but because it is a fashion to entreat thus.

2. Some news of tumults have been told us out of Sy^ia, which because they are
nearer you then us, they trouble me more for your sake than for mine own.

3. All things are very qui^t at Rome, but so as one would wish rather some
wholesome and honest doing; which I hope will be, because I perceive Caesar has
a mind to it.

4 Understand, that while you are absent, I write more boldly, as having gotten
an occasion and liberty, and other things perhaps, which even you your self
would allow me.

5. But I writ lately of the best form of speaking, wherein I often suspected
that you differed a little from my judgment, as one scholar may do from
another.

6. I would have you give your good-liking to this Book from your heart; if it
be not so deserving, yet to do me a courtesy.

7. I will tell your friends, that they may write it out if they please, and
send it to you.

8. For I think, though you do not so well like the subject, yet, in that your
solitude, any thing that comes from me will delight you.

9. Whereas you recommend to me your reputation and honor, you do as all
others do: but I would have you think, that I both respect you much for the
love, which I know is betwixt us, and have such an opinion of your virtuous
studies, and the hope of your arising to great honor, that I prefer no man
before you, and think you have but few your equals. Farewell.

Fam. 1^.^4.
56. M. T. Cicero Thermus, etc.
1. BOth many things have liked me well, which you have done upon my
recommendation, and this especially, that you have so courteously used Marcus
Marcilius my friend's and interpreter's son.

2. For he came to Laodicea, and thanked you very much unto me, an^ ^e because
of you.

3. Wherefore, as for what is behind, I request you, seeing you have bestowed a
savor upon grateful persons, that you would the more willingly benefit them;
and endeavor, as far as it may consist with your credit, that the young-man's
mother-in-law may not be questioned.

4. As before I much commended Marcilius, so now I commend him much more;
because in his long attendance I have had experience of the singular, and
almost incredible fidelity, abstinence, and modesty, of his father Marcilius.
Farewell.

The First Book of C. Plinius Caecilius Secundus's Epistles.
1. C. Plin. Secundus, to his friend Septitius, Greeting.
1. YOu many times persuaded me to collect and publish my Epistles, if I had
been any whit more exact in writing them.

2. I have collected them, not observing the order of time, (for I did not make
an History) but as any one came to my hand.

3. It remains, you neither repent of your advice; nor ^ of my willingness
to pleasure you.

4. For so it shall come to pass, that I may seek up those which hitherto lie
neglected, and not keep them by me if I shall make any more. Farewell.

2. C. Plin. to his friend Arrianus, S.
1. BEcause I see your coming is somewhat slow, I send you a Book, which I
promised you in my former letters.

2. I entreat you both to read and correct it, according to your wont; and so
much the rather, because I seem not to have writ any thing before, all alike
with the same strift; for I have assayed to imitate Demosthenes, always yours,
and Calvus, lately mine, only in their flourishes of speech.

3. For but a few, whom God has endued with better parts, can attain to the
strength of such men.

4. Neither has the subject it self (I am afraid to speak too vau^tingly)
withstood this emulation.

5. For it consi^ted almost wholly in an earnest kind of speaking, which thing
roas^d me up, being grown very idle, if I be such a one as can be roused up.

6. Yet I do not wholly decline the Rhetorical expressions of our friend
Marcus, so often as I am admonished to digress a little from the purpose for
seasonable delectability; for I desire to be witty, not severe.

7. And there is no need why you should think I desire to be excused by this
note of restraint; nay rather, that I may the more set you upon correcting, I
will confess, that both I and my fellows are not against an edition, if you
perhaps will but seem to favor our mistakes.

8. For I must without fail set forth something, and I wish I may set out this
being the best which is ready (you hear an idle persons wish) but I must put it
forth for many reasons.

9. Chiefly, because the books which I have set out are said to be in every
bodies hands, though they have already lost the grace of their novelty; unless
the Booksellers flatter me.

10. But let them flatter and spare not, so long as by this lie they commend my
labors to my face. Farewell.

3. C. Plinius to his friend Caninius, etc.
1. WHat does Comum, which is your delight and mine? what does the most
pleasant mannor-house? what does the gallery which is always open to the Sun?
what does the shadie grove of Plane-trees? what does the green and pearly
rivolet? what does that Pond which lies near your house, and serves your uses?
what does that soft and yet solid place for one to be born up and down in? what
does that Bath, which the Sun shines fully upon, and goes round about it?
what do those dining-rooms for entertaining of a many? what do those which are
for entertainment of a few? what do the chambers which are to rest in on the
daytime, and those to sleep in at night? Do they take you wholly up, and share
you by turns?

2. Or, as you were wont, out of an earnestness to look after your estate, are
you distracted with often running to and fro? If they take you up, you are an
happy and blessed man; but if not, you are one of the ordinary sort.

3. But do you (for it is time) commit these base and sordid cares to others,
and amid this great and quiet retirement, buckle close to your studies.

4. Let this be your business, this your leisure; let this be your labor,
this your rest; let your watching and your sleep also be set upon these.

5. Invent, and print something, which may be your own for ever.

6. For, your other things will have one master after another, after you.

7. This will never cease to be yours, if once it begin.

8. I know what a spirit, what a disposition I exhort.

9. Do but you strive to be of so much worth to your self, as you shall seem to
be to others, if you but value your self.

4. C. Plinius to Pompeia Celerina his wives mother.
1. THat one short and stale epistle of mine (for now there needs none of
yo^rs) is sufficient to prove what great! plenty there is in your Manor at
Ortegoli, in that at Nerni, in that at Arceolo, in that at Perug^a; and that
there is also a Bath at Nerni.

2. Truly those things are not so much mine, which are mine own, ^s those
which are yours; yet herein they differ, in that your servants entertain me
more car^fully and busily, than my own do.

3. The same perhaps will befall you, if at any time you lie at my Manor;
which I would have you do, first, that you may as well enjoy my things, as I do
yours; and besides, that my folks may be awakened sometimes, who do carelessly,
and almost negligently wait on me.

4. For the awful respect of mild masters does decay amongst servants by
custom: they are excited with novelties, and strive to be commended to their
masters rather by others, than by themselves. Farewell.

5. Caius Plinius to his friend Voconius Romanus, etc.
1. HAve you seen any man more fearful and base than Ma^cus Regulus, since the
death of Domitian; under whom he had acted no lesser villainies than under Nero,
but more covert?

2. He began to be afraid, lest I should be angry with him; and he was not
mistaken, for I was angry.

3 He had fomented the danger of Rusticus Arulenus, he had rejoiced at his
death, insomuch as he recited and published a Book, in which he inveigheth
against Rusticus, and also calls him the Stoick's Ape.

4. He says moreover, that he was branded with a scar, which he got in
Vitellius's quarrel.

5. You know Regulus's eloquence of old.

6. He raileth against Heren^ius Senecio indeed so beyond all modesty, that
Metius Carus said to him, What have you to do with my dead friends? Am I any
whit vexatious either to Crassus or Camerinus? whom he had killed under Nero.

7. Regulus thought, that I was grieved at these things; and therefore when he
read his book, he invited not me to it.

8. Besides, he remembered how he had provoked me before the Centumviri, to the
danger of my l^fe.

9. I was for Arrio^^lla Timon's wife, at the request of Arulenus Rusticus;
Regulus was for the other party: We argued upon that part of the controversy,
in which judgment had been passed concerning Vertius Modestus, a very good man;
he was then banished by Domitian.

10. Lo, then says Regulus, I demand of you, Secundus, what you think of
Modestus?

11. You see what had been the danger, if I had answered, Well; what a
shameful act it had been, if I answered, Ill.

12. I cannot say but that some God was then with me.

13. I will answer, say I, what I think, if the Centumviri will determine about
it.

14 Again, says he, I demand what you think concerning Modestus.

15. I made answer again, Witnesses are wont to be interrogated against them
that are cited to appear, not against them that are already condemned.

16. He said the third time, I do not now ask what you think of Modestus, but
what you think concerning Modestus's loyalty.

17. Do you ask, said I, what I think? but I do not so much as think it lawful
to enquire touching one, upon whom judgment is passed.

18. He was quashed. I was commended and applauded, for that I had not wronged
my credit by any answer, which might perhaps have been profitable, yet withal
dishonest; nor ensnared my self in the wiles of such a treacherous question.

19. Being now therefore terrified in his conscience, he caught hold of
Caecilius Celer; by and by he entreats Fabius Justus, that they would make me
friends with him; and being not thus contented, he came to Spurina.

20. He said to him in a begging manner, (as he uses to be most s^eaking when
he is afraid) I entreat you to see Pliny in the morning at his house; but be
sure in the morning, (for I am not able to bear my trouble of mind any longer)
and work by any means that he may not be angry with me.

21. I had sat up all night at my study.

22. Says Spurina that brought his errand, I am coming to you. Nay, rather,
said I, I am coming to you.

23. We went together into Livia's walk: when we were turned o^e to another, he
told me Regulus's commands to him; and added entreaties of his own, as it
became a very honest man for one that was quite unlike himself; saying, Forbear
him.

24. To whom I made answer, You your self shall judge what answer you think it
is fitting for me to make Regulus. It is not fit that I should deceive you.

25. I look for Mauricus (for he was not yet returned from exile) and therefore
I can make no answer either way, being like to do whatsoever he shall think
fitting.

26. For it is fit he should first give his advice herein, and I should follow
it.

27. A few days after, Regulus met me in the Judgment-hall.

28. And following me thither, he desired to speak with me in secret; he said,
He was afraid lest it should stick deeply in my stomach, what he had once said
in a case before the Centumviri, when he answered me and Satrius Rufus, one
that has emulation with Cicero, and that is not contented with the eloquence
of our age.

29. I answered, That I now understood it was naughtily spoken, because he
himself had confessed it; but it might have been thought a thing honorable.

30. For (said I) I emulate Cicero; nor am I contented with the eloquence of
our age.

31. For I think it a great folly for one, not to set the best things before
him to imitate.

32. But why have you, that remember this case so well, forgotten that wherein
you asked me, what I thought concerning Metius M^^estus's loyalty.

33. He grew notably pale, though he look always palely.

34. Being put to a stand, he said* I asked not that I might do you any hurt,
but Modestus.

35. See the cruelty of the fellow, who does not dissemble, that he had a mind
to hurt an exile.

36. He added a fine excuse.

37. He writ (said he) in an epistle which was read before Domitian, Regulus
the veriest Rogue that ever went on two legs.

38. Which Modestus indeed had written very truly.

39. Here was almost the end of our talk, for I would proceed no further, that
I might keep all things free till Mauricus came.

40. Nor am I ignorant that Regulus is a man not easily to be overcome: For he
is rich, and factious; many men attend him, and more fear him; which is for the
most part a thing stronger than love.

41. Yet it may fall out, that these things being once shaken, may fall; for
the reputation of bad men is as treacherous as themselves.

42. But that I may say the same thing often over, I look for Mauricus; he is a
grave man, discreet, much experienced, and one that is able to foresee things
to come by what are past.

43. I shall see plain reason to attempt something, or desist, when he advises
me.

44. I have writ this to you, because it was fit that you, according to the
love that is betwixt us, should not only know what I do and say, but also what
I purpose. Farewell.

6. C. Plinius to his friend Cornelius Tacitus etc.
1. YOu will laugh, and laugh and welcome.

2. I, the Pliny whom you know, have caught three Boars, and those indeed very
fair ones.

3. You your self, say you? I my self: yet not so that I did quite forsake my
leisure and quiet.

4. I sat by the toils.

5. I had by me not a hunting-spear, or a lance, but a poitrell, and a
table book.

6. I did meditate something, and noted it down, that I might carry away, if
empty hands, yet my table book full.

7. You have no reason to slight this kind of studying.

8. It is a wonder to see, how the mind is raised up by this stirring, and
motion of the body.

9. Besides, the woods on all sides, and the solitude, and that very silence
which is to be observed in hunting, are great encitements to meditation.

10. And therefore when you shall go on hunting, you shall, by my advice, carry
a table book, as well as a bread-basket and a flaggon with you.

11. You shall find, that Diana does not more wander in the mountains than
Minerva. Farewell.

7 C. Plinius to his friend Octavius Rufus, etc.
1. SEe, in what Majesty you have set me, when as you give me the same power
and rule, which Homer gave to great Jupiter. God granted him the one, the other
he denied. For I can answer your request also by the like Yea-say and Nay-say.

2 For as it is lawful for me, especially at your request, to put off the
pleading for the Baetici against one man; so neither is it suitable to my
credit and constancy, to appear against a Province which you love, and which I
have once engaged by so many good offices, so many pains, and so many perils
of mine.

3. Therefore I shall keep this moderation, that of the two things which you
desire, I may choose that the rather, in which I may not only satisfy your
desire, but also your judgment.

4. For I ought not so much to consider, what you, being a worthy man, do
desire at present, as what you will be likely to approve at all times.

5. I hope I shall be at Rome about the fifteenth of October, and that, being
present, I shall make these things good to Gall^s, according to your promise
and mine; to whom, for all that, you may even now engage, as touching my
resolution,

This Jove did say, and beckened with his brows.

6. For why should I not discourse with you continually in Hom^^'s verses?
forasmuch as you do not suffer me to talk in yours, which I so earnestly covet,
that methinks I may be corrupted with this fee only, to appear even against
the Baetici.

7 I had like to have omitted one thing, which was by no means to be omitted,
that I have received your most excellent Dates, which now strive to exceed figs
and mushroms.

8. C. Plinius to his friend Pompeius Saturninus, etc.
1. YOur Letter was delivered to me in very good time, in which you desire
earnestly, that I would send you some of my writings, whereas I had determined
that very same thing.

2. You therefore have put spurrs to a free running horse, and at o^ce took
away from your self the pardon of refusing the pains, and from me the
bashfulnesse of requiring it. For it neither becomes me to be loath to use
that which is offered, nor you to think much with that which you have desired.

3. Yet there is no cause why you should expect any new work from an idle
person: for I am to request, that you would again take leisure-time to peruse
that Oration which I made to my fellow-Citizens, when I was to dedicate a
Library.

4. I remember indeed, you have already noted some things, but in a general
way; and therefore I now entreat you, that you would not only mind its
general subject, but also that you would correct every bit of it as exactly as
you are wont: for it will be free for me, after it is corrected, either to
publish it, or keep it by me.

5. Besides, perhaps the manner of correcting will incline this very lingering
of mine to agree to either way; which will either find it not, to deserve
putting forth, whilst it peruseth it often over; or make it worthy, whilst it
tries it: though the reasons of this my delaying do not appear so much in the
words, as in the sense of the matter.

6. For it is, as it were, somewhat more vainglorious and lofty: this will
blemish my modesty, although the style it self be mean and low, because I am
forced to treat both concerning my parents munificency, and my own.

7. This is a tickle and slippery subject, yea, when necessity does fawningly
allure it.

8. For if other men's praises use not to be willingly heard, how hard is it to
obtain, that the speech of one that speaks of himself or his friends, may not
seem troublesome?

9. For we both envy honest men themselves, and their glory, and the spreading
of it abroad somewhat more; and we less wrest and carp at such things as are
well done at the last, which are laid up in obscurity and silence.

10. For which cause I often thought with my self, Ought I to have composed
that, be it better or worse, only for my self, or for others as well as my
self?

11. That also puts me in mind, that many things which are requisite for the
dispatch of a business, have neither the like profit or grace, when the same
is done.

12. And that I may not fetch examples from afar off, What was more profitable,
than to pen out the manner of our munificency?

13. For by this I gained, first, that I paused upon honest thoughts; and
besides, that I saw the beauty of it by a longer tract; and lastly that I
avoided repentance, which is the companion of hasty lavishnesse.

14. There arose from these a certain practice of scorning mo^y.

15. For, whereas nature has tied all men to the keeping of it; on the quite
contrary, a love of liberality being much, and a long time together po^dered,
freed me from the common bonds of covetousness: and my munificencie seemed
likely to be so much the more commendable, because we were drawn to it not by
force, but upon deliberation.

16. This came in as another reason, that we did not promise sports, or
sword-plays; but yearly costs, for the maintenance of inge^uous children.

17. Besides, things that please the eyes and ears so far, need no
commendation, because they ought not so much to be set on by an O^ation, as to
be repressed.

18. And that one may willingly undergo the toil and ^ains of education, it
must be done not only by rewards, but also by exquisite persuasions.

19 For ^f Physicians set out their wholesome, but unpleasant meats, by f^ir
speech^s; how much mo^e does it become one, that consults for the public good,
to bring in a most profitable gift, but not altog^ther so popular by kindness
of speech; especially seeing it was needful for me to strive, that what was
applied to my parents, might be allowed on also by me, and that others might
patiently both behold and wonder at the honor of a few.

20. But as I then aimed rather at a common good, then private bragging, when I
desired that the intent^on and end of my gift might be conceived: so now I
fear, lest perchance I may seem not to have minded others benefit, but my own
praise, by this manner of edition.

21. Besides, I remember, with how much more delectation the fruit of
well-doing may be laid up in one's conscience, than in his commendation.

22. For reputation ought to f^llow, not to be followed after; and if by some
accident it do not follow, that which merits fame is not therefore the
lesse-comely.

23. But they that set down their own good deeds in words, are thought not to
talk of them, because they have done them; but to have done them, that they may
talk publicly of them.

24. So, that thing which is gallant, when another relates it, comes to
nothing, when he speaks of it who did it.

25. For when men cannot destroy a thing, they inveigh against the bragging of
it: so as if you do things that are not worthy to be spoken of, the deed it
self; but if you do things praiseworthy, you your self are blamed, because you
hold not your peace.

26. But a certain particular consideration troubles me; for I made not this
speech before the Commonalty, but before the Aldermen; not openly in every
bodies sight, but in the Town Hall.

27. I fear therefore it may not be convenient, that after I have avoided the
flattery and acclamation of the common sort in the speaking, I should now seek
after those very same things in the publishing: and that after I had shut the
Commons themselves (whose good was intended) without the doors and walls of the
Court, lest I might seem to make any show at all of ambition, I should now seek
after those, as it were, by a fawning kind of flattery, who are like to get
nothing from my gift, but the example.

28. You have the reasons of my delay; yet I will follow your advice, whose
authority shall be sufficient to me instead of a reason.

9. C. Plinius to his friend Minutius Fundanus, etc.
1. IT is a wonder to see how in the City an account may be given, or may seem
to be given, for several days; but for many or all it cannot be given.

2. For if you ask any one, What have you done to day? he may answer, I waited
on one that put on his toga virilis, I have been at an espousall or a wedding;
this man entreated me to seal to a Will, that man entreated me to be his
days-man, another entreated me to be of his counsel.

3. On what day you do these things, they seem necessary; if you consider that
you have done them every day, they seem vain; much more when you withdraw your
self.

4. For then you recall to mind, how many days you have spent, and about what
poor matters.

5. Which befalls me after I either read or write any thing in my
Country House Laurentium; or else am at leisure to recreate my body, by whose
props the mind is sustained.

6. I hear nothing, which it may repent me to have heard; I speak nothing,
which it may repent me to have spoken.

7. No man speaks ill of any one to me; I find fault with no body but my self
only, when I do not write very well.

8. I am troubled with no hope, nor any fear; I am disquieted with no rumors,
I discourse only with my self and my books.

9. O upright and sincere life! O sweet and honest leisure, and almost finer
then any kind of work!

10. O thou sea! O thou shore! a true and private place for study How many
things do you invent? how many things do you dictate?

11. Therefore do you also leave that noise, and idle running up and down, and
those very fond labors, as soon as you shall have opportunity, and give your
self to study or ease.

12. For it is better, as our Attilius said very learnedly and wittily, to sit
idle, than to do nothing. Farewell.

10. C. Plinius to his friend Atrius Clemens, etc.
1. IF ever our City flourished in liberal Arts, it flourishes most of all at
this day.

2. We have many and eminent examples: Euphrates the Philosopher has afforded
us one.

3. When I, being a young man, was a soldier in Asia, I was inwardly and
familiarly acquainted with him, and I strove that he might love me, though I
had no need to strive.

4. For he is a very gentle and familiar man, and full of courtesy, which he
taught.

5. And I wish I have but answered that hope, which he then conceived of me, as
he has added much to his own virtues.

6. But now I do admire them, because I understand them more; though indeed I
do not so much as now understand them sufficiently.

7. For as none but an artist can judge of a painter, a carver, or a maker of
earthen vessels; so none but a wise man (...) see thoroughly into a wiseman.

8. Yet, as far as I am able to discern, many things (...) so eminent, and
shine forth in Euphrates, that they may al^ (...) and delight them also that
are but mean scholars.

9. He disputes subtly, gravely, and neatly; he often also imitateth that
height and broadnesse which was in Pla^^.

10. His speech is copious and various, very sweet, a^ such as also draws and
enforces them that gainsay it

11. Besides he has a tall body, a handsome face, long hair, a great and hoary
beard; which things, though they may be thought to be such as come by chance,
and not worth taking notice of, yet they win him very much respect.

12. There is no frightfulness in his look, no sowrenesse; but much
stayednesse: one would so fear him, as not to be afraid to meet him.

13. There is a great deal of holiness in his life, and as much gentleness.

14. He inveigheth against vices, not men; nor does he find fault with them
that do amiss, but makes them better.

15. One would follow him when he gives advice, being attentive, and expecting
more from him, and desire to be persuaded, even when he has persuaded him.

16. And now he has three children, two sons, whom he diligently instructs.

17. Pompeius Julianus was his wives father, one great and famous both for the
rest of his life, and also for this one thing, in that he being a ruler of the
Province, amongst many high profers, made choice of this son-in-law as a great
man, not for honors, but for wisdom.

18. Though why should I write any more concerning a man, whom I may not enjoy?
That I should be more troubled? which is not lawful.

19. For I am busied in an office, which as it is a very great one, so it is
very troublesome.

20. I sit in the Judges seat, I subscribe bills, I order the Books of
accounts; I write a great many, but very illiterate letters.

21. I use sometimes (for this befell now and then) to complain unto Euphrates
of these employments.

22. He cheereth me up; and says also, That this is a part of Philosophy, and
indeed the chiefest, to mind business of public concernment, to hear matters;
to judge, to declare, and exercise justice, and to put in practice what they
teach.

23. Yet he does not convince me of this one thing, that it is better to do
those things, than to spend whole days in hearing and learning.

24. And therefore I do the more exhort you, that have leisure, that when you
come next unto the City, (and you may come for this reason the sooner) you
would put your self into his hands to be polished and perfected.

25. For I do not (as many do) envy others that good, which I want my self;
but, on the contrary, I take a kind of delight and pleasure, if I see my
friends enjoy those things which are denied to me. Farewell.

11. C. Plinius to Justus, etc.
1. YOu have sent me no letters this great while.

2. There is nothing, say you, that I can write: But write this very thing,
that there is nothing that you can write; or only that, with which the ancients
were wont to begin, If you be in health, it is well, I am in health.

3. This contenteth me, for it is the main matter.

4. Do you think I am in jest? I request it in good earnest. Let me know how
you do, touching which, I cannot remain ignorant, without very great trouble of
mind.

12. C. Plinius to Calestrius Tyro, etc.
1. I Have had a very great loss, if the forgoing of so worthy a man may be
called a loss.

2. Coraelius Rufus is deceased, and indeed of his own voluntary will, which
does exasperate my grief.

3. For it is a most sorrowful kind of death, which seems to ^e neither
natural nor fatal.

4. For howsoever there is great comfort to be taken from very necessity,
touching those that die upon some disease; in those who die a voluntary death,
the grief is incurable, because they are thought to have been able to live a
long time.

5. Indeed a main reason, which wise men account as a necessity, enforced
Corellius to this course, though he had many reasons to live, a very good
conscience, a very good repute, a very great authority; besides, he had a
daughter, a wife, a nephew, a sister, and amongst so many pledges of love, true
friends.

6. But he strugled with such a long and such a grievous sickness, that these
so great engagements to live were outvied with the reasons of his death.

7. He had been troubled with the gout (as I heard him say) three and thirty
years.

8. This was hereditary to him; for diseases too, for the most part, as well as
other things, are delivered by certain successions.

9. Whilst his youth lasted, he overcame and mastered it by abstinence and
sanctity: now at last he bare it with the strength of his mind, as it
increased in his old age, when indeed he endured incredible tortures, and most
cruel torments.

10. For now the pain did not settle in his feet only, as it did before, but
went over all his limbs.

11. I came unto him in the time of Domitian, as he lay in his Country House.

12. His servants went away out of the chamber, for he used this fashion, as
often as any friend that was more trusty, came in; and his wife also, though she
was very able to conceal any secret, went aside.

13. He cast his eyes about, And why do you think (said he) do I abide these so
great pains so long a time? Truly, that I may outlive that villain but one day.

14. Had one given this Mind a Body like it, he had done what he desired.

15. Yet God heard his wish; which after he had obtained, as one that was now
like to die without care, and free, he brake those many, but lesser stays,
which would have kept him alive.

16. His sickness had increased, which his temperance strived to mitigate, and
his constancy avoided when it continued still.

17. Now a second, third, and fourth day he forbore food: his wife Hispulla
sent to me our common friend Cajus. Geminius with a very sad errand, that
Coraellius had resolved to dye, and could neither be persuaded by hers nor his
daughters entreaties; and that I was the only man who was able to recall him
to life.

18. I ra^ I was come into the next room, when Julius Atticus told me from the
same Hispulla, that now not so much as I could prevail with him, that he was
grown more and more obstinately resolute.

19. He had said indeed to the Physician, that advised him to take meat, I am
dead; which word left as much want, as admiration of him in my mind.

20. I consider what a friend, what a man I want.

21. He had lived full threescore and seven years; which age is long enough,
even for those that are the most lusty.

22. I know, he has got away from a continual sickness; I know, he dyed
leaving his friends alive after him; and when the Commonwealth was in its
flourish, which he valued more than he did all his friends, I know this too.

23. Yet I grieve as for the death both of a young man, and one that was very
strong; but I grieve, although you may think me weak, for my own sake.

24 For I have lost, I have lost the witness, the ruler, the master of my
life; let me tell you in short, what in my fresh sorrow I told my friend
Calvisius; I am afraid lest I should live more carelessly.

25 Do you therefore apply comforts to me; not such as these: He was an old
man, he was infirm (for I know these) but some new ones, but great ones; such
as I never heard, such as I never read.

26. For those which I have heard, and those which I have read, came into my
mind of themselves, but they are overborn by so great sorrow. Farewell.

13. C. Plinius to Sosius Senecio, etc.
1. THis year has afforded great store of Poets.

2. There was not a day almost in all the month of April, in which some one did
not read.

3. It pleases me that studies do flourish, that men's wits put forth and show
themselves; though they come slowly to hear, and many do sit in the walks, and
spend the time for hearing in talking, and ever now and then bid some body
bring them word, whether the Reader be gone in already, whether he has done
with his preface, and whether he have almost read out his book or not.

4. Then at last, and then too they come but slowly and leisurely; neither for
all that do they tarry it out, but go away again before it be done; some
closely, and as if they stole away; others, openly and freely.

5. And truly, within the memory of our parents, they report, that Claudius
Caesar, when he walked in his palace, and heard a noise, asked the cause; and
when it was told him that Nonianus read, he went in on him as he read on a
sudden and unexpected.

6. Now every one that has least to do, being entreated long before, and ever
and anon put in mind, either comes not at all; or, if he comes, he
complains that he has lost a day, because he did not lose it.

7. But they be so much the more to be commended and approved on, whom this
laziness, or pride of the hearers, does not hinder from their desire to write
and recite.

8. Truly I failed no man almost: the most indeed were my friends.

9. And there is no man almost that loves learning, that does not also love me.

10. For these reasons I spent longer time in the city, then I had intended.

11. I may now retire my self and write something, which I must not read
openly, lest I should seem not to have been a hearer but a creditor to them, at
whose readings I was present.

12. For as in other things, so in this charge of reading, a good turn is lost
if it be demanded again. Farewell.

14. C. Plinius to his friend Junius Mauricus, etc.
1. YOu desire me to look out a husband for your brother's daughter, which you
do well to enjoyne chiefly upon me.

2. For you know how much I respected and loved that worthy man, and by what
exhortations he cherished me being a youth, and by what commendations he
wrought that I might seem praiseworthy.

3. There is nothing that you command me, either greater or more pleasing;
nothing that I can more honestly undertake, than to make choice of a young
maid, of whom it may befit grandchildren should be born to Arulenus Rusticus.

4. Who indeed might have been long to be sought for, but that Minucius
Acilianus was ready, and as it were provided to hand, who loves me dearly, as
one young man loves another, (for he is younger then me by a very few years)
and reverenceth me as if I were ancient; for he desires to be taught and
instructed by me, as I was wont to be by you.

5. Brixia is his Country, a part of our Italy, which yet retains and keeps
much of its modesty, frugality, and even ancient rusticity.

6. His father, Minutius Macrinus, a very noble gentleman, because he desired
no higher preferment, being elected by Divus Vespasian to be one of the
Praetors, constantly preferred honest quiet before this ambition, shall I call
it, or honor of ours.

7. He has a grandmother by the mother's side, Serrana Procula, of the
corporation of Padua; you know the fashions of the place.

8. Yet for all that, Serrana is a pattern of stayednesse to them of Padua.

9. He has an uncle also by the mother's side, of almost passing gravity,
prudence, and faithfulness.

10. In short, there will be nothing in the whole family, which will not like
you as well as in your own.

11. But Acilianus himself is vigorous and industrious, though withal very
bashful; he has very honestly gone thorough the Quaestorship, the
Tribuneship, and the Praetorship; and has acquitted you of the trouble of
getting voices for him.

12. He has an ingenuous countenance, very sanguine, and ver^ ^uddy.

13* The personablenesse of his whole body is gentlemanlike; and indeed his
graceful carriage is such as becomes a Senator; which things I suppose are
in no wise to be neglected: For this ought to be bestowed as a reward upon
young women's chastity.

14. I know not whether I should say besides, that his father has a large
estate; for when I imagine what manner of man you are, for whom we seek a
son-in-law, I think I must be silent concerning means; when I look upon the
public customs, and also the laws of the city, which do presume, that men's
estates are chiefly to be considered, not so much as that indeed seems to be
omitted.

15. And truly, for one that has consideration of grandchildren, and more
that shall descend from these, this is to be observed in choosing proffers.

16. You perhaps may think that I have followed my own fancy too much, and to
have set out these things more then is true; but I dare engage upon my credit,
that you shall find all things to be far more then I have spoken of them.

17. Truly I love the young man most ardently, as he deserves.

18. But this is the duty of one that loves his friend, not to praise him
overmuch. Farewell.

15. C. Plinius to his friend Septitius Clarus, S.
1. HOe! you Sir, you promised me to come to supper, but you did not.

2. The controversy is decided, you shall pay the charges to the full, and
that is not a little.

3. There were provided Lettuces for every one, three Snails, a couple of Eggs,
Frumenty, with sweet wine and snow, (for you shall reckon this also, yea, this
especially, which melts in a dish of Spanish Olives) Gourds, Onyons, and a
thousand other things, as dainty as these.

4. You might have heard a Comedian, or a Reader, or a Harper, or, such is my
liberality, all these.

5. But you chose rather to have Oysters, Sows bellies, Sea Hedg-hogs, and
Gatidane Songs, with I know not who.

6. You shall be punished, I will not tell you how.

7. You have dealt very unkindly; I know not whether you envied your self,
certainly you did me; but yet you envied your self also.

8. How much should we have played, laughed, and studied?

9. You may sup more gallantly with many, but never more merrily, plainly, and
securely than with me: in short, do but try.

10. And if hereafter you cannot rather excuse your self to others, excuse your
self always to me. Farewell.

16. C. Plinius to his friend Euritius, etc.
1. I Loved Pompeius Saturninus, I call him our friend; and I commended his wit
even before I knew, how full of variety, how pliant, and how capacious it was:
and now it detaineth me wholly, takes me up, and possesses me.

2. I have heard him pleading sharply and earnestly, and no less exquisitely
and neatly, whether he uttered words premeditated or extemporary.

3. There are apt and often sentences, a grave and comely composure of sounding
words, and such as are ancient.

4. All these are wonderfully taking, when they are pronounced with a kind of
vehemence, and thundering: they take, if they be repeated again.

5. You will be of my mind, when you have taken his Orations into your hands,
which you will readily compare to any of the Ancients; whom he desires to
imitate.

6. Yet in his History he will give you more satisfaction, either for its
brevity, or clearness, or pleasantness, or elegancy; and likewise for its
gallantnesse of style.

7. For there is the like pithinesse in his speeches that there is in his
Orations; yet it is closer, shorter, and more contracted.

8. Besides, he makes verses, such as my friend Catullus and Calvus have made.

9. How much pleasantness, sweetness, spitefulness, and love does he implant
in them?

10. And indeed he does on set purpose make some verses more wanton, some more
smooth, some more rough; as my friend Catullus and Calvus did.

11. He read me lately some Epistles, which, he said, were his wives; I thought
Plautus or Terence were readd, being resolved into prose.

12. Which whether they are his wise's, as he affirms; or his own, as he
denies; he deserves like renown: who either made them himself, or made his
wife, which he had of a maid, so learned and complete.

13. His book is therefore by me all the day long: I read it as if it were not
the same, before I write, when I have written, and also when I recreate my self.

14. Which I both exhort and advise you also to do.

15. For it ought to be no prejudice to his works, that he is alive.

16. If he had lived amongst them that we never saw, we should not only
enquire after his books, but also his pictures; And shall the credit of the
same man now living, and his praise, wax less, as it were, out of
loathsomeness?

17. But this is naught and wicked, not to admire a man, that is most worthy
admiration, because it falls out that we may see him, speak to him, hear him,
and embrace him; and not only commend, but also love him. Farewell.

17. C. Plinius to his friend Cornelius Titianus, etc.
1. MEn have yet some care of their credit and duty.

2. There are some that show themselves also friends to the dead.

3. Titinius Capito has got leave of our Emperor, that he may set up Lucius
Syllanus's statue in the commonplace.

4. It is a fine thing, and such as deserves great commendation, to make use
of the Prince's favor for this end; and in promoting others to honor, to try
how much you are in favor.

5. It is Capito's wont altogether to have gallant men in estimation; it is a
wonder to see with what devotion, and with what affection, he keeps the
pictures of the Bruti, the Cassii, and the Cato's at his house, where he may do
it.

6. He also sets out the life of every most famous man in excellent verses.

7. One may judge him to exceed in virtue himself, who loves other men's
virtues so well.

8. Lucius Silanus has his due honor restored unto him, for whose lasting
memory he has consulted, as well as for his own.

9. For it is not more honorable and excellent to have a statu^ in the common
place at Rome, than to set one up.

18. C. Plinius to his friend Tranquillus, etc.
1. YOu write that you was made afraid by a dream, lest you should miscarry in
your pleading.

2. You entreat, that I would petition for a Demurre, and that but for a very
few days; truly, I may excuse to morrow, it is hard to gain any delay, but I
will try. -- for God sends dreams.


3. Yet it is a great matter to know, whether you dream of things like to come
to pass, or the contrary.

4. That which you fear seems to me, when I consider my own dream, to portend
a gallant pleading.

5. I had undertaken Julius Pastor's cause, when my wife's mother seemed to me,
when I was asleep, prostrate at my feet, to beseech me that I would not plead.

6. And I was ready to plead, being somewhat young yet; I was in a cause before
the Centumviri; I was against the chief men of the City, and also such as were
Caesar's friends: all which things had been able to daunt me after so hard a
dream.

7. Yet I pleaded, considering that saying, One presage is the best, to fight
for one's country.

8. For my promise seemed to me as my country, if yet any thing be dearer to me
then my country.

9. It had a good event, and therefore that pleading got me men's favorable
attention, and opened a way to my renown.

10. See you therefore, whether you cannot interpret that dream of yours to any
good, after this example of mine: or if you think that precept of a very
discreet man to be more safe, What you doubt of do not do, write back what that
is you doubt of.

11. I shall find some subtle trick or other, and so speak in your cause, that
you may plead it your self when you will.

12. For certainly your mind is one, and mine was another.

13. For a cause before the Centumviri can no way be delayed; that of yours can
hardly, yet it may be delayed.

19 C. Plinius to his friend Romanus Firmus, etc.
1. YOu were my towns-man, and school-fellow, and fellow-tabler from four or
five years of age; your father was well acquainted with my mother, and my uncle
by my mother's side, and me also, so far as the diversity of our age would
suffer: there are great and weighty reasons, why I should defend and add to
your honor.

2. That you have an estate of 500 l. does plainly enough appear, forasmuch as
you are an Alderman in our corporation.

3. And therefore that we may fully enjoy you, not only as an Alderman, but
also as a Gentleman of Rome, I offer you 1500 l. to make up the means of a
Roman Gentleman, which is 2000 l.

4. The constant continuance of our friendship does engage, that you will be
mindful of this that I give you.

5. I do not indeed mind you of that, because I ought to mind you, saving that
I know you will strive of your own accord to use that honor, which I have
bestowed upon you, very modestly, as bestowed upon you by me.

6. For that honor is more carefully to be preserved, wherein also a friend's
courtesy is to be regarded. Farewell.

20. C. Plinius to his friend Cornelius Tacitus, etc.
1. I Have many disputes with a learned and skillful man, whom nothing pleases
so much in pleading causes, as brevity; which I confess is to be observed, if
the cause permit; otherwise it is but collusion to pass by things that are to
be spoken; it is collusion too to touch those things hastily and briefly which
are to be insisted upon, fastened in, and repeated; for many things have a
certain force and weight by larger handling.

2. For as a dart is fastened in the body, so speech in the mind, not by the
force more than by the stay.

3 In this he deals with me by testimonies, and amongst the Greeks, he boasts
to me of Lysias's orations; amongst our own, of the Gracchi and Cato, many of
whose indeed are curt and short.

4. I oppose Demosthenes, Aeschines, and Hyperides, to Lysias, and man, besides
to the Gracchi and Cato, viz Pollio, Caesar, Caelius, and chiefly Marcus
Tullius, whose oration is said to be the best, which is the biggest.

5. And truly, as other good things, so every good book is the better, the
bigger it is.

6. ^ou see how nothing more than their greatness commends statues, images,
pictures; besides, the shapes of men, and many living things, and trees also,
if they be but handsome.

7. So it betides in Orations; moreover their bulk adds a kind of authority
and grace to the very volumes.

8. These arguments, and many others which I use to allege to the same purpose,
as he is very full of his shifts and slippery in disputing, he so shifteth,
that he maintains, these very same men, upon whose Orations I grounded, to
have spoken fewer words than they have published.

9. I am quite of another mind.

10. Many orations of many men are my witnesses, and those of Cicero for
Marena, for Varenus, wherein a short and bare noting, as it were, of some
crimes is shown by their titles alone.

11. By these it is apparent, that he spoke very many things, and omitted them,
when he put forth his orations.

12. The same Tully pleading for Cluentius, says, That he alone pleaded a
whole cause to the end, after the old custom, and that he pleaded for Cornelius
four days together; we can make no doubt, but that he abridged what he had
spoken at large for many days together, as it was needful, being afterward
pared and purged, into one book, a great one indeed, and yet but one.

13. A good pleading is one thing, an oration another.

14. I know some think it to be so, but I (perhaps I am mistaken) am persuaded,
that it may fall out, that a pleading may be good, which is not a good oration;
and that it cannot be but a good pleading which is a good oration.

15. For an oration is the pattern of a pleading, and, as it were, the first
copy.

16. And therefore in every good oration, we find a thousand extemporary
flourishes; and in these too which we know were only set forth, as in that
against Verres, an Artificer, Whom? You do well to put me in mind. They said it
was Polycletus.

17. It follows then, that that pleading is the most absolute, which does
most resemble an Oration, if so be it gain a convenient and due time; which if
it be denied, it is no fault of the Oration, but the greatest of the judge.

18. Those Laws make for my opinion, which allow the longest times, and do not
persuade them that plead to brevity, but to copiousness, that is, diligence:
which briefness cannot show but in very narrow causes.

19. I will add what use, which is an excellent master, has taught me; I have
often pleaded, I have often been a judge, I have often sat in counsel: one
thing moves one man, one another; and for the most part small matters draw on
the greatest; men's judgments are various, their wills are various; hence it is,
that they that have heard the same cause together, often think another,
sometimes the same thing, but according to their several affections.

20. Besides, every one favors his own invention, and holds that for most
certain which he has foreseen, when it is mentioned by another.

21. We must therefore grant to every one something, which they may apprehend,
and which they may own.

22. Regulus said once to me, when we pleaded together, You think all things
that belong to a Cause are to be prosecuted, but I presently espy the throat,
and I press upon it. He presses indeed what he chooses, but he often
mistaketh in his choice.

23. I made answer, That there may hap to be a knee, or a leg, or an anckle,
where he thinks the throat to be.

24. But I (said I) who cannot espy the throat, assay all things, I try all
things; in short, I remove every stone.

25. And as in husbandry, I mind and order not only my vineyards, but also my
woods; and not only my woods, but also my plain grounds; and in my plain
grounds, I do not sow wheat and rye alone, but barley, beans, and other pulse:
So in pleading, I scatter many seeds, as it were, far and wide, that I may
gather what do come of them.

26. For judges wits are full as dubious, uncertain, and fallacious, as the
nature of weather and grounds.

27. And I know very well, that that excellent orator Pericles was thus
commended by the Comic Poet Eupolis.

28. And forthwith on his lips did sit
Persuasion; he alone could fit
His words to every hearers mind,
So as he left a sting behind.


29. But neither did that goddess of speech, nor that he cherishes them,
befall Pericles himself by a shortness or quickn^sse of speech, or both these
(for they differ) without an excellent faculty of speaking.

30 For to delight, to persuade, require copiousnesse of speech, and time; and
he only is able to leave a sting in his hearers minds, who does not prick, but
fasten it in.

31. Add, what another Comoedian says of the same Pericles. He flashed, he
thundered, he confounded Greece.


32. For not a curt and short oration, but a large, stately, and lofty one
flasheth, and in conclusion troubles and confounds all things.

33. Yet a mean is best, who denies it? Yet he as well misseth the mean, that
comes below a thing, as he that goes above it; that speaks too little, as
he that speaks too much.

34. And therefore as you often hear that, too much, and more than needs, so
you may this, poorly and weakly; one is said to have outgone the matter,
another is said to have fallen short of it; they both offend alike, the one by
his weakness, the other by his strength; which truly, though it be not the
token of a more pure, yet it is the sign of a greater wit.

35. Nor indeed, when I say this, do I like him in Homer, that had no measure
in his words, but him that spoke Words even like unto a winter's snow;
not but that he also pleases me exceeding well, who uttered Few words, but
very sweet.

36. Yet if I might have my choice, I would have that oration which is like a
winter's snow, that is, thick, continual, and plentiful; at the last, divine
and heavenly.

37. But a short pleading is more taking with many.

38. It is so indeed; but to idle persons, to respect whose niceness and sloth,
as a judgment, is a fondness.

39. For if you advise with these, it is not only better to plead briefly, but
not at all.

40. This my opinion yet, which I shall alter, if you dissent; but I pray you
tell me plainly, why you dissent?

41. For though I ought to yield to your authority, yet I think it better in so
weighty a matter to be overruled by reason than authority.

42. Therefore, if I seem not to mistake, write so in as short a letter as you
will; but yet write, for you will settle my judgment; but if I seem to mistake,
provide a very large letter.

43. I have not hurt you, who have enjoined you to a necessity of a short
epistle, if you be of my mind; of a very long one, if you dissent from me.
Farewell.

21. C. Plinius to his friend Paternus, etc.
1. AS I rely very much upon your judgment, so upon that of your eyes; not
because you are so very wise, lest you should be too proud of your self, but
because you are as wise as I, though this be also a great deal.

2. But to let jesting go, I believe these are handsome servants which are
bought me by your counsel; it remains that they be honest, which is a thing
to be judged concerning them that are to be sold, rather by the ears than the
eyes. Farewell.

22. C. Plinius to his friend Catilius Severus, etc.
1. I Have tarried now a long time in the city, and indeed as one astonished.

2. The long and continued sickness of Titus Aristo does much trouble me, one
whom I both admire and love exceedingly; for he is as grave, as honest, and as
learned, as any man in the world: so that I think not one man, but learning it
self, and all good arts, are very much endangered in one man.

3. How well skilled is he both in the civil and in the common law? what a deal
of histories, examples, and antiquities does he understand? there is nothing
that you desire to learn, which he cannot teach: He is indeed to me a treasury,
as often as I enquire after any thing that is mysterious.

4. Besides, how much credit there is in his words, how much authority, what a
fine and graceful lingering? What is there which he does not know out of hand?
and yet he makes a stop for the most part, and is at a doubt through the
diversity of reasons; which, with a sharp and great judgment, he fetches,
discerns, and considers from their original and first causes.

5. Besides, how sparing he is in his diet? how moderate in his apparel?

6. I use to look upon his very chamber and bed, as a kind of picture of
ancient frugality

7. His gallantnesse of spirit does set out these things, which does nothing
for outward show, but all things according to his conscience; and looks for
the reward of what is well done, not from people's talk, but from what is done.

8. In short, one shall have much ado to compare any one of those that make a
show of Philosophy, to this gallant man.

9. He does not follow the schools, nor the galleries, or please other men's and
his own leisure with long disputations; but he is in his gown, and in his
business, he helps many by pleading for them, and more by his counsel.

10. Yet he will come behind none of those that are the chief in chastity,
piety, justice, or fortitude.

11. You would wonder, if you were by, to see with what patience he bears
this very sickness, how he strugleth with his pain, how he abides thirst, how
lying still and all covered, he passes over the incredible heat of his
ague-fits.

12. A while ago he called me, and some few with me, whom he loves very well,
and entreated us that we would ask the physicians concerning the chief point of
this sickness, that if it were past remedy, he might die a voluntary death;
but if it were only difficult and long, he might abide it.

13. For he must yield to his wife's entreaty, he must yield to his daughter's
tears, he must yield also to us his friends, that he may not forsake our hopes,
if they be not in vain, by a voluntary death.

14. I think that to be a very hard matter, and worthy especial commendation.

15. For to run upon death by a kind of fury and instinct, is an ordinary thing
with many; but to deliberate and consider its causes, and to undertake, or lay
aside a resolution for life or death, as reason shall persuade, is the property
of a gallant spirit.

16. And the Physicians indeed do promise us, that all will be well; it
remains, that God say Amen to what they say, and at last deliver me from this
thought somnesse: which when I am freed from, I will go again to my
Laurentinum, that is, to my books, and my writing-tables, and my leisure to
study.

17. For now I have either no leisure, whilst I sit by him, to write or to read
any thing; or I have no list, being so much troubled.

18. You now understand what I fear, what I wish, and likewise what I intend
for hereafter.

19. Do you in like manner write to me again what you have done, what you do,
and what you mean to do, but in a more pleasant manner.

20. It will be no small ease to my grief, if you complain of nothing. Farewell.

23. C. Plinius to his friend Pompeius Falco, etc.
1. YOu ask me whether I think it fitting for you to plead causes for you in
your Tribuneship.

2. It is very much to the matter, what you think the Tribuneship to be; an
empty shadow, and a title without honor, or a reverend office, and how fitting
it is, as it should not be controuled by any, so neither by it self.

3. When I was Tribune my self, perhaps I might be mistaken, who thought my
self to be any thing; but as if I had been so, I forbear pleading causes:
First, because I thought it an ugly thing for him, to whom every body ought to
rise up, to whom every one ought to give room, to stand, whilst all other folks
sat: and for him, that might bid every one hold his peace, to be commanded
silence by an hour-glasse; and for him, whom it was not lawful to interrupt as
he spoke, to hear even reproachful words; and if he let them go unrevenged, to
be taken for a coward; if he did revenge them, for a proud fellow.

4. I considered this trouble also, if one by chance had appealed to me, either
he for whom I was, or he against whom I pleaded, whether I should help him, or
sit still and be silent, and make my self a private person, as if I had
forsworn my office.

5. Being swayed by these reasons, I chose rather to behave my self as a
Tribune to every body, than a Counselor to a f^w.

6. But hark, (I will say it again) it is very much to the matter, what you
think the Tribuneship ^o be, and what person you will take upon you, which is
to be so fitted to a wise man, as that it be born out to the last.

24. C. Plinius to his friend Bebius Hispanus, etc.
1. TRanquillus my chamber-fellow is desirous to buy a little field, which a
friend of yours is said to offer to sell.

2. I desire you to take order that he may buy it at a reasonable rate, for so
it will please him to have bought it.

3. For a bad purchase is always unpleasing, most of all, because it seems to
upbraid the owner with his folly.

4. But in this little field there are many things which set my friend
Tranquillus on, (if he like the price) its nearness to the city, the
convenience of the way, the smalness of the village, the quantity of the
ground, which may rather invite than busy one.

5. Besides, to scholars that are addicted to their studies, as this man is, so
much ground is enough in all reason, as that they may ease their brain, refresh
their eyes, walk softly about the bounds, and use one track, and know and count
all their little vines and small trees.

6. I have told you these things thus particularly, the (...) may the better
know how much he is like to be beholden to me, and I to you, if he buy that
little farm, which is commended for those conveniences, at a reasonable rate;
that it may not give him cause to repent of his bargain. Farewell.

Twenty of John Ravis Textor's Epistles.
Epist. 1.
1. I Had a desire long ago to speak with you, and to advise in very few words,
at the entreaty of your friends, which may be for your good.

2. I and some of your friends, who have always won your favor to them from a
child, supped at my house yesterday.

3. When we talked together of several things, as we were at supper, there came
to us an unlooked-for messenger, I know not who he was, an intimate friend of
yours, as he said.

4. Your mother presently (as parents are inquisitive after their children)
began to ask, in what case her son was, how well he had his health, and how
much he had benefited in his learning.

5. He made answer, That you were in good liking indeed, and that you were
willing to be advised by your friends in all things; but that you had no mind
at all to your book.

6. Which when the poor woman heard, (ah me) how she took on!

7. My words would have no credit with you, if I should lay open to you her
complaints of your negligence.

8. For she took on more heavily than can be believed.

9. I entreat you, that, if you have played the fool hith^, you would now grow
wise, and give your mind to your studies.

10. For if through your negligence you should always (as they say) take a long
sleep, you would cause the death of her, which was the cause of your life.
Farewell.

Epist. 2.
1. A Great many of your friends have taken it very ill, that they have a great
while since admonished you with daily reproofs what may be for your credit, and
yet you give occasion to their continual clamours.

2. They desired, and hoped that it would come to pass, that your Works, which
have lien a long time amongst worms and moths, may be published; that both by
the edition you may gain some credit, and also that young students may be
benefited by them.

3. What harm, I pray you, would it do you, if you should answer all our
desires? Do you not think that it is a great trouble to your parents, to have a
repulse from you, from whom they promised themselves all things?

4. I am not so unexperienced in things, but that I easily conceive, that
nothing ought to be committed to men's curious censures, till it be ripe, and
concocted.

5. Moreover, the works and labors of the best writers are for the most part
scratched and blotted by critical readers.

6. Nevertheless, seeing you (that is, a man which is a great scholar) have
exactly perfected your labors, you may safely (in my judgment) bring forth,
what you have a long while been in travail withal.

7. For I deem you to be beyond all danger of blots, and marks; neither do I
conceive any harm likely to come thence, but that thereby you will win the
good will of docible young men, and satisfy the desires of your friends: to
whom, if you do not yield, you will be sure to have an ill name as long as you
live. Farewell.

Epist. 3.
1. I Am ashamed of this age of ours, wherein this custom is grown into use,
that if any ordinary fellow, or one that is but half a scholar, has after a
gross manner (as they say) rather patched together, than handsomely made a
piece of work, we presently think it fitting to be committed to men's censures,
that are ready to carp at every thing, and such as every body will desire to
read and to buy.

2. As though we had not had trial, that nothing is so well done, but it is
sometimes dashed out with the reader's sharp nails, and black-lead pens.

3. But some ask, to what end do you speak these words?

4. You persuaded me a few days ago, that I would take order to print some
frivolous toys, which I had made when my study was interrupted for the most
part: besides, you seemed to blame my folly, because I had forborne so long to
do this.

5. Truly you are far out of the way, who do not consider Horace's advice,
who advises, That an edition should not be hastened too fast, but be nine years
before it be printed.

6. Do you not see, that many very eloquent men have abidden the Censor's
sponges, that wipe out things?

7. If therefore I should examine these first fruits of my labor, what would
you say would come thereof, seeing I have writ nothing worth setting out;
nothing, which may not rather incline the squeasie stomach of the reader to
sleep, than force it to read more.

8. Whatsoever I have, I am beholden to my parents for it; yet I will strive
rather to consult for my own credit, than to yield rashly to their unwary
judgments.

Epist. 4.
1. SEeing your parents have sent you thither for delight, whither they use to
be sent that love learning; endeavor, I pray you, not to fail that opinion
which they have of you.

2. I told you in the last Letter which I sent you, how much your mother took
on, because she heard that you profited little as yet, or nothing at all in
your learning.

3. You would be of a perverse disposition if you should not yield to your
friends entreaties, who advise you honest things, and such as may be for your
good.

4. It is your duty to obey us, as well as ours to persuade you.

5. Do we persuade you any thing, which is not good to be done?

6. We, if you do not know, busy our selves about your benefit, not our own.

7. We should not care what comes of your negligence, or sloth, but that we
know it will do you hurt.

8. Therefore do as we advise you, and all things will go well with you.

9. For if you do so, we will plentifully afford you all things according to
your desire. Farewell.

Epist. 5.
1 FOrasmuch as you see for certain, that one cannot come to the height of any
thing, but from beginnings that go before, I much wonder, that you so slight
the lesser disciplines, (without which notwithstanding, there is no room for
the greater) that you altogether debar your self from the study of them.

2. Do you think them unprofitable and fruitless, because they are so far from
ostentation?

3. It usually happens, that they which refuse or blush at first, to be
exercised in the first elements, show and make trial of the slender reach of
their own wit, in those things which are more lofty.

4. For it is not to be believed, that a house will be strong, which stands
upon weak and decayed foundations; or that they will not be like to lie down
under a great burden, that are weary with a little one.

5. If you were wise, you would not attempt too high things, but rather imitate
young-birds, which never go out of their nests till they be fledge, nor
adventure their small bodies to the air, before they have learnt that they are
fit to fly, having made trial beforehand. Farewell.

Epist. 6.
1. THere arise to me every day new troubles, which do every way torment my
mind more than any man can believe.

2. But there is nothing that does more increase my grief, than when I remember
your base course of life.

3. Three years are already gone and past, since your parents have maintained
you at the University with no small charge, and have afforded you all things in
abundance, according to your own desire.

4. Yet there were some persons of very good credit, who told me a few days
ago, that you profited little as yet, or nothing at all at your studies, so as
at every third word you commit a Barbarism.

5. You may do as you please: live as you list your self; I will give you over:
Yet know, that all your matters will go to wrack, except you reform your course
of living.

A Distich.
So many happy days I wish you still,
As there are honey-combs on Hybla-hill.
Epist. 7.
1. YOu regard not, as far as I hear, your friends advice, who for all that
strive to benefit you.

2. Neither do I care, or am I much troubled, that you set so light by my words.

3. But I am troubled that you do not obey them, who are able to do you hurt as
well as good.

4. You will take a very bad course, as I perceive, if you persist in your
wonted folly, neither shall you obtain from your friends pardon for your fault,
except you repose your self upon them, to whom you are most deeply engaged.

5. Farewell, and think that I speak in earnest, not in jest.

6. For unless you do as I advise you, you will scarce make an honest man.

A Distich.
I wish you never sick may be,
Till sheep and wolves do well agree.
Epist. 8.
1. IF I thought that my Letters would be any whit pleasing to you, and be
liked by you, I would as well strive to satisfy you by writing, as you have
long since forced me by your often calling upon me to do it.

2. For I cannot desire pardon for my fault, or exempt my self from blame, if
you should have a nay-say from me, to whom you have hitherto wholly devoted
your self, and whom you have always assisted with your means and advice.

3. But when I see their credit is most in danger, who expose and let fly
abroad their fooleries, not so much to be read, as to be laughed at, by scholars
at least, and such men as you are; I being deterred with the guilt of my own
weakness, dare not expose my toys to the judgment of such a man.

4. For if I should write (I am sure) my barbarisms would make you laugh, and
perhaps would cause you not to love me.

5. Wherefore I desire you would not deny to pardon me at my entreaty.

6. Farewell, most excellent scholar.

A Distich.
I wish you so much wealth, silver, and gold,
As apples in an Orchard may be told.
Epist. 9.
1. SInce you are become a new man, and have avoided their company, who are not
ashamed, like beasts, to give themselves to lust and pleasure, you have raised
up your fame so in every place, that all men talk of you in the streets and
highways, and almost make a god of you.

2. But if you go on as you have begun, I am certain your friends will be so
glad thereof, that they will not flinch one jot from commending you.

3. Your father (I will feign nothing) was so pleased at that matter, that now
he seems to be wholly for you, and neglecting his other children which he
has, to have sworn to do you good.

4. Wherefore, in my judgment, you shall do wisely to follow virtue.

5. Farewell, and be guided by one that advises you well.

Epist. 10.
1. YOu thought, as I suppose, to affright me with your words, when you was
angry of late, and vented what came nex^ to your mind.

2. I am not one that fears flashes of lightning from a glass, and whom
foolish and outrageous threatenings, such as you then made a noise withal,
affright.

3. Your railing speeches do me no hurt.

4 Yet if you ^ex me with your babbling which you always use, I will make you
repeat of your folly: for else I should take upon me the blame of some injury
which I had done you; whereas for all that, I have hitherto always looked after
your matters, as if they had been mine own. Farewell.

Epist. 11.
1. I Know not how distastefull the proud and impudent arrogance of so^e m^n
has been to me, especially of those, who when they have (...) from a mean and
poor condition to a wealthy estate, grow so v^^y proud, and forget their former
poverty, that they r^sp^^t ^o men more than themselves.

2. With which (...), because you are very much troubled, I had a mind to ^y,
whether I could with any Hellebore (as it were) purg^ (...) contagious madness
of your brain.

3 Who I w^h you would a little more strictly examine the meanness of your
stock, and remember how often your father has begged an a^^s from (...) to
^ore, and from house to house.

4. You had not so much as an halfpenny to buy a halter with, the day before
you came hither.

5. You were as naked as ever you were born.

6. If fortune has dallied more kindly with you, and given you (as they say)
both teats to suck, ought you therefore to take so much upon your self, and
grow so proud, as to show your peacock's plume, or your lion's skin?

7. If you ascribe those riches more to your own virtue, than the chance of
fortune, you are utterly mistaken; for if fortune should dispense and bestow
wealth according to men's deserts, certainly many should go a begging, and be
starved for want of meat, who have goods in abundance: On the contrary, many,
to whom the same fortune plays the step-dame, should grow rich, and be
over-loaded with money.

8. Wherefore know your self, and remember your pedigree, which is less known
than the head of Nilus. Farewell.

Epist. 12.
1. I Do not cease to burden you with Letters almost every day, and to exhort
you, that you would refrain your self from words which are grown ancient, and
out of use.

2. Yet for all that, as often as you write, your whole speech is so full of
obsolete words, that I am fain to guess, for the most part, what they mean.

3. I know not whether you think that kind of unusual speech to be pleasing to
any body; yet know, that it so much displeases me, as Cicero is pleasing to
scholars.

4. I should much more value common and ordinary words, than those old ones,
which neither afford benefit to your self, nor delight to them that are learned.

5. And therefore (if you love me) do as Phavorinus would have you, who
advises you, that we should use the words of the present times, and live after
the old fashion. Farewell.

Epist. 13.
1. SOme told me of late, that you were grown so impudent, that now you do not
blush to keep company with ruffians, and most dissolute wasters of what their
parents left them, who spend and waste all in riotous fare.

2. Which when I first heard, I could not forbear weeping, I so far pitied
your undoing.

3. But what should I say of your father? I should hardly be believed, if I
should express in words, how he tormented and vexed himself.

4. I wonder you are not ashamed of your savagenesse, who so afflictest that
decrepit man, so near his grave, and already (as they say) one of Proser^ina's
cattle; who never seemed in the least to forbear to love you.

5. You may do as you please, yet you shall never avoid lashing speeches, and
the virulent strokes of toungs, till you behave your self again like an honest
man. Farewell.

Epist. 14.
1. IF they that breed their own misery, and strike the chipax against their
own shins, fall into any danger, there is no reason why they should be angry
with any man, or spit out the venom of their bitterness against others than
themselves.

2. You, after you had given your self to lust and gluttony, and had abandoned
all virtues from you, though your friends cried out against you in vain, are at
last brought to such misery, that you know not which way to turn you, nor whom
to implore.

3. I pray you, who is in the fault? Did we not all strive to tell you, that
this very thing would befall you?

4. You slighted and scoffed at our words.

5. Now if for your own sake alone you suffer a misfortune, you must take it
patiently. Farewell.

Epist. 15.
1. I Wonder exceedingly, that since you are grown older, you are never a jot
wiser, than when you talked gibberish in your childhood.

2. There is no man so far out of his wits, that does not repent him of his
solly at the last.

3. But you are neither grieved nor ashamed, even now when all your things go
to wrack, and every one jeereth you, scoffeth at you behind your back, because
you have not yet left your boyish sports.

4. Tell me, I pray you, what reckoning you will make to your parents for your
faults, unless you get out of this darkness of ignorance?

5. It was the utmost of my desires always to do you a good turn, and to use
all means to prefer you.

6. Do you think it an idle piece of service to obey them, that are busied
about your good?

7. Hitherto I have advised you, with as great good will as I could.

8. But except your mind soften at such fair words, I will change them straight
into chiding terms, and (as folks use to say) I will set you out in your own
colors.

Epist. 16.
1. I Know not wherein you offend your father; yet some four days ago, when he
read your Letter, and I was by, me-thought-he frowned.

2. For it is likely he either found some barbarism, or had some other trial
of your ignorance.

3. Endeavor, I pray you, that you may keep in his love, and take away his
anger.

4. Which you shall easily do, if he may see you have benefited in learning.

5. I told you these things long ago softly, and in your ear; I tell you again,
that you may not hereafter hope to be excused.

6. You ought to mind how much he has loved you hitherto, for as much as he
has let you want nothing at any time.

7. Unless you do as I advise you, I see it is like to go very ill with you;
for besides the scorn that will be cast upon you, all your friends will forsake
you; which if it come to pass, how will you do to live, when no body will lend
you a hand? Farewell.

Epist. 17.
1. I Am going abroad, I know not when I shall come again; yet I will return as
soon as possibly I can.

2. I commit my household affairs to you.

3. You shall win my favor, if, whilst I am absent, all things be carried on
without noise, and without any hurly-burly.

4. See you live so, as my children may see nothing in you that is worthy to be
blamed.

5. For they can scoff prettily, and they take nearer notice of those things
which are worse.

6. If you be apt to commit any lewdness, they will remember it, and will not
be able to respect you, whom they know to be liable to any fault.

7. But if they perceive your life to be blameless, they will not only be
obedient to your commands, but also be afraid of your very look. Farewell.

Epist. 18.
1. I Have a very pretty boy, and one that is very witty; whom, because he
gives us great hopes that he will make a good man, I am resolved to make a
scholar, and to commit him first to your teaching.

2. If he shall benefit any whit under you, I will see that you may not repent
you of your pains.

3. If he shall chance to offer you any thing, I would not have you take a
farthing, or above so much, in gifts.

4. I will abundantly content you, and with a large overplus for your labor,
if you but make him such a one, as he may once do something which may make all
his friends memories immortal.

5. Which he will do, if you have such a desire to teach him as he has to
learn. Farewell.

Epist. 19.
1. I Know not how I always come to pity other men's miseries; yet as often as
my friends sustain any harm, or suffer any misfortune, their loss no less
troubles me, than if I my self had made shipwreck, or saw my own business to
go to wrack.

2. Therefore when I see your credit to be endangered every day, I must needs
(to satisfy my grief, and ease my mind) put an helping hand to your affairs.

3. We are all very much troubled that you keep company with some knaves, and
such as are known to be basely given, who neither fear God nor reverence men.

4. Who if they intoxicate you any longer with their corrupt manners, you will
presently leave us no hope of ridding you from them, and your credit will be
past recovery.

5. But if you quickly get your self out of their inveglements, we may yet be
able to cure your disease.

6. And though your former behavior has angered your father, yet whether he
will or no we will wrest pardon from him, so that you forbear to tarry any
longer amongst them, and not fail my expectation.

7. It shall not be long of me that you do not come into your parents favor
again.

8. God grant, that this persuasion of mine may leave some impression in your
mind. Farewell, and remember my words.

Epist. 20.
1. I Love you more (my most sweet Cornelius) than any man can suppose; and I
pray not so often for any thing, as that fortune may always do as you would
have her, and that you may have all things according to your own hearts desire:
and if I kn^w you wanted my help, I would fit my self to serve your occasions,
so far as my conscience would give me leave.

2. Yet when I remember that gray headed and decrepit father of yours, whom you
forsook most basely, not without blame, and many men's privy scoff, I cannot
forbear but be angry with your ingratitude, or (that I may say more truly) with
your undutifulnesse.

3. For what ought to be said to be more inhuman, than if a son hardly look
upon his father shaking for age, and troubled with diseases; much less if he
do not help him: forasmuch as this very thing is hateful to brutes that want
reason, and small living creatures.

4. The Storks nourish their dams in their old age again, as they did them.

5. The Dor-mice maintain their sires, disabled with old age, with notable
dutifulness.

6. But why do I praefer these testimonies before domestic examples; and such
as we have in our own houses?

7. The very dogs oft-times defend them that brought them up with their own
death; of whom for all that they get nothing but a poor alms, to wit, little
scraps of bread, and that made of barley too.

8. And yet you are not troubled, that your nature seems worse than brutes.

9. Who would not curse this? who could forbear invective speeches?

10. Your father languisheth daily; he is troubled with a disease every hour,
and is (as they say) more aguish than the very goats: neither for all this do
you offer to help him being ready to die.

11. O strange! how is honesty now banished! how are good manners gone to
wrack, when children now do not pity their parents!

12. Tell me in good earnest, if now you have wherewithal to feast it
daintily, if you have plenty of all things, to whom is it fit for you to be
thankful for these things, but your father, to whom, whether are you beholding
for your life or not?

13. You impudent fellow, do you not think what men talk of you in every town?
what a fault it is imputed to you, when you go with a sleek and pampered skin,
and well-fed body, with your belly standing out, whilst your father is
half-dead?

14. Hortensius the Orator bewailed a dead Lamprey many days together, going in
mourning; and will not you pity your dying father?

15. O bad times! O wretched age! But whether I will or no I must hold my
tongue.

16. For my grief of mind does not suffer me to say any more.

17. It only remains, that you wax wiser, or else take it not ill that I
forbear to love you. Farewell.

The End.

3. Cujus tibi negotia, quae sunt in Africa, ita commendo, ut majore studio,
mag^sve ex a^^mo, commendare non possim.

20. D. Brutus Imp. M. T. C. S. P. D. Fam. 11.4^

1. SI de tua in me voluntate dubitarem multis a te verbis peterem, ut
dignitatem meam tuerere; sed profecto est ita ut mihi persuasi, me tibi esse
curae.

2. Progressus sum ad Transalpinos cum exercitu, non tam nomen captans
Imperatorium, quam cupiens militibus satisfacere, firmosque eos ad tuendas
nostras res efficere; quod mihi videor consecutus, nam and liberalitatem
nostram and animum sunt experti.

3. Cum omnium bellicosissimis bellum gessi, multa castella cepi, multa vastavi.

4. Non sine causa ad Senatum literas misi.

5. Adjuva nos tua sententia, quod cum facies, ex magna part communi commodo
inservieris. Vale.

21. M. T. C. Servio Sulpitio S. P. D. Fam. 13.20.

1. ASclapone Patrensi medico utor valde familiariter, ejusque tum consuetudo
mihi jucunda fuit, tum etiam ars, quam sum expertus in valetudine meorum; in
qua mihi tum ipsa sententia, tum etiam fidelitate, benevolentiaque satisfecit.

2. Hunc igitur tibi commendo, and a te peto, ut des operam, ut intelligat
diligenter me scripsisse de se, meamque commendationem usui magno sibi fuisse.

3. Erit id mihi vehementer gratum. Vale.

22. M. T. C. Appio S. P. D. Fam. 10.9.

1. DE meo studio erga salutem and incolumitatem tuam, credo te cognoscere ex
literis tuorum, quibus me cumulatissime satisfecisse certo scio; nec iis
concedo, quanquam sunt singulari in te benevolentia, ut te salvum malint, quam
ego.

2. Illi mihi necesse est concedant, ut tibi plus quam ipsi, hoc tempore,
prodesse possim; quod quidem nec destiti facere, nec desistam; and jam in
maxima re feci, and fundamenta jeci salutis tuae.

3. Tu fac bono animo magnoque sis, meque tibi nulla re defaturum esse confidas.

4. Pridie Nonas Quintiles. Vale.

23. M. T. C. Mario S. P. D. Fam. 7.4.

1. AD VIII Kal. Julias in Cumanum veni cum Libone tuo, vel nostro potius; in
Pompeianum statim cogito; sed faciam te ante certiorem.

2. Te cum semper valere cupio, tum certe dum hic sumus.

3. Quare si quid constitutum cum podagra habes, fac in alium diem differas.

4. Cura igitur ut valeas, and me hoc biduo aut triduo expecta. Vale.

24. Cicero Planco Imper. Cons. Des. S. P. D. Fam. 10.14.

1. O Gratam famam biduo ante victoriam de subsidio tuo, de celeritate, de
copiis atque etiam de hostibus fusis! Spes omnis in te est.

2. Fugisse enim ex praelio Mutinensi dicuntur notissimi lat ronum duces.

3. Est autem non minus gratum extrema delere, quam prima depellere.

4. Equidem expectabam jam tuas literas, idque cum multis.

5. Sperabamque etiam Lepidum temporibus admonitum, tibi and Reipub. satis esse
facturum.

6. In illam igitur curam incumbe, mi Plance, ut nequa scintilla teterrimi
belli relinquatur.

7. Quod si erit factum, and Rem^ub. divino beneficio affeceris, and ipse
aeternam gloriam consequere.

8. Tertio Idus Maii. Vale.

25. M. Cic. Papirio Praeto S. P. D. Fam. 9.23.

1. HEri veni in Cumanum, cras ad te fortasse.

2. Sed cum certum sciam, faciam te paulo ante certiorem.

3. Etsi Marcus Ceparius, cum mihi in sylva gallinaria obviam venisset,
quaesissemque quid ageres, dixit te in lecto esse, quod ex pedibus laborares;
tuli scilicet moleste, ut debui: sed tamen constitui ad te venire, ut and
viderem te, and viferem, and caenarem etiam.

4. Non enim arbitror, coquum etiam te arthriticum habere.

5. Expecta igitur hospitem cum minime edacem, tum inimicum coenis sumptuosis.
Vale.

26. M. Cicero S. D. Cn. Plancio. Fam. 4.15.

1. ACcepi perbreves tuas literas, quibus id quod scire cupiebam, cognoscere
non potui: cognovi autem id, quod mihi dubium non fuit.

2. Nam, quam fortiter ferres communes miserias, non intellexi; quam me amares,
facile perspexi: sed hoc sciebam; illud si scissem, ad id meas literas
accommodassem.

3. Sed tamen ersi antea scripsi, quae existimavi scribi oportere, tamen hoc
tempore breviter te commonendum pu^avi, ne quo periculo te proprio existimares
esse: in magno omnes, sed tamen in communi sumus.

4. Quare non debes, aut propriam fortunam, aut praecipuam postulare, aut
communem recusare.

5. Quapropter eo animo simus inter nos, quo semper faimus.

6 Quod de te sperare, de me praestare poss^m. Vale.

27. Cicero Dolab. S. D. Fam. 9.12.

1. GRatulor Baiis nostris, si quidem, ut scribis, salubres repent factae
sunt; nisi forte te amant, and tibi assentantur, and tamdiu, dum tu ades, sunt
oblitae sui.

2. Quod quidem si ita est, minime miror coelum etiam and terras vim suam, si
tibi ita conveniat, dimittere.

3. Oratiunculam pro Deiotaro q^am requirebas, habebam mecum; quod non putaram.

4. Itaque eam tibi misi, quam velim sic legas, ut causam tenuem and inopem,
nec scriptione magnopere dignam. Sed ego hospiti veteri and amico munusculum
mittere volui levidense, crasso filo; cujusmodi ipsius solent esse munera.

5. Tu velim animo sapienti fortique sis, ut tua moderatio and gravitas aliorum
infamet injuriam. Vale.

28. M. T. C. Imperatori Caelio Aedili Curuli S. P. D. Fam. 2.14.

1. MArco Fabio, viro optimo and homine doctissimo, familiarissime utor;
mirificcque eum diligo, cum propter summum ejus ingenium, summamque doctrinam,
tum propter singularem modestiam.

2. Ejus negotium sic velim suscipias, ac si esset res me^.

3. Novi ego vos magnos patronos.

4. Hominem occidere oportet, qui vestra opera uti velit: sed in hoc homine
nullam accipio excusationem.

5. Omnia relinques, si me amabis, cum tua opera Fabi^s uti volet.

6. Ego res Romanas vehementer expecto and desidero, imprimisque quid agas
scire cupio.

7. Nam jamdiu propter hyemis magnitudinem nihil novi ad nos afferebatur. Vale.

29. Cicero Trebatio S. P. D. Fam. 7.22.

1. ILluseras heri inter scyphos, quod dixeram controversiam ^sse, Possetne
haeres, quod furtum antea factum esset, recte furti agere.

2. Itaque et si domum been potus, seroque redieram; tamen id ^aput ubi haec
controversia est, notavi, and descriptum tibi misi; ut scires, id, quod tu
neminem sensisle dicebas, Sext. Aelium, M. Manilium, M. Brutum sensisse.

3. Ego tamen Scaevolae and Testae assentior. Vale.

30. M. T. C. D. Bruto Imper. S. P. D. Fam. 11.15.

1. ETsi mihi tuae literae jucundissimae sunt, tamen jucundius fuit, quod in
summ^ occupatione tua Planco Collegae mandasti, ut te mihi per literas
excusaret; quod fecit ille diligenter: mihi autem nihil amabilius officio t^o,
and diligenti^

2. Conjunctio tua cum Collega, concordiaque vestra, quae literis communibus
decla^ata est, S. P. Q. R. gratissima accidit.

3. Quod superest, perge, mi Brute; and jam non cum aliis, sed tecum ipse certa.

4. Plura scribere non debeo, praesertim ad te, quo magistro brevitatis uti
cogito.

5. Literas tuas vehementer expecto, and quidem tales, quales maxim opto. Vale.

31. M. Cicero T. Furfano Praetori S. D. Fam. 6.9.

1. CUm A. Caecinna tanta mihi familiaritas consuetudoque semper fuit, ut nulla
major esse possit: nam and patre ejus, claro homine and forti viro, plurimum
usi sumus; and hunc a puero, (quod and spem mihi magnam afferebat probitatis
summaeque eloquentiae, and vivebat mecum conjunctissime, non solum officiis
amicitiae, sed etiam studiis communibus,) sic semper dilexi, ut non ullo cum
homine conjunctius viverem.

2. Nihil attinet me plura scribere: Quam mihi necesse sit ejus salutem and
fortunas, quibuscunque rebus possim, tueri, vides.

3. Reliquum est, ut cum cognorim, pluribus rebus, quid tu, and de bonorum
fortuna, and de Reipublicae calamitatibus sentires, nihil a te petam, nisi ut
ad eam voluntatem, quam tua sponte erga Caecinnam habiturus esses, tantus
cumulus accedat commendatione mea, quanti me a te fieri intelligo.

4. Hoc mihi gratius facere nihil potes. Vale.

32. M. C. Cornificio Collegae S. Fam. 12.20.

1. GRatae mihi tuae literae, nisi quod Sinuessanum diversoriolum contempsisti;
quam quidem contumeliam villa pusilla iniquo animo feret, nisi in Cumano and
Pompeiano reddideris (...).

2. Sic igitur facies, meque amabis, and scripto aliquo lacesses.

3. Ego enim respondere facilius possum, quam provocare.

4. Quod si, ut es, cessabis, lacessam; ne tua inertia etiam ignaviam afferat.

5. Plura otiosus.

6. Haec cum essem in Senatu, exaravi. Vale.

33. M. T. C. Cornificio S. P. D, Fam. 12.21.

1. Caius Anitius familiaris meus, vir omnibus rebus ornatus, negotiorum
suorunt causa legatus est in Africam, legatione libera; eum velim rebus omnibus
adjuves, operamque des, ut quam commodissime sua negotia conficiat.

2. Imprimisque, quod ei charissimum est, dignitatem ejus tibi commendo.

3. Idque a te peto, quod ipse in provincia facere sum solitus non rogatus, ut
omnibus Senatoribus Lictores darem; quod idem acceperam, and cognoveram a
summis viris factitatum.

4. Hoc igitur, mi Cornifici, facies, caeterisque rebus omnibus ejus dignitati,
reique (si me amas) consules.

5. Id erit mihi gratissimum.

6. Da operam ut valeas.

34 M. T. C. Cassio S. P. D. Fam. 12.9.

BRevitas tuarum literarum me quoque breviorem in scribendo facit: and, vere ut
dicam, non satis occurrit quid scribam.

2. Nostras enim res in actis perferri ad te certo scio, tuas autem ignoramus.

3. Tanquam enim clausa sit Asia, sic nihil perfertur ad nus, praeter rumores
de oppresso Dolabella; satis illos quidem constantes, sed adhuc sine autore.

4. Nos confectum bellum cum putaremus, repent a Lepido tuo in summam
solicitudinem adducti sumus.

5. Itaque persuade tibi, maximam Reipublicae spem in te and in tuis copiis
esse.

6. Firmos omnino exercitus habemus; sed tamen ut omnia (ut spero) prospere
procedant, multum interest te venire.

7. Exigua enim est spes Reipublicae; nam nullam non libet dicere: sed
quaecunque est, ea despondetur anno consulatus tui. Vale.

35. M. T. C. Atilio S. P. D. Fam. 13.30.

1. Lucius Manlius est Sosis: is fuit Catinensis: sed est una cum reliquis
Neapolitanis civis Romanus factus, ^ecurioque Neapoli.

2. Erat enim adscriptus in id municipium, ante civitatem Sociis and Latinis
datam.

3. Ejus frater Catinae nuper mortuus est; nullam omnino arbitramur de ea
haereditate controversiam eum habiturum: and est hodie in bonis.

4. Sed, quando habet praeterea negotia vetera in Sicilia sua, and hanc
haereditatem fraternam, and omnia ejus tibi commendo; imprimisque Ipsum, virum
optimum mihique familiarissimum, iis studiis literarum doctrinaeque praeditum
quibus ego maxim delector.

5. Peto igitur abs te, ut eum, sive aderit, sive non venerit in Siciliam, in
meis intimis maximeque necessariis scias esse: itaque tractes, ut intelligat
meam commendationem sibi magno adjumento fuisse. Vale.

36. Tul. and Cic. and Q. Q. Tyroni humanissimo and optimo S. P. D. Fam. 16.1.

1 VIde quanta in te sit suavitas. duas horas Thyrei fumus; Xenomanes hospes
tam te diligit, quam si vixerit tecum.

2. Is omnia pollicitus est, quae tibi essent opus: facturum puto.

3. Mihi placebat, si f^^mior esses, ut te Leucadem deportares, ut ibi te plane
confirmares.

4. Videbis, quid Curio, quid Lysoni, quid medico placeat.

5. Volebam ad te Marionem remittere; quem, cum meliu scule tibi esset, ad me
mitteres; sed cogitavi unas literas Marionem afferre posse, me autem crebras
expectare.

6. Poteris igitur, (and facies, si me diligis) ut quotidie sit Acastus in
portu.

7. Multi erunt, quibus recte literas dare possis, qui ad me libenter perferant.

8. Equidem Patras euntem neminem praetermittam.

9. Ego omnem spem tu^ diligenter curandi in Curio habeo; nihil potest illo
fieri humanius, nihil nostri amantius: ei te totum trade: malo te paulo post
valentem, quam statim imbecillem videre.

10. Cura igitur nihil aliud, nisi ut tu valeas; caetera ego curabo.

11. Etiam atque etiam vale.

12. Leucade proficiscens septimo Idus Novembris.

37. M. Cicero pater and fill. Tyroni S. P. D. Fam. 16.7.

1. TErtiam ad te hanc Epistolam scripsi eadem die, magis instituti mei tenendi
causa, quam quod haberem quid scriberem.

2. Igitur illa, quantum me diligis, tantum adhibe in re diligentiae.

3. Ad tua innumerabilia in me officia add hoc; quod mihi erit gratissimum
omnium: cum valetudinis rationem, ut spero habueris, habeto etiam navigationis.

4. In Italiam euntibus ad me literas dabis, ut ego cuntem Patras neminem
praetermitto.

5. Cura, cura te, mi Tyro: quando non contigit ut simul navigares, nihil est
quod festines; nec quicquam cures, nisi ut valeas.

6. Etiam atque etiam vale.

7. Septimo Idus Novembris, Actio, vesperi.

38. M. T. Cicero Tyroni S. P. D. Fam. 16.12.

1. EGo vero cupio te ad me venire, sed viam timeo; gravissime aegrotasti,
inedi^ and purgationibus and vi ipsius morbi consumptus es.

2 Graves solent offensiones esse ex gravibus morbis, siqua culpa commissa est.

3. Jam ad id biduum, quod fueris in via, dum in Cumanum venis, accedent
continuo ad reditum dies quinque.

4. Ego in Formiano ad tertium Calendarum esse volo.

5. Ibi te ut firmum offendam, mi Tyro, effice.

6. Literulae meae (sive nostrae) tui desiderio oblanguerunt; hac tamen
Epistola, quam Acastus attulit, oculos paulum sustulerunt.

7. Pompeius erat apud me, cum haec scribebam; hilare and libenter ei cupienti
audire nostra, dixi, sinc te omnia mea muta esse.

8. Tu Musis nostris para ut operas reddas, nostra ad diem dictum fient: docui
enim te, fides (...) quod haberet.

9. Fac plane ut valeas, nos adsumus.

10. Vale. Decimo quarto Calendarum Januarii.

39. M. T. Cicero Curioni S. P. D. Fam. 2.4.

1. EPistolarum genera multa esse non ignoras: sed unum illud certissimum,
cujus causa inventa res ipsa est, ut certiores faceremus absentes, si quid
esset, quod eos scire, aut nostra, aut ipsorum interesset.

2. Hujus generis literas a me profecto non expectas; domesticarum enim rerum
tuarum habes and scriptores and nuncios; in meis autem rebus nihil est sane
novi.

3. Reliqua sunt epistolarum genera duo, quae me magnopere delectant: unum
familiare and jocosum; alterum severum and grave.

4. Utro me minus deceat uti, non intelligo.

5. Jocerne tecum per literas? Civem me-hercule non puto esse, qui temporibus
his ridere possit.

6. An gravius aliquid scribam? Quid est, quod possit graviter* a Cicerone
scribi ad Curionem nisi de Republica?

7. Atque in hoc genere mea causa est, ut, neque ea quae sentio, velim scribere.

8. Quamobrem, quoniam mihi nullum scribendi argumentum relictum est, utar ea
clausula, qua soleo, teque ad studium summae laudis cohortabor.

9. Est enim tibi gravis adversaria constituta and parata, incredibilis quaedam
expectatio; quam tu una re facillim^ vinces, si hoc statueris, Quarum laudum
gloriam admiraris, quibus artibus eae lauds comparantur, in iis esse
laborandum.

10. In hanc sententiam scriberem plura, nisi te tua sponte satis esse
incitatum confiderem; and hoc, quicquid attigi, non feci inflammandi tui causa;
sed testificandi amoris mei. Vale.

40. M. T. Cicero Bruto S. P. D. Fam. 13.40.

1. LUcio Titio Strabone, equite Romano imprimis honesto and ornato,
familiarissime utor; omnia mihi cum eo intercedunt jura summae necessitatis.

2. Huic in tua provincia pecuniam debet Publius Cornelius.

3. Ea res a Volcatio, qui Romae jus dicit, rejecta in Galliam est.

4. Peto a te hoc diligentius quam si mea res esset, (quo est honestius de
amicorum pecunia laborare, quam de sua) ut negotium conficiendum cures, ipse
suscipias, transigas; operamque des, (quod tibi aequum and rectum videbitur) ut
quam commodissima condition libertus Strabonis, qui ejus rei causa missus est,
negotium conficiat, ad nummosque perveniat.

5. Id and mihi gratissimum erit, and tu ipse L. Titium cognosces amicitia tua
dignissimum.

6. Quod ut tibi curae sit (ut omnia solent esse, quae me velle scis) te
vehementer etiam atque etiam rogo. Vale.

41. M. T. Cicero S. D. T. Fabio. Fam. 5.18.

1. ET si egomet qui te consolari cupio, consolandus ipse sum, propterea quod
nullam rem graviu^ jam diu tuli, quam incommodum tuum; tamen te magnopere non
hortor solum, sed etiam pro amore nostro rogo atque oro, te colligas, virumque
praebeas, and qua condition omnes homines, and quibus temporibus nati sumus,
cogites.

2. Plus tibi virtus tua dedit, quam fortuna abstulit; propterea quod adeptus
es, quod non multi homines novi; amisisti quod plurimi homines Nobilissimi.

3. Ea denique videtur conditio impendere legum, judiciorum, temporum, ut
optime actum cum eo videatur esse, qui quam levissima poena ab hac Republica
discesserit.

4. Tu vero, qui and fortunas and liberos habeas, and nos caeterosq^e
necessitudine and benevolentia tecum conjunctissimos; quique magnam facultatem
sis habiturus nobiscum, and cum omnibus tuis vivendi; and cum unum sit judicium
ex tam multis quod reprehendatur, ut quod una sententia, eaque dubia, potentiae
alicujus condonatum existimetur; Omnibus his de causis, debes istam molestiam
quam levissime far.

5. Meus animus erit in te, liberosque tuos semper, quem esse vis, and qui esse
debet. Vale.

42. M. T. Cicero Trebatio. S. D. Fam. 6.11.

1. DOlobellam antea tantummodo diligebam; obligatus ei nihil eram, nec enim
acciderat mihi opus esse; and ille mihi debebat, quod non defeceram ejus
periculis.

2. Nunc tanto sum devinctus ejus beneficio, quod and antea in re, and hoc
tempore in salute tua, cumulatissime mihi satisfecit, ut nemini plus debeam.

3. Qua in re tibi gratulor, ita vehementer, ut te quoque mihi gratulari, quam
gratias agere malim.

4. Alterum non omnino desidero, alterum vero facere poteris.

5 Quod reliquum est, quando tibi virtus, and dignitas tua reditum ad tuos
aperuit; est tuae sapientiae, magnitudinisque animi, quid amiseris, oblivisci;
quid recuperaveris, cogitare.

6. Vives cum tuis, vives nobiscum: plus acquisivisti dignitatis, quam amisisti
rei familiaris, quae ipsi tum esset jucundior, si ulla Res esset publica.

7. Vestorius noster familiaris ad me scripsit, te mihi maximas gratias agere.

8. Haec praedicatio tua mihi valde grata est; eaque te uti facile patior, cum
apud alios, tum mehercule apud Syronem nostrum amicum.

9. Quae enim facimus, ea prudentissimo cuique maxim probata esse volumus.

10. Te cupio videre quamprimum. Vale.

43. Cicero Trebatio S. Fam. 7.14.

1 CHrysippus Vectius, Cyri Architecti libertus fecit, ut te non immemorem
putarem mei; salutem enim mihi tuis verbis nunciavit.

2. Valde jam lautus es, qui graveris literas ad me dare, homini praesertim
prope domestico.

3. Quod si scribere oblitus es, minus multi, te advocato, causa cadent.

4. Sin nostri oblitus es, dabo operam, ut istuc v^niam, antequam plane ex
animo tuo effluam.

5. Sin aestivorum timor te debilitat, aliquid excogita ut fecisti de Britannia.

6. Illud quidem perlibenter audivi ex eodem Chrysippo, te esse Caesari
familiarem; sed mehercule mallem, id quod erat aequius, de tuis rebus ex tuis
literis, quam saepissime cognoscere; q^od certe ita fieret, si tu maluisses
benevolentiae, quam litium jura perdiscere.

7. Sed haec jocati sumus, and tuo more, and nonnihil etiam nostro.

8. Te valde amamus, nosque a te amari tum volumus, tum etiam con^idimus. Vale.

44. M. T. Cicero M. Lepido S. P. D. Fam. 10* 27.

1. QUod mihi, pro summa erga te benevolentia, magnae curae est, ut quam
amplissima dignitate sis; moleste tuli, te Senatui gratias non egisse, cum
esses ab eo Ordine ornatus summis honoribus.

2. Pacis inter cives conciliandae te cupidum esse laetor.

3. Pacem eam si a servitute sejungis, consules and Reipublicae, and dignitati
tuae: sin ista pax perditum hominem in possessionem impotentissimi dominatus
restitutura est, hoc animo scito esse omnes sanos, ut mortem servituti
anteponant.

4. Itaque sapientius, meo quidem judicio, facies, si te in istam
pacificationem non interpones, quae neque Senatui, neque populo, neque cuiquam
bono probatur.

5. Sed haec audies ex aliis, aut certior fies literis.

6. Tu, pro tua prudentia, quid optimum factu sit, videbis. Vale.

45. M. Cicero Cn. Planco Imperat. Fam. 10.2.
Cons. Des. S. D.
1. MEum studium honori tuo pro necessitudine nostra non defuisset, si aut cito
in Senatum, aut honest venire potuissem.

2. Sed nec sine periculo quisquam libere de Republica sentiens, versari potest
in summa impunitate gladiatorum; nec nostrae dignitatis videtur esse, ibi
sententiam de Republica dicere, ubi me and melius and propius audient armati,
quam Senatores.

3. Quapropter in privatis rebus nullum neque officium, neque studium meum
desiderabis; nec in publicis quidem, si quid erit in quo interesse necesse sit,
unquam decro, ne cum periculo meo, dignitati tuae.

4. In his autem rebus, quae nihilominus, ego ut absim, confici possunt, peto a
te, ut me rationem habere velis and salutis and dignitatis meae. Vale.

46. M. T. C. Papirio Paeto S. D. Fam. 9.19.

1. TAmen a malitia non discedis; tenuiculo apparatu significas Balbum fuisse
contentum.

2. Hoc vide^is dicere, Cum reges tam sint continentes, multo magis consulares
esse oportere.

3. Nescis me ab illo omnia expiscatum: recta enim a porta domum meam venisse:
neque hoc admiror, q^od non ad tuam potius; sed illud, quod nec ad suam.

4. Ego autem tribus primis verbis, Quid noster Paetus? at ille adjurans,
nusquam se unquam libenti^s.

5. Hoc si verbis assequutus es, aures ad te afferam non minus elegantes: sin
autem obsonio, peto a te, ne pluris esse Balbos q^am disertos putes.

6. Me quotidie aliud ex alio impedit.

7. Sed, si me exped^ero ut in ista loca venire possim, non committam ut te
sero a me certiorem factum putes. Vale.

47. C. Tribonius M. T. C. S. P. D. Fam. 12.6.

1. SI vales, been est.

2. Athenas veni ad 11 Calend. Junii; atque ibi, quod maxim optabam, vidi
filium tuum deditum optimis studiis, summa que modestiae fama.

3. Qua ex re quantam voluptatem ceperim, scire potes, etiam me tacente.

4. Non enim nescis, quanti te faciam; and quam, pro nostro veterrimo,
verissimoque amore, omnibus tuis etiam minimis commodis, non modo tanto bono,
gaudeam.

5. Noli putare, mi Cicero, me hoc auribus tuis dare.

6. Nihil adolescente tuo, atque adeo nostro, (nihil enim mihi a te potest esse
sejunctum) aut amabilius omnibus iis qui Athenis sunt, est; aut studiosius
earum artium, quas tu maxim amas, hoc est, optimarum.

7. Itaque tibi, quod vere facere possum, libenter quoque gratulor, nec minus
etiam nobis, quod eum, quem necesse erat diligere, qualiscunque esset, talem
habemus, ut libenter quoque diligamus.

8. Qui cum mihi in sermonem injecisset, se velle Asiam visere, non modo
invitatus, sed etiam rogatus est a me ut id potissimum, nobis obtinentibus
provinciam, faceret.

9. Cui nos and charitate and amore tuum officium praestituros non debes
dubitare.

10. Illud quoque erit nobis curae, ut Cratippus una cum eo sit; ne putes in
Asia feriatum illum ab iis studiis, in quae tua cohortatione inci^atur, futurum.

11. Nam illum paratum, ut video, and ingressum pleno gradu, cohortari non
intermittimus, quo indies longius discendo, exercendoque se, procedat.

12. Vos quid ageretis in Republica, cum has literas dabam, non sciebam.

13. Audiebam quaedam turbulenta, quae scilicet cupio esse falsa, ut aliquando
otiosa liberate fruamur: quod vel minime mihi adhuc contigit.

14. Ego tamen nactus in navigatione nostra pusillum laxamenti, concinnavi tibi
munusculum ex instituto meo; and Dictum, cum magno nostro honor a te dictum,
conclusi, and tibi infra subscripsi.

15. In quibus versiculis, si tibi quibusdam verbis (...) videbor, turpitudo
personae ejus, in quam liberius invehimur, nos vindicabit.

16. Ignosces etiam iracundiae nostrae, quae justa est in ejusmodi homines, and
cives.

17. Deinde, qui magis hoc Lucilio licuerit assumere libertatis, quam nobis?
cum etiamsi odio pari fuerit in eos, quos lae sit; tamen certe non magis dignos
habuerit, in quos tanta liberate verborum incurreret.

18. Tu, sicut mihi pollicitus es, adjunges me quamprimum ad tuos sermones.

19. Namque illud non dubito, quin, si quid de interitu Caesaris scribas, non
patiaris me minimam partem and rei and amoris tui far.

20. Vale, and matrem meosque tibi commendatos habe. VII Calend. Jun. Athenis.

48. Cicero Curio S. P. D. Fam. 7.31.

1. FAcile perspexi ex tuis literis (quod semper studui) and me a te plurimi
fieri, and te intelligere, quam mihi carus esses.

2. Quod quando uterque nostrum consecutus est, reliquum est ut officiis
certemus inter nos, quibus aequo animo vel vincam te, vel vincar abs te.

3. Acilio non fuisse necesse meas dari literas, facile patior.

4. Sulpitii tibi operam intelligo ex tuis literis, non multum opus fuisse,
propter res tuas ita contractas, ut, quemadmodum scribis, nec caput, nec pedes:
equidem vellem uti pedes haberent, ut aliquando redires.

5. Vides enim exaruisse jam veterem urbanitatem, ut Pomponius noster suo jure
possit dicere, nisi nos pauci retineamus gloriam antiquam Atticam; ergo is
tibi, nos ei succedimus.

6. Veni igitur, ne tantum semen urbanitatis, una cum Republica, intereat. Vale.

49. M. T. C. Acilio Procon. S. P. D. Fam. 13.32.

1. IN Alesina civitate, tam lauta quam nobili, conjunctissimos habeo and
hospitio and familiaritate M. and C. Claudios; Archagathum, and Philonem: sed
vereor, ne, quia complures tibi praeci^ commendo, exaequare videar ambitione
quadam commendationes meas; quanquam a te cumulate satisfit and mihi and meis
omnibus.

2. Sed velim sic existimes, hanc familiam, and hos homines mihi maxim esse
conjunctos vestutate, officiis, benevolentia.

3. Quamobrem peto a te majorem in modum, ut his omnibus in rebus, quantum tua
dignitas fidesque patietur, commodes.

4. Id si f^ceris, erit mihi vehementissi ne gratum. Vale.

50. M. T. C. Acilio Proc. S. P. D. Fam. 13.33.

1. CNeio Otacilio Nasone utor familiarissime; ita prorsus, ut illius ordinis
nullo familiarius; nam and humanitate ejus, and probitate, in consuetudine
quotidiana magnopere delector.

2. Nihil jam opus est expectare te, quibus eum verbis tibi commendem, quo sic
utor, ut scripsi.

3. Habet in provincia tua negotia, quae procurant liberti, Hilarious,
Antigonus, Demostratus; quos tibi, negotiaque omnia Nasonis non secus commendo,
ac si mea essent.

4. Gratissimum mihi feceris, si intellexero, hanc commendationem magnum apud
te pondus habuisse. Vale.

51. M. T. C. Acilio Proc. S. P. D. Fam. 13.34.

1. AVitum mihi hospitium est, cum Lysone Lysonis filio Lilybetano, valdeque ab
eo observor, cognovique dignum and patre and avo; est enim nobilissima familia*

2. Quapropter commendo tibi majorem in modum rem domumque ejus, magnoque opere
abs te peto, cures ut intelligat meam commendationem maxim sibi apud te and
adjumento and ornamento fuisse. Vale.

52 M. T. C. Acilio Proc. S. P. D. Fam. 13.35.

1. Caius Avianus Philoxenus, antiquus est hospes meus, and praeter hospitium
valde etiam familiaris, quem Caesar meo beneficio in Novocomenses retulit.

2. Nomen autem Aviani consecutus est, quod homine nullo plus est usus, quam
Flacco Aviano, meo (quemadmodum te scire arbitror) familiarissimo.

3. Quae ego omnia collegi, ut intelligeres non vulgarem esse commendationem
hanc meam.

4. Peto igitur abs te, ut omnibus rebus, quod sine molestia tua facere possis,
ei commodes, habeasque in numero tuorum; perficiasque ut intelligat has literas
meas magno sibi usui fuisse.

5. Erit id mihi majorem in modum gratum. Vale.

53. Cicero Planco Imper. Cons. des. S. P. D. Fam. 1013.

1. UT primum potestas data est mihi augendae dignitatis tuae, nihil
praetermisi in te ornando, quod positum esset aut in praemio virtutis, aut in
honor verborum.

2. Id ex ipso Senatus consulto poteris cognoscere; ita enim est perscriptum,
ut a me de scripto dicta sententia est: quam Senatus frequens sequutus est
summo studio, magnoque consensu.

3. Ego, quanquam ex tuis literis quas mihi misisti, perspexi te magis judicio
bonorum, quam insignibus gloriae delectari; tamen considerandum nobis
existimavi, etiamsi tu nihil postulares, quantum tibi a Republica deberetur.

4. Tu contexes extrema cum primis.

5. Qui enim M. Antonium oppresserit, is bellum confecit.

6. Itaque Homerus non Ajacem, nec Achillem, sed Ulyssem appellavit (...).

54. M. T. C. Cassio S. P. D. Fam. 1^.6.

1. QUi status rerum fuerit, tum cum has literas dedi, scire poteris ex C.
Tidio Strabone, viro bono, and optime de Republica sentiente; nam quid dicam
cupidissimo tui, qui, domo and fortunis relictis, ad te potissimum profectus
sit?

2. Itaque eum tibi ne commendo quidem, adventus ipsius ad te satis eum
commendabit.

3. Tu velim sic existumes, tibique persuadeas, omne perfugium bonorum in te
and Bruto esse positum, si, q^od nolim, adversi quid evenerit.

4. Res enim cum haec scribebam, erat in extremum deducta discrimen.

5. Brutus enim Mutinae vix jam su^tinebat; qui si conservatus erit, vicimus;
sin oppressus ibi erit (quod Dii omen avertant) omnis omnium cursus erit ad vos.

6. Proinde fac tantum animum habeas, tantumque apparatum, quanto opus est ad
universam Rempublicam recuperandam. Vale.

55. M. T. C. Cornificio Collegae S. Fam. 12.17.

1. GRata mihi vehementer est memoria nostri tua, quam significasti literis;
quam ut conserves (non quod de tua constantia dubitem, sed quia mos est ita
rogandi) rogo.

2. Ex Syria nobis tumultuosiora quaedam nunciata sunt, quae, q^ia tibi sunt
propiora quam nobis, tua me causa magis movent, quam mea.

3. Romae summum otium est, sed ita, ut malis salubre aliquod and honestum
negotium: quod spero fore, quia video id curae esse Caesari.

4. Me scito, dum tu absis, quasi occasionem quandam and licentiam nactum,
scribere audacius, and caetera quidem fortasse, quae etiam tu concederes.

5. Sed proxime scripsi de optimo genere dicendi, in quo saepe suspicatus sum
te a judicio nostro, sic scilicet, ut doctum hominem a non indocto, paulum
dissidere.

6. Huic tu libro, maxim velim ex animo; si minus, gratiae causa suffragere.

7. Dicam tuis, ut eum, si velint, describant, ad teque mittant.

8. Puto enim, etiamsi rem minus probabis, tamen in ista solitudine, quicquid a
me profectum sit, jucundum tibi fore.

9. Quod mihi existimationem tuam, dignitatemque tuam commendas, facis tu
quidem omnium more: sed velim sic existimes, me, cum amori, quem inter nos
mutuum esse intelligam, plurimum tribuere, tum de summo ingenio, and de optimis
tuis studiis, and de spe amplissimae dignitatis tuae ita judicare, ut neminem
tibi anteponam, comparem paucis. Vale.

56. M. T. C. Q. Thermo S. P. D. Fam. 13.34.

1. CUm mihi multa grata sunt, quae tu adductus mea commendatione fecisti; tum
primis, quod M. Marcilium amici atque interpretis mei filium liberalissime
tracta visti.

2. Venit enim Laodiceam, and tibi apud me, mihique propter te gratias maximas
egit.

3. Quare, quod reliquum est, a te peto, quando apud gratos homines beneficium
ponis, ut eo libentius his commodes; operamque des, quoad fides tua patitur, ut
socrus adolescentis rea ne fiat.

4. Ego cum antea studiose commendabam Marcilium, tum multo nunc studiosius,
quod in longa apparitione singularem and prope incredibilem patris Marcilii
fidem, abstinentiam, modestiamque cognovi. Vale.

C. Plinii Caecilii Secundi Epistolarum Liber primus.
1. C. Plin. Secundus Septitio s^o S.
1. FRequenter hortatus es, ut epistolas, si quas paulo accuratius scripsissem,
colligerem, publicaremque.

2. Collegi, non servato temporis ordine (neque enim historiam componebam) sed
ut quaeque in manus venerat.

3. Superest ut nec te consilii, nec me poeniteat obsequii.

4. Ita enim fiet, ut eas, quae adhuc neglectae jacent, requiram; and, si quas
addidero, non supprimam. Vale.

2. C. Plinius Arriano suo S.
1. QUia tardiorem adventum tuum prospicio, librum, quem prioribus epistolis
promiseram, exhibeo.

2. Hunc rogo ex consuetudine tua and legas and emendes: eo magis, quod nihil
ante peraeque eodem (...) scripsisse videor; tentavi enim imitari Demosthenem,
semper tuum, Calvum, nuper meum, figuris duntaxat orationis.

3. Nam vim tantorum virorum pauci, q^os aequus amavit Jupiter, assequi possunt.

4. Nec materia ipsa huic (vereor ne improbe dicam) aemulationi repugnavit.

5. Erat enim tota in contentione dicendi, quod me longae desidiae indormientem
excitavit, si modo is sum ego qui excitari possim.

6. Non tamen omnino Marci nostri (...) fugimus, quoti^s paululum itinere
decedere non intempestivis amaenitatibus admonebamur; acres enim esse, non
tristes, volebamus.

7. Nec est quod putes me sub hac exceptione veniam postulare; immo, quo magis
intendam limam tuam, confitebor and ipsum me and contubernales ab editione non
abhorrere; si modo tu fortasse errori nostro calculum adjeceris.

8. Est enim plane aliquid edendum, atque utinam hoc potissimum quod paratum
est, (audis desidiae votum) edendum autem ex pluribus causis.

9. Maxim quod libelli quos emisimus, dicuntur in manibus esse, quamvis jam
gratiam novitatis exuerint; nisi tamen auribus nostris bibliopolae blandiuntur.

10. Sed sane blandiantur, dum per hoc mendacium nobis studia nostra commendent.

3. C. Plinius Caninio suo S.
1. QUid agit Comum, tuae meaeque deliciae? quid suburbanum amoenissimum? quid
illa porti^us verna semper? quid (...) opacissimus? quid Euripus viridis and
gemmeus? quid subjectus and serviens lacus? quid illa mollis, and tamen solida
gestatio? quid balineum illud, quod plurimus Sol implet, and circumit? quid
triclinia illa popularia? quid illa paucorum? quid cubicula diurn^,
nocturnaque? Possidentne te, and per vices partiuntur?

2. An, ut solebas, intention rei familiaris obeundae, crebris excursionibus
avocaris? Si te possident, felix beatusque es: sin minus, unus ex multis.

3. Quin tu (tempus est enim) humiles and sordidas curas aliis mandas; and ipse
te in alto isto pinguique secess^, studiis adseris.

4. Hoc sit negotium tuum, hoc otium; hic labor, haec quies; in his vigilia, in
his etiam somnus reponatur.

5. Effinge aliquid and excude, quod sit perpetuo tuum

6. Nam reliqua rerum tuarum post te alium atque alium dominum sortientur.

7. Hoc nunquam tuum desinet esse, si semel coeperit.

8. Scio quem animum, quod hortor ingenium.

9. Tu modo enitere, ut tibi ipse sis tanti, quanti videberis aliis, si tibi
fueris. Vale.

4. C. Plinius Pompeiae Celerinae socrui S.
1. QUantum copiarum in Ocriculano, in Narniensi, in Carsolano, in Perusino
tuo; in Narniensi vero etiam balineum; ex epistolis meis (nam jam tuis opus non
est) una illa brevis and vetus sufficit.

2. Non mehercule tam mea sunt, quae mea sunt, quam quae tua; hoc tamen
differunt, quod solicitius and intentius tui me, quam mei accipiunt.

3. Idem fortasse eveniet tibi, si quando in nostra diverteris; quod velim
facias: primum ut perinde tu nostris rebus, ac nos tuis perfruaris; deinde, ut
mei expergiscantur aliquando, qui me secure^ ac prope negligenter expectant.

4. Nam mitium dominorum apud servos ipsa consuetudine metus exolescit;
novitatibus excitantur, probarique dominis per alios magis, quam per ipsos
laborant. Vale.

5. C. Plinius Voconio Romano suo S.
1. VIdistine quenquam Marco Regulo timidiorem, humil^oremque post Domitiani
mortem: sub quo non minora flagitia commiserat, quam sub Nerone, sed tectiora?

2. Coepit vereri ne sibi irascerer; nec fallebatur, irascebar.

3. Rustici Aruleni periculum foverat, exultaverat morte; adeo ut librum
recitaret, publicaretque in quo Rusticum insectatur, atque etiam Sto^corum
Simiam appellat.

4. Adjicit, Vitelliana cicatrice stigmosum.

5. Agnoscis eloquentiam Reguli.

6. Lacerat Herennium Senecionem tam intemperanter quidem, ut dixerit e^ Metius
Carus, Quid tibi cum meis mortuis? Nunquid ego aut Crasso aut Camerino molestus
sum? quos ille sub Nerone accusaverat.

7. Haec me Regulus dolenter tulisse credebat; ideoque eiam cum recitaret
librum non adhibuerat.

8. Praeterea reminiscebatur quam capitaliter ipsum me apud Centumviros
lacessisset.

9. Aderam Arrionillae Timonis uxori, rogatu Aruleni Rustici: Regulus contra:
nitebamur nos in part causae sententia Vertii Modesti optimi viri; is tunc in
exilio erat a Domitiano relegatus.

10. Ecce ibi Regulus; Quaero, inquit, Secunde, quid de Modesto sentias.

11. Vides quod periculum, si respondissem, Been: quod flagitium, si, Male.

12. Non possum dicere aliud tunc mihi quam Deos adfuisse.

13. Respondebo, inquam, quid sentiam, si de hoc Centumviri judicaturi sunt.

14. Rursus ille, Quaero quid de Modesto sentias.

15. Iterum ego, Solebant testes in reos, non in damnatos interrogari.

16. Tertio ille, Non jam quid de Modesto, sed quid de pietate Modesti sentias,
quaero.

17. Quaeris, inquam quid sentiam? at ego ne interrogare quidem fas puto de quo
pronunciatum est.

18. Conticuit. Me laus and gratulatio secuta est, quod nec famam meam aliquo
responso (utili fortasse, inhonesto tamen) laeseram, nec me laqueis tam
insidiosae interrogations involveram.

19. Nunc ergo conscientia exterritus apprehendit Caecilium Celerem; mox Fabium
Justum rogat, ut me sibi reconcilient: nec contentus pervenit ad Spurinam.

20. Huic suppliciter (ut est, cum timet, abjectissimus) Rogo, inquit, mane
videas Plinium domi, sed plane mane, (neque enim diutius far solicitudinem
possum) and quoque modo efficias ne mihi irascatur.

21. Evigilaveram.

22. Nuncius Spurina; Veni^ ad te: Immo ego, ad te.

23. Coimus in porticum Liviae: cum alter ad alterum tenderemus, exponit Reguli
mandata: addit preces suas; ut decebat optimum virum pro dissimillimo: Parce,
inquiens.

24. Cui ego, Despicies ipse, quid respondendum Regulo putes; te decipi a me
non oportet.

25. Expecto Mauricum (nondum enim ab exilio venerat) ideo nihil alterutrum in
partem respondere tibi possum, facturus quicquid ille decreverit.

26. Illum enim esse hujus consilii ducem, me comitem decet.

27. Paucos post dies ipse me Regulus convenit in pra^torls officio.

28. Illuc persecutus secretum petit; ait timere se ne animo meo penitus
haereret, q^od in Centumvirali judicio aliquando dixisset, cum responderet mihi
and Satrio Rufo; Satrius Rufus, cui est cum Cicerone aemulatio; and qui
contentus non est eloq^entia seculi nostri.

29. Respondi, nunc me intelligere malign dictum; quia ipse confiteretur;
caeterum potuisse honorificum existimari.

30. Est enim, inquam, mihi cum Cicerone aemulatio: nec sum contentus
eloquentia seculi nostri.

31. Nam stultissimum credo, ad imitandum non optima q^aeque proponere.

32. Sed tu qui hujus judicii meministi, cur illius oblitus es, in quo me
interrogasti, quid de Metii Modesti pietate sentirem.

33. Expalluit notabiliter: quamvis palleat semper.

34. Haesitabundus, Interrogavi, non ut tibi nocerem, sed ut Modesto.

35. Vide hominis crudelitatem: q^i se non dissimulat exuli nocere voluisse.

36. Subjunxit egregiam causam.

37. Scripsit, inq^it, in epistola quadam, quae apud Domitianum recitata est,
Regulus omnium bipedum nequissimus.

38. Quod quidem Modestus verissime scripserat.

39. Hic fere nobis sermonis terminus: neq^e enim volui progredi longius; ut
mihi omnia libera servarem, dum Mauricus venit.

40. Nec me praeterit, esse Regulum (...). Est enim locuples, factiosus,
curatur a multis, timetur a pluribus: quod plerunque fortius amore est.

41. Potest tamen fieri, ut haec concussa labantur: nam gratia malorum tam
infida est, quam ipsi.

42. Verum, ut idem saepius dicam, expecto Mauricum: vir est gravis, prudens,
multis experimentis eruditus, and qui futura possit ex praeteritis providere.

43. Mihi and tentandi aliquid and quiescendi, illo authore, ratio constabit.

44. Haec tibi scripsi; quia aequum erat, te pro amore mutuo, non solum omnia
mea facta and dicta, verum etiam consilia cognoscere. Vale.

6. C, Plinius Cornelio Tacito suo S.
1. RIdebis, and licet rideas.

2. Ego, Plinius ille quem nosti, Apros tres, and quidem pulcherrimos, cepi.

3. Ipse, inquis? Ipse: non tamen, ut omnino ab inertia mea, and quie te
discederem.

4. Ad retia sedebam.

5. Erant in proximo non venabulum, aut lancea, s^d stylus and pugillares.

6. Meditabar aliquid, enotabamque; ut, si manus vacuas, plenas tamen ceras,
reportarem.

7. Non est, quod contemnas hoc studendi genus.

8. Mirum est, ut animus hac agitatione, motuque corporis, excitetur.

9. Jam, undiquesylvae, and solitudo, ipsumque illud silentium, quod venationi
datur, magna cogitationis incitamenta sunt.

10. Proinde, cum venabere, licebit, authore me, ut panarium and lagunculam,
sic etiam pugillares feras.

11. Experietis non Dianam magis montibus quam Minervam inerrare. Vale.

7. C. Plinius Octavio Rufo suo S.
1. Vde, in quo me fastigio collocaris, cum mihi idem potestatis, idemque regni
dederis, quod Hom. Jovi Opt. Max. (...). Nam ego quoque simili nutu, ac renutu,
respondere voto tuo possum.

2. Etenim sicut fas est mihi, praesertim te exigente, excusare Baeticis contra
unum hominem advocationem; ita nec fidei nostrae, nec constantiae, quam
diligis, convenit adesse contra provinciam, q^am tot officiis, tot laboribus,
tot etiam periculis meis aliquando devinxerim.

3. Tenebo ergo hoc temperamentum, ut ex duobus, quorum alterutrum petii,
eligam id potius, in quo non solum studio tuo, verum etiam judicio satisfaciam.

4. N^que enim tantopere mihi considerandum est, quid vir optimus in praesentia
velis, quam quid semper sis probaturus.

5. Me circa Idus Octobreis spero Romae futurum: eademque haec praesentem
quoque tua meaque fide Gallo confirmaturum; cui tamen jam nunc licet spondeas
de animo meo. -- (...).


6. Cur enim non usquequaque Homericis versibus agam tecum? quatenus tu me tuis
agere non pateris* quorum tanta cupiditate ardeo, ut videar mihi hac sola
mercede posse cortumpi, ut vel contra Baeticos ad sim.

7. Pene praeterii, quod minime praetereundum fuit, accepisse me cariotas
optimas, quae nunc cum ficis and boletis certamen habent. Vale.

8. C. Plinius Pompeio Saturnino suo S.
1. PE^opportune mihi redditae sunt literae tuae, quibus flagitabas ut tibi
aliquid ex scriptis meis mitter^^^, cum ego id ipsum destinassem.

2. Addidisti ergo calcaria sponte currenti, pariterque and tibi veniam
recusandi laboris, and mihi exigendi verecundiam sustulisti: nam nec me timide
uti decet eo quod oblatum est, nec te gravari quod depoposcisti.

3. Non est tamen quod ab homine desidioso aliquid novi operis expectes:
petiturus sum enim, ut rursus vaces sermoni, quem apud municipes meos habui,
Bibliothecam dedicaturus.

4. Memini quidem te jam quaedam adnotasse, sed generaliter; ideo nunc rogo, ut
non tantum universitati ejus attendas, verum etiam particulas qua soles lima
persequaris; erit enim and post emendationem liberum nobis, vel publicare, vel
continere.

5. Quinimo fortasse hanc ipsam cunctationem nostram in alterutram sententiam
emendationis ratio deducet: quae aut indignum editione, dum saepi^s retractar,
inveniet; aut dignum, dum id ipsum experitur, efficiet: q^anq^am hujus
cunctationis meae causae non tam in scriptis, quam in ipso materiae genere,
consistunt.

6. Est enim paulo quasi gloriosius and elatius: onerabit hoc modestiam
nostram, etiamsi stylus ipse fuerit pressus demissusque, propterea quod
cogimur, cum de munificentia parentum nostrorum, tum de nostra, disputare.

7. Anceps hic and lubricus locus est, etiam cum illi necessitas lenocinetur.

8. Etenim si alienae quoque lauds parum aequis auribus accipi solent, quam
difficile est obtinere, ne molesta videatur oration de se aut de suis
disserentis?

9. Nam cum ipsi honestati, tum aliquanto magis gloriae ejus praedicationique
invidemus; atque ea demum recte facta minus detorquemus and carpimus, quae in
obscuritate and silentio reponuntur.

10. Qua ex causa saepe ego mecum, Nobisne tantum, quicquid est, istud
composuisse, an and aliis debeamus ut nobis?

11. Admonet illud quoque, quod pleraque quae sunt agendae rei necessaria,
eadem peracta nec utilitatem parem, nec gratiam retinent.

12. Ac ne longius exempl^ repetamus, quid utilius fuit, quam munificentiae
rationem etiam stylo persequi?

13. Per hoc enim assequebamur, primum, ut honestis cogitationibus immoraremur;
deinde ut pulchritudinem longiore tractu pervideremus; postremo ut subitae
largitionis comitem poenitentiam caveremus.

14. Nascebatur ex his exercitatio quaedam contemnendae pecuniae.

15. Nam cum omnes homines ad custodiam ejus natura restrinxerit, nos contra
multum ac diu pensitatus amor liberalitatis communibus avaritiae vinculis
eximebat: tantoque laudabilior munificentia nostra fore videbatur, quod ^d
illam non impetu quodam, sed consilio trahebamur.

16. Accedebat his causis, quod non ludos aut gladiatores; sed annuos sumptus
in alimenta ingenuorum pollicebamur.

17 Oculorum porro and aurium voluptates adeo non egent commendatione, ut non
tam incitari debeant oratione, quam reprimi.

18. Ut vero aliquis libenter educationis taedium laboremque suscipiat, non
praemiis modo, verum etiam exquisitis adhortationibus impetrandum est.

19. Nam si medici salubres, sed voluptate carentes, cibos blandioribus
alloquiis prosequuntur: quanto magis decuit public consulentem, utilissimum
munus, sed non perinde populare, comitate orationis inducere: praesertim cum
enitendum haberemus, ut, quod parentibus dabatur, etiam nobis probaretur,
honoremque paucorum caeteri patienter and spectarent and mirarentur.

20. Sed ut tunc communibus magis commodis, quam privatae jactantiae
studebamus, cum intentionem effectumque muneris nostri vellemus intelligi: ita
nunc in ratione edendi veremur, ne forte non aliorum utilitatibus, sed propriae
laudi servisse videamur.

21. Praeterea meminimus quanto majore animo honestatis fructus in conscientia,
quam in laud reponatur.

22. Sequi enim gloria, non appeti debet: nec si casu aliquo non sequatur,
idcirco quod gloriam meretur, minus pulchrum est.

23. ^i vero, qui benefacta sua verbis adornant, non ideo praedicare quia
fecerint; sed, ut praedicarent, fecisse creduntur.

24 Sic, quod magnificum referente alio fuisset, ipso qui gesserat recensente,
vanescit.

25. Homines enim cum rem destruere non possunt, jactationem ejus incessunt;
ita si silenda feceris, factum ipsum; si laudanda, quod non sileas, ipse
culparis.

26. Me vero peculiaris quaedam impedit ratio; etenim hunc ipsum sermonem non
apud populum, sed apud Decuriones habui; nec in propatulo, sed in curia.

27. Vereor ergo ne sit satis congruens, cum in dicendo assentationem vulgi
acclamationemque defugerim, nunc eadem illa editione sectari; cumque plebem
ipsam (cui consulebatur) limine curiae parietibusque discreverim, ne quam in
speciem ambitionis inciderem, nunc eos etiam ad quos ex munere nostro nihil
pertinet praeter exemplum, velut obvia assentatione conquirere.

28. Habes cunctationis meae causas, obsequar tamen consilio tuo, cujus mihi
authoritas pro ratione sufficient. Vale.

9. C. Plinius Minutio Fundano suo S.
1. MIrum est quam singulis diebus in urbe ratio aut constet, aut constare
videatur; pluribus cunctisque non constet.

2. Nam si quem interroges, Hodie quid egisti? respondeat, Officio togae
virilis interfui, sponsalia aut nuptias frequentavi; ille me ad signandum
testamentum, ille in advocationem, ille in consilium rogavit.

3. Haec quo die feceris, necessaria, eadem si quotidie ^isse te reputes,
inania videntur; multo magis cum secesseris.

4. Tunc enim subit recordatio, quot dies quam frigidis rebus ab^umpseris.

5. Quod evenit mihi postquam in Laurentino meo aut lego aliquid, aut scribo;
aut etiam corpori vaco, eujus fulturis animus sustinetur.

6. Nihil audio quod audisse, nihil dico quod dixisse poeniteat.

7. Nemo apud me quenquam sinistris sermonibus carpit; neminem ipse reprehendo,
nisi unum me, cum parum commode scribo.

8. Nulla spe, nulla timore solicitor, nullis rumoribus inquietor, mecum
tantum and cum libellis loquor.

9. O rectam! sinceramque vitam! O dulce otium honestumque, ac pene omni
negotio pulchrius!

10. O mare, O litus, ve^um secretumque (...)! Quam multa invenitis, quam multa
dictatis?

11. Proinde tu quoque strepitum istum, inanemque discursum, and multum ineptos
labores, ut primum fuerit occasio, relinque; teque studiis vel otio trade.

12. Satius est enim, ut Attilius noster eru litissime simul and facetissime
dixit, otiosum esse, quam nihil agere. Vale.

10. C. Plinius Atrio Clementi suo S.
1. SI quando urbs nostra liberalibus studiis floruit, nunc maxim floret.

2. Multa claraque ex emplasunt; suffecerit nobis unum, Euphrates philosophus.

3. Hunc ego in Syria cum adolescentulus militarem, penitus, and domi inspexi;
amarique ab eo labotavi, etsi non erat laborandum.

4. Est enim obvius and expositus, plenusque humanitate, quam praecepit.

5. Atque utinam sic ipse, quam spem tunc de me concepit, impleverim, ut ille
multum virtutibus suis addidit.

6. At ego nunc illas miror, quia magis intelligo; quanquam ne nunc quidem
satis intelligo.

7. Ut enim de pictore, sculptore, fictore, nisi artifex judicare; ita nisi
sapiens non potest perspicere sapientem.

8. Quantum mihi tamen cernere datur, multa in Euphrate sic eminent and
elucent, ut mediocriter quoque doctos advertant, and afficiant.

9 Disputat subtiliter, graviter, ornate; frequenter etiam Platonicam illam
sublimitatem, and latitudinem effingit.

10. Sermo est copiosus and varius; dulcis imprimis, and qui repugnantes quoque
ducat and impellat.

11. Ad hoc proceritas corporis, and decora facies, demissus capillus, ingens
and cana barba; quae, licet fortuita and inania videantur, illi tamen plurimum
venerationis acquirunt.

12. Nullus horror in vultu, nulla tristitia; multum severitatis; reverearis,
ut occursum non reformides.

13. Vitae sanctitas summa, comitas par.

14. Insectatur vitia, non homines; nec castigat errantes, sed emendat.

15. Sequaris monentem attentus, and pendens; and persuaderi tibi, etiam c^m
persuaserit, cupias.

16. Jam vero liberi tres, duo mares, quos diligentissime instituit.

17. Socer Pompeius Julianus, c^m coetera vita tum vel hoc uno magnus and
clarus, quod ipse provinciae princeps, hunc inter altissimas conditiones
generum non honoribus principem, sed sapientia elegit.

18. Quanquam quid ego plura de viro, quo mihi frui non licet? an ut magis
angar? quod non licet.

19. Nam distringor officio, ut maximo, sic molestissimo.

20. Sedeo pro tribunali, subnoto libellos, conficio tabulas; scribo plurimas,
sed illiteratissimas literas.

21. Soleo nonnunquam (nam id ipsum quandoque contigit) de his occupationibus
apud Euphratem queri.

22. Ille me consolatur: affirmat etiam esse hanc philosophiae, and quidem
pulcherrimam partem, agere negorium publicum, cognoscere, judi^are, promere and
exercere justitiam, quaeque ipsi doceant in usu habere.

23. Mihi tamen hoc unum non persuadet, satius esse ista facere, quam cum illo
dies totos audiendo, discendoque, consumere.

24. Quo magis te, cui vacat, hortor, cum in urbem proxime veneris (venias
autem ob hoc maturius) illi te expoliendum limandumque permittas.

25. Neque enim ego (ut multi) invideo aliis bonum, quo ipse careo: sed contra,
sensum quendam voluptatemque percipio, si ea quae mihi denegantur, amicis video
superesse. Vale.

11. C. Plinius Justo S.
1. OLim nullas mihi epistolas mittis.

2. Nihil est, inquis, quod scribam: at hoc ipsum scribe, nihil esse quod
scribas; vel solum illud, unde incipere priores solebant, Si vales, been est;
ego valeo.

3. Hoc mihi sufficit, est enim maximum.

4. Ludere me putas? Serio peto: fac sciam, quid aga^; quod sine solicitudine
summa nescire non possum.

12. C. Plinius Calestrio Tyroni S.
1. JActuram gravissimam feci, si jactura dicenda est tanti viri amissio.

2. Decessit Coraellius Rufus, and quidem sponte, quod dolorem meum exulcerat.

3. Est enim luctuosissimum genus mortis, quae non ex natura, nec fatalis
videtur.

4. Nam utcunque in illis qui morbo finiuntur, magnum ex ipsa necessitate
solatium est: i^ iis vero q^os accersita mors aufert, hic insanabilis dolor
est, quod creduntur potuisse diu vivere.

5. Corellium quidem summa ratio, quae sapientibus pro necessitate est, ad hoc
consilium compulit, quanquam plurimas vivendi causas habentem, optimam
conscientiam, optimam famam, maximam authoritatem; praeterea, filiam, uxorem,
nepotem, sorores, interque tot pignora, veros amicos.

6. Sed tam longa, tam iniqua, valetudine conflictabatur, ut haec tanta pretia
viv^ndi mortis rationib^s vincerentur.

7. Tertio and tricesimo anno (ut ipsum audi^bam) pedum dolor correptus est.

8. Patricius hic illi: nam plerunque morbi quoque per successiones quasdam, ut
alia traduntur.

9. Hunc abstinentia, sanctirat^, q^oad viri^is aetas, vicit and fregit:
novissime eum senectate ingravescen^em, viribus animi sustinebat; cum quidem
incredibiles cruciatus, and indignissima tormenta pateretur.

10. Jam enim dolor non pedibus solis, ut prius, insidebat; sed omnia membra
pervagabatur.

11. Veni ad eum Domitiani temporibus in suburbano jacentem.

12. Servi e cubiculo recesserunt: habebat enim hoc moris, q^oties intrasset
fidelior amicus: quinetiam uxor, quanquam omnis secreti capacissima,
digrediebatur.

13. Circumtulit oculos, and Cur (inquit) m^ putas hos tantos dolores tamdiu
sustinere? ut scilicet (...) ^ationi vel uno die supersim.

14. Dedisses huic animo par corpus, fecisset quod optabat.

15. Affuit tamen Deus voto; cujus ille compos, ut jam securus liberque
moriturus, multa illa vitae, sed minora retinacula abrupit.

16. Incr^verat valetudo, quam temperantia mitigare tentavit, perseverantem
constantia fugi^

17. Iam dies alter, tertius, quartus abstinebat cibo: misit ad me uxor ejus
Hispulla communem amicum C. Geminium cum tristissimo nuncio, destinasse
Coraellium mori, nec aut suis aut filiae precibus flecti; solum superesse me, a
quo revocari posset ad vitam.

18. Cucurri; perveneram in proximum, cum mihi ab eadem Hispulla Julius Attic^s
nunciat, nihil jam ne me quidem impetraturum; tam obstinate magis ac magis
induruisse.

19. Dixerat sane medico admonenti cibum, (...); quae vox quantum admirationis
in animo, tantum desiderii reliquit.

20. Cogito quo amico, quo viro caream.

21. Implevit quidem annum septimum and sexagesimum; quae aetas etiam
robustissimis satis longa est.

22. Scio, evasit perpetuam valetudinem; scio, decessit superstitibus suis;
florente Repub. quae omnibus suis charior erat, and hoc scio.

23. Ego tamen tanquam and juvenis and fortissimi morte doleo: doleo autem,
licet me imbecillum putes, meo nomine.

24. Amisi enim, amisi, vitae meae testem, rectorem, magistrum; in summa,
dicam, quod recenti dolor contubernali meo Calvisio dixi; Vereor ne
negligentius vivam.

25. Proinde adhibe solatia mihi: non haec, Senex erat, Infirmus erat (haec
enim novi) sed nova aliqua, sed magna; quae audierim nunquam, legerim nunquam.

26. Nam quae audivi, quae legi, sponte succurrunt; sed tanto dolor
superantur. Vale.

13. C. Plinius Sosio Senecioni S.
1. MAgnum proventum Poetarum annus hic attulit.

2. Toto mense Aprili nullus fere dies, quo non recitaret aliquis.

3. Iuvat me quod vigent studia, proferunt se ingenia hominum and ostentant;
tametsi ad audiendum pigre coitur, plerique in stationibus sedent, tempusque
audiendi fabulis conterunt, ac subinde sibi nunciari jubent, an jam recitator
intraverit, an dixerit praefationem, an ex magna part evolverit librum.

4. Tum demum, ac tunc quoque, lent cunctanterque veniunt; nec tamen
permanent, sed ante finem recedunt; alii dissimulanter and furtim, alii
simpliciter and libere.

5. At hercle, memoria parentum, Claudium Caesarem ferunt, cum in Palatio
spatiaretur, audissetque clamorem, causam requisiiste, cumque dictum esset,
recitate Nonianum, subitum recitanti inopinatumque venisse.

6. Nunc otiosissimus quisque multo ante rogatus, and identidem admonitus, aut
non venit, aut, si venit, queritur se diem, quia non perdiderit, perdidisse.

7. Sed tanto magis laudandi probandique sunt, quos ^ scribendi recitandique
studio haec auditorum vel desidia vel superbia non retardat.

8. Equidem prope nemini defui: erant sane plerique amici.

9. Neque enim est fere quisquam qui studia, ut non simul and nos amet.

10. His ex causis longius quam destinaveram, tempus in urbe consumpsi.

11. Possum jam repetere secessum, and scribere aliquid; quod non recitem, ne
videar, quorum recitationibus affui, non auditor fuisse, sed creditor.

12. Nam ut in caeteris rebus, ita in audiendi officio, perit gratia si
reposcatur. Vale.

14. C. Plinius Junio Maurico suo S.
1. PEtis ut fratris tui filiae prospiciam maritum; quod merito mihi potissimum
injungis.

2. Scis enim quantopere summum illum virum suspexerim, dilexerimque, quibus
ille adolescentiam meam exhortationibus foverit, quibus etiam laudibus ut
laudandus viderer effecerit.

3. Nihil est quod a te mandari mihi aut majus aut gratius, nihil quod
honestius a me suscipi possit, quam ut eligam juvenem ex qua nasci nepotes
Aruleno Rustico deceat.

4. Qui quidem diu quaerendus fuisset, nisi paratus and quasi provisus esset
Minucius Acilianus, qui me, ut juvenis juvenem (est enim minor pauculis annis)
familiarissime diligit, reveretur ut senem: nam ita a me formari and institui
cupit, ut ego a vobis solebam.

5. Patria est ei Brixia, ex illa nostra Italia, quae multum adhuc verecundiae,
frugalitatis, atque etiam rusticitatis antiquae retinet ac servat.

6. Pater Minucius Macrinus equestris ordinis princeps quia nihil altius
voluit, allectus a Divo Vespasiano inter Praetorios, honestam quietem huic
nostrae ambitioni dicam an dignitati, constantissime praetulit.

7. Habet aviam maternam Serranam Proculam, e municipio Patavino: nosti loci
mores.

8. Serrana tamen Patavinis quoque severitatis exemplum est.

9. Contigit and avunculus ei P. Acilius, gravitate, prudentia, fide prope
singulari.

10. In summa, nihil erit in domo tota quod non tibi, tanquam in tua placeat.

11. Aciliano vero ipsi plurimum vigoris, and industriae, quanquam in maxima
verecundia: Quaesturam, Tribunatum, Praeturam, honestissime percurrit; ac jam
pro se tibi necessitatem ambiend^ remisit.

12. Est illi facies liberalis, multo sanguine, multo rubore suffusa.

13. Est ingenua totius corporis pulchritudo, and quidem Senatorius decor; quae
ego nequaquam arbitror negligenda; debet enim hoc castitati puell^rum quasi
praemium dari.

14. Nescio an adjiciam, esse patri ejus amplas facultates: nam cum imaginor
vos quibus quaerimus generum, silendum de facultatibus puto; q^um publicos
mores, atque etiam leges civitatis intueor, quae vel in primis census hominum
spectandos arbitrantur, ne id quidem praetereundum videtur.

15 Et sane de posteris, and his pluribus, cogitanti, hic quoque in
conditionibus deligendis ponendus est calculus.

16. Tu fortasse me putes indulsisse amori meo, supraque ista quam res patitur
sustulisse; at ego fide mea spondeo futurum, ut omnia long ampliora, quam a me
praedicantur, invenias.

17. Diligo quidem adolescentem ardentissime, sicut meretur.

18. Sed hoc ipsum amantis est, non onerare eum laudibus. Vale.

15. C. Plinius Septitio Claro suo S.
1. HE^s tu! promittis ad coenam, nec venis.

2. Dicitur jus; ad assem impendium reddes, nec id modicum.

3. Paratae erant Lactucae singulae, Cochleae ternae, Ova bina, Alica cum
mulso, and Nive (nam hanc quoque computabis, immo hanc in primis, quae perit in
ferculo olivae Baeticae) cucurbitae, bulbi, alia mill non minus lauta.

4. Audisses Comaedum, vel Lectorem, vel Lyristen, vel, quae mea liberalitas,
omnes.

5. At tu apud nescio quem, Ostrea, Vulvas, Echinos, Gaditana maluisti.

6. Dabis poenas, non dico quas.

7. Dure fecisti: invidisti nescio an tibi, certe mihi; sed tamen and tibi:

8. Quantum nos lusissemus, rifissemus, studuissemus?

9. Potes apparatius coenare apud multos, nunquam hilarious, simplicius,
incautius: in summa, experire.

10. Et nisi postea te aliis potius excusaveris, mihi semper excusa. Vale.

16. C. Plinius Euritio suo.
1. AMabam Pompoium Saturninum, hunc dico nostrum; laudabamque ejus ingenium,
etiam antequam scirem, quam varium, quam flexibile, quam multiplex esset: nunc
vero totum me tenet, habet, possidetque.

2. Audivi causas agentem acriter and ardenter, nec minus polite, and ornate,
sive meditata, sive subita proferret.

3. Adsunt aptae crebraeque sententiae, gravis and decora constructio, sonantia
verba and antiqua.

4. Omnia haec mire placent, cum impetu quodam, and fulmine praevehuntur;
placent, si rettractentur.

5. Senties quod ego, cum orationes ejus in manus sumpseris; quas facile
cuilibet veterum, quorum est aemulus, comparabis.

6. Idem tamen in historia tibi magis satisfaciet vel brevitate, vel luce, vel
suavitate, vel splendore etiam and sublimitate narrandi.

7. Nam in concionibus eadem quae in orationibus vi^ est; pressior tamen, and
circumscriptior, and adductior.

8. Praeterea facit versus, quales Catullus meus aut Calvus.

9. Quantum illis leporis, dulcedinis, amaritudinis, amoris inserit?

10. San^, sed data opera, molliusculos, leviusculosque, duriusculos quosdam;
and hoc quasi Catullus meus aut Calvus.

11. Legit mihi nuper Epistolas, quas uxoris esse dicebat: Plautum vel
Terentium metro solutum legi credidi.

12. Quae sive uxoris sunt, ut affirmat; sive ipsius, ut negat; pari gloria
dignus est: qui aut illa componat, aut uxorem, quam virginem accepit, tam
doctam, politamque reddiderit.

13. Est ergo mecum per diem totum: eundem antequam scribam, eundem quum
scripsi, eundem etiam quum remitto, non tanquam eundem, lego:

14. Quod te quoque, ut facias, and hortor, and moneo.

15. Neque enim debet operibus ejus obesse quod vivit.

16. An, si inter eos quos nunquam vidimus floruisset, non solum libros ejus,
verum etiam imagines conquireremus; ejusdem nunc honor praesentis and gratia
quasi satietate languescet?

17. At hoc pravum malignumque est, non admirari hominem admiratione
dignissimum, quia videre, alloqui, audire, complecti, nec laudare tantum verum
etiam amare contigit. Vale.

17. C. Plinius Corn. Titiano suo S.
1. ESt adhuc curae hominibus fides and officium.

2. Sunt qui defunctorum quoque amicos agunt.

3. Titinius Capito ab Imperatore nostro impetravit ut sibi liceret statuam L.
Syllani in foro ponere.

4. Pulchrum, and magna laud dignum, amicitia principis in hoc uti, quantumque
gratia valeas, aliorum honoribus experiri.

5. Est omnino Capitoni in usu, claros colere: mirum est, qua religione, quo
studio imagines Brutorum, Cassiorum, Catonum domi, ubi potest, habeat.

6. Idem clarissimi cujusque vitam egregiis carminibus exornat.

7. Scias ipsum plurimis virtutibus abundare, qui alienas sic amet.

8. Redditus est L. Silano debitus honor, cujus immortalitati Capito prospexit
pariter, ac suae.

9 Neque enim magis decorum and insigne est, statuam in foro populi Romani
habere, quam ponere. Vale.

18. C. Plinius Tranquillo suo S.
1. SCribis te, perterritum somnio, vereri ne quid adversi in action patiaris.

2. Rogas, ut dilationem petam, and pauculos dies; certe proximum excusem,
difficile est, sed experiar, -- (...).


3. Refert tamen, eventura soleas, an contraria somniare.

4. Mihi reputanti somnium meum, istud quod times tu, egregiam actionem
portendere videtur.

5. Susceperam causam Julii Pastoris, cum mihi quiescen^i visa est socrus mea
advoluta genibus, ne agerem, obsecrare.

6. Et eram acturus adolescentulus adhuc: eram in quadruplici judicio: eram
contra potentissimos civitatis, atque etiam Caesaris amicos: quae singula
excutere mentem mihi post tam triste somnium poterant.

7. Egi tamen (...) illud, (...).

8. Nam mihi patria, etsi quid charius patria, fides videbatur.

9. Prospere cessit: atque ideo illa actio mihi aures hominum, illa januam
famae patefecit.

10. Proinde dispice, an tu quoque sub hoc exemplo somnium istud in bonum
vertas: aut si tutius putas illud cautissimi cujusque praeceptum, Quod dubitas
ne feceris, id ipsum rescribe.

11. Ego aliquam stropham inveniam, agamque causam tuam, ut ipsam agere, cum
voles, possis.

12. Et enim sane alia ratio tua, alia mea fuit.

13. Nam judicium Centumvirale differri nullo modo, istud aegre quidem, sed
tamen potest. Vale.

19. C. Plinius Romano Firmo suo, S.
1. MUniceps tu meus, and condis^ipulus, and ab ineunte aetate contubernalis:
pater tuus, and matri, and avunculo meo, mihi etiam quantum aetatis diversitas
passa est, familiaris: magnae and graves causae, cur suscipere and augere
dignitatem tuam debeam.

2. Esse autem tibi centum millium censum, satis indicat, quod apud nos decurio
es.

3. Igitur ut te non decurio ne solum, ver^m etiam equite Romano perfruamur,
offero tibi ad implendas equestres facultates CCC. millia nummum.

4. Te memorem hujus muneris amicitiae nostrae diuturnitas spondet.

5. Ego ne illud quidem admoneo, quod admonere deberem, nisi te scirem sponte
facturum, ut dignitate a me data, quam modestissime, ut a me data, utare.

6. Nam solicitius custodiendus est honor, in quo etiam beneficium amici
tuendum est. Vale.

20. C. Plinius Corn. Tacito suo, S.
1. FRequens mihi disputatio est cum quodam docto homine, and perito, cui nihil
aeque in causis agendis, ut brevitas placet; quam ego custodiendam esse
confiteor, si causa permittat, alioqui praevaricatio est transire dicenda;
praevaricatio etiam, cursim and breviter attingere, quae sint inculcanda,
infigenda, repetenda: nam plerisque longiore tractu vis quaedam and pondus
acc^dit.

2. Utque corpori ferrum, sic oration animo non ictu m^ gis quam mo^a imprimitur.

3 Hic ille mecum auctoritatibus agit, ac mihi ^x Graecis orationes Lysiae
ostentat, ex nostris, Gracchorum Catonisque, quorum sane plurimae sunt
circumcisae and b^eves.

4. Ego Lysiae Demosthenem, Aeschinem, Hyperidem^ multosque praeterea Gracchis,
and Catoni, Pollionem^ Caesarem, Caelium, and imprimis Marcum Tullium oppono,
cujus oration optima fertur esse, quae maxima.

5. Et hercule, ut aliae bonae res, ita bonus liber quisque melior est, q^o
major.

6. Vides ut statuas, signa, picturas, hominum denique, multorumq^e animalium
formas, arborum etiam, si modo sint decorae, nihil magis quam amplitudo
commendat.

7. Idem etiam orationibus accidit: q^in etiam voluminibus ipsis auctoritatem
quandam and pulchritudinem adjicit magnitudo.

8. Haec ille, multaque alia, quae a me in eandem sententiam solent dici, ut
est in disputando incomprehensibilis and lubricus, ita eludit, ut contendat hos
ipsos, quorum orationibus nitar, pauciora dixisse, quam ediderint.

9. Ego contra puto.

10. Testes sunt multae multorum orationes, and Ciceronis pro Murena, pro
Vareno; in quibus brevis and nuda quasi subscriptio quorundam criminum solis
titulis indicatur.

11. Ex his apparet, illum permulta dixisse, cum ederet, omisisse.

12. Idem pro Cluentio ait se totam causam veteri instituto solum perorasse,
and pro Cornelio q^atriduo egisse; ne dubitare possimus, quae per plures dies,
ut necesse erat, latius dixerit, postea recisa, ac purgata, in unum librum,
grandem quidem, unum tamen, coarctasse.

13. At aliud est actio bona, aliud oration.

13. Scio nonnullis ita videri, sed ego (forsitan fallor) persuasum habeo,
posse fieri, ut sit actio bona, quae non sit bona oration: non posse non bonam
actionem esse, quae sit bona oration.

15. Est enim oration actionis exemplar, and quasi (...).

16. Ideo in optima quaque mill extemporales figuras invenimus; in his etiam,
quas tantum editas scimus, ut in Verrem, Artificem, quemnam? recte admones.
Polycletum esse dicebant.

17. Sequitur ergo, ut actio sit absolutissima, quae maxim orationis
similitudinem expresserit, si modo justum and debitum tempus accipiat, quod si
negetur, nulla orationis, maxima judicis culpa est.

18. Ad sunt huic opinioni meae leges, quae longissima tempora largiuntur, nec
brevitatem dicentibus, sed copiam, hoc est, diligentiam, suadent: quam
praestare in angustissimis causis non potest brevitas.

19. Adjiciam quod me docuit usus, magister, egregius; frequenter egi,
frequenter judicavi, frequenter in consilio fui; a^iud alios movet; ac
plerunque parvae res maximas trahunt; varia sunt hominum judicia, variae
voluntates; inde qui eandem causam simul audierunt, saepe diversum, interdum
idem, sed ex diversis animi motibus sentiunt.

20. Praeterea suae quisque inventioni favet, and quasi fortissimum
complectitur, quum ab alio dictum est, quod ipse praevidit.

21. Omnibus ergo tandum est aliquid, quod teneant, quod agnoscant.

22. Dixit aliquando mihi Regulus, quum simul adessemus: Tu omnia, quae sunt in
causa putas exequenda; ego jugulum statim video, hunc premo; premit sane quod
eligit, sed in eligendo frequenter errat.

23. Respondi, posse fieri, ut genu esset aut tibia, aut talus, ubi ille
jugulum putaret.

24. At ego (inquam) qui jugulum perspicere non possum, omnia pertento, omnia
experior, (...) denique (...).

25. Utque in agricultura, non vineas tantum, verum etiam arbusta; non arbusta
tantum, verum etiam campos curo, and exerceo: atque in ipsis campis non far,
aut siliginem solam, sed ordeum, fabam, ceteraque legumina sero: sic in action
plura quasi semina latius spargo, ut q^ae provenerint, colligam

26. Neque enim minus imperspicua, incerta, fallaciaque sunt judicum ingenia,
quam tempestatum, terrarumque

27. Nec me praeterit summum oratorem Periclem sic a comico Eupolide laudari.

28. -- (...)
(...).
(...),
(...).


29. Verum huic ipsi Pericli nec illa (...), nec illud (...) brevitate vel
velocitate, vel utra que (differunt enim) sine facultate summa contigisset.

30 Nam delectare, persuadere, copiam dicendi spaciumque desiderant; relinquere
vero aculeum in audientium animis is demum potest, qui non pungit, sed infigit.

31. Add, quae de eodem Pericle comicus alter, (...).


32. Non enim amputata oration and abscissa, sed lata and magnifica, and excelsa
tonat, fulgurat, omnia denique perturbat ac miscet.

33. Optimus tamen modus est, quis negat? sed non minus non servat modum, qui
infra rem, quam qui supra: qui adstrictius, quam qui effusius dicit.

34. Itaque audis frequenter, ut illud immodice and redundanter, ita hoc jejune
and infirm: alius excessisse materiam, alius dicitur non implesse; aeque
ute^que, sed ille imbecillitate, hic viribus peccat; quod certe etsi non
limatioris, majoris tamen ingenii judicium est.

35. Nec vero cum haec dico, illum Homericum (...) probo, sed hunc, (...);
non quia non and ille mihi validissime placeat, (...).

36. Si tamen detur electio, illam orationem ^^milem nivibus hybernis, id est,
crebram, assiduam and largam, postremo divinam and caelestem volo.

37. At est gratior multis actio brevis.

38. Est quidem, sed inertibus, quorum delicias desidiamque, quasi judicium
respicere, ridiculum est.

39. Nam si hos tu in consilio habeas, non sol^m satius est breviter, sed
omnino non dicere.

40. Haec est adhuc sententia mea, quam mutabo, si dissenseris tu; sed plane
cur dissentias, explices, rogo.

41. Quamvis enim cedere autoritati tuae debeam, rectius tamen arbitror in
tanta re, ratione, quam autoritate superari.

42. Proinde si non errare videor, id ipsum quam voles brevi epistola, sed
tamen scribe; confirmabis enim judicium meum; si vero errare, longissimam para.

43. Non cor^upi^ (...), q^i tibi si mihi accederes, brevis epistolae
necessitatem; si dissentires, longissimae, imposui. Vale.

21. C. Plinius Paterno suo S.
1. UT animi tui judicio, sic oculorum plurimum tribuo: ^on quia multum, ne
tibi placeas, sed quia tantum quancum ego sapis; quanquam hoc quoque multum est.

2. Omissis jocis, credo decentes esse servos qui sunt empti mihi ex consilio
tuo; superest ut frugi sint: quod de venalibus, melius auribus, quam oculis
judicatur. Vale.

22. C. Plinius Catilio Severo suo S.
1. DIu jam in urbe haereo, and quidem attonitus.

2. Perturbat me longa and pertinax valetudo Titi Aristonis, quem singulariter
and miror and diligo: nihil enim est illo gravius, sanctius, doctius: ut mihi
non unus homo, sed literae ipsae, omnesque bonae arts in uno homine summum
periculum adire videantur.

3. Quam peritus ille and privati juris and publici? quantum antiquitatis
tenet? nihil est, quod discere velis, quod ille docere non possit: mihi certe
quoties aliquid abditum quaero, ille thesaurus est.

4. Jam quanta sermonibus ejus fides, quanta authoritas, quam pressa and deco^a
cunctatio? quid est quod non statim sciat? and tamen plerunque haesitat,
dubitat diversitate rationum; quas acri magnoque judicio ab origin causisque
primis repetit, discernit, expendit.

5. Ad hoc quam parcus in victu? quam modicus in cultu?

6. Soleo ipsum cubiculum ejus ipsumque lectum, ut imaginem quandam priscae
frugalitatis aspicere.

7. Ornat haec magnitudo animi, quae nihil ad ostentationem, omnia ad
conscientiam refert: recteq^e facti, non ex populi sermon mercedem, sed ex
facto petit.

8. In summa, non facile quis quenquam ex istis qui sapientiae studium habitu
corporis praeferunt, huic viro compararit.

9. Non quidem gymnasium sectatur, aut porticus, aut disputationibus longis
aliorum ocium suumque delectat; sed in toga, negotiisque versatur, multos
advocatione, plures consilio juvat.

10. Nemini tamen istorum castitate, pietate, justitia, fortitudine primo loco
cesserit.

11. Mirareris, si interesses, qua patientia hanc ipsam valetudinem toleret, ut
dolori resistat, ut sitim differat, ut incredibilem febrium ardorem immotus
opertusque transmittat.

12. Nuper me paucosque mecum, quos maxim diligit, advocavit, rogavitque, ut
medicos consuleremus de summa valetudinis, ut, si esset superabilis, sponte
exiret e vita, sin tantum difficilis, and longa, resisteret, maneretque.

13. Dandum enim precibus uxoris, dandum filiae lachrymis, dandum etiam nobis
amicis, ne spes nostras, si modo non essent inanes, voluntaria morte descreret.

14. Id ego arduum imprimis, and praecipua laud dignum puto.

15. Nam impetu quodam, and instinctu procurrere ad mortem, commune cum multis;
deliberare vero, and causas ejus expendere, utque suaserit ratio, vitae
mortisque consilium suscipere, vel ponere, ingentis est animi.

16. Et medici quidem secunda nobis pollicentur: superest, ut promissis Deus
adnuat, tandemque me hac solicitudine exolvat; qua liberatus Laurentinum meum,
hoc est, libellos, and pugillares, studiosumque otium repetam.

17. Nunc enim nihil legere, nihil scribere, aut assidenti vacat, aut anxio
libet.

18. Habes, quid timeam, quid optem, quid etiam in posterum destinem.

19. Tu quid egeris, quid agas, quid velis agere, invicem nobis, sed
laetioribus epistolis, scribe.

20. Erit confusioni meae non mediocre solatium, si tu nihil quereris. Vale.

33. C. Plinius Pompeio Falconi suo S.
1. COnsulis an existimem te in Tribunatu causas agere decere.

2. Plurimum refert, quid esse Tribunatum putes; inanem^ ^bram, and sine honor
nomen, an potestatem sacrosanctam, and quam in ordinem cogi ut a nullo, ita ne
a se deceat.

3. Ipse cum Tribunus essem, erraverim fortasse, qui me esse aliquid putavi,
sed tanquam essem, abstinui causis agendis: primum, quod deforme arbitrabar,
cui assurgere, cui loco cedere omnes oporteret, hunc omnibus sedentibus stare;
and qui jubere posset tacere quemcunque, huic silentium clepsydra indici; and
quem interfari nefas esset, hunc etiam convitia audire; and si inulta
pateretur, inertem; si ulcisceretur, insolentem videre.

4. Erat hic quoque aestus ante oculos, si forte me appellasset, vel ille cui
adessem, vel ille quem contra intercederem, auxilium ferrem, an quiescerem,
sileremque, and quasi ejurato magistratu privatum ipse me facerem.

5. His rationibus motus, malui me tribunum omnibus exhibere, quam paucis
advocatum.

6. Sed tu (iterum dicam) plurimum interest, quid esse tribunatum putes; quam
personam tibi imponas, quae sapienti viro ita aptanda est, ut perferatur.

24. C. Plinius Bebio Hispano suo S.
1. TRanquillus, contubernalis meus, vult emere agellum, quem venditare amicus
tuus dicitur.

2. Rogo cures, quanti aequum est, emat: ita enim delectabit emisse.

3. Nam mala emptio semper ingrata est, eo maxim quod exprobrare stultitiam
domino videtur.

4. In hoc autem agello (si modo arriserit pretium) Tranquilli mei stomachum
multa solicitant, vicinitas urbis, opportunitas viae, mediocritas villae, modus
ruris, qui advocet magis quam distringat.

5. Scholasticis porro studiosis, ut hic est, sufficit abunde tantum soli, ut
relevare caput, reficere oculos, reptare per limitem, unamque semitam terere,
omnesque viticulas suas nosse, and numerare arbusculas possint.

6* ^ec tibi exposui, quo magis scires, quantum ille esset mihi, quantum ego
tibi debiturus, si praediolum istud quod commendatur his dotibus, salubriter
emerit, ut poenitentiae locum non relinquat. Vale.

Joannis Ravisii Textoris viginti Epistolae.
Epistola 1.
1. HAbui jampridem in votis, mutuis te verbis convenire, and paucis admodum,
quae in rem tuam sint, amicorum precibus hortari.

2. Caenabamus pridie hujus diei domi meae ego and aliquot amicorum tuorum, qui
te a parvulo semper sibi demeruerunt.

3. Inter caenandum cum variis de rebus una loqueremur, accessit, nescio quis,
insperatus nuncius, tuus (ut dicebat) familiaris.

4. Protinus (ut liberorum curiosi sunt parents) matter tua percuntari caepit,
quomodo esset filio suo, quam prospere valeret, quantumque in literis
profecisset.

5. Respondit ille, been quidem tibi esse, teque parentum tuorum monitis ubique
semper acquievisse, praeterquam quod literarum studia non amavisses.

6. Quod ubi accepit pauperrima illa muliercula (miserum me!) quantum indoluit!

7 Verba mea apud te fidem non caperent, si ejusdem de tua hac negligentia
querimonias tibi apperirem.

8 ^ndoluit siquidem vehementius, quam ut credi valeat.

9. Te oro, si hactenus dementaveris, nunc resipiscas, and ad literas animum
convertas.

10. Si enim tua semper negligentia Epimenidis (quod aiunt) somnum indormires,
esses ei causa mortis, quae tibi fuit vitae. Vale.

Epist. 2.
1. AMicorum tuorum permulti satis aegre tulerunt, quod quotidianis pene
convitiis tui te honoris jampridem monuerint, neque tamen assiduis eorum
clamoribus locum reliqueris.

2. Volebant, and ita sperabant futurum, opera tua, quae jam diu cum blattis ac
tineis rixantur, in lucem emitti: cum ut ex ea editione aliquid tibi laudis
accederet, tum etiam, ut inde fructum caperent studiosi adolescentes.

3. Quam, quaeso, jacturam faceres, si nostris omnium votis responderes?
Existimasne parentibus esse permolestum, repulsam a te pati, a quo omnia sibi
promittebant?

4. Non sum adeo imprudens rerum, ut non facile videam nihil non maturum and
concoctum curiosis hominum judiciis committi oportere.

5. Quinetiam summo^um quoque scriptorum opera and labores criticis lectorum
unguibus and lituris plerunque vapulant.

6. Nihilominus cum multos annos tu (hoc est, homo doctissimus) vigilias tuas
ad unguem elimaveris; secure (mea quidem sententia) potes parere, quod jam
pridem parturis.

7. Ego enim te extra omnem liturarum and obeliscorum aleam esse dijudico:
neque jacturam ullam inde futuram video, praeterquam quod docilem tibi
juventutem demereberis, and amicorum precibus satisfacies; quibus si non
pareas, quamdiu certe vives, tamdiu male audies. Vale.

Epist. 3.
1. PUdet me nostri hujus seculi, quo jam ea inolevit consuetudo, ut si quis
vel proletarius vel semidoctus opus aliquod rudi (quod aiunt) Minerva
compegerit magis, quam fabrefecerit, dignum statim existimemus, quod nihil non
vellicantibus hominum judiciis committatur, quodque lecturiant omnes, and
empturiant.

2. Quasi vero non esset nobis compertum, nil esse usque adeo elimatum, quod
non interdum lectorum unguibus and graphiis expungatur severissimis.

3. Quorsum vero haec? roget aliquis.

4. Hortabaris me paucis adhinc diebus, ut ego frivolas quasdem nugas, a me
tumultuario and interrupto plerunque studio congestas, curarem imprimendas;
quinetiam, me stultitiae arguere videbaris, quod tamdiu hoc ipsum facere
supersedissem.

5. Nae tu ipse multum deliras, qui Horatii non perpendis consilium, monentis
ne praecipitetur editio, nonumque prematur in annum.

6. An vero non vides plerosque primae in dicendo celebritatis viros, deletiles
Censorum spongias pertulisse?

7. Si ergo has mei laboris primitias eventilarem, quid inde futurum diceres,
cum nihil dum commentatione dignum scripserim, nihil, quod marcentem lectoris
stomachum non magis ad somnum provocet, quam ad amplius legendum everberet?

8. Quicquid habeo, parentibus refero acceptum; magis tamen nitar honori meo
consulere, quam incautis eorum judiciis temere assentiri. Vale.

Epist. 4^
1. CUm propter voluptates eo tui parents miserunt, quo folent, qui bonas
amant disciplinas: da operam, quaeso, ut eam quam de te caeperunt omnes, non
fallas opinionem.

2. Dicebam novissimis, quas ad te dedi, literis, quantum matri tuae doluisset,
quod accepisset, te parum adhuc, aut nihil omnino, in bonis literis promovisse.

3. Esses malignae conditionis, si amicorum (qui tibi honesta and profutura
consulunt) precibus nihil condonares.

4. Tuum est nobis obedire, ut nostrum, te hortari.

5. Aliquidne tibi suademus, quod factu non sit utile.

6. Nos, si nescis, tuae, non nostrae utilitatis satagimus.

7. Negligentiam tuam and inertiam susque deque ferremus, nisi eam sciremus
tibi futuram detrimento.

8. Fac ergo quod monemus, and prospere tecum agetur.

9. Si enim f^ceris, omnia ex animi sententia abunde tibi suppeditabimus. Vale.

Epist. 5.
1. CUm certo videas ad nullius rei summam nisi praecedentibus initiis
perveniri posse, miror maxim quod minores disciplinas (sine quibus tamen non
est majoribus locus) adeo spreveris, ut earum studio tibi omnino interdixeris.

2. An quia procul ab ostentatione positae sunt, inutiles propterea and
infrugiferae tibi videntur.

3. Usu venit, ut qui minoribus primum elementis exerceri vel recusant, vel
erubescunt, in his quae sublimiora sunt, infirmum ingenii sui captum praebeant,
and experiantur.

4 Neque enim credibile est, firmum fore aedificium, quod invalidis ruinosisque
nititur fundamentis; aut eos magno oneri non succubituros, qui permodico
fatiscunt.

5. Si saperes, altiora non molireris; sed potius imiteris aviculas, quae nidis
suis nunquam egrediuntur implumes; neque prius aeri corpuscula committunt, quam
facto primum periculo, sese idoneas ad volatum didicerint. Vale.

Epist. 6.
1. EMergunt quotidie novae mihi anxietates, quae animum meum supra quam
cuiquam credibile sit, vary disto^quent.

2. Sed nihil est, quod dolorem meum magis adaugea^, quam cum turpissimae tuae
vitae venit in mentem.

3. Effluxit jam triennium, ex quo sumptu non modico tui te parents in scholis
nutrierunt, tibique omnia ex animi tui sententia abunde suppeditarunt.

4. Fuere tamen receptae fidei homines plerique, qui paucis abhinc diebus mihi
narr^ runt, te parum adhuc, aut nihil omnino in literis promovisse: ita ut
tertio quoque vocabulo barbarismum committas.

5. Egeris, ut voles; vive tuis legibus: ego te missum faciam: sciveris tamen
rebus tuis pessime consultum iri, nisi vitam in melius mutaveris.

Distichon.
Tot fortunati sine morbo sint tibi menses,
Tempore quot verno parturit Hybla favos.
Epist. 7.
1. NIhili facis, ut audio, amicorum consilia, qui tuae tamen student utilitati.

2. Neque laboro, neque gravate fero, quod verba mea susque deque habeas.

3. Doleo tamen quod his non pareas, qui tibi nocere non minus q^am prodesse
valiant.

4. Pessime ut video rebus tuis consuletur, si solitae semper dementiae
institeris, neque apud amicos culpam deprecabere, nisi eis acquiescas, quibus
and animam debes.

5. Vale, and me serio, non joco loqui existimes.

6. Nam nisi feceris quod moneo, periclitaberis parum tibi frugis accidere.

Distichon.
Non prius incurras duri contagia morbi,
Quam sese immiti copulet agna lupo.
Epist. 8.
1. SI existimarem literas meas aliquid ad stomachum tuum facturas, tibique
for^ plausibiles, ego te non minus scribendo satiarem, quam tuis ipse
clamoribus ad hoc agendum me jampridem compulisti.

2. Culpam enim deprecari, aut noxa me eximere non possum, si repulsam a me
patereris, cui hactenus te totum devovisti, quemque tuis semper opibus juvisti,
and consiliis.

3. Sed cum videam eorum nomen periclitari maxim, qui suas ineptias, viris
saltem eruditis, tuique similibus, non tam legendas, quam ridendas exponunt,
and eventilant; ego infirmitatis meae deterritus conscientia, nugas meas tanti
viri judicio non ausim exponere.

4. Nam si scriberem risum (certo scio) moverent tibi mei barbarismi, and te ab
amore mei fortasse diverterent.

5. Quare nostrae vellem deprecationi veniam non deroges.

6. Vale, decus literarum.

Distichon.
Sint tibi tot nummi, tot opes, aurique talenta,
Poma quot Alcinoi nobilis hortus habet.
Epist. 9.
1. EX quo tempore ad bonam frugem te recepisti, cavistique ab eorum commercio,
quos, more pecudum, Veneri and voluptatibus non pudet indulgere; tantam ubique
locorum famam tui nominis concitasti, ut vicatim compitatimque praedicent omnes
Deumque pene faciant.

2. Quod si eo, quo coepisti, pede petrexeris, certo scio, tantum amicis
futuram inde laetitiam, ut ne digitum quidem transversum a nominis tui
commendatione recessuri sint.

3. Pater tuus (nihil commiscar) tantam ex ea re cepit voluptatem, ut jam se
totum devovisse, relictisque omnibus aliis, quos habet, liberis, in tuam
jurasse utilitatem videatur.

4. Quare prudenter, mea quidem sententia, feceris, si a scopo virtutis non
declines.

5. Vale, and recte monontem sequere.

Epist. 10.
1. CRedebas, ut opinor, te tuis verbis fore mihi formidolosum, cum nuper
irascereris, evomeresque quicquid in buccam veniret.

2. Non sum is qui fulgura ex vitro reformidem, cuique terrori sint futiles and
importunae, qualibus tunc temporis strepebas, comminationes.

3. Convitia tua nullo me detrimento afficiunt.

4. Si tamen solita semper loquacitate stomachum mihi moveris, faciam te tuae
stultitiae poenitere: secus enim illatae tibi injuriae culpam praestarem; cum
tamen rebus tuis, perinde ac meis, hactenus semper consuluerim. Vale.

Epist. 11.
1. NEscio quam odiosa mihi semper fuerit superba and impudens hominum
arrogantia, eorum maxim, qui cum ex humili and peregrina condition ad
perpinguem conscenderunt, adeo protinus insolescunt, primaeque paupertatis
obliviscuntur, ut neminem prae se ducant hominem.

2. Cujusmodi morbo quoniam tota laboras cervice, periclitari mihi libuit,
possem necne aliquo velut Helleboro contagiosam hanc cerebri tui expurgare
dementiam.

3. Qui utinam pressius paulo generis tui vilitatem examinares, ac
reminiscereris, quoties pater tuus ostiatim, domesticatimque stipem emendicavit.

4. Tu pridie quam huc venisses, ne obolum quidem habebas, unde restim emeres.

5. Nudus eras tanquam ex matre.

6. Si benignior tecum fortuna luscrit, and utramque (quod dicitur) mammam
dederit lactandam, debes propterea tantum tibi arrogare, tuoque indulgere
supercilio, ut jam pavonis flabellum and exuvium leonis prae te feras?

7. Si divitias illas tuae virtuti magis, quam fortuito casui adscribis, tota
erras via: nam si fortuna ex hominum meritis opes dispensaret, and largiretur,
multi certe emendicarent, and inedia consumerentur, qui bonorum habent
myrmecias: multi contra (in quos novercatur eadem fortuna) opulescerent, and
drachmae grandine opirentur.

8. Quare nosce teipsum, and tuorum natalium, q^i ortu Nili sunt obscuriores,
reminiscere. Vale.

Epist. 12.
1. NOn desisto literis fere quotidianis aures tuas onerare, teque hortari, ut
verbis antiquatis and inusitatis tibi interdicas.

2. Nihilominus tamen quotiescunque scribis, tota tua oration obsoletis ade^
scatet vocabulis, ut conjectare plerunque me oporteat, quid sibi velint tua
verba.

3. Nescio an inusitatum ejusmodi sermonem gratum ^uiquam existimes; sciveris
tamen tantum mihi displicere, quantum literatis placet Cicero.

4. Pluris multo facerem protritas and proculcatas dictiones, quam priscas
illas, quae nec tibi frugem afferunt, nec eruditis voluptatem.

5. Proinde (si me ames) Phavorinum sequere consulentem, ut verbis utamur
praesentibus, and moribus priscis vivamus. Vale.

Epist. 13.
1. NUper mihi quidam retulerunt, eo te impudentiae conscendisse, ut jam non
erubescas cum ganeonibus perdit issimisque patrimoniorum decoctoribus
conversari, qui omnia prandiorum gurgitibus absumunt and abliguriunt.

2. Quod ubi primum accepi, non potui a lachrymis temperare; adeo me tuae
calamitatis miseruit.

3. Quid autem de patre tuo loquar? vix certe fidem impetrarem, si verbis
vellem consequi quantum se distorqueat, and excruciet.

4. Miror quod te non pudeat tuae immanitatis, qui decrepitum illum, morti and
capulo vicinum, and jam in Proserpinae (quod dicitur) peculio numero numeratum
sic affligas; qui ab amore tui nunquam ne latum quidem unguem recessisse visus
est.

5. Egeris ut voles, nunquam tamen satyras, virulenta linguarum verbera
declinabis, quantisper ad bonam frugem te receperis. Vale.

Epist. 14.
1. QUi miseriam sibi fabricant, and asciam cruribus suis illidunt, si forte
fortuna in discrimen aliquod impegerint, non est quod cuiquam irascantur, aut
in alios quam seipsos acerbitatis suae virus evomant.

2. Tu, ubi satis Veneri and gulae indulsisti, virtutesque omnes, reclamantibus
nequicquam amicis, a te relegasti, eo tandem miseriae redactus es, ut quorsum
te vertas, aut quem implores, nescias.

3. Quis, quaeso, in culpa? Nonne certatim omnes hoc ipsum praediximus tibi
futurum?

4. Verba nostra contemptui tibi fuerunt and ludibrio.

5. Nunc si tua unius causa infortunium feras, patienter patere. Vale.

Epist. 15.
1. INcredebilis me tenet admiratio, quod crescentibus annis nihilo plus
sapias, quam cum in puerilibus balbutires cunabulis.

2. Nemo est adeo delirans animi, quem suae tandem s^ultitiae non poeniteat.

3. Te vero nec piget, nec pudet, rebus tuis etiam pessum ^untibus, cunctisque
naso te suspendentibus, and postic^ ^ludentibus sanna, quod nuces nondum
reliqueris.

4. Dic, quaeso, quonam modo apud parents super vitia ratiocinabere, nisi his
ignorantiae tenebris emergas?

5. Fuerat nobis in summa votorum been semper de te mereri, teque nullo non
honoris genere prosequi.

6. Videreturne tibi vacantis operae, si his obedires, qui tuae satagunt
utilitatis?

7. Hactenus quanta maxima potui benevolentia te monui.

8. Verum, nisi blandis hujusmodi verbis animus tuus remollescat, praeceps in
convitia mutabo, tuisque (quod dici solet) te pingam coloribus. Vale.

Epist. 16.
1. NEscio quid in patrem deliqueris, tamen nudiusquartus, cum epistolam tuam
me praesente legeret, visus est mihi frontem caperare.

2. Est enim credibile, aut barbarismum reperisse, aut aliquod aliud
ignorantiae tuae fecisse periculum.

3. Da operam, quaeso, ut eum in amore tui contineas, ejusque indignationem
exarmes.

4. Quod erit tibi factu facile, si quid in bonis literis te profecisse viderit.

5. Haec ego jampridem tacit and in aurem tibi dixeram: iterum dico, ne
posthac excusationis veniam fore tibi confidas.

6. Observare debes quantum hactenus te dilexerit, cum nihil unquam tibi deesse
permiserit.

7. Nisi feceris quod moneo, pessime rebus tuis video consultum iri: nam
praeter ludibrium, quo affi^ieris, amici tui omnes te deserent, quod si fiat,
quomodo vives, nullo manum porrigente? Vale.

Epist. 17.
1. EO for as, quando rediturus nescio: quam citissime tamen potero, redibo.

2. Commendo tibi rem domesticam.

3. Suffragium meum demereberis, si me absente sine tumultu omnia, and citra
pulveris jactum sese habeant.

4. Ita vivas, ut nihil in te notatu dignum percipiant liberi mei.

5 H^bent enim nasum, and haec propius observant, quae deteriora su^t.

6. Si ^u^ flagitio succumbas, reminiscentur, nec te poterunt rev^^eri, quem
crimini obnoxium cognoverunt.

7. Quod si inculpatam tuam vitam perceperint, non solum mandatis tuis
assurgent, sed and aspectum reformidabunt. Vale.

Epist. 18.
1. PUerum habeo eleganti forma, and ingenio facili: quem, quoniam magnam spem
futurae virtutis pollicetur, studio literarum devovere constitui, and tuae
primum committere disciplinae.

2. Si quid sub te profecerit, faciam ut tui te laboris non poeniteat.

3. Si quid fortasse tibi offerat, nolo ut assem quidem, aut eo plus, in
muneribus ab illo accipias.

4. Laboribus tuis cumulate and largo foenore satisfaciam, si modo eum talem
reddas, qui aliquando sua doctrina amicos omnes ab in juria mortalitatis
asserat, and oblivionis.

5. Quod faciet, si tantum docendi illum desiderium te teneat, quanto discendi
ille trahitur. Vale.

Epist. 19.
1. NEscio quo pacto alienae semper calamitatis teneat me commiseratio:
quotiescunque tamen amici^ mei quid detrimenti capiunt, aut fortunae flagellis
vapulant and confodiuntur, eorum jactura non minus animum meum everberat, quam
si ipse naufragium facerem, aut meis quoque rebus pessime viderem consultum.

2. Propterea cum videam famam tuam indies periclitari, me oportet (ut dolori
satisfaciam, and animus meus conquiescat) rebus tuis manum dare.

3. Omnes magnopere tristamur, quod perditissimis quibusdam and libidinis
compertae nebulonibas adhaereas, qui neque Deum timent neque homines reverentur.

4 Qui si corruptis suis moribus aliquanto diutius te inebriaverint, jam nullam
tui liberandi spem relinques, and actum erit de tuo nomine.

5. Sin eorum vinculis propere te eximas, adhuc morbo tuo mederi poterimus.

6. Et quamvis primi tui mores patri stomachum moverint, tamen velit nolit ab
eo veniam extorquebimus, modo in hisce longius morari desinas, and meam
expectationem non destituas.

7. Per me non stabit, quo minus in parentum amorem redeas.

8. Dii faciant, ut nostra haec exhortatio aliquem tuae menti relinquat
aculeum! Vale, and verborum meorum memineris.

Epist. 20.
1. AMo te plus quam capiat humanae mentis conjectura, Corneli suavissime,
neque est mihi frequentius votum, quam ut tuae semper voluntati respondeat
fortuna, and omnia ex animi tui sententia consequare: and si scirem mea opera
tibi esse opus, accommodarem me tuis rebus, usque ad aras.

2. Cum tamen venit in mentem canescentis illius and decrepiti parentis tui,
quem non sine nota and postica multorum ^anna turpissime reliquisti, nequeo
mihi temperare, quo minus ingratitudini tuae irascar, vel (ut verius dicam)
impietati.

3. Quid enim inhumanius debet dici, quam si trementem senio, and morbis
affectum, parentem filius gravatim videat, nedum non adjuvet, cum ratione
carentibus brutis, modicisque animantibus hoc ipsum sit odiosum?

4. Ciconiae genitricum senectam invicem educant.

5. Glires genitores suos, fessos senecta, alunt insigni pietate.

6. Quid autem haec testimonia exemplis praepono domesticis ac vernaculis?

7. Canes ipsi alumnos sua morte mutantur saepe numero: a quibus tamen nil
praeter vilissimam stipem (utpote modica panis, idque hordeacei fragmenta)
suscipiunt.

8. Neque moveris, tuam ipsius naturam videri brutis deteriorem.

9. Quis hoc non execretur? quis temperet invectivis?

10. Pater tuus assidue languet; nulla non hora laborat morbo, and capris ipsis
(quod aiunt) est febriculosior: neque tamen morienti dextram porrigis.

Dii immortales, ut jam exulat probitas! ut pessum iere boni mores, cum jam
natos nihil parentum misereat.

12. Dic bona fide, si nunc epulari laute, si abunde rerum omnium tibi
suppetit, id ipsum cui acceptum referri convenit, nisi patri, cui vitam ipsam
debes etiamnum?

13. Meditarisne impudentissime, quid de te vicatim praedicetur, aut quanto
tibi crimini vertatur, cum nitida and been curata cute ac probe saginato
corpore incedis ampullosus, patre tuo jam semi-mortuo?

14. Mortuam muraenam flevit Hortensius Orator multos dies atratus; tu patris
morientis non miserebere?

15. O mala tempora! O perditam aetatem! velim, nolim, taceam oportet.

16. Plura enim dicere non permittit animi aegritudo.

17. Superest tantum, ut resipiscas, aut non aegre feras si ab amore tui
recessero. Vale.

FINIS.
