BY THE Lord Lieutenant AND Council of Ireland.
ESSEX.

WE the Lord Lieutenant and Council being informed, that both at the Assizes
and Sessions held in several Countyes of this Kingdom, diverse sums of money
have been of late years levied under Pretense of presentiments from the Grand
Iuryes in such Countyes, in diverse cases, where the same are not by Law
warranted, with the payment whereof, his Majesty's Subjects have been unjustly
charged, and the money so raised has been many times converted to private
uses, for Remedy whereof and for the Ease of his Majesty's good Subjects
herein, we have thought sit hereby to require all Judges of Assize and Justices
of Peace in the several Countyes of this Kingdom, to take special Care at the
several Assizes and Sessions to be held by them respectively, that no
presentiments of any Grand Iuryes be received or allowed of, nor any Orders
given thereupon for the raising or leying any sums of money upon the Country,
but in such Cases only where such presentiments are by the Laws and Statutes
of force in this Realm warranted. And we do hereby further declare, That incase
any person or persons shall presume to give Order for the raising or levying
any sum or sums of money upon the Country, under Color of any such illegal
presentiments from any Grand Iuryes, that upon Complaint and due proof made
thereof at this Board, We shall give Order for proceeding against them in such
manner as the nature of so great an Offense does require.
