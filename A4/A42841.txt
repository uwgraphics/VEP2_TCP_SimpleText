AN ELEGY.
I.
Convulsed with Grief, whilst Nature's Organs strain,
At last I Am forced to breath a Vein;
Or break it must with what it cannot contain*
A Vein Elegiack, I mean,
A Flood of Tributary Verse,
Sacred, and fitted to Rehearse
Britannia's Fate,
And from its Date
The like Convulsions in the Church and State.
II.
Albion! Unhappy Isle! what thou have lost
Defies the Richest Ages to repair;
A Queen that Buoyed thy sinking Honor up,
Who whilst She held the Regal Chair,
Suckl'd thy Hectic Church and State,
Both Languid grown and Ripe for Fate:
She! Great by Nature, Birth, and Education,
Over looked the Envy of thy Pievish Nation;
Yet Loved thee so,
And Pitied too,
As to disturb her solid Ease,
With Anxious Cares about thy Peace
Her Generous Soul was always bent
About the Peaceful Arts of Government;
And when the unhappy Exigence
Of War Recalled her Royal Consort hence;
Above the Reason of her Sex,
She Taught the Board a Scheme of Politics,
When to Resolve, How to Debate;
And where to bound Reason of State:
The want of which, and which alone,
Has Widowed many a Realm,
And Emptied many a Throne.
III.
Whilst this Incomparable Lady stood,
Blessed with a Natural Delight in Good;
She could not pass Religion by,
But Understood, and Kend that too,
And Loved, and Practiced what she knew:
Those that have her Devotion seen,
Thought her an Abbess, not a Queen:
And as she could to Heaven Bow,
She could be humble to her Subjects too,
Great and not Proud, Affable and not Base,
All over Decorum, All over Grace;
Never were Virtues so well fixed,
Never Passions so well mixed,
Never Nature so alloy'd,
So well tempered, so employed,
That 'twill be difficult to find
Amongst the Inferior Sex behind,
So Great a Soul, and so Sedate a Mind.
IV.
If these Conspicuous Virtues could Revoke,
And Prayers could Intercept a high Decree,
Or stop the Sin-born Monster's stroke;
Those Balmy Orisons which went,
Dear Saint! in Hecatombs to Heaven for thee,
From Pious Prelates most familiar there,
Must needs have changed Divine Assent,
And kept thee here
To Crown us many a happy Year.
But all the Incense, all the Suppliant Oils,
From City Altars, and from Rural Piles,
From Prelates Censers too the Vows which we
Put up when Albion was one Censory;
Although they were our All,
Were too too small
A Bidding for the fixed Decree.
V.
But now the Fatal Signal's given,
The complicated Evil's joined;
She took the best Viaticum for Heaven,
And then lay down,
Her Life resigned,
With that Serenity of Mind
With which she took the Crown:
Stripped into naked Spirit, up she Climb
From all this muddy Continent of Time,
By Angels Guarded from new Fears,
Wrapped in a Cloud of Balmy Dew,
Leaving her Kingdoms drowned in Tears,
Away to Heaven She flew.
FINIS.
