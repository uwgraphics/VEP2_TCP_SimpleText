KENTISH DICK; OR, THE Lusty Coachman of Westminster.
With an Account how he Tickled the Young Lasses, and caused their sad
Lamentation.
Tune of, Let Mary live long.
Licensed according to Order.









IN Westminster town,
you there may discover,
a wavering lover;
The tawny and brown,
as well as the fair,
He will commonly court,
He is right for the sport:
a Coachman by trade,
Stout brawny young Richard,
Stout brawny young Richard,
a delicate blade.
He came out of Kent,
with delicate triming,
for pleasing young women;
He give's them content,
wherever he goes:
He Will have at them all,
Both the short and the tall,
and follows the trade:
His name is stout Richard,
His name is stout Richard,
a brawny young blade.


He Is loath to be tied,
to any one woman;
he love's to live common,
The name of a bride,
he cannot endure:
When he is weary of one,
To another he will run,
now this is the trade
Of lusty stout Richard,
Of lusty stout Richard,
that dexterous blade.
He Is wanton and wild,
a Stallion he passes,
and five or six lasses,
Are gotten with child
by him, as I hear;
Yet he will marry with none,
Though they make their sad moan,
but does them degrade:
A brawny young fellow,
A brawny young fellow,
a dexterous blade.
Dear Richard, one cries,
behold my condition,
with humble submission,
And watery eyes,
your love I entreat,
Tell me, when we shall wed?
You have my maidenhead.
he does her degrade,
And swears he will not marry,
And swears he will not marry,
no impudent jade.
She told him again*
when first he did use her,
he would not abuse her*
Yet this was in vain,
like Hector he swore,
That he would never be tied,
To any one bride:
thus did he degrade,
The poor loving creature,
The poor loving creature,
that once was a maid,
A horrible crime,
some says, their is seven,
and others eleven,
At this very time,
with child by this spark;
Who does waddle about,
For to find the knave out,
that does them degrade:
He cries he has knickt it,
He cries he has knickt it,
an impudent blade.
We^ll geld him says one,
of nutmegs we'll free him,
if ever we see him,
Or he will overrun
all maids of the town:
Let Us sever from him,
That unruly limb,
which did us degrade;
He is, I must tell you,
He is, I must tell you,
an impudent blade.
