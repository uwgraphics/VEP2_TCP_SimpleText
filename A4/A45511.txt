This may be Printed,

R. P.



^WHy are my Eyes still Flow -- ing? Why does my heart thus trembling move?
^Why do I sigh when go -- ing? To see the Darling Saint I Love: ^Ah! she is my
Heaven, and in her Eyes, The Dei -- ty, There is no Life ^Like what she can
give, Nor any Death like taking my Leave.

I.
Tell me no more of Glo -- ry,
to Courts Ambition i have resigned,
But tell a long long Sto -- ry,
of Celia's shape her face and mind:
Speak too of Raptures that will Life destroy,
to En -- joy,
Had I a Diadem Scepter and Ball,
For that dear minute i would part with them all.
II.
Why am I not enjoy -- ing
my self, delighting in thy Arms?
My painful Love destroy -- ing,
with killing pleasures from thy Charms:
Come, come dear Celia, now let Storms be gone,
and o -- ver-blown;
There Is no delight like thy transporting Love,
No joy below, what e're there is above.
IV.
Why does my heart thus grieve -- me,
as I lie panting on my Bed?
Why does my hopes deceive -- me,
when cruel Fates pronounce me dead?
Speak, speak dear Saint, and by those conquering eyes
that -- surprise:
Give, give me favor in thy sight again,
Or kill me quite to ease my pain.
V.
Her ANSWER.
HOw can I seek to co -- ver
a flaming heart overwhelmed with grief?
See, see a Constant Lo -- ver,
thus fainting, plead for some Relief!
No, no, Aminta, cease now to implore,
sigh -- no more:
Had I ten thousand hearts in my Breast,
I Would part with all to give my Love rest.
VI.
Why does Aminta sigh -- ing,
think I will Coyly Love deface?
But can there be deny -- ing,
to such a Person, such a Grace?
Ah! such becoming-Boldness too is found,
to -- be Crowned,
That no fair Nymph that lives upon the Plain,
Can have a heart to give my Dear pain.
VII.
Amint.] Who can express the joy -- ing,
that my poor heart does leaping find?
Fly hence all heart-annoy -- ing,
and fatal grief, for Celia's kind:
Come then dear Celia, let us now enjoy,
Cael.] Ay, dear -- est Ay;
While we have Breath let Mortals wonder this,
Envy they may, but not spoil our Bliss.
