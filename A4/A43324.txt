of the LORD.

AN EPISTLE TO Friends, etc.
FRIENDS,
YOU unto whom the Lord has appeared in this his day, in his eternal,
inexpressible Love, and has given you the knowledge of his Truth, and streched
out unto you the Arm of his Power, and made known unto you the Way of
Salvation: You it is, whom my endeared and unfeighned Love is flowing forth
unto, which does not consist in any thing that is visible but in that pure
unchangable Love of God which h^ has shed abroad in our hearts. And so in
that, you are often presented before me, and often do I remember you with a
deep sense of your conditions, and of the unspeakable Love of God to you-wards,
and withal, of the manifold Temptations and Trialls you dally come to meet
withal; and then is my heart poured out before the Lord with breathings and
supplications, that you may persevere in faith-fullness and stedfastness, and
that you may be preserved in and through them all; and there is a certain
assureance in my heart, that the Lord will do it unto all those that abide in
the Faith, waiting upon him continually in his Light; and that he will not
leave them, nor permit to come upon them beyond their abillity, nor yet more
then will tend to their good.

So dear Friends, keep closs to the Light, and feel the Power of God, and abide
in it, and let it be your daily care to remain in the Awe and Fear of God
continually; that so you may come more and more to feel the leadings and
guidings of the Lord in his Light, and that you wait at all times to know his
Will and Counsel, and to feel his leadings therein: That so none may run before
the Lord his Leader, but to fee^ Him go before, and to lead in the Way you
should walk in, and in those things that concerns the Truth of God; that so you
may still be pr^served in that, in which the Peace of God truly comes to be
felt. For Friends, This is a thing of great weight, and far surpasses all that
is visible and transitory, so that you all may be kept waiting continually in
the Light, upon the Lo^d, to feel the Power and Virtue of it daily and to enjoy
it, and that you may come to dwell in it in steadfastness without wavering: And
this is that for which my labor is, and for which my desire often times with
deep Sighings and Breathings to the Lord is, that you may he kept and preserved
in those dark places of the earth, where you have your Callings, and that you
may be an Honor and Praise to him in your Generation, and that you may be
refresh^d and consolated by his Living Presence more and more.

Oh Friends! How precious is it to feel the presence of God unto Ref^eshment
and Consolation, but his pre^ence is terrible unto those that are found in
Iniquity and Unfaithfulness Therefore Dear Friends, take heed of all that, that
would draw you out from the constant and diligent watching in the Light, and to
have a strict regard thereunto; and of that Spirit that would run out into
visions and openings of the Truth, before the Leader; for that is that which is
Impatient, Rash, Hasty and Unstable; and so that cannot hold out long but is
soon weary, and quickly offended and troubled, when things does not always
fall out according to that m^nd; and so there is no perfect satisfaction, but
it is wearying it self, now in this, and then in the other thing, and this
cannot stand in the day of trial. But Friends, Dwell low in the feeling of the
pure measure of God, and feel the Spirit of the Lamb that bears and suffers,
and hold fast the Faith in the Light, and cleave unto it with your whole
hearts, that patience may possess your Souls, that so you may feel the
plentious peace and satisfaction therein. And Friends, Take heed of many
consultations and thoughts, concerning things which you cannot see through nor
comprehend, for if that gets place in the heart, that brings a burden upon the
mind, that darkens and vails, and greives the Righteous Seed of God, but in all
things be careful that your minds may be kept con^inually out of all such
things, in that that opens the understanding, and makes the heart tender; for
that is that which must preserve in that state. And so Dear Friends, there is
an enemy near, against whom it is greatly needful to watch continually, that so
the mind may be kept Single, Pure and Clean; and so that you may feel more and
more these things, and to enjoy the Comfort and Consolation in your selves,
when the mind is kept single and clean of all Encumbrances; and Reasonings, and
Consultations about things which you cannot discern nor under stand, and leave
it to the Lord who is only Wise, and knows every ones Condition, Sat, and
Capacity; who watches over his own, as a Father does over his Children,
teaching and instructing every one according to their growth and abillity, of
those things that are his Will concerning them. And Friends, Take heed of that
Spirit that still will seek to excuse himself, and to diminish and hide that
which is not well, and to lay the charge and fault upon another, to clear
himself by so doing; this is the Spirit of the world, and is out of Truth, and
by the Truth, the Light of God it is condemned. This is he that appeared in
Adam and Eve in the beginning after the Fall: And so Friends, You who are called
to come out of the Fall, let nothing that is of that spirit and nature be
cherished nor regarded, but that all may be judged in the Light, which is
springing forth of that Ground, the cursed Ground in which the Thorns and
Briars, and the Weeds grows, and let the Fire consume it: So Dear Friends,
keep nothing back, nor excuse nothing, nor diminish it not, that cannot stand
in the Light and Truth of God, but is Condemned and must be so for ever.

And Friends, Take heed of that, which when there is any thing done or spoken
as in a sense of Truth, that will to much be seen and looked upon in it, and
boast in it; this is that which seeks self, and not the honor of God; but give
you no place to that, for that will run when the Lord sends not, and will be
doing of that which the Lord requires not; so there ought to be a continual
watch against that: And you still abiding in the true sense and feeling, you
come still to feel what the Lord requires, and what he leads you unto; and so
there Consolation and Peace is felt, and this does not lift up but keeps low
and sensible of the goodness of God, and that breaks and tenders the heart, and
overcomes it.

And so this is that which every one ought to wait for in himself, to feel it,
that so you may be as obedient Children, that are minding the instructions and
directions of the Father continually. And Friends, Watch against that which
would be striving to comprehend, and know, and understand much, before it be
the Lords time and pleasure; for that is the same Spirit that is in the World,
but wait low in the feeling of the Light and the Power, and dwell in it; that
so what you know and understand of the Truth, and the things of it you may know
in the Light, by the Revelation of the Lord therein: And this is that which is
lasting, though never so little; and though such be as little Children, that as
it were know nothing at all, yet it is precious to keep in that state, and not
to run, not to be busy, not to will, but to be quietly waiting upon the Lord,
to feel his Power, to feel his Arm, to preserve and to lead, and to know him to
be the Guide and Leader, who leads gently the little ones, and bears the
Sucklings in his Arms, and keeps and preserves them from that which would
bruise and hurt them.

So Dear Friends, Your Strength, your Preservation and Salvation is in the
Lord, and therefore keep your selves close to his Light, and embrace it with a
perfect heart, and cleave unto it with your whole strength, and let it not go,
neither let any thing have place in your hearts that is against it; and where
there is any thing yet remaining in the heart, which is felt not to be in un^ty
with it, give your selves no rest, till you feel the Judgment of God set a top
over it in your hearts, and then let it be freely refined up unto the
Judgment, that so, not an enemy to the Truth and to your own Souls, may be
left alive in the house.

So Dear Friends, This is in true Love unto you, from one who has experience
of these things concerning which I have wrote unto you, as in a weighty sense
that has been upon my heart for a considerable time, and I could not well
forbear longer, but must communicate it unto you, in a fresh and living ^ence
of the Love of God, and of Love unfeigned; which often flows forth to
you-wards, as an overflowing st^eam, who are called (...) the Lord, and to whom
the Lord has stretched forth his Arm of Mercy and Love. Oh Friends! Dwell in
that which preserves Love and Unity amongst the Children of the household of
God, that so th^re may be no place amongst you for discord, or any thing of
that nature; neither let any thoughts enter the heart, which you dare not
declare in words, for is it such as that you dare not make i^ known? Then they
are things that ought to have no place in the heart, though many times such
things may present themselves in the thoughts, but it ought to have no place,
for it will hurt, though ^t may appear with some show of Truth or Good in it,
or of a good tendency, but the end is seen in the Light, that it does not
proceed out of the Light: And so Friends, waiting in the Light, you will daily
more and more, come to see the subtle workings of the enemy in the heart, which
is the desire of my Soul, and that you may be preserved and kept out of his
Snares.

So Friends, I have no other thing to which I can commit you, but to the Lord,
who is able to preserve you and to ke^p you out of all the cunning devices of
Satan; yea, and I am persuaded that he will do it, to all those that
perseveres in the Faith, in his Light, in faithfulness, steadfast unto the end;
so that you all may be preserved and established in the everlasti^g Truth, and
may endure to the end, that so none having put his hand to the Plough may look
back, that is the earnest longing and desire of may heart.

So the Lord God of Power, who alone is our Strength, Power and Refuge,
establish your minds more and more in his Light, and your hearts more and more
in the Faith, and continually to wait upon him in his Light, and to confirm
your confidence in him; that so, you may run and not be weary, and walk on and
faint not: That so Peace, Rest, Comfort and Consolation may be multiplied
amongst you from the Lord. To whom be Glory, and Honor, and Praises, for ever.

From your true Friend in the Truth, Elizabeth Hendericks.
