THE Mournful Mite.
BEING A POEM On the Death of King CHARLES II.
STANZA I.
LAtely I looked up to promotions Sky;
Where I did Espy
The Sun and Moon of Britains Church and State
(Ah rigid Fate)
Eclipsed in Majesty.
II.
Amazed I Sighed, and pried within the Scene,
Beholding Charles-wain:
The Via Lactea seemed to shrink away;
Night acted Day,
And Tears did flow Amain.
III.
I went to Black, but formerly White Hall,
To know the Original:
In Threnodyes they Sung; Our Royal Head
Is Cold and Dead;
Our Pomp turned Tragical.
IV.
I Sighed for Charles our King the Great and Good,
And Cried a Loud:
But (when I feared to sink in Seas of Grief)
Found no Relief;
Tears but increased the Flood.
V.
Yet (when the Sable Curtain was laid by)
I heard a Cry.
The Eclips not Total is (we trust)
For now the Shadow Flies;
And from the Phaenix precious Dust
A Phoebus does Arise:
And then I wiped mine Eyes.
FINIS.
