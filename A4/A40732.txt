THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE Protestant Religion DEFINED, According to the
Scripture, and Judgment of the most Learned and Orthodox Divines in England.

Isa. 11. 9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the
earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
Isa. 2. 2, 3. And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of
the Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be
exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people
shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the
house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk
in his path; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem. Prove. 10. 21. The lips of the righteous feed many; but fools

THere are two Principles that concern Man's first Estate.

1. That God made Man at first, after his own Image, Genesis 1. 26. 1 Cor. 11. 7.
Col. 3. 10.

2. That the Image of God consisted chiefly in Knowledge, Holiness and
Righteousness, Eccl. 7. 29. Ephesians. 4. 24.

CHAP. VI. Of the Fall of Man, so of the second Estate of Man. Eccl. 7. 29.
THe Misery of Man fallen, must be considered two ways.

1. In the Cause of it.

2. In the Parts of it.

1. The Cause of it, was the fall of our first Parents; concerning which, are
three Principles.

1. That our first Parents fell and lost speedily the happiness in which they
were created, Genesis 3. 7. etc. And thus they did lose God, Paradise, and God's
Image; and that they lost it speedily, in that the Devil [one of the fallen
Angels, which fell before Man did, Jude 6. 2 Pet. 2.] is called a Murderer from
the beginning, John 8. 44. And the fault being presently related after the
Story of his Innocence in the Creation, Genesis 3. 10.

2. That this loss befell them only, for their own grievous Sin, Genesis 3. Romans 5.
12. Eccl. 7. 29.

3. That by their Sin we are all defiled, and deprived of the Glory of God,
Romans 5. 12, 18, 19. Of Original Sin, see Job 14. 4. Ephesians. 2. 3. Genesis 5. 3. with
Genesis 1. 6. Psalm 51. 5. Ephesians. 4. 22. Romans 7. 7. -- 8. 13. Jam. 1. 14. It Is seat
is the whole Man, and the whole of Man, Romans 3. 10, to 18. It has its
Privative part, that is, want of original Righteousness, Romans 3. 10, 11, 12.
2dly, Positive, that is, Inclination to all Evil, Romans 3. 14, 15, 16. and Jam.
1. 14. Romans 7. 7.

CHAP. VII. Of Sin. Romans 5. 12.
HItherto of the Cause of our Misery; the Parts follow, viz. 1. Sin^^ 2.
Punishment. The Princiciples concerning Sin, are five.

2. That the nature of Man is stained with Sin from the Birth, Job 14. 4. --
15. 14. Psalm 51. 5. See before, about original Sin.

3. That all Men sinned in Adam, Psalm. 51. 5. Romans 5. 12.

4. That this Infection has overspread the whole Nature of Man, hence called
the old Man, Ephesians. 4. 22. The Nature of Man is tainted with fourteen Evils.

1. The first is in Col. 1. 13.

2. The second, Ephesians. 4. 18.

12. The twelfth, Ephesians. 2. 2.

13. The thirteenth, Corruption of memory, forgetting Good, and retaining Evil.

14. The fourteenth, Jam. 1. 14.

5. That besides these Sins, which stick fast upon our Natures, every Man is
guilty of horrible, and many vile actual Sins Psalm. 14. 1, 2, 3. Job 15. 15,

CHAP. IX. Of the Estate of Grace. Ephesians. 1. 4.
HItherto of the Estate of Man. The third state, is the Estate of Grace, which
is three ways to be considered, 1. In respect of the means of the foundation of
it. 2. In respect of the Subject of the Possesssion of it, which is the Church.
3. In respect of the degrees of Application, and Manifestation of it, which are
two, viz. Justification and Sanctification. 1. The means of foundation of it,
is twofold: 1. Election in God. 2. Redemption by Christ. Concerning Election,
there are these five Principles.

1. That there was a Choice and Election made by God, Ephesians. 1. 4.

2. That this Choice was before the World was, Ephesians. 1. 4. Romans 9. 11.

3. That some Men were chosen, not all; if all were taken, how could there be
Election? Mat. 20. 16. -- 22. 14.

4. That the Cause of our Election, is only the free Grace of God, not Faith or
Works foreseen, Ephesians. 1. 5. Romans 9. 15, 18.

5. That God's Election is unchangeable; all the Elect shall be saved, Romans 8.
30. Isa. 46. 10. 2 Timothy 2. 19. John 6. 37. Matthew. 25. 34. Romans 11. 29. John 10.
28, 29. It Is an eternal Decree of God; whereby he freely and infallibly
appointed for the Glory of his Name, to bring some Men to Glory by Christ, Ephesians.
1. 4, 5, 6.

CHAP. X.
HItherto of Election. The second fundamental Means of Grace, is Christ;
concerning whom the Principles respect, either, 1. His Person. 2. His Office.
The Principles concerning his Person, looks either, 1. On his Divine, 2. or
upon his Humane Nature. The Principles concerning his Divine Nature, are

1. That he is very God, proved,

1. By the Testimony of Scripture, Isa. 9. 6. 1 Timothy 3. 16. Romans 9. 5. John 1.
1. 1 John 5. 20. Genesis 3. 9, 16. Jer. 23. 6. Heb. 1. 8.

2. By Divine Properties given unto him; as Eternity, John 1. 1. -- 17. 5.
Omnipotency, John 3. 31. Phil. 3. 21. -- 4. 13. Omnisciency, Heb. 4. 13. John
2. 25. Savior, John 4. 42. King of kings, etc. Rev. 19. 16.

3. by Divine works done by him, as Creation, Col. 1. 16. Forgiveness of Sins,
Matthew. 9. 6. working of Miracles, John 10. 25. beginning and carrying on the
work of Grace in his, Heb. 12. 2. and glorifying of them, John 17. 22. Mat. 25.
34.

4. By Divine Honor due to him; as Adoration, Psalm 45. 11. Heb. 1. 6. and
believing in him, John 14. 1. Acts 13. 39. praying to him.

5. By the Conquest, the Gospel has made in the Work, 1 Timothy 3. 16. and that
not by any carnal Power, Zech. 4. 6.

6. Matthew. 28. 18.

7. Psalm 68. 18. with Ephesians. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12.

8. His making the Gospel efficacious to the Conversion of Sinners, Psalm 45.
6. Acts 11. 18.

9. Revel. 1. 18.

10. John 10. 28.

11. 2 Timothy 4. 1. It was needful our Mediator should be God.

12. The patient Sufferings of the Saints, Rev. 12. 11.

1. Because our Evil was so great, which no Creature could take off us, viz. 1.
Sin. 2. Gods Wrath. 3. Death. 4. Satan's Tyranny.

2. Because the greatness of our Good, which none but God could restore; viz.
1. An Obedience to justify many. 2. The Image of God, 1 Cor. 1. 30. Col. 3. 10.

CHAP. XI. Of Christ's Humane Nature.
THere are four Principles concerning it.

1. That the Son of God was incarnate, did assume the Nature of Man, and was
very Man amongst us, John 1. 14. Heb. 2. 14.

2. That he was not conceived as other Men, but by the Holy Ghost, Luke 1. 35.
Matthew. 1. 20.

3. That he was born of a Virgin, Isa. 7. 14. Matthew. 1. 18. Genesis 3. 15.

4. That his Human Nature did subsist in the Divine Nature, and so both made
but one Person, (as Soul and Body make but one Person) Col. 2. 9. Luke 1. 35.
He is Man,

1. That Satisfaction might be made to God in the same Nature that offended.

2. Because, else he could not dye.

3. And without that, no Pardon, Heb. 9. 22.

4. Because a Mediator should be mete to deal between both Parties, therefore
he is God, for the business with the Father and Man, for the business with Men.

5. Might have the right of Kinsman to redeem us, and so of Adoption, Jer. 32.
8. Ruth 3. 12.

CHAP. XII. Of Christ as Mediator.
HItherto concerning the Person of Christ; his Office follows. The Principles
concerning his Office, consider it in the whole, or in the part of it; the
whole Office of Christ is to be a Mediator; and so the Principles which concern
the Mediatorship, are five.

1. That there is but one Mediator between God and Man, viz. Christ, 1 Timothy 2.
5. Acts 4. 12. Luke 2. 11. See his Qualification, Heb. 2. 17. -- 7. 25.

2. That our Salvation by his Mediation, is merit, desert in Man, but Grace in
God and Christ, 2 Timothy 1. 9. Tit. 3. 4, 5. Ephesians. 2. 8. Romans 3. 24.

3. That this Mediation was from the beginning of the World, and shall be to
the end, Heb. 13. 8. 1 Pet. 1. 20. Rev. 13. 8. The time when this Mediator was
given, was,

1. If we respect God's Decree, he was given before the World, Ephesians. 1. 4.

2. If we respect the Virtue and Efficacy of his Mediation, he was given when
need was, from the beginning of the World, Rev. 13. 8.

3. If we respect his Manifestation in the Flesh, he was given in the fullness
of time, above 1600 years ago, Gal. 4. 4. 1 Timothy 2. 6.

4. That without the Mediation of Christ, no Flesh can be saved, Acts 4. 12.
Psalm. 134. 2. Jam. 3. 2.

5. That by the Mediator, a new Covenant, Agreement, or Contract, was made by
God with Man, Jer. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 13. Romans 3. 23, 24. Gal. 3. 21, 22. For the
meaning of this,

Note, 1. That the Scripture speaks of four, that God has made one with all
Creatures, Genesis 9. But of this we have nothing to do here.

2. A Covenant between the Father and Son, which one expresses thus: Methinks,
says he, I hear the Father say, Son, here I have chosen a certain number of
fallen Men, they are Enemies to me; if you will assume their Nature, and
satisfy my Law and Justice, and restore my Image, bring them to Faith and
Repentance, I will pardon, adopt and glorify them. He makes Heb. 10. 7. to be
Christ's answer to the Father, so the Agreement was made, Isa. 42. 6.

3. A Covenant of Works; this was made with all mankind in Paradise, and
stands still in force since the fall, as Men are in the Estate of Nature; the
Conditions whereof on Man's part, is the moral Law.

4. Man by his fall being made incapable of Life by that Covenant, God was
pleased to make a Covenant or Agreement with Man, by means of the Mediator, and
gives unto them the Conditions of it, as Faith, Repentance, sincere Obedience,
Ephesians. 2. 8. 2 Timothy 2. 26. Acts 11. 18. -- 5. 31. Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27. and eternal
Life, and all Good. God engaged in this Covenant to give to all those that
believe, etc. which is called the Covenant of Grace; This was called from the
fall to Abraham's time, the Promise; being contrived in those words of Promise,
Genesis 3. 15. from Abraham to Moses, the Covenant, Genesis 17. 7. From Moses to
Christ, and so still, the Testament, and as it stands in difference from the
Covenant of Works, it may be called for all this time, the Covenant of Grace.

2. That in this Covenant, the Mediator did undertake for two things.

1. To pay all our Debts, and satisfy Gods Justice by a Price of infinite
Value, Isa. 53. 5, 6. Job 33. 24. 1 Timothy 2. 6.

2. To Purchase and Merit for us Gods Favor and Kingdom by a most absolute and
perfect Obedience, Ephesians. 1. 6. Romans 5. 19. Mat. 3. 15.

3. We must understand wherein the Covenant of Works and Grace differ and agree.

1. They agree in two things.

1. Both tendered to us by God.

2. Both require a full and perfect Righteousness, as the condition of Eternal
Life.

2. They differ.

1. In the manner of knowing them, the 1. is known. in some measure by Nature,
Romans 2. 15. the 2 d not, Col. 1. 26. 1 Cor. 2. 7. 2 Timothy 1. 10.

2. In the Ministers of both, John 1. 17.

3. In the means attaining the end common to both; the first requires doings
for Life, Romans 10. 5. The second, Faith, Romans 3. 21. -- 4. 5. Acts 16. 31. --
13. 39. John 3. 16. The Law requires perfect, and perpetual, and universal
Righteousness in our own Persons, Gal. 3. 10. The Gospel offers this personal,
perfect, perpetual, universal Righteousness of another to be received, and is
ours by Faith, Romans 8. 3, 4. -- 3. 22. -- 5. 19. -- 10. 4. Dan. 9. 24. 1 Pet.
1. 19. Matthew. 3. 15.

4. In effect, Efficacy; the first requires Works, but gives no Power to do
them, Deuteronomy. 29. 4. The second gives the Spirit which works what God requires,
Jer. 31. 33. Ezekiel. 36. 27. 1 Cor. 3. 9.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Prophetical Office of Christ, Deuteronomy. 18. 18.
HItherto of the Principles that look on the Office of Christ; in the whole,
the Principles that concern the Parts of his Office, follow. There are three
Parts of the Offices of Christ.

1. His Prophetical.

2. Priestly.

3. Kingly. This Division may be proved.

1. By the Degrees of Man's misery; which is, 1. Ignorance. 2. Unruliness. 3.
Guiltiness; as a Prophet heads the first, as a King the second, and as a Priest
the third.

2. By the Parts of the Typical Anointing in the Old Testament, which was
threefold, 1. of Prophets. 2. Priests. 3. Kings.

1. Of his Prophetical Office; where,

1. What it is.

2. Parts of it.

3. The manner of executing of it.

1. The Prophetical Office of Christ, is that Work, by which he instructs his
Church concerning the Will of God, especially his Secret Council about
redeeming Mankind; the Parts are two.

1. External, Promulgation of Doctrine, which has three things in it;

1. The Preaching of the Gospel, or the Doctrine concerning God's Grace or
Redemption by Christ, Isa. 61. 1. Luke 4. 18.

2. The Interpretation of the Law, according to the mind of the Lawgiver,
Matthew. 5. 17. etc.

3. Prediction of things to come, Matthew. 24. 2, etc.

2. The internal Illumination of the heart, or the making Doctrine effectual by
the Spirit, renewing and inclining the Mind and Will of Man, John 5. 25. 1 John
2. 20, 27.

3. Of executing it, was,

1. Mediately, by Patriarchs and Prophets in the Old Testament.

2. Immediately, and that either by his Divine, or both Natures; by his Divine,
he instructed the Patriarchs and Prophets in the Old Testament by Visions,
Oracles and Dreams; by both Natures, by the word of mouth in the New Testament,
he himself taught amongst Men, 1 Pet. 3. 19. John 1. 5. The Principles
concerning this Office, are Seven.

1. That in Christ all was; see Col. 2. 3.

2. That it is Christ only that reveals the Truth out of the Bosom of the
Father, Matthew. 11. 27. John 1. 18. -- 6. 68.

3. That Christ has himself taught Doctrine amongst Men, Heb. 1. 2. Luke 4. 18.

4. That he has revealed the whole Council of God, John 15. 15. Deuteronomy. 18. 18.
John 17. 8.

5. That the Ministry in the Church, is by Authority from Christ, Matthew. 23.
24. Ephesians. 4. 11. 2 Cor. 5. 19.

6. That the whole Efficacy of Doctrine recorded in the Scripture, or thence
taught unto Men, depends on Christ, 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. 1 Cor. 3. 9.

7. That it belongs generally to all Nations, Isa. 49. 6. Zech. 9. 10.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Priestly Office of Christ. Psalm 110. 4. Heb. 6. 20. -- 4.
15. -- 9. 12.
WHich is that part of Christ's Office, whereby he makes Satisfaction to God
for Men. This Office in the Execution of it, has three Parts, or there be
three things which Christ must do, as the Priest of the Church.

1. He must obey God's Law perfectly.

2. Make Expiation for our Sins, by Sacrificing to God.

3. Make Intercession for us.

1. Concerning Christ's Obedience; there are four things

1. That he was without Sin in his Nature, John 8. 46. 2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Pet. 1.
19. -- 2. 22. Heb. 4. 15.

2. That he fulfilled the Law of God perfectly in all his Actions, Acts 2. 27.
-- 13. 35. -- 3. 14. -- 4. 27. 1 John 2. 20

3. That he fulfilled the Law not only for himself, but for us in our room and
stead, and for our sakes, Romans 8. 3, 4. -- 10 4. -- 5. 18, 19.

4. That this Righteousness of his is everlasting; that is such a righteousness
as cannot be lost; so better than Adams in the Estate of Innocence, Dan. 9. 24.

CHAP. XV. Of the Expiation of Sin, which was by the Passion of Christ. Ephesians. 5.
2. Col. 1. 20. Heb. 9. 27.
COncerning Christ's Passion, there are six Principles. 1. That the Passion of
Christ was by the decree and everlasting fore-appointment of God, Acts 2. 23. 1
Pet. 1. 20.

2. That the Sufferings of Christ were in our room and stead, i. e. for our
Sins, and for our Sakes, 1 Pet. 2. 24. Isa. 53. 6, 5, 8, 12. Romans 4. 25. 1 Cor.
5. 7.

3. That by his Passion he did atone, pacify God, and make Expiation for all
our Sins, Ephesians. 5. 2. Mat. 3. 17. 1 John 2. 2.

4. That in his own Person he fulfilled and finished all Sufferings needful for
our Salvation; he did at once for all the Elect, 1 Pet. 3. 18. Heb. 9. 28. --
10. 11, 12.

5. That the Passion of Christ is a sufficient price for the Sins of the whole
World, John 1. 29.

6. That Christ suffered extreme things for us; see John 17. 5. Luke 21. 2.
Matt. 8. 20. -- 2. 14. Mark 3. 6, 7. John 11. 54. -- 8. 59. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Heb.
2. 18. -- 4. 15. Isa. 53. 12.

CHAP. XVI. Of Christ Intercession; that third Part of his Priesthood. Romans 8.
34.
THere are four Principles.

1. That he sits at God's right Hand, and does it for us, Romans 8. 34. Heb. 7.
25.

2. That we have no other Intercessor in Heaven, but Christ, 1 Timothy 2. 5, 6.
Isa. 59. 16.

3. That it is perpetual; he so does it once, as he will never fail to do it in
all Ages, Heb. 7. 25, 28.

4. That he makes Intercession only for the Elect, John 17. 9. For the
Explanation of these Principles, three things must be opened.

1. The Acceptance of the word; it signifies, 1. Prayer, 1 Timothy 2. 1. 2ly,
Complaint, Romans 11. 2. Acts 25. 24. 3ly, Usually that part of Christ's
Mediation, in which he appears before God, to prevent his Displeasure toward
the Elect, Romans 8. 34.

2. How many ways Christ make Intecession for us, viz. 7.

1. He presents himself before God with his Merits, tendering his Sacrifice for
our Satisfaction, Heb. 9. 24. -- 9. 12. and so pacifying God toward us, Jer.
30. 13.

2. He prayed, and still does pray for us; all his Prayers on Earth, were a
part of his Intercession; and he still prays for us in Heaven, Romans 8. 34. Heb.
7. 25.

3. He offers up our Prayers and Praises to God, Rev. 8. 3, 4.

4. Undertakes for us, before God gives his Word for, us, that we shall eschew
Sin by his Grace, and not provoke God any more, as we have done, John 17. 6. --
25. 26.

5. He pleads our Cause as an Advocate, and Removes, and Nonsuites all
Accusations, which Justice, Law, Conscience, Men or Devils, may make against us
to God, Romans 8. 34. 1 John 2. 1.

6. Pours out upon us his Spirit of Intercession, which causes us what to do,
see Romans 8. 26, 15. Gal. 4. 6, 7.

7. He sprinkleth his Blood upon us by Application of his Merits to us, which
cries and makes Intercession for us, Heb. 12. 24.

3. In which Nature he makes Intercession? it is answered in both, as a Man
praying, it is with his Soul and Body he prays, if right vocal Prayer; so Christ
pleads as one Person, tho two Natures.

CHAP. XVII. Of Christ's Kingly Office.
COncerning which, there are Seven Principles.

1. That he overcame Sin, Death, Grave and Hell, and rose again from the Dead,
and ascended into Heaven, and sits on the right hand of God, Romans 4. 25. 1
Cor. 15. 54. Joh. 20. 12. Mark 16. 6, 14. 2 Timothy 2. 8. Mark. 16. 19. Luke 24.
51. Acts 1. 9. Ephesians. 4. 8, 9, 10. Heb. 1. 9. -- 8. 1. Ephesians. 1. 20, 21. Col. 3. 1.

2. That Christ, who puchased the Church by his Blood, is appointed of God, the
King, and Head of the Church, and Prince over the People of God, having all
Power in his own hands, Psalm. 2. 6. Mat. 28. 18. Col. 1. 18. Rev. 19. 16.

3. That he is likewise appointed to be the Lawgiver to his Church, and the
Judge of the World, Jam. 4. 12. John 5. 12. Acts 10. 24. -- 17. 31. 2 Timothy 4. 1.

4. That his Government extended to the People of all Nations, Psalm. 2. 8.
Matthew. 28. 19. Phil. 2. 10, 11.

5. That (...) Kingdom is not of this World, but a Spiritual and Celestial
Kingdom, John 18. 36. Romans 14. 17.

6. That he will be with his to the end of the World, Matthew. 28. 19. 20.

7. That his Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, Luke 1. 33. Heb. 12. 28. Dan.
2. 44. -- 7. 14. For the Explication of this Office of Christ, note four things.

1. That Christ sought for his Kingdom, and overcame Satan, Sin, Death, and
Hell, and rescued his Subjects from their Thraldom, 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55. Col. 2.
15. Heb. 2. 14. and this Victory he accomplished, and proclaimed in his
Resurrection.

2. The Kingly Glory of Christ consisted in two things. The

1. Was the Glorification of his Humane Nature, being dispossessed of all
Infirmities accompanying our Nature; so as he ceased to be hungry, to be weary,
etc. nor could he suffer any more, or dye.

2. That the perfecting of his humane Nature with all the degrees of celestial
Gifts and Endowments, could possibly befall a created Nature, both in Body and
Mind; his glorified Body surpassing the Sun for brightness, Matthew. 17. 2. Acts
9. 3. -- 22. 11.

2. His triumph over his Enemies, which he acted two ways.

1. In those frequent Manifestations after his Resurrection.

2. His Ascension, leading with him Captivity Captive, Psalm 68. 18.

3. The taking Possession of his Kingdom, and this he did when he sat at the
right Hand of God, Heb. 1. 8. Ephesians. 1. 20, 21.

4. The Administration of his Kingdom, of which he is now possessed. And this
has four things in it.

1. The calling and gathering together, both Jews and Gentiles, which belong to
the Election of God, Romans 8. 30. Ephesians. 4. 11, 12. Isa. 11. 11, 12.

2. The prescribing Laws, as the only Lawgiver of the Church; this he does,
when he propounds unto his Subjects the Rules both of believing and living by
the Word and Ministry of the same, adding thereunto the Work of the Spirit,
writing his Laws on their Hearts, Jam. 4. 12. Jer. 31. 33. 2 Cor. 3. 17, 18.

3. The Donation of Gifts, and enabling Men for the Kingdom of God, Ephesians. 4. 8.
Phil. 1. 29.

4. The Execution of Justice, and so he does Justice, 1: Among his own
Subjects; and so he does them Justice,

1. In justifying them from their Sins, Romans 5. 19.

2. Giving reward among them, both in Spiritual and Temporal things, 1 Cor. 3.
22.

3. By keeping them in a State of Grace, so as they fall not away, Heb. 12. 2.

2. Against his Enemies, whom he,

1. Restrains and defeats them in their Counsels, Rev. 20. 1. 2 Job 5. 12, 13.

2. Subdues them, either by converting them, Psalm. 45. 6. or confounding them
partly by Judgments here, and casting them to Hell at last, 2 These. 1. 9. The
Administration of his Kingdom he executes partly in this Life, and partly in
the World to come; the one in his Kingdom of Grace, the other in his Kingdom of
Glory; what is begun here, is fully made complete in the other World.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the Church. Ephesians. 1. 12.
HItherto, of the Means of Grace; the Subject of Grace follows, and that is the
Church. The Church in General is the whole Multitude of Men elected to eternal
Life by God in Christ. Concerning the Church in general, there are these seven
Principles.

1. That it is a Company of Men separated from the World, gathered by the voice
of Christ; the word signifies such as are gathered together by the Voice of
God's Cryers, John 17. 9, 14.

2. That she is one, Ephesians. 4. 4. Cant. 6. 10. or 3. Gal. 3. 28. one, in many
respects so, because all the Godly are united mystically in one Body, Romans 12.
5. Ephesians. 4. 14, 16.

3. That she is knit to Christ her head, by an indisolvable Union, Col. 1. 18.
-- 2. 19. 1 Cor. 12. 27. Ephesians. 1. 22, 23. One with Christ in Spirit, John 4. 13.

4. That she is Holy, Ephesians. 5. 2, 7. Tit. 3. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 9. Dan. 7. 18.

1. By imputed and imparted Holiness, Righteousness, Romans 3. 21, 22. Heb. 10.
10.

2. By separation from this World, 2 Cor. 6. 16, 17. Romans 12. 2. John 15. 19.

3. By Consummation of all Holiness in the other World, Ephesians. 5. 27.

5. She is Catholic, i. e. Universal.

1. In respect of time, all the Godly being Members of this one Body, tho they
lived in all the several Ages, since the beginning of the World.

2. In respect of place, because all the Godly, both in Heaven and Earth, are
all of this one Body, Ephesians. 1. 10. And so from all parts of the World is the
Church gathered; all the particular Churches in the World are but Members of
this Church Universal; of particular Churches, read Romans 1. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 1. 2

3. The Church is Universal in respect of Persons, Rev. 5. 9, 10. Gal. 3. 28.

6. That she is Militant, that is, in this Life exposed to Crosses and
Afflictions, etc. Romans 12. 11. Ephesians. 6. 12. 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8. Acts 14. 23. Christ
will have it so, 1. For his own Sake, that he might show how he hates Sin, even
in his own; and Justice in afflicting them; and Glory, and Power, and Mercy, in
delivering them. 2. For their sakes, 1 Cor. 11. 31. Romans 8. 28. 3. For his
Enemies sake, that they may know, they shall not not be spared, 1 Pet. 4. 17.

7. That she is invincible, Matthew. 16. 18. Romans 8. 37, 38, 39. 1 Pet. 5. 10.

CHAP. XIX. Of Justification.
HItherto of the Subject of Grace, the Church; the degrees of Grace in this
Life, are two, Justification and Sanctification; concerning Justification there
are nine Principles.

1. That all Men have sinned, and are guilty before God naturally, and in
themselves, Romans 3. 9, 23. Gal. 3. 22.

2. That by Men's own Works no Flesh can be justified, Romans 3. 20. Gal. 2. 16,
21. Tit. 3. 5. Gal. 3. 11. Phil. 3. 9. before God.

3. That the Righteousness that makes us just, is in Christ, and being made
ours by Imputation, 2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Phil. 3. 9. Romans 3. 21, 22. --
4. 7. Isa. 45. 24. Jer. 23. 6. Dan. 9. 24. Rev. 19. 8. Heb. 11. 7. Luke 15. 22.

4. That this Righteousness is made ours only by Faith, and so we are justified
only by Faith, as it apprehends and lays hold upon, and relies on the
Righteousness of Christ, Romans 3. 28. Heb. 11. 7. Romans 3. 22. Gal. 2. 16. Romans
1. 16, 17. Acts 13. 39. Romans 5. 1.

5. That this Faith is Gods Work and Gift, John 6. 29, Phil. 1. 29. Ephesians. 2. 8.
Heb. 12. 2.

6. That all Men have not Faith, 2 These. 3. 2. Isa. 53. 1. Hence is that in
Tit. 1. 1.

7. That there is but one kind of Faith, by which all the elect are justified,
Ephesians. 4. 5.

8. That it is of mere Grace, Romans 3. 24. Tit. 3. 5, 6, 7.

9. That being justified by Faith, we have Peace and Pardon, and accounted
just, and dealt with as such, Romans 5. 1. -- 5. 19. Others thus.

1. It Is a gracious Act of God, whereby he imputes the Righteousness of Christ
to all Believers, and for the Merit of Christ, and freely absolveth them from
all their Sins, and reputeth them just unto Life, and deals with them as such,
Romans 3. 22. Psalm. 32. 1, 2. 2 Cor. 5. 21.

2. That it is twofold Legal, Romans 2. 3. So none can be justified, Jam. 3. 2.
Gal. 2. 16. Evangelical, Romans 5. 18.

3. That the matter of our Justification is Christ's active and passive
Obedience, together with his original Righteousness, Gal. 3. 10. Romans 5. 19.

4. That Christ's original Righteousness is part of his Satisfaction, and of
our Justification.

1. Christ's original Righteousness answers our original Sin.

2. The Law requires not only actual Obedience, but also original and full
Conformity.

3. That a whole Christ is ours, and whatsoever he was made, did, or was, that
he was made, did, and was for us, Isa. 9. 6. 1 Cor. 1. 30.

5. That his active Obedience, i. e. Obedience of his Life, was necessary to
our Justification.

1. Because, as his Passive, or Obedience of his Death, was necessary for the
Expiation of our Sin; so the other for the obtaining like Life Eternal, Lev.
18. 5. The second frees us from Hell and Punishment. The first gives us right
to Heaven.

2. That as the Law binds to Punishment, threatening Death to them that break
it, Deuteronomy. 29. 26. So it binds to Obedience, promising Life to them that keep
it, Luke 10. 28. Lev. 18. 5.

3. As Christ's passive, answers Man's guilt of Sin and Damnation, so his other
answers Man's want of Righteousness, Romans 3. 22. -- 5. 19. 1 Cor. 1. 3. The one
answers what we should have suffered; the other, what we should have done.

6. That the parts of Justification are two.

1. Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, whereby the Believer has his Sin
covered, and is accepted, and dealt with as just in the sight of God, Phil. 3.
8, 9.

2. Remission of Sins, whereby the Believer is freed from the guilt and
punishment of Sin, Col. 1. 20, 21, 22. 1 Pet. 2. 24.

7. The moving cause of Justification is twofold.

1. The inward moving Cause, is Gods Mercy, and free Love Grace, Romans 3. 24.

2. The outward moving Cause, is the Merit, Desert and Efficacy of Christ's
active and passive Obedience, or the whole Obedience of Christ; his obedient
Life and Death, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. Romans 5. 9.

8. The formal Cause, is the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, Romans 3. 22.

9. The instrumental Cause, Faith, Romans 3. 28.

10. The final Cause, God's Glory, Ephesians. 1. 6.

CHAP. XX. Of Sanctification. 1 These. 4. 3.
COncerning which, are five Principles.

1. That whom God justifies, he sanctifies, Romans 8. 30. Ezekiel. 36. 27.

2. That to be truly sanctified, is to dye to Sin, and to rise again to newness
of Life in Righteousness, Romans 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. or it is to repent and believe the
Gospel, Mark 1. 15.

3. Without it is no Salvation, John 3. 5. Heb. 12. 14. 1 John 1, 7. 2 Cor. 5.
17.

4. That its Gods Work and Gift, Acts 5. 31. -- 11. 18. 2 Timothy 2. 26. 1 Cor.
1. 30. Ezekiel. 36. 27. -- 11. 19. Tit. 3. 5.

5. That our Sancttification is imperfect, whilst we live in this World, 1 John
1. 8. Eccl. 7. 20. Isa. 46. 6. Prove. 24. 16. Jam. 3. 2.

CHAP. XXI. Of the Resurrection. John 5. 28, 29.
HItherto, of the Principles that concern the third state of Man; the fourth
Estate of Man, is the Estate of Glory; and in this we are to consider the three
degrees of it.

1. The Resurrection.

2. The last Judgment.

3. The Glory of Heaven. The Principles that concerns the Resurrection, are
four.

1. The Body of dead Men shall rise out of the Dust of the Earth, and their own
Souls shall enter into them again, Job 19. 25, 26. Isa. 26. 19. John 5. 29. 1
Cor. 15. 16.

2. The Bodies of all Men shall be raised, Joh 5. 28. great and small, Rev. 20.
12, 13. Just and unjust, Acts 34. 15. Tho the Unjust shall not rise in the same
manner, nor by the same Power, that is, by Virtue of Christ's Resurrection,
Dan. 12. 2.

3. That the same Body which Men carry about with them in this World, shall
rise again, Job 19. 26, 27. Psalm 34. 20. 1 Cor. 15. 53.

1. Because every Man shall in his Body what he has done, 2 Cor. 5. 10.

2. Because, else it would be absurd, that any other should be crowned, but
that which suffered, or punished, but that which sinned.

4. That this Resurrection shall be at the end of the World, even the last day
of it, John 6. ^4.

CHAP. XXII. Of the last Judgment. 2 Cor. 5. 10.
HItherto, of the Resurrection; the last Judgment follows. The Principles
concerning it, are Seven.

1. That there shall be a general Judgment, Jude 14. 18. Psalm 9. 8. -- 50. 1.
Heb. 9. 27, 28. Dan. 7. 9, 10.

2. That Christ shall be Judge, and that in the Humane Nature, Acts 10 42. --
17. 31. 2 Timothy 4. 1. John 5. 22.

3. That all Men shall be judged at that day, just and unjust, quick and dead,
great and small, Jude 1. 5. Romans 14. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Psalm 9. 8.

4. (...) all the secret things of Man's Nature or Works, shall then be brought
to light, Luke 8. 17. 1 Cor. 4. 5. Romans 2. 16. -- 2. 5.

5. It shall be at the last Day; the precise Day and Hour is not known to any
Man or Angels, Mat. 24. 36.

6 The Judgment shall be most just and righteous, and all shall confess it,

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Glory of Heaven. 1 Cor. 2. 9.
HItherto of the Resurrection and last Judgment, the Glory of Heaven follows.
The Principles concerning that, are four.

2. Eternal, Mat. 25. 46. 2 Timothy 1. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 4. 2 Cor. 5. 1.

3. It Is the Gift of God, and proceeds only from his free Grace, and not for
any merit in us, Luke 12. 32. John 3. 16. Romans 6. 23.

4. The Elect only shall enjoy and obtain this Glory, 1 Cor. 15. 50. Rev. 21.
27. 1 Cor. 6. 9. Romans 2. 7, 10. Glorification is the blessed Estate of the
Saints after this Life, wherein they shall have perfect and perpetual Freedom
from all Sins and Misery, and the full perfection of Grace and Glory, both in
Soul and Body, Ephesians. 5. 27. Isa. 60. 21. 1 Cor. 13. 10, 11, 12. Rev. 21. 4, 5.
