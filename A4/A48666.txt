A List of the Lodgers, together with the Horses and Arms of Mr. Loyal IN CROWN
COURT IN CHANCERY LANE. [1659] July 22 ^
1. AS for Lodgers I have but one, Mr. Honesty Hadland belonging to the County
of Suffering, who has been formerly fequestred by this Parliament, with his
Man Thomas, who is a great Agent to his Lively hood. 2. Horses I have two, the
one a Hobby Horse bought of the woman that cries Cocks and Geldings about the
Streets, for my Son Timothy, the other is but a small one with a whistle in his
tail for my Son Hugh the last Bartholmew-tide for a fairing. 3. As touching
Arms I have two spits, a paring-shovel, three Broomstaves, besides the Broom I
sweep with is almost worn to the stumps, and then I shall have four. My Son
Timothy has a pot-gun, with a Tobaccopipe, set into a Catstick artificially.
My other Son has a leaden dagger given him for a fairing as aforesaid; besides
my Wife desired me to put in our Mouse-trap, for fear that should be
comprehended within the Act, being an Engine against an Enemy. 4. For Bullets I
have none, nor Powder, only some relics left in my Head since last I was at
the Barbers. 5. Lastly for Armor, I have only a Pewter headpiece, which in
these times of peace We use for a close-stool pan; my wife had a Thimble, but
that the maid carried out the last week in the dust tub.
So this being an impartial List of what I am required by the Act to deliver
in; I hope I shall receive favor for my fidelity.

Stewart Loyal.
