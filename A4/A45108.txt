The Humble Wishes of a Loyal Subject.
MAY Blood of Innocents no more Disgrace
The Stuart's Name, nor fly in CHARLES's Face;
Let Tyrants wear those Stains whose due they are,
Whilst High Born KINGS the Rod of Justice bear.
May proud Rebellious Faction tumble down,
And haughty Freedom truckle to the Crown.
May stubborn Peers, Pimps to a Commonweal,
(Maugre all Ignoramus Juries,) feel
The Keen-edg'd Ax: May S -- e and P -- n,
And C -- h take the Law of Abbington;
May B -- l, and such Citt Sh'riffs understand
The jerk of their own Hireling Ketch's Hand.
May W -- d Rewarded be by Them he serves,
On the Triangle Tree, as He deserves;
May Moore never cease to stand up for the Crown
Against the Presumptuous Rabble of the Town.
May Ignoramus never more Present
It self in Court until a Parliament
Decide the Cause, how Treason justified
May be by Ignoramus, thus denied.
May Knaves be Banished from your Sacred Court,
And thither none but Honest Men resort.
May subtle Two-fac'd Lawyers Chat no more,
Whether Succession be of Right, or Power:
May YORK Return Your Senators to Face,
And justify his Highborn Princely Race.
May Godfrey's Murderers appear on Stage,
To Pin the Scene of this Tumultuous Age:
May Hill and Green never cease in Heaven to Pray,
Till We behold that happy welcome Day.
May all that wish for Change of Government,
To pull down KING, to set up Parliament,
Like Noll and Bradshaw, Scot and Peter's, be
Rewarded for their Wicked Policy.
May pure Rogue, Three Names, end his Aged days
In Hempen String, to his Eternal Praise;
And Hang by Quarters over the City Gates,
With Head on Tower, for his Noble Feats;
Whilst his own Zealous Bigots, passing by,
Behold their Demi-god extolled to th'Sky.
May the Great Name of STVART now become,
Mirror and Terror to all Christendom:
Under the Name of CHARLES, may Charlemaine
Be couched for Power, for Virtue, Charlebone.
FINIS.
