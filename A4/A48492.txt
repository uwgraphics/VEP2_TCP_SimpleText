BY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF Of all the FORCES in SCOTLAND.
WHereas (amongst other things) by Proclamation of the 27. of Sept. 1653. all
Magistrates and Officers of Burghs and P^rishes, and all other persons
whatsoever, are required to secure, or give Intelligence of all suspected
persons, traveling through, or abiding within their bounds or jurisdictions,
as in and by the said Proclamation more particularly is expressed:
No^with-standing nothing to this time has been effectually done, but on the
contrary, diverse Rebels, as well considerable numbers as Spies, have been, and
still are frequently permitted and suffered to pass, march through, and abide
in any Burgh or Parish within the Quarters of our Army unquestioned, as if no
Rebellion were, who thereby take oppor^un^ty, not only to get Intelligence,
but also to entice many loose persons to join with them in Rebellion, and
commit frequent Robberies and barbarous Murders, and other Outrages upon the
Persons, Goods and Geer, as well of Scots as En^lish. These are therefore
strictly to charge and command, That no person or persons, of wha^ degree or
quality soever (not being a Member of the English Army) do presume after ten
days next after Publication hereof, to pass above five miles from his and
their respective aboads or habitations, unless he or they have first obtained
a Pass from my Self, or the Commander in Chief of the Forces in Scotland for
the time being, or from the next Chief Officer of the English Army, or the
Judge-Advocate of the Army; (of whose circumspection and care in parting with
the said Passes to persons well-affected, or upon good caution, I nothing
doubt) whith said Pass is to be signed and sealed with my Hand and Seal,
conform to the Hand and Seal hereunto subscribed and affixed, or the Hand and
Seal of the Commander in Chief for the time being, and subscribed by the said
Officer from whom it shall be obtained, with his name, together with the time
and place of his subscription, (except he or they make it appear, he or they
are upon their ready way to the next Chief Officer for obtaining the said
Pass) under the pain of being adjudged, deemed and taken as Enemies in
Rebellion against the Peace of the Commonwealth, and dealt withal accordingly.
And all Magistrates and Officers, and all other persons whatsoever within Burghs
or Parishes, are hereby strictly required, that if any person or persons
(except as before is excepted) and not being Members of the English Army shall
contrary hereunto, presume to march, travel, pass through, or abide in any
Burgh or Parish, without a Pass as aforesaid, the said Magistrates, Officers
and Parishioners of such Burgh and Parish, are hereby required to secure them,
if they shall be of strength sufficient, and them safely keep, until notice be
given to my Self, the Commanders in Chief for the time being, or the next
adjacent Officer in Chief of the English Forces (any of whose Orders thereanent
is duly to be observed) under the penalty of twenty pounds sterling, and such
further punishment, according to the quality of the Offense, as to a Court
Marti^ll to be held for the Head Quarters, or any other Inferior Court
Martial, before whom the matter shall be tried, shall be thought just; And
whenever any Par^y of the Rebels, which now are, or hereafter shall break
forth into Rebellion, or any other person, not having a Pass, as aforesaid,
shall march or travel, into or through any Burgh or Parish; and if the Burgh,
Parish and Inhabitants shall not be of strength sufficient to secure them, That
in such case the Magistrates, Officers, and Inhabitants of the said Burgh, and
Parishioners of the said Parish, and every individual person thereof, are
hereby strictly charged and required, to take care that such expedient be found
out amongst themselves, that upon the first entrance of such Rebels, or
persons not having a Pass, as aforesaid, whether they make stay or not,
immediately to take care that with all possible speed, one or more persons,
mounted on as good a Horse as at present may be had, or otherwise a nimble
Footman, to post away with all possible speed to the next and nearest Forces
of the English Army, wheresoever they shall happen to be, and give true
Intelligence to the Officer or Officers thereof, of their number, and who
commands them, so near as may be, under the like penalty of twenty pounds
sterling, and such farther punishment, according to the quality of the Offense,
as to a Court Martial, to be held for the Headquarters, or any other
Inferior Court Martial of the Army, before whom the matter shall be tried,
shall be in like manner thought just.

Given under my Hand and Seal at Dalkeith, the 7. day of April, 1654. R.
LILBVRNE.

To be proclaimed at the Market Cross of the chief Burgh in every County or
Sheriffdom, and upon the Lords day, the Parishioners being conveened together
at the Kirk, to be openly read unto them by the Clerk thereof.
