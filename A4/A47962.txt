A LETTER Agreed unto, and subscribed by, the Gentlemen, Ministers, Freeholders
and Seamen of the County of SUFFOLK. Presented to His EXCELLENCY, The Lord
General MONCK.
May it please your Excellency,
THAT our own hearts may not accuse us of a Negligence and Supinenesse,
unbecomming those Distempers we languish under, it is our desire, that this
Application, humbly and affectionately tendered, may be received, as the Effect
of a just and serious Resentment. To us, at this distance, the God of Heaven
seems to prompt you to do Nobly, by depositing in your hands a full and happy
Opportunity, such as conspires to promote those Ends, which are worthy and
generous. Your Lordship will need no other Incitements, than the public
Concern, and contriving an abiding Ornament to your Name. It must needs be
tedious, to see Government reeling from one Species, from one hand to another.
We apprehend it much in your power to fix it. Are our Sacred or Civil
Liberties dear to us? They solicit a Restitution to their Legal Boundaries.
Let your Lordship cast your eyes upon a Nation, impoverished, disfigured,
bleeding under an intestine Sword: Let its agonies, its miseries, its ruins,
implore your assistance. To our sense, the only redress, under God, lies in a
Free and Full PARLIAMENT, whereunto our Ancestors recours'd in resembling
Exigencies. And lest your Lordship should suspect these to be our own solitary
thoughts, we are not ashamed to acknowledge, that the Presentiments of several
Grand-Juries, and the desires of the Seamen in this County, urged this
Address; which shall be pursued with all due testimonies of a Cordial
Adhesion to your Lordship in order thereunto.

This Letter was delivered at St. Albans, Jan. 28. 1659. by Sir Henry Felton
Barronet, Robert Brook, and William Bloys Esquires.
