(...): OR THE Virtue, Vigor, and Efficacy OF THE PROMISES Displayed in their
Strength and Glory.

Duly methodised, and fitly applied to every Christians particular Case and
Condition.

IN A Soliloquy, wholly Scriptural, Between the SOUL and the COMFORTER. WITH A
Divine Rapture of the SOUL, Now resting satisfied by the Spirit of the HOLY
PROMISE.

BY THO. HENDERSON.

Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not ais^ayed, for I am thy God: I will
strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right
hand of my righteousness,

Isa. 41. verse. 10. London, Printed for Dor. Newman, at the Surgeons Arms in
Little Britain, 1669.

To the Christian READER.
NO sooner does poor Man come out of the Womb, but he launcheth forth into an
Ocean of Miseries and Woes; where he is tossed with Waves, distracted with
Terrors, and encompassed with continual Evils, that follow him unseparably, as
the shadow follows the Body, and never leave him, till he get beyond the bounds
of Time, and enter those Interminable Mansions of Eternity; Neither is it any
wonder for those who are born Soldiers, to meet with Conflicts; for Travelers
to meet with hard Usage; for Seamen to meet with Storms; for Strangers in a
strange Country, to meet with strange Entertainment: For such, indeed, are
Christians, men of another World, and here from home, traveling to their
Fathers Kingdom, to that City of the Living God, the Celestial Jerusalem, to
be associated with innumerable Angels, and the Assembly of the First born; and
therefore should rejoice that they are predestined unto a Conformity to
Christ their Head, as in Grace and Glory, so in Abasement; and by that way of
many Tribulations (which the Captain of their Salvation has consecrated) to
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Yet he that is the Life and Light of the
world, (who loved us better than his own life, which he laid down for us, and
made it his last suit to his Father and our Father, that we might be with him)
to show us the way to himself, has given us his Word for a Lamp, his Spirit
for a Guide, and his precious PROMISES wherewith he has bespangled the Holy
Scriptures, to shine to us with their cheerful brightness, to lead us to these
Azure Vaults, as being the only place of our repose.

The Scriptures, indeed, are the power of God unto salvation, as full of Life,
as the Sun is full of Light; and truly the Light is sweet (says Solomon) but
as the Suns loose disshevelled Rays (when he makes the Horizon to laugh, and
paints the East with Vermilion, spreading the Morning upon the Mountains) are
not so glorious, as when the King of Planets himself comes forth out of his
Chamber like a Bridegroom clothed with Majesty, and culminates to the height
of the Heavens in the Radiancy of his Splendor, possessing all his far
extended Rays, condensed, and concentrated in himself, even so may the
Promises, as a glistering Light, thinly dispensed through the Scriptures, be
less conspicuous, possibly, and efficacious, than when they are assembled,
united, and marshalled, in such Strength, Method, and Order, as to be rendered
more Splendid, Illustrious, and Useful in all Exegencies; which I have weakly
essayed to do in this Manual, not without some hope, that it may prove a
Sovereign Remedy against all despondency of Spirit throught unbelief, effectual
by the grace of God to heal all spiritual Maladies, and to compose all
Distempers; for here you may behold with one view, as it were, the Stars of the
first Magnitude, that are sown througout the Scriptures, and a Constellation
of all the PROMISES, sending forth their most pure, and active Influences upon
the Prisoners in the Pit, laboring under a Spirit of Infidelity, and with
Impatience and Trepidation waiting for the coming of the PROMISE, and the
Harvest of Joy, after their Seed-time of Sorrow. Whatsoever be the Lot of a
Christian in the Valley of Tears, whether he pass through the Land of the
Living, in the fair Sunshine of Prosperity; or in the black Shadows, and Night
of Adversity; yet shall he be still assaulted by Temptations, either upon the
Right Hand, or upon the Left, in either of which Cases this ENCHERIDION, like
Jacob's Staff may support him, this shining Torch may serve him as a Cynosure
to direct his Course amongst the Shelves, the Rocks, and the devouring Gulfs in
the way, that he be not led unto the Chambers of Hell, and by departing from
the Living God through unbelief, fall into the Pit of Perdition. In all or most
of their VVritings, especially amongst the vanity of the Nations, it may be
said in some sort, that Materiam superat opus, the form of the Piece, and the
Art excels the Subject; but in this little Repertory of the Sacred Promises it
is quite contrary; for here is nothing but Gold, and a multitude of Rubies,
Roses of Diamonds, more precious then the Philosophers Stone; and if they be
not so fitly Set, and Enamelled in so goodly a Dress, as well becomes them; Let
this Little Essay (the first, I suppose, of any that has ever yet appeared of
this kind) excite others, who are blessed and beautified with more of the
Spirit of God, in Wisdom, and Understanding, and in Knowledge to devise
cunning Works, and to work in Gold and Silver, Ex. 31.3, 4 To improve their
best endeavors and skill, to fet forth the Riches of Gods free Grace, in the
fullness and sweetness of the Promises, to the benefit and comfort of the Heirs
of Salvation. And yet I doubt not but whosoever would receive the Truth, and
not despise the Consolations of the Almighty, shall find this little Sanctuary
of the Promises, (even as they are here managed against all Objections, that
may occurr) to be a Shield, which all the Fiery Darts of the Devil, cannot
pierce; no Weapon that is formed against it shall prosper.

Here (in short) thou may see mustered, the Armies of that Roaring Lion,
displaying a Banner against the Heavens, who (as he was a Liar from the
beginning, and envying the felicity of man, adopted to that Eternal Glory,
which he had forfeited) does still make it his work to scandalize God to Man,
and Man to God, and Man to Himself, thereby to disturb the whole Creation; and
(if it were possible) to disappoint the holy purpose of God, toward the
Vessels of Mercy, and to render them Accomplices of his guiltiness, and
Companions of his everlasting Torments. On the other hand thou shall see the
Impotent Forces of that Grand Impostor encountered by the Lion of the Tribe of
Judah (who is stronger than the strongest, and prevails always when he
contendeth) and vanquished by Him, who abolished Death, and brought Life and
Immortality, to light through the Gospel.

If there be any who through worldly Diversions, or other Indispositions,
cannot travel through the more spacious Garden of the Holy Scriptures, to
gather such Medicaments as they would choose for refreshing their Souls, they
may without any trouble enter into this pleasant Paradise, and delightful
Grove, where they shall find rich Beds of all the Flowers, the choicest, the
sweetest that can be there afforded, all springing from the Root of Jesse, and
that Honorable Plant of Renown, which perfumes the heavens and the earth; Here
they may have the great consolations of the Scriptures distilled in an Elixar,
which by the discretion of a Spiritual taste, they shall find as the spiced
Wine, and juice of Pomegranates, mighty to strengthen the Heart when it faints,
the Faith when it fails, and the Spirit when it is overwhelmed within them: A
true Catholicon and Panacea for reviving the Soul in all Deliquies, and
maintaining it in a good plight continually: A Posie of more delightful and
sal;utiferous Flowers, than any that ever grew in the Garden of Eden: A rare
and rich Jewel of inestimable value, though of small price, and therefore as
easy as necessary to be carried about by all those who pretend to Christianity
and Immortality.

THO. HENDERSON.

A SOLILOQUY (Wholly Scriptural) Betwixt the afflicted SOUL and the COMFORTER;
wherein all, or most of the Objections and Complaints dispersed through the
Scriptures, are answered and redressed by other Consolatory and establishing
Scriptures.
The Soul.

7.20. Luke 15.18, 21. The Great, the Mighty, Jer. 32.18. the jealous God, Exodus
20.5, 9. who by no means will clear the guilty, Exodus 3.7. Number. 14.18. What

ever, Genesis 2.17. Romans 5.12, 17, 21, 23. Dan. 9.11. O that thou would pardon
my transgressions, and take away my iniquities! Joh. 7.21.

Who is a God like unto thy God? Mich. 17.18. Gracious and merciful, slow to
anger, and of great kindness, Exodus 34.6. Chap. 30.9. Nehem. I have sinned
against thee.
9.17. Ps. 86.15.111.4.103.8.112.4.116.5.145.8. and 117.2. who pardons
iniquity, and passes by transgression. He retains not his anger for ever,
because he delights in mercy; he will turn again, he will have compassion
upon thee, and subdue thine iniquities; he will cast all thy sins in the depths
of the Sea, Mich. 7.18, 19. for as the heaven is high above the earth, so great
is his mercy toward thee; As far as the East is from the West, so far has he
removed thy transgressions from thee, Psalm. 103.11, 12. he will cleanse thee
from all thine iniquities, and pardon all thy sins, Psalm. 103.2. Jer. 33.8. and
37.23. and 1 John 17.9. Rev. 1.5. Thou have Jesus Christ the Righteous Advocate
with the Father, 1 John 2.1. and the Father himself loves thee also, Joh.
16.27. He will not deal with thee after thy sins, nor according to thy wicked
ways, and corrupt doings; know that he is God the Lord, Who by no means, etc.
that works with thee for his own Names sake, Ez. 20.9, 14. whereunto whosoever
flies, Prav. 18.10. And upon which, whosoever calls shall be saved, Act. 2.21.
Romans 10.13. It is his glory to pass over a Transgression, Prove. 19.11. By Grace
shall thou be saved, Ephesians. 2.5. And by hope. Romans 8.24. Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, What shall I do? etc.
and thou shall be saved, Act. 16.31. For He, even He it is, that blotteth out
thy transgressions, as a thick Cloud, Isa. 43.25. etc 44.22. He casts all thy
sins in the depths of the Sea, Mic. 7.19. He puts away thine iniquities for
his own sake, and will not remember thy sins any more, Jer. 31.34. Heb. 10.17.
Is. 103.11, 12. He beholds no iniquity in Jacob, and sees no transgression
in Israel, Thou have set my iniquities, etc.
Number. 23.21. For in his Name (through whom God was reconciling the world to
himself, 2 Cor. 5.19. Thou have Remission of sins, Act. 10.43. Yea, thou have
received abundance of Grace, and of the gift of Righteousness unto Eternal
Life, through Jesus Christ, Romans 5.15, 16, 17. hope in the Lord; for with the
Lord there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous Redemption, Psalm. 130.7.
Behold the Lamb which takes away the sins of the World, Joh. 1.29. who bare
thine iniquities, Isa. 53.11. whom God has exalted with his right hand, to be
a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance and forgiveness of sins, Act.
5.31. to put away thy sins by the sacrifice of himself, Heb. 9.26. The Blood of
Christ Jesus cleanses thee from all sin 1 John 1.7. Which he purged by
himself, Heb. 1.3. For he loved thee, and washed thee from they sins by his own
blood, Rev. 1.5. And became the propitiation for thy sins, 1 John 2.2. which
are forgiven thee for his name sake, O that thou would pardon, etc.
1 Ioh. 2.12. He will abundantly pardon, Is. 55.7. Jer. 33.8. Fear not, for it
is thy Fathers pleasure to give thee a Kingdom, Luke 12.32. Rejoice, for thy
name is written in Heaven, Luke 10.20. And in the Lambs Book, Rev. 22.27. O
Bless the Lord that forgiveth all thine iniquities, Psalm. 113.3.8.: Col. 2.13.
Which though they were, as Crimson and Scarlet, yet stall they be made as white
as Wool and Snow, Isa. 1.18.

The Soul.
Why have thou suffered me to err from thy ways, and hardened my heart from thy
fear? Isa. 63.17. Why would thou take thine holy Spirit from me? Isa. 49.14.
Psalm. 51.11. And wilt not deliver me from the power of Darkness, delusions,
Isa. 29.10. Col. 1.13. O that I knew where to find thee, that I might come near
to thy seat! Job 23.2. And remember thee of the Word of Truth which thou gave
me, wherein thou causedst me to hope! Psalm. 119.49. And tell thee how thou
did promise to magnify thy Truth above all thy Name, Pasal. 138.2. But now
my hope is as the giving up of the Chost, Job 11.20. And I am cut off: for my
part, Ez. 37.11. Is it good to thee that thou should oppress? Job 10.3. Will thou destroy the works of thine own hands? Job 10.3. Psalm. 138.8. and Isa.
43.1. and despise Lam. 2.6. the price of thy Sons blood? Act. 20.28. Heb. 9.12.
1 Cor. 6.20. and 7.23. and 2 Pet. 2.1.

The Comforter.
Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his Counselor has taught
him? Isa. 40.13. Romans 11.34.1 Cor. 2.16. Why have thou suffered me to err
from, etc.
Though darkness encompass his Throne, Psalm. 18.9, 11. and he gives no account
of any of his matters, Job 33.12. Yet all the ways of the Lord are mercy and
truth, Psalm. 25.10. He is only wise, I Tim. 1.17. There is no searching of his
understanding, Isa. 40.28. and his love passes all knowledge, Ephesians. 3.19. He
has left thee to declare unto thee the thoughts of thy heart, Amos 4.13. And
that he might humble thee, and prove thee, and do thee good in the later end,
Dent. 8.16. But he will give thee a new heart, and write his fear up on it,
that thou may not be able to depart from him, Take thine Holy Spirit from me,
etc.
Isa. 32.40. He will pour out his Spirit upon thee, Joel 2.28. Act. 2.17, 18.
He will put a new Spirit within thee, Ez. 11.19. and 18.31. and 36.26, 27. Thou
have received of the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. 2.12. even the Spirit of Adoption,
Romans 8.15. and the Spirit of his Son, Gal. 4.6. in whom are hid all the
Treasures of Wisdom, Col. 2.3. The promise of the Spirit, Gal. 3.14. and the
Spirit of promise, whereby thou art sealed, Ephesians. 1.13. even the Spirit of
Truth, and the Comforter, who shall abide with three for ever, Joh. 14.16, 17.
That by the spirit of Wisdom that he has given thee, Ephesians. 1.17. Col. 1.9. and
1 Cor. 12.8. Thou may be able to comprehend what is the breadth, and length,
and depth, and height of his love, O that I knew where to find thee!
Ephesians. 3.18. And know when to find him on the Throne of Grace, and cry Abba,
Father, Romans 8.15. For he calls thee, Matthew. 11.28. and 25.34. Joh. 7.37.1 Cor.
1.9. Romans 8.28. And will not hide himself from his own flesh, Isa. 58.7. Yea,
he has descended from the Heavens, and came out of the bosom, Fo. 1.28. of the
Father, Ephesians. 4.9, 10.1 Tim. 1.15. Joh. 16.17. and 17.8. to seek thee, Luke
19.10. Ez. 34.11, 16. to find thee, Ma. 18.12, 14. Luke 15.24. and to save
thee, Ma. 1.21. and 18.11. Joh. 3.15, 16. and to take thee where he is, that
thou may dwell with him, and be one with him for ever, Joh. 17.21. Let not
therefore his dread, Job 13.21. nor thine own trouble and anguish, Job 15.24,
make thee afraid, and think that his faithfulness and loving kindness shall
ever fail, And remember thee of the word
Psalm. 89.33. Isa. 54.10. For, he who is abundant in goodness and truth, Exodus
34.6. the Lord God of Truth, Psalm. 31.5. whose words are Truth, Ioh. 17.17.
enduring to all Generations, Psalm. 100.5. and who is Truth, Ioh. 14.6. will not
deny himself, 2 Timothy 2.13. nor give his glory to another, Isa. 42.8. and 48.11.
for he will bear testimony to the word of his Grace, My hope is as the giving
up of the, etc.
Act. 14.3. and albeit thy hopes be well nigh lost, Ez. 37.11. yet thy faithful
Creator, 1. Pet. 2.19. who formed thee, Isa. 43.1. and 44.2. and 21.24. the God
of hope, Romans 15.13. who has begotten thee to a lively hope, I Pet. 1.3. which
hope thou have, as an Anchor of the Soul, Heb. 6.19. will sustain thee with the
right hand of his righteousness, Isa. 41.10. He gives strength to him that
faints, and to him that has no strength he increases power, Isa. 40.29. He
will not forget thee, Isa. 49.15, 19. The needy shall not always be forsaken:
the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever, Psalm. 9.18.

Will he destroy? No: He loves the works of his own hand, Wilty thou destroy
Job 14.15. Though he cause grief, yet will he show compassion, according to
the multitude of his mercies, Lam. 3.32. He is the Sovereign preserver of
mankind, delights not in the destruction of sinners, Job 7.20. Psalm. 36.6. and
33.11. 2 Pet. 3.9. for mercy pleases him, Mich. 7.18. and precious in his
sight is the death of his Saints, Psalm. 16.15.

The Soul.
O but I am at my wits end, Psalm. 107.27. I know not what to do, 2 Chr. 20.12.
All refuge fails me, there is none at the right hand to help me, nor at the
left hand to care for my Soul, Psalm. 142.4. My strength and my hope is perished
from the Lord, Lam. 3.18. Psalm. 22.14, etc 15. And my Soul refuses to be
comforted, Ier. 15.18. Psfal. 77.2.

The Comforter.
He that believes makes no haste, At my wits end
Isa. 28.16. Stand still and thou shall see the salvation of the Lord, Exodus
14.13. who will perfect and perform all things for thee, Psalm. 57.2. Psalm.
138.8. And make thee likewise able to do all things through his strength, Phil.
4.13. Stay thy self upon the Name of the Lord, and he will keep thee in perfect
peace, Isal. 26.3. Cast thy burden upon the Lord, he will not suffer thee to be
moved, Psalm. 55.22. For, All resuge fails me.
he who is thy resuge and thy portion in the land of the living, Psalm. 142.5.
well knows how to deliver his own out of troubles, 2 Pet. 2.9. Thy help is in
the Name of the Lord, who created the Heavens and the Earth, the Sea, and all
that therein is; and keeps fidelity for every Psalm. 124.8. He is thy help and
thy shield, Psalm. 115.9, 10, 11. Psalm. 121.2. Isa. 41.10, 13, 14. Isa. None at
the right hand --
44.2. Hosea 13.9. His left hand is under thy head, and his right hand does
embrace thee, Cant. 2.6. Trust thou always in the Lord, for with the Lord
Jehovah there is everlasting My strength and my hope
continually, Psalm. 71.5, 14. For the hope of Israel, Ier. 14.8. And thy hope
in the evil day, Ier. 17.17. Who is the strength of thy heart, Psalm. 27.1. and
73.26. Will fill thee with all joy and peace in believing, that thou may
abcund in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost, Romans 15.13. Let Christ who
is the hope of all the ends of the Earth, Psalm. 65.5. Be in the hope of glory,
Col. 1.27. Wherefore guird up the loins of thy mind, and hope unto the end, 1
Pet. 1.13. And let not the consolations of God be small with thee, Refuses to
be comforted
Job. 15.11. For the God of all consolation, 2 Cor. 1.3, 4, 5. who comfort
all that are cast down, 2 Cor. 7.6. who sent his Son: to (revive, Isa. 57.15.)
And bind up the broken hearted, to give unto them that mourn Beauty for Ashes,
the Oil of Joy for Mourning, the garment of praise, for the spirit of
heaviness, Isa. 61.1, and 3. Bids thee arise and shine, and put or brightness
and glory, for the Lord shall be a light unto thee in darkness, Isa. 60.2. As
one, whom his mother comfort, so will he comfort all that mourn, Isa. 66.13.
Why should thy Soul then be disquieted? for the Father of mercies, and God of
all comfort, 2 Cor. 1.3. speaks comfortably unto thee, Isa. 40. Hos. 2.14.
Isa. 40.1. He will comfort Zion and her Mourners, Isa. 51.3. and 61.2. The Lord
thy God will have thee to serve him with joyfulness and gladness of heart,
Deuteronomy. 28.47. and always to rejoice in him, Phil. 4.4. Isa. 41.16. For there is
nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his affairs, because that is
his portion, Eccles. 3.12.22. etc 5.17. and 2.24.

The Soul.
He has shown himself so marvelous upon me, Job. 5.9. that astonishment has
taken me, Ier. 8.21. My soul is sore xexed, Psalm. 6.8. and my heart sore pained
within me, Psalm. 55.4, 5. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and
horror has overwhelmed me, Ibid. He has thrust sore at me, till I am fallen,
Psalm. 118.13. VVo is me, because wrath is gone forth against me, Ruth 1.13. The
Almighty has dealt bitterly with me, Ibidem, 20. The joy of my heart is ceased,
Lam. 5.15.

The Comforter.
Though his ways be in the dark, Psalm. 18.9, 11. and 97.2. which for the
present may seem marvelous in thine eyes, Shown himself marvelous.
Psalm. 118.23. yet in the end shall they bring forth an excellent and eternal
weight of glory, 2 Cor. 4.17. For he is only wise, Romans 16.27. and his love
pasleth all knowledge, Ephesians. 3.19. If sorrow therefore has filled thy heart for
a season, My Soul, etc.
1 Pet. 16. yet let not thy heart be troubled, My heart sore pined, etc.
neither fear, Isa. 53.4. and 4.10. and 43.5. Ier. 46.27, 28. for thy heart
shall live for ever, Psalm. 22.26. And rejoice in the Lord, Zeeh. Ie. 7. Go to
the Savior of the World, the Prince of Life, Act. 3.15. and 5.31. and he will
give thee ease to thy soul, Mat. 11.28. He will rejoice over thee, Isa. 62.5.
Ier. 32.41. And thou shall rejoice in his salvation, Psalm. 9.14. and 13.5. and
20.5. and 35.9. Why is thy soul cast down, and why is it disquieted within
thee? Psalm. 42.5. and 43.5. For he, even he it is that comforts thee, that
upholds and confirms thee by the right hand of his righteousness, Isa. 41.10.
Let not thy heart be trouble, Fearfulness and trambling.
Ioh. 14.27. Luk 12.32. Fear not, for thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel is
with thee; be not afraid; for he is thy God, Isa. 41.10, 14. Isa. 54.4. and
44.2, 8. and 43.1, 5. Ier. 30.10. Though his wrath lying hard upon thee. Psalm.
88.7. should press thee sore, Psalm. 38.2. and cast thee down, Psalm. 42.6. yet
when thou fallest, thou shall rife again, Psalm. 37.24. and 102.10. And through
his wrath thou be now troubled, Psalm. 90.7. And his fierce wrath burning
like fire, VVo is me because wrath is gone, etc.
Psalm. 89.46. goes over thee, Psalm. 88.16. yet in wrath will he remember
mercy, Hab. 3.2. and take away all his wrath, Psalm. 85.3. and turn himself from
the fierceness of his anger, Ibid. For when Tribulations have abounded,
Consolations shall abound much more, 2 Cor. 15. He will deal with thee
bountifully according to his mercy, Psalm. 119.17. and 124. Psalm. 142.7. Psalm.
13.6. Psalm. 116.6. And not according to thy corrupt ways and wicked doings, Ez.
20.44. Psalm. 103.10. for though he has visited thy transgressions with the rod,
and thy iniquities with stripes, nevertheless his loving kindness will he not
utterly take from thee, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail, Psalm. 89.32, 33,
34. He will not give thee over unto death, Psalm. 118.18. But assuredly show
thee greater and mightier things, than thou art able to speak, or think, Ier.
33.3. Let his rod comfort thee, Dealt bitterly with me.
Psalm. 23.4. and it shall show thee the secrets of wisdom, Job 11.6. And the
paths of life, Psalm. 16.11. For the Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing
the heart, Psalm. 19.8. Though thou art in heaviness for a season, through
manifold temptations, 1 Pet. 1.6. yet will he make thee to drink of the rivers
of his pleasures; for with him is the fountain of life, and in his light shall
thou see light, The joy of my heart is ceased.
Psalm. 36.8, 9. Then shall thou know the joyful sound, and walk in the light of
his countenance. In his name shall thou walk all the day, and in his
righteousness shall thou be exalted, Psalm. 89.15, 16. The righteous shall be
glad in the Lord, Psalm. 64.10. Let them rejoice before God, yea, let them
exceedingly rejoice. Psalm. 68.3. and draw waters with joy out of the Wells of
Consolation, Isa. 12.3. and Isa. 66. from the 10. to the 16. Thou shall obtain
everlasting joy, Isa. 35.10. and 51.^1. and 61.7. which none takes from thee,
Ioh. 16.22. And sorrow and sighing shall fly away, Isa. 35.10. Then shall thy
joy be fulfilled, and remain in thee, Ioh. 15.11. For the kingdom of God does
flourish in righteousness and peace, with abundance of joy in the Holy Ghost,
Romans 14.17.

The Soul.
I am pressed out of measure above strength, 2 Cor. 1.8. And see no way to
esape, Isa. 20.6. How long will thou forget me, O Lord? Psalm. 13.1. How long
will thou be angry? Psalm. 79.5. and 85.5. and 80.4. How long shall I cry, and
thou will not hear? Hab. 1.2. Why castest thou off my soul, and hidest thy face
from me? Psalm. 10.1. Psalm. 44.24. Job 13.24. Psalm. 89.46. and 88.14. Why are
thou so far from helping me, and from the voice of my roaring? Psalm. 22.1.

The Comforter.

but meek, Math. 11.29. and 21, 5. slow to anger, Neb. 4.17. Psalm. 103.8. And
of great kindness, Joel 2.13. Ion. 4.2. since he spoke against thee, he does
earnestly remember thee still, he will surely have mercy upon thee, Jer. 31.20.
As the Hen gathers her Chickens under her wings Matthew. 23.37. so will he
cover thee with his feathers, Psalm. 91.4.

The Soul.
But alas, I fear he has not set his love upon me, Deuteronomy. 7.7. He has alienated
his mind, Ezekiel. 23.18. And taken away his peace, even his loving kindness and
mereies, Ier. 16.5. Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and
sorrow? That my days should be consumed with shame, Jerem. 20.18. Job 3.11.

The Comforter.
The faithful God Who keeps Covenant and mercy He has not set his love, etc;
Deuteronomy. 7.9. has said that he will love thee freely, Hos. 14.4. That he will
love thee with an everlasting love, Fer. 31.3. 2. These. 2.16. Greater love
could no man have, than this love, that made him lay down his lise for his
friends, John 15.13. Herein has he commended his love toward thee, in that
when thou wast yet a sinner, he died for thee, Romans 5.8. God so loved thee,
that he gave thee his only begotten Son, through whom thou might be saved,
John 3.16, 17. No man knows either love or hatred by all that is before him,
Eccl. 9.1. But in this was the love of God manifest to thee, that he sent his
only begotten into the world, that thou might live through him; and that he
might be a propitiation for thy sins, I John 3.9, 10. Hereby may thou well
perceive the love of God (who is the God of love, 2 Cor. 13.1. and all love, I
John 4.8, 16.) That he laid down his life, and gave himselt for thee, 1 John
3.16. Gal. 2.20. Wherein thou may behold what manner of love the Father has
bestowed upon thee, that thou should be called one of the sons God, I Joh.
3.1. He is thy Father doubtless, he is thy Father, 2 Cor. 6.18. Isa. 63.16. and
so chastises thee, not because he is cruel, but even as a Father does the Son
in whom he delights, Prove. 3.12. Heb. 12.5, 6. Rev. 3.19. He that cannot lie
Number. 23.19. has said, That he will be thy Father, Isa. 9.6. Jer. 3.9. Luke
12.32. Isa. 64.8. Ma. 6.9. Be strong in the Lord therefore, and in the power of
his might, Ephesians. 6.10. And be thou persuaded, that nothing shall be able to
separate thee from the love of the God which is in Christ Jesus, Alienated his
mind.
Romans 8.38, 39. In him there is no varriation, nor shadow of change, Mal. 3.6.
Jam, 1.17. And therefore his loving kindness shall never depart, Psalm. 89.32,
33, etc. Isa 54.10, 11. The FAther himself loves thee, John 16.27. whose good
pleasure it is to give thee the Kingdom, Luke 12.32. and 22.19. Seeing
therefore his gifts and graces are without repentance, Romans 11.29. He will not
take away his feace from thee, Take away his peace.
but enlarge it as a River, Isa. 66.12. He will reveal to thee abundance of
peace, Fer. 33.6. And none shall take thy joy from thee, John 16.22. and 15.11.
For his sure mercies, Isa. 55.3. are everlasting Pfal. 138.8. And his loving
kindness shall never fail, Even his loving kind uesss
Psalm. 89.33. He is of thy flesh and bones, Fohn 1.14. Rev. 1.3.2. COR. 4.11.
And no man ever yet hated, but rather cherished his own flesh, Ephesians. 5.29, 30.
So that well may thou be persuaded of the Eternal Love of God in Chrifst
Jesus, Romans 8.38, 39. Jer. 31.3. And blessed art thou of the Father, who for
thee prepared an everlasting kingdom. Mat. 25.34. Who created thee, Wherefore
came I out of the womb?
and took thee out of the womb, Job 10.18. Psalm 22.9. that thou might see
thae goodness of the Lord in the Land of the Living, Psalm. 27.13. That being
guided by his Council, Psalm. 73.29. Through the many Tribulations, Fohn 16.13.
Act. 14.22. of an evil world, Gal. 14.22. of an evil world, Gal. 1.4. thou
might have Grace, Psalm. 84.11. Romans 1.5. Ephesians. 2.7. to see his manifold
wisdom, Ephesians. 3.11. and afterward be received into glory, Psalm. 73.24. and
84.11. For he created thee, that thou mighst glorify him, 1 Cor. 10.31. Romans
11.36. Psalm. 145.1, 2, 21. and be glorified o him, Romans 8.30. John 17.24. and
enjoy him for ever, Psalm. 73.24, to the end. That he might so make known the
richness of his glory on thee a verssel of mercy, whom he had before prepared
unto glory, Romans 9.23.

The Soul.
Have thou indeed utterly rejected, have thou made thy soul to loath me? Ier.
14.19. Are thy mercies quite gone for ever? Will thou be favorable no more?
Has the word of Promise failed for ever more? Psalm. 77.7, 8, 9. Did not my Lord
and Savior, Psalm. 110.11. Isa. 45.14, 21. and 49.26. and 60.16. and 63.8. Ier.
14: 8. Hos 13.4. Luke 1.47. and 2.11. John 4.42. I John 4.14. (who professed
that he was troubled in all my troubles, Isa. 53.4. and bade me also believe in
him, John 14.1. and I John 3.23. Act. 16.3.) Did he not tell me that he would
pray the Father, and he would send the Comforter to abide with me for ever,
John 14.16. But alas, where is the promise of his coming? I Pet. 3.4. The
Comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me, Lam. 1.16. The Harvest is
past, and the Summer is gone, and I am not saved, 10.8.20. I looked for peace,
and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble, Ier.
14.19. My soul faints for his salvation, Psalm. 119.81. And will he be
altogether to me as liar, and as the waters that fail, Ier. 15.18.

The Comforter.
No, no: the Lord will not cast off his people, Have thou utterly rejected?
Psalm. 94.14. The purpose of God according to Election shall stand, Romans 9.11.
He will not abhor thee for his Name sake; He will not disgrace the Throne of
his glory; He will remember, and not break his Covenant, Ier. 14.21. The
Covenant of his peace shall not be removed, Isa: 54.9, 10. Ier. 33.20, 21, 22.
and 31.33, 34, etc. Ezekiel. 37.26! For he is God, the faithful God, that keeps
Covenant and Mercy, Deuteronomy. 9.4. His soul delights in thee, Isa. 42.1. and
62.4. Deuteronomy. 7.8. yea, he will rejoice over thee, to do thee good, with his
whole soul, and his whole heart assuredly, Ier. 32.41.

The Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting, Are thy mercies quite gone?
and his truth endures to all Generations, Psalm. 100.5. and 103.17. Isa.
45.17. and 54.8. He will not fail thee, Deuteronomy 31.8. Ios. 1.5. Heb. 13.5.1. Chr.
18.20. But assuredly remember his holy promise, Psalm. 105.42. I John 2.25. Wait
thou therefore upon the Lord, and be of good courage, Psalm. 27. last. Isa.
25.9. For the Father has put the Times in his own power, Act. 1.7. And will not
leave thee comfortless; he will come unto thee, John 14.18. The Prince of
peace, Isa. 9.6. has left his peace with thee, John 14.27. despise not
therefore the consolations of the Almighty, Job 15.11. For he will restore
health unto thee, he will heal thee of thy wounds, Jer. 30.17. His salvation is
gone forth, and his righteousness shall not be abolished, Isa. 51.6. and 54.10.
Jerem. 31.35, 36. He will bring thee health and cure, he will cure thee, and
reveal unto thee the abundance of peace and truth, Jerem. 33.6. Behold, the day
is come, Has the word of promise sailed?
that he will perform the good things that he has promised, Jer. 33.14, 20.
For he satisfies the longing soul, and silleth the hungry soul with goodness,
Psalm. 107.9. Isa. 41.17. The needy shall not always be forgotten, Psalm. 9.18.
I looked for peace.
He that has made an everlasting Covenant of peace with thee, Ezekiel. 37.36. Isa.
51.6. and 54.10. and is become thy God, Psalm. 63.1. Is the God of Truth, John
14.6. Psalm. 31.5. Psalm. 146.6. I John 5.6. Rev. 3.7, 14. and 6.10. and no liar,
Number. 23.19. His faithfulness reaches to the Clouds, Ps. 36.5. He will be
justified in all his sayings, Romans 3.4. Faithful is he that has promised, Will
he be unto me as a liar?
Heb. 10.23. and I These. 5.24. He is full of grace and truth, Joh. 1.14. In him
are all the promises, Yea, and Amen, 2 Cor. 1.20. and 17. He will assuredly
perform his mercy and his truth, Psalm. 138.8. Jer. 33.14. Psalm. 146.6. And what
he has said, that will he do; what he has spoken, that will he make good, Number.
23.19.

The Soul.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged, for I am desolate, and fore afflicted,
Psalm. 25.16, 17. The Lord has wounded me with the wounds of an enemy, and
chastised me with the chastisements of a cruel one, Jer. 30.14. He has taken
from me my strenth, the joy of my glory, the delight: of mine eyes, and that
whereupon I set my mind, Ez. 24.25. Verily verily, he has caused me to pass
under the Rod, Ez. 20.37: I have found trouble and sorrow, Psalm. 116.3. For I
am poor and needy, Psalm. 86.1. and 70.5. And my heart is sore pained within me,
Psalm. 55.4. Jer. 4.19. Psalm. 6.4.

The Comforter.
The Lord will not forsake for ever, The sorrows of my heart.
but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the
multitude of his mercies, Lam. 3.31, 32. Sorrow is better than laughter,
Eccles. 7.3. Yet the Lord shall even give thee rest from thy sorrow, Isa. 14.3.
Ma. 11.29. which shall be turned unto joy, John 16.20. And thou shall have no
more sorrow, Rev. 21.4. Jer. 31.12. He who beholds thy desolations, I am
desolate.
Dan. 9.18. Exodus 3.7. and 4.31. will deliver thy desolate soul, Psalm. 22.20.
and 25.16. and 35.17. He will give thee a reviving, and repair thy desolations,
Ezra 9.9. Count it therefore exceeding joy, when thou fallest into diverse
temptations, Jam. 1.2. For whom the Lord loves he chast'neth, Pro. 3.4. And as
thou art partaker of these sufferings, so shall thou be likewise of the
consolations, Sore afflicted.
2 Cor. 1.4, 7. By afflications art thou magnified, Job 17.17. that the trial
of thy precious faith may be manifest, 1 Pet. 1.17. and Patience may have her
perfect work, James 1.4. and be found unto praise, and honor, 1 Pet. 17. and
to thy rejoicing with joy unspeakable, and full of glory, 1. Pet. 18. Like as
he has watched over thee to pluck thee up, and cast thee down to afflict and
destroy thee, Jer. 31.28. and has brought all this evil upon thee, so will he
bring upon thee all the good that he has promised thee, Jer. 32.42. And thou
shall not remember thy reproach any more, Isa, Chastised me.
54.4. If thou be smitten of God and afflicted, Isa. 53.4. it was good for thee
(and also needful, I Pet. 2.) that thou have been so, Psalm. 119.71. He that
delivers the poor in all their afflictions, Job 36.15. Psalm. 132.1.
regards, Psalm. 102.17. and is sore troubled at thine, Isa. 63.9. He will have
mercy upon thee, Isa. 14.1. and 49.13. and 54.8. and 55.7. And happy art thou
whom he corrects, Job 15.17. For whom the Lord loves he corrects, as a
Father does the Son in whom he delights, Prove. 3.12. Heb. 12.6. Rev. 3.19. And
though thou be now in heaviness for a season, through manifold tribulation, I
Pet, 1.6. yet the Scorpion Rods wherewith thou have been chastised, I King
12.11. and 2 Chro. 10.11, 14. shall blossom as the Rose, Isa. 35.1. shall
blossom abundantly, verse. 2. For as the Earth brings forth her Buds, and as
the Garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord
will cause thy righteousness, and thy praise to spring forth, Isa. 61.11. Do
thou well then to be angry, that God has prepared a Worm to smite thy Gourd,
Taken from me my strength, etc.
whereof thou were so exceeding glad, Jonah 4.6, 7, 8. When he had pity on
thee, to deliver thee out of the belly of Hell, Jonah 2.2, 10: And the Lord thy
God brought up thy life from corruption, Jonah 2.6. Thy true joy shall no man
take from thee, John 16.21. A man's life consists not in the abundance of
things which he possesses, Luke 12.15. The Lord knows the thoughts of men,
that they are all vanity, Psalm. 94.11. 1 Cor. 3.20. Let him therefore that
glories, glory in the Lord, Ier. 9.24. 1 Cor. 1.31. In whom all things are
ours, 1 Cor. 3.23. And think that blessed is he alone whose God is the Lord,
Psalm. 144.8. and whose hopes is in the Lord his God, Psalm. 146.5. who trusts
in the Lord, in whom there is everlasting strength, Isa. 26.4. For surely
goodness and mercy shall follow him all the days of his life, and he shall
dwell in the house of God for ever, Psalm. 23.6. In the mean time with his Rod
will he feed thee, Mic. 7.14. and comfort thee, Pass under the Rod --
Psalm. 23.4. Many indeed are the Tribulations of the Righteous, but the Lord
deivereth them out of them all, Psalm. 34.6, 17, 18. Job 5.19. Though thou
walk in the midst of troubles, Psalm. 138.7. yet he who is thy strength in
time of trouble, Psalm. 37.39. and a very present help, Psalm. 46.1. is with
thee, Psalm. 91.15. to give thee help, Psalm. 60.11, 12. to deliver thee, I found
trouble.
Psalm. 91.1.1 and 54.7. and 91.15. and bring thy soul out of trouble, Psalm.
143.11. Thy sorrows shall fly away, Isa. 35.10. and 51.11. Rev. 21.4. Thou
shall sorrow no more at all, Ier. 31.12. Thy heart shall rejoice; yea, it shall
rejoice in the Lord, Zech. 10.7. and thou shall remember thy miseries no more,
Psalm. 31.7. And though thou be now poor, I am poor and needy.
and sorrowful, Ps. 69.23. Ps. 86.1. and 109.22. Though the increase of thy
house be departed, and all thy goods be fled away in the day of Gods angew with
thee, Job. 20.28. yet the Lord is able to give thee much more, than all these
things, 2 Chro. 25.9. He sets the poor on high from affliction, Psalm.
107.41. He delivers the needy when he cries, the poor also, and him that
has no helper, Psalm. 72.12. Jer. 20.13. Seeing then he has freely given thee
all things, Romans 8.32. and has promised to make all things work together for
thy good, verse. 28. how can poverty separate thee from the love of God in
Christ Jesus? Romans 8.35. And therefore, although the Fig-true should not
blossom, neither should fruit be in the Vine, the labor of the Olive should
fail, and the Field should yield no meat, the flecks should be cut off from the
fold, and there should be no herd in the stalls, rejoice thou notwithstanding
in the Lord, and joy in the God of thy salvation, Habak. 17.18. Nothing shall
be wanting, Psalm. 34.9. All good things shall be ministered, Mat. 6.33. and God
shall supply all thy needs, Phil. 4.19. Psalm. 34.8, 9, 10. and 84.11.

The Soul.
He had broken me with his Eastwind, in the midst of the Sea, Ezekiel. 27.26. I
sink into deep waters, where the floods overflow me, Psalm. 69.2. The sea is
come upon me, I am covered with the multitude of the waves thereof, Jer. 51.42.
The waters compassed me about unto the Soul, Jer. 2.5. all thy surges, and all
thy waves passed over me, verse. 3. Psalm. 42.7. and 88.7. I cried in my
affliction unto the Lord, Psalm. 18.6. and 30.2, 3. Psalm. 119.145, 156. and
130.1. Out of the belly of Hell cried I, Jonah 2.2. What profit is there in my
blood, when I go down to the pit? Psalm. 30.9. But my Rock and my Lord was
silent unto me, and answered me not, Prove. 1.28. Psalm. 28.1.2 Sam. 22.42. Psalm.
18.41. He cares not that I perish, Mark 4.38.

The Comforter.
Be of good cheer. John 14.1. and encourage thyself, He has broken me --
1 Samuel 30.6. O thou of little faith! Mat. 8.26. and 14.31. and 16.8. He will
not break the bruised Reed, Isa. 42.3. nor a leaf driven to and fro, Job.
13.25. Believe God that it shall be, even as it was told thee, Act. 27.25. When
thou passest through the waters, he will be with thee, Is. 43.2. The
water-floods shall not overflow thee, Sink in deep waters --
Psalm. 22.6. The deep shall not swallow thee up, he will not let the horrible
pit shut her mouth upon thee, Psalm. 69.15. Though innumerable evils do compass
thee about, The waters compassed me.
Psalm. 40.12. As the multitude of many waters, Jonah 2.5. Psalm. 42.7. and 88.7.
yet he that trusts in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about also, All thy
waves.
Psalm. 32.10. He will rebuke the winds and the waves, and speak unto the sea,
Mark 4.39. For he is the confidence of all those that are afar off upon the
sea, Psalm. 65.5. And when thou cryest unto the Lord, I cried in my affliction:
he will restore thee, Psalm. 30.2. He will bring thy soul out of the grave, and
will revive thee from them that go down into the pit, verse. 3. The Lord thy God
will bring up thy life from the pit, Jonah 2.6. The Sea shall render up her
dead, Rev. 20.13. The hearer of prayers, Psalm. 65.2. will regard, and not
despise the prayers of the afflicted, Psalm. 102.17. He will hear thy voice; for
salvation is of the Lord, Jonah 2.2, 6, 7, 9. Psalm. 10.17. and 17.6. Mic. 7.7.
and 145.19. Thy heavenly Father, Mat. 6.14. and 26.42. The Sovereign preserver
of men, Job. 7.20. who delights not in the destructions of sinners, Ezekiel.
37.11. will hear the groaning of the prisoner, Psalm. 102.20. and 10.7. and
17.6. His ears are open to thy cry, Psalm. 34.15. When thou cryest he will
answer thee, Psalm. 91.15. and 99.6. and 50.15. Ier. 19.12. He that cannot
forget thee, Isa. 49.50. and 49.15. cares for thee, He cares not --
1 Pet. 5.7. He remembers thee carnestly still, therefore his bowels are moved
for thee; he will surely have mercy upon thee, Ier. 31.20. He that has so loved
thee, as to give his dear Son (who did also pour out even his foul unto the
death for thee, That I preish.
Isa. 53.10, 12.) that thou might not perish, will he now abandon the works
of his own hands? Romans 8.31, Which he has bought with a price of so infinite a
value, 1 Cor. 6.20. and 7.23. and 2 Pet. 2.1. If he reconciled thee to God his
Father, while thou were yet an enemy, how much more being now joined to him by
affinity, Isa. 9.6. and 63.16. Ier. 31.9. Romans 8.5. Gal. 4.6. Ephesians. 5.30. and
consanguinity, Ier. 3.14. Hos. 1.10. Can. 4.9. and 5.1. Will he care for thy
soul? 1 Pet. 5.7. Romans 5.10. Now that she is so precious in his sight, Isa.
43.4. purified, beautified with his Graces, Can. 7.1, 2, etc. covered with the
Robes of his Righteousness, Isa. 61.10. 1 Cor. 1.3. and 2 Cor. 5.21. and one
with himself, Joh. 17.21. And that thou may know what manner of love he
carries to thee, 1 John 3.1, 2. He has given thee the earnest of the Spirit of
Adoption for a pledge, Romans 8.15, 16. Ephesians. 1.5.2. Cor. 1.22. Gal. 4.6. The Oil
of joy for Mourning, the garments of Gladness for Heaviness, Isa. 61.3. And the
first fruits of Life Eternal, Romans 8.23. Yea, if the Son of God dwell in thee
himself, 1 Ioh. 4.13. Ephesians. 3.17. And the holy Ghost make a Temple of thy body,
1 Cor. 3.16. and 6.19. 2 Cor. 6.16. How can thou but be beloved, precious and
honorable in his sight? Isa. 43.4. Psalm. 116.15. If a good man regards the
life of his beast, Pro. 12.10. How much more will he, who preserves man and
beast? Psalm. 36.6. that feeds the fowls of the air, and clothes the grafs of
the field, Mat: 6.25, 26, 30. who cannot forget the silly Sparrows, Luke 12.4.
and has numbered the hairs of thy had, verse. 5. deliver thine eyes from tears,
and thy soul from death? Psalm. 116.8. seeing he has made thee a little lower
than the Angels, crowned thee with honor and glory, and made thee to have
dominion over the works of his hands, putting all things under thy feet, Psalm.
8.5, 6.

The Soul.
O he is holy, and I am but a worm, Psalm. 22.3. Isa. 41.14. Job 25.6. Though I
have made him my everlasting Joy, my Glory, and my God, Isa. 60.19. yet has he
filled me with bitterness, and made me drunk with Wormwood, Lam. 3.15. He has
made me the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people, Lam. 3.45. and
broken me, Psalm. 38.8. and 44.19. Ez. 27.26. with a tempest, Job 9.17. Psalm.
11.6 and 83.15. Of his indignation poured out upon me, Psalm. 78.49. Ez. 22.31:
Zeph. 3.8. He bade me come unto him, that I might have peace and rest to my
soul, Mat. 11.28. and that I may get life, Ioh. 5.40. yet when I engaged my
heart to approach unto him, Ier. 30.21. and poured out my complaint before him,
like the waters, Job 3.24. Psalm. 142.2. And looked up unto my Father, Psalm.
5.3. Isa. 45.22. Mich. 7.7. till mine eyes failed, Deuteronomy. 28.32. Job. 11.20.
making my supplication to my Judge, Job 9.15. He notwithstanding covers
himself with a cloud, that my prayers should not pass through, Lam. 3.44. He
puts away his Servant in anger, Psalm. 27.9. and casts me out from his presence,
Psalm. 51.11. to the loathing of my person, Ez. 16.5. Zech. 11.8. Pro. 13.5.
Lam. 2.6. O did ever man thus hate his own flesh! Ephesians. 5.29. And shall his
faithfulness even fail in my destruction? Psalm. 88.11.

The Comforter.
And will thou indeed thus foolishly charge, I have made him my everlasting
joy, etc. But he made me the offscouring.
Job. 1.22. the Lord God of Truth, Deuteronomy. 32.4. Psalm. 31.5. 1 John 5.6. and make

rather think it exceeding joy when thou fallest into diverse temptations, Jam.

condemned with the world, 1 Cor. 11.32. And if thou be without chastisement,
then art thou a Bastard, and not a Son, Heb. 12.8. Thy God has punished thee,
and exacted less than thy iniquities deserve, Ezr. 9.13. Job. 11.6. If thou
acceptest of the punishment of thy iniquities, then will he remember his

born thy shame, Ez. 39.25, 26. And will not hide his face any more from thee,

10.16. Ezekiel. 16.60. Isa. 43.25. Jer. 31.34. Joh. 17. -- and make every thing
work together for thy good, Romans 8.28. He will not forget, Isa. 49.15. and
54.9. Psalm. 25.6. the greatness of his mercies, Psalm. 57.10. and 86.13. and
108.4. Isa. 54.7. and multitude of his compassions, Psalm. 69.13. and 51.1. and
78.38. and 86.15. and 111.4. and 145.8. and 112.4. But as thy sufferings
abound, so shall thy consolations abound also, 1 Cor. 2.5. And though he should
bring thee to naught, Bring me to naught.

pleasures for evermore, Psalm. 16.11. Be of good courage therefore, and wait
upon the Lord, Psalm. 27.14. and 31.24. For he has seen, he has seen thy
afflictions, Exodus 3.7. Deuteronomy. 26.7. Acts 7.24. which have not made thee vile, I
am become vile.

loves thee, created thee for his glory, and formed thee, Isa. 43.3, 4, 7. who
thought not the world worthy of thee, Heb. 11.38. and spared not his own Son,
but gave him to die for thee, Romans 8.32. and has made thee Son and Heir of God
through Christ, Tit. 3.7. Gal. 4.7.

is spent with grief, and my years with sighing, Psalm. 31.10. Innumerable evils

with thee, than against thee, 1 Kings 6.16, 17. The Angel of the Lord encampeth

The Soul.
If I say I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and
comfort my self; then am I afraid of all my sorrows, Job. 9.27, 28. When I
would comfort my self against sorrow, my heart is faint within me, Ier. 8.18.
For through sorrow of heart my spirit is broken, Pro. 15.13.

of Men, Pro. 8.31. In the multitude of thy thoughts, A fraid of all my sorrows.

strengthened with might, Ephesians. 3.16. Why should thou faint? 2 Cor. 4.16. and
suffer thy spirit to be broken? Psa. 42.5, 11. and 143.7. and not rather be
glad in the Lord, Psa. 32.11. Phil. 1.4. and 3.1. and rejoice with him, who
(though he was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, Is. 53.35. yet)
rejoiced in spirit, that the Father should have revealed the Eternal Counsel of
his Good Will to be the matter of thy continual joy, Luke 10.20, 21.

The Soul.
What shall I say then after this? Ezra 9.10. Romans 6.1. He who did bear my
iniquities, and carried my sorrows; he who was wounded for my transgression,
and broken for my iniquities, Isa. 53.4. Is he not able to justify me? verse
11. Shall not his soul which he poured out unto death, verse 12. be a
sufficient offering for my sin? verse 10. Is not he that did tread the

1.28. And this is the will of God, That whosoever believes in his Sor, should
have life everlasting, John 6.40. and 20.31. In him shall thou be justified and
shall glory, Isa. 45.25. Romans 3.24, 28. and 5.1. Tit. 3.7. Thou wast bought
with a price, 1 Cor. 6.20. -- purchased with the precious blood to Christ, A
sufficient effering.

Mother of Harlots, Rev. 17.5. appointed unto destruction, verse. 18.10, 22.
