Liberties.

WHat makes the Soldiers

It Is for what they professed,
To keep us from harms,
The M(...)b^s Seclud^d
Come now in by Swarms,
To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full,
To fill up the Parliament Full.
You know that the City G^tes,
Late were thrown down,
The Walls too were ordered
By Parliament Frown:
But General Monck, ^as pleased
Soldier and Gown,
And filled, etc.
A dispute there was had,
By the Members Secluded,
Brave Monck was the mpire,
And found them Deluded,
But Englands great joy,
Is now wholly Concluded,
For He Is filled, etc.
Sir Arthur she Valiant,
Must make his Speech large,
Lest the Members Excluded,
Lay Treason to's Charge,
He d better t have dealt,
Which his Newcastle Barge,
Than to see the Old Parliament full, full, full
Than to see the Old Parliament full.
The Aldermen Grave,
And the Commons o'th City,
Imprisoned were,
The more is the pity,
But Genral Monck said,
That I will acquit ye,
For the Parliament now shall be full, full, full
For the Parliament now shall be full.


THe Parliament now will
come into their Geers
For secl^ded Prin^^^
(that once lost his ears)
Ma^cht in witth his Rapier
for Commons and Peers,
To fill up the Parliament full, full, full,
To fill up the Parliament full.
Whose often declaring,
Has furnished the Nation
With Parliament Arguments,
Of the old Fashion,
And would have both
Commons, and Lords in this nation,
To fill up, etc.
Our brave General Monck,
We bound are to thank,
The Honest Lord Fairfax,
Has played (to) his Prank,
No thanks to be given,
To the Rump nor the Shank,
To fill up, etc,
Had the City never moved,
Nor the Prentices strove,
They Would lost their Old Charter,
But Monck had a love,
To challenge the Grand Ones,
Which Mischiefs old move,
And so filled up the, etc.
But now our brave Members,
Have taken their seats,
The very first day,
They did Honorable feats,
For the good of this Nation,
Which will prove no cheats,
To fill up, etc.
The Citizens ith Tower,
At Liberty they have set,
A more gallanter deed,
Was never known yet,
Then the setting them free,
And the brave Prentices to quit,
For the Parliament now shall be full, full, full
For the Parliament now shall be full.
Now to God let us pray,
That all may be mended,
That freedom may flourish,
And all strife may be ended,
For General Monck,
Has us hugely befriended,
In filling the Parliament full, full, full,
In filling the Parliament full.
