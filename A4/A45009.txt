THE HUMBLE PETITION OF RICHARD CROMWELL, Late LORD PROTECTOR of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, to the Council of Officers at Walingford House.
Humbly shows:
THAT whereas, after the Addresses of many thousands of these actions,
faithfully promising to establish me on my Fathers usurped Seat, and protesting
before God to live and die for me, whom they styled their Joshua, appointed by
God to complete that happiness to the Saints which was begun by my Father,
whom they called Moses, that had brought them out of Egypt and the Wilderness
unto the borders of Canaan, of which number you of the Army were not the last,
nor least part: Yet notwithstanding you forgeting your Promises and
Engagements, were guilty of such insolent and contrary proceedings as to turn
me out of my place before I was well warm, under the specious pretense of
setting up the Good old C^use, which then you interpreted to be the Refuse, or
(as it is commonly called) the Rump of the long Parliament; which piece of a
Parliament you had no sooner established, and vowed your selves by a solemn
Oath their faithful and constant Servants, but you turned them to graste
before they had leisure to fleece the Commomwealth. Yet for all this, you still
prosecute the Good old Cause, which since it has so many Colors, I know not
how to define it otherwise then a mere cheating of the Public: But to let that
pass, you devised a thing called a Committee of safety, which being a Crew of
Swordmen, with some others of your own Faction, appointed unto themselves a
certain time to produce a model or form of Government, which time being
expired, they ended as safely as they began, their pregnant womb being not
delivered of so much as a Mouse.

These things considered, and since you are now at a non plus, not knowing
which way to turn your selves, I humbly beg of you (Gentlemen) to let me
appear once more upon the Stage, beseeching you to restore me unto my former
dignity of being your Protector: It may be you will say, I am altogether incapable
of so great a trust: For answer; If you will believe my Mother, I am the Son of
Oliver, and think my self as wise as some of you, and much honester then the
best of you. What though I was pictured with an Owls head and a Fools Coat?
I Am sure my Brother-in-law Fleetwood (your titular Gener^l) deserves it as
well as my self; for although he had so much wit as to depose me, wherein he
showed himself more then Fool: yet when he set up the tail of the long
Parliament, and afterw^rds suffered them to be cast out by the ambition of
Lambert, he savor'd more of the later. But I pray Gentlemen consider what
profit and advantage will acrue to your selves as well as the Nation, in case
you readvance me to the Government; for I will call such a Parliament as shall
raise money for the satisfying of all Soldiers Arrears, and take a course that
they be daily paid for the future, and you your selves shall be my privy
Counselors, provided you be more accute in consulting the affairs of
Government then you have been lately in forging one. And for the good of the
Commonwealth in general, we will countenance and encourage the two main props
of a Stat^ viz. Magistracy and Ministry: But as for the dull City of London, we
may ride it to death if we please; she has been long sick of a Consumption,
but will not go to the charge of a purgation whereby she might be rid of those
humors that obstruct her welfare, occasioned by a surfeit she took of too much
of the fish called a Lobstar, which diet my Father fed her withal. But to
speak of her Lord Mayor, he is the very same to you, as his horse to him, who
with all his furred gang of Aldermen are always ready to comply with any power
whatever at its first appearance, and will ever be your enchained slaves, for
all their daily consultations at Guild Hall. These are the Golden Calves which
the City worships, and will do till it be utterly beggared by their sloth, who
had rather live in perpetual bondage then hazard their vast estates to
purchase the freedom both of themselves and their posterity; for if the
present Lord Mayor had as much wit as Friar Bacon's brazen head, and would but
say, Time is, the business would be done, and the whole City be freed from
that oppression which they have for so many years groaned under; but as long as
they are led by the nose by their Lord Mayor, and he by the Officers of the
Army, hang but one Red-coat on the top of Paul's steeple, and it is enough to
keep the City in awe, though there were never a Soldier in it.

But whilst I was penning this, there came one and told me that you had set out
a Proclamation of a Parliament to be called on the 24. of January next, without
a single Person, or House of Peers: which thing I suppose you never intend, but
only to delude the People with a bare pretense, the very name of a Parliament
being a pretty babble to still and quiet the childish rage of the City. However,
if you do perform what you say, it will be a Parliament of your own stamp,
which will bring more discontent to the People, then what they now suffer:
Besides, you will utterly cross the design of your grand Master in politics,
Lambert, who when he has done with Monk, will be as new to begin again what
he aimed at, as he was before he turned out the Epitome of the long Parliament.
Wherefore my Masters I beseech you consider what you go about, and go the
safest way to work, which will be by lifting up me again to the Protectorship:
and to this end, call to mind the discontented Frogs, who would not have the
Log to be their King; but when Jupiter set the Stork to rule over them, which
exceedingly devoured them, then they prayed him to restore their King Log. Take
heed (Gentlemen) that you do not run the same fortune as did the Frogs, left
with them you repent too late; but hearken to this seasonable, and (indeed)
reasonable advice of your Quondam Master, though now poor Petitioner.

To conclude, (my Masters) if you will be pleased to suffer me once again to
mount into the saddle of Supremacy, I protest unto you that I will not be cast
out of it but with the loss of my life. Before I will be so befooled as I was,
I Will drive on as furiously as my Father when he turned Coachman in Hide-Park,
and had like to have broken his neck for his labor: And rather then I will so
sneakingly be thrown down from the very Pinnacle of honor,

The fortune of bold Phaeton I Will run,
Who perished in the Chariot of the Sun.
