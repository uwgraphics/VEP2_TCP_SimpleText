BY THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND COUNCIL.
J. ROBERTS,

WHEREAS diverse persons who had passed Certificates from His Majesty's late
Commissioners appointed for putting in Execution the Acts of Setlement and
Explanation of such Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments as in pursuance of the
said Acts had been adjudged to belong unto them, had neglected to pass their
Letters Patents thereupon, by reason whereof His Majesty's Revenue arising by
his new Quit-Rents was very much unsettled; We therefore on the 26th of November
1669. did order and declare that all persons who had passed any Certificates
from His Majesty's said Commissioners of any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments
to be settled upon, or restored unto them, should at their perils pass their
Letters patents thereupon within four months from the date thereof. Now at the
humble petition of several Adventurers, Soldiers, and others; We think fit
hereby to order and declare, that all persons as aforesaid have three months
further time from the date hereof, for passing Letters patents upon
Certificates of the late Commissioners as aforesaid, within which time the said
Letters patents are to be past at the perils of the persons concerned.

Given at the Council Chamber in Dublin, the twentieth eight day of March
1670. Ja. Armachanus. Mich. Dublin. Canc. R. Booth. J. Temple. Paul. Davys.
