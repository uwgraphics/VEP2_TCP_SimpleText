A DECLARATION OF MR W. LENTHALL. Esquire. SPEAKER of the House of Commons, being
the reasons and grounds that moved him to absent himself from attending the
service on Friday, July 30. 1647.
ALthough it may happily be contrary to the Expectation of some, that J attend
not the service of the House of Commons at this time, as J have constantly done
for almost seven years last past; yet can it not be reasonably expected by any
that will consider the violence offered to both the Houses of Parliament, and
to my self in particular the last monday, July 26. Insomuch that J can safely
take it upon my conscience, and so J doubt not may all the Members of both
Houses also, that they sat in continual fear of their lives, and by terror
thereof were compelled to pass such Votes as it pleased an unruly multitude to
enforce upon them; which as J did then openly declare in the House, so J cannot
but believe that they are all void and Null, being extorted by force and
violence, and in that manner that they were: And J cannot any longer dispense
with my self to be an instrument in passing such Votes, and to give any color
or shadow of Parliamentary authority unto them, which were not the Votes of the
representative body of the Kingdom; but of a tumultuous multitude, as those
must needs be accounted that seemed to pass the House on Monday July 26. and
which shall pass hereafter until better provision be made for the safe and
free sitting of the Houses of Parliament; there being no effectual course
taken by the City since the adiournment of the House, to prevent the like
tumults for the future no nor so much as a Declaration from them, to show their
dislike thereof: but on the contrary, it was generally voiced in the Town,
that there would be a far greater confluence of Apprentizes, Reformado's, and
others by Friday at the Parliament doors; and particular notice was given to
me, that after they had made the House Vote what they pleased, they would
destroy me: J had likewise information given me that there would be a great
number of Apprentizes of a contrary opinion and affection to the other, about
the Parliament doors on Friday morning, which J foresaw must* of necessity
cause a great combustion, and in probability occasion much bloodshed.

The prevention of which mischief (together with the consideration aforesaid)
have weighed more with me, then any thing which may concern my particular: and
especially having served the Parliament faithfully and diligently for the space
of almost seven years in a free and Parliamentary way of proceeding: that J
might not now be made a servant to such a rude and tumultuous multitude, to
transfer upon them the color of Parliamentary authority, therewith to abuse,
and deceive the minds, and to destroy the lives, liberties and estates of the
People of this Kingdom, and having taken a solemn protestation and Covenant,
in my place and calling, to maintain the privileges of Parliament, and the
rights and liberties of the Subject, J could not now satisfy my self how J
should discharge my duty therein, but by absenting my self at this time,
rather then by my presence, to give any shadow or countenance of the authority
of Parliament, to such apparent violation thereof, neither can the omission of
a circumstance or some formality in the adiournment of the House, when through
force and violence it cannot meet quiet in any sort as a Parliament, be any
prejudice to the future sitting and proceeding thereof, when it may meet and
sit again as a free Parliament* it being well known that nothing can dissolve
this Parliament, but an Act of Parliament.

When a company of Apprentices, Reformadoes and others, shall call the
Ordinances of both Houses of Parliament pretended Ordinances, shall lock the
doors of the Houses upon them, shall swear not to let them out till they have
passed what they pleased concerning the Militia of London and other things
(though the House had immediately before voted otherwise) shall threaten the
Houses in case they do not instantly satisfy their demands; shall knock,
hoote, and hollow at the Parliaments doors, that the Members could not be
heard to speak or debate, and after the House of Commons had passed a Vote
concerning the Militia of London, and that the Speaker by the Vote had judged
the mayor part to be for the negative, shall not suffer the House to be
divided, but in a threatening way require those that gave their Votes against
them to come out to them if they would, when after the House was adiourned,
they shall by maine force thrust back the Speaker again into the House, and
force the Members in their presence and sight, (direct thrusting themselves
into the House) to Vote what they demanded, when they shall iustle, pull, and
hale the Speaker, all the way he went down to his Caroch, and force him (to
avoid the violence) to betake himself to the next Caroch he could get into,
for refuge: When they shall breath forth bloody threats against the Members, as
they come out of the House; and since against me in particular, at the next
sitting of the House, as J am credibly informed, and when there is no
appearance but that they will continue to do as formerly they have done, or
far worse on Friday: J could not in discharge of my trust, Protestation, and
Covenant, sit in the Chair of the House of Commons, whilst it shall be in
such a condition; but so soon as it may sit again, in freedom and safety, J
shall be ready to return to the service of the House, but till then as J have
upon the forementioned grounds fully satisfied my own conscience, so J doubt
not but J shall give the whole Kingdom (whose interest is most concerned in
it) ample satisfaction in the necessity of my action.

WJLLJAM LENTHALL. Speaker.
