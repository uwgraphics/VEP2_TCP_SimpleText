The Speech made TO Sir JOHN GREENVILE.
BY SIR HARBOT GRIMSTONE KNIGHT, Speaker to the Honorable House of Commons,
May 3. 1660.
SIR JOHN GREENVILE!
I Need not tell you with what grateful and thankful hearts the Comnoas now
Assembled in Parliament, have received His Majesty's gracious Letter, Res ipsa
L^quitur, you your self have been Auricularis and Ocularis testis de rei
veritate. Our Bells, and our Bonfires have already begun the Proclimation of
his Majesty's goodness, and of our joys. We have told the people that our
King, the glory of England is coming home again; and they have resounded it
back again in our ears, that they are ready, and their hearts are open to
receive him. Both Parliament and people have cried aloud in their prayer to the
King of Kings, Long live King Charles the 2d.

I am likewise to tell you, that the House does not think fit that you should
return to our Royal Sovereign without some Testimony of their respects to your
self; They have ordered and appointed that five hundred pound shall be
delivered unto you to buy a Jewel, as a badge of that honor which is due to a
person whom the King has honored to to be the Messenger of so gracious a
message. And I am commanded in the Name of the House to return to you their
very hearty thanks.
