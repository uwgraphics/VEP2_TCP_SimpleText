Londons Joy and Triumph. On the Installment of Sir William Pritchard LORD
MAYOR for the Ensuing Year.
To the Tune of, Tangier March.
I.
LEt the Whigs revile,
The TORIES Smile,
That their business is Completed,
Let all Rejoice
With Heart and Voice,
That the Whig's at last Defeated.
The Whigs for Loyalty so Famed,
With all their hopes are Undone;
Since now brave Pritchard is Proclaimed
The LOYAL Mayor of London.
II.
You Polish Brace
Whose Brazen Face,
To the Chair would be Aspiring,
See the Rabble Crowd
Who Poll'd so Loud;
Are bawk'd beyond Admiring;
Learn in time to mitigate
Your bold Tumultuous Fury,
E're you shall find, you trust too late,
To Ignoramus-Jury.
III.
Let P -- r Tom
Receive the Doom,
So long due for his Cheating,
Who did purloyn
The CITY Coin,
To keep up Holy Meeting;
To Rob the Orphan, and the Poor,
His great Discharge of Trust is,
And run upon the Widows Score,
To do the CITY Justice.
IV.
Let Ward Repent,
And Jenks Relent,
Their Practices so malicious,
Let Hobland rue
With all the Crew,
That they were so Officious;
Such Jews as these, who did deny
Their Savior for a Tester,
No doubt again would Crucify,
Their Sovereign Lord and Master.
V.
For NORTH and RICH,
And every such,
They set up a Papillion;
Against PRITCHARD hold,
With Cornish, Gold,
With Riot and Rebellion:
To love the KING can you pretend,
Who Royallists deny all;
And with such Vigor dare contend,
Against the Man that is Loyal.
VI.
For shame in time
Repent your Crime,
Your Riot and Commotion;
And to the MAYOR,
Who kept the Chair,
Pay all your just Devotion;
Such was their Loyalty of late,
To give the KING no Money:
But freely threw away their Plate,
To join with Rebel TONEY.
VII.
Thus you before
Did run on score
With Royal CHARLES your Master;
Like drunk or mad
Spent all you had
To uphold a bold Imposture:
Let not Knaves again betray,
And rob you of your Reason,
Then leave your Factious Heads to pay
The forfeit of your Treason.
VIII.
With all your heat
What did you get?
With all your din and quarter;
But to involve
With each Resolve
The more-entangl'd CHARTER?
To CHARLES your just Allegiance give,
Your PROPERTIES, then plead 'em:
Defending the PREROGATIVE,
You best protect your FREEDOM.
