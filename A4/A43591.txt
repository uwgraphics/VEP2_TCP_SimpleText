The Life and Death of Sir Richard Whittington, who was Three times Lord Major
of LONDON.
THe saying is not so old as true, He that refuses to buy counsel cheap,
shall buy Repentance dear, neither let any mock a man in his misery, but
rather beware by him, how to avoid the like misfortune. If thou intend to do
any good, deferr it not till the next day; for thou know not what may happen
over night to prevent thee: Behold thy self in a Looking-glass, if thou
appearest beautiful, do such things as may become thy beauty; but if thou
seem foul, or deformed, let the actions of thy life make good that splendour
which thy face lacks. Tell not thy mind to every man, make thy self
indebted to no man; be friend to few men, be courteous to all men: let thy Wit
be thy friend, thy Mind thy companion, thy Tongue thy servant: Let Virtue be
thy Life, Valor thy Love, Honor thy Fame, and Heaven thy Felicity: These
(Reader) be good decuments for thee to follow, and I am now to present thee
with a worthy President to imitate: observe his beginning, forget not the
middle passage of his life, and thou will, no question, crown his end. He
that made all things of nothing, can of a little make much, and multiply a Mite
unto a Magazin, as will easily appear by the succeed

This Richard Whitington was so obscurely bred, that he could scarcely give
account of his Parents, or kindred; and being almost starved in the Country,
necessity compelled him up to London, hoping to find more charity in the City
than Country: To beg he was ashamed, to steal he did abhor: two days he
spent in gaping upon the shops, and gazing upon the buildings; feeding his
eyes, but starving his stomach. At length mere faintness compelled him to
rest himself upon a bench before a Merchants gate, where he not long sat, but
the owner of the house having occasion of business into the Town, finding him
a poor simple fellow, and thinking that he had no more within than appeared
without, he demanded of him why he loytred there, and being able to work for
his living, did not apply himself unto some lawful calling, threatening him at
the first with the Stocks, and Whipping-post: but the poor man after the
making of some plain legs, and courtesy, desired him to pardon him, and told
him, that he was a dejected man, who desired any employment, and that no
pains, how mean or course soever, could seem tedious or burdensome unto
him, so he might but find some good Master, by whose charity he might releeve
his present necessity: for his greatest ambition was, but to keep his body
from nakedness, and his stomach from hunger; and told him withal how long it
was since he had tasted meat or drink.

The worthy Merchant seeing him of a personable body, and an ingenious aspect,
howsoever both were clouded under a rustic habit, began somewhat to
commiserate his estate, and knocking for a servant, bade him take in that
fellow, and give him such victuals as the house for the present afforded, and
at his return he would have further conference with him. The servant did as
he was commanded, and took him in.

The Merchant went to the Exchange, which was then in Lumberstreet, about his
affairs: In which interim poor Whittington was had into the Kitchen to warm
himself; for faintness, by reason of hunger and cold, (for it was then in the
winter time) had quite robbed him of his color Meat was set before him in
plenty, and being dred in the Country, as the Proverb goes, he fed like a
Farmer; and having sated himself sufficiently, and warmed him to the full, a
teeth color began to come into his cheeks: At which time the Merchants
Daughter, (hearing of a new-come guest, came into the Kitchen, and began to
question him of diverse things concerning the Country, to all which he gave
her such modest and sensible answers, that she took a greatliking unto him,
and so left him.

Dinner time came, and Master Fitzwarren (for so was the Merchant called) came
home with a good stomach, and brought a friend or two with him from the
Exchange; down they sat to meat, and had speech of many things at the Table,
mean time the servants were set also to Dinner, who would needs have whitting
on, though he had so lately broke his fast to keep them company; some of them
delighting in his Country speech, others deciding his supposed simplicity.

But to come to the purpose, the Table being withdrawn in the Parlour, and the
guests departed, and Master Fitzwarren and his Daughter left alone, she being
of a good and gentle disposition, began to commend ^is charity concerning the
poor man whom he had relieved that morning; to whom he answered, Godamercy
Daughter, thou have done wellto remember me; such an one I sent indeed but have
my servants done as I commanded them? and where is he now? who answered him,
that she had given order he should stay Dinner, and not depart the house till
he himself had further spoken wtith him. At which they both went into the
Hall, and called the Fellow before them; who appeared unto them with such a
bashful humility, that it seemed to them both to beg a charity: Some
language past betwixt them concerning him which gave them content: at length
they bid him retire himself.

When the Father and the Daughterhad some private conference concerning him,
she urged him to entertain him into his house, and that there would be some
employment for him either to run, or go of Errands, or else to do some
drudgery in the Kitchen, as in making of fires, scouring ketles, turning the
spit, and the like: To whom the Father replied, that indeed his work might be
worth his meat, but he had no lodging to spare: She again answered, there
were Garrets in the house, that were put to no use at all, and in one of them
he might be conveniently lodged, and put the house to no trouble at all.

Well, at length he was admitted, and made a member of the Family, in which he
demeaned himself so well by his willingness, to run, or go, or to do any
service, how mean soever, that he had got the goodwill of all the whole
household, only the Kitchin-maide being a cursed queen, and knowing him to be
an under-servant to her, domineered over him and used him very coursely and
roughly, of which he would never complain, though he had cause enough.

The Garret in which he lay, by reason it had been long unfrequented, was
troubled with Rats and Mice, in so much that he could not sleep in the night,
but they ran over his face, and much disturbed him in his rest: To prevent
which, having got a penny, either for going of an Errand, or for making clean
boots, or shoes, or the likes with that he bought a young Cat which he kept in
his Garret; and whatsoever he had from the reversion of the servants Table, he
would be sure to reserve part for her, because he had found by experience, that
she had rid him of the former inconveniences.

The History tells us, that his Merchant, Master Hugh Fitzwarren was so
generous, that he never adventured any Ship to Sea, but he would have his
Danghter, his Cashier, and every one of his servants, what, or whosoever, to
put in something, and to adveuture with him; and according to that proportion
which they could spare, every one received to a token at the return of the Ship.

His Daughter, she began, the rest followed, and the servants borrowed out of
their wages, every one to do according to their abilities. And when they all
had done, Whittington was remembered, and called for: and his Master telling
him the custom of his house, asked him what he ha dto hazard in this
adventure: who replied again, he was a poor man, and had nothing in the world,
saving the clothes upon his back; but for money, he had none at all: then his
Daughter drew to her purse, and told her Father, that for her servant
Whittington, the would lay down whatsoever he would desire: who answered again,
shat what she had spoke was nothing to the purposez for whatsoever was ventured
in that kind, must be out of ones proper goods and chattells: and again
demanded of him, if he had any thing which he could call his own to put to
hazard, and charged him deeply concerning that point; who making some
unnecessary legs, told him, that he had nothing which he could call his,
saving a Cat, which he had bought with his penny, which he could not spare,
because she had done him so many good offices, and told them every circumstance
before related: Which when the Merchant heard, he told him, that he should
venture that commodity, and none elsez and charged him to fetch her instantly:
for the Ship (which was called the Unicorn) was fallen down as low as
Blackwall, and all their lading was already had aboard. Whittington, although
unwilling to part from so good a connpanion, yet being forced upon his Masters
command, by whom he had his subsistence, he brought her, and (not without
tears) delivered her to his Factor, who wss partly glad of her, by reason they
were troubled with Mice and Rats in the Ship, which not only spoiled their
victuals, but dammaged their wares, and commodities.

I must leave the Cat upon her voyage at Sea, and honest Whittington a land,
who by that cursed queen, the Kitchin-maid, was so beaten and abused, that he
was as weary of his life, as of his service: for she, (usurping upon his
plainness and modesty) would be quarrelling with him upon every small, or no
occasion at all: sometimes bearing him with the Broom sometimes laying him over
the shoulders with the Ladle, the Spit, or what came next to her hands, being
of so dogged a disposition, that she still continued her cruelty toward him,
and therefore he resolved with himself to run away; and for that purpose, he
had bundell'd up those few clothes which he had, and before day broke, was got
as far as Bun-hill, and there he sat him down, to consider with himself what
course he were best to take; where, by chance (it being Alhallows day) a merry
peal from Bow-Church began to ring, and as he apprehended they were tuned to
this Ditty.

Turn again Whittington,
Lord Major of London.
Turn again Whit^ington,
Lord Major of London.
This took such a great impression in him, that finding how early it was, and
that he might yet come back to his Masters house before any of the Family
were stirring, he resolved to go back, and found every thing according to his
own wishes, and desires; insomuch, that when the household were up, none could
challenge him to have been missing. And thus he continued as before in his
first plainness and honesty, well beloved of all, save the Kitchingdrudge: I
come now now to tell you what became of his adventure.

It so happened, that this good Ship the Unicorne, was by contrary gusts and bad
weather driven upon the utmost coast of Barbary, where never any English man,
(or scarce any Christian) had ever traded before: Where they showed some of
their commodities, and offered them to be bended. The Moors came down in
multitudes, much taken with the beauty of their ship for they had never seen
any of that building, or burden before: But when they had taken a serious view
of their commodities, as Hatchets, Knives, Looking-glasses, Fish-hooke, etc.
but especially their Cloth and Kersies of several sizes and colors, they
brought them Gold in abundance; for it was more plentiful with them then
Lead, or Copper is with us.

Presently news was carried to the King, who sent some of his chief Nobility
to bring him some sorts of every commodity that was aboard: vohch when he saw,
they pleased him highly, sending for the Master, and Merchants Factor to Court:
He at their own rate bargained with them for their whole lading, nor would he
suffer them to depart, till he had feasted them royally.

Now the fashion of the Moors, is not to sit at the Table, as the custom is
amongst us, but to have a rich Carpet spread upon the ground, and when the meat
or banquet is served in, as well the King himself, as the rest, sit round
about cross legged, as Taylers commonly use to do upon their Shop-boords, and
in that manner our English were set at the Kings banquet: but the meat was no
sooner served in, but swarms of Rats and Mite seized upon the dishes, and
snatched away the meat even from the King and Qeens trenchers: At which the
Factor being amazed, asked one of the Nobiti ye (by an Interpreter) if they
preserved those verm ne for their sport, or if they were noy ome and
troublesome unto them? who answered him again, that they were the greatest
vexation unto them that could be profitable, and by reason of their multiudes
they could not be destroyed: but the King would willingly give half the revenew
of his Crown, if he could but only clear the Court of them; for not only his
Table, but his very Chamber swarmed with them, in so much, that he durst not
lay him down to rest withont a watch about him, to keep them off from his
pillow: To whom the Factor replied, that they had a strange beast aboard, which
he made no doubt, would rid them of those vermin: Which being oold the King,
he tose from his place, and imbrating the Factor, told him, if be could shem
him such a creature, he would ballest his vessel with Silver, and lade her
with Gold and Pearl. Who apprehending the occaston, made very coy of the
business, telling him, it was and creature of great value, and not common:
besides, they could not spare her from their Sip, in regard, that when they
were asleep, yet she was still waking in the night, not only to preserve their
Merchandise but their Diet from the like spoil. The more dainty that he made
of the matter, the more earnest was the King for this Beast; in so much, that
she was presently sent for.

And a second Feast being prepared, and the Rats and Mice appearing as they did
before, the young Merchant having the Cat under his cloak, the King desired to
see the thing which he had before so much commended: when presently he
discovered her, and cast her among them; she no sooner sam these vermin, but
tell upon them with such a fury, that here lay one panting, there another ^uite
dead; nor left them till she had frighted and dispersed the whole number; but
such as ^e, seized, their carkastes lay there as witnesses of their unexpected
slaughter.

Great pleasure took the King and the Nobility in the sport, vowing that the
hunting of the Lion (of which there are plenty in that Country) was not
answerable unto it, In the Interim one began to praise her for her color,
another commended her for her valor; one said she had the countenance of Lion,
and every one gave his sentence. When the poor Cat finding no more work for her
to do went round to the King and Queen, purling and curling, (as their manner
is) which they apprehended to be, as if she inquired of them what she had
deserved for that la^e service.

To cut off circumstance, no price could part them, and the rather, when the
Factor had told the King that she was with kittens, and that her brood would in
some few years, being carefully looked unto, furnish the whole Kingdom: so that
Whittingtons Cats adventure only surmounted all the Ships lading besides; with
which fortunate and unexpected gain we bring them safe into England: the Sip
lying at Anchop near Blackwall, and the Pilot and Cape-merchant, with some
other Officers in the Ship, at Master Fitzwarrens house, which was by Leaden
Hall, to give account of their voyage. But these Caskets of Jewels and Pearls,
with other unvalued Riches which were given for the Cat, they caused to be
brought along, not daring by reason of their inestimable value, to trust them
in the Sip. The Bills of lading, and the benefit of the return of the
commodities being viewed, and considered of by the owner, he^ praised God for
so prosperous a voyage and called al^ his servants, and gave order that
according to their adventures, every one should receive his portion.

At length casting his eye upon those rich Caskets and Cabinets, asked to whose
share they belonged? who whispered him in the ear, and told him, to his poor
Whitington, relating every particular as is before discoursed. To whom Master
Fitzwarren replied, If they then be his, God forbid I should keep from him the
least farthing that is his right, and presently commanded Whittington to be
sent for by the name of Mr. Whittington.

The servants not knowing any thing of the bussnesse, went unto him into the
kitchen, where he was then rubbing the spits, scouring the kettles and making
clean the dressers, and told him, he must come to his Master presently into the
Parlour: The poor man excused himself, that his shoes were durty, and the room
was rubbed, and if he should but touch any thing there, he should spoil and
deface those things in the room: But still the Master of the house called for
Master Whittington, sending one servant after another, till he was brought
before him; and having scraped some few legs, instantly his Master took him
by the hand, and called for a chair for Master Whittington: his Daughter, the
Pilot, and the Factor, every one of them saluted him by the name of Mr.
Whittington, and forced him to sit down: He wondering what this should mean,
desired them not to mock a poor simple man, who meant none any harm, etc. and
wept (the tears dropping from his eyes) desiring them not to deride his
poverty; for his ambition was never to come so high, as from the Kitchen to the
Hall, much more from the Hall into the Parlour.

Then came his Master to him seriously, and said, Indeed Mr. Whittington we are
all in good earnest, for you are at this tune a better man than my self in
estate; and then she wed him all those Cabinets and Caskets, and how richly
they were lined. When he perceived by all their earnest asseverations that all
was true, he first fell down upon his knees, and gave God most hearty thanks,
who out of his great bounty would vouchsafe to cast an eye upon so poor and
wretched a creature as himself: Then turning to his Master, he presented all
his Riches before him, and told him, that all he had was at his disposing and
service: who answered him again, that for his own part, God had lent him
sufficient of his own; neither would he take from him the value of one Barbary
Ducket. He came next, and with a low leg saluted his Mistress, and told her,
that when she pleased to make choice of an husband, he would make her the
richest Marriage in; London, because she was so willing, out of her own purse,
when he was altogether pennilesse) to lay out for his adventure. To the Pilot,
and Master, and every officer or common Sayler, he gave liberally according to
their degrees even to the ship-boy; and then to every servant of the house,
nay, to the very kitchen wenth, who was so churlish unto him, and had so often
basted him in the stead of her roast meat, haviug caused her to be called unto
him, he gave her an hundred pound toward her marriage.

This being done, Taylers were sent for, Sempsters and the like, to put him
into Clothes, and linen of the best; who were to accommodate him with all
speed possible: and his lodging in the Garret was changed into the best Chamber
of the house. And when the Barber had been with him, and the rest, to make him
complete in his habit, there was a strange and sudden Metamorphosis; for out
of a smoaky and dirty Kitchin-drudge, there appeared a proper and well
proportioned man, and a gentile Merchant: in so much, that his young Mistrisse
began to cast a more amorous eye upon him than before, which not a little
pleased Master Fitzwarren, her Father, who intended a match betwixt them.

The brute of this great adventure was presently noysed through the whole City,
in so much that his Master entreated his late servant to walk with him into the
Exchange, to see the fashion of the Merchants, which he did; where all of them
came about him, and saluted him; some bid God give him joy of his fortune,
others desired of him better and further acquaintance, and every one as his
several fancy led him: Some commended him for his person, others for his
modest answers, and discreet carriage: Indeed, Wealth is able to make all these
good where they are most wanting, which was not in him, as appears by the
sequel.

Within few weeks the match was propounded betwixt Master Whittington and
Mistrisse Alice, and willingly entertained on both parties, and not without
great cost; with the invitation of the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, very nobly
celebrated, and the Bridegroom by this means had got acquaintance with the
best.

After this, the Father in law de manded of his Son what course he purposed to
take? (his freedom being offered him, and accepted of) who made answer again,
that suice God had so blessed him in his small adventure, he would not leave it
off so, but prove his goodness in a greater, and that his purpose was to turn
Merchant: which reply gave him no small content, in regard he knew the best
amongst them would be glad to have the society of so hopeful a Citizen: which
he continued, adventuring in diverse bottoms with his Father, and had very happy
and prosperous, returns,

The time when he was pricked for Sheriff, which he modestly refused, as unable
to undertake so great a charge, and would willingly have paid his Fine, which
his Father in law would not suffer: at whose persuasion he took the place upon
him, in which he so welll behaved himself in the management of all affairs
belonging to his Office, that he not only left it without the least taxation,
but with a general love and approvation, in so much that the universal eye of
the whole City was fixed on him, in an hopeful expectation what a profitable
member of that united body he might futurely prove. And this happened in the
year of our Lord 1393. Sir John Hardley Grocer being Mayor, and Drewry
Barentine his fellow Sherffe; of the truth of which, Master Fabian in his
Chronicle, and Master John Stow in his Survey of London can fully sarisfie you.

An the year 1397, and the one and twentieth of the same Kings reign, Sir
Richard Whittington was Lord Mayor of London, John Woodcock and William Askam
being Sheriffs; and he held the place with great reputation and honor. In
which time of his Majoralty there was much discontent in the Kingdom, by reason
of many differences betwixt the King and the Commons; the circumstances whereof
were here too long to relate; only one thing is worthy of observation, that
whether by his adventures, or no, may it be questioned, bringing in yearly such
store of Gold, Sikes, Sattens, Velvets, Damasks, Stones, and Jewels, etc. into
the Kingdom, might be the cause of that great pride and rioting in apparel
which was used in those days? But as Harding Fabian, and others have left to
memory, in that year of his Majorality, and after, there resorted to the Kings
Court at their pleasures daily, at the least ten thousand persons: In his
Kitchen were three hundred servitors, and in every office according to that
rate. Moreover, of Ladies Chambers and Lawndresse above three hundred, and they
all exceeded in gorgeous and costly apparel far above their degrees: for
even the Yeomen and Grooms were clothed in Silks and Velvets, Damasks and the
like; with Imbroydery, rich Furrs, and Goldsmiths work, devising every day
strange and new fashions.

And in this year also, about the Feast of St. Bartholmew, grew a great discord
betwixt the Duke of Hereford, and Mowbrey Duke of Norfolk, the beginning
thereof being as follows. The two Dukes riding from the Parliament toward
their lodgings, the Duke of Norfolk said to the other, Sir, you see how
variable the King is in his words, and (reflecting upon what had past) how
without mercy he puts his Lords and Kinsfolks to death, imprisoning some,
and exiling others: There it hehooveth us not too much to trust to his fair and
smooth language, for doubtless in time he will bring even to us the like death
and destruction. Of which words he accused him to the King, which the other
denying, it was to be tried by combat: the Lists were appointed, and the day
of meeting, the eleventh day of September; to which place, and on the day
assigned came hoth the Dukes, and bravely accoutred, appeared before the King,
ready to enter into battle; where the King threw down his Warder, and staying
the combat, banished the Duke of Hereford for ten years, but the Duke of
Norfolk for ever; who traveling many Countries, at the last came to Venice,
and there ended his life.

Again, in the year 14^6. and in the eighth of Henry the fourth, Sir Richard
Whittington was the second time Lord Mayor, Nicholas Worton and Geffrey Brook
being Sheriffs. Again, in the year 1409. being the seven^h year of Henry 5. he
supplied the Pretorship, Robert Whittington (his near Kinsman) John Butler
being Sheriffs: and which is more remarkable of him than of any other, that
either precded him in that place of Honor, he was once Sheriff, and three
times Lord Mayor of this famous and honorable City in three several Kngs
reigns.

Now, to cut off all circumstances, and come close to the matter, we may easily
find what this man was, by the pious and religious acts done in his life to the
Cities present grace, use, and benefit, and to his own blessed memory for ever.

In the Vintry Ward he built a Church, and dedicated it to Saint Michael,
calling it Pater noster in the Royal, and added to it a College, founded to
Saint Mary; and placed herein a Prestdent and four Fellows which ought to he
Masters of Arts; besides other yearly allowance to Clerks and young Shollers:
near which he everted an Hospital, which he called Gods House, for thirteen
poor men; and these, according to the devout superstition of those days, were
to pray for the souls of his Father in law Hugh Fitzwarren, and Dame Molde his
wife, for whom he erected a fair Tomb in the Church he before built, leaving
also a place for himself, and Dame Alice his Lady, when it should please God to
call them: In which place they were afterward both of them, according to their
degree very honorably interred, great mourning and much lamentation being made
for him by the commons of the City, in regard he was a man so remarkable for
his charity.

He builded another brave structur^ which he called after his own name
Whittington College, with a perpetual allowance for Divinity Lectures to be
made there for ever; leaving good land for the maintenance thereof.

And on the west side of the City he built that famous gate and prison, to this
day called Newgate, and thereupon caused the Merchants arms to be graven in
stone. He added to St. Bartholmews Hospital in Smithfield, and was at the
charge of repairing thereof.

Further, at the Gray-Fryars in London he erected a Library, as a testimony of
the great love he had to learning, which he began in the year of our Lord 1421.
and finished it in the year following. Moreover, that place which is called the
Stocks to this day, betwixt Cheapside and Cornhill, a gooly house of stone,
which serves for a flesh-market, and a fi^h-market, greatly beneficial to the
City.

Besides, he enlarged Guildhall, and glazed most, or all of the windows at his
own cost and charges, paving the Hall, and contributing largely to the Library,
adding to the se Basses Conduit, which yields store of sweet and wholesome
water, to the general good and benefi of the City.

In the year 1397. when Sir Richard Whittington was first elected Lord Mayor,
that Rebel Sir John Oldcastle was taken, in the Territories of the Lord
Powesse, not without danger and hurt of some that took him: At which time all
the States of the Realm were assembled in Parliament at London, therein to
provide the King of a Subsidy, and other aid of money and munition, who took
great pains beyond the Seas, in France: these Lords and others, when they heard
that the public enemy was taken, they agreed all not to dissolve the
Parliament, until he were examined, and heard to answer in the same: whereupon
the Lord Powesse was sent for, to fetch him up with power and great aid, who
brought him to London in a Litter, wounded very much, having received seventeen
wounds; and also a Clerk which he called his Secretary, with him, tha it was of
of his counsel in all his secrets. As soon as the aforesain Sir John Oldcastle
was brought into the Parliament before the Earl of Bedford, who then was left
Regent, and governor of the Realm in the time of the Kings absence, being in
France, and other Lords and States: His Indictment was read before him, of his
forcible insurrection against the King and State in Saint Gyles Fields, and
other treasons and outrages by him committed, the question was asked, how he
would excuse himself, and show why he should not be judged to dye according to
the Law: But he seeking other talk, began to talk and discourse of the mercies
of God, and that all mortal men, that would be followers of God, ought to
prefer mercy above Judgment, and that vengeance pertained only to the Lord,
and ought not to be practiced by them that worship, but to be left to God
alone: with many other words to detract the time, until the Lord chief Justice
admonished the Regent, not to suffer him to spend the time so vainly, in
molesting of the Nobles of the Realm: whereupon the Duke of Bedford, Regent,
commanded him to answer formally and punctually to the matter laid to his
charge.

The said Sr. John being thus urged, at last after deliberation taken, he
said, it is the le ast thing that I account of, to he judged by you, as of man's
judgment; and again, he began to talk, but nothing to the purpose, until the
chief Justice commanded him again to answer finally and to answer them if he
could, why he should not suffer death according to his desert: To which he
stoutly answered, that he had no Judge amongst them, so long as his Liege, Lord
King Richard was alive, and in his Realm of Scotland; which answer when he had
made, because there needed no further witness, he he was there presently
censured to be drawn, and hanged upon a Gallows, and there to be burnt hanging
upon the same: Which Judgment was executed upon him the thirteenth day of
December in Saint Gyles fields, where many honorable persons were present; and
the last words that he spoke, was to Sir Thomas Eupingham, adjuring him, that
if he saw him rise from death to life again the third day, he would procure
that his Sect which he had raised, might be in peace and quiet. He was hanged
by the neck in a chain of Iron, and after consumed by fire.

Moreover it is recorded, that in time of this worthy Praetor Sir Richard
Whittington, the glorious City of Constantinople was taken by Mahomet, the
second Prince of the Turks, whose Soldiers sacked it with all extremity, and
omitted no manner of cruelty or violence either to virgins, aged women, nor
sucking babes. This Sir Richard Whittington had traffic from thence by his
Factors which there abode, and were then taken prisoners; so that he lost near
upon fifteen thousand pounds: which when he heard of, never was so much as cast
down, or dismayed, but said, God will send more: yea, such was the incessant
practice of the Turkish tyranny upon this imperial City, as it exceeded the
damage, rapes, and spoils of other Cities. They also beheaded at the same time
Constantine the Christian Emperor thereof, and put his head upon the top of a
Lance, and with derision caused it to be carried through the Turkish Camp.

In the space of a week after, there happened a horrible tempest of Thunder and
Lightning, which burned almost eight hundred houses, and spoiled three thousand
people at the sacking of the aforesaid City by the said Mahomet. The Turks
found therein so much treasure, that they wondered that the Citizens would not
spend it upon soldiers for their owe defense, but so dotingly to spare the
true spending thereof, to become an enticing prey for their unreconcileable
enemies: for indeed it was thought, that if the State would have hired
soldiers, and given them good pay, they might have raised the siege of the
Turks. It is an old and a true saying, Covetousness is the mother of ruin
and mischief.

This strange thing happened in the second time that he was elected Lord Mayor,
and that was upon the twenty seventh of April, being Tuesday in Easter-week:
William Foxley, Pot-maker for the Mint in the Tower of London, fell asleep, and
so continued sleeping and snoring, and could not be wakened with oricking,
cramping, or otherwise burning whatsoever, till the first day of the Term,
which was full 14. days, and 15. nights: The cause of this his sleeping could
not be known, though the same were diligently searched for by the Kings command
of his Physicians, and other learned men; yea, the King himself examined the
said William Foxley, who was in all points found at his waking, to be as if he
had slept but one night, and yet lived 41 years after: But in length of time he
did call to mind, how he did wish to God that he might sleep a Fortnight
together, if it was not so and so; concerning a bargain between a neighbor of
his and himself

On thursday in Whisun week following, the Duke of Somerset, with Anthony
Rivers, and four other, kept Justs and Tournaments before the King and Queen,
and other of the Nobility in the Tower of London, against three Esquires of the
Queens Bedchamber, which were performed before some of the French Nobility,
that then were prisoners to the King, which he took in France; to the great
admiration of those strangers who never saw the like action before, being so
earnestly performed. There was also Sir Richard Whittington, and the two
Sheriffs, and that night the King and Queen did suppe with the Lord Mayor.

Those strangers which beheld the Justs, were prisoners in the Tower at that
time; namely, the Duke of Orleance and Burbon, brother to the Duke of Britain;
the Earls of Vandosme, of Ewe, and Richmond, and the High Marshall of France,
and many other Knights and Esquires. to the number of seven hundred; all all
which were at one time prisoners to the King, but nobly used and attended,
every one according to their rank and quality: who, when they were ransomed,
made it known to their King, how honorably they were attended in England, and
what re^pect the King and our English Nation showed them being prisoners, who
might have taken their lives away, as well as their persons prisoners.

The second thing that was remarkable in Sir Richard Whittingtons year, was
that the King kept his Christmas at Lambeth; and at the feast of Purification,
seven Dolphins of the Sea came up to the River of Thames, and played there up
and down, while four of them were killed.

On Saturday, the Eve of Saint Michael the Arch-angell the year following, in
the morning before day, betwixt the hour of one and two of the clock, began a
terrible Earthquake, with Lightning and Thunder, which continued the space of
six hours, and that universally through the whole World; so that menhad thought
the world as then should have ended. The unreasonable beasts roared, and drew
to the Tow n with ahideous noise: also the Fowls of the Air cried out; such
was the work of God at that time, to call his people to repentance.

The four and twentieth day of January following, a battle, or combat was
fought in Smithfield within the lists, before the King, between two men of
Feversham in Kent, John Upton Notary, Appellant; and John Down, Gentleman,
Defendant: John Upton accused John Down, that he and his Compiers should
imagine the Kings death on the day of his Coronation following. When they had
fought some what long, and had received each of them some wounds, and still
persisting in their violent action, and no hopes to find out the truth, the
King took up the matter, and forgave both parties.

On Candlemas Eve following, in diverse places of England was great weathering
of wind, hail, snow rain, with thunder and lightning, whereby the Church of
Baldock in Hertfordshire, and the Church and part of the Town of Walden in
Essex, with other neigbouring Villages, were sore shaken; and the Steeple of
Saint Paul's in London, about two of the clock, in the afternoon, was set on
fire in the midst of the shaft, first on the West side, and then on the South;
and diverse people espying the fire, came to quench it in the steeple, which
they did with Vinegar, so far as they could find; so that when the Lord Mayor
with much people came to Paul's to have helped if need had been, returned again
every man to his own home, trusting to God all had been well: But anon after,
between eight and nine of the clock, the fire burst out again atresh out of the
steeple by reason of the wind, more hot and fervent than before, and did much
hurt to the Lead and Timber thereof. Then the Lord Mayor and many people came
thither again: and with vinegar quenched the fire which was so violent, so that
no man received any hurt.

Moreover, in Sir Richard Whittingtons time lived one Richard Fleming, Bishop
of Lincoln in the year 1430, Who founded Lincoln College in Oxford, which was
afterward in Richard the thirds time, in the year of our Lord 1479. by Tho.
Rotheram Bishop of the same Sea, much augmented and enlarged, with great
revenews. Likewise Magdalen College in Oxford was built; and also a great part
of Eaton College in Oxford was built, and also a great part of Eaton College
by William Wainfleet, Bishop of Winchester, who was a loving and a constant
friend to Sir Richard Whittington, and did much good in many parts of this
Kingdom; and the said Sir Richard did largely contribute to these and the like
pious uses by the entreaty of this Bishop.

In the year of our Lord 1419. in which Sir Richard Whittington was the third
time inaugurated into the Majorality, as is before mentioned, King Henry the
fifth, who having conquered the greatest part of France, and espoused Katherine
sole Daughter to ehe King, and Heir to the Crown, taking leave of his Father in
law, embarked with his royal Bride, and landed at Dover upon Candlemas day,
leaving in France for his Deputy his brother, the Duke of Clarence: from thence
arrived at London the fourteenth day of February, and the Queen came thither
the one and twentieth day of the same month, being met upon Black Heath by the
Lord Mayor, and three hundred Alvermen, and prime Citizens, in Gold chains, and
rich and costly habits, with other sumptuous and brave devices, as Pageanes,
Speeches, and shows, to the great delight and content of both their Majesty's.

The four and twentieth day of February following, being Saint Matthews day,
her Coronation was solemnized in Saint Peter's Church in Westminster: which
being ended, she was ateerwards royally conveyed in the great Hall, and there
under a rich Canopy of State sat to Dinner: upon whose right hand sat at the
end of the same Table, the Lord Archbishops Grace of of Canterbury, and Henry
called the rich Cardinal, Bishop of Winchester: upon the left hand of the
Queen sat the King of Scots, in a chair of estate, and was served with covered
Dishes as the Bishops were. But after them, and upon the same side next to the
boords end were seated the Duchess of York, and Countess of Huntington: the
Earl of March holding a Scepter in his hand, kneeled upon the right side, the
Earl Marshal in the like manner kneeled upon the left hand of the Queen: The
Countess of Kent sat under the Table at the right foot, and the Countess
Marshall at the left foot of her Majesty.

Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, was that day Dverseer, and stood before the Queen
baresheaded: Sir Richard Newell was Carver, and the Earls brother of Suffolk
Cup Bearer; Sir John Steward Sewer the Lord Clifford (instead of the Earl of
Warwick) Pantler, the Lord Wllowby (instead of the Earl of Arundell) chief
Butler, the Lord Gray Kater, Naperer, the Lord Audley (in the stead of the
Earl of Cambridge) Almner: the Earl of Worcester was Lord High Marshall, who
rode about the Hall on a great Courser with many tip-stave about him, to make
room in the Hall. In the which Hall next after the Queen, the Barons of the
Cinqueports began the Table; upon the right hand toward Saint Stevens
Chapel; and beneath them at the tables are the Vouchers of the Chancery, and
upon the left hand next to the Cupboord sat Sir Richard Whittington (now the
third time Lord Mayor) and his brethren, the Aldermen of London. The rest of
the Bishops began the table over against the Barons of the Cinqueports, and the
Ladies and chief noble women the table against the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen:
At which two tables of the Bishops, the Bishop of London, and the Bishop of
Durham sat highest at the one, and the Countess of Stafford, and the
Countess of March on the other. And for ordering of the service, diverse chief
Lords were appointed Officers; as Steward, Controwler, Surveyer, and the like;
which places were supplied by the Earls of Northumberland, Westmerland, the
Lord Fizhue, the Lord Furnevall, the Lord Gray of Wilton, the Lord Feres of
Groby, the Lord Poynings, the Lord Harington, the Lord Darcy, the Lord Daker,
the Lord Delaware, etc.

I have showed you only the ordering of this rich Feast, but the cost and
sumptuousness of the fare, would ask too large and long a circumstance to
discourse: what I have hitherto done, was only to show to the World, that at
those high Solemnities, Inaugurations and Coronations, the Lord Mayor of the
City of London, and the Aldermen have place, and their presence is still
required: the City being the Kings Chamber, and in an Interregnum he the first
and prime Officer in the Kingdom. But I fear I have dwelt too long upon the
premises, which I hope, none will hold for an unnecessary deviation: I come now
to deliver unto you of Sir Richard Whittingtons invitation of the King and
Queen into the City, where he bounteoussy feasted them in his own house, and at
his own proper charge.

How great and magnificent the Londoners feasts be even amongst themselves,
especially at that high and pompuous festival at Guild Hall the day after
Simon and Jude, at the solemn Inaugutation of his Lordship, who but knows; as
also the ordinary Tables of the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs, where there is
free and generous entertainment for all men of fashion, and quality; the like
both for plenty of dishes, and order of service it is not else where to be
seen, or found through Europe. If then their daily provision be so curious and
costly, what may we think their variety and rarity was at the invitation and
entertainment of two such great Majesty's? I must therefore leave it to the
Readers imagination, being so far transcending my expression: Let it therefore
give satisfaction to any one that shall doubt thereof, that it was performed to
the everlasting reputation of the Inviter, the honor of the City, and great
content of these Royal Personages invited: The bounty of his Table not to be
questioned, I come to the fire that he made in the Presence Chamber, where the
King and Queen then Dined, which was only of sweet and odoriterous Wood, far
exceeding the smell of Juniper; for it was mixed with Mace, Cinnamon, and other
rare and costly svices, which did cast such a pleasant and delightful labor
through the room, that it pleased his Majesty to call him unto him, and say, my
good Lord Mayor, though your fare be both choice, costly, and abundant, yet
above all things I have observed in your noble entertainment, this Fire, which
you have provided for me, gives me most content: To whom Sir Richard
Whittington making a low obeisance, made answer, it much rejoices me Dread
Sovereign, that any thing which remains in my power, can give your Highness
the least cause to be pleased: but since you praise this fiire already made, I
purpose ere yonr sacred Majesty depart the house, to entertain you with one (I
hope) that shall content you much better: the King not thing it could be
possible, desired him to make a proof thereof: when he (having before provided
himself for the purpose) brought a great bundle of Bonds, Indentures, and
Covenants under his arm, said said thus to the King; Royal Sovereign, to whom
I owe both my fortunes, and my life, I have here a faggot of purpose left for
this Fire, which I hope, will smell much more sweetly than the rest in your
nostrills; for says he, here is first your Highness security for ten
thousand Marks, lent you for the maintenance of your Royal Wars in France,
by the Right Worshipful Company of the Mercers, which I here cancel, and cast
into the Fire: Fifteen hundred lent by the City to your Majesty, I send after
the former; two thousand Marks borrowed of the Grocers Company, three thousand
of the Merchant taylers, one thousand of the Drapers, one thousand of the
Skinners, one thousand of the Skinners, one thousand of the Ironmongers, five
thousand of the Merchant-Staplers; of the Goldsmiths three thousand, of the
Haberdashers as much; of the Vintners, Brewers, and Brownbakers three thousand
Marks: All these you see are cancelled, and burnt says he; with diverse other
Bonds sor money lent by my: father in law, Alderman Fitzwarren, for the payment
of your Soldiers in France, which coming unto me by Exetutorship, I have taken
in, and diseharged.

Others there are likewise due to me of no small sums; by diverse of your
Nobility here present, all which with the former I have sacrificed, to the love
and honor of my Dread Sovereign, amounting to the sum of threescore thousand
pounds sterling, and can your Majesty (says he) desire to sit by a fire of a
more sweet sent and sovour? At this the King was much extasi'd, and the rather,
because it came so unexpectedly, and from so free a spirit, and embracing him
in his Arms, said unto him, That he thonght never King had such a subject: and
at his departure, did him all the grace and honor that could descend from a
King to a Subject, promising him moreover, that he should ever stand in the
first rank of those whom he favored. And so the Lord Mayor bearing the sword
before their two most sacred Majesty's as far as Temple Bar, the King for his
former service, and his most kind and loving entertainment at that time, and
the Noble men, for that extraordinary courtesy offered them, all unitedly and
unanimously commended his goodness, applauded his bounty, and wished that he
might live to perpetual memory, and so bid both him and the City for that time
adteu.

To omit all other circumstances, having acquainted you with the poor and mean
estate of this Sir Richard Whittington when he came first into the City of
London, and by what me^ns he was relieved in his miserable poverty; as also the
fortunate successa of his small advenventure, whereby he was, raised unto so
great honor, that he became the Cities Governor, and how discreetly and
wisely he behaved himself in his Authority and Office, gaining thereby the love
and approbation of all men: And further, having plainly she wed you what goodly
buildings have been raised by his great cost and charge, as one Church, two
Colleges: and certain Almshouses, with yearly means left for the maintenance
of all such as shall be admitted into them; and many other charitable acts
performed by him, which are before related, to the great good and benefit of
the City; and what things of note happened in his time, I will now conclude with
Master Stow, O that London had a park near adjoining uuto it, stored with such
Dear, (as doubtless it has, though not easily known) for some build
Almshouses, Freeschools, Cawlies, and Bridges in needful and necessary plates;
others repair ruioated and decayed Churches, relieving Hospitalls in a
bountiful manner, and are weekly Benefactors to Prisons, and those performed
by such agent faithfully that the true bestowers are not publicly noted,
howsoever they may be easily suspected: But the glory they seek to evade here,
will (no doubt) for ever shine on them elsewhere And that great God who has
created us, and plentifully distributed al his great bounty all things to men,
and yet not given all things to any one man, lest it might take away that
necessary commerse, and mutual consoci^ty which ought to be amongst (...)
(...) up the minds of more of them, to imitate at least, though not to exceed
them in their bounty and liberality.

FINIS.
