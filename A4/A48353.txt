The use of the TABLE Exemplified, in the Resolving of several QUESTIONS.
Quest. I. What is a Lease, Annuity, Rent or Pension of 30 l. a Year, and to
continue 13 years, worth in ready money, at 6 per cent.

YOu must first find 13. (the number of years to be purchased) in the first
Column of the Years, toward the Left Hand (under the word Tabl;) Then look
along that Line (toward the Right Hand) till you come under the Figure 30 at
the Head of the Table (which is the Annuity per Annum to be purchased) and
right against 13, and under 30, you shall find 265 l. 11 s. 3 d. And so much is
an Annuity, Lease, Rent or Pension of 30 l. a year, and to continue 13 years,
worth in present Money, the Purchaser having 6 per Cent. Compound Interest,
Profit for his Money laying out.

Quest. II. What Money will Purchase an Annuity, etc. of 5 l. a Year, and to
continue 21 Years, at 6 per Cent. Compound Interest?

LOok for 21 years in the first Column toward your Left Hand, and in the same
Line toward the Right Hand, under 5, in the Head of the Table, you shall find
58 l. 16 s. 4 d. And so much Money will purchase a Lease or Annuity of 5 l. a
year for 21 years, and 6 in the Hundred Interest upon Interest being allowed.

Quest. III. What is a Lease, Annuity, Rent or Pension of 43 l. a Year, and to
continue 30 Tears, worth in ready Money?

FOrasmuch as the Number 43 cannot be found in the Head of the Table, you must
therefore resolve the Question at two Operations, in this manner:

1. Find 30 in the First Column, and along that Line under 40, you shall find
-- 550 l. 11 s. -- 8 d.

2. Find 30 in the First Column, and against it under 3 in the Head of the
Table, you shall find 45 l. -- 01 s. -- 10 d Which added to the former, makes
595 l. 13 s. 6 d. And so much is a Lease, etc. of 43 l. a year, and to continue
30 years, worth in present Money.

And thus you shall find that an Annuity, Rent or Pension of Lib.
^8 17 22 37 45 58
Pounds a Year, and to continue Yea.
23 17 25 8 11 27
Will be worth in present Mo. l. s. d. 14^ 14 04 178 02 02 281 04 08 272 01 09
354 17 10 766 04 01

Quest. IV. What is a Lease or Annuity, etc. of 146 l. a year, and to continue
50 years, with in present Money?

BY the Rules above delivered, you may find, by the Table, that l. s. d. 100 l.
for 50 years is worth 1572 10 00 40 l. for 50 years is worth 0629 00 00 05 l.
for 50 years is worth 0078 12 06 03 l. for 50 years is worth 0047 03 06 148 l.
for 50 years is worth therefore -- 2327 06 00

Quest. V. Two Persons M. and S. have either of them a Lease, which, for
convenience, they would exchange, -- M. his Lease brings him in clear 30 l. a
Year, and is in being 21 years; S. his Lease brings in clear 40 l. a year, and
he has 16 years to come: Which Lease is woth most?

BY the Table you may find that M. his Lease of 30 l. a year for 21 years, will
be worth but 352 l. -- 18 s. -- 1 d. And by the Table also you may find that S.
his Lease of 40 l. a year for 16 years will be worth -- 404 l. -- 04 s. -- 02 d
The difference is -- 051 l. -- 06 s. -- 01 d. And so much is the Lease of S.
better than the Lease of M.

Quest. VI. A person having 300 l. lying by him, with which he would willingly
purchase an Annuity of 20 l. a year; for how many years will that Money
purchase such an Annuity?

YOu must look for 20 (the Annual Annuity) at the Head of the Table, and look
down that Column till you find the Sum 300 l. (or the nearest to it) and the
number of years (in the first Column) which stand against that Sum, is the
number of years that Sum of Money will purchase 20 l. a year for.

Thus if you find 20 in the Head of the Table, and look down that Column, you
cannot find just 300 l. but the nearest to it is 300 l. -- 12 s. -- 4 d.
Against which, in the first Column, there stands 40. So that if he add 12 s. --
4 d. more to this 300 l. It will purchase him an Annuity of 20 l. a year for 40
years.

Quest. VII. A Landlord having a Lease of a House which brings him in 127 l. a
Year clear; He having a present occasion for a Sum of Money, desires so much of
his Tenant as will countervail 7 years Rent, and he will allow him after the
Rate of 6 per Cent. Compound Interest for his Money: How much Money may he lend?

BY the Table and the Directions before given, you may find that a Lease of 100
l. a year for 7 years is worth -- l. s. d. 556 02 02 20 l. a year for 7 years
is worth 111 12 10 5 l. a year for 7 years is worth 027 18 03 2 l. a year for 7
years is worth 011 03 03 127 l. a year for 7 years is worth 706 16 06 And so
much may the Tenant lend, and have 6. per Cent. Compound Interest.

Quest. VIII. If a Lease of 30 l. a year, and a 100 l. Fine, is to be let for
21 years, what Fine must be given to bring the Rent down to 10 l. a year?

FIrst, find the Difference between the Rent demanded ( Viz. 30 l.) and the
Rent desired ( Viz. 10 l.) which difference is 20 l. -- Secondly, Find by the
Table what 20 l. a year is worth for 21 years, which you shall find to be 235
l. 5 s. 5 d. to which add 100 l. (the Fine demanded) and the Sum will be 335 l.
-- 5 s. -- 5 d. And such Fine must be paid to bring the Rent down to 10 l. a
year.

Quest. IX. One has a Lease of a House for 30 years, for the first 10 years he
is to pay 15 l. a year, and for the remaining 20 years, he is to pay 20 l. a
year: What is this Lease worth in ready Money?

BY the Table you may find that 20 l. a year for 30 years is worth 275 l. -- 5
s. -- 10 d. Now (because 5 l. a year is to be abated for the first 10 years)
find what 5 l. a year is worth for 10 years, which you will find to be 36 l. 15
s. -- 11 d. which being subtracted from 275 l. -- 5 s. -- 10 d. the remainder
will be 233 l. -- 9 s. -- 11 d. for the present worth of the Lease.

Quest. X. Demand is made for a Lease of a House for 21 years, 10 l. a year,
and 335 l. -- 5 s. -- 5 d. Fine, the Tenant is willing to give 100 l. Fine, and
an increase of Rent proportionably to the Abatement of the Fine: What Rent must
Annually be paid?

THe Fine Demanded is 335 l. -- 5 s. -- 5 d. and the Fine offered is 100 l. The
Difference is 235 l. -- 5 s. -- 5 d. Look in the Table for 21 years (the Term
of the Lease) in the first Column toward the Left Hand, then cast your Eye
along that Line till you come to find 235 l. -- 5 s. -- 5 d. (or the nearest
Sum to it) which you shall find to stand under 20 l. in the Head of the Table:
Which shows, that he must advance 20 l. a year in his Rent, to bring down the
Fine demanded ( Viz. 335 l. 5 s. -- 5 d.) to a 100 l. And so for his Lease of
21 years, he must pay 30 l. a year and a 100 l. Fine.

THe Use of this TABLE is very plain and easy; as by Examples following shall
be made appear.

Quest. I. What is a Lease of 20 years of Freehold Land worth in ready Money,
at 5 per C

LOok in the Head of the Table among the Great Figures for 20 (the Number of
years to be purchased, and underneath 20, you shall find 12 l. -- 1 s. -- 2 d.
that is 12 years, 1 quarter and 2 Months Rent, so that if the Rent were 10 l.
a year, the Lease would be worth 10 times 12 l. that is 120 l. and the Quarter
of the year will be 2 l-10 s.-and the 2 Months will be worth 1 l. 13 s. 4 d.
all which being added together will make 124 l. 3 s. 4 d. for the worth of the
Lease for 20 years at 5 l. in the Hundred.

But if the Purchaser will have 6 l. profit for his Money, then the Purchase
will be worth but 11 years 1 quart. and 2 Months. Or if he would make 8 in the
100 profit for his Money, then it will be worth but 9 years, 3 quarters and 2
Months purchase.

And farther, If he will have 10 l. in the Hundred profit for his Money laying
out, it will be worth but 8 years, a half and 1 1/^; Months Rent: And so for
any other Number of years.

Quest. II. What is an Annuity of 25 l. a year to continue 31 years, worth in
ready Money at 5, 6, 8, and 10 l. in the Hundred.

Years Quart. Months. A Lease for 31 years, at 5 Per Cent. is worth 15 3 1
Purchase. 6 13 3 2 8 11 1 1 10 09 3 0

And thus, the Rent being 25 l. a year, l. l. s. d. q. At 5 Per Cent. the
Purchase will be worth 394 04 08 00 6 346 05 00 00 8 282 09 02 03 10 243 15 00
00

And these Two Examples are sufficient for the Use of this TABLE.
