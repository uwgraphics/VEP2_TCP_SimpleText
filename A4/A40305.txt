To you that are crying, What is become of our Forefathers, if the Light be
the way which you be in, and what is become of the Martyrs that suffered?
ANswer, Many of the Jews suffered death by the Heathen, because they could
not transgress the Commands and Law of God, and suffered because they could
not eat Swines flesh. And the Prophets of God, again, Many of them suffered by
the Jews, who witnessed Christ was to come, there was one slain between the
Temple and the Altar, by the Jews, which had the words, but not the life: Now
many of the Jews which had the words, caused others to suffer which had the
life; but the Prophets they suffered for the life, and the Apostles they
suffered for the denying of the Jewish Commandments, and their Ordinances, and
said whatsoever they sold in the shambles, that they might eat; and the Jews
formerly, they had suffered for holding up these things, before the substance
was come, by them that was out of the Law of God; for the Prophets suffered for
many of these outward things, by them who had not the life, who saw and
declared the substance; and these was for signs, and for wonders unto both the
houses of Israel: And while the Jews many of them suffered, there was
something stirring in them that carried them in to the obedience to the
commands of God; and when the Jews went only into the words from the life,
they persecuted the Prophets, and killed the just one, and persecuted the
Apostles, who witnessed the just one.

Now these Jews may say, What is become of our Forefathers, that suffered
death for obeying the commands of God? These that persecuted the Prophets, and
put the Son to death, and persecuted the Apostles, these might complain, and
say, What is become of all our Forefathers? For that which was in their
Forefathers, the life of the Law, which brought them to know the Law, and keep
the Commandment, those lived, and that suffering was accepted: But those that
was from the life, though they held the outward Commandment, Statutes, and
Ordinances, they persecuted the life, Christ Jesus, the Prophets, and Apostles;
and here is no talk of their Forefathers, or of them that suffered, for here
is a distinction between them; For Abraham, David, and Moses, saw the end of
the pattern, which they that had got their words, which might plead what was
become of their Fathers, or them that had suffered of the Heathen; and those
that were transgressors was another state from them, which saw through, and
saw the end, so they stood not against the substance nor the life, but they did
that bad the words and wanted the life; these was with the life, of the
Prophets judged, and the Apostles, as People having eyes and see not, and ears
and hears not.

Now say you that calls your selves Christians, but be out of the life of
Christ and the Apostles, What is become of our fore Fathers, and what is become
of the Martyrs that suffered? Alas for y^u! you are not to be compared to
them; that have gotten the Martyrs words, and Christ's and his Apostles words:
As the Jews was not that suffered death, to be compared to them that
Persecuted to death; So you differ from the Martyrs that suffered death, as
those that caused death; neither are you to be numbered with them that suffered
for the righteous Law of God, with those Jews which Persecuted Christ to
death, and the Apostles, and the Prophets. So here, now you be in a wrong
measure, which is too short in comparing your selves, and making your selves of
that number that suffered: but the true Measure makes you of that number that
Persecuted, and then see what become of all them, how should they escape Hells
damnation, for the least degree, that is pure, that brings to suffer is
accepted, but that which gets the words, and causes to suffer, is for
judgment; so you having gotten the Apostles and Christ's words and commands.

Now the Apostles suffered, and some of them that lived in the life, the
Believers after them, as the Reco^d of the Scripture does make manifest: but
that being come which the Apostle spoke of, the substance; you that have the
outward command, and letter, and not the life, but are standing up prating of
the words, you are Persecuting them, and rising up against them that witness
the substance, the end of the Apostles words: so you are not to be measured
with them that suffered, the Apostles, and Martyrs, that are now Persecuting
them that are believers, so it is now, as it was then, in this age, as it was
in that age; for formerly there had some suffered for bearing Testimony to Gods
Commandment, ordinances, and statutes, and the shadows. And when the substance
was come among the Jews that had the shadows, and outward commands, and the
type, them that had this Persecuted the substance, would not have the substance
to rule: Measurable with you that be called Christians which now stands against
the substance it self, who has the outward form and command, but will not
have Christ in the Spirit to reign, as they would not have him in the flesh to
reign, neither would they have him in the flesh to reign, as they would not:
But the substance is come, whereby the End of all things is seen, and Heaven
shaken, and Earth shaken; and a new Heaven, a new Earth is witnessed, wherein
dwells righteousness.
