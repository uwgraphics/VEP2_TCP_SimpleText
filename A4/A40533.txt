LONDON, Printed for Robert Hayhurst at the Axe in (...) Britain. 1691.

An Impartial Account of the Late Famous Siege, and most Noble Defense of MONS,
etc.
MONS, as it has been the Miracle of the Age, and Wonder of its Enemies (for
unparalled Courage and Resolution) ought now to be the Work of each Ingenious
Writer, and Discourse of every Martial Man. Fame has already spoke sufficient
in the praise of that undaunted City, whose Actions I now mean to particularize.

But before I enter upon the particulars of the Siege, I shall give the Reader
an Account of the Province of Hanault, and situation of Mons. Hanault is so
named of the River Hayne, which runs through it. It is the chief of the Walloon
Provinces, it bordereth on the North with Brabant and Flanders, belonging to
the King of Spain, on the South with Champain and Piccardy, two Provinces
belonging to the French, on the East with the Province of Namur, and on the
West with the Sheld, and part of Flanders Gallican. It is twenty Leagues long,
and sixteen broad; the Air is wholesome, and the Soil good, by reason that the
Country is watered with many Rivers, as the Scheld, the Sambre, the Tender, and
many other small Rivulets: There are also in it many Lakes, Marshes, Ponds,
Pools, Fountains, goodly Woods and pleasant Forests. It abounds with fragrant
and fair Pastures and Meadows for all kind of Cattle, with good Fruits and
profitable Trees, and is replenished with great plenty of good Corn. In some
part of it are Iron-Mines, Lead, and Quarries of Stone, for all kind of
Buildings, with great Store of White-lime and Coal.

In this Country are Twenty Four Walled Towns; namely, Mons, Valenciennes,
Bouchain, Quesnoy, Conat, Landressy, Amesnes, Chimay, Mariemburg, Segny, Brain
le Compte, Eughien, Halle, Lesme, Cheure, Ath, St. Guisline, and Leaze. There
are also 950 Villages, with many Castles and Signiories. Many of the Villages
are great and fair, and have Titles of Honor annexed to them; as, Pequicourt,
Fontayn, Laling, Montigny, Antonig, Barlamon, Barbauson, Aimeries, and many
others.

The City of MONS, or Berghen, receives its Name from its Situation, which
latter, in their Language, signifies a Mountain or Hill; but the rise of the
Earth there is so gentle, as it cannot be said to be Mountainous.

The City is strong, as well by natural Situation, as the mutual Industry of
Fortifications. It is cut through on the lower side by a little Rivulet called
Trulla, which as soon as it goes out of it, falls into another somewhat bigger,
called Hayne, which crossing through the Province, before it be gotten quite
out, falls into the Scheld; and on this side is a Moras, the Earth here being
very Spungy: It Is Fortified likewise round about with strong and excellent
Walls Turrets, and Gates; to which are joined many Regular Works, according to
the Modern way, as Hornworks, Half-Moons, Counterscarps, Bastions, Redoubts,
etc. there are likewise three large deep Ditches or Moats, with a strong Castle
or Citadel, very good Ramparts, and a River running by the Fortifications.

The Buildings of the City, both private and public, were very fair and
beautiful; here is the noble Nunnery of St. Valdrude; their Churches are Built
after the Ancient manner of Architecture, with sumptuous Arches, and goodly
Pillars of Marble and Porphyry; the Stadt Heuse or Town Hall is of excellent
Workmanship. This City was surprised by the French Hugonets in the Year 1572.
who got in great quantities of Arms in Fatts, under pretense of Merchandise;
and having seized on the Gates, they let in the Army of Count Lodowick of
Nassau, Brother to a William Prince of Orange, but it was soon after retaken
for the King of Spain, by the Duke of Alva. The Prince de Bergh, who was the
late Governor, has his Title from the Place, and most, or all his Estate lies
in the Province, he is related to the House of Nassau.

The First Letter.
THe French King having had a longing desire to bring this City to his
Subjection, resolved, by an early Campaign, on the attempting of it this
Spring, pursuant to which Resolutions, he caused to be laid up this last Winter
in Valenciennes, Cambray, and other Frontier Places, vast and almost Incredible
quantities of Hay, Oats, and other Forage for a numerous Army of Horse: And
having given Orders to his Generals to draw his Troops from their several
Quarters, as well on the side of the Rhine, as in Flanders, sending the very
Troops of his Household, Grand Musketeers, Gens d' Arms, and Light Horse, etc.
On the 14 of March, New-Stile, the French Army, Commanded by the Duke of
Luxenburgh, and the Marquis de Boufflers, etc. directed their March toward
Mons. On the 15th, their Cavalry, consisting of 42 Squadrons, began to Invest
it in a formal manner. The 16th and 17th was spent chiefly in the Marching up
of the Foot, and the Regular placing them in their several Posts. On the 18th
the Marquis de Boufflers sent a Summons to the Prince de Bergue, to Surrender
the Town on Honorable Conditions, telling him, The King, the Dauphine, and all
the flower of France would be there to oblige him to it: But the Prince
rejected his Proposals, telling him, That he was glad to hear that so great a
King would be there in Person, to be witness of the Gallant and Brave Defense
he was resolved to make; at the same time, as well Burghers as Regular Troops,
with an unanimous Voice and undaunted Resolutions, resolved to defend it to the
utmost of their Lives and Fortunes; which Answers, not suiting with the French
desire, nor the hopes they had of an early Surrender, made them prepare for
Action. This Evening the Garrison made a Sally on the Enemy, with 1800 young
Men of the Town on Foot, and Four Squadrons of Horse and Dragoons, Commanded by
Colonel Harcourt; and in this Action they cut off 500 of the French. The 19th
the French began to work on their Line of Circumvallation, having forced in
near 20000 Boors or Country People that Inhabit in the Neighborhood of Mons,
employing them as well in working on their Lines, as diging drains for the
Marshes, which rendered the Town inaccessible on the side toward France; and
for the more effectual draining of the Moras, the^ brought along with them new
Invente^ Machines, likewise great Planks so^ their Cannon: They worked very
har^ in their Trenches, the 19th, 20th, an^ 21st. On the other side, the
Garr^son was not Idle: On the 20th, the Inhabitants made a great Fire to
destro^ the Blinds of the Enemy: And on Sunday the 21st, they made a great
Sall^ in order to demolish a Fortified Mi^ near the Counterscarp; in which
Act^on 200 French were Killed and Drowned. On the 22d, the French Kin^ came
into the Camp in Person, being accompanied with the Dauphin, the Duke de
Charles, the Prince of Cond^ etc. and as the French gave out, Tha^ the King
brought with him Seven Mi^lions in Gold, to distribute among suc^ as should
signalize their Valor in the Siege: It was thought that the Trenches would
have been opened thi^ day, but not being ready, the Frenc^ King made very
little stay in the Camp but returned to St. Guislain, where h^ has his
Quarters; and the Dauphin to his Quarters at Maubeuge. The Frenc^ King thinking
himself so sure of reducing the Place immediately, that while he was in the
Camp, he gave the Government of it to the Sieur de Ruben^ton, a Colonel of his
Guards.

The Second Letter.
THe Garrison of Mons was Composed of 6 Regiments of Dutch, of Germans, 2 of
Walloons, one of ^paniards, and 800 Spanish Horse, ^^aking in all about 6500
Men; and ^he Burghers that bore Arms in the ^own were about the same Number,
^ost of them Disciplined and well ex^erienced Men; the Garrison, to pre^ent
their being incommoded by the ^nemies Bombs, immediately applied themselves to
uncover their Houses, and unpave their Street; the Regular Garrison had
generally the Command ^f the Outworks, and the Burghers, that of the Ramparts,
and in the ^own the Magazines; it being their ^wn voluntary desire, and there
was ^^ways a great Harmony and good ^nderstanding between the Burghers and the
Regular Troops; there was a ^reasonable practice discovered in the ^own to have
blown up the great Ma^azine of Powder, which was very ^ear taking effect, the
lighted Match ^eing found within few Inches of the ^rain, several of the
Conspirators were ^ized, (proving to be French Spies;) ^ut the Principal who
was an Advo^ate, and out of whose Garden the ^ine was made, made his Escape to
the French Army. On the 24th. Colonel Branaccio, and several other considerable
Officers got into the Town; At the same time the Prince de Beigne, the
Governor, sent a Gentleman to the Marquis de Castanaga Governor of Flanders,
to Inform him of the State and Condition of the Town. On the 25th. Monsieur
Lovis sent a Bravado Message to the Magistrates and Burghers of Mons, that in
consideration the King had been there in Person, for every day they held out,
they should pay One hundred Crowns.

On the other Hand, A Gentleman got into the Town, with a Message from the
Governor of Flanders, wherein he acquainted the Magistrates and Burghers, that
they should be freed from Taxes for twenty Years if they defended the Place
till Relief came; At a Council of War in the French Camp, at which were the
Famous Monsieur Vaubon, and four other Engineers, they assured the King that he
should take the Place in 10 Days, from the time of his Troops first appearing
before it; Public Prayers were made at Paris, and in all the French Conquests
for the Success of the French Army at this Siege.

The Third Letter.
ON the 26th. about Eleven a Clock at Noon, the French opened their Trenches
with three Batteries, with which they began to play on the Town; their Lines of
Circumvallation were of a vast Circuit, extending at least four Leagues, their
Trenches were eight Foot deep, and twenty two Foot broad. In the Afternoon of
the same Day, the French began to play on the Town, from three Batteries, one
near the Gate of Barlemont, the other betwixt the Gates of Havery and Nimy;
they continued for three Days, successively, to Fire very furiously, and threw
into the Place great Numbers of Bombs, many of which were of 500 l. weight;
they continued to Batter the Place with 150 pieces of Cannon, most of which
were 48 pounders. The French King, at his Arrival in the Camp on the 22th. took
a Review of his Army, which was then increased to 48000 Foot, and 20000 Horse,
without Reckoning the Army under the Marshal de Humeirs, which lay 4 Leagues
from Mons, and consisted of 20000 Men, being designed to observe the
Confederates on the Coast of Lisle, and, if occasion were, to join the French
Army. The French Bombs on the first and second days after the opening the
Trenches, set several Houses on Fire in the Town; but by the indefatigable
Industry of the Burghers they were soon Quenched; one (...) their first
Batteries, by reason of the looseness of the Earth, sunk in, tha^ their Balls
could hardly reach the Wal^ of the City; they kept playing from Morning till
Night, and by Night s^ forward their Approaches. The Enem^ on the 27th. made
several Attacks o^ the Outworks, but particularly on (...) Windmill Hill, and
a Redoubt^ which stands near the Suburbs, on the River; but were as often, with
gre^ Bravery, Repulsed by the Garriso^ with the loss of 800 Men, amon^ which
were several considerable Of^cers: But, with their fourth Attack (...) the
Evening, they made themselv^ Masters of it. But the next Morni^^ the Besieged
retook it, who not bei^ able to keep it, blew up the Mill, a^ retired into the
Town: In these for Assaults the French lost 2000 Men.

On Thursday the 29th, early in t^ Morning, the Enemy made a gre^ and Vigorous
Attack upon an Ha^ Moon, which was the Outwork the covered the Hornwork that is
next t^ Gate of Barlemont, (on which (...) chiefly they Attackt the Town,)
(...) were received by the Besieged, wi^^ great Resolution and Bravery; and
^ter a very sharp Dispute, the Fre^ were beaten back with a great Slaug^ter;
and soon after the Besieged made three very successful Sallies; In which, and
in the Attack the French just before made on the Horn-work, they killed above
1200 Men, with little loss on the side of the Besieged; The French were
likewise observed to carry away above 60 Wagon-Loads of their Wounded Men, to
the Camp.

The Fourth Letter.
ON the 30th, the French Troops were observed to be in a continual Motion from
one side of their Camp to the other, which plainly discovered their uneasiness,
for fear Relief should come to the Town; the next day they ordered a Camp to be
Marked out, for ^0000 Chosen Men, Commanded by ^he Dauphin; at the same time
they ordered great Numbers of the Boars to ^e employed in Cutting down
Timber Trees, to be assistant to them, in baricading up the covered Road that
^ads to Brussells. April the first, the ^nemies Cannon having widened the
^reach in the Half Moon, of the Horn^ork that is next to the Gate of Bar^mont,
they gave order for the Storm^g of it a third time, which they did ^ith 7000
chosen Men, a great part (...) which were Switzers; and after a ^arp Dispute,
wherein they had kil^d a great many Men, they carried ^e Fort; the French had
killed and ^ounded in these three several Assaults, ^s the Deserters give
account) above ^00 Men, among which were many ^fficers of Note; the first
Attack ^ey made was with 4000, the second with 6000, and this last with 7000.
By Deserters, that lately Arrived in the Town, we understood that the French
Army were increased to a vast Body, there being the chief Force and Flower of
France, as likewise most of the English Gentlemen and Officers, who were
Retainers on the late King James; that the French were judged to be in the
whole, that is, in the Trenches before the Place, in their Camp, and upon the
Lines in Flanders, about 85 Battalions, and 200 Squadrons; that is, about One
hundred thousand Men, of which there was already killed, Sick and Wounded about
twelve thousand: That the Marquis de Boufler's Headquarters were at the Abbey
of St. Dennis; and those of the Marshal de Luxenburg, the same he had in the
year 1678, when the Prince of Orange obliged him to quit the Bloccus of Mons:
That the great Officers of the French-Army, were mightily surpised at the
Vigorous Defense made by the Besieged; for that when they first set down before
it, they expected to have carried the Place in few days: That besides Bouflers
and Luxenburg, there was in the Camp the Marshal de Duras, and la Fevillade,
who Commanded as Generals; and under them Commanded the Prince de Soubize, the
Marquis de Foyeuse, the Sieur du Rubantel, the Duke de Vendesme, and the Sieur
Rose, as Lieutenant-Generals; and the Marquis de Villars, the Marquis de
Congis, the Duke de Bourbon, the Prince de Conti, the Duke de Maine, the Grand
Prior of France, and the Count de Mont Chevrevil, as Marshals de Camp.

The Fifth Letter.
HIS Britanick Majesty, having received an Account at Loo, by an Express from
the Marquis de Castanaga, That on the 15th past, the City of Mons was Invested
by the French Cavalry, prepared for his speedy Return to the Hague; and in the
mean time gave Orders for the drawing together, with all possible diligence,
the Troops of Holland, Brandenburgh, Liege, etc. and that they should March
directly to the Neighborhood of Brussels. On the 21st, in the Evening, the
King Arrived at the Hague: Prince Waldeck waited on His Majesty that Night; and
having received His Orders, (...) the next day to Brussels. On the 26th, the
King left the Hague, taking his Journey to Flanders, by the way of Breda: The
Duke of Zell followed His Majesty on the 27th, accompanied with the Baron de
Chauvet, of the Lunenburg Forces. His Majesty, before His departure from the
Hague, declared the Count de Solms General of the Foot; the Earl of Portland,
Monsieur Overkirk, Monsieur Opdam, and Monsieur Zulestine, Monsieur Holsoppel,
Count Tilly, and Monsieur Ittersum, Major Generals of the Horse; and Count
Walraet of Nassau, Monsieur Zobel, Monsieur du Tell, and Count Noyelles, Major
Generals of Foot. On the 26th, in the Evening, the King Arrived at Breda, where
he was received with all possible demonstrations of Joy and Respect: His
Majesty continued there till Sunday-Morning; at which time He set forward for
Vilvoord, in his way to Hall, in order to put himself at the Head of the
Confederate-Army, that was Rendezvouzing there; which Place is about six
English Miles from Brussels, in the Road to Mons. On Saturday the first of
April, the King set forward for Vilvoord, and Arrived there late that Night. On
Monday His Majesty viewed, and on Tuesday Mustered His Army, and Encamped in
the Neighborhood of Brussels. On Wednesday the Army Marched to Hall, where
they expected the coming up of the Troops that had not joined them, as well as
part of the Artillery. On Thursday the 6th, about Three in the Afternoon, at
which time, all the Troops and Artillery were not come up; but the King viewed
then 30000 Foot, and 15000 Horse: The Train of Artillery is composed of 71
Pieces of Cannon, and 14 Mortars. This Evening the Scotch Regiments of
Infantry, and the Spanish Cavalry, Arrived in our Camp, to the Number of about
7000 Men. Great numbers of Switzers daily Desert, and come into our Camp from
the French Army; they give an Account of the hard Treatment they have received
in this Siege, from the French King; That they were always forced on the most
desperate Attacks, and yet refused the Exercise of their Religion: They
likewise tell us, that a most Malignant Flux raged much in the French Camp,
great number of Wagons, with Sick and Wounded Men, going daily from the
French-Gamp to the adjacent Towns; and likewise, That the French had lost many
of their best Officers and Engineers in the Siege.

The Sixth Letter.
BY Deserters that lately come into the Town, from the French-Camp, we received
an Account, That the Sieur Megrim, a Famous Engineer, having been Wounded in
both his Arms, the French King had given Orders for his immediate carrying to
Tournay, and given directions for some of his own Chyrurgeons to take care of
him: That the King had forbid all the great Officers of the Army to quit their
Posts; not being without his Fears, that he should be Attacked by the King of
Great Britain: He likewise Commanded the Duke de Chartres, not to go into the
Trenches without his Order: That on the 18th some of our Deserters came into
the French-Camp; who assured them, That we had abundance of all things in the
City; and that every day some entered the Town, by the Marshes; and that we were
daily in expectation of Succors: on which they ordered the Marshes to be more
narrowly Guarded; and that they would make their utmost Efforts, for the more
speedy carrying the Place: that the Duke de Maine, and the Grand Prior of
France, were killed in the Trenches; and that the Marquis de Boufflers, and the
Duke de Vendos^, were dangerously Wounded: That it the several Attacks they
made on the Half Moon of the Horn-Work, they had lost above 6000 Men. We cannot
sufficiently express the Courage o^ the Besieged; the Parents could scarce keep
their Children, the Wives their Husbands, and those of the most Wealthy of the
Inhabitants, from running into the greatest dangers, through Fire and Power.
And as the Garrison consisted of diverse Nations, they strove with a kind of
Emulation, every one to signalize himself for the Honor of his Country.

Last Saturday Night, the Enemy made a great Assault upon that part of the
Counterscarp, that lies between the Horn-work, and the Two Half-Moons, but were
beat back with very great loss; having besides 2000 private Sentinels and
Subalterian Officers, Fifteen Captains Killed, out of Twenty that Commanded the
Party.

The Seventh Letter.
WE doubt not but the News of the Surrender of Mons will be very Surprising to
you, considering the Vigorous and Obstinate Defense they for some time made,
and the many and great Successes they had gained on the Enemy, particularly in
the Attack they made on the Seventh at Night, upon the Counterscarp that covers
the Hotn-work of Barlemont-Gate.

Mons Capitulated on the Eighth instant, notwithstanding the Garrison was not
in the least Distress, wanting neither Ammunition nor Provisions; the main Body
of the Soldiers were likewise strong and hearty, having not lost, during the
whole Siege, above 500 Men of their Number, and some Sick and Wounded, and had
baffled and grievously Slaughtered the Enemy in all their Assaults, in as much
that the French Officers were forced to drive on their Men, with their Swords
in their hands, to the Attacks; and the Switzers, (who were never used to turn
Tail) being Commanded to renew an Attack, where the Garrison had Foiled them
before, refused the same, and many of them Deserted into the Town and
elsewhere: Upon all which bad Successes, as diverse Deserters report, the
French King, despairing of his Conquest, designed in a day or two to Raise the
Siege, and March off with his Army; besides, his numerous Body of Horse had
spent all his Magazines of Forage, etc. But during this Success of the
Garrison, and Despair of the Enemy, the French King's Plot took effect in the
Town, for the Priests raised a Mutiny among the Burghers, by this Argument,
viz. That they being good Catholics, ought not to Defend a Town that was to be
put into the Hands of Heretics; upon which the Burghers, accompanied with
their Wives, etc. got together, and were headed by Two Prelates (who, without
doubt, are to be made French Cardinals, or at least, to have Fat Bishoprics
given them in France) who Marched before the Mob to the Governor; who,
understanding their Errand, refused to see them, but Commanded them immediately
to be gone: Upon which the Burghers went forthwith upon the Walls, and beat a
Parley; the Garrison Fired upon them, and Killed Four or Five: But the Disorder
increasing, and the whole Body of the Burghers being Alarmed, and more
numerous than the Garrisons, the Governor was constrained to Capitulate; which
was too surprising to the French, that the King himself could not believe it,
until he had entered the Trenches, to see the Flag of Truce, which was hung out
on Sunday the Eighth instant; and a Cessation of Arms being agreed on, and
Hostages exchanged on both sides, the Articles of Capitulation were Signed
about Two in the Afternoon.

The Articles were such as the Governor desired: The Chief of which was as
follows.

The Articles of Capitulation, for the Surrender of MONS, April the Eighth,
1691.
I.
THE Garrison, both Horse and Foot, with the Persons thereunto belonging,
consisting of what Nation soever, shall, according to the Military Custom,
March out with Colors Flying, Drums beating, completely Armed, with Bullets in
their Mouths, and lighted Matches, Bag and Baggage; and shall be Conducted to
the Camp near Hall.

II.
That for the convenience of carrying away their Baggage, and what else they
please, they shall be allowed Thirty covered Wagons, Fifty Persons to March
out on Horseback in Masks, Six Pieces of Cannon, and Two Mortars.

III.
The Sick and Wounded, that think fit, may remain there till they are well, and
be accommodated according to their Condition.

IV.
Every one may Bury his Dead where he pleases.

V.
Those that fled into the Town from the Neighboring Villages (as well
Gentlemen as Peasants) may return to their Habitations, and freely enjoy the
same.

VI.
That the Garrison shall be Conducted by a Convoy of Sixty Squadrons of French
Horse, to the Camp near Hall.

VII.
That the Garrison shall be allowed Forty Eight Hours to prepare for their
March.

VIII.
Immediately after the concluding the Accord, the Gate of Barlemont, with the
two Half-Moons and Counterscarp shall be delivered up to the French King.

IX.
This Accord shall be inviolably observed, and Execute^ in all its points.

On Tuesday the 10th, the Garrison Marched out 4500 Strong: As they passed by,
the Dauphin took a Review of them, and observed, that the Walloons and
Spaniards were very ill Mounted and Equipt; but the Troops of Holland and
Brandenburgh were otherwise. The Governor, who was Magnificently Vested and
Mounted, made Three Salutes to Monsignieur, with his Sword in his hand, and
declared his Trouble that the Burghers had obliged him to Surrender; saying,
That he had much rather have trusted to the Courage of the Officers, and
Soldiers of the Garrison. Brigadi^ Fagel, that Commanded the Dut^ Troops,
refused to Sign the Capitulation, and declared his Grief to the Dauphin at
their Dishonorable Surrender. Monsieur Vauban, the Famous Engineer, first
entered the Town and gave the necessary Orders. Twelv^ Thousand Men are ordered
for to Ga^rison the Town; and Monsieur Ve^tillack, a Swiss Colonel, is made
Governor. The Inhabitants are Commanded to provide 12000 good Beds for the
Garrison, though they before would scarce allow Straw for 2000 of the Dutch; they
have likewise demanded of the Burghers 200000 Florens, toward the repair of
the Fortifications of the Place; and the French King is resolved to Build a
Citadel, on purpose to bridle the Inhabitants, having already Disarmed the
Chief of ^he Burghers; they have likewise begun to exact Contributions in the
se^eral Towns and Villages, in the Neighborhood of Mons.

The Prince de Berge, the Gover^or, at his Arrival in the Camp, assured ^he
King, That he would have main^ained the Town Eight or Ten days ^onger in spite
of all the Power of France; and that the Garrison wanted ^o manner of
Necessaries for its De^ence.

The King had drawn together an Army of 50000 Men, and designed, on that day
the Place was Surrendered, to have advanced so near the French Army, as either
to have immediately put in Relief into the Place, or else to have given Battle
the next Morning, though the Enemy had broken up all the Roads, and Fortified the
Avenues that led to their Camp. The French, after they had Garrisoned the Town,
sep^rated their Army; the one Part made a show as if they designed (...) Invest
Charleroy, but Marched off; a^ the French King went for Versailes.

His Majesty, King William, on T^day, took a Review of His Army; ^mediately
after which, they went (...) to Quarters, the Foot in the Front^ Towns, and the
Horse in the Neighboring Villages.

On the 16th the King returned (...) the Hague, in his way for England.

FINIS.
