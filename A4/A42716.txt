A SALUTATION OF THE Fathers Love, UNTO The young Men and Virgins, who are in
the Openings of the Prophesies in Visions and in Revelations. And to the
Laborers in his Vineyard; who sound forth his praises in the Congregation of
the Righteous.

Through his suffering Servant William Gibson.

Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart: Wisdom
has lift up her voice, and understanding cries aloud.

The knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, as the waters cover the Seas.

The time is at hand.

To the READER
DEar Friend, Child of the glorious day, whose heart is turned unto the God of
Light and Life, in whom there is no darkness at all, who is come out of the
Region where death over shadowed thee, who is come to know the vail taken away,
by the resurrection of Christ from the dead; unto thee, I say, are these
following lines directed, as a Salutation of the Fathers love unto thee:
Therefore dear Friend, I say unto thee, sink down low to feel the Wonderful
Counselor in thee, the key of David, which opens, and gives thee to
understand deep sentences; for from the moving of the Fathers love is this
given forth in pure fear; so, in the measure of the same love do thou read it,
in pure fear, in the uprightness of thy heart, and what opens unto thee as thou
read in the true fear, that receive, and treasure it up in thy heart; and if
there be something which does not open unto thee as theu read, be contented
honestly to pass by it, and let is alone, and suffer not thy mind to start
aside from the measure of God into the subtlety, to comprehend that, which does
not open unto thee, for from that part it is hid, and unto that part there is
nothing spoken but judgment; and the things that are recorded, are true
sayings, as I have received them from the Father, yea, that which I have seen,
and heard, and felt, declare I unto thee, that thou may receive a benefit
thereby: So, the Lord direct thy understanding in all things.

A SALUTATION Of the Fathers Love.
UPon the seaventeenth day of the tenth Month, as I lay upon my Bed, I was
swallowed up in the great Deep, where glorious things I there beheld; and when
I was thus swallowed up, and lay in great fear and trembling, These ensuing
words did arise fresh in me, in the Life of Jesus, in supplication unto the
Father.

Wisdom does flow, God keep me low,
In it to grow, My place therein to know,
That my guide I may not overgo.
And O ye children of the day,
Unto you all I say,
Your minds upon God stay, and ever pray,
That he may keep us in the narrow way,
That so in peace lay down our heads we may,
Even so, Amen, I say.
Peace be with you.
W. G.

To the young Men and Virgins, upon whom the Spirit is powered, and is pouring
forth, who are in the openings of the Prophesies in Visions and in Revelations;
unto you is my words directed, in the word of Life, in fear and trembling;
therefore listen attentively, and give ear.
FRiends all, keep low, down, and close to that, which opens unto you the
mysteries or Gods Kingdom, for that which opens is his own power; therefore, I
say, keep ye all low down unto it in much reverence and fear, and I say, take
great heed, that you suffer not your minds to start aside from that which opens
unto you, into that which it opens; for if you do let forth your minds to
comprehend it in the sensual or earthly wisdom, that is exceeding dangerous,
for then that which opened unto you will shut suddenly again from you, and you
will be left groaping in the dark; and that which is already opened, which the
earthly and sensual part in you has catched up, that same which has stolen
it, that will speak it forth again boastingly, without the true fear of God,
for that is not the true wisdom, but the false; therefore beware of it, for
that is the subtle Will or Serpent, which led the First man to run before his
guide, and by following of it he became a transgressor, and this subtle Will or
Serpent has passed over all, and it lies very near to catch up that which is
opened, and here, by the subtlety, the simplicity has been betrayed in many,
that after they have felt the true power of God, and by it their understandings
have been truly opened, they went from the power that opened unto them, and the
subtlety catched up that which was opened, and the same spoke it forth again
boastingly; and so, such who have been thus betrayed, many of them have lost
all that good thing, and have sat down in darkness and blindness, even in a
worse estate than they were in at the first; but now my Friends, the power
which opens unto you, is that which will keep this untuly Beast in subjection,
yea and seal him in the pit, and keep him there, but if so you witness it, you
must dwell in pure dread, and fear, continually: So then, this I say, all keep
in the feeling of the Lambs power, who is meek and lowly, who says, Learn of
me, and herein you will be kept humble and low, and you will feel Christ Jesus
to rule and reign over that subtle Serpentine and beastly will in you, for I
tell you plainly that, that is it which first did the evil, and that must
either be kept under the yoke continually, which is the power of God, or else
man cannot be kept out of the transgression: So then, I say, keep to the power
which opens unto you, and look not out into that which is opened, for this, I
say unto you, if you keep to the power which opens that which runs through
your understandings, once in the power, it will stand and remain open unto you
in the same power, while you have a Being, if in that which opened it you
abide; so in the power abide, and that which is opened unto you treasure it up
in pure fear, and let it lie a hidden treasure in you, and when the power that
opened it moves in you to speak forth any part of the mysteries revealed unto
you, then you may freely do it, but in much fear and reverence, least that
crooked Serpent or beastly will lead you beyond what the true power moved you
unto; for I say, you must take great care continually, that you keep that
forward part, the subtle Will in subjection, for if in a little measure that do
but get way, it speedily brings all out of order; so, I say unto you all (a^
moved of the Lord God) as you prize the glory of God, and the everlasting
welfare of your souls, wait in fear and trembling to keep that part in
subjection, so shall you grow and prosper in the eternal and everlasting truth
of God, and stand, and abide, and be blessed for evermore.

W. G.

And now, O ye young men and Virgins, whose mouths the Lord of Life has
opened, and is opening, to declare his wonderful works, and what he has done
for your souls; yea I say, unto you is my speech directed, who are moved of the
Lord to declare, and to sound forth prayers and praises unto him, in the
Assemblies and congregations of the righteous: Therefore in the true fear
listen and give ear.
FRiends all, When you go to meet with your Brethren and Sisters, to wait upon
the great and mighty God, who searches all hearts, and before whom all things
are naked and bare: Then I say, sink down low to feel his pure powerful
presence to arise in you, and to come up and stand over all that is contrary
unto it in you, and then what you receive in the power, to utter forth, that is
in the word of the Lord God, which is Pure, and that will answer the pure in
all, and in your declaring of that, which is given you in the true power, your
souls will be greatly Refreshed: But Friends, In Gods pure fear and dread, I
Warn you all, Take great heed that you suffer not your will to get at liberty,
but when you feel the true power rising in you, and words come in, look not out
into the Words, but keep to the power, and wair, still, and low, and let the
power work through and over the contrary, forward and subtle Will, which would
lead you to look at the Words, and to catch up the words into your Memory, and
to turn from the power, and so that subtle part which catches at words as they
open, that would speak them forth, but that is to be judged down, and kept
silent, and the mind kept close to the power that works, and the power will
work over that which would run before, and the words which opens in the power
will arise more and more clear in you, if you do not look at them, but at the
power that moves, and when you feel the power of God to stand over your own
wills, and feels it to burn in your hearts, even as a fire, so that you feel
you are in the dominion over the contrary Part, then, I say, stand up boldly,
in the fear and dread of God, and let the power open your mouths, and keep
close unto it, and let that go freely forth which the power moves unto, and
when your mouths are opened, and your fouls greatly refreshed, then take heed
that your souls be not over much Lifted up in Joy and Zeal, for that is very
dangerous to lead you cut of your measure, but keep down to the power, and
still utter in the true fear, and when you are emptied of the words which was
given in, in the power, then, even then take heed, that you suffer not your
minds to start from the power, into the subtle part to fetch in words, for
verily, there is great danger in that very thing; therefore beware of it, for
if that get way, it will bring a burden, both in the particular, and in the
general, and so the power comes to be abused, and he that thus utters he
loses his dominion by abusing the power, and he sits down in sorrow: But
this I say in the fear and dread of the Lord God, unto thee whosoever thou art,
when thou feel that thou art emptied of those words, which was given unto
thee clear in the power, then sit down, and keep thy mind close unto the power,
and wait in the coolness, still and low, and feel that thou have such dominion
over thy own will, that thou can be as freely willing to be silent as to
utter, feel it even so, for if it be not so, it is not Right, and so if thou
sit down in the true fear of the Lord before thou have overspent thy self, then
the power may open again and again in a meeting, and as the power opens and
truly moves, thou art to be obedient, and here thou go along with thy Guide,
and in so doing thou do please the Lord, and wilt grow daily in his wisdom
and power, and he will prosper his work in thy hand, and in his truth he will
make thee stand, and abide even to the end and this I say unto thee in Gods
pure fear, keep low and humble continually, and all things which thy Lord
makes thee an Instrument for good in, purely give him the glory of his own
work, and take thou great heed, that thou give not way in the least unto that
in thee which would lead thee to have high thoughts of thy self, for that is an
evil appearance; therefore as thou prizest thy life do thou slay from that, for
if thou should give way to that, it would lead thee to take glory to thy
self, which is not due unto thee, and so thou would rob God, and he that
robs God shall not prosper, God will blast him in his fury, and he shall die
and come to naught, the mouth of the lord has spoken it; therefore, O man,
fear and dread, and stand in awe, continually, for God is zealous of his own
Glory, and he will not give it unto another; he does forbid that thou should
glory in any thing, but only in his powerful presence, And that is it, which
will keep down that which will rob him, and it will keep thee humble and ^^eek
and lowly continually; and thou being duly humble, thou art truly honorable,
for mile man abides in the power of God, he is truly honorable, and that of
God in the hearts of all that fear God, honors him: But that which leads
into conceits of self, and seeks honor to it self, That, is gone from the
power of God, in which the true honor stands, and unto which it is due; and
the more that man seeks it, the further he is from it, for the Curse is unto
that Part; God brings the lofty from his Seat, and exalts them of low
degree.

And now Friends, The Serpent being move subtle than any Beast of the Field,
which the Lord God created, he moved without the power of his Creator, and so
in rebellion against the power that created him, and so he became evil, and so
accursed, by the power against which he has rebelled, and so he stands in
continual enmity against the power that created him. Now my Friends, This
wicked one, which is at continual enmity against the workings of the Spirit of
God in Man, he has diverse opperations and influences upon the souls or spirits
of men, that inward or invisible creature, which moves about the outward or
visible creature Man: And my Friends the Spirit and power of God, is that which
was before the wicked One was, and shall be when he shall be no more. All
things was good in the beginning, and there was no evil, and therefore no
Curse. And now friends all, sink down and keep low, to that which was in the
beginning, the power of God, and that will give you to know your own spirits,
what spirits you are of, for men do differ in their spirits, or that inward
Creature, which moves about the outward Creature.

Now Friends, Some are of a forward, bold and valiant spirit, and others are of
a more backward and fearful: Now I say, The power of God will show unto every
one that believes, and abides in it, what spirit they are of: Now thou that
wast bold and forward before thou came to know the Lord, thou art now bold
and forward, and full of zeal for the Truth; and there lies thy weakness, for
the subtilty to lead thee before thy Guide, the power of God which created thy
Spirit, and in which thy spirit is to move, and not before it: So keep down to
the power, that thy spirit may be subject unto the power, and move in the
power, and so the power brings man into the state in which he was created in
the beginning. So fare thee well, keep to thy Guide, for in thy obedience
consists thy eternal welfare.

And now thou that wast of a backward, slow, or fearful spirit, before thou
knew the lord, thou art now fearful, backward, and slow, and when the Spirit of
God moves upon thy spirit, to speak forth what he requires of thee, then here
lies thy weakness, for the subtilty to enter; if thou look (...), the subtilty
will tell thee, that thou art (...) to speak, and it will bring strange Rea^
unto thee; if thou hearken unto it, it will tell thee, that there is thy elder
Brethren, who are to speak, but thou art not, and if thou do, they will judge
thee. Many other things it will present unto thee, which would be too tedious
to mention; It may bring bad and wicked things before thee, to render thee
unfit and unworthy to speak; and all this his labor with thee, is to cause
thee to disobey thy God, and to strangle the motion of his Spirit in thee; and
thus he will do with the boldest of men, if they look out that way; but he more
frequently works upon this hand with thee that is of a fearful and slow
spirit: But this I say both to the bold and fearful, Look not out, hearken not
to this subtle One, which on his belly creeps, striving which of us he may
devour, but keep ye down low to feel the Lambs power, and to its moving be
obedient, yea, follow him whithersoever he leads you, and in the Lambs power
you will grow in the Dominion of the Lamb, over the subtle Serpent, and
devouring Wolf, and his Kingdom and Dominion shall come to an end, for it had
a beginning. So fare you well, ye Beloved of the Lord, unto whom my soul is
united, in the everlasting Light of the Day, that is sprung from on high, and
has visited us; Oh the blessing of God be with your spirits, even so says my
spirit in the power that created it.

To the Laborers in the Lords Vineyard, am I drawn forth in the power of the
Love of the Lord of the Vineyard. Unto you Brethren and Sisters, a humble
Salutation, in much fear and trembling, in the lowly life of the Lamb, which
always moves contrary unto the corrupt will of man.
FRiends all, keep low in the feeling of the Arm and Power of the Lord of the
Vineyard, for that is it which works the Lords work; so whatever thy
employment be in the Vineyard, still wait low to feel the power of the Lord to
lead thee on, so will the blessing of the Lord accompany thee continually, and
he will bless thy labors, and prosper his work in thy hands, and thy reward
will be sure unto thee. And now my Brethren and Sisters, This is that which is
in my heart from the Lord of the Vineyard unto you, When you are drawn together
into the Congregation of the righteous, to sound forth the praises of the Lord
of the Vineyard, then keep in the true fear, that so you may have the perfect
feeling one of another, in the spirit of prophecy, that so your spirits may be
subject one unto another in the spirit of prophecy, and so one give way unto
another, that so all may be eased, and none burdened.

Friends, It is a good and honest and upright heart, that in all things will do
as it would be done by; the Lord God loves that heart, and he will greatly
bless and prosper that man. So ye beloved of the Lord, Labor in the love,
every one in the uprightness and integrity of his heart, both toward his God
and his Neighbor, and every one will know his place and his work in the
Vineyard, and every one will labor in the measure of the gift committed unto
him, as a good Steward of the grace given unto him, whether it be more or less;
and here none will look out at another, he that has the lesser measure will
not overstrain himself in his labor, to strive to run or equal parallel with
him that has the greater measure; but every one here will labor in the love,
according to the strength received from the Lord of the Vineyard; and here none
will be stifled, or maimed, but all will be preserved, and grow and prosper and
renew their strength daily, and the Lord of the Vineyard will walk in the midst
of us continually, and he will fill our Vessels with the pure virtue of his own
life, and the Harmonious and Melodious sound will be heard amongst us. Oh my
Friends, Let us all dwell in the Munition of the Rock that is low in the
Valley, so shall we be safe from harm. In the Munition of the Rock which lyoth
low in the Valley, the great Leviathan, that piercing Serpent has no place;
therefore there let us all repose, and dwell and abide continually, so shall we
be preserved unto the end, and the Fountain kept open, yea more and more open,
and the streams flow more and more, to the refreshing of the tender plants of
the Lords Vineyard, and all the honor and glory will sweetly sound and redound
unto the Lord of the Vineyard, unto whom it is due, and here none of the
Laborers in the Lords Vineyard, will murmr against the Lord of the Vineyard,
nor say in their hearts, We have labored in the heat of the day; and do thou
give unto those that come but now, as much as unto us? And if any should so say
unto the Lord of the Vineyard, then this is the answer of the voice which is
holy, Friend, I do thee no wrong.

But ye Ancients in Israel, Feel, I say seel me, You are very honorable in my
heart, God Almighty knows; and you know honor is not to that which seeks
it; and what I here write, is by the constraint of the Spirit of my Lord, and
in the same receive me. Oh my Friends, Bowels of love and pity I do feel
greatly to yearne in me unto the weak and feeble, and strained and maimed; Oh
pity, pity and compassion toward them. O ye Ancients in Israel, who dwell in
the deep, and have the healing virtue, strengthen the weak, comfort the feeble,
bind up the wounds of your neighbors, like the good Samaritan, pour in oil,
and the chief Shepherd, the Lord of the Vineyard, he will be your everlasting
reward. The Lord God keep you in your Dominion, and make you more and more
famous and honorable; even so Amen, says the soul of him, who is one of the
little ones of the thousands of Israel.

Friends, We are come unto the glorious day that makes all things manifest,
which searches out the hidden things of Esau: We are come to the true
Touchstone, by which we are come to know our own spirits in measure, and we
are become the Salt of the earth, by the Revelation of the Day which is sprung
from on high, and has visited us, and now as we have received Jesus Christ the
Light, let us walk in him, who is the fountain of Love; and if we abide in him,
who is the Light, Way, Truth and Life, here we cannot stumble nor fall, for he
that walks in the Light, there is no occasion of stumbling in him: Now
Friends, seeing that our God has done such great and glorious things for us,
let us all wait upon him in great reverence and fear, seeing it is he that
brings all hidden things to Light; let us diligently wait upon him, to lead
us and guide us in all our labors and travels in this glorious work of his, in
which he has made us Instruments.

Friends, it is a high and weighty work that our God has called us unto, even
to be as Instruments in his hands to win Souls unto him, which is the
high-calling, no things to be compared to it; therefore let us fear, let us
dread, yea, let us stand in awe continually of him, the Lord our Leader, that
so we may know that we have our continual being and Center in him, and so live
in him, and move in and with him, and not without him, nor before him, for in
him we have the true seeing, feeling, tasting and handling; he that has given
us the knowledge of our own spirits, by the same wisdom he gives us to know
and discern and taste the spirits of men: So Friends, let us follow our Guide
with much diligence and fear, and let no reports be received as at a distance,
but try the spirits that report with the true Touchstone, whether it be of
God, or not; and if upon trial you find it be of God, then you may wait to feel
the thing reported, and then wait to feel whether God requires any thing of
you, to speak unto the thing reported unto you, and this I find to be very
safe; but if upon trial made, that you find that spirit that reports, not to be
of God, but a flattering or backbi^ing, or whispering, or envious, or proud
spirit, then, I say, wait upon the Lord God, and if thou feel him move in thee,
to lay weight upon that spirit, pity it not, for it is for the wrath, plague
and vengeance of the Lord God, and here the evil Eye will be kept blind, and
straightness kept out of the Mind, and our understandings will be kept open,
and we shall grow in the pure discerning, and with the eye that is of God we
shall see what to nourish, and what to feed with judgment; and here is the true
judgment, and this judgment will stand, and it will not hurt nor destroy any
thing of God in any; and here that wicked one, who fitteth his vessels to
spread his Poysonfull and cursed seed of Dissension, will be kept out, and his
Instruments kept under, and the body will be kept out of Rents, and love, mercy
and peace will be greatly multiplied unto us and amongst us.

And thus I have discharged my Conscience in obedience unto my God, and now in
love, joy and peace, I cease to write, and heartily bid you all Farewell.

Shrewsbury Common Goal, where I remain a Witness for my God, this 26 day of
the 10. Month, 1661. W. G.
