THE ARTICLES OF THE FAITH OF THE CHURCH of CHRIST, OR Congregation meeting at
Horsley-down, BENJAMIN KEACH, Pastor, As asserted this 10 th of the 6 th Month,
1697.

LONDON; Printed in the Year 1697.

To the Congregation with whom I am a Member (and the unworthy Overseer) who
are in God the Father, and in our Lord Jesus Christ; Grace, Mercy and Peace be
multiplied.
Most Dear and Beloved in Christ:
I Hope I can say (with the holy Apostle) that you are by me dearly beloved, my
Joy, and my Crown; yea you are my Honor, and in you I would rejoice, being the
Ornament of my poor Ministry, by which the most of you have (through the
Blessing of God) been converted to Jesus Christ: and if you stand fast in the
Faith in one Spirit, striving together for the Faith of the Gospel, and do
adorn your Profession, living in Love, and endeavoring to keep the unity of
the Spirit in the bond of Peace, you will cause my latter days to be most sweet
and comfortable to me, after all those Troubles, Sorrows, and Reproaches I have
met with, both from within and from without. Evident it is God has most
eminently appeared to strengthen your hands: tho the Archers have sorely
grieved you, and shot at you, yet your Bow abides in strength; and that the
Arms of your Hands may still abide strong by the Arm of the mighty God of
Jacob, shall be my continual Prayers.

My Brethren, I here present you with that which you have so long waited for,
and desired me to endeavor to do, viz. to state an account of the most
concerning Articles of your Faith, which you have heard read, and have approved
of, and which I thought good no longer to delay the doing of. (1.) Not knowing
how soon I may put off this Tabernacle, and therefore would leave behind me an
account of that holy Doctrine and Order, in which through Grace you are
established (for at your desire also I have drawn up the whole Rules of your
holy Discipline, which you may have added unto this, and bound up together).
(2.) And the rather I have done this, because the General and more Large
Confession of the Faith of our Churches, is now out of Print; but that is not
all, for that being 12 d. price, some cannot well purchase it. (3.) And also
that all Men may see what our Faith is, and that we differ not from our
Brethren who bear other Names in any Fundamental Point or Article of Faith; and
that they may discern the difference between you and some that bear the same
Name with you. (4.) Tho you agree in the general with all other Churches of the
same Faith, in all those Articles there inserted, yet therein your whole Faith
is not comprehended, viz. that of Imposition of Hands upon baptized Believers
as such, and singing of God's Praise, etc. because some of our Churches dissent
from us therein: yet my desire is you would nevertheless show all Tenderness,
Charity and Moderation to such as differ from you in those Cases, and not
refuse Communion with them; and indeed your late sweet Temper appears to be
such, that I need not press you to this. All that I shall say more, is to
entreat you to labor after Holiness, and to awake out of sleep, that you may
adorn your sacred Profession, and prepare to meet the Lord; that as you have a
good Doctrine, you may also have a holy and good Conversation; and then we need
not fear who can harm us, whilst we are followers of that which is good, O let
us bear one with another. and if in any thing we differ, let us avoid all
Animosities. Brethren, great things are near, watch and pray, look out and be
ready. But at present I shall conclude with the words of the Apostle, Finally,
Brethren, farewell; be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one Mind, live in
peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you.

So prays your unworthy Brother, Pastor, Overseer, and Servant, who earnestly
desires your Prayers, also,

B. Keach.

The Articles of Faith of the Church of Christ meeting at Horsley-Down.
Of God, and of the Holy Trinity.
I. WE do believe, Joh. 4.24. Job 11.7, 8, 9. Psalm. 90.2. Jam. 1.17. Exodus 3.4.
Rev. 4.8. Deuteronomy. 6.4. Exodus 34.6, 7.
declare and testify, that there is but One Only Living and True God, who is a
Spirit Infinite, Eternal, Immense and Unchangeable in his Being, Wisdom, Power,
Holiness, Justice, Goodness, Truth and Faithfulness.

II. That there are three Persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and Holy
Spirit; Mat. 28.19.
and that these three are One God, 1 John 5.5.
the same in Essence, equal in Power and Glory.

Of the Decrees of God.
III. THat the Decrees of God are his Eternal Purpose according to the Counsel
of his Will, Ephesians. 1.4, 11.
whereby for his own Glory he has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, Romans
9.22, 23.
even those Evils that his Wisdom and Justice permits for the manifestation of
the Glory of those his Attributes: And that God executes his Decrees in the
Works of Creation and Providence.

Of Creation.
IV. THat the Works of Creation are God's creating all things of nothing by his
Word of Power, Genesis 1. Heb. 11.3.
in six days, and all very good. That God created Man Male and Female, Genesis
1.26, 27, 28. Col. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.
after his own Image, in Knowledge, Righteousness, and Holiness, with Power and
Dominion over the Creatures.

Of God's Providence.
V. WE believe that God's Works of Providence are his most holy, wise, and
powerful preserving, and governing all his Creatures, and their Actions.

Of the holy Scriptures.
VI. WE believe the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the Word
of God, and are the only Rule of Faith, and Practice; 2 Timothy 3.16. Ephesians. 2.20.
Joh. 5.39. Deuteronomy. 17.18. Rev. 1.3. Acts 8.30.
all things being contained therein that are necessary for us to know
concerning God, and our Duty unto him, and also unto all Men. That all Persons
ought to read, hear, and understand the holy Scriptures. That the Light of
Nature, and Works of Providence, tho they declare plainly there is a God, yet
not so effectually as the holy Scriptures; nor can we know without them how,
Genesis 1. and 3.15, 16.
and in what space of time God created all things. Neither came we any other
ways but by the holy Scriptures to the Knowledge of Christ the blessed Mediator;
Job. 20.30, 31. and 21.24.
which indeed none can savingly know but by the Word and Spirit of God.

Of Original Sin.
Genesis 3.5, 6. Eccl. 7.29. Romans 3.23. 1 John 3.4. Tit. 1.13. Romans 5.17. Genesis
6.5. Jer. 17.9. Romans 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, etc. Jam. 1.14. 1 Cor. 15.14. Romans
5.6. Romans 8.7. Col. 1.22. Mat. 15.19. Romans 7.7, 14, 17, 18, 23, 24. Lam. 3.39.
Romans 6.23. Gal. 3.10.
VII. WE do believe, that God having created Man, he entered into a Covenant of
Life with him, upon the condition of perfect Obedience; making the first Adam a
common Head to all his Seed: and that our first Parents being left to the
freedom of their own Will, fell from the Estate wherein they were created, by
eating of the forbidden Fruit: and that Adam being set up as a public Person,
we all sinned in him, and fell with him into a state of Sin, of Wrath and
Misery; the Sinfulness of which state consists in the guilt of Adam's first
Sin, the want of Original Righteousness, and the Corruption of our whole
Nature: from whence all actual Sins proceed, as Water out of a filthy and an
unclean Fountain. So that not only by Imputation all Men became Sinners in the
first Adam, but also as the same corrupt Nature is conveyed to all his
Posterity, Job 11.12. and 15.14. and 25.4.
who descend from him in ordinary Generation.

By this Sin all Mankind lost the Image of God, Col. 3.10. Tit. 1.13. Psalm.
51.5.
and Communion with him, being liable to all the Miseries of this Life, and to
Death itself; and also are dead in Sins and Trespasses, and obnoxious to the
Wrath of God, and the eternal Pains of Hell for ever. Hence we say that all are
conceived and born in Sin, Ephesians. 2.2, 3.
and are the Children of Wrath, even the Elect as well as others, being wholly
defiled in all the Faculties and Parts of Soul and Body, Genesis 6.5. Romans 7.5,
14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24.
and utterly indisposed and disabled to do any thing that is spiritually good,
and wholly inclined with a strong propensity to all things that are evil.

Of Man's Free Will.
VIII. WE believe Man in his state of Innocence had freedom of Will to do good;
but by the Fall he has utterly lost all that Power and Ability, Ephesians. 2.2, 3.
being woefully depraved in all the Faculties of his Soul; there being in the
Will and Mind of all naturally much Enmity against God, Romans 8.7.
and a total aversion to him, and to every thing that is spiritually good; Job
24.13.
loving Darkness, and rebelling against the Light.

Ephesians. 4.28.
But when a Man is renewed by Divine Grace, tho there is no force put upon the
Will, Col. 1.21. Psalm. 110.3. Romans 7.11, 17, 18, 23, 24.
yet it is made willing, and acts freely, in the day of God's Power: tho the
Work is not perfect in any Faculty in the Regenerate, nor will be in this Life.

Of Christ the Mediator.
IX. WE believe that God having, out of his own mere good Pleasure, Ephesians. 1.4.
Romans 3.20, 21, 22. Gal. 3.21, 22. 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. Joh. 1.14. Galat. 4.4.
and infinite Love, elected some Persons of the lost Seed of the first Adam
unto everlasting Life, from all Eternity, did enter into a Covenant of Grace
with the second Person of the Trinity, (who was set up as the common Head of
all the Elect) to deliver them out of the state of Sin and Misery, Romans 9.5.
Luke 1.35. Col. 2.9. Heb. 7.24, 25.
and to bring them into a state of Salvation and eternal Happiness.

That the second Person in the Godhead, Phil. 2.6. Zech. 6.13.
(being the eternal Son of God, Coessential, and Coequal with the Father)
according to that holy Covenant and Compact that was between them both, became
Man, or assumed our Nature, Joh. 1.14. 1 Timothy 2.5. Heb. 2.14.
and so was, and continues to be God and Man in two distinct Natures, in one
Person for ever. And that he the Son of God by his becoming Man, Mat. 2.26, 38.
Luke 1.27, 31, 34, 3^. Gal. (...). Heb. (...).
did take unto him a True Body, and Reasonable Soul, being conceived by the
holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin, and was born of her, yet without Sin.

Of the Offices of Christ.
X. WE believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Redeemer, 1 Timothy 2.5.
and the one blessed Mediator between God and Man, executes a threefold
Office, both the Office of a Priest, the Office of a King, and the Office of a
Prophet.

First, That he executes the Office of a Priest, Heb. 2.17. Heb. 7.24. Act.
15.14, 15, 16.
(1.) In his once offering up himself a Sacrifice, to satisfy Divine Justice,
and to reconcile God to us, and us to God. 1 John 2.2. Heb. 7.25. and 10.21.
and 9.24.
(2.) And in making continual Intercession for us, that the Merits of his Blood
may be made effectual unto us.

Secondly, That he executes the Office of a King in subduing us unto himself,
Isa. 33.22. and 32.1, 2. 1 Cor. 15.25. Psalm. 100.
and in giving us Laws and holy Precepts, by which we ought to walk; and also
in his restraining and conquering all his, and our Enemies.

Thirdly, That he executes the Office of a Prophet, Acts 3.22. Joh. 1.18. 1
Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. Joh. 15.15. and 20.31.
in revealing to us by his Word and Spirit, the whole Will of God concerning
all things that appertain to Faith and Practice.

Of Christ's Humiliation and Exaltation.
Gal. 4.4. Heb. 12.23. Isa. 53.2, 3. Luke 22.44.
XI. WE believe that Christ's Humiliation consisted in that great Condescension
of his in assuming our Nature, and being born in a low condition, Mat. 27.46
Phil. 2.8. 1 Cor. 15.4. Acts 2.24, 25, 26, 27, 31.
made under the Law, undergoing the many Miseries of this Life, the Wrath of
God, the Curse of the Law, and the ignominious Death of the Cross, continuing
under Death for a time.

And that his Exaltation consists in his rising again from the dead the third
day, 1 Cor. 15.4. Mark 16.19. Ephesians. 1.20. Acts 1.11. and 17.31. 1 Pet. 3.22.
and in his ascending up into Heaven, in sitting at the Right Hand of God;
Angels, Powers, and Principalities being made subject unto him; and in his
being made Judge of the quick and dead.

Of effectual Calling.
XII. WE do believe that we are made Partakers of the Redemption purchased by
Christ, Joh. 1.11. Tit. 3.5, 6. Ephesians. 1.13, 14. 1 Cor. 1.9. Ephesians. 2.8.
by the effectual Application of his Merits, etc. unto us by the Holy Spirit,
thereby uniting us to Christ in effectual Calling: And that effectual Calling
is the Work of God's Free Grace, Ephesians. 3.17.
who by his Spirit works Faith in us, who are altogether passive therein; 1
Cor. 1.9. 2 Timothy 1.9. 2 Thessalonians. 2.13, 14. Acts 2.37. and 20.18. Ezekiel. 36.27.
John 6.44, 45.
and convincing us of Sin and Misery, enlightening our Minds in the Knowledge of
Christ, and renewing our Wills, and changing our whole Hearts, he does persuade
and enable us to embrace Jesus Christ freely, as he is offered in the Gospel.

Of Justification.
XIII. WE do believe Justification is a free Act of God's Grace, Romans 3.23, 24,
25, 26.
through that Redemption which is in Christ, (who, as our Head, was acquitted,
justified, and discharged, Ephesians. 1.6, 7. Tit. 3.7.
and we in him, when he rose from the Dead) and when applied to us, we in our
own Persons are actually justified, Romans 5.15, 16, 17, 18.
in being made and pronounced righteous, 1 Cor. 1.30. 2 Cor. 5.21
through the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us; and all our Sins, past,
present, and to come, for ever pardoned; which is received by Faith alone. And
that our Sanctification, nor Faith it self, is any part of our Justification
before God; it not being either the Habit, or Act of Believing, or any Act of
Evangelical Obedience imputed to us, but Christ, Act. 13.39.
and his active and passive Obedience only, apprehended by Faith: and that
Faith in no sense tends to make Christ's Merits more satisfactory unto God; but
that he was as fully reconciled and satisfied for his Elect in Christ by his
Death before Faith as after; 2 Cor. 5.21.
otherwise it would render God only reconcilable, Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.
(not reconciled) and make Faith part of the Payment or Satisfaction unto God,
Romans 10.5.
and so lessen the Merits of Christ, as if they were defective or insufficient.
Yet we say, it is by Faith that we receive the Atonement, or by which means (as
an Instrument) we come to apprehend and receive him, and to have personal
Interest in him, and to have our free Justification evidenced to our own
Consciences.

Of Adoption.
XIV. WE believe Adoption is an Act of God's Free Grace, 1 John 3.1.
whereby such who were the Children of Wrath by Nature, are received into the
Number, John 1.10. Romans 8.14. Gal. 2.16. 1 John 3.1, 2. and 4.7. and 5.1.
and have Right to all the Privileges of the Sons of God; and that such who are
adopted, are also by the Spirit regenerated, and hence said to be born of God.

Of Sanctification.
2 Thessalonians. 2.13. Ephesians. 4.13. Romans 6.5, ^ 7. Romans 8.29, 30. Romans 5.1, 2, 5. and
14.17. Prove. 4 18. Joh. 51.3. 1 Pet. 1.5.
XV. THAT Sanctification is the Work of God's Free Grace also, whereby we are
renewed in the whole Man after the Image of God, and are enabled more and more
to die unto Sin, and live unto Righteousness. And that the Benefits we receive,
and which flow from or accompany Justification, are Adoption, Sanctification,
Peace of Conscience, Manifestations of God's Love, Joy in the Holy Ghost, an
Increase of Grace, an Assurance of eternal Life, and final Perseverance unto
the end.

Of the Souls of Men at Death.
XVI. WE believe, 1 Cor. 15.43. Mat. 25.23 Mat. 10.32 1 John 3.2. 1 Cor. 13.12.
1 Thessalonians. 4.17, 18. 2 Cor. 5.1, 2 Phil. 1.21.22.
that at Death the Souls of Believers are made perfect in Holiness, and do
immediately pass into Glory; and their Bodies dying in Union with Christ, or
dying in the Lord, do rest in their Graves till the Resurrection, when they
shall be raised up in Glory. And that their Souls being reunited to their
Bodies, they shall be openly acknowledged, and acquitted, and made completely
blessed, both in Soul and Body, and shall have the full Enjoyment of God to all
Eternity. Luk 16 ^5 1 Pet. 3.19, 20.
And that the Souls of the Wicked at their Death are cast into Hell, or are in
Torment: and that their Bodies lie in the Grave under Wrath, Luke 16.23, 24.
Acts 1.25. 1 Pet. 3.19 Ps. 49.11. John 9.28, 29. 2 Thessalonians. 1.8, 9.
and shall by virtue of the Power of Christ be raised from the Dead; and their
Souls being reunited to their Bodies, shall be judged and condemned, and cast
into a Furnace of Fire, or into unspeakable Torment, with the Devil and his
Angels, for ever and ever.

Of the Law.
XVII. WE believe God requires Obedience of Man, and that the Rule of that
Obedience is the moral Law as it is in the Hands of Christ; Mich. 6.8. 1 Samuel
15.22. Rev. 2.14. Mat. 19.17 Mat. 22.37, 38, 39, 40.
which teaches all Persons their Duty to God, and to Man; the Sum of all being
this, to love the Lord our God with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and
with all our Strength, and our Neighbors as our selves. And that tho the Law
is abolished as a Covenant of Works, and as so considered, we are dead to it, 1 John 3.4. Romans 7.3, 4
and that dead to us; yet it remains as a Rule of Life and Righteousness for
ever.

Genesis 6.5. Romans 3.9, 10, 11, 12, etc. Ezekiel. 8.6. 1 John 5.16 Ps 78.17, 32, 56.
XVIII. We believe no mere Man, since the Fall, is able in this Life perfectly
to keep the Holy Law of God; and that every Offense against the Law deserves
eternal Death, tho some Sins are more heinous in God's Sight than others.

And that God, as a simple Act of Mercy, will not, does not, pardon any Man;
neither does it seem consistent with his Holiness and Justice so to do, Exodus
34.6
without a full Satisfaction: Romans 3.25, 26.
wherefore he substituted Christ in our room and stead, perfectly to keep the
whole Law, and to die, Gal. 4.4.
or bear that Wrath which we deserved for our breaking of it; Isa. 53.4, 5, 6,
10, 11. 1 Pet. 2.24.
he being pleased in his infinite Love and Grace to transfer our Sins, Guilt
and Punishment, upon his own Son, (who took our Nature upon him, as our blessed
Head and Representative) that his active Obedience and Righteousness might be
our just Title unto eternal Life; and his Death (who bore our Hell Torments) be
our full Discharge from the Wrath of God, Romans 8.1.
and eternal Condemnation.

And that all who would receive this Title, John 5.24. John 3.15, 16.
and have this Discharge so as to escape God's Wrath, and the Curse of the Law,
Heb. 6.18, 19, 20. Col. 2.12. Acts 15.9.
must fly to Christ, and lay hold on him by Faith; which Faith is known by its
Fruits, having lively, Sin-killing, Soul-humbling, Acts 2.36. Job 42.5. 1 Pet.
2.7. John 3.3.
Self-abasing, Christ-exalting, and Heart-purifying Operations, always
attending it.

Of Faith and Repentance.
XIX. WE believe that Faith is a saving Grace, John 1.12. Isa. 26.3, 4. Phil.
3.9. Ephesians. 2.8.
or the most precious Gift of God; and that it is an Instrument whereby we
receive, take hold of, and wholly rest upon Jesus Christ, as offered to us in
the Gospel. That Repentance unto Life is also a saving Grace, Acts 2.37. Joh
2.12. Jer. 3.22. and 31.18, 19. Ezekiel. 36.31. 2 Cor. 7.10. Isa. 1.16, 17 Heb.
6.1, 2.
whereby a Sinner, out of a true Sense of Sin, and Apprehension of God's Mercy
in Christ, does with Grief and Hatred of his Sins, turn from them. And that tho
Repentance is in order of Nature called the first Principle of the Doctrine of
Christ, yet we believe no Man can savingly repent, Zic. 12.10.
unless he believes in Jesus Christ, and apprehends the Free Pardon and
Forgiveness of all his Sins through the Blood of the everlasting Covenant, and
the Sight and Sense of God's Love in a bleeding Savior; being that only thing
that melts and breaks the stony Heart of a poor Sinner, Acts 2.36.
as the Sight of a free Pardon from a Prince humbles the stout Heart of a
rebellious Malefactor.

Of the Means of Grace.
XX. WE believe that the outward and more ordinary means, Mat. 28.19, 20. Acts
2.42, 46, 47. Neh. 8.8. 1 Cor. 14.24, 25.
whereby Christ communicates to us the Benefits of Redemption, are his Holy
Ordinances, as Prayer, the Word of God, and Preaching, with Baptism, and the
Lord's Supper, etc. and yet notwithstanding it is the Spirit of God that makes
Prayer, Acts 26.32 Psalm. 19.8. Romans 1.15, 16.
Reading, etc. and specially the Preaching of the Word, effectual to the
convincing, converting, building up, and comforting, through Faith, all the
Elect of God unto Salvation.

And that it is the Duty of all, Acts 20.32 Romans 10.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Prove.
8.34.
that the Word may become effectual to their Salvation, to attend upon it with
all Diligence, Preparation, and Prayer, that they may receive it with Faith and
Love, 1 Pet. 2.1, 2. Ps. 119.18 Heb. 4.2. 2 Thessalonians. 2.10. Jam. 1.25.
and lay it up in their Hearts, and practice it in their Lives.

Of Baptism.
XXI. WE believe that Baptism is a Holy Ordinance of Christ, 1 Pet. 3.21 1 Cor.
12.13. Mat. 28.19, 20. Romans 6.3, 4, 5. Col. 2.12, 13. Gal. 3.27. Acts 2.38. and
22.16.
or a pure Gospel-Institution; and to be unto the Party baptized, a sign of his
Fellowship with Christ in his Death, Burial, and Resurrection, and of his being
grafted into him, and of Remission of Sins, and of his giving himself up to
God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in Newness of Life.

We also believe that Baptism ought not to be administered to any but to those
who actually profess Repentance toward God, Acts 8.37. Col. 2.21, 22.
and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

That the Infants of Believers ought not to be baptized, because there is
neither Precept, or Example, Rev. 22.18 Prove. 30.6.
or any certain Consequence in the Holy Scripture for any such Practice: And we
ought not to be wise above what is written. And that a human Tradition or
Custom ought not to be regarded, but that it is sinful, and abominable.

We believe also that Baptism is only rightly administered by Immersion, or
dipping the whole Body in Water, Mat. 28.19, 20. Mat. 3.16. Joh. 3.23. Acts
8.38. Romans 6.3. Col. 2.13.
into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; according
to Christ's Institution, and the Practice of the Apostles; and not by
sprinkling, or pouring of Water, or dipping some part of the Body in Water,
after the Tradition of Men.

And that it is the indispensible Duty of such who are baptized, Acts 2.41, 42.
and 5.13, 14. 1 Pet. 2.5. Luke 1.6.
to give up themselves to some particular orderly Church of Jesus Christ, and
to walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameless: Baptism
being an initiating Ordinance.

Of a true Church.
XXII. WE believe a true Church of Christ is not National, Acts 2.40, 41, 42.
nor Parochial, but does consist of a number of godly Persons, who upon the
Profession of their Faith and Repentance have been baptized, and in a solemn
manner have in a Holy Covenant given themselves up to the Lord, and to one
another, to live in Love, and to endeavor to keep the Unity of the Spirit in
the Bond of Peace: Ephesians. 4.3.
Among whom the Word of God is duly and truly preached; Acts 2.40, 41, 42, 43,
44, 45, 46, etc. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2.
and Holy Baptism, the Lord's Supper, and all other Ordinances are duly
administered, according to the Word of God, and the Institution of Christ in the
Primitive Church: watching over one another, and communicating to each other's
Necessities, as becomes Saints; living Holy Lives, as becomes their sacred
Profession; and not to forsake the assembling themselves, Heb. 10.25.
as the manner of some is; or to take leave to hear where they please in other
Places when the Church is assembled, but to worship God, and feed in that
Pasture, or with that Church, with whom they have covenanted, and given up
themselves as particular Members thereof.

Of Laying on of Hands.
XXIII. WE believe that laying on of Hands (with Prayer) upon baptized
Believers, Heb. 5.12. and 6, 1, 2. Acts 8. and 19.6.
as such, is an Ordinance of Christ, and ought to be submitted unto by all such
Persons that are admitted to partake of the Lord's Supper; and that the end of
this Ordinance is not for the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, Ephesians. 1.13, 14.
but for a farther Reception of the Holy Spirit of Promise, or for the Addition
of the Graces of the Spirit, and the Influences thereof; to confirm,
strengthen, and comfort them in Christ Jesus; Acts 8. and 19.
it being ratified and established by the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit in
the Primitive Times, to abide in the Church, as meeting together on the first
Day of the Week was, Act. 2.1. that being the Day of Worship, or Christian
Sabbath, under the Gospel; and as Preaching the Word was, Acts 10.44. and as
Baptism was, Mat. 3.16. and Prayer was, Acts 4.31. and singing Psalms, etc.
was, Acts 16.25, 26. so this of laying on of Hands was, Acts 8. and chapter 19. For
as the whole Gospel was confirmed by Signs and Wonders, Heb. 2.3, 4.
and diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost in general, so was every
Ordinance in like manner confirmed in particular.

Of the Lord's Supper.
Mat. 26.26, 27, 28. Mark 14.21, 22, 23. Luke 22.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25,
26, 27. Acts 20.17.
XXIV. WE believe that the Holy Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, which he
instituted the Night before he was betrayed, ought to be observed to the end of
the World; and that it consists only in breaking of Bread, and drinking of
Wine, in remembrance of Christ's Death; it being appointed for our spiritual
Nourishment, and Growth in Grace, and as a farther Engagement in, and to all
Duties we owe to Jesus Christ, and as a Pledge of his eternal Love to us, and as
a Token of our Communion with him, and one with another. And that due
Preparation and Examination is required of all that ought to partake thereof;
and that it cannot be neglected by any approved and orderly Member without Sin.

Of Church Officers.
XXV. WE do believe that every particular Church of Christ is Independent; 1 Timothy 3.1, 2, etc. Tit. 1.5.
and that no one Church has any Priority or Super-intendency above or over
another: and that every Church ought to be Organical: that an Elder, or Elders,
a Deacon, or Deacons, ought to be elected in every Congregation, according to
those holy Qualifications laid down in the Word of God: 1 Timothy 3.2 -- 12.
and that the said Elders and Deacons so chosen, ought solemnly to be ordained
with Prayer, Tit. 1.5, 6, 7, 8. Acts 13.3. 1 Timothy 5.22. and 4.14.
and laying on of Hands of the Eldership. That such Churches as have not
Officers so ordained, are disorderly, there being something still wanting.

Of Prayer.
Phil. 4.6. Psalm. 65.2. 1 John 4.23. 1 Pet. 2.5. Romans 8.26. John 5.14. Psalm.
47.7. Eccl. 5.1, 2. Jam. 5.16. Ephesians. 6.18. 1 Cor. 14.14. Col. 4.2. Josh. 24.15.
Genesis 18.19.
XXVI. WE believe Prayer is a holy Ordinance of God, and that it ought to be
performed by the Help and Assistance of the Holy Spirit; and that not only the
Prayer Christ taught his Disciples, but the whole Word of God is to be our Rule
how to pray, and pour forth our Souls unto God: and that it is the
indispensible Duty of all godly Families (and others also) as well as private
Christians, daily to pray for all things they need, and to give Thanks every
Day for all good things they receive: and that the Omission of this Duty is a
great Scandal to Religion, Jer. 10.25.
and a great Evil when it is carelessly or negligently performed.

Of singing of Psalms, etc.
Ephesians. 5.19. Col. 3.16.
XXVII. WE believe that singing the Praises of God, is a holy Ordinance of
Christ, and not a part of Natural Religion, or a moral Duty only; but that it
is brought under Divine Institution, it being injoined on the Churches of
Christ to sing Psalms, Hymns, and spiritual Songs; Acts 16.25 Heb. 2.12. Jam.
5.13.
and that the whole Church in their Public Assemblies (as well as private
Christians) ought to sing God's Praises, according to the best Light they have
received. Moreover, it was practiced in the great Representative Church, by our
Lord Jesus Christ with his Disciples, Mat. 26.30 Mar. 14.26
after he had instituted and celebrated the Sacred Ordinance of his Holy
Supper, as a commemorative Token of Redeeming Love.

Of the Christian Sabbath.
XXVIII. WE believe that one Day in seven, Exodus 20.
ought to be solemnly observed in the Worship of God; and that by Moses's Law
the Jews and proselyted Strangers were to keep the seventh Day: but from the
Resurrection of Christ the first Day of the Week ought by all Christians to be
observed Holy to the Lord, that being called the Lord's Day; Rev. 1.10.
and the first time the Church met Act. 2.1, 2. Acts 20.7.
together after Christ's Ascension was on the Day of Pentecost, which was the
first Day of the Week, as Tradition has handed it down: and on that Day the
Church also met together to break Bread, 1 Cor. 16.2
and make Collections for the poor Saints: and no mention is made that any one
Gospel Church kept the Jewish Sabbath in all the New Testament. And we believe
that an Apostolical Precedent is equivalent to an Apostolical Precept in this
case.

Of Ministers, and their Maintenance.
XXIX. WE do believe that every Brother that has received a Gift to preach,
having first passed the Probation of the Church, and being regularly called by
the same, 1 Timothy 3.2. Ephesians. 4.11.
ought to exercise the said Gift to the Edification of the Church when desired;
1 Pet. 4.10 Romans 12.6, 7.
and that no Brother ought to take upon him to preach, until he has a lawful
Call so to do.

Moreover, we believe that it is the indispensible Duty of every Church,
according to their Ability, to provide their Pastor, 1 Cor. 9.9 -- 14. Romans
15.27. Gal. 6.6. 1 Timothy 5.15.
or Elders, a comfortable Maintenance; as God has ordained, that he that
preaches the Gospel, should live of the Gospel, and not of his own Labor; but
that he should wholly give himself up to the Work of the Ministry, and to watch
over the Flock, being to be freed from all secular Business, and Encumbrances
of the World: and yet that it is abominable Evil for any Man to preach the
Gospel for filthy lucre sake, 1 Pet. 5.2.
but he must do it of a ready mind.

Of the First Covenant.
XXX. WE believe that the first Covenant, Genesis 2.17.
or Covenant of Works, was primarily made with Adam, and with all Mankind in
him, Romans 3.12.
by virtue of which he stood in a justified state before the Fall, Romans 10.5.
and 5.10 to 30.
upon the condition of his own perfect and personal Obedience. But by the Fall
he made himself incapable of Life by that Covenant.

That the Law God gave by Moses to Israel, was of the same nature of that given
to Adam, Romans 3.19, 20. 2 Cor. 3.9, 11.
being a second Ministration of it; but not given for Life, but to make Sin
exceeding sinful, and to show how unable Man was in his fallen state to fulfill
the Righteousness of God; Romans 7.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
and so (with the Ceremonial Law) it was given in subservienty to the Gospel,
Gal. 3 10.
as a Schoolmaster to bring Sinners to Christ.

Of the New and Second Covenant.
XXXI. WE believe the Covenant of Grace was primarily made with the second
Adam, Zech. 6.13.
and in him with all the Elect, who as God-man, or Mediator, was set up from
everlasting as a Common Person, Romans 3.23, 24, 25, 26. Isa. 57.5, 6, 10, 11.
or as their Head and Representative; who freely obliged or engaged himself to
the Father for them, perfectly to keep the whole Law in their Nature that had
sinned, Romans 8.3. Heb. 9.15, 16, 17.
and to satisfy Divine Justice by bearing their Sins upon his own Body, i. e.
the Guilt of all their Sins, Heb. 7.^
which were laid upon him: and that he sustained that Wrath and Curse in his
Body and Soul, Luke 2^
that was due to them for all their Transgressions: 1 Cor. 11.^
and having received their discharge from Wrath and Condemnation, he gives it
out to all that believe in him, Romans 6.2. and 8.16, 17, 1^.
and obtain Union with him, who are thereby brought actually into the said New
Covenant, and have a personal Right to all the Blessings thereof.

Of Election.
XXXII. WE do believe that God from all Eternity, according unto the most wise
and holy Counsel of his own Will, Romans 8.29, 30, 31.
freely and unchangeably decreed and ordained, for the manifestation of his own
Glory, some Angels, and some of the lost Sons and Daughters of Adam, Acts 13.48.
unto eternal Life; and that their number is so certain and definite, that it
cannot be either increased or diminished: and that others are left or passed by
under a Decree of Preterition. Romans 9.11.
And that those of Mankind that are predestined and foreordained, are
particularly and personally designed unto eternal Life: 1 Thessalonians. 4.4, 5.
and these God, according to his eternal and immutable Purpose, and good
pleasure of his Will, Ephesians. 1.3, 4, 11.
did choose in Christ (the Head of this Election) unto everlasting Glory, ^ Thessalonians. 2.13.
of his mere free Grace, without any foreseen Faith or Obedience and
Perseverance therein, or any thing in the Creature as a Condition or Cause
moving him thereunto; and all this only to the Praise of his own glorious Grace.

Of final Perseverance.
XXXIII. WE believe all those whom God has chosen, and who are effectually
called, justified, and sanctified in Jesus Christ, can neither totally, Romans
8.28, 29, 30, 31.
nor finally fall away from a state of Grace; but shall certainly persevere
therein unto the end, and eternally be saved; Joh. 10.28, 29. Romans 8.38, 39*
Romans 8.3^* 33, 3^
and this by virtue of their Election, or the immutable Decree of God, and the
unchangeable Love of God the Father; and by virtue of their Union with Christ,
together with his Death, Resurrection, and Intercession; as also from the
nature of the Covenant of Grace, 2 Timothy 2.^
and Suretyship of Christ; and through the indwelling of the holy Spirit, 2
Cor. 6.17.
who abides in them for ever.

Of the Resurrection.
XXXIV. WE believe that the Bodies of all Men, both the Just and Unjust, shall
rise again at the last day, even the same numerical Bodies that die; tho the
Bodies of the Saints shall be raised immortal and incorruptible, and be made
like Christ's glorious Body: and that the dead in Christ shall rise first.

Of Eternal Judgment.
XXXV. WE believe that God has appointed a Day in which he will judge the World
in Righteousness by Jesus Christ, Acts 17.31.
or that there shall be a general Day of Judgment, when all shall stand before
the Judgment Seat of Christ, 2 Cor. 5.10.
and give an account to him for all things done in this Body: and that he will
pass an eternal Sentence upon all, Eccles. 12.
according as their Works shall be.

Of Marriages.
XXXVI. WE believe Marriage is God's holy Ordinance, Genesis 3.24.
that is to say between one Man and one Woman: Mat. 19.5.
and that no Man ought to have more than one Wife at once: 1 Cor. 6.16.
and that Believers that marry, should marry in the Lord, Ephesians. 5.31.
or such that are Believers, or Godly Persons; and that those who do otherwise,
Romans 7.4.
sin greatly, in violating God's holy Precept: and that Ministers as well as
others may marry; Heb. 13.4.
for Marriage is honorable in all.

Of Civil Magistrates.
XXXVII. WE do believe the supreme* Romans 13.1, 2, 3.
Lord of Heaven and Earth has ordained Magistrates for the good of Mankind:
Tit. 3.1.
and that it is our Duty in all civil and lawful things to obey them for
Conscience sake; nay, 1 Pet. 2.13.
and to pray for all that are in Authority, that under them we may live a godly
and peaceable Life: and that we ought to render unto Caesar the things that are
Cesar's, Mat. 22.21.
and to God the things that are God's.

Of lawful Oaths.
XXXVIII. WE do believe it is lawful to take some Oaths before the Civil
Magistrate; Exodus 20.7. Jer. 4.2. Genesis 24.2. Neh. 5.12. Heb. 6.16, 17.
an Oath of Confirmation being to put an end to all Strife: nay, and that it is
our Duty so to do when lawfully called thereunto: and that those that swear,
ought to swear in Truth, in Righteousness, and in Judgment.

Of Personal Propriety.
Exodus 20.17. Acts 5.4. and 20.33.
XXXIX. WE do believe that every Man has a just and peculiar Right and
Propriety in his own Goods, and that they are not common to others; yet we
believe that every Man is obliged to administer to the poor Saints, and to the
public Interest of God, according to his Ability, or as God has blessed him.

FINIS.
POSTSCRIPT.
THere is something contained in the 13 th Article that may seem to want some
Explication, in these words (speaking of a Man actually and personally
justified) that his Sins past, present, and to come, are all forgiven: We
believing that if any Sins of a justified Person were afterward charged upon
him, it must of necessity make a breach in his unalterable and everlasting
Justification, which is but one Act in God; Romans 8.1.
hence there is no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus: Mr. Tho.
Gilbert.
yet I find an able and worthy Writer distinguishes Pardon of Sin thus, viz.

1. Fundamentally in Christ, as a common Person of all the Elect before Faith,
which lies in Christ making full Satisfaction for all their Sins, meriting
Faith for them, etc.

2. Actual, of all the Elect in Christ on believing; this actual Pardon being
nothing else but the actual Possession in their own Persons of their
fundamental Pardon in the Person of Christ: And Dr. Tho. Goodwin speaks to the
same purpose, to which I agree. And that this actual Pardon of the legal Guilt
is twofold.

1. Formal, of all their Sins past, removing their legal Guilt.

2. Virtual, of all their Sins to come, preventing their legal Guilt. Dr. Ames
speaks to the same purpose, and many others. I cannot see how a Believer should
be for ever formally justified from all Sins past, present, and to come, and
yet not formally pardoned.

This Author which I have lately met with, distinguishes well between Legal
Guilt and Gospel Guilt; the first obliging to Divine Wrath, or eternal
Punishment; the latter, i. e. Gospel Guilt, obliging to Gospel, or Fatherly
Chastisement for Gospel-Sins. Dr. Ames says, that not only the Sins of a
justif^^^ Person that are past are remitted, but also in some sort these to
come, Number. 23.25. Joh. 5.24. yet he distinguishes between a formal and virtual
Pardon: Sins past, says he, are remitted to themselves, Sins to come, in the
Subject or Person sinning.
Now I see not but that as soon as a Believer is personally justified, all his
Sins, tho not yet committed, as to legal Guilt, or vindictive Wrath, i. e. that
Guilt that obliges to eternal Condemnation, are pardoned, for the reason before.

Says he, Virtual Pardon: keeps off Legal Guilt where it would be. To which I
reply, if it be kept-off, so that it never comes upon Believers, then it
follows they were actually pardoned before in that respect: yet he says, Sins
cannot be said to be formally pardoned before formally committed; but says, no
Guilt can come upon them to Condemnation, tho new Guilt; yet no new legal
Guilt, because always justified. We see no hurt if his Terms be admitted.

Object. What do Believers then pray for, when they pray for the Pardon of Sin?

Answ. 1. That God would not chastise them sorely, or afflict them as a Father,
according to the greatness of their Offenses.

2. That if his chastning Hand is upon us, he would be pleased graciously to
remove it.

3. That he would be pleased to clear up to our Consciences, or give us the
evidence of our Pardon through Christ's Merits, and that we may know we are
complete in Christ, or without spot before the Throne in our free Justification.

4. Nay, Believers are to pray to God to remove that Sin from them (says this
worthy Author) whose desert of Punishment cannot be removed from it; and to
spread their Sins before the Lord in the highest sense of the deepest demerit
of all legal Punishment, so that they may put the higher accent upon the free
Grace of God, and estimate upon the full Satisfaction of Christ, whereby their
Persons are so fully freed from all actual Obligation to any Legal Punishment,
the whole and utmost whereof their Sins deserve.

5. Moreover, that God would continue, and never revoke his most gracious
Pardon, till he pronounces the final Sentence of it at the day of Judgment,
(as well this Author notes) for a renewed sense and assurance of its grant and
continuance: and thus to pray, says he, there are both Precepts and Promises.
