HUDIBRAS ANSWERED By True de Case In his own POEM and LANGVAGE.
WHat Railing Ass is Hudibrasse?
some fury come from Hell,
The name it self betrays the Elf,
some charming conjuring spell.
The language of the Dragon Red,
such fire he spits abroad,
As if his Crop wished Dives drop,
to cool his hot abode.
Let Us recton up the strength o'th Cup,
that gives this Fiend such speech,
And see if he deserve to be
in Paul's to lay his breech.
He Is not prophetic, but a shitten critic,
not honest, true or wise,
See how he brawles to shite in Paul's,
and pull out reverend eyes.
Sure he can tell, that came from Hell,
how Organs fright the Devil,
That Reverend Father, hence may gather,
that he is full of evil,
He ill does guess, a Gospel dress
to mask Rebellion in,
Sure coals of wrath, not public faith,
will punish hellish sin.
Hell has no melting, but Fiends yelping,
when Hudibrasse was there;
It Is his desire to raise new fire,
Crocodiles and Bodkins here.
His Drollery Act, shows that his fact
deserves both the Gout
And Halter eke, that Bishop meek,
was never of that same Rout.
Poor Wild is civil, but Hudibrass Devil
is more then maudlin drunk;
His holy cheat does plead the feat
of Babylons base punck.
Our Judges Great, in the law complete,
sure never durst wrest the Act;
And though he is vexed, with a down right text,
Jack Pudding's here compact.
He ill does choose, for to abuse
both Miter and the Crown,
And make the law but like a straw,
if Hudibrasse pull it down.
For Hudibrasse Club and Beelzebub,
in malice both agree;
Since he is ingrate, then let his fate,
mount up on Hudibrasse Tree.
'Twill not be strange if then he change,
Rogero's Ink and Tune;
If he relent, and there repent,
he will fly above the Moon.
The furious Elf's against himself,
and all his black bravadoes;
His satyrd dregs are worse then Megs,
then Squibs, Jeers, or Grenades.
The tail o'th beast, not Smec the least,
some three years changed and horn;
Both Father and Mother* both Sister and brother
of Hudibrasse were the horn.
Our Temples mixed, with calves are fixed,
and Schismatics made by the Ass;
His legacy I wish it may be,
Repent O Hudibrasse.
Judges awake, Lord prelates make,
this son of Edom cry,
He Is half a Jew, a Calf and HuDebrasse
so let him die.
No Tyburne Hedge, nor Newgate Sledge,
I wish may be his Date;
Our Common Prayer that is so Rare,
may give him a better Fate.
Only a Letany, that runs so pleasantly,
I Will read to Hudibrasse Trim;
From a Coach and a Cart, and Death that limbs part,
Good Lord deliver him.
Let no man grumble, that thus I rumble,
in Hudibrasse language brave;
For to retort sometimes is good sport.
and so to play with a knave.
God bless our gracious King and Queen,
Bishops and Judges too;
Our glorious peace let never cease,
by Hudibrasse black Crew.
Our Parliament that shall be sent,
by Cbarles his Majesty:
Let settle Law to keep in awe,
Hudibrasse Fraternity.
And so I end as Hudibrasse Friend,
wishing both Church and State
A blessed peace in happiness,
and Enemies out of Date.
FINIS.
