The Loyal London Prentice: Being his Constant Resolution, to hazard his Life
and Fortune for his KING. With his Defiance to Popery and Faction.
I Will plainly make it to appear,
That I Am a True Born Cavaleir,
And here my Colors have Displayed,
Against all the Factious that Invade.
I wear this Ribbond in my Hatt,
For all the Whiggs to wonder at,
Let none then Tax my Loyalty,
My King I Will serve until I dye.
To a pleasant Old Tune, called, The Royal Rose.
To ye confusion of Rumpers!

O ye good old c^se.



I Am a True Born Cavaleir,
And so my Father was before,
I scorn your Factious Presbyter,
And hate the thoughts of Babels whore.
Then let us all together Sing,
And drink a health to Charles our King.
The Churches Right I will maintain,
As long as I have Life and Breath,
Established by Great Charles again,
That will I follow unto Death.
Then let us all, etc.
This Ribbond in my Hat I ware,
Is for to show my Loyalty,
It Is my Kings Colors that I bare,
And him I Will serve until I dye.
Then let us all, etc.
I Will leave Fanatics in the Lurch,
And Citizens that so Sedition,
I own the True Established Church,
And hate the damned screwed Precisian.
Then let us all, etc.
My Master he was one of they,
That use to Repeat long winded Grace,
And still at Night did go to Pray,
Against Scarlet Coats with Silver Lace.
Then let us all, etc.
To Lawn Sleeves he is a Mortal Foe,
And hates all those that go to Church,
He never could bring me to his Bow,
For I still left him in the Lurch.
Then let us all together Sing,
And drink a health to Charles our King.
He Would have me to their Meeting Rout,
But when his Book I there did bring,
I Would Steal away, being Devout,
To Pray for Charles our Gracious King.
Then let us all together Sing,
And drink a health to Charles our King.
Thus did I use to serve him often,
And never cared to stay at home,
When Codshead was for Codshead bought
Then I abroad did use to Roam.
Then let us all, etc.
And amongst a Crew of Loyal Boys,
Who always hate the Rebel Sect,
We there did Sing, and make a noise,
Trying to Drink us out of Debt.
Then let us all, etc.
Who ever takes it in disgrace,
That I this Loyal Favor ware,
I Will spit my Venom in his Face,
And for his Anger do not care.
Then let us all, etc.
I never yet did hide my Head,
From any Rascal of 'em all,
I Will serve my King till I am Dead,
The longest liver then take all.
Then let us all, etc.
So now my Merry Boys appears,
We Will cause the Bells for joy to Ring,
And show our selves true Cavaleirs,
Nay loose our lives for Charles our King.
Then let us all together Sing,
And drink a health to Charles our King.
For such a Gracious Prince this Land,
Since it was England never had,
Thn let him live, and long command,
And on his Foes for ever tread.
Whilst that we all together Sing,
And drink a health to Charles our King.
Hi^ lawful Heirs and Successors,
We will endeavor to Maintain,
And stand by them in Peace and Wars,
When he above with Christ does Reign.
Mean while lets all, etc.
Though Prentices in Forty One,
Did their Allegiance quite forget,
And by Tub-Preachers backed on,
Three Kingdoms in Confusion set.
But now will all, etc.
No Pope nor Prerbyter, shall shake
Our Loyalty, with all their Art,
We Will laugh to Shame, those undertake
To make us from Allegiance start.
And we will all, etc.
No Jesuit shall us surprise,
With all the Craft he can invent,
Nor Presbyter with turned up Eyes,
Our Loyalty shall e're prevent.
But we will all, etc.
Although the Factious do Repine
At this our Loyalty, yet still
To Rout the Rump we will combine,
And for great Charles our Blood we will spill.
Then let us all together Sing,
And drink a health to Charles our King.
