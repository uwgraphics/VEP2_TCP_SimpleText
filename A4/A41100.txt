THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT, WITH THE PROFESSION of the Faith of Humfrey Fen,
sometimes Pastor of one of the Churches of COVENTRY. But cast out by the High
Commission for laboring in a peaceable way the Reformation of our Discipline.

PRINTED, Anno Domini, MDCXLI.

I Profess with the Church of England the same doctrine of Faith and
Sacraments established in the first year of the reign of the renowned Queen
Elizabeth of blessed memory; of which doctrine according to the measure of the
grace of God I have been Preacher fifty and five years, though unworthy of
such a degree in the Faith of Jesus Christ my Lord God and Savior blessed for
ever.

Touching the Discipline of the Church, to hold that Doctors, Pastors, ruling
Elders and Deacons which is restored by the most reformed Charches, is to be
held Apostolical, universal, and unchangeable, and that the Churches of
England do sin against their Head and only Monarch, in violent opposition
thereof for the upholding ambitious pompes and worldly Prelacy, which being a
humane presumption at the first, being pretended for a remedy against Schism
(a cure more dangerous than the disease it self) made way for Antichrist, the
head of Papacy, with power, and now serves with us to hinder the Churches
edification, and to maintain a shameful Schism against all the reformed
Churches of the Gospel.

Touching ceremonies, I believe the Church has no authority to ordain any for
pomp or signification, but only for order and comeliness, and that
Ecclesiastical decrees therein do bind only in case of scandal and
contempt. But decrees for ceremonies of the other kinds are so far from
binding, that in defense of Christiall liberty they ought to be broken; I
therefore profess the Ceremonies in question with us unlawful, for that they
be teaching signs which in Gods worship he only may institute; or for that
originally they are superstitious, the same devised by Heretics and Antichrist
in his Idolatry to captive souls, and so prescribed it to be used in Gods
worship; or for that they do grace Popery and scandalize the weak, who for
their sakes conceive the better of Popery; or for that they give Papists
occasion to scorn our religion and profession who borrow their Ceremonies, and
grieve zealous Christians to see the Spouse of Christ forced to conform to the
strumpet of Rome, and to wear the tokens of her captivity, which no true Zeal
can digest with patience, neither can it stand with hearty repentance for
former straying from God; or for that they break the unity of brethren, spoil
the Church of faithful Pastors, stay many from the work of the Ministry, and
give advantage to profane persons, and Papists, to persecute true Professors,
and make the State guilty of the blood of the righteous, by wearing out their
spirits by many indignities not to be looked for at the hands of brethren; and
I do lament the ceremonial bondage of our Church, wherein Christian liberty
is inthralled with humane presumptions, which are exalted and enforced with
more Zeal than the holy Ordinances of God, and the rags of the whore of
Babylon enjoined the Spouse of Christ, to the scorn of all her sisters, the
Reformed Churches; who together with the doctrine of the man of sin have cast
out the Image of the Beast his Hierarchy, Archbishops, Suffragans, Deanes,
Bishops, Chancellors, Archdeacons, Commissaries, Officials, Prebends, with the
Canon Law, Spiritual Courts, dispensations for non-residents, that odious sin
restraint of marriage, without their dispensation (not much differing from the
doctrine of devils) with their oaths ex Officio, compurgatory censures,
commutations of penance, absolutions, consecrations, confirmations, together
with all their contrived ceremonies, to be the filthy remainder of unclean
Beasts, so do I humbly desire the Lord to purge and cleanse his Church thereof
at the length; and as I my self for the space of fifty five years, according
to my weak ability, opposed those corruptions, and by prayer, supplication,
conference and suffering, endeavored in a Christian peaceable manner the
sincere reformation thereof, so do I earnestly exhort by the like Christian
means, all that fear God, love the peace of Jerusalem, and desire the crown
of vanquishers, according to your calling, to do the like; and as these times
do require of those that love the Lord Jesus, an open profession of this
cause, wherein Christ is persecuted in many of his members, so they would not
be wanting in this duty at this time, wherein through the defection of many,
others think the cause forsaken; yet do I not hold it lawful for these
corruptions to separate from the communion of the Church of England, if therein
a Christian may enjoy true doctrine with the Sacraments, from a Minister able
to teach the truth, and where in the worship of God he is not forced by a
personal act to approve of those corruptions.

Touching the civil Magestrate, I acknowledge our dread sovereign King
Charles is supreme governor over all persons in his Dominions, by civil power
to suppress all false worship, to compel all to the means of faith and
knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, to force all
Ecclesiastical Ministers to a faithful execution of the duties of their place
enjoined by our blessed Savior, and to reform the remaining corruptions in
the discipline, service and ceremonies of the Church, according to the order of
Gods word; and though I hold him subject to all the ordinances of Christ in his
Church, serving to the salvation of men, yet do I deny him to be subject to
any person, foreign or domestical touching his life, liberty, crown or
dignity, or to any other foreign or domestical censure by whomsoever
executed.

This confession I set down under mine hand, as my last act in this kind, as a
fruit of mine age, which is eighty seven years, and brought out in a serious
meditation of my appearing shortly before the judge of all flesh, who only
knows my heart, and to whom only I shall stand or fall; his judgments I
fear, and do humbly crave pardon for all mine infirmities in this profession,
as for all my other sins, but as touching the substance of this profession, as
I know assuredly, so I appeal to his all seeing spirit, whether I have in
hypocisie, contrary to the full persuasion of my heart, lived so long therein,
endeavored so much for it, and now am ready to die therein; Let this suffice to
stop the mouths of slanderers, who incroaching upon the office of God, cry out
of men's hypocrisy, who being (as they say) convinced in their consciences, do
yet for sinister respects, continue the profession of the cause, as an
Archprelate openly traduced as honest a man as himself, in the High Commission
Court, not long since, whereas also he cast out many unsavory speeches and
reproaches, unbeseeming a man of God and chief Father of Pastors (as forsooth
he would be taken to be) and unworthy so many well deserving Preachers of the
Gospel, whose right hand of Fellowship himself would not have scorned while
King James stood indifferent in the cause; be it therefore that King James have
forsaken this cause, which had his first love under his hand, witnessed by many
works, and namely by interceding for Mr. Thomas Cartwright, and others,
imprisoned for this cause through the false suggestions of ambitious men, who
(fearing to lose the fat morsels of their large rewards) abused the state by
untrue surmises, which they were never able to make good; And be it since that
show of a dispute in the cause at Hampton Court, wherein men were purposely
chosen to undertake our cause, who (excepting one reverend Father) never took
the cause to heart, as men that pesent themselves in an act upon a Stage; be it
(I say) rhat ever since that time our cause has lost many lovers by death,
many famous Ministers and others by defection, yet the cause is the same it
was, when it was esteemed holy by the best professors that were; when it was
embraced by so many reformed Churches, and as it was in the judgment of so
many reverend men which ever have approved it, for all the violent and unkind
opposition made thereto; and as the cause remains the same it was, so I thank
my God that by his grace I affect it no whit the less, but am assured it is a
truth of God, wherein after fifty five years labor in the Ministry of the
Gospel, after much reading what has been written on both sides, after many
conferences with worthy brethren of indifferent judgment, after many prayers
to the Father of lights; lastly, upon advised deliberation and consideration of
the effects that have ensued the persecutions, I gladly end my days, and with
joy do bear it in my bosom into the presence of God, and do hope, and in my
best prayers do beseech him to raise up daily faithful men to contend for the
truth of God against all gainsayers.

Humfrey Fen departed this life in, or about September, 1634.

FINIS.
