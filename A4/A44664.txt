To the KING's Most Excellent Majesty.
The Humble Petition of William Lord Howard of Escrick, now Prisoner in the
Tower;
SHOWS,
THat as it cannot but be matter of great Mortification to him, that his Honor
should be blemished with the Imputation of so horrid and detestable a Crime, as
that is for which he stands committed to this Place; so it is no less matter of
Rejoicing and Triumph to him, that it has pleased the Righteous God to rescue
his Innocence from the Villainous Attempts and Practices of those lewd and
infamous Persons, who, by the division of their Tongues, and the apparent
contradiction of their Evidence, did render themselves much stronger Witnesses
against themselves, than against him, upon whose Life and Honor they have made
so impudent and audacious an Assault, as has founded a loud Alarm to all
Mankind, and has justly filled the whole Kingdom with Horror and Amazement, to
hear that Perjury and Subornation should show its Face upon the Public Theater
of Justice.

In humble confidence therefore that the Report thereof has, by this time,
begot in Your Majesty's Royal Breast softer and gentler Thoughts concerning
Your Petitioner, whose Innocence God has made to shine through that black Cloud
with which Malice has sought to darken it, he does in all humility pray, That
Your Majesty would be graciously pleased to discharge him of this Imprisonment,
either with or without Bail, as Your Majesty, in Your great Justice and Wisdom,
shall think fit.
