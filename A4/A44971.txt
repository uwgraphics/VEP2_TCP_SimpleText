AN HUMBLE ADVICE TO His Sacred Majesty, Anent the Drawing of LONDONS CHARTER.
By a SCOTTISH Pen.
DRead SIR, You still was Good, but now most Great;
Ye now do Reign in Majesty and State:
Your unsheathed Sword of Justice has done more,
Than all the Kings of England did before,
By Strength, and force of Arms; Yea, it is strange,
There Is not a drop of Blood spilt in this Change:
A Wonder SIR, like to Your coming Home,
To see R^bellion Buried in it is Tomb;
Which lately Roared and Raged in every Bench,
In Street, in Coffee-house: then let the French,
And other Monarchs, Vail their Capes to Thee,
Who Rules by Laws, and not by Tirranie:
But since they thus, are at YOUR Royal Feet,
Crying Peccavi, and humbly do Entreat
Your Grace and Favor, Pray You take Advice,
Compose their CHARTER, as the Heavens do Ice,
To last no longer then it is Your Pleasure.
Clip YOU their Wings, not they the VVings of Caesar:
And left that they, and their Pesteritie,
Turn wanton, and abuse YOUR Clemency;
Let that their CHARTER, bear this special Clause,
That these who slight Authority, or Laws;
Or vent Seditious words, may breed mischief,
Shall never taste Bag-pudden, nor Rost-bief,
Nor Pig, nor Pork, nor Powthered-bief and Cabbage,
But Brownest-bread, Boyl'd-beans, and such like Baggage
And that but once a Day, to save their Life; Conform to Hen 8. Statute.

This is the way to keep them free of Strife:
And since their Patience was Impertinent,
Let Patience be their sole Medicament.
FINIS.
Edinburgh, Printed by the Heir of Andrew Anderson, Printer to His most Sa cred
Majesty, Anno DOM 1683.
