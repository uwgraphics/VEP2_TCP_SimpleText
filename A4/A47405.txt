AN ELEGY Upon the most INCOMPARABLE K. Charles the I. Persecuted by two
Implacable FACTIONS, Imprisoned by the One, And Murdered by the Other, January
30th 1648.

AN ELEGY Upon the most Incomparable K. CHARLES the First.
CAll for amazed thoughts, a wounded sense
And bleeding Hearts at our Intelligence.
Call for that Trump of Death the Mandrakes Groan
Which kills the Hearers: This befits alone
Our Story which through times vast Calendar
Must stand without Example or Repair.
What spowts of melting Clouds what endless springs
Powered in the Oceans lapp for offerings
Shall feed the hungry torrent of our grief
Too mighty for expression or belief?
Though all those moistures which the brain attracts
Ran from our eyes like gushing Cataracts,
Or our sad accents could out-tongue the Cries
Which did from mournful Hadadrimmon rise
Since that remembrance of Josiah slain
In our King's murder is revived again.
O pardon me that but from Holy Writ
Our loss allows no Parallel to it:
Nor call it bold presumption that I dare
Charles with the best of Judah's Kings compare:
The virtues of whose life did I prefer
The Text acquits me for no Flatterer.
For He like David perfect in his trust,
Was never stayn'd like Him, with Blood or Lust.
One who with Solomon in Judgment tried,
Was quick to comprehend, Wise to decide,
(That even his Judges stood amazed to hear*
A more transcendent Moover in their Sphere)
Though more Religious: for when doting Love
A while made Solomon Apostate prove
Charles never endured the Truth which he professed
To be unfixt by Bosom interest.
Bold as Jehosaphat, yet forced to Fight,
And for his own, no unconcerned Right.
Should I recount His constant time of Prayer
Each rising Morn and Evening Regular
You Would say his practice preached They ought not Eat
Who by devotion first not earned their Meat.
Thus Hezekiah He exceeds in Zeal,
Though not (like him) So facile to reveal
The Treasures of Gods House, or His own Heart
To be supplanted by some foreign art.
And that he might in fame with Joash share
When he the ruined Temple did repair,
His cost on Paul's late ragged Fabric spent
Must (if no other) be His Monument.
From this Survey the Kingdom may conclude
His Merits, and her Losses Magnitude.
Nor think he flatters or blasphemes, who tells
That Charles exceeds Judea's Parallels,
In whom all Virtues we concentred see
Which amongst the best of them divided be. -- Sparguntur in omnes

O weak built Glories! In te mista fluunt -- Claudian.
which those Tempests feel
To force you from your firmest bases reel,
What from the strokes of Chance shall you secure,
When Rocks of Innocence are so unsure?
When the World's only mirror slaughtered lies,
Envies and Treasons bleeding sacrifize?
As if His stock of Goodness could become
No Calendar, but that of Martyrdom.
See now ye cursed Mountebanks of State,
Who have Eight years for Reformation sat;
You who dire Alva's Counsels did transfer
To Act his Scenes on England's Theater; Called the Council of Troubles.

You who did pawn your Selves in Public Faith
To slave the Kingdom by your Pride and Wrath;
Call the whole World to witness now, how just,
How well you are responsive to your trust,
How to your King the promise you perform,
With Fasts, and Sermons, and long Prayers sworn,
That you intended Peace and Truth to bring
To make your Charles Europes most Glorious King.
Did you for this Lift up your Hands on high, The form of taking the Covenant,
June 1643.

To Kill the King, and pluck down Monarchy?
These are the Fruits by your vvild Faction sown,
Which not Imputed are, but Born your own.
For though you wisely seem to wash your Hands,
The Guilt on every Vote and Order stands.
So that convinced from all you did before,
Justice must lay the Murder at your Door.
Mark if the Body does not Bleed anew,
In any Circumstance approached by You,
From whose each motion we might plain descry
The black Ostents of this late Tragedy.
For when the King through Storms in Scotland bred
To his Great Council for his shelter fled,
When in that meeting every Error gained
Redresses sooner granted, than Complained:
Not all those frank Concessions or Amends
Did suit the then too Powerful Paction's ends,
No Acts of Grace at prefent would Content,
Nor Promise of Triennial Parl'ament,
Till by a formal Law the King had past
This Session should at Your pleasure last.
So having got the Bitt, and that 'twas known
No power could dissolve You but Your own,
Your graceless Junto make such use of this,
As once was practiced by Semiramis; Diodorus Siculus lib. 2.

Who striving by a subtle Suit to prove
The largeness of her Husbands Trust and Love,
Did from the much abused King obtain
That for three days She might sole Empress reign:
Before which time expired, the bloody Wife
Deprived her Lord both of his Crown and Life.
There needs no Comment when your deeds apply
The Demonstration of her Treachery.
Which to effect by Absolon's foul wile
You of the Peoples Heart your Prince beguile;
Urging what Eases they might reap by it
Did you their Legislative Judges sit.
How did you fawn upon, and Court the Rout,
Whose Clamor carried your whole Plot about?
How did you thank Seditious men that came
To bring Petitions which your selves did frame?
And lest they wanted Hands to set them on,
You lead the way by throwing the first stone.
For in that Libel after Midnight born,
Wherewith your Faction labored till the Morn,
That famous Lie, Remonstrance of the State of the Kingdom Dec. 15. 1641.
you a Remonstrance name;
Were not Reproaches your malicious aim?
Was not the King's dishonor your intent
By Slanders to traduce his Government?
All which your spightful Cunning did contrive
Men must receive through your false Perspective,
In which the smallest Spots improved were,
And every Mote a Mountain did appear.
Thus Caesar by the ungrateful Senate found
His Life assaulted through his Honor's Wound.
And now to make Him hopeless to resist,
You guide His Sword by Vote, which as you list
Must Strike or Spare (for so you did enforce
His Hand against His Reason to divorce
Brave Strafford's Life) then wring it quite away
By your usurping Each Militia: Ord. Feb. 29.

Then seize His M^gazines, Voted March 15 The Navy seized Mar. 28. 1642.
of which possessed
You turn the Weapons against their Master's Breast.
This done, the unkennell'd crew of Lawless men
Led down by Watkins, Pennington, and Ven,
Did with confused noise the Court invade; The London Tumults. Jan. 10. 1641.

Then all Dissenters in Both Houses Bay'd.
At which the King amazed is forced to fly,
The whilst your Mouth's laid on maintain the Cry.
The Royal Game dislodged and under Chase,
Your hot Pursuit dogs Him from place to place:
Not Saul with greater fury or disdain
Did flying David from Jeshimon's plain
Unto the barren Wilderness pursue,
Than Cours'd and Hunted is the King by you.
The Mountain Partridge or the Chased Roe
Might now for Emblemes of His Fortune go.
And since all other May-games of the Town
(Save those your selves should make) were Voted down,
The Clamorous Pulpit Holla^s in resort,
Inviting men to your King-catching Sport.
Where as the Foyl grow cold you mend the Sent
By crying Privilege of Parliament,
Whose fair Pretensions the first sparkles are,
Which by your breath blown up inflame the War,
And Ireland (bleeding by design) the Stale
Wherewith for Men and Money you prevail.
Yet doubting that Imposture could not last,
When all the Kingdoms Mines of Treasure waste,
You now tear down Religion's sacred Hedge
To carry on the Work by Sacrilege;
Reputing it Rebellions fittest Pay
To take both God's and Cesar's dues away.
The tenor of which execrable Vote
Your over-active Zelots so promote,
That neither ^omb nor Temple could escape,
Nor Dead nor Living your Licentious Rape.
Statues and Grave-stones over men buried
Robbed of their Brass, the At Basing-Chapel Sold Dec. 29. 1643.
Coffins of their Led;
Not the Seventh Henry's gilt and curious Skreen,
Nor those which amongst our Rarities were seen,
The At Winchester.
Chests wherein the Saxon Monarchs lay,
But must be basely sold or thrown away.
May in succeeding times forgotten be
Those bold Examples of Impiety,
Which were the Ages wonder and discourse,
You have Their greatest ills improved by worse.
No more be mentioned Dionysius Theft, L^^^ant. l. 2. c 4.

Who of their Gold the Heathen Shrines bereft;
For who with Yours His Robberies confer,
Must him repute a petty Pilferer. Julian. Praefectus Aegypti.

Nor Julian's Scoff, who when he viewed the State
Of Antioch's Church, the Ornaments and Plate, Theodoret. l. 3. c. 11.

Cried, Meaner Vessels would serve turn, or None
Might well become the birth of Mary's Son
Nor how that spightfull Atheist did in scorn
Piss on God's Table, ibid.
which so often had born
The hallowed Elements his death present:
Nor he that fould it with his Excrement, Ganguin. l. 6.

Then turned the Cloth unto that act of shame,
Which without trembling Christians should not name.
Nor John of Leyden, who the pillaged Quires
Employed in Munster for his own attires;
His pranks by Hazlerig exceeded be,
A wretch more wicked and as mad as he,
Who once in triumph led his Sumpter Moil
Proudly bedecked with the Altar's spoil. The Carpet belonging to the Communion
Table of Winchester Cathedral Dec. 18. 1642. Adrian Emp.

Nor at Bizantium's sack how Mahomet
In St. Sophia's Church his Horses set.
Nor how Belshazzar at his drunken Feasts
Carows'd in holy Vessels to his Guests:
Nor he that did the Books and Anthems tear,
Which in the daily Stations used were.
These were poor Essays of imperfect Crimes,
Fit for beginners in unlearned times,
Sized only for that dull Meridian
Which knew no Jesuit nor Puritan,
(Before whose fatal Birth were no such things
As Doctrines to Depose and Murder Kings.)
But since Your prudent care Enacted well,
That there should be no King in Israel,
England must write such Annals of Your Reign
Which all Records of elder mischiefs stain.
Churches unbuilt by order, others burned;
Whilst Paul's and Lincoln are to Stables turned;
And at God's Table you might Horses see
By (those more Beasts) their Riders manger'd be.
Some Kitchins and some Slaughter-houses made, At Winchcomb in Gloucestershire.

Communion-boards and Cloths for Dressers laid:
Some turned to loathsome Gaols, so by you brought
Unto the Curse of Baal's House, a Draught.
The Common Prayers with the Bibles torn,
The Coaps in Antic Moorish-Dances worn,
And sometimes for the wearers greater mock,
The Surplice is converted to a Frock.
Some bringing Dogs the Sacrament revile,
Some with Copronimus the Font defile.
O God! can Thou these prophanations like?
If not, why is thy Thunder slow to strike
The cursed Authors? who dare think that Thou
Do, when not punish them, their acts allow.
All which outrageous Crimes, though your pretense
Would fasten on the Soldiers insolence,
We must believe that what by them was done
Came licensed forth by your probation.
For, as your selves with Athaliah's Brood
In strong contention for precedence stood,
You robbed Two Royal Chapels of their Plate, Whitehal Windsor.

Which Kings and Queens to God did dedicate;
Then by a Vote more sordid than the Stealth, Feb. 3. 1643.

Melt down and Coin it for the Commonwealth;
That is, give't up to the devouring jaws
Of your great Idol Bell, new styled The Cause.
And though this Monster you did well devise
To feed by Plunder, Taxes, Loans, Excise;
(All which Provisions You the People tell
Scarce serve to diet Your Pantagruel.)
We no strewn Ashes need to trace the Cheat,
Who plainly see what Mouths the Messes eat.
Brave Reformation! and a through one too,
Which to enrich Your selves must All undo.
Pray tell us (those that can) What fruits have grown
From all Your Seeds in Blood and Treasure sown?
What would you mend? when Your Projected State
Does from the Best in Form degenerate?
Or why should You (of All) attempt the Cure,
Whose Facts nor Gospels Test nor Laws endure?
But like unwholesome Exhalations met
From Your Conjunction only Plagues beget,
And in Your Circle, as Imposthumes fill
Which by their venom the whole Body kill;
For never had You Power but to Destroy,
Nor Will, but where You Conquered to Enjoy.
This was Your Master-prize, who did intend
To make both Churhch and Kingdom's prey Your End.
Against which the King (placed in the Gap) did strive
By His (till then unquestioned) Negative,
Which finding You lacked Reason to persuade,
Your Arguments are into Weapons made;
So to compel him by main force to yield,
You had a Formed Army in the Field
Before his Reared Standard could invite
Ten men upon his Righteous Cause to fight. E of Essex Army Aug. 1. 1642.

Yet ere those raised Forces did advance, The Standard at Notingham Aug 25.
1642.

Your malice struck him dead by Ordinance,
When your Commissions the whole Kingdom swept
With Blood and Slaughter, Not the King Except.
Now hardened in Revolt, You next proceed
By Pacts to strengthen each Rebellious Deed,
New Oaths, June 27. 1643.
and Vows, and Covenants advance,
All contradicting your Allegiance,
Whose Sacred knot you plainly did unty,
When you with Essex swore to Live and Die. Declaration and Resolution of Parl.
Aug. 15. 1642.

These were your Calves in Bethel and in Dan,
Which Jeroboam's Treason stablish can,
Who by strange Pacts and Altars did seduce
The People to their Laws and and King's abuse;
All which but serve like S^ibboleth to try
Those who pronounced not your Conspiracy;
That when your other Trains defective are,
Forced Oaths might bring Refusers to the Snare.
And lest those men your Counsels did pervert,
Might when your Fraud was seen the Cause desert,
A fierce Decree is through the Kingdom sent,
Which made it Death for any to Repent.
What strange Dilemmaes does Rebellion make?
It Is mortal to Deny, or to Partake:
Some Hang who would not aid your Traitorous Act,
Others engaged are Hanged if they Retract. History of English and Scottish
Presbytery p. 320.

So Witches who their Contracts have unsworn,
By their own Devils are in pieces torn.
Thus still the rageing Tempest higher grows,
Which in Extremes the Kings Resolvings throws.
The face of Ruin every where appears,
And Acts of Outrage multiply our fears;
Whilst blind Ambition by Successes fed
Has You beyond the bound of Subjects led,
Who tasting once the sweet of Regal Sway,
Resolved now no longer to obey.
For Presbyterian pride contests as high
As does the Popedom for Supremacy.
Needs must you with unskilful Phaeton
Aspire to guide the Chariot of the Sun,
Though your ill-govern'd height with lightning be
Thrown headlong from his burning Axle-tree.
You will no more Petition or Debate, The 19 Propos.

But your desire in Propositions state,
Which by such Rules and Ties the King confine,
They in effect are Summons to Resign.
Therefore your War is managed with such slight,
'Twas seen you more prevailed by Purse than Might;
And those you could not purchase to your will,
You bribed with sums of money to sit still.
The King by this time hopeless here of Peace,
Or to procure His wasted Peoples ease,
Which He in frequent Messages had tried,
By you as often as shamelesly denied;
Wearied by faithless Friends and restless Foes,
To certain hazard does His Life Expose:
When through your Quarters in a mean disguise
He to His Countrymen for succor flies, April 27. 1646.

Who met a brave occasion then to save
Their Native King from His untimely Grave: May 5. 1646.

Had he from them such fair reception gained,
Wherewith even Achish David entertained.
But Faith to Him or hospitable Laws
In your Confederate Union were no Clause,
Which back to you their Rendered Master sends
To tell how He was used among his friends.
Far be it from my thoughts by this black Line
To measure all within that Warlick Clime;
The still admired Montross some Numbers lead
In his brave steps of Loyalty to tread.
I only tax a furious Party There,
Who with our Native Pests Enleagued were.
Then 'twas you followed Him with Hue and Cry,
Made Midnight Searches in Each Liberty,
Voting it death to all without Reprieve, This Order published by beat of Drum
May 4. 1646.

Who should their Master Harbor or Relieve.
Even in pure pity of both Nations Fame,
I wish that Act in Story had no name.
When all your Mutual Stipulations are
Converted at Newcastle to a Fair,
Where (like His Lord) the King the Mart is made,
Bought with Your Money, and by Them Betrayed;
For both are guilty, They that did Contract,
And You that did the fatal Bargain Act.
Which who by equal Reason shall peruse,
Must yet conclude, They had the best Excuse:
For doubtless They (Good men) had never sold,
But that you tempted Them with English Gold;
And it is no wonder if with such a Sum
Our Brethrens frailty might be overcome.
What though hereafter it may prove Their Lot
To be compared with Iscariot?
Yet will the World perceive which was most wise,
And who the Nobler Traitor by the Price;
For though it is true Both did Themselves undo,
They made the better Bargain of the Two,
Which all may reckon who can difference
Two hundred thousand Pounds from Thirty Pence.
However something is in Justice due,
Which may be spoken in defense of You;
For in your Masters Purchase you gave more,
Than all your Jewish kindred paid before.
And had you wisely used what then you bought,
Your Act might be a Loyal Ransom thought,
To free from Bonds your Captive Soverain,
Restoring Him to his lost Crown again.
But You had other plots, your busy hate
Plied all advantage on His fallen State,
And showed You did not come to bring Him Bayl,
But to remove Him to a stricter Gaol,
To Holmby first, whence taken from His Bed,
He by an Army was in triumph led;
Till on pretense of safety Cromwell's wile
Had juggel'd Him into the Fatal Isle,
Where Hammond for his Jailer is decreed,
And Murderous Rolf as Lieger-Hangman fee'd,
Who in one fatal Knot Two Counsels tie,
He must by Poison or by Pistol Die.
Here now denied all Comforts due to Life,
His Friends, His Children, and His Peerlesse Wife;
From Carisbrook He often but vainly sends,
And though first Wronged, seeks to make you Amends;
For this He sues, and by His restless Pen
Importunes Your deaf Ears to Treat again.
Whilst the proud Faction scorning to go less,
Return those Traitorous Votes of Non Address, Jan. 3. 1647.

Which followed were by the Armies thundering
To Act without and quite against the King. Jan. 9. 1647.

Yet when that Clowd removed, and the clear Light,
Drawn from His weighty Reasons, gave You sight
Of Your own dangers, had not Their Intents
Retarded been by some cross Accidents; Colchester Siege.

Which for a while with fortunate Suspense
Checked or diverted Their swollen Insolence:
When the whole Kingdom for a Treaty cried,
Which gave such credit to Your falling side,
That you Recalled those Votes, Jun. 30. 1648..
and God once more
Your Power to save the Kingdom did restore,
Remember how Your peevish Treators sat, Treaty Voted July 28. 1648.

Not to make Peace, but to prolong Debate;
How You that precious time at first delayed,
And what ill use of your advantage made,
As if from Your foul hands God had decreed
Nothing but War and Mischief should succeed.
For when by easy Grants the Kings Assent
Did your desires in greater things prevent,
When He did yield faster than You entreat,
And more than Modesty dares well repeat;
Yet not content with this, without all sense,
Or of His Honor or His Conscience,
Still you pressed on, till you too late descried,
'Twas now less safe to stay than be denied.
For like a Flood broke loose the Armed Rout,
Then Shut Him closer up, And Shut You out,
Who by just vengeance are since Worryed
By those Hand-wolves You for His Ruin bred.
Thus like Two smoking Firebrands, You and They
Have in this Smother choked the Kingdom's Day.
And as you raised Them first, must share the Guilt,
With all the Blood in these Distractions spilt.
For though with Sampson's Foxes backward turned,
(When he Philistia's fruitful Harvest burned)
The face of your opinions stands averse,
All your Conclusions but one fire disperse;
And every Line which carries your Designs,
In the same Center of Confusion joins.
Though then the Independents end the Work,
It Is known they took their Platform from the Kirk;
Though Pilate Bradshaw with his pack of Jews
God's High Vicegerent at the Bar accuse,
They but revived the Evidence and Charge
Your poisonous Declarations laid at large;
Though they condemned or made his Life their Spoil,
You were the Setters forced him to the Toil:
For you whose fatal hand the Warrant writ,
The Prisoner did for Execution fit.
And if their Ax invade the Regal Throat,
Remember you first murdered Him by Vote.
Thus They receive Your Tennis at the bound,
Take off that Head which you had first Un-crown'd;
Which shows the Texture of our Mischiefs Clew,
If ravel'd to the Top, begins in You,
Who have for ever stained the brave Intents
And Credit of our English Parliaments:
And in this One caused greater Ills, and more,
Than all of theirs did Good that went before.
Yet have you kept your word against Your will,
Your King is Great indeed and Glorious still,
And you have made Him so. We must impute
That Luster which His Sufferings contribute
To your preposterous Wisdoms, who have done
All your good Deeds by Contradiction:
For as to work His Peace you raised this Strife,
And often Shot at Him to Save His Life;
As you took from Him to Increase His wealth,
And kept Him Prisoner to secure His Health:
So in revenge of your dissembled Spite,
In this last Wrong you did Him greatest Right,
And (cross to all you meant) by Plucking down
Lifted Him up to His Eternal Crown.
With This encircled in that radiant Sphere,
Where Thy black Murderers must never appear,
Thou from th 'enthroned Martyrs Blood-stained Line,
Do in thy Virtues bright Example shine.
And when Thy darted Beam from the moist Sky
Nightly salutes Thy grieving Peoples Eye,
Thou like some Warning Light raised by our fears,
Shall both provoke and still supply our Tears:
Til the Great Prophet waked from his long sleep
Again bids Sion for Josiah weep:
That all Successions by a firm Decree
May t^ach Their Children to lament for Thee.
Beyond these mournful Rites there is no Art
Or (...) Thee preserve. Thy better Part
Lives in despite of Death, and will endure
Kept safe in Thy unpattern'd Portraicture:
Which though in Paper drawn by thine own Hand,
Shall longer than Corinthian-Marble stand,
Or Iron Sculptures: There Thy matchless Pen
Speaks Thee the BEST OF KINGS as BEST OF MEN:
Be this Thy Epitaph: for This alone
Deserves to carry Thy Inscription.
And it is but modest Truth: (so may I thrive
As not to please the Best of Thine Alive,
Or flatter my dead Master, here would I
Pay my last Duty in a Glorious Ly)
In that Admired Piece the world may read
Thy Virtues and Misfortunes Storied;
Which bear such curious Mixture, men must doubt
Whether Thou Wiser were or more Devout.
There live Blessed Relick of a Saint-like mind,
With Honors endless, as Thy Peace Enshrined.
Whilst we, divided by that Bloody Clowd,
Whose purple Mists Thy Murdered Body shroud,
Here stay behind at gaze: Apt for Thy sake
Unruly murmurs now against Heaven to make,
Which binds us to Live well, yet gives no Fense
To guard her dearest Sons from Violence.
But He whose Trump proclaims, Revenge is Mine,
Bids us our Sorrow by our Hope confine,
And reconcile our Reason to our Faith,
Which in Thy Ruin such Concussions has,
It dares Conclude, God does not keep His Word
If Zimri die in Peace that slew his Lord.
From my sad Retirement March 11. 1648.
CAROLVS STVART REX ANGLIAE SECVRE COESVS VITA CESSIT TRICESSIMO IANVARII.
