Fleet Mayor. seal
J^vis Primo die Decembr', 1692; Annoque Regni Regis and Reginae, WILLIELMI and
MARIAE, Angl', etc. Quarto.
THis COURT this Day taking Notice, That diverse Tradesmen and Others have taken
upon them an Evil Practice upon the Public Exchange, and elsewhere within the
City and Liberties thereof, To foretell and raise Suspicions of Evil Success to
Their MAJESTY'S in the War against France; And thereupon to Lay Wagers, and
draw Policies upon the Events of Besieging Forts and Cities, and other the
Successes of War; And by their false and scandalous Insinuations endeavor to
Discourage Their MAJESTY'S Subjects in their due Allegiance: For prevention
whereof for the Future, and for the better Government of this City in that
behalf for Time to come, This Court does think it necessary to Publish and
Declare, and do hereby Publish and Declare, That all such Wagers, Policies and
Practices, are highly to the Prejudice of Their MAJESTY'S and of Their Allies,
and to the good Government of this City, and tend to the ill Ends aforesaid:
And therefore do Admonish all persons whatsoever, within this City and the
Liberties thereof, That for the Future they do not presume to Lay any such
Wagers, nor Draw, Expose, or Enter into any such Policies: And does Order,
That no Breker, Clerk of Insurance, or other person whatsoever, upon the
Exchange, or elsewhere within this City or the Liberties thereof, do Lay any
such Wager, or make or solicit any such Wager or Policy of Insurance, as they
will Answer the same under the utmost Penalties of the Laws.

Goodfellow.
