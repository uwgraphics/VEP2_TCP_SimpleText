IGNORAMUS-Justice: OR, The ENGLISH-LAWS turned into a GIN, To let KNAVES Out,
and keep HONEST MEN In. An Excellent New SONG.
To the Tune of, Sir Egledemore.
[1]
DId you not hear of a Peer that was Tried?
With a fa, la, la, la, la.
That looks like a Cask with a Tap in his side;
With a fa, la, la, la, la.
This Noble Peer to the Bar was called;
The Witnesses swore, but the Foreman out-baul'd;
With a fa, la, la, la, la.
[2]
Then up Sir Samuel did start;
Wit a fa, la, etc.
And found the Bill not worth a F^;
With a fa, la, etc.
With that the Court kept such a stir,
The Foreman should prove so silly a Sir,
With a fa la, etc.
[3]
The Witnesses for the King swore plain;
With a fa, la, etc.
But had they been so many again;
With a fa la, etc.
The Jury before such Truths received,
Nor them, nor St. Peter they would have believed;
With a fa la, etc.
[4]
The Witnesses brought him a Traitor in;
With a fa, la.
But the Jury found it another thing;
With a fa, la, etc.
For he who did still his King oppose,
Is made a True Subject in spite of the Laws;
With a fa, la, etc.
[5]
Thus this Great Lord of High Renown;
With a fa, la, etc.
The Exalted Idol of the Town;
With a fa, la, etc.
Is cleared by Ignoramus-sway,
For B^traying the Church and the King in a day;
With a fa, la, etc.
[6]
The Rabble to show their Loyalty;
With a fa, la, etc.
Did in full shouts with the Jury agree;
With a fa, la, etc.
They Bonfires made, with great Applause,
And all to maintain the Good Old Cause;
With a fa, la, etc.
[7]
And now in spite of King and Queen;
With a fa, la, etc.
More Jollity was in the Streets to be seen;
With a fa, la, etc.
Th^n on the Twenty Ninth of May.
Though it was the Restauration-day;
With a fa, la, etc.
[8]
Another passage I chanced to hear;
With a fa, la, etc.
That the Dr. is fallen from the Front to the Rear^
With a fa, la, etc.
He to the Saints does now incline,
Abjures the King, and with Rebels Combine;
With a fa, la, etc.
[9]
Yet these pretend for to Inherit;
With a fa, la, etc.
(As Heirs do Estates) the Light of the Spirit;
With a fa, la, etc.
Yet let them say or do what they will,
They Will find themselves Ignoramus still;
With a fa, la, etc.
[10]
But had it been a Popish Lord;
With a fa, la, etc.
One Witness then had served in a word;
With a fa, la, etc.
They had not then inquired so far;
But found it, and never have stepped from the Bar:
With a fa, la, etc.
[11]
If by this Law the Charter be lost;
With a fa, la, etc.
Will Tony's Estate repay the Cost?
With a fa, la, etc.
The Boys will then find out the Cheat,
And De Wit the old Canibal in his Retreat;
With a fa, la, etc.
[12]
They Will Curse that Pate that studied to bring;
With a fa, la, etc.
Plague to the Country, and Ruin to the King;
With a fa, la, etc.
Divested thus of ' Chitophel's Pride,
They Will do him that Justice which Juries denied;
With a fa, la, etc.
