THE MEASVRING ROD OF THE LORD, Stretched forth over all Nations, and the Line
of true judgment laid to the Rulers thereof;

Wherein all Governors and Rulers, Potentates and Powers are measured; and all
Governments and Laws weighed in the true weight; wherein they all may see how
far they are degenerated from the Law of Righteousness, and the Rules of
Wisdom, which was in the beginning, before Tyranny, and Persecution, and
Rebellion had showed it self;

Also showing the end that will come upon all those Rulers and Governments,
Rules and Laws that have been made in the Apostasy, which is to be all
overthrown, and all that which is acted out of Gods power, to be thrown down by
him, unto whom all Power is committed.

Showing also that they in whom the power of God is made manifest, cannot be
subject to any Usurper, or to that power which is gone from the life of God.

Also an Advertisement to all the Rulers upon the Earth, that they may wait for
the Restorer to be revealed in the Nations, to make up the Breaches, and to
crush that down which has made the Breach, that so Righteousness may cover the
Earth, and gladness of heart may possess the People.

the Lord and his Christ, that he alone may rule for ever and ever, called

The measuring rod of the Lord streched forth etc.
LIsten oh World, hearken oh Earth, and all the Inhabitants thereof, give ear,
oh all Nations that are therein, and all the Isles thereof, draw near ye
Potentates thereof, ye* Emperors, Kings, Earls, Dukes, Nobles,
Princ^pallities, and Dominions, my mouth shall speak the thing that is right,
and my lips shall utter forth understanding, my toungue shall declare unto you
the Counsel of the most high, and what he is bringing to pass in the latter
days, he that is higher than the highest has said, he that is greater than
the greatest has spoken, the whole World lies in wickedness, and thick
darkness is over the World, his way is perverted, his Counsel is despised, and
all Nations is out of order, notwithstanding the multitude of their
Counselors, and notwithstanding all their wisdom, yet folly is brought forth
in the midst of the Nations.

Because they have asked Counsel and not at the Lord, and taken advice and not
at the holy One, therefore violence is set up as an Ensign, and wickedness
runs down as a river, and cruelty and opression as a mighty stream, the
whole Earth is full of folly and madness, and all the people thereof are
degenerate and grown out of the Image of God into a monstrous and strange
nature, the prophets are all fools, the diviners thereof are mad, and they
being degenerate themselves from the life of God, have not turned the people
from their iniquity, but has led them into further blindness, darkness,
ignorance, and deceit, and has made the Word of truth of none effect through
their traditions, and has taught for doctrine the precepts of men, and the
traditions of them who are out of the Faith, and out of the life, and out of
the power of God, and the Counselors they have established wickedness by a
law, they themselves being stranged from the life of God, therefore violence is
broken forth into the earth as a flood, and now all Kings, Rulers, Potentates
of the Earth who have given their power to the Whore, who sitts upon many
waters, and the waters are kindreds, and tongues, and people, and Nations, yea
all Nations have been drunk with the cup of her Fornication, and being all gone
forth from the life, in which the Prophets and the holy men of God lived in,
and were established in; the Nations are become as waters, reeling to and fro,
hither and thither, unsettled, unstable, there the Whore has her seat, and all
having drunk of her cup of Iniquity and Fornication, even of mystery- Babylons
cup, and are inflamed therewith; and so reeles to, and fro, as the waters, and
are as the waves of the Sea unstable, by her who has made all Nations drunk,
and by them who have been made drunk with her, even all Nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people, have the Prophets been slain, and the witnesses slain, and
none to bury them, not in mystery- Babylon, who is drunk with the blood of the
Saints, and they that have drunk of her cup of Fornication, even all the Kings,
Nobles, Potentates of the earth, they have acted the like, and have slain the
appearance of God, where ever it has been brought forth, and the red Dragon
has stood ready to devour the heir, which is borne of mystery- Jerusalem which
is the Mother of all who are borne from above, who are heirs of the promise of
Eternal life, and the powers of the earth has joined their power to the
Dragon, who cast out floods of venom after the Child, which is brought forth
by the woman, which is clothed whith the sun: and now the powers of the earth
takes part with the Dragon, and their authority and dominion that they
exercise is by his power which arises out of the bottomless pit; and shall go
into perdition, and he has deceived the Nations long, and all has exercised
their power against him who is the heir of the promise, the firstborn of
every Creature, who is higher than the highest, and greater than the greatest,
and have changed his laws, and made them void, and has set up the law of
sin and death, and has established unrighteous Laws by the power of
darkness, in which all Nations has been involved in, since the Dragon has
power, and whosoever would not obey those Laws and customs, and constitutions,
the Dragon has had power, and all that have joined to him for a time, to kill,
to imprison, to destroy, and they who have been exalted have had thought to
weary cut the Saints of the most high, and to root out the memorial of the
just, that he and all his adherents, might reign for ever, in the Kingdom of
unrighteousness, and in the dominion of darkness, which is the Devils dwelling
place, and residence for ever, who is at enmity against God, and the Children
of light, which worship God in spirit and truth, in life and righteousness.

Now is the time drawing near, and he who is the desire of all Nations
appears, the ancient of days is coming, whose throne is established in
righteousness for ever, who will break the head of the Dragon, and will lay
hold upon him, and chain him up that he deceive the Nations no more, and all
you Emperors, Kings, Dukes, Earls, Nobles, Lords, and Potentates, who have
joined to him, your Kingdom shall be rent from you, and your hands shall grow
weak, that you shall not be able to defend your selves against him who
travells in the greatness of his strength, who is coming up against you, as a
Lion greedy of his prey, and will devour at once all his enemies, that thought
in their hearts to reign for ever, and to settle themselves in iniquity for
ever: now the time draws near when he will put down the authority of the
dragon, and of the beast, and the beast with many heads and horns, and their
rule shall come to an end, and he will dash you one again another as broken
pitchers, till you be consumed and brought to naught, and be worn out as a
motheaten garment, and will overthrow your Laws and customs, which is made in
the night of ignorance, and blindness, and will change your customs and the
times, and will reduce the earth again into its first purity, and you that have
ruled, shall serve and be tributary; and as you have had a time of rejoicing
over the witnesses (who has troubled your earthly and devilish peace) and
slain them as sheep for the slaughter; a time of mourning is coming upon you,
when you shall say alas, alas, for your glory shall pass away, and your renown
shall wither; and for your dominion which shall grow so weak, tht you shall
not be able to resist him who travells in the greatness of his strength, and
treads the winepress of the wrath of God, who is mighty and strong to judge
the Whore, and all they that have committed fornication with her, and have
drunk of her cup, and are inflamed with Adultery, and cannot cease from sin,
but burns in envy against the appearing of the manchild who is heir of the
promise, yea of life everlasting, born heir to the inheritance which is
incoruptible, unto whom all power belongs both in heaven and earth, who will
subdue the lower power, and powers of darkness, and tread them under foot, and
all who act from that power which is below the life, below the truth, below the
light, that power will he (and all whom he brings out of the grave, and raises
above the grave) tread down under foot, which stands but in the earth wherein
dwells unrighteousness.

Allthough thy teachers and diviners in the oh earth, who preaches a divnation
of their own brain, and from the imagination of their own hearts, has made you
believe, oh you powers of the earth, who are in the fall, in the transgression
of the life, that you were the higher powers, every Emperor, King, Duke,
Earl, Nobles, Lords, and that all were to stoop to your wills, how contrary
soever they have been to God, but you and they must know, there is one higher
than the highest, who is King of kings, and Lord of Lords, who alone will judge
the hearts of his people, and their consciences, for he will not give his glory
to another, although you have long usurped it, since the days of the Apostasy,
and would have had all to bow to that power which has transgressed the life,
and is gone from the power of God, oh long has been the night of ignorance,
and darkness, and great has been the apostasy in the earth, since the days of
the Apostles, and since the false Christ's and false prophets entered into the
World, which Christ said should come, and cry lo here, and there, and should
deceive many, yea all the world wondered after the beast, and John, sa^ it all
ly in wickedness, and the time that Christ prophesied of came to be fullfilled
in the days of John, and he saw it; Matt. 24. 23, 24. that many false prophets
and Antichrists, were gone out into the World, out from the life, out from the
truth, cut from the light, wherein the Saints had fellowship, who wrote forth
the Scriptures, and he said they were gone into the World, and he said the
whole World lay in wickedness, and so they went from holiness into wickedness,
and from the fathers love into the love of the World, and Peter and Jude, who
lived in the same age, they saw them that went in the error of Balaam, and in
the way of Cain, and in gainsaying the Power, being turned from it like Corah,
and also their hearts were exercised with covetuous practices, So John saw they
were come, 1 John 2. 18, 19, ver. Little Chilldren it is the last times as you
have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists,
whereby we know its the last time, and Peter saw that false Apostles should
come, who should make merchandise of the people, and prophesied of it, as you
may read 2 Pet. 2. 2, 3. and in the 14, 15. verses, you may know them by their
fruits, having eyes full of adultery; and cannot cease from sin; beguiling
unstable souls, and hearts they have exercised with covetuous practices, and
they were the cursed children; and these had forsaken the right way, Christ the
way and his command also: freely ye have received, freely give, and they
labored to keep the Gospel without charge, who were true Apostles, but these
false prophets, deceitful workers, Antichrists and false Apostles, they were
gone in Balaams way, after the ways of unrighteousness in Cains way, in Coras
way, in Antichrists way, cut of Christ's way, and these false prophets, false
Apostles, they spoke swelling words of vanity, and did allure through the
lusts of the flesh, and they like the rest of the false Prophets gone before
them, cried peace, and promised peace unto others, while they run with them
into riotousness, and while they put into their mouths, and these promised
liberty to themselves and others, while they themselves were servants of
corruption, and Jude bore witness that they were turned from the Grace of God
into lasciviousness, and wantonness, even from the grace that taught them to
deny ungodliness, and was sufficient to preserve them from these errors
before mentioned, but they went from it, and from the light and life of men,
and denied him, and owned another, even him who abode not in the truth (the
foundation of God) but went out of the truth, and so are bottomless or without
foundation, and there is the very center, ground and residence of all the false
prophets, Antichrists, deceivers, all comes from or out of the bottomless pit,
and leads to perdition.

And Paul if not in that age, yet in the next age after lived, and he saw the
mystery of iniquity already begin to work, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 6. and Paul an Apostle
of Christ wrote to Timothy his Son that the spirit spoke expressly some should
depart from the faith, and they should speak lies in hypocrisy 1 Timothy 4.
1, 2. and in the 2 of Tim. he gave him notice what fruits they should bring
forth, they that departed from the faith, Chap. 4. ver. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. yea a
great Apostasy from the faith there was, while Paul was yet living, for he
writes to Timothy 2. Tim Chap. 1. this thou know, that all they which were
in Asia, be turned away from me, and there were a great people in Asia, for
great persecution he suffered in Asia, and stayed 2 years in Asia, Acts. 19.
ver. 10. In so much that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the
Lord, yea and diverse great men and of the chief of Asia were his friends, Acts
19. ver. 21. so its manifest there were 2 great people, for Acts 19. 26 verse,
not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia this Paul has persuaded,
and turned away much people, said Demetrius: and Paul writing to the
Corinthians, says 1 Cor, 16. 19. the Churches in Asia salute you; and John
writes to seven, Rev. 1, 4. Rev. 11. and as was said before, all was departed
from the faith, even all they that are in Asia are turned away from me, and the
Apostle wrote to Titus; Titus. 1 ver. 10, 11. that there were many unruly, and
vain talkers, and deceivers, who subverted whole houses, teaching the things
they ought not, for filthy lucre.

And John, who wrote the last in the Revelations, he writes that the whole
World wondered after the beast, and his power was so great, that it was said who
is able to make war with the beast, and they worshipped the beast, saying,
who is able to make war with the beast Rev. 13. ver. 3, 4. and the beast that
arose out of the Sea, having seven heads, and ten horns, and upon his horns
ten Crowns, and upon his head the name of blasphemy, and the Dragon gave him
his power, his seat, and great Authority, and he opened his mouth in Blasphemy
against God, to blaspheme his Name and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in
Heaven, and it was given him to make war with the Saints, ver. 6. 7, and to
overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, tongues, and Nations,
and all that dwell upon the earth, ver. 9. shall worship him, whose names are
not written in the Lamb's book of life, shin from the foundation of the World,
this Beast receiving his power and authority from the Dragon has prevailed; he
rose out of the Sea, the Waters upon which the whore sits, and the waters are
kindreds, tongues and people, and the Beast arose out of the Sea also, that the
whole World wondered after and worshipped, and John that saw this coming 14 or
15 hundred years ago; so that in a few ages after the Apostles all was worn
out, the life lost, the Dragon had power, the Beast had power, and all wondered
after him, and the Whore had made all Nations drunk with her Fornication; and
then she came to sit upon many Waters, Kindred, Tongues and People, hears the
Waters, hears the Sea out of which the Beast rose, who received his power from
the Dragon, and this is he who upon his head had the names of Blasphemy, and
all kindreds, tongues, and Nations whose names were not written in the Lambs
book, they who honored the Beast, and worshipped the Beast, and said who is
able to make war with him, admired his power, and submitted unto him; and he
has had power, and has prevailed against the saints, did overcome them, and
the Dragon has made war with the Seed which keep the Commandments of God, and
the testimony of Jesus, all this was seen many Ages ago, and what work the
Dragon has made in the Nations and in the Earth, where he has had dominion
and prevailed, and what a raging the roaring Lion has kept in the Earth is
evident, seeking to destroy them in whom the seed remained, and to destroy them
in whom the power of God was, or the least measure, and so the false, Prophets,
deceivers, Antichrists, which wenout then, which the Apostle saw, they cried up
that power which was from the life of God, and has cried it up for the higher
power, and said all ought to be subject to it, and said who is able to make war
with the Beast, for the false Apostles and Deceivers and Antichrists went from
the Grace of God, and from the light, and from the power of God, into the World
and into that Nature, which all kindreds, and tongues, and people walked in,
and into the power that acts the Children of disobedience, and joined with that
power upon which the Whore sits: and they taught Nations and People to admire
this power, and to admire the Beast because of his Heads and Horns, and Crowns
and Names; and has wrought miracles before the Beast; and this power which the
Beast had received from the Dragon, this power admires the false Prophet, and
the false Prophet the Beast; so that none could buy nor sell, nay nor live, but
that had his mark or the number of his name, and so all has been in utter
darkness, and the deeds of darkness has spread themselves over the Earth;
For the Whore who is adulderated from God; and the Dragon, and the Beast, and
the false Prophet, all have acted from that power, which is below the truth,
and below the life, which power is at enmity against the truth and the life and
against the light; and this power overspread all Nations, and the Sun being
set, the night came over all, and the shadow of death over all Nations, and a
veil and a covering has been spread over all: and so out of the midst of thick
darkness all has acted this long and dark night of ignorance in the Apostasy,
wherein the Dragon has had power, and the Beast, and that power has been
admired and set up, which has transgressed the life, so that any who have been
zealous for the truth, and have kept the testimony of Jesus, and the spirit of
prophecy; the false prophets in all Nations, who are from the testimony of
Jesus, have called to the Beast to slay and to kill and to destroy the seed of
the woman, which is clothed with the Sun, and so the Beast exercising his
power which is from below, have killed and destroyed them who were subject to
the higher power.

And what torturing and Massacring, and persecution, what burning and
strangling there has been, what cruel deaths many have been put to, over all
Nations and in all Nations, where the beast have had power, who makes war
against the life, so that the streets have run with blood, and all being gone
from the life and power of God, they set up themselves to be Judges over men's
consciences, and they who were in the error, they cried out of heresy, and
they that are gone from the truth into a lie, the ground of Blasphemy, they cry
out of Blasphemy, and under the horns of the beast, and under the heads, and
the Crowns of the beast, what Cannons constitutions, edicts, and laws have
been in all Nations, what trapps, ginns, and snares have been laid in every
Nation, yea, every home has pushed, and every head has lifted up it self
against Christ the head, and every mortal Crown has advanced it self
against the Crown of glory, and against the immortal Crown, so that it might
be said as Eliah said, the altar of the Lord has been broken down and his
prophets and his witnesses slain, none has escaped the rage of the Beast.

Yet there has been a few who have kept their garments clean, and were not
defiled with women, nor with the Harlot, those who feared the Lord, and durst
not offend the righteous law of God in their consciences, but has denied whole
counsels who were erred from the faith, and all the powers of the earth in
which the beast bore rule, but rather choose to suffer cruel deaths, than to
let go the profession and possession of their faith, whose blood cries under
the Altar, how long oh Lord, holy, just, and true, will it be ere thou avenge
our blood, which blood and cry is entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts,
who will speedily take vengeance on the Nations, and dash them one against
another, and will break down that power which has slain the witnesses, yea,
and has gainsaid the power of God, and all Nations who are from the life, in
which the holy men of God lived, and in that nature still which persecuted the
life of God wherever it did apear in any measure, yea, swelled up and climbed
to the very top of iniquity, which is Satan's Crown and glory, and the priests,
and they that went out from the light into the World, in John's days, and
Peter's days, who then taught for filthy lucre, and did subvert whole houses
from the faith, ever since that time has spread themselves over the Nations,
and has begotten people into a form and into an image, without the life, and
so has worshipped the beast and his image.

And the deceit being entered then, and images then being set up, one on this
wise, another on that, and some have had an image of many mixtures, such an
image as the priests of England, Scotland, and Ireland worship, and has got a
law to guard it, that whosoever will not bow to it, the furnace is heat hotter
to throw them into it.

Object. And if any say, why I say so, or how do I make that appear.

Ans. I answer thus* the Cardinals, Jesuits, and other Romish Priests had a
law made to protect their Idol, the Mass, and if any spoke to him that was
sacrificing to the Image, or Idol, then three months inprisonment, but now if
any declares against the Image, that the Priests of England, Scotland, and
Ireland have set up, every one is to pay five pound, or six months imprisonment
in a house of correction, and there be tortured, and whipped, and shamefully
entreated, nere to the loss of life, nay its now so much the more hotter now
than ever.

None must come near the house of their Idol God or Image, but must be counted
a breaker of the peace, nor speak to a deceiver, and say he is so, nor a
hireling and say he is so, nor to a covetous Priest and say he is so, and can
for proof bring half of his parish to witness the truth of this, but if he
speak the truth never so clear, he must to prison or pay five pound, or the
house of correction, and there be whipped, and stocked, and fettered, and
chayned, and tortured, and so it is manifest that those magistrates, who had a
hand in making of this law have outstript the magistrates in the time of Mary,
when the Pope had domination in his height in these nations.

And the Priests ^ow, who in these Nations, who have set up their Image of many
mixtures, and one year they make one, and another year another, and what as
that power likes the best, that is gone out of the life and power of God, that
they present to the authority of the Nation as an Image of a more comely
stature, than the former, and then authority makes a law to guard it, and so it
may truly be said, as it was said to Israel, has any other Nation changed
their God, but Israel had changed from the living God, to them by nature which
are no Gods, and so has these Nations gone from God, the Fountain of life,
and from the power of God, and has set up an Image in which is no life
instead, nay, they are not content with their Image, but it grows old, and
then pa^ches up another of many mixtures, one while the Mass that was held
forth as their public profession, and then Prelacy and the book of common
Prayer, and then Presbytery and the Directory mixed and made up: Ignorance,
Blindness and of the fragments of Popery, and their own invention, and this now
is set up for all to bow to, one while one thing which they call faith, and
another while another, and heaps of confused confessions, but are all out of
the life and from the true Faith.

And now they have manifested themselves to have no Faith, and to be without
faith, and are unagreed upon it, instance that which is called the humble
petition, and advice presented to O. P. by the late Parliament, that there may
be a public confession of faith made and recommended, as the public
profession, and also that none may speak or write against, under a penalty, but
this Image the Lord has by his immediate hand from Heaven cursed, and
confounded them that would have founded it, before it ever came to be set up,
ah silly silly, that ever they who should profess godliness, should so shame
themselves and all their teachers, for the teachers are not agreed yet of their
faith, so they have either no faith, or else many forms which is feigned, and
in this they are not yet agreed, and so being out of the true faith, in which
the Saints had fellowship; in the unity of the faith they are all in
distraction, and confusion, head, and tail, in the jarr, in the strife about
words, and a form of words, and how many Confessions and forms and Images is
there set forth, and people still Ignorant of the mystery of faith which is
held in a pure conscience, and wants that which is the evidence of things not
seen, and wants that which should let people see him who is invisible, and oh
how is people lost in the midst of these feigned, formal, divinations, and
how are the Rulers in most Nations lost in the midst of their counsels,
being gone from that which should be a terror to evil doers, and should be for
the praise of them that do well.

And what if all people in all Nations were constrained under a penalty to hold
such a form of words, and to consent to such a confession, does this any more
but make hypocrites, when a man is not first persuaded of those things in his
mind by the spirit of truth, is this any more, but fainedness, how long has
the God of this World bl^nded the eyes of people, whole Cities, Towns, and
Countries, because they have gotten a formal Confession, made by a Priest, who
is out of Christ's doctrine, in the steps of the false Prophets, and in the
practice of the false Apostles, and deceitful workers, and when they have made
a Confession, or a Catechism, as they call it, and has gotten over the words,
and can say them over, now judges they have faith, and are sound Christians,
when they are Ignorant of the first principle or of faith toward God, and so
are carried on in the mist of darkness, and ignorance, and knows not yet
repentance from dead works.

Object. But some of the Rulers, and Potentates of the earth may say, we have
not persecuted them for well doing, but for heresy, and blasphemy, and sowers
of sedition, and because they have not submitted to obey our constitutions and
laws.

Ans. Deceit has never wanted a cover hitherto, neither has or can the
serpent want subtilty, for its his nature by which he lives: Nabucadnezar made
a law, that whosoever would not obey, should be cast into the furnace, and
might not all his magistrates have said to Shadrak, Meshach, and Abednego, that
they were not subject to the Kings decree, and therefore judge they suffered
deservedly, and did not the Jews who were uncircumcised in heart say, when
they took up stones to stone Christ, we stone thee not for thy good work^s, but
thou being a man makes thy self God, and the Jews stoned Paul, and Stephen,
and put Peter, and John in prison, they said they were movers of sedition, and
ringleaders of Sects, but the chief Priests and the false prophets, had
always their hands, in conspiring against the life of the just, but
persecutors were ever blind, and yet were so conceited, that they saw, that
they said to Christ are we also blind, but the seed of falsehood has fitten as
Judge long, and has laid the heritage of God wast, and has set it self in
Gods Temple as the true heir, and judged the heir not worthy to live, and
thousands of thousands have been put to cruel deaths, and a numberless number
has suffered since the Apostles days, and since the apostasy came in, yet
these which have done these things would be called Christian Magistrates, and
Ministers of justice, and those teachers who have called to the rulers to
punish such as Heretics, and Seducers, they would be counted the ministers of
Christ, and such Nations who are out of the life, they would be counted holy.

Oh nay, Christ came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them, and all you
rulers in all Nations, who goes under the name of Christendom, who are upon the
earth, and all you teachers that are therein, whose actions and lives,
doctrines, and principles, and practices, are contrary to the life of
righteousness, and contrary to the doctrine of Christ and the practice of the
holy men of God, you are all out of Christ's nature, and out of the divine
nature, in the Dragons nature, and in the corrupt nature, in the nature in
which all the disobedient and the rebellious are in, who are heirs of wrath
and eternal vengeance, therefore repent ye of your iniquity, and tremble
before the Lord God of heaven and earth, who is roreing from his dwelling
place, and uttering forth his dreadful voice, at the sound thereof all Nations
shall fear, and be astonished, and the fenced Cities, in which you dwell, shall
be horribly afraid.

Behold the time of restoring, is come, and coming, and the year of Gods
controversy with Sions enemies is aproching near you, and he who sits and
judges in righteousness, has showed himself, will rule over the heathen as
with a rod of Iron, and will pour forth his plagues upon all the families of
the earth, that calls not upon his name, but despises it, and tramples upon it,
the earth is filled with violence, cruellty and opression, yea it is broken
forth as a flood, and the Nations is covered with unrighteousness, as with a
garment, the beast has exercised his power, and has overcome and prevailed
long over the heritage of God, and the mountain of the Lords house is made
desolate, all is void and without form, deceit inthroned, truth trampled upon,
Judgment turned backward, and the devil reigns a King, equity has found no
place, mercy is shut out of doors, cruelty is entertained, temperance and
moderation has no residence, lust, uncleanness, excess, riotousness, and
wantoness, is loved as though it were the way to eternal felicity, pride,
hypocrisy, and dissimulation is taken pleasure in, sobriety and meekness has
no dwelling place, but is thrown aside, folly and madness is set up as the
greatest wisdom, and the wisdom which is from above counted the greatest
folly; the fear of the Lord is slighted, Gods pure law thrown behind their
backs, the Nations and the people therein are compassed about with darkness as
a wall, and with ignorance as a curtain, and with blindness as with a strong
fence, they are situated in the region of death, and at the side of the pit,
and yet says no evil shall come near us, nor sorrow touch our tabernacle, and
is in a dead sleep of security, wrapped up in the slumber of iniquity, involved
in utter darkness, folded up in the deep pit of ignorance; and desires not the
knowledge of wisdom, neither to walk in her path, but her way is grievous unto
them, and the eye lid of the morning is unto them as the shadow of death.

Nevertheless he that weighes all things in an even balance, before whom all
Nations are but as the drop of a bucket, he is appearing in his power, and
thundering from his holy place, who will make the Nations shake as an olive
leaf, and the Isles tremble before him, who is uttering forth his voice as the
sound of many waters, which shall make all the Potentates, and mighty of the
earth bow, the eyelids of the morning is opened, and the Sun is rising to his
height, and the dark Air is scattering by the breath of his mouth, and so all
things shall appear in the earth as they are, and every thing under the face of
the Heaven shall be brought to light, and all the powers of darkness
discovered, and the works, and workers of iniquity shall no longer be hid, but
shall be discovered by the light of the son of God, and shall be judged and
cendemned by the life of righteousness, and blessed are they who know a hiding
place in him, when his overflowing scourge passes over the Nations which is
already made ready to execute his judgment upon the heathen that know him not,
oh who may abide his presence, when he appears in his power and majesty and
glory, all the ungodly of the earth, shall be as driven stubble before his bow,
and shall fly before him, nevertheless the pursues shall overtake, and the
destroyer shall lay hold upon them, and all the ungodly shall hear the
sentence, go ye cursed from the presence of the Lord into the pit of
everlasting destruction.

And when this day comes upon the Nations, all your prophets, diviners and
teachers, who are out of the life of Christ, who have flattered you and told
you, you were the higher power, and you must sit as judge in the things of the
Father, and Lord it over the consciences of people, and prescribe the Lord a
way, and a limit in your several, Nations, and dominions, they shall not be
able to deliver themselves neither you, but the helper and the helped shall
both fall together, the strengthener and the strengthened shall grow feeble,
and their loins weak, so that they shall not be able to stand before him who
is the higher power, and the greatest digni^y, who will rule over all usurpers,
and over all the children of pride, the Dragon, the beast and the false
prophet, and teller of lies, shall have their portion in the lake that burns.

Then shall the ransomed of the Lord, and the righteous seed, whom the Nations
have slain, and persecuted; the prophets, and holy men of God, and all that
have been slain for the testimony of Jesus, rejoice over the deceit, and it
shall be sung in that day, the Lord God omnipotent reigns, who will ascend
above all principallities and powers, thrones and dominions, and tread down all
under his feet that the earth may be filled with his glory, and behold he
comes quickly in a moment, and sudden destruction shall be upon his enemies,
and the breath of his mouth shall make all melt away that hate the Lord, and
their remembrance shall rot for ever and ever.

Therefore oh all ye powers of the earth, who are the sons of fallen Adam,
whose power arises out of the earth, in which the Devil dwells and the
serpent fe^ds, who bear rule but not by the Lord; who sits as judges in the
earth, and yet your judgment is from the earth, and from below, know this, you
shall all be judged with the just; and all your unrighteous decrees, laws
constitutions, ordinances, and edicts, which is made in the fallen wisdom, you
and they both together will be cast aside as a thing of naught, and must all be
judged with the just, therefore repent and turn to the Lord of heaven and
earth, that you may know his righteouss judgment set up in your hearts, and the
spirit of in justice and error purged out of your hearts, or else you judge not
for God, for all the laws, constitutions, and ordinances, which are made in
the fallen principle, and fallen wisdom, to have all these in the head or in
the memory, so that he may act in a Nation or Kingdom, according to the letter
of a law prescribed in a Nation; that does not at all make a man an able
minister of justice or a magistrate for God for the root being unholy and
corrupt and erroneous, from whence those laws were given forth, the branches
is unholy also, the ground being corrupt, the tree bad, the fruit is bad also,
and so all nations who are degenerate from the life of God, their laws and
constitutions does always imbondage the regenerate; so the heart being
deceitful and unrighteous, such laws proceeds forth which does oppress the
upright in heart, and all, or most of the laws in all nations, are received by
tradition from generation to generation, since the scattering of Israel, who
received the law from Gods own mouth by the hand of Moses a Magistrate of the
Lord, and a judge over Israel; and so heaps of decrees, statutes, and
ordinances there is in the nations which does not answer that of God in the
conscience of every man, and so that which is pure of God in the conscience of
every one cannot be subject to those laws and tradi^ions, but rather suffers,
as many thousands have done, cruel deaths, and great oppression all this dark
time of Antichrist reign, and of the beast in all nations since the apostasy;
and death reigning over all the sons of the first Adam, in the transgression,
death has breathed forth it self upon the face of the earth, for sin entering
and death by sin it rules in the heart, and exercises his power which stands
in unrighteousness, and so all mankind in all their acting, can do nothing for
God but against him; and against his people who are redeemed out of the region
of death, and so all lawgivers, and lawmakers, and laws which stands in the
will of man, and in the unrighteous principle, will the second Adam, the Lord
from Heaven, the restorer of mankind utterly overthrow, abolish and take away
their power, for the lawgiver shall come out of Sion; who ever in all nations,
that ever come to see him must see him come from thence, whose appearance shall
be as a lamp that burns, and he shall change the customs and the times and
the laws, and overthrow all them that stands in the curse, for he shall lead
out of death, and out of its path; and from under the law of sin and death,
that all that hears him and comes to be subject to his law, shall deny all
those laws in the very ground, and bear their testimony against them, which
stands in that nature, that transgresses the life, and therefore give ear all
nations, and all Emperors Kings, Monarkes, Lord, Judges, and rulers of the
earth, in all nations he is come and coming, whose right it is to judge the
earth in righteousness, and the people with equity, even he unto whom all
judgment is committed, and he has appeared as the son of God in the north
region of the world in power and majesty and great glory, and has made the
mountains me^t before him, and he has dried up all the springs of Babylon,
and has made the Cedars bow; and made the trees of the forest to shake; and
the sturdy oaks has he cut up by the roots; and turned a pleasant land into
a wilderness, and has made the wilderness to blossom, and has changed the
customs already, and has broken deaths covenant, and has overthrown the
mighty men, yea even the horse and his rider, and has taken off their chariot
wheels in the day of battle, and it has been a dreadful day and a sore
slaughter, as in the days of Gibea, or as in the valley Jehos^phat and a
sorrowful day has come, and great mourning, as Hadadrimmon in the valley of
Megiddo, for one post has met another, and the news has been, Babylon is
taken at both ends, and he has overrun the multitude of Egypt, and trampled
upon them, as the prancing of horses in battle, so that the mighty are fallen
by him, and the strong has not been able to help themselves against him who
has come as one that trod the winepress, and now has overturned the powers of
death, hell and the grave, and has broken deaths covenant, and will put an
end to all changeable laws, and has and will establish his law which indures
for ever and ever: and now hear, all that are left unspoyled are angry, and
all that worship the Beast, are left unslain, blasphemes him and speaks evi^l
of his name, and of his wondrous works which he has done in t^is day, as in
the land of Egypt, and in the fields of ZOAN; for he has turned the waters
into blood, and has cut all the fresh springs, and has slain the firstborn
of Egypt, at which Pharaoh and all his wise men, and all the Egyptians are
angry, and still resists the Lord, till they will, with the rest who have
resisted him, be swallowed up of the Deep.

And now oh Nations, who are situated under the whole face of the Heaven, he
is coming up against you as a Giant refreshed with wine, and shall run his
course, and none shall be able to stop his way, and shall come as Israel, after
the slaughter of Edom, with their Garments red; and he travails in the
greatness of his strength, and shall make all Nations desolate, who have given
their power to the Beast, and will break their Covenants, and throw down your
traditions which are Heathenish, and he is bringing a handful out of the North
Country, who have been eyewitnesses of his power, Majesty, and Glory, and of
his noble Acts, and though but a handful, yet they are blessed, and his
increase shall be great, for they shall subdue Nations, and Kings shall be
tributary to them, and they shall be his Witnesses to the ends of the World,
and shall publish his Righteousness from Generation to Generation, and bear
their testimony of him, who lives for ever and ever, who is the Lord of Heaven
and Earth, our Righteousness; who has broken open the Seals of the Deep, and
has made the springs of Life to flow forth as though it issued out of a Womb;
by which his little ones are refreshed and grow in strength, honor, and glory
to him in the highest, whose judgments are just, holy, pure and equal for
ever and ever:

Oh who can stand before him, who has uttered forth his voice before his Camp,
and its very great, devouring fire is before him, and it is tempestuous round
about him, and his sword devoures much flesh, and all the ungodly shall be
slain, heaps upon heaps, so that there shall be none left to bury the dead: A
glorious high Throne has he erected, and he sits thereon, and judges in
righteousness, even he before whose face the Heaven and the Earth shall fly
away, and the Sea be dried up, oh who can dwell with d^vouring fire, who can
dwell with everlasting burning, who can stand when he appears, when he draws
out his sword of Justice all Nations shall grow pale, and all the rulers
feeble, and the Warrior shall not find his hands in the day of batta^l, when
they encounter with the Almighty, for his sword shall be fatted with slaughter,
and all Nations who resist shall become soked with blood.

Oh he is dreadful, who can stand when he appears, who is a consuming fire,
therefore all Rulers in Nations, and Potentates of the Earth, fear and dread
his holy name, and bow unto his righteous Scepter, least you be cut off, and
perish with the rest of the uncircumcised, who have resisted him, and go down
into the nethermost Hell for ever; for assuredly the day of your fanning and
trying is near, arm your selves, put on your Armor, see if you be able to
stand in the day of the Lord. Oh, nay you will all be as dust before the
whirlwind, and shall be scattered in the fierce anger of the Lord, and all
your changeable Laws, Constitutions, Customs, and Traditions, which is brought
forth from the changeable principle, which is gone out from the life, and all
your turning of things upside down, shall be as the Potters clay, for he unto
whom the eternal being has committed all Judgment, which he has appointed
to judge in righteou^ness is appearing, and come, and coming, who si^s as a
Refiners fire, and sits as Judge among the Gods, who will not give his glory
and honor to any other.

And so all you that b^are rule and not by him, who is the true light which
in^ightneth every man that comes into the World your power other is from
another, even from him who is (...) with the light, for by me says the Lord
Kings rule, and Princes decree Justice, and such as were obedient un^o his
righteous Law written in their hearts; as David, Solomor, Jehosaphat, Ezekiah,
and the rest of the holy Kings and Princes, who were guided by that which was
just and unchangeable, they ruled by his power and decreed Justice, and
answered that which was just in every man's conscience, which is one with that
power in which they ruled, and from whence they acted, and so a terror they
became to none, but evil doers, who were out of the power, and out of the
truth, and in that nature which stood up against that powers by which the
Princes decreed Justice, and so with the power of God, all these Rulers, and
Rules, and Governments, which is not according to the power of the just God, is
to be abolished at the coming of him, whose day shall come, and in his power
and glory he shall appear, which shall darken and dazell, extirpate, and
utterly destroy all, root and branch together, who is out of his power and
against it, so there shall be a very great overturning, such as has not been
from the beginning, neither shall be ever hereafter.

And then shall the Restorer be seen, who shall restore the Earth into its
first purity, and there shall be Judges as at the first, and Counselors as at
the beginning; then shall the Earth enjoy her rest, and the Nations their
Sabbath, for the Lord of glory has considered it, and he has listened, and a
great cry is heard out of all Nations, of the poor, and of the opressed, and of
his Creatures which he has made, how they have been chopped to pieces, as
flesh for the Pot, and ground to dust as though they had not been Gods
workmanship, and his seed in al^ Nations has been held in great captivity;
whose sighs, groans and tears has pierced through the Clouds, and is entered
to the Throne of God, who is now arising to plead the cause of the poor and the
needy, and now woe to the World, and to all them that have borne rule, but not
by the Lord.

An advertisment to all the rulers upon earth,
THere is one only God, the Creator and the bringer forth of all things, whose
way is equal, and whose Judgments are just, whose Law is righteous, whose
Statutes are pure, answering his own pure Witness in every man under the face
of Heaven in all Nations upon the Earth, so as every man in all Nations upon
the Earth comes to own Gods pure witness in himself, placed by the Lord; he
shall be made to confess unto the righteous acting of those Rulers who rule in
righteousness, by the righteous law of God; but where any Ruler is not ruled
himself, by that which is pure of God which condemns self, and self-actings
in himself, He bears rule, but not in Gods Dominion, and so lays yoaks upon a
Nation, Country or People, to make all submit to his will, decrees, and
ordinances, and to deny that which is pure of God in themselves, and then joins
to his deceit, and thus iniquity gets head, and is set up as a rule, and the
law of God, both in the Ruler, and the ruled, is thrown behind their back, and
so deceit leads, and the changeable mind acts it self out in every thing
that it has to do withal; and so tyranie and opression spreads over a whole
Nation, and the just suffers in it.

And hence it is that there are so many several Laws, Ordinances and
Constitutions, and Traditions, and Customs among men in many Nations and
Countries, and Regions, one differing from another, and heaps of confusion,
that hardly in any Nations, or few in a Nation knows what is Law, there is so
much variableness, and changeableness amongst the Lawmakers, one while setting
up, another while pulling down, and as deceit advances it self in any
particular Ruler, then there must be a Law made, and a penalty upon the
nonperformance, as death, banishment, tortering, whipping, racking,
prisonment, fining, to the utter destruction of many; and all the ground of
this is because the Rulers are gone from that of God in themselves, and then
acts in their own wills, and by their craft and deceit which stands in the
Ground, which is cursed, and calls this Christian policy and wisdom, and
cruelty becomes a Law, and the Devil keeps his Dominion in the Earth, and
deceit gets a Cover and hides it self

Now it was not so from the beginning; For as God is one, and his Name one, his
Law is one, which is pure and equal, and unalterable, and indures for ever and
ever. Now man being made in Gods own Image, answered the pure Law of God, and
being Gods Image was one with the Law, and the Law was not against him, but was
his life and joy, and he had power to obey it; for he was of its own nature,
for as God is pure and holy, and the Image which he brought forth man in was
pure and holy, and that which was man's guide and rule was pure and holy, here
was unity and purity, and he that created, and man that was created was in
unity, and then there was no woe, no condemnation, no sorrow, no death, no
tribulation, nor anguish, nor wrath, revealed against man who was the Image of
God, and he stood in the Dominion of God, and had dominion over that which was
contrary, here was no tyranie, here was no cruelty, no prisons, no envy, no
persecution, no killing nor destroying, no defrauding, no jarre, no strife, no
devouring, but all Gods creation at unity, and man at unity with God, being
partakers of his Dominion, whereby all the Earth was in order, and in that
wisdom which changed not, and here man had dominion and power, and ruled in
Gods authority, and was guided by the higher power, and while he was subject to
it, death had no power over him; now this was before sin entered, and before
death entered, and before enmity had appeared in the Earth, but now was the Lord
King and Lawgiver, and Judge, who ruled in righteousness, and man being
subject to him, there was no Law against him, nor no guilt of any thing, for
transgression was not known in the Earth, and there was no curse, but all was
in unity and peace, no changeableness, but all was in the covenant, all the
workmanship of his hand was united unto him, and all that he had made was
blessed, and all the Creation were partakers of his blessedness, and all stood
in the covenant, by which every Creature received power, virtue and dominion,
here was one mind, and here was no double, no variation, no mutation, nor
change, but the dominion of the everlasting God was felt, which indures for
ever and ever, and any other thing was not seen in the Earth, but man crowned
with honor, dominion and dignity, wherein could be nothing but rejoicing, and
pure peace and joy, now no evil was known, neither was there any such thing,
but goodness possessed the whole Earth, and righteousness breathed forth it
self in all things in the circumference thereof, and all the works of his hends
pleased him, and man made partakers of his pleasure, and was accepted, and not
rejected, thus in part I have showed unto you the state of the Earth, and of
mankind, and the glory of Gods Creation, and the blessedness thereof, but if I
could declare unto the whole World, from years end, to years end, I should fall
short, and words would be wanting, to express the felicity and happiness in
which man was brought forth in, neither shall any be able to see into those
things, or to declare certainly of those things, who come not beyond time, to
him who is eternal, who gave them a being.

But after man had taken of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, and had
eat of the fruit thereof; and consented to the beguiler, and to the Serpent,
sin entered, and death by sin, man lost his dominion, and became subject to
another, and another had power over him, and now the course of nature was set
on the fire of Hell, the curse entered, and man dead while he lives; and in
that day he eat did die, and death breathed forth it self in the Earth* and
Cain is brought forth in his own Image, to wit, in the Image of him who was
gone out of Gods Dominion, and he became a murderer, and slew him that was
accepted of God, and here appeared now the enmity, and its life was to destroy,
and to murder, and to kill Abell, who believed and offered up a sacrifice, and
Cain offered in the unbelief, and was not accepted, so Abell who was just lived
by Faith, but Cain who was in the envy and in the wrath, this life was death
to him and to his nature, and so all who are out of the Faith, are dead while
they live.

Now after the transgression in process of time, when the seed of fallen Adam
began to increase in the Earth, being driven out from the presence of the Lord;
they spread over the whole Earth, and sought many inventions being gone from
that of God in themselves, by which they were united unto him, having broken
his covenant, and joined in covenant with death, death acts forth it self
against the seed, which is not of its nature, and always sought to imbondage
it, and to kill it as Cain did Abell, and Esau, Jacob, and Ismael did unto
Isaac and unto his seed.

Now the seed unto which the promise was received, the Law from the mouth of
the Lord, and they that persecuted the seed, invented, and made Laws of their
own, according to that nature in which they lived, and so became heathenish in
their Fashions, and Laws, and Customs, and cruelty grew up as it was nourished,
and leavened into its own nature, and unbelief grew into a mighty stature, and
monsters was brought forth in such a strange shape in every thing, that the
enmity did appear in, as had not been seen in the Earth before, and and so man
being gone astray from the life of righteousness, every thing is abominable,
and of a stranger nature, that he brings forth: yet take notice of this, that
as the seed unto which the promise was who were in the Faith, and obeyed
through Faith, they had a Law, so they in unbelief had also a Law, as the seed
worshipped the living God, through a lively and a living Faith, and so sinned
not in so doing, the seed of the serpent imitated a worship, and worshipped in
death and unbelief, and as the Laws of one was equal, such as David and
Solomon, the other was unequal, such as Jeroboam and Rehoboam, and as the one
set up equity by a Law, the other made a Law to set up iniquity.

And the seed, they sought not their own honor, but the honor of him who was
their reward, but the seed of the evil doer sought himself and his own honor,
and as the spirit of the Lord breathed forth it self, and spoke the truth in
the power of God, deceit uttered forth lies in hypocrisy, and in the power of
death, and as the upright lived unto God in the spirit, deceit lived unto the
flesh, and unto him who has the power of death, which is the Devil, and as
they fulfilled the Law of God, who were led by his holy spirit of God into all
truth, the other followed their own imaginations, and answered the deceit and
foolish mind, and they whose understanding was darkened loved them, and had
pleasure in them.

So it may be truly said, many Nations, Rulers and ruled sit in the Region of
the shadow of death; and the living God is forgotten among them, and one
against another, they are seeking one another ruin, and all in the violence,
and in the cruelty.

Therefore all Rulers and Potentates of the Earth, Magistrates and Governors
under the whole face of Heaven, hearken unto the words of my mouth, and listen
unto understanding, that you may be partakers of the happiness and felicity
which God is shedding abroad, now in the latter days, that so the Restorer you
may know in your Regions, and the deliverer in your Nations, and the maker up
of the breach in your Dominions, that he who is the desire of all Nations may
be revealed among you.

He which must restore is not born of man, nor comes not to a People or a
Nation, in the will of man, neither seeks he himself, but the glory of the
Father, who has sent him to seek, and to save that which is lost, and to heal
the breaches, and to destroy that which has made the breach, that so all
Nations who receive him, and believe in him, may be reconciled unto him, and
one to another; that the Earth may enjoy rest and the Regions quietness;
therefore all be warned not to look forth in your wills, for there you will not
receive him, but slight him, as many before you have done, and so lie down in
sorrow, and weary your selves in vanity, and lie down in infamy, and never come
to see his dignity.

Now he, of whom I declare unto you, is the Son of God, who is the light of the
World, and the life of man, and has lightened every man that comes into the
World, which light wherewith all men are enlightened is not contrary to the Law
of God which indures for ever, but one with it, and this will let you see,
violence, treachery, murder, envy, wrath, maliciousness, drunkeness, whoredom,
lying, cursed speaking, stealing, defrauding, cheating, cosening, rioteousness,
pride, arogancy, emulation, contention, strife, hatred, persecution, cruelty,
opression, I say the light which comes from Christ by whom the World was made,
will show you that all these things is sin and evil in the sight of God, and
also will let you see there is a ground from whence these, and all other evils
proceed, which ground is in all the Sons of men in the transgression, till it
be removed, and these things before mentioned, be the fruits that grows from
it, and buds forth themselves in all Nations, and in every man in every Nation,
so the Earth is filled with violence, and the grapes are as Sodom, and the
fruit as Gomorrah, whom God overthrew, and till these things be done away, and
these fruits wither, and the root from whence they arise be removed out of
every particular man who is a Ruler, he cannot be a blessing to a Nation,
neither rule for God in a Nation, neither will he or can he be a terror to all
these things before mentioned.

While he himself is in those, for he cannot destroy his own life, neither will
iniquity set up righteousness, nor the worker of iniquity advance Christ.

Therefore listen to the words of my mouth, and despise not counsel, least you
perish among fools, and go down to the horrible pit, where there is everlasting
misery unto all perpetuity.

Now God that made both Heaven and Earth, and all things that therein are; he
is light, and with him is no darkness at all, he never changes his purity; nor
alters his righteous decrees, his eye is pure, and always fixed to behold all
the works of the Sons of men, and he searches the heart of man with his eye,
and pierces through the secret places, and is near to every man, although man
do not see him, he is invisible, and eternal, and his Law indures for ever, and
the unalterable decree, by which sin is judged and reproved in the World, and
in every particular man, and every man who hearkens and hears the words of the
pure Law, which judges all sin in man, receives the sentence of death in
himself, and is judged by the righteous words of his mouth, and so sin in the
particular comes to be condemned, and all these changeable things is trodden
under foot, which is acted and brought forth from the changeable mind of man,
and so all Laws, Constitutions and Decrees, which is made in the will of man,
comes to be thrown down by his righteous Law which proceeds out of the mouth of
the righteous God, who is light, and so as his unchangeable and unalterable
decree comes to be set up in every particular Ruler, and Governor, and himself
judged with the just, he comes to bear his rule for the just, and answers that
which is just in every man, and no longer can he act against well doing, but is
a leader, and an incourager of it in all, and is a terror to the unjust, and
so comes to know the dominion again which man lost through disobedience and
transgression.

Now all you powers of the Earth, wait that you may come to see that, and feel
it revealed in your selves, to wit the Law of God from the mouth of God, that
so you following it, sin may be judged in your selves, and you come to know the
one Lord the Lawgiver which leads man back out of sin, and transgression by his
Son whom he has sent into the World, that all men through him might believe in
the Father, and be restored out of sin and transgression unto life eternal,
where death has no entrance, and so all who waits upon the light of the Son of
God, and is obedient to it, they come to feel his power and his decree which
cannot alter its property or verity,, and all who comes to be guided by it, you
will come to see that which unites you unto God, and one Nation to another, in
the Covenant of God! Oh that all your eyes were opened, that you might see that
which belongs to your peace and the well being of all Nations, that so the
power of the flock might be refreshed among you, and this I speak unto you, a
change must be witnessed in your selves, before you will cease acting in the
changeable mind, now the time draws near, the Lord will try you, for the Earth
must be left without excuse, and he will have all warned, for God will no
longer be limited, and therefore take heed how you gainsay any or resist any,
who may declare unto you the counsel of God, and cause them not to be
persecuted or hurt, but all be calm and moderate, and learn wisdom from
above, from him who has enlightened you, that you may come to deny your
selves, and follovv him who condems all self actings, and self will in man,
and all Customs, Laws, and Worships, and Traditions, that is made in the will
of man, that so he unto whom all power is committed may be feared, and
worshipped in spirit, in life, truth and righteousness, that so all sedition,
rebellion, treachery and unrighteousness may be cleansed out of the Earth, and
that all quarrelling, fighting, contention may end; and people come out of that
which the svvord is against, that so the svvords may be beat into Plovvshares,
and the spears into pruning hooks, that so violence may be done away, and
cruelty, svvept out of the Nations, that the dominion of God may be set over
all, and his truth advanced above all, that the Kingdoms of the World may
become the Lords, and his Christ's; and blessed are they that stoop unto his
Scepter, who judges the Nations in righteousness, and the people with equity,
who is the Salvat^on of all his people for evermore, and a hiding place in the
day of trouble.
