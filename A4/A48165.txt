A LETTER TO A FRIEND Concerning the Next PARLIAMENT'S Sitting at 0XF0RD.
Honest Tom,
HAving undergone the Gloomy Day and News of the Parliaments Dissolution, etc.
as also the good News that it is his Majesty's pleasure to Order my Lord
Chancellor to issue out. Writs in order to the Election of another, all I say
by the way is this, ( Cavete Angli) Look to it you Freeholders of England,
that you observe the good Advice contained in the Writ: But they are to Sit at
Oxford: And indeed, honest Tom, I think that in the time of the Sickness the
then Parliament sat at the said place. And alas! now Tom it is a sick State, a
sick Nation, a sick People, all sick, and to be feared near Death; And now to
Oxford again must the parliament go. But Tom do think London's Air to be
infected? I must confess, a bold Rogue of our Intimacy said, If it were, or any
Parts adjoining, it was then the Western end. But however, we know Oxford is a
clear Air, and a goodly Place, likewise a Sumptuous Theater for them to Act
their parts in, and so let 'um march thitherwards. And I with them all
Prosperity and Felicity, and withal that there may be no Rogues, pensioners,
or Fellows that love their Pockets better than their Country; which I
cordially wish for, who am,

Honest Tom, Thy Old Friend and Companion, Philanglus.
