The London Cuckolds.
An Excellent New Song, to an Old Tune, etc.
I.
GIve over, you Whiggs,
Your Protestant Jiggs,
Have a care of a TORY Coranto;
The Bully's at home,
Whilst abroad you do roame
To get Hands to your New Covenanto.
II.
He Enters with ease
The Fort if he please,
Mean time you are forced for a Ranto
Against King and State too,
To get One, at most Two,
To Subscribe to your New Covenanto.
III.
Your Baggs at one End
She Empties to Lend
To her Dear, because TORY Gallanto.
You the other End save
For that Goggle eyed Knave,
For to Swear to your New Covenanto.
IV.
If you smell her out,
Her Jury, no doubt,
But will bring in the Bill Ignoranto,
Whilst you take such pain
Ignoramus to gain,
For to stand by your New Covenanto.
V.
You grudge your selves Meat
At the Nine-penny Treat,
To encourage some Protestant Canto,
To abuse the brave Duke,
Or the TORYS rebuke,
Or to cry up the New Covenanto.
VI.
Bonny Lads your Caps Burn,
Round, a Round the Fire turn
With an Honest true TORY Coranto.
Jack Presbyter Roast,
The Great Polish Host,
With the Solemn League and Covenanto.
