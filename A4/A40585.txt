A Full and True RELATION Of a Maid living in Newgate-Street, in London: Who
was Buried on Saturday, the 27 of this instant December, and taken up (supposed
to be alive) the 30 of the same, being Buried near Christ-Church Hospital, in
the Churchyard of the same.
STrange and Wonderful are the Workings of Almighty God, as this present
Example may Testify, of a person who lived in Newgate-Street, in the quality of
a Servant, whose Name was Grace Ashburne, a Hartfordshire Woman, who was bound
an Apprentice to the Wife of one Mr. Beachcroft, a Tailor, who now lives in
King's Head Alley in Newgate-Street. The Wife of the person aforementioned was
to Instruct her in her Art and Trade, which was to the Calling of a Hood and
Scarf maker, which she did for a considerable time, although by relation of
the Neighborhood, with many dry rubs and blows (which might possibly hasten
her untimely End) although I shall not affirm it. This person, the Subject of
my Discourse was Buried on Christmas Eeve last, and was heard by several
Neighbors most lamentably to Groan and Cry out in her Grave, to the great
Astonishment of the Neighborhood; who upon Complaint occasioned her to be
taken out of her Grave, after she had been (like Lazarus,) Buried four days,
being taken up on Tuesday the 30 Instant: Upon her first taking out of the
Grave, several Credible persons affirm, That she was not only warm, but
breathed, to the great Astonishment of the Beholders; Upon which her Father
(who is now a Prisoner in the Fleet) caused her to be taken up as aforesaid,
where ^ome Hundreds of Spectators have been to view the Dead Corpse, amongst the
Multitude I my self was one, who dare affirm this, That she had a Color as
fresh as a Rose, nay more fresh than can possibly be conceived, yet on her Arms
she has several bruises, and a Scar on her Head, which was Reported to have
been given her by her unkind Master (through her Mistresses persuasion) some
Months before her Death (as they would have it believed.

Having been exposed to public view for several Hours, at a penny a piece
Charge, at a Smiths Shop in the Long Walk, near Christ's Church Hospital: She
was once more carried to her Last home (the Grave,) where the Jury sat on her,
who found the Case so foul, that through some means, (what I will not say) they
were contented to defer their Evidence, or bring in their Verdict until the
Twenty Third of January (next ensuing,) which is the utmost day limited for
their Verdict.

Her Father (or at leastwise, the Father of this Dead Corpse) (now in the Fleet)
having formerly taken Notice of the ill usage of his Daughter, although he
could not be active in his own person (being confined) yet he employed several
persons to enquire after the same, who brought him such a Relation that the
Corpse was immediately taken up for satisfaction of the World, who will not (as
is supposed) be so easily confirmed in the belief of her Master and Mistresses
Innocence, but that it may be proved further next Sessions.

The Jury who sat upon this Maid being Sixteen in Number, knew not what to say
in the Business; but whether through favor, affection or otherwise they have
deferred there Verdict for so long time let the Reader Judge,

This is certain and nothing but Truth, That in the time of this Maids
Servitude she was much abused, but being no Judge my self, I will no ways
determine whither this hastened her end, or shortened her days; I refer this to
God Almighty.

Although both Master and Mistress were very harsh to her, as themselves cannot
disown, unless they will Contradict the whole Neighborhood, yet going under
the Repute of an honest Man, and a Tailor; I shall not be so bold, as to tell
the World he sent her to her Long Home, though all the whole World besides
should so.

But to conclude, for certain the poor Wench is Dead, and her Master is living,
and her unkind Dame too, who each of them live in one House (for it is pity
they should be par^ed) in Newgate Street, in Kings head Alley, where any person
may be Informed of the Truth of this Relation, if a Lie do not give Check to
their Consciences.

For a Truth, this I dare affirm, the poor Girl was abused, and many times has
in the hearing of several, wished her self Rather to be buried alive, than to
live under such hard and severe usage, and how her Prayers have taken effect
let the World Judge.

Reader, this in a Word is the Naked Truth of this Relation, I might (I
Confess) Lengthen it out to a farther pitch, but not being willing to deviate
from the least Tittle of Truth, I have given thee in short the whole Business
at large, if it like thee, so; if not, tell me so, and I shall be satisfied.

Farewell.
