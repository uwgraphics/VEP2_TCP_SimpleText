BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CONFEDERATE CATHOLIQVES OF IRELAND
WHereas Colonel Owen O Neill, coming into this Kingdom, under pretense of
serving his Majesty, and his faithful Subjects the Confederate Catholics,
has been by the Supreme Council in Anno one thousand six hundred forty and
two, advanced unto the places of General and Governor of the Province of
Vlster, and upon receiving of his Pattent of those employments of great honor,
trust and command, solemnly took the Oath of Association usually taken by the
Confederate Catholics. And also an Oath to discharge those places with that
sincerity to the public, and obedience to the Government, as became a person
so highly entrusted. Nevertheless the said Owen O Neill, in breach of the said
trust, having proposed unto himself by the force of the Army under his
command, to destroy the present, and to introduce a new and Tyrannical
Government over the Lives, Estates and Liberties of his Majesty's faithful
Subjects, and to alienate them from their loyalty to the Crown of England,
has without warrant or authority contrary to the Laws of the Land, and the
establishments of all Assemblyes of the Confederate Catholics made and
appointed commanders in chief, several Lieutenant Generals, Colonells, and
other inferior commanders throughout the Kingdom, to raise Horse and Foot;
gathered and assembled together, all such as he thought inclined to his ways
of destruction, to whom for their better encouragement he gave them liberty
of plunder, and pillage, who did accordingly, actually pillage, plunder, and
rob his Majesty's Subjects in the Provinces of Leinster, Mounster, and
Connaght, and possessed himself and his party, of their Castles and Holts as
by woeful experience these five years past, the inhabitants of the said
Provinces have found.

And in pursuance of his wicked, and traiterous designs, and to the end to
bring the same to a full period, being thereunto encouraged through the want of
due and timely punishment for his past offenses and high misdemeanors, has
this present year shaked off, all manner of obedience to the Government
established among the Confederate Catholics; joined with Colonel Jones, a
Parliamentary, and adverse to his Majesty, and the said Confederate Catholics;
And in an hostile and rebellious manner marched with his said Army, killing,
burning, pillaging, plundering and destroying his Majesty's faithful Subjects,
besiged and took by force of Arms diverse of his Majesty's Castles, Forts, and
strong holts, committed and perpetrated all other Acts of hostility and
treason. And notwithstanding that all ways, and means possible tending to the
safety and quiet of the Kingdom, have been used by the Supreme Council
entrusted with the Government for the reducing and reclaiming of the said Owen O
Neill, and his accomplices from those his wicked, mallicious, and traiterous
Acts. Yet so far was he fixed upon those his resolutions, as he would not
admit any address to be made unto him, as by burning of the Counsels letters
sent to him and others the said Commanders of his Army, and menaces to hang the
messenger if he had come with any more messages to that purpose, and other
proofs appears, much less give care or agree to any manner of
accommodation, other then such as must of necessity prove destructive to
Religion, King, and Country, as by an exact account given to this Assembly by
the Supreme Council of their proceedings, and by the several other proofs
and testimonies, otherwise known to this Assembly plainly and manifestly
appears. Wherefore it is this day ordered, Decreed adjudged and established
by the said Assembly, that the said Owen O Neill is hereby, and shall be from
henceforth declared a Traitor, and Rebel, against our Sovereign Lord the
King, the Fundamental Laws of the Land, and a common disturber of the peace,
tranquillity, and quiet of this Kingdom, and a manifest opposer of the
established Government of the Confederate Catholics, contrary to his said
oath. And the said Assembly does hereby strictly charge and command, all
Generals and Governors of Provinces, Magistrates, High-Sheriffs, Governors of
Garrisons or Forts, Holts, and Castles Commanders, and all other officers
Civil and Martial, and all other his Majesty's faithful Subjects as well
within liberties, and Corporat Towns, as without under the command of the
Confederate Catholics, to proceed against and destroy the said Owen O Neill,
as an Enemy, and Traitor, on pain of being proceeded with themselves in case
of their wilful neglect herein as culpable of the said Treasons and capital
offenses aforesaid.

Given ^t Kilkenny, the thirtieth day of September, Anno Domini one thousand
six hundred forty and eight and in the four ^^d twentieth year of the Reign
of our Sovereign Lord CHARLES, by the grace of GOD, King of Eng^^^^, Ireland
(...) and Scotland, etc.
