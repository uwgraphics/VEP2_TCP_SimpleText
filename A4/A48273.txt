The Copy of the Letter sent from General Lesley to the Lord General the
Earl of Holland, and read in the House of Commons the 7th. of July 1641.
My Lord,
I Give your Lordship hearty thanks, that you have been pleased to acquaint me
with your arrival at York, I had some notice given me before by our
Commissioners of his Majesty's Command, and the desire of the Parliament for
that happy and peaceable service your Lordship is now about. I am glad that I
am at Dorrington by accident, in that place where I may give the more speed and
encouragement which your Lordship desires and expects from me. This shall be
done with all possible diligence;for as at the first the reason of sending any
Troops toward the Tees, was for the enlargement of their Quarter, and the
great ease of the rest of the Bishopric, so now the retiring shall be to take
away all Jealousy from the Army of our abode in this part of the Country; For
although the streightning of our Quarter will be both prejudicial to the
Country and us, yet God forbid it should be made a pretext to make the least
stay to the good work your Lordship has in hand.

And the further we remove from other, in this end we are the nearer to be
joined in all hearty affection for the service of the King.

Wherefore so sure grounds of hope are now laid, that all his Majesty's three
Kingdoms Enemies will have as much cause to fear the ill effects of our
Union, as they had matter of rejoicing at the too great appearance of the long
lasting discord between us.

And it may be so in all Ages to come, which is the hearty wish and prayer of,

Your Lordships most humble servant, H. LESLEY.
DORRINGTON 2o July 1641.
