arms armsBy the Mayor.
WHereas by often and sad experience I find that the great and holy name of God
in the breach of the Sabbath is much profaned, and the Gospel of Christ highly
scandalized by multitudes of loose, vain and idle persons, who walk in
More-fields and the fields near unto it, in a wandering and idle manner, and
often times resort to the tippling houses thereabouts, on the Sabbath day, to the
high dishonor and provocation of Almighty God: the breach of many good Laws,
and often times of the Peace and good Government of this City and places
adjacent, and considering it to be my duty to God and the souls of such poor
creatures, to do my uttermost in preventing so many great Evils as are
conceived in and brought forth from such a womb of sin as this is, which
seems to me to be the Devils nest wherein he sits and hatches a succession
of loose and carnal families, seasoning youth with such a wicked liberty that
when they come to be heads of families, they and their families walk in the
same paths, as if the keeping of a Sabbath to the Lord were no more but to lend
the ear for a little time to the sound of the Gospel, and presently after to
tempt the tempter by various objects, with vain and sinful Company and
converse, to steal the good word of God out of their hearts and heads. These
are therefore in the name of his Highness the Lord Protector of the
Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the dominions thereto
belonging, to will and require you to keep or cause to be kept a good and
sufficient watch on every Sabbath day, at every gate and passage in your Ward
that leads to the places aforesaid, and the same gates both great and small to
keep shut and not to suffer any to go out thereat from this City, without
giving a good account of the necessary occasions thereof to the Constable, who
is hereby required to attend and do his duty accordingly, and the Supervisors
in their respective places, are hereby desired some of them each Sabbath day to
see to the due observation hereof, and in special in the afternoones, and that
no young or loose Persons be admitted to go out of the City aforesaid, except
upon manifest and necessary occasions, and indeed that no person be admitted
except the work they go about shall be found to be agreeable to the holy
observance of the Sabbath day; And that this watch be kept every Sabbath until
sunset: And the Ministers of every Parish and Congregation within London and
the liberties thereof, are hereby desired to a frequent exhortation and
direction of their people unto a strict and due keeping holy of the Sabbath
day, and that all heads of families and Parents of children be enjoined
according to the Laws of God and man to keep in their Children and servants
from such wanderings on the days aforesaid, and be exhorted to unprove that
whole day to the benefit of the souls of themselves and families, keeping
themselves and families retired in their own houses, and there endeavor to
fix upon their hearts by meditation and repetition, what they have received
from the Lord in his word preached, and to bedew that good seed with the
prayers of faith, that so it may by a blessing from heaven bring forth an
hundred fold, to Gods glory and the advantage of their precious and eternal
souls, Against all which the Devil is a grand and subtle enemy, and
therefore tempts and draws to the former loose Conversation on that blessed
day for soule-advantage. And if any Parent, Master or Mistress shall have cause
to complain that after good example and exhortation accompanied with commands,
they cannot keep their Children and Servants to a due obedience of the Laws
before expressed, they are hereby required to bring all such offenders before
me or some other of the Justices of the peace within this City of London,
where they shall be dealt withal according to their merits and the due course
of Law. And it is hereby required that the same care be taken to prevent the
streets and lanes of this City from all manner of profanation of the Sabbath
day, and to these ends the Ministers of each Parish are enjoined some one
Sabbath day before the first of May next, to read in their Public
Congregations, the Laws to that purpose herewith sent them, and at such other
times as they may judge meet, and all Persons who by Law or Conscience are
obliged to see the due observation of this Precept, are hereby required to do
their duties herein.

Dated the 18 of March, 1656.
