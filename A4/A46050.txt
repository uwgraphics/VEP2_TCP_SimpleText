The Ignoramus Ballad.
To the Tune of, Let Oliver now be Forgotten.
1.
LEt Forty eight now be remembered,
And what was then Acted behold;
The High Court of Justice is tendered
To cast our Fate in the same Mold.
All things are prepared and ready,
The Faction Constant and steady,
At Moments call,
TO appear never dread ye;
And all the Proud Tories shall fall.
2.
Behold a whole College is coming,
In Equipage like to Sir Hue;
With Anger and Courage he is Foaming,
With Colors of Orange and Blew.
The Dray-mans Horse he has mounted,
And no small Fool is accounted
Amongst the Rabble,
He Swears the Anointed
He Will tumble down now like a Babel.
3.
With Blunderbuss, Sword and with Pistol,
With Powder and Bullet likewise;
By Treason and Force to resist all,
He doubts not of winning the Prize:
The King he will bring to his Lure,
Or else take him Prisoner be Sure,
Unto Guildhall;
Where he shall Endure,
Till he yield to the Parliaments ALL.
4.
But God, our Sovereign's Protector,
Against all his Enemies Train,
His timely Revealed the Projector,
And rendered their Plotting as Vain:
The Parliament soon He Dissolved,
Preventing our being Involved,
In the Old Snare,
As 'twas Resolved;
You see what such Traitors will dare.
5.
When Blunderbuss first was Accused,
And unto the Tower was sent;
The Jury of Rebels refused,
To find him, as 'twas their Intent.
But Honester men there were found out,
Resolving, so to bring it about
To find the Bill,
By giving the Rout
To all Ignoramus his Skill.
6.
And now he is brought to his Trial,
And Guilty of Treason is found;
Yet he had the Face to Deny-all,
There Is naught can his Treason Confound:
Old Nick's at his Elbow still Pressing,
And Frightens him from his Confessing:
He has no Hope,
By any Addressing,
To shelter his Neck from the Rope.
7
Now W -- e, that Hogshead of Treason,
With his Ignoramus, comes next;
Whose Jury I think will find Reason,
TO Invalid his Specious pretext.
The Idol (he says) must be pulled down
Of Whitehall, with His Scepter and Crown:
A Hector Bold,
Though seeming to Frown,
His Courage will quickly be Cold.
8.
Now D -- ld's come to the Trapp too*
For Falsely Suborning to Swear;
Great Lucifer's Chaplain is napt too,
And's Drawer must bring up the Rear:
The Parson may Preach in the Manger,
To free them all from the Danger;
But all in Vain,
Believe me, (a Stranger,)
The Hangman must open a Vein.
Printed for N. T. Anno Dom. 1681.
