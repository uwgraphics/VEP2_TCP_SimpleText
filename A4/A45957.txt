An INVITATION to a Solemn Day of HUMILIATION (viz. the third day of the
seventh Month, 57.) to the Lords People in the three Nations who are sensible
of the great dishonor of God; and desire to approve themselves Faithful to
God and his Work in this day of Division and Apostasy.
THe Lord God by a series of remarkable and extraordinary providence, has for
several years, given occasion to his People throughout these three Nations; as
to remember and praise him for his wonderful gracious dealings, so to make
inquiry into his wise and good ends; with the external causes of the late
strange and sad transactions among us; and of the lamentable and miserable
effects already appearing, and which must further unavoidably follow; if the
Lords rich grace even beyond our apprehensions does not prevent: We also
observing both in our selves and others, too too little sense of the great
dishonor of our good God, the burden of reproach and rebuke of Christ, his
Cause, Kingdom, People, Ways, and most glorious works ly under, (by reason of
the great sins of all sorts of Professors, and of the grievous Apostasy of
those who make themselves transgressors by building the things they had
destroyed, that God had heretofore made useful for the recovery of his People
and these Nations, out of the hands of their Persecutors and Oppressors;) we
say upon these considerations being met together to seek the face of God,
desirous to prove what is that good and acceptable will of his, it came into
our hearts to set a part one or more solemn days, to humble our souls for our
own, and the sins of all Gods People, which may provoke the eyes of his glory;
as also for the abominations of this day, and likewise to wrestle with the
Lord, for the great things of his Name, his Son and Syon: for which purpose, we
have agreed upon the 3. day of the next Month being the 7. commonly called
September, (being the fifth day of the week called Thursday) which we are
encouraged to recommend to all that fear the Lord, who desire to be preserved
from and to mourn under the evils of this Generation, that we might with one
accord, as one man call upon the name of the Lord: Whereunto we are the more
induced from the consideration of the commendable practice of the Lords People
formerly, as of Esther and Mordecai, Ezra, Nehemia; etc. as also the Lords
People of latter times, the good old Puritans, in the days of the Prelates;
and many of the Army, and others in the late Wars; Moreover, it is commanded
Esth 4.5. Ez. 8.213 Est. 9.3.5 Neh. 9.^. Zeph. 3.7. ^ach. 8.21, ^2.

Heb. 10.14, ^5.


and promised by the Lord, that his People shall pray and seek unto him
together, and serve him with one consent; and it is their duty by how much the
more the day of the Lord approaches, to assemble themselves together and be
provoking each other thereunto: Further, God seems to call upon us by his many
signs, which may presage the approaching of special mercies, or signal
judgments, With all, many or most of Gods People complain of a decay, and
declining, (especially of late) in this spiritual duty, by means whereof, their
hearts grow harder and straighter, and wickedness and worldliness abounds;
this also might be added, that there is no other door open, wherein we may
hope at this juncture, more to serve the will of God and our Generation, than
by a diligent and more than ordinary attending the throne of grace, until the
Lord have mercy, and reign righteousness upon us: And as a farther Provocation
to that duty of Prayer in general, we add the following Motives.

Because this is a day of trouble and rebuke, Psalm 50.15. Neh. 1.3, 4 Esaias
37.3, 4.

This is an hour of Temptation, Mat. 26.41. Luke 21.35, 36. And a day of
Apostasy, Jude 20. And prayer is a choice piece of the spiritual Armor,
Ephesians. 6.18. Prayer is Gods delight, Prove. 15. v. 18. Cant. 2.14.

It is of great power and prevalency with God, Genesis 32.26, 28. Exo. 32.10, 11,
14. Jam. 5.16. and has effected strange and mavelous things, Jam. 5.17, 18.
1 King. 18.36, 38. 2 King. 6.17, 18. Esaias 37.15 21, 22. and 36. 2 Chronicles. 14.11,
12. Acts 12.5, 6, etc.

Though God will deal graciously with his people, yet he waits to hear their
cry; Esa. 30.14. And as he has bound himself to give, so his People to ask, 1
King. 3.5. 2 Samuel 7.27. Psalm. 2.8. Psalm. 72. v. 8.15. Esa. 62.5, 6, 7. Ezekiel.
36.36, 37.

The People and Work of God want reviving, Ezra 9.8. Hab. 3.2. They are
destitute, Psalm. 102.17, 18. And are waiting as Daniel for Isreal's Redemption,
Dan. 9.2, 3, 4. And as Jehosaphat not knowing what to do save to have their
eyes to the Lord. This is a Command with special promises annexed, Jer. 33.3.
Luke 11.9, 10. Psalm 18.10. more particular: first, They that seek the Lord may
be hid and spared, in the day of his anger: Zeph. 2.3. Ezekiel. 9.4.6. Mal. 3.16,
17. Esa. 65.10. Secondly, They shall understand all things. Prove. 28.5. Jam.
1.5. Luke 11.13. Thirdly, Their hearts shall live, Ps. 69.32. and 22.26. And
they grow stronger whilst others faint and fail, Esa. 40.31. Fo^thly, They
shall be saved from their enemies. Psalm. 18.3. and 56.9. Fifthly, They shall
glorify God: Psalm. 22.26. and 50.15. Sixthly, They shall lack no good thing,
Psalm. 34.10. and 24.5, 6. Seventhly, They shall be delivered out of their
distresses, and led in a right way. Ps. 107.6, 7. Jer. 31.9.

Never any sought God in vain, Esa. 45.19. Psalm. 9.10.145.18, 19.

Having thus signified the thoughts and desires of our hearts, we shall leave
all to the Leading of Gods gracious Spirit: Not judging it convenient to point
out unto others, the particulars to be Prayed for. Though we find not only
our selves, but the generality of Saints, agreeing Mat. 18.19. Act. 2.1 2, etc.
to ask; the more full performance of the great Luke 24.49. Act. 1.4
Promise of the Father: even, Joel 2.28. Isa. 32.15.
the pouring out of the Spirit. That he would Isa. 25.7. Ha. 2.13, 14
destroy the face of the covering cast over all people; and the veil that is
cast over all Nations. In particular 2 Cor. 3.14 15, 16 Rom 11, 12.
the veil upon the hearts of the Jews, that they might turn to the Lord. So
Ps. 90.13 14, 15, 16, 17, and 80.14, 15.18.
the raising up of the hearts of the Lords People in his Work and Ways. And
the Hab. 3.2. Ezr. 9.8.
reviving of his great work which he had begun in these Nations. The Josh. 7.
Psalm. 125.4 5 and 140.11 1 King. 18, 17, 18, etc.
discovering and removing all the Achans and Troublers. The Rev. 18.4 Zach.
3.2. 2 Timothy 3.1, 2 5.
plucking all Zions Children out of Babylon. With the Isa. 57.14.
removing of all stumbling blocks out of their way. The Ps. 94.15. Isa. 61.11.
returning of judgment unto righteousness. The Ps. 133.1 Zep. 3.9.
2 Timothy 2.24. Mat. 25.4.10.
uniting of all the upright in heart, And making them meet for the masters use.
Briefly, the 2 These. 2.8 Rev. 18.21.
utter ruin of the whole Kingdom of the man of Sin. In order to Christ's Isa.
32.1.
Reigning in Righteousness over Rev. 15.3.
Saints and all Jer. 10.7. Dan. 7.14. Ps. 2.8. and 72.8.
Nations.
