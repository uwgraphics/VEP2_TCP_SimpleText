IGNORAMUS: An Excellent New Song.
To the Tune of, Lay by your Pleading, Law lies a bleeding.
[1]
SInce Reformation
With Whig's in Fashion,
There Is neither Equity nor Justice in the Nation.
Against their Furies,
There no such Cure is,
As lately has been wrought by Ignoramus-Juries.
Compaction of Faction,
That breeds all Distraction,
Is at the Zenith Point, but will not bear an Action.
They sham us, and flam us,
And ram us, and damn us,
And then, in spite of Law, come off with Ignoramus.
[2]
Oh, how they Plotted,
Brimighams Voted,
And all the Mobile the Holy Cause promoted.
They preached up Treason,
At every season,
And taught the Multitude Rebellion was but Reason,
With Breaches, Impeaches,
And most Loyal Speeches,
With Royal Blood again to glut the thirsty Leeches.
They sham us and flam us, etc.
[3]
It Is such a Jury
Would pass no Tory,
Were he as Innocent as a Saint in Glory:
But let a Brother
Ravish his Mother,
Assassinate his King, he would find no other.
They shamed, and blamed,
At Loyallists aimed;
But when a Whig's reprieved, the Town with Beacons flamed.
They sham us, and flam us, etc.
[4]
This Ignoramus
With which they sham us,
Would find against a York, to raise a M(...)th-amus
Who clears a Traitor;
And a King Hater
Against his Lawful Prince would find sufficient matter.
They sought it, and wrought it,
Like Rebels they fought it,
And with the price of Royal Martyrs blood they bought it.
They sham us, and flam us,etc.
[5]
At the Old Bailey,
Where Rogues flock daily,
A greater Traitor far then Coleman, White or Staley,
Was late Indicted,
Witnesses cited,
But then he was set free; so the King was righted.
Against Princes, Offenses
Proved in all senses;
But against a Whig there is no Truth in Evidences.
They sham us, and flam us, etc.
[6]
But wot you what, Sir?
They found it not, Sir;
'Twas every Jurors Case, and there lay all the Plot, Sir.
For at this season,
Should they do reason,
Which of themselves should escape, if they found it Treason?
Compassion in fashion,
The Interest of the Nation:
Oh, what a Godly point is self-preservation!
They sham us, and flam us, etc.
[7]
Alas what is Conscience
In Baxter's own sense,
When Interest lies at stake, an Oath and Law is Nonsense.
Now they will banter
Quaker and Ranter,
To find a Royallist, and clear a Covenanter.
They Will wrangle and brangle,
The Soul entangle,
To save the Traitors Neck from the old Triangle.
They flam us, and sham us, etc.
[8]
Alas! for pity
Of this good City,
What will the Tories say in their Drunken Dity?
When all Abettors,
And Monarch Haters,
The Brethren damned their Souls to save malicious Traitors.
But mind it, long winded,
With prejudice blinded,
Lest what they did reject, another Jury find it.
Then sham us, and flam us,
And ram us, and damn us,
When against King and Law you find an Ignoramus.
