THE PREFACE TO THE READER
SEeing Things of this Nature are n^^ held pleasant but profitable, by inabling
the Ingenious Reader, to put them i^ practice, I conceived it not amiss to
Collect such Curiosities as are not vulgarly known; the which, if rightly
observe^ in their respective Places and Offices must, in all probability,
Redound to the Advantage and Accomplishment of either Sex. Wherefore not longer
to detain yo^ with a Preface, I proceed to what is nonmaterial. And first of

Salads and their Seasons.
As for Salads, they are various, according to the season; as Corn, Salads and
Pickles with ^ndive and French Grand Salads in Winter; and ^ettice, Spinach,
Purslain and Salads of Flowers, (...) Summer. Wherefore there being no certain
Rule of this kind but the Management, according to the humor and liking of the
Party, I shall submit it to the discretion of the Ingenious Cook, ^o from
Salads according to the Season or Quality of the Meats, for the best digestion;
of which ^^ey are prepared. And so proceed to Pastry, (...) useful and
necessary tobe known.

Things to be observed in Raising of Paste, etc.
In Raising of Paste, observe that your flo^^^ or stuff be sweet and good; and
that in rais^^ the sides, ascend taper-wise; that they be kn^^^ ed and molded
to a sufficient firieness and sti^^ ness, not to fall or give way by jetting
out (...) cracking, whereby the materials or fillings man be spoiled or lost,
either by taking too much A^^ or running about in the Oven: Wherefore i^ making
them up, an especial care must be had that all parts are framed alike, and to
be (...) with Liquor tolerably hot, that so the Paste the be more firmly
settled, especially if designed (...) large Pyes: the fashion of which, though
in th^^ kind there are diverse Forms may be suitable t^ the fancy of the maker.
And having said th^^ much of the Outside, I shall proceed to spea^^ of the
Inside, which is the most material.

AVenison-Pasty, how to make it.
Take a side of new Venison, bone it and ^^^ son it well with Pepper and Salt:
beat it wit^ your Roaler into the form you design it, and clo^^ up the lid or
over-bearing, having first put in (...) considerable quantity of Butter to
prevent d^yness; and if you please you may put in Fruit, (...) though it be not
usual.

To make an Oyster-Pye.
Your Coffin or Crust being raised, lay a lay of Butter; and then having
parboiled your Oy^ters, put them in order, and over them another ^aying of
Butter, with some Pepper and Nutmeg; and so close up the lid.

To make a Beef-Pasty appear like Venison.
Take your Beef indifferently lean, beat it in ^^lces with a Roaling-pin, with
some sweet Herbs ^^all shread; then lay it in Pepper and Salt a light and a
day; after which lay it in the coffin, and over it Butter or Marrow; then add,
to keep it moist, a small quantity of Claret, and it will be perfect, short and
red, like Venison, as has been proved.

A Goose-Pye, to make.
Observe to take a fat Goose, take out the Breast^one, and as many other bones
as you can conveniently: flat and beat the Carcass with your Roaler into the
best form, then with Pepper and Salt powder it: lay then a laying of Butter at
the bottom, on which place the Goose and a couple of Rabits, if you think fit;
and sprinkling them with Pepper, lay on more Butter, and close ^it up.

An Artichoke-Pye, to make.
Take the bottoms of Artichokes boiled, lay under them a laying of Marrow, and
the like over them; then a laying of Dates, Raisins an^ Currants, and close it
up.

An Eel-Pye in the French fashion.
Take large silver Eels, strip and cleanse them* cutting them in convenient
lengths; Salt an^ Pepper them, and shread a good quantity (...) sweet Herbs:
mix the Herbs with the Powder of Cinnamon, and some beaten Cloves; so lay them
in order upon a laying of Butter, and clos^ them up.

A Neats-Tongue Pie, how to make.
Take a couple of boiled Neats-Tongues, skin them well, and mince them with
Marrow or Beessuet; then add of Raisins and Currants, each (...) pound; Butter
the like quantity; and Malagowine half a pint, making them up in order.

To make a Pippin, or any Apple-Tart.
Take the Apples, pare them, cut them into four quarters, taking out the core,
and lay on (...) laying of Sugar; place them in order; slice amongst them some
Quinces and candied Lemon or Orange-peel; and covering them again with Sugar,
lid it up.

A Custard, the French fashion.
Take Cream two quarts, Saffron dissolved (...) ^^rained a dram, Canary half a
pint, Rose-w^^^ ^alf a quarter, and Loaf-sugar a pound: ^^^ them well, and put
them into the coffin.

Goosberry-Tarts, Plumb-Tarts, etc. how to Fill.
Take your Goosberrys or Plumbs green, sto^ them, if you may conveniently, soak
them in S^^ar and Water, and after place them on a layin^ of Sugar, and cover
them with the like: and so you may do by any suchlike Fruits.

Broths and Jellies being wonderful useful, I shall say something of them.

Jelly of Calves-feet, to make.
Take Calves-feet, without the bones, and boil them in a quart of White Wind,
and a quart of Mutton-broth, till a third part be consumed: ^ress out the
liquid part, and season it with Cina^on and Sugar.

Cock-Broth, how to make it.
Take a Cock of a year old, pull and draw him, beat him then with the Roaler,
s^asoning him with ^alt and a little Pepper: put him into two gal^^ns of
Mutton-broth, adding a quart of French ^arley, and with beaten Nutmeg, Mace,
and ^^eet Herbs; boil it till it will become like (...) ^elly, when cold.

China-Broth, to make.
Take a gallon of Running-water, boil in it a Cock chick till it is mash; then
add Raisins, Li^orish, French Barley and beaten Cloves, and strain out the
liquid part for your use.

Jelly of Hartshorn, to make it.
Take the shavings of that Horn, four ounces; steep and boil it in a gallon of
Water; strain it, and add chop't Rosemary, the Whites of Eggs* Rose Water and
Sugar, and bring them up together, suffer them to stand till cold.

A Restoring Ca^dle, to make.
Take four Eggs, a dram of Saffron, half a pint of Canary, six Dates, a pint of
Cream, two ounces of Loaf-sugar, and an ounce of Licorish-powder: boil them
together.

To Pickle Cucumbers, Broom-buds, Ash-keys, Grapes, (...) Plumbs, French-Beans,
Barberries, Mushrooms, (...) Sampher, and the like: take the following Rule.
Get a sufficient quantity of good Wine-Vine^r, boil it and scum it till no
more scum arise; ^dding to it a handful or two of Spanish-Salt, ^loves, Mace,
Ginger, Cinnamon, Dill and Cori^nder-seed, with whole Pepper and a piece of
Al^^m, and putting any of the things before-men^oned, or any other things
usually Pickled, and it will preserve them green and sound: or for Bar^erries
and Sampher, you may put Salt and Wa^^r only.

As for the decent Management of a Table, ^bserve that the Boiled Meats be
presented first (...) Course, the Roasted next, and the Baked after them; and
lastly, Pyes, Tarts, and Dishes of Fruit ^r Sweetmeats; ever taking notice to
place the (...) Dishes with the right end-forward, toward the upper end of the
Table; The head-end of ^owl, Coneys, Pigs, Fish, etc. being the right ^nds; And
of Joints of Meat, the Butt or great End; and of Piggs, the picked Ends,
according ^o their frame or fashion.

To dismember a Hern, Take off both the Legs, and lacing it down the Breast,
raise the flesh, and ^ake it clean off, placing the Wings that they may ^^et.

To unbrace a Mallard, Raise up the Pinion a^^ the Leg, not taking them off;
Raise the Mer^^ thought from the Breast, and lace it down slo^^ wise with a
Knife; the best piece being th^^ Wing.

To unlace a Coney, Draw the Knife do^^ wards, cut off the flaps of the Belly,
and take (...) the Shoulders, Legs, and divide the Body in fo^^ parts; the best
piece to present, being held th^^ next to the Tail.

To Rear a Goose, The Leg must be opene^ the Wings divided, and the Breast
laced dow^ the Body, after they are taken off to be divided (...) the best
piece is the Merry-thought.

A Bustard or Turkey must be used as the Goose; and indeed it is a way now in
use for a^^ manner of Fowl, especially Tame ones; the Me^ry-thought and Legs of
which are accounted the best piece to present, as the Wings of all Wild fowl
are on the contrary. In Fish, that part ne^^ to the Head is the best: And in
Flesh, the middl^ of the Loin, Breast, Neck, and inside of the Leg or Shoulder,
and in other pieces, that which i^ lean and fat, as fancy or discretion may
easily direct.

^he Art of Conserving, Preserving, Candying and Beautifying, etc.
TO Conserve any Fruits, Herbs, Flowers or Roots, Take a like quantity of them,
as of ^^gar; stamp them in a Mortar, and put them ^^ cold in a Glass or
Gally-pot, keeping it from ^^e Air, and they will retain their taste and co^ur
a twelvemonth.

Preserving is no other then to take Fruits, Flow^^s, or the like, and scalding
them over a gentle ^re, with or without the stones, in a Preserving^an, and
then the Sugar to the like quantity dis^olved, put hot to them, with a small
quantity of Water or Quidany of the Fruit, and stopping them ^lose up.

Candying is when the Fruits are prepared ^reen, and somewhat hard, the Sugar
being melt^d in the Pan to a hardness or candy, they are dip^ed into them: As
for Example.

To Conserve Roses.
Take off the Flower, or Red part, put them to ^eep in Water or White Wind;
then stamp them ^o a moisture, and put of the best Sugar to the weight of the
Roses, making them up into a Conserve for your use.

To Preserve Cherries.
Take Cherries, not too ripe, and having bo^^ up your Sugar with the Quidany or
Pulp of oth^^ Cherries; and having made it very hot, pu^^ Cherries in, Stalks
and all: Some there are (...) stone them, but I hold it not necessary.

The Art of Candying Plumbs.
Take Plumbs but indifferently ripe, or some what inclining to greenish; and
having made Candy of Sugar, after you have softened them (...) scalding, dip
them in, or let them lay a while they will take the Sugar, and keep in a
perfe^^ Candy all the year, if well dried.

An Excellent Beautifying-Wash to make the Face an^ Hands fair, and take out
any Spots or Deformit^ in the Skin.
Take of Allom powder an ounce, Benjamine water a pint, the Flower of Rosemary
a handfu^^ Scabeous-water half a pint, Bean-flower a hand full, Copras half an
ounce: heat and mix the^ over a fire, and by often using you will find the
wondrous effects.

FINIS.
