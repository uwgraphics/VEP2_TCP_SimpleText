The School of the Heart.
The INTRODVCTION.
Turn in, my mind, wander no more abroad,
Here Is work enough at home, lay by that load
Of scattered thoughts that clogs and cumbers
Resume thy long neglected liberty (thee)
Of selfe-examination: bend thine eye
Inward, consider where thine heart does lie,
How it is affected, how it is busi'd: look
What thou have writ thy self in thine own book,
Thy conscience:-here set thou thy self to school.
Selfe-knowledge 'twixt a wise man and a fool
Does make the difference: he that neglects
This learning, sideth with his own defects.
Do thou draw back? Has custom charmed thee so,
That thou can relish nothing but thy woe?
Find'st thou such sweetness in those sugared lies?
Have forain objects so ingrost thine eyes?
Can thou not hold them off? Have thou an ear
To listen but to what thou should not hear?
Art thou incapable of every thing,
But what thy senses to thy fancy bring?
Remember that thy birth and constitution
Both promise better then such base confusion.
Thy birth's divine, from heaven; thy composure
Is spirit, and immortal; thine enclosure
In walls of flesh not to make thee debtor
For house-roome to them, but to make them better.
Thy body's thy freehold, live then as the Lord,
No tenant to thine own: some time afford
To view what state it is in: survey each part,
And above all take notice of thine heart.
Such as that is the rest is, or will be,
Better or worse, blameworthy or fault-free.
What? are the ruins such thou art affrai'd,
Or else ashamed, to see how it is decai'd?
Is It therefore thou art loath to see it such,
As now it is, because it is so much,
Degenerated now from what it was,
And should have been? Thine ignorance, alas,
Will make it nothing better, and the longer
Evils are suffered grow, they grow the stronger.
Or has thine understanding lost its light?
Has the dark night of error dimmed thy sight
So that thou can not, though thou would, observe
All things amiss within thee, how they swerve
From the straight rules of righteousness and reason?
If' so, omit not then this precious season.
It Is yet school time, as yet the doore's not shut.
Hark how the Master calls. Come let us put
Up our requests to him, whose will alone
Limits his power of teaching, from whom none
Returns unlearned, that has once a will
To be his scholar, and implore his skill.
Great scearcher of the heart, whose boundless sight
Discovers secrets, and does bring to light
The hidden things of darkness, who alone
Perfectly know all things that can be known.
Thou know I do not, cannot, have no mind
To know mine heart: I am not only blind,
But lame, and listlesse: thou alone can make
Me able, willing: and the pains I take,
As well as the success, must come from thee,
Who workest both to will and do in me:
Having now made me willing to be taught,
Make me as willing to learn what I ought.
Or, if thou will allow thy scholar leave
To choose his lesson, lest I should deceive
My self again, as I have done too often,
Teach me to know mine heart. Thou, thou, can soften
Lighten, enliven, purify, restore,
And make more fruitful, then it was before,
Its hardness, darkness, death, uncleanness, loss,
And barrenness: refine it from the dross,
And draw out all the dregs, heal every sore,
Teach it to know it self, and love thee more.
Lord, if thou will, thou can impart this skill:
And for all other learning take it who will.

The Infection of the Heart.
ACTS 5.3. Why has Satan filled thine heart?
Epigr. 1.
WHilst thou enclin'st thy Voyce-envcigled ear,
The subtle Serpents Syren-Songs to hear,
Thy heart drinks deadly poison drawn from bell,
And with a Vip'rous broed of sin does swell.
ODE 1.
The Soul.

1.
Profit, and pleasure, comfort, and content,
Wisdom, and honor, and when these are spent
A fresh supply of more! Oh heavenly words!
Are these the dainty fruits, that this fair tree affords
The Serpent.

2.
Yes these, and many more, if more may be,
All, that the world contains, in this one tree
Contracted is. Take but a taste, and try,
Thou may believe thy self, experience can not lie.
The Soul.

3.
But thou may lie: and with a false pretense
Of friendship rob me of that excellence,
Which my Creators bounty has bestowed,
And freely given me, to whom he nothing owed.
The Serpent.

4.
Strange composition! so credulous,
And at the same time so suspicious!
This is the tree of knowledge, and until
Thou eat thereof, how can thou know what is good or ill?
The Soul.

5.
God infinitely good my maker is,
Who neither will, nor can, do ought amiss.
The being I received was that he sent,
And therefore I am sure must needs be excellent:
The Serpent.

6.
Suppose it be: yet doubtless he that gave
Thee such a being must himself needs have
A better far, more excellent by much:
Or else be sure that he could not have made thee such.
The Soul.

7.
Such as he made me I am well content
Still to continue: for, if he had meant
I should enjoy a better state, he would
As easily as not have given it, if he would.
The Serpent.

8.
And is it not all one, if he have given
Thee means to get it? must he still be driven
To new works of creation for thy sake?
Will thou not what he sets before thee daine to take?
The Soul.

9.
Yes, of the fruits of all the other trees
I freely take and ear: they are the sees
Allowed me for the dressing by the Maker:
But of this satall fruit I must not be partaker.
The Serpent.

10.
And why? what danger can it be to eat
That which is good being ordained for meat?
What will thou say? God made it not for food?
Or dur'st thou think that made by him it is not good
The Soul.

11.
Yes, good it is, no doubt, and good for meat:
But I am not allowed thereof to eat.
My Makers prohibition under pain
Of death the day I eat thereof, makes me refrain.
The Serpent.

12.
Faint-hearted fondling, can thou fear to dye,
Being a Spirit and immortal? Fie.
God knows this fruit once eaten will refine
Thy groster parts alone, and make thee all divine.
The Soul.

13.
There Is something in it sure: were it not good,
It had not in the midst of th'garden stood:
And being good, I can no more refrain
From wishing, then then I can the fire to burn restrain
14.
Why do I trifle then? what I desire
Why do I not? Nothing can quench the fire
Of longing but fruition. Come what will,
Eat it I must, that I may know what is good and ill.
The Serpent.

15.
So, thou art taken now: that resolution
Gives an eternal date to thy confusion.
The knowledge thou have got of good, and ill,
Is of good gone, and past, of evil present still.

The taking away of the Heart.
HOS. 4. 11. Whoredom and wine, and new win take away the Heart.
Epigr. 2.
BAse lust and luxury the scumme and d^osse
Of hell-borne pleasures, please thee to the loss
Of thy souls precious eyesight, reason; ^
Mind^sse thy mind, hear^ ^ heart does grow.

ODE 2.
1.
Laid down already? and so fast asleep?
Thy precious heart left loosly on thime hand,
Which with all diligence thou should keep,
And guard against those enemies, that stand
Ready prepared to plunge it in the deep
Of all distress? Rouse thee, and understand
In time, what in the end thou must confess,
That misery at last and wretchedness
Is all the fruit that springs from slothful idleness.
2.
Whilst thou list soaking in security,
Thou drown'st thy self in sensuail delight,
And wallow'st in debauched luxury,
Which when thou art awake and see, will fright
Thine heart with horror. When thou shall de^cry
By the daylight the danger of the night,
Then, then, if not too late, thou will confess,
That endless misery and wretchedness
Is all the fruit that springs from riotous excess.
3.
Whilst thou do pamper thy proud flesh, and thrust
Into thy panch the prime of all thy store,
Thou do but gather fuel for that lust,
Which boiling in thy liver runs over,
And frieth in thy throbbing veins, which must
Needs vent, or burst, when they can hold no more.
But oh consider what thou shall confess
At last, that misery and wretchedness
Is all the fruit that springs from lustful wantonness.
4.
Whilst thou do feed effeminate desires
With spumy pleasures, whilst fruition
The coals of lust fannes into flaming fires,
And spurious delights thou doatest on,
Thy mind through cold remissness even expires,
And all the active vigor often is gone.
Take heed in time, or else thou shall confess
At last that misery and wretchedness
Is all the fruit that springs from carelesse-mindednesse.
5.
Whilst thy regardlesse sense-dissolved mind
Lies by unbent, that should have been thy spring
Of motion, all thy headstrong passions find
Themselves let loose, and follow their own swing,
Forgetful of the great account behind,
As though there never would be such a thing,
But, when it comes indeed, thou will confess
That misery alone and wre^hednesse
Is all the fruit that springs from soul forgetfulness.
6.
Whilst thou remembrest not thy later end,
Nor what a reckoning one day thou must make,
Putting no difference betwixt foe and friend,
Thou suffer'st hellish Fiends thine heart to take,
Who, all the while thou triflest, do attend,
Ready to bring it to the burning lake
Of fire and brimstone: where thou shall confess
That endless misery and wretchedness
Is all the fruit that springs from stupid heartlesnesse.
Emblem 3.


The darkness of the Heart.
ROMANS 1.21. Their foolish heart was darkened.
Epigr. 3.
SVch cloudy shadows have eclipsed thine heart
As Nature cannot parallel nor Art:
Vnlessethou take my light of truth to guide thee,
Blackness of darkness will at last betide thee.

ODE 3.
1.
Tarry, O tarry, lest thine heedlesse have
Hurry thee headlong unto hell at last:
See, see, thine heart's already halfway there,
Those gloomy shadows, that encompasse it,
Are the vast confines of the infernal pit.
O stay, and if thou love not light, yet fear
That fatal darkness, where
Such danger does appear.
2.
A night of ignorance has overspread
Thy mind and understanding: thou art led
Blindfolded by unbridled passion:
Thou wand rest in the crooked ways of error,
Leading directly to the King of terror:
The course thou take, if thou hold on,
Will bury thee anon
In deep destruction.
3.
Whilst thou art thus deprived of thy ^ight,
Thou know no difference between noone and night,
Though the Sun shine, yet thou regard'st it not.
My love-alluring beauty cannot draw thee,
Nor does my mind-amating terror awe thee:
Like one that had both good and ill forgot,
Thou carest not a jot
What falls to thy lot.
4.
Thou art become unto thy self a stranger,
Observest not thine own desert, or danger,
Thou know not what thou do, nor can thou tell
Whither thou go: shooting in the dark
How can thou ever hope to hit the mark?
What expectation have thou to do well,
That art content to dwell
Within the verge of hell?
5.
Alas, thou have not so much knowledge left,
As to consider that thou art bereft
Of thine own eyesight. But thou runn'st, as though
Thou saw all before thee: whilst thy mind
To nearest necessary things is blind.
Thou know nothing as thou ought to know,
Whilst thou esteemest so
The things that are below.
6.
Would ever any, that had eyes, mistake
As thou art wont to do: no difference make
Betwixt the way to heaven and to hell?
But, desperately devoted to destruction,
Rebel against the light, abhor instruction?
As though thou did desire with death to dwell,
Thou hate to hear tell
How yet thou may do well.
7.
Oh that thou did but see how blind thou art,
And seel the dismal darkness of thine heart:
Then would thou labor for, and I would lend
My light to guide thee: that is not light alone,
But life, eyes, sight, grace, glory, all in one.
Then should thou know whither those by ways bend,
And that death in the end
On darkness does attend.
Emblem 4.


The absence of the Heart.
PROVE. 17. 16. Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
wisdom, seeing he bath no heart to it?
Epigr. 4.
Had thou an heart, thou fickle Fugitive,
How would thine heart hate and disdain to live
Mindful of such vain trifles, as these be,
Resting forgetful of it self and me?

ODE 4.
The Soul.

1.
Brave, dainty, curious, rare, rich, precious things!
Able to make fate-blasted mortals blessed,
Peculiar treasures, and delights for Kings,
That having power of all would choose the best.
How do I hug mine happiness that have
Present possession of what others crave?
Christ.

2.
Poor, silly, simple, sense-besotted soul,
Why do thou hug thy self-procured woes?
Release thy freeborne thoughts, at least control
Those passions, that enslave thee to thy foes.
How would thou hate thy self, if thou did know
The baseness of those things thou prizest so!
The Soul.

3.
They talk of goodness, virtue, piety,
Religion, honesty, I know not what;
So let them talk for me: so long as I
Have goods and lands, and gold, and jewels, that
Both equal and excel all other treasure,
Why should I strive to make their pain my pleasure
Christ.

4.
So Swine neglect the pearls that lie before them,
Trample them under foot, and feed on draffe:
So fools gild rotten Idols, and adore them,
Cast all the corn away, and keep the chafe.
That ever reason should be blinded so,
To graspe the shadow, let the substance go!
The Soul.

5.
All Is but opinion that the world accounts
Matter of worth: as this or that man sets
A value on it, so the price amounts:
The sound of strings is vari'd by the frets.
My mind's my kingdom: why should I withstand,
Or question that, which I my self command?
Christ.

6.
Thy tyrant passions captivate thy reason:
Thy lusts usurp the guidance of the mind:
Thy sense-led fancy barters good for geason:
Thy seed is vanity, thine harvest wind:
Thy rules are crooked, and thou writ'st awry:
Thy ways are wandering, and thine end to die.
The Soul.

7.
This table sums me myriads of pleasure:
That book enroules mine honors inventory:
These bags are stuffed with millions of treasure:
Those writings evidence my state of glory:
These bells ring heavenly music in mine ears,
To drown the noise of cumbious cares and fear.
Christ.

8.
Those pleasures one day will procure thy pain:
That which thou glorist in will be thy shame:
Thou Wilt find thy loss in what thou thought thy gain:
Thine honor will put on another name.
That music in the close will ring thy knell,
In stead of heaven toll thee into hell.
9.
But why do I thus wast my words in vain
On one, that is wholly taken up with toys,
That will not loose one dram of earth to gain
A full eternal weight of heavenly joys?
All Is to no purpose, it is as good forbear,
As speak to one, that has no heart to hear.
Emblem 5.


The vanity of the Heart.
JOB 15.31. Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity, for vanity shall be
his recompense.
Epigr. 5.
AMbitious bellows with the wind of honor
Puff up the swelling heart, that dotes upon her:
Which filled with empty vanity breaths forth
Nothing, but such things as are nothing worth.

ODE 5.
1.
The bane of kingdoms, worlds disquieter,
Hells heir apparent, Satan's eldest son,
Abstract of ills, refined Elixir,
And quintessence of sin, Ambition,
Sprung from the infernal shades, inhabits here,
Making man's heart its horrid mansion,
Which, though it were of vast content before,
Is now puffed up, and swells still more and more.
2.
Whole armies of vain thoughts it entertaines,
Is stuffed with dreams of kingdoms and of Crowns,
Presumes of profit without care or pains,
Threatens to baffle all its foes with frowns,
In every bargain makes account of gains,
Fancies such frolic mirth, as choakes and drownes
The voice of conscience, whose loud alarmes
Cannot be hard for pleasures countercharmes.
3.
Were not for anger and for pity, who
Could choose but smile to see vaineglorious men
Racking their wits, straining their finewes so,
That through their transparent thinness, when
They me^ with Wind and Sun, they quickly grow
Riv'led and dry, shrink till they crack again,
And all but to seem greater then they are:
Stretching their strength they lay their weakness bare
4.
See how hells Fueller his bellows plies,
Blowing the fire, that burnt too fast before:
See how the furnace flames, the sparkles rise
And spread themselve abroad still more and more:
See how the doting soul has fixed her eyes
On her dear fooleries, and does adore
With hands and heart lift up those trifling toys,
Wherewith the devil cheates her of her joys.
5.
Alas, thou art deceived, that glittering crown,
On which thou gazest, is not gold but grief,
That scepter sorrow: if thou take them down,
And try them, thou shall find what poor relief
They could afford thee, though they were thine own,
Did thou command even all the world in chief,
Thy comforts would abate, thy cares increase,
And thy perplexed thoughts disturb thy peace.
6.
Those pearls so through pierced, and strung together,
Though jewels in thine eyes they may appear,
Will prove continued perils, when the weather
Is clouded once, which yet is fair and clear.
What will that fan, though of the finest feather,
Steed thee, the brunt of winds and storms to bear?
Thy flagging colors hang their drooping head,
And the shrill trumpets sound shall strike thee dead.
7.
Were all those balls, which thou in sport do toss,
Whole worlds, and in thy power to command,
The gain would never countervaile the loss,
Those slippery globes will glide out of thine hand,
Thou can have no fast hold but of the cross,
And thou will fall, where thou do think to stand.
Forsake these sollies then, if thou will live:
Timely repentance may thy death reprive.
Emblem 6.


The oppression of the Heart.
LVKE 21.34. Take heed lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with
surfeiting and drunkenness.
Epigr. 6.
Two massy weights, Surfciting, Drunkenness,
Like mighty logs of lead, do so oppress
The heav'n-borne hearts of men, that to aspire
Upwards they have nor power nor desire.

ODE. 6.
1.
Monster of sins! See how th'inchanted soul
O'rcharg'd already calls for more.
See how the hellish skinker plies his bowl,
And's ready furnished with store,
Whilst cups on every side
Planted attend the tide.
2.
See how the piled dishes mounted stand,
Like hills advanced upon hills,
And the abundance both of sea and land
Does not suffice, even what it fills,
Man's dropsy appetite,
And Cormorant delight.
3.
See how the poisoned body s puffed, and swelled,
The face enflamed glowes with heat,
The limbs unable are themselves to welld,
The pulses deaths alarm do beat:
Yet man sits still, and laughs,
Whilst his own bane he quaffes.
4.
But where is thine heart the while, thou senseless sot?
Look how it lies crushed, and quelled,
Flat beaten to the board, that it cannot
Move from the place, where it is held,
Nor upward once aspire
With heavenly desire.
5.
Thy belly is thy God, thy shame thy glory,
Thou mindest only earthly things;
And all thy pleasure is but transitory,
Which grief at last and sorrow brings:
The courses thou do take
Will make thine heart to ache.
6.
Is It not enough to spend thy precious time
In empty idle complement,
Unless thou strain (to aggravate thy crime)
Nature beyond its own extent,
And force it to devour
An age within an hour?
7.
That which thou swallow'st is not lost alone,
But quickly will revenged be,
^ on thine heart, which like a stone
Lies buried in the amidst of thee,
Both void of common sense
And reasons excellence.
8.
Thy body is diseases rendevouze,
Thy mind the market place of vice,
The devil in thy will keeps open house,
Thou liv'st, as though thou would entice
Hell torments unto thee,
And thine own devil be.
9
Oh, what a dirty dunghill art thou grown,
A nasty stinking kennell foul!
When thou awak'st and see what thou have done,
Sorrow will swallow up thy soul,
To think how thou art foiled,
And all thy glory spoiled.
10.
Or if thou can not be ashamed, at least
Have some compassion on thy self:
Before thou art transformed all to beast,
At last strike sail, avoid the shelf,
Which in that gulse does lie,
Where all that enter die.
Emblem 7.


The covetousness of the Heart.
MAT. 6.21. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Epigr. 7.
Do thou enquire, thou heartlesse wanderer,
Where thine heart is? Behold, thine heart is here.
Here thine heart is, where that is, which above
Thine own dear heart thou do esteem, and love.

ODE. 7.
1.
See the deceitfulness of sin,
And how the devil cheateth worldly men:
They heap up riches to themselves, and then
They think they cannot choose but win,
Though for their parts
They stake their hearts.
2.
The Merchant sends his heart to sea
And there together with his ship it is tossed:
If this by chance miscarry, that is lost,
His considence is cast away:
He hangs the head,
As he were dead.
3.
The Pedlar cries, What do you lack?
What will you buy? and boasts his wares the best:
But offers you the refuse of the rest,
As though his heart lay in his pack,
Which greater gain
Alone can draine.
4.
The Plowman furrows up his land,
And sowes his heart together with his seed,
Which both alike earth-borne on earth do feed,
And prosper or are at a stand:
He and his field
Like fruit do yield.
5.
The Broker, and the Scriv'ner have
The Us'rers heart in keeping with his bands:
His souls dear sustenance lies in their hands,
And if they break their shop's his grave.
His interest is
His only bliss.
6.
The Money-horder in his bags
Binds up his heart, and locks it in his chest;
The same key serves to that, and to his breast,
Which of no other heaven brags:
Nor can conceit
A joy so great.
7.
So for the greedy Landmunger:
The Purchases he makes in every part
Take livery and seifin of his heart:
Yet his insatiate hunger,
For all his store,
Gapes after more.
8.
Poor wretched Muckwormes, wipe your eyes,
Uncase those ^ that be^ot you so:
Your rich appearing wealth is real woe,
Your death in your de^res lies.
Your hearts are where
You love, and fear.
9.
Oh, think not then the world deserves
Either to ^e beloved, or feared by you:
Give heaven these affections as its due,
Which always what it has preserves
In perfect bliss
That endless is.
Emblem 8.


The hardness of the Heart.
ZECH. 7. 12. They made their hearts as an adamant stone, lost they should
bear the Law.
Epigr. 8.
WOrds move thee not, nor works: nor gifts, no^ strokes
Thy sturdy adamantine heart provokes
My Justice, sleights my mercies: An^le ^
Thou stand'st unmoved, though my hammer strike.

ODE 8.
1.
What have we here? An heart? It looks like one,
The shape, and color speak it such:
But having brought it to the touch
I find it is no better then a stone.
Adamants are
Softer by far.
2.
Long has it steeped been in Mercies milk,
And soaked in salvation,
Meet for the alteration
Of anvills to have made them soft as silk;
Yet it is still
Hardened in ill.
3.
Often have I rained my Word upon it, often
The dew of heaven has distilled,
With promises of mercy filled,
Able to make mountains of marble soft:
Yet it is not
Changed a jot.
4.
My beams of love shine on it every day,
Able to thaw the thickest ice,
And where they enter in a trice
To make congealed Cry^all melt away:
Yet warm they not
This frozen clot.
5.
Nay more, this hammer, that is wont to grind
Rocks unto dust, and powder small,
Makes no impression at all,
Nor dint, nor crack, nor flaw, that I can find;
But leaves it as
Before it was.
6.
Is mine Almighty arm decai'd in strength?
Or has mine hammer lost its weight?
That a poor lump of earth should slight
My mercies, and not feel my wrath at length,
With which I make
Even heaven to shake?
7.
No, I am still the same, I alter not,
And, when I please, my works of wonder
Shall bring the stoutest spirits under,
And make them to confess it is their lot
To bow or break,
When I but speak.
8.
But I would have men know, 't is not my Word,
Or works alone can change their hearts:
These instruments perform their parts,
But it is my Spirit does this fruit afford.
It Is I, not art,
Can melt man's heart.
9.
Yet would they leave their customary sinning,
And so unclench the devils claws,
That keeps them captive in his paws,
My bounty soon should second that beginning:
Even hearts of ^eel
My force should feel.
(...) 3.
I gave't thee whole, and fully furnished
With all its faculties entire,
There wanted not
The smallest jot,
That strictest justice could require
To render it completely perfected.
4.
And is it reason what I gave in gross
Should be returned but by retaile?
To take so small
A part for all,
I reckon of no more avail,
Then where I scatter gold to gather dross.
5.
Give me thine heart but as I gave it thee:
Or give it me at least as I
Have given mine
To purchase thine.
I halv'd it not when I did die:
But gave my self wholly to set thee free.
6.
The heart I gave thee was a living heart,
And when thine heart by sin was slain,
I laid down mine
To ransom thine,
That thy dead heart might live again,
And live entirely perfect, not in part.
7.
But whilst thine heart's divided it is dead,
Dead unto me, unle^ it live
To me alone,
It is all one
To keep all, and a part to give:
For what is a body worth without an head?
8.
Yet this is worse, that what thou keep'st from me
Thou do bestow upon my foes:
And those not mine
Alone but thine,
The proper causes of thy woes,
For whom I gave my life to set thee free.
9.
Have I betrothed thee to my self, and shall
The devil, and the world, intrude
Upon my right,
Even in my fight?
Think not thou can me so delude.
I will have none, unless I may have all.
10.
I made it all, I gave it all to thee,
I gave all that I had for it:
If I must loose,
I Will rather choose
Mine interest in all to quit:
Or keep it whole, or give it whole to me.

The insatiablenesse of the Heart.
HAB. 2.5. Who inlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be
satisfied.
Epigr. 10.
THe whole round world is not enough to fill
The Hearts three corners, but it craveth still.
Only the Trinity, that made it, can
Suffice the vast triangled heart of man.

ODE. 10.
1.
The thirsty earth and barren womb cry, Give:
The grave devoureth all that live:
The fire still burns on, and never says,
It is enough: The horseleech has
Many more daughters: but the heart of man
Outgapes them all as much as heaven one span.
2.
Water has drowned the earth: the barren womb
Has teemed sometimes, and been the tomb
To its own swelling issue: and the grave
Shall one day a ^cke surfeit have:
When all the fuel is consumed, the fire
Will quench it self, and of it self expire.
3.
But the vast heart of man's insatiate,
His boundless appetites dilate
Themselves beyond all limits, his desires
Are endless still: whilst he aspires
To happiness, and feign would find that treasure
Where it is not, his wishes know no measure.
4.
His eye with seeing is not satisfied,
Nor's care with hearing: he has tried
At once to furnish ^ry several sense
With cho^e of curious objects, whence
He might e^tract, ^ into one unite
A perfect quinteflence of all delight.
5.
Yet, having all that he can fancy, still
There wants something more to fill
His empty appetite. His mind is vexed,
And he is inwardly perplexed
He knows not why: when as the truth is this,
He would find something there where nothing is.
6.
He rambles over all the faculties,
Ransacks the secret treasuries
Of Art and Nature, spells the Universe
Letter by letter, can rehearse
All the Records of time, pretends to know
Reasons of all things, why they must be so.
7.
Yet is not so contented, but would feign
Pry in Gods Cabinet, and gain
Intelligence from heaven of things to come,
Anticipate the day of Doom,
And read the issues of all actions so,
As if Gods secret counsels he did know.
8.
Let him have all the wealth, all the renown,
And glory, that the world can crown
Her dearest da^gs with; yet his desire
Will not rest there, but still aspire.
Earth cannon hold him, nor the whole creation
Contain his wishes, or his expectation.
9.
The heart of man's but little, yet this All
Compared thereunto's but final,
Of such a large unparalled extense
Is the short-lin'd ^
Of that three-corner'd figure, which to fill
With the round world is to leave empty still.
10.
Go greedy soul, address thy self to heaven,
And leave the world, as 't is, bereav'n
Of all true happiness, or any thing
That to thine heart content can bring,
But there a trine-une God in glory fits,
Who all grace-thirsting hearts both fills and fits.

The returning of the Heart.
ISAY 46.8. Remember this, and show your selves men: bring it again to heart, O
ye transgressors.
Epigr. 11.
Often have I called thee: O return at last,
Return unto thine heart: let the time past
Suffice thy wanderings: know that to cherish
Revolting still is a mere will to perish.

ODE. 11.

Return O wanderer, return, return.
Let me not always wast my words in vain
As I have done too long. Why do thou spurn
And kick the counsels that should bring thee back again?
The Soul.

2.
What Is this that checks my course? Me thinks I feel
A cold remissness seifing on my mind:
My staggered resolutions seem to reel,
As though they had in have forgot mine heart behind.
Christ.

3.
Return, O wanderer, return, return.
Thou art already gone too far away,
It is enough: unless thou mean to burn
In hell for ever, stop thy course at last and stay.
The Soul.

4.
There Is something holds me back, I cannot move
Forward one foot: me thinks the more I strive
The least I stir. Is there a power above
My will in me, that can my purposes reprive?
Christ.

5.
No power of thine own: it is I, that lay
Mine hand upon thine haste: whose will can make
The restless motions of the heavens stay,
Stand still, turn back again, or new found courses take.
The Soul.

6.
What? am I riveted, or rooted here?
That neither forward, nor on either side
I can get loose? Then there is no hope I fear,
But I must back again, what ever me betide.
Christ.

7.
And back again thou shall. I Will have it so.
Though thou have hitherto my voice neglected,
Now I have handed thee, I Will have thee know,
That what I will have done shall not be uneffected.
The Soul.

8.
Thou will prevail then, and I must return.
But how? or whither? when a world of shame,
And sorrow, lie before me, and I burn
With horror in my self to think upon the same.
9.
Shall I return to thee? Alas, I have
No hope to be received: a run away,
A rebel to return! mad men may rave
Of mercy miracles, but what will Justice say?
10.
Shall I return to mine own heart? Alas,
It Is lost, and dead, and rotten long ago,
I cannot find it what at first it was,
And it has been too long the cause of all my woe.
11.
Shall I forsake my pleasures, and delights,
My profits, honors, comforts, and contents,
For that, the thought whereof my mind affrights,
Repentant sorrow, that the soul asunder rents?
12.
Shall I return, that cannot though I would?
I, that had strength enough to go astray,
Find my self saint, and feeble, now I should
Return. I cannot run, I cannot creep this way.
13.
What shall I do? Forward I must not go,
Backward I cannot: if I tarry here,
I shall be drowned in a world of woe,
And antidate mine own damnation by despair.
14.
But is it not better hold that which I have,
Then unto future expectation trust?
Oh no: to reason thus is but to rave.
Therefore return I will, because return I must.
Christ.

15.
Return, and welcome: if thou will thou shall.
Although thou can not of thy self, yet I,
That call, can make thee able. Let the fault
Be mine, if when thou will return I let thee lie.

1.
Can death, or hell, be worse then this estate?
Anguish, amazement, horror, and confusion,
Drown my distracted mind in deep distress.
My grief's grown so transcendent, that I hate
To hear of comfort, as a false Conclusion
Vainly inferred from feigned Premises.
What shall I do? what strange course shall I try,
That, though I loath to live, yet dare not die?
Christ.

2.
Be ruled by me, I Will teach thee such a way,
As that thou shall not only draine-thy mind
From that destructive deluge of distress,
That overwhelmes thy thoughts but clear the day,
And foone recover light, and strength to find,
And to regaine thy long lost happiness.
Confess, and pray. Say what it is does aile thee,
What thou would have, and that ^all soon ava^e thee^
The Soul.

3.
Confess and pray? If that be all, I will.
Lord, I am sick, and thou art health, restore me.
Lord, I am weak, and thou art strength, sustain me.
Thou art all goodness, Lord, and I all ill.
Thou Lord, art holy, I unclean before thee.
Lord, I am poor, and thou art rich, maintain me.
Lord, I am dead, and thou art life, revive me.
Justice condemns, let mercy, Lord, reprieve me.
4.
A wretched miscreant I am, composed
Of finne, and misery; 't is hard to say,
Which of the two allies me most to hell:
Native corruption makes me indisposed
To all that is good, but apt to go astray,
Prone to do ill, unable to do well.
My light is darkness, and my liberty
Bondage, my beauty foul deformity.
5.
A plague of leprosy o'rspreadeth all
My powers, and faculties: I um unclean,
I am unclean: my liver broils with lust,
Rancor and malice overflow my gall,
Envy my bones does rot, and keep me lean,
Revengefull wrath makes me forget what is just:
Mine eare's uncircumsised, mine eye is evil,
And hating goodness makes me parcel devil.
6.
My callous conscience is cauteriz'd;
My trembling heart shakes with continual fear:
My frantic passions fill my mind with madness:
My windy thoughts with pride are tympaniz'd:
My poys' nous tongue spits venom every where:
My wounded spirit's swallowed up with sadness:
Impatient coffeehouse plagues me so,
I neither can stand still, nor forward go.
7.
Lord, I am all diseases: hospitalls,
And bills of Mountebanks, have not so many,
Nor half so bad. Lord, hear, and help, and heal me.
Although my guiltiness for vengeance calls,
And color of excuse I have not any,
Yet thou have goodness, Lord, that may avail me.
Lord, I have powered out all my heart to thee:
Vouchsafe one drop of mercy unto me.

The circumcision of the Heart.
DEVT. 10. 16. Circumcise the foreskin of your heart, an be no more
stiffnecked.
Epigr. 13.
HEre, take thy Saviors cross, the nails, and spear,
That for thy sake his holy flesh did tear:
use them as knives thine heart to circumcise,
And dress thy God a pleasing sacrifice.

ODE. 13.
1.
Heal thee? I will. But first I Will let thee know
What it comes to.
The plaster was prepared long ago:
But thou must do
Something thy self, that it may be
Effectually applied to thee.
2.
I, to that end, that I might cure thy sores,
Was slain, and died,
By mine own people was turned out of doors,
And crucified:
My side was pierced with a spear,
And nails my hands and feet did tear.
3.
Do thou then to thy self, as they to me:
Make haste, and try,
The old man, that is yet alive in thee,
To crucify.
Till he be dead in thee, my blood
Is like to do thee little good:
4.
My course of physic is to cure the soul
By killing sin.
So then, thine own corruptions to control
Thou must begin.
Until thine heart be citcumcis'd,
My death will not be duly prized.
5.
Consider then my cross, my nails, and spear,
And let that thought
Cut Rasor-like thine heart, when thou do hear,
How dear I bought
Thy freedom from the power of sin,
And that distress which thou wast in.
6.
Cut out the iron finew of thy neck,
That it may be
Supple, and pliant to obey my beck,
And learn of me.
Meekness alone, and yielding, has
A power to appease my wrath.
7.
Shave off thine hairy scalpe, those curled locks
Powd'red with pride,
Wherewith thy scornful heart my judgments mocks,
And thinks to hide
Its thunder-threatned head, which bared
Alone is likely to be spared.
8.
Rippe off those seeming robes, but real rags,
Which earth admires
As honorable orna^nts, and brags
That it attires,
Cumbers thee with indeed. Thy sores
Fester with what the world adores.
9.
Clip thine Ambitions wings, let down thy plumes,
And learn to stoop,
Whilst thou have time to stand. Who still presumes
Of strength will droope
At last, and flagge, when he should fly.
Falls hurt them most that climb most high
10.
Scrape off that scaly scurffe of vanities,
That clogges thee so:
Profits and pleasures are those enemies,
That work thy woe.
If thou will have me cure thy wounds,
First rid each humor that abounds.

The contrition of the Heart.
PSALM. 51.17. A broken and contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise.
Epigr. 14.
HOw gladly would I bruise, and break this heart
Into a thousand pieces, till the smart
Make it confess, that, of its own accord,
It wilfully rebelled against the Lord?

ODE. 14.
1.
Lord, if I had an arm of power like thine,
And could effect what I desire,
My love-drawne heart, like smallest wyre,
Bended and writhen, should together twine,
And twisted stand
With thy command:
Thou should no sooner bid, but I would go,
Thou should not will the thing I would not do.
2.
But I am weak, Lord, and corruption strong:
When I would feign d^e what I should,
Then I cannot do what I would:
Mine action's short, when ^ intention's long:
Though my desire
be ^ as fire,
Yet my performance is as dull as earth,
And stitles its own issue in the birth.
3.
But what I can do, Lord, I will, since what
I would I cannot: I will try
Whether mine heart, that is hard and dry,
Being calmed, and tempered with that
Liquor which falls
From mine eye balls,
Will work more pliantly, and yield to take
Such new impression as thy grace shall make.
4.
In mine own conscience then, as in a mortar
I Will place mine heart, and bray it there:
If grief for what is past, and fear
Of what is to come be a sufficient torture,
I Will break it all
In pieces small:
Sin shall not find a sheard without a flaw,
Wherein to lodge one lust against thy law.
5.
Remember then, mine heart, what thou have done;
What thou have left undone: the ill
Of all my thoughts, words, deeds, is still
Thy cursed issue only: thou art grown
To such a pass,
That never was,
Nor is, nor will there be, a sin so bad,
But thou some way therein an hand have had.
6.
Thou have not been content alone to sin,
But have made others sin with thee,
Y^ made their sins thine own to be,
By liking, and allowing them therein.
Who first begins,
Or follows, sins
Not his own sins alone, but sins over
All the same sins, both after, and before.
7.
What boundless sorrow can suffice a guilt
Grown so transcendent? Should thine eye
Weep seas of blood, thy sighs outvie
The winds when with the waves they run at tilt,
Yet they could not
Cancel one blot.
The least of all thy sins against thy God
Deserves a thunderbolt should be thy rod.
8.
Break then, mine heart: and since thou cannot grieve
Enough at once, while thou art whole,
Shiver thy self to dust, and dole
Thy sorrow to the several atoms, give
All to each part,
And by that art
Strive thy dissever'd self to multiply,
And want of weight with number to supply

So let it be,
Lord, I am well content,
And thou shall see
The time is not misspent,
Which thou do then bestow, when thou do quell
And crush the heart, that pride before did swell.
2.
Lord, I perceive
As soon as thou do send,
And I receive
The blessings thou do lend,
Mine heart begins to mount, and does forget
The ground whereon it goes, where it is set.
3.
In health I grew
Wanton, began to kick,
As though I knew
I never should be sick.
Diseases take me down, and make me know,
Bodies of brass must pay the death they owe.
4.
If I but dream
Of wealth, mine heart does rise
With a full stream
Of pride, and I despise
All that is good, until I wake, and spy
The swelling bubble pricked with poverty.
5.
A little wind
Of undeserved praise
Blows up my mind,
And my swollen thoughts does raise
Above themselves, until the sense of shame
Makes me contemn my self-dishonour'd name.
6.
One moments mirth
Would make me run stark mad,
And the whole earth,
Could it at once be had,
Would not suffice my greedy appetite,
Did thou not pain in stead of pleasure write.
7.
Lord, it is well,
I was in time brought down,
Else thou can tell,
Mine heart would soon have flow'n
Full in thy face, and studi'd to-requite
The riches of thy goodness with despite.
8.
Slack not thine hand,
Lord, turn thy Screw about:
If thy Press stand,
Mine heart may chance slip out.
O quest it unto nothing, rather then
It should forget it self, and swell again.
9.
Or if thou art
Disposed to let it go,
Lord, teach mine heart
To lay it self as low,
As thou can cast it: that prosperity
May still be tempered with humility.
10.
Thy way to rise
Was to descend: let me
My self despise,
And so ascend with thee.
Thou throw'st them down, that lift themselves on high,
And raisest them, that on the ground do lie.

Thou kindle in it once thy fire of love.

Nay, blessed Founder, leave me not:
If out of all this grot
There can but any gold be got,
The time thou do bestow, the cost,
And pains will not be lost:
The bargain is but hard at most.
And such are all those thou do make with me:
Thou know thou can not but a loser be.
2.
When the Sun shines with glittering beams,
His cold dispelling gleames
Turn snow, and ice to watery streams.
The wax, as soon as it has smelt
The warmth of fire, and felt
The glowing heat thereof, will melt.
Yea pearls with vinegar dissolve we may,
And adamants in blood of goats, they say.
3.
If nature can do this, much more,
Lord, may thy grace restore
Mine heart to what it was before.
There Is the same matter in it still,
Though new informed with ill,
Yet can it not refist thy will.
Thy power, that framed it at the first, as often
As thou will have it, Lord, can make it soft.

Thou art the Sun of right^ e^e:
And though I must ^
Mine heart's grown hard in wickedness,
Yet thy resplendent rays of light,
When once they come in sight,
Will quickly thawe what froze by night.
Lord, in thine healing wings a power does dwell
Able to melt the hardest heart in hell.
5.
Although mine heart in hardness pass
Both iron, steel, and brass,
Yea th'hardest thing that ever was,
Yet, if thy fire thy Spirit accord,
And working with thy word
A blessing unto it afford,
It will grow liquid, and not drop alone,
^ ^ it self ^ before thy throne.
6.
Yea, though my flinty heart be such,
That the Sun cannot touch,
Nor fire sometimes affect it much,
Yet thy warm reeking self shed blood,
O Lamb of God,'s so good
It cannot always be withstood.
That Aqua-regia of thy love prevails,
Even where thy powers Aquafortis fails.
7.
Then leave me not so soon, dear Lord,
Though I neglect thy Word,
And what thy power does afford,
Yet try thy mercy, and thy love,
The force thereof may move,
When all things else successesse prove.
Soakt in thy blood mine heart will soon surrender
Its native hardness, and grow soft, and tender.

Are oaded all, or d^d in grain.
There Is not a blot

For all that I can do:
There is no hope
In Fullers soap,
Though I add nitre too.

Have often soakt it in cold fears,
And, when a time I spied,
Powered upon it scalding tears,

Yet can I not
Wash out one spot,
It Is rather fouler grown.

As I have been of late,
Both to my sorrow, shame, and smart?
If it will not

Yet how should we
Divided be,
That are not two, but one?

But am I not stark wild,
That go about to wash mine heart
With hands that are defiled,
As much as any other part?
Whilst all thy tears,

And thought is foul,
Poor filly soul,
How can thou look to speed?

So soul, but thou can cleanse it sure.
Speak, blessed Lord,
Will thou afford
Me means to make it clean?
I know thou ^:

Then to that blessed spring,
Which from my Saviors sacred side
Does flow, mine heart I Will bring,

Yet sure thou will esteem that good,
Which thou have purchased with thy blood,
And thought it worth the craving.
2.
Give thee mine heart? Lord, so I will,
If thou will first impart the skill
Of bringing it to thee:
But should I trust my self to give
Mine heart, as sure as I do live,
I should deceived be.
3.
As all the value of mine heart
Proceeds from favor, not ^,
Acceptance is its worth:
So neither know I how to bring
A present to my heavenly King,
Unless he set it forth.

Lord of my life, me thinks I hear
Thee say, that thee alone to fear,
And thee alone to love,
Is to bestow mine heart on thee,
That other giving none can be,
Whereof thou will approve.
5.
And well thou do deserve to be
Both loved, Lord, and feared by me,
So good, so great, thou art:
Greatness so good, goodness so great,
As pa^eth all finite conceit,
And ravisheth mine heart.
6.
Should I not love thee, blessed Lord,
Who freely of thine own accord
Laid'st down thy life for me?
For me, that was not dead alone,
But desp'ratly transcendent grown
In enmity to thee?
7.
Should I not fear before thee, Lord,
Who^ hand ^ heaven, at whose word
Devils themselves do quake?
Whose eyes outshine the Sun, whose beck
Can the whole ^ of Nature check,
And its foundations shake?
8.
Should I withold mine heart from thee,
The fountain of felicity,
Before whose presence is
Fullness of joy, at whose right hand
All pleasures in perfection stand,
And everlasting bliss?
9.
Lord, had I hearts a million,
And ^riads in every one
Of choicest loves, and fears,
They were too little to bestow
On thee, to whom I all things owe,
I should be in arreares.
10.
Yet, since mine heart's the most I have,
And that which thou do chiefly crave,
Thou shall not of it miss.
Although I cannot give it so,
As I should do, I Will offer't though:
Lord take it, here it is.

For such an Altar, and for such a Priest?
No, no, thy Gospel does require
Choice offerings too, and made by fire.

So that there never will be need
Of any more sin-off'rings, great, or small.
The life blood thou did shed for me,
Has set my soul for ever free.

Still offer in behalf of thine elect:
And to improve it to the most,

Offer thee often, and sacrifice
Thee daily in our eare^, and eyes.

Yea, each believing soul may take
Thy sacrificed flesh, and blood by faith,
And therewith an atonement make
For all its trespasses, thy Gospel faith.
Such infinite transcendent price

Peace Offerings, and sacrifices of
Thanksgiving tendered unto thee?
Yes, Lord, I know I should but mock, and scoff
Thy sacrifice for ^nne, should I
My sacrifice of praise deny.

But I have nothing of mine own
Worthy to be presented in thy fight,
Yea the whole world affords not one
Or Ram, or Lamb, wherein thou can delight.
Less then my self it must not be:
For thou did give thy self for me.

And so I will, mine heart, the only thing

As thine own part, the best I have to bring.

Is always welcome unto me.
He that would please me with an offering
Cannot a better have, although he were a King.
2.
And there is none so poor,
But if he will he may
Bring mean heart, although no more,
And on mine altar may it lay.
The sacrice which I like best, is such
As rich men cannot beast, and poor men need not grutch
3.
Yet every heart is not
A gift sufficient,
It must be purged from every spot,
And all to pieces must be rent.
Though thou have sought to circumcise, and bruise't,
It must be weighed too, or else I shall refuse't.
4.
My balances are just,
My Law's an equal weight,
The beam is strong, and thou may trust
My steady hand to hold it straight.
Were thine heart equal to the world in ^ght,
Yet it were nothing worth, if it should prove too light.
5.
And so thou see it does,
My pond rous Law does press
This scale, but that, as filled with froth,
Tilts up, and makes no show of stresse.
Thine heart is empty sure, or else it would
In weight, as well as bulk, better proportion hold.
6.
Search it, and thou shall find
It wants integrity,
And is not yet so through lined
With single eyed sincerity,
As it should be: some more humility
There wants to make it weight, and some more constancy.
7.
Whilst windy vanity.
Does ^any up with pride,
And double faced hypocri^
Does many empty hollowes hide,
It is but good in part, and that but little,
Wavering unstaidnesse man its resolutions brittle.
8.
The heart, that in my sight
As current coin would pass,
Must not be the least grain too light,
But as at first it stamped was.
Keep then thine heart till it be better grown,
And, when it is full weight, I Will take it for mine own.
9.
But if thou art ashamed
To find thine heart so light,
And art afraid thou shall be blamed,
I Will teach thee how to set it right.
Add to my Law my Gospel, and there see
My merits thine, and then the scales will equal be.

The trying of the Heart.
PROVE. 17.3. The fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the Lord
tries the hearts.
Epigr. 21.
THine heart, my deer, more precious is then gold,
Or the most precious things that can be told:
Provided first that my pure fire have tried
Out all the dross, and pass it purified.

ODE. 21.
1.
What? take it at adventure, and not try
What metal it is made of? No, not I.
Should I now lightly let it pass,
Take sullen lead for silver, sounding brass
In stead of solid gold, alas,
What would become of it? In the great day
Of making jewels 't would be cast away.
2.
The heart thou giv'st me must be such a one,
As is the same throughout. I will have none
But that, which will abide the fire.
It Is not a glittering outside I desire,
Whose seeming shows do soon expire:
But real worth within, which neither drosie,
Nor base allayes, make subject unto loss.
3.
If in the composition of thine heart
A stubborn steely wilfulness have part,
That will not bow and bend to me,
Save only in a mere formality
Of tinsell-trim'd hypocrisy,
I care not for it, though it show as fair,
As the first blush of the Sun-gilded air.
4.
The heart that in my furnace will not melt,
When it the glowing heat thereof has felt
Turn liquid, and dillolve in tears
Of true repentance for its faults, that hears
My threatening voice, and never fears,
Is not an heart worth having. If it be
An heart of stone, 't is not an heart for me.
5.
The heart, that cast into my furnace spits,
And sparkles in my face, falls into fits
Of discontented grudging, whines
When it is broken of its will, repines
At the least suffering, declines
My fatherly correction, is an heart
On which I care not to bestow mine art.
6.
The heart that in my flames asunder flies,
Scatters it selse at randon, and so lies
In heaps of ashes here, and there,
Whose dry d^persed parts will not draw nee^
To one another, and adhere
In a firm union, has no metal in it
Fit to be stamped, and coined in my mint.
7.
The heart, that vapors out it self in smoke,
And with those cloudy shadows thinks to cloak
Its empty nakedness, how much
So ever thou esteemest it, is such
As never will endure my touch.
Before I take it for mine then I will try
What kind of metal in thine heart' does lie.
8.
I Will bring it to my furnace, and there see
What it will prove, what it is like to be.
If it be gold, it will be sure
The hottest fire that can be to endure,
And I shall draw it out more pure.
Affliction may refine, but cannot wast,
That heart wherein my love is fixed fast.
Emblem 22.


The sounding of the Heart.
JER. 17.9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.
Who can know it? I the Lord.
Epigr. 22.
I, that alone am infinite, can try
How deep within it self thine heart does lie.
The Sea-mans plummet can but reach the ground:
I find that which thine heart it self never sound,

ODE. 22.
1.
A goodly heart to see to, fair and fat!
It may be so: and what of that?
Is it not hollow? Has it not within
A bottomless whirlpoole of sin?
Are there not secret creeks, and cranies there,
Turning, and winding corners, where
The heart it self even from it self may hide,
And lurk in secret unespi'd?
I Will none of it, if such a one it prove:
Truth in the inward parts is that I love.
2.
But who can tell what is within thine heart?
It Is not a work of Nature, Art
Cannot perform that task: 't is I alone,
Not man, to whom man's heart is known.
Sound it thou may, and must: but then the line
And plummet must be mine, not thine,
And I must guide it too, thine hand, and eye
May quickly be deceived: but I,
That made thine heart at first, am better skilled
To know when it is empty, when it is filled.
3.
Lest then thou should deceive thy self, for me
Thou can not, I will let thee see
Some of those depths of Satan, depths of hell,
Wherewith thine hollow heart does swell.
Under pretense of knowledge in thy mind
Error and ignorance I find,
Quicksands of rotten Superstition
Spread over with misprision.
Some thing thou know not, misknowest others,
And often thy conscience its own knowledge smothers.
4.
Thy crooked will, that seemingly enclines
To follow reasons dictates, twines
Another way in secret, leaves its guide
And laggs behind, or swarves aside,
Crab-like creepes backward when it should have made
Progress in good, is retrograde.
Whilst it pretends a privilege above
Reasons prerogative, to move
As of it self unmoved, rude passions learn
To leave the Oar, and take in hand the Stern.
5.
The tides of thine affections ebb, and flow,
Rise up aloft, fall down below,
Like to the sudden land-flouds, that advance
Their swelling waters but by chance.
Thy love, desire, thy hope, delight, and fear,
Ramble they care not when, nor where,
Yet cunningly bear thee in hand they be
Only directed unto me,
Or most to me, and would no notice take
Of other things, but only for my sake.
6.
Such strange prodigious impostures lurk
In thy prestigious heart, 't is work
Enough for thee all thy life time to learn
How thou may truly it discern:
That, when upon mine altar thou do lay
Thine offering, thou may sasely say,
And swear it is an heart: for, if it should
Prove only an heart-case, it would
Nor pleasing be to me, nor do thee good.
An heart's no heart not rightly understood.
Emblem 23.


The levelling of the Heart.
PSALM. 97.11. Gladness to the upright in heart.
Epigr. 23.
SEt thine hear upright, if thou would rejoice,
And please thy self in thine hearts pleasing cho^se:
But then be sure thy plimme, and level be
Rightly applied to that which pleases me.

ODE. 23.
1.
Nay, yet I have not done: one trial more
Thine heart must undergo, before
I will accept of it:
Unless I see
It upright be,
I cannot think it fit
To be admitted in my sight,
And to partake of mine eternal light.
2.
My Will's the rule of righteousness, as free
From error as uncertainty:
What I would have is just.
Thou must desire
What I require,
And take it upon trust:
If thou prefer thy will to mine,
The levell's lost, and thou go out of line.
3.
Do thou not see how thine heart turns aside,
And leanes toward thy self? How wide
A distance there is here?
Until I see
Both sides agree
Alike with mine, 't is clear
The middle is not where't should be,
Likes something better, though it look at me.
4.
I, that know best how to dispose of thee,
Would have thy portion poverty,
Lest wealth should make thee proud,
And me forget:
But thou have set
Thy voice to cry aloud
For riches, and unless I grant
All that thou wishest, thou complain'st of want.
5.
I, to preserve thine health, would have thee fast
From Natures dainties, lest at last
Thy senses sweet delight
Should end in smart:
But thy vain heart
Will have its appetite
Pleased to day, though grief, and sorrow
Threaten to cancel all thy joys to morrow.
6.
I, to prevent thine hurt by clining high,
Would have thee be content to lie
Quiet and safe below,
Where peace does dwell;
But thou do swell
With vast desires, as though
A little blast of vulgar breath
Were better then deliverance from death.
7.
I, to procure thine happiness, would have
Thee mercy at mine hands to crave:
But thou do merit plead,
And wilt have none
But of thine own,
Till Justice strike thee dead.
Thus still thy wandering ways decline,
And all thy crooked ^ go cross to mine.
Emblem 24.


The renewing of the Heart.
EZEKIEL. 36.26. A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
you.
Epigr. 24.
ARt thou delighted with strange novelties,
Which often prove but old fresh garnisht lies?
Leave then thine old, take the new heart I give thee:
Condemn thy self, that so I may reprieve thee.

ODE. 24.
1.
No, no, I see
There is no remedy,
An heart, that wants both weight, and worth,
That Is filled with naught but empty hollownesse,
And screwed aside with stubborn wilfulness,
Is only fit to be cast forth,
Nor to be given me
Nor kept by thee.
2.
Then let it go,
And if thou will bestow
An acceptable heart on me,
I Will furnish thee with one shall serve the turn,
Both to be kept, and given: which will burn
With zeal, yet not consumed be:
Nor with a scornful eye
Blast standers by.
3.
The heart, that I
Will give thee, though it lie
Buried in seas of sorrows, yet
Will not be drowned with doubt, or discontent,
Though sad complaints sometimes may give a vent
To grief, and tears the checks may wet,
Yet it exceeds their art
To hurt this heart.
4.
The heart I give,
Though it desire to live,
And bath it self in all content,
Yet will not toil, or taint it self, with any:
Although it take a view, and taste of many,
It feeds on few, as though it meant
To break fast only here,
And dine elsewhere.
5.
This heart is fresh,
And new: an heart of flesh,
Not, as thine old one was, of stone.
A lively sp'ritly heart, and moving still,
Active to what is good, but slow to ill:
An heart, that with a sigh, and groan
Can blast all worldly joys,
As trifling toys.
6.
This heart is sound,
And solid will be found;
It Is not an empty ayrie flash,
That baits at Butterflies, and with full cry
Opens at every flirting vanity.
It sleights, and scorns such paltry trash:
But for eternity
Dares live, or die.
7.
I know thy mind:
Thou seek'st content to find
In such things as are new, and strange.
Wander no further then: lay by thine old,
Take the new heart I give thee, and be bold
To boast thy self of the exchange,
And say, that a new heart
Exceeds all art.
Emblem 25.


The enlightening of the Heart.
PSALM. 34.5. They looked unto him, and were lightened.
Epigr. 25.
THou that art Light of lights, the only sight
Of the blind world, lend me thy saving light:
Disperse those mists, which in my soul have made
Darkness as deep as hells eternal shade.

ODE. 25.
1.
Alas, that I
Could not before epsy
The soule-confounding misery
Of this, more then Egyptian, dreadful night!
To be deprived of the light,
And to have eyes, but eyes devoid of sight,
As mine have been, is such a woe,
As he alone can know,
That feels it so.
2.
Darkness has been
My God and me between
Like an opacous doubled skreen,
Through which nor light, nor heat could passage sind.
Gross ignorance has made my mind,
And understanding not bleer-ey'd, but blind;
My will to all that is good is cold,
Nor can I, though I would,
Do what I should.
3.
No, now I see
There is no remedy
Lest in my self: it cannot be
That blind men in the dark should find the way
To blessedness: although they may
Imagine that high midnight is noonday,
As I have done till now, they will know
At last unto their woe,
'Twas nothing so.
4.
Now I perceive
Presumption does bereave
Men of all hope of help, and leave
Them, as it finds them, drowned in misery:
Despairing of themselves, to cry
For mercy is the only remedy
That sinne-sicke souls can have: to pray
Against this darkness may
Turn it to day.
5.
Then unto thee,
Great Lord of light, let me
Direct my prayer, that I may see.
Thou, that did make mine eyes, can soon restore
That power of fight they had before,
And, if thou see it good, can give them more.
The night will quickly shine like day,
If thou do but display
One glorious ray.
6.
I must confess,
And I can do no less,
Thou art the Sun of righteousness:
There Is healing in thy wings: thy light is life;
My darkness death. To end all ^rise,
Be thou mine husband, let me be thy wife.
Then both the light, and life that is thine,
Though light, and life divine,
Will all be mine.

The table of the Heart.
IER. 31.33. I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their
hearts.
Epigr. 26.
IN the soft table of thine heart I Will write
A new Law, which I newly will ind te.
Hard stony tables did contain the old:
But tender leaves of flesh shall this infold.

ODE. 26.
1.
What will thy fight
Avail thee, or my light,
If there be nothing in thine heart to see
Acceptable to me?
A self-writ heart will not
Please me, or do thee any good, I wot,
The paper must be thine,
The writing mine.
2.
What I indite
It Is I alone can write,
And write in books that I my self have made.
It Is not an easy trade
To read or write, in hearts:
They that are skillful in all other arts,
When they take this in hand,
Are at a stand.
3.
My Law of old
Tables of stone did hold,
Wherein I writ what I before had spoken,
Yet were they quickly broken:
A sign the Covenant
Contained in them would due ob^ervance want.
Nor did they long remain
Coppy'd again.
4.
But now I Will try
What force in flesh does lie:
Whether thine heart renewed afford a place
Fit for my Law of grace.
This covenant is better
Then that, though glorious, of the killing letter.
This gives life, not by merit,
But by my Spirit,
5.
When in men's hearts,
And their most inward parts,
I by my Spirit write my Law of love,
They then begin to move,
Not by themselves, but me,
And their obedience is their liberty.
There are no slaves, but those
That serve their foes.
6.
When I have writ
My Covenant in it,
View thine heart by my light, and thou shall fee
A present fit for me.
The worth for which I look,
Lies in the lines, not in the leaves of th book.
Course paper may be lined
With words refined.
7.
And such are mine.
No furnace can resine
The choicest silver so to make it pure,
As my Law put in ^
Purges the hearts of men:
Which being ruled, and written with my Pen,
My Spirit, every letter
Will make them better.

The tilling of the Heart.
EZEKIEL. 36.9. I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled, and sown.

MIne heart's a field, thy cross a plow: be pleased
Dear Spouse, to till it, till the mould be raised
Fit for the seeding of thy Word: then sow,
And if thou shine upon it, it will grow.

ODE. 27.
1.
So, now me thinks I find
Some better vigor in my mind,
My will begins to move,
And mine affections stir toward things above:
Mine heart grows big with hope it is a field,
That some good fruit may yield,
If it were tilled, as it should be,
Not by my self, but thee.
2.
Great Husbandman, whose power
All difficulties can devour,
And do what likes thee best,
Let not thy field, mine heart, lie lay, and rest,
Lest it be over-runne with noisome weeds,
That spring of their own seeds:
Unless thy grace the growth should stop,
Sin would be all my croppe.
3.
Break up my fallow ground,
That there may not a clod be found
To hide one root of finne.
Apply thy plow betime: now, now begin
To furrow up my stiff, and starvy heart,
No matter for the smart,
Al though it roar, when it is rent,
Let not thine hand relent.
4.
Corruption's rooted deep,
Showers of repentaut tears must steep
The mould to make it soft:
It must be stirred, and turned, not once, but often.
Let it have all its feasons. O impart
The best of all thine art.
For, of it self it is so tough,
All will be but enough.
5.
Or, if it be thy will
To teach me, let me learn the skill
My self to plow mine heart:
The profit will be mine, and 't is my part
To take the pains, and labor, though the increase
Without thy blessing cease:
If fit for nothing else, yet thou
May make me draw thy Plow.
6.
Which of thy Plowes thou will,
For then have more then one. My guilt,
Thy wrath, thy rods, are all
^ fit to ^ mine heart to pieces small:
And, when in ^ ^ prehends thee near,
It Is furrowed with fear:
Each weed turned under hides its head,
And shows as it were dead.
7.
But, Lord, thy blessed passion
Is a Plow of another fashion,
Better then all the rest.
Oh fasten me to that, and let the best
Of all my powers strive to draw it in,
And leave no room for finne.
The virtue of thy death can make
Sin its fast hold forsake.

Lest the field of mine heart should unto thee,
Great Husbandman that made it, barren be,
Manure the ground, then come thy self and seed it;
And let thy servants water it, and weed it.

ODE. 28.
1.
Nay, blessed Lord,
Unless thou will afford
Manure, as well as tillage, to thy field,
It will not yield
That fruit which thou expectest it should bear:
The ground I fear
Will still remain
Barren of what is good: and all the grain
It will bring forth,
As of its own accord, will not be worth
The pains of gathering
So poor a thing.
2.
Some faint desire,
That quickly will expire,
Wither, and die, is all thou can expect.
It thou neglect
To sow it now't is ready, thou ^ find
That ^ ^ ^,
And ^ grow
Then at the first it was. Thou must bestow
Some further cost,
Else all thy former labor will be lost.
Mine heart no corn will breed
Without thy seed.
3.
Thy Word is seed,
And manure too: will seed,
As well as fill mine heart. If once it were
Well rooted there,
It would come on apace: O then neglect
No time expect
No better season.
Now, now thy field mine heart is ready: reason
Surrenders now,
Now my rebellious will begins to bow,
And mine affections are
Tamer by far.
4.
Lord, I have lain
Barren too long, and saine
I would redeem the time, that I may be
Fruitful to thee,
Fruitful in knowledge, says, obedience,
Ere I go hence:
That when I come
At harvest to be reaped, and brought home;
Thine Angels may
My soul in thy celestial garner lay,
Where perfect joy, and bliss
Eternal is.
5.
If, to entreat
A crop of purest wheat,
A blessing too transcendent should appear
For me to bear,
Lord, make me what thou will, so thou will take
What thou do st make,
And not disdain
To house me, though amongst thy coursest grain,
So I may be
Laid with the gleanings gathered by thee,
When the full sheaves are spent,
I am content.

The watering of the Heart.
ISA. 27.3. I the Lord do keep it. I will water it every moment.
Epigr. 29.
CLose downwards toward the earth, open above
Toward heaven mine heart is. O let thy love
Distill in fructifying dewes of grace,
And then mine heart will be a pleasant place.

ODE. 29.
1.
See how this dry, and thirsty land,
Mine heart, does gaping gasping stand,
And close below opens toward heaven, and thee
Thou fountain of felicity,
Great Lord of living waters, water me:
Let not my breath that pants with pain,
Waste, and consume it self in vain.
2.
The mists, that from the earth do rise,
An heav'n-borne heart will not suffice:
Cool it without they may, but cannot quench
The scalding heat within, nor drench
Its dusty dry desires, or fill one trench.
Nothing, but what comes from on high,
Can heav'n-bred longings satisfy.
3.
See how the seed, which thou did sow
Lies parched, and withered, will not grow
Without some moisture, and mine heart has none,
That it can truly call its own,
By nature of it self, more then a stone:
Unless thou water't, it will lie
Drowned in dust, and still be dry.
4.
Thy tender plants can never thrive,
Whilst want of water does deprive
Their roots of nourishment: which makes them call,
And cry to thee, great All in All,
That seasonable showers of grace may fall,
And water them: thy Word will do it,
If thou vouchsafe thy blessing to it.
5.
O then be pleased to unseal
Thy fountain, blessed Savior, deal
Some drops at least, wherewith my drooping spirits
May be revived. Lord, thy merits
Yield more refreshing then the world inherits:
Rivers, yea seas, but ditches are,
If with thy springs we them compare.
6.
If not whole showers of rain, yet Lord,
A little pearly dew afford,
Begot by thy celestial influence
On some chaste vapor, raised hence
To be partaker of thine excellence:
A little, if it come from thee,
Will be of great avail to me.
7.
Thou boundless Ocean of grace,
Let thy free spirit have a place
Within mine heart: full rivers then I know
Of living waters forth will flow,
And all thy plants, thy fruits, and flowers will grow.
Whilst thy Springs their roots do nourish,
They must needs be fat, and flourish.

to feed in the gardens, and to gather lillies.
Epigr. 30.
THese lillies I do consecrate to thee,
Beloved Spouse, which spring as thou ma^st see,
Out of the seed thou sowedst, and the ground

ODE. 31.

Is there a joy like this?
What can augment my bliss?
If my beloved will accept
A po^e of these flowers kept,
And consecrated unto his content,
I hope hereafter he will not repent
The cost, and pains he has bestowed
So freely upon me, that owed
Him all I had before,
And infinitely more.
2.
Nay, try them, blessed Lord,
Take them not on my word,
But let the color, ^ast and ^
The truth of their ^ ^ tell.
Thou that art in^nite in wisdom ^ee
If they be not the same that came from thee.
If any difference be found,
It is occasioned by the ground,
Which yet I cannot see
So good as it should be.
3.
What say thou to that Rose,
That queen of flowers, whose
Maidenly blushes, fresh, and fair,
Out-brave the dainty morning air?
Do thou not in those lovely leaves espy
The perfect picture of that modesty,
That self-condemning shamefastness,
That is more ready to confess
A fault, and to amend,
Then it is to offend?
4.
Is not this Lilly pure?
What Fuller can procure
A white so perfect, spotless, clear,
As in this flower does appear?
Do st thou not in this milky color see
The lively luster of sincerity,
Which no hypocrisy has painted,
Nor self-respecting ends have tainted?
Can there be to thy sight
A more entire delight?
5.
Or will thou have beside
Violets purple-di'd?
The Sun-observing Marigold,
Or Orpin never waxing old,
The Primrose, Cowslip, Gilliflow'r, or Pinke,
Or any flower, or herb, that I can think
Thou have a mind unto? I shall
Quickly be furnished with them all,
If once I do but know
That thou will have it so.
6.
Faith is a fruitful grace,
Well planted stores the place,
Fills all the borders, beds, and bowers
With wholesome herbs, and pleasant flowers.
Great Gardener, thou say, and I believe,
What thou do mean to gather thou will give.
Take then mine heart in hand to fill't,
And it shall yield thee what thou will.
Yea thou, by gathering more,
Shall still increase my store.

Lord, will thou suffer this? Shall vermin spoil
The ^uit or all thy toil,
Thy trees, thine herbs, thy plants, thy flowers thus:
And for an overplus
Of spite, and malice overthrow thy mounds,
Lay common all thy grounds?
Can thou endure thy pleasant garden should
Be thus turned up as ordinary mould?
Christ.

2.
What is the matter? why do thou complain?
Must I as well maintain,
And keep, as make thy fences? will thou take
No pains for thine own sake?
Or does thy self-confounding fancy fear thee,
When there is no danger near thee?
Speak out thy doubts, and thy desires, and tell me,
What enemy or can, or dares to quell thee?
The Soul.

3.
Many, and mighty, and malicious, Lord,
That seek, with one accord,
To work my speedy ruin, and make haste
To lay thy garden waste.
The devil is a ramping roaring lion,
Hates at his heart thy Zion,
And never gives it respit day, nor hour,
But still goes seeking whom he may devour.
4.
The world's a wilderness, wherein I find
Wild beasts of every kind,
Foxes, and Wolves, and Dogs, and Boares, and Bears;
And which augments my fears,
Eagles and Vultures, and such birds of prey,
Will not be kept away:
Besides the light-abhorring Owls, and Bats,
And secret corner-creeping Mice and Rats.
5.
But these, and many more would not dismay
Me much, unless there lay
One worse then all within, my self I mean,
My false, unjust, unclean,
Faithless, disloyal self, that both entice,
And entertain each vice.

Lord, thou may see my fears are grounded, rise
Not from a bare surmise,
Or doubt of danger only, my desires
Are but what need requires,
Of thy divine protection, and defense
To keep these vermin hence:
Which, if they should not be re^rain'd by thee,
Would grow too strong to be kept out by me.
Christ.

Thy fear is just, and I approve thy care.
But yet thy comforts are

The watching of the Heart.
CANT. 5.2. I sleep, but my heart waketh.
Epigr. 32.
WHilst the soft hands of sleep tie up my senses,
My watchful heart, free from all such ^,
Searches for thee, enquires es all about thee,
Nor day, nor night, able to be without thee.

ODE. 32.
1.
It must be so: that God that gave
Me senses, and a mind, would have
Me use them both, but in their several kinds.
Sleep must refresh my senses, but my minds
A ^ of heavenly fire, that seeds
On ^, and employment, needs
No ^ or rest: for, when it thinks to please
^ with idleness, it is least at ease.
Though quiet rest refresh the head,
The heart that stirs not sure is dead.
2.
Whilst then my body ease does take,
My ^ refusing heart ^ all wake:
And that mine heart the better watch may keep,
I Will lay my senses for a the to sleep.
Wanton de re shall not ^,
Nor lust enveigle them to vi^e:
No sading colors shall ^ my fight,
Nor sounds enchant mine ears with their delight:
I Will bind my smell, my touch, my taste,
To keep a strict religious fast.
3.
My worldly business shall lie still,
That heavenly thoughts my mind may fill:
My Marthaes cumb'ring cares shall cease their noise,
That Mary may attend her better choice.
That meditation may advance
Mine heart on purpose, not by chance,
My body shall keep holy day, that so
My mind with better liberty may go
About her business, and ingrosse
That gain, which worldly men count loss.
4.
And though my senses sleep the while,
My mind my senses shall beguile
With dreams of thee, dear Lord, whose rare perfections
Of excellence are such, that bare inspections
Cannot suffice my greedy soul,
Nor her fierce appetite control,
Bur that the more she looks the more she longs,
And strives to thrust into the thickest throngs
Of those divine discoveries,
Which dazell even Angels eyes.
5.
Oh could I lay aside this flesh,
And follow after thee with fresh
And free desires, my disentangled soul,
Ravished with admiration, should roll
It self, and all its thoughts on thee,
And by believing strive to see,
What is invisible to flesh and blood,
And only by fruition understood,
The beauty of each several grace,
That shines in thy Sunne-shaming face.
6.
But what I can do that I will,
Waking and sleeping, seek thee still:
I Will leave no place unpri'd into behind me,
Where I can but imagine I may find thee:
I Will ask of all I meet, if they
Can tell thee where thou art, which way
Thou go, that I may follow after thee,
Which way thou come, that thou mai'st meet with me.
If not thy face, Lord, let mine heart
Behold with Moses thy back part.

The wounding of the Heart.
LAM. 3.12. He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
Epigr. 33.
A Thousand of thy strongest shasts, my light,
Draw up against this heart with all thy might,
And strike it through: They, that in need do stand
Of cure, are healed by thy wounding hand.

ODE. 33.
1.
Nay, spare me not dear Lord, it cannot be
They should be hurt, that wounded are by thee.
Thy shafts will heal the hearts they hit,
And to each sore its salve will fit.
All hearts by Nature are both sick, and sore,
And mine as much as any else, or more:
There is no place that is free from finne,
Neither without it, nor within,
And universal maladies do crave
Variety of medicines to have.
2.
First, let the arrow of thy piercing eye,
Whose light outvieth the star-spangled sky,
Strike through the darkne^ of my mind,
And leave no cloudy mist behind.
Let thy resplendent rays of knowledge dart
Bright beams of understanding to mine heart,
To my finne-shadow'd heart, wherein
Black ignorance did first begin
To blurre thy beauteous Image, and deface
The glory of thy self-sufficing grace.
3.
Next let the shaft of thy sharp-pointed power
Discharged by that strength that can devour
All difficulties, and incline
Stout opposition to resign
Its steely stubbornness, subdue my will,
Make it hereafter ready to fulfill
Thy royal Law of righteousness,
As gladly, as I must confess
It has fulfilled heretofore the unjust,
Profane, and cruel laws of its own lust.
4.
Then let that love of thine, which made thee leave
The bosom of thy Father, and be^eave
Thy self of thy ^ glory,
Matter for an eternal story.
Strike through mine affections all together,
And let that Sun shine ^eer the cloudy weather,
Wherein they wander without guide,
Or order, as the wind, and tide
Of floting ^ transport, and toss them,
Till self-begotten troubles curb and cross them.
5.
Lord, empty all thy Quivers, let there be
No corner of my spacious heart left free,
Till all be but one wound, wherein
No subtle sight-abhorring sin
May lurk in secret unespi'd by me,
Or reign in power unsubdu'd by thee.
Perfect thy purchased victory,
That thou mai'st ride triumphantly,
And leading captive all captivity
Mai'st put an end to enmity in me.
6.
Then, blessed Archer, in requital I
To shoot thine arrows back again will try.
By prayers, and praises, fighs, and sobs,
By vows, and tears, by groans, and throbs,
I Will see if I can pierce, and wound thine heart,
And vanquish thee again by thine own art.
Or, that we may at once provide
For all mishaps that may betide,
Shoot thou thy self, thou polisht shaft, to me,
And I will shoot my broken heart to thee.

ODE. 34.
1.
Welcome, great guest, this house, mine heart,
Shall all be thine:
I will resign
Mine interest in every part:
Only be pleased to use it as thine own
For ever, and inhabit it alone:
There Is room enough, and if the furniture
Were answerably fitted, I am sure
Thou would be well content to stay,
And by thy light
Possess my sight
With sense of an eternal day.
2.
It is thy building, Lord, 'r was made
At thy command,
And still does stand
Upheld, and sheltered by the shade
Of thy protecting providence: though such
As is decayed, and impaired much,
Since the removal of thy residence,
When with thy grace glory departed hence,
It has been all this while an Inn
To intertaine
The vile, and vain,
And wicked companies of sin.
3.
Although't be but an house of clay,
Framed out of dust,
And such as must
Dissolved be, yet it was gay,
And glorious indeed, when ev ry place
Was furnished, and fitted with thy grace:
When in the Presence Chamber of my mind,
The bright Sunbeams of perfect knowledge shined:
When my will was thy Bedchamber,
And every power
A stately Tower
Sweetened with thy Spirits amber.
4.
But whilst thou do thy self absent,
It is not grown
Noisome alone,
But all to pieces torn, and rent.
The windows all are stopped, or broken so,
That no light without wind can through go.
The roofe's uncovered, and the wall's decai'd,
The door's flung off the hooks, the floor's unlai'd,
Yea, the foundation rotten is,
And every where
It does appear
All that remains is far amiss,
5.
But if thou will return again,
And dwell in me,
Lord, thou shall see
What care I Will take to intertaine
Thee, though not like thy self, yet in such sort,
As thou will like, and I shall thank thee for it.
Lord, let thy blessed Spirit keep possession,
And all things will be well; at least confession
Shall tell thee what is amiss in me,
And then thou shall
Or mend the fault,
Or take the blame of all on thee.

The enlarging of the Heart.
PSALM. 119.32. I will run the way of thy Commandments, when thou shall
enlarge my heart.
Epigr. 35.
HOw pleasant is that now, which heretofore
Mine heart hela buter, sacred learnings l^e?
^ hearts enter with greatest ease
The ^ paths, and run the narrowest ways.

ODE. 35.
1.
What a blessed change I find,
Since I intertain d this guest!
Now me thinks another mind
Moves and rules within my breast.
Surely I am not the same,
That I was before he came,
But I then was much too blame.
2.
When before my God commanded
Any thing he would have done,
I was close, and gripple handed,
Made an end ere I begun.
If he thought it fit to lay
Judgments on me, I could say
They are good, but shrink away.
3.
All the ways of righteous^sse
I did think were full of trouble,
I complained of tediousness,
And each duty ^ double.
Whilst I served him but of fear,
Every minute did appear
Longer sarre then a whole year.
4.
Strictness in Religion seemed
Like a pined pinioned thing:
Bolts, and fetters I esteemed
More beseeming for a King,
Then for me to bow my neck,
And be at another beck,
When I felt my conscience check.
5.
But the case is altered now:
He no sooner turns his eye,
But I quickly bend, and bow,
Ready at his feet to lie:
Love has taught me to obey
All his precepts, and to say,
Not to morrow, but to day.
6.
What he wills I say I must:
What I must I say I will:
He commanding, it is just
What he would I should fulfill.
Whilst he bids I believe
What he calls for he will give.
To obey him is to live.
7.
His Command'ments grievous are not
Longer then men think t^m so:
Though he send me forth I care not,
Whilst he gives me strength to go.
When, or whither, all is one,
On his business, not mine own,
I shall never go alone.
8.
If I be complete in him,
And in him all fullness dwells.
I am sure aloft to swim,
Whilst that Ocean overswelleth,
Having him that is All in All,
I am confident I shall
Nothing want, for which I call.

The inflaming of the Heart.
PSALM. 39.3. My heart was hot within me: while I was musing the sire burned.
Epigr. 36.
SPare not, my love, to kindle, and inflame
Mine heart within throughout, until the same
Break forth, and burnc: that so, thy Salamander,
Mine heart may never from thy furnace wander.

ODE. 36.
1.
Welcome, holy, heavenly fire,
Kindled by immortal love:
Which descending from above,
Makes all earthly thoughts retire,
And give place
To that grace,
Which with gentle violence
Conquers all corrupt affections,
Rebel Natures insurrections,
Bidding them be packing hence.
2.
Lord, thy fire does heat within,
Warmeth not without alone;
Though it be an heart of stone,
Of it self congealed in sin,
Hard as steel,
If it feel
Thy dissolving power, it grows
Soft as wax, and quickly takes
Any print thy Spirit make,
Paying what thou sai'st it owes.
3.
Of it self mine heart is dark,
But thy fire by shining bright,
Fills it full of saving light
Though It be but a little spark
Lent by thee,
I shall see
More by it, then all the light,
Which in fullest measures streams
From corrupted Natures beams,
Can discover to my sight.
4.
Though mine heart be ice, and snow,
To the things which thou have chosen,
All benumbed with cold, and frozen,
Yet thy fire will make it glow.
Though it burns,
When it turns
Toward the things which thou do hate:
Yet thy blessed warmth, no doubt,
Will that wildfire soon draw out,
And the heat thereof abate.
5.
Lord, thy fire is active, using
Always either to ascend
To its native heaven, or lend
Heat to others: and diffusing
Of its store
Gathers more,
Never ceasing till it make
All things like it self, and longing
To see others come with thronging
Of thy goodness to partake.
6.
Lord, then let thy fire inflame
My cold heart so thoroughly,
That the heat may never die,
But continue still thr same:
That I may
Every day
More, and more, consuming sin,
Kindling others, and attending
All occasions of ascending,
Heaven upon earth begin,

The ladder of the Heart.
PSALM. 84. 5. In whose heart are the ways of them.
Epigr. 37.
Would thou, my love, a ladder have, whereby
Thou mai'st climb heaven to sit down on high?
In thine own heart then frame thee steps, and bend
Thy mind to muse how thou mai'st there ascend.

ODE. 37.

What?
Shall I
Always lie
Groveling on earth,
Where there is no mirth?
Why should I not ascend,
And climb up, where I may mend.
My mean estate of misery?
Happiness I know's exceeding high:
Yet sure there is some remedy for that
Christ.

2.
True,
There is.
Perfect bliss,
The fruit of love,
May be had above:
But he, that will obtain
Such a gold-exceeding gain,
Must never think to reach the same,
And scale heavens walls, until he frame
A ladder in his heart ^ ^ ^
The Soul.

3.
Lord,
I will:
But the skill
Is not mine own:
Such an art's not known,
Unless thou will it teach:
It is far above the reach
Of mortal minds to understand.
But if thou will lend thine helping hand,
I will endeavor to obey thy Word.
Christ.

4.
Well
Then, see
That thou be
As ready pressed
To perform the rest,
As now to promise fair,
And I Will teach thee how to rear
A scaling-ladder in thine heart
To mount heaven with: no rules of art,
But I alone, can the composure tell.
5.
First,
Thou must
Take on trust
All that I say,
Reason must not sway
Thy judgment cross to mine,
But her Scepter quite resign.
Faith must be both thy ladder sides,
Which will stay thy steps what ever betides,
And satisfy thine hunger, and thy thirst.
6.
Then,
The round
Next the ground,
Which I must see;
Is Humility:
From which thou must ascend,
And with perseverance end.
Virtue to virtue, grace to grace,
Must each orderly succeed in'ts place.
And when thou have done all begin again.

The flying of the Heart.
ISA. 60. 5. Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the Doves to their
windows?
Epigr. 38.
OH that mine heart had wings like to a Dove,
That I might quickly hasten hence, and move
With speedy flight toward the cel^stiall spheres,
As weary of this world, its faults, and fears!

ODE. 38.
1.
This way, though pleasant, yet me thinks is long:
Step after step makes little haste,
And I am not so strong
As still to last
Among
So great
So many lets:
Swelter'd and swill'd in sweat
My toyling soul both fumes and frets,
As though she were inclined to a retreat.
2.
Corruption clogs my seet like filthy clay,
And I am ready still to slip:
Which makes me often stay,
When I should trip
Away.
My fears
And faults, are such,
As challenge all my tears
So justly, that it were not much,
If I in weeping should spend all my years.
3.
This makes me weary of the world below,
And greedy of a place above,
On which I may bestow,
My choicest love,
And so
Obtain
That favor, which
Excells all worldly gain,
And makes the possessour rich,
In happiness of a transcendent strain.
4.
What? must I still be rooted here below,
And riveted unto the ground,
Wherein mine haste to grow
Will be though sound,
But slow?
I know
The Sun exhales
Gross vapors from below,
Which, scorning as it were the Vales,
On mountaine-topping clouds themselves bestow.
5.
But my fault-frozen heart is flow to move,
Makes poor proceedings at the best,
As though it did not love,
Nor long for rest
Above.
Mine eyes
Can upward look,
As though they did despise
All things on earth, and could not brook
Their presence: but mine heart is slow to rise.
6.
Oh that it were once winged like the Dove,
That in a moment mounts on high,
Then should it soon remove,
Where it may ly
In love.
And lo,
This one desire
Me thinks has imp'd it so,
That it already flies like fire,
And even my verses into wings do grow.

The union of the Heart.
EZEKIEL. 11.19. I will give them one heart.
Epigr. 39.
LIke minded minds, hearts al ke heartily
Affected will together live, and die:
Many things meet, and part: but loves great gable
Tying two hearts makes them inseparable.

ODE. 39.
The Soul.

1.
All this is not enough: me thinks I grow
More greedy by fruition: what I get
Serves but to set
An edge upon mine appetite,
And all thy gifts do but invite
My prayers for more.
Lord, if thou will not still increase my store,
Why did thou any thing at all bestow?
Christ.

2.
And is 't the fruit of having still to crave?
Then let thine heart united be to mine,
And mine to thine
In a firm union, whereby
We may no more be thou, and I,
Or, I, and thou,
But both the same: and then I will avow,
Thou can not want what thou do wish to have.
The Soul.

3.
True, Lord, for thou art All in All to me,
But how to get my stubborn heart to twine,
And close with thine,
I do not know, nor can I guess
How I should ever learn, unless
Thou will direct
The course that I must take to that effect.
It Is thou, not I, must knit mine heart to thee.
Christ.

4.
'T is true, and so I will: but yet thou must
Do something toward it too: First, thou must lay
All ^nne away,
And separate from that, which would
Our meeting intercept, and hold
Us distant still:
I am all goodness, and can close with ill
No more, then richest diamonds with dust.
5.
Then thou must not count any earthly thing,
How ever gay, and gloriously set forth,
Of any worth,
Compared with me, that am alone
The eternal, high, and holy One:
But place thy love
Only on me, and on the things above:
Which true content, and endless comfort bring.
6.
Love is the loadstone of the heart, the glue,
The cement, and the ^oder, which alone
Unites in one
Things that before were not the same,
But only like, imparts the name,
And nature too
Of each to the other: nothing can undo
The knot that is knit by love, if it be true.
7.
But if in deed, and truth thou love me,
And not in word alone, then I shall find
That thou do mind
The things I mind, and regulate
All thine affections, love, and hate,
Delight, desire,
Fear, and the rest, by what I do require,
And I in thee my self shall always see.
Emblem 40.


The rest of the Heart.
PSALM. 116.7. Return unto thy rest, O my soul.
Epigr. 40.
MY busy, stirring heart, that seeks the best,
Can find no place on earth wherein to rest:
For God alone, the author of its bless,
Its only rest, its only center ^.

ODE. 40.
1.
Move me no more, mad world, it is in va^ne,
Experience tells me plain
I should deceived be,
If ever I again should trust in thee.
My weary heart has ransackt all
Thy treasuries both great, and small,
And thy large inventories bears in mind:
Yet could it never find
One place wherein to rest,
Though it has often tried all the best.
2.
Thy profits brought me loss in stead of gain,
And all thy pleasures pain:
Thine honors blurred my name
With the deep stains of self-confounding shame,
Thy wisdom made me turn stark fool,
And all the learning, that thy school
Afforded me, was not enough to make
Me know my self, and take
Care of my better part,
Which should have perished for all thine heart.
3.
Not that there is not place of rest in thee
For others: but for me
There is, there can be, none:
That God, that made mine heart, is he alone,
That of himself both can, and will,
Give rest unto my thoughts, and fill
Them full of all content, and quietne^,
That so I may ^
My soul in patience,
Until he find it time to call me hence.
4.
On thee then, as a sure foundation,
A tried cornerstone,
Lord, I will strive to raise
The tower of my salvation, and thy praise.
In thee, as in my center, shall
The lines of all my longings fall.
To thee, as to mine anchor, surely ti'd
My ship shall safely ride.
On thee, as on my bed
Of soft repose, I Will rest my weary head.
5.
Thou, thou alone, shall be my whole desire,
I Will nothing else require,
But thee, or for thy sake.
In thee I Will sleep secure, and when I wake
Thy glorious face shall satisfy
The longing of my looking eye.
I Will roll my self on thee, as on my rock,
And threatening dangers mock.
Of thee, as of my treasure,
I Will boast, and brag, my comforts know no measure.
6
Lord, thou shall be mine All, I will not know
A profit here below,
But what ^ on thee:
Thou shall be all the pleasure I will see
In any thing the earth affords.
Mine heart shall own no words
Of honor, out of which I cannot raise
The matter of thy praise.
Nay, I will not be mine,
Unless thou will vouchsafe to have me thine.

The bathing of the Heart.
JOEL 3.21. I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed.
Epigr. 41.
THis bath thy Savior swet with drops of blood,
Sick heart, of purpose for to do thee good.
They that have tried it can the virtue tell,
Come then and use it, is thou will be well.

ODE. 41.
1.
All this thy God has done for thee:
And now mine heart
It is high time that thou should be
Acting thy part,
And meditating on his blessed Passion,
Till thou have made it thine by imitation.
2.
That exercise will be the best
And surest means,
To keep thee evermore at rest,
And free from pains.
To suffer with thy Savior is the way
To make thy present comforts last for aye.
3.
Trace then the steps, wherein he trade,
And first begin
To sweat with him. The heavy load,
Which for thy sin
He underwent, squeezed blood out of his face,
Which in great drops came trickling down apace.
4.
Oh let not then that precious blood
Be spilt in vain,
But gather every drop. It Is good
To purge the stain
Of guilt, that has defiled, and overspred
Thee from the sole of th'foot to th'crown of the head.
5.
Poison possesses every vein,
The fountain is
Corrupt, and all the streams unclean:
All is amiss.
Thy bloud's impure, yea thou thy self, mine heart,
In all thine inward powers polluted art.
6.
When thy first father first did ill,
Man's doom was read,
That in the sweat of's face he still
Should eat his bread.
What the first Adam in the garden caught,
The second Adam in a garden taught.
7.
Taught by his own example, how
To sweat for sin,
Under that heavy weight to bow,
And never linne
Begging release, till with strong cries, and tears
The soul be drained of all its saults, and ^eares.
8.
If sins imputed guilt oppressed
The Almighty so,
That his sad soul could find no rest
Under that woe:
But that the bitter agony he felt
Made his pure blood, if not to sweat, to melt.
9.
Then let that huge inherent mass
Of sin, that lies
In heaps on thee, make thee surpass
In tears, and cries,
Striving with all thy strength, until thou sweat
Such drops as his, though not as good, as great.
10.
And if he think it fit to lay
Upon thy back,
Or pains, or duties, as he may
Until it crack,
Shrink not away, but strain thine utmost force
To bear them cheerfully without remorse.

The binding of the Heart.
HOS. 11.4. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love.
Epigr. 42.
Mr sins, I do consesse, a cord were found
Heavy, and hard by thee, when thou wast bound,
Great Lord of love, with them, but thou have twined
Gentle love cords my tender heart to bind.

ODE. 42.
1.
What? could those hands,
That made the world, be subject unto bands?
Could there a cord be found,
Wherewith omnipotence it self was bound?
Wonder mine heart, and stand amazed to see
The Lord of liberty
Led captive for thy sake, and in thy stead.
Although he did
Nothing deserving death, or bands, yet he
Was bound, and put to death, to set thee free.
2.
Thy sins had ti'd
Those bands for thee, wherein thou should have di'd
And thou did daily knit
Knots upon knots, whereby thou made them ^t
Closer, and faster, to thy faulty self.
So like a cursed else,
Helpless, and hopeless, friendlesse, and forlorn,
The sink of scorn,
And kennell of contempt, thou should st have lain
Eternally enthralled to endless pain.
3.
Had not the Lord
Of love and life been pleased to afford
His helping hand of grace,
And freely put himself into thy place.
So were thy bands transferred, but not unti'd,
Until the time he did,
And by his death vanquished, and conqu'red all,
That Adams sall
Had made victorious. Sin, Death, and Hell,
Thy fatal foes, under his footstool sell.
4.
Yet he meant not
That thou should use the liberty he got
As it should like thee best,
To wander as thou listest, or to rest
In soft repose careless of his commands:
He that has loosed those bands,
Whereby thou wast enslaved to the foes,
Binds thee with those,
Where with he bound himself to do thee good,
The bands of love, love writ in lines of blood.
5.
His love to thee
Made him to lay aside his Majesty,
And clothed in a veil
Of frail, though faultlesse flesh, become thy bail.
But love requires love: and since thou art
Loved by him, thy part
It is to love him too: and love affords
The strongest cords
That can be: for it ties, not hands alone,
But heads, and hearts, and souls, and all in one.
6.
Come then, mine heart,
And freely follow the prevailing art
Of thy Redeemers love.
That strong magnetique tie has power to move
The steeli'st stubbornness. If thou but twine,
And twist his love with thine,
And by obedience labor to express
Thy thankfulness,
It will be hard to say on whether side
The bands are surest, which is fastest tide.

The prop of the Heart.
PSALM. 102.7, 8. His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. His heart is
established, he shall not be afraid.
Epigr. 43.
My weak, and seeble heart, a prop must use,
But pleasant fruits, and flowers does refuse:
My Christ my pillar is, on him rely,
Repose, and rest my self, alone will I.

ODE. 43.
1.
Suppose it true, that whilst thy Saviors side
Was furrowed with ^courges he was ti'd
Unto some pillar fast,
Think not, mine heart, it was because he could
Not stand alone, or that left loose he would
Have shrunk away at last.
Such weakne^ suits not with Omnipotence,
Nor could man's malice match his patience.
2.
But, if so done, 't was done to tutor thee,
Whose frailty, and impatience he does see
Such, that thou have nor strength,
Nor will, as of thy self, to undergo
The least degree of duty, or of woe,
But would be sure at length
To flinch, or faint, or not to stand at all,
Or in the end more fearfully to fall.
3.
Thy very frame, and figure, broad above,
Narrow beneath, apparently does prove
Thou can not stand alone,
Without a prop to boulster, and to stay thee.
To trust to thine own strength would soon betray thee.
Alas, thou now art grown
So weak, and feeble, wavering, and unstaid,
Thou shrink'st at the least weight that is on thee laid.
4.
The ea^est command'ments thou declinest,
And at the lightest punishments thou whinest:
Thy restless motions are
Innumerable, like the troubled sea
Whose waves are tossed, and tumbled every way.
The Hound-pursued Hare
^ ^ so many doubles, as thou do,
Till thy cross courses in themselves are lost.
5.
Get thee some stay that may support thee then,
And stablish thee, lest thou should start again.
But where may it be found?
Will pleasant fruits, or flowers serve the turn?
No, no, my tottering heart will overturne,
And lay them on the ground.
Dainties may serve to minister delight,
But strength is only from the Lord of might.
6.
Betake thee to thy Christ then, and repose
Thy self in all extremities on those
His everlasting arms,
Wherewith he girds the heavens, and upholds
The pillars of the earth, and safely folds
His faithful flock from harms.
Cleave close to him by says, and let the bands
Of love tie thee in thy Redeemers hands.
7.
Come life, come death, come devils, come what will,
Yet ^ ned so thou shall stand ^ still:
And all the powers of hell
Shall not ^ to shake thee with their shock,
So long as ^ art founded on that rock:
No duty shall thee quell,
No danger shall ^ thy ^ state,
Nor soule-perplexing ^ thy mind ^

The scourging of the Heart.
PROVE. 10.13. A rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
Epigr. 44.
WHen thou withhold'st thy scourges, dearest love,
My sluggish heart is slack, and slow to move.
Oh let it not stand still, but lash it rather,
And drive it, though unwilling, to thy Father.

ODE. 44.
1.
What do those scourges on that sacred flesh,
Spotless and pure?
Must he, that does sin-weari'd souls refresh,
Himself endure
Such tearing tortures? Must those sides be gash'd?
Those shoulders lashed?
Is this the trimming that the world bestows
Upon such robes of majesty as those?
2.
Is It not enough to die, unless by pain
Thou antidate
Thy death before hand, Lord? What do thou mean
To aggravate
The guilt of sin? or to enhance the price
Thy sacrifice
Amounts to? Both are infinite I know,
And can by no additions greater grow.
3.
Yet dare I not imagine that in vain
Thou did endure
One stripe: though not thine own thereby, my gain
Thou did procure,
That when I shall be scourged for thy sake,
Thy stripes may make
Mine acceptable, that I may not grutch,
When I remember thou have borne as much.
4.
As much, and more, for me. Come then mine heart,
And willingly
Submit thy self to suffer: smile at smart
And death de^e.
Fear not to feel that hand correcting thee,
Which set thee free.
Stripes as the tokens of his love he leaves,
Who scourges every son whom he receives.
5.
There Is foolishness bound up within thee fast:
But yet the rod
Of fatherly correction at the last,
If blessed by God,
Will drive it far away, and wisdom give,
That thou may live,
Not to thy self, but him, that first was slain,
And died for thee, and then rose again.
6.
Thou art not only dull, and slow of pace
But stnbborne too,
And refractory, ready to outface,
Rather then do,
Thy duty: though thou know it must be so,
Thou will not go
The way thou should, till some affliction
First set thee right, then prick, and spur thee on.
7.
Top-like thy figure, and condition is,
Neither to stand,
Nor stir, thy self alone, whilst thou do ^
An helping hand
To set thee up, and store of stripes bestow
To make thee go.
Beg then thy blessed Savior to transfer
His scourges unto thee, to make thee stir.

The hedging of the Heart.
HOS. 2.6. I will hedge up thy way with thorns.
Epigr. 45.
HE, that of thorns would gather roses, may
In his own heart, if handled the right way.
Hearts hedged with Christ's Crown of thorns, in stead
Of thorny cares, will sweetest roses breed.

ODE 45.
1.
A crown of thorns! I thought so: ten to one,
A crown without a thorn there is none:
There Is none on earth I mean, what shall I then
Rejoice to see him crowned by men,
By whom Kings rule, and reign? Or shall I scorn,
And hate, to see earths curse, a thorn,
Prepost' rously preferred to crown those brows,
From whence all bliss, and glory flows?
Or shall I both be clad,
And also sad,
To think it is a crown, and yet so bad?
2.
There Is cause enough of both, I must confess:
Yet, what is that unto me, unless
I take a course his crown of thorns may be
Made mine, transferred from him to me?
Crowns had they been of stars could add no more
Glory, where there was all before,
And thorns might scratch him, could not make him worse
Then he was made finne, and a curse.
Come then, mine heart, take down
Thy Saviors Crown
Of thorns, and see if thou can make it thine own.
3.
Remember first, thy Saviors head was crowned
By the same hands that did him wound:
They meant it not to honor, but to scorn him,
When in such sort they did bethorne him.
Think earthly honors such, if they redound
Not to his glory, the are not sound.
Never believe they mind to dignifie
Thee, that thy Christ would crucify.
Think every crown a thorn,
Unless 't adorn
Thy Christ, as well as him, by whom 't is worn.
4.
Consider then that, as the thorny crown
Circled thy Saviors head, thine own
Continual care to please him, and provide
For the advantage of his side,
Must fence thine actions, and affections so,
That they shall neither dare to go
Out of that compass, nor vouchsase access
To what might make that care go ^.
Let no such thing draw nigh,
Which shall not spy
Thorns ready placed to ^ick it till it die.
5.
Thus, compassed with thy Saviors thorny Crown,
Thou mai'st securely sit thee down,
And hope that he, who made of water wine,
Will turn each Thorn unto a Vine,
Were thou ^ gather grapes, and to delight thee
Roses: nor need the prickles fright thee.
Thy Saviors sacred temples took away
The curse, that in their ^ lay.
So thou mai'st crowned be,
As well as he,
And at the last light in his light shall see.
Emblem 46.


The fastening of the Heart.
JER. 32.40. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart
from me.
Epigr. 46.
THou, thath wast nailed to the Cross for me,
Lest I stould slip, and fall away from thee,
Drive home thine holy fear into mine heart,
And clench it so, that it may never depart.

ODE. 46.
1.
What? do thou struggle to get loose again?
Have thou so soon forgot the former pain,
That thy licentious bondage unto sin,
And lust enlarged thraldom, put thee in?
Have thou a mind again to rove, and ramble
Rogue-like a vagrant through the world, and scramble
For scraps, and crusts of earth bred base delights,
And change thy days of joy for tedious nights
Of sad repentant sorrow?
What? will thou borrow
That grief to day, which thou must pay to morrow?
2.
No, self-deceiving heart, lest thou should cast
Thy cords away, and burst the bands at last
Of thy Redeemers tender love, I Will try
What further fastness in his fear does lie.
The cords of love soaked in lust may rot,
And bands of bounty are too often forgot:
But holy filial fear, like to a nail
Fast ned in a sure place, will never fail.
This driven home will take
Fast hold, and make
Thee that thou dare not thy God forsake.
3.
Remember how, besides thy Saviors bands,
Wherewith they led him bound, his holy hands,
And feet, were pierced, how they nailed him fast
Unto his bitter ^, and how at last
His precious side was goared with a spear.
So hard sharp-pointed ^, and steel did tear
His tender flesh, that from those wounds might flow
The sov'raigne salve for sin-procured woe.
Then that thou mai'st not sail
Of that avail,
Refuse not to be fast'ned with his nail.
4.
Love in an heart of flesh is apt to taint,
Or be fly-blowne with folly: and its saint
And feeble spirits, when it shows most fair,
Are often fed on by the empty air
Of popular applause, unless the salt
Of holy fear in time prevent the fault:
But seasoned so it will be kept for ever.
He, that does fear because he loves, will never
Adventure to oftend,
But always ^end
His best endeavors to content his friend.
5.
Though perfect love cast out all servile fear,
Because such fear has torment: yet thy dear
Redeemer meant not so to set thee free,
That filial fear, and thou should strangers be.
Though, as a son, thou honor him thy father,
Yet, as a master, thou may fear him rather.
Feare's the souls Centinell, and keeps the heart,
Wherein love lodges so, that all the art,
And industry, of those,
That are its foes,
Cannot betray it to its former woes.

The new wine of the Heart.
PSA^. 104.115. Wine that makes glad the heart of man.
Epigr. 47.
CHrist the true Vine, grape, cluster, on the Cross
Trod the ^nepresse alone, unto the loss
Of blood, and life. Draw, thankful heart, and spare not:
Here Is wine enough for all, save those that care not.

ODE. 47.
1.
Leave not thy Savior now, what ever thou do,
Doubtful distrustful heart,
Thy former pains, and labors, all are lost,
If now thou shall depart,
And faithlesly fall off at last from him,
Who to redeem thee spared nor life nor limme.
2.
Shall he, that is thy Cluster, and thy Vine,
Tread the winepresse alone,
Whilst thou stand'st looking on? Shall both the wine,
And work be all his own?
See how he bends, crushed with the straightened Screw
Of that fierce wrath, that to thy sins was due.
3.
Although thou can not help to bear it, yet
Thrust thy self under too,
That thou mai'st feel some of the weight, and get
Although not strength to do,
Yet will to suffer something as he does,
That the same stresse at once may squeeze you both.
4.
Thy Savior being pressed to death, there ran
Out of his sacred wounds
That wine, that makes glad the heart of man,
And all his foes confounds.
Yea, the full-flowing fountain s open still
For all grace-thirsting hearts to drink their fill.
5.
And not to drink alone, to satiate
Their longing appetites,
Or drown those cumbrous cares, that would abate
The edge of their delights,
But, when they toil, and foil themselves, with sin,
Both to refresh, to purge, and cleanse them in.
6.
Thy Savior has begun this Cup to thee,
And thou must not refuse't.
Press then thy sin-swoll'n sides, until they be
Empty, and fit to use't.
Do not delay to come, when he does call,
Nor fear to want, where there is enough for all.
7.
Thy bounteous Redeemer in his blood
Fills thee not wine alone,
But likewise gives his flesh to be thy food,
Which thou ^ make thine own,
And feed on him, who has himself revealed
The bread of Life by God the Father sealed.
8.
Nay, he is not food alone, but physic too,
When ever thou art sick,
And in thy ^ strength, that thou mai'st do
Thy duty, and not stick
At any thing, that he requires of thee,
How hard soever it may seem to be.
9.
Make all the haste then that thou can to come,
Before the day be past,
And think not of returning to thy home,
Whilst yet the light does last.
The longer, and the more thou draw'st this wine,
Still thou shall find it more, and more divine.
10.
Or if thy Savior think it meet to throw
Thee in the Press again,
To suffer as he did: yet do not grow
Displeased at thy pain:
A Summer season follows Winter weather,
Suffering you shall be glorified together.
REVEL. 22. 17.

The Spirit, and the Bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And
let him that is a thirst, come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of
life freely.

The CONCLUSION.
IS this my period? Have I now no more
To doc hereafter? Shall my mind give over
Its ^ ^ thus, and idle be,
Or buss'd other wise? Should I not see
How to improve my thoughts more ^,
Before ^ these Heart School ^ by?
Sea-knowledge is an ^ ^,
An ^ that does not only ask
A ^ time, but challenges
To ^ until death.
Yet as in ^ they have a care
To call for ^ ^, and are
^
^
^
^
So ^
What I have done, ^
Perhaps I may ^
To alter, or to ^
And I may ^
With my great ^
From taking our ^
How I retain ^ old ^
And if it be his pleasure, I shall say
These ^ before others, that they may,
Or learn them too, or only censure me;
I Will wait with patience the success to see.
And though I look not to have leave to play,
For that this School allows not, yet I may
Another time perhaps, if they approve
Of these, such as they are, and show their love
To the School of the Heart, by calling for it,
Add other lessons more of the like sort.
The Learning of the Heart.
The Preface.
I Am a Scholar. The great Lord of Love
And life, my Tutor is: Who from above
All that lack Learning, to his School invites,
My Hearts my Prayer Book, in which he writes,
Systemes of all the Arts and Faculties:
First reads to me, then makes me exercise,
But all in paradoxes, such high strains,
As flow from none but love Inspired Brains;
Yet bids me publish them abroad and dare
TO excel his Arts above all other Arts that are.
Why should I not? me thinks it cannot be,
But they should please others as well as me.
Come then joined hands, and let our heart's embrace,
Whilst thus loves Labyrinth of Arts we ^;
I mean the Sidem's called ^:
Both ^, and ^.
With the higher ^, ^;
And Law, and ^
The Grammar of the Heart.
PSALM. 15. 2.

That speaks the Truth in his Heart.

MY Grammar, I define to he an Art,
Which teaches me to write and speak mine heart,
By which I learn that smooth tongued flatt'ries are
False Language, and in love irregular.
Among'st my Letters, Vow-wells I admit,
Of none but Consonant to sacred ^.
And therefore when my Soul in silence moans,
Half vowel'd sighs, and double deep thong'd groans,
Mute looks, and liquid tears in stead of words,
Are of the language that mine heart affords.
And since true love abhors all variations,
My Grammar has no moads nor conjugations:
Tenses, nor Persons, nor Declensions,
Cases, nor genders, nor comparisons:
What are my Letters are, my Words but one,
And on the meaning of it love alone.
Concard is all my Syntax and agreement:
Is in my Grammar perfect regiment.
He wants no Language that has learned to love,
When tongues are still, hearts will be heard above.
The Rethorick of the Heart.
PSALM. 45. 1.

My Heart is inaiting a good matter.

MY Rethorick is not so much an Art,
As an infused habit in mine Heart,
Which a sweet secret Elegance Instills,
And all my Speech with Tropes and Figures fills.
Love is the tongues Elixir, which does change
The ordinary sense of words, and range
Them under other kinds, dispose them so
That to the height of eloquence they grow,
Even in their native plainness, and must be
So understood as likes love and me.
When I say Christ, I mean my Savior;
When his Command'ment my behavior;
For to that end it was he ^ ^,
And to this purpose it is I bear his Name.
When I say Hallowed be thy name, he knows
I would be holy: for his glory grows
Together with my good, and he has not
Given more honor then himself has got
So when I say, Lord let thy Kingdom come,
He understands it, I would be at home;
To reign with him in glory. So grace brings
My love in me to be the ^ of Kings
He teaches me to say. Thy will be done,
But means he would ^ me do mine own;
By making ^ to ^
And so to rule my self and serve him both.
So when he says, My Son give me thine heart:
I know his meaning is, that I should part
With all I have for him, give him my self,
And to be rich in him from worldly pelf.
When he says come to me, I know that he
Means I should wait his coming unto me,
Since it is his coming unto me that makes
Me come to him, my part he undertakes.
And when he says, Behold I come, I know
His parpose and intent is I should go
With all the speed I can, to meet him whence
His coming is attract ve, draws me hence.
Thick folded Repititions in Love,
Are no ^, but strongly move
And bind ^ Attention. Exclamations,
Are the hearts heaven ^ Exaltions.
Epiphonemaes and Apostrophes,
Love likes of well, but no Prosopopes.
Not doubtful but careful deliberations,
Love holds as grounds of strongest Resolutions.
Thus love and I a thousand ways can find,
To speak and understand each others mind,
And descant upon that which unto others,
Is but plain Song, and all their Music smothers
^ that which worldly wit worms call nonsense,
Is many times loves purest Eloquence.
The Logic of the Heart.
1 Pet. 3. 15.

Be ready always to give an Answer to every man that asks you a Reason of the
Hope that is in you.

MY Logic is the faculty of Faith,
Where all things are resolved ^ be says;
And Ergoes drawn from trust and ^
Twist and tie Truths with stronger ^
Then either sense or reason: for the heart
And not the head is fountain of this Art.
And what the heart objects none can ^,
But God himself, till death the frame ^,
Nay Faith can after death ^ with dust,
And argue ashes into stronger trust.
And better hopes then Brass and ^ can
Be emblemes, of unto the outward man.
All my invention is to find what terms
My Lord and I stand in: how he confirms
His ^ to me, how I inherit
What he has purchased for me by his merit.
My judgment is submission to his will.
And when he once has spoken to be still.
My Method's to be ^ by him
What he ^, that I think most trim.
Loves Arguments, are all will, thou must,
What he says and commands are true and ^.
When to dispute and argue's ^ of ^,
Then to ^ and to ^ is ^.
FINIS.
