LONDON, Printed by A. Maxey for Timothy Garthwait, at the little North Door of
S. Paul's. 1657.

To the REVERENCE, LEARNING, and VIRTUES of DR SHELDON.
SIR,
THis comes not to bespeak you Patron of the Book to which it is prefixed; but
to acknowledge, and to make known unto the world, That you have been both a
Faithful Friend to the Great Author thereof, in Conserving; and also a Public
Benefactor in producing the Manuscripts here printed in this and the precedent
Volume, the Tenth and Eleventh Books of His Commentaries upon the Creed.

But, though I think I have done you some small right in making this
Acknowledgment; I fear, by occasion thereof, you may be thought by others, to
have done the Author and your self no small wrong. The Point wherein your
Judgment may suffer, will be, The Concrediting so Precious Deposita to so mean
a Person as my self. And yet to vindicate your self, and to comfort me, The
ensuing Narration may give some Arguments of Hope, That this was not done (sine
Numine) without the contrivance of Divine Providence, first putting together
diverse small particulars, and then advancing them to the effecting of a Work
not small.

The first stone of this Work was laid some 44 years ago, in my
School-Acquaintance, with a Virtuous and studious young Gentleman Mr. To.
Nettleton of Yorkshire. This Friendship being intermitted by the space of
fourteen years (he going to Oxon, and I to Cambridge, Anno 1617.) was
afterward renewed by meeting and Conference; which, though Casual and short,
did soon discover (as the Ointment in the right Hand will not long be hid) That
we had all this while been Disciples to One Man, though we had lived so many
years (without any the least Dr. Iackson.
Intelligence or Commerce) in Two several Academies. After This, there followed
a second Pause or Cessation of Twelve or fourteen years more: Toward the end
of which space, The Difficulties of the Times brought me to seek retirement in
Oxon; where, by the Mediation of Mr. Benson (a very Ingenuous person, and
Amanuensis to Dr. Jackson) I made suit to Dr. Newlin (Successor to our Author
in the Government of Corpus Christi Dr. Iackson made Dr. Sheldon and Dr. Newlin
Supervisors of his Will, and entrusted his Papers with them.
College) to view some Papers for my private Information, but could not obtein,
though upon condition to peruse them only in his own Lodgings; So careful and
cautelous was that Faithful Man, for which I honor and commend him.

This just and kind denial sharpened my former desires, and made me seek out a
Precator (a very Grave and Learned Man, well known to your self) by whose
Mediation I might obtein Dr. Lany.
from you, or by your help, what I could not otherwise get. Whereupon you were
pleased to give me so fair an Advousion of your Favor, as supported my hopes
for the space of three years more, when returning to Oxon and missing your
self, I made means a second time to Dr. Newlin, and got a sight of some of Dr.
Jacksons Papers. This was in the Year 1646.

In the year 1651, Mr. Nettleton being in London, and being very disirous of
the thing, entreated me to expend that small Acquaintance I had with the
Learned and Pious Dr. Hammond, in obteining of your self, and by your Mediation
of Dr. Newlin a sight of such Papers as Dr. Jackson left behind him; which you
granted and effected with so memorable alacrity, as did both mcourage Him,
(diverse others assisting the design also) to contribute toward the reprinting
of the first three Books ill See the Preface to the First Book.
printed in Quarto; and after that, toward the publishing of the Tenth,
(besides some charge in writing out part of this Eleventh Book;) and obliged me
to assist the best I could in doing of them all.

I have great cause to bless the Almighty for many blessings at all times, but
signally for Three bestowed upon me in these sad times of public calamity. 1.
That he has ever fed me with Food convenient for me; mine own bread being the
Bread of my Desires. 2. That he has repaired my other losses with a great
supply of Learned and Pious Acquaintance, greater perhaps, then the times
continuing prosperous would ever have afforded me; (so true is the Good Word of
God, Mark 10. 30.) Thirdly, That though I was forced from My Nest, (wherein I
said I shall dye) yet he suffered me not to be utterly deprived of all
opportunities to do him service. And I think my self bound to profess, that in
this Price (which God by your hand has put into mine) I take most comfort, as
hoping that my Negotiation therewith, by Gods gracious acceptance, will abound
to mine Account, and pass for a supplement or substituted Commutation of such
duties as I have otherwise been defective in. And I earnestly beseech all such
as were ever committed to my Tuition in the University, or to my Charge in Cure
of Souls in the Country, to serve themselves of these my endeavors (in another
man's Labors) so as out of them to repair all their damages sustained by my
negligence, omissions or deficiencie in duties toward them.

And now (Honored Sir) if I have not wearied you with this (...) (as it is
very nauseous to my self) I can subjoyn a second Series of Arguments, That Gods
good hand of Providence was in this Business throughout. If I ever made any
high menaces, or had Projects of doing any thing worthy a Clerk, the very
thoughts thereof before I die, are perished. And I became justly frighted into
this humbled despereing Temper, partly, by conversing with this Great Authors
Works, published twenty years ago, where I read this Passage (and I cannot but
subscribe to it:) [If the sins of this Land for forty years past were See his
Sermons upon Jer. 26. p. 32. See this Book, fol. 3716.
divided into ten parts, the sins of the Pulpit and of the Press would make A
Large Tenth.] Had not this Good Man been taken away from the evil to come, but
lived to hear the Pulpitings, and read the Printings of these last twenty
years, what would he have said? Would not he have reckoned them, Nine parts of
ten? Being then resolved, Periturae parcere Chartae, never to increase the
deplorable Bundels of Supervacuous Books by any composure of mine, I acknowledge
my self (as Caelibes and Improles are in a more especial manner bound to assist
the Widow and the Orphan) obliged to help out the more profitable works of
Learned men deceased.

As God, by convincing me of disabilitie, has taken away all hopes and desires
of publishing any Work of mine own; So he has given me an extraordinary
delight of serving out the works of this Man; and this delight has made me
able to take more pains in this, then ever I took in any other Book-businesse
throughout my whole life. Yea, God seems to have given me life beyond all
expectation, partly for effecting this Work. I said (in the year 1649) I shall
certainly go down to the grave; God strangely brought me back from the Gates of
Death (He only knows what more to suffer) I cannot see at present what else to
do, but to publish these Tracts, the Quintessence of which is, That of The
Resurrection of the Dead.

I have yet Two Things to trouble your patience with. The Former is, To secure
you, that I have made no Merchandise, no base Gain, no gain at all (for any
would be base in me) of those Jewels you committed to my Trust. The Later, To
assure you, That I have dealt as carefully and faithfully in the Publication of
These Tracts, as I would (if the Case had so been) the Author should have done
in mine. And yet if this satisfaction be too general to stay that wonderment
which happily will arise in your mind, when at the end of Chap. 43. you shall find
A Fragment of the Authors interserted: Be pleased over and above the Reasons
there given, to accept of this Following. The Opinion, [That the sins of those
Jews who crucified our Savior, See fol. 3373
(persecuted his Apostles, and stoned S. Stephen) were not visited upon them;
but that the Plagues respectively due for doing so, were fended off or
superseded by the signal virtue of Christ's Blood speaking better things then
that of Abel, and special Efficacy of His Prayers for them] was new, and
seemed, though quaint, yet very useful for us of suffering Condition.

I confess, I am scrupulous of losing any Fragment of this Authors, but was
highly tender of leaving out in that place, the least Grain of weight that
might add any show of proof to His intended Conclusion; which I would fain
have rendered as probable as might be: That we, who are to fill up the leavings
of Christ's afflictions ((...)) might more willingly and perfectly conform to
Our Captain, not only in Patience, but in Charity also; and be excited,
earnestly to solicit and employ the Interest we have in God through Christ,
chiefly for the Conversion and Salvation of our Adversaries, and then for
sparing them as to temporal punishments: That it may one day appear they fared
the better for those that fared worse for them, even for those whom they
counted the worst of men, the Troublers of Israel, the Anathemaes or Cursed
things.

If this will not satisfy you, I have no Refuge left, but to fly to the
Sanctuary where the Authors ashes lie, and to beg pardon of you, in whom, by
consignment of Will, his Person lives; which I presume you will the sooner
grant upon condition I cease to trouble you further. May you please then to sit
by a while, only to view how I demean my self (and to awe me into Reverence) in
my Addresses to the Common Christian Reader, who, by what he has here already
heard (and shall after read) will join in thanks to You, and Prayers for You,

With Your Affectionate Humble Servant in Christ, B. O.

To the CHRISTIAN READER, Grace from GOD, and Benefit from THIS BOOK.
COncerning the Author of these Learned and Godly Of the Author of the Work.
Tracts, I have spoke my mind so fully in the Prefaces to the First and Second
Volumes Printed in Folio some years ago, that I have nothing to do here, but to
own and avow what I there wrote, which by these presents I heartily do. And
when the Reader has perused this Book, I hope, he will confess, That I have
good reason, not only to continue, but to increase and advance my good Opinion
of Him; and say, He believed, and therefore spoke what is here to be read in
these Comments upon the Creed; and that Being dead, by Faith (and these
Writings faithful and true) he yet speaks, as the Oracles of God, concerning
Judgment to come, The Resurrection of the Dead, and Life Everlasting. Of the
Order of this, and other his Works.


Touching the Order of the whole Body of His Works, I have likewise so fully
expressed my self in the Preface to the Tenth Book, as, that to say any thing
more of That would be superfluous. I can only call to mind One useful
Particular, which I then forgot (though I had inserted it amongst my
Memorandums of things necessary to be accounted for to the Reader) the Omission
whereof is here to be repaired; and that is, About the Numeration of the
Folioes, or the Figures set on the tops of the first and following leaves
respectively.

The First Volume in Folio (Containing the Three First Books of Of the Figuring
the Folio Volumes.
this Authors Commentaries on the Creed) did end with the number 508. The tenth
Book (which is the second Volume as yet printed in Folio) did begin with Number
3001. To the Intelligent Reader asking a Reason of so great a Chasma or Skip; I
Answer, All the Numbers betwixt these Two, were left void and allowed according
to conjectural Computation for the reprinting in Folio of the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and 9th Books (only yet printed in Quarto, for that the Owner of the Copies may
not afford to put them into Folio) that so the whole, proceeding in a Continued
Series, might be more capable of a General Index at the last.

About the Order observed in This Book, there is so much said upon sundry
occasions in several Transitions, as has prevented (for though it follow in
reading, it was printed before this Preface) the pains here. So that it is the
Matter of this Eleventh Book, which must afford me stuff or matter whereon to
make a Preface.

Here is then published for the Readers behoof, and to his view, A Of the
Matter of this Eleventh Book.
TREATISE of that Knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which arises
from the right understanding and true Belief of His Sitting at the Right Hand
of God the Father; Of His Exaltation thereby to be Lord and Christ; or to His
Lordship and Dominion; which, being both of Propriety and Jurisdiction, has
annexed unto it, the Power of Judging the Quick and the Dead: And in order
thereunto, of Raising the Dead also, that both they, and those which shall be
found alive at His Coming, may by His Award or Sentence receive their Final
Dooms, according to their several Demeanours in the Body; when they that have
done Good shall go into Life Everlasting, which is the Gift of God; And those
that have done Evil (and have not their evil deeds done away) receiving the
wages of sin, shall go into Everlasting Fire.

This is the Short or sum of what is contained in the Five first Sections. The
whole Book consists of Six Sections.
The Sixth and Last consists of Thirteen Select Sermons, the fittest I could
choose out, to aid and accompany the precedent Discourses; especially to attend
the Tracts, Of Christ's coming to Judgment; Of the Resurrection; Of Life and
Death Eternal; which, as they most flagrantly set forth THE TERROR OF THE LORD,
so are they most likely, by startling and amateing the Conscience, to prepare
men's minds, that the Impressions of those Sermons may be most penetrative and
permanent.

As, in the last mentioned Tracts, methinks I find A Particular Summons
directed to my self, Prepare to meet thy God; Give an The Use of the last
Section.
Account of thy Stewardship; So in the annexed Sermons I find peculiar and
proper Remembrances of several things wherein I have done very foolishly, deeds
that ought not to be done. For this cause I bow my knees (and pray the Reader
to lift his heart up in my behalf) to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for
Pardon and Peace; and that what I have here printed in this Book, may so be
written in the Table of my heart, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
living God, that I may not only wait for, but haste to the Coming of the Day of
God.

Having transferred these things unto my self, and thus far made the Reader,
yea, the World it self, my Confessor, I hope none will offend if I show what
respective parts of the ensuing Work, may by others be usefully applied to
themselves. And first of all, The Sorrowful and rightly suffering soul (if his
actings be according) may reap harvests of Comfort from what Our Author has
written, About Judgment, Resurrection and the Life to Come: Whereas he that
adds sin to misery and wrath, may certainly presume all the Desolations and
Destructions God has brought upon the Earth, as so many Tastes and pledges of
Greater to ensue. The Woes past, are but Schiographies and portendments, scarce
beginnings of future evils. And I earnestly beseech all of the former sort, as
to fortify themselves with Arguments to Charity and forgiving injuries out of
Chap. 32. So to regulate their Conversation and Demeanor by the Directions to
be sound Chap. 35.

The Section Of Christ's coming to Judgment, is very useful for such as take
upon them places of Judicature, and most useful for such as judge in matters of
Highest Nature and Difference. The Precept of Deborah, Judge. 5. 10. Meditate ye
-- Ye that sit in Judgment; is the same with that of David, Psalm 2. 10, 12. Be
Wise --. Kiss the Son --. And the Question which David puts in that Golden
Psalm, Ne perdas, will again be put to the Question by the Son of David, when
he comes to judge the Psa. 58. 1
Judges of the Earth, Are your minds set upon righteousness, O ye Congregation?
And do ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of Men? Whether ye do or no,
will then be justly and finally judged.

The Tract Of the Resurrection, who can express the use of it? An astonishing
Meditation it is to think, I now see, as surely the eyes of some shall see,
those Christian brethren that fell in any late Battle, and were buried where
they fell, rising out of their places of Burial, (whether impleading or
forgiving one another) and with haste marching into the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
to see the day won or lost there; and whose Heads shall then be crowned with
Glory. Yet is this but as the drop of a bucket to the Ocean of that days
Terrors.

The Sermons upon that Precept of Christ, (I might say of Noah and Tullie) Do
as you would be done to are worth their weight in Gold of Ophir, and useful for
all Christians of what condition soever.

There came out a Book some sixteen years ago; entitled, Autocatacrisis
Ladensium; To the Party or Persons that Composed or applauded that Book
(wherein Our Author is named) I would especially recommend His Discourses upon
Romans 2. 1. presuming that that those (with the Verifications of them exhibited
in these late Revolutions) will convince Him or them sufficiently, That it is
no difficult matter to compile a Larger Volume of Particularities, wherein they
that have judged others, have, by doing over and over, again and again, the
same things, or things more then equivalent, condemned themselves, and
justified those whom they have condemned.

The Sermons upon 2 Chronicles. 24. and Matthew. 23. contein very sound reproof of the
Pharisaical Duplicitie, of such as built the Sepulchers of ancient, and yet
persecuted the present Prophets; and therein of such as in our days commend
the Lives, and condemn the Authors of the Deaths of Bishop Cranmer, Hooper,
Ridley, Ferrar, Father Latimer, etc. And yet destroy their successors in Order,
Discipline and Doctrine. I call heaven and earth to Record this day (not to
condemn such, but to convince them that they may be saved) That Those Men whom
they have cast out as enemies to the Church of England (and in Effect, by
driving them out from the Inheritance of the Lord, tempted, saying, Go serve
other Gods!) are The Men that bear the Burden and heat of the day in all
Contests betwixt parties of the English and Romish Churches, and that preserve
their undoers from being overborn with Romish Errors; And this they do upon
disadvantages unimaginable (save only to such as have experimented them) for
want of their own Libraries, Their former accommodations of Secessus and Otia,
etc.

Besides, Those Sermons will show, That the guilt of Blood will lie long upon a
Nation; That it justly may, and certainly will, be required of late Posterity,
unless A Signal Repentance of the same, and especial abstinence from the like
sins intervene. I appeal to the meekest Moses upon earth, what Degree of Guilt
he would apportion to that Community (suppose it in any Foreign Kingdom) or
the Posterity thereof, which being not only A Pretender to Christianity but
to the Purity thereof, did Sit as a Spectator, whilst a Tumultuous Tempest of
People for diverse hours together did hunt and chase an Aged man (were he good
or bad) unto the Death. Yet was this thing done in our Metropolis (which is a
kind of standing See Stows Annal. fol. 3043.
Representative of the whole Nation) some thirty years ago. Or what censure he
would pass upon three Kingdoms, the Generality whereof did, though but
expost-facto, only by rejoicing at the deed, consent to the Assassination of A
Prince the man whom the King had honored. Yet was this also done about the
same number of years since. It is true, Justice did treatably overtake the
Party that did this Idem fol. 3044.
Fact: But Who ever sorrowed for the Joy conceived at it? These two seem to
have been Portentuous Aboadments of Calamities ensuing; (as the daily visible
desolation and Profanation of Gods House, is of future woe:) And I remember
them not, as making Intercession against Israel, or as things I have whereof to
accuse mine own Nation with delight, but upon the same account that I call mine
own sins to remembrance, that God may be entreated for the Land, to blot them
out of His. And I beseech the Infinite Mercy to pardon these and all others,
as fully, freely, and upon the same terms I desire pardon for mine own.

I have but Two Things more to say (and the One concerns the Vulgar Reader) 1.
That this Book seems no way liable to the Objection of Obscurity, which has
been sometimes made against some other parts of this Authors Writings; the
Style here being more easy and Popular, as first prepared for His Charge at
Newcastle: Though to say the truth, The Darkness was most-what in the Readers
Eye, and not in the Object, or Authors Writings. 2. That the longer the world
lasts, the more seasonable every day then other will this Book be; yea, so it
must needs be, the Essential parts thereof treating of, and proving, Christ's
Coming to Judgment, The Resurrection, and Life Everlasting.

If any One shall either by reading the Book or the Preface be any thing
bettered, I beseech him make his Return in Prayers for the Church of England
(once the Envy and Fear, now, by the folly of her own children, made the scorn
of her Aemula) That the Lord would so build up her walls, set up her Gates, and
erect her Towers, That Her Militancie in his strength may be victorious for His
Truth, and at last changed into a Triumph in His Glory, Which shall be the
earnest Request of

Her most Unworthy Son, and the Readers Humble Servant in the Lord Jesus, B. O.

A TABLE Of the Principal Arguments of the several Sections and Chapters
contained in this BOOK.
SECT. I. Of Christ's Sitting at the Right Hand of God. Of the Grammatical sense
of the Words, and of the Real Dignity answering thereto.
CHAP. I. Of the Grammatical sense of the words, Heb. 10. 12. But this man
after he had offered one Sacrifice, etc. and whether they be merely
Metaphorical. page 3307 2. Of the Real Dignity contained in this Article; viz.
The Exaltation of Christ. That Christ was exalted both as the Son of God, and
the son of David p. 3311 3. In what sense Christ's humane Nature may; in what
sense it may not be said to be infinitely exalted. The Question concerning the
Ubiquity of Christ's Body handled p. 3317 4. A Paraphrase upon the sixth of S.
John. In what sense Christ's flesh is said to be truly meat, etc. What it is, To
eat Christ's Flesh, and drink his Blood. Of Eating and Drinking Spiritual and
Sacramental; and whether of them is meant, John 6. 56. Of Communion in one
kind, and Receiving Christ's Blood per Concomitantiam. Tollets Exposition of
[Except ye Eat And Drink] by disjunction turning, And into Or, confuted, and
Rules given for better expounding like Cases. How Christ dwells in Us, and We
in Him. The Application. All which be seasonable Meditations upon the Lords
Supper p. 3328 5. The Great Attribute of Christ, [His being the Chief Corner
stone] handled in the foregoing Chapter, prosecuted more amply in this. Christ
is the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. How Christians being built upon
this Foundation, do grow into an Holy Temple. p. 3348
SECT. II. Of Christ's Lordship or Dominion. Phil. 2. 11. That every tongue
should confess, etc. p. 3358
CHAP. 6. What it is to be a Lord. Though there be many called Lords; yet there
is but One Absolute Lord. ibid. 7. In what Respects, or upon what Grounds
Christ by peculiar Title is called The Lord. And first of the Title it self,
Secondly of the Real Grounds unto this Title 3362 8. What our confession of
Christ to be The Lord, imports, and how it redoundeth to the glory of God the
Father.
SECT. III. Of Christ's Coming to Judgment.
CHAP. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 10. insisted upon p. 3375 10. Of the Natural Notions which
the Heathens had, and the Internal Experiments which every true Christian may
have, answering to those Notions of a final Judgment 3377 11. By what Authority
of Scripture this exercise of the final Judgment is appropriated unto our Lord
Jesus Christ p 3390 12 The manner of Christ's coming to Judgment which was the
third General proposed in the ninth Chapter p. 3401
SECT. IV. Of the Resurrection of the Dead.
CHAP. 13. The Belief of the Article of the Resurrection, of high concernment,
malignantly impugned by Satan and his Agents: needs and deserves our best
Fortification. The Heathens had Implicit notions of a Resurrection. The
obstacle of impossibility removed by proof of this Conclusion [That though all
things were annihilated, yet God is able to retrieve or recover, The Numerical
same.] p. 3422 14. This Argument drawn from Seed sown [1 Cor. 15. 36. etc.] is
a concludent proof of the resurrection of the Body p 3434 15. The Objections
of the Atheist, and the Exceptions of the Naturalist, both put fully home, and
as fully answered. The falsitie of the Supposals and Paradoxes (rather then
Principles) of the Atheist discovered, and made even palpable by ocular
demonstration and by Instances in Bodies Vegetant and Sensitive. A Scruple that
might trouble some pious mind after all this, satisfied. A short Application of
the Doctrine contained in the whole Chapter p 3444 16 The Apostles method, 1
Cor. 15. 16, 17, 20. in proving the Resurrection peculiar, and yet Artificial.
His way of Natural or reciprocal Infeference both Negative and Assertive,
justified, and showed, That both these Inferences naturally arise, and may
concludently be gathered from the Text, and from the Principles of Christian
Belief. Wherein the witness (false upon supposition, ver. 14, 15.) should
consist. That Philosophical Principle, [Deus et Natura nihil faciunt frustra]
divinely improved. Gods special and Admirable works have ever a Correspondent;
that is some extraordinary end. How sin is taken away by Christ's Death; How by
his Resurrection. How we are justified by Christ's Resurrection. How we may try
our selves and know, whether we rightly believe this Article of the
Resurrection or no. p 3455
SECT. V. Of the Article of Everlasting Life.
CHAP. XVII. Romans 6. 21, 22, 23. What fruit had ye then of those things, etc.
The Connection of the fifth and sixth Chapters to the Romans. A Paraphrase upon
the sixth chapter. The importance of the phrase [Dead to sin] No Christians in
this life so dead to sin, as to come up to the Resemblance of Death natural.
True Christians dead to sin, in a proportion to civil death. All Christians (at
least all the Romans to whom S. Paul writes, did so) in Baptism profess
themselves dead to sin, and vow death to sin by a true Mortification thereof.
All have in Baptism, or may have a Talent of Grace as an Antidote or Medicine
against the deadly Infection of sin, as a strengthening to make us victorious
over sin.

Three Motives to deter us from the service of sin. 1. It is fruitless. 2. It
is shameful; 3. It is mortiferous; Two Motives to engage us in Gods service, 1.
Present and sweet fruit unto holiness. 2. Future happiness. p 3469

18. Of the fruitlesnesse of sin. Of the shame that follows and dogs sin, as
the shadow does the body; what shame is, whence it arises, and what use may be
made thereof. Of fame, praise and honor. Satan's stales, false shame and false
honor. The character of both in Greek and Latin. Of Pudor, which is always
Male Facti; of Verecundia, which may sometimes be, de modo recte Facti. Periit
vir cui pudor periit. Erubuit salva res est. p. 3477 19. We are many ways
engaged to serve God rather then to serve sin, though sin could afford us as
much fruit and reward as God does. But there is no proportion, no ground of
comparison between the fruits of sin, and the Gift of God. The case stated
betwixt the voluptuous, sensual life, and the life truly christian. Satan's
Method and Gods Method. A complaint of the neglect of grace. p. 3484 20. The
first and second Death both literally meant, The wages of sin; Both described,
both compared and showed, how and wherein the second Death exceeds the first.
The greater deprivation of good, the worse and more unwelcom death is. Every
member of the body, every faculty of the soul, the seat and subject of the
second death. A Map and scale: the surface and solidity of the second Death.
Pain improved, by enlarging the capacity of the patient, and by intending or
advancing the Activitie of the Agent. Three dimensions of the second death, 1.
Intensiveness. 2. Duration 3. Unintermitting continuation of Torment. Poena
damni and sensus, terms co-incident. Pains of the Damned Essential and
Accidental. Just to punish momentany sin with pain eternal. The reflection and
Revolution of thoughts upon the sinners folly; the Worm of conscience. p. 3490
21. Eternal life compared with this present life: the several tenures of both;
The method proposed. The instability of this present life. The contentments of
it short, and the capacities of men to enjoy such contentments as this life
affords, narrower. In the life to come the capacity of every faculty shall be
enlarged. Some senses shall receive their former contentments only eminenter as
if one should receive the weight in Gold for dross. Some formaliter. Of Joy
Essential, and Joy Accidental. p. 3500 22. Of the Accidental Joys of the life
to come. A particular Terrar or Map of the Kingdom prepared for the blessed
Ones, in a Paraphrase upon the 8 Beatitudes, or the Blessedness promised to the
8 qualifications set down in the 5. Matthew. Eternal life the strongest
obligation to all duties. Satan's two usual ways of tempting us, either per
Blanda, or per Aspera. p. 3510 23. The Philosophers Precept, [Sustine and
Abstine] though good in its kind, and in some degree useful, yet insufficient.
True belief of the Article of everlasting life and death is able to effect both
Abstinence from doing evil, and sufferance of evil for well-doing. The sad
Effects of the misbelief or unbelief of this Article of Life and Death Eternal.
The true belief of it includes a taste of both. Direction how to take a taste
of death eternal without danger. Turkish Principles produce Effects to the
shame of Christians. Though hell fire be material it may pain the soul. The
Story of Biblis. The Body of the second death fully adequate to the Body of
sin. Parisiensis his Story. A General and useful Rule. p. 3519. 24. The Body
of Death being proportioned to the body of sin, Christian Meditation must
apply part to part, but by Rule and in Season. The dregs and relics of sin be
the sting of Conscience, and this is a prognostic of the worm of Conscience
which is a chief part of the second death. Directions how to make right use of
the fear of the second death, without falling into despere, and of the hope of
life eternal, without mounting into presumption; viz. 1. Beware of immature
persuasions of certainty of salvation. 2. Of this Opinion, That all men be at
all times either in the estate of the Elect or Reprobates. 3. Of the
irrespective Decree of Absolute Reprobation. The use of the taste of death and
pleasures. The Turkish use of both. How Christians may get a relish of Joy
eternal by peace of Conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost and works of
Righteousness. Affliction useful to that purpose. p. 3529 25. The coldness of
our hope of Eternal Life, causes Deviation from the ways of righteousness,
and is caused by our no-taste or spiritual disrelish of that life. The work of
the Ministry is to plant this taste, and to preserve it in Gods people. Two
objects of this Taste. 1. Peace of Conscience; 2. Joy in the Holy Ghost. That
Peace may best be shadowed out unto us in the known sweetness of temporal
peace. The passions of the natural man are in a continual mutiny. To men that
as yet have no experience of it, the nature of joy in the Holy Ghost may best
be exemplified by that cheerful gladness of heart, which is the fruit of Civil
Peace. It is the prerogative of man to enjoy himself, and to possess his own
soul. In the knowledge of any truth there is joy; but true joy is only in the
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of saving truths. The difference between Joy and
Gladness in English, Greek and Latin. p. 3538. 26. Whether the taste of
Eternal Life once had, may be lost. Concerning sin against the Holy Ghost. How
temporal contentments and the pleasures of sin, coming in competition, prevail
so, as to extinguish and utterly dead the heavenly taste, either by way of
Efficiencie or Demerit. The Advantages discovered by which a lesser good gets
the better of a greater. p. 3547. 27. About the merit of good Works. The
Romanists Allegations from the force of the word [Mereri] among the Ancients,
and for the thing it self out of the holy Scriptures; the Answers to them all
respectively: Some prove Aut nihil, aut nimium. The different value and
importance of Causal Particles, For, Because, etc. A Difference between, Not
worthy, and unworthy. Christ's sufferings, though in time finite, yet of value
infinite. Pleasure of sin short, yet deserves infinite punishment. Bad Works
have the title of Wages and Desert to Death, but so have not Good Works to Life
Eternal. p. 3558. 28. Whether Charismata Divina, that is, The Impressions of
Gods Eternal Favor may be merited by us. Or whether the second, third and
fourth Grace and Life Eternal it self may be so. About Revival of Merits. The
Text Hebr. 6. 10. [God is not unjust, etc.] expounded. The Questions about
Merits and Justification have the same Issue. The Romish Doctrine of Merits
derogates from Christ's merits. The Question (in order to Practice or
Application) stated betwixt God and our own souls. Confidence in Merits, and
too hasty persuasions that we be the Favorites of God, two Rocks. God in
punishing Godly men respects their former good works. p. 3568. 29. Three
points: 1. Eternal Life the most free gift of God, both in respect of the Donor
and of the Donee. 2. Yet does not the sovereign Freeness of the Gift, exclude
all Qualifications in the Donees; rather requires better in them then in others
which exclude it, or themselves from it. (Whether the Kingdom of Heaven was
prepared for All, or for a certain number) 3. The first Qualification for
grace, is to become as little children. A parallel of the conditions of
Infants, and of Christians truly humble and meek. p. 3578 30. Matthew. 25. 34.
Then shall the King say to them on his Right hand, etc. Two General Heads of
the Discourse. 1 A Sentence. 2. The execution thereof. Controversies about the
sentence. Three conclusions in order to the decisions of those Controversies.
1. The Sentence of life is awarded Secundum Opera, not excluding faith. 2. Good
Works are necessary to salvation, Necessitate Praecepti and Medii: (And to
Justification too; as some say, Quoad praesentiam, non quoad Efficientiam.) The
third (handled in the next Chapter) Good Works though necessary, are not Causes
of, but the Way to the Kingdom. Damnation awarded for Omissions. Saint
Augustines saying, [Bona Opera sequuntur Justificatum, etc.] expounded. Saint
James 2. 10. [He that keeps the whole Law, and yet offends in one point, etc.]
expounded. Why Christ in the final Doom instances only in Works of Charity,
not of Piety and Sanctity. An Exhortation to do good to the poor and miserable;
and the rather, because some of those duties may be done by the meanest of men.
p. 3587 31. Jansenius his Observation and Disputation [about Merit] examined,
and convinced of Contradiction to it self, and to the truth. The Definition of
Merit. The state of the Question concerning Merit. Increase of Grace no more
meritable then the first Grace. A Promise made Ex Mero Motu, sine Ratione dati
and accepti; cannot found a Title to Merits. Such are all Gods Promises, Issues
of mere Grace, Mercy and Bounty. The Romanists of Kin to the Pharisee, yet
indeed more to be blamed then He. The Objection from the Causal Particle FOR,
made and answered.
SECT. VI.
CHAP. 32. Matthew. 7. 12. -- Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you,
etc. The misery of man, of the wisest of men in their pilprimage, to be
Wanderers too. The short way to Happiness. The Pearl of the Ocean; The Epitome,
Essence, spirits of the Law and the Prophets, Do as you would be done unto, The
Coherence, the Method; Christ advances This Dictate of Nature into an
Evangelical Law; Fortifies it, and gives us proper Motives to practice it. Two
grounds of Equity in this Law. 1. Actual Equality of all men by Nature. 2.
Possible Equality of all men in condition. Exceptions against the Rule. Answers
to those Exceptions. This Rule forbids not to invoke or wage Law, so it be done
with charity. Whether Nature alone bind us to do good to our enemies. God has
right to command us to love them. Plato's good communion. The Compendious way
to do our selves most good, is to do as much good as we can to others. The
Application. 33. Matthew. 7. 12.

The second General (according to the Method proposed Chap. 32. Sect. 5.)
handled. This Precept, Do as ye would be done to, more then equivalent to that,
Love thy neighbor as thy self: for by good Analogy it is applicable to all the
Duties of the first Table which we owe to God for our very being and all his
other Blessings in all kinds bestowed on us. Our desires to receive good things
from God, ought to be the measure of our Readiness to return obedience to his
will, and all other duties of dependence upon his Grace and Goodness. God in
giving Isaac did what Abraham desired; and Abraham in offering Isaac, did what
God desired. Two Objections made and answered, 1. That this Rule may seem to
establish the old Pythagorean Error of Retaliation, and the new one of Parity
in Estates. 2. That the Magistrate in punishing offenders (it seems) in some
Cases must of necessity either violate this Rule or some other. p. 3628

34. The Impediments that obstruct the Practice of this Duty, of Doing to
others as we would have done to our selves, are chiefly two, 1 Hopes and
Desires of attaining better estates then we at present have; 2. Fears of
falling into Worse. Two ready ways to the Duty. 1. To wean our souls into an
indifferency, or vindicate them into a liberty in respect of all Objects. 2
To keep in mind always a perfect character of our own afflictions and
releases or comforts. Two Inconveniences arising from accersite greatness or
prosperity, 1. It makes men defective in performing the Affirmative part of
this Duty; 2. It makes them perform some part of the Affirmative with the
violation of the Negative part thereof. A Fallacy discovered. An useful general
Rule 3640 35. Jer. 45. 2, 3, 4, 5. Thus says the Lord -- unto thee, O Baruch,
etc.

Little and Great terms of Relation. Two Doctrines. One Corollary. Times and
Occasions after the nature of things otherwise lawful. Good men should take the
help of the Anti-peristasis of bad times to make themselves better. Sympathy
with others in misery enjoined in Scripture; practiced by Heathens; Argia and
Portia: The Corollary proved by Instance, and that made the Application of the
former Doctrine 3648

36. On Jer. 45. latter part of ver. 5. Thy life will I give thee for a prey.
The second Doctrine handled, first in Thesi; touching the Natural essence of
Life in general. 2. In Hypothesi. Of the Donative of Life to Baruch, as the
case then stood. That men be not of the same opinion about the Price of life,
when they be in Heat, Action and Prosperity, which they be of, in dejection of
Spirit and Adversity; proved by Instances, Petrus Strozius. Alvares de Sand.
Gods wrath sharpens the Instruments, and increases the terror of death. Life
was a Blessing to Baruch, though it be showed him all those evils, from sight
of which, God took away good King Josiah in favor to him. Baruch as a man did
sympathize with the miseries of his people. As a Faithful man, and a Prophet of
the Lord, he conformed to the just will of God. The Application 3663 37. On
Romans 2. 1. Therefore thou art inexcusable O man, etc. From what Premises the
Apostles Conclusion is inferred. The limitation of the Conclusion to the
securing the Lawful Magistrate exercising Judicature according to his
Commission, and in matters belonging to his cognizance. David and Abab judging
persons (by the Prophets Art) feigned, did really condemn themselves. The sense
of the Major Proposition improved, by virtue of the Grammar Rule, concerning
Hebrew Participles; and by Exposition of the phrase. How the later Jews,
judging the deeds of their forefathers; did condemn themselves 3678 38. Second
Sermon on Romans 2. 1. 3690 39. Third Sermon on Romans 2. 1. A Romish Error
breeding doubt of Salvation, charged upon its proper evident ground; viz. Their
making the intention of a Bishop essentially necessary to the Consecration of a
Priest, and the intention of a Priest so necessary, that no Sacrament can be
without it. The Error of the Contrarii, teaching a preposterous immature
certainty of Salvation. The right mean betwixt, or cure of these extremities,
prescribed unto us by our Reformers of Blessed Memory, contained in the Public
Acts of the Church 3700 40. Fourth Sermon on Romans 2. 1. The third point, [How

SECT. I. Of Christ's Sitting at the Right Hand of God. Of the Grammatical Sense
of the words, and of the Real Dignity answering thereto.
CHAP. I. Of the Grammatical Sense of the words: And whether they be merely
Metaphorical.
Heb. 10. ver. 12. But this man, after he had offered one Sacrifice for sins
for ever, sat down on the right hand of God. From henceforth expecting till
his Enemies be made his footstool.
1. ALbeit the Right Hand be more worthy then the Left, yet some (rather
desirous to show their reading, then to edify their Readers or hearers) have
made Question, Whether it be a Note of greater Dignity to have place on the
Left Hand, or on the Right, near to the Fountain of honor or Supreme Majesty.
But all the Instances, which they bring, or can be brought, for pre-eminence of
place on the Left Hand, are but as Calenders out of date, or as Astronomical
Observations, purposed for Eastern Meridians, but mis-applyed to them of the
West. Whatever the Rites or Fashions of other Nations were, the Church of God
or Land of Jurie, in which God was only known, had no such Custom. Now the
Tenor of this Prerogative here mentioned, must be valued by the Scales of the
Sanctuary, not by the Heraldrie of Foreign Courts. Even in those Countries,
wherein, the Attendance on the Left Hand of Princes was more honorable then on
the Right; the only ground of the Subjects power or dignity so attending, was,
the Imbecility of the Prince, who ordinarily could not defend himself so well
on the Left-side, as on the Right. And as our uncomely parts have more
comeliness bestowed upon them; so the weaker side of greatest Princes had more
need of valourous and trusty Champions. And though Princes in all Ages have
been prone to honor, and Grace their special Favorites with place of more
honorable attendance, yet the warlike Princes of ancient times, made choice of
men most trusty and valourous for their Favorites. But the Almighty, unto
whose future designs the Rites and Customs of the Kings of Judah were (happily)
praefashioned, needs no Defendant, no assistant, either on the Right Hand, or
on the Left. The former occasion of imbecillitie, or need of Defendants being
set apart, as the Right Hand is ordinarily more worthy then the Left, so to be
on the Right Hand of Supreme Honor is simply more honorable, then to be on
the Left; specially according to the Custom of the Jews. The Sons of Zebedee,
or their Mother, or both, were not ignorant in rerespect of the general matter,
but in the particular Form, or Manner, or Circumstance of their Petition; when
they desired that the one might sit on their Masters Right Hand, and the other
on the Left in his Kingdom. To sit by him in his Kingdom, was, to their
apprehension, and according to the custom of their Native Country, a greater
Dignity then to stand by him, or to go in and out before him. To sit on the
Right Hand, was affected by the Mother, as a place of praecedence for her elder
Son, and therefore rank't See Genesis 48. 13, 14, 17.
in the former place in her Petition. She says not, That the one may sit on
the Left Hand, and the other on the Right; but that one may sit on the
Right Hand, and the other on the Left, Mat. 20. 21. That to sit on the
Right Hand of Majesty, was the greatest honor, whereof any Subject, or
inferior Prince in Jurie, was capable, may be gathered from the honor which
Solomon did unto his Mother Bathsheba, 1 King. 2. 19. The King rose up to meet
her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his Throne, and caused a seat
to be set for the Kings Mother, and she sat on his Right Hand. Nor has the
Royal Psalmist any better place for the Spouse, whose Dignity he sought to
emblazon, Psalm. 45. 9. Kings daughters were among thine honorable women, upon
thy Right Hand did stand the Queen in a vesture of gold of Ophir. To have the
power of superiors on the Right Hand, or for the enemy to have the Right Hand,
is, in Sacred Heraldrie a sign of victory or pre-eminence, whether in Civil or
Warlike proceedings. The greatest plague, and root of curses, which David did
wish unto the enemies of his God, and which did afterward fall on Judas the
greatest enemy of David's Son and Lord, was, that the wicked might be set over
him, and that the adversary might stand at his Right Hand, for so he knew that
he should be condemned, when he was judged, and that his prayers should be
turned into sin, Psalm. 109. 6, 7. The surest Anchor of David's Confidence, was,
Gods being on his Right Hand, Psalm. 16. 8. The Lord is at my Right Hand,
therefore I shall not slide, or fall. And the final Consummation of all the
happiness which he hoped for, whether in his own person, or in the person of
his expected Son, the Messiah, was, to be placed at the Right Hand of God. In
thy presence is fullness of joy, and at thy Right Hand there are Pleasures for
evermore, Psalm. 16. 11. And so will it be found at the last Day; when The Son
of Man shall set the Sheep on his Right Hand, and the goats on the Left: and
shall say to them on his Right Hand, Come ye Blessed --. But to them on the
Left, Go ye cursed --, Mat. 25. 33. etc.

2. So then, This Article of Christ's sitting at the Right Hand of God, is as A
Trophie of his Victory gotten over death, and over all the temptations of the
World, and the devil, whilst he lived on earth; and a certain Prognostic of
his final Triumph over all his succeeding enemies: for he must sit at the
Right Hand of God, until all his enemies be made his footstool. But, before we
come to decypher the Real Dignity here described, it may be questioned, whether
the Description it self be merely Metaphorical, or Symbolical; that is, a
language borrowed from the visible customs of men without any real sensible
Similitude between the things signified by the same words? That this Phrase of
Sitting at the Right hand of God is a mere borrowed speech, most Divines do
hold; giving us withal this General Rule, That no Corporeal Substance, Quality,
Habit, or Gesture, can be attributed unto God otherwise then (...), that is, by
a kind of Poetical Fiction, or Figurative speech, borrowed from the fashions of
men. The proper Logical Subject notwithstanding of this Rule or Maxim, must be
the Godhead, or Divine Nature in the Abstract: It holds not so truly of God,
or at least of every Divine Person. The Divine Nature or Godhead, is Simple,
Pure, and Immixt: The Godhead has neither eyes, nor ears, nor body, much
less can there be in it any distirction of Right Hand, or Left; yet may we not
deny but the Son of God, who is truly God, has eyes and ears, feet and hands,
Right Hand, and Left Hand, and all the parts of the humane body, which any
perfect man has. His Blood, though humane blood, is as truly the Blood of God,
as of Man. His Blood is the Blood of God, his Body the Body of God, in such a
sense, as neither the body, nor blood of any other creature are said to be
Gods, whose all things are in heaven and earth. His Flesh, and Blood, and all
the parts of his humane Body, are the Flesh, Blood, and parts of God in as
strict and proper sense, as our hands are said our own; that is, by strict and
Personal Propriety. The Son of God has flesh and blood, hands, and feet in
such a sense, as God the Father, or God the Holy Ghost has not.

3. But when it is said that Christ sits at the Right Hand of God, this must
be understood of God the Father, not of God the Son, for so it is expressed in
the Apostles Creed, that The Son of God, who was Crucified, dead, and buried,
and who rose the third day from the dead, now sits at the Right Hand of God the
Father Almighty. Now if God the Father have no body, no Right Hand, or
Left Hand, as God the Son has; the case seems clear, that Christ's sitting at
the right hand of the Father must needs be a speech merely Metaphorical,
borrowed from the custom of earthly Princes, to be placed at whose Right hand
is the greatest honor that can be to their chief Peers or Subjects. This is
most certain, if we speak of the Nature or Essence of the God head, or of the
Divine Person of the Father. Yet all this hinders not, why the Divine Majesty,
or Person of the Father, who is every where Essentially present, may not be
more Conspicuously present (in respect of created sights) in some visible
heavenly Throne, then in any other place. The Father (for ought we know) may
have a distinct Throne, and the Son another, It is probable that there are
distinct Thrones in Heaven.
or they may have distinct manifestations of Glory upon the same Throne, Rev.
3. 21. To confine the presence of God the Father, of God the Son, or of God the
Holy Ghost, to any visible Throne, were a gross Heresy. But that there may be
Real Emblems, or Representations, of the Blessed Trinity in heaven, as
conspicuous and sensible to blessed Saints and Angels, as the representations,
which have been made of them to Gods Saints, or people here on earth, who can
conceive improbable? The representations or pledges of the Blessed Trinity
have been diverse. Daniel law the Glory of the Father shadowed by the Ancient
of days, the Glory of the Son, represented by the similitude of the Son of
man. At our Saviors Baptism there was A voice from heaven, as an audible
Testimony of the distinct Person of the Father. Christ as Man, was the
conspicuous seat or Throne of God the Son; and the Dove, which appeared unto
John, a visible pledge of the Holy Ghost. And may not the Church Triumphant
have as punctual representations or pledges of this Distinction no less
sensible, though more admirable, then the Church militant has had here on
earth?

4. It is not then altogether so clear that this Title, of Christ's Sitting at
the right hand of God the Father, is borrowed from the Rites or customs of the
Kings of Judah; as it is questionable, whether this Rite or custom amongst
them were not framed after the Pattern of the heavenly Thrones or
representations of celestial dignities; so we know the earthly Sanctuary was
framed according to the pattern of the heavenly Sanctuary. Our Fathers had the
tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he appointed, speaking unto Moses,
that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen, Act. 7. 44.
Ex. 25. 40. And our Apostle says, Heb. 8. 5. Those served unto the pattern or
shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned by God, when he was about to
finish the tabernacle. See (says he) that thou make all things according to
the pattern showed to thee in the mount. But it may be the pattern showed to him
in the Mount, was but a Show, or Mathematical Draught of the material
Tabernacle, which he was to erect; and yet is styled an heavenly pattern, or
heavenly thing, because it was represented from heaven by God himself; yet so
represented without any real Tabernacle answerable to it in heaven. I could
subscribe to this interpretation, if the Apostles Inference, Heb. 9. 23, 24.
did not prove or presuppose something more. It was then necessary that the
similitude of heavenly things should be purified with such things, but the
heavenly things themselves (are purified) with better sacrifices then these;
for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are
similitudes of the true Sanctuary, but is entered into very heaven, to appear
now in the sight of God for us. But has he the whole heavens for his
Sanctuary? or is there as real a Distinction of places, or Mansions in the
heavens, as there was of Courts or Sanctuaries in the material, or in Solomon's
Temple? We have such an high Priest (says Saint Paul) as sits at the right
hand of Heb. 8. 1, 2.
the throne of the majesty in the heavens, and is a Minister of the
Sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man:
and, Ephesians. 1. 20. The father of glory set him at his own right hand, (...), in
the heavenly places. Some Distinction, between the Throne of Majesty, and
Christ's humanity, was apprehended surely by Saint Steven, Act. 7. 55. He being
full of the Holy Ghost, looked steadfastly into heaven, and saw the Glory of
God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God: the Object of his sight was
surely Real, not a mere vision in the air, for he saw the heavens open, and by
their opening found opportunity to pry with bodily eyes (but bodily eyes
extraordinarily enlightened by the Spirit of God) into heaven it self, and to
take a view of the land of Promise, and the Sanctuary pitched in it. The Divine
Essence, or Person of God the Father, he could not see; and yet he saw the
Glory of God, and Christ at the Right Hand of this Glory. But he saw Christ
Standing, and not Sitting, as here it is said. All is one, It is the height of
Christ's Exaltation, that He has the pre-eminence to Sit upon his Throne in the
immediate presence of God the Fathers Glorious Throne. But this prerogative of
Sitting upon his Throne, does not tie him to such perpetual Residence, that he
may not Stand when it pleases him; and it seems it was at this time this great
Judge his pleasure to Stand, as a Spectator of his blessed Martyrs Combat, and
for the present, as a Witness against these his malicious Enemies, which
afterward were to be made his Footstool. Now was that of the Psalmist, Psalm.
102. 19. verified, He has looked down from the height of his Sanctuary, out
of the heaven did the Lord behold the earth.

5. But if Christ have a Visible Throne or Sanctuary in heaven, how is it
true, which Saint Steven says, Acts 7. 48, 49. The most high dwells not in
Temples made with hands, as says the Prophet: Heaven is my throne, and earth
is my footstool, what house will ye build for me, says the Lord? or what
place is it that I shall rest in? has not my hand made all these things? And
if God dwell not in any Sanctuary which he has made, how can he have any
Visible Sanctuary in heaven? For even the heaven of heavens, every creature,
whether visible or invisible, are the works of Gods hands. To this, the Answer
is easy, when the Prophet says, God dwells not in Temples made with hands,
he excludes only the works of men's hands, not all created See Mr. Mede, Places
appropriate.
Thrones or Sanctuaries made immediately by God himself. For, as the Apostle
says, Heb. 8. 2. Christ is a Minister of the Sanctuary, which the Lord has
pitched, and not man. And, Hebr. 9. 11. Christ, being come a high Priest of
good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
hands; that is, not of this building etc. Thus much of the Grammatical, or
Literal meaning of these words. As for this Opinion of Distinction of Thrones
in heaven, as I dare not boldly avouch it, so I am afraid peremptorily to deny
it. For, Peremptory Negatives in Divine Mysteries oft-times sway more
dangerously unto Infidelity, then Affirmative Paradoxes do to Heresy. The
Affirmative, in this Mystery, is (in my opinion) more safe and probable then
the Negative. However, The Point which all of us are bound absolutely to
Believe, is, That this Article, of Christ's sitting at the Right Hand of God,
does contain the height of His Exaltation, far above all principality, and
power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
world, but also in that which is to come, Ephesians. 1. 20. (...), God (says the
same Apostle, Phil. 2. 9.) has very highly exalted him, and given him a Name
which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jesus every knee should Bow --
etc. And seeing every other Article in this Creed is conceived in literal
distinct terms; I see no reason why we should believe this Article (of Christ's
sitting at the Right Hand of God) alone, should be represented unto us in
Terms Poetical, or merely Metaphorical. Howbeit, Christ's sitting at the
Right Hand of God the Father, according to the Literal meaning of these words,
does by way of Real Emblem import, that Christ's Humane nature is exalted far
above Angels, etc. which are often said to Stand, or Attend before, or about
the Throne of God, but not to sit on His Throne, or at his Right Hand. For unto
which of them said He at any time, Sit on my Right Hand --? Heb. 1. ver. 13.

CHAP. II. Of the Real Dignity contained in This Article; viz. The Exaltation
of Christ. That Christ was exalted, both, as the Son of God, and as the Son of
David.
1. THe Dignity of this Name, and the Realitie of Dignity answering unto it, is
further set forth, in the First Chapter to the Hebrews, ver. 3, 4, 5. He (sat
down, or) sits on the Right Hand of the Majesty on High (or in highest
places) and is made so much more excellent then the Angels, by how much he has
obtained a more Excellent Name then they. For, unto which of the Angels said he
at any time, Thou art my Son, this day begat I thee? And again, I will be his
Father, and he shall be my Son? But if these two Scriptures were literally
meant, as most Divines grant, the one of David, the other of Solomon, why may
not the Title of Gods Sons agree as literally to Angels, as to David or
Solomon? Though these two eminent Princes, as Gods Vicegerents on Earth, were
Solo Deominores, yet was David in the height of his Greatness too low, and
Solomon in the amplitude of his Royalty too little, to be (in all points) full
peers to the meanest Angel that attends Gods Throne. And yet were not both of
them too great to be but Mapps or Models of Evangelical Excellencies. It was
the height of both their Excellencies to be Shadows or Types of that Son of
David, concerning whom the Lord had sworn by His Holiness, (a most faithful
Oath from which he would not shrink; Psalm. 132. 11. and Psalm. 89. 3, 4, 35,
36.) that He should endure stable for ever, and that his Throne should be as
faithful a witness in Heaven, as either Sun or Moon. Selah. All the Royalty,
Power, or prosperity, which David or Solomon enjoyed, were but as pledges or
earnests, for the time present, of that mighty power and excellency wherewith
the Son of David was (after that, in the fullness of Time he had humbled
himself) in the fullness of Glory to be invested. But, as we say, Homo pictus
est Homo, and no man says, Leo vivus est Homo; A dead Corpse or Picture of man,
does better brook the name of a man, then a live Lion or other creature endued
with sense: So David and Solomon, in that they were Types of Christ, might be
more capable of being styled Gods Sons; or, of being begotten to that earthly
Empire, which was the Map or shadow of his only begotten Sons eternal
Inheritance, then the Angels were. The greatest Angels of God (whose presence
David did reverence as Gods Ambassadors) are servants to the Son of David. For
so the Apostle, Heb. 1. 6. interprets that of Psalm 97. ver. 7. Let all the
Angels of God worship him. No marvel then if David (when he saw as much of his
Glory, as he or some other Psalmist, Psalm. 97. did) instile him His Lord,
Psalm. 110. 1. That all the Glory and Dignity, which the Apostle seeks to set
forth by the testimony of the Psalmist, Psalm 45. 6, 7. Psalm 102. 25, 26. is
comprehended in this Article of Christ's Sitting at the Right Hand of God, the
Apostle supposes, Heb. 1. 13, 14. For so he concludes, by way of an
Epiphonema, (the sum of all, which he had said before;) unto which of the
Angels said he at any time, Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine
enemies thy footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to
minister for their sakes, which shall be heirs unto Salvation? It is A
Doctrine full of Comfort, that the Blessed Angels, the Powers and
Principalities celestial, one and other, should be at the command of this our
High Priest, who can compassionate our estate much better then any of them can.
As they had a Charge given concerning him in the days of his humiliation here
on earth; So he now being ascended up to his Father, gives them the same Charge
over us, to preserve us in all our ways. It is on our part required, that we
make His ways, Our Ways; otherwise we have no just assurance of the Angels
vigilancie over us. But have they this Charge over all of us? or only over
some few that are Predestined unto Salvation? The Apostle says, All of them
are sent forth to minister to such as shall be heirs of Salvation, and All of
Us, whom God has called and made partakers of his Word and Sacraments, are
under the Promise, and in the estate of the Sons of God; And if we be sons,
then are we heirs: yet Haeredes praesumpti, non apparentes, Heirs Presumed, not
Heirs Apparent unto Salvation. To be Heirs Apparent, is proper to the
Predestinate only, or to the Elect. But of the Doctrine and Use concerning
Angelical Protection and ministry for our good, elsewhere. It shall suffice to
give you notice by the way, that This last quoted place Heb. 1. 14. does
evidently refute a Curious Distinction of Orders amongst the Angels, as if some
were Angeli astantes, others ministrantes: one Order of Angels that stand in
the presence of God; because the Angel Gabriel gives himself this Title, Luke
1. 19. And another Order of ministering Angels; whereas our Apostles speech is
general, that All the Angels (and under this universalitie he comprehends even
the most noble Order of heavenly creatures) are ministering spirits, sent forth
for our good. If they, which are said in Scripture to stand before God, be
either Angels or created substances inferior to the Son of God, they are
sometimes, at least by courses, ministrantes, ministering spirits. So that to
stand before God, or to minister for our good, is no true note of any
Distinction of Order betwixt Angels, but only of the vicissititude of their
service. They, which are to be sent forth, stand in the presence of God to
receive their instructions, and at their return, stand before God to deliver
the effect or issue of Job 1. 6.
their Embassage.

2. But as diverse writers in the Romish Church, not balancing other places of
Scripture with this Place of our Apostle last cited, have framed a needless
Distinction of Orders amongst the Angels: So some others, opposite enough to
them, offend no less by weighing this place alone. For so far has the
misapprehended Doctrine of Predestination, and Certainty of their own Estate
in Salvation, misswaded some, as they have not been afraid to affirm, That the
Angels are in some sort inferior to themselves, because They minister to them
as they are Heirs of Salvation. Ministers they are indeed, yet not to us, but
to God or Christ, though for our good; So is every See Mr. Mede, upon 1 Cor. 4.
1
Magistrate, so is every Pastor in his place; yet God forbid that inferiors
should hence collect, That their Magistrates and Pastors should be Inferior to
all them, for whose good they are Ministers.

3. The next Point to be examined is, the Extent of this our High Priests
Exaltation; about the Bounds or limits whereof, the Controversies are more then
any difficulties in the Rule of Faith do minister; (but not so many as men of
rash or audacious understandings make;) and the most of them prosecuted with
greater vehemency of contention, then the spirit of sobriety, which should be
in every good Christian, will approve. The Questions of more profitable Use,
are generally Two; The First concerns the Logical Subject of Christ's Exaltation
comprehended in this Title, of Sitting at the Right Hand of God, and the like:
And the Issue is this, Whether Christ be exalted only as he is the Son of
David, or as he is the Son of God? or according to both his natures, as well
Divine, as humane? The second Quaerie is, about the Extent or Limits of the
Exaltation of his humane Nature. The one Question, as Logicians speak, is about
the Extent or limit of the Subject; The other about the Extent or limit of the
Attribute. That Christ was exalted according to his Humane Nature, or as he was
the Son of David, all Christians agree. But that he should be exalted as God,
or according to his Divine Nature, which is absolutely Infinite, may well seem
impossible for Christ was exalted according to both Natures.
the matter, and for the Phrase very harsh. Howbeit, this is avouched by many
Orthodoxal and worthy Divines. And if Christ be, as most Protestants avouch,
our Mediator, Secundum utr amque naturam, according to Both Natures, why may he
not be said to be Exalted according to Both Natures? Yet a Difference there is,
which will disjoynt this Consequence; For to be a Mediator betwixt two, does
not necessarily include any Defect or inequality in the party mediating, in
respect of the parties between whom he is a Mediator. Whereas to be Exalted
does necessarily include, or presuppose, some Lower degree, from which he is
Exalted to an higher. And if Christ, according to his Divine Nature, be always
equal to God the Father; he was, and is, and shall be Absolutely Infinite. And
Absolute Infinity cannot admit of any Degrees, specially of Exaltation. This
necessarily argues, that Christ's Divine Nature could, in it self, receive no
Degree of Diminution, or Exaltation. If then according to his Divine Nature he
was exalted, this Exaltation was not by any Real Addition of Dignity to his
Nature, but only quoad nos, in respect of us. And it is (perhaps) one thing to
say, that Christ was Exalted according to his Divine Nature; Another to say,
That Christ was Exalted as he was the Son of God. However, thus much we are
bound to believe, and thus much we may safely say, That Christ as God, was
exalted in the same Sense and manner, that he was Humbled as God. Now, that the
Son of God, who was as truly God, as God the Father; truly equal to God the
Father, did truly humble himself unto death, even to the death of the Cross;
was in the first Chapter of our Eighth Book, deduced out of the second to the
Philippians. Nor did he humble himself only according to his Humane Nature, for
he humbled himself, not only by his life and death here on earth, but by taking
the Humane Nature, in which he was humbled. The Humane Nature could not be
humbled by being united to his Divine Nature, but rather Exalted. So that the
first and Prime Subject of his humiliation was, if not his Divine Nature, yet
his Divine Person. The Person of the Son of God was humbled by his Incarnation
or Conception, by his Birth, by his Life, by his Death and Passion. And for
every degree of his humiliation, there is a correspondent degree of his
Exaltation, by his Resurrection, by his Ascension into heaven, and by his
Sitting at the Right Hand of God the Father. In what Sense our Apostle says,
He was humbled according to his Divine Person, has been discussed at large
before. The sum was this; If he, that thought it no robbery to be equal with
God, had been at any time pleased to have assumed a body or created substance
into the unity of his Infinite Person, such Glory and honor was unto that
his body or created substance due, as exceeds the Glory and honor of all
other bodies, or created substances, infinitely more then any creature can
possibly exceed another. And yet we know that the Son of God, who was from
Eternity equal to his Father, did in the Fullness of Time assume into the
unity of his Divine Person, a Body and Soul subject to all the infirmites
(sin only excepted) that humane nature is capable of: And by assuming such a
body, and by exposing it to all the miseries of mortality, the Son of God was
truly said to be humbled: and the Degrees of his humiliation were as many and
large, as are the Degrees by which his immortal glorified Body does exceed his
mortal Body; as many and large, as are the Degrees of Honor, and Excellency
betwixt that Royal Priesthood which now he exercises; and the Form of a
Servant wherein he appeared. So that not only the Humane Nature of the Son of
God, but the Son of God in his Humane Nature, is truly exalted according to all
the Degrees of his former Humiliation. But is this all that we are bound to
believe, or may safely acknowledge concerning the Exaltation of Christ, both as
he was the Son of God, and as he was the Son of David?

4. If this were all, then his Exaltation as the Son of God should merely
consist, in the Abdication or putting off the Form of a Servant. It could not
include, or presuppose, any positive Ground of any new and Real Attribute, but
only a Relation to his former humiliation. Some good Divines (as well Ancient
as modern) suppose, that albeit man had never sinned, yet should the Son of God
have been incarnate; that is, have taken our nature upon him; yet our nature
not humbled or obnoxious to death, but always clothed with glory and
immortality. For Illustration or Example sake; Suppose the Son of God had
taken an humane body altogether as glorious as now it is, from the very first
moment of its assumption into the unity of his Divine Glorious Person; Could
the assumption of such a body, how glorious soever, or how perpetual soever
its glory had been, have added any least degree of Exaltation unto the Son of
God? It could not. There had been indeed an Exaltation of the body so assumed,
but none of the Nature or Person assuming it. How then is the Son of God said
now to be Exalted, by his bodily Ascension into Heaven, or by his Sitting at
the Right Hand of the Father in our Nature, wherein he was formerly humbled?
Take the Resolution plainly thus. God the Father had remained as glorious as
now he is, although he had never created the world. For the creation gave much
even all they had, to things created; it gave nothing unto God, who was in
Being infinite; yet if God had created nothing, the Attribute of Creator could
have had no real Ground, it had been no real Attribute. In like manner, Suppose
the Son of God had never condescended to take our nature upon him, he had
remained as Glorious in his Nature and Person, as now he is; yet not glorified
for, or by, this Title or Attribute of Incarnation. Or suppose he had not
humbled himself unto death by taking the Form of a Servant upon him; he had
remained as glorious in his Nature and Person, and in the Attribute of
Incarnation, as now he is: but without these glorious Attributes of being our
Lord and Redeemer, and of being the Fountain of Grace and Salvation unto us.
All these are Real Attributes, and suppose a Real Ground or foundation; and
that was, his humbling himself unto death, even unto the death of the Cross.
Nor are these Attributes only Real, but more Glorious, both in respect of God
the Father, who was pleased to give his Only Son for us; and in respect of God
the Son, who was pleased to pay our ransom by his humiliation, then the
Attribute of Creation is. The Son of God then, not the Son of David only, has
been Exalted since his death, to be our Lord, by a new and Real Title, by the
Title of Redemption and Salvation. This is the Sum of our Apostles Inference
concerning our Saviors Exaltation, Phil. 2. 11. That every tongue should
confess that Jesus Christ is The Lord unto the Glory of God the Father. To
shut up this Point; Though Christ Jesus be both our High Priest and Lord, not
only as he is the Son of David, but as he is the only begotten Son of God, and
so begotten from all Eternity: yet was he neither begotten a Priest nor Lord
from all Eternity, but made a Priest, and made a Lord in time. The Word of the
Oath, (says the Apostle, Heb. 7. 28.) which was since the Law, makes the Son
a Priest, who was consecrated for evermore. And in the very same Charter,
wherein this Word of the Oath, or uncontrollable Fiat, for making the Eternal
Word, an Everlasting Priest, is contained; this Peculiar Title of Lord is first
inferred: For so that 110th Psalm begins: Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit thou at
my right hand, until I make thine Enemies thy footstool. Not that Adonai
imports less Honor or Majesty then Jehovah does; as the Jews and Arians
ignorantly and impiously collect; but with purpose to notify, that this Title
of Lord, or Adonai, was to become as peculiar to Jehovah the Son of God, as the
Title of Cohen or Priest. But this Title of Lord, as peculiar to Christ, will
require, and does well deserve, a peculiar discourse; and the place allotted
it, is in the beginning of the second Section.

5. Now for Use, or Application; These ensuing Meditations and Considerations
offer themselves. What branch of sorrow, of bodily affliction, or anguish of
soul or Spirit, can we imagine incident to any degree, condition, or sort of
men, to any son of man at any time, unto which the waters of Comfort may not
plentifully be derived from this inexhaustible Fountain of Comfort comprised in
This Article of Christ's Sitting at the Right Hand of God the Father Almighty?
No man can be of so low, dejected, or forlorn estate, for means or friends, re
or spe, either by birth or by misfortune, but may raise his heart with this
Consideration, that it is no servitude or beggerie, but freedom or riches, to
be truly entitled A Servant to the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; to whom
Angels and Principalities, as Saint Peter speaks, (even those Angels and
Principalities, to whom not Kings and Monarchs, but even Kingdoms and
Monarchies are Pupils) are subject, and his fellow servants. Or in case any
poor dejected soul should be surprised with distrust or jealousy lest his
Lord, in such infinite height of Exaltation and distance, should not from
heaven take notice of him thrown down to earth; let him, to his comfort
consider; That the Son of God, and Lord of Glory (to the end he might assure
us, that he was not a Lord more Great in himself, then Gracious and loving unto
us) was pleased for a long time to become a Servant, before he would be made a
Lord; and a Servant subject to multitudes of public despights, disgraces, and
contempts; from which ordinary servants, or men of forlorn hopes are freed. If
he willingly became such a Servant for thee, to whom he owed nothing, wilt not
thou resolve to make a virtue of necessity, by patient bearing thy meannesse
or misfortunes for his sake, to whom even Kings owe themselves, their Scepters,
and all their worldly glory? But though it be a contemplation full of comfort
to have him for our Supreme Lord and Protector, who sometimes was a Servant
cruelly oppressed by the greatest Powers on earth, without any power of man to
defend or protect him; yet the sweet streams of joy and comfort, flow more
plentifully to all sorts and conditions of men from the Attribute of his Royal
Priesthood. To be a Priest, implies as much as to be a Mediator or Intercessor
for averting Gods wrath, or an Advocate for procuring his Favors and
blessings. * And what could Comfort her self, wish more for her children
(suppose she had been our mother) then to See 8. Book Chap. 15.
have Him for our perpetual Advocate and Intercessor at the Right Hand of God,
who is equal to God in Glory, in Power, and Immortality; and yet was
sometimes more then equal unto us in all manner of anguish, of grievances and
afflictions, that either our nature, state, or casual condition of life can be
charged with. * Albeit he knew no sin, yet never was the heart of any the most
grievovs sinner, no not whilst it melted with penitent tears and See 8. Book
Chap. 11.
sorrow for misdoings past, so deeply touched with the fellow-feeling of his
brothers miseries, of such miseries as were the proper effects or fruits of
sin, as the heart of this our High Priest was touched with every man's misery
and affliction, that presented himself with prayers unto him; his heart was as
fit a Receptacle for others sorrows of all sorts, as the eye is of colors. Who
was weak, and he was not weak? who was grieved, and he burned not? who was
afflicted and he not tormented?

6. There be Two more special and remarkable Maxims of our Apostles for our
comfort; The One, Heb. 2. 10. That Christ was consecrated to his Priesthood
through afflictions: And consecrated through afflictions more then ordinary,
See 8. Book Chap. 14.
through the sufferings of death and torments more then natural; to the end
that being thus consecrated he might become a merciful and faithful
High Priest; a Priest not only able to sanctify our afflictions to us, but to
consecrate and anoint us through patient suffering of afflictions, to be more
then Conquerors, even Kings and Priests to our God. So he says, Rev. 3. 21. To
him that overcomes will I give to sit with me in my throne, even as I
overcame, and sit with my Father in his throne. The other remarkable Speech of
our Apostle is, Heb. 5. 8. Albeit he were The Son, yet he learned obedience by
the things which he suffered. Being infinite in knowledge as he was God, and of
most perfect knowledge as he was man, he could learn nothing by conversing here
on earth with men, but only Experience of Godly grief and sorrows for our
follies and impieties. Such sorrows were the proper fruits of our Sins: we
brought them forth, and he did taste the bitterness of them. This then is our
Comfort, That whatsoever he could learn on earth, he cannot possibly forget in
heaven; we have, and ever shall have him, whilst he is in heaven and we on
earth, An High Priest, which will be touched with compassion of our miseries.
The End of his coming down from heaven, and his investiture in the Form of a
Servant, was, that he might be Consecrated through afflictions here on earth,
to be a merciful and faithful High Priest, and Mediator between God and man.
And this Consecration, which was the End of his coming down, being
accomplished; the End of his Ascension into heaven, and of his Sitting at the
Right Hand of God in our nature, was, that he might make Intercession for us,
out of the fresh, and never failing memory and Experience of his own former
grief and sorrows for our sins. And what good thing is it then, which he will
not ask of his Father for us? And what is it, that our heavenly Father for his
sake will not give us? Nothing in heaven or earth, if we ask it in Faith, and
as we ought.

CHAP. III. In what Sense Christ's Humane Nature may, in what Sense it may not
be said to be Infinitely Exalted. The Question concerning The Ubiquitie of
Christ's Body handled.
1. THe Article of Christ Sitting at the Right Hand of God, in the Construction
which all make of it, contains, The Height of his Exaltation. And highly
Exalted he was; if not according to both Natures, the Divine as well as the
Humane; yet as properly Exalted as he was the Son of God, as in that he was the
Son of David. When we say he was truly Exalted; and truly Humbled, as he was
the Son of God; our meaning is, That the true and Prime Subject, as of his
Humiliation, so of his Exaltation, was not only See Book 8. Chap. 1.
his Humane Nature, but his Divine Person. Yet when we say, that his Divine
Person was the proper Subject of his Humiliation and Exaltation, we mean, as we
say in the Schools, Subjectum Attributionis, not, Subjectum Inhaesionis. His
Humiliation and Exaltation are Real Attributes, and the proper Subject of these
Real Attributes, was, not only his Humane Nature, but at the least his Divine
Person. Yet are they Really Attributed to him without any Real Alteration, or
internal change, either in his Divine Nature, or Person. His Divine Person was
not lessened in it self by his humiliation, nor was it augmented in it self by
his Exaltation. And yet it was Really Humbled, and Really Exalted.

2. His Humane Nature is not only the true and proper Subject of his
Exaltation, but it is withal Subjectum inhaesionis. His Exaltation in it, or
according to it, includes a true and Real Change in it self, not only in
respect of us, or of the Titles which we attribute or ascribe unto it: His
Humane Nature in his Humiliation was clothed with mortality, as with its inner
Garment, and had the Form of a Servant, as an outward Vesture, upon it. In his
Exaltation he put off Both, and clothed the Humane Nature with his
Immortality; and covered and adorned his immortal Nature with the Robes of
endless Glory and Majesty. This Real Alteration and internal Change all do
grant. The Question only is concerning the Bounds or Limits of that Glory,
Majesty, and of other Gifts, and Graces, according to all which his Humane
Nature was really and internally changed and Exalted. But shall we take upon us
to set Bounds to the Glory, Power, and Majesty of the Son of Gods Humane
Nature? God forbid. One thing it is to set Bounds unto them, Another to
acknowledge that they are absolutely Boundless and illimited.

3. Here I must be enforced to touch a Sore or Breach in the Church of The
difference about the Ubiquitie of Christ's Body rather Verbal then Real.
God, which happy were it for Reformed Religion, had it been made up or
Cemented with their blood which first did make it, or being made did seek to
make it wider; I mean the Bitter Controversy, between the Lutheran, and other
German and Helvetian Churches. How easily this breach, concerning the Manner of
Christ's presence in the Sacrament, might have been made up, when it first
appeared, I refer my self to the Testimony of Bucer, in whose Judgment, it
was rather an Appearance only of a Breach, then an Apparent Breach: If the
Lutherans Meaning had been as accurately examined, as their words, or manner of
expressing it were. But without diligent examination it was easy for others to
mistake their meaning, when as Peter Martyr, a man otherwise as moderate as
Learned, did lay those opinions to the Lutherans charge; which, as his dear
Friend Bucer (who tendered his seven years service for making a friendly
Comprimise in this Controversy) seriously protests, he never could perceive
that any Lutheran Minister did maintain. Nor did he write otherwise to Peter
Martyr, then out of diligent Examination of their own writings, and as in his
own Conscience he was persuaded: for he thus subscribes another Letter of the
same Purport, sent to the Italian Churches: Ita sentio, and in hac sententia
opto venire ad tribunal Domini. The ancient Lutherans, it seems, affected a
language of their own, or a Liberty to express their meditations concerning
the Dignity or Exaltation of Christ's Humane Nature after another manner, then
the Ancients had done, or many Modern Writers could well brook. And this
Liberty being denied them; especially by the Churches of Switzerland, they
sought in the issue, to draw or tenter their matter to that frame of speech,
which they had not so warily conceived; And so at length, the factious
industry of some German Court-Divines did hatch a Theological endless
quarrel, out of a Verbal and Grammatical Controversy. It fell out so in the
opposition of these German Princes and their Courts, as it does between the
Factions of rank good-Fellows and nice Precisians in Colleges or Corporations:
The one sort always provoking the other to be more Profane; and then taking
occasion by the increase of their profaneness to be more irregularly Precise.
Both parties being by their daily Bandyings far worse, then being sundred they
would have been: Whilst in the mean time true Religion, and sober Devotion
suffers on both hands betwixt them. Thus, upon the Lutherans Hyperbolical
manner of expressing the Exaltation of Christ's Manhood, the Helvetian Churches
took occasion to grant a less measure of Dignity then was fitting; and the
less They granted, the more the Lutherans still added to the advancement of
his Humanity, or the miraculous manner of his Bodily Presence in the
Sacrament; as if they had thought themselves bound in conscience to make a
Super-allowance for the others Arrears or detractions, as they at least
conceived. And thus the missed Truth often times lies betwixt disagreeing
Parties, as it were offering it self to be surveyed by unpartial bystanders,
or sorrowful Spectators of causeless ruful broyses betwixt brethren.

To add any Excellency to Christ's Divine Nature, by derogating from his
Humanity, we cannot: for being Infinite, It cannot admit of any addition. And
to derogate any thing from his Humanity, whereof it is, or (for ought we know)
may be Capable, from That Special Union, which it has with the Divine Nature,
we dare not. For this were to derogate from, or deny the Power of God. But does
he derogate any thing from Christ's Humane Nature, that denies it to be
Infinitely Exalted? It may be he does, that does deny the Exaltation of his
Humane Nature (since his Ascension, and Sitting at the Right Hand of God the
Father) to be in Any sort Infinite. The diverse acceptions of Infinity, or
diverse branches of it, to man's apprehension, are almost infinite; more by
many, then are fit to be displayed or mentioned in this place. It shall
therefore suffice, First, to show, In what Sense we must deny Christ's Humane
Nature, to be infinitely Exalted: And this must quash the Lavish Hyperboles of
some modern Lutherans. Secondly, In what Sense Christ's Humane Nature may be
said to be, or at least may not be denied to be infinitely Exalted.

4. Christ's Body may be conceived to be Absolutely Infinite, or to be Actually
Infinite only, but not absolutely; or to be Potentially Infinite only. To be
Absolutely Infinite, or to be Infinite Simply in Being, is proper to God, who
is Very Being it self: and as he has no Cause of Being, so he can have no
limits or bounds of Being, either for number of several sorts of Being, or for
degrees of several Perfections. What kind of Perfection soever we can conceive
to be in any created Substance, that we must acknowledge to be Infinitely
greater in him. Again, we may conceive an Actual Infinity of Being only in One
or Two Kinds; as in respect of Place, of Strength or Power. And though God be
not Infinite only in respect of these Two Branches of Being, yet he Only is
Actually Infinite according to these Two Branches of Infinity. The One we call
his Immensitie, the other his Omnipotency. No created substance can actually
be every where at once. No creature can be Omnipotent, or actually Infinite in
strength; for so it should be as strong as God, though not so wise or eternal
as God. Now upon these Two Branches of Divine Infinity, that is, upon his
Immensitie and Omnipotency, the modern Lutherans make the Humane Nature of
Christ, to incroach as a Real Participant, or equal sharer with the Divine
Nature or Blessed Trinity, if we may judge of their meaning by their words, or
of their intended Conclusions, by their Premises expressly avouched, and
stiffly maintained. After their Doctrine of Christ's Real presence in the
Sacrament by Consubstantiation, began to be impugned and shaken, the later
Lutherans sought to support it by A new Butteresse or pillar, which the
Ancienter did not rely upon in this Argument, and that was the Ubiquitie of
Christ's Body, or Humane Nature. Indeed if Christ's Body were everywhere
present, it should be Consubstantially present in the Sacrament; But so it
should be present in many other places, where Christ's Body is not every where.
none of the Ancients did ever imagine it to be, where no good Christian is
bound to seek it.

5. But to hunt out their Meaning, at least the Truth, concerning which, their
Meaning I hope is better then their Expression; When they say, Christ's
Glorified Body is Everywhere, they grant it to be in Heaven. They should then
in the First place tell us, whether, in heaven, it be not as visible and
conspicuous to Angels and Saints, as it shall be to all men at his coming to
Judgment? Secondly, Whether this Visibilitie of it, does not include a visible
or comprehensible Distinction of parts in it, as of his Head from his Feet, or
his Right Hand from his Left. This I presume they will not deny; for Christ
shall only visibly change the place of his Residence, not the substance, form,
or fashion of his Body, when he shall come from the Right Hand of God, to
Judge the quick and the dead. This being granted, when they say, Christ's Body
is every where, they should in the Third place tell us, Whether it be
Everywhere according to this Distinction of Parts or no. Si di Christi, If
that of Christ, which they hold (as somewhat of Christ besides his Divine
Nature, they hold) to be Every where, have no Distinction of parts: Let them
call it what they list, it is not in any Language (besides their own, and the
Modern Romish Churches) a Body; as having no Properties of a Body. If they
will be content to deny all Distinction of parts in That of Christ, which they
make to be the Subject of this Ubiquitarie presence, we shall be content to
take this their Real denial, for an approach to a Comprimise, or agreement. If
they will call that A Body, which we would call A Spiritual Influence, or a
Virtual presence, (so we may know what they really mean by this Word Body,)
let them enjoy their Dialect. If they admit a Distinction of Parts in that,
which they call Christ's Body, and which they make the Subject of this
Ubiquitarie presence, they should tell us, whether it be Every where present
according to every part? or whether it be Every where present according to all
its parts respectively? As whether the Hands of Christ be Every where, his
Heart Every where, his Head Every where? or whether there be no place in the
world wherein some Part of Christ's Body or Humane Nature is not; yet so, that
they will have his Head to be in one part, his Feet in another, his Right Hand
in a third, and his Left Hand in a fourth place or dimension of this visible
world. If they say, Christ's body is, in this Latter sort, present Every where,
they make him a Giant, not such a Man as we conceive him to be; they do not
Exalt, but rather Extend him according to his Humane Nature, the entire frame
of whose body no man shall see, no not at the day of Judgment; and yet (by
this Tenent) according to some parts of his Humane Nature, he shall be
Consubstantially present with the Damned in hell. If they say that Christ's
whole body is entirely Every where, or every part of it Every where, then
either he has no Right Hand, or his Right Hand is in his Left; either he has
no Humane Body, or else his whole Body is in his Little Finger. But to be
after this manner entirely Every where, is Proper only unto God.

6. It may be we shall hit their Meaning better by tracing their footsteps.
Thus then they proceed: The Right Hand of God is every where; Christ according
to his Humane Nature sits at the Right Hand of God. Ergo, A Lutheran
Syllogism.
Christ according to his Humane Nature sits every where; and if his Sear
according to his Humane Nature be every where, his Humane Nature is present
every where, for Session or Residence, according to his Humane Nature,
includes his Presence according to his Humane Nature. First, admitting the
Major [The Right Hand of God is every where] were absolutely true, according to
the literal meaning of this Article, they stand bound by the Rules of Logic to
rectify the Minor, and make it thus; [But Christ according to his Humane
Nature is the Right Hand of God] And if Christ according to his Humane Nature
be the Right Hand of God, then if the Right Hand of God be every where, it
would directly and perpendicularly follow, that Christ is every where according
to his Humane Nature. But, this (i. e. the words of the minor) they will not
say; Now the minor not being thus rectified, the Conclusion must be corrected,
and, in stead of saying [Christs Humanity is every where,] it must be taught
to say, [That Christ's Humanity, or Christ according to his Humane Nature,
Sits at that, or by that, which is every where.] Secondly, If we take that
Definition, which some good Divines make of Christ's Sitting at the Right Hand
of God the Father, that is [to be a person equal to the Father, by whom the
Father does immediately rule the world, but the Church especially;] the
Inference will be a Fallacy a rebus ad voces. The Connection between the Terms,
howsoever placed, will be no better, then if a man should nail a piece of
solid timber at the one end to the Air, and at the other end to the Water.
Lastly, If by the Right Hand of God in this place be Literally meant, A visible
or comprehensible Throne, wherein the God head is after the like (but a far
more glorious) manner conspicuously present, as it was in the Ark of the
Covenant here on earth: then the Major proposition, on which the whole
structure of Christ's Ubiquitie according to his Manhood depends, will be a
great deal too narrow; for, the Right Hand of God the Father Almighty, taken in
this Sense, is not every where. That Glory of God at whose Right Hand Saint
Steven saw Christ standing, was not on earth, but in heaven; nor in every place
of heaven, but in that place only, where he saw the heavens to open, and on
which he fixed his eyes.

7. But they further add, That Christ's Humane Nature is glorified with that
Glory, which he had with the Father before the world was made. Now A Lutheran
Objection, that proves, aut nihil, aut nimium*
that Glory doubtless was no created Glory, but Glory uncreated; and if
uncreated, then questionless Infinite; and if this Glory wherewith his Humane
Nature is glorified, be Infinite, then his Humane Nature is infinitely Exalted,
or exalted to a Real communication of all the Divine Attributes, as to be every
where, to be Omnipotent. etc. To This some answer; Christ's Divine Nature or
Person, may in that place, John 17. ver. 5. be said to be Glorified after the
same manner that it was Exalted. But, though it be true, that Christ meant the
Glorification of his Divine Person in that place, yet this no way contadicts
the Glorification of his Humane Nature, but rather supposes it. For his Divine
Person was glorified by the glorification of his Humane Nature; that is, The
world should not have known the Glory of the Son of God, or of him as their
Lord and Redeemer, unless this Glory had appeared in his Manhood or Humane
Nature. Now if the Humane Nature were glorified with that Glory, which was
before the world, it was glorified with an uncreated Glory: And uncreated
Glory, is Absolutely Infinite. If this consequence were sound, the First
Branch of it would be This, That Christ's Humane Nature was glorified with
Infinite glory before the foundation of the world; and so the conclusion
should contradict the Article of Christ's Incarnation in time, as also the whole
course of his Humiliation here on earth. The same Arguments which they bring to
prove the Glory of his Humane Nature to be Infinite in respect of place or
power, will prove his Humane Nature to have been Infinite and glorious in
respect of its Duration; or Christ as man to be Coeternal with God the Father,
or else they prove just nothing at all. That Real communication of the Divine
Attributes, which they so eagerly contend for, is but a dream or Fancy, which
could not possibly have come into their brains, but either for want of Logic,
or of Consideration. The root of their Error is, that they distinguish not
between the uncreated Glory, (which is the Incomprehensible Fountain, by
participation whereof Christ's Humane Nature is immediately Glorified) and the
Participation or Communication of it. The Glory of the Godhead, which
dwells Bodily in Christ, is Infinite. But it is not Communicated to Christ's
Humane Nature according to its infinity; The Communication of it, or the
Glory communicated is Created, and therefore finite. The Sun truly and Really
Communicates his light unto the Moon, and we properly say, That the Moon is
enlightened or made glorious by the light of the Sun; yet will it not hence
follow, That the Light Communicated or imparted to the Moon, is equal to the
light of the Sun, which does communicate it or impart it: Much less will it
follow, that the Glory wherewith Christ's Humane Nature is glorified, should be
equal to that Glory of the Godhead, which does communicate or impart Glory
unto it; or from which, all the Glory, which it has above other Creatures, is
derived. To conclude this Point; The best Frame, whereunto the Lutherans
Arguments in this Controversy can be drawn, is this; The glory of God is
infinite.; Christ as Man is glorified by the glory of God: Ergo, His glory as
Man is infinite; Yet the connection is not as good as this following. The light
of the Sun does by his presence make the day, but the Moon is enlightened by the
light of the Sun: Ergo, The Moon by presence of its light makes the day. Sooner
shall the Lutheran turn night into day, by this or the like Sophism, then prove
that Real communication of the Divine Attributes to Christ's Humane Nature,
which he dreams of; As, that Christ as man should be Really present every
where, or Omnipotent; because the glory of God wherewith he is glorified, is
every where; or because the Power or Right Hand, by which he is strengthened, is
a Power Omnipotent, Omnipotency it self. Thus much of that Absolute Infinity,
or Infinity in Act, unto which Christ's Humane Nature was not Exalted; and yet
it was Exalted in some sort Infinitely above all other created substances: and
so Exalted, or at least declared to be so Exalted, specially, by the Ascension
of it into heaven; and by its Sitting at the Righthand of God the Father.

8. That is Infinitum actu, or actually Infinite, Extra quod nihil est; which
is so perfect and complete, that nothing in the same kind can be added unto it:
That is Infinitum potentia, or potentially Infinite, unto which somewhat may
successively be added without end or ceasing. Thus Philosophers have taught;
that, In continua quantitate non datur minimum; in discreta, non datur maximum.
There is not the least quantity, but is divisible into infinite parts. There
is no member so great, but may still be made greater by Addition; and albeit
Addition were made every moment unto the worlds end, yet the Product could not
be actually infinite; some number might be added unto it, which as yet is not
contained in it. In this manner the participated Power or Glory of God, or the
participation of this Power or Glory may be infinite. The participation of
this Power or Being, may every moment, whilst the world lasts, or whilst
immortal creatures continue in being, be greater then other, and yet never
come to be so great, but that it may be augmented or bettered; and that, which
may be augmented or bettered, cannot be actually Infinite. The least parcel of
earth could not subsist without the participation of Gods Power or Being, and
the least or dullest part of the earth, which participates of his Being, does
in a sort infinitely exceed Nothing, or that which is not. Nothing could have
any Being, but by participating of his Being, who is infinite. No power besides
Infinite Power could out of Nothing produce Something. Trees, and plants, and
other works of the 4th and 5th days creation excel the earth; Beasts of the
field excel them; Man excels the beasts of the field, and the Angels excel
man in nobility and dignity of being; And yet the most excellent amongst the
Angels is but a participation of Gods Power or Excellency; and as Divines
collect, God has not made any creature so excellent, but he may make it more
excellent every day then other; yet (this supposed) should not the Excellency
of it be Actually infinite, because it may be still bettered; Yet may that,
which is not actually infinite in any one kind, or according to any one branch
of Infinity, actually contein greater Excellency or perfection in it, then
the addition of perfection unto some other creature, though by succession
infinite, can attain unto. And thus Christ's Humane Nature, by reason of the
Personal Union which it has with the Godhead, or with the Son of God,
contains greater Excellency in it of diverse kinds, then any other created
substance not so united, though the faculties or perfections of it were
continually bettered, could reach unto.

9. But, omitting the Dignity of Christ's humane Nature in the general, it will
be a more profitable search to examine the particular Effects or Efficacy which
his Humane Nature, now Exalted, has in respect of us. These may not be
measured, much less limited, by other men's most noble Faculties or
perfections. The most dull sight on earth may see as far as the Sun or Stars;
and the most quick sight cannot see beyond them. No man's eyesight can pierce
through the thickest clouds, much less through the heavens above, or through
the rocks here on earth. Though thus to do, were absolurely impossible to man,
or any other creature endued with sight; we might not hence thus collect,
Christ's glorified eyes are humane eyes, See Chap. 11.. 11.
as ours are; created eyes as ours are, Therefore He cannot with these bodily
eyes look down from heaven, and behold what is done, or lies hid in the most
secret corners of the earth; or that his faculty of hearing, because a created
faculty, cannot apprehend all the blasphemies, or oaths, even the most secret
murmurings of his enemies either against him, or his Church. Or, admitting any
Saints eyes, already glorified in body in heaven, could, by vision of the
Divine Nature, see all things that are done in earth; or that his ears could
hear all the Conference that passes in this Kingdom for some one day: yet this
excellency of his outward senses being supposed, his internal or intellective
faculties were not able to distinguish betwixt every thing so heard or seen, or
to censure every word or deed as it deserves. Nor could his memory perhaps
perfectly retain what for the present the apprehends or conceives. Yet may we
not hence argue, Christ's intellective Faculties are but Humane, (not divine)
Ergo, he cannot distinctly and infallibly Judge or censure every thing he sees
or hears, or infallibly retain the Records of his Judgment or censure
inviolate and entire unto the day of Judgment. Bound we are rather to believe,
that Christ as Man, or with his Humane eyes, sees all our wrongs, and as Man
hears all our prayers, and takes notice of all our doings; Or that he, who as
Man shall be our Judge, is in the mean time an Eyewitness of all our
misdeedes or well doings, an Eare-witness of all our speeches good or bad. Nor
may we again, by broken Inductions, gathered from the effects or efficacy of
natural bodies; or created substances upon other bodies, take upon us to limit
or bound the Efficacy of Christ's Body upon the bodies or souls, which he
has taken to his protection. We may not collect, that Christ's body, because
comprehended within the heavens, can exercise no real Operation upon our
bodies or souls here on earth; or that the live Influence of his glorified
Human Nature may not be diffused through the world, as he shall be pleased to
dispense it, or to sow the seeds of life issuing from it, sometimes here,
sometimes there.

10. This Real though Virtual Influence of Christ's Humane Nature is happily See
Book 10. Chap. 55. and 56.
that, which the Lutherans call the Real Ubiquitarie presence of Christ Body.
Luther himself never denied Christ's very body or Humane Nature, to be
comprehended within the heavens; and yet he affirmed it to be present with us
in such a manner, as the sound is present with us, which is really made or
caused a great way from us. And we may not deny This Real Influence or Virtual
Presence of Christ to be in a manner Infinite; or at least to extend it self to
all created substances, that are capable of it, in what created distance soever
they be from his body; whose Residence we believe to be in the highest
heavens, at the Right hand of God. This kind of Infinity of his Presence can
seem no Paradox or improbable Imagination to any good Christian, that will but
raise his thoughts above the earth by this or the like Experiment of nature.
Albeit this bodily Sun, which we daily see, were much further distant from the
earth, then now it is, yet could we easily conceive it to be of force and
efficacy enough to enlighten the earth, whereon we dwell, and those celestial
Spheres, which are, or might be, as far above it, as it is above the Center.
And in the greatest distance we can imagine it is, or might be, distant from the
earth; it would give life and vigor to things vegetable, or capable of vital
heat. It were a silly Argument to infer, that because the hottest fire on
earth, cannot impart his heat to bodies 10 miles distant from it, therefore the
Sun cannot communicate vital heat and Comfort to vegetables more then
ten-hundred-thousand miles distant from it: This Inference notwithstanding is
not so foolish in Philosophy, as This following is in Divinity. The Sun
cannot quicken trees or herbs, which have lost their root and sap; Ergo the Sun
of righteousness, or Christ's Humane Nature, in which the Godhead dwells
Bodily, cannot quicken the dead, or raise up our mortal bodies to immortality.
The only sure Anchor of all our hopes for a joyful Resurrection unto the life
of Glory, is the Mystical Union, which must be wrought here on earth, betwixt
Christ's Humane Nature glorified, and our mortal or dissoluble nature. The
Divine Nature indeed is the Prime Fountain of Life to all, but, though
inexhaustible in it self, yet a fountain whereof we cannot drink, save as it is
derived unto us through the Humane Nature of Christ.

11. Although it be most true which Tertullian (in the 17 Chapter of his
Apology) has observed, That even those Heathens, which adored Jupiter
Capitolinus, and multiplied their Gods according to the number of the places
wherein they worshipped them, when they were thoroughly stung with any grievous
affliction or calamity, were wont to lift up their eyes and hands, not to the
Roman Capitol, but to heaven it self; as knowing that, by instinct of nature,
to be the seat or throne of Divine Majesty, And the Hill from whence came
their help: Yet (notwithstanding the truth of this Observation, and the
profitable use, which that Father there makes of it) it was an extraordinary
Favor of God unto the Israelites, that they were permitted and instructed to
worship God in his Sanctuary, and to present their devotions toward the Ark
of the Covenant, or the Mercy-seat, before which they might adore him in such
manner and sort, as they might not in any other place, or before any other
creature. They knew, much better then the heathen, that Gods Throne of Majesty
was in heaven, and yet were to tender their devotions unto him as
extraordinarily present in his Temple or Sanctuary here on earth. For as our
bodily sight does scatter or dazzle, without some sensible Object to gather and
terminate it; So our cogitations, though of heaven and heavenly things, do
float or vanish without some determinate and comprehensible Object, whereon to
fasten them. Now, albeit the Temple of Jerusalem, wherein Gods People only were
to worship, were long since demolished; yet the Sanctuary, wherein they were
to worship God, is rather translated or advanced from earth to heaven, then
destroyed; For it was Gods Presence, that made the Temple; and That is more
extraordinary in Christ's Body (which the Jews destroyed, but which he raised
again in three days) then ever it had been in Solomon's Temple; in the Glory
of whose goodly structure and manifestation of Gods Glory in it, the true
Israelites did much rejoice, and the later Jews too much boast and glory. But
this Prerogative we have in respect of the ancientest and truest Israelites,
that, since the vail of the Temple was rent, we may at all times (reflecting
upon that model the Scripture has imprinted in our minds) look within the
vail, and behold the Ark or Mercy-seat; and use the most holy Sanctuary, or
inner place made with hands, as a Perspective Glass or instrument for
surveying the heavenly Sanctuary, which God has pitched and not man. This
hope have we (says St Paul, Heb. 6. 19.) as an anchor of the soul both sure
and steadfast, and which enters into that within the vail, whither the
forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus made an high Priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedek. He is gone before us into the Sanctuary to make
perpetual intercession, who before had made an everlasting atonement for us
here on earth. He is now become to us the Temple of God, the Ark of the
Covenant, the Propitiatory, or Mercie-seat, the fulfilling of all things: and
unto him, now placed in his Sanctuary at the Righthand of God, we are not only
to direct our Cogitations or devotions, but to transmit our affections to the
Divine Nature by him. The Son of God after he had suffered in Our flesh (and
made a full sufficient satisfaction for all our sins) did in our nature rise
again, did in our nature ascend into heaven, and in our nature sits at the
Right Hand of God, not only to gather our scatered contemplations and broken
notions of the Godhead, but withal to draw and unite our affections unto him,
which otherwise would flagg, droop, or miscarry, if we should direct them to
heaven at large, or to the incomprehensible Majesty of the Godhead, without a
known Advocate or Intercessor to present them, and to return their effects or
issues. Hence says our Apostle Colos. 3. 1. If ye be risen with Christ, that
is, if you sted fastly believe that Christ, who was the Son of God (and as
incomprehensible for his Divine Nature as God the Father, to whom he was equal)
did dye in your flesh and comprehensible nature, and in the same nature did
rise again from the dead, then seek those things, which are above; where
Christ sits at the Right Hand of God: Set, (or settle, or fasten) your
affections on things above, not on things on the earth. And as we are to settle
our dearest affections on him, so are we to direct our prayers unto him in his
heavenly Sanctuary.

12. That we may direct our prayers unto the Blessed Trinity according to the
Rule of Faith (which is the first Degree of praying in Faith) take, for the
present, these short Directions. The First and Fundamental Object of Belief, as
Christian, is the acknowledgement of the Blessed Trinity. And by this Belief
we acknowledge such a Distinction of Persons, or Parties, between God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost: that God the Father does
Personally, and in propriety of Person, exact Satisfaction for all the
offenses committed against the Godhead or Blessed Trinity: and that the Son
of God does by like Personal Propriety, undertake to make Satisfaction and
Reconciliation for us. He it is that does avert the wrath of God from us, and
inhibit the proceedings of Divine Justice against us. We are then in the First
place either expressly or implicitly to direct our prayers to God the Father,
that he would be pleased to forgive us our sins, to be reconciled unto us, and
bestow such blessings upon us, as he has promised to such as shall be
reconciled unto him. In the Second place, either expressly or implicitly, we
are to beseech him to forgive us our sins, to be reconciled and bless us for
the merits of his only Son, who has made satisfaction for us. This is a Point,
which every Christian is bound expressly to believe, that God the Father, does
neither forgive sins, nor vouchsafe any Term or Plea of Reconciliation, but
only for the merits and satisfaction made by the sacrifice of the Son of God,
who by the eternal spirit offered himself in our humane nature upon the Cross.
In the next place, we are to believe and acknowledge, that as God the Father
does neither forgive, nor vouchsafe Reconciliation, but for the merits and
satisfaction of his only Son; so neither will he vouchsafe to conveigh this, or
any other blessing unto us, which his Son has purchased for us, but only
through his Son; not only through him as our Advocate or Intercessor, but
through him as our Mediator, that is, through His humanity, as the Organ or
Conduit, or as the only Bond, by which we are united and reconciled unto the
Divine Nature. For although the Holy Spirit or Third Person in Trinity, does
immediately and by Personal Propriety, work faith and other spiritual Graces
in our Souls, yet does he not by these Spiritual Graces unite our souls or
Spirits immediately unto himself, but unto Christ's Humane Nature. He does as it
were till the ground of our hearts, and make it fit to receive the seed of
life; But this seed of righteousness immediately flows from the Sun of
Righteousness, whose sweet influence likewise it is, which does immediately
season, cherish, and ripen it. The Spirit of life, whereby our Adoption and
Election is sealed unto us, is the real participation of Christ's Body, which
was broken, and of Christ's Blood, which was shed for us. This is the true and
punctual meaning of our Apostles speech, 1 Cor. 15. 45. The first man Adam was
made a living soul, or, as the Syriack has it, Animale Corpus, an enlivened
body; but the second Adam was made a quickening spirit; and immediately
becomes such to all those, which as truly bear his image by the Spirit of
Regeneration, which issues from him, as they have born the Image of the first
Adam by natural propagation. And this again is the true and punctual meaning of
our Saviors words, John. 6. 63. It is the Spirit that quickneth, the flesh
profits nothing; the words that I speak unto you are spirit and life. For so
he had said in the verses before, to such as were offended at his words, what
if you should see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? The Implication
contained in the Connection between these two verses, and the precedent is this;
That Christ's Virtual presence, or the influence of life, which his Humane
Nature was to distill from his heavenly Throne, should be more profitable to
such as were capable of it, then his Bodily presence; then the bodily Eating of
his flesh and blood, could be, although it had been convertible into their
bodily substance. This distillation of life and immortality from his glorified
Humane Nature, is that, which the Ancient and Orthodoxal Church did mean in
their Figurative and lofty speeches of Christ's Real presence, or of eating His
very Flesh, and drinking His very Blood in the Sacrament. And the Sacramental
Bread is called His Body, and the Sacramental Wine His Blood; as for other
reasons, so especially for This, that the virtue or influence of his Bloody
Sacrifice, is most plentifully, and most effectually distilled from heaven unto
the worthy Receivers of the Eucharist. And unto this Point and no further will
most of the Testimonies reach, which Bellarmin in his books of the Sacraments,
or Maldonat in his Comments upon the sixth of Saint John, do quote out of the
Fathers for Christ's Real Presence by Transubstantiation; or which Chemnitius,
that Learned Lutheran, in his Books, De duabus in Christo naturis, and de
Fundamentis sanae doctrinae, does avouch for Consubstantiation. And if thus
much had been as distinctly granted to the Ancient Lutherans, as Calvin in some
places does, the controversy between the Lutheran and other Reformed Churches,
had Besides what may be found in Cyrill of Alex. See Cyrill Hierosol. in
Cateches. Mystag. 1, 3, 4.
been at an end when it first begun; Both Parties acknowledging Saint Cyrill to
be the fittest Umpire in this Controversy.

The end of the Third Chapter.
A Transition of the Publisher's.
IT must not be dissembled, that I had no Intimation, much less Commission, of
the Author's, to Insert the Two following Chapters, herein this place. Yet,
besides, that I knew not of any fitter place where to dispose of them, I had
these Reasons so to do.

1. I held it fit, that His Powerful Disputes against the Church of Rome, about
The Lords Supper in the fourth Chapter, and about another Point in the fifth,
should immediately follow his Learned Argument with the Lutheran.

2. The sequence seems very Methodical, The Subject of the first Chapter,
being, partly, About Christ's Exaltation, by becoming The Chief Cornerstone
(cut out of the Rock or quarrey by his Resurrection from The New Scpulchre,
lifted up by his Ascension; and placed at the Chief Corner by his Sitting at
Gods Right Hand;) and partly, about The Union of Christ with true Christians;
which Union, is, both a Considerable part of the fourth Chapter, and was
happily touched upon in the Close of the Third.

3. In case any Restive soul, should; perhaps some faint Dejected Spirit having
read Christ's Great Exaltation, may say, Who shall ascend into Heaven? that is,
to bring Christ down from above. Such an one, besides the quickenings he may
hear from other Remembrancers (Saint Peter telling us, that we are pilgrims
here; and Saint Paul, that we seek a Country, and look for a City, Jerusalem
that is Free; and that being Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of Gods
hous-hold, our Conversation or Traffic is to be in heaven, for those things
which are above, where Christ sits at Gods Right Hand, etc.) may receive
mighty encouragement by Experimenting the Contents of these two next Chapters,
The avowed near approach and Intimacie of our Lord Jesus Christ, with the
Believing and Receiving Christian. The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
and in thy heart. When the holy Sacramental pledges be in the mouth, and Faith
in the heart, The Word, the Eternal Word that was made flesh, is nigh indeed.
For, Verily, Verily -- He that eats my Fesh, and drinks my Blood, dwells
in Me, and I in Him.

1. SEeing these words contain the Grand Mystery of godliness, not only of God
manifested in the Flesh, but of God still with us, yea dwelling in us; and
seeing they are withal the Conclusion or Center of our Saviors long dispute
with the murmuring Jews: It will be necessary to unfold the chief Contents of
this Chapter. At the tenth verse you may read, how our Savior had satisfied
five thousand hungry souls, with five barley loves and two fishes; and filled
twelve baskets with the fragments: upon the Experience of this strange wonder,
this great multitude sought to make him their King. A good Project, I must
confess, if we value it only by the usual measure, or aim of popular
Elections. What people would not be willing to have such an one for their King,
as were able to feed a whole Army without Contribution, Tax or Toll from them;
without any further toil, and care, either on their part or his, then giving of
thanks, and distribution of extemporarie provision by his Ministers? But
besides this politic motive, they had a Prenotion, that their expected Messiah
or King, should enter upon his Kingdom at the Feast of the Passover, a little
before which time, this Miracle was wrought. And it was a received Opinion (as
Hist. lib. 5. So. Suetonius in Vespas.
Tacitus tells us) that there should a great King, about this time arise in
Judah. Nor did this people err much in the circumstance of time, wherein their
Messiah should be enthroned in the Kingdom of David, for so he was, at, or soon
after, the Passover following. But they utterly mistook the nature of his Viz.
At his Resurrection, and Ascension. See Book 9. Chap. 39.
Kingdom, and the manner of his Reign. Yet in that they sought to make this man
(for so, and no more then so, they conceived him to be) their King, it is more
then probable that they took him for their expected Messiah. And indeed upon
sight of the Miracle which he had wrought, they expressly confess so much,
ver. 14. This is of a truth, That Prophet which should come into the world.
But, seeing neither his Kingdom was of this world, nor was he to be instated
in it by the voices and suffrages of men; he who knew all times and seasons,
knew this was not the time of his Coronation, and therefore when he perceived
that they would come and take him by force to make him a King, he departed
again into a mountain himself alone, ver. 15. And his Disciples, being for the
present discharged of their attendance, crossed the sea without him to Capernaum,
which was the place of his and their abode, ver. 16, 17. The people which had
been more then eyewitnesses of the former miracle, having observed that he
could not come to Capernaum, where the next day they found him, by ship or
boat, demand of him, ver. 25. Rabbi, when came thou hither? The strange
manner of his coming thither before them, did (it seems) no less affect them,
then the former miracle, though neither did affect them as was fitting: for so
our Savior plainly tells them, ver. 26. Verily verily, I say unto you, ye seek
me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and
were filled. These were the same men which saw the miracle; but, in seeing it
they did not see it, that is, they did not in heart consider, that he had fed
their bodies with corporal bread, to no other end, save only to stir up the
appetite of their souls after celestial food. So our Savior testifies unto
them, ver. 27. Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which
endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you, for him
has God the Father sealed; that is, he was to be a King of Gods appointing,
not of theirs.

2. Now albeit the former miracle of five loaves, and two fishes, had extorted
that confession from them, before mentioned, Of a truth this is that Prophet
which should come into the world; yet this reproof of our Savior's, provokes
them to question the validity of their former verdict: for they demand a
further sign of him, before they will acknowledge that he was indeed the Great
Prophet, or one, whom they might believe was sent from God; for so they say,
ver. 30, 31. What sign show thou then that we may see and believe thee? What
do thou work? our Fathers did eat Manna in the desert, as it is written, he
gave them bread from heaven to eat. The question at last comes to this issue,
Whether the Manna which their Fathers did eat in the wilderness, were the
true bread of life, or bread from heaven, better then which they were not to
expect. Our Savior maintains the negative, ver. 32, 33. Verily, Verily, I say
unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father gives you
the true bread from heaven: For See St. Cyrill Alex. in his G^aphyr. on Exodus.
the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the
world. All this they can well brook, in Thesi, or General, for so they reply,
ver. 34. Lord evermore give us this bread. But when our Savior comes from the
Thesis to the Hypothesis, or from the general Doctrine which they so well
approved, to make this particular Application, I am the bread of life; he that
comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me, shall never
thirst, ver. 35. They leave their questioning, and fall to murmuring, taking a
sudden occasion, or strange hint of offense at his person or Of the
inconstancy of Vulgar affections. See Book 10. Ch, 23. f. 3073
Parentage. Whereas before they were forward to make him their King, they now
reply, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?
How is it then that he says, I came down from heaven? verse. 42.

3. Thus, their fathers had murmured against Moses and Aaron in the
wilderness, one while for want of bread, Exodus 16. 2. accounting their estate
in Egypt much better than their present condition in the wilderness. Another
while they murmur for water, Exodus 15. 24. And again Exodus 17. 3. Wherefore is
this that thou have brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our Children, and
Cattle with thirst? Thus they murmured against Moses, whom they had seen to
work so mighty wonders. And thus their foolish posterity murmured against
Him, whom (for the former miracle) they had acknowledged, the great Prophet
whom God had promised to raise up unto them like unto Moses in all things, and
therefore like unto him in this, in that he endured their murmurings against
him with greater patience and meekness, than Moses did; albeit they had no
such occasion of murmuring as their forefathers had. For their Fathers murmured
in their hunger or thirst, whereas this great Prophet, had prevented this
occasion of murmuring, by feeding them plenteously before they had sought to
him for food. That which Moses says unto the murmuring Israelites, Exodus 16.
8. was now exactly fullfilled; The Lord (says he) hears your murmurings
which you murmur against him; and what are we? Your murmurings are not against
us, but against the Lord. These Jews murmur against the son (as they suppose)
of Joseph, and Mary; less weening that in murmuring against him they did
personally murmur against the Son of God, then their Fathers did, when they
murmured against Moses, that they had murmured against their God. But the same
Lord which heard their murmurings then by the mediate presence or infinite
knowledge of his God head, hears them now with the ears of man, as
immediately and as sensibly, as Moses heard their Fathers murmur. Now, as God
in the wilderness, though he heard their Fathers murmurings, did yet grant
them their desire; [at evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall
be filled with bread, and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God. Exodus 16.
12] So the same Lord now, albeit this foolish people murmur against him to his
face, (not for denying, but for proffering them the true food of life) is so
far from chiding them as Moses did, that he presses them, to make try all of
his bounty, and to accept his proffer, with greater vehemence of words, yet
with more meekness of language, than Moses did at any time use. Murmur not
(says he) amongst your selves, ver. 43. etc. I am that bread of life; your
fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness and are dead. This is the bread which
comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not dye. I am the
living bread that came down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread, he
shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will
give for the life of the world. 48, 49, 50, 51. And here again they increase
their murmuring, for they strove among themselves saying, how can this man give
us his flesh to eat? v. 52. Thus, as their Fathers tempted God in their hearts
by asking meat for their Lust, Ps. 78. 18. so have their posterity. They
fought him out, that they might have their bellyes filled with corporal bread,
and yet when he had given them this in great abundance, by means miraculous,
they will not believe that he is able to give them what he promises, bread
from heaven, or his flesh to eat (which is the bread or staff of life.) So
incredulous their Fathers had been, that after the sight of many miracles in
Egypt, they would not trust him in the wilderness; after the experience of one
miracle in the wildern esse, they would not trust him for a second. They Spoke
against God, they said, can God furnish a table in the wilderness? Behold he
smote the Rock, that the waters gushed out and the streams over-flowed, but
can he give bread also, can he provide flesh for his people? therefore the Lord
heard this, and was wroth; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger came
up against Israel because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
salvation; But now this Salvation of God, even God himself made their Jesus, or
Salvation (for all is one) is come nearer unto this later people: and yet they
will not believe him, they will not trust in him. Yet his anger is not
presently kindled against them for not beleiving: The more they doubt, the more
they question, the more they murmur or strive; the more he presses the
necessity of eating his flesh, upon them, first Negatively, verily, verily: I
say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood,
ye have no life in you: then Affirmatively, Who so eats my flesh and
drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
verse. 53, 54. And lastly, he gives the reason, as well of the negative as of
the affirmative, For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,
verse. 55. So that in him, these Jews were to expect the fullness of the body
of all those contentments for whose shadows their Fathers so greedily longed
in the wilderness, and for want of which, they so murmured against Moses, as
these men now do against the Lord, which appeared to Moses, for giving them
assurance of them.

4. In what sense Christ's flesh is said to be truly meat, and his blood to be
truly drink, I have showed elsewhere. The sum was this. His flesh is meat
indeed, his blood is drink indeed, non Formaliter sed Eminenter; meat indeed
and drink indeed, not in respect of the natural qualities of corporal meat and
drink, for these must be swallowed, concocted, digested, and finally converted
into our bodily substance. That Christ's flesh according to these qualities, is
truly meat, or his blood truly drink, the Romish Church does not avouch. For
if his body should be concocted, or digested, or converted into our bodily
substance, it should suffer corruption. And to be swallowed only and not
concocted, is no property of meat or drink. Christ's Flesh then is said truly
meat, and his blood drink indeed, in respect of the End whereto all manner of
food is destinated. The best End of all bodily food, is to preserve or continue
bodily life. And that is the best food or diet, which most effectually
procures this End. Howbeit bodily life cannot be first given or implanted by
the best bodily meat that is, but only continuated or preserved: But Christ's
Flesh was given not only to continue life, but to give life unto the world: it
is the root of life, as well as the food of life; If we John. 6. 32, 33, 41,
48, 50. etc. 1. Cor. 15. 45.
speak of life spiritual or Everlasting, which only is life indeed. And in as
much as his flesh and blood are the roots and fountains of this kind of life,
the one is most truly said to be meat indeed, the other most truly, drink
indeed. That is, meat and drink more effectual and more necessary for the
attainement of everlasting life, than bodily food is for life temporal. Again,
Temporal or bodily life cannot be continued or preserved otherwise than by the
corruption or destruction of the bodily meat which preserves it. But Christ's
flesh and blood preserve life spiritual, or our souls and bodies unto
everlasting life, because they are incorruptible and cannot be changed, be not
so So the Church Leiturgie, in the words of ministration.
much as subject to alteration. Now if all other meat besides this, must suffer
corruption and lose its nature before it can become a cause or means of
preserving bodily life; Such meat cannot be truly said to remain in us; much
less can we be said to remain or abide in it. But of Christ's flesh and blood,
he himself here says it; He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood
dwells in me and I in him: and for this reason his flesh is meat indeed, and
his blood is drink indeed, the only meat and the only drink which men should
hunger and thirst after. Other meats and drinks should be sought for, yea life
bodily it self should be desired, only to this End, that by the prolonging of
it, we might be partakers in greater measure of this meat and drink, which
preserves the Body and soul unto everlasting life.

5. The Questions then to be discussed are Two.

First, What it is to eat Christ's flesh, and drink his Blood?

Secondly, What it is for Christ to Dwell, or abide, in us; and us to dwell, or
abide, in Him?

All agree that there is A Twofold eating of Christ's Body, and A Twofold
drinking of his Blood. One merely Sacramental, and another, Spiritual. Which
agreement notwithstanding, There arises, A Third Question; viz. What manner of
eating Christ's Flesh and drinking his Blood, is, in this place, Three Questions.
either only or principally meant.

For the Resolution of this Question we are briefly to explicate each member of
this Division, viz. 1. What it is to eat Christ's Body and drink his Blood
Sacramentally only. 2. What it is to eat his Body and Drink his Blood
Spiritually.

First then; All that are partakers of this Sacrament, eat Christ's Body, and
Drink his Blood sacramentally: that is, they eat that Bread which Sacramentally
is his Body, and drink that Cup which Sacramentally is his Blood, whether they
eat or drink faithfully or unfaithfully. For, All the Israelites 1 Cor. 10.
Drank of the same Spiritual Rock, which was Christ Sacramentally: All of them
were partakers of his presence, when Moses smote the Rock. Yet, with many of
them, God was not well pleased, because they did not faithfully either Drink or
participate of his presence. And more displeased he is with such as eat Christ's
Body and Drink his blood unworthily, though they eat and drink them
Sacramentally: For eating and drinking so only, that is, without faith, or due
respect, they eat and drink to their own Condemnation, because they do not
Discern, or rightly esteem Christ's Body or presence in the H. Sacrament.

May we say then, that Christ is Really present in the Sacrament, as well to
the unworthy as to the faithful receivers? Yes, this we must grant: yet must we
add withal, that he is really present with them in a quite contrary manner;
really present he is, because virtually present to both; because the operation
or efficacy of his Body and blood is not metaphorical, but real in both. Thus
the bodily Sun, though locally distant for its substance, is really See Book
10. f. 3298, and 3304.
present by its heat and light, as well to sore eyes, as to clear sights, but
really present to both, by a contrary real operation; and by the like contrary
operation, it is really present to clay, and to wax, it really hardneth the
one, and really softeneth the other. So does Christ's Body and Blood, by its
invisible, but real influence, mollify the hearts of such as come to the
Sacrament with due preparation; but harden such as unworthily receive the
consecrated Elements. If he that will hear the word, must take heed how he
hears, much more must he which means to receive the Sacrament of Christ's body
and blood, be careful how he receives. He that will present himself at this
great Marriage Feast of the Lamb without a wedding garment, had better be
absent. It was always safer, not to approach the presence of God manifested or
exhibited in extraordinary manner, (as in his Sanctuary or in the Ark) then
to make appearance before it in an unhallowed manner, or without due
preparation. Now when we say, that Christ is really present in the Sacrament,
our meaning is, that as God, he is present in an extraordinary manner, after
such a manner, as he was present (before his incarnation) in his Sanctuary, in
the Ark of his Covenant; and by the Power of his Godhead thus extraordinarily
present, he diffuseth the virtue or operation of his Humane Nature, either to
the vivification or hardening of their hearts, who receive the Sacramental
Pledges. So then, a man by eating Christ's body merely Sacramentally may be
hardened, may be excluded from his gracious presence. But no man has Christ
dwelling in him, by this Eating and Drinking merely Sacramental, not meant in
St. John 6. 56.
manner of eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, unless withal he eat the
one, and drink the other Spiritually. The Eating then of Christ's body, and
drinking his blood, merely Sacramentally, is not the eating and drinking here
meant.

6. They are said to eat Christ's Flesh and drink his Blood Spiritually, which
rightly apprehend his Death and Passion; which by Faith meditate and ruminate
upon them, making application to themselves as well of the great danger, which
may ensue upon the neglect of such great benefits as he has purchased for
them: as of the inestimable good, which always accompanies the right esteem,
or contemplation of his Body, which was given for them, and of his Blood which
was shed for them. He which thus eats Christ's Flesh and drinks his Blood by
Faith, although he do not (for the time present) eat his Body, or drink his
blood Sacramentally, has a true interest in this promise, [He that eats my
Flesh, and drinks my Blood, dwells in me, and I in him,] so he do not
neglect to eat his Body and drink his Blood Sacramentally, when occasion
requires and opportunity serves. So that Spiritual eating and drinking Christ
by Faith, is the true preparative for the worthy receiving of his body and
blood Sacramentally. He that does not so prepare himself for the receiving of
his body and blood, does receive him unworthily whilst he receives him
Sacramentally. The main Question is, Whether Christ's words be to be understood
at all of Sacramental eating and drinking, The 3d. or main Question;
or of Spiritual eating and drinking only.

7. Many there were, and yet are in Reformed Churches, which deny this place to
be meant of Sacramental Eating. But, as Beza (amongst others) Beza's
Observation.
well observes, they which deny this place to be meant at all of Sacramental
eating, err no less then they do, which restrain it only to Sacramental
eating. Their error (which deny it to be meant at all of Sacramental eating) is
so much the worse, because it gave advantage to our Adversaries of the Romish
Church, which want no wit to work upon all advantages given. To omit others,
Jansenius and Dr. Hessels (two of the most exquisite expositors of Scriptures,
and most Judicious Divines which the Romish Church had after Jansenius and Dr.
Hessells his opinion.
the Reformation was begun by Luther, and Zuinglius, and prosecuted by Calvin)
expressly deny our Saviors dispute in this Chapter, with the Jews, to be
meant at all of Sacramental eating or drinking. The Reason which enforced these
two great Divines, to slight the authority of most writers in their own
Church, and to wave the authority of most ancient Fathers (which it is evident
do understand this place of Sacramental eating and drinking) was, because they
saw no possibility how to maintain the peremptory decrees of the Councels of
Constance, and Basil, concerning Communion under one kind, if the words of our
Savior, ver. 53. of this Chapter, be to be understood of Sacramental eating
and drinking. For it is granted by all, that the Consecrated bread is
Sacramentally his Body, not his Blood; and that the Cup is Sacramentally his
Blood, not his Body: And yet our Saviors words are express, Except ye eat
the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. So
that all which hope to have life, must Sacramentally drink his blood, as well as
eat his flesh, if this place be meant of Sacramental eating. That evasion,
which most o^^ modern Priests and Jesuits use for eluding, rather then
answering this Objection, was too palpable in the Judgment of these two great
Divines, as it since has seemed to others of that Church, which yet maintain
that the former words of our Savior, are to be understood of Sacramental
eating Christ's flesh, and drinking Christ's blood. The evasion of modern Priests
and Jesuits is, that he which Sacramentally receives Christ's Body, under the
shape or form of Sacramental bread, does with it receive his blood per
Concomitantiam, by way of concomitancie, because there is blood contained in
his body which they thus receive. But this cannot satisfy any Romish Divine,
which understands himself, or the ancient Doctrine which that Church pretends
to follow. For this device of receiving Christ's blood in the bread per
concomitantiam, was but a late invention, little above 200. years before
Jansenius or Hessels lived. And the newness of this imagination or invention
(which was generally applauded in the Romish Church in his time) was one
special motive, why that Reverend Pastor of Blessed memory, Mr. Gilpin, did
disclaim the Romish Churches Doctrine in the Point of Transubstantiation, as
Bishop Tunstall his Uncle before him had done.

Secondly, Admitting the bread were turned into Christ's very body, and after
this conversion, had blood in it as truly as flesh and bones, yet all this
would not salve the literal sense of our Saviors words in the 53d verse, if
the eating and drinking which he there speaks of were Sacramental. For suppose
a man should feed upon raw flesh, or upon flesh which had visible or material
blood in it, we might say indeed that he did eat blood per concomitantiam, by
way of concomitancie, because the flesh which he eats had blood in it: But no
man would say, That he did drink blood per concomitantiam. For eating and
drinking are two distinct acts, and incompatible at one and the same time. He
that eats flesh with blood in it, does not eat the flesh and drink the blood
whilst he only eats, but eats both together, the one as principal, the other
as an appurtenance, if he eat as a man, and not as Swine do draugh, which is no
more an eating then a drinking. Or if a man should drink blood mingled with
some small portions of flesh, we might say, He did drink flesh by way of
Concomitancie; but no man would say that he did eat blood per concomitantiam,
albeit there were flesh in the blood which he drinks, for he drinks both
together, he does not eat either. And for these reasons Pope Vid. Tollet in 6.
Johan. Annot. 26.
Innocent expressly denies, that he which eats Christ's body, whilst he only
eats it, does drink his blood. In his fourth Book Myster. Evangel. Legis, ac
Sacramenti Eucharist. Chap. 21. Edit. Venet. in quarto.

8. The only refuge which the most learned in the Romish Church since
Jansenius, and Hessels dyed, have found out for answering the former Objection
of Reformed Writers, is, That the words of our Savior, Except ye eat the Flesh
of the Son of man, And drink his blood, ye have no life in you; are to be
Expounded disjunctively; as thus, Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of man, Or
drink his blood, ye have no life in you. The use or Corollarie of this
Exposition, is, That if Christian people do Sacramentally Either eat Christ's
flesh, Or drink his Blood as they ought, that is, with due preparation, this
will suffice; seeing, as they pretend, By this Exposition, one might as well
Communicate by Receiving only the Cup, as the Bread only.
there is no Divine precept which enjoynes all Christian People Sacramentally
to receive Christ's body and blood under both kinds: Nor all Priests, but only
such as do Officiate or Consecrate. The precept of Institution, Bibite ex hoc
omnes, Drink ye all of this, was punctually directed (as they alledg) to our
Saviors Apostles only, who were at this time made Priests, and authorized to
minister Christ's body and blood after his death. Yet were they not (by their
leave) at this time Sacerdotes conficientes. Our Savior Christ himself did
Consecrate both the Bread and Wine, the Apostles were as much inferior to him,
as the meanest Lay People are to the greatest Priest in the Romish Church, to
the Pope or summus Pontifex himself. But the further Discussion of this Point
belongs more properly to the words of the Institution. The other Point of
expounding et, by vel, or of shuffling in Or for And, belongs to the Cognizance
of the 53, and 56. verses. To justify this exposition, Cardinal Tollet would
persuade us, That St John's Greek Text is full of Hebraismes, and there is
nothing more familiar with Moses, or with other sacred Hebrew writers, then to
use And for Or, Et for Vel. And he brings diverse instances to this purpose: As
for example, that in Exodus 21. 17. He that curses father And mother, shall
surely be put to death. So it is word for word in the Hebrew, and yet our
English Translation, as well as the Vulgar Latin, renders the Original thus, He
that curses father Or mother, shall surely be put to death. And it would be an
ungodly Evasion for any Magistrate, not to censure him as a transgressour of
this Law, which curses his father, albeit he do not curse his mother; or which
curses his mother, albeit he do not curse, but rather bless his father. But
must the true interpretation of such as are to judge according to this Law, be
derived from the peculiar phrase, or dialect of the Hebrews? No, this was
Cardinal Tollet's Error; for the Rule of Interpretation (so the matter or
circumstance be the same) would hold as true in any dialect or language
whatsoever.

The Question then is, What certain general Rule we have, when, or in what
cases, the conjunctive particle [And] does produce this, or the like
disjunctive sense, or may warrant this, or the like Exposition of this Law. [He
that curses father And mother, shall surely die; that is, he which curses
Either father Or mother, shall surely die. For the like Exposition, the Rules
are Two. One General and infallible Rule is this,

Whenever the particle And, does couple not two parts of one and the same
proposition; but two entire propositions together, [That which is thus
conjunctively A Rule to know when And may may be changed into Or.
affirmed of two propositions coupled together, must be disjunctively expounded
of either proposition divided one from the other.] Now when it is said, He that
curses Father And Mother shall die, there be two entire propositions coupled
together by this particle And, implicitly; the explicit sense or Resolution of
which speech is this, He that curses his Father, shall surely die; And he that
curses his Mother shall surely die. And if both these propositions
conjunctively taken, be true, this disjunctive will be as true, He that curses
either father or mother shall die.

Secondly, the Rule is universally true; When two incompatible attributes, A
Second Rule, when And must be turned into Or.
are conjunctively avouched of one and the same subject in one and the same
proposition universally taken, the particle And in this case must be resolved
into the particle Or, when the universal proposition or subject of it is
divided into its parts. Quae dicuntur conjunctim de genere, dicuntur divisim de
specie. As for example, the Philosopher describing the native property of
quantity, says maxim proprium est quantitati, ut ex ea dicantur res aequales
and inaequales. But in as much, as equality and inequality, are incompatible,
if we apply them to the the same particular things which are compared together
for quantity; hence it is, that every particular substance, which is compared
to, or measured with another, must either be equal or unequal unto it. That one
and the same particular substance should be both equal and unequal to another
for quantity, is impossible. So the Philosopher says, (and it is a natural
truth, which none can deny) that the living or sensitive creature universally
taken, is rational and irrational; but because one and the same living
Creature, cannot be both rational and irrational, when we descend to
particular living creatures, we cannot say that any of them is both rational
and irrational, but either rational or irrational. Yet in as much as every
particular living creature, is either endowed with reason, or not endowed with
reason; the living creature universally taken, that is, as it comprehends every
particular living creature, must be both rational and irrational: For,
Quicquid dicitur divisim de Specibus, dicitur conjunctim de Genere.

9. To give such a direct and punctual answer to the Cardinals instance out of
Exodus 21. 17. [He that curses father and mother shall dye.] as may satisfy
all the rest which he brings or can be brought to like purpose; we say, as was
intimated before, there be two entire propositions. 1. He that curses his
father shall dye. 2. He that curses his mother shall dye; and the explication
or unfolding of these two propositions is disjunctively set down by our Savior
himself Matthew. 15. 4. He that curses father or mother shall surely dye. But
there are not two propositions, but one proposition in this Text, He that
eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him. He does not
say here or elsewhere, He that eats my flesh dwells in me and I in him, and
he that drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him. Nor is this disjunctive
any where in Scripture expressed, That he which eats Christ's flesh, or drinks
his blood, dwells in Christ and he in him. That instance which the Cardinal
would wrest to justify his interpretation of our Saviors words in the 53. and
56. verses, does make against him. His instance is, 1 Cor. 11. ver. 27.
Whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, is
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. For in as much as St Paul had said
before, verse 26. that as often as we eat this bread and drink this cup, we
show the Lords death till he come, it will necessarily follow, that albeit we
eat the bread not unworthily, and yet (put such a Case) drink the cup
unworthily, we become guilty both of his Body and Blood, because in both we
solemnize the memory of his death: and he that should both eat the bread and
drink the cup unworthily, is twice guilty of the body and blood of the Lord;
As he that curses both farther and mother is worthy of double death, because
he that curses either father or mother is guilty of death. Nor can it be
alleged that the several parts of this proposition, He that eats my flesh,
and drinks my blood, dwells in me, are incompatible, or cannot be performed
at one and the same sacramental action by one and the same man: or that they
are to be universally, or collectively understood of the whole Church, as
consisting of Priests and Laics, and not distributively of every man: and
therefore to seek a disjunctive sense of these words to this or like effect, he
that eats my flesh, or drinks my blood, dwells in me and I in him, is to
seek a knot in ^^ulrush, or a division in Unity.

Again, The form of our Saviors speech, ver. 53. is exceptive [Except ye eat
the Flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.] The
form is the very same, as if we should say, Except a man honor his Father and
Mother, his seed shall not long prosper upon earth; Now, it would be impiously
absurd to make this construction of that Commandment, Except a man honor
Either his Father, Or his Mother, his seed shall not long prosper upon the
earth. And no better then Thus, is the Construction which Cardinal Tollet or
his followers make of our Savior's words in the 53. verse. Our Savior had
told them before, that He was the Bread of life which came down from heaven;
And pressing the Belief of this Point upon them further, (not by division, but
by addition) he adds, ver. 51. That The Bread which he meant was his Flesh.
And when the Jews, ver. 52. strove about this; He further adds, ver. 53.
Verily, Verily -- Except ye eat -- and drink -- ye have no life in you.

10. But besides the former plunge, whereto the best Scholars in the Romish
Church are put, in justifying their practice for Deteining the Cup from the
Laity, if This Chapter be meant of Sacramental eating, there is another
Difficulty, which neither the late Device of Drinking Christ's Blood per
concomitantiam, nor the Cardinals interpretation of ver. 56. by Disjunction,
will any way touch, much less satisfy.

And the Difficulty is this, If these words be literally meant of Sacramental
A difficulty arising from the words, if literally meant of Sacramental eating.
eating and drinking, their literal sense must be as plain, and as void of all
Trope or Metaphor, as the words of the Institution related by Saint Matthew,
Chap. 26. 26. are by them supposed to be. Now when Christ says in Saint
Matthew, That the bread is his Body, this speech, in the literal sense (as
they contend) infers a substantial change of the Bread into the substance of
his body. Now our Saviors words are in this place as plain and as certain as
in that. He avoucheth again and again that he is the bread of life, that the
bread which he will give is his flesh, that his flesh is meat indeed, that his
blood is drink indeed. Now, if the sacramental bread, in St Matthew, cannot
literally be said to be his body unless it be converted into the substance of
his body, then cannot Christ himself literally be said to be bread, unless
his substance be converted into the substance of bread. His flesh cannot
literaly be said meat indeed, unless it be really and substantially converted
into meat; his blood cannot be said drink indeed, unless it be really
transubstantiated into drink.: If they grant these words to be meant of
Sacramental eating, or to be equivalent to the words of the Institution. Now to
deny these words to be meant of sacramental eating is every way less
expedient for reformed Churches than for the Romish. And yet to restrayn them
either to Sacramental eating only, or to Spiritual eating excluding
sacramental, is worst of all. We are therefore to consider, that sacramental
eating and spiritual eating, are not opposite or incompatible, but subordinate.
Our eating of Christ's body and drinking of Christ's blood are then complete,
when they are Sacramentally spiritual, or spiritually sacramental. For as
Calvin excellently observes (albeit such as profess themselves zealous
followers of him, either do not understand him, or do not second him) to eat
Christ's body and drink Christ's blood [Sacramentally] is more then to believe in
Christ, more than to have our faith awaked or quickened by the sacramental
pledges. For no man can spiritually eat Christ, but by believing his death and
passion; yet sacramental eating adds some what to spiritual eating, how quick
and lively soever our faith be whilst we eat him only spiritually. For
though our faith were in both the same, as well for degree as quality: yet the
object of our faith is not altogether the same, at least the Union of our faith
unto the same object, is not altogether the same, in sacramental and in
spiritual eating. Christ's body and blood are so present in the Sacrament, that
we receive a more special influence from them in use of the sacrament, than
without it we do; so we receive it worthily, or with hearts prepared by
spiritual eating precedent, that is, by serious meditation of Christ's death and
passion. It is not all one, either not to think on Christ's death and passion
out of the sacrament, or to think on them negligently or not reverently, and to
receive the sacrament of his body and blood unworthily, negligently or
irreverently. Now as the effects or consequence of the unworthy Receiving the
Holy Sacrament is more Dangerous then the Effects or Consequence of not eating
Christ Spiritually, or of Careless Meditation upon Christ's death and passion;
so the Effect of Sacramental Receiving worthily and faithfully performed, is a
Greater refreshing to the Soul, then the effect of Receiving Him Spiritually
only, though reverently and as becomes us. Now unto the reverent and worthy
Receiving of Christ's Body and Blood both ways, that is, both Spiritually and
Sacramentally, as being the most complete performance of the Condition
required, is the Promise of our Savior most immediately annexed; He that So
eats my Flesh and drinks my Blood Dwells in Me and I in Him. The meaning
of which Promise was the Second Point proposed paragraph the 5th. and should be
next handled, but that the Application here desires to be inserted.

11. What has been spelled apart, let us now put together. He that The
Application relating to the 1st General.
intends aright to eat Christ's flesh and drink his Blood Sacramentally, to his
Souls Health, must come prepared by a right and worthy receiving of Both,
Spiritually. Now we Spiritually eat Christ's Flesh, and drink his Blood, as
often as we reverently, and faithfully meditate upon Christ's Death, and
remember it aright. And this we do, when we take a true Estimate of ourselves,
and of his death and sufferings for us. For this is both duly to examine our
selves, or our own souls; and rightly to Esteem or Discern the Two Duties. 1
To examine our selves. 2. To Discern The Lords Body.
Lord's Body. To Discern his Body from the bodies of other men, we cannot;
unless we believe and acknowledge it to be The Body of the Son of God, The
body of God Blessed for ever: as was showed at large before in other Tracts,
and in the forepart of this Book. And this we may do, and yet not rightly
esteem that Love which Christ showed unto us, in offering his Body and Blood,
in respect of the love of others which would perhaps adventure their Bodies,
and shed their blood for us.

12. To remember a A Good turn done by a friend, and not to value and prize it
as we ought, is rather to forget then to remember his Friendlinesse. Now no man
can rightly prize the Death of Christ and the benefits thereof, unless he
truly believe that Christ Dyed for him. But is Every one bound to believe
This? Yes. He that does not believe This, does not believe that Christ is The
Messiah, or the Redeemer of the World. To doubt of This, is a degree of
Infidelity: to deny it, is more then Heresy, a point of Jewish Infidelity.
Yet to believe thus much, and no more, does not immediately make a good
Christian, or worthy receiver of the Holy Sacrament. What more then must every
one believe? That Christ dyed for him in particular? certainly he must. Nor
does the belief of This make him sure of his Salvation. Every one must believe
that Christ dyed for him in particular, that he may be a worthy Receiver; And
Every One must worthily receive this Holy Sacrament, that is, worthily remember
Christ's death, that he may make his Election sure.

But in what sense must Every one believe that Christ dyed for him in
particular? not Exclusively, as if he dyed not for others as well as for him:
for this were to have the faith of Christ with respect of persons; without
charity, Of the first part of man's Redemption, or the Ransom paid for all. See
Book 9. Chap. 5.
and contrary to reason. For if Every one must believe that Christ died for
him in particular, then every man must believe that Christ dyed for all men as
well as for him. Otherwise, some men should be bound to believe an untruth. But
if he died for all men, how is he said to die for thee and me in particular?
Very well; Thus. Though He dyed for all as well as for Thee or me, yet did he
not Die partly for thee, and partly for me, and partly for others, but entirely
for every one.

13. Plato (as Seneca in his 6. Book De Beneficijs, Cap. 18. tells us) thought
himself obliged in kindness to one that had Transported him over a River
without paying his Fare; he reckoned it, Positum apud Platonem officium: But
when he saw others partakers of the same Benefit, he Disclaimed the Debt. Hence
Seneca draws This Aphorism; It is not enough for him that will oblige me unto
him, to do me a good Turn, unless he do it, as to my self directly: non tantum
mihi sed tanquam mihi. If upon the like considerations, or to the end that they
may think themselves obliged to the Son of God more then other men are, some in
our days have taught, That Christ did not only suffer all for them, but as for
them in particular; all others, (being not such as they deemed themselves to
be, that is, not truly Elect) being excluded from the Benefit of his
sufferings: This is the best Use, and most Charitable construction that can be
made of so unuseful and uncharitable a Doctrine. Though, to gather any good Use
from it, is as impossible as to reap Figgs of Thistles.

Howbeit, as well as they who hold That Christ died for the Elect only, as they
which teach, That he dyed for all, must beware, lest they mis-apply That Rule
of Seneca's, touching ordinary benefits, or Common courtesies, unto that
Extraordinary loving kindness of Christ's sufferings: Quod debeo cum multis,
solvam cum multis; That which I owe amongst others, I will not pay alone. His
meaning is, That for Common benefits he is only bound to pay his share or
portion. Far be it from any one that names the Name of the Lord Jesus, to
reason thus in his heart or secret thoughts. Christ died for the many hundreds
of thousands now living, and for the more hundreds of ten thousands late or
long since dead, as well as for me; therefore I owe him love and thankfulness,
but pro rata; (suppose the exact number was certainly known) I am but to
acknowledge such a part of his sufferings to have been undertaken for me, as I
am of that great multitude. Every humane soul is indebted to Christ for the
whole, not every single man for his part of man's Redemption. That which St.
Bernard speaks in a Case not altogether the same, is most true of the Benefits
of Christ's sufferings; Nec in multitudinem divisa sunt, nec ad paucitatem
restricta: If Gods love to mankind be infinite, and if the value of Christ's
blood or sufferings be truly infinite (as they truly be) they cannot be divided
amongst many, much less can they be restrained to some few; both these being
against the nature of Infinity. And if the value of Christ's sufferings cannot
be divided into parts, Every one must acknowledge, that He paid an infinite
price for his Redemption in particular. A price less then infinite could not
have Redeemed any one of us, and a price more then infinite could not be given
for all. If Christ became a second Adam, to die and suffer for redeeming man,
he dyed and suffered for all men, for every man, albeit the number of men which
proceed from the first Adam could be infinite. Had it been the Will or Purpose
of the Son of God, to have taken upon him the Form of a Servant, immediately
upon the First Woman's sin of Disobedience, his sufferings for her could not
have sufficed, unless they had been of value infinite: And being of value
infinite for her, they had been of the same value for every living Soul that
issued from her to the Worlds end.

If then, the price he laid down for thee were infinite, that is, without
measure or Bounds, thy Love and thankfulness to Him must be without Stint or
limit. Though He died for others as well as thee, yet art thou bound to love
Him no less, then if he had died for thee alone. Thus must Thou think of
Christ's Death and Passion if thou remember it aright: And as often as thou
Read, Hear, or make Confession with thy Lips That Christ's Blood was
shed for thee, make this Comment or Paraphrase in thine heart, He shed his
whole Blood for me, every drop that fell from Him, either in the Garden or on
the Cross, or elsewhere, was poured out for my sake, for me in particular.
Yea, every one which hears of Christ is bound to believe that he dyed for him,
and as for him, that the benefit of his Passion redounds et mihi, et tanquam
mihi: and charity, if it spring from Faith, will teach us to exclude none from
Title to the benefits of Christ's Death and sufferings.

14. This Doctrine of Christ's Dying for All, of His purpose to dissolve the
works of Satan in all, I am bold to profess in every place where Christ's Name
is called upon, in every place where I have or may have opportunity to make
Christ known: The bolder, because it sets forth, not only the Love and Mercy,
but the Justice of God, a great deal more, then the contrary Doctrine can do.
It makes man's sinfulness and unthankfulness appear much greater, then by the
contrary Doctrine can be apprehended or acknowledged. Besides, it makes our
Ministry of preaching more useful then otherwise it could be. For, if we grant
That Christ dyed only Three Uses of the Doctrine, that Christ paid the Ransom
for all.
for the Elect, we might acquit our selves with safety of Conscience from the
burden of preaching or Catechizing, save only in those Congregations which we
know to be of the number of the Elect, or men already regenerate. Howbeit even
in respect of Them, our preaching could not be so useful, as it would be
harmful to others. We could but testify that to the Elect which they already
know, that is, that they shall be saved. But if once we teach that the Elect
only or some few (perhaps one of a Thousand, not one of five hundred) have any
interest in Christ's sufferings, every man which is not as yet regenerate nor in
the state of Election, would forthwith conclude, that it is a thousand to One
(more then five hundred to One) that he can receive no benefit from Christ's
sufferings, having no interest in the everlasting inheritance purchased by
them. And were it not much better to be silenced, then by our preaching to put
such stumbling blocks in their ways whom we are sent to call unto Christ? For
we are not sent to call the righteous, or men already regenerate, but sinners
to repentance, to the state of regeneration.

How true soever in the Event it may prove, That but a Few shall be saved in
respect of them that perish, though the most part of men do die in their sins,
yet their blood shall be required at their hands, who have taught, that they
could not be saved, that Christ did not die, did not suffer for them. But if we
teach, as God in his Word has taught us, That Christ Dyed and suffered for all
men, no man can doubt whether Christ dyed Joh. 1. 29 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15 Heb. 2. 9
2 Pet. 2. 1
for him or no; and not doubting that Christ dyed for him, he need not Despair
of Salvation by him: we leave him without excuse for not repenting and seeking
Christ.

Again, This same Doctrine sets forth the Glory of God much more then the
other can. For, albeit Gods mercies unto One man be truly infinite, or rather
infinite in themselves, yet, if according to this infinity they be extended
unto all, they are extensively much greater. If God had created only these
inferior Elements, and man; their creation would necessarily infer the
infinity of his power (for without infinite power nothing could have been made
of Nothing) but yet his praise or glory would not have appeared so great in
the creation of Earth and Water, as it does in the creation, not of them only,
but of the whole heavens with all their Hosts and furniture. The more Gods
creatures be, the greater be his praises, for this Tribute he ought to receive
from all of them, for their very Being. In like manner, though the Redemption
of one or some few men, do truly argue the value of his sufferings to be truly
infinite; yet, the more they be for whom he dyed, the more is his glory, the
greater is his praise: For all are bound jointly and severally to laud and
magnify his Name for the infinite price of their Redemption.

15. Lastly, This Doctrine is so necessary for manifesting the just measure of
their unthankfulness which perish, that without This we cannot take so much as
a true Surface of it; not so much as the least Dimension of Sin. Some there be
which tell us, that we had power in Adam to Glorify God, but, that finning in
Adam, our sin is infinite, because against an infinite Majesty: For so it is,
that the greater the Party is whom we offend, the greater always the offense
is. And thus by degrees they gather, that every sin against the infinite
Majesty of God deserves infinity of Punishment. But, albeit, the degrees of
Sin, which See Book 8. page 142.
accrue from the degrees of Dignity in the person whom we offend, be
successively infinite; yet because these Degrees are indeterminate, every man,
which has any skill at all in Arguments of Proportion, must needs know, that
it is impossible for the wit or art of man to find out the true Product of such
Calculatorie Inductions, or to conjecture unto what set measure of ingratitude,
these infinite degrees will amount. It is not the ten-hundreth-thousandth part
of any Sin that can be truly notifyed unto us by inferences of this kind. How
then shall we take the true measure of our Sins, or the full Dimension of our
unthankfulness? From the Great Goodness of God in our Creation, and the
unmeasurable Love of Christ in our Redemption. If God in our Creation (as the
Psalmist says) did make us but little lower then the Glorious Angels, that the
might afterward crown us with Glory everlasting: if, when, through the First
man's folly we had lost that Honor; he made his Only Son for a little while,
for 33. years space, lower then the Angels, that he might exalt Him above all
Principality and Power, and in Him recrown us with Honor and Glory aequal to
the Angels, Their Sin is truly infinite, their unthankfulness is
unexpressible, and justly deserves punishment everlasting, who voluntarily and
continually despise so great Salvation which by Christ was purchased for them.
No Torment can be too great, no anguish too Durable, because no Happiness could
be in any degree comparable, much less equal, to that which they refused,
though treasured up for them in that inexhaustible fountain of happiness
Christ Jesus our Lord, our God, and our Redeemer.

To conclude this meditation: It is a thing most seriously to be considered,
That though Gods mercies in Christ can never be magnified too much, yet may
they be apprehended amiss: And, that, as it is most Dangerous to sink in Deep
waters wherein it is the easiest to Swim; so, the more infinite Gods mercies
toward us are, the more deadly sin it is to Dally with them, or Dangerous to
Dally with Gods mercies.
to take encouragement by the Contemplation of them to continue in Sin. The
contemplation of their infinity is then most seasonable, when we are touched
with a feeling of the infiniteness of our sins. In that case, we can not look
upon them but we shall be desirous to be partakers of them, and that upon such
Terms as God offers them, the forsaking of all our sins. Pro. 28. 13.

16. But is this all that thou art to remember, when thou art, by Spiritual
eating and drinking Christ's flesh and blood, a preparing thy self for
Sacramental and Spiritual receiving him together in The Lords Supper? is it
enough to acknowledge, that he paid as great a Ransom for thee as he did for
all Mankind in general? No! This is but the first part of thy Redemption: and
this first part of thy redemption was entirely, and alsufficiently, and most
effectually wrought for thee, before any part of thy body was framed, before
thy Soul was created: it was then wrought for thee without any endeavor or
wish of thine: No more was required at thy hands for this work, then was
required of thee for thy creation. But there is A second part of thy
Redemption, of which that saying of A Father, is true, Qui fecit te sine te,
non salvabit te sine te, He that made thee without any work or endeavor of
thine, will not save (will not Redeem) thee, without some, endeavor at least,
on thy part.

What then is the second part of the Redemption, which we expect that Christ
should yet work in us and for us? or what is the endeavor on our parts
required that he should work it in us and for us? The second part of our
Redemption, which is yet in most of us to be accomplished, is, The
Mortification of our Bodies, the diminishing the Reign of sin in them; in a
word, our Sanctification or Ratification of our Election. These are wholly
Christ's See Book 10. Chap. 31.
works, the sole works of God, for it is He that works in us both the will and
the Deed: and yet are we commanded to work out our own Salvation; to make our
Election sure. But how shall we do this, which is wholly Gods work? or what are
we to do, that these works may be wrought in us? Besides the renewing of the
Astipulation or answer of a Pure Conscience, and Resumption of our BAPTISMAL
VOW, heretofore mentioned; we are to humble our selves mightily before the
Lord, by a meek Book 10. Chapter 50
acknowledgement of our vileness, and sincere confession of our sins. And if
we so humble our selves, He that gives Grace to the humble will lift us up;
if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness: not only to remit and cover our
iniquities, but to purify our hearts, and renew our spirits and minds, that
they shall bring forth fruits unto holiness. We are to call upon God by the
prayer of faith and perseverance: Turn thou us Good Lord, and so shall we be
turned; Speak but Thou the word, and Thy Servants shall be whole.

17. Thus we may esteem of Christ's love to us, and yet not examine or judge our
selves as we ought before we eat This Bread and Drink this Cup. A Second Duty
to Examine our selves.
To examine and judge our selves aright, requires these Two meditations, or Two
parts of one and the same meditation. First, How far we are guilty of
Christ's Death by our Sins. But this falls under the former Meditation, That
Christ Dyed for us all, not only all jointly considered, but for every one in
particular, or as alone considered: and if he dyed for every one in
particular, or as alone considered, then every one may and must thus judge,
Then were all dead, and every one in particular was a true cause of His Death.
And this Meditation will make easy way to the Second, or second part of the
same Meditation, which is This: Wherein, or in what respects, every one of us
does wrong Christ Jesus more, or may do him more wrong then they did, which
actually wrought his Death: that is, then Annas and Caiaphas, then the Scribes
and Pharisees, then the Priests and Elders that plotted and conspired it, did.

But, does any man which Professes Christianity at this day, wrong Him more
then Annas and Caiaphas, and their associats did? Yes, a great many! All that
both daily and hourly do that which is more against his most Holy will, then
all that Annas and Caiaphas and the Roman Soldiers did unto Him, wrong Him
more then they did in putting Him to Death. The only Rule for measuring any
personal wrong, is the opposition which the Act or practice bears or includes
unto the will or liking of the party which is displeased or wronged.

To apply this to our present purpose. Annas and Caiaphas and their accomplices,
did our Savior more wrong, then Cain did Abel his innocent Brother, when he
took away his life. For, Death, especially a violent death, was as bitter unto
Christ, as man, as it was to Abel. So were the revileings, the slanders, and
the defamations, which the people (by the instigation of the Priests, Scribes,
and Pharisees) cast upon him, most displeasing to His Humane Will. Yet were all
these personal wrongs more unpleasant to his most Holy Will as he was The Son
of God, then unto his Humane Nature, then unto his disposition or affection, as
He was the Son of David. And albeit he suffered nothing which his heavenly
Father had not fore-determined, yet he that would excuse his persecutors from
doing him wrong, were worse then an Infidel. Neither will this excuse us from
doing him greater wrong then these his persecutors did, if we do those things
which are more displeasant to Him, more contrary, not only to his Divine, but
even to His Humane Will and Nature now Glorified in Heaven, then all the wrongs
which Satan and his instruments did unto Him, whilst He lived here on earth,
whilst He was partaker of mortality with us.

18. But what do we? or what can we do more displeasant to His Holy Will, then
what they did, who maliciously accused Him, who more maliciously sought his
condemnation, who after. His condemnation, did more maliciously and Inhumanely
treat and persecute Him, then any Barbarian would do a Malefactor which had
yielded himself to a Legal Trial?

Surely, if we do those things which He is more unwilling we should do, then He
was to suffer all the indignities which the Scribes and Pharisees could put
upon Him, then all the torments which the Roman Laws could inflict upon Him; we
wrong Him much more, then either the Jews or the Roman Soldiers did. For He
did not suffer, either the Torments which seized upon Him whilst He was upon
the Cross, or in the Garden, because He could not avoid or resist them, but
because He was more willing to suffer all these, then a greater inconvenience,
which should have befallen all and every one of Us, unless these mischiefs
(as the world accounts them) had befallen Him. The inconveniences which He
sought to prevent by voluntary undergoing these Calamities, were, the Dominion
or Reign of Sin in us, and our Servitude unto Satan by this Reign of Sin. For,
for this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that He might Dissolve or
Destroy the works of the Devil: And His manifestation did contein, not only His
Incarnation, but His Exemplarie persecution, His Death and Passion, which he
was more willing to undergo, then to suffer the works of Satan, in any one of
us, to be undissolved. If we then shall hold on his side, or seek to keep him
in, whom Christ came to cast out; or shall build again that Babel which Christ
came to destroy; if we take part with Satan, as all those do, which do those
things whereby the works of Satan may be maintained or augmented, whereby the
Reign or Soveraigntie of Satan may be confirmed or enlarged, we do those things
which are more displeasing to Christ, then his Death and Passion was. And by
doing such things (according to the former Rule) we wrong Him more then they
did, which did conspire or Complot His Death, then they did, which put Him to
that most cruel ignominious Death: For He was more willing to suffer That
Death, to suffer all the indignities, that the Devil or world could put upon
Him, then to suffer us, any one of us, to live and dye in our sins, and in the
servitude and power of Satan. Thus much by way of Application, as relating to
the First General; Proceed we now to the Second General; He -- Dwells in
me, and I in him.

19. Dwells in Me, and I in him: Or, Abides in Me, and I in him.

The word in the Original varies it is signification according to the
Circumstances of matters handled. Sometimes it signifies no more then to The
Second General.
abide or remain, though but for an Hour or Two. Sometimes it necessarily
imports as much as our English Expresses in the Text, that is, A dwelling or
mansion. From this real difference of the matter and circumstance, the word
(...) is by our English one while expressed (as here it is) by Dwelling, another
while by Abiding or remaining, within the compass of one Period. For Example;
John 1. ver. 39. John's two Disciples ask our Savior, Rabbi, (...); where do
thou dwell? And he says unto them; Come and see. They came and saw where He
dwelt; (...), and abode with Him that day. Though the word in the Original be
in all three places the same, and though the Translators had twice rendered it
by Dwelling, yet in the third place, they do not say, And they dwelt, but, they
Abode with Him that day. Every Dwelling includes an Abiding, but every Abiding
does not include or implie a Dwelling. Dwelling implies a constant or frequent
place of Abode; and somewhat more then so, a place of known or professed Abode,
no lurking-hole, or sculking-place. All these circumstances concur to justify
the Translation of the Original word here, rather by Dwelling, than by Abiding.
For Christ's abiding in us (if we so eat his flesh and drink his blood as he
prescribes) is constant, is frequent, and perpetual. And whilst he abides in
us, our abiding in him is not only constant and frequent, but the known, or
professed place of our abode (and it is the best profession to be of his
household). It is he that feeds us in time of peace, and he is our Tower of
defense in time of War, the Rock of our Salvation, whilst we are beset with
death and danger. Be thou to me, says the Psalmist, Psalm 71. 3. my strong
habitation, whereto I may continually resort; thou have given commandment to
save me, for thou art my Rock, and my Fortress.

But that Christ is the Rock of our Salvation, of our habitation in distress,
is a point which needs no further proof, no amplification. Yet seeing he is our
dwelling place, the Rock of our Habitation in whom we dwell: Though a man be in
the house as the Dweller; The house may be in the Man, as the right owner,
possessor, and hous-holder.
How can he be said to dwell in us? An house may be said to be in the City,
but may we say that the City is in the house? Men dwell in Houses or Tents, but
was it ever heard that Houses or Tents did dwell in men, that are the Lords and
owners of them? The branch may abide in the Tree; So may the Graft in the
Stock, but who would say, That the Tree abides in the Branch, or the Stock in
the Graft? How then is it said, That the Rock both of our Salvation and
Habitation, the Sanctuary of our Souls in all distress does dwell in us? How
can He, who is the Root of Jesse (the Root of David Revel. 5. 5.) The True Vine
which Gods own Right Hand has planted, abide in us, who are but wild slips
lately ingrafted into the Stem from which the natural Branches were broken off?

20. The Difficulty arising from this Doubled Comparison, though really Two
Difficulties.
but One, must be handled in Two.

First, How Christ may be said to dwell in us, and we in Him.

Secondly, How He may be said to abide in us, and not we in Him only.

This mutual Inhabitation and Reciprocal abode or In-Being, is very mystical
and admirable. Yet may our apprehension of it be facilitated, by observing some
resemblances thereof in other things, far different. To name that First which
is worst. That possession of the Body of man, which evil Spirits did usurp, in
our Saviors time, is in H. Scripture often set down in terms denoting the Evil
Spirits being in the man, Matthew. 12. 45. They enter in and dwell there. and Chapter
8. 31. if thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the Herd of swine. And Acts.
19. 16. The man in whom the evil spirit was. Yet does S. Mark, Chapt. 1. 23.
and Chapt. 5. 2. express this in the Original, as if the man was in an Evil
Spirit: (...) Logic and Philosophy tell us, that The whole is in the parts,
and the parts in the whole; whether it be a Totum potentiale, or Universale.
(as Genus, which is in the Species; and the Species likewise in the Genus:) or
whether it be Totum Collectivum; so the City is in the Several Families or
Houshoulds, and these again are in the City. Some Good Divines have taken
notice of That Speech or expression, Enter thou into thy Masters Joy; as
importing the wondrous amplitude thereof: it is such, as cannot be comprehended
or contained within him, but he must enter into it. Yet sure, that Joy does
both Satiate the Soul and Replenish the Body of him that enters into it. He
is, as if we could suppose a large Vessel of Crystal or transparent Gold let
down into a Sea of Nectar or living waters. But the expressions of Scripture
about God the Father his being in Christ, and Christ in Him, and in us, and of
our Being in Him; and of Joh. 17. 11, 21, 22, 23, 26.
Christ and his Holy Spirit being in us, is various; Especially, In S. John.
Chap. 14. verses 10, 11, 16, 17, 20, 23. and perhaps more easy to be
experimented by the Christian Union with God, then to be explayned in words
more easy then the texts themselves.

21. To let these pass then; The proposed Difficulties must have their proper
Solutions: the former from the explication of that Great Attribute of Christ,
to wit, that He is the Chief-corner stone etc. The other Difficulty referres
to that Metaphor of the vine and the Branches, or of the Stock and the Grafts.

Christ is compared unto A stone or Rock, and we unto living Stones The former
difficulty explained.
built upon it, in respect of the strength and firmness of the foundation and
structure of Gods House or Temple.

He is, again, rightly compared to the vine, to an Olive or other more
fruitful tree, and we unto Branches or grafts (not springing from the Root,
but ingrafted into it) in respect of our growth in Him, and of the Diffusion of
His virtue into us and through us.

That we are built upon Christ (as the Apostle says Ephesians. 2. 20.) this does
argue that we dwell in him, that He is the Rock of our habitation. In that we
are built on him, as on the Chief Cornerstone: not under Him only, as He is
Summus angularis lapis, the Chief Stone at the Topp, but upon Him as Lapis
imus, the First-Foundation-stone too, and that a Living stone, which was cut
out of the Mountain without Hands, and which was to grow into a Mountain
filling the whole earth; This inferres, That he must dwell in us. For the
stone, which Daniel speaks of, did not become a great mountain, so great a
mountain as should fill all the earth, by addition or by heaping, or building
one stone upon another, but by the growth of life; that is, by increase or
augmentation of the same stone. Did this stone then increase or grow from small
beginings unto a mountain, overspreading the whole earth? If this we say, the
rock of our salvation or habitation must receive increase of life, and become a
greater habitation or dwelling place in this last Age than he had been in any
former. But how should this be true? seeing he is, and was the rock of ages,
the Rock on which the world it self is Founded; the rock by which the earth it
self which supporteth all other rocks, is supported, Heb. 1. 3.

22. Such a Rock he was from eternity as he is God, not as he is man. As man,
he was first as a little stone, yet a growing stone, for he grew in wisdom, and
stature, and favor with God and man, Luke. 2. 52. As God he could not be the
cornerstone which God had promised to lay in Sion. Yet was Christ, who was
both God and man, That stone which was laid in Sion. And as he, which was both
God and man, did suffer for us, was raised again the third day from the dead,
not according to his Godhead, but according to his manhood: So was he (the same
Christ, which was both God and man) the stone laid in Sion, not according to
his Godhead, but according to his manhood. This gives us the ordinary
interpretation of the Prophet Esaias Chapt. 28. 16. But A late Interpreter of
prophecies or visions, has observed an Hypallage, or inversion in these words,
not infrequent in the Prophets, familiar (as he alleges) to the Hebrew
writers, such an inversion Esai. 8. 14. Romans 9 33. 1 Pet. 2. 6.
as Grammarians observe in that of the Poet,

In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas
Corpora --.
That is, Forms changed into new bodies, for bodies changed into new forms.
Thus says this late Interpreter, when the Prophet says, mitto lapidem in
Sionem, I lay or place a stone in Sion, the meaning is, as if he had said, I
lay Anton. Fernandius, Cited in the next Chapter.
or found Sion, the spiritual Sion or new Jerusalem in a Stone, or chief
corner stone elect and precious. But whether this be the grammatical or literal
sense of the prophet, I leave for Critics in the Hebrew dialect to determine.
Both constructions, the ordinary and this Critical, are true, and compatible;
both in respect of the matter, are necessary: Christ God and man was laid in
Sion, as a sure foundation stone, as Imus angularis Lapis, as the lowest corner
stone, unto which S. Peter, for precedencie of time (so far we yield unto his
primacie) was first annexed. Peter was the first living stone, which was Built
upon this foundation stone: the other Apostles were laid, not upon Peter, but
upon the same foundation stone, whether one after another or all together, we
will not dspute. However, all that believe as Peter and the other Apostles did,
or shall so believe unto the worlds end, are immediately laid upon the same
foundation stone, not one upon another, no one of them upon Peter, or upon any
other Apostle; their union or annexion unto Christ, is as immediate as Peter's
was, and is or shall be, as indissoluble as his was to Christ, albeit, their
growth be not so great, nor for quality so glorious. The best inscription of
this edifice thus immediately erected upon the same stone, would be that of the
Poet, Crescet crescentibus illis. As the number of living stones, which are
laid upon this foundation stone increase, so the foundation or corner stone
which God did promise to lay in Sion, does still increase. As every particular
living stone increases or grows from a stone into a pillar of this house of
God; from a pillar in the house of God, unto a temple of God; so this
foundation stone, that is, Christ as man, still grows, still increases, not
in himself, but in them. For they grow by his growth in them, or by diffusion
of life from him into them.

23. But though Christ be often called A stone, a rock, a living stone, The
Second Difficulty explained.
a living rock, or a stone which being cut out of a mountain, became a Mountain
which filled all the earth; yet the manner of his growth in us, or the manner
of his enlarged habitation through the Church, may be best conceived by the
manner of the souls growth or diffusion of his Virtue throughout Vegetable or
sensible bodies, that is, through trees or plants, or through the bodies of
men, of beasts, or such as we call living creatures. There is a vegetable soul
in the Ake-corn when it is first set or planted; and this soul we may truly
say dwells or abides in the Akorn, and is the cause why the Akorn sprouteth
into a rod: the same soul is the cause why the rod or twig grows greater, the
true cause why this twig grows into a stem, why the stem grown greater,
spreads it self into branches, why every branch bears leaf, blossom, or seed.
Now the greater the stem does grow, the further the vegetable soul does
spread it self; The same vegetable soul which was in the Akorn diffuseth it
self into the stem, into the branches, into the leaf, into the blossom, into
the Fruit or seed. None of these could thrive or prosper at all, unless the
vegetable soul did abide or dwell in them, none of them can thrive or prosper
any longer, than the vegetable soul abides or dwells in them. Thus was
Christ the root out of which S. Peter See Joh. 15. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. where the
abode is mutual.
sprouted, the soul of Peter as he was a living or Spiritual man. He had no
life but from Christ, he grew by Christ dwelling or abiding in him. And as he
did grow by Christ abiding in him; So he bare fruit by Christ's dwelling in him,
by the diffusion of life, and vegetation from Christ. And so all they, that
abiding in Christ do grow in faith, grow by Christ dwelling in them and
spreading his virtue through them, after such a manner as the vegetable soul
does diffuse it self throughout the Branches which spring from the root or
stem, or through the branches which are ingrafted or inoculated into it. And
this manner of the vegetable souls diffusion of it self (or of its virtue) into
all the Branches which are ingrafted into the same stock or root, does better
resemble the manner of Christ's dwelling in us, than the diffusion of life or
vegetation from the root into the stemmes, stovens or branches, which without
ingraffing or inoculation naturally spring from it.

24. But this later similitude of the Stock and Grafts, although it well
express the manner of Christ's abiding or growing, not in himself, but in us,
and the manner of our abiding or dwelling in him; it may seem to fail in this;
That ordinary Stocks, howsoever the ingrafted branches be supported by them,
and receive life and nutriment from them, yet do they not receive their
specifical kind of life from the stocks into which they are ingrafted, but
still retain their own native quality. As a good Apple or Pear grafted into a
Crab stock or Thorn, does not degenerate into a Crab or Thorn, but reteins its
native sweetness, and bears the same fruit which it would have done, although
it had grown up into a Tree from its own root, or from the root whereof it was
a native Branch. It would be a Soloecism to say, That any such stock does
remain or dwell in the Graft, because it does not diffuse its specifical
quality into it. But Christ in this manner abides or dwells in us. He is
the Root and Stem, and we the Grafts and inset branches, and yet he is said as
truly to dwell in us, as we in him. This argues that the manner of our
ingrafting and abiding in him is not natural, because the Stock or Stem, is for
nature and quality much better than all the Branches or Grafts which are
supported by it, which receive life and nutriment by it. Hence says the
Apostle, Romans 11. 24. That we Gentiles were cut out of the Olive tree which was
wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good Olive tree.
This ingraftment is contrary unto nature two ways;

First, In that the Grafts being wild by nature, without any root, or fat, or
sweetness in themselves, grow better qualified then they were, by participation
of the sweetness of the Stock.

Secondly, In that the Stock whereinto they are ingrafted, is a good Olive;
whereas the Olive tree, naturally admits no ingraftment, or incision, being by
nature so fat, that it seems to envy or scorn to participate his fatness unto
any other Branches. In arbore pingui non vivunt insita, Grafts do not thrive or
prosper in any fat tree or stock, says A late Naturalist. And as an Hebrew
Doctor has Observed, the Olive, being the fattest of Trees, will admit no
incision, nor ingraftment. Nor will any Olive Graft thrive or prosper, unless
it be ingrafted in an hungry stock. That fatness is as peculiar to the Olive,
as sweetness to the Fig or Vine; besides experience, we have the authority of
Scripture, Judge. 9. ver. 9. The trees went forth on a time to anoint a King
over them, and they said unto the Olive tree, Reign thou over us; But the Olive
tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness wherewith by me they honor God
and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? And the trees said unto the Fig
tree, Come thou and Reign over us; But the Fig tree said unto them, Should I
forsake my sweetness and my good fruit, etc? Yet is Christ Jesus the True
Olive Tree, but left his fatness for a time, that we, being by nature wild
Olives might be ingrafted into him, and being ingrafted might participate of
his fatness and sweetness, which is no other, then that whereof the natural
Olive is the Emblem, to wit, Peace, even the Peace of God which surpasses all
understanding. Peace was his Embassage; as the Apostle says, He is our peace,
who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition
between Joh. 14. 27 Joh. 16. 33
us, etc. And came and preached peace unto you, which were afar off, and to
them that were nigh, Ephesians. 2. verses 14. 17.

CHAP. V. The Great Attribute of Christ [His being the Chief Corner-Stone]
handled in the foregoing Chapter, prosecuted more amply in this. Christ is the
Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. How Christians being built upon this
Foundation, do grow into an Holy Temple.
Ephesians 2. 20, 21. And are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Cornerstone. In whom all the
building fitly framed together, grows unto an holy Temple in the Lord.
1. THe Sum of our Apostles speech in this Chapter, (whereof these words are
the Conclusion) is this; That these Ephesians who were Gentiles by progeny,
far off from God, and Aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, had now the
privilege of Gods Saints, were fellow Citizens with them, and of the household
of God, as it is, ver. 19. And to assure them of this Privilege or perogative,
he adds ver. 20. That they were built upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone. Jesus Christ was
the Best Foundation, the only foundation, which could give this prerogative to
the Apostles or Prophets, to be either Saints or of the household of God. And he
it is, that gave to these Ephesians, though by nature Gentiles; and that gives
to all, whosoever are built upon this Cornerstone, the like Privilege, a
privilege or prerogative to be native parts of that Holy Temple, which Jesus
Christ came down from heaven to build here on earth.

2. The Points then to be discussed are Three.

First, What is meant by the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles. Three
Points to be Discussed.


Secondly, In what manner Christ is said to be the chief Cornerstone.

Thirdly, The manner how we are built upon the foundation here meant, or upon
this Cornerstone, with the manner of our growth into an Holy Temple.

First, Whatsoever be here meant by the Foundation, it is not restrained to any
one Prophet or Apostle. The meanest Prophet is not excluded; Moses and Samuel
are to be numbered amongst the Prophets here meant, they were no foundations of
the rest. Nor is Peter here included as the foundation of the other Apostles,
but as a joint part of this Foundation, or of the Building erected upon it;
whether we consider his Person or Doctrine. Many Interpreters of good note,
understand the Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, so says Hugo Cardinalis,
Super doctrinam Apostolorum and Prophetarum: But every Sound Doctrine must have
a sure Foundation. What then is the Foundation of the Apostolic and
Prophetical Doctrine? That can be no other then the Cornerstone here
mentioned; to wit, Christ Jesus God and man. Are not the Apostles then true
foundations of this building? or will not Saint John's words. Rev. 21. 14. infer
thus much? And the wall of the City had twelve foundations, and in them the
twelve Apostles of the Lamb. Surely neither his words, nor the circumstance of
the place, will conclude that the twelve Apostles were the twelve Foundations;
but only that their names were inscribed in them. So were not, for ought we
read, the names of the Prophets; nor can it be concluded, that St John did mean
the self same thing, by the twelve foundations, that Saint Paul here does by
the foundation of the Prophets and the Apostles. Saint John describes the new
Jerusalem, as a City lying four square, with twelve Gates. Three on the East,
and three on the North, three on the South, and three on the West, bearing the
Inscription of the twelve Tribes of Israel: And having twelve Gates, it must
needs have twelve foundations, that is, the whole Foundation is divided into
twelve parts. The Apostles were in no other sense the twelve foundations, than
the twelve Tribes of Israel were the twelve Gates. Yet foundations the Apostles
might be said of this City, in such a sense as Hesychius says, Saint Andrew
was of Saint Peter, because he brought him to Christ. Thus the whole Christian
world, was by the Apostles, brought unto Christ as to the only sure foundation,
which God had promised to lay in Sion, or (as the Hebraism imports) on which,
or in which. God had promised to build up Sion, that is (in Saint John's
language) the new Jerusalem. Christ then was the chief Cornerstone, on which
the Prophet foretold Sion should be Re-erected; the foundation on which the
Apostles themselves were laid: and we should no way swerve from the meaning of
Saint Paul, if by the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, we neither
understand their persons nor their Doctrine, or neither of these only or
especially, but the self same foundation upon which the Prophets and Apostles
were built, by whose virtue they grew to be living stones of this edifice: For
other foundation then this Cornerstone can no man lay; nor did Christ himself
build upon any other foundation then upon himself. He is the only Foundation,
whether of the Apostles persons or Doctrine. I am the bolder to Commend this
Interpretation unto you, because I see it ingenuously acknowledged by a late
Learned Anton. Fernand. Conimb. visiones vet. Test. vis. 2. Cap. 28. Genesis fol.
83. Sect. 6. number. 9. And Benedictus Ferdinandius Borb. Lusit. in his 2d Tom. of
Comments, upon Genesis Cap. 28. Sect. 2. Number. 8. Fol. 568. says, Romans Ecclesia --
est Turris -- fundatur in Petri confessione at que in Domini promissiore --.And
a little after he cites S. Athanasius (Lib. 2. De Trin.) Optime S. Athanasius;
Unum hoc est immobile fundamentum, una haec est felix fidei petra Petriore
Confessae, Tues Filius Dei vivi, etc.
Jesuit, who (I think) learned it of Thomas Aquinas. Superaedificati supra
fundamentum Apostolorum; id est, Christum, qui est Fundamentum Apostolorum.

3. But in what sense is Christ said to be the chief Cornerstone? In the The
2d Point
interpretation of the Original word, I find the Diversity to be greater then
the real difference. Some translate the Original [(...)] Summo angulari lapide,
the highest or supreme Cornerstone, which couples or binds the Building. Beza
will have it [imo angulari lapide,] the lowest stone in the corner, which we
call, the Foundation Stone; and which in Buildings (especially consecrated to
sacred use) is commonly laid with great Solemnity, and by the hands of some
principal man, or public Officer. And Beza well observes, that the Greek
(...), which is the epithet or title of the Cornerstone Beza's Observation.
here in the Text, does signify both extremes of any dimension, as well the
lowest, as the highest; and he gives this good Caveat withal, that we are not
to press this comparison of Christ to a Cornerstone too far; no further than
our Apostle meant it: which was, the joining of two walls together, which before
had been distant, and unsociable; to wit, the Jew and the Gentile.

Now in every complete building, there must be more then two walls, four at
the least, and therefore four Corner-stones, four imi angulares lapides, four
Foundation-stones, and four Summi angulares lapides, that is, four Supreme, or
binding Corner-stones; and all these corner-stones are said to be the chief in
the building. It is evident, that Christ is the First foundation-stone, and yet
may it not be denied that he is also the chief Cornerstone which binds the
building. For in this sense must that of the Psalmist, Psalm. 118. 22. be
understood: The Stone which the Builders refused is become the Head-Stone of
the corner. For if we respect the literal sense of this Prophecy, or the
ground of the metaphor, the lowest or foundation stone, being once refused by
the builders, cannot by the same builders be laid in the foundation again,
unless they will pull down what they have built: But whilst the foundation is
in laying, a stone may be rejected, or laid aside by the builders, as not so
fitting to be laid in the Foundation (or to be any intermediate part of the
edifice erected) and yet may come to be the fittest Stone for coupling or
binding the building; that is, to be the supreme Cornerstone. The Author of
the Scholastic History has a Tradition, for whose authority he (perhaps)
could have produced better Warrant, then we can take from him, that in the
building of the second Temple (at whose consecration, in all probability, this
118. Psalm was conceived) there was a peculiar Stone often laid aside by the
builders, as unfitting (in their judgment) to become any part of the
foundation or intermediate building, which yet afterward proved the fittest
Cornerstone for binding or coupling together the walls erected. And the
extraordinary unexpected fitness of this stone, to finish that building, for
whose erection it was continually held unfit, did minister hint or occasion
unto the Psalmist to say, This is the Lords doing, and it is mavelous in our
eyes.

But leaving the truth or probability of this Tradition to the search of
Antiquaries or Critics, the literal or emblematicall sense which the author
makes of the Psalmist, does well suit with the allegorical and mystical, which
the Apostles S. Paul here, and S. Peter, Act. 4. 11. from our Saviors mouth,
have made of the Psalmists parabolicall speech. For thus our Savior Christ
(whom God had presented and commended to the Master builders of his Temple,
that is, to the Priests the Scribes and Pharisees, to the elders and chief
rulers of the Synagogue, in the days of his humiliation here on earth,) was by
them rejected, scoffed and spurned at, and lastly buried in the earth, as
altogether useless and unfit for Building. And yet, after his resurrection, He
became not only imus, but summus angularis lapis, not only the first firm
Cornerstone or supporter, but the chief and supreme Cornerstone too; as well
the finishing as the Foundation of this spiritual Temple not made with hands.
That Christ himself is both the Foundation and finisher, that is, both the
highest perfection and lowest foundation in this building, his own
interpretation of the Psalmists words, Matthew. 21. 42, 44. will necessarily
infer. Did you never read (says he) in the Scriptures, The stone which the
Builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner; this is the Lords
doing, and it is mavelous in our eyes? And whosoever shall fall on this Stone
shall be broken: but on whom soever it shall fall it shall grind him to powder.
Fall upon this cornerstone they could not, but as it was the lowest in the
building. Their fall upon it could not be so grievous as to break their limbs,
unless it had been laid deeper or lower then ordinary foundations or
corner-stones are usually laid. And the mystical sense of our Saviors words
is, that such as spurned and stumbled at him, in his humility, should as it
were break their limbs; But that this stone should fall upon any, this in the
literal sense supposes, that it should be higher than they were, so high
placed in this building, that the fall of it should not bruise or break their
limbs, but grind their bones to powder. And thus was the Jewish nation broken
or cut off from being Gods people for their contempt of Christ in his
humility. And not only they, but all such as continue the like contempt of
his passion and resurrection, shall by his second coming (to Judgment) in
glory, be ground to powder; that is, the pains of their first breaking by
falling upon this cornerstone shall be multiplied without end or measure.

To conclude this second Point; Christ is both Lapis summus angularis, lapis
imus, primus and latissimus angularis, as Pineda says in Chap. 38. Job. verse.
6. The highest and the lowest cornerstone in this building, the center and
Pineda on Chapter 38. Job. verse. 6.
circumference, the whole strength of this city and the walls about it; so
says the Prophet Esaias. 26. 1. We have a strong city, salvation will God
appoint for walls, and bulwarks. Open ye the gates that the righteous Nation,
which keeps the truth, may enter in. And again ver. 4. Trust ye in the Lord
for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength, or (as the Hebrew)
the rock of ages. As this Spiritual temple in the Text, is a Temple not made
with hands, (for God dwells not in such Temples. Act. 7. 48. Heb. 9. 11, 24.)
So Christ, who is the chief cornerstone of it, is that stone, which
Nebuchadnezzar saw in visions by night, Dan. 2. verse. 34. A stone not cut out
of any quarrie by hands, yet a stone, which smote the Image upon the feet,
which were of Iron and clay, and broke not them only, but the whole Image,
as well the brass, the Gold and Silver, as the iron and clay unto pieces. And
afterward became a great mountain, which filled the whole earth. But how or
when this stone became a great mountain, or in what manner we are said to grow
into an holy temple, will better appear in discussing the third Point proposed,
which was, Concerning the manner how these Ephesians or others are said to be
built upon the foundation of the Prophets and the Apostles, and upon Jesus
Christ the chief Cornerstone; and how they grow into an Holy Temple.

4. When the Prophet says that the stone cut without hands did become a Great
Mountain, he supposes, that it should be a living stone. And The 3. Point.
propounded Paragr. 2.
when our Apostle here says that the whole building does grow unto an holy
temple, it is included, that every part of this temple should be a living
stone. For growth, (such growth as the Apostle speaks of) is an effect of
life. Things inanimate or without life, as material buildings, stones of the
quarrie, or any heap or congest, may become greater by addition of matter unto
them: they cannot Grow unto greatness, as wanting the faculty of vegetation
or Nutrition. That only is capable of growth, which is capable of nutrition,
and nothing is capable of nutrition, but that which is endowed with life. Hence
says S. Peter 1. Ep. cap. 2. verse. 2. etc. As new born babes desire the
Sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby, if so be ye have tasted
that the Lord is gracious. The Growth then of every Christian, is more than the
Growth of vegetables; for it includes the sense of taste, we must taste the
graciousnesse of the Lord by faith, and we must come unto him by faith, as
unto a Living stone, disallowed of men, but chosen of God and pretaious, and
coming thus unto him, As the Apostle adds, verse. 5. we also become lively
stones, and are built up a spiritual house, an holy Priesthood to offer up
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. S. Peter's
inference in that place verse. 6, 7, etc. is the very same with our Apostle S.
Paul's in this place; and so is the Use or Application of it the very same with
that, which our Apostle makes in the later end of this Epistle. But of the Use
hereafter.

It will in the mean time be very Useful for us to observe, That neither S.
Paul, nor S. Peter, when they purposely handled the building of the Gentiles
upon this chief Cornerstone, do mention or intimate any other Foundation, on
which we are to be builded, before we be builded on Christ: Neither of them
taught us to rely on themselves, or on their personal faith, or their
successors Authority, as upon secondary foundations, by Union with whom (or
relying upon whom) we might be grounded upon the Prime Foundation, which is
Christ. If this they had taught us, they had taught us not to believe as they
believed, and not believing as they believed, we could not possibly become such
live stones of this spiritual edifice as they were.

5. But if we must believe as S. Peter believed, must we not believe as the
Church believes? yes! All that hope to be saved must believe as the true Church
believes; and they only are the true Church which believe as S. Peter
believed. The Question is, Who they be that believe as S. Peter believed? These
(we say) are the members of Reformed Churches, or the Reformed Churches
themselves. No member of the Romish Church can possibly believe as S. Peter did
unless they will abandon the absolute infallibility of the visible Romish
Church. For every one which believes as S. Peter did, must have the same Object
of Faith which S. Peter had. He may not believe any Article of faith which S.
Peter did not believe: he may not seek, he cannot hope to be built on the same
Foundation on which Peter was built, by relying upon any Authority See Book 3.
Chap. 7. 8. A Discourse about, Thou art Peter, etc.
upon which Peter himself did not rely. The manner of his union unto this
Foundation must be the same that Peter's was, as immediate as Peter's Union was.
What then was the proper Object of Peter's faith? What was the Fundamental Rock
on which Peter was by this faith immediately built? That was only Christ, the
Son of man, and the Son of the living God: And the Branches which naturally
issue out of this Root (or living Rock) are: That Christ the Son of the living
God, the Son of God the Father, was Conceived by the Holy Ghost, was Born of
the Virgin Mary, did suffer under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified, dead, and
buried, etc. Did S. Peter believe all or any of these Articles by believing his
own Authority? Was he founded on Christ by the intermediation, or
interposition of any other secondarie foundation? Was he the foundation or Rock
on which himself was built? If we cannot believe these Articles, but by
believing S. Peter or his personal faith, to be the Rock on which the Church is
built, then Peter, or his personal faith, must be to us as a second foundation.
We cannot be united to Christ, we cannot be builded on Christ, unless we be
first united unto, and builded on Peter. But Peter was not builded upon
himself, or upon his own faith; wherefore if we be builded upon Peter or upon
Peter's faith, we have not the same Object of faith, nor the same faith which
Peter had; for neither Peter's person, nor his faith, were any part of the
Object of his Faith. His Authority was no means of his Union with Christ.

6. That the Object of Faith must be formally the very Same in all true
Believers, the present Romish Church (if this were the Question between her and
us) could not deny. Her greatest Clerks do expressly teach and maintain it as
a principle of true Divinity. And maintaining this truth, they must confess
(unless they will contradict themselves) that we must be as immediately united
to Christ by Faith, as Peter was; we must be as immediately builded on Christ
by this faith, as Peter was; we must not be built on him, by being built upon
Petes Faith, or upon his successors Infallible Authority. For so we should
have another Object or Article of faith than Peter had, or his successors have:
We should have another foundation then Pete had, as many more foundations as
Peter has successors. Our Union with them should be a part of our Union with
Christ; Our Belief of their Infallible Authority, should be the chief Bond of
this Union, such a bond or stay of our edification upon Christ as the stones or
cement in a material building, is, between the lowest foundation, and the
intermediate Rows of stone which are laid one upon another until the highest
Row be finished. And to be thus united unto Christ, were to make him no living
stone, which diffuseth life unto all that are built upon him; but a dead stone,
or a stone only able to support the material or dead weight which is laid upon
it; there should be no growth in faith, but an addition, or cementing of one
part unto another, until the edifice were finished. Whereas our Apostles words
are express, that all the building is fitly framed together in Christ, and so
framed grows up unto an holy Temple in the Lord. He says not, we are builded
one upon another, but builded together in Him for an habitation of God through
the Spirit. This Spirit by which we are builded together in Christ, or through
which we become the habitation of God, is not communicated and propagated unto
us from S. Peter, and his Successors, as from intermediate Foundations or
Roots. We, and all true believers, receive the influence of the Spirit, as
immediately from Christ, or from God the Father and the Son, in the same manner
as Saint Peter did, though not in the same measure. But the Difference of the
measure in which we receive it, or the difference of our growth in Christ, does
not argue a different manner either of our receiving it, or of growth by it.

7. But is this the worst Practice of the Romish Church, that she adds one
Article more unto our Creed, than Saint Peter knew, or taught others to
believe; or that she makes Peter's successors to have a Foundation which he had
not? If thus she did, and no more, this were enough to convince her of Gross
Heresy. But this one Article of faith, or this second foundation of faith
which she pretends, is of such a transcendent nature, that it devours all the
rest; and does, if not overthrow the First foundation of our faith, yet, which
is all one, it draws us from it. For as many successions as there be of Popes,
or of Peter's pretended successors, so many several foundations there be of
their faith, which successively adhere unto them. Nor are these several or
successive foundations either immediately cemented, or firmly united to the
first Foundation, which is Christ, or one to another: They are as so many Rows
or Piles of stone laid one upon another without any juncture or binding, than
loose sand. And all that absolutely unite themselves to the present Romish
Church, that is, to Peter's pretended successors, must of necessity fall off
from the First Foundation, Christ God and man, and flote with these secondarie
foundations, to wit, Peter's succcessors, when the floods of temptations do
arise.

The point then to be proved is this, That the present Romish Church, to wit,
the present Pope, or such as rely upon him, as a second or intermediate
foundation in this structure, cannot possibly be built upon the foundation of
the Apostles and Prophets, they cannot grow up together as living stones firmly
united in Christ Jesus, as in the Cornerstone. Now the proof of this Point is
clear, because none can be built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and the
Apostles, unless they absolutely believe, as they believed, and firmly
acknowledge that which they have commended unto us in their writings to have
been delivered unto them by God himself; for so they expressly teach us to
believe. Believing then as they believed, we must believe, that albeit the
Apostles and Prophets be not the Foundation here meant in the Text, yet, that
they were Master Builders appointed by God for squaring and fitting all that
lived with them, or that succeeded them, for this foundation; and that the Rule
by which, as well the Pastors and Teachers, as the people taught by them, must
be fitted and squared for this foundation, is the doctrine of faith contained
in their Writings. Both these parts of truth, to wit, that the Books of the Old
and New Testament are their Writings or Dictates, and that in these Writings
the Doctrine, or Rule of Faith is contained, must be absolutely believed, and
taken for unquestionable, before any modern pastors in the Church, can be
framed or fashioned to be true stones in this building. But no man which
absolutely believes the present Romish Church, can have any absolute belief,
that the Old and New Testament, or the Writings of the Apostles and Prophets
are infallibly true or contain the Word of God. The best belief that any
Romanist can have is but Conditional, and the Condition is this, If the present
Romish Church (to wit, the Pope, and such as rely upon his authority) be
absolutely infallible, and cannot err in matter of faith.

But it will be Replied; In as much as the Roman Catholics take it as a
Principle most unquestionable, that their Church cannot err, they for this
reason must believe the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Christ
to be infallible, and the books of the Old and New Testament to conteyne the
word of God, because the Church their Mother, which they firmly believe cannot
err, does tell them so; or, (as their own writers speak) because the Church
their mother does Canonize these books for the books of God. This indeed is
the chief advantage, which they Presume their Lay People have of ours, in that
they believe the Churches testimony concerning the books of God to be
infallible, and if they believe the Church to be in this point infallible, they
cannot doubt but that these books are the word of God.

But if we look more narrowly into this mystery of iniquity, and take their
full meaning with us, it will further appear, that this absolute belief of this
present Churches absolute infallibilite does overthrow or undermine the whole
frame of faith. For they extend this supposed infallibility of the Romish
Church so far, and make the belief of it so necessary, that without this
fundamental principle (as they say) we cannot infallibly believe or know the
books of the, Old and New Testament, to contain in them the word of God. And
in avouching this, it is evident that they leave both the Authority of the
Apostolical and Prophetical writings, and the Authority of the Present Church,
altogether uncertain, so uncertain, that nothing avouched by either of them
can be (by their doctrine) so certain, as to become any Foundation of their
faith. If we cannot infallibly believe the books of the Old and New Testament
to be the books of God himself, and of divine Authority, otherwise then by
believing the present Romish Church to be infallible, let them tell us how they
can possibly believe or prove, that the Romish Church, or any other
Congregation of men, has any such infallible authority. This authority must
be either believed, or known by light of nature, or by Divine Testimony, or
Revelation. That the infallibility of their Church can be known by light of
Nature, they do not, they dare not say. For that Peter, on whom that Church (as
they pretend) is founded, was an Apostle of Christ, cannot be known by light of
Nature, or by sense; it cannot be infallibly believed, but by Divine
Authority, Revelation, or Testimony. By what Divine Testimony then do they
know that Peter was an Apostle, or that the Church was to be builded on him, or
on his successors? You know they pretend that place of S. Matthew Chap. 16. 18.
Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church: and that of S. Luke,
Chap. 22. 32. I have prayed for thee that thy faith shall not fail; And yet
they deny, that we can possibly know these words to be the words of God, or to
have any such meaning as they make of them, unless we will believe the
Churches Authority, in avouching them to be the words of God, and her
interpretation of them to be infallible.

But leaving them wandering in this Round or Circle, as we found them long ago,
let us further consider the manner how we are built upon Christ Book 2. chapter 30
Valentian his Enchanted Circle.
the Chief Cornerstone, and how we must grow unto an holy Temple in the Lord.

9. Christ (as you heard before) is not the Cornerstone or Foundation only,
but the Temple of God: A Greater and more spacious Temple, then all the
building which is erected upon him, which grows up in him. We must be living
stones, we must be Pillars in the house of God, we must be Temples of God; that
is, an habitation of God through the Spirit; but no Foundations, no chief
corner-stones, these are Christ's prerogatives; Behold I have graven thee (to
wit, the Spiritual Sion, says the Prophet, Isa. 49. 16.) upon the palms of my
hands, thy walls are continually before me: that is, as a late Interpreter of
the Romish Church says, I have pitched thy Anton. Fernand.
foundations in my hands by the wounds which I received in them. By whose
diduction or rent, a place was opened for this future edifice to be erected in
him. And for this cause Christ (who is the Rock) was every way dug into, in
his side, in his hands, in his feet. The mystery whereof is, that he might
exhibit a firm foundation out of which the fabric of the Church should grow.
That we then become living stones in this edifice, it is from our immediate
Union with this chief cornerstone; being united to him, he is fashioned in us:
and by him fashioned in us, we become living stones, growing stones: we grow
from living stones to living pillars, from living pillars to living Temples, or
habitations for our God. That the children of God are not only living stones,
but from living stones grow into pillars, our Savior himself has taught us
by S. John. Rev. 3. 12. Him that overcomes will I make A Pillar in the temple
of my God, and he shall go no more out; and if we be pillars in the temple of
God, we must be as immediately placed on the foundation or chief cornerstone
as S. Peter or Christ's other Apostles were: We must be as entire Temples as
they were. And for this reason, our Savior adds, upon every one whom he makes
a pillar, the name of God and the name of the City of God the new Jerusalem
which comes out of Heaven. Know ye not, says S. Paul, 1 Cor. 6. 19. That your
body is the temple of the Holy Ghost? As we say, the Kings presence makes the
Court; So it is Gods Holy Spirits extraordinary presence in man which makes him
his Temple. And the Reason why Christ is called The Temple of God, is because
the Godhead dwells in him bodily. And for the like reason every one in whom
Christ dwells by faith, is, in a participated sense, called, The Temple of
God. And as visible Cities consist of several houses, and as the beauty of
every City consists in the Uniformitie of houses well built and joined
together, so the heavenly Jerusalem consists of several Temples, whose beauty
or Uniformitie consists in this, that Christ Jesus is the life and light of
every several Temple, and that his spirit is uniformely diffused through all.

10. Christ (as you have read before) Communicates his Titles unto his Saints,
but not the Real Prerogative of his Titles. He is The Rock, so was Peter a
rock, so are we rocks, but not The rock on which the Church is built. He is
the Chief Cornerstone, we are living stones; he is the temple and the Priest
of the most high God; and he makes us both temples and Priests unto his God. So
says S. Peter. 1. Ep. cap. 2. verse. 5. Ye all as lively stones are built up a
spiritual house, an holy Priesthood to offer up Spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. The Model of this spiritual Temple
and Priesthood (that is, of the new Jerusalem, and the service of God
performed in it) was exhibited by Moses Exodus 24. 4, 5. at the making of the
first covenant. Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in
the morning, and builded an altar under the Hill, and twelve pillars according
to the 12. tribes of Israel. And he sent yong-men of the Children of Israel,
which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of Oxen unto the
Lord. Immediately, after this, Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, saw the God of
Israel: and there was under his feet, as it were a paved work of a sapphire
stone, and as it were the body of Heaven in his clearness, ver. 9. The young
men which he sent to offer sacrifices (as the best interpreters observe) were
the firstborn of their families. For till that time, and at that time, which
was before the consecration of Aaron and his sons, it was Lawful for the
First born male of every family to execute the office of the Priest; This was
his duty. So that every family was as a little Parish Church, and had his
Priest, to perform this service of God. Now though all that are built upon the
Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, are not admitted to be Architects or
master builders, though all be not public teachers or pastors; yet all that
are, or hope to be parts of this building, have the same Prerogative which the
Firstborn males of Israel had before Aaron was consecrated; All must be
Priests to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices unto God. But seeing we must grow
unto an holy temple; and growth (as was said before) supposes nutrition, let
us now see what is the nourishment by which we must grow from living stones to
be living pillars, from pillars to be living Temples, yea Kings and Priests
unto our God.

11. The nature and quality of the Nutriment by which we must grow, cannot in
fewer words be more pithily expressed, than it is by S. Peter, 1 Pet. 2. cap.
verse. 2. It is the sincere milk of the word: But how good soever the nutriment
be, it does not kindly nourish unless we have an appetite to it; Therefore
the same Apostle adds, (...), desire, or long after, the sincere milk of the
word. We must then desire to have the word dwell in us plentifully, and we
must desire to have it sincere, that is, pure and unmingled. Now this milk may
become unsincere or mingled, sometimes by the default of the Pastor or teacher,
sometimes by the default of the hearers. The duty which concerns us teachers
is, that we do not mingle the word, with the Traditions of men, how ancient
soever they be. This is the fault of the Romish Church, which the Church our
mother has sufficiently prevented by public edicts or decrees. But many
otherwise averse enough from Traditions of the Romish or other ancient Church,
ofttimes corrupt it with their own Conceits or Phansies, which will easily
mingle themselves with the word, unless we speak out of premeditation, and
have both art and leisure to revise and examine, as well our own meditations, as
the meditations or expositions of others whose help we use. Since the ordinary
Gifts of the Spirit did cease, there is no faculty under the sun which more
requires the help of art and study than the exposition of Scriptures does. It
requires a greater skill then the skill of Alchymie, to extract the true sense
and meaning of the holy Ghost, from the plausible glosses or expositions which
are daily made upon them. But how sincerely soever the word may be delivered by
the Pastor, it may be corrupted by the hearer. Milk (as Physicians tell us) is
turned into purer blood with greater facility, than any other nutriment, so
the body which receives it, be free from humors; but if the stomach or other
vital parts, be stuffed with Phlegm, oppressed with Choler, or other corruption,
there is no nutriment which is more easily corrupted, or more apt to feed bad
humors than milk, how pure soever it be. Thus though the sincere milk of the
word be not only the best, but the only nutriment of souls, by which we must
grow up in faith: yet if the heart which receives it from the preachers mouth,
sincere, be pestered with corrupt affections, it does not nourish; if it do not
purge or purify the corrupt humors but mingle with them, they malignifie one
another. The special humors, which on the hearers part, corrupt the sincere
milk of the word, and of which every one that will be a diligent hearer, must
endeavor to purge his soul by repentance, are set down by S. Peter in the
same Chapter, verse. 1. Wherefore laying aside all malice, all guile, and all
hypocrisy, and envies, and evill-speakings, as new born babes desire the
sincere milk of the word. We must first, (then) desire the word as Physic to
purge our souls: That part of the word I mean, which teaches Repentance, and
denial of all ungodliness, before we can hope to grow by the milk of it, that
is, by the comfort of Gods promises. Unless our hearts be, in good measure
purified, by obedience to the General precepts, or moral duties; how sincere
soever the milk of the word preached be, our desire of it cannot be sincere;
we shall desire it, or delight in it, to maintain Faction, or secret pride,
not to grow up thereby in sincerity of mind and humbleness of spirit, which
are the most proper effects of the milk of the word sincerely delivered and
sincerely received.

SECT. II. Of Christ's Lordship or Dominion.
Phil. 2. 11. That every Tongue should Confess, that Jesus Christ is LORD, to
the Glory of God the Father. Acts 2. 36. Let all the House of Israel know
assuredly, that God has made that same Jesus whom ye Crucified, both Lord, and
Christ. Rev. 5. 13. Every Creature in heaven, and earth, and sea, did say,
Blessing, Honor, Glory and Power, to Him that sits on the Throne, and to
The Lamb for ever and ever.
The Degrees, or Steps by which we must ascend before we enter this Beautiful
Gate of the Lords House, are Three,

First, What it is to be a LORD.

Second, Upon what Grounds, or in what respects, Christ is, by peculiar Title,
called THE LORD.

Third, How our Confession or acknowledgment of Christ to be The Lord, does
redound to the Glory of God the Father.

CHAP. VI. What it is to be a Lord. Though there be many called Lords, yet is
there but One Absolute Lord.
1. THe Title of Lord, whether we take it in the Greek, in the Latin, or in our
English, is sometimes a Title only of Respect or courtesy: So strangers
usually salute men of place or note, by the name of Dominus, or sometimes of
Domination it self. And we usually instile the Eldest Sons of Earls by the
title of Lords; And all the Sons of Dukes, even from their Cradles are so
instiled. Not to vouchsafe them this Title, when we mention them, were ill
manners or discourtesie. Howbeit, even they which are bound to love them best,
the very parents of their bodies, do not permit them to enjoy the Realities
answering to these honorable Titles, before their full age; and for the most
part till they themselves have surrendered them by death. The Realitie answering
to this title of Lord is Dominion. Every one that has Dominion is a Lord, in
respect of that over which he has Dominion; and whosoever really is a Lord, is
so instiled from some Dominion, which he exercises. Dominus in Latin sometimes
goes for no more then our English word [Owner:] and this is the lowest or
meanest signification of the word, Lord. The full Extent or highest value of
the word Dominus, or Lord, must be gathered from the several degrees, or scale
of Dominion; as either from the Extent of the matter or subject over which
Dominion is exercised, or from the Soveraigntie of Title. Dominion, as Lawyers
define it, is A Faculty or power, fully to dispose of any corporal or bodily
substance, so far as they are not restrained by law. And by how much a man's
power to dispose of what he has, is less restrained by law, by so much his
Dominion over it is the greater; and he, in respect of it, is, if not so much a
greater Lord, yet so much more properly a Lord. But fitting it is, in regard of
public good, or of posterity, that most men's power to dispose of that, which
otherwise by full right is their own, should be in certain Cases restrained.
Many are Lords of great Lands, and may dispose of their annual profits as they
please; but yet cannot sell, or alienate their perpetual inheritance.

Others have a more full power to dispose of the houses wherein they dwell, a
power not only to let or set them for years, but to sell or give away the
perpetual inheritance; who yet are by Law restrained utterly to demolish or set
them on fire, especially if they be enclosed by neighbor Lodgings. The Cases
are many, wherein Dominuim sub altiore dominio est. There is a sub ordination
of Lordships or Dominions; some are Mean Lords, some are Chief Lords. Even
meaner Lords or owners are not to be denied the titles of Lords, albeit they
cannot alienate the soil, whereof they are owners, without license of the Chief
Lord; much more are chief or higher Lords to be so reputed, because their
Dominion or power to dispose of their own Lands is less subordinate; howbeit
in some cases limited by the Rule of Law. And this restraint, in how few cases
soever it be, hinders their greatness from growing into absolute Dominion:
Lords they are, but not absolute Lords. This is a Title peculiar to Kings or
Monarchs, who are so called only in respect of their own subjects, or of their
own Lands. No mere mortal man since Adam was Lord of the whole earth, or bare
soveraigntie over all men or bodily substances. And the greatest of men have
been subject or inferior to Angels.

2. To leave other divisions of Dominion to Lawyers; All Dominion is either,
Jurisdictionis or Proprietatis; A power of Jurisdiction, or a right to the
Property. The former branch of Dominion, is exercised only over men or
reasonable creatures, which only are capable of Jurisdiction passive, or of
Government. The later branch, which we call Dominion of property, for the most
part respects things corporal. Howbeit, even men or reasonable creatures are
sometimes subject to both Branches of Dominion, but in different measure,
according to the several rites or customs of diverse ages, nations, or
people. Such as the Latins call Servi or Servuli, slaves (or servants properly
so called) were in bonis Domini; they were the goods or possession of their
Masters. These bodily Lords had not only Dominion of Jurisdiction over, See
Book 8. Chapter 7. And Book 10. Chap. 15, 16.
but Dominion of property, to their persons. No law did restrain their Masters
from disposing of these servants as they pleased; as either to exchange, give
away or sell, them and their children. The poor servants did oftentimes mutare
dominum, non servitutem, change their Lords, without any exchange or alteration
of their slaverie. Sometimes the Romans had, and some other nations at this day
have, Dominium vitae and necis, power or dominion to kill, maim or wound their
servants without any restraint or control of law. But this absolute power to
dispose of their slaves or servants was afterward by the Roman Law inhibited.
Lords and Masters of private servants were liable to the sentence of public
Law, if they did use intolerable cruelty or severitie toward their slaves.
But, by the Laws or most Christian nations, this absolute Dominion of Lords
over their servants, (and consequently this kind of subjection and slaverie) is
taken away. For every Christian is an Israelite or Hebrew, and somewhat more.
All are in reputation the Sons of Abraham. Now the positive Law of God, before
our Saviors time, did exempt the Sons of Abraham by the free woman from
slaverie. The Kings of Judah might not make bondmen of their brethren the Sons
of Jacob.

3. Albeit we retein the name of Masters and Servants, yet neither are the one
sort properly called Domini, nor the other Servi. A master with us is no more
then Pater familias amongst the Latins; and those whom we call servants, are
famuli. Every Father of a family has Dominium Jurisdictionis, a right or
power of Jurisdiction over his family, but not Dominium proprietatis, not
right, or power of property in their persons. Howbeit, even this power or
Dominion of Jurisdiction is limited, as well by the Laws of God, as of man. No
father of his family may correct any of his family as he pleases, but in such
cases, and so far as the Law will permit; And according to the different
condition of the parties, over whom the Father of the family has this power
of Jurisdiction or correction, must the exercise of it be always tempered: No
husband or Master of a family may exercise the same power over his wife, which
he does over his children. No man by the Law of nature ought to use his
children, as his servants, or apprentices; unless they be such by estate or
condition of life. Nor can a Master of a family, which is of a more ingenuous
or generous profession, put his servants or apprentices, which are of the same
profession, upon such services, as a Master of some inferior trade or
profession may put his servants to. A Merchant may not employ an apprentice to
that profession, in such works and services, as are proper to, and well
befitting a Tinker or Cobbler, or some other inferior crafts-man, or day
labourer. Howbeit, every Master of an apprentice or hired servant has a right
or power, not only of Jurisdiction or of government, but of property, though
not over his servants body or person, yet over his bodily labors or
employments. Apprentices or servants, which are as free born, and of parentage
as good, perhaps better, then their Masters, have no power to dispose of their
own Labors or employments, but must herein follow their Masters directions and
appointment; and in case they alienate their industry from their Masters
service, though to their own profit, without his leave, they are subject to
his power or Jurisdiction; he may authoritatively admonish, chastise, or
otherwise require satisfaction for wronging him by mis-expense of time, or in
that power or interest which he has by Covenant in their labors or
employments. Yet may not any master of a family punish a servant as he
pleases, or as his passion shall suggest, but so far only as the Law shall
permit: For every master of a private family is under the power or Dominion of
the public Magistrate, and subject, if he be a Christian, to Ecclesiastic
Censure, in case he transgress the manner or measure of the punishment, which
the Law of God or of man does permit him to exercise only within his family.
Nor may any Master exact those services or bodily employments of his servants
or apprentices at all times, or upon all days, which at sometimes, or upon
most days, he may. If a servant should refuse to labor in his ordinary
vocation upon the Lords day, though commanded so to do by his Master, the
Master has no lawful power of Jurisdiction over him, no power to chastise him
for such refusal; because the Masters right or power to dispose either of his
own, or of his servants employments, for that day, is inhibited by the Law of
God, and of his Church, which has Dominion of Jurisdiction in those Cases over
Masters.

4. The issue of these Generalities concerning Lordship or dominion, is this.
Though there be many which are called Lords and Masters, (and many there be
which really and indeed are such) yet is there in truth, but One Absolute Lord,
whether we speak of the Lordship or Dominion of propriety, or of Jurisdiction,
and that is God. For by right or title of Creation he has more absolute power
over all his creatures, then any creature, then absolute Kings and Monarchs (as
we call them) then any chief Lord has over his Lands or Goods, over any thing
which they can call theirs; whether by gift, purchase, or inheritance. For
whatsoever by these, or any other means is theirs, as money, goods, or any
other bodily substance, they did not make any parcel or matter of the substance
of it, but only acquired a right or title to it being made. As they cannot
create or make any thing out of nothing, so can they not utterly destroy or
annihilate any thing created or made. The height of all created Power is only
to amend or mar the fashion of things, and this is but permitted; yea even
the permission it self presupposed, this power is still subordinate in the
exercise of it, to an higher power. But God does found his right of Dominion
over all things, or his power to dispose of them and of their appurtenances, in
their very radical Being. This is his sole Gift. Nor is His power or dominion
only more Sovereign, or intensively greater over the most noble bodily
substance that is, then any creature can have over the least thing that is; but
it extends also unto those substances, which are not subject to man, or any
creatures dominion. He has a more Sovereign Title of dominion over the souls
and spirits of Kings and Monarchs, over the blessed Angels under whose
Guardianship the greatest Monarchs are, then they have over their meanest
Vassals.

So that His dominion extends beyond the definition given by Lawyers, which
comprehends only things corporal, but meddles not with celestial substances,
or spiritual, as Angels, which are not subject to the Jurisdiction of Princes,
nor can they be imprisoned in their coffers. Men, as they could not make
themselves, so neither can they by their valor, wit, or industry, gain or
create a title to any thing, which is not Gods, and whereof he is not Absolute
Lord before and after they come to be Lords, and owners subordinate of it. They
cannot move their bodies, nor employ their minds, but by his free donation; nor
can they enjoy his freest gifts, but by his concurse or Cooperation. He has a
Dominion of property over their souls, yea an absolute dominion, not of
property only, but of uncontrollable jurisdiction over their very thoughts, as
it is employed, Deuteronomy. 8. 17, 18. He does not only give us the substance, which
we are enabled to get, but gives us the very power, wit, and strength, to get
or gather it; Not this power only, whereby we gather substance, but our very
Being, which supports this power, is his gift; and unless our Being be
supported and strengthened hy his power sustentative, we cannot so much as think
of gathering wealth or getting necessaries, much less can we dispose of our own
endeavors for accomplishing our hopes, desires, or thoughts. To conclude then,
All we have, even we our selves are, Gods by absolute Dominion, as well of
property as of Jurisdiction. There is no Law in heaven or earth, that can
inhibit or restrain his absolute Power to dispose of all things as he
pleases; for he works all things by the Counsel of his Will, and He only is
Absolute Lord.

But absolute Lordship or Dominion, how far soever extended, though over
Angels, Powers, and Principalites, from this ground or universal Title of
Creation, is entirely, jointly, and indivisibly common to the Blessed Trinity.
For so S. Athanasius teacheh us; the Father is LORD, the Son is LORD, and the
Holy Ghost is LORD, (absolute Lord, as well in respect of Dominion, as of
Jurisdiction) and yet not three Lords, but one Lord; and if but One Lord, then
the Lordship or dominion is One and the same, alike absolute either for
intensive Perfection, or Extension, in the Son as in the Father, in the Holy
Ghost as in the Son. Yet is it well observed by a judicious Commentator upon S.
Paul's Epistles, that to be LORD is the proper Title or Epitheton (in S. Paul's
Language) of Christ the Son of God both God and Man, and Emphatically ascribed
to him even in those passages, wherein he had occasion expressly to mention
the distinction of Persons in the Trinity. As where he says, The Grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God (he does not say, of God the Lord) and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, (without addition of this title of Lord,) be
with you all. And so in our Apostles Creed we profess to Believe in God the
Father Almighty, without addition of the title [LORD;] and so in God the Holy
Ghost, not in the Lord the Holy Ghost, but in Christ our Lord. Which leads to
the Second Point proposed in the Entrance to this Second Section.

CHAP. VII. In what respects, or upon what grounds Christ is by peculiar Title
called The Lord. And First, of the Title it self. Secondly, Of the Real grounds
unto this Title.
1. COncerning the name of Lord, there is no verbal difference in the Greek, or
Latin, whether this name or Title be attributed to God the Father (as often it
is) or to God the Holy Ghost, unto the Blessed Trinity, or unto Christ God and
Man. Yet in the Hebrew there is a difference in the very Names or words. The
Name Jehovah, which is usually rendered (...), Dominus, or Lord, is alike common
to every Person in the Holy Trinity, as expressing the Nature of the Godhead
[he that is being it self:] Howbeit, even this Name is sometimes in peculiar
sort attributed unto Christ. But that Christ, or the Son of God, is in those
places personally meant, this must be gathered from the Subject, or special
Circumstances of the matter, not from the Name or Title it self. But the name
Adonai, which properly signifies Lord or King, as (...) in Greek does (implying
as much as the Pillar, or Foundation of the people) is the peculiar Title of
the Son of God, or of God incarnate. And for attributing this Title unto Christ
as his peculiar, the Apostle St. Paul had a good warrant out of the Prophetical
Writings, especially the Psalms, which he questionless understood a great deal
better then many great Divines, and accurate Linguists have done his writings,
or the harmony betwixt the Psalmists, and his Evangelical Comments on them.
This Title of Lord [Adonai] is used most frequently in those Psalms, which
contain the most pregnant Prophecies of Christ, or the Messiah his exaltation.
Psalm. 2. 2, 4. The Kings of the earth band themselves, and the Princes are
assembled together against the Lord, and against his Christ. But he that
dwells in the heavens (doubtless he means the same Jehovah) shall laugh. Yet
he does not say, Jehovah, but Adonai, the Lord shall have them in derision.

The Reality of Dominion answering to this Title of Lord, whereunto the
Messiah, against whom they conspired, was exalted, is more fully expressed in
the same Psalm, v. 8, 9, 10. Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for
thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession. Thou shall
crush them with a Scepter of Iron, and break them in pieces like a Potters
vessel. Be wise now therefore ye Kings, be learned ye Judges of the earth:
serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice in trembling. Kiss the Son (the Son
doubtless of Jehovah) lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his
wrath shall suddenly burn; Blessed are all they that trust in him. And so again
Psalm. 45. which is as it were the Epithalamium, or marriage song of Christ and
his Church: The Prophet exhorts the Spouse to do, as Christ willed his
Disciples to do, and as Abraham had done at Gods Command, Forget thine own
people, and thy Fathers house, so shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty,
for he is the Lord; reverence or worship him v. 10, 11. And again, Psalm. 110.
wherein Christ's everlasting Priesthood is confirmed by Oath, it is said,
Jehovah said to my Lord [Adonai] sit thou at my Right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool. But may not the Jew thus Object; that seeing our Christ
or their expected Messiah is enstyled Adonai, not Jehovah, in these very
places, wherein his Exaltation or supreme Dominion is foretold; That therefore
he is not truly God, as Jehovah is? To this Objection our Saviors Reply to the
Jews (which had answered him rightly, that the Messiah was to be the Son of
David) is unanswerable and most satisfactorie. If the expected Messiah were not
to be the Son of God, and truly God the supreme Lord, as well of the dead, as
of the living, why did David in spirit call him Lord, before he was the Son of
David? It is a point to be observed, that the Jews in our Saviors time did
not, or could not deny, that this Psalm was literally meant of their expected
Messiah, albeit the later Jews seek to wrest it (but most ridiculously) some to
Ezekiah, some to Abraham.

But that the word [Adonai] is of no less value or importance then Jehovah,
but only imports Jehovah, or God incarnate, or the Messiah his Exaltation to be
Lord or King, may be evinced against the Jew; for that the same sacrifices of
praise and thanksgiving, which One Psalmist solemnly offers unto Jehovah,
Another Psalmist (or perhaps the same) does alike solemnly offer up to [Adonai]
or to the expected Messiah, in another Psalm. As Psalm. 57. (which is a
Prophetical Song of David, and contains the Exaltation of his God and Lord,)
Exalt thy self O God above the heaven, and let thy glory be upon all the earth,
ver. 5, 11. This Prophecy was then punctually fulfilled, and David's prayer, or
request signed by the mouth of God, when our Savior after his Resurrection
said; All power is given to me in heaven and in earth; go therefore, and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, Mat. 28. 18. Unto this Jehovah or God, whose Exaltation he
foresaw, and heartily prayed for, and unto whom he had directed his prayers,
ver. 1. He offers the Sacrifice of See Matthew. 16. 16, 19.
praise, ver. 9. under the title of Adonai; I will praise or confess thee
among the people, O Lord, I will sing unto thee among the Nations. The very
selfsame sacrifice David offers unto the same God, under the title of Jehovah,
Psalm. 108. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. O God mine heart is prepared, so is my tongue. I will
sing and give praise. Awake Viol and Harp, I will awake early. I will praise
thee O Lord, among the people, I will sing unto thee among the Nations. For thy
mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth reaches unto the clouds.
Exalt thy self O God above the heavens, and let thy glory be upon all the
earth: which last words, were twice repeated in the 57. Psam.

2. These Fundamental Points of Faith are clear from this collation of
Scripture. Two Fundamental points collected, by collating Scripture with
Scripture.
First, That Adonai, or Lord, was the known Title of the Messiah, whom the Jews
expected in our Saviors time; and this was the reason that the Pharisces had
not a word to answer or rejoyn unto our Savior, when he avouched, that the
Messiah was to be The Son of God, because David in Spirit called him [Adonai]
Lord, Matthew. 22. 45. The second; That he that was Adonai, or the Messiah, was
likewise Jehovah, truly God, because David did not in spirit only call him
Lord, but did in spirit worship him, as his Lord and God, with the best
sacrifice that he could devise, as appears from Psalm 57. 8.

A great part of the Book of Psalms, even all those passages (if my observation
fail me not) without exception, which mention the extraordinary manifestation
of Gods glory, or his exaltation as King, run the same way, and as it were pay
Tribute unto the infinite Ocean of Gods mercy; first manifested in our Saviors
Exaltation to the right hand of God. The more remarkable Passages are these.
Psalm. 97. ver. 1. Jehovah reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of
the Isles be glad. Whilst Jehovah was The Exaltation of Jehovah as King, is
that Kingdom of Heaven which S. John Baptist preached, to be then approaching.
only known in Jurie, the multitude of the Isles or Nations, had no special
reason to be glad, for Judah was then his Sanctuary and Israel his dominion;
but after God had given our Savior Christ the utmost parts of the earth for
his possession; that is, after our Saviors Ascension into Heaven, and the
effusion of the Holy Ghost upon his Disciples, enabling them to preach the
Gospel of the Kingdom unto all Nations, the multitude of the Isles, the whole
Earth had reason to rejoice: Then was that fulfilled, which follows in that
Psalm. ver. 6. The Heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people saw his
Glory. That this Psalm is literally meant of Christ's Exaltation to be Lord of
Lords, and of his Inauguration to his everlasting Kingdom; The Apostle St.
Paul, Heb. 1. 6. puts out of question amongst all Christians; when he brings
in his first begotten Son into the world, he says, Let all the Angels of God
worship him; so the Psalmist had said in this 97. Psalm. ver. 7. Confounded be
all they that serve graven Images, worship Him all ye Gods; or as the
Septuagint (upon which our Apostle often Paraphrased) Worship him all ye Angels
of God. The matter or subject of this Psalm is almost the same with Psalm. 2.
Both of them contain Prophesies concerning the Declaration of Christ to be the
Son of God. And from this harmony between this 97. and the second Psalm, and
from the common Prenotion or Rule of interpreting Scriptures, known to the
Learned or unpartially observant in those days, the Apostle adds that Preface
unto his Testimony; when he brings in his only begotten Son into the World:
He supposes that the Learned among his Countrie-men should or might have known
that both these Prophecies were to be punctually fulfilled upon the Exaltation
of the Messiah, or of those times, wherein God should be manifested in the
Flesh.

3. Yet some conjecture that our Apostle, Heb. 1. 6. has reference rather to
The Septuagint Deuteronomy. 32. 43. reconciled with Psalm. 97. 7.
Deuteronomy. 32. ver. 43. in the Greek Translation, then unto the 97 Psalm in the
Hebrew. The words indeed in the Greek or Septuagint are the very same, though
in the Hebrew not the same by any Equivalencie of the literal sense. At nec sic
quidem male. There is a variety of sense, yet no discord, but rather a full
and perfect Consort between the Literal and Grammatical sense of the Hebrew,
and the mystical and real sense, which the Greek or Septuagint in both places
expresses. First, The 97 Psalm (as many others are) is a Poetical descant upon
Moses his divine Prophetical Song, Deuteronomy. 32. And the 70 Interpreters (whether
out of some Prenotion, or out of the admirable Concord between that song of
Moses and the 97 Psalm, or out of a divine Instinct, wherewith (as St.
Augustine is of opinion) they were impelled sometimes to intersert a more
express meaning of the Holy Ghost, then an ordinary Commentator could out of
the Hebrew have observed; whether this way, or that way moved, they) have given
the same Paraphrase upon Deuteronomy. 32. ver. 43. which our Apostle has made upon
Psalm. 97. ver. 7. which is no other then the Septuagint had made before, but
literally more consonant to the Hebrew, then their Paraphrase upon Deuteronomy. 32. is.

But more probable it is, that our Apostle did aim at the 97. Psalm. then at the
forecited place of Deuteronomy. because the other Testimonies following in that Hebr.
1. 8, 9. are evidently taken out of the Book of Psalms: unto the SON, he
says; O GOD, Thy throne is for ever and ever, the Scepter of thy Kingdom is a
Scepter of righteousness. Thou have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity,
wherefore God, even thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above
thy fellows. This Testimony is evident in the 45. Psalm. v. 6, 7. So is that
other Heb. 1. 10, 11, 12. expressly contained in Psalm. 102, Thou Lord in the
beginning have established the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine
hands; They shall perish, but thou do remain, and they all shall wax old, as
does a garment; And as a vesture shall thou fold them up, and they shall be
changed; But thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

The former testimony is perhaps Typically Prophetical, and may in some sort
concern Solomon according to the literal sense, but Solomon only as he was a
Type of that Son of David, who was likewise to be the Son of God. But the
Character almost of every line in the hundred and second Psalm, testifies, that
the Psalmist in this grievous complaint had more then a Typical representation,
such a distinct and clear vision of Christ's Glory and Exaltation as the
Prophet Esaias Chap. 53. had of his humiliation in our flesh or humane nature.
The Title of this Psalm is, A prayer of the afflicted, when he shall be in
distress, and power forth his meditations before the Lord. And, The only
fountain of comfort to all afflicted in body or soul is the Exaltation See
Chap. 2.. 5. and chapter 3.. 11.
of Christ the Son of God in our flesh or nature. That, which must sweeten all
our bodily sorrows or afflictions, even the bitterness of death it self,
whereof this Psalmist, and the people of God in his time, had tasted, must be
our meditation upon that, and the like speeches of our Apostle; If we suffer
with Christ, we shall also reign with him. And for your comfort in all
distress, I cannot commend any fitter matter of meditation to you, then is
contained in this 102 Psalm, and in the 2. 4. and 12. Chapters to the Hebrews.
This Exaltation of Christ to be Lord, is alike clearly fore-prophesied, Psalm
99. and Psalm 145. as every observant Reader may of himself collect.

4. The more extraordinary and more special Grounds or Bases whereupon this
Title of Lord, as it is peculiar to Christ, is erected, are these. First,
Christ is in peculiar sort called The LORD, because it was God the Son, not The
Grounds of Christ's Title to be Lord.
God the Father, or God the Holy Ghost, who did personally pay the ransom of
our Sins; and this he fully paid by offering up part of our nature, made his
own, in a bloody Sacrifice to the Father. Servants we were by creation of our
nature, not only to God the Son, but to God the Father, and to God the Holy
Ghost, to the Divine nature or blessed Trinity: But we had sold our selves, for
enjoying the pleasures of the flesh, unto Gods adversary: And albeit we could
not by any compact or Covenant, whether implicit or express, made with Satan by
our first Parents, or by our selves, alienate our selves from Gods Dominion of
Jurisdiction over us; yet we did renounce his Service, and that Interest which
we had in his gracious protection as he was our Lord, and alienate unto his
enemy that property or disposal of our employments, which by right of creation
entirely belonged to God. God, after our first Parents Fall, was no otherwise
our Lord, then any King is Lord over Rebels, Traitors, Murderers; or of
others, who by their misdemeanors may alienate their allegiance from him, and
exempt themselves from his gracious protection, but not from his power or
Dominion of Jurisdiction; for he is the minister of God, for executing
vengeance upon such. Our first Parents had declared themselves to be Traitors,
and we had continued a race of Rebels against our God and Creator, without all
hope of being restored unto Gods favor and service, unless satisfaction were
made for our transgression, and means purchased for establishing us in a better
estate, then the estate of Servants, which we had by the gift of Creation. Now,
not only our redemption from the estate of Slaverie unto Satan, but all the
means for our further advancement (after our ransom was paid) were purchased by
the Son of God: And that, which most advances the peculiar Title of Christ's
Dominion and Lordship over us, was the price which he gave for us: For we were
not redeemed with corruptible things, as with silver and gold (though men with
these, and things more corruptible then these, do purchase the real title of
Lords, and exercise the dominion of Lords over Lands or Servants so purchased)
but we were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb undefiled
and without spot, 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Blood is the most precious and dearest part
of man's body, and greater love we cannot testify unto our dearest friends,
then by spending our blood for them. Losses we value none so deeply as
forgetfulness, ungrateful neglects, or contempt from them for whose sakes and
credit we have been content (specially out of sincerity of love and sober
resolution) to shed our blood: Never was any blood either so copiously shed, or
out of the like sincerity of love, or sobriety of resolution, as Christ's blood
was shed for all and every one of us; This blood did immediately issue from his
Manhood, whereof it was a true and lively part; yet was it the blood not of
Man only, but of God: whence if we consider either our own miserable estate,
being then the enemies of God, or his dignity that made Atonement for us;
What real portion, branch, or degree of service can we imagine answerable to
this Sovereign Title of Lord, which Christ has not more then fully purchased
over all that are partakers of flesh and blood?

5. Yet, Besides this Ground or Title of Christ's peculiar Lordship, or dominion
Other grounds of Christ's Title to be the Lord.
over us, there is another, more forcible to command our most cheerful service,
unless our hope be quite dead, or the affection of love utterly extinguished in
us: For, Christ by his precious blood did not only purchase our Freedom from
the Slavery of Satan; but, being set free, does by the everlasting efficacy of
this blood once shed, both wash and nourish us, not as his Servants, but as the
Sons of his and our heavenly Father. Sin and slaverie was the Terminus a quo,
the condition or state from which he redeemed us; but the end of our redemption
from these, was to invest us in the liberty of the Sons of God. The height of
all our hopes in the life to come, is, to be Kings and Priests as he is; but in
the mean time we are or may be, live members of his Glorious Body; and being
such, he has a more peculiar right of Dominion over us, over all that pertain
unto his Church, then by right of Creation he has as God, then by right of
Redemption or Atonement he has as God and Man: For, That part of our nature,
that flesh and blood which he took of his Mother, was his by a more peculiar
Title and real property, then it was God the Fathers or the Holy Ghosts; and
we by mystical and spiritual union with that part of the humane nature, which
he assumed into the Unity of his Divine Person, are His, at least He by this
union is our Head and Lord, by a more strict and proper Title, then God the
Father or God the Holy Ghost is: By the former Title of Redemption or
satisfaction made for us, he is our Lord, and we his servants: By this Title of
mystical Union with him, he is the Bridegroom or Head, the Church is his
Spouse; and being Head of the Church, every member of it is bound (as God by
the Psalmist exhorts the Spouse, Psalm. 45.) to worship him as our Lord and God,
for the husband is Lord of the wife. He bought all our souls being in the state
of Aliens or bond-servants, and after cleansed and purified them, that they
might be espoused to him, and finally presented to his Father: He has
purchased the Church of God (says St. Paul) with his own blood, Acts 20. 28.
And again, Ephesians. 5. Christ gave himself for the Church, that he might Sanctify
it, and cleanse it by the washing of water through the word: That he might make
it unto himself a glorious Church, etc. ver. 25, 26, 27.

CHAP. VIII. What our Confession of Christ to be The Lord, imports, and how
it redounds to the Glory of God the Father.
1. EVery tongue must confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, Our Lord, by a
peculiar Revel. 5. 13.
real Title. To this Confession every Son of Adam, to whom God has given the
use of the tongue, is bound de Iure; but many sons of Adam, to whom God has
given the use of the tongue, do not confess so much de Facto: The Jews with
their tongues flatly deny him to be the Lord, or their promised Messiah: The
Turks and Mahumetans confess him to be a Lord of Christians, but deny him to be
The Lord, The chief Lord under God the Father; This title of Chief Lord they
ascribe to Mahomet, and under his right they pretend a title of dominion over
Christendom. The Heathens, which know not God, do not so much as question
whether he be a Lord, or whether He or Mahomet be under God the chief Lord. But
as for us Christians, we all, to whom God has given the use of the tongue, do
confess him to be The Lord: As for those, to whom the use of the tongue is by
the course of nature, and Gods ordinary providence denied, others for them do
engage themselves at Sacred Baptism, that they, when God shall grant them a
heart to understand and a tongue to speak, shall confess him to be the Lord;
and to be unto them their Lord. And in case they dye before they come to
possess the use of their hearts or of their tongues, the Church or parish,
wherein this profession of faith was made on their behalfs, are bound to
profess thus much for them. And as God (no doubt) accepts the prayers of the
Church wherein they are baptized, for them, which cannot so much as speak to
men, much less pray to God or to Christ, That they may be admitted into his
visible Church, and be reputed as members of his mystical body: so doubtless
he will accept the prayers of the Church, and of every faithful member of the
Church wherein they live and dye, that they may be accepted into the Church
Triumphant, and to us invisible: albeit they never attained unto the use of the
tongue; or, when as the Lord, which gave others this blessing, has taken it
from them: For even of the tongue, or of the use of the tongue, that of Job is
most true, and to be resumed by all, as well by the dying as by the living: by
him for his own part; and by the living on his behalf: the Lord has given,
and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord, Job 1. 21.

2. Thus every tongue is bound de Jure to confess that Jesus Christ is the
Lord; that Lord, whom Job so long before did confess. But though every tongue
of men throughout the world, every tongue of Christians, of Jews, of
Mahumetans or Infidels should from their birth confess thus much; would this be
enough for that acknowledment, which here is required, that Jesus Christ is the
Lord? or would such acknowledgement of every tongue be sufficient to pay that
tribute, which is due unto the Glory of God the Father, from this Confession,
which is here required, that Jesus Christ is the Lord? No, it is not the
Confession of every tongue that will suffice, albeit the acknowledgment or
Confession of every tongue be de jure required. In this speech, [Every tongue
must confess etc.] there is a Twofold An universalitie of Duties as well as of
Tongues is included in this confession.
Universalitie included. The One, of the Parties thus confessing or
aknowledging, The Other, of the Duties or services to be performed by every
party thus acknowledging Christ to be the Lord.

To begin with the Former: when the Apostle says, That every tongue must
Confess that Jesus Christ is THE LORD; You must take this Universal note to be
equivalent to that phrase so often used (in the Book of the Revelation) by the
Evangelist and Apostle; [all nations and Kindreds, all people and Tongues]
every one, of all Sorts, of the Sons of Adam, are bound, de Jure, to confess,
That Jesus Christ the son of God, and the son of man, conceived by the Holy
Ghost, born of the virgin Marie, is THE LORD, of the Dying and of the Living,
of the Quick and of the Dead. As for all such as do not either in heart or
tongue, or in both, either by themselves or by others for them, truly
acknowledge Him in this life to be such a Lord, they shall acknowledge Him to
be such A Lord after their Resurrection from death, of which likewise He is
Lord.

3. But the acknowledgment of Every Tongue, or of every one, to whom God has
vouchsafed either a tongue or the use of the tongue, will not suffice to find
him a Gracious Lord at the resurrection from the dead, and at the day of final
Judgment. There must be, (as is said) an Universalitie as well of duties and
services to be performed by every particular person to whom God has given an
heart to understand, as an universalitie of tongues or lips, which are to make
this confession. The real language of every heart will be sufficient for every
one in particular, whom God has deprived or denied the use of the tongue. But
unto him, to whom God has given an understanding heart, and the use of the
tongue also, the hearty prayers and gracious words of others in his behalf
will not suffice, unless God by their prayers do frame his heart to believe,
and move his tongue (if God have given him the use of the tongue) to Confess
that Jesus Christ is the Lord. Cord creditur ad justitiam, ore fit confessio
ad salutem. If thou shall confess, with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall
believe in thine heart, that God has raised him from the dead, thou shall be
saved. For with the heart man beleiveth unto righteousness, and with the mouth
confession is made unto Salvation. Romans 10. 9, 10.

The Universalitie or extent of this Belief or Confession, in respect of the
parties whom it concerns, is most fully expressed in the verse following. For
the Scripture says, Esa. 28. 16. Whosoever believes on him shall (not make
haste, or) not be ashamed. And again Joel 2. 32. Whosoever calls on the name
of the Lord (whether he be Jew or Gentile) shall be saved. Thus you see, that
there is an universalitie of the parties or persons, which are bound de Jure to
make this Confession, and an Universalitie of comfortable promises unto all
such as make it as they ought; that is, not in tongue only, but with the Heart;
not in heart only, if God have given them the use of the heart and of the
tongue, or his blessings of memory and understanding.

4. That (besides this universality of persons confessing Christ with their
tongues to be the Lord) there is an Universalitie or Totality of duties to be
performed by every one that confesses Christ to be the Lord, is evident from
Jesus Christ our Lords own mouth, Luke 6. 46. Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do
not the things, which I say? This speech infers thus much at least, That though
all other, both Jews and Gentiles; even every tongue throughout the world, had
confessed as much as these his present Disciples (of which some were temporary,
some perpetual Professors) did; yet this would not suffice to make them capable
of the reward universally promised to his true Disciples and servants: That
this confession, though made by every tongue besides, was not sufficient to
make any particular man capable of the reward (promised to all his true
servants, that are capable of his words and sayings) which was not ready and
willing to do them. That every one, which heard his sayings, and was willing to
do them, was truly capable of all the blessings, which he promised, is clear
from his words following, ver. 47, 48, 49. Who so comes to me, and hears my
sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like: He is like a man
which built an house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a Rock: And
when the flood arose the stream brake violently upon that house, and could not
shake it, for it was founded upon a Rock. But he that hears and does not, is
like unto a man, that without a foundation built an house upon the earth,
against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the
ruin of that house was great. But our Lord and Saviors mind is by himself
more fully expressed to this purpose, Math. 7. 21. Not every one that says unto
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, But he that does the
will of my Father, which is in heaven. The limitation of these words, as well
for their negative as affirmative extent, is this: That neither every one, nor
any one of them, which shall confess only with their tongues that he is the
Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This limitation of the Negative,
or rather our Assurance of Faith, that this negative is thus far to be
extended, is manifest from the verse following. For to prophecy in the Name of
Christ, is more than to confess with the tongue only that Christ is Lord. To
cast out Devils in the Name of Christ is more then to prophecy in his Name: To
do many works of wonder in Christ's Name is more than to cast out Devils in his
Name. For to cast out Devils indeed is a wonderful work, and yet but One of
those wonderful works, which then and for many years after were done in Christ's
Name, by such as (although they did call Christ, Lord, Lord, as he truly is the
Lord of all) were not Christ's true servants, not such as Christ will take
notice of or approve as better, but rather reject as worse then Infidels, in
that last and dreadful day, when he shall call his servants (whether de jure,
or de facto) to a final account. For so it is expressed in the words following,
ver. 23, 23. Many will say unto me in that day (and the more the better, so
their plea were good) Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in
thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful works?
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; that is, I never approved
of you, but rather disapproved you and your works, as worse then the works of
heathens, or heathenish workers. For unto the Heathens, as Heathens, he has
not said, that he will say in the last day, Depart from me Ye Workers of
iniquity. That the Affirmative extent of his words, to such as shall not only
with their tongues confess, but in heart and practice acknowledge him to be the
Lord, is as large and ample as his former threatenings to such as either indeed
and facts deny him, or with their tongues and lips do not confess him to be the
Lord; his promise in the next words, ver. 24. will give us full assurance.
Therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken
him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock. And thus you see, The
words of our Lord and Savior (confirmed by the mouths of two Authentic
witnesses, St. Matthew and St. Luke) do warrant the truth of these two
Universals, That never a one of such, as only with the tongue confess him to
be the Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: That every one, which in
heart confesses him, though with tongue he cannot confess him to be the Lord,
shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven: For every one which does the will of
his Father which is in heaven (and the doing of this his heavenly Fathers will
here, is not an act of the Tongue, but of the heart, and of the affections)
shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the place and seat appointed
for all Christ's true Servants, and only for them. The only question then
remaining, is, What this Will of his heavenly Father is? what it is to do it?

5. This will of His heavenly Father is either General, whatsoever is expressed
in the Ten Commandments, in the moral Law, or in the Prophets; or more
Special, as it is revealed in Christ or by Christ: Did Christ then give us a
New Law, or other precepts, then God by Moses had done? Or did he give us (as
the Church of Rome says) Evangelical Counsels as Additionals unto the Law? In
no wise: Christ taught no other things, then his Apostles after his
resurrection did preach; and his Apostles taught no other things then Moses and
the Prophets had taught, Acts 26. 22. But these they taught after The same will
of God is declared by Moses and the Prophets, and by Christ; but more fully by
Christ.
another manner, then the Scribes and Pharisees did, then the ordinary
Expositors of the Law and the Prophesies had done.

So that Gods will concerning man, was more fully declared by Christ, then it
was by Moses or by the Prophets; the very true meaning of Moses himself and of
the Prophets was more fully revealed and clearly manifested unto mankind in
Christ, then it was to Moses himself or to the Prophets: Unto me (says our
Apostle, Ephesians. 3. 8, 9, 10.) who am less then the least of all Saints, is this
grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
Christ: And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which
from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by
Jesus Christ: To the intent that now unto the Principalities and Powers in
Heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God. And by
this more full declaration of Gods Will in Christ, we Christians are tied unto
more strict observance of His Will known, then men were tied unto before Christ
was declared to be the Lord; Admitting the Services to be the very same, yet
the same services are now due under a double Title: They are due to God the
Father by right of Creation, and due to Christ as he is Lord; For God the
Father is to be honored not only in himself, but in Christ.

6. God, when he gave the moral Law to Israel, uses this Preface, I am the
Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt: This was his The
first Instance how Christians are bound more strictly to obey now, then Jews
were before Christ.
peculiar right or Title unto Israel, and the Precept grounded upon this Title
follows, Thou shall have no other Gods but me. But you may remember how it was
foretold by the Prophet Jeremie, Jer. 23. 7, 8. That it should no more be said,
the Lord lives, which brought the children of Israel out of Egypt; But the
Lord lives, which brought up the seed of the house of Israel out of the North
Land: Or (according to the prime Grammatical sense of the word principally
intended by the Holy Ghost) out of the Land of darkness; and This was
fulfilled only in Christ: So that He, who was the Lord of Israel by right of
redemption from Egyptian bondage, is now become the Lord of every Language, of
every Nation and Kindred by a more peculiar Title, by right of redemption from
the Powers of darkness, and from Hell it self. Mal. 4. 2. Matthew. 4. 16. Luke 2.
32. John 1. 6.
Hence says our Apostle, 1. Cor. 8. 5, 6. Though there be that are called
Gods, whether in heaven or in earth (as there are Gods many and Lords many) But
to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him;
and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him: As the
Israelites are forbid to have any other God, besides the Lord, which brought
them out of the Land of Egypt; so are we Christians forbid to have any Lords or
Masters besides Christ: So says our Savior, Matthew. 23. 8, 9, 10. Be not ye
called Rabbi, for one is your Master, even Christ; call no man your father upon
the Earth, for one is your Father which is in heaven: And he repeats the former
Caveat, Neither be ye called Masters, for one is your Master, even Christ. He
that forbids them to be called Masters over others, does likewise forbid them
to be servants to other Masters besides himself: And this Duty is more fully
expressed by our Apostle, 1 Cor. 7. 23. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the
servants of men. He no way forbids bodily service, but rather injoyns such as
were servants (properly so called, that is slaves or bondmen) to continue in
their calling, ver. 20, 21. as knowing bodily servitude not to be incompatible
with Christian liberty, no not with the Liberty of the Sons of God: He that is
called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lords freeman; likewise he that is
called, being a Freeman, is Christ's servant: What service of men then does
Christ or his Apostles forbid? The vassalage of our reason or understanding, or
the submission of our consciences to the pleasures or services of men, or of
the corrupt times wherein we live: What service of men is forbidden, 1 Cor. 7.
23.
Thus to alienate our service from Christ to any mortal men, is (whether you
list to call it) a branch of Sacrilege or Idolatry, if not more gross, yet
certainly more deadly in all such as confess Christ to be their Lord, then the
worshipping of stocks and stones was either in the Heathen, or in the
Israelites themselves, before Christ was declared to be the Son of God, and
solemnly proclaimed to be the Lord. To give you another Instance how Gods Will
is more exactly done by Real Confession of Christ to be THE LORD.

7. This is the will of God, says the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. Even your
sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication, that every one of you
should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor; not in the
lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God. To this duty
the Israelites A second instance of obedience more strictly enjoined
Christians, then it was the Jews.
were as truly tied as we Christians are: It was (as the Apostle intimates) a
necessary branch or fruit of the true knowledge of God, a service due unto him,
as he was the Creator; But unto this same duty, the Israelites were not bound
by so many ties, as we Christians are: It is required of us by a strict
peculiar Title, not only by our knowledge of God as our Creator, nor by our
acknowledgement of Christ to be the Lord, as this Title of Lord has relation
only unto servants; he may and does exact this duty at our hands, not only by
right of Redemption, or by paying the ransom for our sins upon the Cross, but
by right of Espousals, or by Title of Lord, as he is the Head and Husband of
his Spouse, the Church: No motive can be so forcible to deter men from
transgressing this negative Commandment, or for encouraging them to do Gods
Will in the affirmative part of the former Commandment; as that of our Apostle,
1 Cor. 6. 13. 14, 15. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord,
and the Lord for the body: And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also
raise up us by his own power: Know ye not that your bodies are the members of
Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an
harlot? God forbid: And again, ver. 20. Ye are bought with a price, therefore
glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods.

8. It was well observed long ago by Occolampadius, that children were See the
10 Book Chap. 39. page 3187.
taught amiss to know the nature of God, or of his Enemy, by vulgar Pictures or
Representations. For so the fashion was long before, and continued till his
time, to picture God, or the blessed Trinity, in some fair and beautiful form,
and to paint the devil in some foul, loathsome, or ugly shape. And this good
Writer to correct their error, well admonished, as well the parents as their
children, That if they would learn to know what God was, they must first be
taught to know what Goodness is, what Justice is, what Mercy is, what Bounty or
loving kindness is: And if they desire to know what manner of creature the devil
is, who is the chief enemy of God, they should first be taught to know what
malice is, what filthiness is, what loathsomness is, what villainy or treachery
is. For Satan is but a Compost of these, or an extract of all that children or
their parents acknowledge for evil: Howbeit, if either children or parents
could be taught to know what Justice is, what Mercy is, what loving kindness
is; or if they could be taught to know that God is, what all these are, even
Justice it self, even mercy it self, loving kindness it self, wisdom it self;
or Wisdom, Justice, Mercy, and loving kindness it self truly infinite; yet his
wisdom, his mercy, and loving kindness would be to us incomprehensible,
unapprehensible, even in that these Attributes in him are infinite: We could
have no true or lively apprehension, either speculative to inform our
understandings what were good and ought to be followed; or moral, to enable and
qualify our hearts and affections to imitate or express that pattern of
goodness, or so much of it as we apprehend in God, if we should look upon these
Attributes as they are in God the Father only, or in the Divine nature: But as
he that cannot look upon the Sun in its strength or brightness, or at the noon
day, may take the model of it in the water, or in the Moon at full; So we that
cannot behold the glory of Divine Majesty in the Godhead, may safely behold the
Map or Model of his incomprehensible Goodness in the Man Christ Jesus: All His
actions and endeavors were with such wisdom set and bent upon mercy, on
goodness, on loving kindness, that every one which saw, and duly considered his
manner and course of life here on Earth, might collect that he truly was (as
himself avouched) more then the Son of man, the very Son of God himself, who is
good and gracious to all: For Christ as Man, went about doing good to all,
doing hurt to none. Now (as the Son of Syrach says, Ecclus. 22. 3.) That an
evil son is the dishonor of his father: So it will follow by the Rule of
Contraries; That a wise or good son is the honor of his father: So Solomon has
said in express terms, Prove. 10. 1. A wise son makes a glad father, but a
foolish son is the heaviness of his mother: Now Christ, as we know, is called,
The Wisdom of the only wise immortal God, his beloved Son, in whom he is well
pleased: And well pleased with him he is, for that he is the honor of his
Father: And as Christ by confessing God, and by real expression of his Goodness
in his life and actions, did truly glorify his Father, as he himself expressly
avoucheth, John 17. So all that really confess Christ to be the Lord; that is,
all which thoroughly express the Map or Model of his Goodness in their lives and
conversations, do truly glorify God the Father.

9. Briefly then, Every tongue truly and rightly confesses Christ to be the
Lord; that observes his Commandments, or that observes the Commandments of God
more strictly and more religiously then others do, who although they profess
they honor God, yet do not honor him as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, or
do not honor Jesus Christ as his only Son: This is that special Will of the
Father which is in heaven, and that which must be done by all which mean to
enter into Heaven, that every one which honoreth the Father, should also honor
the Son, Joh. 5. 23. Honor the Son they must, not in words or title only, but
by performance of real Service: Every one that thus honoreth the Son, does
hereby glorify God the Father: Hence says our Savior, Matthew. 5. 16. Let your
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works; and glorify your
Father which is in heaven. And again, Ioh. 15. 1. Our Savior compares himself
to the Vine, and his Father unto a Husbandman, which expects the fruit of his
vineyard: So that the end why the Son of God did descend from heaven, why he
was planted and took root here on earth, was that the sons of Adam, or Abraham,
might be ingrafted in him; and the End of our ingrafting in him was, that we
might bring forth fruit unto his So Christ says, Joh. 15. 8. Herein is my
Father glorified, that you bring forth much fruit, so shall ye be my Disciples.

But What comfort is it to have Christ Our Lord, if by Allegiance to him, we be
more strictly bound to do the will of God, then those which do not acknowledge

Him their Lord? I Answer: 1. It is a credit (by consent of Nations, and repute
of men naturally wise, if not A Real Comfort, to have him Our Lord, who governs
his people by the most excellent and equitable Laws: Such were those which the
Son of God gave the Jews: What are these now refined in the Gospel? All men
naturally desire happiness: As by those Laws Deuteronomy. 4. 5, 6, 7, 8.
God directed the Jews, so by these he disciplines Us, for our Good; seeking
occasion or Title in our obedience, to exercise his bounty, by rewarding us for
doing good to our selves and others at his command: He that sins against the
laws of Christ (does it, in Sui damnum) sins against his own soul; and by
straying from them, goes out of that way which only can lead him to the
happiness he desires. 2. It is comfort that our Lord rules not with rigor, but
masters See the Application, Chap. 2.. 5, 6. f. 3316.
his Dominion with Equity: Novit figmentum nostrum, having Himself been
compassed with the infirmities of man's nature (all but such as did proceed from
sin, or lead unto sin) he can, by acquaintance and experience of them, tell,
both how willing the spirit, and how weak the flesh of miserable Mortals be,
and ready is he to give allowance accordingly. But Thirdly, Here is comfort
indeed, That as JESUS CHRIST the Righteous is our Lord; so He is The Lord our
Righteousness; so is He our Solicitor, our Advocate, our most compassionate
High Priest, who, ex officio, negotiates on our behalf, by mediation and
intercession with the Father, for pardon of all our transgressions,
negligences, ignorances; both of all sins committed, and duties omitted, or
performed untowardly and amiss: He made One Propitiation by his death, and he
lives for ever to make intercession for us. Yea, so gracious is This our Lord,
that he seems, in a manner (during this Acceptable Day, or time of Grace) to
lay aside The Title and Dignity of Lord, and to put on The Affection of a
Priest, perpetually to make intercession on our behalf, for Remission of sins
past, (Romans 3. 26.) and for Grace, whereby for the future we may serve God
acceptably, with reverence and godly fear: Seeing then we have so great an High
Priest, Let us hold fast our Profession -- And let us come boldly to the Throne
of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

SECTION III. Of Christ's coming to Judgment.
2 Cor. 5. 10. For we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ; That
every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has
done, whether it be good or bad. Acts 17. 30.But now, God commands all men
every where to repent; because he has appointed a day in which he will judge
the world in righteousness, by that man whom he has ordained, whereof he has
given all men assurance, in that he raised him from the dead. Daniel. 7. 9.
Romans 14. 9. To this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might
be Lord both of the dead and of the living. -- We shall All stand before the
Judgment Seat of Christ. -- Every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall
confess to God. Revel. 20. 12.
CHAP. IX.
THe First Words contain an undoubted Maxim, or principal Article of our Faith;
yea, such a Plurality of Articles of Christian Belief, that I could not choose
fitter, for continuation of my former Argument, concerning Christ's Lordship or
Dominion: And His Dominion (as was said before) was A Dominion both of Property
and of Jurisdiction: We are his servants, not our own Men (as we say) we may
not dispose of our own souls, or bodies, much less of our bodily employments or
endeavors, as We please, but as He pleases: Or in case we wrong him, by
alienating the employments of our bodies, or of our souls from his service, who
has the full Dominion of Property; we cannot exempt our selves from his
Dominion of Jurisdiction, to which all flesh is liable without Appeal. Now of
his Dominion of Jurisdiction, or of his Royal Power over us, the Exercise of
Final Judgment, is the Principal Part: And of this Judgment the general Sum or
Abstract is contained in 2 Cor. 5. 10.

Before I enter upon the Particulars therein contained, I am in General to
advertise, That albeit the Scripture be such A Complete Rule of Christian An
Advertisement concerning H. Scripture
Faith, That neither those which are appointed to interpret the Scriptures
ought to propose or commend any point or doctrine as an Article of Faith, unto
others; nor are others bound to believe any thing as a Point of Faith, unless
it be either expressly contained in the Scriptures, or may out of the express
testimonies of them, be deduced by infallible Rules of Reason and Art: Yet in
the things believed, because contained in Scripture, there is a Difference to
be observed. Some things we believe without any Ground at all besides the mere
Authority of Scriptures: Other things we believe from the Authority of
Scriptures too; yet so, as we have the truth, which the Scriptures teach
concerning them, ensealed unto us by Experiments answering to the Rules of
Scriptures. And these Experiments be Experiments in Nature, and in our selves
or Consciences, confirm the truths of H. Scripture.
of two sorts; Either Observable in the general Book of Nature, and course of
times; or Observable in our selves. Of this later rank are the Articles of the
Godhead, of the Creation, of Divine Providence, of Original Sin, of Final
judgment, and of Life and Death everlasting.

The Being of a Godhead or Divine Power, the very Heathens, which knew not
Scriptures, did in some sort believe: of Gods Providence, and of Judgment after
this life, the Heathens likewise had diverse Notions, which were as rude
materials or stuff unwrought. The frame or fashioning of which Notions into
true and Christian Belief, cannot otherwise be effected then by the Rules of
Scripture, which are The Lines, by which the structure or edifice of Faith must
be squared or wrought. Now whatsoever the Heathens without the help of
Scriptures, or Divine Revelations, did believe or conceive concerning the
Points mentioned, Every Christian man, which does believe the Scriptures,
though but by an historical Faith, may much better believe and conceive by the
help of Scriptures, albeit his affections be not as yet sanctified by the
Spirit of Grace; although he be but in the Estate of a mere Moral or Natural
man; so he be not delivered up unto a Reprobate sense.

The Branches then of my Meditations, concerning this Grand Article of Christ's
coming to Judgment, shall be in general These.

First, Of the Natural Notions, which the Heathens had, and which every natural
man (so his Conscience be not seared) may have Experienced in himself, Five
General Points.
of a Final Judgment after this life, or of a Recompense according to his ways
or works.

The Second, By what Authority of Scriptures, the Exercise of this Final
Judgment is appropriated to Christ.

The Third, The manner of Christ's coming to Judgment.

The Fourth, The parties that are to be Judged, to wit, the Quick and the Dead.

The Fifth, The Sentence or Award of this great Judge; and that is, Everlasting
Life, or Everlasting Death.

Thus you see, Three Principal Articles of Our Creed, to wit, This, of Christ's
coming to Judge the quick and the dead; and the Two last, viz. The Resurrection
of the body, and The life everlasting, are so linked together, that they cannot
be so commodiously explained in several, as they may be in this proposed Link
or Chain.

CHAP. X. Of the Natural Notions, which the Heathens had, and the Internal
Experiments, which every true Christian may have, answering to these Notions of
a Final Judgment.
1. THe Notions, which the Heathens had of a Judgment to pass upon them after
this life, were of Two Sorts; Either Implicit and Indirect; Heathen Notions,
of Two Sorts.
such ^s give better Testimony to us, then they made of it to themselves; or
Direct and Express, though indefinite and imperfect, and mingled for the most
part with some error. And these Later are most frequent in the ancient heathen
Poets; Many of whose Testimonies to this purpose are so Express and direct,
that they may well seem to have been taken from some scattered Traditions of
that truth, which God had revealed unto the Patriarchs before the Law was
written, or from the written Law it self, which it is probable Plato with some
other Philosophers and Poets had read, at the least received at the second
hand. However, unless the truth concerning this point delivered in Scriptures
had been imperfectly implanted in men's hearts by nature, these mere natural men
could not have submitted their Assent or Opinions unto it.

That not the ancient Poets only, but the ancient Philosophers had an express
Notion of pains or torments, which the wicked after this life were to The
Pythagorean Notion.
suffer, we may gather from Aristotle, Poster. lib. 2. cap. 11. For so he tells
us, that the Pythagoreans did assign this final cause of thunder, namely, to
terrify such as were reserved in infernal prisons. And in assigning this Final
Cause of thunder, whose Material and Efficient Cause with its properties they
were not ignorant of; they did acknowledge an Higher Guide or Governor of these
natural Effects then nature her self. We may perhaps rectify this Notion by
saying, The thunder was created by this Guide or Governor of Nature, rather to
terrify such as live here on earth, that they come not into these infernal
prisons. And to avoid or prevent their coming into them, Nature her self, which
taught Pythagoras this Philosophy, might teach all, That there can be no means
so safe or so compendious, as the making of our peace with that divine Power,
who speaks to men in this terrible language. The thunder of his power (says
Job, cap. 26. 14.) Who can understand? But the less we understand It in
Particular, the better we understand Him to be a Terrible Judge. That this
Notion, which the thunder did suggest to the Pythagorean Philosophers of the
Divine Power, as avenger of Evil, was not a Philosophical Phancie, but
implanted by Nature in the heart, may be further evinced; for that the thunder
did imprint the like fear in such as in words or opinion did deny the Divine
Providence, or sought to shake off all conceit of future Judgment. Witness the
Emperor Caligula, who so demeaned himself in his Empire and tyranny over
others, as if he never looked to be called to any account for his Regencie; and
yet this man (as Suetonius tells us) would rise from the table, when it
thundered, and often times for fear run under his Bed; He knew himself exempt from
the censure or control of man, and had enough about him to instruct him in the
natural causes of thunder; and yet by this strange fear he did acknowledge a
superior Judge, from whose presence or apprehension he sought to hide himself,
as Malefactors do themselves from the eyes or hands of earthly Judges, or from
the ministers of civil Justice.

2. But might not this strange fear arise rather from some peculiar disposition
in Caligula, then from any instinct of nature, universal to all such as he was,
upon the like or equivalent Summons or admonitions? From whatsoever disposition
we can imagine this servile or slavish fear should proceed, it was a timorous
disposition, and could not have wrought or inclined such men, as he was, unto
such manifest documents of imminent fear, but from a feeling consciousness of a
foul and beastly life: For he was a man that in other cases had gotten as full
a Conquest over his Conscience, as any Man, Prince or Subject, in this life can
possibly get. He had with much care and cost lulled his conscience with
variety of all pleasures incident to sense or earthly affections, into so dead
a sleep, that no voice of man, though Ambassador from God; no voice of God
(known to men) besides this terrible voice of his thunder, could have awaked
it. But amongst ten thousand such as he was, that is, of such as for the most
part have lived as beasts, and for this reason could desire to dye like beasts,
without any account or reckoning how they had spent their Lives; it will be
hard to find one, that in some or other particular did not give A true Crisis
or proof of this Truth, which now we teach (that is, of a Judgment after this
life) by nature implanted in their hearts; albeit most of them in words would
not confess it: albeit many of them used their own and their Parasites wits by
natural reasons to overthrow or enervate the force of it. But as in Cases of
civil Justice, the unwitting acknowledgement of some material or pertinent
Circumstances, drawn from such, as otherwise seek to conceal or smother the
Main truth (upon which they are directly examined) is with intelligent Judges,
of more force, then one or two voluntary testimonies of men suspected to be
Accessaries in the business, or partial favorers of the principal Actor: So in
this controversy betwixt God and our own Consciences, The unwitting practices
(or passionate expressions made in some extremity) of such heathens, as either
denied or knew not the truth of a Final Judgment, do give more powerful and
more authentic testimonies for it, then either the authority or express
testimony of other heathens, which did expressly or directly affirm it (save
only so far, as their testimony was grounded upon the like instinct of
nature, or implanted Notion, which did move the others to confess it indirectly
or in practice, although in words they did deny it, or not confess it) do for
it; or then the avowed denials of any more debauched Heathens in their Jollity
do against it.

3. In many Cases as well natural and moral as divine, there may be a real and
solid truth, or ground of truth in the practice, without any apprehension of it
in the practitioner; often times with opposition to it in his Conceit or
Opinion. Most men, when they desire to call things forgotten to mind, will rub
or scratch the back part of their head. The Ground or Reason of their Practice
is from Nature her self, which has placed the faculty of memory in that part
of the brain, or at least in some other part, betwixt which and that which they
so handle, there is special intercourse. Howbeit most men observe this practice
or custom by mere instinct of nature, without so much as once questioning or
thinking whether their faculty of memory be seated in the brain or in the
breast. And some perhaps do use this custom, being of a contrary opinion, viz.
That the memory is seated in the forepart of the Brain. But their manifest
conformity to others in this custom, will in any indifferent Moderators
Judgment prevailingly prescribe against their Opinion. Few there be again so
destitute of natural reason, but would be able as occasion requires, or
exigents impel, to give warmth to some things that were cold, and to cool other
things that be hot, by blowing or breathing upon them. Yet this custom is
practiced by most out of mere instinct of nature, without thought or question,
how such two contrary effects, as heat and cold, could possibly issue from one
and the same mouth or breath. There is a true and real cause of this diversity
or contrariety in the effects, and a true reason in nature, how they are
wrought, albeit this cause or reason be, neither in whole nor in part,
apprehended by such as practice it with success. Yea of such as have their
senses exercised in the study of Philosophy, scarce one of five there is, but
if he should on the sudden be put thus to practice by rule of Art, would fail
of his purpose, more, then such as thus practice by mere instinct of nature; or
would be as far to seek, if he were put to give the true reason of it, as the
poor Pilgrim in the Fable was, who being kindly entertained by a Satyr, which
had found him blowing his fingers for extremity of cold in the woods, was
unkindly thrust out of his house, only for seeking to cool his broth with the
same breath, wherewith he had warmed his fingers.

4. But in what practices or resolutions in the heathen was this divine truth
of a Judgment after this life necessarily included? The particulars are many,
but most of them may be reduced unto this General. As many of the heathens as
either esteemed the love of virtue, honesty, or godliness more dear then this
mortal life with its appurtenances temporal; or as many of them as did abhor
the practice of any villani or impiety more than death; whatsoever they
themselves did expressly say or think concerning this Article of Final Judgment
in particular, did by these practices or resolutions give authentic testimony
unto it. Now that virtue or honesty were to be more esteemed then this mortal
life, with all the commodities of it, the most part of heathen Philosophers
(besides the Sect of Epicures) did grant and maintain. The Stoics went further
in the esteem of moral virtue, then any wise Christian will do in practice,
then any good Christian ought to do in opinion: (but of their errors or
Hyperboles anon.) Aristotle the Prince of Philosophers grants, that there is
(...); that some things be absolutely good, so good that a man ought to love
them more than life, or rather to abandon life than their practice. Some things
again he grants absolutely evil; So evil, that a man ought rather to choose
death then adventure upon them; such are Treason against our native Country,
Incest, Perjury, etc. This great Philosopher, in expressly granting thus much,
is necessarily concluded by his own Principles to grant a life after this life
ended much better then this; and a death, or an estate of life much worse than
death, to such as have lived and died dishonestly. Nor is he thus far concluded
only by his own Principles, but by the very Principles of Nature, whose chief
Secretary he was. For every thing that has Being, does by an indispensable Law
of nature desire the continuance of such Being as it has; but most of all of
its Well-being or bettering of its present estate. Now if man's hopes or fears
were terminated in this life (as needs they must with this life be terminated,
unless we grant a Judgment after death, or an award of the evils which men
fear, or of the good things which they hope) every man were bound in reason and
by nature to seek the preservation or continuance of his own life before all
things in the world besides. Nothing were to be esteemed worse then a bodily
death, nothing so good as continuation of bodily life with health and
competency. Much better it were to be a part of this visible world, then
utterly not to Be. To avoid or put off this utter not-Being, so long as were
possible, no devise could be dishonest, no practice amiss. We do not blame
bruit beasts for making what shift they can for maintaining or saving their
lives; no means, which they can use to this end only, are by us accounted
foul; for as we say, they do but follow kind, or do as nature directs them: But
what is the reason why in thus doing they do not amiss, nor deserve blame?
Because nothing can be so ill to them as death, nothing so good as life: But
for a Man to transform himself into a Beast, or to continue beastly or filthy
practices, for continuance or preservation of his bodily life; this the very
Heathens did detest as unnatural, base, and odious: What was the reason? they
saw by light of nature, that man had better hopes then beasts are capable of,
as it were wrapped up for him in the constant practice of honesty and virtue,
and was capable withal, of greater evil which might accrue from a dishonest and
filthy life, then any evil that is incident to the nature of beasts; yet did
not that Good which good men did aim at, either in practice of virtue, or by
declining vice, always betide them in this life, in the Judgment of most
Heathen.

5. Two things there were, which most later Heathens (not the Stoics only)
did highly extol in Regulus; the one, That he did prefer the love of his
Country, before the contentments of this life, which he might have enjoyed in
plenteous manner. The other, That he did prefer a lingering and cruel death,
before the stain or guilt of perjury: For being in hold or durance amongst the
Carthaginians, he was remitted to Rome, upon oath, That if he did not effect
what they had given him in charge to treat for, he should return again to
Carthage, and undergo such punishment as they should think fit to inflict: It
was in his power to have effected with the Romans that, which the Carthaginians
did desire; but he would not use his power to persuade, but rather to dissuade
the Romans from condescending to their enemies desire, because he saw it would
be prejudicial to their Commonweal and posterity, though advantageous to him in
particular: But he accounted it rather loss then gain, as well to himself as to
the Roman State, to save the life, though of some worthy Peer as he was, by
breach of Oath or Perjury; and in this resolution he returned unto the
Carthaginians, although he knew they resolved to put him to cruel and lingering
torture. The Observation upon this resolution of Regulus (which will generally
serve for all the like, by what Heathen soever practiced or commended) is
briefly This: No humane practice or resolution can be truly commendable, but
only so far as it helps to make the Practitioner a better man then he was
before, or could continue to be, without such practice. Was Regulus then a
better man by this practice, then without it he could have been? Or did it
truly propagate or continue that goodness which before he had? If he by doing
this did not continue his former goodness, or become a better man, his
commendations are unjust; the Fact it self was not truly commendable, was no
argument either of reason or wit in the Practiser, or of honesty in the
Resolution: If by this Resolution he became a better man then before he was, or
without it could have been, somewhat of Regulus, did, after the accomplishment
of this fact, remain to receive the due reward of this Resolution, as either
his soul, his body, or both: For every real Accident or Attribute, necessarily
supposes a real subject to support it; and if no better doom had been reserved
for Regulus, then that which the Carthaginians, his chief Judges on earth, did
award him, he could not possibly either have continued or bettered his
well-being by undertaking it; it was altogether impossible for him to become a
better man by this practice, by which he does utterly cease to be a man, if his
hopes had been terminated with this mortal life, or if he had not remained
capable of reward or punishment after death.

That very thing was, even by the verdict of the Heathen, highly magnified in
Regulus (a wise Statesman and good Patriot) which in a bruit Beast, of what
kind soever would have been accounted, and that justly, more then
unreasonableness, a very madness: For no beast, unless it be altogether mad,
will evidently expose it self to death. That which exempts Regulus his witting
exposing of himself to a more cruel death then any sober man could find in his
heart to put a dumb beast unto, from censure of Folly, was, The managing of his
undertakings by Resolution and Reason: And all the reason that he had thus to
resolve, was, That he hoped not utterly to perish as beasts do, although
certain he was to die. Beasts, which run upon their own deaths, are therefore
accounted mad, because by death they utterly cease from being what they were:
For them to desire death, is to desire their utter destruction, which they
could not desire, but seek by all means possible to avoid, unless they had
first put of all common sense, wherein the height of their madness consists:
Regulus was therefore accounted manly resolute, and resolutely wise, for that
in choosing rather to die, then to live with stain of perjury, or taint his
soul with breach of oath; he did not desire his own destruction, but the
continuation of his well-being, or bettering his own or his Countries estate:
And this his desire or resolution (which supposes another sentence after this
life ended) the Heathens which so highly magnified his resolution did subscribe
unto as good, and fit to be imitated by all honest men and true Patriots,
albeit perhaps most of them were unwilling to be his seconds in like attempts,
when the matter came to the trial.

6. Nor did the Romans only commend this Resolution in Regulus, whose Memory
for well deserving of that Commonweal, they had in perpetual Reverence: But
other Heathens which did detest the very name of Christians, and eagerly sought
the extirpation of Christ's Church on earth, did as much admire and commend the
like in Christian Bishops: Two memorable stories very apposite to this purpose,
come to my mind; the one related by St. Gregory Nazianzen, the other by St.
Austin. Nazianzens story is of Bishop Marcus S. G. Nazianzen's story of Bishop
Marcus Arethusus, is in his third Oration; or former Invective against Julian.
Arethusus, who was sentenced to a cruel death and torture by Julian the
Emperor, unless he would at his own cost and charges build up an Idol Temple,
which he had caused to be pulled down: After that his persecutors had brought
the damages required at his hands so low, that if he would be content to give
but an Angel (or some small piece of Gold current in those times) to the
re-edifying of the Temple which he had destroyed, he should live; yet he
persevered so constantly in his former Resolution (which was not to give so
much as a penny by way of Contribution for building up any house of Iniquity)
that his Persecutors were ashamed to take life from him.

Saint Augustine (in his Tract against Lying) tells us of Bishop Firmus, S.
Austins story of Bishop Firmus.
who, being pressed to bewray another Christian Brother (whose death (or
Turning) the Heathens earnestly sought, having strong presumptions that This
good Bishop knew where he was) after many torments, and threats of more, with
great constancy refused: All the words that they could wrest Metaphrastes has
a story of Anthimus Bishop of Nicomedia, partly like This.
from him, were these, Mentiri non possum, I cannot lie; (and yet he must have
lied, if he had denied that he knew where the Party was whose life they
sought:) But as I cannot lie, so I cannot become a Traitor or Bewrayer of my
Brother; do what you will or can unto me.

This constant Resolution, as Saint Austine testifies, did so turn the edge of
his Persecutors malice into admiration and reverence of his integrity, that
they dismissed him with honor: Howbeit, there had been no wit or
praise-worthiness in the practice, unless the Practiser had expected some beter
Sentence after Death (to which he did thus constantly expose himself) then the
applause of these Heathens, which he could not hope for, which he did not
expect. And the heathens in commending and admiring his constancy and
integrity, did, though faintly or unwittingly, yet necessarily subscribe unto
the truth of his hopes or belief of a Judgment after death; as also unto that
Oracle of God delivered by his Apostle, that seeing Christ has laid down his
life for us, we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 1 John 3. 16. At
least we ought to expose our selves to bodily death, rather then suffer them to
be put upon the hazard of death eternal: As it is likely this Good Bishop
feared, lest he should hazard this poor Christian soul, whose death or Turning
the Heathens sought, being not so certain of his Resolution as of his own, but
doubtful whether he would not deny Christ, or renounce the Christian Faith,
rather then suffer such tortures, as he now felt, or expose himself to such a
violent and cruel death, as they threatened him with.

7. Again, The most wise and learned among the heathen Philosophers did place
Felicity or true happiness in the constant practice of Virtue, as in
Temperance, Justice, Wisdom, etc. The Stoics were so wedded to this Opinion,
The opinion of the Stoics.
that they held virtue to be a sufficient recompense to it self, at what rate
soever it was purchased or maintained; though with the loss of life, and limbs,
with the most exquisite and lingering tortures, that our senses are capable of.
They esteemed Regulus more happy even in the midst of his torments, then his
persecutors were or could be in the height of their mirth and prosperity, or in
the perfect fruition of their health, or best contentments of their senses or
understandings; Yea so far they went, that they judged Regulus to perpetual
happiness, albeit he had been perpetually or everlastingly so tormented as for
a time he was. But This (...) (as was formerly intimated) then any good
Christian is bound to believe (...), we are bound to believe the contrary. For
so St. Paul (who was more virtuously constant then Regulus was in his
profession; more then virtuously, Religiously constant in all the ways of
Godliness) tells us, 1 Cor. 15. 19. That if in this life only we had hope (that
is, were quite without hopes of a better life, then this present is) we
(Christians, such good Christians as he himself was) were of all men the most
miserable. The Heathen then (the Stoics especially) did well and wisely in
acknowledging How Virtue is a Reward to it self.
Felicity to consist in Virtue; in acknowleding Virtue to be a full recompense
to it self, in respect of any temporary evil or punishment, that could be
opposed unto it. They wisely resolved in holding them more happy which did
suffer torments for a good Cause, then they which made it a part of their
pleasure or happiness to torment them: Yet it is not possible that the entire
and uninterrupted possession, or the undisinheritable tenor of virtue complete,
should always in this life, be a sufficient recompense to it self, or able to
countervail all the costs or grievances wherewith the most virtuous, or most
Godly men that live, may in this life be charged. Virtue then or Godliness is
in this life a sufficient recompense to it self spe only, not re; so far as it
is the only Way to our union with God or with Christ, who is to all the sons of
Abraham (as he professed himself to Abraham Genesis 15. 1.) their exceeding great
reward. Nor could true Happiness consist in Virtue, if our hopes or fruition of
it might be terminated with this life. In what sense then is Felicity said to
consist in Virtue? Only so far as our assured hope of a better life after death
is unseparably annexed, and indissolubly wedded unto the constant practice of
Virtue and Godliness in this life. Without Assurance of this hope, that
Magnificent Confidence, which the Stoics put in Virtue, was but a vain
imagination in respect of themselves: And for this reason, albeit all of them
were more then Christians, Hyperbolical Christians in their speculative
commendations of Virtue, yet many of them were in practice as cowardly, as
other heathen. And no marvel, seeing it is This Hope which must strengthen
other Graces of God in us, and enable our spirits to countersway the contrary
inclinations of natural fear of death, or torments in the day of trial. Cast
not away your confidence (says the Apostle) Heb. 10. 35, 36 Which has great
recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the
Will of God, ye might receive the promise. And again Hebr. 12. ver. 1, 2. Let
us lay aside every weight, and the Sin which does so easily be et us; and let
us run with patience the race that is set before us; looking unto Jesus the
Author and finisher of our faith; who for the Joy that was set before him
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of
the throne of God. As to encourage our selves to do well with hope or conceit
of meriting any thing at Gods hand, is pride and presumption (a natural branch
of Popish Superstition:) So not to strengthen our selves, or quicken our
patience in the suffering of any bodily evils that for Christ's Cause can befall
us, with Hope of Reward, or certain expectance of a better Sentence to be
pronounced by a supreme Judge, is but a branch of the blind Stoics Affection,
or of his forced and affected Zeal to Virtue. And it is no better then a
Stoical Doctrine or error, which some have taught, that we are to do good
merely for goodness sake, sine intuitu mercedis, without any eye or respect to
our reward or recompense. It is an error, if it be persisted in, so much more
dangerously heretical in Divinity, then theirs was in Philosophy; by how much
we are more deeply bound, then they were, not to sever those things, by
Nicities or speculative Distinctions, which God has indissolubly conjoined,
Genesis 15. 1. Hebr. 11. 26. Philip. 3. 14. Heb. 12. 2. Romans 2. 7.
and whose conjunction the Son of God himself, whilst he lived on earth, has
by his practice and example ratified unto us. And St. Paul delivers it as a
point of useful doctrine to the Thessalonians, 1 These. 4. 13. to comfort
themselves against the terrors and assaults of death (whether made upon
themselves, or upon their friends) with hope of a resurrection to a better
life. Now it were impossible for any man to comfort himself with this hope,
without intuition or respect unto this great reward, that God has to bestow on
men. For greater reward he has none to bestow then Life eternal; nor is man
capable of any like unto it. But of this Point more fully, when we come to the
last point proposed, to wit, The Sentence or Award of this Final Judgment.

8. But now to shut up the First Point, concerning the natural Notions which
the heathens had (and The internal Experiments, which every true Christian may
have answering to these Notions) of a Final Judgment. The sum of all is
comprised by our Apostle, Romans 2. 14, 15, 16. whose words are a full
confirmation of what has been before observed concerning the Heathens. ( --
When the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in
the Law; these, having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves, which show the
work of the Law written in their hearts; their consciences also bearing
witness, and their thoughts the mean while, accusing, or else excusing one
another) In the day when God shall Judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
according to my Gospel. It was no part of our Apostles meaning, that the
Consciences of these heathens should not give in their Evidence or accusations
until the day of Final Judgment? No: their Evidence shall in that day appear
more full and public, when God shall Judge the secrets of the heart, but even
in this secrecy of the heart, there was an Evidence, though private, yet full
enough to themselves, of a Judgment to come. The Apostles speech is
distributively universal: every man's thoughts do accuse or excuse Notions of
Good and Evil as fresh as those of True and false.
him for all his own deeds respectively. And no marvel, seeing the Notions of
good and evil are as naturally implanted in our souls, as the Notions of truth
and falsehood; And children (so such as have the Tuition of them would be
careful, so their parents were not more delighted to ripen their wits, then to
ripen the seeds of morality) might as soon be taught to put a difference
betwixt things sacred and profane, as between the right hand and the left. But
this is our misery, that these Notions of good or evil are sooner
corrupted and choked, then our Notions of truth and falsehood. Yet however, The
working of Conscience cannot utterly be choked or deaded in any, although the
voice of it be often times unheard, although most men seek to stifle it.

9. The Internal Experiments which certify the Christian of a Judgment to
come, be so frequent and forcible, that pains will be better spent in
persuading men to take notice of them, then in a long discourse of them. It is
the chief wisdom of a Christian, the very life of Christian Sobriety, not to
exceed so much in mirth, though honest, harmless and in season; nor in the
frequency of any business, though indifferent and lawful; as not to allot the
secrets of our hearts and consciences some set hours and times for Audience.
Multiplicitie of business without interposition of vacancies to this purpose,
is but like perpetual noise and clamor in a Court of Justice; and not to use
some retired Interims for examination of our souls, is but as if men should
continually laugh or brawl, whilst the Officers of the Court enjoin peace or
silence. So often then as we shall perceive our Conscience either expressly to
check us, or inwardly to
work, let us still call to mind, that it now is in Executione Officii; and its
Office is, to be our Remembrancer of that which our Apostle admonishes us, 1
Cor. 11. 31. If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged. In this
Judgment or examination of our selves, Nature her self would teach us thus
much, so we would be observant of the Process; That seeing Conscience is not
only the Lamp of the Lord, but also a part of our selves, a principal Ray or
beam of our The Jealousy and inquisitiveness of Conscience, shows that it is
deputed by God as our visitor or supervisour.
souls, it could not be so suspicious of our actions, or so inquisitive after
every circumstance that may make against us when we do evil, unless it were
deputed by a supreme Judge to bring us to a Judgment, and either in this life
to acquit us, by persuading us to judge our selves, or in that last day to
accuse and condemn us. It would teach us again, That albeit there be a General
day for final Judgment appointed, wherein Christ himself shall sit as Judge;
yet he every day holds or calls, A private Sessions within our breasts, wherein
Conscience sits his Attorney or Deputy. Again, let us still remember, that
albeit the work of the Law be written in our hearts (so it was in the hearts of
the very heathens:) that albeit we give Conscience full Audience and leave to
examine us by the Law of God, whether written in our hearts, or in the sacred
Book; yet is it but a small part of our accounts, which we shall be able to
read in the Register of our own Consciences, in respect of what is to be found
written in that Book or Scrowl, which shall be opened and unfolded in the day
of final Judgment, Rev. 20. 12. Howbeit, even so much, as every man (which
will diligently hearken to his own Conscience) shall in this life be able to
read and hear distinctly, will make deep impression in his heart, and wound his
very spirit. And (as Solomon speaks) a wounded Spirit, who can bear? rather,
who can heal it? None but he that shall be our Judge. Yet may we not look that
when he shall come to judge all, he will vouchsafe to heal any. He heals all
our infirmities, as he is our High Priest, not as he is our Judge; And so
healed by him our Consciences must be in this life; otherwise the wound will
prove deadly and incurable in that last day. Nothing besides the wounds of
Christ can cure the wounds and sores of our spirits and consciences; Therefore
was he smitten and bruised, therefore was he wounded unto death, that his blood
poured forth might be as a Fountain of Oil or Balm to cure and heal the broken
hearted: For, The broken hearted only are his true Patients: All of us one
time or other must feel the sting of Serpents, more fiery then such as stung
the Israelites in the wilderness, even the sting of death, and of that old
Serpent (which, in our first Parents, envenomed our nature) before we can
thirst after this fountain of life, with that fervencie of spirit, which he
requires in his Patients; without this thirst thus occasioned by this sting of
conscience, and poison of sin in some measure apprehended by us, we cannot
drink the water of life, or suck in the balm of health and salvation, which
issued out of Christ's wounds in such a plentiful measure, as may cure the
festered wounds of our souls and consciences, and purge us from that
corruption, which we and our Fathers have sucked from our first Parents, or
contracted by the incessant overflow of our actual and daily sins.

10. Yet is not this apprehension of our actual and daily sins, or the smart or
sting of conscience so perpetually uncessant in any one of us, but that we may
feel or perceive some interposed gleams of joy and comfort, The Checks and
Gratulations of our Consciences, be tastes or pledges of the Twofold award
that shall be given at the last day.
some Gratulations of our Consciences for businesses sincerely managed by us,
or for those particular actions, or good deeds, which in respect of some one or
other circumstance, we have done amiss; but for their substance, well and with
a good intention, and without a sinister respect to our own private temporal
ends, or to the prejudice of others with whom we live. So that no man, unless
he be much wanting to himself, can want undoubted Experiments in himself of a
future and Final Judgment; or of the Twofold sentence, which in it shall be
awarded to all, according to the diversity of their ways: As often then as any
of us shall feel the sting, or perceive the check of our consciences for the
evils we have done, let us take this irksomness or indisposition of our minds
and souls, not for a mere effect of natural Melancholy (though that perhaps
may concur as a cause to increase our heaviness) but rather take all together,
as a Crisis of that disease growing upon our souls; which unless it be cured by
our heavenly Physician in this life, will prove incurable in that last and
dreadful day, and will bring upon us perpetual weeping, and wailing, and
gnashing of teeth: If our Consciences again at any time shall Congratulate us
for well doing, we may take these Congratulations or Applauses of our souls and
spirits, as so many undoubted pledges or earnests of that unspeakable and
uncessant joy, which the supreme Judge shall award to all, that by constancy in
well-doing acknowledge him for their Sovereign Lord, and expect him as their
supreme Judge: If we cease not to continue these good actions or performances,
he will not cease to renew the undoubted pledges or earnests of eternal Joy
unto us daily: For so S. Paul says, He will render to every man according to
his deeds: To them, who by patient continuance Romans 2. 6, 7, etc.
in well doing seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life: But
unto them that are contentious, indignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguish
etc.

11. The best use which the Heathens (as mere Heathens) made of such Notions,
as nature had implanted in them of a future Judgment; or rather their
misapplications of what nature did rightly suggest unto them, to this purpose,
The Heathen Notions of a final Judgment vanished like dreams.
cannot better be resembled then by the use or applications which men naturally
make of Dreams: Now of Dreams, some are vain and idle, as arising only from
the Garboils of the Fantasy (most frequent in men sick or distempered) or
from such thoughts, discourses, or speeches, as we have entertained by day, or
been entertained with for some short time before: Of these Dreams, and of their
serious observation, that of The Son of Sirach, Eccl. 34. 1, 2, 3. is most
true. The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false; and dreams
lift up fools. Who so regards dreams is like him, that catches at a shadow,
and follows after the wind. The vision of dreams is like the resemblance of
one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face. Howbeit, even
such Dreams may be resolved into some natural Causes precedent. Nor do men fail
in the apprehension of particulars represented (which is always more lively by
night, then by day) but in the application or composition of such
representations whilst they dream: This commonly is as imperfect or monstrous,
as if one should be able to name his Letters right, but not able to spell or
make a syllable otherwise then by rote or guess; or apt to put those syllables
ill-favouredly together, which he had severally spelled not much amiss.

Like to men's apprehensions of these Dreams were most speculations of the
Heathens concerning the truth, or manner of a final Judgment, or future
Resurrection; whose indefinite Notions Nature had implanted in their hearts. So
vain and idle they were for the most part in their Collections or applications
of what they conceived, that no more credence was to be given unto their
particular speculations or doctrine, then unto a sick man's apprehensions of his
present Dream. But however many of them did write and speak of a future
Judgment, more out of Art and imitation of others, then out of any solid
Experiments; yet was it not possible that the wits of all or most of them, of
the Ancients especially, should have been set a working in this Argument,
without some undoubted and experienced impulsions of nature seeking to lead or
drive them upon that Truth, which we Christians are expressly taught by a Better
Master then Nature.

12. Other Dreams there be, which are reputed natural, whose observation is
very useful; because they have real Causes in nature, and always exhibit A
Discourse about Dreams.
either a true Crisis or notice of men's present estate of body, or some right
Prognostics of some disease growing upon them, whose original or progress is
to their waking thoughts unsensible or unapprehended, Howbeit, the right
interpretation or signification of such suggestions or intimations, as nature
gives to men in Dreams, is usually unknown, or much mistaken for the present,
by the parties, to whom they are immediately made by nature; They must be
expounded or Judged of by the Physician, or Philosopher. Some men, no way
distempered nor disquieted in thought, have dreamed, that some part of their
Legs or Arms have been turned into a stone, or into an Icie substance. The
apprehension or composition was vain and false; yet not without a true and
observable Cause. The Physician did by the relation of the circumstances
perceive (as the Event did prove) a cold humor beginning to settle in that part
of the body, whose transformation was represented in the Dream; and gathered
withal, that the humor not thence removed would breed a numness or oppression
of the nerves in that part. Others often times dream (not from any thoughts or
discourses to that purpose) that they are flying in the air, or can jump from
one place to another, further distant then any man can conceive it possible for
himself, or other terrestrial creatures to leap or skip. The Philosopher or
Physician knows this, or the like representation made in sleep, not occasioned
from any late waking thoughts, to be a token of a clean stomach, of pure blood,
or lively spirits. Others, I have heard of, in the midst of their quiet sleep,
have suddenly cried out as if they had been stabbed under the ribs. Themselves
after they awaked, and such as heard them before they were awakt, knew the
conceit or apprehension to be altogether false, yet not vain or idle in respect
of the Cause or observation. The skilful Physician, from this their
mis-apprehension, rightly apprehended a salt humor violently distilling upon
the lungs, ready to breed a dangerous Consumption, whose removal would have
been more difficult, had not Nature given this imperfect advice or forewarning
for the speedy prevention of it: This secret advice, or forewarning of Nature,
was so much the more to be credited, because no occasion of any quarrel, no
thought or discourse tending to the representation of any such fear, had
presented it self to the waking thoughts of the party thus dreaming for a long
time before: Every real occasion of joy or fear, the very least annoyance or
pleasance, that can befall our bodies in night-sleep or slumber (as the
Philosopher long ago observed) is apt to misinform our Common sense (or
Judicative faculty) being now surprised by sleep, with representations or
conceits of the greatest delight or fear that is of the same kind with that
which is really represented; as if a drop of sweet phlegm do distill upon the
swallowing place, it raises an apprehension of honey, or other sweet meat, to
which the taste of the party thus dreaming has been accustomed; and from this
Original, hungry men in their sleep feed their Fantasies with apprehension of
pleasant Banquets. Abundance of choler ofttimes raises an apprehension of some
great fire: And nothing more common then for men, troubled with flux of Rheum
from the brain, to dream of drowning, or danger by floods or water: The least
oppression of the motive faculty, will occasion the Ephialtes or Gigas, that
affection which we commonly call The Mare. In all these and the like
affections, Nature does her part, however the Parties to whom she secretly
suggests these signs or tokens of their bodily estate or constitution, do for
the most part grossly err in their constructions of them, until they be
rectified or better instructed by the Physician or Philosopher, who only know
the natural causes of such representations by sleep, which is as a false glass,
wherein every thing appears much greater to the Fantasy, then in nature it
is, or would appear to our vigilant senses.

13. In like manner the best apprehensions or collections which the Heathens
made of those Real Notions, which are by nature implanted (of a Final
Judgment) were erroneous; their Doctrinal speculations or expressions, were no
better then an ignorant man's apprehension of his natural Dreams; howbeit, even
the speculations of such Heathens, as did most err in particular, do minister
much matter of true and useful Contemplation unto the Christian Divine, part of
whose office it is, or should be, to search the original of others errors,
whose rectification must be made by the Scripture, Though Heathen Notions were
like Dreams; Christian Divines may see realities of Truth in them.
which is the Rule of Life; without whose Aphorisms or directions, the
apprehension of natural Notions or Suggestions (even when they work most
strongly) would lead or push the Physicians of souls themselves into Heresy.

Of all the Sects of Heathen Philosophers the Sect of Epicures did seek most
earnestly to exempt themselves from the Jurisdiction, and their actions from
the Cognizance of A divine Providence; yet could they not so dead the working
of the Notion of it in themselves, or hood-wink their own understandings so
close, as not to apprehend or observe the working of it in others. Epicurus
himself, albeit he placed felicity in the moderate pleasures Touching Epicurus
See Book 10. fol. 3139.
of this life (though not in bodily pleasures only, for he was not so gross as
to exclude the delights or pleasures of the soul or mind, but rather required
a competency of bodily pleasures for the fruition of this delight:) yet,
however he failed in his apprehensions of felicity; or in his application of
those good Lessons, which Nature did suggest unto him, he found himself tied by
bond of Conscience to observe the Law of Nature: The Original of his positive
error, was an ignorance or blindness common to him and most Heathen in some
degree or other, in not being able to discern the corruption of nature from
Nature her self; or to distinguish between the suggestions or intimations of
Nature, as it sometimes was, and universally might have continued; and the
particular suggestions or longings of Nature, as it was corrupted or tainted in
himself or others, more or less in all. It was a Principle of his Doctrine, as
Seneca tells us, That Nature (which he professed to follow as his guide) did
abhor all vice or wickedness: It seems, he held those courses or habits of life
only vicious, which we Christians account unnatural or prodigious vices; as
Tyranny, Cruelty, or excessive Luxury. And such vices as these, the most
Heathens (whom corruption of Nature did lead blindfold into many grievous sins,
and cast such a mist before their eyes, as made unlawful pleasures appear unto
them as parts of true happiness) did by the light of Nature detest, as contrary
to the unapprehended Remnants or Relics of Gods Image yet inherent in them,
though mingled with Corruption, or much defaced with the Image of Satan.

But from what Grounds of Nature or Experiments did this Author or first
Founder of the Sect of Epicures collect, that Nature did detest all wickedness:
Thus he did reason and collect: Quia sceleratis etiam inter tuta timor est: How
Epicurus did collect. That Nature detested Vice.
Because he saw such as had polluted their Consciences with wicked and
prodigious practices, to live in fear, even whilst they seemed to have safety
her self for their guard against all external Occurrences, whose probable
assaults or annoyances, humane Policy could possibly forecast: And none more
subject to this slavish fear, which their Consciences did inwardly suggest,
then such as for their greatness and confidence in Tyranny and Cruelty were
most terrible to others. What was it then, which these men did so See the
conference betwixt Dionysius and Da^ocles, Tull. Tuscul. Lib. 5. And Philip
Comines, of Lewis the eleventh.
much fear? No other men, nor any revenge that man could attempt upon them:
What then? The company of themselves, or solitary conference with their own
Consciences: Yet no man's conscience can make his heart afraid, unless the
conscience it self be first affrighted: What is it then which the consciences
of supreme earthly Judges, or Monarchs absolute by right of Conquest, can so
much fear in the height of their temporal security? The Censure (doubtless) or
check of some superior Judge: If this fear had been vain, or but a speculative
Fancy, it could not have been uinversal or general in all or most wicked men,
specially in such as were by nature terrible and stout, and wary withal to
prevent all probabilities of danger from men. Yet was this check of Conscience,
or this unknown Doom or Censure (which See Wisdom 17. ver. 11. See Juvenal.
Set. 13.
Conscience, whilst it checked the hearts of wicked men, did so much fear) so
universal and constant, that Epicurus, a man of no scrupulous Conscience, did
observe it to be implanted by nature in all; and upon this observation did
ground his former general Principle, That nature her self did abhor or detest
wickedness: The suggestion then or intimation of a future Judgment was
natural; but the apprehension or construction which Epicurus made of these
suggestions, was but such as ordinary men make of representations in natural
Dreams, before they be thoroughly awaked, or before they consult the Philosopher
or Physician. The Christian Truth, which nature in these Heathens (being in
respect of any supernatural use or end of her own suggestions, altogether dumb)
did seek by these signs or intimations to express, was that Lesson which the
Author of nature, and great Physician of our souls has expressly taught us,
Fear not them, which after they have killed the body, can do no more; but fear
him who is able to cast both body and soul into Hell fire; yea, I say unto you,
fear him, Matthew. 10. 28. Luke 12. 4.

14. As the wicked amongst the Heathens could not by any earthly Guard or
greatness, exempt themselves from that Dread or Fear, which their corrupt
Consciences did internally suggest: So that confident Boldness, which the
integrity of conscience does naturally suggest unto every man in his laudable
actions, was sometimes represented by the more civil and sober sort of
Heathens, after a manner more magnificent, and in a measure more ample, then it
usually is by most Christians: Their expressions or conceits of such
confidence, as integrity of conscience does arm men withal, did as far exceed
our ordinary apprehensions of it, as the representations of natural Causes
working within us, which are made unto us in sleep or dreams, do our waking
apprehensions of the like workings or suggestions of nature. Si Fractus
illabatur orbis, (says Horace, a professed Disciple of Epicurus, Carm. Lib. 3.
Ode 3.) impavidum ferient ruinae: Albeit the Heavens should rend assunder See
Horace, Epist. Lib. 1. Epist. 1.
above his head, and this inferior world break in pieces about his ears, yet a
man of an entire and sound conscience would stand unmoved, unaffrighted, like a
--. Hic murus abenev^ esto, Nil conscire sibi --
pillar of brass or marble, when the roof which it supporteth were blown away
or fallen from it: This Hyperbolical expression of that Confidence, which
integrity of Conscience in some measure always affords, was in this Heathen (if
he had been put upon the trial) but as the representation of a man's bodily
estate made in a Dream, whose true cause is unknown unto the Dreamer. As in men
that dream, so in this Heathen Poet, the apprehension of that which Nature did
truly and really suggest, is most full and lively; but full and lively in both,
without Judgment, without true use or right application: That Confidence then
is the companion of a good Conscience, is a truth implanted by Nature, and
freely acknowledged by the oppugners of Divine Providence. But from what
original or fountain this truth should issue, or to what comfortable Use it
might serve, were points which Nature could not distinctly teach; or points at
least, which the mere natural man without help of Scriptures, or instructions
from those Heavenly Physicians of the soul, whom God has appointed
Interpreters of this Book of life, could not learn: But we Christians know and
believe, that when the Heavens shall be gathered as a Scroul, when the Elements
shall melt with heat, and when the earth shall be removed out of his Psalm 3.
6. and 23. 4. and 27 1. and 46 1. Prove. 28. 1. Wisd. 5. 1.
place; that even in the midst of these terrible spectacles, such as have their
Consciences purified by Faith, shall lift up their heads for joy, as knowing
these and the like to be undoubted Prognostics or fore-running signs of their
Redemption drawing nigh unto them. A Crisis (rather a kind of First Fruits) of
this Holy Confidence, was most remarkably attested to have been in the
Primitive Christians. So Antoninus the Emperor (as in our 1. Book, chap. 24.
out of Eusebius his 4. Book of Hist. Eccles. chap. 13. we did observe) did
report of Them to the Asiaticks, who slandered and persecuted them: Take
notice, says he, of the late and daily Earthquakes, compare our estate with
theirs; They (he means Christians) have more confidence to Godward then you
have.

15. This was The solid Truth, whose liveless Lineaments, or obscure Picture,
nature had drawn unto the Heathen in the former indefinite Notions or
Suggestions: The best fruits of a good conscience, the principal end why we are
to study and labor for the preservation of our Consciences void of offense
toward God and man, throughout the whole course of our life, is, that we may
be enabled in that last day to stand without horror or confusion before the Son
of Man. As peace of conscience breeds confidence; so the only Fountain
whence this peace of conscience can issue, must be our reconciliation to that
supreme Judge, whose doom or Censure the Consciences of mere natural men,
implicitly or by instinct of Nature dread; albeit they cannot apprehend the
express manner of the Judgment to come, or who it is that shall be Judge: Both
these, and all like points which are necessary unto true Christian Faith, must
be learned out of the Book of Life.

Thus much of the First General, viz. Heathen Notions of a Judgment to come,
etc. we proceed to the second, according to the method proposed in the 9th
Chapter.

CHAP. XI. By what authority of Scripture the Exercise of this Final Judgment
is appropriated unto our Lord Jesus Christ.
1. THat there was to be a Judgment general to all, but most terrible to the

wicked and ungodly, was a Truth revealed before any part of the sacred Books
now extant were written: But if it be a Revelation more ancient then the
written Canon, what warrant can we have to believe it besides Tradition? Is
then Tradition a sufficient warrant for us to believe unwritten verities, or
Revelations made to Gods Saints for many thousand years ago? It is not, unless
the Tradition be expressly avouched by some Canonical Writer; But then it, or
rather the Vouchers authority concerning the truth of the Tradition, is to be
believed: So that our Belief in this Point, must be resolved into a written
verity, or a parcel of Canonical Scripture.

The Revelation concerning the final Judgment, whereof we now speak, was made
to Enoch before the Flood: The Avoucher of this Revelation is St. Jude. ver.
14, 15. And Enoch also the seventh from Adam, prophesied of It was foretold by
Enoch.
these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousand of his Saints; To
execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of
all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their
hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him: Besides the
authority of St. Jude, which makes this Tradition to be no more a mere
Tradition, but Canonical Scripture; we have other more special Grounds to
believe that Enoch did thus Prophecy, then we have to believe any other
pretended Revelations, which are not contained in Scripture.

The truth and certainty of this Judgment denounced by Enoch was so publicly
and notoriously known, that the Hebrew Church before our Saviors incarnation,
did begin the Writ or Instrument of their Great and terrible Excommunication
with the first words of Enochs Prophecy, Dominus veniet, the Lord See Book 10.
Chap. 38. number. 11. p. 3171.
shall come. As if they meant to bind the party whom they excommunicated
(besides all other punishments or infamies) over to this Grand Assize. But is
there in this Prophecy any particular character of Christ? Any pregnant
intimation that this Great Judge of the world should be the Second Person in
the Trinity, rather then The First? In the words themselves there is no
peculiar Character of Christ, save only in The Title LORD; which (as we said
before) is peculiar to Christ; whether it be in the Original expressed by the
word Jehovah, or Adonai; whenever Judgment, or visible exercise of
Jurisdiction Regal, is the subject or matter of the prophetical discourse, as
in this Prophecy of Enoch it is. Besides this Character in the words of the
prophecy, the Prophet himself, Enoch, was a lively Type of Christ the great
Prophet, in the very ground of his Title to Lordship and Jurisdiction. Enoch
was Enoch a lively Type of Christ
translated that he should not see death; but before his translation had this
testimony, that he Pleased God; Hebr. 11. 5. Before his Translation he
denounced this Woe or Curse against all, that continue in ungodliness, fore
warning the world withal, that the Lord himself, whose Ambassador he was,
should come to put his Embassage in execution. The congruity of the Fact or
Type with the Body fore-shadowed, implies, that this Propheeie was then to be
fulfilled, after the Prince of Prophets had been translated, as Enoch was from
earth (but in a higher degree then Enoch was) into heaven it self. And albeit
before his translation he had a more ample Testimony then Enoch had (this is my
Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased) yet was he not made Lord, and King, and
Judge, till after his Resurrection and Translation. From that time, the Angels,
and Principalities, and Powers, even all the Host of Heaven intimated by
Enoch, became (by that Title) subject unto him. That Christ is that very Lord,
against whom those ungodly men whom Enoch mentions, did speak such bitter
words; our Apostle St. Paul, though obscurely, yet fully implies, in the
conclusion of his first Epistle to the Corinthians, chapt. 16. 22. If any man
love not the Lord Jesus, let him be Anathema (...), that is, Let him be
accursed or excommunicated with that Great and terrible Excommunication (...);
that is, the Lord shall come; for so they call their Excommunication, as we do
Writs, by the first words of the Writ or Instrument; and these were the first
words of Enochs Prophecy; Veniet Dominus, The Lord shall come. The full
meaning or implication of the Apostle is; That whosoever does not love the Lord
Jesus, shall be liable to all the Judgments or Woes denounced by Enoch against
the hard speeches of ungodly Sinners, which they have spoken against their Lord
and Judge.

2. That God is Judge of all the Earth, that there shall be a final Judgment
generally awarded to all the Inhabitants of the Earth by God himself; the
Testimonies of the Old Testament, That God, That Christ shall be Judge.
places of the old Testament are infinite. I shall only touch the principal or
more pregnant testimonies to this purpose. To begin with the First. Genesis 18.
22. When the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom,
Abraham stood yet before The Lord, and drawing near, he said; will thou also
destroy the righteous with the wicked? ver. 23. And again ver. 25. To slay the
righteous with the wicked, and, that the righteous should be as the wicked,
that be far from thee; Shall not The Judge of all the Earth do right? Thus he
spoke in the case of Sodom, whose Judgment this Lord and Judge of all the earth
was then ready to put in execution. Now this Judgment of Sodom was but as a
Private or Particular Sessions to give the world an undoubted pledge of that
General and Terrible Judgment, which must be given upon all such as they were,
by the same Lord's visible appearance, before whom Abraham did now appear as
Advocate or Intercessor for these men of Sodom. So St. Jude instructs us, Ver.
6, 7. And the Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the
Judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the Cities about
them, in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire. There were Three in number which then appeared unto Abraham under the
shape and likeness of men; yet to his apprehension more then Men, Angels of the
Lord, or the Lord Himself in a Trinity of Angels representing the Blessed
Trinity; in which, as Athanasius tells us, there are not three Lords, but one
Lord; Yet, though there be but one Lord Jehovah, and though the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost be This One Lord; yet (as we said, Chap. 6. 7.) The Son of God
is Adonai or (...), The Lord or Judge by peculiar Title; and by such personal
Right, as God the Father, and God See Book 7. Chap. 36.
the Holy Ghost is not Lord and Judge: And for this reason, albeit there were
Three that appeared to Abraham, yet Abraham directs his speech unto One, as
unto his Lord; and this Lord did vouchsafe his answer unto Abraham after the
men which appeared unto him turned their faces thence, and went toward Sodom.

Other Testimonies to this purpose are most frequent in the book of Psalms,
Psalm. 50. 1, 2, 3. The mighty God, even the Lord, has spoken, and called the
Earth from the rising of the Sun unto the going down of the same. Out of Sion
the perfection of beauty God has shined. Our God shall come, and shall not
keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous
round about him. And ver. 6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness,
for God is Judge himself. Psalm. 93. 1, 2. The Lord reigns, he is clothed with
Majesty, the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he has girded himself:
The world also is established, that it cannot be moved. Thy Throne is
established of old, thou art from everlasting. Every Throne or Tribunal is
established for execution of Judgment: But this Throne, though established of
old or from Eternity, yet was not the Judgment, for which this Throne was
established, executed from eternity, or so executed at any time before the Date
of this Psalm, as the Psalmist expected in due time, or at the end of time it
would be. And the Author of the next Psalm (whether the same or some other)
conceives a solemn prayer for the speedy execution of that Judgment, which was
to proceed from the former Throne, which had been established from everlasting,
and to be executed by that God, to whose honor the former Psalm was
consecrated. O Lord God (says the Psalmist, Psalm. 94. 1, 2, 3, 4.) to whom
vengeance belongs, O God, to whom vengeance belongs show thy self; lift up
thy self, thou Judge of the Earth; render a reward to the proud. Lord, how long
shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? how long shall they utter
and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? To
omit other testimonies to the like purpose; This one Observation is general to
all; As the Messiah, who was first promised, and but Promised only, to Adam,
was afterward Promised by Oath to Abraham, It was revealed by degrees, That
Christ should be Judge.
and to David, and by them to all mankind; So this future general Judgment,
which was first revealed, for ought we read, to Enoch, afterward known to
Abraham, and to David, and to the Psalmists (were they one or more) was
afterward confirmed by the Oath of God himself unto the Prophet Esaias, Cap. 45.
ver. 22, 23. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth; for I am
God, and there is none else. I have sworn by my self, the word is gone out of
my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return; that unto me every knee shall
bow, every tongue shall swear.

3. All these Testimonies are Concludent, that God is Judge of all the earth,
and that there shall be A final Judgment executed by God himself. But the Point
wherein the Reader (as I suppose) expects satisfaction, is, From what
authentic Testimony of Scripture it is, or may be made as clear and evident,
that This final Judgment shall be personally executed by the Son of God, or by
the Man Christ Jesus. As much as to this purpose can be required is avouched by
our Apostle St. Paul, Romans 14. 11. It is written; as I live (says the Lord)
Every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. The written
Testimony which he avoucheth, is That before last cited, Esaias 45. 23. And from
this Testimony he infers these Two Conclusions, the Former, ver. 10. (which is
the same with 2 Cor. 5. 10.) We shall all stand before the Judgment seat of
Christ; The Later, ver. 12. So then every one of us shall give an account of
himself to God. The Issue or Corollary of both Two Conclusions. one Corollary.
Conclusions is, That Jesus Christ is that Lord and God which had interposed
his Oath unto the Prophet Esaias, that every knee should bow unto him. This Issue
of both Conclusions, Romans 14. is more fully expressed, Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11.
Wherefore God also has highly exalted him, and given him a Name, which is
above every name, that at the name of JESUS every knee should bow, of things in
heaven, and things on the earth, and things under the earth: and that every
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

But for more full satisfaction, some here may justly Demand: Whether St. Paul
did make this interpretation of the Prophet Esaias by some new Revelation of the
Spirit made in particular to him, unknown to most others before that time? Or
whether the interpretation of the Prophet Esaias, and of other like prophecies
which he made, were literally and really included in the prophecies themselves,
and ratified by the General Analogy of Faith, or by the Common Rule of
interpretation in those times sufficiently known to the learned, whose eyes
were not blinded with passion, nor prejudiced with partiality to their own
Sects or Factions?

To this we Answer, that St. Paul's Interpretation of the Prophet was really
included in the literal sense of the Prophecy, and the literal sense or
construction, which he made of the forecited passage in the Prophet Esaias, and
other Prophets, was warrantable by the Common Rule of Interpretation
sufficiently known in those times.

The Rule is General; That all those places of the old Testament, which An
useful General Rule.
intimate either a new manner of Gods governing the world, or a beginning of
his reign over all Nations, or of being made Lord and King, or of arising to
Judge the earth, must be meant of God incarnate, that is, of the Son of God
begotten before all worlds, and begotten again from the dead. For as the Son of
God by his death and resurrection became our Lord by a peculiar Title; So he
was from the ground of the same Title appointed Judge of quick and dead by a
peculiar and personal right. This is more often and more Emphatically intimated
by our Savior Christ, and by his Apostles, then observed by many of their
professed Interpreters. First by St. Peter, Acts 10. 40, 41, 42. Him God raised
up the third day, and showed him openly, not unto all the people, but unto
witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him
after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people, and
to testify, that it is he, which was ordained of God to be the Judge of the
quick and the dead. And again by St. Paul, Acts 17. 30, 31. And the times of
this ignorance God winked at, but now commands all men every where to repent:
because he has appointed a day, in the which he will Judge the world in
righteousness, by that man, whom he has ordained; whereof he has given
assurance unto all men in that he has raised him from the dead. But more fully
by the same St. Paul, Romans 14. 9. To this end Christ both died, and rose, and
revived, that he might he Lord both of the dead and living. In this Collection
from the Prophet Esaias he says no more, then our Savior has done, John 5. 21,
22. For as the Father raises up the dead, and quickens them, even so the Son
quickens whom he will. For the Father Judges no man, but has committed all
Judgment unto the Son.

4. But the Former Question still revolves upon the same Center that it did
before. The Point or Center is This; Whether St. Peter, or St. Paul, or whether
our Savior himself did deliver the doctrine forecited from that authority
only, which was delegated to them from God, within that compass of time,
wherein they did converse with men here on earth? or whether the doctrine,
which they then delivered, were fully ratified by Divine Authority revealed and
written before? To this we Answer, that our Savior Himself in all his Christ's
Answers to the Jews were but Comments upon the Prophets
Answers to the Jews did but Comment upon, or expound those Texts of holy
Scripture, which he had put into his Prophets mouths long before he himself
had spoken with the mouth of man. One of the most pregnant Texts of the Old
Testament is Psalm. 82. 1, 2. God stands in the congregation of the mighty, he
judges among the Gods: How long will ye Judge unjustly, and accept the persons
of the wicked? I have said ye are Gods; and all of you are children of the most
High; but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes: that is,
like any Princes amongst the Heathen: And dying and falling thus, they could
not expect that they were to rise again to Judge others, but rather to be
Judged by God himself, or by him that was the Son of the most High in another
manner then they were: who though he were to die as man, yet did he not cease
to be the Son of God by his death: Yea, He was declared to be The only Son of
God with Power, by His Resurrection from the Dead. And out of this hope of his
future resurrection, the Psalmist for Conclusion, being as it seems oppressed
with corruption of Judgment, appeals unto the supreme Judge as well of the dead
as of the living. Arise O God, Judge the earth for thou shall inherit all
Nations, ver. 8. He does not say, Thou do inherit all Nations, or thou art
already set in Judgment; but arise O God to Judge the earth, for thou shall
inherit all Nations. So that the ground or Title of his universal Jurisdiction
or judicature is his Inheritance of all Nations, and his Title of Inheritance
over all Nations bears date, or began to be in Esse from the day of his
Resurrection; as you heard before out of St Paul, Romans 14. And was before him
expressly foretold by the Prophet David, Psalm. 2. 7, 8, 9. I will declare the
Decree; the Lord has said unto me, Thou art my Son; This day have I begotten
thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession, Thou shall break them with
a rod of Iron; thou shall dash them in pieces like a potters vessel. This
Decree was executed, this promise performed, when, All Power in Heaven and
Earth was given unto Christ: Matthew. 28. 18.

5. To omit all further variety of Testimonies; No other Article in our Creed
is, or can be so authentickly testified, as This One Article of Christ's coming
to Judgment is. Besides that it was expressly and distinctly foretold by the
Prophets, and the fulfilling of their prophecies expressly avouched by the
Evangelists and the Apostles, the Truth of it was in special manner sealed by
the blood of this Great Judge himself. The only matter of death, which the
malicious wit of his enemies could invent or pretend against him, A main Branch
of That Good Confession, which Christ witnessed, was, His Title to be Judge.
was from his voluntary Confession of this Article, in the same Form or Terms
wherein we profess our Belief of it. For, as you may read Matthew. 26. 59. After
the High Priest and Elders had found, that the Witnesses suborned against him
did not agree in their testimonies, or else (which is more probable) that their
testimonies, though well agreeing, did not amount to any matter Capital: the
High Priest seeks to entangle him in his own Answers to This Interrogatory: I
adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, whether thou be The Christ,
the Son of God, ver. 63. Our Savior confesses the Article or Interrogatory;
For so much is answered, at least in the next words, Thou have said it,
Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of Man sitting on
the right hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven.

This Adversative Particle [Nevertheless] has much troubled some Interpreters;
and some, to ease themselves of further trouble, would have it The Adversative
Particle Nevertheless.
to be no Adversative, but an Affirmative: As to their apprehensions the Hebrew
Ac (whereof the Greek (...) in this place is the expression) in many places of
the Old Testament, is an Affirmative, no Adversative Particle.

But it were easy to show them wherein their Observations fail. The difficulty
of the Construction in this place may be Two ways salved; either 1. by filling
up this Hiatus or chink in St. Matthew, with the words of our Saviors answer,
which St. Luke relates: Or 2. by borrowing this Adversative Particle from St.
Matthew, and adding it unto St. Luke's Relation.

Unto the former Question; Art Thou The Christ? Our Savior in the morning
answered, If I tell you, you will not believe, Luke 22. 67. And it is probable
our Saviors words related by St. Matthew; thou say it, include as much, as
if he had said; Thy Conscience tells thee, though thou will not hearken to it,
nor believe it, that I am Christ the Son of God; but howsoever you will not now
believe it, nevertheless hereafter you shall be enforced to acknowledge it.
Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and
coming in the Clouds of Heaven. Then the High Priest rent his clothes, saying;
he has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Indeed if the
matter which he confessed had been truly Capital, his own confession, being
made before a competent Judge, had been a sufficient and full conviction
without any further witness. But there was nothing in his Answer which,
according to these Highpriests Rules or Principles, could bear so much as the
least color or appearance of any Crime, much less of Blasphemy; unless their
hearts had been infected with malice against his Person.

They now condemn him of Blasphemy in their own Court, And yet immediately
after they accuse him of Treason in the Roman Court, for saying The blasphemous
and treacherous Jews condemn Christ of Treason and Blasphemy.
he was the King of the Jews: Their accusation in both was so grossly malicious,
that it did plainly reverberate or reflect upon themselves; For if to be King
of the Jews were Treason against the Roman State, then the Highpriests and
Elders with all their accomplices were traitors; because they expected their
Messiah to be a temporal King, greater then Caesar. But such is their malice
against Jesus of Nazareth, that rather then he should be acknowledged for their
Messiah, they would make their Messiah a traitor, and their own doctrine
concerning him to be treason. Rather then they will acknowledge Jesus of
Nazareth to be the Son of God, or the Son of man, appointed to be the Judge of
quick and dead, they will make their Messiah to be a Blasphemer, and the
Prophets doctrine concerning his Personal Office to be blasphemy: for if the
vail of malice had been removed from their hearts, or if they had not looked
upon our Saviors Answer through it, there is no branch or part of this Answer,
which was not distinctly and expressly foretold by the Prophets. As, That their
expected Messiah should be both the Son of God, and the Son of Man, and the
Judge of all the earth; First, David had said of their Messiah; Sit thou on my
right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool, Psalm. 110. 1. Here was
the Seat of his Judgment prepared at the right hand of Power. His Coming
likewise in the clouds as the Son of Man to the Ancient of days to receive
this Power and Jurisdiction is expressly foretold by Daniel, Chap. 7. ver. 13.
And was it not now full time that God, as the Psalmist before had prayed, Psalm.
82. 8. should arise to Judge the earth, when as malice had so far perverted the
Judgment of the children of God, of Moses and Aarons Successors, that they had
adjudged the Son of God to death for avouching himself to be the Judge of the
quick and the dead.

6. The Particular Duties, whereunto the Belief of this Article does
unpartially The Application.
bind all, may be pressed upon the soul of the Reader with better opportunity,
when we come unto the later General branches proposed; viz. the Process or
Sentence. The most general fruit which this Second Branch affords, is Comfort
in oppression, or when Judgment either publicly, or in our own particular is
perverted.

Tully, that famous Orator and great Statesman, seeing his Country laws and
privileges overthrown, and his Country brought into Slavery by Augustus,
writes unto the Emperor, that he for his part would leave this world, and
prefer a complaint against him unto the Decii and Curii, Ancient Romans which
had laid down their lives for the Liberty of their Country long before. Thus to
desire rather to die, then to behold the evil, which was likely to befall that
goodly and flourishing Commonweal, was not amiss, not (in it self)
unchristian. For so God in mercy takes away good and merciful men before he
begin to execute his severe and public Judgments upon any So God took away the
Author of this Book some 16. or 17. years ago.
Land, lest they should see the evil to come. And out of the strength of this
good desire perhaps it was, that Tully, albeit he had been noted for
timorousness in his prosperity, did entertain a violent death with manly and
Christianlike Courage. But alas, what a miserable comfort was it, which he
could hope for from Decius or Curious, or from any of his deceased Predecessors,
whom he knew not where, or in what estate to find? With what constancy and
patience would this man have maintained a just Cause, specially his Countries
right, whether by living or dying, if his heart had been fraught with Belief or
hopes of finding so wise, so gracious, so upright and powerful a Judge, as we
acknowledge Christ Jesus the Son of God to be. If he be for us, what can be
against us? If he be pleased to heal us, what wounds can hurt us? If he acquits
us, what Sentence or condemnation can prejudice us? The Heathen Poet and
Epicurean Philosopher had observed;

Integer vitae scelerisque purus, Horace Carm lib.

Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu: etc. 1. Ode. 22.

That there could be no weapons, whether offensive or defensive, so useful, as
integrity of life, and soundness of Conscience. He that was thus armed, needed
no other armor or weapons. This was but a dreaming apprehension of that
Confidence, which our Apostle deduceth from its true original, Romans 8. ver. 31.
to 37. In all these things we are more then Conquerors. I do not herein dissent
from them: And I could wish they would not herein dissent from me;

7. I know a great many ready to derive this Confidence from the doctrine of
Election or Predestination. but think, that their persuasions of their own
Election and Predestination are but vain and merely Jewish, unless in all their
troubles and oppressions they become like unto their supreme Judge in these Two
Points: First in the Integrity or uprightness of the Cause, for which they
suffer oppressions or grievances; Secondly in suffering grievances though
openly wrongful with Meekness and It is (...) this was preac^'d at Newcastle,
where he was Vicar diverse years.
Patience. A Lesson most necessary for these times, though hard to learn in
this and neighbor places; Many (I dare not say all, or most part) of whose
Inhabitants are of that disposition and education, that they neither know how
to entertain wholesome Justice or Government, with that obedience and respect
which they owe unto it; nor can brook any injustice or error in judgment,
though executed by their lawful Magistrates or Superiors, without intemperate
speeches, undecent opposition, or unmannerly Censure. Yet let me tell them,
that this proneness to speak evil of Dignities and Dominions, whether
Ecclesiastic or Temporal, is one of those grievous sins, whereof, as St. Jude
intimates, the supreme Judge will take special notice in that day; and the
harborers of it, without repentance, shall have a large portion of the woe or
curse denounced by Enoch: There is no sin, for its quality, more opposite to
Justice, or that can more provoke a just and gracious Judge, then intrusion
into his Office without Warrant or Commission; and yet so they all do, that
without warrant will become Magistrates, or Censurers, or Judges of others.
Such as affect the name of Zealous Professors in our times, cannot more
directly impeach themselves of gross Hypocrisy, then by nursing this censuring
humor in themselves, orr applauding it in others, whilst they profess to
believe this Article, of appearing before the Judgment seat of Christ: The
Belief whereof, were it true or sound, would not suffer this censorious humor,
of all others whatsoever, to lodge in the same breast with it, as being most
directly opposite unto it, most incompatible with it.

Nor did our Apostle St. Paul himself know any other Medicine or possible cure
of this Malady, then the pressing this Article upon such as were tainted with
it: Who art thou (says he, Romans 14. 4.) that judge another man's servant? to
his own Master he stands or falls: What more would you have said (or have
left un-said) to such, as take upon them to judge or censure their lawful
Magistrates and Pastors? And again, ver. 10. Why do thou judge thy brother?
or why do thou set at naught thy brother? seeing we shall all stand before
the Judgment seat of Christ; and ver. 12. So then every one of us shall give
an account of himself to God: As for the Magistrate, or such as have taken the
charge of souls upon them, they must give an account to God, not of themselves
only, but of others committed to their charge; but their flock or inferiors
are not bound to give account of them; and for this reason, should in
conscience be more ready to be directed or censured by them, then to direct or
judge their Actions.

8. The former Point might pass without further Addition or Annotation, were it
not that a late Divine of deserved note, seems to deny the place avouched, Dan.
7. 13. to be literally meant of a final Judgment; of which, if it were not
literally meant, our Saviors Allegation of it was not concludent; The literal
meaning of Dan. 7. 13. enquired.
nor should the conviction of the High Priest, for giving wrong Judgment upon
our Savior, be so notorious and manifest as we suppose it to be, and at the
last day it will appear: The prejudice of one modern Divines authority in a
Negative of this nature cannot be great, especially seeing this Negation is
grounded only upon an inconsiderate or careless Inference: This place of
Daniel (says he) is literally meant of Christ's ascending to his Father, and of
his investiture in the Kingdom of Heaven: This no man denies. And necessary it
was that he should ascend into Heaven, and be established in his Throne, before
he came to the accomplishment of Jurisdiction Royal; such is the exercise or
execution of final Judgment: The Argument then will hold much better
Affirmatively, then Negatively: The forecited place of Daniel is literally
meant of Christ's Ascension and Enthronization; Ergo, it is principally meant of
the execution of final Judgment, of such a Judgment as is to reverse or
rectify whatsoever has been wrongfully done or adjudged by the most potent
Monarchs or supreme Tribunals of the earth: So it is expressly foretold, Dan. 2.
44, 45. That this Kingdom, whereof the Son of Man did take possession, should
destroy or break in pieces the Babylonian, the Persian, the Macedonian, and the
Roman Monarchy, with all their appurtenances and attendances, or relics: And
in the days of these Kings shall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom, which
shall never be destroyed, and the Kingdom shall not be left to other people,
but it shall break in pieces and consume all these Kingdoms, and it shall stand
for ever: Forasmuch as thou saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain
without hands, and that it brake in pieces the Iron, the brass, the clay, the
silver and gold; the great God has made known to the King what shall come to
pass hereafter, and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

To omit all Question, how Christ's Kingdom here foretold, being not erected
till the Roman Monarchy was at the height, should destroy the Babylonian, the
Persian, or the Macedonian Monarchy, all which three were in the wane before
the Roman was Crescent; Certain it is, that the Roman Monarchy being at the
height when Christ ascended, was to be destroyed by him, yet not destroyed at
his Ascension. The Case then is clear, that the forementioned Prophecy of
Daniel cannot be terminated by the time of our Saviors Ascension, but is to be
extended to all succeding ages, yea after time shall be no more. If the
Kingdom, whereof Christ at his Ascension took possession, be for duration
everlasting, for power most Sovereign; so absolute and independent, that all
other Kingdoms which have been, are, or shall be, depend on it, and are
responsible to it; the execution of all Judgment, whether past or to come,
whether temporal or eternal, must either be ratified or reverst, or immediately
awarded by This everlasting King.

Polanus himself, (the principal Author or Abettor of the former Opinion,
Polanus his restriction of Dan. 7. 13. to Christ's Ascension.
viz. That the place of Dan. 7. 13. is not literally meant of Christ's coming to
Judgment) grants, That the Kingdom, whereof Christ at his Ascension took
possession, shall be consummate in the life to come, and not before; And in
granting thus much, he is concluded to grant withal, that the former places are
principally or consummatly meant of Christ's coming to Judge the World, and to
translate the Kingdom of God begun here on earth, into the Heaven of Heavens;
in which, so translated, all shall be Kings, all shall be Judges, all shall be
perpetual Laws unto themselves; there shall be no place for after Judgment,
especially for any sentence of condemnation.

9. To let the former mis-interpretation of the Prophet Daniel pass as a
private error, or oversight rather, which wants the general consent, as well of
the Roman Church, as of the Reformed; it is now (God be praised) on all hands
agreed on, and acknowledged by the best learned of both Churches, that many
places of the Old Testament are literally and truly meant both of Christ's first
coming in humility to be judged of men, and of his second coming in glory One
Prophecy may in the literal sense have two verifications; yea, contrary
senses, lib. 7. cap. 17.
to give Judgment upon the world: And not of these two Periods of times only,
but of all the times intermediate or interjacent: Howbeit, of these times only
Inchoative; consummately, finally, or punctually of the life to come, which
takes beginning from the last Judgment. That this place of Dan. 7. is
Inchoative meant of Christ's first coming; that is, that it first began
literally to be verified then, but shall not be consummated or fulfilled until
the last Judgment, or in the life to come, is acknowledged and well observed
by a late learned Jesuit: And this Interpretation being proffered by a man of
that profession, I entertain the rather, because it affords us a facile and
commodious interpretation of all or most of those places (whether in the Old
Testament or in the New) which the Romish Church, the Jesuits in special insist
upon, for the glorious Prerogatives of the visible Church, and of the visible
Roman Church above all Churches visible.

How many instances soever or places they bring, whether general for the
visible or militant Church, or for the glory of the Roman Church in special;
this One Answer will give satisfaction to all: They are meant of the visible or
militant Church Inchoative, but of the Church triumphant, Consummative: An
answer to all Texts b^ought for the Rom: Churches great Glory; by distinction,
Inchoative and Completive. See chap. 12.. 8.
They are meant of the visible or militant Church indefinitely; that is, some
particular members of the visible Church, have undoubted pledges or earnests of
those glorious promises in this life, which notwithstanding shall not be either
universally, punctually, or solidly accomplished, save only in the members of
the Church triumphant.

Christ's Church (whether we consider it as militant or triumphant) is an
essential or integral part of his Kingdom; and as his Kingdom, so his Church,
has its first plantation or beginning here on earth: Both have a right or
interest in the glorious promises made to the Church universal; neither Church
nor Kingdom here on earth can have entire possession of the blessings or
prerogatives promised, until it be given them by the Great King at the day of
Final Judgment. Of this rank is that prophecy, Jer. 31. 34. And they shall
teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, know
the Lord; for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest
of An Exposition of Jerem. 31. 34.
them, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
their sin no more. This Place (no man denies) was literally verified in the
Effusion of the Holy Ghost upon our Saviors Ascension; But shall not be
punctually and solidly fulfilled until the day of Judgment be past: Then the
true members of Christ's Church shall neither need Tradition, nor the written
Word, they shall be all immediately taught of God, and have his Laws most
perfectly and indeliblely written in their hearts. The gates of hell shall not,
then, in any wise prevail against them, not so far as to annoy their bodies or
interrupt their peace and happiness. Of this entire happiness and perfection,
the Church Militant had a pledge or earnest in the effusion of the Holy Ghost,
and all that be true Members of Christ's Church, have a superficial draught or
picture of this entire happiness in their hearts. But Christ at his Ascension
was so far from annulling the use of preaching, or teaching one another, that,
as the Apostle tells us, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13. He gave some Apostles, and some
Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, (more
extraordinary, then any had been during the time of the Law) for the perfecting
of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of
Christ, till we all come in the unity of faith, etc.

10. Thus to interpret the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the
Church indefinitely taken, can be no Paradox, seeing the predictions of our
Savior himself concerning his Kingdom must of necessity be thus interpreted;
witness that Prediction (to omit others) Matthew. 16. 27, 28. The Son of man
shall come in the Glory of his Father with his Angels, and then he shall reward
every man according to his works. Verily I say unto you, there be some standing
here, that shall not taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in his
Kingdom.

The later part of this Prediction, or the Experiment answering unto it, was
exemplified in Peter, James and John, within seven days after: For these Three
were Spectators of his Transfiguration in the Mount; And his transfiguration
was but a representation or exemplification of that glory wherein he shall
appear in the day of Judgment, when he shall give these Apostles, and all that
shall obey his precepts, full possession of the Kingdom of God prepared for
them. But albeit these three Apostles had not only their eyes, but their ears
true witnesses of his glory, as of the glory of the only begotten Son of God
(for so it is said, Matthew. 17. 2. His face did shine as the Sun, and his
raiment was white as the light; and ver. 5. A bright cloud over shadowed them,
and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my well-beloved Son,
in whom I am well-pleased, hear him:) Yet miserable men had they been for all
this, if their hopes or expectations had been terminated or accomplished with
this transient glorious spectacle or voice: Both the voice and the spectacle
were but earnests or pledges of that everlasting joy or happiness, which they
were to expect in the perpetual fruition of the like sights or sounds in the
life to come.

Of this sort or rank is that Prophecy of Esaias 2. 4. And he shall judge among
the Nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords
into Plow-shares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up
sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more. There was at the
birth of this great Judge, a glimps exhibited of this Universal Peace, which
shall not be universally established before the last and final Judgment: All
the Nations of the Earth were quiet and free from any noise of War when he came
first into the World: For Janus his Temple was then shut; And after he shall be
revealed again unto the World from Heaven, there shall be neither Death, nor
Famine, nor the Sword. Howbeit, even the dearest of his Saints, which have
lived since his first Birth, were to endure a perpetual War in their Pilgrimage
here on earth; and the end of their War is to make them capable of this
everlasting peace.

11. Another Prediction of his coming to Judgment there is, which must be
interpreted according to the former Rule; that is, Inchoative, or in part Mal.
3. 2. meant Inchoative of Christ's first coming, Completive of his second.
of his first coming to visit us in humility, and to instruct the World; but
Completive, or fully, of his second coming to Judge the World, Mal. 3. 2, 3.
But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears?
For he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers soap: And he shall sit as a
refiner or purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge
them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in
righteousness.

So certain and so general is the former Rule of interpretation, that not this
prediction of Malachi's only, and the like of other Prophets; but the
fulfilling of them related by the Evangelists, cannot rightly be interpreted
without the help of this Rule: For Instance, to lay this Rule unto St. John
Baptists speech, Matthew. 3. 10, 11, 12. Now also the ax is laid unto the root of
the tree: Therefore every tree which brings forth not good fruit, shall be
hewn down and cast into the fire: I indeed Baptize you with water unto
repentance; but he that comes after me, is mightier then I, whose shoes I am
not worthy to bear, he shall Baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire:
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his
wheat into the Garner: But will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. This
Prediction cannot be exactly fulfilled until the Final Sentence be given and
put in execution: And yet within 43 years after his Baptism by John, there was
a manifest and lively representation exhibited to the World of his second
coming unto Judgment; and this representation was exhibited upon the Nation of
the Jews: The full accomplishment whereof shall at his second By first coming,
he means His coming to judge and punish the Jews: The coming spoken of John 21.
22.
coming (and not before) be universally and exactly accomplished in all
Nations, and Languages, and People: Wherein then does this representation of
Final Judgment, which at his first coming was exhibited in the Jewish Nation,
punctually consist? In this especially. There was such a notorious and manifest
Crisis or distinction between the Elect and Reprobate of the Jewish Nation, or
seed of Abraham at his first coming, as in no Nation or People had been
experienced before, nor shall be experienced in any before the day of Final
Judgment, in which, this distinction of Elect and Reprobates Such a
discrimination of Elect and Reprobate, as was then, may not be looked for till
Doomes-day.
shall not be only universally manifested, but solemnly declared in respect of
all mankind: Every Son of Adam shall in that day be irrevocably marshalled or
ranked, either amongst the absolute Reprobates, or absolute Elect: In the one
or other rank of which estates, neither all nor most of every Nation or Church
are at all points of time in the Interim to be accounted, no not in respect of
Gods Eternal Decree: Nor may the Verdicts or Aphorisms, See Book 10. chap. 37,
38.
whether of our Savior himself, or of his Apostles after his death, concerning
Election or Reprobation, be extended to other times or Nations in the same
measure or Tenor, wherein they were verified and experienced in the Nation of
the Jews, at, or upon our Saviors first coming. Thus far to extend them in
respect of all Times or Nations were to transgress the Analogy of Faith, or
received Rules of Interpreting Scriptures; and to dissolve the sweet and
pleasant Harmony between the Law and the Gospel, or between the Evangelists and
the Prophets.

And thus far of the second Point; in handling whereof, diverse passages have
intruded themselves, which are not impertinent to the third Point.

CHAP. XII. Of the manner of Christ's coming to Judgment, which was the third
General proposed in the ninth Chapter.
1. IT is said in the former Prophecy of Daniel, chap. 7. ver. 13. that One
like the Son of Man came in the clouds of Heaven unto the Ancient of days. The
literal fulfilling of this Prophetical vision is recorded, Acts 1. 9. And Dan.
7. 13. fulfilled. Acts 1. 9.
when he (to wit Christ the Son of Man) had spoken these things, whilst they
beheld, He was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight: But
whither he was carried in the Cloud which received him, they could not
distinctly see: Their bodily eyes could not see so much by day, as had been
revealed to Daniel in vision by night: But admit that this cloud did carry him
into the presence of the Ancient of days, or of God his Father; What is this
manner of his going into Heaven, unto the manner of his coming to Judge the
Earth, which is The Point in hand? Certainly much! for so the Angels, ver. 11.
admonished his Disciples, which steadfastly beheld the Manner of his Ascension:
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into Heaven? This same Jesus, which
is taken from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner, as you have seen
him go into Heaven: But shall the manner of his coming to Judge the World, be
in every point like unto the manner of his ascending into Heaven? No! then it
should not be so terrible, as we believe it shall be. The chief parts then of
this similitude are these Two. The manner of Christ's going up to Heaven, showed
the manner of his coming to Judge the Earth.


The First, As he did locally and visibly go into Heaven, so he shall locally
and visibly come to judge the earth.

The second, As he was received into Heaven in a cloud, so he shall come to
Judge the World (as he himself foretold the High Priest, and his Accomplices,
Matthew 26. 64.) in the clouds of heaven.

The literal meaning of both places, and the intent and purpose, as well of the
Angels, as of our Savior in this prediction, infers, That this Son of man,
whom they now beheld with bodily eyes, was that very God, whose glorious
kingdom and reign the Psalmist describes, Psalm. 104. 3. Who lays the beams of
his chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds his chariots, who walks
upon the wings of the wind. Who makes his Angels Spirits (or the Spirits his
Angels) his Ministers a flame of fire. So they will appear when they attend him
Coming to Judgment, which will be in flaming Fire.

In all the manifestations of Christ to be the Son of God, The Cloud is still a
Witness.

First, In his Transfiguration upon the Mount. A Cloud did overshadow him; and
out of the Cloud this testimony was given him by God the Father, Matthew. 17. 5.
this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; hear him.

2. Whilst he ascends to God his Father, Acts 1. 9. A Cloud receives him.

And 3. When he shall come from heaven, or from his Fathers presence, to judge
the earth, he shall have a Cloud for his Canopy.

For more particular Description of the Manner of his Coming, the next Point
is; From what place he shall come? Now it is expressly said in our Creed [That
Christ Jesus our Lord, who was conceived by the holy Ghost, born of the Virgin
Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried, descended
into hell, who the third day rose again from The Place or Term from which
Christ shall come to Judgment.
the dead, ascended into heaven, and there sits at the right hand of God,
shall thence come to Judge the quick and the dead.] But this word [Thence] is
of ambiguous Reference. It may be referred in general either to the Heavens,
into which he ascended, or unto the Right hand of God, or unto both. Certain it
is, that he shall come from Heaven as visibly and locally, as he ascended
thither. Yet whether he shall come from the Right hand of God, is questionable,
but not by us determinable, unless it be determined already in the first
Chapter of this Book, what is literally meant by The Right hand of God, either
in the Creed or in those places of the New Testament, out of which This Article
is taken. If Christ's Body (as Lutherans did contend, chapt. 3. 6.) be every
where; or, if by the Right hand of God only the Power of God be literally
meant, as many other Protestant Writers take as granted, or leave unquestioned;
then Christ cannot be said to come from the Right hand of God; for it is
impossible that Christ should come, or that there should be any true motion
from that, which is every where. Neither can it be said, nor may it so much as
be imagined, that Christ should depart from the Power of God, which
(wheresoever he be as man) does accompany and guard him. But if by the Right
hand of God, at which Christ sits, be literally meant A visible and glorious
Throne, then Christ may be said as truly and locally to come from thence, as
from heaven, to Judge the Quick and the dead. At least His Throne may remove
with him. Now that by the Right hand of God, at which Christ sits, A Visible
or local Throne is meant, I will at this time add only one Testimony unto the
rest heretofore avouched in the handling of that Article, which is more
literally concludent then all the rest; and it is Heb. 12. 2. He endured the
Cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of
God. Not at the right hand of his own Throne, but at the right hand of the
Throne of God the Father.

2. For perfecting this Map or Survey of Christ's coming to Judgment already
begun; would it not be as pertinent to know The Place, unto which he shall
come, as the Place whence he comes? By the Rules of Art or method, this last
Question would be more pertinent then the former. But seeing To what Place
Christ (probably) shall come.
the Scriptures are not in this Point so express and punctual as in the former,
we may not so peremptorily determine it, or so curiously search into it. This
is certain, That Christ after his descending from heaven, shall have his Throne
or Seat of Judgment placed between the heaven and the earth in the air
over-shadowed with clouds; But over what part of the earth his throne shall be
thus placed is uncertain or conjectural; at the most but probable

Many notwithstanding, as well Ancient as Modern, are of Opinion, That the
Throne or Seat of Judgment shall be placed over the Mount of Olives, from which
Christ did ascend; and This (for ought we have to say against it) may be A
Third Branch of the forementioned similitude betwixt the manner of Christ's
ascending up into heaven, and of his Coming to Judgment; that is, As he was
received in a cloud into heaven over Mount Olivet, so he shall descend in the
clouds of heaven, to Judge the world in the same place. But the Testimony of
Scripture, which gives the best Ground of probability, and a Tincture at least
of moral certainty to the former opinion or conjecture, is that of Zach. cap.
14. ver. 3, 4. Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those Nations
(to wit all those Nations, which have been gathered in See Book 9. Chap. 43.
battle against Jerusalem, and these in the verse precedent were all Nations)
as when he fought in the day of battle. And his feet shall stand in that day
upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the East, and the Mount
of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the East and toward the
West, and there shall be a very great Valley, and half of the Mountain shall
remove toward the North, and half of it toward the South, etc. This place,
albeit (perhaps) in part it were verified in the destruction of Jerusalem, yet
may it be also literally meant of the Last General Judgment, in which the rest
of the prophecy following shall punctually and exactly be fulfilled.

3. But to leave these Circumstances of Place, from which, and unto which
Christ shall come, and utterly to omit the Circumstance of Time, which is more
uncertain. The most useful branch of the Third General Point proposed, is to
know or apprehend the Terrible manner of his Coming. Knowing therefore the
terror of the Lord (says our Apostle, 2 Cor. 5. 11.) we persuade men. His
Speech is very Emphatical and Significant; an Aphorism of Life, unto whose
Truth every experienced Physician of the soul will easily subscribe. For but a
few men there be (especially in these later times, and these must be more then
Men; in some good measure Christian Men) whom we can hope to persuade unto
Godliness by the Love of God in Christ our Lord; Albeit we should spend our
brains in drawing the picture or proportion of the Love exhibited in Christ, or
give luster or color to the proportion drawn by the Evangelists, with our own
blood. But by the Terror of the Lord, or by decyphering of that last and
dreadful day, we shall perhaps persuade some men to become Christians, as well
in heart as in profession, by taking Christ's Death and their own Lives into
serious consideration.

Now of Terror or dread there be Two Corporeal Senses more apprehensive Two
Senses chiefly apt to receive the impressions of Terror.
then the rest, which are apt rather to suffer or feel, then to Dread the
evils, which befall them; The Two In-lets by which Dread or terror enters into
the soul of man, are the Eye and the Ear. All the Terrors of that last day may
be reduced to these Two Heads: To the strange and unusual Sights, which shall
then be seen, and unto the strange and unusual Sounds or Voices, Terrors of
Sounds, and Terrors of Sights.
which shall then be heard. If we would search the Sacred Records from the Fall
of our first Parents until our restoration was accomplished by Christ, or
until the Sacred Canon was complete, The notifications or apprehensions of Gods
extraordinary presence, whether they were made by voice, or spectacle unusual,
have been fearful and terrible to flesh and blood; though much better
acquainted with Gods Presence then we are.

When our first Parents heard but the Voice of the Lord God walk in the garden,
in the cool of the day, they hid themselves from his presence amongst the trees
of the Garden, Genesis 3. 8, 10. When Gideon (Judge. 6. 22.) perceived that he
which had spoken unto him (albeit he had spoken nothing but words of comfort
and encouragement) was the Angel of the Lord, Gideon said, Alas O Lord God,
because I have seen an Angel of the Lord face to face. The issue of his fear
was Death, which happily he conceived from Gods word to Moses, Exodus 33. 20.
Thou can not see my face, for there shall no man see me, and live. But to
assure Gideon, that he was not comprised under that universal sentence of Death
denounced, by God himself, to all that shall see him face to face, the Lord
says unto him, ver. 23, 24. Peace be unto thee; fear not; thou shall not die;
and Gideon (for further ratification of this Privilege or dispensation) built
an altar unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah Shalom, that is, the Lord send
peace; or the Lord will be a Lord of peace unto his servants. Yet could not
this assurance, made by the Lord himself unto Gideon, exempt his Successors
from the like or greater fear upon notice of Gods extraordinary presence. For
so Manoah (Samsons father) after long Conference with the Lord, after he knew
that it was an Angel of the Lord, which had brought the Message to him of
Samsons birth, said unto his Wife, Judge. 13. 22. We shall surely die, because
we have seen God. But his Wife said unto him, if the Lord were pleased to kill
us, he would not have received a burnt offering, and a meat offering at our
hands; neither would he have showed us all these things, neither would he at
this time have told us such things, as these, ver. 23. So then Gods
extraordinary presence is terrible even to his servants, to flesh and blood
without exception, though in the issue it will prove comfortable to such as
truly fear him, and faithfully rely upon his promises. St. Peter long after
this time was a man less conscious of many grievous sins, then most of us alive
this day are, yet not upon any sight or spectacle of Gods Extraordinary
Presence; but only upon an instinct or secret apprehension of his Peculiar
Presence in Christ as man, notified unto him by the miraculous draught of
fishes, which he took by his direction and command, cries out; Lord depart from
me: for I am a sinful man, Luke 5. 8. And St. Paul before his conversion fell
to the earth upon a sudden glimpse or representation of that glorious light,
wherein Christ shall appear at the last day, Acts 9. 3, 4. And after he had
heard A Voice saying unto him (though in no extraordinary manner for terror)
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? He trembling and astonished at the name of
Jesus, said, Lord, what will thou have me to do? ver. 6. No marvel if St. Paul,
being conscious of persecution intended by him against Christ's Church, and
having by Fact and Resolution declared himself to be Christ's Enemy, were thus
affrighted at the Sight and Voice; when as St. Peter, St. James and St. John,
after long and peculiar familiarity with Christ, and after many gracious
promises made unto them of Gods special protection over them, were thrown down
to the earth with a more placid and comfortable Voice, then that, which St.
Paul heard. The Voice, which they heard out of the cloud, was this, This is my
well beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. And when they heard
it (says the text, Matthew. 17. 6.) they fell on their faces, and were sore
afraid; until Christ came and touched them, and said; arise and be not afraid.
This strange dejection of these three great Apostles at so mild and gentle a
Voice, yet a Voice uttered from the extraordinary presence of God, gives us a
Remarkable Document or grounded Observation of the truth of that saying of St.
Paul, 1 Cor. 15. 50. Now this I say brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the Kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
Christ had told these Three, Matthew. 16. 28. that they should see, not God, but
the Son of man coming in his Kingdom. Peter had a desire to have inherited that
joy, wherewith his heart was ravished at the sight of our Saviors
Transfiguration, which (as you heard before) was but a representation of his
coming in glory to Judge the world; and out of this desire he said, Lord, it is
good for us to be here: if thou will, let us make here three Tabernacles; one
for Thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. Yet as soon as he heard the Voice,
the Antipathie between sinful flesh, and the fruition of Gods presence (or the
inheritance of that Kingdom of Christ, which was then represented) begun to
show it self. And what shall We do then, which are conscious of more grievous
sins, then St. Peter, S. James, or S. John, then were? unto whom both the
Spectacle of Christ's glorious presence, and the Voice or Sound, which in that
day shall be heard from heaven, will be far more terrible then any
manifestation of Gods presence, whether made by Voice or Sight unto our First
Parents, unto Gideon, unto Manoah, or unto any of his Apostles recorded in
Scripture.

4. Let us now take a view of such representations or descriptions of the A
view of the terrible Spectacles and Sounds preceding Doomsday.
Terrible Spectacles, which shall be seen, and of the Terrible Voices or
sounds, which in that last day shall be heard, as Gods Prophets or Evangelists
have framed to us.

These representations are of Two Sorts, either Charactred out unto us in mere
Words, or in Matters of Fact historically related.

To begin with the Terrible Spectacles, which shall appear before the last day,
or at the least before the Process or Judgment begin. These are most punctually
expressed by the Prophet Joel, Cap. 2. 30, 31. And I will show wonders in the
heavens, and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke, the Sun shall
be turned into darkness, and the Moon into blood, before the great and terrible
See Book 1. Chap. 24.
day of the Lord come. And Joel 3. 15, 16. The Sun and the Moon shall be
darkened, and the Stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord also shall roar
out of Sion and utter his voice out of Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth
shall shake. The Terrors here foretold were really represented by the first
desolation of Judah, and destruction of Jerusalem by the Assyrians and
Chaldeans, whose approach to execute Gods Judgments upon that land and people
was prophesied of, by this Prophet, in the beginning of this Second Chapter;
yet so foretold by him, as the plagues there threatened might by Repentance have
been prevented; So could not the Terrors foretold in the Second Prophecy; at
least the Prophet expresses no means for averting these fearful signs in the
heavens and earth. This later prophecy is in particular exemplified by our
Savior; Matthew. 24. 27, 29, 30. For as the lightning comes out of the East,
and shines even unto the West; So shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened, and
the Moon shall not give her light, and the Stars of heaven shall fall, and the
Powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And then shall appear the sign of the
Son of man in Heaven; and then shall all the Tribes of the Earth mourn, and
they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven with power and
great glory: Both the Prophecy of Joel, and this prediction of our Savior were
in part fulfilled, shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, by the
burning of the Mount Vesuvius in Campania, a Province of Italy; the Sea Book 1.
chap. 24.. 4, 5, etc.
manner and effects whereof, how fearful and terrible they were, not to Rome
only or Italy, but to a great part of Africa, to Egypt, to Syria, and to
Constantinople, with the Countries adjoining, and how consonant they were unto
the Prophet Joels, and our Saviors Prediction, may be gathered from Dion, in
his 66. and 68. Books; and from other Roman Heathenish Writers of those times:
But however the world had a general warning of the last Judgment, in that
fearful Spectacle, yet may we not deny that the like or more fearful Spectacles
shall be again exhibited, upon, or immediately before our Savior's second coming.

From St. Peter's Comments upon the forecited Prophecy of Joel, Acts 2. 20.
there arises A Question; The Prophet says, as the Hebrew word imports, that
these signs should be exhibited before the great and Terrible day of the Lord.
St. Peter says, They shall be exhibited before the great and Conspicuous, or
notable day of the Lord: So indeed the 70 Interpreters, whose Translation St.
Peter follows, renders the Hebrew [Hannora] not as the Latins do, horrendum,
or tremendum, but (...), Conspicuous: And the reason why they so render it, as
some later Critics think, was because they took the Original word to be a
Derivative, or Branch of the Hebrew word Raah, which signifies, To see; and so
the Object of it should be only some visible apparition or matter of Sight;
whereas the later and more accurate Hebricians, take the same Hebrew word to be
a Branch of the root Jarah, which signifies to Fear, or Dread; and for this
reason render it not the visible or conspicuous day, but the terrible day of
the Lord. But there is no necessity of conceiving any error, either in the 70
Interpreters concerning the derivation of the Hebrew word [Hannora] or of any
alteration of Rules (concerning the right derivation of words) between the
Ancient and Modern Hebricians: For the Greek word, (...), which our English
renders, Notable, or Conspicuous, is, as Grammarians say, Mediae
significationis; that is, General, to any strange or uncouth apparitions in the
Heavens; whether they be apparitions of Horror and Dread, or only of
Lightsomness, or good hope: Every man prayed, says the Author of the second of
Maccabees, chap. 5. 4. that the apparition might turn to good: Yet was the
Apparition then exhibited Prodigious and fearful.

5. But the most lively representation of the last Judgment, as well for The
terrors on mount Sinai, Types of the Terrors of Doomsday.
matter of Fearful Spectacle, as for matter of Terrible Sound, was exhibited
immediately by God himself, at the promulgation of the Law upon Mount Sinai:
And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders,
and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the Trumpet
exceeding loud, so that all the people that were in the camp trembled: And
Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood
at the nether part of the mount: And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke,
because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as
the smoke of a Furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly, Exodus 19. 16, 17,
18. Our Apostle, Heb. 12. 21. adds (which is not in the Old Testament
expressed) So terrible was the Sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and
quake: And if Moses the Man of God did so exceedingly quake at this Sight, Who
shall be able to stand without trembling and quaking at the like?

But shall Christ's appearance at the last day be like to this fearful Sight at
the giving of the Law? Yes, and a great deal more terrible. What Comfort then
does the Gospel of Christ afford us Christians more, then Moses his Law did the
Israelites? The Law being given in this Terrible manner, did Prognosticate or
portend their fearful end which should adhere unto it, or seck salvation by it
without the intercession of a Mediator, who was to be the Author and Fountain
of a better message, and more gladsome tidings from Heaven to all such as shall
seek Redemption by him, or Absolution from the curse of the Law.

This is the Prerogative of the Gospel, as it stands in opposition to the Law,
and this Prerogative is prosecuted at large by our Apostle in that Chapter,
Hebr. 12. But the benefit of this Prerogative is not absolutely Universal, but
Conditional. It extends only to such as shall show better obedience unto
Christ and to his Gospel, then most of the Israelites did to Moses and to his
Law: To such as contemn or disobey the Gospel, Christ shall appear a more
dreadful and terrible Judge in the last day, then he appeared unto Israel in
Mount Sinai: This point of Doctrine is fully prosecuted by our Apostle, Heb.
12. 25, 26, 27. See that ye refuse not him that speaks; for if they escaped
not, who refused him that spoke on the earth, much more shall not we escape, if
we turn away from him, that speaks from heaven; whose voice then did shake
the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the
earth only, but also heaven: And this word, Yet once more, signifies the
removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that
these things which cannot be shaken, may remain: God (as a learned Father
observes) did call his people at the giving of the Law unto the mountain then
burning with fire, to testify unto the world what our Apostle says in the
conclusion of chap. 12. That he is a consuming fire unto the obstinate
Transgressors of his Laws; and that fire and smoke, that burning, blackness,
darkness, and tempest, shall be the everlasting portion of all such, as shall
not be found in Christ at the day of Judgment, nor then absolved by him from
the curse of the Law.

6. The Point which I would commend to the Reader's more special consideration,
A special Observable, It was Christ that shook the earth at the giving of the
Law.
out of the 26. verse of this Chapter, is, That it was the voice of Jesus
Christ the Mediator of the New Covenant, which did shake the earth at the
giving of the Law: The Apostle takes it as granted from the Common Rule of
Interpretation, well known in those times, that the shaking of the Earth then,
was an Emblem or token of the mutability of the Law, and of the unstability of
the Earth or visible World it self. The Earth being then subject to shaking or
motion, did thereby testify it self to be obnoxious unto ruin and
destruction: And in that (after this terrible commotion of the Earth at the
giving of the Law, when the Mountains, as the Psalmist speaks, Psalm. 114. 4.
skipped like rams, and the little hills like young sheep) God again, by the
Prophet Haggai, chap. 2. ver. 6. denounces, That yet once more he would
suddenly shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land: This
intimates unto us, that the second commotion of the Heavens, and of the Earth
(which was to be once, and no more) should finally accomplish that which was
fore-shadowed or represented by the former commotion of the earth at the giving
of the Law: This second commotion shall bring the Heaven and Earth to ruin,
and put an end to all things mutable; or (as our Apostle speaks) it includes
the removing of those things that can be shaken, that those things which cannot
be shaken may remain; that is, that there may be a world everlasting: That
which the Prophet Haggai intimates more darkly, the Prophet Esaias had expressed
more plainly, chap, 34. ver. 4. And all the host of Heaven shall be dissolved,
and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroul, and all their host shall
fall down, as the leaf falls from the Vine, and as a falling fig from a
fig tree.

The same vision was more lively and clearly made unto St. John, Rev. 6. 12,
13, 14. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth Seal, and lo there was a
great earthquake, and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the Moon
became as blood: And the Stars of Heaven fell unto the earth, even as a
fig tree casts her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind: And
the heaven departed as a scroul, when it is rolled together, and every mountain
and Island were moved out of their places.

7. But that which shall add life and spirit to all these, is, The terrible
The dreadful sounds that will be heard at Doomsday.
Voice or sound, which shall then be heard, summoning all flesh to appear
before the Judgment seat of Christ: As it was the Voice of Christ, which did
shake the earth at the giving of the Law; so shall the Voice of Christ (but a
Voice more terrible then That) produce this terrible commotion here mentioned,
in the Heavens and in the earth: For as St. Paul instructs us, 1 Cor. 15. 52.
The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised, etc. And again, 1 Thessalonians.
4. 16. The Lord himself shall descend from Heaven in a shout, with the voice of
the Archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
first. The Terror of this Voice to such as sleep not in Christ, may be gathered
from the power or efficacy of it, which is more fully expressed by St. John,
Rev. 20. 13. The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell
delivered up the dead which were in them, and they were judged every man
according to their works: This universal efficacy of his Voice is expressed by
our Savior, John 5. 28, 29. The hour is coming, in which all that are in the
grave, shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good
unto the resurrection of life; they that have done evil, unto the resurrection
of damnation.

Some late Historians and Astronomers, relate a natural Eclipse of the Clavius.
Sun so terrible in Spain, that the Crows, and other Fowls of the air, seeking
as it seems to fly from it, were so affrighted with the sudden increase of
darkness about midday, that they fell down to the earth in a deadly
astonishment: What tongue then can express the Dread and Horror, which the
Another Author tells, that the Birds fell to the earth upon a great shout given
by a multitude in an Army, or at some great solemnity.
terrible apparitions at that day shall produce in all such as have lived and
died in incredulity or security of the Judgment which shall follow them; in
all on whom that day shall come, as suddenly (without any better observation or
preparation for it) as the forementioned Eclipse of the Sun did upon the
reasonless Fowls of the air? Or if you desire a further a description of the
Terror, which shall then fall upon the Inhabitants of the earth, even upon the
most intrepid and undanted, in respect of any ordinary Terrors; then take it
from St. John, Rev. 6. 15, 16. And the Kings of the earth, and the great men,
and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and every
bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in the Rocks of
the mountains; and said to the mountains, and to the rocks, fall on us, and
hide us, --.

Thus much was distinctly likewise foretold, and Prophetically set forth by
the Prophet Esaias, chap. 2. 11, etc. That neither St. John's words, nor the
Prophet Esays are Hyperbolical, but are Literally meant by them, and really and
punctually to be fulfilled, is clear from our Saviors Interpretation of the
Prophet Esaias, and the like passages of other Prophets, at his going to the
Cross, Luke 23. 30, 31. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, fall on
us; and to the hills, cover us; for if they do these things in a green tree,
what shall be done in a dry? Howbeit, this terror shall not merely proceed from
these Terrible Spectacles and Sounds which shall be Antecedent to the Final
Judgment, but from the Sight of Christ placed in his seat of Judicature. So
St. John (in the forecited place, Rev. 6. 16.) tells us, That the Affrightment
and dread that seized upon the great men of the Earth did arise from seeing the
face of him that sat upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.

8. Having thus shown the Terrors antecedent to the Process, we go on to The
Process of the final Judgment.
the Process it self. That takes beginning from the Manner of Christ's Coming
and approach; or from His Appearance, as he shall sit in Judgment. He shall
come from Heaven, or from the Right hand of the Throne of God, where he now
sits, to execute Judgment, in the open air, or in that region wherein the
clouds have their Rake. The Manner of his Progress or approach shall be Swift;
and, as before has been intimated, to our apprehension Violent. For at his
coming to Judgment, and not before, shall the Prophet Esay's Prayer or Wish be
accomplished; Oh that thou would rent the heavens, that thou would come
down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence. As when the melting
fire burns, the fire causes the waters to boil; to make thy name known to
thy adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence: When thou did
terrible things, which we looked not for, thou came down, the mountains
flowed down at thy presence, Esaias, 64. 1, 2, 3. But because St. John intimates
(in the forecited place) that the chief cause of Terror, was the sight of him
that sat upon the Throne; we shall first consider, how his Throne or Presence
is described in the Old Testament: Secondly, how these Descriptions or
Representations are decyphred or charactred out unto us (by more then
parallels) in the New.

Now all the Prophecies or Predictions, which to this purpose can be produced,
Of this Rule, see chap. 11.. 9.
must all be interpreted by the Rule heretofore given; that is, However they
may be literally meant or verified of some former times or events, yet they are
verified or meant of them Inchoative only: They are not, they cannot be
Completive applied to any other time or times, besides the day of Final
Judgment, or the world to come, which shall ensue upon it: The terror of his
Throne, and of him that sits thereon, is described, Dan. 7. 9, 10. I beheld
till the Thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment
was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his Throne was like
the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came
forth from before him, thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before him: the Judgment was set, and the Books were
opened.

The Fiery Wheels are Emblems of his sudden approach, or of the swiftness of
his Judgments to overtake his Enemies: Though the Vision was new and uncouth,
yet the Branches of the things seen or revealed unto Daniel, were known before
unto Gods Prophets; His Seat or Throne was prepared of old; so faith the
Psalmist, Psalm. 9. 4. Thou have maintained my right and my cause, thou satest
in the Throne Judging right: And again, ver. 6, 7. O thou enemy, destruction is
come to a perpetual end, and thou have destroyed Cities, their memorial is
perished with them: But the Lord shall endure for ever, he has prepared his
Throne for Judgment. [See Psalm. 96: ver. 10. 13. And Psalm. 98. ver. 8, 9.] But
Daniel saw more seats, and Thrones then one, albeit he mention (as perhaps he
saw) none sitting in them: This, as one wittily commenteth upon this place of
Daniel, is an Emblem of the Law, which was an Emptiness or vacuum in respect of
the Gospel; and as all things else in the Law prefigured or forepainted, were
solidly accomplished in the Gospel: So these Seats, which are here indefinitely
represented unto us by Daniel, without any specification of their number,
without intimation of any sitting on them, are pictured unto us by St. John,
with 24. Elders sitting upon them, Rev. 4. 4. And round about the Throne were
24. seats, and upon the seats I saw 24. Elders sitting, and clothed in white
raiment, and they had on their heads Crowns of Gold: Our Savior had said unto
his Apostles, Matthew. 19. 28. that They should sit upon twelve seats, Judging
the twelve Tribes of Israel. And twelve Heads of the Tribes of Israel, or the
like number of Select Ones, who lived under the Old Testament, may make up the
number of 24. That as all the Truths of both Testaments will consummately be
fulfilled, so the Saints of Both may then be most perfectly united in the
Church Triumphant.

9. But to proceed to such other Representations as are to be found in the
Scripture: This manner of Christ's coming to Judge the earth, or of his
appearance in glory, was represented unto Moses and to the Israelites, Exodus
24. 10. 17. The sight of the glory of the Lord, was like devouring fire on the
top of the mount, in the eyes of the children of Israel: And this fire had
devoured them, if they had approached the mountain, or Gods presence, without
Gods invitation: But Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and 70. of the Elders of
Israel went up, and saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it
were a paved work of a Saphir stone, and as it were the body of Heaven in its
clearness: And upon the Nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand.

This was a Peculiar Privilege or dispensation: Also they saw God, and did eat
and drink; and in this they represented the state of the Elect; which,
notwithstanding the terror of that last day, shall be invited by Christ, and be
admitted to eat and drink with him in his Kingdom. But this dispensation during
the time of the Law was not granted to all Israel, but to Moses and Aaron,
Nadab and Abihu, and to the 70. Elders or Nobles of Israel only; unto all the
rest, whom God did not vouchsafe to invite, the Spectacle, though seen afar
off, was Terrible; so terrible that they durst not approach unto it. So shall
the coming of the Son of Man be to all the kindreds of the earth, which have
not hearkened to his sweet and loving Invitations here on earth: All such as
have neglected them, or make their appearance before him without a garment or
habit in some sort suitable to the Marriage, unto which they have been invited,
shall be everlastingly excluded and cast into utter darkness, where shall be
nothing but weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth: But the thread which I
am now to follow, is the forementioned Prophecy, Dan. 7. v. 9.

10. Now, whether in the vision of the Ancient of days, God the Father were
personally represented; or whether it were a representation of the Godhead or
Divine Power only, as it is indivisibly in the Blessed Trinity, without any
note of Personal difference; or whether at the last day there shall be any
distinct representation of Christ's sitting at the right hand of the Father; or
whether The Throne of the Son of God shall then only appear; are Questions
which I will refer wholly to the Schools. It suffices us to believe and know,
that the Father Judges no man, but has committed all Judgment, especially
this Final Judgment, to the Son; and that the SON OF MAN shall then appear in
the Glory of his Godhead, in Glory equal to God the Father.

What Manner of appearance this shall be, and how the world shall be affected
with it, we are now to inquire so far as is fitting, taking the description of
it from Gods written word. And happily, lest we should conceive of God the
Father, as more ancient for days, then the Son, (which Transformation of the
Divine Nature the pictures of the Blessed Trinity seen and allowed by the Roman
Church, do naturally and inevitably suggest to the unlearned) St. John does
describe the Son of Man, or that glory wherein the Son of God and the Son of
Man shall then appear, much what after the same manner, that Daniel had done
the Ancient of days, Dan. 7. 9, 10. The description of the Son of God and of
the Son of Man taken by St. John, is, Rev. 1. 13, 14, 15, 16. And I saw in the
midst of the 7. Candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a
garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His
head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were
as a flame of fire. And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right
hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword, and his
countenance was as the Sun shines in his strength.

You have heard before out of the seventeenth of St. Matthew, that St. Peter,
James and John, when they were spectators of his transfiguration, (which was
but a representation of the Son of Man's coming in his kingdom) when they heard
the voice out of the cloud, fell on their faces, and were sore afraid, until he
came and touched them, and said, arise, be not afraid. This sight or vision of
his glory, Apoc. 1. 17, 18. was more terrible then the Voice, which they then
heard. When I saw him (says St. John) I fell at his feet as dead, and he laid
his right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not, I am the first and the last,
I am be that lives, and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen,
and have the keys of hell and of death. The exercise of this Christ's Exercise
of the power of the Keys, of Hell, and Death, not fully manifested till
Doomsday.
great Power, and of the Keys shall not be fully manifested until his glorious
appearance in Judgment. The like description of the Son of man in his Glory, we
have, Apoc. 19. 11, 12. And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white Horse, and
he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he
does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were
many crowns. Now albeit in this verse Christ be called Faithful and True, as
being the sole and full Accomplisher of our Belief in Gods promises, yet these
Titles are no way sufficient to express his dignity. To show us that his
Glorious Majesty is altogether unexpressible by Man or Angel, it is expressly
added by St. John in the next words, And he had A Name written, that no man
knew, but he himself. And yet, ver. 13. it is said, His Name is called, The
Word of God. This is not that Name which no man knew besides himself, for St.
John knew him by this Name when he wrote his Gospel; and this is a Name, which
does more fitly, and more fully express the Majesty, Glory and Power, wherein
he shall at the last day appear, then the former Attributes of Faithful and
True, or any other Name that is given unto him in the Word of God: This
contains all the rest. And they much disparage this Name, and much eclipse the
dignity contained in it, who The great Excellencies of Christ's Name, The Word.
restrain it only unto his Fidelity in fulfilling or performing Gods Word to
his Elect, or to the execution of Gods Judgments upon their Enemies; Though all
this be included in it, as it follows ver. 15. And out of his mouth goes a
sharp sword, that with it he should smite the Nations, and he shall rule them
with a rod of Iron, and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath
of Almighty God. And he has on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written,
KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

11. But both these Descriptions of St. John, you will say, are Emblematical,
and not to be understood according to the Letter; at the least Christ shall not
at the day of Judgment visibly appear in this Form and Habit, or with a sharp
Sword in his mouth. The Real Power and Dignity, which is painted out unto us by
this Emblem, is already exemplified, and shall be further The Real Dignity
Emblemed in the Sharp Sword going out of Christ's mouth; is, Defender of his
Church.
exemplified in Defending His Church in general, or advancing the estate of the
forlorn Jewish Nation before that great and terrible day, wherein he shall set
a Period to all wars and contentions, to all exercise of hostility against his
Church.

The Power of Christ here described by S. John (the exercise whereof is not yet
accomplished, but shall, as some Interpreters think, be remarkably verified
before the last day, in advancing the Jewish Nation, and executing vengeance
upon their persecutors) was most divinely displayed by Moses in that his
excellent Song, Deuteronomy. 32. 41, 42. and in particular represented in an Emblem or
character, like to that which St. John saw: If I whet my glittering Sword, and
my hand take hold of Judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and
will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood (and my
Sword shall devour flesh) and that with the blood of the slain and of the
Captives, etc. But however this Prophecy may be remarkably verified in the
calling of the Jews, yet the Majesty and Power, which is pictured out unto us
in these Emblematical descriptions, whether made by Moses or St. John, shall
not fully be accomplished or exemplified before the last day; At that Day, and
not before, shall the full importance of his former Name be made known; then he
shall manifest himself to be the OMNIPOTENT AND ETERNAL WORD.

But is the importance of this Name, or Emblem by which the power of it is
Emblazon'd; to wit, his Sharp and Glittering Sword, any where literally expressed
in the Apostles writings? It is most fully and most emphatically, Hebr. 4. 12,
13. Vivus est Sermo Dei, The word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper
then any two edged Sword, etc. Yet is it questioned by some Whether S. John,
and S. Paul, by The Word of God, mean our Lord Jesus Christ.
(whose names I conceal) whether, by The Word of God in that place, the Eternal
Word himself be literally and directly meant; or whether St. Paul, by The Word
of God, means the self same that St. John does in his Gospel, ver. 1. In the
beginning was the Word. And again, ver. 14. The Word was made flesh. It is a
very weak Exception, which some, otherwise learned Interpreters of this
Epistle, and powerful in the Word of God, have made unto the contrary. The
strength of their Exception is this, Because the Author of that Epistle no
where else enstiles the Son of God, The Word of God. But to this Exception the
Answer is very easy: Because the Author of that Epistle had no where else the
like occasion thus to enstile him. And the same exception, were it warrantable,
might be taken against the literal meaning of St. John, or against the ordinary
interpretation of the first verse of his Gospel; because St. John no where
else, besides in the Two verses before mentioned, enstiles the Son of God by
the same name; nor does any other Evangelist besides St. John enstile him by
this name at all. Now because this passage of St. Paul, Hebr. 4. is
misinterpreted by diverse, and not fully interpreted by any, that I have read,
and yet, being rightly or more fully interpreted, will give best light unto the
Manner of Christ's Process in Judgment, I cannot better bestow my pains and
time then in the Explication of those words, Vivus est Sermo Dei, or vivum est
verbum Dei: The Word of God is quick and powerful, etc.

12. If by The Word of God in this place. The Son of God, God blessed for ever,
be not literally and most directly meant; the full meaning of the Apostle must
be restrained either to the Word of God written, or spoken by his Ambassadors.
Now that the Word of God whether written or preached An Explication of Heb. 4.
12, 13.
(or Both written and preached) cannot be the direct and complete Subject of
the Apostles Assertion in these two verses, the former Arguments or exceptions
against this interpretation will clearly evince, if we retort them, Thus. Such
glorious Attributes as are in these verses ascribed unto the Word of God, are
no where else, either in this Epistle, or in the Old Testament, or in the New,
attributed to the Word of God either as written or preached; no, not to it as
preached by the Son of God himself; Therefore this place cannot be fully or
completely meant of the Word of God either Written or Preached. No other
besides the Son of God, can be the direct or principal Subject of the Literal
and assertive sense in any proposition in these two verses contained. Yet do we
not deny that both verses may in some Sort be literally meant of the Word
Preached or Written, Pro modulo; that is, so far as the Word Written or
Preached has reference or Analogy to the Eternal Word, or to his Power here
described. For the Son of God is seldom, if at all, enstiled The Word of God,
without importance of some transcendent relation to the Word of God Written or
Preached. And from this affinity, which the word Written or Uttered has with
the eternal and unutterable Word of God, the Word Written or Preached may have
some share or portion, as it were by Reversion, in the Attributes here assigned
unto The Word of God.

But the complete Subject either of the First Proposition, The Word of God is
lively; or of the second, The Word of God is powerful; or of the third, The The
Word writ or preached, not only nor chiefly meant, Heb. 4. 12.
Word of God is sharper then any two edged Sword: the Word Written or Preached
cannot be: Nothing can be besides God himself, or that Word which St. John
says, was in the beginning, in whom was Life, and whose life was the light of
men.

Nor are the peculiar and special Attributes of God any where in Scripture set
forth in a more full and Majestic Character of words, then in these words of
St. Paul.

The propositions are in number seven or eight. The Subject of all the
propositions, (...), THE WORD, is the same. And for this reason, if any of
these Attributes be literally meant of the Son of God, or of the Son of God
only Completivee, all the rest must be completely meant of him. He only it is,
Qui ^anti mensuram nominis implet, who rightly fills the Importance of this
Title, (...), or Word, in that place. Admit then the Word Written or Preached
may truly be said to be quick and powerful, and in some sort, not more sharp,
but more peircing, then any two edged Sword (for a Sword with one edge may be
as sharp as a Sword with two edges, but not so piercing;) but admit the Word of
God preached might be more piercing then any Sword, yet could it not properly
be said to be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, or that
there is no creature, which is not manifest unto it; nor can it possibly be
imagined to be the Logical Subject of the two last Propositions: for the
Apostle plainly speaks of a living person; Neither is there any creature, that
is not manifest in HIS SIGHT, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes
OF HIM, (...), that is, as our English renders it, with whom we have to do; as
Beza and Calvin had before better expressed it then Erasmus, who renders it, of
whom we speak; or then the Vulgar Latin, adquem nobis est sermo; Of which
Latin I know not how to make good English. But the Syriack of all most fully;
All things are opened unto the eyes of him, to whom MEN must render an account.
Every one that hears the Word preached must give an account of the Word which
he hears; but this account we must not, we cannot give unto the Word preached,
but unto him whose Words they are which we hear, or from Whom the Word preached
must derive all the efficacy, force and power, which it has.

The full meaning of the Original, if any be disposed to have it fully rendered
in the Original tongue, is as much as, (...), cui a nobis reddenda est ratio,
to whom we must render our final account; such is the usual importance of the
word [(...)] in matters civil, or of contract or covenant. So says Athanasius
in his Creed; at his coming to judge the quick and the dead, all men shall rise
again with their bodies, and shall give ACCOUNT for their own works. And our
Apostle supposes, that this account must be given by every one, before he
receive his doom for things done in his body, according to that he has done,
whether it be good or bad.

13. So then all men must be (...), must reddere rationem, render a final
account of their own works; And we Christians in special, of the Word of God
read or preached unto us; how far it has fructified or miscarried in us. And
this account, or (...), we must render (...), to the Eternal Word or Son of
God, by whom God made the world. But albeit St. Paul by the word [(...)] Hebr.
4. mean the self same Person, or party, whom St. John does in the first of his
Gospel; yet may we hence discover a further Notion or imPortance of the same
word [(...)] as it is the peculiar Title of the Son of God, then was before
(Book 7th, Chap. 26.) expressed in handling that Point [how the word was made
flesh] or why the Son of God was called THE WORD.] The Reason was, not only
because he was the Speaker of the Trinity, or the Declarer of Gods Will unto
men, nor because he was the main Object of all Gods word, whether revealed to
Moses or the Prophets; but specially or most principally, for that he was the
express Image of God the Father, or Verbum internum, the full expression of the
Wisdom, Power and Majesty of the Father; And withal more then the Ideal
Pattern, according to which all things were made. For though he be the full
expression of the power and wisdom of his Father, as he is his only begotten
Son from all eternity, yet are not all things, which are made by him, or can be
made by him, a full expression of his power or wisdom. He was begotten, not
made, by his Father, and therefore equal to him. The world was made by Him, not
begotten, and therefore far inferior to him. He is a pattern, or (...) of all
things, that are made; but a pattern that cannot be paralleld by them. As He was
the pattern, or (...), by whom the world was made, and so considered by St.
John; So is He the pattern or exemplary Rule of all the Laws, which God has
given to man, whether written in their hearts, or in the Book of Grace, or of
Nature; The Rule or pattern of all the Words which God has spoken to men by his
Apostles, by his Prophets, or by this (...) or Son himself. And, according to
this Notion or importance of the word [(...)] he is, by St. Paul called, (...),
unto whom all men must reddere (...), render an account of their words, of
their works, and of their thoughts: he being in all respects the most complete
Rule or Exemplar by which all words, all works and thoughts, for which men are
to make account, are to be valued or censured; the only (...), or exact measure
of all approbation or disprovement of the accounts to be made, or of the words,
works, or thoughts, for which we are to render account. From this Notion or
importance of the word [(...)] we may take a true Notion or scantling of the
Attributes or Titles given to the Word of God by St. Paul, Heb. 4. and how well
they consort with the Word Written or Preached, as it has reference to this
Eternal Word. The Word of God Written or Preached, although in it self it be
more powerful then any two edged Sword; yet, as it is managed or weilded by us
his weak Instruments, is but as a good sword in an Infants hand; but though as
uttered by us it does not exercise its strength upon our hearers, yet does it
not utterly perish or lose its efficacy; but every Word spoken in his Name,
though for the present it have no such success as we could wish, yet it is not
altogether spoken in vain, it returns unto him whose Word it is; and in his
mouth or presence the Word preached by us becomes like Scanderbegs Sword in
Scanderbegs hand, and shall in the last day recover strength and force from the
powerful appearance of this Eternal Word, or (...). So that all the glorious
Attributes given by St. Paul unto The Word of God, are primarily and
principally true of the Eternal Word, yet secondarily and less principally of
the Word preached with reference unto him.

14. The Word preached is not altogether dead, but lively, and quick, and
powerful in its operation; and shall at the last day be more piercing then any
two edged sword, and divide between the spirit and the soul. A two edged sword
may cut the bones, and divide the joints and the marrow, it may divide the soul
from the body, or at least send the soul out of the body before the time by the
course of nature allotted. But between the soul and the spirit no material
sword can make division. The most piercing sword, though it has (as the
Original imports) two mouths to devour, yet eyes it has none to distinguish
between the parts which it divides; but cuts as it falls, or as it is direrected
by the eyes and hands of him which weilds it; But The Word of God, here
principally meant, sees all the particles, betwixt which it makes division; it
is a discerner or Judge of the thoughts and intents of the heart, how secret
soever they be, how inseparable soever they be from the soul or spirit; though
our inward parts be covered with skin, with flesh and bones, yet are they naked
and as it were anatomized (for so the Original imports) unto the eyes of this
(...), to whom we are to render our account.

In the first creation he was not only (...), the live Idea or pattern, unto
whose Image men and Angels were created, and of whose Excellency the whole
world, and all the creatures in it, are but scattered and broken expressions;
but withal (...), the framer or maker of all things visible and invisible; for
God the Father made all things by this (...), without any instrumental help or
service, after a more excellent and expedite manner, then (should we suppose,
or could we imagine such a thing) any Architect, or skilful Artificer, that
could be supposed able to frame or make a material building, or other work of
his profession, without any manual labor, without any materials or
instruments, besides the pattern or exemplar, which he conceives in his mind or
imagination. In the dissolution of this world, or in the erection of the world
to come, which shall take beginning from the day of our final accounts, the
same (...), or Eternal Word of God, shall manifest himself to be, not only the
live Idaea or pattern of Gods moral or eternal Law, by which all mankind shall
be judged, and our accounts either finally approved or disproved; but to be
withal (...); A Law endued with Life, with wisdom and power: Nor such a Law
only, but a Living, Wise, Omnipotent Judge. All these Attributes, or the things
signified by them, with all the rest, that can be required in a Law, a Rule, or
Judge, are in Him undivided, and according to the Infinity of perfection. Yet
that we may the better conceive the infiniteness of his perfection, as Law and
Judge, it will not be amiss to consider these Attributes severally, as they are
found amongst us.

15. Every good Law is a kind of silent Magistrate or Judge; and every good and
perfect Judge or Magistrate is a speaking Law. So they ought to be. But these
Two Perfections seldom meet in the Government of any well ordered Commonweal,
or Church on earth. In some Nations the written Laws be tolerably good, or
comparatively very good, but the Magistrates for the most part, either ignorant
in the Laws, or unexperienced in applying their true intent and meaning to meet
with every transgression; or so manacled with Golden Fetters, that they have no
great list or dexterity to put what they know in execution In other places the
Magistrates or Judges are learned and sincere laws to themselves, and fit Laws
for others to be ruled by, were not their good purposes restrained or pinyoned
by harsh and obsolete Laws, or not well consorting with the times wherein they
live.

This Jargon between wise and wholesome Laws, and unskilful or corrupt
Magistrates; or between religious, wise and industrious Magistrates, and
imperfect, partial, or naughty Laws, has been in most Ages and Nations so
common, that many accurate Politicians, or Observers of the course of Justice,
have brought the main Question concerning all State Government to this short
issue, and submitted it to the touch and trial of learned dispute, Whether it
be better to be governed by a dead and silent, or by a live and speaking Law?
That is, whether were most expedient for all or most States, that the written
Law should be above the supreme Magistrate, or Majesty; or the supreme
Magistrate or Majesty of every Nation above the written Laws? But admitting
that every Nation had Laws as perfect as the wit of man could devise, such as
would give contentment to every member that were to be governed by them, and
Magistrates to put such Laws in execution as sincere, as wise, as well
experienced, as industrious, as courageous as any in former times have been, or
can in this life be expected; yet the most perfect or absolute Law that can be
made by man; that can be written, though made by God himself, could not be able
to put it self in execution, or to recompense every transgression as it
deserves. Nor can the wisest, the most sincere and industrious Magistrate
possibly know every transgressor of the Law, or every misdemeanor committed
within a little Province or Corporation. And albeit the Magistrate only can
give life to the Law, yet can no Magistrate give life to any Law, or put it in
execution according to the Rule of Justice, unless he know the transgressor,
and the quality of his transgression And for this reason, even those States
which have comparatively the best Laws, and the wisest Magistrates, admit, or
rather require and authorize Informers. And after the Information given, the
Magistrate must proceed secundum allegata and probata, according to the
information given by legal and competent witnesses. Now to make the Informers
and Witnesses always sincere, the best Laws and Magistrates are not able.

The Law of God indeed is a Law most perfect, most infallible, but no living
Rule to see and discern every transgression against it, no speaking Rule to
give information or testimony against the transgressors of it, much less a
living Judge to reward or punish every observer or transgressor of it. But all
the Most high perfections employed in (...)*
perfections, that can be imagined in any Law, in any Informer, in any Witness,
in any Judge or manager of Justice are eminently and most perfectly contained
in This Word, or (...), with whom we have to do, or, to whom we are to render
our account, without any tincture or admixture of their imperfections. And thus
they all are in Him most perfect, not by way of Union or Unition, but according
to most perfect and indivisible Unity.

As all things were made by him without help or instrumental service; So all
the thoughts, all the words and works of men are immediately known unto him
without any Prompter or Informer, and every man shall be judged by him according
to all his works without any Advocate or assistant. As he is the express Image
or full expression of his Fathers Person, and himself as truly God as his
Father is; so he is the (...) or mensura omnium, the exact measure of every
thing, that can be known, that can be done, spoken, or thought, and the just
recompense of all deserts. He contains an exact proportion or disproportion to
every thought, word, or action, that has proceeded from the heart or mind of
man; an exact proportion of every thought, word, or deed, that held consort
with the Law of the mind or of the spirit; an exact disproportion to every
rebellious motion, that has been conceived by the Law of the flesh against the
Law of the mind; and even in this respect he is called (...); for so the
Original word often times imports as much as proportion, or an exact measure, by
which all proportion or consonancy, all disproportion or dissonancy may be
known or notified: As, if the Base or Diapason be sound and good, every Note or
sound of the same instrument does notify the measure of its consonancie or
dissonancie to it by its own sound. And in this sense he is, (...), a living
measure or proportion. And every thought or secret inclination of man, that is
consonant to this living Rule or Law, has more then a Geometrical proportion,
a live proportion or Sympathy with him. And we shall need no other bliss and
happiness, then a true Sympathy and consort with him. Every thought or
inclination of the flesh, that is dissonant to this living Rule, or (...),
includes, more then a dead disproportion, a live Antipathie to his purity; and
according to the measure of every man's disproportion or Antipathie to this
living Rule shall the measure of his wretchedness or infelicitie be. In all
these, and many other respects is the Son of God enstyled (...), as he is the
Judge of quick and dead.

16. But does the Intent or Inference of the Apostle in that fourth Chapter to
the Hebrews, lead us unto any such apprehension or construction as has been
made of his Attributes? It does, if we look not, as the Jews did, only into the
dead Letter, but dive into the live sense or meaning of the Spirit, or of the
Apostle himself: His principal scope or aim was, to admonish his hearers, and
in them all, that confess Christ to be the Son of God and their Redeemer, to be
vigilant and careful whilst it is called to day, that they do not incur Gods
high displeasure, or provoke his sentence of utter exclusion from that Eternal
Rest, whereof that Rest which Joshuah brought the Israelites unto, when he gave
them possession of the land of Canaan, was but the Map or shadow. The
Israelites without exception had a promise of entering into the land of Canaan,
and under it a promise of entering into a better Rest. But the word preached,
says the Apostle verse. 2. did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith. The
foolish posterity of those rebellious Fathers, which were excluded by oath
from entering into the land of Canaan, and were consumed in the wilderness,
misdeemed, that Gods promise of bringing that Nation into the land of their
Rest had been accomplished in the conquest of it by Ioshuah, or in continuance
of like victorious success unto themselves. And by this conceit, and by the
dissobedience (which this conceit brought forth) against the Son of God
revealed, the most of this Nation, since his manifestation in the flesh, have
lived and died in a more miserable estate then their Fathers did, which died in
the wilderness. For neither Christian charity, nor the Analogy of Christian
faith, will permit us to say or think, that all the Israelites, which were
excluded by Oath from entering into the land of Canaan, or of their promised
earthly Rest, were also utterly excluded from entering into the Kingdom of
heaven. They, as well as we, were to render an account; unto This Eternal Word;
for he it was, which spoke to Moses in Mount Sinai, but was not then manifested
in the flesh; nor was the Article of his incarnation expressly or explicitly
known to all or most that received benefit by it. The account which they were
to make, was not so punctual, nor their examination so strict. For that, which
St. Paul says of the ancient heathens, holds true in proportion of the ancient
Israelites. God (says he) winked at these times of ignorance. Act. 17. 30, 31.
but now commands all men every where to repent, because he has appointed a
day, in which he will Judge the world in righteousness. But was not this day
appointed in these times of ignorance, at which God winked? Yes, before them;
but not so fully declared, nor the manner of it so distinctly known, as since
Christ's resurrection it has been. From this difference of times, and from the
different condition of men living since Christ's Resurrection, and from the
diversity of the account, which they must render, in respect of them, which
lived before it, St. Paul makes that inference Hebrews. 4. 11. Let us labor
therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of
unbelief (or disobedience.) The Israelites fell in the wilderness for their
disobedience to Gods word written or spoken; they did not so immediately
trespass against this (...), or Word, which since has been made flesh, as all
unbelievers and disobedient men since he was made flesh.

Now to fortify this inference he adds, ver. 12. Vivus est sermo Dei, The
Word or (...), to whom we are to render an account, is quick and power full,
more piercing then any two edged sword. So far from winking at the ignorance
of these times, that all things are naked and open unto his eyes. His
countenance (as saint John says) was as the Sun shines in his strength. Rev.
1. 16. and his eyes as a flame of fire; verse. 14. unto his eyes, thus opened,
when the Judgment shall be set, the books, as Daniel says, were opened, Dan.
7. 10. And this prophecy is unfolded by St. John, Rev. 20. 12. And I saw the
dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened, and another
book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were Judged out of
those things, which were written in the books according to their works.

17. This is the next part of the Process; and by the Books which are opened,
the best Interpreters, Ancient and Modern, understand the Books of Conscience,
The Books to be opened at Christ's coming
which until that day shall not be unfolded, or become fully legible, no not
unto them which keep these Books, though every man have one of them, or at
least an exact Copy or Exemplification of them. For it may be that the
Authentic Copy or Register of every man's Conscience is treasured up in this
Eternal (...), and their Copies shall become legible by his appearance. Many
actual sins, many secret thoughts, or evil words, have been daily practiced or
entertained by us, which leave no print or impression in our Fantasies of their
passage. The memory of many gross sins, which for the present make deep
impression, daily wears out or decays to our apprehensions; their print or
Character in some being defaced or obliterated by new ones more gross; as if a
man should write in Capital Letters upon a paper already written in a smaller
See chapter 10.. 9
Character and more obscure. In others, the Records of Conscience, though in
themselves legible, so they would look into them, are wrapped up in multiplicitie
of business. But when the Judge shall appear in his Glory, the Book shall be
fully opened, the Character or impression of every sinful thought or action
shall then become legible; not a syllable of what we have spoken to our selves
shall be lost; and every letter, and every syllable, which has not been washed
away or purified by the Blood of the Lamb, shall be as a stigma, or brand to
the Soul and Conscience, wherein it is found, and shall fret as an incurable
Gangren, or Canker. Every seed of corruption, whether propagated from our first
parents, or sown by our selves, which seemed to lie dead without all motion,
unless they be truly mortified by the spirit, shall at the appearance of the
Sun of Righteousness begin to quicken and grow ripe in a moment. And albeit
these seeds be as many in number as the sand, though our whole flesh or bodily
man be more full of them, then any fishes ventricle is full of Spawn, yet the
least of them shall grow for its malignant quality into a Serpent, and sting
the soul and body, wherein it bred like an Adder. These are the best fruits,
which they that daily sow unto the flesh, shall then reap of the flesh, even
corruption, sorrow, and torments incorruptible and unsufferable, yet
perpetually to be suffered by them. But of the quality and perpetuity of these
pains hereafter by Gods assistance, when we come to the Award or Sentence.

18. Now to conclude; Albeit this (...), this Eternal Word of God, before whose
Judgment Seat we must appear, and to whom we are to render our final account,
were made flesh, to the end and purpose that the very words of God immediately
uttered by himself, which formerly so uttered, did sound nothing but death and
destruction to flesh and blood, might become the very food of life, being thus
distilled and uttered by an Organ of flesh; yet such they are only unto such as
receive him, and are purified in soul and conscience by them. To such as
received him, says S. John, he gave this privilege to become the Sons of God,
John 1. 12. But every man (says the same S. John, 1 Epist. cap. 3. ver. 3.)
that has this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure. As for the
disobedient, and such as wallow in filthiness, the presence or voice of God,
though he appear or speak unto us in our nature, shall not be less dreadful to
them, then it was before the word was made flesh; but rather his appearance in
our nature shall add terror and dread to his voice and presence. And therefore
it is remarkably added by S. John, Rev. 6. 16. that the disobedient shall say
unto the Mountains and Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that
sits upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. For though the wisdom
of the flesh did always include an Enmity unto the purity of the Divine
Nature, yet this Enmity or Antipathie is most directly against the innocence
and integrity of the Lamb; It is under the same Kind with the Enmity of the
woman's seed and the Serpents. nor shall the malignitie of it fully appear or
come unto a perfect Crisis until the Lamb appear in Judgment. He is now a Lamb
mild and gentle, and easy to be entreated by all such, as seek to become like
him in innocence and purity of life, but shall in that day manifest himself
to the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, to execute vengeance upon all such as have
abused his patience and long suffering by continuance in beastlines, or enmity
to Lamb-like innocence and purity. He shall then appear an inflexible Judge,
but yet continues a merciful and loving High Priest to make intercession for
us. Seeing then says St. Paul, Heb. 4. 14. etc. (and it is his Conclusion of
his former description of him, as our Omnipotent Alseeing Judge) that we have a
great High Priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God (this
is a Title more mild and comfortable then the former of (...), The Word of God)
Let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an High Priest, which cannot
be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted
like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne
of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need.
This Time of need, is the day of judgment, or time of death.

But whereby shall we make just proof and trial, whether we hold our profession
fast or no? By no other means, then by the preserving the integrity and
purity of our Conscience: For we do not truly acknowledge or believe him to be
our High Priest, unless we suffer him, whilst it is called to day, to cleanse,
and purify our Consciences. If our heart condemn us not, says S. John, 1.
Joh. 3. 22. then have we confidence toward God. To shut up all with that of
the Prophet Malachi, chap. 3. 2, 3. which is fully Parallel to the former place
of S. Paul, Heb. 12. 12, 13. He shall sit as a refiner and parifier of silver,
and he shall purify the Sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that
they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. So then they must be
Sons of Levi, (that is, men consecrated unto the service of the Lord) and, even
in this life, as gold and silver (though mingled with dross) which hope to
escape that last and Fiery Trial. And such as hope to be made Kings and
Priests unto our God for ever, must in this life be careful and diligent to
practice upon themselves: daily presenting unto Him, First, The Sacrifices of
God, a troubled and broken spirit, (breathing out Prayers, and sending forth
Tears:) and then Their Bodies a Living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable. And
Lastly, The Sacrifice of Praise, that is, the calves or fruit of the lips;
withal, not forgetting to do good, and to communicate, for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased.

19. The Use of all that is said in this whole third Section, concerning
Christ's coming to Judgment, is most flagrantly set down in Powerful and moving
Expressions, by S. Peter, 2. Epist. 3 Chap. And the short of his Three
Inferences, is this, Beloved, I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance
--, knowing that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after
their own lusts; and saying, where is the promise of his coming --? -- But the
Lord is not slack concerning his promise --, but is long suffering to usward,
not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. And
the day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night --. Seeing then that all
these things must be --, What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
conversation and godliness; looking for, and hasting to the coming of the day
of God? Seeing that ye look for these things, be diligent that ye may be found
of him in Peace, without spot, and blemish; and account that the long suffering
of the Lord is Salvation. Ye therefore, Seeing ye know all these Things before,
beware, lest ye also, being led away with the Error of the wicked, fall from
your own steadfastness: But grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
Savior JESUS CHRIST; To Him be Glory both now and for ever.

AMEN.
S. Ambrose's Creed. Lord Jesus, We believe that Thou shall come to be our
Judge. We therefore pray Thee help thy servants whom thou have redeemed with
thy most precious blood. Make them to be Numbered with thy Saints in Glory
Everlasting.
SECTION IV. Of the Resurrection of the Dead.
OF The Five General Heads, Proposed in the so often mentioned ninth Chapter,
we have (after a sort) dispatched The First Three. The Fourth was, The Parties
to be judged; viz. The Quick and the Dead. Of Those that shall be found alive
at the Coming of our Lord, I shall say no more then This (Till I come to the
fifth Head, touching the Final Award:) The One Distinction shall stand with
great Boldness, and with joy lift up their heads, that they, (being caught up
in the Clouds) may meet the Lord in the air, and so be ever with the Lord. The
Other Retchless and most wretched part of mankind, shall, but all in vain, cry
to the Hills to fall upon them, and to the Rocks to cover them from His eyes, to
whom night and Hell are manifest. Of those that sleep in the Dust, The Dead in
Christ shall rise first, and having happily passed the Judgment of Discussion,
shall be amazed at the strangeness of their own Psalm. 32. 1.
salvation so far beyond all they looked for. Then shall The Dead in Sin be
raised also; to receive the Dreadful sentence of Our most worthy Judge
Eternal, and to put on such immortality as shall only make them Capable of
The Wages of Sin which is eternal Death, or Endless vivacitie unto Torments.
The proof of the Resurrection of Both these, is our next Design.

CHAP. XIII.
1. Cor. 15. 12, 13. Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the Dead, How
say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the Dead? But if there be
no resurrection of the Dead, then is Christ not risen. Job. 19. verse. 25. I
know that My Redeemer Lives, and that he shall stand at the later day upon the
earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I
shall see God. Whom I shall see for my self, and mine eyes shall behold, and
not another, though my Reins be consumed within me. Ezekiel. 37. 4. O ye dry
Bones hear the word of the Lord. Behold I will cause breath to enter into you
and ye shall live etc. John. 5. 28. Marvel not at This! for the hour is coming,
in which all that are in the Graves shall hear His voice, And shall come forth;
They that have done Good to the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of Damnation. John. 9. 24. Martha said, I know that
he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last Day. Jesus said, I am the
resurrection and the life etc.
The Belief of This Article of the Resurrection, of High concernment;
malignantly oppugned by Satan and his agents: needs and deserves our best
Fortification. The Heathen had implicit Notions of A Resurrection. The Obstacle
of impossibility, removed, by Proof of This Conclusion; [That though all
things were annihilated, yet God is able to retreive or recover The numerical
same.]

1. SO Admirable is the Constancy of the Celestial Bodies, in their courses,
that every unusual Spectacle in the heavens, be it but the appearance of a
Comet in the air, or of 2 Suns, whereof the one is in the air, not in the
heaven; does always imprint a Terror or amazement in the inhabitants of the
earth. Whence, if we could out of a serious apprehension of both, rightly
compare the face of the heavens, as now it is, with that strange alteration
described by St. John, Rev. 6. 12, 13. as, that the pale moon shall be turned
into blood; that the Sun, which now dazles our eyes with its brightness, shall
become as black as a sackcloth of hair; or that the fixed stars, which have
continued their March from East to West without check or control for almost
6000 years (and yet have kept their ranks without any declination to the right
hand or to the left) shall then begin to reel and stagger like so many drunken
men, and fall to the earth, like as when a figtree casts her green figs,
being shaken of a mighty wind: The very cogitation of this sudden change or
confusion would make death seem a welcome Messenger, and loss of life and
external senses a gainful exchange, if by their loss we might be exempted or
acquit from those fearful Sights, wherewith the eyes, or from those hideous
noyses, wherewith the ears and hearts of all then living shall be filled. But
most men hope for, or at least expect, a dissolution of this sensitive life
before the appearance of that great and terrible day. And this very Imagination
or conceit, that all our senses shall be locked up by death, the ears utterly
deprived of hearing, the eyes of sight; that the whole body, even the heart if
self, being bestript of all feeling or motion, shall put on a thick covering of
sad earth; does, for the most part, benum our senses, enfeeble our faith, and
dead our apprehensions, either of the Terrors of that day, or of the joys,
that shall ensue unto all them that do escape them. Whilst we think of death,
or of their estate which have been long dead and consumed in the grave, we say
in our hearts, not as the Psalmist did, Lord shall the dead praise thee? but
shall the dead fear thee, O Lord? shall such as descend into the pit, are
covered with dust, and resolved into rotteness, be affrighted with thy voice;
or stand amazed at thy appearance? Thus then, as there is no Article of
Christian Faith more available to make men live a Christian life, then this
Article of the last general Judgment; So is there no branch, either of this
general, nor any other Article of Christian Faith in particular, which
requires more fortification, whether from the storehouse of the book of
Nature, or from the book of Grace, then this point of the Resurrection does.
This is the Hold, which Satan the sworn enemy of our Souls eternal peace and
welfare, seeks by all means to surprise, and subvert, and unto whose speedy
surprizal, or utter subversion, flesh and blood have been in all Ages most
prone to yield their consent and furtherance. As Christ Crucified was the main
stumbling block to the Jew: So the preaching of his Resurrection, and of our
hopes of a joyful Resurrection by the power and virtue of His, was the main
rock of offense, 1 Cor. 1. 23
of Contradiction, or gainsaying to the Infidels or irreligious Heathens. When
the Athenians, says S. Luke, Act. 17. 32. (these were the most civil and
learned people amongst the Heathen) heard of the Resurrection of the dead, some
mocked: others said, we will hear thee again of this thing. The rest of his
Learned and Philosophical discourse, all of them heard with atention: and would
he have spoken more, they would have been willing to have heard him longer upon
any other Argument; But their entertainment of this Treatise of the Resurection
was generally so rude, so unrespective on their parts, and so unwelcome to him,
that he immediately departed from them. Howbeit, God did not leave the truth
deliverd by him, even in this point, without competent Testimony; for Denis of
Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris, with some others, did believe Paul; But
these were but a few in respect of them that did not believe, or did mock him.
Now it is a Rule undoubted; that The same motives or temptations, which drew
the heathen to contradict
or oppugn the truth, will abate or weaken the Assent of Christians unto the
same truth unless they be removed by discovery of their original error.

2. The Errors concerning the Final Judgment (in general or indefinitely
considered) are specially Three. The First of such as denied the Divine
Providence Three Errors about the last Judgment.
over men, or did confine it to this transitory life without expectation of any
account or reckoning to be made after death. And these were but few among the
ancient Heathens; to wit, the sect of Epicures, whose opinion was refuted by
the verdict of most other Heathens, and by the contradiction which the denial
of the Divine Providence did include unto the opinions of the Epicures
themselves.

The Second gross Error or branch of infidelity concerning the Final Judgment
was, The denial of the Immortality of the human soul; And this was accounted an
Heresy or impious opinion by the most, and has been exquisitely See Tully De
Senectute.
refuted by the most learned amongst the Heathens.

The third Error or branch of infidelity concerning the Final Judgment, was The
denial, ignorance, or doubt of the Resurrection of the body, or of the whole
man as consisting of body and soul. And this Error in some degree or other was
most general to all the heathen. All such as denied either the Divine
Providence, or the Immortality of the Soul, all such as doubted or were
ignorant of either of these truths, did likewise deny, or were doubtful or
ignorant of the Resurrection of the body. But on the contrary, neither all, nor
most of such as did deny, or were ignorant, or doubtful of the Resurrection of
the body, did either deny or were ignorant or doubtful of the immortality of
the soul.

But no marvel if the heathens, which did not doubt of the immortality of the
soul, were altogether, or for the most part, ignorant of the Resurrection of
the body, when as in this Church of Corinth, which God had visibly graced with
many excellent gifts of the Spirit, there were some, a great sort too many,
which said, There was no Resurrection of the dead; and the Thessalonians, a
people docile and apt to take the impression or most lively character of
Christianity, a people excelling other Christians in brotherly love, were
ignorant, in part, of this great Mystery, and from their ignorance or scant
measure of knowledge in it, did mourn beyond measure for their dead, 1 Thessalonians.
4. 13, etc. Of these Corinthians and Thessalonians, and of the Heathens, that
of our Savior unto the Sadduces, Matthew. 22. 29. is most true. They therefore
erred because they knew not the Scriptures, nor the Power of God.

We are then, First, To remove that Obstacle of Impossibility, which is
pretended Two Points proposed.
from Nature, and may seemingly be argued by natural and Philosophical Reasons.

Secondly, To set down the manner of the Resurrection, and the positive Proofs
of it out of the Scriptures or Word of God.

3. Albeit none of the heathens did expressly acknowledge such a Resurrection as
we believe; although the most of them were ready to deny it when it was
proposed unto them; yet, many of them had diverse Implicit Notions of it. There
were, though not in any one Sect of their Philosophers, yet in diverse Sects,
such scattered Relics or Fragments of this Eternal Truth, as, being skilfully
put together, will represent more then most Christians conceive of it.

The First Fragment or implicit Notion of it was; That ancient Opinion fathered
upon Pythagoras; That the souls of men after their departure from Pythagoras
his broken Notion of a Resurrection
their proper bodies, did (according to their several demeanors) enter into
bruit Beasts, or other creatures. The souls, of men which had been given to
spoil and raven, were, in this Philosophers opinion, to be imprisoned in the
bodies of Wolves, of Lions, or Tigers. Such as had been given over to beastly
pleasures, were to take up their habitations in the bodies of Swine. The souls
of others less harmful, yet stupid and dull, had their transmigration allotted
by this Philosopher into Sheep or Calves. This Metempsychosis, or flitting of
men's souls into the bodies of beasts, is described by Ovid in the 15. of his
Metamorphosis, seeking to give some countenance to his poetical fictions from
Pythagoras his Philosophical opinion plausible in ancient times. And from this
conceit or opinion it was; that Pythagoras and his followers did abstain from
eating of any flesh, whether of birds or beasts, and labored by all See
Juvenal 15. Sat. v. 174.
means to persuade others to like abstinence, lest by killing or devouring
them, they might indeed kill or devour their dearest friends, kinsfolks, or
neighbors.

Mandere vos vestros site, and sentite colonos: The souls of virtuous or good
men, or of better spirits, did in this Philosophers opinion, either go into
some place of happiness, or else return into some humane body again; So as one
and the same man might be often begotten, born; or die. Thus Pythagoras himself
thought that Euphorbus his soul was come into his body, that he himself had
been present at the siege of Troy in the shape and likeness of him that was
called then Euphorbus; whose body was turned to dust long before any part of
this Pythagoras his body was framed. And in the confidence of this opinion or
imagination, he laid claim unto Euphorbus his Shield, as the Right Owner of it.

This Opinion or Imagination, though gross and foolish, does yet include These
Two Branches of Truth. The Solid Truth extract out of Pythagoras his Opinion of
Transmigration.


First, That Animus cujusque est unusquisque, The soul or mind of man is the
man himself.

And Second, That the Soul remains in Being after the Body or visible part
(which is but as the Case or Husk) be dissolved.

Both These, Tully had Collected (as he professes in his Book, De Senectute)
from the followers of Pythagoras, of Socrates, and Plato. These Both, he, (or
the Person he makes Speaker there) repeats in his piece, De Somnio Scipionis.
-- Tu vero -- sic habeto, Te non esse mortalem, sed corpus hoc; nec enim is es,
quem forma ista declarat, sed men's cujusque is est quisque, non ea figura quae
digito monstrari potest. Deum te igitur scito esse --.

Yet were it possible (or had God to whom all things are possible so appointed)
that one and the same immortal soul of man should have its habitation in two,
three, or more, distinct bodies; they should not be so truly many men, as one
and the same man; for the unity or Identity of man's person depends more
immediately and necessarily upon the unity or Identity of the soul, then upon
the unity or Identity of the body. This progress of one and the same soul
through diverse bodies, was not (in the opinion of such as first conceived or
nursed it) to continue for ever. For Pythagoras did not deny an eternal Rest
unto men's souls after this pilgrimage or progress were ended. Vid. For catulum.
lib. 1. page 87, 90.
Now this progress or pilgrimage, as some avouch, was to endure but unto the
production of the third or fourth Body.

4. From Pythagoras and the Druides (whom Pythagoras did rather follow then
teach) Plato did not much differ. All of them in some Points hold good consort
with Christianity; In these especially. Points wherein Heathens held consort
with Christianity.


First, That the soul of man does not perish with the body, from which it is by
death dissolved.

Secondly, That it should go well with such as lived well, and ill with such as
lived amiss, after the dissolution of soul and body.

But how often one and the same soul by Plato's opinion might become a widower,
how long it might so continue, or with how many several bodies it might
successively match, we will not question.

In this and the like particulars Pythagoras and Plato might many ways err
without any gross inconsonancy to their general principles. And one of Plato's
general Principles was, That the humane soul was in the body tanquam nauta in
nave, after such a manner as the Master Mariner is in the ship to direct and
guide it. And as a Mariner may without loss undertake the government of diverse
Ships successively, so one and the same reasonable soul might guide or manage
sundry bodies. In the opinion of Pythagoras or Plato, diversity of actions, of
manners, of dispositions did no more argue diversity of human souls or spirits,
then variety of musical sounds in various wind-instruments (as in the Sackbut,
Cornet, Shalm, or Trumpet) does argue diversity of breath, or of Musicians. One
and the same musician may wind them all successively, and yet the music shall
be much different, because of the diversity of the instrument. In all these
opinions they did only err, not knowing the Scriptures. They did not err
against, at least their error includes no opposition unto, the Power of God.
For if it had pleased him thus to place the soul in the body, or to take it out
of one body, and put it into another, as these Philosophers dreamed, so it
might have been, so it must have been. Nor did their error include any denial
of the Power of God, but rather an approach or step to the discovery or
acknowledgement of it, against modern Atheists.

Others there were, who held a (...), that is, a Regeneration or new production
of one and the same man again. These were the Genethliaci, or
Nativitie-Casters; of whom S. Augustine (out of Varro) speaks, Lib. 22. De The
opinion of the Genethliaci
Civitate Dei, Cap. 28. The time, which (as That Father there says) they
prefixed for this (...), or re-production of the self-same men, which formerly
had been, was 440. years. Though (as you will soon see) other Authors make it
far above that proportion. This particular error of theirs, took its original
from an error common to most Philosophers, whose generally affected custom it
has been, to assign some External cause of every External or visible Effect.
And some modern Astrologers make the heavens such total causes of Sublunary
Effects, that if the position and conjunction of stars should possibly come to
be the self same again, as they formerly have been, the self same bodies should
be produced again, which formerly had been. And 16000 years (I take it) in the
account of these ancient Astrologers, did make up the full period or circuit of
all celestial motions. Now it is a general Maxim in Philosophy, Idem, secundum
Idem, semper producit Idem. If the influence of the stars were the full and
total cause of the Sublunary Effects, it would follow directly, that when the
conjunction of Stars, which (...) his influence, returned the same again which
it had been (...) years more or fewer) the Sublunary Effects or events should
be the same, as they then had been, and the same men which had formerly dyed,
should revive again.

5. The Genethliaci did foully err in imagining the stars or host of heaven, to
be the adaequate or total causes of Sublunary Effects or alterations. They This
Error of the Genethliaci may Facilitate the Christians Belief of Gods Power.
might err again in Calculating the Course of the Stars: and (for ought I
know) they did err in denying, or not avouching the Immortality of the soul.
But herein they come the nearest to us Christians in this Article, That they
held it possible, and agreeable to Nature, for one and the same body, for one
and the same man, consisting of body and soul, which had been dissolved for
many thousand years before, to be restored to life again. But whereas they
thought the conjunction of stars to be the full and total cause of sublunary
effects, let us suppose Gods Will, or Powerful Ordinance, to be the sole cause
of all things, and there willbe no contradiction or impossibility in nature,
why the self same men, which have been, may not be again, albeit they had died
more then 5000. years ago. For his Will, as it is more powerful then all the
influence of stars, so is it more truly One and the same then any conjunction
or aspect of stars can be; yea, His Will or His Power was the true immediate or
total Cause of the Matter of every thing, as well as of its form or soul; The
true cause likewise of the conjunction of the soul and body.

6. It being then admitted that the Genethliaci did deny the Immortality or
perpetual duration of the reasonable Soul; which to deny is a gross heresy in
Christianity; yet this Error in them was more pardonable by much, then the
Inference which some Christians make; who holding the Immortality Some
Christians err as much as the Genethliaci.
of the soul, hold it withal to be an Antecedent so necessary for evincing the
future Resurrection of the body (or restoration of the same man who dies) that
if the soul were not immortal, there could be no resurrection of the body, no
Identical restoration of men that perish and are consumed to dust. They which
deny the Immortality of the soul, do therefore err because they know not the
Scriptures, nor the Will of God revealed in them concerning the state of the
soul after death. For if the soul of Christ, as man, were (as we must believe
it was) of the same nature that our souls are of; if his soul did not die with
his body, our souls shall not die with our bodies.

Now Christ at the very point of death or dissolution of soul and body, did
commend his soul into his Fathers hands. And God the Father took a more special
care of his soul then either Nicodemus, or Joseph of Arimathea did of his body.
That God likewise did take the souls of the faithful into his custody at their
departure from their bodies, our Savior long before had taught us, in his
Answer to the Sadduces, Matthew. 22. 31, 32. As touching the resurrection of the
dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying? I am the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God
of the dead but of the living. And, as St. Luke adds Chap. 20. ver. 38. All
live unto him: not always in their bodies, but always in their souls, which
always expect a second conjunction or reunion to their proper bodies. And St.
Stephen, when his persecutors did destroy his body, commends his soul into
Christ's hands, as Christ had done His Soul into the hands of his Father. So
that no man can doubt of the Immortality or perpetual duration of the soul,
unless he be altogether ignorant of these, and many like passages in the
Scriptures. But they which deny all Possibility of the Resurrection, or
Identical restoration of the same man to bodily life (in case his soul were
mortal, or might utterly cease to be with the body) do err, not only out of
ignorance of the Scriptures, or of The Will of God revealed in Scriptures; but
this their ignorance supposes an ignorance or denial of the Power of God. For
God, who is able out of stones to raise up children unto Abraham, is no less
powerful perfectly to restore the self same body and soul which now are, and
really to represent the self same man which now is, albeit both body and soul
should, at his death, not only die, but be utterly annihilated; that is,
although no more either of body or soul did remain after death then was extant
before the first Creation of all things. Now before the first Creation there
was not so much as a particle or least portion either of man's soul or body; For
all things were created out of Nothing; and all things might be created the
same again that now they are, albeit they were by Gods power, or by
substraction of his influence totally resolved into nothing.

7. All these Propositions following are most true.

1. That as God did make all things of nothing, so he is able, if it should
please him, to resolve all things into nothing. This is essentially included in
the Article Three principal Propositions
of Omnipotency.

So is this Second likewise; Although all things created were resolved into
nothing, God is able to make them again the self same substances that they
sometimes were, or now are.

So likewise is this Third: Albeit the bodies of men be not utterly resolved
into nothing when they die, but into the Elements, of which they consist or are
compounded; as into the Earth, Air, Water, etc. yet every man's body, at the day
of final appearance before our Judge, may be Numerically the same that now it
is.

All these Propositions are Objectively Possible, that is, they imply no
Contradiction in nature; and, not implying any contradiction in nature, they
are the proper Objects of Omnipotent Power. That is, God is able to work all
these Effects in nature, which unto Nature, or natural Causes are impossible.
But that either the souls or bodies of men shall be annihilated or resolved
into nothing, we are not bound to believe; because the Scripture does no where
testify Gods Will or purpose so to resolve them. Their annihilation or
dissolution, their re-production or reunion merely depends upon the Will or
Powerful Ordinance of God. And albeit the Resurrection of one and the same man
may be demonstrated to be in Nature possible: Yet, That this Possibility shall
be reduced into Act; That every Man shall undoubtedly rise again in the body,
to receive that which he has done in his body: Or, With what manner of body
for qualifications they shall arise, This cannot be taught by Nature, but must
be learned or believed from Scripture.

To begin with the Second Proposition [Although all things created were
resolved into nothing, God is able to make them again the self same numerical
substances, that they sometime were, or now are.]

For Proof of this Proposition, I take as granted; That all things, which by
Creation took their beginning, had a true Possibility of being numerically
That there is a Logical Possibility presupposed to the working of Gods Power.
See Book 10. Fol. 3177.
what they were, before they actually were: otherwise it was impossible for
them actually to have been. Now this Possibility (allotted to every thing
before it be) of being numerically what it is (or has been) was not limited
unto This or That set Point or tract of time, but was of it self, indifferent
unto all times, from eternity. All the Coexistence, which any thing created
has with this or that part of time, is not from any essential dependence
which it has on this or that time, but merely from the Will or Pleasure of the
eternal Creator, who has appointed to every thing a set time or season. The
self same men which now are, might have been an hundred years ago; or, if their
birth or production had been deferred till a hundred years after this present
time, they might by their Creators appointment be Then the same men that now
they are. Their Actual Being in this Age, does not take away the The bringing
Possibility into Act, does not impair Gods power, but shows the exercise of
it, pro hac vice. See. 9.
Possibility either of being before this Time or after it: For, Possibility
is perpetual, and at all times reducible into Act, whenever it shall please
the Creator to appoint or allott it actual Being or existence. The Reduction
of Possibility into Act (which is the perfection thereof) does not prejudice
or diminish the Creators Power of doing the like again; though the doing of it
once makes it impossible that the doing of it again should be the first time or
Turn of doing it. The omiting or forbearance to bring Possibility into Act, in
the time past, does not lapse it more then pro illa vice. It leaves us this
possibility, now truly to say; That which was not done a thousand years ago
might have been then done; and the like or same may yet be done by The Power
Almighty. As every body endued with Color is always visible, though there be
no eye present to look upon it, (for it is therefore truly visible, in that
any creature endued with sight may actually see it so often as it shall please
to look upon it:) So, every thing which implies no contradiction in nature, is
always truly Possible; and therefore eternally Possible, because The Eternal
may give it actual Being or existence at all times, when it pleases him. This
Possibility is at all times the object of his Omnipotent Power, as visibilitie
is of sight; and, as whatsoever is visible may at all times be seen by a clear
eye; so whatever is possible may at all times be done or made by God.

8. It is evident, That God by his Power has given all things, which now are,
or heretofore have been, actual Being; that is, he has created them. Creation
is the making all things of Nothing: Annihilation is the reducing of any thing
that has been made, into Nothing. Both acts are proper only unto the These
differ, as Addition and Substraction.
Omnipotent Creator. Suppose then some man or Angel had been annihilated by his
Omnipotent Power a thousand years ago; It is yet as possible for the same man
or Angel to be made again, as it was for him to be made at the first. And the
Reason is this; Annihilation could take nothing from him, save only that which
Creation gave him. But Creation only gave him Actual Being or existence;
Therefore annihilation only takes away actual being or existence, not the
Possibility of Being; for that he had before he could be created. Seeing then
Creation did not give man or Angel Possibility of Being, which was eternally
included in the Creators Power; Annihilation
does not dissolve or destroy this Possibility, but leaves it only, as
Creation found it. And whilst the Possibliitie remains the same, it is still
the same Object of the same Omnipotent Power, and may as easily be reduced into
Act a thousand years hence, as it was in the first Creation.

To make this Problem more plain by Demonstrating it upon a particular. Adam
the firstman was Created upon the 6. day from the beginning of time, wherein
the heavens and earth were made of nothing. Now no distinction of time, which
did then begin to be; no secret power or virtue of time, (which is but a
circumstance of things that are) could either hinder or limit the Creators
Power for creating of Adam upon the first day, or give any furtherance to his
power for creating him upon the sixth day, rather then upon the twelfth or 13.
day from the beginning of the Creation. Admitting his Creation had been
deferred until the twelfth day, this deferring of his Creation could have been
no let or hinderance why he might not have been the self same man which was
created the sixth day. As if any man should cast a bullet in the same mould at
twelve of the clock, which he had purposed to cast at eight, but did deferr the
casting of it till that time, either upon pleasure, or interposition of other
occasions; that delay would no way argue the bullet molded at that time not to
be the very self same which it would have been, if it had been cast four hours
before, or four hours after.

The Models of all things created, or possible to be created, are more
certainly, and more constantly contained in the Almighty Creators Power or
Wisdom, then any Models which man can make, are in man's power and skill. And
so are all the creatures likewise more exactly answerable to the Models
contained in his Power and Wisdom, then any bullet or other materials can be
to the mould, wherein they are cast. Difference of time or delay of their
production can breed no difference at all in the things produced, so long as
every one is produced according to that exact Model, or exemplary form which
it had in God from Eternity. According to this pattern or model, the first man
(as Scripture tells us) was created upon the sixth day: Suppose the same
Creator had annihilated him upon the eighth day; This Annihilation supposed,
there is no impossibility or difficulty imaginable, why he might not upon the
twelfth or thirteenth day have been created again the self same man he was upon
the sixth day; seeing it was possible for God to have deferred his Creation
till that day, and yet to have created him the self same individall person,
that was created upon the sixth day.

9. Neither the exercise of Gods Almighty Power in creating Adam upon the sixth
day, nor the supposed exercise of the same power in annihilating him the eighth
day, could breed any prejudice to the possibility of being created the self
same man upon the twelfth or thirteenth day, which he had been from his first
Creation to his annihilation. Indeed to say, That Adam, being created the sixth
day, and supposed to be annihilated upon the eighth day, and created again upon
the twelfth or thirteenth day, should be then first created, would imply a
contradiction. But it is one thing to say, there be two Creations, another to
say; there be two distinct creatures, or two distinct substances created. A man
might be twice created, and yet not be two distinct creatures, but numerically
and Identically one and the self same man which he was, as perfectly one and
the self same man, as if he had been but once created, or had continued from
his creation without any interruption of his duration or existence. This
implies no more contradiction in nature, then to say; that the King may create
one and the same man twice Earl or Duke, or make him often the same Magistrate.
The Office or dignity may be the self same, albeit there be some vacancie or
interruption in the Administration or duration of it. As if a man was deposed
of his Office and dignity at the end of the first year, and restored again at
the end of the second year; this would imply a diversity of Creation or
advancement, no diversity at all in the Office or dignity, unto which the
same person is twice advanced. Now Gods Power over all his creatures, either
utterly to annihilate them, or to interrupt them in their actual existence or
duration, and to create them in the self same or better estate again, is far
greater and more Sovereign, then any Princes civil power to advance or depose
his subjects, or to restore them entirely to their former dignities. Admit
then, That God had resolved the first man Adam into nothing at the very first
instant, wherein he did eat the forbidden fruit, with purpose not to create him
again until the last trumpet shall sound to Judgment; the Terror of that day
should make as deep impression in him then first restored to life and sense
again, as if he had suffered him to live but one day, and had called him at
even unto Judgment or a final account as terrible as in that last day it shall
be to all that die in their sins. This whole time of vacancy or cessation from
actual Being for almost six thousand years would not have seemed so long to him
at his Resurrection, as a night past over in a dead sleep is to a malefactor,
which had murdered his Father in the Evening, and is drawn to the execution as
soon as he awakes in the morning.

Thus much of Gods Power in general to raise up the self same men again, which
have been long dead, or, by supposition, more then dead, utterly resolved into
nothing. Now if we must acknowledge it as an essential Branch of the Almighty
Creators Power to be able to raise up or create the self same men again,
although they had been annihilated or turned to nothing, we must needs
acknowledge it as a fruit or effect of the same Power, to reunite every man's
soul and body again at the last day; seeing the soul (as Christian Faith does
teach us) does still remain the same it was, the body being not utterly
annihilated or consumed to nothing, but only resolved into dust, or into the
Elements, of which it was first made. Sed quomodo, inquis, dissoluta materia
exhiberi potest? Consider a temetipsum O homo, and fidem rei invenies. Recogita
quid fueris antequam esses, utique nihil; meminisses enim, si quid fuisses. Qui
ergo nihil fuer as priusquam esses, idem nihil factus, cum esse desieris, cur
non posses esse rursus de nihilo ejusdem ipsius Auctoris voluntate, qui te
voluit esse ex nihilo? Quid novi tibi eveniet? qui non eras, factus es:
cumiterum non eris, fies. Read rationem, si potes qua factus es, and tunc
require, qua Fies. Et tamen facilius utique fies, quod fuisti aliquando, quia
aeque non difficile factus es, quod nunquam fuisti aliquando --. Quaecunque te
materia, destruxerit, hauserit, aboleverit, in nihilum prodegerit, reddet te;
ejus est nihilum ipsum, cujus est totum. This is the sum of Tertullian's
Collections, Apolog. cap. 48.

10. This Power of God to create man of nothing, and to create every one the
self same man he was, albeit he had been annihilated or turned into nothing;
The School Divines of the Romish Church acknowledge, and with great subtilty of
wit and strength of Argument prove out of the Article of Gods Omnipotency,
unto which all Possibility merely Logical, (or which implies no evident
contradiction in nature) is always subject and obedient. But of This, as of
most other Orthodoxal Doctrines or Principles of Faith, The Jesuit makes a
Sinister use of this Truth touching The Power of God.
wherein we hold communion and consort with the Roman Church, the modern
Advocates of that Church, the Jesuits especially, make a very malicious and
Sinister use. The most learned amongst the modern Jesuits, being pressed by
our Writers with the gross absurdities and scandalous inconveniences, which
necessarily follow upon their doctrine of Transubstantiation, or of Christ's
local Circumscriptive bodily presence in the blessed Sacrament; Fly to this
doctrine of Gods Almighty Power, whereby he is able to create one and the self
same Individual Substance again and again, as often as it pleases him, as to
their last Hold and refuge. Their only hope is, that this General Doctrine
being made plausible by them, they shall be able to make their quarrel Just,
not in it self, but upon expected advantage; if any of our Writers should be so
forward (as in diverse other Cases some have been too forward) to deny their
Antecedents, when as they should Traverse the Inference or conclusions, which
they labor with subtlety to infer from plausible and Orthodoxal Premises.
Howbeit this Antecedent [That God is able to create the self same man or bodily
substance again, and again, and as often as it shall please him] no Protestant
Writer (to my observation) has yet denied, none as I hope, will ever deny. But
such is our adversaries confidence of Christ's promise to St. Peter, I have
prayed for thee, that thy faith shall not fail, Luke 22. 32. and of the Popes
authority, as of Peter's pretended Successor in this promise; that whatsoever
doctrine the Pope shall deliver ex Cathedra (as he has done this doctrine of
Transubstantiation) for a point of Faith, they think God bound in Justice to
use his absolute and Omnipotent power to make it true. For if the Pope or the
visible Romish Church could possibly err in this or any other point of faith,
God (by their doctrine) should fail in the performance of his former general
promise, which undoubtedly he will not do, so long as he has power to make his
promise good, or to make the visible Churches interpretations true and
justifiable; to the preservation of whose Infallibility he has (as they teach)
bound himself by solemn promise,

11. But, The Question betwixt us and them, Concerning Christ's local or
circumscriptive Bodily presence in the Sacrament; is not, whether God can make
one and the same body, to be, at one and the same time, in diverse places; or
whether He can create one and the same body again in every hour, or in every
place, as shall seem good to him; But whether it be his will to use this his
power? Or whether his will thus to do, be so fully revealed in Scripture, as
that we are bound to believe, That he does or will make Christ's very Body and
Blood to be locally present in every place where, and at all times when, that
blessed Sacrament shall be celebrated.

This we deny; And the former Principle or Antecedent [That God is able to
create the self same body as often as it pleases him] will never infer their
intended Conclusion. Not to question what God can do; we further add [For
Christ's body, or whole Christ God and man, to be bodily present, by this means,
in many places at once, or in all places at all times wherein that blessed
Sacrament shall be celebrated, is one of those things, which, according to
their rules as well as ours, cannot be done, as implying an evident
Contradiction in nature:] It may not be believed nor imagined, because God did
never bind any man to believe such an impossibility, or Contradiction, as is
involved in this doctrine. It is altogether without the compass of the most
miraculous work, which God has at any time wrought, or ever promised to work.
All the former Instances or Cases possible, concerning Gods Power to make one
and the same man again after he had been annihilated, are most unlike to their
intended Conclusion. All the former Instances or suppositions are free from all
color or suspicion of Contradiction in nature. This supposed Creation of
Christ's Body often since his death, implies as many and as manifest
Contradictions, as there have been Masses in the Romish Church.

Not only these Assertions, but the dissimilitude also of the Case in question,
to the former Cases, will be immediately made clear from the very Definition of
Creation. To create a body is to make it of nothing; and to make the self same
Body which formerly had been, but is resolved into Nothing, out of Nothing
again, is but a second exercise of his Creative Power; and whatsoever God
before has done, he is able to do the same again. But the Body of Christ they
acknowledge to be immortal, and absolutely exempted, not only from Annihilation
or resolution into Nothing, but from all danger of Corruption or diminution.

Again, whatsoever is Created, whether at the first, second, or third time,
has no Actual being until it begin to be by Creation: Now to make that very
thing begin to be, or to begin to be out of nothing, which already actually is,
is something, is immortal, and more glorious then any other creature, implies a
manifest Contradiction. But Christ's Body they grant to be immortal since his
Resurrection, more unalterable then the heaven of heavens, so immortal that it
can never cease to be what it is; therefore it is impossible that it should
begin to be by a new creation, or be created again. For that which is created,
or may be created again, must first be resolved into nothing, or cease to be,
before it can be created again (seeing creation is the making of that, which is
not, out of Nothing) or be made again by means miraculous. If then Christ's Body
be locally present in the Sacrament, it must either be created again, and this
supposes either annihilation or dissolution of it; or else it must be brought
out of the heavens into the Priests hands; or else the presence of it in many
places must be created: but Local Presence is altogether incapable of Creation,
for it is a Mere Relation, which can neither be created nor made, but resulteth
from, or follows upon the motion (of things created) from one place to
another, or from their creation or beginning to be in that place, wherein they
are said to be created.

12. So it fares with our Adversaries in this Argument, as it does with
Boot-halers or night-riders which have caught an unlawful prey, being hotly
pursued by the right owners. Now their manner is to divide the spoil and their
company, that they may carry one part one way, and another part another way;
that so whilst one is pursued, others may escape without pursuit or rescue of
the prey. Through the ignorance or carelessness of Gods people, which should
have kept a better watch over their own souls, the Romish Priests had made a
gainful prey by transporting the native sense of our Saviors Words in the
institution of the Sacrament to justify the doctrine of Transubstantiation.
And since they have been pursued by reformed Writers, as Cozeners and Cheaters
of Gods people, some of them run one way, some The several Shifts of Romish
Writers, to maintain their Doctrine of Transubstantiation.
another; Some of them seek to maintain Christ's local presence or
Transubstantiation by the former doctrine of Gods Almighty Power, which is able
to create one and the same body often: Others seek to maintain the same
doctrine, and carry away the prey by the manner of Angelical motion from one
place to another in an instant or moment of time. And if they could draw such
as pursue them into these straits and subtilities, they hope to make their part
good against such, as are not much conversant in the School-mens nice disputes
concerning the nature or motions of Angels, or know not the difference between
the nature and motions of Spirits and Spiritual Bodies. Others seek to maintain
the same doctrine by the infinity of divisible quantities; (as if it were
possible for a flies wing to overspread the whole earth, as a hen does her
chickens:) And that Christ's Body may, by this kind of Infinity, be in many
places at once, in as many as God shall appoint: hoping by this means to cast a
mist before the eyes of such Readers, as know not the difference betwixt a real
material or substantial, and a mathematical or imaginary quantity. But all
these fictions or suppositions they cast forth only to offer play unto their
adversaries, or to gain some time for invention of new shifts. None of them
dare pitch upon any or all of these ways or imaginations, or put the Case upon
this issue, Whether any of them be in nature possible or agreeable to the
Analogy of Faith: The only point wherein they agree is, the submission of
their judgments or imaginations to the authority of the Church; which is no
better agreement, then if amongst a multitude of unlearned men, one of them
should maintain, that snow is white, another black, another pawn his estate
that it is blew, and a fourth that it is green, and yet in the end refer
themselves to be tried by some Philosopher, which had written of the nature of
Snow in a language that none of them understands, whose books they know not
where to find. For what the Church is that cannot err, or of whom it consists,
the French and Italian Catholics do not agree. Or if we take the Church for
the Trent Council confirmed by the Pope, the Jesuits themselves cannot agree
about the meaning of it in this point. Diverse of them do in Effect deny any
Transubstantiation in this Sacrament; albeit that Council under pain of curse
enjoyneth all Christians to believe, That there is a true Conversion of the
bread into the substance of Christ's Body, and of the wine into the substance of
his Blood, and that this conversion is rightly called Transubstantiation: So
that in fine, the unity, whereof the children of that Church do so much brag,
is not an unity of faith or belief, but an unity of faction or conspiracy for
their own gain; such as may be between the Jews, the Turks, the Heathens, and
the Arian heretics which denied the Divinity of Christ, to rob or spoil the
Orthodoxal or true Catholic Christians.

13. Most men have often read; All almost have often heard of a Twofold
Resurrection. The one from death in sin, unto newness of life: The other from
bodily death, unto glory and immortality. The second Resurrection is the End of
our whole life here on earth; the first Resurrection from death in sin to
newness of life, is the mean most necessary for attaining this joyful and happy
End. Now as the second Resurrection from bodily death unto glory, is the End of
the first Resurrection from sin to newness of life: So is the first
Resurrection the End of the blessed Sacrament, or solemn commemoration of
Christ's death till he come to Judgment. And although the Omnipotent Power of
God, by which all things were created of nothing, be the most prime and
powerful Cause of the second Resurrection; yet of our Resurrection unto that
Glory and Immortality, whereof Christ is now possessed, Christ, as man, is not
only the Idaeal or Exemplarie, but the immediate Efficient, or working Cause
also: Howbeit the power of his Efficiency or working, as man, be derived from
the Omnipotent Power of the Godhead dwelling in him bodily. But unto the real
participation of this All-powerful Influence from Christ's humanity, by which
the dead shall be quickened, by which these mortal bodies shall be clothed with
glory and immortality, the bodily or local presence of Christ is not required
by the Romish Church. It does not hold it necessary, that all or any body,
which shall be quickened or raised to Glory, shall first swallow Christ's Body,
or be touched by it. Of Angelical ministry or service for gathering the
dispersed relics of men's bodies, which have been dissolved by death, some use
there shall be in the last day, as some Romanists, with diverse Ancients, think:
but no use at all of any Mass-Priest to make Christ's Body to be locally present
unto all, that shall be quickened by it. There shall be no need then of
Transubstantiating Sacramental bread into Christ's Body, or wine into his blood
for giving life unto those, that have been long dead, or for effecting that
change, which shall be wrought in the living; Now, if by the mere virtual
presence of Christ's Body and Blood, the men which have been long dead, shall be
restored to perfect life and immortality; shall not the souls of all, which
receive him in the Sacrament by Faith and true repentance, be raised to Newness
of life by the same virtual presence, without any Of Christ's virtual influence.
See Book 10. chapter 55, 56.
local touch of His Body, but only by that sweet Influence, which daily issues
from this Sun of righteousness now placed at the Right hand of God as in its
proper Sphere. This manner of Christ's presence, of his real presence in the
Sacrament, to wit, by powerful Influence from his Humanity, our Church did
never deny; nor does God the Father, or Christ the Son deny this Real Influence
of life unto any, that hunger and thirst after it in the Sacrament.

CHAP. XIV.
1 COR. 15. 36, etc. But some will say, How are the dead raised up? and, With
what body do they come.?

Thou Fool! That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die, etc.


That this Argument, drawn from Seed sown, is a Concludent Proof of the
Resurrection of The Body.

THe Questions are Two; First, How the dead shall be raised? The second, With
what bodies shall they come forth? The Corinthian Naturalist his Two curious
Questions.


The former imports thus much; How is it possible that the Dead shall be
raised? Or, it being admitted that it is possible for the dead in some sort or
manner to arise to life; the next branch of the same Question is, in what
particular manner they shall de Facto arise? as whether by Gods Creative Power,
by which he made all things of nothing; or by his Conservative Power, by which
he preserves all things that are, in their proper Being; or advances them to
an higher estate or better Tenure of Being?

The second Question or Quaerie is, With what kind of bodies shall the dead
arise? Whether with the self same bodies wherein they died? Or if not every way
the same, what alteration or change shall be wrought in them?

Unto Both these Questions our Apostle vouchsafes but this one Answer, (...) O
Fool! that which thou sowest St. Paul's first Answer to both Questions.

But this Answer may seem in the first place to break the Rule of Christian

erroneous and ignorant, were yet Christian, though weak brethren; and the Law
is general: he that shall say unto his brother, THOU FOOL, shall be guilty of
Hell fire, Matthew. 5. 22.

The Rule indeed is General, if this or the like opprobrious speech be hatched
out of malice, leavened wrath, or invetered hatred: But this sentence they do
not incur, out of whose mouths these or the like speeches issue by The Answer
to that Objection.
way of just reproof or instruction; as from a Master to his Scholars, or from
a Lord to his Servants, in points wherein they err, and are to be corrected or
instructed by him. In these cases, or upon these occasions, their censure
passes rather upon the folly, then upon the persons of them, whom they so
chastise, correct, or seek to instruct. And it is not altogether impertinent
which some have noted upon that place, That our Apostles censure does not aim
at any particular or determinate person, but it is indefinitely directed to all
those, which seriously make the former questions, either concerning the
Possibility of men's arising from the dead, or the particular Manner how this
Resurrection should be wrought, or with what bodies they should come forth.

But many such, as will confess his reason or Argument to be free from breach
of Christian Charity or good manners, will question the Logical strength or
pertinence of it. The strength or efficacy of it, is questionable upon These
points; As first, How the daily experiment of seed-corn, which A second
objection in point of sufficiency.
first dies and is quickened again, can infer the Fundamental conclusion by our
Apostle intended; to wit, the Resurrection of men's bodies, which have been dead
and rotten for many hundred years, and their Relics dispersed into so many
several Elements, or places, that if the seed-corn which men sow, were but
dispersed into half so many places; the husbandman should in vain expect an
increase, or his seed again. Secondly, admitting this yearly experiment of the
seed dying and reviving were of force sufficient to enforce our belief of the
former conclusion, that the bodies of men dead may be raised to life again, yet
the manner or ground of his inference would be impertinent, if not
contradictory to the principal conclusion intended by him, which we are bound
explicitly to believe. For it is not enough to believe that the bodies of men,
which are committed to the grave, shall not utterly perish, but be quickened
again, (as the corn which is covered with the ground:) but we are bound further
to believe, That every man shall arise with his own body, with the same very
body, wherein he lived, that he may receive his doom according to that which he
has done in the body, whether it be good or bad. This conclusion is not
included in the Apostles inference or Experiment drawn from the corn, which
grows out of the putrified seed: for he expressly affirms in the ver. 37.
that the body, which springs out of the ground, is not the same seed that is
sown.

2. In Answer to the former difficulty, some good Commentators there be, The
Answer to this objection.
which grant that our Apostles instance in the seed, which first dies and is
afterward quickened, is not a Concludent proof or forcible Reason, but rather a
similitude or Exemplification; and it is the property or character of
similitudes or examples, illustrant, non docent, they may illustrate the truth
taught, they do not teach or confirm it. Tertullian with other of the Fathers
have diverse illustrations or exmeplifications of the Resurrection in the
course of nature, out of all which it would be hard to extract a full
Concludent proof. Lux quotidie interfect a resplendet, The light daily
vanishes and recovers brightness again; darkness goes and comes by an
interparallel course to the removal of light. Sidera defuncta reviviscunt. The
stars daily set, or fall, and rise again. The seeds of vegetables do not
fructify until themselves be dissolved and corrupted. All things sublunary
are preserved by perishing, their reformation or renewing supposes a defacing.
Many of these and like observations, taken out of the book of Nature, may serve
as Emblemes or devices for emblazoning or setting forth our hopes or belief of
the Resurrection; But concludent proofs they cannot be, unless we grant that
the Book of nature has by Gods appointment, Types, or silent Prophecies of
Divine mysteries, as well as has the book of Grace. But shall we say or
believe that the Apostles inference in this place is only Emblematical or
Allegorical? or rather a Physical or Metaphysical Concludent Proof? Aproof, not
only against such as acknowledge the truth of the Old Testament or written word
of God, but a proof (so far as it concerns the possibility of a Resurrection)
contained in the Book of nature? His conclusion, he supposes, might by
observant Readers be extracted out of the Instance or Experiment which he
brings. For unless out of the Instance given in the Corn, which first dies and
afterward is quickened, the Possibility of the Resurrection, of such a
Resurrection as he taught, might concludently be proved; they which doubted of,
or denied this truth, had not incurred the censure of folly, they had not
deserved the Title or name of fools. But not to be able to read that, which was
legible in their own books; that is, in the works of nature, was a childish
folly; a folly, which in men of years and discretion could not proceed but from
insufferable incogitancy or negligence. If we examine the Apostles inference
according to the Rules of true Philosophy, which never dissents from true
Divinity, his Instances are concludent, his Argument is an Argument of
proportion, a majore ad minus, from the greater to the less. All the
difficulty is in framing or setting the Terms of it aright.

3. All the exceptions, which are taken against his proof, are reducible to
this Exceptions against the Proof.
one general Head; That he argues, or makes his inference, from the works of
nature unto a work supernatural, or from the generation of vegetables ordinary
in the course of nature, unto the Resurrection of our bodies, which can be no
work of nature, no generation; but a work as supernatural as Creation. But they
which thus Object, should consider that those works, which we term works of
Nature The Exceptions answered.
(as generation of vegetables, the increase of the earth, the fruit of trees,
and the like) are not in our Apostles Philosophy any way opposite to the works
of God, or to works miraculous and supernatural. This Proposition is in his
Divinity, and in true Philosophy, most certain; [Whatsoever nature works, God
does work the same:] and he works the same immediately, though not by himself
alone, for nature works with him, though immediately by him. But the former
Proposition is not convertible; that is, we cannot say, that God works nothing
without the Co-agencie of nature, as we say, that nature works nothing
without the cooperation or Power of God. Nature works nothing, cannot
possibly work without the power and direction of God; God works many things,
since the world was made by him, or nature created by him, without the
association or cooperation of nature, or any causes natural. And the works
which he works by himself alone, either without the association or
interposition of causes natural, or contrary to the ordinary course of nature;
are properly called works miraculous or supernatural; and Miraculous they are
called, not because they always argue a greater or more immediate exercise of
Gods Power, then is contained in the works of nature; but in that they are
unusual, and without the compass of ordinary Observation. Sometimes those
works, which are truly miraculous, may less participate of the Almighty Power,
then the usual works of nature do. It was a true miracle, that the Sun should
stand still in the vale of Aialon; but Works truly miraculous may have a less
share of Gods Power then usual works of nature.
not therefore a Miracle in that it did argue a greater manifestation of Gods
Power, then is daily manifested in the course of nature or works of other
creatures; But a great Miracle only in that it was so rare and unusual. The
daily motion of the Sun about the earth, if we search into the true and prime
causes of it, includes a greater measure or more branches of the Almighty
Ceators Power, then the standing still of the Sun, did, in the days of Joshua,
or the going back of it did in the days of Hezekiah. For in our Apostles
Divinity, Act. 17. 28. We live and move and have our being in God; that is,
all things that are have their being in him, and from him; their being is but a
participation of his infinite being. The life of all things living, is but a
participation or shadow of his Life; The Motion of all things that move, is but
the participation of his Power: so that when the Sun did cease to move or stand
still in the days of Joshua, it was partaker only of his Power sustentative,
or of that power by which he supporteth all things; It ceased to move, only by
mere substraction or cessation of his motive Power, by whose virtue or
influence it daily, like a Gyant-runs his course. Thus daily to run its course
it could not, without a positive force or power communicated unto it from The
Creator in whom (as the Apostle speaks) it moves. But it ceased for a while to
move, without any positive force or power to inhibit or restrain its course;
But, as we said, by mere substraction of that power, by which it moves. So long
as it continues its course, it both moves and has its Being in God, and it is
partaker of two branches of His Almighty Power. But when it stood still, it
only had its Being in him. The influence of the other branch of Power was
intercepted. Now the Argument drawn from those works, which we call, The works
of nature, unto works miraculous or supernatural, would in this case hold a
majore. He that daily makes the Sun to compass the world, is able to stay its
course when he pleases.

4. A miracle likewise it was, and a great one too, that The three Children
should be untouched in the midst of the flaming furnace: yet neither was there
a greater nor more immediate positive effect of Gods Power in the restraint of
that fire then, then was in the sustaining other Fire, which at other times
devoured the bodies of his Saints, The Holy Martyrs, who loved not their lives
unto the death, but gave them up for the Testimony of the Lord Jesus: For,
Without the cooperation or concurse of Gods Power, the fire could not have
touched their bodies. Wherein then did the Miracle, Recorded in Daniel, and
experienced in the three children, properly consist? Not so much, if at all, in
fencing their bodies from the violence of the flame, by imposition or infusion
of any new created quality into their bodies, as in substracting or
withdrawing his ordinary Cooperation from the fire, whose natural property is
to consume or devour bodies combustible; such as the bodies of the three
Children by nature were. The only cause, why the fire did not burn them, was,
the substraction or withdrawing of Gods Co-operative Power, without whose
strength or assistance the hottest furnace, that Art or experience can devise,
cannot exercise the most natural operation of fire. For as the substance of the
fire cannot subsist, or have any place in the Fabric of this universe, unless
it be supported by Gods Power sustentative; So neither, whilst it subsists or
has actual being amongst Gods creatures, can it work or move without the
assistance of Gods co-operative or all-working Power. In Him both these Powers
are one; both, as he is, are infinite: But as communicated unto his creatures
they are not altogether one, but two participated branches of his infinite
Power. And in the burning of the Martyrs, or in other destructions made by
fire; both branches, as well of his sustentative, as of his co-operative power,
are manifested; Whereas in the preserving of the three Children from the
violence of the flaming furnace, the one branch only; to wit, His Power
sustentative, was communicated to the fire; the other branch, to wit, the
participation of his co-operative or working Power, was, for the time being,
lop't off from the body or substance of the fire. Now this withdrawing of his
co-operative Power from the fire, was a true document or proof that he is the
God and guide of nature. That without him the fire, even whilst it is for
nature and substance most complete, cannot perform the proper work or exercise
of its nature. The necessary consequence of which Proof or experiment is this;
That he is the Author or fountain as well of all the works or exercises of
natural causes, as of natural bodies or substances themselves. And if we
consider his Power, not in it self, but as communicated to his Creatures or
natural Agents, it is and ought to be acknowledged greater in See this Authors
Sermons, printed at Oxon. Anno 1637. page 39, 40.
those works which we call works of nature, and of which we have daily
experience; then it was in either of these two Miracles before mentioned. Both
of them were for this Reason only Miraculous, in that they were most unusual,
and without the circuit of any experiment or observation in the course of
nature before the times, wherein they happened.

5. To raise Men's Bodies out of the Grave, or out of the Elements into which
they have been dissolved, is far more unusual, then to raise up Corn out of
putrified seed; and in this respect the Resurrection, which we hope for, must
be acknowledged a work more Miraculous and wonderful, then the yearly springing
of Corn, of fruits, of herbs, or grass. But may we say in this Case as in the
former, that the Power of God is no less, but rather greater, in these ordinary
works of nature (as in causing herbs, fruit, or corn to sprout or fructify
with advantage of increase) then it shall be in the Resurrection of the dead;
which is a work, not of Nature, but miraculous and supernatural; a work in
which natural Causes shall not be entertained nor employed by God? No: there
shall be a manifestation of greater Power, then either of Gods Sustentative
Power, by which all things, that were created, are still preserved; or of His
Co-operative Power, without whose participation nothing, which is so preserved,
can work at all, or perform the exercises of its proper nature. The Power
indeed, by which He Preserves all things, is the self same Power, by which He
Made all things out of nothing. The Preservation of things that are, is but a
continuation or proroguing of the first Creation. As all things are made of
Nothing; so would they instantly return into Nothing, were they not continually
supported and preserved by the self same Power, by which they begun to Be, when
they were not. Creation and preservation differ only in sensu connotativo,
only in relation, not in substance. Creation includes a Negation of Being
before; For all things, that are, took their beginning by Creation.
Conservation supposes a beginning of things that are, and includes a Negation
of their returning into nothing. These Two Negations being abstracted or
sequestered, the Creation of all things and their Conservation, are as truly and
properly the same Power or work of one and the same party, as the way from
Athens to Thebes, and from Thebes to Athens is the same.

But if the Continuation of things, that are, be a Creation; or if the self
same Almighty Power be still manifested in the preservation of things temporal,
that was manifested in the first Creation, what greater power can be manifested
in the Resurrection from the dead, then is daily manifested, and ought to be
acknowledged in the preservation and daily increase of herbs, of fruits, of
corn sown, and springing out of the earth? Or if any greater power shall be
manifested in the Resurrection from the dead, then is daily experienced in
these works of nature, how shall we justify our Apostles Argument in this
place to be an Argument of proportion, or an Argument (as we said before) from
the greater to the less, or an Argument a pari, from The like Case or
Instance? The Argument indeed would directly follow; He that is able to make
men live again, that have been dead for a thousand years, is also able to
quicken the corn in the next month, which died the last month. This kind of
Argument would be as clear, as if you should say, That he, that is able to make
ready payment of a thousand pounds, may soon and easily pay an hundred. But you
would take it as an impertinent or indiscreet allegation to say, I know this
man is able to pay you an hundred pounds, therefore I would persuade you to
take his bond for a thousand. But our Apostles Argument in this place may seem
less probable, and it is, at least to appearance, but Thus; God daily raises
up corn within a year after it is sown. Ergo, he shall raise up Adams body,
which was consumed to dust five thousand years ago.

6. To frame the Apostles Argument, which is an Argument of Proportion, aright,
you must take his Principles or grounds into your consideration. Now he first
supposes, and takes it (as all good Christians ought to do) for granted, that
God does give that body unto every seed with which it arises or comes out of
the ground. The increase of things sown or planted, is not, in his Language or
Philosophy, the mere Effect or gift of Nature; For even Nature her self, or
whatsoever she has to bestow, is the gift of God. That which Philosophers call
Nature is in true Divinity nothing else, but The Law which God has set to
things natural, or subject to change or motion. Now he which made this Law,
whether for guiding bodies sublunary or celestial, can dispense with it at his
pleasure. He sometimes inhibits the ordinary course of the Law of Nature by
substraction, as it were, of his Royal Assent; or by suspending the concurrence
of his Operative Power; And sometimes again he advances the state of things
natural, by creating or making a New Law unto the manner of their Being, or of
their Operations; that is, he changes their Qualities, though not their
Natures or Essences. Thus much presupposed or premised, our Apostles Inference
is as firm and strong, as it is Emphatical; Stulte! Tu quod Seminas --. O Fool!
that which THOU sowest is not quickened, except it die etc. The force or
Emphasis may be gathered thus. If God does give a body unto that seed, which
thou sowest for thine own use and benefit, much more will the same God give a
body to The Seed, which He Himself does sow, much more will he quicken it,
after it has been dead; seeing the End, why he sowes it, is not thy temporal
benefit or commodity, but His Own immortal glory.

When God did enact that severe Law, from which death natural takes its
original, Dust thou art, and to dust thou shall return; the Intent or purport
of that Law was not, that man by returning to dust should utterly or finally
perish, and be for ever as if he never had been: What then was the intent or
purport of this Law? That man's body should be committed unto the earth, as seed
is committed to the ground; that as the corn, which springs out of the earth,
returns to earth again, and is still raised up with advantage and increase unto
the Sower: So the bodies of men, after that by the first man's folly they became
corruptible and certain to suffer corruption (whether in the earth in the air,
or in the Sea) might be raised again, but not to corruption; that God may
receive the seed, which is sown, with increase of Glory to himself; this
increase of Glory being rooted in the increase of their happiness, by whose
immortality he is immediately glorified. Thus much of the former difficulty,
to wit, how our Apostles Instance or experiment in the work of nature does
infer his intended Conclusion, to wit, the future Resurrection from the dead.
And from the Solution of this Former, the Second may easily be assoyled.

7. The second Difficulty was; How this Instance or Experiment of the The 2d
Difficulty urged.
Corn dying, and being quickened again, can fit or parallel the Resurrection of
the body, seeing the Corn, which is quickened, or springs up, is not The same
body, which was sown? Whereas it is a Point of our Belief, that the same
numerical bodies which die and return to dust, or are resolved into ashes or
into the Elements, of which they consist, shall be raised up at the last day.
For if The Body raised up were not the self same that died, the Body which
died, should not be parttaker either of pain or joy everlasting, but another
Body should be tormented or glorified instead of the Body which died; Every
man should not receive reward or punishment according to that, which he had
done in the body; or at least this reward or punishment should not be received
in the same Body, in whhic he had done ill or well.

Aquinas, a Great School-man in his time, labors to assoyl the proposed
Difficulty by framing the Apostles Argument Thus. If Nature can repair that
which dies, Idem Specie, that is, If Nature can make it to be of the same
Aquinas his Solution true but impertinent.
Kind it was, though not the same numerical body it was (as he that sows Wheat
reaps Wheat, not Rye or Barley, though not the self same grains of Wheat, which
he sows;) Then The God of nature and Creator of all things shall raise up the
bodies of men, which are his seed and proper husbandry, the very self same
which they were, not the self same for kind or specifical Unity, but the same
Individuals. Of all the bodies, which have died, not one shall miscarry, not so
much as a hair of any man's head, or any least part of his body shall finally
perish.

But though all this be True, yet is it Impertinent, it falls not within the
compass of our Apostles Inference in this place, who neither affirms, nor
denies, nor took it so much as into his consideration, whether the Corn which
springs The Authors Solution of the former Difficulty.
up, be the same Individual Nature or substance, which did putrify and die in
the ground. The utmost Circumference of his considerations or thoughts extends
no further then thus; That the Body which God does give to every seed, is not
for quality the same, which was sown; for it was sown Bare Corn without blade,
husk, or ear, and loses that corpulencie or quantity, which it had: But it
springs not up bare Corn. The new life, which it gets in the womb of the earth,
is clothed with a fresh body capable of nourishment and growth; of both which
it was incapable whilst it was severed from the ear wherein it grew, or after
the stalk was cut down. And This Change or alteration in the Corn sown and
springing up does well fit the Change or alteration, which shall be wrought in
our Bodies at the Resurrection, or last day. Our bodies by death become more
incapable of nourishment then the corn severed from the ear or cut down; for
they are utterly deprived of life, of sense, of motion, in all the Interim
between the day of their dissolution and the last day. By the Resurrection they
shall not only recover life, sense and motion, but the life which they get
shall be endowed with Immortality; the bodies shall be clothed with Glory.

This change of our mortal bodies into immortal is much greater, then the most
plentiful increase, which any seed does yield. One seed or grain may in some
soils bring forth thirty, in others sixty, in others a hundred; but
immortality added to the life of the body is an increase in respect of this
mortal life, which now we lead, inexpressible by any number. The life of
Methuselah is not comparable to it, albeit the years which he lived on earth,
were multiplied by the days contained in them, and both multiplied again by
all the minutes and scruples contained in the days and years which he lived.
And yet after this increase of life our bodies shall be the same they were, for
nature and essence, but not the same for qualities or capacities, whether of
joys or pains. In these respects they shall differ far more, then any corn
growing does from the seed, from which it springs. And this difference of
qualities, between the bodies which die, and shall be raised again, was all
that our Apostle sought or intended to illustrate or set forth by that
similitude which he uses. Thou sowest not the corn which shall be; that is,
not the same corn for quantity, for quality, for vigor of life; nor shall
men's bodies be raised again to such a life only, as they formerly had, or to
such a corruptible estate as that, wherein death did apprehend them, but to a
life truly immortal.

8. The second question proposed, by the Corinthian Naturalist, was, with The
Corinthian Naturalists second Question
what bodies shall the dead come forth or appear? And the direct Answer to this
Question is included in the former similitude; (so much insisted on before, as
that it needs not to be repeated here:) the Effect of it is This; That they
shall come forth with bodies much more excellent then those, with which they
descended The answer to this Question.
into the grave.

And of this general Answer, included in the similitude of the Corn, or Seed
sown, all the Exemplifications following unto verse 45. are native Branches.

39. All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men,
another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.

40. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; but the glory of
the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.

41. There is one glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, and another glory of
the Stars; for one Star differs from another in glory.

42. So also is the resurrection of the dead; it is sown in corruption, it is
raised in incorruption:

43. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it
is raised in power.

44. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a
natural body, and there is a spiritual body, etc.

Thus much of the Positive Force of our Apostles Argument drawn from the
similitude of the Corn, which by the Law of Nature must die before it be
quickened and receive increase.

9. But of this similitude it is no native branch or part, whether the corn
which dies being sown, do rise again the next year for vital substance or life,
the same, which it was whilst it was contained in the blade or ear, the year
before; certainly it is not the same for Corpulencie, for matter or quantity.
But whether the seeds of life or spirit of corn do not remain the same by
continuation, though in diverse bodies or matter, our Apostle disputes not, nor
do I dispute. This is a curiosity, which cannot be determined in the Pulpit
without appeal unto the Schools. The vital spirit or essence of the Corn may be
so far the same in the corn which is sown, and which is reaped, that, if we
should for disputation sake, suppose or imagine, what some have dogmatically
affirmed, to wit, That the corn sown were endowed with sense or feeling, were
capable of pleasure or pain; the pleasure, which it formerly enjoyed might be
renewed, increased, or multiplied with increase or multiplication of its bodily
substance; so might the pain, which it had felt before it was sown, be renewed
and increased after it were quickened again, if any sort of corn were appointed,
as some men are, to torture and punishment. Now albeit we must believe, that
men's bodies after the Resurrection shall be the very same for substance which
they were before death, yet are we not bound to believe that they shall be any
further the same, then that every man which died in his sins, may in his body
feel an infinite increase of those miseries, which he had deserved; and in some
sort felt whilst he lived on earth. Or, that every man at the last day may reap
an infinite increase of those joys and comforts, of which in this life he had
some tastes or pledges whilst he sowed unto the spirit. For, as the Apostle
elsewhere speaks, he that sows unto the flesh, shall of the flesh reap
corruption; a full crop of all the miseries incident to mortality, but
miseries more then mortal, miseries everlasting and never dying. And he that in
this life sows unto the spirit, shall at the Resurrection, of the spirit reap
life, but a life immortal without end, without annoyance or interruption of joy.

Again, they extend the former similitude too far, which from it would gather,
that as there is a natural force or previal disposition in the corn sown, by
which, as by a secondary cause or instrumental mean, it is quickened and
increased; So there be natural seeds of life in the putrified relics of men's
bodies, or remnants of the matter dissolved, out of which life immortal shall
so spring, as the blade does out of the seed which is sown, only by the
sustentative or operative power of God, by which all things are supported, or
enabled to produce their natural effects. For although it be true, that the
works which we ascribe to nature, are wrought by God, or by continuation of the
same power, by which they were first created and set a working; yet the
Resurrection of men's bodies shall not be wrought by the mere continuation of
This Power; There must be more then a conservation of their matter, more then
an usual cooperation with the Elements, out of which they are raised, there
must be even a new creation of their bodies; yet not a Creation of them out of
nothing, but out of the scattered fragments of their matter; such a creation as
the works of the fifth and sixth day were, when God commanded the sea or water
to bring forth fishes in their kind, and the earth to bring forth trees or
plants in their kind. These were not effects of See Book. 10. Fol. 3113.
nature, or of that power only, by which the Sea and earth were from the first
day preserved; but here was a new creation out of that, which Philosophers
properly term The matter; that is, the common mother of generation or
corruption. And thus God at the last day shall command not the earth only, but
the Sea also with the other Elements to give up their dead. Rev. 20. 13.
Lastly, they extended this similitude too far, which hence imagined, that as
the corn often dies and is often quickened, and dies again; So, by the doctrine
of Christians, there should be a death after the Resurrection, and a
Resurrection after death, or such a continual vicissitude between life and
death, as is between light and darkness.

This objection is punctually resolved by Tertullian in the 48. Chapt. of his
Apology. The sum of his answer is; That so it might be, if the Omnipotent
Creator had so appointed; for he is able to work this continual interchange, or
vicissitude of life and death, as well in men's bodies, as in the bodies of corn
sown or reaped; or as he does the perpetual vicissitude of light and darkness
in the two Hemispheres of the world; but he has revealed his Will to the
contrary. And the reason is not the same (but rather contrary) in Gods crop or
harvest, as it is in the crops or harvests of mortal men: As men in this life
are mortal, so is their food or nutriment; and for this reason, their nutriment
must be supplied by continual sowing and reaping. But God is immortal, and so
shall the crop of his harvest be. Our Resurrection from the dead is his general
crop or harvest; and this needs to be no more then One; because our bodies,
being once raised up to life again, shall never die; but enjoy immortality in
his presence. Heaven is his Granary, and what is gathered into it cannot perish
or consume.

10. The general use of this Doctrine is punctually made to our hands by The
general use of this Doctrine.
our Apostle in the last verse of this Chapt. Therefore my beloved brethren, be
ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much
as you know, that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. And more particulary,
1 Thessal. 4. 13. etc. I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them
which are a sleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope, etc.
The Apostle there does not forbid all mourning for the dead, but the manner of
mourning only; that they mourn not as they which have no hope, no expectation
of any Resurrection after death. Nature will teach us, as it did these
Thessalonians, to mourn for the death of our friends and kindred. And our
belief of this Article will give us the true mean, and prescribe the due manner
or measure of mourning: Our sorrow, though natural and just, yet if it be truly
Christian and seasoned with Grace, will still be mingled with comfort and
supported by hope. To be either impatient toward God, or immoderatly dejected
for the death of our dearest friends, whose bodies God has in mercy committed
to the custody of the earth, of the sea, or other Elements; is but A Symptom
of heathenish ignorance (or infidelity) of this Article, A Barbarism in
Christianity.

If we of this Land should live amongst Barbarians, whom we had taught to make
bread of Corn, and accustomed to the taste of this bread as unknown to their
forefathers, as Manna at first appearance was to the Israelites, but not
acquainted them with the mystery of sowing and reaping; they would be as ready
in their hunger or scarcity of bread to stone us, as the Israelites were to
stone Moses in their thirst, if they should see us offer to bury that corn in
the earth, with which their bowels might be comforted: yet if they were but so
far capable of reason as to be persuaded, or we so capable of trust or credit
with them as to persuade them, that there were no possibility left either to
have bread without supply of corn, or for corn to increase and multiply, unless
it did first die and putrify in the ground; hope of a more plentiful crop or
harvest would naturally incline them to brook the present scarcity with
patience, and to be thankful toward such, as would so carefully provide for
them.

Now, besides, that the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God; the
committing of their bodies to the grave is but as a solemn preparation of seed
for a future crop or harvest. If in these premises we do rely and trust in
God, our sorrow and heaviness for the dead, though it may endure for a while,
will be swallowed up in comfort; our mournful tears and weeping will be still
accompanied with praises and thanksgiving unto him, that has so well provided
for them that live in his fear, and die in his favor.

11. But as this Doctrine administreth plenty of comfort in respect of friends
deceased; so it should move us to make choice of such only for our dearest
friends, as we see inclined to live in the fear of the Lord. Or, if we have
prevented our selves and this advice, in making such choice, yet let us
never be prevented by others for making the main and principal end of our
Christians should choose such friends as have share in the First, and hopes of
the second Resurrection.
friendship or delight in any man's company to be this; A serious study and
endeavor to prepare others, and to be prepared by them, to live and die in the
Lord. As there is no greater comfort in this life, then a faithful and hearty
friend; So can no greater grief befall a man at the hour of death, then to have
had a friend trusty and hearty in other offices and services, but negligent and
backward in cherishing the seeds of faith, of love, or fear of the Lord, or
other provision of our way-fare toward the life to come. No practice of the
most malicious, or most inveterate, or most provoked foe, can breed half so
much danger to any man, as the affectionate intentions of a carnal friend,
always officious to entertain him with pleasant impertinences, which will draw
his mind from the fear and love of God, and either divert or effeminat his
cogitations from resolute pitching upon the means and hopes of a joyful
Resurrection to everlasting life.

Even to minds and affections already sweetened with sure hope of that life to
come, what grief must it needs breed in this life, if he be a loving husband,
to think he shall be by death eternally divorced from the company of his
dearest consort? Or, if he be an affectionate friend, to consider that the
league of mutual amity in this life (never interrupted, but secured from
danger of impairment whilst their pilgramage lasts here on earth) should be
everlastingly dissolved after the one has taken up his lodging in the dust?
that all former dearest kindness should not only be forgotten, but be further
estranged from performance of any common courtesy, then any Christian in this
life can be in regard of any Jew, or Turk, or any Jew or Turk from them? For
what Jew or Turk is there, that would not be ready to relieve a Christian with
some off-fals from his Table, whom he sees ready to pull the flesh off his own
arms to satiate hunger? yet this is more then the most loving Husband may do
unto his dearest Wife; then a Father may wish to his Son; or any Friend that
dies in the Lord, may do unto another after death, unless they both repair to
one Home, and be not divided by that Gulf, which was set between Dives and
Lazarus.

You know the Story; how that Lazarus was not permitted to minister so much as
a drop of water unto Dives to cool his tongue. Nor shall the Father, which dies
in the Lord, be permitted to do or wish so great a kindness unto the Son; nor
the Husband to the Wife, which live and die in their sins. What remedy then
can be prescribed for preventing the just occasions of this grief? but that
Husband and Wife, Father and Son, Mother and Daughter, and others linkt in any
bend of love and friendship, do mutually labor to wain each others Affections
from earth and earthly things, and each lend other their helping hand to fasten
their affections on things that are above where Christ sits at the right
hand of God.

CHAP. XV. The Objections of the Atheist, and the Exceptions of the Naturalist,
Both, put fully Home, and as fully Answered. The falsitie of the Supposals and
Paradoxes (rather then Principles) of the Atheist, discovered; and made even
Palpable by ocular demonstration, and by Instances in bodies vegetant and
sensitive. A Scruple that might trouble some Pious mind, after all this,
satisfied. A short Application of the Doctrine contained in the whole Chapter.
1. BUt here the Atheist will except, That the former Reasons are Concludent
only in Case the whole substance or bodily part of man be annihilated. The
Atheist's Exception.
That indeed, which is annihilated, is as if it had never been, and is as
capable of Creation as it was at the first, or at the time when it was Nothing;
For Creation makes that to be which is not; and that is most properly said to
be created, which is made of nothing or without any matter or stuff
pre-existent. But thus it is not in the Bodies of men that are dead; these are
not annihilated or resolved into nothing: the matter of them still remains,
though not in the same Place or shape, but some part of it in This Body, some
part in That.

Of a man's Body which died twenty years ago, some part is changed or
transformed into the nature of earth, some part resolved into vapors or
Exhalations; Some part into grosser moisture, whereof other live creatures are
produced: No part of it returns into mere Nothing. Whatsoever bodily substance
has been by God created out of Nothing, has all its relics one where or
other still remaining; And the very least Fragment of the meanest of them is a
great deal more then Nothing.

And here the subtle Naturalist coming in, demands, What possibility can be
conceived, that the self same Bodies, which were consumed a thousand years The
Naturalist his Demand.
ago, should be entirely restored again?

This supposed Restoration must either be by a New Creation; or it must be
only by a Recollection or gathering together of the relics or matter, which
have been dispersed and scattered through diverse places, and transformed into
so many several bodies.

2. That the bodies, which have been dissolved, should at the last day be made
the self same they were by a new Creation, (properly so called) seems
impossible. For every body must have its proper and immediate Matter, and no
body can be created without the Creation of such a Matter. The soul of man may
be created in the Body without creation of the Matter whereto it is annexed,
because the soul is no material substance; But the creation of a bodily or
material substance essentially includes a Creation of the Matter, and this
Matter may be either created before The Compound, into which it is afterward
formed; (as the Body and Matter of the First Man was created out of the earth,
before it was wrought by the breath of God into a living or sensitive
substance:) or this Matter may be concreated with the body or Compound, whose
matter it is.

Thus the Fishes in the Sea, and the Plants in the Earth were each of them See
Book 10. Fol. 3113.
created by one entire Creation; there was not one creation of their proper
Matter, and another of their proper Form. The bulks or stems of trees were not
made or created out of the earth before the vegetable or vital faculty was
infused into them; Both were made at once.

The several branches of the Difficulty in this Argument may be framed thus: If
the bodies of men, which have been resolved into dust (perhaps into as many
several bodies, as there be men now living) must all be created again; The
Naturalist's Objections framed into a Body.
and every one created again the self same it was; Then either the matter must
be the self same, which it was; or else it must have some new matter
equivalent, or of the self same use or service in respect of the soul, unto
which the former matter had been, and this new matter (not altogether the same
but the same by Equivalencie) is, or is to be, united.

That the self same matter which was in a man's body when he died, should become
the same again by a new creation ex nihilo, implies a Contradiction; For that
very material substance, which was in Adam at his death, is not to this day
annihilated; not the least scrap or fragment of it, but is now existent in some
body or other. And that, which at this very hour actually is or existeth in
some other body, cannot at this very hour begin to Be, cannot at this very hour
be made of nothing, because it self already is something. If the matter of
Adams body (which we suppose not to be utterly annihilated) could be created
again whiles it so continues, it should be existent, and not existent, it
should begin to be, and not begin to be, at the same point of time. Both which
imply a manifest Contradiction; and all Contradictions, though See Chap. 13..
11.
in matters merely speculative, are as contrary to the Unity and truth of the
Godhead, as dissimulation, fraud or cozenage are to the Holiness of God. To
make both parts of a Contradiction true, falls not under the Object or exercise
of His Almighty Power.

If then the Body of Adam cannot be created the same it was, unless the self
same matter, whereof his body was first made, be restored; it is clear It is
the very nature of the Matter not to be unum and idem.
that the self same matter cannot be entirely restored by Creation, unless
those bodies wherein it is, be first annihilated or turned into nothing: For
whilst they remain something, or rather, whilst the matter which was in Adam
remains in them, the same matter being something in them, cannot properly be
Created again, or begin to Be out of Nothing.

3. But, that the Body of Adam should be at the last day the same it was when
he died, by Recollecting or putting together the self same material parts The
Answer to the Naturalist his Objections.
whereof his soul was possessed at her departure from the body, is not
impossible. That the bodies of all men should at the Resurrection become the
same they were, by this means, not by Creation of new bodies, or by new
creation of any bodily substance or new matter out of nothing, the Heathens (it
seems) did conceive to be the Opinion of the ancient Christians, when the
Gospel of Christ (concerning the Resurrection of the body) begun to be pressed
and preached among them. For to disprove Christians Belief of this Article, or
at least to defeat Christians of their hopes of a bodily Resurrection to a
better life, their heathen persecutors, did burn their bodies unto ashes, and
afterward sow their ashes, some in the waters, See the Epistle of the Churches
of Vienna and Lions to the Brethren of Asia and Phrygia, in Eusebius. Hist. 5.
book 1. chap. ad finem.
some in the air, or expose them to the blasts of boisterous winds; hoping by
these practices to find the God of these Christians a cumbersome work, before
he could accomplish what they professed he had promised unto them concerning the
Resurrection of the same bodies, and of rendering to every soul the same
material portions, whereof it was sometimes seized. But whether the malicious
heathens did punctually oppose these practices unto the assertions of the
Christians, as if from their mouths they had heard that the Resurrection of the
body should be accomplished by Recollection of all the particles, into which it
had been resolved (through what Elements soever they had been in long tract of
time dispersed;) or whether these Heathens did thus practice upon the
Christians bodies out of their own imaginations, as not conceiving any other
means possible, by which every man might arise with his own body, I find not
upon Record.

Some of the Ancient Fathers in their Arguments against the Heathen, or in
their Apologies for This Article of our Faith, suppose the Resurrection of the
body shall be accomplished by the Recollection of the Relics or Fragments,
into which each ones body has been dissolved. And to this purpose There is
much good morality to be learned from the contemplating the mixtures and
separation of metals.
use diverse Similitudes or illustrations drawn from Goldsmiths, or Refiners of
Metals, who by their Art or Mystery can extract the fragments of Gold or
Silver out of any other metal or body, with which they are mingled. Howbeit
other of the Fathers, and sometimes the same Fathers, which use these
Similitudes or illustrations, principally rely upon Gods Creative Power, by
which he made all things out of Nothing, or by which he multiplieth or
advances things, that have some actual Being, unto a more excellent and more
plentiful kind of Being.

It was an exercise of the Creative Power to turn Water (in an Instant) into
Wine; to multiply five loaves and two fishes unto the sustentation of more then
five thousand men, besides the fragments remaining, which were ten times more
then the provision it self. And in thus resolving the possibility of every man's
Rising with his own Body, into the Power of God, whereby he is able either to
make all things out of nothing, or to make one thing out of another by means
miraculous and far surmounting all force of natural Agents, the ancient Fathers
did wisely. For admitting (what no Christian can deny) that Gods Skill or
knowledge to recollect all the several parcels of every man's body (which way
soever dispersed) does infinitely exceed the most exquisite Skill of any
Mineralist or Refiner in severing one metal from another, and in wedding and
uniting every parcel, fragment, or remnant, of what kind soever, with others of
it own kind: Yet this Infinite Skill or knowledge in Recollecting or uniting
the several parts of men's bodies, which have been dissolved by death, could not
suffice to the supportance of that truth, which in this Article we all believe,
against the assaults of the Atheists; unless this infinite Skill or knowledge
were seconded with an infinite Creative Power.

4. Against the Recollection of all the Relics or fragments of men's bodies,
the Atheist or subtle Naturalist would thus Object. All Christians do The
Atheists wily (but not wise) Objection against the possibility of a
Resurrection by Recollection of Relics.
not die a natural death, all come not to the Sepulchers of their Fathers, many
perish in the Sea, and the bodies of many, which thus perish, are quite
devoured by fishes, Sea Monsters, or other inhabitants of the Sea; and the
fishes which thus devour even Christian men, are again devoured by other men,
and those men again, which have sed on fishes which devoured men, become a prey
unto other fishes, and these fishes are taken again and eaten by men: The men,
that eat these fishes, may (says He, and we may suppose they do) become a prey
unto the Canibals, a barbarous and monstrous people, which feed as greedily
upon man's flesh, as any Sea Monster or ravenous land Creature would feed on
theirs. Now the matter or bodily substance of every man that is devoured by
fishes or other inhabitants of the Sea, is turned into the matter or bodily
substance of the devourer. The matter again of every fish, that is eaten by
man, is converted or changed into the matter or substance of that man which
eats it. The Canibal would not so greedily feed upon man's flesh as he does,
unless he were truly nourished by it; and nourishment is the conversion of the
matter or substance eaten into the matter or substance of him that eats it.

Now if the Resurrection of every man with his own body, with the same body,
from which his soul was by death divorced, did only, or principally consist in
the Recollection or reunion of the same material parts or relics which were
dissolved by death, it would be a hard point to resolve or satisfy the Atheist
or incredulous Naturalist, how it were possible that every man should have the
self same Body that he had at the hour of death.

To twist the difficulty harder, according to the Atheists suppositions (which
are not impossible, nor in ordinary conjecture improbable.) The same Objection
reinforced.


From what creature shall the first man's body, which the fish devoured be
challenged? Or what creature shall the Almighty enjoin to make restitution of
his entire matter? Shall the Almighty enjoin the fishes of the Sea to cast up
the morsels of man's flesh, which they have eaten, as the Whale did Jonas? But
it is supposed, that the bodily substance or matter of the man, was converted
into the substance or bodies of the fishes, which did eat him; for God did not
preserve either the life or bodily matter of men devoured by fishes, as he did
preserve Jonas. Shall the man's body then be repaired out of the matter or
bodily substance of the fishes, which did eat him? But that (as the Atheists
suppose, and is not in it self improbable) other men have eaten and turned it
into the matter and substance of their bodies. And these men again have been
eaten by other fishes, or by such Land-monsters as the Canibals. Shall the
first then or second men's bodies be repaired out of the bodily substance or
matter of these later men, which have eaten the fishes that eat the former, or
out of the bodies of Canibals, which have eaten them?

The Question then remains; How the bodies of those men shall be repaired? or
from what Elements shall the Relics or dissolved fragments of their bodies be
recollected? Seeing their bodies also have been either immediately devoured by
Canibals, or mediately by other men, which have eaten the creatures, that have
devoured the former men? The Canibals, which devoured men must, by this Article
of Christian Faith, arise again with their own bodies, not with the bodies of
other men whom they have devoured; how then is it possible for every man to
arise with his own body, seeing the bodies of many men, at least the relics
or fragments into which they are dissolved, have been swallowed up by some one
ravenous creature, and some one Canibals humane body may successively be the
Tomb or Sepulcher of many men's bodies?

And here me thinks that question, which the Sadduces put unto our Savior
concerning the woman which had been married to seven brethren, one after
another, might be more punctually proposed concerning the women of Samaria or
Jerusalem, which in the extremity of seige did make their hunger-starved
stomachs the grave or Sarcophagus of those tender Infants, whom they had lately
conceived in their womb, and brought forth with joy.

The Question by the Sadduces was thus proposed, Which of the seven brethren
should have the woman to wife at the Resurrection, seeing she had been wife
successively to all the seven?

The Atheist or Naturalist would propose his Question thus; Whose shall the
bodies of the Infants (which their mothers devoured) at the day of the
resurrection be? shall they belong as appurtenances to the bodies of their
mothers, of which they were (though most unnaturally) made natural or material
and substantial parts a little before these cruel mothers died? But then the
Infants should have no bodily substance, they could not arise with their own
bodies. Or shall the relics of the bodies, which their mothers swallowed, be
drawn or extracted (as a refiner does gold out of dross, or silver out of baser
metal) out of the ruins of their mothers bodies? but so their mothers should
seem at the resurrection to want part of their bodily and much pined
substances, which they had at the separation of their souls and bodies: Their
bodies, by this supposition, cannot be the same they were when they dyed.

5. This Difficulty might by many like Instances be both increased and
enlarged; but the same Answer, which our Savior gave unto the Sadduces, Matthew.
22. 29. will sufficiently satisfy the Atheists Objection, though not the
Atheist himself. He therefore errs, because he knows not the Scriptures, nor
the Power of God. We may further add; In these Collections he therefore errs,
because he knows not the Passive obediential Power or capacity of nature, as
subject and obedient to the Active or all-working Power of God. The Atheists
Objection answered: It has Two Loops.


How cunningly soever the aforesaid or the like knot may be cast by the
Naturalist, it has Two Loops, by which it may easily be loosed, by which it
does in a manner unloose or untie itself.

First, The Atheist takes that as granted, which he can never prove nor make
probable out of the course of Nature; to wit, that when one living creature
devours another, as when fishes devour men, or men feed on fishes, or when one
man eats another, the whole Matter or bodily substance of the creature devoured
should be converted into the matter or bodily substance of the First Loop.
cater or devourer. This never falls out in the whole course of nature. Of the
most nourishing live creature that is, some part or fragment is not fit for
nutriment; Not the greediest fish that is can so entirely devour a man, but
some part of his bodily substance will dissolve into the water, air, or some
other Element or mixed bodies; so will some part of the fishes or live creatures
which men eat always dissolve into some other bodily substance, besides the
substance of the man which eats them. So that notwithstanding all the former
supposed transmutations, or all that can be in like case supposed, some part of
every man's body still remains; not converted into the substance of any other
bodies, but into the air, earth, or water: And our of these relics and
remainders, every man's body may be raised again, and raised again the self same
it was, but in a condition much advanced and improved for the Better. As a
great tree grows out of a small and slender root by the Creators Power, by that
Power, which made the earth to bring forth trees most perfect in their kind in
an instant; So the least fragment of man's body, which remains either in the
earth, in the water, or in other Elements, may in a moment grow into an entire
or perfect body. And this manner of the Resurrection of one and the same body,
not by an entire Recollection or gathering together of all the materal parts
whereof the same body did sometimes consist; but by the Improvement or
Multiplication of some one or few principal portions of the body which has
been, seems most agreeably to our Apostles Inference in this place, of which
hereafter.

6. Secondly; All the Objections of the Atheist or Naturalist against this
Article are grounded upon another supposition taken by them as granted, which
The Second Loop of the Atheists Objection.
notwithstanding in true Philosophy is apparently false. And their false Ground
or Supposition is this; That unto the Identity or Unity of the same vegetable
or sensitive body (be it the body of a man, of a beast, or of a tree) the Unity
or Identity of the same material parts is necessarily required.

The grossness of this Paradox or false supposition will appear from the very
explication of the Terms. The demonstration of its falsehood may be made An
Ocular Demonstration that the Atheists principles or supposals be False.
ocular and palpable out of any vegetable or live body, wherein the Atheist or
Naturalist can make Instance; but most apparently in the Oak, which is the
longest a dying of any tree; in the Heart or Raven, which are the longest lived
amongst the beasts of the field or fowls of the air. An Oak, albeit it stand
four hundred years, or unto whatsoever height or greatness in that time it
grows, is still the same tree or vegetable body, which it was at the first
plantation: yet the Material Parts of it, cannot be altogether, or for the most
part, the same that they were. The whole Matter or bodily substance of it, when
it was first set, was not the thousandth part of that bodily substance, which
after three hundred years growth, it has; And of the matter, which it had,
when it was but a yard high, it is not imaginable that any one part, so much as
a pins head, should be remaining the same it was, after it come to be twenty
yards in height and a yard in thickness. It could not grow in height or
breadth, unless some parts of the matter, which it first had, did daily exhale
or evaporate, and new matter come into their places.

Augmentation and growth, in vegetables, necessarily supposes nutrition; and
nutrition includes a daily decay of nutriment gotten, or of the matter whereof
the body consists, and a new supply or reparation of the matter or substance
lost or wasted by preparation of some new nutriment.

A Raven likewise is the self same Fowl when it is ready to die for age, that
it was, when it was first hatched; but the matter of it cannot possibly be the
self same; it is not conceivable that so much as an inch of the same matter,
which it had when it was first hatched, should continue in it, the same till
death. For its natural heat does perpetually consume or wast some part of its
matter or substance; and its blood, without perpetual nourishment by new food
or matter prepared, would be dried up by its natural heat; For life consists in
calido et humido, in heat and moisture, and cannot be continued in any live
creature without continual nutriment, more then the fire or flame can be
preserved without fuel. Nor could the life, or natural heat, wherein life
specially consists, stand in such perpetual need of nutrition or new matter
whereon to feed, unless there were a continual dissolution of some material
parts, which vanish or expire out of the body, though not so visibly, yet as
certainly, as fume or smoke does out of the fuel, wherewith the fire or flame
is fed. Unless there were some precedent diminution or wasting of the material
parts in man's body, there could be no proper growth or augmentation of the
whole body, or of every part; For if every least particle did remain the same
it was, as well for quantity as for quality, the whole body could not be
augmented in every part, but it must be as great again as it was before, after
every such growth or Augmentation. For there can be no Augmentation or growth
in any part otherwise then by addition of some sensible nutriment: Now if every
least part be augmented by addition of some new or sensible matter or
substance, the addition, which is made unto every least part, would be as great
as the part, to which it is added: For it is supposed that every least part is
augmented, and augmented it cannot be, but by addition of some other sensible
body, which cannot be less, then the least part sensible of a body; or of a
sensible body.

7. But if we grant, as the truth is, that the material parts of the body
augmented remain not the self same to day, which they were yesterday or a week
ago, but are still fluent and wasting, other material parts coming into their
place with some addition of quantity, so as the addition in bodies growing by
daily nutriment be still greater, then the wast or diminution, The manner of
natural growth or augmentation may be easily conceived. And it was a truth of
nature excellently expressed by the great Philosopher; Aucto toto augetur
quaelibet pars etiam minutissima: Whenever the whole body is augmented, every
least part is augmented. As if the whole body in the space of a year be
augmented by the quantity of a palm or a span, the thousandth part of the body
must be augmented by the thousandth part of a palm or span. But thus the whole
body (as the same Philosopher observes) is in every part augmented non quoad
formam sed quoad materiam. And his reason is qua materia est in perpetuo fluxu;
because the material parts of man's body are perpetually fluent, always
decaying and always repaired. It is a maxim again of the same Philosopher,
that, Auctum manet idem numero, that every vegetable body being augmented (how
long soever the growth or augmentation lasts) is numerically the same it was.

The case then is clear out of the Book of Nature, (by which the Atheist or
infidel will only be tried) That, the body or bodily life of man, how long
soever he live, remains one and the same from his birth unto his death, albeit
the matter of which his body is composed, and wherein his life is seated, do
not remain the same. As the face or image of the Sun remains the same in a
water or river, albeit the parts of the water, in which it is imprinted, do not
continue the same, but as one portion of water slideth away, another comes in
its place, altogether as apt to take the impression or picture of the Sun as
the former; Or as the light continues one and the same in a lamp, albeit the
oil, which preserves its light, do continually wast; For one drop or portion of
the same oil, or of new oil poured in, is as apt to continue the light, as the
former drops were, which are wasted. The light then remains the self same,
albeit the oil continually wast: So that unto numerical Identitie of the same
light, the numerical unity or Identitie or the same portion of oil is not
required, cannot possibly be had. It suffices that the oil or matter, which
feeds the lamp, be the same by Equivalencie. By these and many like
unquestionable instances in nature the Atheists or infidels supposition is
altogether false, to wit, That, unto the Resurrection of the same body, or unto
the restoration of the same bodily life, the Identitie of matter, or of
material parts, which it formerly had, is necessarily required. I add, that,
This Identitie or unity of matter is less needful unto the numerical unity
or Identitie of man's body, because the soul of man, amongst all other
vegetables, is only immortal, and remains the same it was after it be severed
from the body.

8. Taking then the first supposition of the Atheists as True; Suppose the
bodily matter of some men to have been altogether or entirely transubstantiatea
or changed into the bodily substance of some other men, and that two or three
of such men might have the whole bodily substance of some other man, or child,
in their bodies when they died: it is no probable Argument or forcible
Objection, to say, This man, or child, whose bodily substance is supposed to be
converted into the substance of other men, cannot arise again with the same
body, which he had, because he cannot have the same matter which he had, unless
the other lose some part of the matter, which they had in them when they died.
Suppose the material parts of every man were utterly annihilated when they
died, yet their bodies may be made the self same again, which they were, not
only by Creation of new matter out of nothing, but out of any matter or
Elements prae-existent, so prepared and proportioned to their individual nature
or bodily life, as the former was. For, the numerical unity or individual
entitie of every nature consists in the unity or proportioned correspondencie
to that model, whereto the Almighty Creator did frame it.

To conclude then; seeing the Resurrection of the same bodies wherein we die,
must be wrought by the Power of God, it is fitting that we refer the particular
manner, how our bodies shall be entirely restored, unto God himself. We will
not dispute whether the Resurrection of every man in his own body shall be
wrought, de facto, by recollecting of the dust, into which men are turned; or
of the same material parts which every man had when he died; or whether it
shall be wrought by Creation of some new matter, or only by preparing some
other Elementary matter prae-existent, and working it into the same individual
temper or constitution, into which our bodily food or nutriment was wrought,
whilst we lived. It suffices to have showed, that every man may arise with his
own body by any of the former ways; or partly by one, partly by another.

Lastly, the Recollection of the same material fragments or relics, into
which our bodies are dissolved, is no more necessary by the Principles of
nature or true Philosophy unto the constitution of the same bodies (at the day
of the Resurrection) which before have been, then the recollection or regresse
of the same matter or nutriment, whereof our blood or flesh was made, or by
which our life was preserved in childhood, is unto the continuance or
constitution of the same life, flesh, or blood in old age. The life of every
man in old age is the same, the body the same, the flesh the same, the blood
the same, which it was it childhood; albeit the blood or greatest part of our
bodies in childhood was made of one kind of nutriment, and the blood, which we
have in mature or old age be made of another, much different nutriment. Yea
albeit we alter our food or diet every year, yet our bodies remain still the
same, every finger the same, whilst it continues in the body, and whilst this
bodily life continues. For albeit the nutriment be of diverse kinds, yet nature
or the digestive faculty works all into one temper, and this temper continues
the same in diverse portions of the matter which is continually fluent, and the
same only by Equivalencie.

Now, if nature by Gods appointment and cooperation can work diverse kinds of
food or nutriment into the same form or constitution, it will be no improbable
supposall to say, that, The God of nature can work any part of the Element of
water, of air, or of earth, any fragment or relic of Adams body into the
same individual form or mould, wherein the bodily life of the man, that shall
be last dead before Christ's coming to Judgment, did consist. Yet will it be no
hard thing for God to make Adam the self same body, wherein he died, out of the
relics of this man's body.

To work this mutual exchange between the material parts of several men's bodies
without any hinderance or impeachment to the numerical Identity of any man's
body; or without any prejudice to this truth, [That every man shall arise with
his own body] which, we Christians believe, is impossible to nature, or to any
natural causes; they can be no Agents in this work: yet it is no ways
impossible (for it implies no contradiction) for nature thus to be wrought and
fashioned by the Creator and preserver of mankind. In avouching thus much, we
say no more then some (I take it) mere Philosophers have delivered in other
Terms. Quicquid potest prima causa per secundam, idem potest per se sola.
Whatsoever the first cause does by the instrumental Agencie or service of
second causes, the same he may do by his sole Power, without the service, of
any instrumental or second cause. Now God, by the heart, by the Liver and by
the digestive faculty, as by causes instrumental or secondary, does change the
substance of herbs, of fruits, of fish, of roots into the very substance of
man's body, without dissolving the unity of his bodily life; and therefore, if
it please him, may change the material parts of one man into another man's body
or substance, without the help or instrumental service of the nutritive or
digestive faculty, or any other instrumental cause; All this he may do
immediately by His sole Power; But whether it be His Will so to do or no at the
last day, be it ever reserved with all reverence and submission to his infinite
wisdom alone.

9. One scruple more there is, wherewith ingenuous minds and well affected The
scruple incident into an ingenuous mind.
may be sometimes touched. The doubt may be framed, Thus. Although it be most
true and evident from the Book of nature, that the natural or digestive faculty
of man does preserve the unity of bodily life entire by diversity of matter or
nutriment, yet the living body so preserved is one and the same by continuation
of existence or duration. His days, whilst natural life continues, are not cut
off by death, he does not for a moment cease to be what he was: But when we
speak of Resurrection from death, when we say the dead shall arise with their
own bodies, here is a manifest interruption of bodily life, or of man's duration
in bodily life. His body cease to be a living body as it was. And therefore
if he must live again in the body, the body to which his soul shall be united
at his Resurrection, may be called his own body, because it shall be inhabited
or possessed with his immortal soul, but how shall it be The same body: which
he formerly had; seeing the existence or duration of him, or of his soul in the
body, is divided by death; and division destroys unity? This leaf or paper
is one, yet if we divide it in the middle, it is no more one but two papers.

The question then comes to this short and perspicuous issue. Whether the
uninterrupted continuance of duration or existence, or unity of time,
wherewith the duration of man's life is measured, be as necessary to the Unity
or Identity of his bodily Nature or Being, as Unity or Continuation of
Quantity is unto the Unity of Bodies divisible or quantitative. The
determination or Judgment is easy. The Book of Nature being Judge, it is
evident; That Unity of Time or continuation of man's life, without
interruption, is but Accidental to the unity of bodily nature or being. It is
a circumstance only, no such part of the Essence or nature, as continuation or
unity of quantity is of the unity of bodies divisible; for time and
quantity are by nature divisible, whereas the nature of man, or other things,
that exist in time, is indivisible. It is true, Division makes a plurality in
things that are by nature divisible, but not in natures indivisible. Every
thing that is divisible, though it be unum actu, yet it is plura in potentia.
In that it may be divided, it is not purely, simply, or altogether one, but may
be made two or more. And whilst it remains one, it is one by conjunction of
parts. The entire substance of any natural body as it is divisible or subject
to dimension, cannot be contained under one part of quantity, but part of it
is contained under one part of quantity, part of it under another: For, Omne
quantum habet partem extra partem, and in that regard is divisible. The whole
substance divisible cannot subsist, but in the whole quantity or measure.

The higher and lower parts of a tree or pillar have no unity betwixt
themselves, but as both are united to the middle parts. If it be divided in the
middle, the union and unity is lost; after the division made it is not one but
two; one division makes its two, two divisions makes it three. But in bodies
sensible or vegetable, considered as parts of the nature or essence of such
Bodies, the case is quite otherwise. A man is the same man, the self same
bodily substance or vegetable this year, which he was three years ago; and his
bodily substance this year is not therefore one and the same with the bodily
substance which he had three years ago, because it is one with the bodily
substance, which he had the last year; but entirely one and the same in all: We
cannot say, that part of his bodily nature was existent in the first year, part
in the second year, and part in the third year, for his whole bodily nature was
entirely in the first year, and in every part or hour of the first year: The
same bodily nature was entirely in every hour of the second year, and so in
every hour of the third year. For though man's body be divisible in quantity;
though his duration be likewise divisible; yet his bodily nature is
indivisible, and entirely the same in every moment of its own duration. And for
this Reason, Although death may make a division or interruption in its duration
or existence; yet it makes no plurality or division in its nature: in what
part of time soever his nature gets new existence, it is entirely and
indivisibly the same it was.

10. The former Instance drawn from the Divisibilitie of a body subject to
quantity or dimension would hold much better Thus. As one part of such a body
being separated from the rest, (suppose a branch or slip of a tree being united
to another tree by inoculation or ingrafting) remains the self same substance
it was, though it now exist not in the same tree, but in another: So the bodily
substance of man, though cut off by death from the company of the living, and
severed from all co-existence with the things which now are, may be the self
same substance which it sometimes was, although it get no co-existence with the
things which now are, but with the substances which shall be many hundred years
hence; it may be at that time the same which formerly it was, as truly and
properly, as if it had continued its co-existence or actual being with the
things which now are, or actually shall be, till it be again. As a slip or
branch taken from a tree in France, and ingrafted in a tree in England, is as
truly and properly the same branch it was, as if it had continued still united
to the same tree, wherein it did first grow. In this later Case there is only A
separation of place, a plurality only of Unitions, or Co-existences of the
same branch with diverse trees, no plurality of branches.

Suppose God had cut off Adams days on earth at the instant wherein he did eat
the forbidden fruit, and deferred his replantation in the Land of the living
again until these times wherein we live; here had been a separation of him from
those times, wherein he lived many hundred of years; here had been a plurality
of times, wherein he lived, a plurality of his Co-existences with diverse
times, and with diverse men, no plurality of humane natures in Adam: His nature
might have been one and the same as truly, and as indivisibly one and the same
in these times distant one from the other by the space of five thousand years,
as if he had lived from his first creation till the sounding of the last trump
unto Judgment. And thus much of the Exceptions or Cavils made by Atheists or
Infidels against This Article of the Resurrection; In which we Christians
believe, That every man shall arise with his own body, the same bodily
substance, which he had or was whilst he lived here on earth.

11. And now for Application or Conclusion; let us here suppose that the
Atheist, as he makes himself worse then a beast whilst he lives on earth, could
hope to make himself equal to beasts in his death, or to be transformed into a
swine. Imagine he should endeavor to drown his immortal soul in a Tavern, or
to bury his bodily natural Essence in the Stews; suppose his body might, by
Venus fire, or other loathsome fruits of filthy lusts, be dissolved into ashes,
and the ashes of it be dispersed through all the winds: Imagine his bones might
in some filthy puddle be resolved into slime, and become the food or nutriment
of crawling toads, or of other more venomous creatures; The pursuit of these
his fearful desperate hopes could nothing avail him, they would be at best but
as pledges of greater shame and misery to befall him; The powerful hand of his
Almighty Judge will raise him up at the last day with the same body, which he
had exposed to all this shame and misery, with the self same body for nature
and substance, but not the same for quality or durabilitie; For it shall after
death be ten thousand times more capable of pain, then in this life it was of
pleasure. All his bodily pleasures came to an end before he came to an end of
his bodily life: These always die before he dies that has wedded himself unto
them. But his pain shall never die, his pains though deadly shall never come
to an end. These are the endless fruits of that man's short days on earth,
which wholly mispends his time in foolish bodily pleasures or noysom lusts. But
for the souls of the Righteous (whatsoever become of their bodies after death)
They are still in the hands of God, they are wholly at his disposal; whether
those Bodies wherein they dwelt do fall by the enemies sword, or come unto
their graves in peace, whether they become a prey unto the beasts of the field,
to the fowls of the Air, or to the fishes of the Sea. And let us, whilst we
live, establish our souls with this Doctrine of our Apostle; And also lay that
saying of Tertullian (recited before, chapter 13.. 9.) unto our hearts;
Consider a teipsum, O homo, and fidem rei invenies; Recogita quid fueris,
antequam esses, utique nihil: Consider thy self, O man, and thou shall find the
undoubted truth of what we teach; recall to mind, if thou can, what thou wast
before thou wast, and thou shall find that thou were nothing. Qui non eras,
factus es; cum iterum non eris, fies. There was a time when thou wast not, and
yet there was a time wherein thou wast made; and albeit the times be now
coming, wherein thou shall not be, yet shall thou be made again. All times are
alike to God; His power to make thee again cannot be restrained by thy weakness
or not Being; it cannot be shortened by any length of time; All of us that now
are, all the Generations that hereafter shall be, must appear before the
Judgment Seat of Christ, that all may receive in the body according to the
things done in the body, whether they be good or bad. For he shall recompense
every man according to all his works; Yea so recompense, That both those which
now deny it, and those that now believe and confess it, shall from experience
then say; Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; Doubtless there is a God
that judges the earth.

The Apostles Method in proving The Resurrection peculiar, and yet artificial.
His way of mutual or reciprocal Inference both Negative and Assertive,
justified; and showed, That both these Inferences, naturally arise, and may
concludently be gathered from the Text, and from the Principles of Christian
Belief. Wherein the witness (false upon supposition, verse 14, and 15.) should
consist. That Philosophical Principle [Deus and natura nihil faciunt frustra]
divinely improved. Gods special and admirable works have ever, A Correspondent;
That is, some extraordinary rare End. How sin is taken away by Christ's death:
How by His Resurrection. How we are justified by Christ's Resurrection. How we
may try our selves, and know, Whether we rightly believe this Article, Of the
Resurrection of the Dead, or No.

1. THat the Resurrection from death to life is in nature possible (as implying
no Contradiction) though unto nature or any natural Agent most impossible, has
been discussed at large before. That there shall, De Facto, be a Resurrection
unto Glory, merely depends upon the Will and Pleasure, or powerful Ordinance
of God; who, as we believe, is able to effect whatsoever His Will or Pleasure
is should be wrought. And our Belief of this Resurrection unto Glory must be
grounded upon His Will and pleasure revealed in Scriptures.

How Gods Will and Pleasure to raise up the Dead in Christ, to an endless,
immortal and most happy Life, has been clearly revealed by his Prophets in The
Old Testament, I have showed other-where: and any one, of ordinary observation
in Reading the Scriptures and Commentators, may Collect. Especially, taking
Example and light, from our blessed Savior his managing that Text, Exodus 3. 6.
[I am the God of Abraham, etc.] in his Argument with the Sadduces, who both
denied the Resurrection, and disputed (as they thought subtly and
irrefragably) against it: And observing the great dexterity of St. Peter in
the second, and of St. Paul in the thirteenth of the Acts, in proving the
Resurrection of Christ out of the Psalms, and out of the Prophet Isaiah: and
how fitly St. Paul in the 54. and 55. verses of this Chapter, makes application
of the Prophecy of Hosea (Chap. 13. v. 14.) unto the proper matter and season
wherein it shall Consummative be fulfilled.

I shall here make such observations as naturally arise from the verses before
recited; and from other verses in that Chapter; wherein, The Apostle uses such
a method or manner of Argument, to prove the Resurrection from the Dead, as
neither Moses nor any Prophet had used before. They indeed foretold and
fore-signified respectively, that Christ should die and rise again: and that
all, which believe in him, should be raised to a life immortal with him. But
the Connection betwixt these two Assertions (which we are bound severally to
believe from the authority of Moses and the Prophets) as, That Christ's
Resurrection from the grave should be the necessary Cause of our Resurrection;
or, That our future Resurrection should necessarily infer Christ's Resurrection
from the dead; or, that the denial or doubt of our Resurrection should infer a
denial or doubt of his Resurrection, is more then can easily be gathered out of
Moses or the Prophets.

This mutual Inference of the ones Resurrection by the other, whether
Negatively or Assertively, was first made by our Apostle in this place, at
least in express Terms, though implicitly made by our Savior before.

Our Apostle in making this mutual Inference, seems in the Judgment of some, to
transgress or violate the Laws of Argumentation generally agreed upon Vide
Glossam and Hugonem in hunc Locum.
in the School of nature, which notwithstanding he elsewhere and usually more
exquisitely observes, then any Naturalist does.

The Inferences made by our Apostle are radically and generally Two. The One
Negative, Per Reductionem ad impossible, aut absurdum: The other Affirmative,
by Positive Proof.

The Negative has many branches:

The First is, ver. 13. If there be no Resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
not risen.

The Second springs out of this, in the 14. verse; And if Christ be not risen,
then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. And yet of this their
Faith One Branch was, Their Belief in Christ's death and passion.

The Third Branch seems to spring out of both these, verse 15. Yea and we are
found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God, that he raised
up Christ, whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

The First Branch is resumed again by our Apostle in the sixteenth verse: and
the Second likewise in the seventeenth, with this Addition, that, If Christ be
not raised, then such as believe in Christ are yet in their sins. And ver. 18.
Then they which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished; not only frustrated
of their hopes of the life to come, but deprived or couzened of such pleasures
or contentments of this life, as the unbelievers enjoy, and without loss or
detriment might enjoy, if the dead were not to be raised up; or if Christ were
not already raised from the dead. For he says, ver. 19. If in this life only
we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

The affirmative inference is contained in ver. 12. (and 20.) Now if Christ be
Preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no
Resurrection from the dead? This interrogation resolved into an Affirmative,
imports thus much; If we truly Preach, and you truly believe, that Christ was
raised from the dead, then we must of necessity Preach, and you of necessity
believe, that there shall be a general Resurrection of the dead, and that such
as die in Christ shall be raised up to immortal Glory. And this affirmative is
expressly assumed by our Apostle, ver. 20. But now is Christ risen from the
dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. And afterward, by him
powerfully reinforced, as may be seen, in the 21, 22, and 23. verses.

That this is our Apostles intent and meaning there can be no question; All The
difficulty is, how either the Negative inferences or inconveniences How S.
Paul's inferences may be collected.
which he presses upon such as deny the Resurrection of the dead, or the
affirmative points which he charge these Corinthians, and in them, us,
undoubtedly to believe, can be concludently gathered from the principles of our
belief.

2. To begin with the Negative Inferences, and in particular with the third
Branch, ver. 15. Yea, and We are found false witnesses of God, etc. Let us
examine wherein did, wherein could, the falsehood of this Testimony consist?

Some perhaps would reply, that, We are not to say any thing of God (though not
benefitting his Majesty,) but that which is most true. We are not indeed; so
far as we know or believe: But albeit we fail in that we speak of him, yet this
is not enough to convince us of bearing false Testimony of Him. To say or speak
that of any which we take to be the Truth, and to say it, not with purpose to
caluminate or slander, but rather to his praise or commendations, is not to
bear false Testimony of him, much less against him; albeit we be out of
charity mistaken in that which we say of him. Admit then, That the Apostle had
been in some error concerning the Resurrection, when he first taught the
Romans and these Corinthians; That, As Christ was raised from the dead to life
immortal, so we also in good time shall be raised to the same or like imortal
life; and, that, as he, So we also, should be raised by the immediate power of
God, his supposed mistake in the latter, could not convince him of bearing
false Testimony on Gods behalf, seeing that which he says concerning the
Resurrection of others (besides Christ) from the dead, does tend to Gods glory.
For to bear false Testimony of or against any, Does always include some matter
of imputation, of aspersion, or prejudice; Whether we bear such testimony of
God or of man.

What imputation or prejudice was it then to affirm, that God had raised up
Christ from the dead, if there were no general Resurrection of others from the
dead? or wherein does the falsehood of the testimony, which our Apostle seeks
to avert from himself, punctually consist? Did it consist in saying, That he
raised up Christ, whom he did not raise up, if so be the dead rise not? The
Apostle does not suppose it as questionable (much less simply deny it) That
God did raise up Christ from the dead; but only deduceth his adversary to this
inconvenience or absurdity, that if the dead were not raised up, then Christ
was not raised, and that he had born false witness of God in saying that he had
raised up Christ. So that, The ground of the false Testimony lies in the
denying of others Resurrection from the dead. Yea to avouch that God did raise
up Christ from the dead (although the fact were true and unquestionable that
God did raise him up,) were in our Apostles Divinity to lay an imputation or
slander on God, if so be that such as believe in Christ, and die in Christ,
should not be raised up unto bliss and glory: Better it were (or at least less
evil) in our Apostles Judgment, to deny that Christ was risen from the dead,
then granting This, to deny The Resurrection of such as sleep in Christ. For to
grant the former and to deny the Latter, were to cast an imputation of folly
upon God, and an aspersion of imposture upon the Son of God Christ Jesus our
Lord. What imputation then is it unto God, or how does this Aspersion rise, and
fall upon Christ or his Apostle, by granting that Christ was indeed raised up;
and yet denying, that the dead shall be raised up again?

3. It is a Maxim in Philosophy generally acknowledged if not first conceived
A Philosophical Maxim advanced and much improved.
by the heathens: [Deus et natura nihil frustra Faciunt, God and nature work
nothing in vain.] From this principle such of the heathens as knew not God,
such as denied His providence, or knew not how to distinguish him or it from
nature, held it an impiety or profaneness, to slander nature either of Error
in her working, or of folly in producing effects to no good end or purpose.
Some there were, which did question whether Monsters (as children, which are
born with two heads, with more Toes or fingers then are usual etc.) were not
Errata naturae, errors, imperfections or oversights of nature. But they
finally resolve, that albeit such events might fall out by the error, or
contrary to the intentions or endeavors of That particular nature, wherein
these misfigurations were found; yet they were intended by a more General
nature, and intended by it to some good use and purpose: As, commonly,
prodigious births do portend somewhat, whose knowledge is useful and good for
others. Now the Heathens erred in ascribing that, to general or universal
Nature, which was peculiar unto God, who is the Author, Moderator, and guide of
Nature, whether general or particular.

And if by general or Universal nature they meant no other thing, then we do by
the guide and God of nature, Mentem teneant, Linguam corrigant, their meaning
was good, but their expression of it much amiss. This we know, that God does
suffer or cause nature often times to miscarry in her course or projects for ends
best known to himself. No man is born blind, or deaf, or dumb, without some
error or defect in that particular nature, whereof, or by which, his body is
framed. All these and the like effects are besides the intention, or contrary
to the endeavor of nature, which always aims at the best. Hence our Saviors
Disciples, as we read, John 9. ver. 2. When they saw a man, which was blind
from his birth, asked of their master; who did sin, this man or his parents,
that he was born blind? They had not moved this Question, unless by light of
nature they had known, that blindness from his birth, was contrary to the
ordinary and common course of nature; though not contrary but consonant, to
the Will of God in this particular. For it is more then probable that they had
read, though then perhaps they did not actually remember, who made the dumb or
the deaf, him that sees or the blind? Have not I the Lord? Exodus 4. 11. God,
they likewise knew, did for some good end or just cause, either suffer or cause
nature to miscarry in this man; And they likewise knew sin to be a just cause
of many miscarriages in the humane nature. And hence they question, Whether God
had punished this man with blindness from the birth for his own or for his
parents sins.

But they themselves did err in collecting, That extraordinary blindness had
befallen him, either for some extraordinary sins of his own, or of his
parents, and this error our Savior rectifies ver. 3. Neither has this man
sinned, nor his parents; that is, neither of them were more extraordinary
sinners then others were, who neither were blind themselves, nor had children
that were blind from the birth. The true cause of this defect in natures work
in framing this man; the true reason why he was born blind (as our Savior
expresses in the next words) was, that the works of God should be made
manifest in him. So true it is, which the heathens had observed, [Deus et
natura nihil frustra faciunt.] It was not in vain, nor to no purpose, that
nature did not effect or accomplish her work in this poor man; for by this
means, Gods works in him were more manifest to himself and others, then if he
had been born with Eagles eyes. He was not only cured miraculously of his
native blindness, but the eyes of his understanding by this miraculous cure
were opened and enlightened to see more for his souls health, then the learned
Scribes and Pharisees did, in whom neither nature nor Art had been defective.

4. Galen, that great Physician and curious searcher into all the secrets of
the humane nature, had well observed, That there is no part nor parcel in the
whole body of man, which has not its proper use. And from contemplation of
this undoubted Truth; he was enforced to acknowledge, what otherwise he seemd
to deny, Divinum Opificem, A Divine Artificer or worker, even of the least and
most contemptible parts of man's natural body. And of This work of God, though
much defaced by our first parents sin, he gave the like verdict that God
himself did of all his works; That every part of man's body was good, exceeding
good, and admirably framed to its proper use or function. The most artificial
works of man, of the most exquisit, and most industrious Artificer, will
always admit some errors and defects; no work of man is good in its kind;
That is the best, which has the fewest faults or oversights, or is adorned
with the fewest impertinent or unuseful beautifications; Whereas the works of
nature, even the defects of particular nature, are useful and profitable for
the setting forth of Gods glory, and for procurement or advancement of the
public good. Now if the ordinary works of nature (which be likewise the works
of God) be never vain, idle, or impertinent; but have a correspondent use or
End, to which without error they serve; Much more must the extraordinary
works of God be presupposed to have some special End or extraordinary use, as
proportionable to them, as the end or use of ordinary works of nature are to
the ordinary operations or endeavors of nature. Now our Apostle supposes That
our Saviors Resurrection from the dead, was an extraordinary work of God; The
most remarkable work of God,
that had been manifested to the world; and by necessary consequence, it must
have an effect or end most remarkably correspondent unto it; and what was that?
The resurrection of such as live and die in Christ; or rather the manifestation
of Gods glory and unspeakable goodness in their Resurrection unto immortal
glory and happiness.

5. The former principle [Deus nihil frustra facit] being thus far improved
That all Gods special and admirable works tend to some special and admirable
use and purpose:) both parts of our Apostles mutual inference; as well the
Negative; [If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised,] as the
Affirmative; [If Christ be raised, then shall the dead arise] will appear to be
as Firm and sound, as the mutual Inference of the Cause from the Effect, and of
the Effect from the Cause; or as firm and sound as the mutual Inference of the
Final Cause by the Efficient, and of the Efficient by the Final. Albeit to
speak properly, and in the exact terms of the Schools; The necessity of the
Efficient Cause depends upon the necessity of the End; The End makes the
Efficient to be necessary; The Efficient does not make the End to be
necessary. The immediate proper Effect of the Efficient is not the End or
final Cause it self, but Medium proxime destinatum ad finem, some Mean
immediately destinated to the end; without which the End or scope, at which
Nature in her operations aimed, cannot be obtained.

If one should ask why man and other terrestrial creatures have Lungs, when as
fishes (as most men and more probably think) have none?

The reason were good, and the answer satisfactory, to say, That man and other
like creatures stand in need of Respiration, and so of Lungs to temperor cool
their blood, with whose excessive heat or distemper life otherwise would
quickly be choked. The preservation then of life is the End or Final Cause,
why man and other like creatures have Lungs. But why life should be preserved
no Cause can be given in nature; This is a Principle presupposed. Howbeit of
respiration or breathing, without which the life of man cannot be preserved or
continued, the Lungs are the true and proper Efficient Cause.

This Mutual Inference is good, Quicquid pulmones habet, respirat; Quicquid
respirat, pulmones habet. Whatsoever creature has lungs, has also the benefit
of breath or respiration; This is an Argument from the Cause. And whatsoever
has the benefit of breathing or respiration has lungs; This is an Argument
from the Effect. And again Negatively; Whatsoever has no lungs, has no
benefit of breath or respiration. Whatsoever has not the benefit of
respiration has no Lungs.

In St. Paul's Divinity, The manifestation of Gods Glory and Goodness in the
Redemption of man, is the End or Final Cause of all the Articles which we
believe concerning Christ as God and man; of which, even for this reason, we
are to seek no further Cause or reason. But the manifestation of this His
Goodness being presupposed as made necessary by His Omnipotent Will; The Mutual
Inference between the Son of Gods Incarnation, or between the several parts of
his Sacerdotal or Regal Function, and the several parts of our Redemption, will
be as perspicuous and firm, as any Inference included in the former or like
Instances.

First, Unless Gods Will and Pleasure had been set to manifest His Goodness in
the Redemption of mankind, the Son of God had not been Incarnate, had not Died,
had not been Raised from the dead. The manifestation of Gods Glory in our
Redemption was the true Cause why the Son of God was to be incarnate: His
Incarnation was not the Cause why Gods Goodness was to be manifested, or why
His Will and pleasure was set to redeem us. For This (as we said) is the Final
Cause, and can have no other Cause of its necessity; but rather imposes a
necessity upon other Causes subordinate, as upon Christ's Incarnation, Passion
and Resurrection. But however Christ's Incarnation was not the Cause why Gods
Glory and Goodness was to be manifested in our Redemption; yet the actual
manifestation of Gods Goodness in our Redemption, and our Redemption it self is
procured by the Incarnation and Sacerdotal function of Christ, as by a true and
proper Efficient Cause.

And we may safely Infer: First, That unless the Son of God had been incarnate,
Gods Goodness to us had not been so admirably manifested.

Secondly, Unless the Son of God had become man, man could not have been
delivered from the fetters and chains of sin, much less restored to his first
dignity.

And yet more; in that the Son of God became man, this is an Argument evident
to us from the Effect, that man by sin had become the Son of Satan: Sin then
was the cause of Christ's Incarnation, and Christ's Incarnation is the cause or
means of our deliverance or Redemption from sin.

Again, Unless man by Sin had become the servant of sin and bondman of Satan,
the Son of God had not taken upon him the Form of a Servant. But in as much as
the Son of God was found in the true Form of a Servant, this is an Argument
from the Effect, evident to convince our consciences that we Sons of men were
by nature the servants or bondmen of Satan.

Lastly, Unless the wages of sin, and of our service done to Satan by working
the works of sin, had been death; the true and natural Son of God had not been
put to death. Our sins then, and the wages due to our sins (that was death)
were the Causes of his death. And in that he truly dyed for us, This is an
Argument evident from the Effect, Therefore, we were dead in our sins.

Be it so! Yet seeing the Son of God died for our sins before he was raised
from the dead, how says our Apostle in the 17. verse, [If Christ be not raised
ye are yet in your sins?] Could these Corinthians or any others be still in
their sins after their sins were taken away? Or will any man deny that their
sins were taken away by Christ's death at the very instant of his souls
departure from the body, or when he said Consummatum est, it is finished? What
was finished? The work which he undertook; and that was the Taking away of our
sins, or the work of our Redemption. Now if this work were finished, when our
Savior Christ said, It is finished, these Corinthians sins were taken away
before Christ's Resurrection. And if sin by Christ's death had been actually and
utterly taken away, our Apostles Inference in this place had been unsound, none
had remained in their sins, albeit Christ had not risen again. Sin then, even
the sins of the world were taken away by Christ's death, but not actually and
utterly taken away, If sin had been so taken away by Christ's death, there
had been no such necessity of Christ's Resurrection from the dead, as our
Apostle here presses upon the Corinthians, not as matter of Opinion, but as a
Fundamental Principle of Faith. It remains then to be declared, In what sense,
or how far, sin was taken away by Christ's death; In what sense it has been, or
how far it shall be taken away by his Resurrection.

7. First then Christ's death was a Ransom all-sufficient for the sins of the Sea Chap. 4.. 12.
world, the full price of redemption for all mankind throughout the world from
the beginning to the end of it. But did not many, who died before Christ, die
in their sins? They did; yet He was promised to our first Parents, To the end,
that even these might not die in their sins. How these come to forfeit their
Interest in the Promise made to Adam, and to all that came after him, That we
leave to the Wisdom of God. Of this we are sure, That the Wisdom and Son of God
did die for all men then living, and for all that were to live after unto the
worlds end. And in as much as he dyed for all, he is said to take away the sins
of all; that is, he paid the full Ransom for the sins of all, and purchased A
General Pardon at his Fathers hands; and he himself by dying became an
universal inexhaustible sovereign Medicine for all sins, that were then extant
in the world, or should be extant in man until the worlds end.

So then by his death he took away the sins of the world in a Twofold Sense.
Christ's death said to take away sin, in a Twofold Sense. The First.


First, In that he paid the full Ransom for the sins of all men. Whatsoever
sins were past could be no prejudice to any, so they would embrace Gods Pardon
sealed by Christ's death, and proclaimed by his Apostles and Disciples after his
death. In this sense we may say, The Kings General Pardon takes away all
offenses and misdemeanors against his Crown and Dignity, albeit many
afterward suffer for such Misdemeanors, only, because they do not sue out
their Pardons, or crave allowance of them.

Christ is said again to take away the sins of the world by his death, in as
much as by his death he became the universal and sovereign medicine for all
men's The second Sense.
sins. But many dyed in Israel, not because there was no Balm in Gilead; as
many do amongst us, not so much for want of good Physic or sovereign
Medicines, as for want of will to seek for them in due time; or for wilfulness
in not using Medicines proffered unto them. So then, it will not follow, That no
man dies in his sin since Christ's Death; Albeit we grant that the sins of all
were taken away by his death. For They were not so taken away, as that men
might not resume or take them again; And the greatest condemnation, which shall
befall the world, will be; That when God had taken away their sins, they would
not part with their sins; That when God would have healed them, they would not
be healed.

But had these Corinthians been any further from having their sins taken away
by Christ's death, if Christ had truly died for them, and yet but only died The
Benefits punctually arising from Christ's Death, and from His Resurrection.
for them, and not risen again?

Yes! Though Christ had dyed for All, yet all had died in their sins, if He had
only died, and had not been raised again. This Inference is expressly avouched
by our Apostle in the 17, and 18, verses; If Christ be not raised, then they
also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished; and yet he supposes that
they believed in Christ's Death.

But though the Inference be most true, because avouched by our Apostle, yet is
it not Universally, but Indefinitely true: How far, and in respect of what
sins, or in what degree of perishing, it is true, That is the Question.

8. Christ was delivered, says the Apostle (his meaning is, He was delivered
unto death) for our sins, and he was raised again for our Justification, Romans
4. 25. Are we then Otherwise Justified by His Resurrection, then we are by His
Death? So our Apostles words import: And if otherwise Justified by His
Resurrection then by His Death, Then are our sins Otherwise taken away by
virtue of His Resurrection, then by virtue of His Death they were taken away.
What shall we say then? That Christ's Death did not Merit all the benefits,
which God had to bestow upon us? God forbid! all this notwithstanding, We do
not receive all the Benefits, which God for his Deaths sake bestows upon us, by
believing only in his death; But even This benefit of our Justification we
receive more immediately by our Belief of his Resurrection from the dead.

This is the doctrine of our Apostle even in that place, wherein he handles the
doctrine of Justification by Faith alone, or by the Imputation of Christ's
Righteousness, Ex Profess; as, Romans 4. 23, 24. Now it was not written for his
sake (to wit, Abraham's) alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us also, to
whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him, that raised up Jesus from the
dead. And he gives the Reason, why our Belief of this Article should be imputed
unto us (in the next words) Seeing he was delivered to death for our offenses,
and raised again for our Justification. Howbeit even This Belief of His
Resurrection is a Grace or Blessing of God, which Christ did merit by His
Death; yet a Grace conveihed unto us by the virtue of His Resurrection, or by
Christ himself, by his Resurrection, exalted unto glory in his human nature.

We were Justified by his Death, in as much as The Pardon for our sins was by
it purchased, and the hand writing or obligation against us cancelled. If
Christ then had only dyed for us and not risen again, we might by Belief in his
Death have escaped the Second Death or everlasting pains of hell. We Had Christ
only died, and not risen again; Though we had not come in Hell, yet we had
never come out of the Grave
should notwithstanding, as our Apostle here supposes, have been detained
perpetual prisoners in the grave. Our bodily or corporal being should have been
utterly consumed by the first Death, without hope of recovery or restitution.
And so far as the first Death had dominion over men, so far had these
Corinthians remained in their sins. So long as the first Death remains
unconquered, sin remains. Now if Christ had not been raised from the dead, the
first Death or death of the body, had remained unconquered. Belief in Christ's
death could not utterly have freed them from all the wages of sin; For death of
the body is in us part of the wages of sin; and it was to Christ part of the
burden of our sin. But in as much as Christ is risen from the dead, and raised
to an immortal life, over which bodily death has no Rule or dominion, but must
be put in absolute subjection to Him; all that truly believe such a
Resurrection are justified not only from the eternal guilt of sin, nor only
freed from everlasting death; but are made heirs by adoption unto a life, over
which death shall have no power. So then by Christ's Death we are freed from the
everlasting Curse; by his Resurrection we are made free Denisons of the
heavenly Jerusalem, heirs by promise of an everlasting and most blessed life.
And thus far all that are partakers of the Word and Sacraments are said to be
justified by his Resurrection; that is, they are bound to believe, that as He
died for their Sins to redeem them from the second death; so he rose again for
their further Justification to free them from the death of the body: He
therefore rose from the dead, that we, by believing this Article, might receive
the Adoption of the Sons of God.

But yet there is a further degree of Justification, that is, an Actual
Absolution from the Reign or Dominion of sin in our Bodies, which is never
obtained without some measure of Faith or Sanctifying Grace inherent; albeit
the true use and end of such Grace and Faith inherent, be, to sue out the
Pardon, for our sins in particular; not by our works or merits, (which are
none) but merely and solely by the Free Grace and Favor of God in Christ. True
it is, that even This Gift of Faith, by which we must sue out our Pardon in
particular, and supplicate for the Adoption of the Sons of God, was purchased
by Christ's death; nor may we sue for it under any other Style or Form then
propter merita Christi, for the merits of Christ. Yet after this plea made, we
may not expect to receive this blessing otherwise, then per Jesum Christum,
through or by Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead. This Grace, this
Faith, and whatsoever other blessing of God, which Christ by his death has
merited for us; whatsoever is any way conducent to our full and final
Redemption, descends immediately from the Son of God exalted in his human
nature, as from its proper Fountain. He was consecrated by his death (and his
Consecration was accomplished by his Resurrection) to be an inexhaustible
fountain of life and salvation to all, that truly believe in his death and
Resurrection from the dead.

Thus we are fallen into the Affirmative Inference [If Christ be risen from the
dead, then such as die in Christ shall be raised from death to immortal Glory.]
The same Almighty Power, by which Christ was raised unto glory, shall be
manifested even in these our mortal bodies: [But now is Christ risen from the
dead, and is become the first fruits of them that slept.]

9. The Inference or implication is; That seeing Christ, whose mortality was
clearly testified by his death, was raised up to an endless and immortal life,
Therefore such as die in Christ (whatsoever in the mean time become of their
bodies) shall be raised up to the like life, against which death shall never be
able to make any attempt or approach. For as the Apostle says, Romans 11. 16. If
the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are
the branches. But we are to remember that there were Two sorts of First fruits
appointed by the Law; the One of the first corn that was reaped, being ground
and made up into loaves, which were offered at the Two sorts of First fruits
appointed by the Law.
feast of Pentecost; And unto this sort of First fruits the Apostle, Romans 11.
16. has Reference.

The other was the offering of green corn when it first begun to bud or ear;
And unto this sort of First fruits our Apostle here in the twentieth verse,
has Reference. Christ then is the root, and we are the branches; he is the
First fruits, and we are the after-crop and harvest. Now as the offering of the
First fruits; that is, of the green corn, was the hallowing of the whole crop;
So the Resurrection of Christ from the grave was the hallowing or consecration
of these our mortal bodies unto that glory and immortality which shall be at
the final Resurrection. If God did accept the offering of the First fruits, it
was a pledge unto his people, that he would extraordinarily bless the
after-crop with large increase; his people might with confidence expect a
joyful harvest. To manifest the meaning or fulfilling of this Type or legal
Ceremony in our Savior; He was raised up from the dead upon that very day in
the morning, wherein the first fruits of green corn were by the priests of the
Law offered unto God. His resurrection (as was said before) was the
accomplishment of his consecration to the priesthood after the order of
Melchisedec; His presentation of himself to his Father as our High Priest, and
as the First fruits from the dead, was the most acceptable offering or
sacrifice that ever was offered unto God; a matter of greater joy
and triumph to all the inhabitants of Heaven, then Isaac's safe return from
the intended sacrifice was to Abraham's family, or then Joseph's advancement in
Egypt was to old Jacob. Now if the First fruits from the dead were thus
acceptable unto God, we cannot distrust but that the after-crop shall prosper,
and shall be gathered by the Angels of God (when the the time of ripeness shall
come) into everlasting habitations. However in the mean time it be sown, it
shall be reaped in Glory, and possess its glory in immortality.

This Article then of Christ's Resurrection from the dead, and of his becoming
the First fruits of them that sleep, is the ground or root of all our Apostles
Inferences from verse. 35, to the end of this chapter, concerning the
Resurrection, or the estate of their bodies, that shall be raised to life: but
of these we have spoken at large before: The sum of all is intimated by our
Savior himself, John 12. 23, 24. The hour is come, that the Son of man should
be glorified. Verily I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the
ground and die, it abides alone, but if it die it brings forth muh fruit.
Thus much likewise was foretold by the Prophet Esaias in that Evangelical
Prophecy, Esaias 53. 10. When thou shall make his soul an offering for sin, he
shall see his Seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord
shall prosper in his hand. Now this pleasure of the Lord was our full
Redemption.

10. To conclude this point: Albeit our Sins were taken away by Christ's death
in both the Senses before mentioned; and albeit in this life we be Actually See
Paragraph the 7th,
Justified, that is actually acquitted from the guilt of sins past by Belief in
Christ's Death and Resurrection; and freed likewise from the rage and tyranny
of sin by Participation of his Grace, and Inhabitation of his Spirit in us; yet
shall we not be Absolutely and Finally Justified, that is freed from all
Relics of sin inherent, until we be made partakers of his Glory, This must
be the Accomplishment of our Justification by Faith in this life: And it is no
Paradox or strange opinion to say, that We sinful men shall be finally
Justified by utter extirpation of sin out of our nature at our last
Resurrection: When as Christ himself, in whom sin never took any root, much
less bore any branch; into whom no seed of sin did ever fall, is said to be
Justified by His Resurrection from the Dead, that is, acquitted from all
burden of our sins.

But where is Christ said, in this sense, to be Justified? In the 1 Timothy 3. 16:
Without controversy, Great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifested
in the flesh, and Justified in the Spirit. To omit all other interpretation of
this phrase, St. Paul means the very self same thing by saying, Christ is
Justified in the Spirit, that St. Peter means when he says, He was quickened
in the Spirit, 1 Pet. 3. 18. Both mean, That he was Justified or freed, by the
Spirit or Power of the Godhead, from death or any other further burden of our
sins. Christ, says St. Paul, Heb. 9. 28. was once offered to bear the sins of
many, and unto them that look for him, he shall appear the second time without
sin unto salvation: that is, to free us from the power of death, and all
burden of sin, from which he himself was freed at His Resurrection. So then,
it is in its time and place most true, which the Romish Church does most
untruly teach; that there is a Justification by inherent righteousness. But
this Justification cannot be had, may not be expected in this life; it cannot
be accomplished in us until that Change be wrought, whereof our Apostle speaks,
verse 51. of this Chapter. This Final Justification by this blessed Change, is
the full Effect or final issue of Christ's Resurrection from the dead: he that
does not believe this future change or final issue of Christ's Resurrection,
does bear false Testimony of God, or against him, even whilst he says, that
he believes that Christ was raised from the dead. For to grant Christ's
Resurrection from the dead, and to deny or doubt of this Final Justification or
Absolution of all true believers in his Resurrection, from the relics of sin,
is to cast an Aspersion upon God himself, as if he had wrought this great work
of Christ's Resurrection, frustra; that is, to no Use or End correspondent to
such a mighty Groundwork or Foundation.

11. Every man then is bound to believe, That all true Beleivers of Christ's
Resurrection from the dead shall be undoubted partakers of that endless and
immortal glory, unto which Christ has been raised. But no man is bound to
believe his own Resurrection in particular unto such glory, any further or upon
more certain terms, then he can (upon just and deliberate Examination) find,
that he himself does truly and steadfastly believe this Fundamental Article of
Christ's Resurrection from the dead. Now if it were certainly determined and
agreed upon by all, what it were truly and steadfastly to believe this Article,
all the controversies concerning the Certainty of Salvation, or Irrevocable
Justification, in this life, by Faith, would determine themselves, and be at an
end. But of the Examination of our Faith, or of its truth, sincerity, or
strength, we shall have fitter occasion and more full time to speak in
unfolding of the last part of the Article of Christ's coming to Judgment; that
is, the manner of the Process in the Award of final Sentence.

In the mean time it shall suffice to admonish the Reader, That he rate not the
truth, or measure the strength of his Belief in this main Article of Christ's
Resurrection, only by the strength of his persuasions of its Speculative and
General Truth; specially, in the absence of temptations to the contrary, or
How we may try our selves. See Book 10. Chapt. 28. 30.
whiles it is opposed to the exceptions of Atheists or Insidels, which deny or
oppugn it. How then must the truth or strength of our Belief or Faith in this
Article be measured? Only by our steadfast and constant practice of the Special
Duties, whereunto the belief of it does bind all professors of it. Now the
Special Duties, whereunto the Belief of it does bind us, are succinctly and
pithily set down by our Apostle, Col. 3. 1, 2. If then ye be risen with Christ,
seek those things which are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of
God; set your affections on things above, not on things on earth, etc. And
verse the 5. Mortify therefore your members, which are upon earth,
fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and
covetousness, which is Idolatry. And verse 8. Put off all these, anger, wrath,
malice, blasphemy, silthy communication out of your mouth, Lie not one to
another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds. All of us have
put off the old man by profession and Solemn Vow at our Baptism; and a double
Woe or Curse shall befall us, unless we put him off in practice and resolution;
and labor to put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the Image
of him that created him.

The particular Limbs of this New man are set forth unto us by our Apostle,
verse 13, 14. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye: And above
all these things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectness. The
particular Duties required of men and women according to their several
conditions or states of life, (as of Wives to Husbands, and of Husbands to
Wives; as of Children to Parents, and of Parents to Children; of Servants to
Masters, and of Masters to Servants) are set down by the same Apostle in the
verses following unto the end of the Chapter.

Now we must be altogether as certain that we do truly, sincerely, and
constantly perform these duties which are by our Apostle in this place required
(whether as General to all Christians, or such as concern particular estates of
life) as we are of This general, [That whosoever does truly mortify the deeds
of the body and perform the other duties here required shall be undoubted
partaker of the Resurrection unto Glory] before we can be certain certitudine
fidei, by certainty of faith, of our salvation or Resurrection unto glory in
particular.

12. Does any amongst us upon the examination required, before the receiving of
the Sacrament, find himself extremely negligent or generally defective in
performance of these duties? Let not such a one take his negligence past, as
any sign or undoubted mark of reprobation; yet would I withal advise him not
to approach the Lords Table without a wedding garment, without a sincere and
hearty sorrow for his negligences past, without a sincere hearty desire of
doing better hereafter. If consciousness of former negligence in these duties,
or of practices contrary unto them, be seasoned with sorrow and hearty desire
of amendment; the point whereon I would advise such a man for the present to
pitch his faith, shall not be his own Election, nor the Certainty of his
present and future estate in Grace, or Real and infallible Interest in Christ
his Resurrection; But upon that Character or description of our Savior, given
by the Evangelical Prophet, Esaias 42. 3. and experienced upon Record by the
Evangelist St. Matthew, Matthew. 12. 20. That he quenches not smoking flax;
that he will not shake the bruised Reed: Remember, that as the Second
Resurrection unto glory, must be wrought by virtue of Christ's Resurrection
from the dead; so the first Resurrection, from the dead works of sin unto
newness of life, must be wrought by the participation of his Body which was
given, and of his Blood which was shed for us. Remember that by his death and
passion he became not only the Ransom, but the Sovereign Medicine for all our
sins; A Medicine for our sins of wilfulness and commission, to make us more
wary not to offend: A Medicine for our sins of negligence and omission, to make
us more diligent in the works of piety; And the time and place appointed for
the receiving of the body and blood of Christ, is the time and place appointed
by Him, for our cure. Heal us then, O Lord, and we shall be healed. Thou, O
Lord, who have abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light
through the Gospel; Enliven and enlighten our hearts by thy Spirit; and in
them, thus enlightened, kindle a love of doing thy Will; bring good intentions
to good desires; and good desires to firm resolutions: and confirm our
Resolutions with constancy and perseverance in thy service.

Amen.
ALmighty God, which have given thine only Son to die for our Sins, and to rise
again for our Justification; mercifully grant, that we both follow the example
of his patience, and be made partakers of his Resurrection, through the same
Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

Almighty God, give us Grace so to cast away the works of Darkness and put on
the Armor of light, now in the Time of this mortal life, in which thy Son
Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that at the last day when he
shall come again in his Glorious Majesty to judge both the Quick and the Dead,
we may rise to the life immortal, through him who lives and reigns with Thee
and the Holy Ghost now and ever. Amen,


The End of the fourth Section.
SECTION V. Of the Article of Everlasting life.
A Transition of the Publishers.
WE are now, by the Good hand of God upon the Work, arrived at The fifth
Section: A very Considerable Part of this Eleventh Book. The Subject matter of
this Section (according to what was cut out, by the Method proposed in the often
mentioned Ninth Chapter) is, The Final Doom, Award, or Sentence of Life and
Death, which, The King of Glory, our most worthy Judge Eternal, shall
respectively pronounce and pass upon all, at that Dreadful and yet Joyful Day
of Judgment; when he shall deal and distribute Palms and Prizes, Crowns and a
Kingdom, to the little (or, in Comparison the less) Flock, or Sheep set at his
Right hand, for whom such good things were prepared from the Foundation of the
world: But utter Extermination to the goats on the Left hand, whom he will send
accursed into Everlasting Prisons, there to be tormented in that fire which was
first prepared (not for them, but) for their Tempter and tormentors the Devil
and his Angels.

I confess, our Great Author closes not with the Point of Everlasting life,
till he come to the Twentieth Chapter. But I thought my self bound here to
insert the Three next Chapters viz. the 17, 18, and 19, for these reasons
following.

1. Because they be Three, and the First Three of Thirteen Excellent and most
Elaborate Tracts all in order composed upon The sixth Chapter to the Romans:
and pity it was to sever them from the Other, with which they so well consort
and sure.

2. If I had left out These Three, I should not only have done prejudice to
the Author and his work, but to the Reader (and his Content or benefit) who
will find, that these Three Chapters are as comely and as useful Introductions
to his Rich Discourses about the Domus Aeternitatis, the two several long Homes
of all mankind; as any Propylaea or Areae can possibly be to any two Houses of
this Worlds Building.

3. The Doctrine delivered in these Three Next Chapters is so promotive and
incentive of Christian Piety, and some of it so Homogeneal to the ensuing
Tracts, that they could not be more fitly placed then before the Discourses
about the Final Award or Sentence.

4. It is my Judgment; That had this learned Author left none other, These
Thirteen Treatises put together would make a very Excellent Compend of
Christian Instruction.

CHAP. XVII.
ROMANS 6. Ver. 21, 22, 23. 21. What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof
ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is Death.

22. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your
fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

23. For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life,
Through Jesus Christ our Lord.


The Connection of the fifth and sixth Chapters. A Paraphrase upon this Sixth.
The Importance of the Phrase [Dead to Sin.] No Christians in this life so dead
to sin as to come up to the Resemblance of Death Natural. True Christians Dead
to Sin in a proportion to Civil Death. All Christians (at least all the Romans
to whom St. Paul writes did so) in Baptism profess themselves Dead to Sin; and
vow Death to Sin by a true Mortification thereof. All have in Baptism (or may
have) a Talent of Grace as an Antidote and Medicine against the deadly
infection of Sin; as a strengthening to make us victorious over sin.

Three Motives to deter us from the Service of Sin. 1. It is fruitless. 2. It
is Shameful. 3. It is Mortiferous.

Two Motives to engage us in Gods Service. 1. Present and sweet Fruit unto
Holiness. 2. Future Happiness.

THese three verses being the Close or binding of all the rest in this Chapter,
or as the Solid Angle in which there The Model or Scope of the whole Chapter.
is a punctual and full Coincidence of all the former Lines, I must be enforced
to exhibit unto the Reader A Model or Abstract of the Whole, before I can show
him the true Connection or References between these later, and the foregoing
verses. And the Model or Abstract of the whole Chapter is This.

Our Apostle had given up this Conclusion as the main Aphorism or Resultance of
the fifth Chapter, verse 20, 21. Where sin abounded, Grace did much more
abound. That as sin had reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. Now whether it were
to check that preposterous Inference which some had already made of this
Doctrine, when first it was delivered unto them (for it was delivered before he
wrote this Epistle:) or whether it were to prevent the making of it, upon the
reading of the former Chapter; our Apostle propounds that Objection, (which
either had been or might be made against the former Doctrine) in the beginning
of this Sixth Chapter; and he propounds it by way of Interrogation. What shall
we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? And he gives the
Answer unto it in the second verse, by an Absit, God forbid: That is, far be it
from us, far be it from every Christian, thus to resolve, thus to infer, say or
think. And to show the absurdity of that inference, he adds this Reason; How
shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?

But this Refutation may seem to participate more of Rhetorical Passion or
indignation, then of sound and Logical Reason; an artificial Evasion rather
then a concludent Proof. For these Romans might have demanded of him: what just
fear is there that we shall, what possibility that we can live any longer in
sin, if, as you suppose, we be already dead unto it? Only prove what you
suppose or take as granted, that we are already dead to sin, or that sin is
dead in us, and we shall make just proof that we neither do, nor can live any
longer in it, that it does not, neither shall it live in us.

2. All the Question then is (and a Great Question it is, upon whose true
resolution, the resolution of all the questions or difficulties which are
emergent Of death to sin.
out of this and other Chapters depends:) In what sense every true Christian is
said to be dead to sin; as St. Paul supposes all these Romans were, which were
true members of the true visible Church.

Of death, there be but two sorts or kinds usually known or acknowledged; The
one a Natural, the other a Civil Death. He that is dead according to a Natural
Death, is utterly deprived of all sense or motion; he cannot feel, he A natural
and a civil death.
cannot taste, he cannot smell, see or hear; his heart pants not, his lungs
cease to send forth any breath. And according to this kind of death Saint Paul
himself could not be accounted dead to sin: Sin was not so fully mortified or
put to death in him, but that it had its Motions in his inward parts; and these
Motions he by experience felt.

But there is a civil as well as a natural death, and many are said to be
civilly dead whose natural life is yet sound and entire. Thus men which are
condemned or sentenced to die, are said to be dead in Law, albeit the execution
or taking away of their natural life be a long time deferred. The like we say
of men which have been free born, but afterward fall into slaverie or bondage.
Both these sorts of men are said to be dead in Law, or to be subject to civil
death, because they cannot do or make any legal act either to the benefit of
their friends or posterity, or to the prejudice of their enemies. Of any civil
contract or legal deed they are as incapable, as he that is naturally dead is
of breathing, sense, or motion. And according to this acception or importance
of death, Every one in whom the reign or dominion of sin is broken, in whom the
flesh is made subject to the spirit, is truly said to be dead to sin: that is,
in every man thus qualified, sin is put unto a civil, though not unto a natural
death.

But neither is this civil death the death here punctually meant by Saint Paul,
when he says, How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? For
he speaks not of such a death to sin, as was peculiar to himself or to some
few; but of such a death as was common to all these Romans, and to every true
member of the visible Church. He does not suppose (nor was it imaginable) that
all of them to whom he wrote, were thus actually dead to sin; or that sin did
not, or could not reign in some of them; at least it may and does to this day
reign in many which have by baptism been admitted into the visible Church:
whereas Our Apostles Reason equally concerns all that are baptized. All and
every one of them are in his sense and meaning in this place, dead to sin; and
yet are not all of them dead to sin, or sin dead to them, or in them, either by
a natural or civil death. In all of them sin retains some life or being, in
many of them it still retains its Soveraigntie or Dominion. how then are all of
them, how are all of us, that have been baptized, dead to sin? Thus in the
first place.

3. All of them did solemnly promise and vow to mortify the deeds of the body,
as we now do. But so may others do which never meant to be baptized. Death to
sin is vowed by us in Baptism.
It is true; and therefore the full and only Reason, why these Romans (one and
other) were reckoned as dead to sin, was not because they had promised or vowed
to mortify the deeds of the flesh, or to put sin unto a civil death, that is
to break the Reign or Dominion of it: For thus to promise or thus to vow
without sufficient means or probable hopes, such hopes and means as by nature
they could not have to perform what they thus vow, were presumption, a tempting
of God, and provocation of Satan, to take that opportunity which they
themselves offer, to assault them. To compel all that come unto the Sacred
Laver, to undertake that treble vow (which is and has been always solemnly
made and undertaken, either by the parties themselves, which are to be baptized
in case they be of years, or by their sureties) were the part rather of a cruel
Stepdame than the office of a loving Mother, unless the Church our Mother
which exacts this vow of all and every one, could give full assurance to all
and every one of her sons, that God in baptism for his part never fails to
give means sufficient for quelling the reign of sin, for mortifying the deeds
of the body. Means (I mean) sufficient not in themselves only, but sufficient
to every one of us, unless we will be defective unto our selves.

Now add this Reason unto the former, and you have the true and full meaning
of our Apostle when he says, that all that are Baptized are dead to sin;
Means also of dying to sin received in baptism.
that is, First they are dead unto it by solemn vow or profession, Secondly
they are said to be dead unto sin, or sin to be dead in them, in as much as
they in Baptism receive an Antidote from God by which the rage and poison of it
might easily be assuaged or expelled, so they would not either receive that
grace or means which God in Baptism exhibits unto them in vain, or use it
amiss. So we may say that any popular disease is quelled or taken away, after
a sovereign remedy be found against it, which never fails, so men will seek
for it, seasonably apply it, and observe that Diet which the Physician, upon
the taking of it, prescribes unto them.

4. Some in our times there be (and more I think than have been in all the
former) which deny all Baptismal Grace. Others there be which grant some Of
baptismall Grace.
Grace to be conferred by Baptism, even unto infants; but yet these restrain
it only to infants Elect. And This they take to be the meaning of our Churches
Catechism, wherein Children are taught to believe [That as Christ the second
Person in the Trinity did Redeem them and all mankind: So the Holy Ghost (the
third Person) does sanctify them and all the Elect People of God.]

But can any man be persuaded, that it was any part of Our Churches meaning, to
teach Children when they first make profession of their Faith, to believe, that
they are of the number of the Elect, that is, of such as cannot finally perish?
This were to teach them their Faith backwards, and to seek the Kingdom of
Heaven not Ascendendo by ascending, but Descendendo by descending from it. For
higher then thus Saint Paul himself in his greatest perfection could not
possibly reach; no, nor the blessed Angels which have kept their First station
almost these 6000 years. Yet certain it is, that Our Church would have every
one at the very first profession of his Faith, to believe that he is One of the
Elect People of God.

But those Reverend Fathers which did compose that Catechism, and the Church
our Mother which did approve and authorize it, did in charity presume, that
every one which would take upon him to expound this Catechism or Difference
betwixt the Elect and the Elect people of God.
other principles of Faith, should first know the Distinction between the
Elect, that is, such persons as cannot perish, and the Elect People of God: or
between Election unto Gods ordinary Grace or means of salvation, and Election
unto eternal glory. Every People or Nation, every company of men, when they are
first converted from Gentilism to Christianity become an Elect People, a
chosen generation or company of men: that is, they and their seed after them
are made capable of Baptism, receive an Interest in Gods promises made unto us
in Christ, which the heathens whilst they continue heathens cannot have. And
all of Us are in Baptism thus far sanctified, that we are made true members of
the visible Church, qualified for hearing the word, for receiving the Sacrament
of Christ's Body and Blood, and whatsoever Benefits of Christ's Priestly
Function, are committed to the dispensation of his Ministers. And thus far
sanctified by Baptism, no man can be but by the Holy Ghost. Our Apostle says,
1 Cor. 7. 14. That the unbelieving Husband is sanctified by the believing wife:
and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing Husband else were your
children unclean, but now they are holy.

So that he attributes an holiness unto the children of believing Parents by
which they are more capable of Baptism then the children of unbelieving
Parents are. And of this holiness by which they are capable of Baptism, all
children are partakers, although but one of their Parents, whether Father or
Mother, do believe: much more are the children of believing Parents to be
reputed holy or sanctified after baptism, by which always some Gift of the
Holy Ghost is conferred upon them. For even that holiness which was
communicated or derived unto them from their Parents before they were baptized,
or by which they became capable of Baptism, was conferred upon their Parents
by Baptism.

5. Whether This gift or Qualification wherewith The Holy Ghost is said to
sanctify all the Elect people of God, be, or include in it, the Grace of
Regeneration, I will not dispute. That infants are by Baptism regenerated we
may not deny; unless we will take upon us to put another sense upon the
Articles of our Church, than they will naturally bear. But whether such as were
baptized when they came to years of discretion (as most of these Romans were)
did in Baptism receive the Grace of Regeneration, or were forthwith
regenerated; That I leave unto the Schools. It suffices us to know the true
meaning of our Apostle in this place. And this it is. All of us in baptism
receive A gift or Talent which by nature we had not, we could not have. For the
use of this talent we shall be called unto a strict account.
And when this account shall be taken, it shall go harder with those which
either have abused it, misimployed it or not used it, than with the Gentiles,
Heathens or Infidels which never received the like. For to whom more is given,
of them more shall be required.

And unless their means to vanquish Satan the world and the flesh had been
greater than the mere natural man had any, the just Lord would not punish them
more severely than he does the heathen or mere natural men for suffering
themselves to be vanquished by his enemies. They which deny any grace or talent
to be always given in baptism; or affirm this Talent to be given only to some
few which are of the number of the Elect; either do not understand In Baptism,
there is a mutual Astipulation, or promise between God and man.
or do not call to mind what baptism is. Now Baptism on our part is an
Astipulation or promise; (1 Peter 3. ver. 21.) And it is no less on Gods part.
It is a mutual Covenant or Astipulation between God and us. And in every
Covenant or Astipulation there is Ratio dati et accepti, somewhat given and and
somewhat taken. The giving is properly on Gods part, the taking on ours. For in
true and proper terms we cannot give any thing to God, because all we have,
even we our selves, are his by double right, by right of creation and
redemption. Yet it is his pleasure that we in baptism should sincerely and
heartily surrender that unto him which is his own, even our selves, our souls,
and bodies. And he upon this surrender or vow, if it be sincerely made, does
give to us that which was not ours, even his only son with all the benefits of
his death and passion. All of us put him on in baptism, though not all in the
same degree; and we may rest assured, that God would never press us in
baptism, to fight under the banner of his Son, unless he were ready to furnish
us with strength, with weapons, and skill to fight his battails. So we will (as
our Apostle exhorts us) yield our members unto his service, he will teach our
hands to War, and our fingers to fight, and every faculty of our body and soul
to do their part.

6. The Abstract or Brief of our Apostles discourse in this chapter is to stir
up that Gift of God in these Romans which they had received in baptism; or
which is all one, to animate or encourage them to employ that talent, which God
in that Sacrament had concredited unto them, unto his glory. And this his
Exhortation is grounded upon their Profession of dying to sin which they had
made in baptism: or upon the assurance of Gods spirit in the sacred War, so we
will take heart and courage to undertake the fight. There is not one branch of
this Exhortation from the second verse of this chap. to this one and twentieth,
but is rooted in one of these two considerations, or jointly in both. That all
of us in baptism are dead to sin (in that sense which we have showed before)
that is, by solemn vow, or by Professing our death unto it, our Apostle infers
ver. 3. and not only dead but buried. And both this Death and Burial unto sin
was solemnly professed not by Word or Vow only, but by matter of fact or
visible Ceremony then usual in Baptism; for every one that was baptized
(seeing all that were baptized were of good years, and strength of body to
undergo this Ceremony,) were ter demersi in aquis, their whole bodies were
plunged thrice in the water to represent their vowed death and burial unto
sin. This Ternal demersion of their Bodies, as some collect, was not only to
represent Ceremonies used at Baptism and the meaning thereof.
The Holy and blessed Trinity of the Divine Persons in whose names they were
baptized; but withal to represent the three several days wherein Christ lay
buried in the grave. Therefore says the Apostle, we are buried with him by
Baptism unto death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
glory of the Father: even so we also should walk in newness of life. ver. 4.

7. The meaning of the former Ceremony was, and so of Baptism to this day, is,
That as Christ did leave the burden of our sins, and put off the form of a
servant, which for our sakes he undertook, in the grave: so we by baptism and
burial into his death, should put off the old man or body of sin and be raised
unto newness of life, and become partakers of his Resurrection unto glory.

This raising unto newness of life by the Sacrament of Baptism was
represented by the safe Ascension of their Bodies out of the water in the which
they had been thrice plunged. And of our Resurrection unto glory, we receive
the pledge or earnest, when we receive the Grace of Regeneration, that is the
Grace which enables us to walk in newness of life. And this is called the
First Resurrection, without which no man shall be partaker of the second unto
Glory. Now that all such as are truly buried with him by baptism into death,
that is, all such as observe and perform their vow made in baptism shall
undoubtedly be partakers of his Resurrection unto Glory, the Apostle inferres
ver. 5. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death; we
shall be also in the likeness of his Resurrection, and verse. the sixth.
Knowing this that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might
be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead, is
free from sin, ver. 7. that is, He that is dead to sin in this life, is freed
from the life or reign of sin. For it is observable that he does not say, if we
have been planted together in his death, but if we have been planted together
in the likeness of his death. It is not required that we should die the death
of the body as Christ did, but to die as Isaac did, in the similitude and
figure of his death; that is, we should die to sin, or crucify that sin in us,
for which Christ was crucified. And as it is not required that we should die
the death of the body in baptism: so is it not to be expected that we should
forthwith be raised unto that glory whereunto he rose, but to be raised unto A
similitude or likeness of it; that is, unto newness of life, which is the First
Resurrection. And of this Resurrection we shall not fail to be actual partakers
by virtue of baptism, if we be rightly implanted into the similitude of his
death: for so the Apostles words are, If we have been planted together in the
likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his Resurrection.

But what is it to be (...) planted together? or with whom are we planted? we
Gentiles together with the Jews? So some conjecture. But the more ancient and
better exposition is, that we are (...) with Christ, planted together with Him;
yet not so planted together with him as one tree is planted together by another
(Arbor inter or juxta Arbores) each having its several root. But as Christ was
planted by his death and burial, and consecrated to be the root of life; So we
likewise should be planted by Baptism in Him to die to sin, and being so
planted in his death, to be partakers of his Resurrection unto life: As the
implanted graft which loses leaf and sap and (to outward view) life also in
winter, with the Branch or stock into which it was planted, does recover all
again when the root sends back the sap at the Spring or the Resurrection of the
year.

8. This is that which our Savior himself had said, John 15. 4, 5. As the
branch cannot bear fruit in it self, except it abide in the vine, no more can
ye except ye abide in me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches: he that abides
in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without me ye can
do nothing. That is, ye have no root in your selves, and therefore no life but
as you are planted in me, the Vine. Now this Vine was opened in his death upon
the Cross, and planted in his burial: and from him so planted, That of the
Psalmist Ps. 85. 11. was fulfilled, Righteousness did grow out of the earth;
and we being ingrafted or inoculated into him thus planted, become true
branches of the same Vine. Branches we are, but without root in our selves: all
the life we can hope for must be derived from His root.

And the very sum and proper effect of our belief in his death and
Resurrection, is set down by our Apostle ver. 8. 9, 10, 11. Now if we be dead
with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. Knowing that Christ
being raised from the dead, dies no more, death has no more dominion over
him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he
lives unto God. Likewise, reckon your selves also to be dead indeed unto sin:
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

So then if all which are baptized are dead to sin by solemn vow; every one
must know it to be his duty to mortify his earthly members; but none are bound
to believe that they are already actually dead to sin, because they are
baptized. The sum of our Apostles exhortation in the twelfth verse, is, Let not
sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts
thereof; neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto
sin: but yield your selves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and
your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

The height of our hopes in this life, is, to put sin unto a civil death; that
is, to bring the flesh in subjection to the spirit. And this we may and ought
to hope for; So says the Apostle v. 14. Sin shall not have dominion over you,
for ye are not under the Law, but under grace. And Grace is able to give us
that victory over sin which the Law could not, if we will submit our selves
unto the regiment of Grace, and not presume of Gods favor in consciousness The
Regiment of the Law and of Grace.
of sin. This is that which the Apostle rejects with the like indignation (v.
15.) as he had done the former imagination of continuing in sin that grace
might abound. What then? shall we sin because we are not under the Law, but
under grace? God forbid. Know ye not that unto whom ye yield your selves
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of sin unto
death, or of obedience unto righteousness? His meaning is, that albeit they
were by baptism translated from the regiment of the Law unto the regiment of
grace: yet if by presuming upon Gods Grace or favor they continue in sin, they
shall cease to be Gods servants, and become again the servants of sin.

9. It is the Observation of Prosper (an Ancient writer) upon this place. That
as no man can serve two masters; So every man must serve one of these two,
either sin or righteousness; God or Satan: and he that is a servant Prospers
Observation.
to the one, is exempted from the service of the other. He that is a servant of
righteousness is freed from sin, and he that is a servant unto sin, is rather
exempted, then freed from the service of righteousness. Both are avouched by
our Apostle, but with this difference, that being made free from sin, they were
made the servants of righteousness; but when they were the servants of sin,
they were free, not from righteousness, but to righteousness: that is, they did
righteousness no service, de facto, but used their freedom rather to wrong it.

But God be thanked (says our Apostle ver. 17.) that ye were the servants of
sin. A strange kind of speech! The Pharisee indeed did thank God, that he was
no extortioner, no covetous person, nor tainted with such sins, as he thought
the Publican was; but we never read that any Pharisee, Publican, or other did
thank God that he was an extortioner, or that he was a grievous sinner, nor
would God questionless accept of such thanks: For he expects no thanks but for
the good which he does unto the Children of men. Now to be a covetous person,
to be an extortioner, to be a servant to sin, are things which have no goodness
in them, therefore no works of God, no part of his doings. How then does the
Apostle so solemnly thank God on these Romans behalf, that they were the
servants of sin? or is this his thanksgiving to be referred only to the later
part of that 17. verse? But ye have obeyed from the heart that Form of doctrine
which was delivered you. This indeed was worthy of thanks: yet not this alone.
The form of thanksgiving refers as properly and punctually to the first part of
the verse [God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin] as it does to the
later part, [But you have obeyed the form of doctrine, which was delivered unto
you.]

And in the first place, it refers to their former servitude unto sin. For
though God were not the Author of their servitude to sin, as he was of their
obedience to the Doctrine of life; Yet his goodness did turn their former
servitude to sin, the
very worst deed which they had done, unto their good. For take them as now
they were, it was better for them that they had been the servants of sin, than
not to have been so. God, you must consider, at this time required the service
of righteousness at their hands. And he that has been a diligent servant to an
hard and cruel master, from whom he could not in reason expect any recompense
worth his toil, is thereby well enapted and trained to be diligent and faithful
in the service of a gentle loving and bountiful Master. Such was the case and
state of these Romans. They had don extraordinary kindness for a long time unto
sin, and this their service was not only lost in respect of times past, but
very dangerous in the future. Upon this known case or experiment among men,
does our Apostle ground those forcible exhortations in the verses precedent,
which he most strongly concludes with the words of the 21. verse. I speak
(says he ver. 19.) after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of the
flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants unto uncleanness and to
iniquity unto iniquity: even so now yield your members servants to
righteousness, unto holiness. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were
free to righteousness: that is, you did acknowledge no service due unto it. The
implication which he expresses not, is this: Being now become the servants of
righteousness, do as little service unto sin, as when you were its servants, ye
did to righteousness: acknowledge none to it, for none is due to it, especially
from you.

10. But in the 21. verse, if you mark his placing of the words well; he puts
the case home. What fruit had ye then of those things, whereof ye are now
ashamed? What fruit had ye then, at that time when ye did them with greediness?
If the service of sin at any time were fruitful, it is questionless then,
whilst it is a doing. For this Dalilah has the trick to wipe off all shame
from her Lovers faces, whilst sin is in the action or motion. But our Apostle
proves this service of sin to be fruitless, even then, because now, when these
motions were past, it makes them ashamed.

Nor is the service of sin fruitless, only because it brings forth shame, but
therefore more then shameful, full of danger and dread because the shame which
it brings forth, is always the Harbinger or forerunner of death. For so the
Apostles adds, For the end of those things is death. These are the best fruits
of their service to sin; and sin it self is more then fruitles, because the
best fruits which it seems to bring are poisonous. But now these Romans are
called unto the service of a far better master; one from whom they have
somewhat in re, but much more in spe; a bountiful earnest, for the present, of
an invaluable recompense and future reward, ver. 22. But now being free from
sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end
everlasting life.

And finally he binds all his former Exhortations with this undoubted
Assertion; For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Thus you have seen The duty whereunto we stand bound by our Baptism.

And it is twofold. 1. To forsake the Devil, the world, and the flesh; and
secondly to betake our selves to the service of God.

The motives to withdraw us from this service of sin, are three. The service of
it, first, is fruitless, 2. it is shameful. 3. it causes death: to wit, a
most shameful bitter and endless death.

The motives to draw us unto the service of God, are Two. 1. The present fruit
which it yields, viz. the peace of conscience, or that righteousness which is
the flour and Blossom unto Holiness. 2. The Final Reward, which is a most
blessed life without end. The First three Motives to withdraw us from the
service of sin, are as it were linked or mortized one into another. The very
Fruitlesness of Sins service shuts up into shame; and the shame arresting or
seazing upon the sinner is no other then the very Harbinger, Forerunner or
Sergeant of Death.

1. WE are here to speak somewhat to The First Point, which was the fruitlesness
of Sin; of which more afterward.

It was an Ancient saying of a good Writer, praestat otiosum esse quam nihil
agere: it were better to sit still and do nothing, then to busy, and weary
our selves to no purpose. A shame it is in it self, but commonly the beginning
of a far greater shame, to spend our time without any fruit. And if we could
persuade a man that for the present he labors in vain; that for the future he
can expect nothing but wearisom trouble for his long pains, it would be enough
to make him (if he have any wit) ashamed of what he has done; more then enough
(unless he be impudent) to make him give over what he has begun. Yea he is
not a wise man, that does not forecast some probable hopes or gainful issues
of his labors before he begin them. So our Savior tells us, Luke 14. 28. For
which of you intending to build a Tower; sits not down first and counts
the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? Lest happily after he has
laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all that behold it, begin to
mock him, saying: This man began to build, and was not able to finish. If want
of forecast to go through with a work which in the beginning promised fruit, be
a shame, or expose men to scorn or mockery; what is it to begin and continue
those works, whose accomplishing or finishing is more fruitless then the first
beginning? So that the service of sin is in this respect shameful, because it
is Fruitless. But if you observe our Apostle well, he does not infer, that the
works of sin are shameful because they are Fruitless, but, that they are
Fruitless because they are shameful. Shame, and that A positive shame, is the
natural fruit or issue of all service to sin; and not every kind of positive
shame; but a shame accompanied or seconded with death.

That the Apostles Argument may have its full weight or sway upon our souls, we
are in the First place to examine What shame properly is. Secondly, What manner
of death it is which is the wages of sin.

2. Shame is a fear of some evil to ensue; Or an impression of some evil
present; Of shame; what it is, and whence arising.
the fear of whose continuance is more grievous than any present smart. But
though all Shame be a Fear or sense of evil, yet every fear or sense of evil
does not cause shame. Men naturally fear the loss of goods, but, as our Savior
intimates, Mat. 6. 25. most naturally the loss of their lives. Yet if our goods
be taken from us by violence, we are not ashamed of it: the Expectation or
sufferance of this evil causes only sorrow or grief to us, it causes Shame to
him that does it. There is no man almost, but fears a violent and undeserved
death; yet if such a death be set before him, it causes only Sorrow or
heaviness of heart, a dejection of spirit, no Shame or confusion of face: Such
as die guiltless are rather comforted then confounded at the sight or presence
of others. That evil, whose sight moves pity and compassion in others, cannot
breed Shame to him that suffers it. Shame then is a fear of such evil only,
which consists in disgrace or loss of reputation, and is opposed to See
Aristotle Rhet. l. 2. cap. 6 Ethic. Nic. lib. 4. cap. 15.
honor, fame, or praise. Now the desire of honor, fame or praise is the
strongest Motive, the sharpest spur to animate men (especially of better
Spirits) to undertake any danger, to undergo any evil, that is free from
disgrace, or not charged with shame. His Rule in the General was exceeding
good, though mis-applied to him, and to his followers Case; Praestat per
virtutem emori, quam per dedecus vivere. It is better to die with Credit, then
to live with Shame. And this wrought so deeply with him and his Soldiers, that
never any died with greater Resolution then they did; Though all were slain,
yet every man fell in his own rank. But many Romans and other Heathens, less
furious then Catiline and his Soldiers were, have voluntarily submitted
themselves to the lingering tortures of death without any other motive to
undergo or endure them, besides the desire of Fame and Honor. Now the desire
of Fame cannot be so sharp a spur to make men adventure upon noble Enterprises,
though full of danger; but the fear or apprehension of Shame will be as strong
a Curb to withdraw them from lewd and naughty courses. And if the Ministers of
the Gospel, who are Gods Ambassadors; or the Magistrate, who is his Deputy,
had no other Hank or Curb over men committed to their charge, then This: this
alone would be sufficient to keep the most of them from gross exorbitances or
outrageous Courses, did not Satan, the world and flesh, still set up their
Stales or counterfeit pictures of shame to drive men Satan's Stales; false
honor, and false shame.
the contrary way to that whereto we seek by representation of true Shame to
draw them.

3. The Heathen Poet could vantingly say, That none but Fools were either
lifted up with false Honor, or dejected with slanderous Infamy.

Falsus Honor juvat, and mendax Infamia terret; Hor. Epist.

Quem? nisi mendacem and mendosum? -- Lib. 1. Ep. 16.

But it is a sad truth whereof we daily have experiment; That The main Conflict
in our Christian warfare, is between that honor which one man seeks to receive
from another, and that Honor which comes from God alone: Between the fear of
shame and disgrace from men, and that disgrace or shame which is the Award of
Divine Justice. Painted Honor and counterfeit Shame still command in chief (as
it were by Course) for the flesh, the world and the Devil. Nothing is truly
shameful, but malum culpae, but that which is evil or dishonest and against the
Commandments of God. The only constant Rule for knowing what deserves Shame,
what not, is the Decalogue, or ten Commandments. But this is A Rule which will
not be easily applied unto particulars; otherwise then by way of Catechism; and
by this way, God willing, it may be had hereafter: In the mean time, for those
that be Parents of Children, or Fathers of Families, One of the best Catechisms
which they can read unto their Children or other Relations in private, the best
preparation to the more immediate grounds of Religion which they can plant in
any committed to their charge, would be, To inure them to modesty whilst
their affections are pliable; To teach them both by Word and Example, of what
things they ought to be ashamed, and wherein to rejoice or glory.

Aristotle in the second of his Ethics gives this up as the Brief or Compend
of right Education: -- (...) And Siracides sets down (in the 41. Chapter of
Ecclesiasticus) A A large Catalogue or Roll of those things whereof it is a
shameful thing not to be ashamed: And another smaller Table of such things
whereof men ought not to be ashamed, in the 42. If those that are in parendi
sortem geniti and should be under discipline, be suffered to shake off this
Curb or bridle (modesty or fear of shame) whilst they are young, not only
Parents and Masters, but Magistrates and Ministers shall find them past Rule
and Government, when they grow elder and stronger. There is no loss can happen
to man in this life so grievous as the loss of shamefacedness and modesty,
especially in youth.

4. That disposition of mind which in our English we call Shame and Modesty,
or Shamefacedness, has two Characters in the Greek; (...) and Shame and
Modesty.
(...); The former, the Latins express by the word verecundia: the later by
Pudor. This difference the Grammarians observe between them, that the former,
verecundia, is sometime recte facti, there may be a modest fear, at least for
the manner of doing that which in it self is not evil, but not so comely, the
circumstances of time and place, especially the place of our betters being
considered; Pudor is always male facti. We are not or ought not to be ashamed
but for that which is evil. So that Pudor is opposed to moral filthiness or
naughtiness, as verecundia is to unseemliness, or uncomliness: both of them
agree in the general, both are A fear of some censure; but Pudor, or Shame, is,
metus vituperij, a fear of reproach or infamy for doing that which in it self
is evil,

That disposition which the Latins call verecundia was incident to man in his
first and pure estate; The very Angels cover their faces at the presence of
God. And so no doubt but Children should have born an awful and modest respect
unto their Parents, and have been afraid to do those things in their presence,
which done out of their presence had not been evil or unseemly. But that which
the Latins call Pudor, had found no entrance into our nature unless sin had
made it One. Our nature had been sufficiently guarded by its Original
Integrity against just fear of infamy or disgrace. But taking our nature as
now it is polluted with sin, and stained with filthiness, the fear of disgrace
or infamy is no prejudice, but rather an advantage to it. It is a qualification
which makes men more capable of Rule or Government then any reasonlesse
creature is; none of which are capable of this qualification.

5. The life of Government or Jurisdiction consists in the right dispensation
of Poena and Premium, that is, of punishment and reward. And in every well
governed Commonwealth Fame and Honor are the top branches of reward; wealth
or bodily contentments are but supporters unto it. Many, otherwise well
ordered Commonwealths, might err (as most Heathen Commonwealths did) in
defining what true Honor was, or wherein true honor did consist. They did not
err in determining honor as the chief reward or Crown of well doing. Nor did
they err in making disgrace or infamy, as the special branch of punishment.
Mulcts, or loss of goods, loss of life, or bodily torture, come but in the
second or third place: Fear of infamy and hope of Honor were of themselves
sufficient to keep most men within the compass of civilitie, or moral goodness,
were it not generally true in all Commonwealths, which Solomon had observed in
his times. Prove. 28. 4. That they which forsake the Law do praise the wicked;
and so St. Peter tells us, 1 Pet. cap. 4. v. 4. That such as walked in the
ways of the Gentiles, in lasciviousness, lust, excess of wine, ryotings,
banquettings and abominable idolatry, did think it a strange thing, that these
late Converts to whom he wrote this Epistle, did not run with them to the like
excess. And for this cause, as he adds, they speak evil of them; that is, they
put all the shame they could upon them.

As then, so now; Every society of lewd or naughty men, have their usurped
customs, which are equivalent with them to Laws: have their Parliaments
whereby, (woe unto them! Esaias 5. 20.) they attempt to alter or invert the Law of
God, and the Law of nature; to establsh evil for good, and to disgrace
goodness, as if it were evil.

What course of life, what branch of lewdness more infamous by the Law of God
then riot or drunkenness? a vice so shameful, that the Fathers eye must not
pity it in his Children that are tainted with it, but even their natural
Parents, as well the Mother as the Father, are bound by the Law of God (Deuteronomy.
21. 20, 21.) to inform against them, to accuse them before the Magistrate, lest
the shame and sin should reflect upon themselves by connivance. And by the same
Law the public Magistrate is bound upon the accusation of their Parents to put
them to an ignominious death. And yet there is a generation of men outwardly
professing the knowledge of God, and of Christ, which seek to put shame and
ignominy upon all such as will not run with them to the like excess: which
have their Laws and Rules for authorizing and cherishing this lawless and
unruly custom.

God again by his written Law, and by his Sentence against Cain, awards death
and shame to murderers: And yet the seeds of this accursed sin are more then
legitimated; ranked amongst the essential parts of honor; made as the very
touch and trial of Gentry, by men which esteem it a greater shame
to endure the breath of a verbal Lie from another rash mouth, then to tell or
devise an hundred real Lies, or to outface a truth by false oaths. And by this
corrupt custom, which goes current for a sovereign Law amongst braver Spirits
(as they account themselves) the observance of Laws divine and humane (which
forbid all private Revenge, all resolutions to kill or be killed) is branded
with the infamy of Cowardice; A terrible bugbear, but to such only as are Men
in maliciousness, but Children in Knowledge. For it is a sign of the greatest
Cowardice that can be, to be affrighted at the noise of vain words. or to
forsake the Fortress upon a false Alarm, or representation of counterfeit
Colors. As these, so every other vice has its Baud or Advocate to give it
countenance, and to disgrace the contrary virtue.

6. The old Serpent which beguiled the first Man by the first woman, works
still upon the weaker vessel, and makes it his instrument to foyl the stronger.
He is not ignorant that this masculus pudor, as the Philosopher calls it, this
virile or manly fear of shame, whereby youth is naturally restrained from
shameful courses, cannot easily be vanquished, but by suborning this effeminate
or womanish fear of worldly or popular disgrace to betray it, as Dalilah did
her Husband Samson. And the expelling of this masculine by this womanish fear
of disgrace or reproach, is as the putting out of the eyes of discretion,
whereby we discern good from evil. So that Satan leads them up and down at his
pleasure as the Philistines did Samson after he had lost his bodily eyes by the
cutting off his hair.

We have a Saying or Proverb rather; Past Shame, past Grace. The Heathens had
the like Observation, save only that they knew not what Grace meant. They had
no use of the word [Grace] in that sense, which is most common, and yet most
proper with us.

A Child or man past Grace is, with us, as much as Filius perditus, A Son of
perdition; Such an one as Judas was, who yet was not past Grace, that is, not
irrecoverably lost, until he became impudent and obdurate in sin. Now it was
the observation of one, and he was none of the precisest amongst the Heathen,

Illum ego periisse dico, cui quidem periit pudor. I give that man (says
Plautus) for lost, which has lost modesty, or is past shame. Our Common
Proverb, and the Saying of this Poet have this sure Ground in true Divinity;
That want of modesty, or a face incapable of shame supposes a great measure
of iniquity in the breast. That which we call a Brazen face has always for its
Supporter an Iron sinew, or a brawny heart, Jer. 3. 3. and 5. 3. and 6. 15. and
8. 12.

7. As nothing passes into the understanding but by the gates of sense: So the
true belief of that which God threatened unto sin, and that was death, is
ushered into the heart of man by shame and confusion of face. The first
impression of Gods threatenings unto our first Parents was made upon this part.
And all the Sons of Adam even unto this day, either have or might have a pledge
of that which Moses relates concerning their and their eldest Sons hiding
themselves and going out from the presence of the Lord. To this day it is true,
Qui male agit odit Lucem; an evil conscience flies the light or presence of
men; And the face commonly bewrayes the heart; as he said,

Heu quam difficile est crimen non prodere vultu? It is an hard matter not to
confess a crime, or the truth, although the mouth be silent. Yet as some men by
long custom in sin degenerate into Atheists, and see no relics of Gods image
(wherein they were created) in themselves, although the notion of a Godhead or
Divine Power be naturally ingrafted in all: So, though shame and blushing be
most natural to man when he does evil; yet some by long continuance in sin,
shake off this vail or covering of their nakedness. Such they are of whom
Jeremie spoke in the Old, and in the New Testament St. Jude speaks, ver. 10.
Men that are prone to speak evil of those things which they know not: but what
they know naturally as bruit beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves;
and become as impenetrable by shame, as bruit beasts whom God has deprived of
reason. He that is not subject to this passion participates more of the nature
or disposition of collapsed Angels than of collapsed man. The Devils (we read)
do tremble at their belief or apprehension of Gods Judgments. We do not read
that they are ashamed of the evil which deserves it; as our first Parents were.
It is true (though) that they through want of awful respect or reverence unto
the divine Majesty were the Authors of sin, and propagators of shame to their
posterity. All of us are prone to think that they deserved ill, not of God
only but of us: and yet the truth is, that we lay a great deal more blame upon
them then they deserved. They indeed were the first, yet not the greatest
sinners. Many of their posterity in this quality go beyond them: all of us
imitate them too well in their sin, but not in being ashamed when we sin.

8. They had but one Commandment given by God; and having transgressed that,
their Consciences did accuse them; their very looks and gestures gave evidences
against them. We transgress all Gods Commandments, and one and the same
Commandment over and over, God only knows how often; yet are not dejected,
are not confounded, but bear out sail, as if there were no danger: Though every
thing which God in his written Law has prohibited, is a branch of the
forbidden tree. He has as peremptorily forbidden all To have any Gods but Him;
to worship any graven Image; to take his Name in vain, as he did our first
Parents to taste of the Tree of good and evil: Yet even such as would be held
the only true Catholics, Worship Images: and such again as would be accounted
the pure Worshippers of God in truth and spirit, worship their own
Imaginations; and transform the unchangeable nature of the Deity, into unfit
similitudes. Little Children amongst us are mighty Swearers; and nothing more
common in public or private, then to take Gods holy Name in vain, to abuse it
more grossly then the Jew or Heathen could, who knew not God incarnate. And all
this they do without any sign of shame. Women rail upon, revile and curse one
another in the open streets, until their faces grow red indeed, but with a
redness which betokens no shame, which bears no tincture of blush, but rather
of revenge and malice boiling in the heart, or of heat in their tongue, set on
fire by Hell. But these for the most part are of the meaner and baser sort.
Others there be, as far transported with mis-guided Zeal from that modesty
which becomes their Sex; and this Zeal they offer up as strange fire unto God
without blushing, taking the Priests office upon them; to be more then
Teachers, censurers of their Teachers: swift to hear any doctrine that shall
contradict the public voice of the Church, always listening after the
whisperings of such private Spirits, as invert the Tenor of the Gospel, no less
then the old Serpent did the first Commandment which God gave unto mankind.
God had said unto them, Genesis 3. ver. 3. Ye shall not eat of the tree of the
knowledge of Good and Evil, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. But the
Serpent whispers, ver. 4. 5. Ye shall not surely die. For God does know, that
in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be as
Gods, knowing good and evil. A plausible Comment to her which was now giving
the raines to her longing appetite. As plausible a doctrine it is to many of
her Daughters to meddle with the marks of Election and Reprobation, secrets
which God has reserved unto himself. Points full of great difficulty and
greater danger, and wherein such as have waded farthest, have (as I said
before) inverted the Tenor of the Gospel. For it is the perpetual voice of the
Gospel [If thou believe, thou shall be saved: if thou believe not, thou can
not be saved.] The very sum and final resolution of the doctrine of Election,
as it is vulgarly taught, is this: [If thou must be saved, that is, if thou be
of the number of the Elect or predestined, thou shall believe; If thou be not
of the number of the Elect, thou can not believe.] To listen after such
whisperings as these, the weaker Sex take from their Mother Eve; but to be
confident or presumptuous upon such misinterpretations, or to be censurers of
their Superiors, this they learn not from their Mother Eve, but from her false
Teacher. This is a prodigious disposition in Women, whom the Apostle commands
to learn in silence with all subjection, but will not suffer them to teach, or
to usurp authority over the man. 1 Timothy cap. 2. ver. 12. This silence and
modesty is enjoined them as a Penance for their Mother Eves transgression,
Ver. 13, 14. For Adam (says the Apostle) was first formed, then Eve: And Adam
was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
Notwithstanding she shall be saved ((...)) by the promised Seed: If they
continue in faith and charity, and holiness with Sobriety. These are the
means to make their Election sure.

9. All of us both men and women are too prone to imitate our first Parents in
doing that which is evil and forbidden by the Law of God. And seeing better
cannot be expected, it were well if we could as truly imitate them, in being
ashamed of the evil which we have done. They no sooner knew that they were
naked, but they sought a covering for their nakedness of fig leaves: but this
would not serve: For when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the
garden: they hid themselves from his presence amongst the trees. All of us have
an experimental pledge of this which Moses relates concerning them in our
selves, unless we choke or stifle the instinct of corrupted nature, by long
custom or continuance in sin. That our consciences do accuse us; that the sight
of men whom we know or suspect to be conscious of our mis-doings deject us;
both these argue, that we must appear before a Judge, even before that Judge
from whose presence our first Parents hid themselves; at whose appearance we
shall be confounded, if we come before him polluted with such blots and stains
as our souls are ashamed sinful men (such as our selves are) should look upon.
For even that redness or blushing which appears in men's faces upon
consciousness of their infirmities or misdeeds, is but a mask which our souls
do naturally put before them, as being afraid lest others should see the stain
or blemish of sin.

As our first Parents sought to hide themselves from God after they had
transgressed his Commandments: So Offenders hide themselves from his Deputies
or Vicegerents on earth, not only for fear of punishment, but for shame. And if
we should give you the real or physical Definition of shame, It is no other
then the striving of Nature to hide the stain of our souls by sending out blood
into the face or visage. And men do but second this dictate
of Nature, when they put their hands or other covering before their faces. So
Disarius one of the Discoursers in Macrobius (Saturn. lib. 7. cap. 11.) says:
Natura pudore tacta sanguinem ante se pro velamento tendit.

Thus both corrupted nature, and we our selves seek to hide our souls from the
view of others, albeit we cannot discern the inward stain or filth of sin, but
are rather in love with her painted pleasures: But when he shall appear, that
knew no sin in himself, and yet knows all the secrets of man's heart: it is no
vail of flesh, no die of nature, no covering of the visage with blood, that
will avail such as continue to do those things whereof they are or ought to be
ashamed, or which they are afraid that others should see or know. They shall
then desire the Hills for a vail, and the Rocks and Mountains for a covering to
their shame; but in vain, for perpetual darkness shall be their habitation, and
their present shame and confusion of face shall then appear to be the harbinger
or forerunner of death.

CHAP. XIX.
ROMANS 6. 21. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed? etc.
We are many ways engaged to serve God rather then to serve sin, though sin
could afford us as much fruit and reward as God does. But there is no
proportion, no ground of Comparison betwixt the fruits of sin and the Gift of
God. The Case stated betwixt the voluptuous sensual life and the life truly
Christian. Satan's method; And Gods method. A Complaint of the neglect of Grace.

1. THe Scope of our Apostles whole discourse in this Chapter is to deter us
from the service of sin; and by the help of Super-abounding Grace, and Hope of
an exceeding great Reward, both to encourage and engage our best Endeavors unto
the service of God. His Motion or Argument was reasonable, albeit sin (or he
that is the Author of sin) were able to afford us as much fruit, or as full a
recompense, as the service of God does.

There is no man amongst us of this Church, I presume, but does abhor the
Heresy of the Manichees, which was in part this, that we were beholding to
another God for our bodies, then unto Him which made our souls. Yet if their
abominable doctrine were (for disputation sake) supposed as true: We could not
be by any right so engaged unto the service of this imaginary god, as unto the
service of the True God, which made our souls, and does purify them by his
Word and Sacraments. For we are not debtors to the flesh, but unto the God of
the Spirits of all Flesh we are. Debtors indeed unto the only God which made
both our bodies, and souls, and spirits: He may challenge our service by double
right.

First, by the right of Creation; which we had shamefully violated by
alienating Our service is due to God upon several Titles.
our Allegiance unto his Enemy.

Secondly, by right of Redemption; for he that made us all, has redeemed us
all; and if we continue servants unto sin, we do not only violate that ancient
or former Bond which we owed unto him by right of Creation, but that second
Bond, whereby we stand bound unto him by right of redemption. And transgressors
we should be, and most unthankful wretches, if we did not cheerfully and
sincerely betake our selves unto his service, albeit the reward or recompense,
which he has promised and will perform, were but equal to the fruits or
pleasures of sin.

But the truth is, that so far they are from all equality, that there is No
Proportion between them. The wages of sin, are less then nothing, compared to
the reward of righteousness, which is more then all things else that can befall
us.
For not to Be at all, never to have had any Being, were better then to suffer
the death here meant: So that death and life, especially everlasting death and
everlasting life, cannot come into any Balance. That which is worse then
nothing, or not Being (so is everlasting death) cannot be compared with any
thing that is Good, much less with the perfection of goodness (such is
everlasting life) which contains all goodness, whereof we can imagine our
nature to be capable.

2. The only Comparison then must be, between the service of sin and the
service of righteousness, in respect of our present estate, or during the time
of The service of sin and Righteousness compared in regard of this present Life.
this mortal life. And so (if you mark it) our Apostle has Two Motives to
withdraw us from the service of sin; and Two to draw us to the service of
righteousness.

The first Motive to withdraw us from the service of sin, is, that it is
fruitless and shameful for the present.

The First Motive again to sway us unto the service of righteousness, is the
present fruit which we have unto Holiness, and between these two there may be
some Comparison, if we sequester them from the other two, to wit, from life and
death everlasting.

To sequester the service of righteousness altogether from the hope of
everlasting life; or the service of sin altogether from the fear of everlasting
death, is a thing, if not impossible, yet not warrantable, as was showed before
in the tenth Chapter: For those things which God has conjoined man may not
sever. Yet we may so far sever them, as God permitted them to be severed in the
wiser Heathen. The very Heathens felt a kind of Compunction or sting of
conscience upon the commission of grossers sins, which did suggest a See
Chapter the tenth.
kind of tacit fear, but of what evil to come they expressly knew not. They had
again a kind of joy, or Grateful Testimony, or congratulation of spirit or
conscience upon the practice of things honest and comely: And this joy did
kindle a secret hope or encouragement to go forwards in those courses; but it
burst not out into a flame, it wanted the light or guidance of divine truth.
For both this fear and this hope they had without any express hope of
everlasting life, or express fear of everlasting death. However the wiser or
more moderate sort of them did prefer the practice of virtue or such piety as
they knew before the wonted pleasures of this life.

Yet this their greatest Philosophers did not do, without the Contradiction of
such as were given over to bodily pleasures. And this opposition of sensual men
may seem to have some Ground of Reason, even from the Rule of Faith it self, if
we had no more express hopes of everlasting life, or more distinct fear of
everlasting death, then they had.

For shall we not think that the estate of Dives was much better then the
estate of Lazarus in this life, wherein Dives received pleasure, and Lazarus,
pain? Now pleasure is much better then pain; And if such a life as Dives here
led, afforded pleasure, how was it Fruitless, specially in respect of Lazarus
his life, which was full of pain? Indeed in respect of a life so charged with
pain as Lazarus's was, or with such vexations and dangers as the life of Saint
Paul, and other more eminent Saints of God in the primitive Church were: That
Saying of our Apostle is most true; 1 Cor. 15. 19. If in this life only we
have hope in Christ, then are we of all men most miserable. His meaning is,
That if bodily death might have put an unquestionable end to all the
Controversies betwixt him and his persecutors, there had been no gain but loss
rather in the prolongation of his life. But when men truly professing the power
of Christianity may be devout, be religious, be obedient without danger of
persecution, the case is altered. So that our Apostles saying does not concern
the peaceable and prosperous estate of Christians, but the iniquity of those
times and of such Times as those.

3. But we must consider that there is a great deal of difference between
contradicting infidelity, or express denial of the souls immortality or the
Resurrection of the body, and such an implicit or indistinct notion of some
recompense for well-doing, and punishments for ill doings, as the wiser Heathens
did acknowledge. Such of them as constantly acknowledged but thus much, though
not without interposition of some doubting or distrusting fits concerning the
souls imortalitie, without any notion at all of the bodies Resurrection, did
fully accord with our Apostle in this place. That the service of sin, or (to
speak in their language) a voluptuous life, was altogether The emptiness and
vanity of sinful pleasures.
Fruitless. So the Roman Orator tells us. Omnis voluptas pro nihilo putanda est,
quod cum praeterierit perinde sit ac si nulla fuisset. All pleasure is to be
accounted as nothing worth, because when it is once past, it is as if it had
never been; that is, it leaves no fruit behind it: it is at the best but as a
blossom or bud which withers or falls away before the fruit be set: and a
blossom without hope of fruit is altogether fruitless, and of no esteem. Thus
he spoke of Voluptas, that is, of pleasure of the body: but he always
maintained the contrary concerning Gaudium, which we call the pleasure or joy
of the mind, or the inward testimony of a good Conscience. In this Point, the
same Roman Orator (with Seneca and diverse other Heathen Poets and Philosophers)
did accord as well with Solomon, as in the other sentence he did with Saint
Paul, to wit, That a good conscience was a continual Feast. See the tenth
Chapter of this Book. And See Tullie de Finib. Lib. 2. and De Senectute. And
his Paradoxes.

4. But I know what a more dissolute Heathen then Tullie was; or a voluptuous
Christian or carnal Gospeller would at this day object; that they are
acquainted with greater bodily pleasures then the Heathen Philosophers or
precise Christians have experience of; And for this reason will appeal from us
as incompetent Judges. And I confess it is true! A dissolute or voluptuous man
whether Heathen or Christian, oftimes enjoyes for a space, some greater
pleasures of the flesh, then any civil or modest man can do. And this was the
misery or ignorance of the best sort of Heathens (which did excuse them a
Tanto, though not a Toto; that is, in respect of us, not simply) in that they
did not know or suspect an invisible Adversary which deals with us as a
cunning Quacksalver, or crafty Mountebank; one that secretly
corrupts our diet, and by degrees insensible brings many diseases upon us,
That he may gain credit or esteem by giving us some present ease or pleasant
remedy, though never any perfect cure. And yet the Heathen Philospher had
observed, that most of those pleasures of the body or flesh, by which men are
specially drawn from the practice of virtue, or moral honesty, were usually
apprehended, to be much greater then they truly were; both, because most men
look upon their faces or approaches in coming toward them; not upon their
departure or back parts at their going away: and because, they are the remedies
or present abatements of some grievous disease, which it were much better not
to have, then to stand in need of any medicine how pleasant soever.

He that is cured of a deep wound or sore, feels more ease or pleasure when it
grows toward the healing, then he should have done in that part if it had
continued whole. Yet who would long for a wound to find such ease and
contentment?

He that is sick of a burning fever will take more pleasure, for the time
being, in drinking a cup of cold water; then a man in perfect health would do
in a draught of the pleasantest wine. Yet who would choose to be sick to enjoy
such pleasure? There is (I take it) no greater pleasure of any sense then
cooling moisture in the extremity of thirst. But it is a greater misery to be
put unto this need or exigence. So is it with all dissolute or voluptuous men.
Take them for the present, as they are overgrown in dissoluteness and
intemperancie; and it is a great pleasure for them to have their desires
satisfied: But it is a kind of Hell in the mean time to be pestered with such
desires which are always more permanent and more durable then their
satisfactions, or contentments can be. Besides, that the ease and remedies
which for the present they find, do in the issue increase and malignifie the
nature of their disease.

And if they had been once acquainted with the true delight and pleasures of a
moderate and sober life, they would loath their desires as much as a man that
knows what health is, would dislike the momentany pleasures of the sick.

5. That commendation which the Governor of the marriage feast of Gods Method,
and Satan's practice.
Canaa in Galilee did give the Bridegroom, in comparison of ordinary
Inne-keepers or wine-drawers in his time, may serve to set forth the difference
between the service of righteousness, and the service of sin: or between the
the contrary Method which our Lord and master, and the prince of this world
observe in rewarding their followers. Every one (says the Governor of the
feast, John 2. 10.) does at the beginning set forth good wine, and when men
have well drunk then that which is worse. This is the very picture or image of
Satan's practice: But thou (says the same Governor of the feast unto the
Bridegroom) have kept the good wine until now; that is, until the close of the
feast. And this is the Type or Emblem of our Saviors Method.

To apply it more plainly. The Devil still labors to glut men in their best
days with the sweetest pleasures or contentments of the body: and when he
has made them drunk, or brought upon them an unquenchable thirst or longing
after the like, then he vents his ^uffes or refuse upon them, and plyes them
until they drink the very dregs of Gods wrath. But our Savior keeps his best
fruits unto the last, and by his first blessings does but as it were prepare
and qualify our corrupted nature to be every day then other more capable of
better. And as of Satan's malice and mischief, so of his mercy and goodness
there is no end to such as embrace them, until they bring us to an endless and
most blessed life.

The beginnings of sin are always pleasant, at least, sin puts us to no pain
in producing the habit or custom of it, because it is implanted in us by
Holiness bitter in the root or beginning but sweet in the Fruit.
nature. But that which one wittily said of good Arts or learning, is most true
of the service of righteousness. Radices amarae, fructus dulces. The root or
beginning of it is commonly unpleasant, because it cannot be ingrafted into our
corrupted nature, but as it were by incision: but the growth of it is pleasant,
and the fruits to such as are exercised therein, most sweet and wholesome.

This is in effect the very same, that Siracides says, (perhaps himself had
experimented) Ecclus. 4. 17. At the first wisdom will walk with a man by
crooked ways, and bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her
discipline, until she may trust his soul, and try him by her Laws. Then will
she return the straight way unto him, and comfort him, and show him her secrets.

For planting a firm Resolution in us to endeavor the performance of those
duties, whereto our Apostle in this place exhorts us: It is an Excellent motive
which another Heathen Philosopher, Musonius, a Greek, as I take it, commended
See A. Gellius lib. 16. cap. 1.
to his Scholars, (and Cato urged the same to his Soldiers at Numantia:) If
(says he) you bestow your pains in the study of virtue and goodness, the
pains will go away as fast as they come, but the virtue or goodness will abide
with you: But if you take delight or pleasure in that which is evil, the
pleasure will vanish, the evil will habituate it self, and incorporate it self
in your nature, from which it may be more easily repelled, then ejected after
it has taken
possession.

Now to review honest pains or labors past, is a thing grateful to our memory;
a good fruit in it self of labors past, if they were not otherwise fruitful.
But the regretting remembrance of time misspent in the pursuit of fruitless or
unlawful pleasures, is irksome, is tedious, is loathsome, even to corrupted
nature. Thus far and further some of the Heathens did run parallel with our
Apostle in this place. What manner of men then may we think these Philosophers
would have proved as well in practice as speculation; if their speculations had
been seasoned or balanced (as ours are) either with the certain hope of
everlasting life by perseverance in well-doing, or with fear of an everlasting
death for continuance in doing evil? And yet we say that even the best works,
the best endeavors and speculations of these Heathens, were but splendida
peccata, more neat and handsome sins. God grant that most of our own works or
speculations may prove much better.

6. Whilst I compare the industry of these Heathen Philosophers, in employing
those poor Talents which were bestowed upon them, with the sluggish and
decrepit temper of this age, wherein the plentiful revelation of Divine truth,
to them unknown, becomes but barren: methinks the Epigrammatists Case might be
a fit Emblem for the world as it stood affected, whilst civilitie and good
literature were but young, and as it is now disposed, whilst it has all
experience and helps of former ages. The Tenor of the Epigrammatist's complaint
was thus.

Pauper eram juvenis, senio confectus inerti
Sum locuples; misere sort in utraque miser.
Whilst I was young and able to enjoy the contentments which wealth affords,
my fortunes were mean, and my estate but poor: But now wealth is fallen upon me
when I have one foot in the grave, and know no use of it: So that in both ages,
in both Fortunes I am a miserable man.

But why the revelations of Divine Truth are so plentiful in this dull, this
old and sleepie age of the world, which will not make right use of them, when
as they were so rare and scant in those times and Nations which in all humane
probability would have used them much better: this is a depth or Abyssus which
may not be dived into. Only this we are bound to believe in General; that the
only wise immortal God, whose Judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past
finding out, has reasons in themselves most just, though known to himself
alone, why he thus dispenses his blessings: and such reasons as shall appear
not only most just, but most admirable unto us, when we shall know, as we are
known.

7. If in the mean time our Consciences tell us, that we our selves; or common
report informs us, that many of our brethren fall short, not of our calling
only, but even of those Heathers in the knowledge or practice of many Our
fruitlesness in Holiness to be imputed only to our own ill use of the Talent of
Grace given us.
moral duties required of both; let us not make the final Resolution of this
defect into the Eternal and Irresistible Decree, or into the want of means of
Grace for doing either better or less amiss, then we do. For even those
Heathens which had not half the ordinary means, nor any portion of these
special gifts which we have received, did much better then most of us do. Oh
say not! oh think not! That even this want of Grace, or neglect, or ill
employment of those talents which God has given us, are to be imputed either
to Adam's Fall, or our pollution in him. Adam's Fall indeed was the only Cause
why we stood in need of Grace or means extraordinary for our recovery: but
neither His Fall, nor any Preterition of our persons or individuals which have
fallen in him, are either the only or the principal cause, why we are destitute
of that measure of Grace, which is not, but should be in us; or of our present
unbelief or misbelief.

The true Cause of all these, is, Our non-imployment, or misimployment of our
Talent, which we have received in Baptism; or our abuse of that favor or
mercy which God for his part in Baptism sincerely has plighted unto us.

But now that we have not only shamefully broke, but almost perpetually broken
That Vow which we made to God in Baptism, are we in the same estate that Adam
was? Or is this Covenant no better then that which God made with him? Yes: He
had no promise of being renewed by repentance, if he should fall from His first
estate. The first Covenant being once broken was not to be renewed, but a
second to come in its place; And into this Covenant we entered by Baptism. And
though the Sacrament of Baptism or the visible sign of it may not be iterated,
yet the Astipulation or answer of a good conscience to God may and ought to be
renewed, and at no time more fitly or opportunely then at the receiving of the
Sacrament of Christ's body and blood.

One special Use of this Sacrament in the primitive Church (in the times of
persecution) was to resume or ratify the Vow made in Baptism, as appears by
Pliny the second, who had the Christians in Bithynia in examination upon Plin
Epist. lib. 10. Ep. 97.
the meaning or intent of this Sacrament. For the very name of it was
suspicious to the Roman State. And that very Preparation which is required of
all which mean to be partakers of the Sacrament may be reduced to these Three
Heads.

First, To arraign, accuse and judge our selves, for our former frequent
neglect of our Vow in Baptism.

Secondly, To request Absolution and pardon of God, which no man humbly Three
Heads of preparation to the holy Sacrament.
and seriously does, but he solemnly promises amendment of what is past.

Thirdly, To implore the special aid or assistance of Gods Spirit for better
performance of our Vow and of what we now promise. And all this only for the
merits of Christ, and through the efficacy of his Body and Blood. I will
conclude with that of the Psalmist. Vovete, and vota reddite Jehovae.

1. DEath and life have the same Seat and Subject. Nothing dies unless it
first live: and Death in the General is An Extinction of life. Death in
Scripture is two Ways taken.

First, For bodily Death, which is the First Death.

Secondly, For the Death of both Body and Soul, which is called the Second
Death.

Both are here literally meant, both are the wages of sin.

The former Death is common to all; excepting such of the Godly as shall be
found alive at Christ's coming to Judgment; they shall not die but be changed.

First then of bodily death; and secondly of supernatural or the second death,
Of Bodily Death or the First Death.
and wherein it exceeds the first death.

The Opposition between Bodily Death and Bodily Life is merely Privative; such
as is between light and darkness, or between sight and blindness. And this
death must be distinguished according to the degrees of life of which it is the
Privation.

Of life the degrees be three. The First of mere Vegetables, as of trees, of
plants, of herbs, or whatsoever is capable of growth or nourishment. The Second
is of Creatures endued with sense. The third is the life of man, who besides
sense, is endued with reason. The reasonable life includes the sensitive, as
the sensitive does the life vegetable. Whatsoever bodily creature is endowed
with reason is likewise endowed with sense. But many things which are endowed
with sense are incapable of reason. And again, what Creature soever it be which
is partaker of the life sensitive, is partaker likewise of Vegetation, of
growth or nourishment. But many things which are nourished and grow, as trees,
herbs, plants, grass and corn, are incapable of the life sensitive; and yet
even these are said to die, as they properly do when their nutriment fails. But
albeit the first beginning of man's life in the womb be only vegetative, not
sensible or reasonable, yet no man dies according to this kind of death only.
For such as fall into an Atrophie (which is a kind of death or privation of the
nutritive faculty;) yet are they not to be accounted as dead so long as they
have the use of any sense, no nor after they be deprived of all outward senses:
so long as their hearts do move, or their lungs send out breath. So that the
bodily death of man includes a privation of sense and motion. This difference
again may be observed in the degrees of bodily death.

2. Trees and vegetables always die without pain, so do not man and beast. For
that both of them are endowed with sense and motion, both of them are capable
of pain. And pain if it be continued and extreme draws sensitive death after
it. Nor can this death approach or find entrance into the seat of life but by
pain. And in as much as this kind of life is sweet, death which is the
deprivation of it, is always unpleasant and terrible unto man; not only in
respect of the pain which ushers it in, but in respect of the loss of vital
sweetness which it brings with it. The pains of dying may be as great in beasts
as in man; so is not the loss of that goodness which is contained in life; for
reasonless creatures perceive it not. A memory they have of pains past, a
sense or feeling of pains present, and a fear of death, when it approaches.
But no forethought or reckoning of what follows after death. This is proper
to the reasonable creature. Now this Forethought of what may follow after,
makes death more bitter to man, then it can be to reasonless creatures. And
amongst men, the more or greater the contentments of life have been, and the
better they are provided for the continual supply of such contentments, the
more grievous is the conceit or forethought of death natural unto them. The
summons of death are usually more unwelcome to a man in perfect health, then to
a crased body. So it is to a man of wealth and credit, more then to one of a
forlorn estate or broken fortunes. So
says Ecclesiasticus, Chap. 41. 1. O death! how bitter is the remembrance of
thee to a man that lives at rest in his Possessions? unto the man that has
nothing to vex him, and that has prosperity in all things? yea, unto him that
is yet able to receive meat?

Yet is not the loss of life, of sense, or the foregoing of worldly
contentments the only cause why men naturally fear death. For though it deprive
them of all these, yet does not the death of man consist in this deprivation.
The body loses all these by the divorce which death makes betwixt it and the
soul. But seeing the substance of the soul still remains: the greatest fear
which can possess a natural man, is the future doubtful estate of the soul
after this dissolution. Many which never hoped or expected any Reunion or
second marriage between the soul and body, after death had once divorced them,
had yet a true Notion that the soul did not die with the body: and out of this
conceit some were more afraid of death then any brutish or reasonless creature
can be.

Some other few became as desirous of it, as Prisoners, which hope to escape,
are of a Gaol deliverie; and thought it a great freedom (especially in their
discontented Desire of death or self Homicide
melancholy passion) to have the keys of this mortal prison in their own
keeping, to be able to let their souls and life out at their pleasure. But
though it be universally true, that the corruptible body during the time of
this life, is but a walking prison, or moveable Cage unto the immortal soul;
yet the soul being long accustomed to this prison, does naturally choose to
continue in it still, rather then to be uncertain, whither to repair after it
go hence.

That some Heathens have taken upon them to let their souls out of their bodies
before the time appointed by course of nature, or doom given upon them by their
supreme Judge: This was but such a delusion of Satan, as one man sometimes in
malice puts upon another. For so oftimes a secret enemy or false friend has
persuaded others to break the prison whereto they were upon presumption rather
then on evidence of any notorious fact committed,
to make them by this means unquestionably liable unto the punishment of death,
which without such an escape they might have escaped. For any man wittingly and
willingly to separate the soul and body which God has joined, is A damnable
presumption, an usurpation of Gods own office or Authority.

To solicit or sue for a divorce betwixt them is not safe for any, save only
for such as have Good Assurance or probable hopes, that when they are dissolved
they shall be with Christ. Now the souls of such as die in him, have no desire
to return unto the former prison of the body. But such as have not in this life
been espoused unto him, would choose rather to remain in, or to return unto,
their former prison, then to be held in custody by their spiritual enemies.
Their estate for the present is worse then the sufferance of bodily death:
being charged, both with perpetual sufferance, and expectation to suffer the
second death.

3. And this death differs more from the First death then inter numerandum; Of
the second Death wherein it exceeds the First.
that is, more then in order of account, or rank of place. What then is not the
second death a privation of life? Yes; it is all this, and somewhat more
besides. Every vice includes a privation of the contrary virtue, and is a great
deal worse then want of virtue. So every sickness includes a privation of some
branch of health, and is much worse then a Neutralitie, or middle temper (if
any such there be) between health and sickness. So does the Second death
include an extreme contrariety to life and all the contentments of it.
Blindness is a mere privation of sight; and the eye which cannot see is dead in
respect of this branch of life, and this death or deprivation of this sense is
only matter of loss. The eye or subject of sight (oft-times) after the loss of
sight, suffers no pain; no more does the ear after it becomes deaf: nor the
sense of feeling after it be numm'd. A man stricken with the palsy feels no
smart in that part which it possesses. Whilst any part of our body is
sensible of pain, it is an argument that it is yet alive, not quite dead: And
yet is all pain rather a branch of death, then of life. For much better it were
to die the first death then to live continually in deadly pain. No man but
would be willing to loose a tooth, rather then to have it perpetually tormented
with the toothache. Now the second death is no other then a perpetual living
unto deadly pain or torture.

Bodily death, or not being, is not so much worse then life natural with all
its contentments, as the second death is worse then the First, or the bodily
pains which can accompany it. The parts or branches of the first death are
altogether as many as the parts of life natural. The seat or subject of the
second death is larger. There is no member of the body or faculty of the soul,
whether sensitive or rational, which becomes not the seat or subject of the
second death. As this death is the wages of sin, so it is for Extention
commensurable unto the body of sin. Now there is no part or faculty in man
which in this life has been free from sin: And whatsoever part or faculty
has in this life been polluted with sin, becomes the seat and dwelling place
of the second death: Wheresoever sin did enter, it did enter but as an
Harbinger to take up so many several Rooms for that death. Who is he that can
say, that lust has not sometimes entered in at the eye? that the seeds of lust,
of Envy, of murder,
and of other sins have not taken possession of the ear; that his tongue or
taste has not given entertainment to riot gluttony and excess in meat and
drink? That his sense of smell has not been sometimes a pander to these and
the like Exorbitances? And the other fifth or gross sense of Touch is as the
common bed of sin; for it spreads it self throughout all the rest, and is the
foundation of every other external sense.

4. To give you then a true map of the second death, and more then a Map of it,
or of their estate that are subject unto it, we cannot exhibit. The Map with
the true scale for measuring the Region of death with the miserable estate of
its inhabitants, is thus.

Nature and common Experience afford us These general un-erring Rules.

That, all pain and grief are improved by one of these two means; or by A
double Reason of the vehemence of pain or torment in the second death.
both.

As First, by enlarging the capacity of every sense or faculty which is
capable of pain or discontent. Secondly, by the vehemence or violence of the
object or agent which makes the impression upon the passive sense or capacity.

One and the same Agent, as well for quality, as for intention of its active
force, does not make the same impression upon different subjects though both
capable of impression. As one and the same flame and steam of fire has not one
and the same effect on iron, steel, and wax; though all of them be in the same
distance from it. Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis: How
powerful soever any Agent be, the Patient can receive or retein no more of its
power then it is capable of. Again; how capable soever the Patient be of any
violent impression: yet the capacity of it, is not filled unless the force of
the Agent be proportionable unto it. And though it be able to receive never so
much; yet it is true again, Nihil dat quod non habet, nec plus dat quam habet:
No creature, no Agent whatsoever, can bestow any greater measure whether of
good or evil, whether of pain or pleasure, then is contained within the sphere
of its activitie.

From these unquestionable Principles this Universal Conclusion will
undoubtedly follow: That all excess, or full measure of pain, of grief, or
woe, of every branch of malum poenae, must amount from the improved capacity
of the sense or faculty, which receives impression, and from the strength and
potencie of the Object which makes the impression.

5. There is no humane body which is not by nature capable of the Gout; yet
such as are accustomed to courser fare, to moderate diet, and hard labor, are
less capable of this disease then such as cherish and pamper the sense of
taste and touching. What is the reason? Daintiness of diet improves the
capacity of the sense of feeling, and makes it more tender, and so more apt to
receive the impression of noisome humors, and the same daintiness or excess of
delicate fare, is more apt and forcible to breed plenty of forcible and
peircing humors, then courser fare or moderate diet is. For the same reason,
he, whose sense of smelling, or taste, is by natural disposition of Body or by
accustomance, more subtle or accurate, will be more offended with loathsome
smells and nastie food, then he which has the same senses, by a natural
disposition, more dull, or more dis-used from delicate odours, or dainty
meats. And a musical ear accustomed to melodious consorts, will be more
displeased with jarring or discording sounds, then he which has the same sense
of hearing unpolished by Art, or accustomed to ruder noises. The more accurate
a man's sight is by natural disposition, or the more insight a man has in the
Art of limning or painting, or the more accustomed he is to view fresh colors
and proportions, the more impatient he is to behold unsightly Objects or
deformed prospects. And according to the increase of unsightliness or ugliness
in the object, his offense, or grief does still grow and increase. The Rule
then is general, That the discontent, the grief or pain of every one of the
five outward senses, still accrues from the capacity or aptitude of the sense
to receive ungrateful impressions: And from the potencie or efficacy of the
Agent to make such impressions.

The same Rule holds as true in our internal faculties or senses. A man by
natural disposition of immoderate appetite for meat and drink is far more
tormented with the same want of them, then a moderate or less greedy appetite
is. And this sense, which is none of the five, has this peculiar property,
that it is tormented with its own Capacity, without any agent or object to
inflict pain upon it. The mere want of food is more grievous to it, then any
positive pain that can befall it, by any external Agents.

To a man (again) of a curious Fancy or accurate Judgment, an ignorant or
slovenly discourse, is more unpleasant, then to an illiterate man; or to one of
duller capacity for wit.

To an ambitious or popular man, the least touch of dis-esteem or jealousy of
dis-respect, is more bitter then an open affront or disgrace unto an honest
upright heart which looks no way but one, to that which leads to truth and
honesty. And he that labors to improve this appetite of honor or popular
esteem, does but solicit the multiplication of his own woes. For seeing Honor
est in Honorante, honor is seated in them that do the honor, not in them that
are honored; seeing popular applause depends upon the breath of the multitude;
the man that sets his mind upon it, does but as one that exposes his naked
body to the lash or scourge, or at the best to others courtesy. A man that
much minds his gain, and has his senses exercised in cunning bargainings,
takes the loss of opportunity or fair advantage to increase his wealth, more
deeply to heart, then another man whose mind is weaned from the world does his
very want or penury. So that, though the want or loss of the one be much
greater then the others: yet the Capacity of his appetite or desire of gain is
much less, and therefore no way so apt to receive the impression of
coffeehouse or grief from the same occurrences or occasions which torment
the other.

6. Now to put all these together; Let us suppose one and the same man to be
immoderately desirous of worldly honors and riches: And by this means of an
extraordinary Capacity for receiving all those parts of grief or sorrow, which
can accrue from loss of goods, from contempt, disgrace and scorn; and yet
withal, as capable of, and as much inclined to, all the pleasures of bodily
senses, whereby his Capacity of pain or torture may be improved to the
uttermost. Let us also suppose or imagine the same man to be daily exposed to
all the temptations, to all the vexations that his bodily senses or internal
faculties are capable of, from the occurrences or impressions of objects most
ungrateful; as to be daily cheated, daily disgraced, to have his eyes filled
with ghastly sights, his ears with hideous noises, his smell cloyed with
loathsome savours, and his taste vexed with bitter and unpleasant meats, or
rather poison which cannot be digested; and his sense of touch daily infested
with deadly pain; his appetite of meat and drink daily tormented with hunger
and thirst:
And from a man in this woeful estate and piteous plight, we may take the
surface or first dimension of the second death, but not the Thickness or
Soliditie of it.

That we must gather thus; first by Negatives. How capable soever a man's bodily
senses may be of pain or pleasure, or his internal faculties of joy or sorrow:
yet it is Generally true in this life; Vehemens sensibile corrumpit sensum: The
vehemency or excessive strength of the Agent or sensible Object does corrupt
or dead the sense. Huge noises, though in their nature not hideous, or for
quality not displeasing, will breed a deafness in the ear. And though light be
the most grateful object that the eye can behold: yet the too much gazing upon
it, or the admission of too much of it into the eye will strike it with
blindness. Long accustomance unto dainty meats does dull the taste and take
away the appetite. Likewise too much cold, or too much heat, does either
dissolve or benumme the sense of feeling: and a man may loose not the smelling
only, but even the common sense, or Animal Faculty by strong perfumes, much
more by loathsome and abominable smells. There is not one of the five outward
senses, but if its proper object be too violent, or too vehement, may let in
death to all the rest. A man may be killed without a wound; either at the eye,
or at the ear; at the nose, or at the mouth: so he may be by the sense of
hunger or thirst, without any weapon or poison, only by mere want of food. The
Gangrene (or other like disease which works only upon the sense of touch or
feeling) brings many to an end without any foreign enemy. Some have died a
miserable death by close imprisonment in a nastie prison, without violence to
any other sense save only to the sense of smelling. Many have died of surfets,
though of delicate, and in their kind, wholesome meats. Regulus that famous
Roman Senator did die as miserable a death, as his enemies could devise
against him, without any other instrument of cruelty, besides the force or
strength of the most grateful object, which the eye can behold; that is, of the
sun: unto whose splendent beams his eyes were exposed without the mask or
shelter of his ey lids, which his cruel enemies (for increasing his pain and
lingering torture) had cut off.

Others again, which wanted no contentment either of the outward or internal
senses, have died through mere grief and sorrow, first conceived, either from
loss of goods or friends; or for fear of disgrace and shame; and some through
excessive and sudden joy. So that in this life, it is universally true, and
undoubtedly experienced in all the bodily senses; and most other faculties of
the soul: Nullum violentum est Perpetuum. There is no grief, no pain or sorrow,
whether inflicted by external Agents; or whether it breeds within us, or be
hatched by the reflection of our own thoughts upon others wrongs, or our own
oversights or misdeeds; but if it be violent, or excessive, it becomes like a
raging flame, which both devours the subject whereon it exercises its
efficacy, and puts an end to its own Being, by destroying that fuel which fed
it.

7. This then is the property of the second death, and the miserable condition
of such as must receive the wages of sin; That after the Resurrection The
duration or Eternity of the second death and pains of it.
of the body; the capacity, as well of the bodily senses, as of other
faculties, are so far improved, so far enlarged; that no extremity of any
external Agent, no virulency of any disease which breeds within them, no
strength of imagination or Reflection upon what they have in time past
foolishly done, or what they suffer for the present, or may justly fear
hereafter, can either dissolve or weaken their passive capacities or strength
to endure the like. Every faculty becomes more durable then an Anvil to
receive all the blows that can be fastened upon them, and all the impressions
how violent soever which in this life would in an instant dissolve or dead
them. So that the second death, as is said before, is a life or vivacitie
continually to sustain deadly pains.

The Dimensions of this death may be deduced to these three heads.

First to the intensiveness of the pain or grief, which is more extreme then
any man in this life can suffer, because the capacities of every sense or
passive faculty are in a manner infinitely enlarged; and so is the strength or
violence of external Agents, and the sting of conscience or perplexed thoughts
wonderfully increased.

Secondly, to the duration of all those punishments, for it is a death
everlasting.

Lastly to the uncessant perpetuity of these everlasting pains; for they are
not inflicted by fits, but without all intermission though but for a moment.
There is not an ill day and a good, not an ill hour and a good, not an ill
minute and a good, not an ill moment and a good, in hell; All times are
extremely evil; variety of torments breed no ease. Thus much appeared by the
Parable of the rich glutton, who could not obtain so much of Abraham as a drop
of water to cool his tongue; which if it had been granted could not have
effected any intermission or intercision of pain, nor any abatement, for the
present, which would not have enraged the flame as much in the next moment. So
that such as suffer the second death know not how to ask any thing for their
good, because indeed nothing can do them any good, but all things, even their
own wishes conspire unto their harm, and increase their woe and misery.

8. Some, taking occasion from this Parable have moved a question, not much
necessary; whether the fire of hell be material fire or no; that is, such as
may palpably or visibly scorch the body, and torment the outward senses.
Sometimes this fire is described by a flame, as in the Parable of the rich
glutton; sometimes by the blackness of darkness, as in Saint Jude. It is not
the flame or visibilitie of this fire which argues it to be material; the flame
is least material in our fire. And palpable it may be, though not visible; But
with this question I will not meddle, being impossible to be determined without
sight or experience, which God grant we never have. It shall suffice therefore
in brief to show, how this fire, or rather the pains of the second death are
decyphered or displayed in Scripture.

Now, As the joys of Heaven are set forth unto us under such Emblemes or
representations, as are visible or known unto us; and yet we do not believe
that they are formally or properly such as these shadows or pictures represent,
but rather eminently contain the greatest joys that by these representations
we can conceive or imagine: So we are bound to believe, That the pains of Hell,
are at least, either properly and formally such as the Scripture describes See
M Mede, on Pro. 21. 16 of the valley of Rephaim.
them to be, or more extreme and violent, then if they were such as the
characters which the holy Ghost has put upon them, do without Metaphor import
or signify. More extreme they are then flesh and blood in this life could
endure for a minute; For as flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of
Heaven: so neither can they endure or inherit the kingdom of Satan: there must
be a change of this corruptible nature before it be capable of these
everlasting pains. So much the description of it in holy Scripture does import.

The first, and that a Terrible description of it, is, Esai. 30. 33. Tophet is
ordained of old, yea for the King it is prepared; the pile thereof is fire and
much (...), the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone does kindle it.
The like, but more terrible has Saint John, Rev. 20. 10. The Devil that
deceived them was cast into the Lake of fire and brimstone, where the Beast and
the false Prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever:
and as he adds ver. 14. This lake of fire is the second death. And Saint Jude
tells us that, The destruction, of Sodom and Gommorrah, and the cities about
them, is set forth as an example, or type of this eternal fire; that is, such
fearful torments as that people suffered for a moment, the damned shall suffer
in hell eternally. The ruins of Sodom and Gomorah, and the dead sea or
brimstone Lake, wherein, neither fish nor other creature lives, was left unto
all future ages, to serve as a map or picture of that lake of fire and
brimstone which Saint John mentions, that is, of Hell. Now the very steam of
such a Lake would stifle or torment flesh and blood to death in a moment; the
outward senses are not capable of its first impressions.

9. Some Schoolmen have moved A more pertinent Question, whether this
punishment of sense (which (or the instrumental mean of which) is thus
described unto us, by a Lake of fire and brimstone) be greater or less then
the Poena damni; that is, Whether their imprisonment or confinement to Hell,
and their subjection to tormenting Fiends, be worse then their Exclusion out of
Heaven, and the perpetual loss of Gods joyful presence. The most Resolve; That
Poena damni, the loss of Gods presence is of the two, the worse. And certain it
is, that it cannot be less; seeing, that, Everlasting Life, which is The Gift
of God, and Crown of holiness, is, at the least, so much better, as the second
death or pains of hell are worse, then this mortal life. But, if I mistake not,
the Members of this Distinction concerning the punishment Poena damni and
Sensus Terms subordinate.
of loss, and the punishment of sense by pain, are not altogether Opposite,
but Co-incident, The very conceit or remembrance of this infinite loss, and of
their folly in procuring it, cannot but breed an insufferable measure of grief
and sorrow unto the damned, which will be fully equivalent to all their bodily
pain. And this fretting remembrance, and perpetual reflection upon the folly of
their former ways, is, as I take it, That Worm of Conscience that never dies.
But of this hereafter.

The miserable estate of the damned, or such as shall suffer the second death,
may be reduced to these two Heads: to Punishment Essential, or to Punishment
Accidental or concomitant. The Essential Punishment comprehends both Poena
damni, and Poena sensus: The positive pains of that brimstone Lake, and the
Worm of Conscience which gnaweth upon their souls. The Punishment Accidental or
concomitant, is that Loathsomeness of the Region or place wherein they are
tormented, and of their Companions in these torments.

In this life, that Saying is generally true:

Solamen miseris Socios habuisse doloris. it is always some comfort to have
Consorts in our pain or distress. But this Saying is out of date in the Region
of death; the more there be that suffer these pains, the less comfort there is
to every one in particular. For there is no concord or consort, but perpetual
discord, which is always so much greater, by how much the parties discording
are more in number: And to live in continual discord, though with but some few,
is a kind of Hell on earth. And thus much in brief of the second death, wherein
it exceeds the First.

10. If any one that shall read this should but suspect or fear that God had
inevitably ordained him unto this death, or created him to no better end then
to the day of wrath: This very cogitation could not but much abate his
love toward God, Whom no man can truly love, unless he be first persuaded,
That God is good and loving, not toward his Elect only, but toward all men,
toward himself in particular. But this opinion of Absolute Reprobation, or
ordination to the day of wrath, I pray may never enter into any man's brains.

But flesh and blood, though not polluted with this Opinion, will, if not
repine and murmur, yet perhaps demur a while upon another Point more
questionable, to wit; How it may stand with the Justice of the most righteous
Judge to recompense the pleasures of sin in this life, which is but short, with
such exquisite and everlasting torments in the life to come: Specially seeing
the pleasures of sin are but transient, neither enjoyed nor pursued but by
interposed Fits, whereas the torments of that Lake are uncessantly perpetual,
and admit no intermission.

The usual Answer to this Quaere is: That every sin deserves a punishment
infinite, as being committed against an infinite Majesty. But seeing this
answer has no Ground or warrant from the Rule of Faith, in which neither the
Maxim it self is expressly contained, nor can it be deduced thence by any good
Consequence; we may examine it by the Rule of Reason. Now by the Rule of Reason
and proportion, the punishment due to offenses as committed against an infinite
Majesty; should not be punishment infinite for time and duration, but infinite
for quality or extremity of pain whiles it continues. If every minute of
sinful pleasures in this world should be recompensed with a thousand years of
Hell-pains, this might seem rigorous and harsh to be conceived of him, that is,
as infinite in Goodness as in Greatness, as full of Mercy as of Majesty. But
whatsoever our thoughts or ways be, his ways we know are equal and just; most
equal, not in themselves only, but even unto such as in sobriety of spirit
consider them.

But wherein does the equality of his ways or justice appear, when he
recompenceth the momentany pleasures of sin with such unspeakable everlasting
torments? It appears in this: That he sentenceth no creatures unto such
endless pains, but only such as he had first ordained unto an endless life:
so much See Chap. 4: 15: And Attrib: 1: part: p: 219. and 2 part: p: 27.
better at least then this bodily and mortal life, as the second death is worse
then it. Adam had an immortal life (as a pledge or earnest of an eternal life)
in possession; and had not lost it either for himself or us, if he had not
wilfully declined unto the ways of death, of which the righteous Judge had
forewarned him. Now when life and death are so set before us, as that Hold is
given us of life; to recompense the wilful choice of death with death it self,
this is most equal and just. And if the righteous Lord had sentenced our first
Parents unto the second death immediately upon their first transgression, his
sentence had been but just and equal; their destruction had been from
themselves. Yet, as all this had been no more then just, so it had been less
then justice moderated, or rather overruled by mercy. Now instead of
executing justice upon our first Parents, the righteous Lord did immediately
promise a gracious redemption: and as one of the Ancients said, Foelix peccatum
quod talem meruit Redemptorem, it was a happy sin which gave occasion of the
promise of such a Redeemer.

11. But did this extraordinary mercy promised to Adam extend it self to all?
or to Adam only? or to some few that should proceed from him? Our public
Liturgy, our Articles of Religion, and other Acts of our Church, extend it See
Chapt: 4 12.
to Adam and to all that came after him. But how the Nations whom God as yet
has not called unto the light of his Gospel, or whose fore-elders he did not
call unto the knowledge of his Laws given unto Israel; how either Fathers or
Children came to forsake the mercies wherein the whole humane nature in our
first Parents was interested, is, A Secret known to God, and not fit to be
disputed in particular. This we are sure of in the General, That God did not
forsake them, till they had forsaken their own mercies. But for our selves; All
of us have been by Baptism re-ordained unto a better estate then Adam lost:
Now, if upon our first, second, third, or fourth open breach or wilful contempt
of our Vow in Baptism, the Lord had sentenced us unto everlasting death, or
given Satan a Commission or warrant to pay us the wages of sin, this had been
but just and right; his ways in this, had been equal, because our ways were
so unequal. But now he has so long time spared us, and given us so large a
time of repentance, seeking to win us unto his love by many blessings and
favors bestowed upon us: This (as the Apostle speaks) is the riches of his
bounty; certainly exceeding great mercy, much greater then justice; even mercy
triumphing against judgment. Now if after all this, we shall continue to
provoke him, and defer our repentance, turning his Grace into wantonness,
making the plentifulness of his word the nurse and fuel of Schism and faction,
no judgment can be too great, no pain too grievous, either for Quality or for
Continuance.

12. The Doctrine of such Catechists as would persuade or occasion men
Possibility repentance.
to suspect, that God has not yet mercy in store, or that there is no
possibility for all that hear the word, to repent, to believe, and be saved;
whatsoever it do to the Authors and followers of it in this life, it shall in
the life to come appear even to such as perish to have been erroneons. For, one
special branch of their punishment, and that wherein the punishment of such as
hear the word and repent not, does specially exceed the punishment of the
Heathen or infidels, shall be their continual cogitation, how possible it was
for them to have repented: How possible for them? how much more possible for
them then for infidels to have been saved. The bodily pains of Hell fire shall
be (as is probable) equal to all; but the worm of Conscience, which is no other
then Worm of conscience.
the reflection of their thoughts upon their madness in following the pleasures
of sin, and neglecting the promises of Grace, shall be more grievous to
impenitent Christians.

A true Scale or scantling of these torments we may take from the consideration
how apt we are to grieve at our extraordinary folly or Retchlesness in this
life; whether that have turned to the prejudice of our temporal estate, of our
health, or bodily life, of our credit or good name. There is not a man on earth
but if he would enter into his own heart, might find that he had many times
committed greater folly then Esau did, when he sold his Birthright for a mess
of pottage. He set his Birthright (that is his Interest in the Land of Canaan)
on sale, without the hazard of that inheritance which God had elsewhere provided
for him; for he became Lord of Mount Seir. He did not contract for his own
imprisonment or captivity: but we daily set Heaven to sale, and hazard our
everlasting exclusion from Gods presence, for toys less worth, at least less
necessary for us, then bodily meat was for Esau in his hunger. And yet by such
foolish bargains we enter a Covenant with death, and contract, (though not
expressly, yet implicitly) for an everlasting inheritance in Hell. Now unto
such as thus live and die without repentance, the most cruel torments that can
be imagined, cannot be so grievous, as the continual cogitation, how they did
bind themselves (without any necessity laid upon them) to receive the wages of
sin, by receiving such base earnest as in this life was given them.

13. A more exact Scale of the reward for this their folly; we have in Two
Fictions of the Heathen, The one is That of Sisyphus his uncessant labor, in
rolling a huge stone, which still turns upon him with greater force. The other
is of Prometheus, whose Liver (as they imagined) was continually gnawen upon by
a vultur or Cormorant without wasting the substance of it, or deading its
capacity of pain. The continual reflection, of such as perish, upon their
former folly, is as the rolling of Sisyphus's stone, a grievous labor, a
perpetual torment, still resumed by them, but still more and more in vain; for
no sorrow brings forth repentance there. And every such Reflection or
Revolution of their thoughts upon their former ways, is The gnawing of the
worm of Conscience, more grievous by much unto their souls, then if a vultur
should so continually gnaw their hearts.

CHAP. XXI.
ROMANS 6. 22. 23. But now ye have your fruit unto Holiness, and the end
everlasting life.

The Gift of God is Eternal Life through Jesus Christ our Lord.


Eternal Life Compared with this present Life: The several Tenures of Both. The
method proposed: The instabilitie of this present Life. The contentments of it
short: and the capacities of man, to enjoy such contentments as this life
affords, narrower. In the life to come the capacity of every faculty shall be
enlarged, some senses shall receive their former contentments only Eminenter;
as if one should receive the weight in Gold for dross. Some Formaliter. Joy
Essential and Joy Accidental.

1. THe Point remaining is, that, This Eternal Life which is the Crown of
Holiness, is so much better then this present life, and its best contentments,
as the second death is worse then this present life, however taken at the best
or worst. Now both sorts of life and death may be compared either in respect of
their proper quality or of their Duration. That, in respect of Duration or
continuance, this good and happy life, which is the Crown of Holiness, and that
miserable death, which is the wages of sin, are equal, no Christian may deny,
may suspect; for both are endless. That this life was endless, that such as are
once possessed of it, shall never be dispossessed of it, even Origin and his
followers did never question, who not withstanding did deny, that this death
which was opposed unto it was absolutely endless, though in Scripture often
said to be everlasting: For That in their interpretation was no more then to be
of exceeding long continuance. But this Heresy has been long buried in the
Church; and his sin be upon him that shall seek to revive it.

The Method then which we mean to observe is this:

First to set forth the excellency of everlasting life in respect of this life
present.

Secondly to unfold the Reasons, why neither the hope of everlasting life, nor
the fear of an endless miserable death do sway so much with most Christians, as
in reason they ought, either for deterring them from the fruitless service of
sin, or for encouraging them to proceed in holy and godly courses, whose end is
everlasting life. In this later we shall take occasion to unfold the Fallacies
or Sophisms which Satan in his temptations puts upon us, with some brief rules
or directions how to avoid them. A work questionless of much use and fruit,
though handled by a few, either so seriously or so largely as the matter
requires.

In comparing this life with the life to come, we are in the first place to set
forth the different Tenures of them. Secondly, to compare the several joys or
contentments.

2. This present life even at the best is in comparison but a kind of death.
For as the Heathen Philosopher had observed, it is always in fluxu, like a
stream or current, it runs as fast from us as it comes unto us. That part of
our life which is past (says Seneca) is, as it were, resigned up to death;
That part which is yet to come, is not yet ours, nor can we make any sure
reckoning of it. That part which we account as present, is equally divided
between death and us: Not unconsonantly to that of David, Psalm 103. 15. The
days of man are but as grass; He flourishes as a Flour of the Field. As soon
as the wind goes over it, it is gone, etc. Or to that of Job; Man that is born
of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble: he comes forth like a flower,
and is cut down, he flees also as a shadow and continues not. The Addition or
Comment upon this, in our Liturgy, is, That in the midst of life we be in
death; that is, we die as fast as we live. The first part of our life is the
beginning of our death; and death it self differs from life, but as the Point
does from the Line which it terminates, or as the line does from the surface,
or the surface from the body whose surface it is. Mors ultima line a rerum est.
The whole course of our life is full of interpunctions, or Commaes; death is
but the Period or full point.

Take it at the very best, it is in respect of true life or steadfast Being, but
as the Reflex or Image of a star in a flowing stream. The seat or subject of
life does not continue the same it was, no not for a moment; it is but one by
continuation, or fresh supply of the like; As an Army is said to be the same
which consists of the like number of men, though most of the Commanders Coel
Rodigin. lib. 8. cap. 2. and lib. 25. cap. 1
and Soldiers of the first levy be slain. So Darius the Persian had a Legion
which they called Immortal; because it was continually supplied with the like
number of new Soldiers, when the old ones failed. For the same reason, some
have compared the life of man unto a Lamp, which burns so long as it has
supply of oil, but is presently extinguished when the oil does fail. And indeed
as the oil and light is to the Lamp, wherein the one is contained, the other
shines; so is the natural heat and moisture unto the soul, especially as to
life sensitive. But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, our
souls shall then be in our glorified bodies, as light is in the stars, in their
proper sphere. Our life shall be one and the same, not by continuation or
succession of bodily parts. So as this first life, and that other life which we
expect, differ for their Tenure and manner, as the representation or figure of
the Sun in the water, and the Sun in its sphere. The Tenure of the one is
fluent and transitory, The Tenure of the other is solid and permanent. And
proportionable to this difference of their Tenures or durations, are the
different joys or contentments. If all the possible contentments in this life
(suppose they were far more in number then they are) were put together, they
could not equalize the Contentments of one minute in the life to come. The
unsatisfaction of our desires in the Contentments of this present life.


3. Our desires in this life are vast, and our capacities to enjoy the good of
what we desire but narrow and slender. They consort no better than a decrepit
gluttons eye or appetite with his digestive faculty. Now it is a misery to
have vast or strong desires, and not to be able to give them satisfaction; most
miserable to take those courses which exclude them from possibility of
satisfaction. Hence an Heathen Philosopher took the want or Emptiness of this
misery to be the complete Sphere of true happiness: and out of this conceit
defined a happy man, briefly this: Beatus est qui vivit ut vult: He is happy or
blessed which has all the contentments that he desires or wishes. But, St.
Austine tells us that another Heathen (whom he names not, but whose saying he
often applauds) corrected this Definition thus; Beatus est qui vivit ut vult,
modo nihil velit quod non debet: He is a happy man that See Book 10. Chap. 17.
has all that he desires; so he desire nothing but what he ought to desire.
And certain it is, that the former Definition without this Correction, comes
far short of that true happiness, which is contained in everlasting life, or
which all men by nature confusedly desire. For a man in this life may have
every thing which in this life his heart desires, and yet not have his hearts
desire. The hearts desire is True Happiness.
This no man can have in this life: nor does the mere natural man find the way
or entrance to it. See Christ's Answer to John's Disciples. page 17.

Solomon had tried as great variety of particular contentments as any man
living can project unto himself: and yet after long experience of every
particular that he could propose unto himself, gives up this general verdict,
Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, and vexation of mind. Yet is this vanity
seated in the unsettled and fluctuant desires of man; not in the things
themselves which he desires; for these have their right Use, so they be
referred to their proper End, which is no other then true happiness; and no man
can have his hearts desire until his heart do pitch and settle on this, as its
Center.

Hence some would Define True happiness to be Plenitudo desideriorum: the full
satisfaction of our desires. This all seek after without cessation; and some
print, some Sent or relish of it, we find in most desires of it. Somewhat
there is in the right use of every Creature, which would lead us the right way
unto it, did we not run Counter, striving to make up a full measure of joy by
the abundant fruition of these materials wherein we delight. Whereas the
delight and contentment which we find in any Creatures should turn our thoughts
from them unto the inexhaustible fountain whence all the goodness that we find
in them or in our selves, is derived. The nearer we draw to him, the nearer we
are to true happiness: truly happy we cannot be until we enjoy his presence.
Irrequietum est cor nostrum ad te Domine, donec quiescat in te. Our hearts are
restless in the pursuit of happiness, until they rest in thee, O Lord.

4. The first step to happiness which we can make, is, to be persuaded, That
true happiness cannot in this life be obtained. Our Senses are incapable of
the Accidental joys or concomitant glory which attend this happiness. And our
Reasonable Soul, how magnificently soever Philosophers speak of its nature, is
more incapable of Essential joy and happiness; That consists in the Fruition or
enjoyment of the Divine Nature, which is, Happiness it self.

All the Contentments of this life will serve to no other use then to be as a
Foyl to set forth the happiness of the life to come. All the Contentments
possible of this life are entertained either by our bodily Senses, or by the
internal faculties of our Souls. Now by the discovery of the imperfections of
such Contentments, we may ascend by degrees to some competent Scale or view for
discovering the perfection of Joys in the Life to come.

The imperfection of all Contentments incident to this life, discovers it self
these Two Ways.

First, The several capacities are too narrow and feeble in themselves to give
entertainment to any portion of sincere and true joy: the very best
Contentments, which here they find in any Object, are mingled with dregs.

Secondly, The satisfying of one capacity defrauds another of that measure of
contentment whereof in this life it was otherwise capable. And commonly the
satisfying of the baser faculty, or meanest capacity does deprive the more
noble faculty of its due. Men given to their bellies, or solicitous in
purveying for the grosser senses of taste or touch, defraud the sense of sight
which is the gate of knowledge, and the ear which is the sense of discipline,
of their best Contentments. For as the old saying is, Venture non habet aures:
the Belly has no ears. And too much insight in the means which procure bodily
pleasures does blind or darken the Common sense. Others not so solicitous to
feed the belly with meat, as the ear with pleasant sounds, or the eye with
delightful spectacles; do by both means rob the reasonable soul of her best
solace, and as it were block up these ports and havens, by which provision
should come into her.

Every handy-craft or art of husbandry requires an ordinary capacity, not of
the Common sense only, but of the understanding. And yet such as have their
minds exercised in these and the like employments, are thereby dis-enabled for
bearing Rule or Government over more civil and ingenuous men; as may be
collected from the wise Son of Sirach, Ecclus. 38. from the 25. to the 33. Even
amongst the capacities or faculties of the reasonable soul there is not that
harmony or concord which were requisite for her better contentment. Some men in
a manner freed from the servitude of their outward senses, and able to command
their service for contemplation; by too much contemplating upon one sort of
objects, make themselves incapable of reaping that delight, which other objects
would more plentifully afford to these Contemplators. Some by studying the
Mathematics too much do benum their apprehensive faculties or capacities of
prudence or civil knowledge. Others whiles they seek to give too much
satisfaction to their desires or capacities of civil wisdom, or humane
Prudence, do infeeble their capacities and starve their desires of divine
Mysteries or spiritual understanding.

Quite contrary it is in the life to come. First, The Capacity of every sense
or faculty is improved to the uttermost; The Full satisfaction of all senses
and Faculties in the Life to come.
and no object shall intrude or offer it self, but such as are able to give,
severally, full Contentment without satietie.

Secondly, The Harmony or Consent between the several Capacities and desires of
every Sense and Faculty is most exact: the satisfying of one does no way
prejudice, but rather further another. Every one is apt to bear its part for
making up of that full harmony which is required to true happiness.

And, For those grosser Senses of Touch and Taste ^ith the Appetite of meat and
drink: All the pleasures in this life wherewith that are commonly overtaken are
(as we said before) medicines of diseases, rather than any true Contentments.

The first degree or step to happiness, is, To be freed from those diseases
wherewith they now are pestered. For though it be a misery for a man to want
food when he is an hungry, or drink when he is thirsty, or raiment when he is
cold, or needs it for ornament; yet we all conceive it to be a far greater
happiness to enjoy continual health and liveliness, without either hunger or
thirst, or to have perfect comeliness without clothing or raiment. And for this
reason that branch of happiness, which consists in satisfying the Capacities of
these Senses, is in Scripture described by Negatives: As there shall be no
hunger there, no thirst, no grief, no pain. These are the Symptoms of those
grosser Senses in this life, which in the life to come shall not enjoy the
pleasures or Contentments which are contrary to these annoyances (as we say) in
kind, but by a happy Exchange: by such an exchange, as he that turns lead into
silver, does forego a great deal of dross or baser metal, but gains that which
contains the full value of it in a small weight or compass.

Of all and every one of the bodily Contentments we can possibly imagine, the
very immortality of glorified Bodies, is for quality, more then the
Quintessence or Extraction. It contains health and cheerfulness of Spirit,
with all the pleasures that accompany them (as we say) Eminenter; that is, As
one pound weight of Gold fully contains in its worth many hundreds of lead; so
one Moment of immortality, the least weight of glory we can imagine, is worth
a full Age of all the health and happiness, that can be had on earth. Instead
of material food which perishes with the use, and whose fullness does always
breed satietie, the appetite of meat and drink shall be continually satisfied
with the Tree of Life, which (or rather, the Emblem or Type of which) our First
Parents were not admitted to touch in Paradise.

6. When the Sadduces captiously demanded, Which of those seven brethren should
have that woman to his wife in the world to come, which had been successively
married to all the seven? Our Savior answers; The children of this world marry
and are given in marriage, but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain
that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in
marriage; neither can they die any more for they are equal to the Angels. What
then shall such as have enjoyed the comfort of wedlock be utterly deprived of
that comfort in heaven, which was allotted to Adam in Paradise, even in the
state of innocence? They shall not have it in kind; for seeing flesh and blood
cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, there shall not be there any Two in one
flesh; but in lieu of this comfort, such as observe the Commandments of Christ
shall be more nearly espoused and joined in spirit unto Christ. For as man and
wife make one body: so he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit, 1 Cor. 6.
17. This is the consummation of that Great Mystery which is here begun on
earth, and whereof, the first marriage in Paradise was but the visible sign or
shadow; This is the very perfection of all pure and chaste love.

As for those other purer Senses of Sight and Hearing, they shall enjoy their
former Contentments, both Eminenter and Formaliter, both in kind, and by happy
exchange. Though enabled they shall be, to see far more glorious sights, and to
hear more heavenly sounds then in this life they could either hear or see: Yet
shall they not be disenabled to see the same sights or hear the same sounds
which sometimes in this life they did. But these they shall hear and see with
infinite more delight and joy, because the Capacity of these senses shall be
improved as far as life it self is improved, which of mortal becomes immortal.

The light was truly heavenly which did shine about Saint Paul, and the voice
was heavenly which spoke unto him, as he was journeying toward Damascus; but
the light did strike him blind, and the voice astonished him. What was the
reason? Being yet in the flesh, his Senses were not capable of these celestial
impressions.

But this you will say was a judgment upon Saint Paul, because he was yet a
Persecuter: So was not Saint Peter when he saw our Saviors Transfiguration
upon the Mount. This was but a glimpse of that glory which shall be revealed;
and yet it so overcharged his senses that it put him in a manner besides
himself, besides his wit or understanding: for he knew not what he said, when
he said; Let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses,
and another for Elias. Only this he was sure of in the general, That it was
good being there; or that if he should always have been, as for the present he
was, he should have been a most happy man; specially if his capacity to
receive or entertain what he then heard or saw, had been any way proportionable
unto them. Saint Paul likewise after his conversion was so Rapt in spirit with
the Celestial words which he heard, that it seemed he knew not whether he were
in the body, or out of the body when he heard them; that is, whether he were
locally present in Paradise, whence those words were spoken; or whether his
spirit were Elevated to hear them in such distance; whether of the two it was,
certainly such words they were that they could not be uttered by him, or be
made known unto others. 2 Cor. 12. 4. And as the words were unutterable, so the
joys which then possessed him were unexpressible by any known similitude or
resemblance. O how great then shall those joys be, when the sense of hearing
shall be as capable of these Celestial voices, as it now is of earthly? when
our sense of sight shall be as fitly proportioned to the spectacles of
paradise, as it is now unto the stars of the firmament? when all our faculties
shall be as capable of Celestial influences, as they are now of sublunary
impressions?

7. Briefly, all the joys or contentments of The life to come, even complete
happiness it self, may be reduced to these Two; First to joy or happiness
Essential. Secondly to joy or happiness concomitant or Accidental. Of both in
their order, and how they are set forth unto us in Scripture. Joy or happiness
Essential consists in the fruition of Gods presence.

But seeing the Deity or Divine nature is every where present, is it not now
present with us on earth? sure it is; but we are far from it. A light or candle
may be present to a blind man, and yet he as far from enjoying any comfort of
its presence, as if it were put under a bushel at the Antipodes. Such is the
case of all whose sins have made a separation betwixt their God and them; He is
present with them, present in them, but they are further removed from the
comfort of his presence then the Center of the earth is from the Highest
Heavens. The three children were in the fiery furnace, but it made no
impression upon them, they felt no smart or pain from it, because the heat of
it did not enter into them. Thus the Divine Nature or essence does incompass
all, good and bad, more truly then the furnace did their bodies. yet, he that
could withdraw the force or influence of heat from the fire, can likewise
withhold the joy or comfort of his presence from such as love him not. But
wheresoever it is, it is the fountain of all joy and happiness: and shall any
man be in the fountain of joy and happiness, and shall this fountain be in
them, and they not made happy by it? Yes; it is not enough that the fountain of
happiness is in them, they must enter into the joy of this Fountain, before
they become happy by it. Now that servant which has once entered into his
masters joy, needs no other external contentment or object to satisfy the
particular capacities of sense, or of any internal faculties. For as the Being
of every creature is contained in the Omnipotent nature, in a more excellent
manner then in it self: so all the goodness or comfortable influence which the
creatures can communicate unto others, is contained in a manner far more
excellent in Gods infinite goodness, which is likewise more communicative, then
any finite goodness can be. This infinite goodness dwells in Christ bodily;
the spirit of all joy and gladness is given unto him, but without measure. It
pleased God, that in him should all fullness dwell; That as we in this life from
his fullness receive grace for grace, so, in the better life or life to come, we
should receive jor for joy; that is, joy upon joy without ceasing, without end,
even as much as we shall be capable of, yea above all that we are able to
desire or conceive.

8. Our life, says the Apostle, Coloss 3. 3. is hid with Christ in God: when
Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in
Glory. All, as many as have their fruit unto Holiness in this life, have the
pledge, the earnest, or the Cocket of the next; But the life it self, whereof
Holiness is the pledge or Cocket, is treasured up in Christ; and may not be
delivered unto us, until we be changed; until he appear in glory
unchangeable. Whilst we see not him, we see not our selves, or that life which
is treasured up for us in him.

This sight is deferred or reserved until his appearance; Then this sight shall
grow into a perfect taste. So says the same Apostle, 1 Cor. 13. 12. Now we see
through a glass; that is, indistinctly, or as we see a truth locked up in a
Riddle: But then, When that which is perfect shall come, then shall we see face
to face. Now (says the Apostle of himself) I know in part, but then shall I
know even as I am known.

Saint John has the like mystery more fully: 1 John 3. 2. beloved, now are we
the sons of God; and it does not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that
when he shall appear, we shall be like to him, for we shall see him, as he is.
From all these places, but chiefly from the last, it is apparent, That the
fullness of our joys and happiness is from the vision or sight of God in
Christ. And hence is this Sight by the learned; and such as have insight in
these mysteries, called, Visio Beatifica, the Blessed vision, or the vision
which makes us happy: yet happy it makes us, in that, by it, we become like
unto him who is most happy, blessed, yea blessedness it self. This is Saint
John's inference, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that is,
not through a glass, but in a glass. Our understanding or intellective faculty
is as a Glass wherein this vision is made. Now the understanding, as the
Philosopher observed, is as a glass, apt to receive the impression of all
things intelligible: And (as he imagined) could not be perfected, could never
understand its own nature aright; until it were made all things, until it had
received the images or stamps of all things. And hence it is, that the more men
know, the more they desire to know. The knowledge of many particulars does but
excite our imbred desire of knowing more; and this desire can never be
satisfied, until we know all things. Now to know all things successively, or
one after another, is impossile. It was the complaint of the father of the
Physicians, Ars longa, vita breuis. The true knowledge of any Art or science,
or the subject of it, is long in getting, whereas man's Hippocrates.
life is short. There is no end, says Solomon, of writing many books; and much
reading (which is but the hunting after knowledge) is a weariness unto the body.

9. But it being taken as possible, or as granted; That we could come to know
the nature of all things which we see, hear, or read of; that we could be as
prompt and perfect in this visible book of nature, as we are in the first
elements of the easiest book that can be printed for us; that we knew the
nature of Heaven, of earth, and of every creature in them, as distinctly as
children do one letter from another; and the nature of mixed bodies, as well as
they know the just value of letters or Syllables put together: yet could not
such knowledge make us happy. For these things how perfectly soever known,
could not infuse any new life into us; could not make us partakers of any
greater joy or goodness then is in themselves. But in the life of glory our
souls become living polished glasses, wherein the Divine nature, wherein Christ
God and Man, may be seen as he is: and he is truth it self, life it self, and
goodness it self; and we are transformed into the similitude of all these his
Attributes.

There is no picture-maker that can express either the color or proportion of
a man's body or countenance so exactly as these do themselves in a true glass:
It receives the true image and similitude of any thing visible, as more easily,
so more exactly then wax does the stamp and character of the seal. For, That
receives only the Mathematical Form, or figure, without the matter or any real
quality. As a golden seal leaves no tincture of gold, nor a seal of brass any
property of brass, in the wax, but only the figure; Whereas a glass besides
the figure or proportion receives the color, but no other real quality.

But the eye, which is a kind of living glass, takes some tincture, not of the
shape or color only, but of other real qualities or properties of things seen.
By looking on Green or Azure the eye is much refreshed; because the natural
constitution of it resembles these most. Yet finds it not the like contentment
either in colors too sad or too bright, because these have less affinity with
its native temper. Nor is the effect or efficacy of colors seen, terminated
only in the eye, though the eye sees them; That reaches unto other internal
faculties, unto the very Seat or Center of the Affections. The impression which
colors perfectly red (as scarlet of the ancient die) make upon the eyes of
living creatures which abound in blood, does stir the blood, and inrage their
spirits to fight, when as otherwise they would be quiet. And to the end they
might provoke the Elephants to fight, they showed them the blood of grapes and
mulberies. 1 Mac. 6. 34. And some good Philosphers have observed, that Bears or
others creatures which abound with Melancholic blood, are more enraged at the
sight of colors more dark then scarlet, or See Book. 10. Chap. 9
perfect red; So that the eyes of living creatures which see things as they
are, not through a glass, but in themselves as in a perfect glass, are apt to
take others impressions besides the figure proportion or color of those things
which they steadfastly behold.

10. There is no creature in the world more apt to receive the shape or figure
of another, then man, in his first creation, was to receive the image or
likeness of his Creator, who has no figure or shape whereby he may be visibly
represented, as the seal is in the wax, or as a man's face is in a glass. He is
infinite in all his Attributes, and his infinity cannot be represented, must be
admired.

The similitude (though) of his goodness, or of his righteousness, wherein
happiness consists, was truly represented in the First man; for he was created
Just and holy, and wanted nothing to his happiness, save only perseverance in
that righteousness, wherein he was created. But he stained his soul with sin;
And so far as it was stained with sin, it was more apt to take the image of
Gods adversary, who was the Father of sin, the author of all iniquity which
men commit: (And so we all are by nature, more apt to take this image of the
wicked one:) then the purest glass is to receive the image, the proportion, and
colors of men that look upon it; more apt to take the impression of his bad
qualities, then the eye of any living creature is to take the impression of any
quality which shall be presented unto it.

But as the first Adam was made a living soul, so the second Adam was made a
quickening Spirit: A spirit of life to revive the Relics of Gods image in men's
souls; And by the reviving of them, to expel or blot out the expressions of
Satan's image in them. All this he does in part even in this life in such as
fear and love him. And in These Two, to wit, in the Reviving of Gods image in
us, and in the Expunction and wiping out the stain of sin (which is no other
then the image of Satan) does our Regeneration consist. And by the spirit of
Regeneration we see in part, we know God in part; but after that which is
perfect is come, that is, when Christ shall appear in glory, and we shall be
changed, Then shall that which is imperfect be done away; then shall our souls
be as a glass, clear and polished, apt to receive the image of God wherein we
were created in a far better manner then the soul of our first Progenitor in
his integrity was.

11. We know God by Hearsay in this life; we see him not: or if we see him in
part, in his word; yet this is but like the sight of things a far off; it makes
too little impression upon our souls; it works too small alteration in our
affections. Our sight is not effectual until it grow into a kind of Taste. Adam
was endued with life, with knowledge, with righteousness, but his life, his
knowledge, and righteousness were changeable. The life it self, and the light
of the world was in the Son of God, John 13. And now dwells bodily in Christ,
who is God and man: and when he shall appear, the life which is in him shall be
imprinted on us; we shall be partakers of the life which is unchangeable.

And as is life he, so is he light it self, light unchangeable.

And when we shall see him as he is, our knowledge, shall from this vision, be
as He is, without possibility of change, without decay or diminution. God,
says the Apostle, is Love; and when we shall see him as he is, we shall become
like him in this Attribute also; that is, as his Love to us was everlasting
without beginning; so our love to him shall be uncessant, unchangeable without
ending. And what expression of true happiness can be more full, then to be
everlastingly beloved of him who is Love it self, and to love him everlastingly?

The fruition of all things which we desire, or love, cannot be so much as the
the fruition of him, who, as he is all things else, so is he love it self. And
(as was said before) although we have all things else which our hearts desire,
yet till we enjoy his presence we cannot have our hearts desire: we cannot have
the accomplishment of our love until we enjoy his presence who is love it
self. But some will ask, What shall we do that we may enjoy the comfort of his
everlasting love and presence? The Psalmist has told us in few words, Psalm.
37. 4. Delight thou in the Lord, and he shall give thee thy hearts desire. But
how shall we delight in him whom we have not seen, or how should we love him
whom we know not?

We must take notice of our love to God who is invisible, from the experience
of our love unto our brethren whom we have seen: we cannot assure our selves
that we delight in him, unless we delight in his Saints that are on earth.
This is the Importance of Saint John's words; He that loves not his brother
whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he hoth not seen?

12. These are the usual Marks or Tokens whereby we are taught to know the
truth of Our love toward God, and of Our Allegiance to Christ. But many there
be, who call themselves Brethren, which have no other bond of brotherhood then
Simeon and Levi had. Many there be which boast in the Communion of Saints which
have no other Union then such as Corah, Dathan, and Abiram had, an Union in
Conspiracy against Moses and Aaron; against the visible Church and her
Governors.

The Papists will tell you, that the Communion of Saints is amongst them in
their Church: So will the Brownists and other Separatists: So will such as live
amongst us, and yet complain of the burden of Ceremonies in our Church. And
how shall men (the unlearned specially) know which of all these, or whether any
of these are the true Brethren of Christ, or the Saints in which we are bound
to delight? This, as will be replied, you may know by their delight in hearing
the word; for he that loves God loves his word; he that delights in God
delights in his word. Yea! but many delight in the outward letter of the word
only, or in the word as it is interpreted by Teachers of their own Faction, or
after their own Fancy; men, either not able to discern the Evidence of truth,
or not willing to have it manifested unto them. And how then shall any man know
whether he love the Lord, whether he delight in the Lord, by delighting in any
of their Societies, which pretend themselves to be Christ's Brethren, to be Gods
Saints?

Surely, there is a better way then all these to delight aright in the Lord,
and to know that we delight in him: and yet a way made known unto us by Gods
Word: A way, A direct and plain way, which we can not follow but by sincerely
delighting in his Word.

The Word of God does tell us, (and all sorts or Sects of men confess it) that
God is love, that he is righteousness, that he is holiness, that he is the
God of all peace, that he is good to all, that he is merciful and
long-suffering. Now he that in these things does imitate God; he that is
charitable and loving to all; he that is merciful and beneficial to all, so
far as his means will suffer him: he that deals justly and truly with his
neighbor; he that does delight in so doing, he does truly delight in the Lord;
and the Lord in his good time shall give him his hearts desire.

As there is a sincerity of Conversation required toward men, so likewise
there is a Purity of heart and Conscience toward God; and he that delights in
this, or seeks after this, does delight in the Lord, and he only shall truly
know that he delights in the Lord, or, that his hope is steadfast. For every
one, as Saint John says, that has this hope, to wit, of seeing God as he is,
does purify his heart, as he is pure: And our Savior says (as a blessing to
the pure in heart) that they shall see God. They shall see him in this Life in
his Word, and in his works; and in the life to come they shall see him as he
is, and be partakers of everlasting life, which is the Crown of purity and
holiness.

Of the Accidental Joys of the Life to come. A particular Terrar or Map of the
Kingdom prepared for the Blessed Ones, in a Paraphrase upon the Eight
Beatitudes, or the Blessedness promised to the Eight Qualifications set down in
St. Matthew, Chapter 5. Eternal Life the strongest obligation to all Duties.
Satan's Two usual ways of Tempting us: Either Per Blanda, or per Aspera.

1. BUt, if in the next life, we enjoy His Presence, who is Life it self, who
is Love it self, who is All in All, at whose right hand is Fullness of pleasures
for evermore; What need is there of any Access, of Accidental or Concomitant
Joys? It is true! There is no need of them, for so they should not be
Accidental. Therefore are they called Accidental, because such as enjoy Gods
Presence might be fully happy without them. So God himself is most happy in
himself, he is Happiness it self. Yet even in this, that he is Goodness it
self, that he is Happiness it self, he communicates both Goodness and
Happiness to his Creatures, so far as they are capable of them not by any
Accidental joys.
Necessity, but Freely. And when it is said, that when we shall see him as he
is, we shall be like him, part of this likeness does herein consist, that we
shall communicate this Goodness and happiness to others, so far as they are
capable of it. So that the Accidental or Concomitant Joys of the life to come
(whose Essence consists in the Fruition of God, as he is Love) although
super-abundant, yet are they not superfluous. There is no wast, there is
nothing poured out from one, which shall not be received (in the same measure
or manner) by another.

But wherein do these Concomitant or Accidental Joys consist? Especially in
these Two Particulars. The Beauteous Place.


First, In the Glorious Beauty of the Place, which is called Seeds Beatorum,
the Seat or Mansion of the Blessed.

Secondly, In the Society or company of such as are so seated, and made
partakers The Holy Company.
of that Essential Blessedness, which consists in the sight and vision of God,
as he is Happiness it self. For Visio amati est fruitio. This is that which
the Schools call The Fruition or enjoying of Gods presence. Now, that either
the Place or the Society of Saints and Angels, can add (or confer any thing)
to our happiness, this proceeds from Gods special presence in Both.

2. To begin with The Place or Seat of the Blessed; How pleasant soever First
in regard of the Place, or Seat of the blessed.
our Seat on earth may be, yet this world it self is but Vallis lachrymarum, A
Valley of tears, wherein some ruful spectacles are daily presented to our eyes;
wherein some woeful news or unpleasant sounds possess our ears. To hear and see
what we now daily hear and see, though we were Spectators only, but no Actors,
would abate our Joy, would be an Alloy to our present happiness. Hence it is,
that St. John describing the Accidental Joys of the life to come, says, Rev.
21. 1. I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first
earth were passed away, and there was no more Sea. And again verse 4. God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things
are past away. His meaning is, not only, That no man there shall have occasion
to cry; or that no sorrow or pain shall breed there; But that there shall be no
sorrow, no cry there, by way of Sympathy; that is, no ungrateful sound or
spectacle shall approach their dwelling in the holy City, which he describes at
large in the same Chapter, verse 11. unto the end. The Compass and Form of it
you have, verse 16. It lies four square, the length as large as the breath,
twelve thousand furlongs; and the building of the wall of it was of Jasper, and
the City was pure gold, like unto clear glass. Verse 18. etc. Thus he
describes The Beautiful Materials of the Place, by the most glorious and most
precious materials, which this world affords. And yet that is true of this
Description, which the Apostle says of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Law;
The gates of pearl, and the streets of gold transparent as glass, are no
better then shadows of the good things to come, which are treasured up in that
heavenly Kingdom for all such, as love Christ Jesus, and the glory of his
coming.

Now though it be true, that in Gods house there be many Mansions; Yet is not
the Beauty or Glory of them appropriated to one, nor divisible amongst some
few, but alike Common to all: One has not the less comfort There, because
another has more. Those Two quarrelling Pronounes, Meum and Tuum, shall be
excluded thence as common Barretters. One cannot say
to another, This part of this glorious Kingdom is mine; That is yours; for
every one, that shall be accounted worthy to be an heir of that Kingdom, shall
be as Entire an Heir, as if he were sole Heir. So it is not amongst the Kings
of the earth; the greater Dominions one has, or the further he extends them,
the less he leaves unto his neighbors.

There is some small Resemblance of the Condition of the Blessed Ones in
Heaven, to be found in our Hearing, sight, and knowledge of things which we
have here on earth: A great multitude may hear a speech, and every one hear
all. No man has less comfort from the light or heat of the Sun by another
enjoying it (unless he purposely stand between the Sun and him.) No man is
prejudiced, but rather furthered by another man's extraordinary knowledge,
specially of matters heavenly, and not divisible into parts. Howbeit here is a
vast difference, whilst we live on earth; even when there is no matter of
prejudice to any other, but rather of benefit or advantage to many; yet there
is matter too much of envy; for that breeds within man's self, it comes not by
infection from without. But so it is not in the place of bliss, in the
heavenly City, into which no unclean thing, no unclean thought, specially no
envy, no uncharitableness shall enter.

3. As is the Place, so is the Company or Society. Every one is Loving, Every
one is Lovely, All be Sons of Peace; their Love and Peace is mutual. Ye are In
regard of the Company there
come unto Mount Sion, and unto the City of the Living God, the heaveniy
Jerusalem; and to an innumerable company of Angels. To the general Assembly and
Church of the Firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of
all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of
the new Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, Heb. 12. 22. etc.

There is no Question (at least there ought none to be) but that the Essential
Joy or blessedness of the life to come shall not be Arithmetically Equal, that
is, the measure of it shall not be one and the same in all; for every man shall
be rewarded according to his ways. The Eternal Life, which is the Gift of God,
is the Award, not of Commutative Justice, nor of Distributive; though, if so it
were, it should be awarded according to Geometrical Proportion: But it is an
Act of mercy or bounty, and being such, there is no Question, but, he that
loved God more in this world then others, shall have a greater proportion in
his love. No Question but he, which has received a greater Talent, and has
employed it as well or better, then he that has received less; shall have a
greater reward; And he which has been more faithful in his Masters service; or
he in whom the Kingdom of Grace has entered further in this life, shall enter
further into his Masters Joy, shall partake more fully of the Kingdom of
Heaven. And according to the lesser or greater measure of Essential happiness,
shall the measure of their expressions of joy or thanksgiving be. And yet the
Joy, which amounts from their mutual expressions, shall be equal and the same
to all. For though every one cannot so fully express his joy or thanksgiving
as another does: yet he that comes short of others in this expression, shall
joy, even in this, that God is more or better glorified by another, then by
himself: and such is the disposition of these heavenly inhabitants, that, so
Gods name be truly glorified by all, they respect not by whom it be
comparatively most glorified. There are no Envious Comparisons there, seeing
every one of them has his full portion in that public and common joy, which
amounts from their joint expressions of thanksgiving. The Ditty of their song
is the same, and no man there shall be either deaf or silent.

4. This Inequality of Essential Joy, and this equality of joy Accidental,
cannot (to my apprehension) be better represented, then by A Chorus, or Quire
of voices well skilled and practiced to hold perfect consort. Amongst a great
number thus qualified, it cannot be expected that every one shall have either
the like clearness or sweetness of voice, or the like command over his voice,
that another has. Nor can he, that has the best natural voice, or best skill
in singing, impart or communicate either his voice or skill unto others, which
sing in consort with him; and yet every one is partaker of the sweetness of
another voice as well as of his own. The concent or harmony is alike to all
that have musical ears; And a man, even in this life, is oftimes more delighted
to hear another man then himself sing either alone or in consort: but most
delight in a full Chorus A Choir or consort. After this manner, the blessed
Saints and Angels shall not impart any part of that Internal joy or happiness,
which arises from the Fruition or vision of the God of Love, unto another; nor
shall he have any need of it, as we say, at the second hand: for every one
shall have as much of it within himself as he is capable of.

But of that external joy, which results from their joint consort in singing
praise and glory unto God, every one shall be partaker, and the more they are,
the greater shall be every ones portion of this delight or joy. And thus much
of life Eternal, and of the blessedness which is contained in it, or is the
property of it: whether it be Blessedness Essential or Concomitant.

5. Yet some there be, which give a more particular Terrar, or distinct Map The
Eight Beatitudes. Matthew. 5.
of this heavenly life or Kingdom, out of the fifth of Saint Matthews Gospel.
And many Excellent Discants upon our Saviors words in that place, you may
find, in Authors Ancient and Modern, in all such as Comment upon the Eight
Beatitudes (as they call them.) Yet whilst you read or hear them, take this
Memorandum with you, That there are not eight several Beatitudes distinct one
from another, for all are contained in this one word, to wit, Eternal life,
which is but one and the same; the joy or happiness, which is the property of
it, is the same: it has not eight several branches, albeit our Savior
pronounce this blessedness eight several times.

What then? Are these, but so many Tautologies or repetitions of one and the
same thing? God forbid we should so think or speak of him, who spoke as never
man spoke! Or is there a mystery in the Number of eight? None questionless in
the abstract number. All the mystery (if it be to be termed a mystery) is in
the Reference of one and the same Blessedness to eight several qualifications,
without which no man shall be partaker of the life to come; and to eight sorts
of men, unto whom according to their several qualifications or conditions One
and the same Blessedness comes more welcome under one Style or Title, then it
would do under another, especially whilst it is proferred, not as present or
In re, but as future and In spe, as a thing far off, whilst it is yet under
promise.

6. The First Promise of this Blessedness, is, unto such as are poor in Spirit;
that is, to men free from secular ambition, to men of an humble mind. The The
first Beatitude.

Poor in Spirit.


greatest grievance, which men thus qualified and affected, in this life
suffer, is, that they are in a manner trod upon by others, and for the most
part excluded from rule or Jurisdiction; inferiors to all, superiors to none.
And if they be as poor in wealth, as spirit, there is a kind of necessity laid
upon them for continuing such. For his Observation is not yet out of date.
Pauper eris semper si pauper es Aemilianc, Munera non dantur nunc, nisi
divitibus. If a man be once poor, he shall be always poor; for no man grows
rich by gifts, but he that is able to give.

Now to encourage such as already are poor in spirit to continue this
Resolution, and to arm their humility with constancy against all the secular
inconveniences or grievances, wherewith it is charged; The Blessedness of the
life to come is promised to them under the name or Title of a Kingdom. Blessed
are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, Matthew. 5. 3. that
is, they are nearer to life eternal, to true happiness and glory, then
ambitious or aspiring minds, which have not a desire only, but oft-times means
and opportunity to attain to honor and dominion over others here on earth.
This Affection of Poorness in Spirit, is the first degree and step to
Blessedness; And with Reference to this, scarcity of means or external
poverty is for some men more expedient then wealth; For though many be
humbled, which are not humble, yet few are humble which have not been first
humbled by some cross
or affliction.

7. But many are poor in spirit, which have no extraordinary occasion to spend
their days in mourning. Unto such as truly mourn, the very conceit Second
Beatitude for Mourners.
or mention of pomp or jollity is ungrateful. To provoke them to mirth, until
nature have her Forth, is unseasonable, a kind of sin: To tell them of a
Kingdom, were all one as to mock them; yet none there are, who truly mourn,
which do not seriously desire Comfort, though it be but in mourning with them.
And for this reason it is, that unto such as mourn, our Savior promises the
blessedness of the life to come, not under the style or title of a Kingdom,
but under a title more grateful, and that is, Comfort. Ver. 4. Blessed are they
that mourn, for they shall be comforted; So they mourn not as those that have
no hope, so they murmur not, nor repine at Gods providence. As for mourning it
self, it is a branch of evil, a kind of punishment or chastisement, no way
pleasant for the present. Comfort in the Sacred Dialect, includes abundance of
good things, as appears by Abraham's answer unto Dives, Luke 16. 25. Son
remember, that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, and likewise
Lazarus evil things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. The very
joys of heaven could not have been so sweet to Lazarus, unless in this life he
had wanted Comfort.

8. Many again have just occasion to mourn, and whilst these occasions last do
not transgress in the manner of their mourning: they repine not at God; The
third Beatitude to the meek spirited ones.
are not malicious against the men, which find them matter to mourn for: and
yet for all this are not of so meek a spirit, as every Good Christian, when
occasion or exigences of time require it, should be.

This Qualification includes somewhat more, or somewhat besides Poorness in
spirit, or humility, or patience in mourning. Meekness is a moderation of
anger in some special Cases; such a Temper as our Savior requires in his
Followers, when he commands them to turn the right cheek to him that smites
them on the left; and to be willing to redeem their peace with a troublesome
neighbor, that would take away the coat, though it be with the loss of the
cloak also. See chapt. 11.. 7.
Now this kind of Temper exposes men to many kinds of Inconveniences hard to
be digested by flesh and blood. Many otherwise humble and ingenuous, when they
are touched (as we say, in their Coppp-hold, or) in their inheritance, will take
courage and boldness, sometimes more then were fitting, though necessary, if
they be resolved to defend their own, without respect to the occasions or
exigences of time. For, facies hominis in causa propriatanquam facies Leonis. A
man's face or presence in his own cause is as the face of a Lion. And he that
cannot take his own part in his own cause, and set the best Foot forwards, may
easily be turned out of house and home. And yet there is no true Disciple of
Christ, but must expect to have his patience exercised in this kind; to be
injuriously vexed and molested by Others for that which is not Theirs.

Now he that in this Case will not vex or molest others again, nor himself, he
is truly meek; and unto men thus qualified, or to encourage all to be thus
qualified, the Blessedness of the life to come is promised not under the Title
of a Kingdom, or of Comfort, but under the Title most contrary to the course
and custom of this world, wherein Meekness is commonly Accursed with loss of
their own possession; But, Blessed, says our Savior, are the meek, for they
shall inherit or possess the earth; or the Land: even that good Land, where
there is no Ejection, no dis-inheriting of such as are possessed of it, and
therefore are the meek blessed, because Meekness or quietness is the Way or
Title to get Possession thereof.

9. But the poor in spirit may have more honor then they can desire; so may
such as mourn have as much Comfort; and the meek as large and durable The
fourth Beatitude, to Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness.
an Inheritance, as their hearts could wish: But if this were all, they could
not be satisfied. Every one of these have in this life their several Thirsts or
Longings; As he that mourns thirsts after Comfort; the poor in spirit and the
meek hunger and thirst after their Contentment in some kind or other; But
without all hope of satisfaction, unless they hunger and thirst after somewhat
else besides these particular contentments. Man in his first estate was created
righteous; and unless there be a longing after that Righteousness, which our
first Parents lost, whatsoever we gain or get besides cannot satisfy our
desire either In Re or In Spe. Hence says our Savior in the Fourth place,
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be
satisfied. There is a thirst after honor, preferment and ease; and there is
Auri sacra fames, an unquenchable hunger after gold and Pelf; but this cannot
be satisfied; all these are tortures to the soul wherein they harbor. For
though honor be Gods: though gold and silver, as the Prophet speaks, be his;
yet he is not these, these are not the same that He is: but (as we said lately)
God is righteousness, He is Peace, He is Love, He is mercy, and therefore
whosoever delights in these, he truly delights in the Lord, and shall
assuredly have his hearts desire; he only shall be satisfied.

10. But, no man in this life does, or can delight in these works as he ought:
5. Beatitude to the merciful.
the most righteous man that ever lived on earth, if God should enter into
Judgment with him, could not be absolved from the sentence of the Law; and so
long as he stands unabsolved, or uncertain of his Absolution, he cannot be
satisfied, he cannot have his hearts desire, he always stands in need of
mercy. And mercy he shall have that is merciful. For it is Remarkable, that
this qualification of mercifulness, is the only qualification or condition,
which is rewarded in kind: in this we most perfectly resemble the goodness of
God.

Hence says our Savior; Blessed are the merciful. But why are they blessed?
Not because they shall receive a Kingdom, not because they shall possess the
Land, not because they shall be satisfied, but because they shall obtain mercy.
Without the exceeding mercy of God no man can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;
neither into the Kingdom of Grace in this life, nor into the Kingdom of Glory
in the life to come; and he that means to enter in at the Gate of mercy, must
bring his Ticket, or rather his * Counter-part indented with him; he must be
merciful as his heavenly Father is merciful; See Master Medes notion of (...),
upon Psalm. 112. 6.
otherwise he shall be excluded.

Righteousness toward God, if it were possible to be severed from mercy
toward man, could not suffice.

11. But that, which comes nearest to true blesledness it self, is Purity of
6. Beatitude to the Pure in heart.
heart. This contains the Root, whereof Holiness is the fruit; that Holiness,
whose End is Everlasting life. Now he that desires to keep this purity of
heart, must deprive his eyes of many pleasant sights, and his ears of many
delightful sounds, and every sense of those particular contentments, wherein
the world most delights. But in lieu of this loss, he has A blessing
promised, not only of this life, but of the life to come. In the life to come
he shall see God as he is, face to face; and in this life he shall see him as
through a glass; and so he shall see him in his Word and in his Attributes: And
the best knowledge that in this life can be had, The knowledge of God and of
his Attributes, without transforming the Divine nature into the similitude of
our corrupt affections: is, To see his righteousness and Justice without
derogation from his Mercy or Goodness; or, to see him to be goodness it self,
and mercy it self, without any diminution of his Justice: To see his gracious
and peculiar favor toward some, without suspicion or imagination of rigor or
cruelty toward others; To know him to be love it self, without admixture of
hatred toward any thing that he has made.

12. It is this sight of God, or this apprehension of this uniformity bebetween
his Attributes, which must transform us into such a similitude of 7. Beatitude
to the Peacemakers.
his divine nature, as in this life can be had; that is, such as may make us
the children of peace. This is the immediate fruit of purity of heart; And unto
men thus disposed to preserve peace as for their own particulars, and to make
peace between such as are at variance; the blessedness of the life to come
could not be promised under a more grateful Title, then under the style or
Title of being called the sons of God. And under this style it is promised,
ver. 9. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.

13. Yet all these qualifications were not sufficient, unless they be
accompanied Patience and resolution in suffering for righteousness.
with a firm and constant resolution to suffer persecution; all the persecution
that flesh and blood can in this life devise against them, rather then they
should forego their humilty, their mourning, their meekness, their love of
righteousness, their mercifulness, and purity of heart toward God. There must
be a greater love of all these qualifications here mentioned, then of our
selves, otherwise we shall be incapable of the least portion of the Blessedness
here so often promised. This patience in suffering, or constant resolution to
endure persecution, is the very girdle or tie of all other Christian virtues;
and for this reason it is twice repeated, Blessed are they that suffer
persecution, for righteousness sake, ver. 10. And again, ver. 11. Blessed are
you, when men shall revile you, etc.

14. Many may be forward to suffer persecution, yea to affect it; but as he
said, Res ingeniosa est esse Christianum, It is a matter of extraordinary wit,
to be a true Christian; unto true Martyrdom there is required not only
sobriety of spirit, but of Judgment; for none can be a Martyr, but he that
suffers for Righteousness sake, or for Christ's sake, who is such a fountain of
righteousness, as the sun is of light. Now to discern true righteousness from
pretended, or to sever Christ's Cause from our own particular Interest or
engagements, is a point of extraordinary skill. Whereas it is an easy matter
to pawn our fame or credit, our very lives in maintenance of that, which we
have boldly avouched to be true and just. None were more forward to sacrifice
themselves for their Religion, then were the Jews, which yet blasphemed the
name of Christ, and the ways of truth; after they had crucified the Lord of
truth and of glory; none more forward then they to raise up persecution against
the Apostles and disciples in every City; and albeit many of them were put to
cruel and ignominious deaths for their stiff adherence to Moses Law, as they
imagined; yet Martyrs they were not, because they died not for Moses sake, nor
for his sake for whom Moses wrote; but for maintenance of their own perverse
opinions and affections: For though they abhorred the Idols of the heathen, yet
they committed more abominable sacrilege, then the Heathens did; for of all
kinds of Idolatry or Sacrilegious worship the most untoward and least to be
pitied, is, when men are prone to sacrifice themselves to their own pride or
headstrong ignorance.

15. The truth is, that no man can suffer persecution for righteousness sake,
but he that is a follower of righteousness, and a son of peace. No man can
suffer persecution for Christ's and the Gospels sake, but he that has learned
of Christ to be humble, and meek. And for this reason, happily it is, that unto
such as suffer persecution, whether in their body, or good name (so they suffer
it for Christ's name) the blessedness of the life to come is promised. First,
under the same Style or Title, that it was unto the poor in spirit; He had said
of these ver. 3. That theirs is the Kingdom of heaven; and of those ver. 10.
Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.

As also secondly, under the same Title that it is promised to the meek, of
whom he had said, ver. 5. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth. And unto such as are reviled and persecuted falsely for his sake he
adds, verse 12. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in
heaven.

16. And thus has our Savior taught us the Use and application of all that
has been delivered concerning Eternal Life; And the Use or application of it
is as General and large, as are the commandments of God. There is no duty
enjoined, whereunto the hope or belief of this Eternal Reward Eternal life the
strongest motive and obligation to all duty.
does not enable and bind us. This was the first Lesson our Savior taught
after he entered upon his Prophetical function; and it is the last Article in
our Creed. It is as Christ himself is, Imus, angularis lapis, et suminus: It is
both the foundation stone, and that which binds all the building, nor
need we be afraid to do well Intuitu mercedis; with respect to recompense or
reward; seeing Christ himself, when he first begun to Preach the glad See
Chapt. 10. Section 7.
tidings of the Gospel, did make no promise of reward save only to such as
continue in weldoing, or suffer evil with patience. And his Apostle Saint Paul,
exhorting us to cheerfulness in weldoing, and patience in suffering, proposes
the like hope of reward; making Christ Jesus himself a pattern for us to follow.

Wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin, which does so easily
beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Looking
unto Jesus the Author and finisher of our faith, who, for the joy that was set
before him, endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the
right hand of the Throne of God. Heb. 12. 1, 2.

Nor is it possible for flesh and blood to resist either their proper
Enticements, or the temptations of Satan; much less to vanquish this tempter,
by any other means, then by serious meditation upon the several Rewards
proposed unto such as shall overcome; and of the several punishments, which are
threatened and shall be awarded unto all such as forsake the field, and neglect
the service of God. And though it be true, that we must obtain this victory by
the spirit of God, yet one special means, by which the spirit of God obtaines
this victory for us, is by representing and imprinting such punishments, or
plagues as are dreadful and fearful even to flesh and blood: so that the flesh
must be affrighted and deterred from, or forth of the ways of sin, by the 1
Cor. 10.
wages of sin; And the spirit of God, which is in man, must be daily animated
and encouraged by the hope of heavenly joys, whose very nature and quality is
spiritual. The flesh or sensitive part cannot truly apprehend the joys of the
spirit; nor is the spirit so capable or so apprehensive of deadly punishment or
pain, as the sensitive or animal part is.

17. To branch this Use or Application, which our Savior makes of this point,
into his proper particulars. Though it be true, that all of us are the seed of
rebellious parents, and have gone astray from the womb, as well by sins of
omission, as of commission: yet that which the heathen Philosopher long since
observed, if it be heartily interpreted, and with such charity as becomes
Christians, is likewise true, Nemo sponte malus: No man in his first aim and
intentions desires to be disobedient, seditious or factious, to See Book 10.
Chap. 21.
be an Adulterer, or murderer, a fornicator, a thief or perjured man, or to
look upon his neighbors conveniences with an envious or malicious eye.

The means, by which Satan tempts us, or by which our natural affections The
motives Satan uses to to withdraw us
sway us to do these things in particular, as to be disobedient, seditious,
factious, or servants to other lewdness, are generally Two: Per blanda, aut per
aspera; by proposing some things unto us, which respectively either promise
some contentment to our senses; or threaten some loss, some pain, or vexation.
This visible world, and the things which we see or know by sensible experiment,
are as Satan's Chess-board; which way soever we look or turn our thoughts, he
has somewhat or other still ready at hand, to give our weak and untrained
desires the Check; and to hazard the losing of our souls and bodies.

But Faith (as the Apostle speaks) is the evidence of things not seen; And the
things that are not seen (as the Apostle says) are eternal; and these are for
number so many, and for worth so great, that if we be as vigilant and careful
to play our own game, as he is to play his; for every Check, which he can give
us, we may give him the Check-mate. And this advantage we have of him, that
whereas he usually tempts us but one way at one and the same time; that is,
either by hopes of some sensual contentment, or by fear of some temporal
vexation, loss, or pain; we may at the same time resist his temptations Two
ways: both by proposal of some spiritual good or reward,
much greater then the particular sensible contentment, and by representation
of some spiritual loss or fear, much more dangerous, then any evil, wherewith
he can threaten or deter us from performance of our duty.

19. If he tempt us to excess in meat and drink, which is commonly the root,
whence other branches of Luxury or sensuality spring; we may counterpoize this
temptation; First, with that hanger and thirst, and other torments incident to
this appetite of sense, in the life to come; And in the second place, by our
hopes of our celestial food, or full satisfaction of our hunger and thirst, so
we will but hunger and thirst after righteousness. And so again if he tempt us
to other unclean pleasures of the flesh; we may give our inclinations the
check, by proposing unto them our assured hope of enjoying the society of
immaculate Angels, and of our espousall to the immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus in
this life, and of enjoying his presence in the life to come. And again we may
control our natural inclination to this branch of lewdness, by serious
meditation on that Divine Oracle; Adulterers and Whoremongers God will Judge;
and judging condemn them to everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his
Angels.

20. If Satan shall tempt us to an immoderate desire of riches, the
counterpoize to this temptation is likewise twofold: First, There is a promise
of treasure in Heaven, to such as seek after it more then earthly treasure; and
this is a treasure not chargeable with the like carking care in getting it, nor
subject to the like inconveniences after it be gotten: for, there, neither rust
nor moth does corrupt, nor do thieves break through and steal. Besides, the
heaps of riches even in this life are fruitless; for as our Savior says in
another place, though a man have riches in great abundance, yet his life does
not consist in them. Ten thousand talents cannot add one minute to the length
of his days; whereas the heavenly treasures are the crown of life. Or if the
hope of these heavenly treasures cannot oversway men's thirst or longing after
earthly treasures; you may join to this, the weight of Saint James his Woe
against this sin; Chap. 5. 1, 2, 3. Go to now ye rich men! weep and howl for
your miseries, that shall come upon you: your riches are corrupted; and your
garments motheaten; your gold and silver is cankred; and the rust of them shall
be a witness against you.

But if this were all, a rich worldling would reply, that he would keep his
gold and silver from rust. This he may do perhaps, whilst he is alive, but more
then he can undertake after it once come unto Plutus his custody; Therefore
Saint James, adds, the rust of it shall eat your flesh as fire: or, if this be
but a Metaphor, he speaks no Parables, but plainly, in the words following: ye
have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold the hire of the
laborers, which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by
fraud, cries, and the cries of them, which have reaped, are entered into the
ears of the Lord of Sabbath.

21. Again, if Satan tempt us to do those things, which we ought not to do, for
the favor; Or to leave those things undone which we ought to do, for the fear
of great ones; the sacred Armorie affords us weapons sufficient to repel Both
temptations. The First is that pithy sentence of Saint Paul: ye are bought with
a price, be not ye the servants of men. The Second is that of our Savior, Fear
not them, who after they have killed the body, can do no more: but I will tell
you whom ye shall fear, one that can destroy both body and soul in hell fire,
yea I say unto you, fear him. Briefly, in all assaults, Satan has only Weapons
Offensive, as fiery darts; he has none Defensive: But
if the word of God, as our Apostle speaks, dwell plentifully in us, we have
both the shield and buckler to repel his darts, and the sword of the spirit to
chase him away: but this word must plentifully dwell in us; we must entertain
it in our hearts and consciences, not only in our lips and tongues; nor let it
run out of our mouths faster then it comes into our ears.

ROMANS 6. 23. For the wages of sin is death: but the Gift of God is Eternal

The Philosophers Precept, [Sustine and Abstine] though good in its kind, and
in some degree useful, yet insufficient. True belief of The Article of the
everlasting life and death, is able to effect both abstinence from evil-doing,
and sufferance of evil for well-doing. The sad effects of the Misbelief or
Unbelief of this Article of life and death eternal. The true belief of it

the second death fully adequate to the Body of sin. Parisiensis his Story. A
general and useful Rule.

1. THe heathen Philosopher, which knew no temper besides himself, no
temptation but such as the daily occurences of what he heard or saw, The
Philosophical Precept, Sustine et abstine, imperfectly good.
or by some sense of the body had experience of, did acknowledge as much as
has been formerly delivered out of Gods word: to wit, That men are usually
misdrawn to do those things in particular, which in general they desired not to
do; and to leave those things undone, which in the calm of composed affections
they desired to do, either by the hope of some bodily pleasures, or by fear of
some bodily pain.

And unto this twofold inconvenience he prescribed this brief Receipt, (...)
That men (in youth especially) should accustom themselves to abstinence and
sufferance; to abstinence from evil, and to sufferance of evil; that is, unto
abstinence from unlawful pleasures, which we call Malum culpae, or Evil of Sin;
and to endure with patience malum poenae, the evil of pain, or of some loss,
rather then hazard The quiet of Conscience, by doing that which is evil or
unlawful; or by not doing that which is good, specially when we are thereto
required.

But this brief receipt or diet of the Soul, without some other addition, will
rather serve to condemn us Christians, then enable us to live a true and
Christian life: The Receipt though is good in the General, but defective in
these Particulars.

First, Unless he knew more of Gods Will, or of the mysteries of Christian
Religion, then we know any means by which he could possibly know either, being
an Heathen; he was ignorant of many evils, from which he was bound to abstain;
and altogether as ignorant what those good things were, for whose love he was
to suffer malum poenae, the evil of pain, loss or grievance, rather then
disclaim them.

Secondly, Albeit he had known what was to be done, what to be left undone; yet
being ignorant of this main Article of Christianity, to wit, of A Life
everlasting, which is the reward of well-doing, the Crown of Holiness; and of
an everlasting Death, which is the wages of sin, and issue of unlawful
pleasures: His Receipt of Sustine and Abstine was altogether as fruitless and
vain, as if a Physician should prescribe a Dosis or Recipe to his Patient, of
such Simples or compounded Medicines, as cannot be had in this part of the
world, but must be sought for at the East or West Indies, or at the Antipodes,
whence there is no hope they can be brought before the Patient be laid in his
Grave: The Medicine which he prescribes, is no where to be found but in the
Word of God: The Simples whereof it is compounded, can grow from no other root
or branch, then from The Articles of everlasting Life, and everlasting death.
The Belief of the One, is the root of Abstinence Belief of this Article will
work obedience.
from sinful or unlawful Pleasures: The Belief of the other, is the root of
Patience or sufferance of malum Poenae, or of sufferance for well-doing:
Howbeit, to speak exactly, both parts of his Receipt may be had from the Belief
either of Everlasting Life, or Everlasting Death, but most completely from the
belief of both.

The manner how thence they may be gathered, is expressed by our Apostle St.
Paul, Romans 8. 16. etc. The Spirit it self bears witness with our spirit, that
we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and
joint heirs with Christ; if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
together; for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, are not worthy
to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us, etc.

2. If all the sufferings of this life, be not worthy of the glory which shall
be revealed in us, as the Rule of Faith teaches us; then conscience, and
reason it self binds us, to suffer all the Persecutions or Grievances which
can be laid upon us, rather then hazard our hopes, or forfeit our Interests in
the Glory that shall be revealed in all such, as with patience suffer
persecution, or other temporal loss or detriment for the truths sake. And this
hope of Glory is as the Root whence Christian patience or sufferance must grow.
So is the fear of everlasting Death, the root of our abstinence from evil, or
of repentance for former want of this abstinence: This is the same Apostles
Doctrine, 2 Cor. 5. 10. For we must all appear before the Judgment seat of
Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to
that he has done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of
the Lord, we persuade men. To what does he persuade men? To do those things
which are good, and which being done shall be rewarded, not in Judgment, but
in mercy and loving kindness; Those things by which we shall be reconciled unto
God.

But were not these Corinthians reconciled to God before our Apostle thus
persuaded them? Yes; so says the Apostle, 2 Cor. 5. 18. God has reconciled us
to himself by Jesus Christ. And when our Apostle, and those to whom he wrote,
were reconciled unto God through Jesus Christ; we that are now living were by
the same means reconciled unto God; For, God was in Christ reconciling the
world unto himself. Now if the world, that is, not this or that man, not this
or that generation of men, but all generations, the world of mankind were
reconciled unto God, when our Apostle wrote this Epistle, yea when Christ
offered himself upon the Cross, what need is there of any further
reconciliation? For that which God does, he does most perfectly, most
completely.

3. It is true; Our reconciliation was most perfectly, most completely wrought
on Gods part by Christ's death upon the Cross, he paid the full price of our
Redemption, of our reconciliation; nothing may or can be added thereto. Yet A
Reconciliation there is to be wrought on our parts, though wrought it cannot
be, but by the spirit of God, and wrought it is not ordinarily, but by the
ministry of men, as Gods Deputies or Ambassadors. So the Apostle adds, ver. 19.
God has committed to us, to wit, his Ministers, the word of reconciliation.
Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though Christ did beseech you by us,
we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled Of reconciliation Active, or
Grammatically passive only, and reconciliation really passive, See Book 10.
Fol. 3267, and 3278.
to God. So then God has reconciled us all unto himself from the hour of
Christ's death, and yet every one of us, for his own particular, must be
reconciled to God by the Ministry of his Ambassadors: And the efficacy of their
Ministry is demonstrated by working true repentance in us. The means again, by
which they work this true repentance, must be by representing the Terror of
the Lord, or, as our Apostle says, Act. 17. 30. by putting them in mind of the
last and dreadful day. The times of this ignorance (to wit, of the old world
before Christ's death) God winked at; but now commands all men every where to
repent, because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in
righteousness, by that man whom he has ordained, whereof he has given
assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead. Thus you see
how the terror of the last day, or fear of everlasting death must work in us
an Abstinence from evil, or repentance for evil past, as the Hope of
Everlasting Life does work patience and constancy in persecution.

Yet both parts of that brief Receipt, Sustine et Abstine, may be effected by
our serious meditation upon either branch of our belief concerning life and
death everlasting: For, if all the sufferings of this life be not worthy of, or
equivalent unto the glory, which shall be revealed in us, we must needs be
worthy of, and obnoxious to everlasting death, if we do not with patience
suffer persecution in this life, rather then hazard our hopes of Life Eternal.

Again; if the sufferance of everlasting death be much worse, then the
suffering of all persecutions possible in this life, our not repentance at the
Terror of it, does make us incapable of everlasting life. Our hopes of
avoiding it by repentance, if they be sound and firm, will animate, and in a
manner impell us to follow the ways of life, to bring forth fruits worthy of
repentance.

4. Seeing then we are thus environed on the right hand and on the left, having
the hopes of Eternal Life set before us to encourage us to constancy and
resolution; and are so strongly beset with inevitable fear of everlasting
death, if like faint hearted soldiers, we should retreat, or revoke our vow in
Baptism, may not the Lord in Justice take up that complaint against us, which
sometimes he did against Jerusalem and Judah? What could I have done more for
my vineyard, that I have not done unto it? Other means to make men either good
men, or good Citizens, the old world knew none, nor could the wit of the wisest
Lawgivers devise any besides poena, et praemium, Reward and punishment. Now,
what Kingdom, or Commonwealth had either so bountiful Rewards, or so dreadful
punishments proposed unto them, as we Christians have? What then is the reason,
why we of all others are more defective in good duties, most fruitful in evil,
less observant, or more desperate transgressors of our Princes Laws, then the
subjects or Citizens of any other well governed Kingdoms ever were? how often
do we pawn our hopes of everlasting life upon less occasions, then Esau did his
birthright, and set Christ our acknowledged Lord and Redeemer to sale at a
lower price, then Judas did?

The original of this our desperate neglect or contempt must either be
misbelief or unbelief of the Reward promised to well doing, or of the
Punishment threatened to evil doers. And it would be a point very hard to
determine, Whether, of such as make any conscience of their ways, especially
since the reformation of Religion; more have miscarried through misbelief, or
through unbelief of this Great Article of our Creed, Everlasting life and
everlasting death. Our Misbelief, for the most part, concerns the Article of
everlasting life. Of everlasting death, we are rather unbelievers then
misbelievers.

Misbelief always includes a strong belief: but the stronger our belief, the
more dangerous it is, if it be wrested or misplaced; and the worst way we can
misplace our belief of heavenly joys, is, when we make our selves certain of
our salvation before our time; or rank our selves amongst the elect or heirs
not disinheritable of the heavenly kingdom, before we have made our Election
sure.

5. As the absolute infallibility of the present Romish Church does make up
the measure of heathenish Idolatry or iniquity: So the immature belief of our
own salvation or Election, does make up the measure of Jewish or Pharisaical
Hypocrisy. The manner how it does so, is this. If no covetous, if no
sacrilegious person, if no slanderer of his brethren, or reviler of his
betters, can enter into the Kingdom of heaven (as it is certain they cannot,
until they repent:) then, no man, which is certain of his salvation, can
persuade himself, or be persuaded that he is, a covetous, or sacrilegious
person, that he is a slanderer of his brethren, or a reviler of his betters;
and hence the Conclusion arising from the Premises is inevitable; that albeit
such men as presume of their Election or salvation before their time, before
they be thoroughly sanctified, do all that covetous or sacrilegious men
do, be continual slanderers or malicious revilers of their brethren, yet it is
impossible that they should suspect much less condemn themselves of these
crimes until they correct their former errors, and rectify their misbelief or
presumption of their immutable estate in grace. Yea, their error, not being
corrected, makes them confident in these wicked practices, and causes them to
mistake hatred to men's persons, or envy to others good parts, for zeal to
Religion; and stubbornness in Schism and faction, for Christian charity or
good affection unto truth. And if any man of better insight in the Stratagems
of Satan, shall go about to detect their error or convince them by strength of
Reason grounded upon Scripture, that their mis-perswasions do branch into
Blasphemy, and can bring forth no better fruit then Pharisaical hypocrisy,
yet they usually requite his pains, as that young Spanish spark did the
Physician, which had well nigh cured him of a desperate Frenzy; no sooner had
he brought him to know what he was indeed, no more then a Page, though to a
great Duke, or Grandee of Spain, but the Youth, instead of a Fee or thankful
acknowledgement, began to revile and curse the Physician, for bringing him out
of a pleasant dream of golden mountains, much richer then the King of Spain had
any; it seemed as a kind of hell unto him, to see himself to be but a Page, who
in his raving fits had taken upon him to create Dukes and Earls, and to
exercise the Acts of Royal Authority. Very much like him in Horace. Epistol.
Libr. 2. Ep. 2.

-- Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,
Qui se credebat miros audire Tragoedos,
In vacuo laetus sessor plausorque Theatro:
Hic, ubi cognatorum opibus curisque refectus

Et redit ad sese; pol! me occidistis amici

Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus Error.
But with the Originals of Mis-belief (besides what is said in our Fifth Book
of Comments upon the Creed) in this particular, we shall have fitter occasion
to meet hereafter: And the greater part of men amongst us (I am persuaded)
offend more in Unbelief then in Mis-belief.

6. And by Unbelief (lest we should be mistaken) we understand somewhat less
then the lowest degree of Infidelity. Now of Infidels there be two Infidels of
two sorts.
degrees or ranks, Infideles Contradictionis, and Infideles purae Negationis:
He is an Infidel in the former sense, that contradicts or opposes the truth of
Scriptures, especially concerning Everlasting Life and Everlasting Death; and
such Infidels, I presume, there are none amongst us: He is an Infidel in the
Later Sense, that does not believe the truth of Scriptures, or cannot give a
Reason of his Faith: or one that neither thinks of Heaven or Hell; and such
Infidels there be almost in every Congregation. But an Unbeliever a man may be,
although in the General he believe whatsoever the Scripture says concerning
the Resurrection of the Body, or Life and Death everlasting, unless withal he
lay this his Belief to heart, unless he have a true estimate, as well of the
reward proposed to good deeds, as of the punishment proposed to evil doers.

It was a wise Saying of one, that was not the wisest Doctor in his time:
Tractare res humanas norunt plurimi, aestimare pauci: Many there be, that
Cardanus^
have skill enough in humane affairs, that want no wit to atchieve the ends
which they propose to themselves; and yet but a few which know how to esteem or
prize the ends at which they aim, aright. And of all our Errors and Defects,
there be but Two General Roots: The first, An overprizing of secular ends or
contentments: The second, An undervaluing of matters Two Roots of Errors.
Heavenly, specially of Life and Death everlasting.

The true Reason why many, who can discourse well of Heavenly matters (and can
give a reason of their belief, sufficient to convince the Gainsayers of the
truth which they believe) are not so able to take or give the true Estimate of
the things believed, is much what the same with that which Philosophers assign,
Why young men are no fit Auditors of moral Philosophy, or why they prove not so
good Proficients in this study, as in other Arts and Sciences, To learn the
Mathematics, as Arithmetic, or Geometry, young men or children are as apt as
men of mature age: And in natural Philosophy they find no difficulty, save
only want of Experience, which is never attained unto in just and full
measure, without length of time, or competent number of years. Howbeit, in the
former Studies, though all their life time were youth, men might attain to the
same measure of experience, in the same course of time or number of years that
they could if all their life were mature age. But so it is not in moral
Philosophy: What is the reason? The Philosopher tells us, It is, because young
men, or men whose affections are unsettled, can have no taste of moral Goodness,
or of the sweetness of true virtue: And as his Master before him had observed;
Omnis vita gustu quodam ducitur, We must have a Taste or Relish of good or
evil, or else we shall neither follow the one, nor eschew the other, with that
constancy, with that life and courage, which is required to Virtue or Morality.
We may do many good things which a good Christian ought to do, and yet not live
a Christian life: As Herod did (Mark 6. 20.) who
feared and observed Saint John Baptist as a holy Just Man, and heard him
gladly, and when he heard him did many things: yet cut off his head.

7. To lead a Christian life, is more then to be a mere Moral Man, although it
always includes Morality in it: And whatsoever is required to a moral Unbelief
of this Article cause of unchristian careless life.
life, That and more is necessarily required to a Christian and Godly life. And
seeing the framing of a true Christian Life, depends very much upon the true
belief of this Article of Everlasting Life, and Everlasting Death, the most
effectual Method which Gods Ambassadors can use to this end, must be, to
exhibit a true taste or relish of the Goodness contained in the one, and of the
Evil comprised in the other. And this is the Method, which by Gods assistance,
I mean to follow.

First, To set down directions whence or by what means we may take a Taste or
Relish (without danger to our souls) of Everlasting Death.

And Secondly, How the like Taste or Relish may be had of Everlasting Life; or
at the least how we may frame unto our selves a true, (though a short) measure,
by which we may, by diligent meditation, take a better Estimate of Both, then
most men do.

I will begin with The means how to estimate everlasting Death, because it is
much easier to have some Taste or Relish of it, then of everlasting Life.

There is no evil which a man in this life does suffer, no pain or grief, but
may in some sort serve a diligent meditator to take a view or estimate of the
horrors of the second death. But always the greater the evil is, which we have
suffered or have experience of, the more fit measure it is, for calculating the
endless miseries of the Second Death. And, The very cogitation or remembrance
of such particular evils as we have actually suffered, or have experience of,
will be more effectual to withdraw us from those means or practices, which
procure them; then the representation or contemplation of evils in their nature
far greater, but of which we have had no Taste or experience.

8. A Memorable Experiment in this kind we have recorded by Justine (and other
good Writers) of those Scythians, which had waged war so long in Asia, that
their Wives, growing weary of their absence, did marry with their slaves or
bondmen; And their slaves being willing to defend the possessions, which they
had usurpt, took arms against their Masters at their return; But were quickly
routed without stroke of Sword, or dint of Lance, or other usual weapon of war.
In stead of these, their Masters charged them on horseback with whips in their
hands, with success according to their own forecast or expectation. Of hurts
or wounds made by Sword or Lance, as they wisely did forecast, their slaves had
formerly had no experience; they never had felt the smart or grief of either;
But their backs had been accustomed to the scourge or lash, and the very sight
of these weapons, reviving the memory of their former smart, more affrighted
them on a sudden, then any terror of war besides could have done. To have
tried their courage or fortunes, either by push of Pike, or dint of Sword, they
would have been more forward then wiser men. Dulce bellum inexpertis Want of
experience in this kind would have made them, for the first brunt at least,
more insolent and foolhardy; whereas the very sight and noise of the whip,
whereof they had so often tasted, did presently dant them, and make them seek
their security from it by confused flight. The Historical Truth of this
Relation, and good success of their Stratagem, is sealed unto us in the Public
Coin of that Country, whose stamp to this day is a man on Horseback with a
whip in his hand.

9. It would be a great comfort to us, that are Gods Ambassadors, if we could
but persuade men to be as afraid to wrong or deface the monuments of men
deceased, as the modern Turks are to offer the least indignity unto ordinary
papers scattered in the streets; or to be as careful in preserving the Goods of
the Church, as these Infidels are to preserve the least scrap of paper that
would otherwise perish.

What is the reason why they are so careful in these Toys, and we so negligent
in matters of such moment, and the like?

They have a Tradition (whether received from Mahomet himself, or from his
Successors their Mufties, I know not, but a Tradition they have) which they
strongly believe, That before they can enter into such a heaven as they dream
of, they must pass over a long iron grate red hot, without any other fence to
save their naked feet from scorching, save only so much paper as they shall
preserve from perishing. Now of the pains or tortures, which the violent heat
of Iron produces in naked bodies, they have a kind of feeling or experience.
The conceit or Notion of this pain is fresh and lively, and works more strongly
upon their affections, then the dread of hell fire does upon many Christians,
albeit there is no Christian, which does not believe the fire of hell to be
everlasting; whereas the Turk thinks this his supposed Purgatory to be but
temporary, and between pains temporary and pains everlasting there is no
proportion. How then comes it to pass that this superstitious fear of pains but
temporary, should so far exceed our true fear or belief of
pains uncessant and everlasting? Many, which truly believe there is a Hell,
whose fire never goes out, yet conceive this fire to be an immaterial fire, a
fire of whose heat or violence they have no sense or feeling in this life, a
fire altogether unknown unto them: And as no man much desires that good, which
he knows not, how great soever it be; so no man much fears that evil,
whereof he has no sense or feeling, no experimental knowledge, whereby to
measure the greatness of it, but only believes it confusedly or in gross; and
hence it is that the acknowledgment or belief of such a fire, how great soever
it may seem to be in the General abstract conceit, is but like a spacious
Mathematical body, which has neither weight nor motion, which can produce no
real effects in the soul or affections of man. For this reason I have always
held it a fruitless pains, or a needless curiosity to dispute the Question,
Whether the fire of hell be a material fire or no, that is, such a fire as may
be felt by bodily senses; seeing most men conceive no otherwise of things
immaterial or spiritual, then as of Abstract Notions, or of Mathematical
Magnitudes. As the determination of this Question (were it possible in this
life to be determined) would be fruitless: So the chief reason, which some have
brought to prove the Negative, to wit, That it is not a material fire, is of no
force in true Philosophy, much less in Divinity.

10. Their chief Reason is This; That if hell fire were a material or bodily
fire, it could not immediately work upon the soul, which is an immaterial or
spiritual substance. But let them tell us, how it is possible, That the soul of
man, which is an immortal substance, should be truly wedded to the body or
material substance; and I shall as easily answer them, That it is as possible
for the same soul to be as really wrought upon by a material fire. As possible
it is for material fire to propagate death without End to both body and soul;
as it is for the immaterial or immortal soul to communicate life without end to
the material substance of the body. For the bodies of the damned shall never
cease to be material substances, and they shall live to everlasting pains by a
life communicated unto them from their immaterial and immortal souls. And as
the bodies do live continually, by reason of their continual union with their
living immaterial souls; so the soul may die the second death continually, by
its union with, or imprisonment in, material, but everlasting fire. Or if any
man be of opinion, that hell fire is no material fire, or has no resemblance
of that fire, which we see and know, yet let him believe that it is a great
deal worse, and that the greatest torture, which in this life can come by fire,
is, though a true, yet but an imperfect scantling of the torments of the life
to come, and the danger will be less.

Of this opinion were the Ancients, and this conceit or notion of hell fire did
in some, bring forth very good effects. So Eusebius in his Fifth Book and The
Story of Biblis.
first Chapter of his Ecclesiastical Story, tells of one Biblis, a woman, which
had professed Christianity, but was so danted with the cruel persecutions of
Christians, that she renounced her profession, and was brought unto the place,
where the Christians were executed, with purpose to withdraw others from
constancy in their profession by her expected blasphemy against Christ, and
reproachful aspersions upon Christians. But the very sight of those flames,
wherein the Martyrs were tortured, did thoroughly awake her out of her former
slumber; her very fear, or rather conceit of such torments, which they for the
time suffered, did afford her a measure or scantling to calculate the
incomparable torments of hell fire, which, being now awaked, she began to
bethink her self, that she must suffer them without hope of release, if she
should deny Christ or renounce her calling; and thus expelling the lesser fear
by the greater, she resolutely professed her self to be a true Christian in
heart, and so
contrary to the expectation of the persecutors, and her own former resolution,
increased the number of the glorious Martyrs, and encouraged others after her
to endure the Cross.

11. But albeit the Scripture usually describes the horror of the second death
by a fire, which never goes out; or by a lake of fire and brimstone; and so
describes it either because that fire is of such nature and quality, as these
descriptions literally, and without Metaphor, import; or because these are the
most obvious and most conspicuous representations of the pains and horrors of
hell, which flesh and blood are generally most acquainted with, and most afraid
of: yet many other branches of pains and tortures there be, besides those,
which fire, of what kind soever, can inflict; and of these several pains, most
men respectively may have as true a relish or sensible representation, as they
can have of hell fire. You have read before, that as there is See the Chapt. 20.
in this life A body of sin, which has as many members, as there be several
senses, or several faculties of the soul: So there is a body of the second
death, every way proportionable to the body of sin. The extreamitie or
deadliness of all the pains, discontents, or grievances, which are incident to
any bodily sense, or faculty of the soul in this life, are contained either
Formaliter, that is, as we say, in kind, in the body of the second death; or
Eminenter, that is, either in a worse kind, or in a greater measure, then in
this life they could be endured, though but for a minute; and yet must be
endured everlastingly in the life to come, by all such as in this life do not
mortify the whole body of sin, or have it not mortified in them.

Now as of bodily medicines some be General, or as Physicians call them,
Motives from meditation of eternal death, according to general or more
particular tastes of it.
Catholica, such as equally respect the whole body; Others Topical, that is
such as are framed to some special part or member: So likewise of the Medicines
or Receipts, which the meditation upon this Article of Everlasting death
affords; some are General, and indifferently respect every spiritual disease;
and such are the Consideration of the worm which never dies, and of the fire
which never goes out. Others there be, which in special respect particular
diseases of the soul, and are to be applied, as time and occasions require,
unto the several members or affections of the Old man. Some of these particular
medicines are more effectual to cure lust, or Amorousness; others more
effectual to quell gluttony or drunkenness; Others to take down pride or
vanity. That which in respect of one man, or his special disease, is less
effectual, may be more effectual and more sovereign in respect of another. That
which is in it self of less efficacy comparatively, may make deeper impression
and work more strongly upon some man's peculiar disposition, then the greatest
and most terrible object, that can be presented to his sense or to his belief.

12. Parisiensis, (a learned and judicious Divine in his times) Parisiensis his
story.
tells us of a Gentleman of his special acquaintance, which had long warred with
the old man or body of sin, and taken the advice of his confessors or spiritual
Physicians for obtaining the victory over the flesh; yet found himself too weak
to encounter with lust or amorousnes, an affection, which still received
strength or courage from the sight of beauty; until at length he procured a
dead scull of one of the most beautiful creatures, which his eyes had beheld,
and by using this Relic of the first death, as a Memorandum for
representation of the second, he was thoroughly cured of this disease; which,
without cure, would have brought that death upon him. The same cure or medicine
every man that is subject to the like disease cannot hope for, may not attempt:
but every one, that truly believes this Article of everlasting death, may have
a peculiar medicine more effectual to this purpose. Though every one cannot
have a Skeleton or deaths head to look upon with his bodily eyes, yet Faith (as
the Apostle speaks) being the evidence of things not seen;
every one, that has the eyes of his mind enlightened with the least beam of
true faith, may see and consider; that albeit there be no dead sculls or
Skeletons in Hell, yet the very sight or presence of living creatures there, of
such as were their most amiable and pleasant consorts in this life, shall be
more loathsome then any spectacle, then any relics of the first death, which
the grave or Charnell house can afford them. And unto this peculiar disease, or
to the mortification of this particular member of the old man, no meditation or
consideration of any branch of the second death can be more powerful, Then the
Cogitation of the ghastlinesse of that place, and of its Inbabitants.

13. I have read, of a young Gallant, which came upon secular respects, as upon
affinity or old acquaintance, to visit his friend being of a quite contrary
disposition, one of a strict and austere life, whether
upon choice or necessity, I now remember not: but after a long and profane
discourse of the Gallant, which the other would not much interrupt, as well
knowing, that prophanness aegrescit medendo, grows always more desperate by
unseasonable contradiction or importunate persuasions. However, at the close or
leave taking, in stead of a Complement, this religious man requested the
profane Gallant to carry this short Saying in his memory for his sake.

Putredo et vermis operimentum eorum; A seasonable lesson collected out of Job
21. Isai. 14. Ecclus. 19.
That there was a hell prepared for profane men; and that worms and rottenness
should be to them for a covering in stead of clothing. And this brief Receipt
wrought more effectually with him, then if the general terrors of hell had
been rung into his ears thrice a week in a large discourse, or presented to his
eyes in a picture of them. And the reason why this brief Memorandum wrought so
with him, was, because one special branch of his sensuality, was his excessive
or immoderate delight in sweet perfumes, and soft raiment.

14. To instance in more particulars of this kind would be long and tedious;
the General Rule for all is brief. There is no bodily sense or faculty, which
is capable of, or accustomed to, excessive pleasures or extraordinary carnal
contentments, which does not thereby become as capable of the contrary pain or
coffeehouse.

Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae,
Mutatae quatient. Hor. epist. lib. 1. epist. 10.
The greater a man's delight has been in any worldly prosperity, the greater
will his grief or disconsolation be, when the opposite branch of adversity falls
upon him. Man, by natural constitution, as the Philosopher observes, is more
sensible of pain, then of pleasure; matter of pleasure or contentment little
moves us, unless, it be in some excess or quantity more then ordinary. But of
the least degree of pain, or smallest portion of matter of coffeehouse we
are most sensible. Hence was that Saying of the Poet;

Nocet empta dolor voluptas. If every dram of pleasure were to be purchased
with the like quantity of pain, especially incident to the same sense or
faculty, there is no man so sensual or voluptuous, but would be quickly weary
of his course of life. If such as are misled by the curiosity or vanity of the
eye, might have free choice of all the most pleasant spectacles, which this
sense or other faculties which receive contentment by it, could wish to look
upon for a whole day together, all this variety could not recompense one hour
of such Torture as Regulus suffered by this sense alone. If such as are misled
by the sense of Taste, might have Dives's fare, or the most exquisite meats and
drinks, which this present world affords; all this variety could not
countervail the extremity of hunger and thirst for one week. And yet that
Maxim of the Wise man, in quo quisque peccat, in eo punietur, In that wherein a
man most sins, by the same he shall be punished, holds most true in the life to
come, and is most exactly verified in the senses or instruments of unlawful
pleasures.

The Rule of Retaliation, that is, of suiting punishments to the nature and
quality of sins committed, which is often manifested in this life in respect of
grosser or out-crying sins, shall be most strictly observed, when God shall
finally render to every man according to all his ways. He that has offended
most by the vanity of the Eye; shall be especially punished in the eye: He Rev.
18. 5, 6, 7.
that has specially offended in the sense of touch or taste, shall be most
tormented in the instruments of the same senses: and so it shall be in every
other particular sense or faculty, wherein sin has lodged or exercised his
dominion. The hint of this general Rule or doctrine is given unto us by our
Savior in the Parable of the rich Glutton: the principal crime, wherewith he
is expressly taxed, was, his too much pampering of the sense of taste without
compassion of his poor brother, whom he suffered to die for hunger. And the
only punishment which is expressed by our Savior, is the scorching heat of his
tongue, which is the Instrument of taste, and his unquenchable thirst without
so much hope of comfort, as a drop of cold water could afford him, though this
comfort were earnestly begged at the hands, or rather at the finger of Abraham,
who in his life time had been open-handed unto the poor, a man full of bounty,
mercy and pity. But these are works, which follow such, as practice them here
on earth, into heaven, they extend not themselves unto such as are shut up in
that everlasting prison, which is under the earth.

The use of the Taste of Death and pleasures. The Turkish use of Both. How
Christians may get a Relish of Joy Eternal: by peace of Conscience, Joy in the
Holy Ghost, and works of Righteousness. Affliction useful to that purpose.

1. SEeing the Body of the Second Death is in every part proportionable to the
Body of Sin, which, not mortified, does procure it: The Art of Meditation upon
the one branch of this Great Article, (viz. Everlasting Death) must be thus
assisted or deduced.

First, By right fitting or suiting the several members or branches of the
Meditations of the second death to be fitted to several parts of the body of
sin for the mortifying of it.
Second Death unto the several members of the Body of sin. The force or
efficacy of this Medicine depends especially upon the right Application of it:
And the right Application consists in counterpoizing our hopes or desires of
unlawful pleasures, with the just fear of suitable Evils. Now, as the fear of
those evils, whereof we have a distinct or comprehensive notion, has more
weight or force upon our affections, then the fear of evils far greater in
themselves, but of which we have only an indistinct, confused, or general
notion (such as a man blind from his birth may have of colors, which in the
general he knows to be sensible qualities, but what kind of qualities in the
particular he cannot know:) So, of those evils, whereof we have a specifical or
distinct notion, those have the greatest sway upon our several corrupt
affections, which are most directly contrary to our particular delights or
pleasures, which accompany the exercise or motions of the same affections. So,
as the chief, if not the only means, to mortify the several members of the old
man or body of sin, is, to plant the fear of those particular evils in the same
sense or faculty,
by whose peculiar delights or pleasures we find our selves to be most usually
withdrawn from the ways of life. For, the fear of any evil distinctly known,
though in it self more weighty, does not so directly or fully countersway any
delight or pleasure, unless it be seated in the same particular subject with
it, and move upon the same Center. Curiosity of the eye, is not so easily tamed
with any other fear as with fear of blindness. Lust or delight in the pleasures
of the flesh are not so forcibly restrained by any other fear, as by fear of
some loathsome disease, or grievous pain incident to the Instruments or Organs
of such pleasures. Pride and Ambition stand not in so much awe of any other
punishment, as of shame, dis-grace, or dis-respect.

2. But how good soever the Medicine be, it is either dangerous or unuseful,
unless it be applied in due season. The same Physic has contrary effects upon
a full and a fasting stomach. And as a great part of the Art of Husbandry
consists in the observation of times and seasons, wherein to sow or plant: So a
great part of this divine Art of Meditation depends upon our knowledge or
observance of opportunities best fitting the plantation of this fear of
particular evils, which must countersway our inclinations to particular
pleasures. This must be attempted (as we say) in cold blood; and in the Calm of
our affections; or in the absence of strong temptations, which scarce admit of
any other Medicine or restraint, save only flying to the Force of Prayer. It
was a wise Caveat of an heathen, that as often as well call those pleasures or
delights of the body or sense, whereof we have had any former experience, to
mind, we should not look upon them as they did present themselves, or came
toward us; for their face or countenance is pleasant and enticing; But if we
diligently observe them in their passage from us, they are Aristotle
ugly and loathsome, and always leave their sting behind them. And as the
several delightful Objects of every particular outward sense meet in the
internal Common sense or Fantasy: So the dregs or Relics, which every
unlawful pleasure at his departure leaves in the sense or faculty, wherein it
harbored, do all concur to make up the Sting of Conscience; And the Sting of
Conscience (unless we wittingly stifle the working of it) does give the truest
representation of the Second Death, and makes the deepest impression of hell
pains, that in this life can generally be had.

3. There is no man (unless he be given over by God to a reprobate sense) whose
heart will not smite him either in the consciousness of grosser sins, unto
which he has in a lower degree been accustomed, or of usual sins, though for
the quality not so gross. Now if men would suffer their Cogitations to reflect
upon the regretings, which always accompany the accomplishments of unlawful
desires (as frequently and seriously, as they in a manner impel them, to
reflect upon those enticing Objects, which inflame their breasts with such
desires) these cogitations would awake the natural Sting of Conscience, and
This being awakned or quickened, would not suffer them to sleep any longer in
their sins; For the smart or feeling of the Sting of Conscience is as sensible
and lively a Prognostic of the Worm, which never dies (which is the chief
part of the second Death) as heaviness of spirit, or grudgings, are of Fevers
or other diseases, which without preventing Physic or diet do always follow
them.

4. But this Prognostic of the second death, or this fear of hell pains (which
the Sting of Conscience always exhibits) must be warily taken, and weighed
with Judgment. The right observance of them (as every other good quality or
habit) is beset with Two contrary extremes; The one in defect, The other in
excess. The defect is Carelessness, The excess Despere, or too much dejection
of mind.

The intimations or Prognostics, which the Sting of Conscience exhibits of
death spiritual, are often mistaken for the effects of bodily melancholy, and
the best medicine for melancholy is pleasant society or mirth. Out of this See
Chap. 10. 9, 10.
mistaking, most men prevent that Compassion, which is due to their own souls,
after such a manner as Jewish parents did prevent their natural pity toward
their children, when they sacrificed them unto Molech; by filling their ears
with the loud sound of wind Instruments, lest the shrikes of the Infants (whom
they enclosed in an Image of hot glowing brass) by entering in at their ears
might move their Jewish hearts to pity. And most men, lest they should be stung
with grief of spirit or conscience, seek to stifle their first murmurings
and repinings either with unhallowed, or unseasonable mirth.

Others by seeking to avoid this common extreme, often fall into the contrary,
which is of the Two the worse; to wit, dispere, or too much dejection of spirit.

That which the Heathen observed of grief in General, is most true of this
Particular, the grief of a Wounded Spirit. Dolori si fraena remitt as, nulla
materia non est maxima. If we let loose the reins to grief or sorrow, the least
matter or occasion of either, will be more weighty then we can well bear. Man's
unbridled fancy is as a multiplying Glass, which represents every thing, as
well matter of sorrow as of pleasure, in a far greater quantity, then it really
has. And unless our Cogitations or sad remembrances of sins past be moderated
with Judgment and discretion, they will appear to our fancies, like Cains
transgression, greater then can be forgiven, or then we can hope that the God
of mercy will forgive. For holding the right mean betwixt these Extrems,
Carelessness and despere, there is no means so effectual as to be rightly
instructed in the hope of everlasting Life, and Fear of everlasting death.
Immature or unripe hopes of the One ingendereth carelessness or presumption; so
does erroneous fear Avoid here the presumptuous persuasion of certain salvation
and the conceit of Absolute reprobation. See Book 10. Chap. 37. 51.
of the other bring forth despere.

He that is persuaded that every one always is in the Estate of the Elect or of
the Reprobate, cannot avoid the one or other extreme: And the only remedy to
prevent despere or being swallowed up with grief, either in the consciousnes of
grosser sins lately committed, or whiles we reflect upon sins past, is, to
purge our selves of that Erroneous Opinion concerning Absolute Reprobation, or
irreversible ordination to death, before we were born, or from the time of our
second birth by baptism.

5 To purge our brain or fancy of this opinion, let us take the form and Tenor
of the Final sentence into consideration; which we may do without digression or
diversion. Both branches of this sentence we have, Mat. 25. The
first branch, ver. 34. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand,
Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world; he does not say, before all worlds, though this in a
good sense is true, most true, if we speak of Gods design or Act; for all his
Acts or designs are as he is, Eternal, without beginning: so are not the
things designed or enacted by him: they take their beginning in time, or with
time. The Kingdom prepared for Gods people was prepared when the world was
made, not before; so good and gracious was our God, that he did not make man or
Angel until he had prepared a place convenient for them; take them as they
were his creatures, or workmanship, and they were all ordained to a life of
bliss. Paradise was made for man, and it may be after man was made, but the
Heaven of Heavens was prepared for man before he was Purge our Brains of The
Erroneous Opinion of the Irrespective Decree.
made, and made for the Angels, if not before they were made, yet when they
were made. But the Sentence of death, ver. 41. runs in another Tenor; Depart
from me ye cursed into everlasting fire; he does not say prepared for you from
the foundation of the world, but, prepared for the Devil and his angels. Those
immortal spirits, which now are devils, were sometime Angels; God made them so;
They made themselves devils. Now hell fire was not prepared for them, whilst
they were Angels, not from the foundation of the world, but from the time,
wherein of Angels they became Devils: Nor are men at all ordained to it, until
of men they become Satan's angels. And as Satan and his angels (the spirits
which fell with him) continue the self same individual substances, which they
were, when God first created them; yet are no way the same, but quite contrary
for quality and disposition; so the place whereto they are confined, may be
for substance, space, and dimension the same it was at the first creation, but
not the same for quality; it became a prison or place of torment when Satan and
other spirits, which fell with him, of Angels made themselves Devils. Satan (as
some think) brought that fire wherein he and his Angels shall be tormented,
into the bowels of the earth, when he fell like lightning from heaven: However,
if the Angels had not sinned, there had been no hell, no tormenting fire: and
unless men become the Devils Angels, they shall not be cast into hell fire. God
does not ordain men to be Satan's angels, but men continuing his sons or
servants, God ordaines them to take their portion with him.

So that if we remove the opinion of Absolute-Reprobation, or of irreversible
ordination of men's persons unto death, before they were baptized or born; or if
men would be confirmed in faith, that no such Sentence or Decree is gone out
against them whilst they have either will, desire, or opportunity to call upon
God through Jesus Christ for remission of sins, whether by confession of them,
or by absolution from them upon such confession, or by receiving the Sacrament
of Christ's body and blood, no danger can accrue from the frequent meditation of
everlasting death, or from such representations Meditations or a Taste of
Eternal death here, fits us better for a taste of eternal life hereafter.
of the horrors of it, as the often reflecting upon our sins past, and the
working of the Sting of Conscience, upon such reflections, will present unto us.

6. Another excellent Use, and that a Positive One, there is of these
meditations. For no man ordinarily can have a true Taste or relish of Eternal
Life, but he, which has had some Taste or grudging of everlasting death. The
sense, or Taste, or Overture, of the second death does make the least relish of
the second resurrection unto Life to seem more sweet and pleasant. Now it is
the relish or secret intimation of Celestial joys, which must animate and
encourage us to undertake all the dangers or discontents, wherewith the way
unto the heavenly Canaan (the land of promise and of our rest) is beset. The
most forcible Reasons, which the Divinest Orator can use, or the best words,
wherewith he can apparel his reasons or persuasions, are but vain, unless he
can with them or by them instill this secret taste or relish into men's souls.
All the descriptions, which the Leaders of the Gauls could make, of the
pleasures or Commodities of Italy; all the news or reports, which they could
devise or cause to be made in their public meetings, as it were upon our
Royal Exchange, could not so much animate their followers to adventure upon the
strait and difficult passages over the Alps, as did the taste of the Italian
Grape. And that, which did especially aggravate the Israelites Dastardy for not
undertaking that sacred war, whereunto God had called them, against the
Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hittites, etc. was the sight of those Grapes,
which, such as were sent to discover that good Land, had brought from Eschol.
Their unusual greatness, which all the host might have seen; and their
extraordinary relish, which many did or might have tasted, was a pledge or
assurance of the truth of Gods promises concerning the fertility or
pleasantness of that Land. For as we say Ex ungue Leonem; The terror of the
Lion, which we never saw, may be taken from his paw: Or as Pythagoras did take
the just quantity of Hercules his body by the print of his foot; so might the
Israelites have taken the true estimate of the Land of Canaan from the unusual
quality and extraordinary quantity of that bunch of grapes, which their
mutinous spies or Intelligencers could not deny to be the native fruit of that
soil. But of the Israelites disobedience and dastardy, and what both these and
the slanderous reports, which their spies or intelligencers did raise of that
good Land, mystically import, we shall take occasion, if God permit, hereafter
to handle.

7. Such a pledge as these Israelites had of Gods promises concerning the Land
of Canaan, we may have, and must have of the pleasures of the Celestial Canaan,
before we become valorous in our undertakings for it. And if we once attain to
a true Taste or relish of its goodness; the least portion of it will serve as a
true measure to notify the incomparable excess of those joys in comparison of
any earthly pleasures or annoyances, the one or other of which, and nothing
besides them, can occasion our diversion from the ways, which lead unto them.

The force or efficacy, which experienced pleasures or contentments have The
force which the Taste of experienced pleasures has upon men's souls.
upon men's souls or affections, Mahomet and his successors too well foresaw,
and so by a known representation of a counterfeit heaven, and by a real and
experienced taste of imaginary or feigned pleasures in the life to come, did
make their followers more zealous and confident in propagating their Empire and
Religion, then either Christian Preachers or Magistrates can make their
Christian people. The obedience of Turkish children to their parents, of their
greatest Nobles to their Sovereign, of their soldiers to their Commanders, of
inferior Commanders to their Superiors or Generals, far exceeds any obedience,
which we Christians usually perform See Book. 10. fol. 3181.
to our Superiors in what kind soever. One Erroneous principle notwithstanding
they have, That all things are so decreed by God as nothing can fall out
otherwise then it does: and from this prejudicate conceit, when opportunity
suggests fair hopes unto the son of obtaining his fathers Crown, they account
it no sin, but a religious Act, for the Son to depose the Father, as presuming
it is Gods Will thus to have it, whenever he offers opportunity. But when
there is no hope to gain a Crown by rebellion, no intimation given by the
signs of the time, that God will prosper their attempts against their
Superiors, there is no subject in any Christian Kingdom, that will accept the
greatest dignity, whereto his Sovereign Lord can advance him, with such Loyal
respect and submission, as the sons or grandchildren of their Emperors will
embrace the sentence of death, though no way deserved, only in obedience to his
designs and pleasure. There is no malefactor amongst us, though openly
convicted of capital crimes, that will submit himself to the sentence of the
Law, with that cheerfulness of mind, or unregreting affections, as their
inferior Commanders or common soldiers will surrender their lives into their
Superiors hands, be the service whereunto they appoint them never so dreadful
or desperate.

8. Now the great motives by which Turkish Priests or their Magistrates work
this absolute submission and complete obedience in inferiors, is either fear of
Hell or torments after this life in case they shall disobey; or hopes of Heaven
if they continue loyal and obedient; and yet the hell, which they fear, is no
way so terrible as that Hell, with whose torments we daily threaten the
disobedient: Their hopes of heaven are nothing so glorious, as those hopes,
which God promises, and we profess we believe them to be the reward of our
obedience to our God, to our Prince, and to his just Laws, whether
Ecclesiastic or Civil. Whence then does this great difference or odds arise
between their obedience and ours? From no other root then this. They propose
unto their followers such an heaven, such contentments after this life, as they
may have a true taste or relish of in this life, by whose multiplication the
incomparable excess of future contentments in respect of present, may by
ordinary capacities be easily taken. There is no delight or pleasure, which men
in this world can take in the days of plenty, security, and peace; no
pleasures of the outward senses, of touch or taste, which they do not hope to
enjoy in far greater measure in heaven without annoyance, interruption or
disturbance, then their Emperor or Grand-Segnior in this life can do. The
meanest amongst them persuades himself he shall have more consorts or
concubines, then their Luxurious Emperors have, all more beautiful then any
earthly creatures can be. There is no delight again in War or feats of arms,
which their Common soldiers hope not to enjoy, without danger or defatigation
of their bodies, in far greater measure, then the greatest Commanders or
Generals of their Armies do. And being thus possessed with this Two fold
persuasion, First, That Obedience to Superiors does merit heaven: Secondly,
That the joys of heaven are for nature and quality the same with such earthly
pleasures and contentments, which they have tasted, but infinitely exceed them
for quantity and duration; To persuade them, to lay down this life in hope of
attaining the life to come, by obedience to their Emperors, or in love to
their Religion, is a matter of no greater difficulty, then to induce a Merchant
to lay out an hundred pounds sterling in his own Country; upon such assurance
as this world affords, to receive ten thousand pounds either in the same coin,
or in valuable commodities in another Country by way of return or bill of
exchange.

9. But as for us Christians, albeit our hopes of heaven be far more glorious
then theirs can be; albeit our Faith, which is the ground of our hopes, be most
firm and sound (whereas their belief of such a heaven as they hope for, is but
grounded upon the sand) yet in as much as the most part of Christians have no
distinct conceit or notion of the heavenly joys, which they hope for, but
believe them only in general or in gross to be exceeding great; their Faith is
in a manner but dead, their Hopes have no operations upon their affections,
they do not sway them to constancy in any honorable adventures or undertakings
for the heavenly Canaan. We, that be Gods Ambassadors may spend our spirits and
our breaths, and be answered only with Religion consisting in words, or with a
zeal of hearing Gods Word, not of doing it. The Case of most Hearers is much
what like to the Case of a man extremely sick and oppressed with distempered
humors. There is no man so sick (unless he be possessed with deep melancholy or a
frenzy) but will acknowledge in the general, that such a Diet, as his
Physician prescribes him, is good; that such meats, as he sees men in health
to feed upon with delight, are pleasant and useful for preserving health. But
press him to make his words good by his practice in particular, and you shall
find a Real Contradiction; those meats which out of his former experience he
acknowledges to be sweet and pleasant, are to him in this distemper and
indisposition of body, bitter and abominable. The best Diet, which the
Physician can prescribe him, is nothing so welcome to him, as those meats and
drinks, which the distempered humor longs after. And albeit you urge him with
the authority of Hypocrates, Galen, or other famous Professors of Physic, yet
you shall not persuade him to follow their Counsel, until he have in some
measure recovered his Taste; and the only means to recover it, must be, by the
removing the noxious humor, wherewith it is oppressed. Yet such as are bodily
sick have had some Taste and experience of wholesome food in the time of their
health: for bodily health ordinarily goes before bodily sickness. But, The
spiritual diseases of our Consciences have precedencie of spiritual health; we
all are soulsick from our birth, even in the womb. And for this reason it is,
That to work a Longing in us after a spiritual health, or to bring us in love
with true spiritual food, is a matter of far greater difficulty, then to bring
a man bodily sick unto a liking of wholesome bodily food. We may persuade Men in
the General, That the joys of heaven infinitely exceed all the pleasures of
this life; And thus far they will easily believe us; But without some Taste or
relish of them, no man will set his heart to seek after them.

10. For us to give men, or men to take A True Relish of them, it is not
(ordinarily) possible, until our hearts and consciences be in some good measure

disburthened of fleshly lusts, of worldly desires; or freed from minding
earthly matters. The ordinary Physic, which God does use in working this First
Cure, is some Cross, affliction or chastisement. Every Cross or branch of
affliction, which in this life can befall us, is in the intention of Gods
providence, as a peculiar Medicine to purge our souls of some one vain delight
or other.

Now, If we would seriously ruminate upon the particular afflictions, which
befall us, or suffer the sting of conscience to have its work whenever our
hearts do The use of affliction to that purpose.
smite us; This would be a good preparation for the recovery of our spiritual
Taste; without whose recovery, we cannot be purified according to the
purification of the Sanctuary.

But, say the Lord has laid no cross, no affliction upon us, yet this is a
Diet so necessary for the soul, That every one, in case the Lord do not, must
afflict his own soul; that is, he must sometimes humble himself in fasting and
prayer; for this, in the language of Canaan, is to afflict the soul: without
such exercises voluntarily undertaken (not as meritorious or profitable in
themselves, but as useful for enjoying of our selves, and the gaining of free
and retired thoughts) our spiritual Taste is not usually recoverable; or, being
in some measure recovered, cannot be preserved.

But you will ask, Wherein does this spiritual Taste consist? what is the object
of it? or that which answers unto it, as bodily food does unto bodily taste? or
What is the best diet for recovering of it?

This you are to learn from our Apostle, Romans 14. 17. The Kingdom of God is not
meat and drink; it neither consists in our use or abstinence from these: what
is it then? Righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. These words (if
you mark them) are well placed: First Righteousness; Then, peace; lastly, Joy
in the holy Ghost. For as the Prophet had said long before, Opus That Taste is
the peace of conscience and joy in the holy Ghost, to which the working of
righteousness is necessary.
justitiae pax: Peace, the peace of conscience toward God, toward men, and
with our own souls and affections, is the resultance or work of righteousness,
as it is opposed unto iniquity. For, There is no peace to the wicked, says my
God, Esai. 57. 21. Joy there may be without this peace or serenity of
conscience; but no Joy in the Holy Ghost without it. Peace of conscience is as
the first Taste or smell of eternal rest; The first sign or Symptom of
spiritual health restored. Joy in the Holy Ghost is to the soul as that
cheerfulness or liveliness, which accompanies perfect health, is unto the
body. Righteousness, or its works, are as the food or diet, by which this
spiritual health and liveliness of the soul is procured.

11. So then he that desires to have a true Taste of the heavenly gift, or of
the powers of the life to come, must enure himself to the works of
righteousness, of that Universal Righteousness, whose practice is commended
unto us in the Affirmative and positive precepts of the first and second Table.
The work of righteousness universal obedience.
It is not enough to abstain from the evil works prohibited in the Negative
precepts of both Tables. This abstinence is as the matter or privation of that
true righteousness, whereof peace is the work or fruit. Howbeit even this
Inchoative Righteousness, or imperfect Embryon of it, is seldom or never framed
and conceived without some chastisement or correction; which are as gentle
Remembrancers of the horrors of the second death Nor is this Inchoative The
use of affliction or chastisement to that purpose
or privative righteousness always framed by chastisements or such
remembrances, but, by patient suffering of them, or by embracing them, as so
many tokens or pledges of our heavenly Fathers providence and loving care over
us. Hence says our Apostle, Heb. 12. 7. If you endure chastisement, God
deals with you as with sons; for what son is he, whom the Father chastises
not? Surely no gracious or beloved son: so the same Apostle had said, ver. 6.
Whom the Lord loves he chastneth, and scourges every son, whom he receives.
Sons then he has whom he does not receive, because they will not endure
chastisement or receive correction from him with submission and patience. These
he gives over as degenerate and lost sons. And there is not a more fearful
sign of Gods displeasure toward men, then his long-suffering of them without
chastisement. If ye be without chastisement (says the Apostle,
Heb. 12. 8.) whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons: But
if all be partakers of it, how can any be without it? Yes, they are without
chastisement, which will not patiently suffer it; which will not embrace it as
a pledge, of their heavenly Fathers love, and these are bastards. What is that?
A bastard is a son, but (in the language of men;) unlawfully begotten. Has God
any such sons or children? God forbid! All are his sons, all are his children
by right of Creation, and by right of Redemption; and both these are lawful
titles of Father-hood and dominion over us. Bastards then they are, who refuse
chastisement, in this sense only, that they are stubborn and disobedient, or
misaffected toward the Father of mankind: They imagine him not to be so kind
and loving to all his sons, not to themselves in particular, as earthly parents
are to their lawfully begotten children. This is that imputation, which our
Apostle seeks to avert from God, or rather that suspicion, which he seeks to
remove from all, who call him their Father, and that by an Argument, as the
Schools speak, a Fortiore, ver. 9, 10. Furthermore, we have had Fathers of our
flesh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather
be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a
few days chastened us as seemed good unto them (sometime perhaps without
actual intendment, or express foresight of any good unto us) but he, to wit,
our heavenly Father, chastises us for our profit, that we might be partakers
of his holiness.

12. The End of his chastisement is always This; That we may serve him in
Righteousness, and have our fruit unto Holiness, whose End is everlasting Life.
And One chief part of our Righteousness consists in the patient submission of
our selves unto his chastisements.

The first part of Righteousness in respect of what Law soever, is, not to
transgress the Law:

The second is, to submit our selves unto the penalty, which the Law inflicts,
in case we transgress it.

To plead the former part of this Righteousness, in respect of Gods Law, we
cannot; To perform the second part of it we are bound upon pain of losing our
right of sons. The penalty of disobedience to it, or refusal of chastisements
in this life, is The woeful estate of bastards or of Sons disinherited.

The sum of that, which has been said concerning our meditation of the second
death (especially as this Meditation is A Preparative to the works of
Righteousness or of Holiness) is excellently comprised by our Apostle, Heb. 12.
11. Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous;
nevertheless, afterward, it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness,
unto them, which are exercised thereby. The burnt child, as we say, dreads the
fire; and he is more then a child, a very Infant, or witless child, which will
not avoid the scorching flames of it, by the experience which he has of its
heat. Now there is no chastisement, no correction, that is grievous for the
present, but ought to be as a Gentle Remembrancer unto us of hell pains, or
such a fair Caveat for avoiding them, as the experienced heat of visible and
known fire
(unto him that stands near it) is of the harms, which it would procure, if he
should be cast into it. And if we would make this or the like use of all the
crosses and afflictions, of all the bodily pains and grievances, of all the
perplexities of mind or conscience, which in this life we suffer, we should be
more careful then we are to avoid the temptations, by which Satan seeks to draw
us into that everlasting fire, which is prepared for him and his angels. This
abstinence from evil is the First branch of our patience in affliction; The
second is the fruit of righteousness.

But I suppose the Reader will desire a further Taste, First, Of the peace of
Conscience. Secondly, Of that joy in the holy Ghost wherein the Kingdom of
heaven consists. And the Explication of these Two great Points follows in the
next Chapter.

In the Interim, the best Use, which can be made of the Doctrine hitherto
delivered, is made unto our hands by our Apostle himself, Heb. 12. 12, 13, 14.
Wherefore lift up the hands, which hang down, and the feeble knees: and make
straight paths for your feet, lest that, which is lame, be turned out of the
way, but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with all men, and holiness,
without which no man shall see the Lord. Looking diligently lest any man fail
of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and
thereby many be defiled. Lest there be any Fornicator or profane person, as
Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know that after
when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no
place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

CHAP. XXV.
ROMANS 6. 22. But now -- ye have your fruits unto Holiness and the end
everlasting Life, etc.
The Coldness of our Hope of Life Eternal causes deviation from the ways of
Righteousness, and is caused by our No-Tast or spiritual disrelish of that
Life. The work of the Ministry is to plant this Taste, and to preserve it in
Gods people. Two Objects of this Taste: 1. Peace of Conscience. 2. Joy in the
Holy Ghost. That Peace may best be shadowed out unto us in the known sweetness
of Temporal Peace. The Passions of the natural man are in a continual mutiny.
To men that yet have no experience of it, The nature of Joy in the Holy Ghost
may be best exemplified by that cheerful gladness of Heart which is the fruit
of Civil Peace. It is the Prerogative of man to Enjoy himself and to possess
his own soul. In the knowledge of any Truth there is Joy. But True Joy is only
in the Knowledge of Jesus Christ and of saving Truths. The Difference betwixt
Joy and Gladness in English, Greek, and Latin.

1. THe very Hope of Life Eternal would be of it self sufficient to
counterpoize all the pleasures, and all the grievances incident to this mortal
life (by the one or other of which our souls and affections are withdrawn from
pursuit of that happy and blessed life, which has its beginning here on earth,
but has no End in Heaven;) were the Belief of it firmly rooted in our souls.
If any man swerve from the ways of righteousness, whether in the General
course of his life, or in particular Acts, it is through want of this Hope
either in the Act or in the Habit. The want of this Hope in the Habit proceeds
from habitual want of our spiritual Taste: The want of the same Hope in
particular Acts proceeds from the interruption of this Taste in such as
sometimes have been partakers of it.

The chief part then of our Ministry is, First, To plant This Taste: Secondly,
To preserve it in our hearers. In these Two consists Tota Ars Medendi; the
whole method of spiritual Physic. The objects of our spiritual Taste are Peace
and Joy in the Holy Ghost; for in these two consists the Kingdom of God (as was
observed before out of Romans 14. 17.) Without Righteousness, there is no Peace;
Without Peace of conscience, there is no Joy. First (then) of Peace: Secondly
of Joy.

2. Under the name of Peace, All blessings spiritual are included: It is the
Fruit of Righteousness, and the Root or stem of Joy. The best tidings, which
the Angels could bring unto the people at our Saviors birth, were tidings of
Joy; And in their hymn, after they had ascribed Glory to God, they declare the
Original of this Joy to be Peace on earth, and Good Will toward men. The best
Legacy which our Savior had to bestow upon his Apostles before his death
(after he had, as it were, made his last Will and Testament) was Peace, John
14. 27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world
gives give I unto you, Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
afraid. And at his first appearance to his Disciples being assembled together
after his Resurrection, he came and stood in the midst of them, and said, John
20. 19. Peace be with you. And after he had showed them his hands and his side,
he said to them again, Peace be unto you, ver. 21. The same Salutation is
recorded by Saint Luke Chap. 24. 36. And this Salutation is continued to the
Church as the sum and brief of all good things which we can desire for our
selves or wish to others. Peace be to this House and to all that dwell in it,
Be the very solemn words, which, The Priest going to visit the sick, is, by the
appointment of our Church, to take with him, and to say when he enters into the
sick persons house. And this (I suppose) is enjoined, not so much with
reference to The like form of Salutation commonly used among the Jews, as,
either in Imitation of that Form of Blessing prescribed by our Savior; or
(rather) in obedience and observation of that Precept given by Him (Matthew. 10.
12. Luke 10. 5.) Salute the House ye enter into: and, Say, Peace be to this
House. And so likewise (by the Churches Appointment) we conclude our prayers,
The peace of God (that is,) The Peace wherein the Kingdom of God consists)
which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge of
God and of his Son Jesus Christ, etc. The Form of this Blessing is taken from
our Apostle, Phil. 4. 7. And therein we do but pray for that which the Apostle
promises (in Gods name) to the Philippians.

3. But if this Peace (as our Apostle there speaks) surpasses all
understanding, how shall we seek after it or discover the nature of it? or the
nature How the Peace of God passes all understanding.
of that joy in the holy Ghost, which is the fruit of it? Or is this Peace and
this Joy (one, or both of them) that New Name (written in the white stone
Revel. 2. 17.) Which Christ promises to give to him that overcomes, which no
man knows saving he which has it? For Answer, we say, This Peace surpasses
the understanding of all men, who are not acquainted with it; But if it must
keep our hearts, and minds through Jesus Christ, sure we must have an
experimental knowledge of it; we must feel and perceive it. So in effect the
Prophet Esaias had said, Esaias 64. 4. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of any man the things which God has prepared for
them which love him. But all this is to be understood of the Natural Man, or of
the man as yet not partaker of the spirit of regeneration. For as the Apostle
tells us, 1 Cor. 2. 10. God has revealed these things even unto us by his
spirit; for the spirit searches all things, yea the deep things of God. And
Again, ver. 12. We have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit,
which is of God; that we may know the things, that are freely given to us of
God. The same spirit gives us a true relish of that Peace whence these joys do
spring.

4. But if such as have the Taste or Relish of it know it better by experience,
then they can by any Map or description of it; How shall we persuade such as do
not know it to seek after it? Or what description shall we make of it, to bring
them in love with it? The best Description, which we can make of it, must be
taken from the known sweetness of Temporal Peace, which is but the Emblem or
shadow of it. And the sweetness of Civil peace is always much better known,
much better esteemed Carendo, quam Fruendo, by some interposition of want, then
by continual fruition of it. A consuet is nulla fit passio. We of this land,
which have longer enjoyed Civil Peace without interruption, then any Nation in
the world besides, have not so true a relish of the sweetness of it, as most
of our neighbor Nations, which, within these few years have often felt the
bitterness of war, as well domestic or Civil, as Foreign. Necessary
therefore it will be for us, which neither have seen or felt the enemies Sword
for these Threescore years and more, to use This was written thirty years ago,
or more.
some Fiction of War for right conceiving the sweetness even of Civil Peace.

Imagine then we lived in such a Land or State, as the State of Israel was in
the days, wherein Esaias prophesied, or in the days whereof he prophesied,
Chap. 9. ver. 19. 20. Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the Land
darkened, and the People shall be as the fuel of the fire, no man shall spare
his brother: And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry, and he shall
eat on the left hand, and shall not be satisfied, they shall eat every man the
flesh of his own arm; Manasses shall be ready to devour Ephraim his brother
Tribe, and Ephraim's intentions against him shall be as cruel, and yet both,
like Simeon and Levi, brethren only in mischief and cruelty, shall conspire to
ruinate Judah the sovereign Tribe of that people.

Thus imagine the Port Towns in this Kingdom were noysom neighbors to one
another by sea, one Shire or Province ready to make inroads or invasion upon
another: or every man's hand in the same Town or Shire to be lift up against his
neighbor, or that a man's worst enemies were of his own house: So many Servants,
Inmates or Sojourners, so many Thieves; the children ready to rob and spoil
their parents without hope of redress by ordinary process of wholesome Laws;
Might still overcoming Right.

Besides all this, imagine a foreign potent Enemy lying still in wait to take
all advantages, which these civil broils or intestine dissensions afford for
subduing the whole State or Nation, for bringing the Nobles into Captivity, for
putting such, as made resistance, unto the sword; to put their children to
death before their parents eyes, and to abuse the bodies of the wives and
daughters of such as put themselves upon their courtesy.

If, unto a State or Kingdom in this distress or perplexity through civil
dissension and domestic broils, any hope of Peace and unity amongst
themselves could be truly suggested, how beautiful would the feet of such as
brought these glad tidings be? And if these hopes were seconded with answerable
success, I leave it to your mature consideration, what public joy and
exultation would ensue; Every man would be ready to bear his part in that song.

Nulla salus bello; pacem te poscimus omnes. Of Civil dissension there can no
good come; the very mention of war would be as the rubbing of an unhealed
wound or bleeding Scar: Dulce nomen pacis, the very name of Peace would
ensweeten our thoughts, season our cogitations, and add strength and courage to
our mutual endeavors for the establishment of it.

5. Now though civil and intestine broyls are much worse then open war with a
foreign Enemy; yet the most perfect pattern of misery, which we can frame unto
our selves, as effects of civil dissensions within any City or Kingdom, is but
a Model or picture of that intestine war, which every man (if we take him in
the state of nature, or before he be reconciled to God through Christ) may find
within himself, within his own soul and affections. For, Every Man is a little
World or Commonwealth, and the less the state or sovereignty is, wherein civil
dissension is bred and nourished, the more grievous it is. It is more dangerous
when fire does kindle in the same street or neighbor houses, then when it it
kindles afar off, though in the same Town; but when the house wherein we dwell
is set on fire, the danger is greatest. But most bitter and grievous is that
dissension or distraction, which is bred and nourished in the same breast, as
either between the affections and passions, The Tumult and discord of Passions
in a natural man.
which lodge in the sensitive part; or between them and the reasonable soul or
conscience; or the perpetual conflict between the flesh and the spirit. Now,
The affections and passions of every dissolute ill nurtured man (as the Heathen
Philosopher had observed) (...), are in continual mutiny amongst themselves.
Immoderate desire or hope of gain sways the one way, and the like desire of
other carnal contentments, which cannot be procured without cost or charge,
sways the contrary way. The love of rest and ease inclines the soul one way,
and desire of credit and fame another; hopes or opportunities See Book 10. Fol.
3056. See Hor. Sermon. Lib. 2. Sat. 7. See Pers. Sat. 5.
of satisfying lust are still encountered with fear of shame. Ambition hales the
soul upwards, and fear of loss or danger draws it downwards: So that the soul
of a man, not yet reconciled to God, is still (as it were) upon the Rack; One
while it takes pleasure in the good things, which it self injoyes; and the more
it takes delight in these, the more it is tortured with envy against others,
which enjoy the same or like good things in a greater measure. Or if it were
possible for a natural man to compose or hush these mutinies between his
several affections, or to draw all his passions or desires unto one head or
bent, yet this Peace of the affections and passions among themselves, uless the
Conscience were included in it (which it never can be in the natural man) is
but A Dishonorable Peace, and that is much worse, then an honorable war.
Better it were that a man's desires or passions should band each against other,
then that all of them should with joint force band against the spirit or
Conscience. This would be but as a conspiracy of common Soldiers against
their Leaders, or as a league or confederacy of Slaves against their Lords, or
of Subjects against their Sovereign and their Magistrates; Or such a peace as
the Roman Orator did dissuade the Romans from. Pax cum Antonio non est pax sed
pactio servitutis; To make peace with Mark Anthony a turbulent and seditious
Peer, was but to condition for their Slavery.

6. Whether then our affections, our desires or passions, be at enmity one with
another; or, whether being at peace one with another, they be not in subjection
unto reason or conscience (as they never are in a man not reconciled to God, or
in a man, which follows not the ways of righteousness:) Every branch of the
one or other enmity within a man's self, does as it were make a Breach for the
common enemy to enter at, who wants no skill, no industry, no vigilance to work
upon all opportunities or advantages, for bringing both body and soul, both the
reasonable and the affective part, both the flesh and the spirit into
everlasting slavery. No foraign Enemy, not the Turk or Mahumetan, can harbor
such cruel intentions against any Christian State or Kingdom (no not in his
passions or furious mood) as this adversary, Satan, does against us all,
Christians, Jews, or Turks, even when he complies with us, or seems to be at
peace, and promises the best contentments, which he is permitted to bestow
upon his followers. It was his Catechism unto Judas to cover his murtherous
intentions with a fawning kiss; The Master knew this lesson much better then
the Scholar did, and can practice it with more Art and Skill upon Christ's
Scholars, then his Scholar Judas did upon our Lord and Master. Of this civil
dissension or intestine war between the several affections of our souls, or
between them and our spirits and consciences, and of the danger, which by this
dissension (unless it be timely appeased) may certainly accrue unto the whole
nature from the common adversary, Every man may have a sensible experiment in
himself, so he would in vacant and sequestered hours unpartially take the
information of his own spirit and Conscience: and the reflection or ruminating
upon the inconveniences of these civil dissentions or intestine wars within our
own souls, will kindle in us a desire of spiritual Peace, and a resolution to
follow the ways, which lead unto it; And these are the Works of
Righteousness. Such as are not yet at Peace with God; many whose affections
are not at Peace one with another, nor with their own Consciences (which should
command in chief) may be safe or free from any present evil, from any wound as
yet given by this adversary; But no man living can be secure from future danger
or misery, until he be thus far at least entered into the Kingdom of God, as
that he has some impression or relish of that Peace. His soul and spirit must
be brought in subjection to the Spirit of God; so must his affections or
desires be subject to his reasonable soul or spirit, before he can know this
Peace by experience, or taste the fruit of it, which is, Joy in the Holy Ghost.

7. But, Wherein does this Joy in the Holy Ghost consist? Seeing it is the Of
joy in the Holy Ghost.
issue or fruit of Spiritual Peace; The nature of it cannot be better
exemplified (specially to such as know it not by experience) then by that known
joy of heart or gladness, which is the fruit of civil or temporal Peace: And
the fruits of this Peace are pithily described by the Prophet, When every man
may sit under his own Vine, and under his own Fig Tree; that is, (to give you
the importance of this Proverbial speech in plain English) When every man may
reap the fruits of his own labors or employments, or of the labors,
employments, or increase of other Creatures, which God has put in subjection
to him; when he may so reap them without molestation, without danger of
annoyance. It is not the Possession of Lands, of Wares, or other good things
whatsoever we are lawfully entitled unto, but the quiet Fruition or enjoying of
them, which fills our hearts with gladness: To have a full Flock, and to be
deprived of the milk and of the increase of it; to have a goodly Vineyard, and
to be debarred from gathering the grapes of it, is matter of sorrow and grief,
A principal calamity of War: But to enjoy these and the like commodities,
without danger or molestation, is a special Comfort of temporal or civil Peace.
And in as much as no man can truly enjoy those good things (which he possesses
or has right unto) but in time of civil Peace; Hence it is, that under the
name of this Peace, all good things Temporal are contained, for without Peace
we cannot enjoy them.

And this is the Prerogative of man above all visible Creatures, that the fruit
which other such Creatures do bring forth, they do not bring it forth unto
themselves, but unto man, and for his use either mediately or immediately. The
Fields yearly bring forth grass, or other wild herbs, for the food of other
living Creatures; but even those Creatures, with their fruits or increase,
serve for the use of man: Quicquid acquirunt, acquirunt Domino. The Sheep being
nourished by the grass of the Field, yields his yearly fleece, not so much for
his own use, as for the use of Man: The Bees in Summer gather honey, but Man is
principal partaker of the sweetness of it. These and other like sensitive
Creatures, how much soever they multiply and increase, are never their own, but
their owners; that is, some one or other Man's: yet not their Owners, unless it
be in time of Civil Peace. Contention, whether it be by open Hostility of War,
or by course of Law, always deprives men of the fruition or enjoyment of those
good things, which are their own, though not always of the possession of them:
By Peace only we enjoy those things, which are our own by right of Title and
Possession; so that Civil or temporal Peace, is the only noursing Mother of
civil or temporal joy or gladness.

8. But albeit every one, the meanest amongst us, could not only quietly
possess, but peaceably enjoy this whole visible world (such as it is) or
another as great as this is, and all the good things contained in them; yet (as
our Savior tells us) Our life does not consist in these; And what gain or
profit could there be in possessing the whole world, in enjoying all the good
things contained in it, if we should lose the enjoyment or possession of our
own souls? To possess and enjoy the fruit of all other creatures labors, is
the Prerogative of man, the only remainder of that Dominion, which the Lord
gave him over all other creatures in his first creation; But to enjoy himself
is man's peculiar: and is the effect of his reconciliation to his God, and the
well spring of true Joy. Other creatures may, by man's permission, reap the
fruits of their own labors, as the Be in winter may eat the honey, which it
makes in the Summer, though perhaps not so sweet unto it self as it is unto
man, for whose use and service he unwittingly makes it. But no visible creature
besides man can possibly enjoy it self, or its own soul and faculties. Sense
and feeling many other creatures besides man have, Sed non sentiunt se sentire.
The fowls of the Air, the fishes of the Sea, the Beasts of the field, and the
Be, (which best resembles man, as he is A sociable creature) do respectively
(at least) hear and see, feel and taste, but yet, have no true sense or estimate
of their own senses, as wherein they exceed Grass, Trees, or vegetables, or
wherein they come short of man. So that man only is capable of enjoying
himself, and his own soul and faculties, and yet not qualified for enjoying
himself and his own faculties, until the former Peace, the peace of conscience
be in some No man can truly enjoy himself until he be reconciled to God.
measure wrought in his heart. His sensitive affections, desires and passions,
must be first subjected to Reason and Conscience: his reason, his conscience
and spirit must be subjected unto the spirit of God, before he can possess his
soul in patience; and he must possess his soul with patience before he can
Taste of that joy which is in the Holy Ghost, before he can bring forth the
fruit of holiness, whose End is everlasting Life. The Taste of this fruit or
Joy is the only pledge or assurance of that endless Joy, which is prepared (for
such as love God) in heaven.

9. The Vine brings forth much pleasant fruit; So do the trees of the Garden;
but they enjoy it not; when it is ripe, it falls from them; or their owners
reap it. But this Joy, which amounts from the quiet or peaceable possession of
our own souls, it grows within us, it ripeneth within us, it multiplieth and
it sweetneth within us, no man can, and God will not, take this joy from us.
How fruitful soever we may be, yet we are but unprofitable servants, less
profitable to our Lord and Owner, then the Trees of the Garden or Forest are
to us; yet how unprofitable soever we are to him, he continues most gracious
unto us, and permits us to reap and enjoy the fruits of all these good things,
which he himself alone does sow and plant, does water and cherish, and give
increase unto, within our hearts and souls. Were it possible for the husbandman
or Vine-dresser, so to infuse the life of sense into the Vine, as it might
continually taste the sweetness of that fruit, which it bears, and wherewith,
as the Scripture says, it cheereth the heart of man, How full would it be of
gladness? both root and branch would be as full of mirth and gladness as they
are of life and sap. How much more graciously does God deal with those that
hearken to his Word, and obey the motions of his Spirit? We being by nature
more dead unto the Fruit of holiness, and more destitute of spiritual Life,
then the Vine or Fig Tree is of the Life sensitive, he infuseth a new sense or
Taste into our souls, and makes them more fruitful then the Fig Tree, which is
never without fruit, either ripe or green; and makes us withal sensible
partakers of the sweetness, of all the Fruit, which his Spirit brings forth
in us; and from the Taste of this Fruit of Holiness arises that Joy and
Gladness of spirit, which is the pledge and earnest of Eternal Life.

10. But have we this Joy whilst we sojourn here on earth in our selves, or in
our own souls, or in Christ only? So we be fraught with the Fruit of Holiness
we have this Joy as truly in our selves, as we have the Fruit; Though we have
neither, of our selves, or from our selves. We have Both in our selves, in such
a manner, as the Vine branch has both Life and sap in it self, though both
originally from the Root. So long as the Vine branch continues in the Vine, it
is really partaker of the Life and sweetness of the Root. The similitude is our
Saviors, John 15. 1. etc. I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman:
Every branch that bears not fruit in me he takes away; and every branch that
bears fruit he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are
clean through the word which I have spoken unto you; for it is The Word which
purges us, and makes us apt to bear fruit in our selves, so long as we are in
Christ. For so he adds, ver. 4. Abide in me, and I in you; as the branch
cannot bear fruit in it self except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except
ye abide in me. For I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abides in me,
and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit, ver. 5. And where there is
Much Fruit, there is Plenty of Joy. For, contrary to the custom of other
husbandmen or Vine dressers; the sweetness of the Fruit redounds not to the
Vine-dresser, but to the branches that bear it. The fruit is wholly Ours; The
glory is only Gods. For so he adds, ver. 8. Herein is my Father glorified; (he
does not say profited) that ye bear much fruit. The more we bear, the more we
are benefited, the more God is glorified by us; for no man can truly glorify
God, until his heart and spirit be cheered with that joy, which is the fruit of
peace, and holiness. God, as the Apostle tells us, did never leave himself
without a witness; All the good things, which the Gentiles received, even
whilst they walked in their own ways, were so many witnesses of his Goodness;
though they perceived not, it was he that did them good, that gave them rain
from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness,
Acts 14. 16, 17. He does not say with Food and Joy: for, Joy properly taken,
has its seat in the mind The Difference betwixt Joy, and gladness.
and spirit of man; nor is it there placed without the spirit of God: whereas,
the gladness whereof the Apostle there speaks, may harbor in the inferior or
affective part. This difference, which we now observe between joy and gladness
in our English, The Greek writers curiously observe between (...) and (...) so
do the Latins between Laetitia and Gaudium. Every blessing of God, though but
a blessing temporal, is matter of gladness even to such as know not or
acknowledge not God to be the Author of such blessings; but True Joy always
presupposes the knowledge of God in Christ, and some acquaintance with the
spirit. True knowledge of God in Christ necessary to this joy.


11. As it is said in this 22. verse that the End or issue of the fruits of
Holiness is Eternal life, so our Savor tells us, John 17. 3. that the same
Eternal Life, is the effect or issue of the Knowledge of God, and of Jesus
Christ, whom he has sent. These two then do reciprocate; without the knowledge
of God and of Christ, there is no peace of Conscience, no fruit of Holiness,
no Joy in the Holy Ghost; and yet the greater measure of such fruit we have,
the more we shall abound in the knowledge of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ,
in the knowledge of whom, this Joy in the Holy Ghost, which can be had in this
world, and Life Eternal in the world to come, does consist.

So that the only way to attain unto this Joy, wherein the Kingdom of God does
consist; is to be rightly instructed in the knowledge of God, whose the Kingdom
and glory is, and of Jesus Christ who is Our King, even the King of glory. A
joy in the knowledge of any sort of Truths.


There is a kind of secret Joy in the knowledge or contemplation of every
truth, or true principle, though of secular and humane Arts. And no marvel; for
as God is Righteousness, and Holiness, it self; So He is Truth it self. The
truth of all sciences is as truly derived from that Truth which He is, as that
Righteousness and Holiness, whereof his Saints are made partakers, is from his
Holiness and Righteousness. Now that Joy, which some heathen Philosophers or
Artists did reap from contemplation of some Truths and Principles, in
themselves but dry and barren, did oft-times more then counterpoize that inbred
delight or pleasure in other secular vanities, which usually missway us
Christians to folly and lewdness; yea this Joy did sometimes bring their souls
into a kind of Rapture or forgetfulness of life natural or sensitive with their
contentments. Many of them in hope to find out the Causes of the Ebbing and
Flowing of the Sea, of the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, of other appearances
in the heavens, and the like, have been more abstemious and moderate in their
diet, and spent more time and hours in observing the motion of the Stars, and
in perusing Every leaf of the Book of Nature, or of Gods visible creatures,
then we bestow in fasting and praying, or in meditation upon The great Mystery
of godliness, God manifested in the Flesh; and if they happened to satisfy
themselves in these points of truth, which they most sought after, the
Expressions of their Joy, and sometimes of their thankfulness to their Gods,
were oft-times more hearty and cheerful, then most of us can give any just
proof of, for all the benefits, which The Philosophers Rapt with Joy in
Contemplation and Invention.
God has bestowed upon us by his Gospel.) (So * one of them having found out
that Mathematical Principle concerning the equality between the Square of the
base; and of the sides of a Rect-Angled Triangle, did offer up presently a
Magnificent sacrifice to the Gods or divine powers, from whom he conceived this
revelation came unto him. [The former of the Two Philosophers was Pythagoras:
The later was Archimedes. Of both, see Plutarch in his Book entitled. Non
posse hominem suaviter vivere secundum Epicurum.]
Another having after long search discovered how much pure Gold the Goldsmiths
had taken out of the King of Scicilies Crown, and made up the weight of it with
silver cunningly mixed, was so over wrought with joy, that he ran (instantly
out of the Bath naked as he was, forgetting his clothes) crying, (...), (...),
I have found it, I have found it out.

12. And such as at their vacant times are able but to try the conclusions
which these men have found out, or to contemplate the truth and use of those
unfailing principles in the Mathematics, or in Natural Philosophy, which they
have discovered, may hence reap more pure delight and sincere joy, then the
enjoyment of all things temporal, without such contemplation, can afford. Much
more Joy in the knowledge of saving truths.
Yet the most admirable principles or surest conclusions of humane Sciences are
not so good, at best no better then mere shadows of those solid Truths, which
are contained in the Mystery of godliness. Even the Law it self, which God gave
unto his people by Moses, is but a picture of that entire truth, which is
contained in the knowledge of God, and of his Christ. Hence says our
Evangelist, John 1. 17. The Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
Jesus Christ. What shall we say then? was there no truth in the Law, which was
given by Moses? God forbid! It was a Law most true; Yet the truth of it was but
a Picture of that live substance of Truth, which is contained in the Gospel, or
rather in the knowledge of Christ. If we did only desire that Joy or delight,
which naturally arises from the contemplation of the agreement between the
principles and conclusions in the same Art or Science; The whole world besides,
(though we had the perfect knowledge of it) could not yield that plenty of
pleasant speculations, which the Harmony or consent between the Types or
Figures of the old Testament, and the live substances answering unto them in
the New, or which the known accomplishments of the Prophetical predictions,
exhibit in Christ, to all that will seriously meditate on them. What madness is
it then to be in love, or to dote either on shadows in the book of nature, or
in the pictures of the Law, and to neglect the live Feature of that substantial
truth, which presents it self unto our view in the Gospel of Christ? The most
exact knowledge that can be had in the book of nature or in humane Sciences
does always end in contemplation: it is but like music which vanishes with
the motion, it leaves no permanent mirth behind it. Whereas the contemplation
of the mystery of godliness (so it be frequent and serious) does always
imprint and instill the sweet influence of life and joy into our souls.

The knowledge of humane Sciences, as it may be comprehended by the wit of man;
So it is terminated with this life: But the knowledge of Christ, or rather
Christ himself (who is the subject of divine knowledge) is an inexhaustible
fountain of truth, whose Current still, even in this life, increases as our
capacities to receive it increase, and so shall increase in the world to come
without stint or restraint. For the fruit or issue of it, as you heard before,
is everlasting life, and that is a life, which has a beginning here on earth,
but shall have no end in heaven.

An Advertisement to the Reader.
THough it was told the Reader before, (Book 10. Fol. 3068.) That it was the
Practice of this Great Author, First, To deliver in Sermons that matter which
he intended afterward to weave or form into the Body of his printed
Discourses: Yet the Tenor of the last precedent and the next following chapter
seems to require, that the Reader be re-minded of The Same here again. And
withal, it be signified, That, The Epoch or Commencement of These Tracts must
be pitched thirty or more years Retro, as may be Collected out of a Passage in
the twenty fifth Chapter. And lastly, that the Place, where these Tracts (when
they were Mere Sermons) were preached, was The Famous Town of Newcastle upon
Tine, where our Author was A most Exemplarie, Careful and Pious Vicar (but how
prosperous or successful, God only knows) for diverse years together.

CHAP. XXVI.
ROMANS 6. 22. But now -- ye have your fruits unto holiness, and the end
everlasting Life, etc.
Whether the Taste of Eternal Life once had may be lost. Concerning Sin against
the Holy Ghost. How temporal Contentments, and the pleasures of sin coming in
competition, prevail so, as to extinguish and utterly dead The Heavenly Taste,
both by way of Efficiencie and Demerit. The Advantages discovered, by which a
Lesser Good gets the Better of a Greater.

1. THe Fruits of Holiness (as has been said) are Peace and Joy in the Holy
Ghost; and in the Fruition of this Peace and Joy, consists that Taste of Eternal
Life, which in this world can be had. And this Taste must be perfected and
established by the Knowledge of Christ, and him crucified. Which Knowledge has
been the Main Subject both of my private Meditations, and of my labors
published in the seventh book of Commentaries upon the Creed.

We are now to inquire, how this Taste of Eternal Life must be preserved* How
this tast'd of eternal life is preserved.
The Rule is most true in the General; That it must be preserved and perfected
by the same means, by which it was first planted, and that is, by the Knowledge
of Christ. So that it is but One Question how the knowledge of Christ may be
perfected in us, and how this Taste of eternal life may be preserved. The next
Particular subordinate unto this General, is, by what means such as either
have, or might have had, the Taste of Eternal Life, come to be deprived of it.

A great Question not impertinent to this inquiry has been of late; Whether
Faith or Grace being once had may be lost, or whether lost only for a time, or
for ever.

But, as I have often told you, there is more Contention about this Point
amongst modern Writers, then Contradiction between their Opinions; if Of
questions touching falling from Grace.
they would calmly and distinctly express their meaning.

That from some Degree of Faith, or from some kind of Grace a man may fall, no
man denies. That no man can fall from the Grace of Election or Predestination,
I do not question. And further then This, it is not safe for any to be
peremptory in any Positive Assertion; nor fit to dispute without or beyond
these Lists. As for such as take upon them to dispute this or the like
Question, in these Terms: [Whether a man may fall from saving Grace] they bring
it in the end to an issue untriable in this life, at least on their parts. For
admit it for a truth (which some do question) that a man may be certain
(Certitudine Fidei) by the certainty of Faith, of his present estate in saving
Grace; Yet no man knows another heart; he has no taste or experimental
knowledge of those gifts and graces, which God bestows upon others: yet unless
he know the nature and quality of those Gifts and Graces, wherewith others are
endowed, as he does the nature and quality of those Graces, wherewith his own
heart is seasoned; it will be impossible for him to determine, whether the
Graces, which God has bestowed upon him, be for their nature or specifical
quality the very same with those, which others have had, and finally lose them.
Yea, whether the Grace, whereby one man is finally saved, be for specifical
quality the same with that, by which another is saved. Only this we know and
believe, That whosoever is saved, is saved only by the free grace of God, not
as it is a Quality inherent in us, but as it unites us unto Christ, who is the
Author and Fountain of all heavenly Gifts and Graces. As for the particular
manner how God does work in us, or by us; me thinks the Observation of the Wise
King might long since have put a Period to all the curious disputes of this
Age. So he said, Eccles. 11. 5. As thou know not what is the way of the
spirit (by the Spirit, I take it he means Vis Formatrix) nor how the bones do
grow in the womb of her, that is with child: even so thou know not whether
shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

2. Wherefore, to wave all these and the like Curious Questions, which rather
breed Contention then Edification, we will build this Discourse upon these Two
sure Foundations.

The First, That the Illumination of our minds and Spirits, that the Taste of
the heavenly Gift, the participation of the Holy Ghost, the relish of the good
Word of God, and of the Powers of the Life to come, are all of them True Graces
of God through Jesus Christ.

The Second, That from these Graces some men have fallen, and may yet fall both
totally and finally.

The former Principle, to wit, That the participation of the Holy Ghost, the
Taste of the heavenly Gift, etc. are Graces of God through Jesus Christ; none
but a Pelagian will question.

The Second, That from these Graces a man may fall both totally and finally, no
Christian should question. For, it is supposed by our Apostle, Hebr. 6. 4, 5,
6, 7. For no man falls into the sin against the Holy Ghost, but he which has
had these Graces, and is fallen from them. But shall we hence conclude, that
every one, which has had the Taste of the Good Word of God, and of the powers
of the Life to come, and loses it for a while, or for a long time, does
thereby fall into the Sin against the holy Ghost? God forbid! It is not every
falling away from these Gifts and Graces, but a falling from them into
Apostacy, which makes up the measure of that irremissible sin. It is not every
sin, but the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which is unpardonable.
And blasphemy against the Holy Ghost always includes a slanderous disposition
against the ways of truth, a renunciation of Christ as their Redeemer, and a
backsliding either into Atheism, Judaism, or Mahumetanism.

Now many there be, who live a dissolute and ungodly life, whose practices are
as bad as may be, which yet do not slander the way of truth, which do See the
Authors Opinion more fully about Sin against the Holy Ghost. Book 8. Chap. 3.
which Book, though published 21. years since, I suppose, was written after This.
not so much as wish in heart, much less profess themselves to be Jews, Turks,
or Mahumetans, rather then the Disciples of Christ. Nor do all, which slander
Christ, and his profession fall into this unpardonable sin, but only such as
have tasted of his Goodness, and afterward fall from him, and speak and think
contumeliously of him, and of the Religion, which he has taught us.

3. The whole Host of Israel (some few excepted) did murmur against God and
against his Servant Moses; yet all that murmured were not cut off from seeing
of that Good Land, but only those, which had seen his wonders in Egypt, at the
red Sea, and in the wilderness; and, being of years to lay them to heart,
provoked him ten times, that is, as often as they had seen them. As the
rejection of those murmuring Israelites from the Land of Canaan, was a Type of
such as are Reprobated from the Kingdom of Heaven: So the sin of those, that
were sent to view the Land, was a peculiar Type or shadow of the sin against
the Holy Ghost. These men, after they had seen this good and pleasant Land,
after they had tasted the fruits of it, brought a malicious slander upon it,
that it was a Land, which ate up its own Inhabitants, that it was not worth the
pains and danger, which they were to undertake in encountering the Anakims and
others, which were much stronger then they, and would not be put out of their
own possessions, but by strong hand and much blood on both parts. In this
manner, if any man, after God has endowed him with the heavenly Gift, and with
the Taste of the Powers of the Life to come, shall so far fall away from
Christ, as to think that the promises of that Blessed Life are not worthy of
that spiritual warfare, without which it cannot be obtained; unworthy of that
sincerity and integrity of life, which is peremptorily enjoined all that seek
after it; And in this resolution, rather, in this want of true Resolution, for
sake the Church of God and despite the Spirit of Grace, he by thus doing, falls
into this irremissible sin. But as our Apostle says unto these Hebrews, so may
I say of you, I hope better things of you; yea I am persuaded that all and
every of you are free from this sin. None of you can pretend ignorance of the
ways of Life: Let me therefore exhort you in the words of our Apostle, Hebr.
6. 11, 12. This we desire, that every one of you show all diligence to the full
assurance of hope, unto the end: that you be not slothful followers of them,
which through faith and patience inherit the promise. Or, as St. Peter speaks,
Give all diligence to make your election sure: Not by way of Syllogism, but by
good Practice and Conversation.

4. Reason not thus with your selves;

He that has once tasted of saving Grace cannot lose the taste of it.
But I have tasted of saving Grace:
Therefore I cannot lose the Taste of it.
To prevent the uncertain or ticklish issue of such Collections, Remember,

First, That God does not promise the Kingdom of Heaven to subtle disputers,
but to faithful practisers.

Secondly, Consider how easy a matter it will be for Satan, when temptations
arise, to shake all the joints of the former Syllogism, and to dissipate and
break the Jamor Proposition [He that once tasted of saving Grace cannot lose
it] into shivers. For, That (in any ordinary or intelligible sense) is saving
Grace, from which, if a man do not fall (or lose the taste of it) he shall be
saved, without addition of any other Grace besides that, which it is supposed
he has. Is it then apparent, that a man may fall from that Grace, or lose the
Taste of that Grace, in which, if he did continue, or not lose the Taste of it,
he should be saved? Yes! This is as clear as the day light. For whosoever does
continue in the Participation of the Holy Ghost, or does not lose the Taste of
the heavenly Gift, or of the Powers of the World to come, shall never perish,
shall be saved. Impossible it is that any man should enter into the estate of
death, or of reprobation, so long as he has the Taste of the life to come
implanted in his heart and spirit: and this is for nature and quality saving
Grace. But some that have tasted of this Grace, do utterly lose the taste of it,
and so fall from Grace in it self sufficient to save their souls. For though
all that lose this taste do not sin against the Holy Ghost; yet no man can sin
against the Holy Ghost until he lose this taste; and yet no man can lose this
taste, but he that has had it.

The Conclusion then is most pregnant, that it is more possible, or a shorter
passage, for a man to fall from seving Grace, or to lose the taste of it, then
to sin against the Holy Ghost. The most useful meditations then will be to
discover the Means, whereby such as once have had the taste of the heavenly
Grace, do come to lose it, with their several degrees, and these are diverse.

5. First, It is to be supposed that God does by his Spirit infuse this taste
into men's souls, not continually or uncessantly, But, as we say, by Fits or
Turns: They only enjoy and keep this Taste, that diligently seek after it and
truly prize it.
This taste of the powers of the Life to come is sometimes Transient; we cannot
have it when we list; but must expect Gods providence, and attend his pleasure,
for the renewing of it, and crave the assistance of his Spirit, for producing
it, by humble supplication and prayer. Want of the due esteem of it whilst we
have it; negligence in the duty of prayer and other Godly exercises, does
deprive us of it, when we might have had it renewed in us; God does not promise
that any shall enjoy this pearl besides such as diligently seek after it: And
when they have found it (or rather when it has found them) do duly prize it.
And as this Taste of eternal life is often for a time lost, or much prejudiced
by mere negligence in sacred duties, so it may be choked and stifled by errors
or misperswasions, which insinuate themselves into men's thoughts or fantasies,
after they have been partakers of it.

Many there be, which will unfeignedly acknowledge that the pledge or Earnest
of Eternal Life, which they have received, is of more worth and value The
danger of seeking to enjoy worldly Contentments, together with this heavenly
Taste.
then all the pleasures or contentments of this world, which can oppose or
countersway the desires of it; And yet the same men (through the sleights and
subtilty of Satan) play but the Sophisters with their own souls; Thus Assuming
or Resolving; That albeit the taste of the heavenly Gift be more to be desired,
then all the temporal contentments, which are incompatible with it; yet the
Taste of these heavenly joys, and the contentments of this life, which may be
enjoyed with it, are better then it alone; for One good how little soever,
being added to another how great soever, makes some addition See this Fallacy
in Aristotle's Rhetor.
of goodness.

Thus many covetous men, and oppressors will easily be persuaded, that they may
increase their temporal estate without any forfeiture of their estate in Gods
spiritual blessings. The ambitious or aspiring mind thinks he may glorify God
more by his high place or dignity in Church or Commonwealth, then by
continuing a private and retired life. As for the drunkard, the glutton, and
the lascivious man, they seldom are persuaded that they may continue their
wonted courses and enjoy the Taste of the heavenly Gift. And for this reason,
many that have been subject to these sins, have been more easily won to the
love of truth and of saving grace, then the Proud, the Covetous, the Ambitious
or Envious men are, because the one in his sober thoughts fore-sees the danger
and acknowledges his sins, whereas the other rejoices continually in his
courses without suspicion of danger,

6. Or if the covetous or ambitious mind sometimes suspects his ways, yet
being engaged to pursue them, lest he might be thought to have varied in his
course of life, the best repentance, which he usually attains unto, is but like
his in the Poet

Id primum, si facta mihi revocare liceret,
Non coepisse fuit; caepta expugnare Secundum est.
If I were to begin the world again, I should happily make choice of another
kind of life, but being engaged, the next point is to make the best of that
course of life, which I have chosen. And yet the more he makes of it, the worse
he speeds in it in the main chance, the more he prejudiceth the Habitual or
Actual Taste of Eternal life; for the more we are accustomed to any course of
life, the more we delight in it and are weaned from it with greater
difficulty. And yet we must be weaned even from the world it self, before we
can rightly Taste the sincere milk of the Gospel, or be capable of that strong
meat, which is contained in this Article of Eternal Life, and others concerning
Christ, by which The Taste of this Life must be fed and nourished. So that of
all sins, pride, covetousness and Ambition are the most dangerous; both,
because they be of more credit or less infamy in the world; and because they
multiply their Acts the most, and may work uncessantly.

But though it be for the most part as true of these times, wherein we live, as
it was in the days of our Saviors conversation here on earth, that Publicans
and open sinners are oftentimes nearer to the Kingdom of heaven, then many,
which live a more sober or civil life, but yet are covetous, vainglorious, or
envious, as the Scribes and Pharisees were; yet there is no man, that sets his
heart to Taste of any unlawful pleasures, though of those pleasures, which in
his sober thoughts he condemns, but does hereby weaken or dead his Taste of the
food of Life, and make himself subject to former temptations, Taste of unlawful
pleasures deads and loses the heavenly Taste.
whenever they shall assault him. However in the absence of temptations they
may seem unto themselves and unto others to repent, yet when fresh ones arise,
they usually come to the same vent, at which the affections of that incestuous
wanton in the Poet broke out when she said

-- Denique non possum innoxia dici,
Quod superest multum est in vota, in crimina parvum.
I am an offender already, and if I shall go on but a little, this may give
greater satisfaction unto my desires, then it can add unto the measure of my
sin. But voluntarily to give satisfaction to any unlawful desire or wish, upon
these or like resolutions, is much worse then the desire it self, how bad
soever that be; and may with speed make up a greater measure of sin in a
moment, then that, which had been long in gathering before.

7. It is agreed upon amongst the Moralists, that every vicious or unlawful Act
does dispose the soul of man unto the vicious Habit or Custom, whereunto such
vicious Acts do tend; and after the Habit or custom be by many Acts produced,
every following Act (specially if it be undertaken deliberately and out of
choice) does add a kind of weight unto the habit once produced, or A stiffness
of bent or sway unto the faculty or propension wherein the custom is seated.
The more men addict themselves to any practice, or the longer any custom in
evil is continued, the more apt they are to be swayed with lesser temptations,
then could have moved them amiss before such custom or practice.

Thus much the heathens had observed by light of nature; and what Unlawful
pleasures and sinful acts destroy the heavenly taste both by Efficiency and
Demerit,
they speak of morally Vicious Habits or customs, is most true of wicked or
ungodly practices or customs; for besides this; that every sinful Act
(specially if it be committed out of deliberation or choice) does increase the
strength of the Habit or implanted desire, whence it flows, it does withal
provoke God who is the giver of every good and perfect gift, the only preserver
of men from sin and wickedness, both to revoke those good gifts, which he has
given them, and to withdraw the influence of his restraining Grace from them;
according to the Tenor of our Saviors words, And from him that has not, shall
be taken even that which he has: And those once being taken away,

Tunc vaga prosiliet froenis natura remotis. Our natural corrupt desires run
further riot on a sudden, then, whilst we were in the course of nature, they
ordinarily did, or could have done; and become so far exorbitant, that men
either lose the Taste of the heavenly Gift altogether, or cannot be reclaimed by
it, without the assistance of some new Grace or heavenly Gift.

A question there is amongst the School Divines, whether any actual sin, how
gross soever, can expel or extinguish grace by natural efficacy (as cold
expels, or moisture quenches, heat) or only by way of Demerit. That by way
of Demerit, vicious Acts may quench this Taste of eternal life, all do grant;
that is, They may and do provoke God, who is the giver of all Grace, either to
withhold that Grace, which otherwise he would bestow upon such men, or to take
away such Graces from them, as he has already bestowed upon them. But that any
vicious Acts or Habits should expel Grace after the same manner, as one
vicious moral habit does expel the contrary virtue (as drunkenness does expel
sobriety, or as intemperance in any kind does temperance) this some great
Schoolmen deny or question. But, leaving these curious and inextricable
disputes, we will hold our selves only to such useful Queries as fall under our
former Aim or Level.

8. The most useful query in this case is, Whether it be ordinarily possible,
that the Taste of the heavenly Gift, or of the powers of the life to come (where
it has been How worldly pleasures and temporal contentments come to prevail
against the taste of Eternal life.
once planted) can be prejudiced by the proposal of any temporal contentment,
whilst they stand in actual competition, or whilst we deliberate whether the
pursuit of the one be to be preferred (for the present) to the other. That any
man, which has any True Notion or relish of Eternal Life, should be swayed to
follow the ways of Death, otherwise then through incogitancy, or want of
actual consideration, may justly seem most improbable, if not impossible. For
he that truly apprehends or rellisheth the sweet Fruits of holiness, the Peace
of Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost (of if any other pledge there be of
Eternal Life) cannot but acknowledge, that These are more worth then any
temporal Contentment, which can come in Competition with them. Now it is a mere
madness to make choice of a Lesser Good before a Greater, so long as it is
actually apprehended or acknowledged to be Greater: there must be a defect or
intermission in the precedent Deliberation before any man can be overtaken with
this kind of madness. Carnal contentments we apprehend or relish by our
natural faculties; Peace of Conscience or spiritual joy are Faculties natural,
and Grace, Two Scales.
apprehended or rellished only by Grace; and these two several apprehensive
Faculties are as the two Scales in a Balance: Whence, it may seem as impossible
for one that has a true apprehension or relish of spiritual Good to be
over-swayed to the contrary evil with any temporal Contentment, which for the
present can be presented to his deliberation, as for a greater weight being put
in the one scale of the balance to be over-poized by a lesser weight put in the
other.

The Comparison, I confess, if it be rightly weighed, will hold most exactly:
If the Scales be even or equipendent, and the Beam or Balance be equally
divided, it is impossible that a lesser weight put into the one Scale should
counterpoize a greater; But in Case the beam or balance be unequally divided,
that is, if one part be longer then the other, a lesser weight put in that
Scale, which has the longer part of the balance, will over-poize a far
greater weight put into the other Scale.

9. This was an usual kind of Cousenage in ancient times, practiced by such as
sold costly wares, and was excellently discovered by Aristotle in his
Mechanical Questions. The truth of his discovery is most apparent in the Ancel
Weight or Balance (which most of you have seen) wherein one pound weight put
upon the one end of the Balance, will counterpoize a stone weight put upon the
other end. And the inequality between the several portions of the same Beam or
balance may be such, that a stone weight being put upon the one end will fetch
back a hundred stone weight being put upon the other.

From this Experimental Principle did the great Mathematician, Archimedes,
ground that Assertion, which seemed a Paradox. Da ubi consistam, and devolvam
terram. If he might choose his distance or standing place he would roll the
whole earth about by his own strength. As imagine the Line (which goes from the
Center of the earth unto that part of the heavens, which is above our heads,
and through it) were as firm and strong as a pillar of brass or steel, the
strength of one man's arm placed in the highest Heaven, or in such a place, as
this Mathematician desired to have footing in, might poize or turn about the
whole earth and all the creatures in it.

The former discovery of falsehood in visible and material balances is clear to
sense, and may be demonstrated to reason; but the heart of man is more
deceitful then any balance, and the deceit of it was never discovered either by
the Mathematician, or by the Philosopher, nor is it discernable without
diligent circumspection to a man's own self. The deceit in the General herein
consists, That, Albeit, the apprehensive Faculties, by which we discern
spiritual Joy, and temporal Contentments, be, to our seeming, as equally set as
any two Scales in a balance can be, or though our actual apprehension of
matters spiritual be for the present more lively and quick, then our
apprehensions of temporal contentment: yet our habitual propension or customary
inclination to some temporal pleasures or delights may be much greater then our
propension or inclination to any spiritual good. And yet this exorbitant
propension or inclination unto things temporal, may be insensibly contracted,
and the strength for a long time not apprehended, not suspected by us. As bad
humors gather (unwittingly to us) in our bodies, and grow to a deadly or
desperate issue before we apprehend any danger: so may our propensions or
affections, to some earthly vanity or other, increase and multiply, before we
apprehend their strength or stiffeness. And in this Case alone, when our
natural propensions or affections to any temporal Contentment, exceed our
propensions to spiritual Joy or Peace of Conscience; a temporal and momentary
good being proposed to our Actual or deliberate choice, may over-sway the
greatest spiritual Good, which we can for the present oppose unto it; such a
Good, as before this temptation did arise, we would have chosen before any
temporal Contentment, which we did actually apprehend, or could think of.

10. If it be further demanded, Whether in this Case a lesser Good may be
chosen before a Greater; or whether this can happen without some spice of
madness?

We should frame our Answer by the former Comparison between a lesser weight
and a greater being put into the even Scales of an unequal balance; That the
lesser weight should over-poize the Greater it were unpossible, unless the
propension of that part of the Balance, wherein the lesser weight is put, did
further exceed the propension of the other part, wherein the greater weight was
put, then the greater weight does the lesser, supposing they were to be weighed
not in even Scales only, but in an equal balance. If the greater weight (or
material to be weighed) have the same Proportion to the less, that Six has to
Four, and the one part of the Balance, wherein the lesser weight is put, have
the same Proportion of length or propension, which six has to four, neither
shall over-poize other. But if the propensions of the several parts of the same
balance have the same proportion that Seven has to Four, Four Pounds put in
the one scale will over-poize Six pounds put in the other. By the greater
propension you are to understand not a greater declination or lower pendence of
the one scale in respect of the other, but a greater facility or aptitude to be
declined or moved downwards.

The Philosopher had long ago observed, that Circuli majores semper
moventiores, The greater compass the wheel has, the more apt it is to be
moved, and being once moved it moves more swiftly then a lesser. And for the
same reason the longer part of the same Diameter or beam in a Balance is more
propense or apt to be moved then the shorter part, though the weight or
strength which poizeth both, be equal. For it moves not only by virtue of its
own weight or strength which poizeth it, but by the virtue of his own
propension or inclination to be moved. Every further degree of its
propenpension or inclination to be moved falls into the same reckoning with the
weight or strength, which moves or poizeth it.

The Case is the same in the Question proposed between A Greater and a Lesser
Good, as between temporal Contentment and spiritual Joy, considered in the
General; or between their several Branches. We must not compare the Objects or
matters of the several Contentments only; for so it is evident that a lesser
Good is usually chosen before a Greater: But we must consider the Objects as
they jump or meet with our propensions or inclinations to them.

Now albeit any branch of spiritual Goodness may be actually apprehended as
much the better before it come to actual Competition or counterpoize with some
temporal Good; yet if our propension to any branch of temporal good be greater
then our propension to the contrary spiritual Good; the propension to the
temporal good, when it meets with a suitable Object, and opportunity to embrace
it, is so Actuated and enlived by it, that it breaks out into a desire; and the
goodness of our desire does so intermingle it self with the fore-apprehended
goodness of the thing desired, that they concur as exactly to make up the
same measure of Goodness, as a Crown of gold and a Crown of silver do to make
up the same sum of money. Whence, if Our desire or propension to any temporal
Contentment be greater then our propension to the former spiritual Good; the
goodness of the Object desired being added unto it will over-sway our
inclination to the spiritual Good; and however in the absence of tempting
Objects we esteem the spiritual Good to be much greater then any temporal
Contentment, yet the goodness of the desire or propension to any temporal
contentment, if it be excessive, after once it come to join with a lesser
Actual Good, will sway our choice to that which is worse, although there be no
defect in the present Act of deliberation.

11, These Discussions though unto some they may seem too Curious, yet are they
useful, and give us the true meaning of our Saviors Advice or Precept
Moderating of worldly desires and natural affections necessary for gaining and
preserving the heavenly taste.
unto all that desire to come unto him. If any man, says he, Luke 14. 26, 27.
come to me and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and
Brethren and Sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my Disciple: and
whosoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, he cannot be my Disciple.
And again, after two Similitudes and Parables premised, the One, Of a man
intending to build a house; The Other, Of a King going to make war against
another King; he concludes in the same words, ver. 33. So likewise whosoever he
be of you, that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my Disciple. This
is the first reckoning or account, which a Christian must make before he
undertake
that Sacred War against the Prince of this world, or before he consecrate
himself to be A spiritual Temple unto the Lord; otherwise he undertaketh both
enterprises rashly and unadvisedly.

But wherein does this Forsaking of Father and Mother, and all that we have
consist?

The Answer to this Querie, is, First Negative, then Affirmative.

First, It does not consist in the abdication or abandoning of our secular
Callings; not in casting off all care of our Father and Mother, and other
Friends; not in selling of all that we have, though with intention to give it
to the poor. Wherein then? In the limiting or moderating of our affections or
desires unto these or other things temporal. A mountain of gold could not have
swayed so much with St. John, as thirty pieces of Silver did with Judas; so
unequally was the balance of his heart set, that this small sum being put as it
were in the one scale, did over-poize his Lord and Master, who was the fountain
of all spiritual Graces, being put in the other scale. It was not then the
weight of the money, but the Excess of his desire and propension to money,
which made him so foully to miscarry.

The whole art or skill of a Christian consists in these two points. First, In
examining or finding out the strength or sway of his affections unto things
temporal. And secondly, In abating or weakening their strength, or in weaning
his soul
from such desires. This is that, which the Scripture calls the Circumcision of
the heart, and that is no other then a putting off, of all superfluous or
impertinent desires, or a lopping or limiting of our natural desires that they
extend not beyond our compass. A Grain of Faith or spiritual Grace may sway
more in a man of moderate desires, then an Ounce of the same faith or Grace can
do in a man of immoderate or vast desires. The first fruit of Grace is to
moderate our desires or affections; this is the only way to become rich in
Faith and rich in Grace. Thus much the heathen Seneca.
Philosopher had observed; that the way to be truly rich was not to make
continual addition to our wealth or coin, but by substraction or abatement of
our desires of it. Unless we use the same Method in matters spiritual, we can
have no certainty of our salvation, no assurance of our settled Estate in
Grace; albeit our apprehensions of Eternal Life through Christ be quick and
lively; albeit our zeal to the professors of the truth be strong and servent.

Though it be most true, which St. John says, that, Greater is he, which is in
us, then he which is in the world, that is, Christ Jesus is much stronger then
the Devil; yet unless, we hold our desires and propensions to things temporal
within compass, and keep our selves within the bounds, which he has set us, we
have no assurance of his protecting of us against his adversary, who is much
stronger then we are, or can be, without his special Protection.

But say we have set a short period to our desires of things temporal, and
brought our natural affections into a tolerable subjection unto the spirit of
Watchfulness and sobriety also are necessary.
Grace, Are we hereby freed from danger, or from suffering prejudice in our
spiritual Taste of Eternal Life? No! Besides that moderation of our natural
desires or affections, in which The forsaking of all that we have, consists,
there is required a Perpetual watchfulness over all our ways: we must
carefully look to every particular step: For, as a Judicious Divine has well
observed, albeit, he, which is thus far a Christian in heart, be endowed with
the extraordinary Graces of the spirit, be like a man of an able and active
body well armed and skillful in the use of his weapons; yet even such a man may
quickly take the foil, if his adversary encounter him upon a slippery ground:
For this reason, as there must be An Habitual for saking of all that we have,
lest otherwise our own concupiscences do tempt and betray us; so there must be
a perpetual watchfulness to prevent all advantages, which the great tempter
never cease to seek out against us. hence is that other precept of our
Savior, so often inculcated by himself, and by his Apostles. Be sober
Sobriety consists not only in temperance of meat and drink but in Ruling our
thoughts and words.
and watch; watch and pray continually, etc. Without sobriety there can be no
watchfulness; And this sobriety consists, not only in the moderation of our
meat and drink, or other pleasure of the sense, but in the government of our
very thoughts and speeches. It includes a maturitie of Judgment and
deliberation in all our resolutions and undertakings: It is no less opposed to
restless or hasty furious passion, then to habitual excess in any other kind
whatsoever. For,

Celeritas semper malis conatibus addit a Comes, Unruly or prodigious Acts are
for the most part ushered by rashness. A lesser weight if it move swiftly, or
be violently thrown, will sway more, and give a greater blow, then a far
greater weight, which moves slowly or with less violence. The swiftness of
Motion or violent passions will missway our inclinations or propensions, though
in themselves moderate, as far as the settled weight of an habituate inclination
or Custom.

Now albeit we be commanded to be sober and watch, to watch and pray
continually, yet this being an Affirmative Precept, Obligat semper, non ad
semper, though it always binds us, yet it does not bind us to all times alike.
The due observance of it is more specially required at those times which are
set a part by Gods law, as the Sabbath is, or at those times, which are by the
Church consecrated for religious meditations and performances, such as is this
instant time of Lent; if I should term it the Holy Time of Lent, I should, with
some men, incur the censure of superstition, seeing all times are alike holy.
Be it so! if we consider them in themselves: yet the time of Lent, being
sequestered or set apart by the Church, those feastings or merry meetings, which
in the season of Joy lately past, were not unlawful, if the like should be
practiced or exercised in it, would convince the practisers of prophanness.

I know there is a Doctrinal Error too well entertained in many parts of this
Kingdom, which much hinders the due observance of this Time; but so it does the
performance of many other necessary duties. The Error is this; That humane
Laws, or Laws Ecclesiastic made by the Church do not bind the Conscience.
his Doctrine has been maintained by some worthy and Orthodox Pastors in this
Church without any Error, if their meaning were rightly conceived. But what
they conceive not amiss is so expressed, that it has occasioned many to err
foully, not in Doctrine only, but in Practice. Their meaning I know is no more
then this; That no man does sin or wound his Conscience, but by transgressing
some Law of God. This in Thesi is most true: Yet let me request you to remember
or consider (what has been told you before in the controversy between us and
the Romish Church concerning Christian Obedience and Loyalty to Princes;) that
however no man can sin but by transgressing Gods Laws; yet an Ecclesiastic or
humane Law, being made this year for restraint of our liberty in things
indifferent, may make the same Act or practice to be a transgression of Gods
Law, which the year or years before had been no transgression of it. But the
Law concerning the observation of Lent, as well in respect of dyer, as of
frequenting the house of God, is not of this or the last years standing; it
has the warrant and custom of the Ancient Church, and the highest authority
of this Kingdom to give it countenance. And whilst either the Church, or Laws
of the Kingdom do enjoin you to do these things, which in themselves are not
unlawful, in obeying them you obey Gods Law, which commands obedience: in
disobeying them you disobey the Laws of God, which forbid disobedience to the
higher powers. If then you will obey the Laws, specially where they command
fasting, or abstinence, or devotion in public, God will bless your private
devotions, and your use of meat and drink the better.

CHAP. XXVII.
ROMANS 6. 23. For the wages of sin is Death; but the Gift of God is
Everlasting Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
About the Merit of Good Works. The Romanists Allegations, from the force of
The word Mereri amongst the Ancients; and for the Thing it self, out of Holy
Scriptures. The Answers to them all respectively: Some prove Aut nihil aut
nimium. The different value and importance of Causal particles: For, Because,
etc. A difference between Not worthy and Unworthie. Christ's sufferings though
in Time finite, of value infinite. Pleasure of sin short, yet deserves infinite
punishment. Bad works have the Title of Wages and Desert to Death; But so have
not good works to Life Eternal.

1. DEath (as was expressed in the 21. verse) is the End of sin; and Life The
final Recompense of our doings Good or bad.
Eternal (as you have it verse the 22.) is the End of Holiness, or of the
service of God. The Proof of both Assertions you have in this 23. verse,
because Death is the wages of sin, and Life Eternal the Gift of God; the last
and best Gift, wherewith he crowns such as serve him in holiness and
righteousness. Now the final recompense or reward, (whether that be good or
bad) is the End or Period of all our ways or works. Herein then does Life and
death everlasting only agree; that as well the One as the Other, is the End or
issue of men's several ways or courses here on earth. Yet these Ends are
Contrary the one to the other; and so are the ways, which lead unto them. The
only way to the One is Righteousness and holiness; the ready way unto the other
is sin and wickedness. But however sin be injustice, and the author of sin be
most unjust; yet herein they both observe the Rule of Justice, that they pay
their servants their wages to a mite: and unless the righteous Judge did
moderate their cruelty, they would pay their servants more then is their due.
But does not the Just Judge deal so with his servants? Yes: he pays them more
then is their due; yet this he does without injustice; for he rewards them,
not according to the Rule of Justice, but, according to his Mercy and Bounty.
To punish men beyond their desert, is injustice: But to Reward men above their
deserts, is no way contrary to Justice, but an Act of mercy triumphing over
Justice.

But has Justice no hand, no finger in distribution of the Final Reward of
Holiness?

This is or should be the brief issue of that great Controversy between the
Romanists and Reformed Churches: An bona opera renatorum mereantur vitam
aeternam. Whether the Good Works of men regenerate do deserve or merit eternal
life. And it is a very Good Rule, which a Great Champion of Reformed Churches
has given us, To reduce all Controversies to those places of Scripture,
wherein they are properly seated, and out of whose sense or meaning
Chemnitius's Rule.
they are emergent.

To handle them (especially in Pulpit) upon other occasions, or to go out of
our way to meet with them, is but to nurse Contention. And of all the places in
Scripture, which are brought either Pro or Con for the Merit of Works, none is
more pertinent, none more fit to be discussed, then this 23. verse of Romans 6.

Those Answers, which are often given by Romanists unto other places of
Scripture (alleged by our Writers) will appear impertinent, if they be
rightly examined by our Apostles Conclusion in this Chapter.

Our Method in handling this Controversy shall be this.

First, To set down the Arguments brought by the Romanist for establishing the
Merit of Works.

Secondly, To press the sense and meaning of our Apostle (in this 23. ver. of
Romans 6.) against them.

Thirdly, To join issue with them, or to set down The true State of the
Question, not only betwixt us and them; but between the just Judge, and our own
souls and Consciences.

2. First, They allege That the word Merit is frequent in the Ancient The
Romanists Allegation: from the force of the word merit.
Fathers of the Church, and that albeit the same Word be not so frequent in the
Scripture, yet the matter it self, which the Fathers express by the word
[mereri] is often intimated or necessarily employed in Terms Equivalent; And if
we agree upon the Matter, it is but a vanity to wrangle about Words.

Both points of their Allegation deserve the scanning.

To the First, Concerning the word [mereri, or to merit] in the Latin Fathers;
we reply, that as Coyns or metals instamped, so Words do change their value or
importance in different Ages, and in several Nations: Custom Hor. de Art.
has as great authority in the one Case, as Sovereign power has in the other.
Mereri, to merit, imports as much (in the ancient secular Roman or Latin
Writers) as to deserve that which we sue for, or attain unto, or to have a just
Title unto it: So a Soldier is said to merit his pay, a servant his wages, and
good Statesmen or Commanders in war, their honors. But unto this pitch or
scantling the Ecclesiastic Writers, as St. Austine, St. Jerome; or later, as
St. Bernard, do not extend the word Merit: Mereri (according to their meanings)
is no more then Assequi, that is, to attain or get that, which men desire. So
Turonensis brings in a blind man supplicating to an Holy Man of his time, in
this form [Ut possim per preces tuas mereri visum;] that I may merit my sight
through your prayers. In which words, the word Mereri, to merit, can imply no
more, either in the poor man's meaning, or in this Historians, then Assequi, to
get or obtain. For no man can merit any thing by another prayers: If these
could properly merit or deserve any thing at Gods hand, the merit should be
his, whose prayers God vouchsafed to hear; not his, for whom he prayed.

The same word Mereri, with some Writers, does not import so much as to obtain
or get any thing at Gods hands, by virtue of our own or others prayers, but
only to be an Occasion or Condition, without which, that, which befalls us,
though not desired by us, should not have befallen us. So, (as we said before)
one speaks of Adams sin, Felix peccatum quod talem meruit redemptorem. O happy
sin, which merited such a Redeemer! Now there is nothing in the world, which
could less deserve any benefit at Gods hand then sin, which yet was the
Occasion or Condition, without which the Son of God had not been incarnate, at
least had not been Consecrated through Affliction to be our Redeemer. No Act or
work of God, no not the first work of Creation, was of more free Gift or bounty
(as the Romanists grant) or less merited (either de Condigno, or de Congruo by
any work of ours) then the work of our Redemption. So that the word Merit, how
often soever it be used by the Ancient Latin Fathers, carries no weight to
sway us to any conceit of True Worth in our Works for the purchasing of
eternal life.

3 But what if the Holy Ghost speak thus, in Formal or Equivalent Terms, as
that Eternal life is the wages or stipend of our Works, or that our Works are
worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven, or of the life to come? Shall we not subscribe
unto him? Yes we will, if the Romish Church can prove unto us, that He thus
spoke or meant. Now that he thus speaks or means, they endeavor thus to prove;
First, from all those places of Scripture, in which Eternal The Romanists
second proof of Merit.
life is said to be (...), or Merces, that is, a reward or stipend. Now our
Savior himself thus speaks, Matthew. 5. 11, 12. Blessed are you when men shall
revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you
falsely for my sake: Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in
heaven; for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you. From this
and the like places, they labor to infer, that the patience of Martyrs is
meritorious of Eternal Life.

To this and the like places, the Answer is easy: The Greek (...), and The
Answer.
so the Latin Merces, imply no more in the Language of the Holy Ghost, then our
English word, [Reward.] And hence the fruit or issue of our pains, so it be
grateful to men, though no way deserved, is called (...). So our Savior says,
that the very Hypocrites (which do all their works to be seen of men, if they
gain applause) have their Reward. Yet no man will say, that a dissembler or
hypocrite does deserve or merit this Reward, but rather punishment. And
Rewards, we know, are sometimes given freely, out of mere bounty and
liberality, as well as by way of desert or merit. Yea, it is not properly a
Reward, unless it be a Gratuitie or Largess. That which a man works for upon
Covenant, or that which he receives by way of hire, is not a Reward, but a just
Pay or Stipend; and though it be most true, that God renders to every one
according to all his ways; yet in propriety of speech, he is said to reward
none, but those whom he remembers in mercy and bounty. For so it is said,
Heb. 11. 5. He that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
Rewarder of them that seek him; not so of such as seek him not, for them he
punishes; and no branch of punishment is any branch of Reward.

This then we learn from our Apostle, That the first thing to be believed in
all ages, is this, That there is a God: The second, That this God is a Rewarder
of those that seek him. This truly infers, That His Reward is worth the seeking
after, whether it be bestowed upon us in this, or in the life to come: but it
does not infer, that our seeking after it, is meritorious, or worthy of the
least of his Rewards. And though Eternal Life be the Best and Last Reward of
such as seek God, yet it is not the Only Reward that he bestows on them that
seek him: yea he bestows Eternal Life, or the Life of Glory upon none, upon
whom he does not first bestow the Reward of Grace. The Kingdom of Grace is but
the Entrance into the Kingdom of Glory. And when we teach new Converts to pray
in the first Place for The Kingdom of Grace, and to pray for it, as the Reward
or Gift of God. Yea and the Romanists themselves do grant, that no man can
merit the Kingdom of Grace, which is properly the Reward of such as seek God;
so that all their Arguments, which they draw from this Topic, that Eternal
Life is called (...) or Merces, and may therefore be merited by us, are
altogether groundless: All of them conclude, Aut nihil aut nimium, either
nothing at all, or a great deal too much; As, That the First Grace may be
merited, which they themselves deny.

4. Their next chief Topic is, that Our works or endeavors are said to be
worthy The Rom-third Argument.
of Eternal Life, and that in Canonical Scriptures. To this purpose Cardinal
Bellarmine cites that of our Savior, Luke 10. 7. Dignus est operarius mercede
sua. The Laborer is worthy of his hire. But I am persuaded, that he took this
upon trust from some idle or ignorant Scholar, whom he had employed to rake
testimonies for his present purpose. If his leisure had served him to look upon
the Circumstances of the Text with his own eyes, he might clearly have seen,
that our Savior there speaks not of Eternal Life, or of the Reward or Gift of
God, but of that Hire, which is due unto the Preachers of the Gospel from such
as are instructed in the Gospel.

The other Testimonies alleged by him, are more Pertinent, though not
Concludent; And they are in number Three.

The First is, Luke 20. 35. But they that shall be accounted Worthy to obtain
that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in
marriage. Bellarmine his Reasons:


The second is, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 4. We our selves (says he) glory in you in the
Churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and
tribulations that ye endure, which is a manifest token of the righteous
Judgment of God, that ye may be counted Worthy of the Kingdom of God; For which
ye also suffer.

The third is, Revel. 3, 4. Thou have a few names even in Sardis, which have
not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are
Worthy.

This last Testimony affords them A new Topic or Frame of Arguments, which
they draw from this and the like places, wherein, The works or righteousness of
the Saints are assigned as True Causes, Why they enter into the Kingdom of
heaven. So our Savior says in the Final Sentence, Math. 25. 34. Come ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world. FOR I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me;
I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me. This is as
much (says Bellarmine) as if he had said: Ye are Therefore blessed of my
Father, ye shall Therefore enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Because ye have
done these and the like good Works out of your Love and Charity toward me.
Now if these works be The Cause, Why they enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and
if those of Sardis were to walk with him in white robes, Because they were
Worthy; The Controversy may seem Concluded; That Good Works are meritorious
of heavenly Joys, or of Eternal Life.

5. To the latter Objections or frame of Arguments drawn from these and the The
Causal Particles [For, Because, and the like] imply not merit of Works And see
more of them Book 8. Chap. 15.
like places, For I was an hungry and you gave me meat, etc. Calvin makes
Answer; That these and the like particles [Quia, Etenim, For, or Because] do
not always import or denote The true Cause of things, but sometimes only the
Order or connection betwixt them. But, However this may be True, it is not so
Punctual, but that Bellarmine and others take their advantage from it, as
having the Authority of the Grammar Rule against it. For the particles used,
in all the places alleged by them, are Conjunctions not Copulative or Connexive
but Causal. And it may seem harsh to say That some conjunction causal does not
import a causalitie. It is true; Yet sometimes, they import no cause at all of
the thing it self, but only of our knowledge of it. Oft-times again, they
import no Efficacious causalitie of the thing it self, but only Causam sine qua
non, that is, some necessary means or condition without which the Prime and
Principal cause does not produce its Effect.

To give you examples or Instances of both these observations. If there should
come into This or the like Corporation, A stranger, who knows not any
Magistrate by sight, he would say, surely this is the chief Magistrate, Because
all others give place unto him, because the Ensigns of Authority are carried
before him. Here the word, Because, must necessarily denote A true cause, but
not the cause why he is the chief Magistrate (for that is only his true and
just Election:) What cause does it then denote? The cause of his knowledge of
him to be the chief Magistrate. Thus, when we come to the knowledge of the
cause by the Effect; The effect is the cause of our knowledge of the cause: As
others giving place unto him, or the carrying of the Ensigns of Authority
before him, is not the cause why this or that man is the chief Magistrate for
the time being, but rather, his being the chief Magistrate is the cause why all
others give him place, and why the Ensigns of Authority are born before him.
Yet these and the like Effects are the true cause or reason of a strangers
knowledge of him to be the chief Magistrate.

And by this Rule we are to interpret that saying of our Savior many sins are
forgiven her, for she loved much. In which speech it may not be denied, but
that the Particle, For, imports A true cause; yet no cause of the thing it
self, to wit, of her love. For this were utterly to reverse or thwart our
Saviors meaning, which was no other then this; That the forgiveness of her
sins was the cause of her love: so was not her Love the cause of the
forgiveness of her sins, which by our adversaries confession being of Free
Grace, and of the First Grace which was bestowed upon her, could not be merited
or deserved. Howbeit the manner of expressing of her love by washing his feet
with her tears, and wiping them with her hairs, was The true cause of every
understanding or Observant man's knowledge, that many sins were forgiven her;
and unless she had an apprehension of her manifold sins thus freely forgiven
her, she could not have loved him so much, or made such expression of her Love.

6. Sometimes again, this Particle, For, or the like causal speech, imports
only a subordinate or instrumental cause, or A necessary means or condition
required, without which, the Positive, the Principal and only efficacious cause
(especially if it work freely) does not produce its intended Effect. To put the
case home, in this present business. Suppose a great and potent Prince out of
his own mere motion and free grace should proclaim a pardon to an Army of
Traitors and Rebels which had in Justice deserved death: if a man should ask
What is the cause or reason why the Law does not proceed against them? no other
cause could be assigned, besides the gracious favor of the Prince. But if one
should further ask, Why the pardon being freely promised to all; the principal
malefactors (it may be) are pardoned, or restored to their blood or advanced to
dignities, whereas others which were included in the same pardon are exiled or
put to death? The speech would be proper and in its kind Truly causal, if we
should say, the one part submitted themselves and craved allowance of their
pardon, whereas the other stood out and rejected it. For it is to be presumed,
that no Prince being able to quell his rebellious adversaries will suffer any
to enjoy the benefit of a General Pardon (how freely soever it be granted)
unless they submit themselves unto it, and crave the benefit of it, with such
humility as becomes malefactors or men obnoxious. Much less will he restore
any to blood, or advance them to dignities, whom he knows or suspects still to
continue ill affected or disloyal in heart. So then the not-submission or
continuance in rebellion is The true and Positive Cause why the one sort enjoy
no benefit of the General Pardon, but are more severely dealt withal for
rejecting the princes Grace then they should have been dealt withal if no
Pardon had been granted. The humble submission of the other, and their
penitence for their former misdeeds, is Causa sine qua non, that is, a
necessary means or Condition, without which the Prince (how gracious soever)
would not suffer them to enjoy the benefit of their Pardon, would not restore
them to their blood, would not advance them to greater dignities.

This is the very Case of Adam and all his sons. All of us were Traitors and
Rebels against the Great God and King of Heaven, who is better able to quell
the whole host of mankind than any Prince his meanest Rebellious subjects; yet
it pleased him to pardon us more freely then any earthly Magistrate can do a
malefactor. If then the reason be demanded, Why any of mankind are saved? Why
they are restored unto their blood, and advanced to greater dignity then Adam
in Paradise enjoyed? no other true cause can be assigned of these Effects
besides The mere grace and mercy of the Almighty Judge.

But if it be further demanded Why some of mankind enjoy the benefit of this
Pardon, and inherit Eternal Life? Why others are sentenced to everlasting
death: When as the free Pardon with its benefits were seriously and sincerely
tendered to all? The Answer is Orthodoxal and True; Because some in true
humility accepted of the Pardon and craved allowance of it: whereas others
rejected it, and slighted such Proclamations or significations of it, as the
God of mercy and compassion had given out, not to this or that man only, but To
all the World. So that the Omission of those good works which our Savior
mentions in the final sentence, is the true cause why the wicked are excluded
from all benefit of it. The performance of the same works (as feeding of the
hungry, visitation of the sick etc.) is the Instrumental cause, or means
subordinate to the Principal cause, why Christ's sheep are suffered or admitted
to enjoy the benefit of the same free Pardon; but no cause at all why the
Pardon was proclaimed, or why the Kingdom of Heaven was prepared for them; For
that was prepared for them from the Foundation of the world, before they had
any Actual Being, before they could merit any thing at the hands of men, much
less at the hand of God, either de Congruo or de Condigno: For all merit
supposes some precedent work, and every work or operation presupposes Actual
Being. The Freeness of the Pardon excludes not all qualification; but rather
requires sincere performance of good Duties.


7. But how freely soever, the General pardon be issued out, or the Kingdom of
Heaven be either promised or really bestowed (and it is as freely bestowd or
given as it is promised) the free gift, or bestowing of it is so far from
excluding all Qualifications in the parties on whom it is freely bestowed: that
it necessarily requires a sincere performance of those good duties, which are
specified in the Final sentence; Come ye blessed of my Father, for I was an
hungry and you gave me meat, etc. Now if to suffer stub born malefactors to
enjoy the benefit of a gracious Pardon cannot stand with the Majesty of an
earthly Prince; much less can it stand with the infinite Majesty of the
Eternal Judge to permit impenitent sinners to enjoy the benefit and the full
redemption purchased by Christ, or to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven: Both
because no unclean thing can enter there, and because as the Redemption is a
Redemption from the service of sin to the service of righteousness; so the
Pardon is only a Pardon to such as repent and forsake the Sin Pardoned. This
answer to their later Topic or Frame of Arguments (for our Admission into
Eternal Life) drawn from the Causal Form of speech, will bring forth a punctual
Answer to the other General Head or Root of Arguments, taken from those places
of Scripture, wherein is said, that We are accounted worthy of Eternal Life.

For in all the places alleged by them, This Phrase or form of speech [To be
worthy] includes no more, then then to be so qualified, as we shall not be
accounted Unworthy of Gods mercy or free Pardon through Jesus Christ. All that
shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, must be such as Deus dignabitur, that
is, such as God shall vouchsafe or deign to accept in mercy, or not account
altogether Unworthy of his Free Pardon purchased by the merits of Christ, or of
the benefits of it, which are always actually bestowed, not only For Christ's
merits, but in Christ and through Christ, that is, as freely bestowed without
any merits of ours, as they were first promised.

The Greek writers (especially their Ecclesiastic writers, who most accurately
follow the true sense and Character of the New Testament, which was first
written in Greek) accurately distinguish betwixt (...), and (...), and (...).
To this purpose there is an Ecclesiastic Canon in the Greek Church, which
commends the ingenuity of such as shall acknowledge themselves be (...), that
is, as we say, not worthy of the dignities, whereto they are preferred; But if
any man should say he were (...), that is, Unworthy of such preferment, the
Canon takes it as a presumption, that he is not to be admitted unto it, or as a
part of Conviction, that he deserves to be deprived of it. Now to be (...) in
the language of the Holy Ghost, is somewhat more, then to be (...), that is, to
be in no wise worthy of the preferment, which he seeks for, or enjoyes. This
is the phrase which Paul and Barnabas use unto the stubborn Jews; Acts 13. 46.
But seeing you put the word of God from you, and Judge your selves to be
Unworthy ((...)) of eternal life, Lo we turn unto the Gentiles. These Jews
then, to whom they spoke were unworthy, that is, altogether Incapable of
Eternal Life, whereof the Gentiles were, in this sense, thus far Worthy, that
they were not altogether Incapable of that free mercy and Pardon, which was
first tendered to the Jews. And this exclusion of the Jews, and admission of the
Gentiles unto everlasting life, or unto the means or pledges of it, was but the
accomplishment of our Saviors Parable, Matthew. 22. ver. 8. Then says He to his
servants, the wedding is ready, but they, which were bidden, were not Worthy.
And it is worth your nothing, that in Two of Cardinal Bellarmines forecited
Allegations, the One, Luke 20. ver. 25. The Other, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 4. is said, not
such as are Worthy, but such as shall be, or are accounted Worthy of
everlasting life; that is, such as shall be so accounted or accepted, not for
their own sake, or for their merits, but so accounted and accepted for and
through the merits of Christ, or for his imputed righteousness; for to say,
That Christ's righteousness is imputed to us, is all one, as to say, his
righteousness shall go upon our account, or that we shall not be incapable of
his Merits. For the word, to Impute, is as much (in strict propriety of speech)
as to be admitted upon an account. Thus much of the Objections made by the
Romish Church, and of the Answers unto them, which was the First General
proposed.

8. The Second was, The Confirmation of the Doctrine jointly maintained by all
reformed Churches, which (for the present) we shall confirm from One place of
Scripture (only, besides the Words of the Text, Romans 6. 23.) and Works not
properly meritorious but indeed Unworthy of eternal life.
that is, Romans 8, 18. I reckon (says the Apostle, or I give it up as upon an
account) that the sufferings of this present time, are Not Worthy [(...)] to be
compared with the glory, that shall be revealed in us.

If any Works of men Regenerate were Meritorious or Worthy of Eternal Life,
These, by our adversaries confession, should be the sufferings of Holy Martyrs,
specially of such Glorious Martyrs as St. Paul was; Yet These he says are not
Worthy to be compared unto, or, are of no Worth in respect of the glory, that
shall be revealed in us.

But if the precious names of those in Sardis, that is, the Saints there, were
to walk with God Because they were Worthy, how shall the sufferings of St, Paul
or of St. Peter be held Unworthy (...) in no wise Worthy, or most unworthy of
the glory, which was to be revealed in them? For this includes as much, if not
somewhat more, then to walk with Christ.

The Answer is ready: The Sufferings of the Saints were not Unworthy in respect
of Gods Free Grace or Mercy; not Unworthy of enjoying the benefit of his free
Pardon, for all shall be excluded from it, that are Unworthy of it.

But the grievous and most patient sufferings of the Apostles themselves are
here adjudged by our Apostle to be altogether Unworthy of the Glory that shall
be revealed, in respect of Gods Justice; Or if he should enter into Judgment
with them, after these three branches of Grace, Faith, Hope and Charity, had
fructified in them.

But have they no Answer to this Objection? Yes, Cardinal Bellarmine (the only
man, which ever that Church had for traversing the Testimony or verdict of
Scriptures, alleged by our Writers) has Two in store, or rather two branches
of one and the same answer. His answer in General is this: That our Apostle in
this place, Romans 8. 18. does speak of the Substance of works done by just and
holy men, not of the absolute Proportion between them and the glory, which
shall be revealed. If we respect the Substance of their works, they are not
equal, (for the one is momentany or temporal, and the other eternal) to the
reward or gift of God which is eternal life or glory; yet, says he, there is a
true or just Proportion between them.

9. To put a Color upon this Distinction, he gives Instance; First, in the
sufferings of our Savior, which were but temporary, and no way comparable for
duration of time with the everlasting pains of hell, which without his
sufferings we all should have suffered; and yet his temporary sufferings did
make a full and just satisfaction for the sins of men, which deserved
everlasting torments. For what was wanting to the duration or continuance of
his sufferings, was supplied by the dignity of his person, which suffered them:
In like sort (as he would have it) the worth or dignity of that charity, from
which the sufferings of Martyrs, or other good works of just and holy men do
proceed, may make up that defect, which they apparently have in respect of
their short duration or continuance.

His Second Instance is; that the pleasures or contentments of sin are in no
wise comparable to the everlasting torments of hell, which yet these momentary
pleasures justly deserve for the contempt of God and his commandments, and
thus (as he would have us believe) the good works of Saints, though but few and
short, may, through the virtue of Grace or Charity, as justly deserve eternal
glory.

10. But as his Answer in General is Sophistical, so the Instances which he
brings to prove it are most impertinent, and, if they be well scanned, most How
Christ's, temporal sufferings were of infinite merit.
pregnant for Us against him.

To the First, we reply, as all Divines agree, That Christ's sufferings, though
but temporary for duration, and for quality not infinite, did make a full
satisfaction for the sins of mankind, because the Person of the sufferer was
truly and absolutely infinite; his satisfaction or the value of his sufferings
were truly infinite, Non quia passus est infinita, sed quia passus est
infinitus: Not because he suffered infinite pains, but because He, who suffered
those grievous and unknown pains, was truly infinite. But neither the persons
of the Saints, which suffered martyrdom, nor any pains, which they suffered, or
good works, which they did, had any just Proportion to Infinity; and therefore
could not be Meritorious of eternal Glory (which is for duration infinite)
either in respect of their persons, or of their charity, which questionless was
much less then Christ's love and charity toward us, as man, though this was not
so absolutely Infinite, as the love and charity of his Godhead. So that this
Instance is not only impertinent, but altogether unadvised; and the Reader may
well wonder how such gross and somnolent incogitancie could possibly surprise
so wary a man, so great a Scholar as Cardinal Bellarmine was.

His Second Instance though it include no such gross incogitancie, as the Why
the pleasures of sin, though temporary, deserve eternal punishment.
former, nevertheless it is involved in an error, too common, not only to the
Romanist, but to many in reformed Churches. For the pleasures of sin, though
but temporary, deserve eternal death (betwixt which and them (in themselves
considered) there is no just proportion;) But the True Reason, why they justly
deserve this death, is, because men by continuing in sin, and by following the
pleasures of it, do reject or put from them the promises of Eternal Life,
betwixt which and everlasting death there is a just proportion. And when Life
and Death everlasting are proposed unto us, the One out of See this Book Fol.
3498.
Mercy, the other out of Justice, it is most Just dealing with God, to give
such as choose the pleasures of sin before the Fruits of Holiness, the native
issue of their choice: But it could not have stood with the Justice of God to
have punished our first Parents transgression with everlasting death, unless
out of his Free Bounty and liberality he had made them capable, not of a
temporal only, but of an everlasting life.

But now that Adam has sinned, and made himself and his posterity subject unto
everlasting death, does not this Original Sin or every Actual Sin, which
issues from it, deserve everlasting death?

Yes, they do; and would inevitably bring death upon all, without intervention
of Gods Mercy or Free Pardon made in Christ. But this free Pardon being
presupposed, and being proclaimed unto the world, it is not Sin Original, or
the Positive sins of men in themselves considered, which bring everlasting
death upon them, but their wilful neglect or slighting of Gods mercy promised
in Christ (or of the means, which God affords them for attaining this mercy)
which leaves them without Excuse or Apology; or which makes up the full measure
of their iniquity.

This is our Saviors Doctrine, John 3. 17. God sent not his Son into the world
to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. From what
original then does the condemnation of the world proceed? Our Savior tells us,
ver. 19. This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men
loved darkness more then light, because their deeds were evil. It is not then
the works of darkness in themselves considered, but considered with men's love
unto them or delight in them, that does induce a neglect or hate of light,
which brings condemnation upon the world. Now if the works of darkness or
pleasures of sin, which are but momentany, do not in themselves procure
everlasting death, albeit they proceed from Sin Original, much less shall the
good Works of Gods Saints, albeit they proceed from Grace, procure or deserve
everlasting life. For the Grace by which we do them, is from God, not from our
selves, but the evil works, which we do, are our own, God has no share in
them. So that the Height or Accomplishment of sin consists in the neglect or
contempt of Eternal Life, and the neglect hereof could not be so heinous, if
this life could be deserved by us, or if it were awarded to us out of Justice,
not out of mere Mercy and Grace.

11. This difference betwixt the Title, which Bad works have to Death, and the
Want of Title, which the Best works have to Life Everlasting, is most
significantly expressed by St. Paul, Romans 6. 23. The wages of sin is death, says
He, and wages are merited, are never detained without some interruption of the
course justice; But Eternal Life is not the wages of holiness, but the Gift of
God. And if in any sort it might be deserved or merited; the Apostle,
questionless, would have said, it had been, if not (...) the wages, yet (...),
the Reward of Holiness. But in as much as this word Reward sometimes includes
Rationem dati, something given as well as taken, not always a Reward of mere
bounty, therefore the Apostle does not say, it is the Reward of Holiness or
the Reward of God; Nor does he say, it is (...), which properly signifies A
Gift, for Gifts, though freely given in kindness, and not by Covenant, may be
mutual, and may include a kind of merit de congruo; as we say, One Kindness
requires another like; but our Apostle, to prevent this conceit of Merit, uses
a word, which in its true and proper signification is incompatible with the
conceit of Merit: he calls life eternal (...), that is, as the vulgar Latin
renders it, Gratia Del, the Grace of God.

CHAP. XXVIII.
ROMANS 6. 23. -- But the Gift of God (or, The Grace of God) is Everlasting
Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Whether Charismata Divina (that is) The Impressions of Gods Eternal Favor may
he merited by us. Or whether the Second, Third, and Fourth Grace, and Life
Eternal it self may be so. About Revival of Merits. The Text Heb. 6. 10. [God
is not unjust, etc.] expounded. The Questions about Merits and about
Justification have the same Issue. The Romish Doctrine of Merit derogates from
Christ's Merits. The Question (in order to practice or Application) stated
betwixt God and our own souls. Confidence in merit, and too Hasty persuasion,
that we be The Favorites of God; Two Rocks. God, in punishing Godly men,
respects their former Good Works.

1. THe Gift or Grace of God. This word Grace is sometimes taken for The Favor
of God, which in the Greek is, (...). sometimes it implies the Of the word Gift
or Grace.
Stamp or Impression of this Favor in us; and this, in the Greek, is expressed
by the word (...), used here by St. Paul; That The Favor of God cannot be
merit by any works of man, is out of Question. For it was the Favor or Free
Grace of God, which gave our First Parents Being; which continues their
posterity here on earth. And neither our first Parents nor any of their
posterity could deserve or merit their Being. This Favor of God, is, as he is,
without Beginning, without Change: But so is not (...), which is the Impression
or Effect of this Eternal Favor in us. It has no Being in us before we Be:
And after it be inherent in us, it admits of Alteration or Change in us.

The Question then is, Whether the Effects or Impressions of Gods eternal
Favor to us, may be deserved or merited by us? Or, seeing the Degrees or Parts
of Grace inherent be many, it is Controversed between the Romish Church and us,
Whether any parts of this Grace can be deserved or merited by us.

That the First Grace (that is, The first stamp or impression of Gods Favor
toward us) cannot be merited by us; They grant. For the First Grace Whether
the Grace of God, or the Effects of his Eternal Favor can be merited by us.
(as some of them say) is Fundamentum meriti, The Foundation or groundwork of
all Merits: Et fundamentum meriti non cadit sub merito. Every Merit is
precedent to the thing merited: But there can be no Merit-precedent to the
First Grace, which is the Root, the Ground or Original of all Merits: But the
Second, Third, or Fourth Grace, or Degrees of Grace, may (in their divinity) be
merited, through the Virtue or Excellency of the First Grace or First Degree
of Grace, so we use that as we should.

Between the First Degree or Seed of Grace sown in our hearts by the finger of
God, and the Full Growth or increase of it there is, as Cardinal Bellarmine
alleges, a True proportion, though no Equality: And therefore there may be
some Ground of Merit for the increase of Grace, though not for the first
beginning of it. Indeed if Grace did grow in us as trees or plants do from the
first seed, without any great care or operation of him that plants them, and if
it did thus grow without any interruption or default on our parts, there might
be some pretense for merit, or some probability at least, that the fruits of
Grace so growing should be Ours, or so far Ours, as we are our selves; because
we are the soil, wherein the first seeds of Grace were sown. But if it be God,
not we our selves, that gives the increase, if it be God that sends Paul to
plant, and Apollos to water the seeds which he has sown in us; if it be He
that made us and not we our selves; All the fruits of Grace are his by
propriety, not Ours; but only so far as he shall suffer us to enjoy them, by
continuance of the same Gracious Undeserved favor, by which he has made us,
and by which he sowes the first seeds of Grace in us.

2. But Grace (being sown or planted in us by his immediate hand; without any
Cooperation on our parts)

non -- Crescit ecculto velut arbor aevo, does not grow up in us as
wel-thriving plants out of their proper seed without ceasing or interruption,
though by degrees unsensible; for sometimes it decreaseth, oft-times it suffers
many interruptions in its growth by our default or negligence. And is it
possible, that we should deserve or merit the increase or fruits of that Grace,
whose growth (in spring) is oft-times blasted or hindered through our negligence
or wilful default? This They do not say; This (in congruity of Reason They
cannot say,) Who deny, that Grace once implanted in us cannot be displanted,
can admit no intercision in its substance or Being; however it may admit
interruptions in its growth, or some decay or waning. But the Romish Church
with her Advocates willingly grant, That Grace truly inherent in men, and
inherent in such perfect measure as inables them to fulfill the moral Law of
God, may be utterly lost, may be expelled by mortal or deadly sin; and yet may
be recovered again, but lost or expelled it cannot be without the default or
negligence, without some mortal default or negligence of him, who had it in his
custody. And yet being so lost, they hold, the like Grace, may be gotten again,
and the Grace so gotten and recovered they call The second Grace, and if it be
twice lost and so recovered, it is The third Grace. The Question then is How
the second, third, and fourth Grace is or may be recovered by us; whether by
way of Merit or desert, or only of Gods free Mercy and favor.

The first Grace being lost (though lost it cannot be without their default
that had it) the second Grace (in their Divinity) may be merited de Congruo in
congruity. And this is A strange Tenet, that seeing the First Grace cannot be
merited by any works of ours, either de Condigno or de Congruo (that is, either
out of the true worth of our works, or out of any Congruitie or proportion,
which is between them and Grace) the second Grace should be at all merited,
when the Grace, which is the Foundation of this merit, is utterly lost; this is
all one, as if they should say; The fruit may be good or fair, when the Root or
Tree, which bears it, is dead; or that the Roof may stand, when the foundation
is taken from it; or that any Accident may remain without a substance; Yet thus
to hold they are enforced, if they will speak consequently to their other Tenets
or Positions concerning the merit of works done out of Grace or charity. For
many of their Arguments, which they bring for confirmation of their merits in
General, do either conclude, That the Second Grace may be merited or awarded by
the course of Gods justice, not of mercy only; or that the Apostasy into
which they should otherwise fall, may be prevented by the virtue or efficacy
of their former works of charity; or else they conclude nothing at all for any
merit.

3. The Especial, or (as some think) the Only place of Scripture, which can
with probability be alleged for the Revival of Merits, after the Grace, See
Book 10. Fol. 3285.
from which these merits did spring, is utterly extinguished, is that, Heb. 6.
9, 10. But beloved we are persuaded better things of you, and things that
accompany salvation, though we thus speak. In the formet verses the Apostle had
threatened them with the danger of that Irremissible sin, which they call The
sin against the Holy Ghost, into which no man can fall but by forsaking the
works of his First Love.

What then is the Reason, that our Apostle does hope so well of these
backsliding Hebrews?

He grounds his hopes (as the Advocates for the Romish Church contend) not so
much upon Gods Free mercy or Favor, by which only the First Grace was
bestowed upon them, as upon Gods Justice: And if his hopes be grounded upon
Gods Justice, more then upon his Free Mereie or Favor; Then, the Recovery of
their former estate, or the prevention of that Apostasy, into which they were
falling, was more from the merit of their former works, then from Gods Free
Mercy or Grace. Now, That the Apostle did ground his hopes of their Recovery,
upon Gods Justice, they take it as proved from the tenth verse: For God is not
unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have showed
toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the Saints, and do minister.
These words seem to import, That if God at this Gods Justice and righteousness
in rewarding us does not imply the merit of our works:
time should have cast them off, He had not been just and right in his
Judgments; and if it had been any injustice in God at this time utterly to
have forsaken them; Then, their perseverance in such Grace as was left them for
the Recovery of such Grace as they had lost, was out of merit or desert, and
perhaps meritorious of the Recoverie. For every man does deserve or properly
merit that, which without injustice, or unrighteousness cannot be detained from
him. This is the most plausible argument, which they bring for the Revival of
Merits, after Grace be lost or decayed; and if merits may revive after Grace be
lost, then questionless, Whiles Grace continues without interruption or
intercision, men may merit more degrees or increase of the same Grace, and so
Finally, Everlasting Life, which is here said to be the Grace of God.

I have been bold to put this Argument, drawn from our Apostle, Heb. 6. as far
home as any Advocate for the Romish Church has done or can do, Because the
true and punctual Answer unto it will easily reach all other Arguments, which
they can draw from the like Head or Topic, as when it is said, God shall
reward us in righteousness, or as a righteous Judge, etc.

4. To this Place I Answer, That the word (...) in Greek, or Justitia in Latin
does sometimes import strict or legal Justice, as it is opposed to mercy,
favor, The diverse acceptions of Justice or righteousness.
or loving kindness. Sometimes again it imports universal Goodness, or all the
branches of Goodness. So the heathen had observed, that Justitia in sese
virtutes continet omnes, that Justice universally taken did comprehend all
virtues in it. And in this sense, A loving or friendly man is said to be A Just
or righteous man. So the holy Ghost speaks of Joseph, the betrothed Husband of
the Blessed Virgin, that being a Just man, he was not willing to make her an
example, but was minded to put her away privily; though he found her with
child, between the time of her Espousal and the time appointed for her
marriage, yet not with child by himself. Now so long as he was ignorant that
she had conceived by virtue of the Holy Ghost, it had been no injustice, but
rather a branch of Legal Justice, to have made her an example, to have had her
severely punished; for so the Law of God in this Case (as he yet understood the
Case) did not only permit, but seemed to require. And to present a fact
punishable by the Law of God is always lawful and just: Yet this was no part
of that Justice or righteousness, which the Holy Ghost commends in Joseph, when
he says, he was a just man. To be Just then in his Dialect (in this Case) was
to be A loving, a friendly and favorable man; And if the Romish Church would
take Righteousness in the same sense in those places, wherein it is said, that
he shall reward the Saints as a righteous Judge, and crown them with Glory;
their Conceit of merit could find no supportance from those Testimonies of
Scriptures, which they most allege for it.

But, To the former place in the Epistle to the Hebrews, it is further to be
noted. That our Apostle does not say there, though it be most true, (...); The
God you have to deal withal, you cannot say, is not just; but (...), he is not
unjust.

As there is a great difference between not worthy and unworthy, so is there
betwixt not Just and unjust. When our Apostle denies God to be unjust, this
Negative is Infinite, and does include all other branches of Gods Goodness,
besides that Justice by which he renders to every man his due; It specially
imports in our Apostles meaning, his favor or loving kindness, or his
unwillingness to take the advantages of Law, or strict Justice, against these
Hebrews; or a willingness not so much to remember their present misdeeds or
backslidings, in his Justice, as to remember their former works (which were
much better then their present) in mercy, favor and loving kindness.

5. But whilst they thus contend for the merit of works done by Grace, do they
not derogate from the merits of Christ, who is the only fountain of all Should
such a thing be, our meriting derogates from Christ's merits.
Grace?

We say, They do.

But They Reply, They do not; but rather magnify the merits of Christ more
then we do who deny the merits of Saints. For Christ, as they allege, did not
only merit Grace for us, but this also, that we by Grace might truly Merit. Now
grace itself, and the merit of grace, is a more Magnificent Effect of Christ's
Merits, then grace alone.

Here is a Double Effect of Christ's Merits, by their Doctrine; whereas we admit
but a single One. Thus they reply. But if the One of those two effects, which
they imagine or conceive, does derogate more (in true construction) from the
merits of Christ, then the supposal or admission of it can add unto them; We
attribute more unto his merits by the admission of One single Effect only, to
wit, mere grace, then they do by acknowledgment of Two, to wit, grace it self,
and the merit of grace, in us. But the more we are to merit by grace for our
selves, the less measure of merit, we leave unto Christ; For as See the fourth
Book, Chap. 11 16. etc. About merit and justification: The place, perhaps
related to in the next paragraph.
that which he merited for us, is not ours, but his; so, that which we merit
for ourselves, is not His, but Ours. The merit of grace supposes a Fullness or
Fountain of grace, and Fountain of grace there is no other but Christ himself;
nor is there any Fullness of grace but in him only: For of his fullness (as the
Evangelist says, John 1. 16.) we all have received grace for grace, that is,
grace upon Grace. Every degree or greater measure of Grace, which we receive,
does flow alike immediately from the fullness of this inexhaustible Fountain of
Grace without any secondary Fountain or Feeders. Grace does not grow in us as
Rivers do, which, although they have one main spring or fountain, yet they grow
not to any greatness without the help of secondary Fountains, or concurrence of
many springs or feeders. Grace does so immediately come from Christ, as the
Rivers do from the sea; Increase of Grace does come as immediately from Christ,
as the increase of Rivers from rain, or as the increase of light in the waxing
Moon comes from the Sun.

6. The state of this Question concerning The merits of works, comes to the
same issue with that other Great question concering Justification; As whether
Of Justification, the doctrine whereof is corrupted by the doctrine of Merit.
it be by faith alone, or by faith and works. The Romish Church grants, that we
are justified by faith in Christ's blood or merits, Tanquam per Causam
efficientem, as by a true efficient Cause; seeing all the Grace, which we first
receive, is bestowed upon us for Christ's sake. But they hold withal, that it
is the Grace which for Christ's sake is bestowed upon us, by which we are
formally justified, that is, As water poured into a vessel does immediately
expel the air, which was in it before; so the infusion of Grace for the merits
of Christ does expel sin, whether Original or actual, out of our souls. And
this (in their Language) is The remission of sins, for the attaining whereof
There needs no imputation of Christ's righteousness after Grace be once infused.

The formal Cause of every thing requires some efficient or Agent for the
production or resultance of it; but being once produced or existent, it
excludes the interposition or intervention of any other Cause whatsoever for
the production or existence of its formal Effect. To produce heat in the water
it is impossible without the Agency or Efficiency of fire; but the water being
made scalding hot by the heat of fire, will heat or scald the flesh of of man
or other living creature although it be removed from the fire, although it work
only in its own strength or of the heat inherent in it. Thus, say the
Romanists, that grace cannot be produced in us but by the virtue and efficiency
of Christ's merits, but being by them once produced, it does justify us
immediately by the strength and virtue of it inherent in us, and by the same
strength and virtue working in us it does produce its formal effect, to wit,
the increase of grace, and lastly eternal life.

But if this Doctrine of theirs (so far as it concerns Justification or the
Remission of sins) were true, then this inconvenience (as I have elsewhere
showed) would necessarily follow, That no man already after this manner
justified could say or repeat that Petition in our Lords Prayer [Forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us:] without a mockery
of God or Christ. For if our sins be formally remitted by the infusion of
grace, and if by the infusion of the same grace we be formally justified, the
only true meaning of this Petition is in true Resolution, This; Lord makes us
such, or remit our sins after such a manner, that we shall not stand in need of
thy remission or forgivenss of them, or that we shall not stand in need of the
mediation of thine only Son: For if they be remitted immediately by grace, so
long as this grace endures, all mediation is superfluous, is impossible.

This Inconvenience is farther improved by the same Doctrine so far as it
concerns the merits of works done in charity; And prophanes those Two other
Petitions in the same our Lords Prayer [Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done in
earth, as it is in heaven:] no less then their Doctrine of Justification does
that Petition [Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass
against us,] For if works done by grace or charity could truly merit eternal
life, the effect of all the three Petitions should be but this, Lord let thy
Kingdom of Grace so come unto us, Lord let thy will be so done by us here on
earth, that as we have been long debtors unto thee for giving thine only Son to
die for our sins, and for the purchasing of the First Grace unto us, so let us
by this grace be enabled to make both Thee and Him debtors to us by the merit
of this grace, and debtors in no meaner a sum then the retribution or payment
of Eternal Life. For if that life can be merited by our works, then God does
owe it unto us for our works; And if it be due unto us by merit or by debt,
then it is not, as our Apostle has it in this 23. verse, the gift of God, or
(...), as the Original has it, the Grace of God; The Apostle might as well
have said, that Eternal Life was as truly the wages of our righteousness, as
death is the wages of our sin.

And so the best Scholars in the Romish Church do grant he might have said.
What then is the Reason why he did not say so? Of this they give us This
Reason. Inasmuch (say they) as the First grace, by which we merit the Kingdom
of heaven, is freely given us without any merit precedent, therefore the
Kingdom of heaven it self or life eternal, although it be truly merited, yet is
called by our Apostle The gift of God, not the stipend or wages of God. In
giving this Reason they speak very consequently to their former Position, that
we are justified by Christ only, as by the Efficient Cause, but immediately and
formally justified by grace inherent in us, though merited for us by Christ.
But would to God they would learn at length to speak as consequently to the
truth delivered here, Romans 6. 23. verse, by our Apostle, as they do to their
own Tenets, or to the Canon of the Trent Council concerning Justification:
which Tenet or Canon neither Calvin nor Chemnitius, which examined that Canon,
could more punctually have crossed after it was made, then our Apostle here in
this verse did almost 1500. years before it was made: For he does not say that
Eternal Life is the grace of God (...), for Christ's sake, or for his merit,
which might denote only the efficient Cause; but, that it is, the grace of God
(...) in or through Jesus Christ our Lord. This imports not the efficient only
but the immediate and next Cause of this gift of God, it excludes the
interposition or intervention of any Causality whatsoever besides Christ.

And thus much here, Of the state or issue of the controversy betwixt us and
the Romish Church concerning merits;

The Appendix or second Branch whereof (according to the order proposed in the
twenty seventh Chapter, Section 1.) was; The state of this very Question,
Betwixt God the righteous Judge of All, and our own souls or Consciences, or if
you will, betwixt our Consciences and us. And this being rightly stated, will
put into our mouths That true confession which every Christian soul must make,
so often as it shall become A Petitioner unto God who made it.

7. This we know, and all do grant, That God made the First Man righteous.
Whether this Original righteousness were a supernatural Grace or no, is A
question betwixt us and the Romish Church, and it has been touched by us, if
not thoroughly handled in the very entrance or beginning of the tenth Book.
Certain it is, that it was A Grace, and either a part of man's Being (or of our
nature, as it was the workmanship of God;) or A Grace conferred upon our nature
with its First Being: And A Grace, which could no way be Merited either De
condigno, or de congruo. Their very First Being was the mere gift of God. So
were all the Qualifications and Graces wherewith it was endued. Suppose man had
continued in this first estate, this had been but a continuance of that free
Gift of God, which was bestowed upon him with his beginning. If he had been
advanced or translated to a better or more perfect estate, this likewise had
been a new Free Gift or Grace of God, which could not be Merited by man: For
his very First Estate was more worth, then all the Labor and endeavors, which
God required at his hands for the preserving of it; so that he was still
indebted unto God as well for every moment or hour of life in such an happy
estate, as he was for his first Creation; and if he had been advanced to any
better estate, this had made him a new Debtor unto his Maker, it had been more
then A Continuance of the former Debt. The utmost issue or best effect of all
his endeavors could only have made him Capable or not unworthy of the
Continuance of Gods Favor and grace, which he most freely extends to all, that
do not make themselves Unworthy of them: That the First Man then was endowed
with grace, this was Gods sole Work: That he made himself unworthy of this
First Grace, and so lost it, this was his own work. Yet after he had made
himself and his posterity thus Unworthy of the First Grace, God bestows a
Second upon him, the Grace of Redemption, and this Grace could not be merited
by him; it was A more Free gift of God, then his first Creation was; That was
an Act or gift of his Bounty, this later, was An Act of his abundant Mercy.
Bounty extends it self to such as are not worthy of it; but Mercy reaches to
such as are most unworthy of Bounty, to such as deserve the severity of
punitive Justice. What shall we say then? that the Second grace, which was
promised to mankind in the woman's seed, though it cannot be merited by any, yet
being freely and actually bestowed upon them, may merit the Continuance of it,
the Increase of it, or advancement to a better Estate?

8. To be freed from the Sentence of Death, which was denounced against our
First Parents is an extraordinary Grace or Blessing of God, and This Blessing
we all receive by the Grace of Baptism: and this Blessing we all enjoy so long
as we continue in Grace; and the longer we enjoy this Grace or blessing, the
more still we are indebted to our Gracious God, then they are, which never
receive it, which want it.

Now it is not possible that we should merit any thing at Gods hands by the
long enjoyment of that blessing, which the longer, or in greater measure we
enjoy, the more still we are indebted unto him, that gives it. To what use or
end then does this Grace serve? Only to make us more indebted to God, then we
were for our natural Being? Nay! But to make us see the misery of our First
Estate better then we could possibly see it whilst we continued in it, and
to enable us to make a better and more thankful acknowledgment of our Debt to
God for all his blessings, then without this Grace (or this blessing of
Redemption) we possibly could do. Let the Advocates then of the Romish Church
extol the excellency of Grace unto the Skies or Heavens, whence it descends, we
will not in this contradict them, but only request them to consider, that the
more excellent Grace in it self is, the greater should their condemnation be,
that make no better use of it then they do, if God should enter into Judgment
with them. And certainly that man has received but a mean portion or Talent of
Grace, which sees not his accounts to God to be much increased, if God should
call him to a strict account for not employing his Talent, or not stirring up
that Grace of God, which is in him.

9. But suppose we did stir up this Grace, or suffer our selves to be stirred
up by it to good works, to what use or end does our fruitfulness in Good Works
serve? To this end only, that we may not be found unworthy either of the
Continuance of Gods Gracious Favor, or of the Continual Increase of it.

To acknowledge the First Receipt of Grace to be the sole work of God, and yet
to ascribe in part the Increase of it to our own Merits, or right use of it, is
no more then the Pharisee confessed, when he said, Lord, I thank thee that I am
not as other men are, nor as this Publicane. Here was a true acknowledgement,
that he received this Grace (by whose good use he thought himself better then
other men) freely from God. But in making this Comparison, he gloried as if he
had not received it; or, as if, having received it, he was not so great a
Debtor unto God, as the Publicane was, nor liable to the same Account for his
sins past or present. Questionless this Pharisee had been partaker of better
Grace, at least of better means of salvation, then the Publican had been. And
if this conceit of his own worth, in comparison of other men, had not polluted
his works, there is no Question but that he had been more righteous then the
Publican, yet the Publican went home more justified then the Pharisee; not for
the worth of any good works, which he had done, but by unfeigned acknowledgment
of his own Unworthiness, if God should have entered into Judgment with him.

That Form of Prayer or acknowledgment, which the Publican made, would at this
day well beseem even those, which have received a greater measure of Grace,
then either he or the Pharisee had done; even those, which have been more
fruitful in Good Works, then both of them were. Or if the Publican be no fit
person for sanctified men to imitate; certainly the Prophet Daniel is a fit
one, and yet his confession of his own unworthiness, if God should have dealt
in Justice with him, was more pathetically humble, then the Publicans was, Dan.
9. 8, 9. Oh Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our Kings, to our
Princes, and to our Fathers, because we have sinned against thee; to thee, O
Lord our God, belongs mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled
against thee. He places no part of his Confidence in the Merit either of his
prayer or fasting, which yet were both excellent works, proceeding from
charity, and excellently performed by him: but how excellently soever these
Duties be performed by him or any, they neither can Merit ought for their own
worth in themselves, nor from the virtue of Gods promises, for all his promises
are promises of Mercy, and he that seeks for mercy, though promised by God,
must sincerely and seriously renounce all works, even the best works which he
has done; that is, he must disclaim all Merit or confidence in works,
otherwise he cannot take hold of Gods promises of mercy, but solliciteth God
to deal in justice with him. How works are excluded from Justification.


10. And yet here I must request the Reader to call that to mind, which has
been often inculcated before, that whenever our Apostle excludes all works
from Justification or Election, he is to be understood only of Confidence in
Works, or Conceit of Merit. He excludes not their Presence, but necessarily
requires it to our Justification, as to the making of our Election sure, He
only denies any Causal Efficiencie in them for procuring these or the like
blessings of God; least of all, for obtaining of eternal life, unto which Good
works are most necessary. For our Apostle takes it as granted, that we must
deny our selves before we can do any good works; but we must do good works
before we can renounce them, and we must renounce them in all our suits and
pleas, specially for those blessings, which God, out of his Free Grace and
mercy, promised us. A Doctrine, which would to God some late Writers of
Reformed Churches had taken into serious consideration, whilst they earnestly
pleaded for the Free Grace of God in our Election. For so they would never have
taught us, as (to my apprehension) they do, that our Election to Eternal life
is a more free grace of God then the donation of Eternal life it self, then
which, as no blessing of God is more Great, so none can be more Free. But the
absolute Freedom of the Gift does no way exclude but rather require some
Qualifications in the Donee: and for this Reason it is, that the practice of
Good works is in special sort required for the attaining of Eternal Life;
Because That is the greatest and most Free Act of Grace, which The God of
Mercy has to bestow upon us: in respect of it our best deeds are most
unworthy, and the less worthy they are, the more unfeignedly they are to be
renounced: And seeing our Apostle, when he excludes works from any plea of
mercy, does only exclude Confidence or Conceit of Merit in them; in whatsoever
sense he excludes them from Election or Justification, he excludes them in an
higher degree of the same sense, from the Donation of eternal Life; Otherwise
that could not be (as our Apostle says) (...), the Free Gift of God.

11. But as in all other points of Controversy betwixt Us and the Romish
Church, so in this specially concerning Merits, I am always jealous of both
Two rocks to be avoid here, Confid. in merit of Works, and Praemature conceit
or presumption of our Election.
Readers and Hearers, lest whilst they hear one Error refuted, they take
occasion to run into the Contrary. For preventing this inconvenience in this
present point I must Request all in the First Place to Observe, that Both of us
fully agree in this General, that God is a Rewarder of them that seek him; and
no man can truly seek him, but by a true and lively working Faith. The Question
betwixt us is only this; Whether God Reward such as seek him according to the
Rule of Justice, or according to the Rule of his boundless Mercy; or whether
our works (his Grace and promise presupposed) be worthy of his Reward, or only
make us not altogether unworthy or not incapable of his Mercy.

The Second Point which I would commend to all men's Consideration is This, that
as our Apostle in the forecited place, Heb. 6. does not ground his hope of
those Hebrews recovery upon Gods Justice, so he does not ground it upon the
Infallibility or immutable estate of their Election. He does not so much as
intimate that they could not possibly fall, because their persons were Elected,
for this was more then either he or they knew, more then most men can possibly
know, more then any man in their Case may safely persuade himself. He that
makes his personal Election the only Anchor of his Faith, in such temptations
as these Hebrews at that time were overtaken with, shall fall into as bad,
perhaps a worse, Error, then if he held, That his Good works formerly done
might merit his Recovery unto his former estate, so he will but address himself
to do the like.

This Conceit of merit (though we take men in their best estate, or when they
are least conscious of grosser sins) is a Symptom of heathenish pride or
ignorance. For the Heathens thought they could make the Gods or divine Powers
beholding unto them. But to stay our selves in the consciousness of grievous
sins lately committed upon persuasions of our personal Election, is the most
dangerous root of Hypocritical Pride that can be planted in our corrupt nature.

Now any Symptom or Branch of pride or vainglory is less deadly then the Root
of Pride, vainglory or pharisaical hypocrisy. Far be it from any of us to
think, that the like sin committed by a man regenerate does not deserve
worse at Gods hands, then if it had been committed by an unregenerate or mere
natural man, because he thinks himself to be of the number of the Elect; For if
this sin or transgression be for Substance the same, the Circumstances make it
a great deal worse in a regenerate, then in a mere natural man. That saying of
the heathen Satyrist or Censurer of ill manners holds as true in Divinity as
in Morality:

Omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se
Crimen habet, quanto major qui peccat habetur.
The crime or fault is so much the greater, by how much the party offending is
in his own esteem or others better qualified.

12. From what Original is it then, that the righteous Judge does oft-times
less punish the sins of men, which have lived a godly life, then he does the
like sins in men not as yet regenerate, or in men that have been altogether
barren of good works? The true Resolution of this Problem or Question must be
taken from that general rule or Maxim, That God will render to every man
according to all his ways either in Justice or in mercy. Now albeit God
always punish the ungodly in this life Citra condignum in less measure then
they deserve, because his mercy and long suffering inhibits the execution of
his punitive justice; yet he always rewards the good works, which we do, Ultra
condignum, far above their deservings; for albeit the best works, which we can
do, deserve no reward at all, yet his infinite goodness will not suffer the
least good works, which we do, to go without his Reward. Rewarded we shall be
either with some Positive Blessing or with the Mitigation of some punishment,
which our evil works had justly deserved. From this Original it is, that albeit
the bad works of men regenerate, or endowed with grace, do weigh heavier in the
scale of Gods Justice, then the like works of men unregenerate do; yet they do
not sway so much, because whiles he weighes the bad works of men regenerate in
the scale of his justice, he weighes the good works, which they have formerly
done, in the scale of his mercy and bounty. But as for such as have lived a
lewd and godless life, and have made themselves unworthy of his mercy, their
grosser sins are weighed in the scale of his Justice without a Counterpoize,
and therefore do sway the further, and nearer toward hell, albeit for their
nature and quality they be not more heinous, then some offenses of the
regenerate. So that God is no Accepter of persons, albeit in this life he
punishes the same sin more grievously in one, then in another; for this he
does not with any respect unto their persons, but with respect unto his own
mercy, whereof the one sort are Capable, the other are altogether unworthy. And
this was the true meaning of our Apostle, and the ground of his Hope or good
persuasion of these Hebrews Chap. 6. ver. 9, 10. But we are persuaded better
things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For God is not unrighteous
to forget your works and labor of love which ye have showed toward his name,
in that ye have Ministered to the Saints, and do Minister.

CHAP. XXIX.
ROMANS 6. 23. -- But the Gift of God is Eternal Life, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.
Three Points. 1. Eternal Life the most Free Gift of God both in Respect of The
Donor and of The Donee. 2. Yet does not the Sovereign Freeness of the Gift
exclude all Qualifications in the Donees: rather requires better in them then
others which exclude it or themselves from it. (Whether the Kingdom of Heaven
was prepared for all or for a certain number.) 3. The first Qualification for
Grace is to become as little children. A parallel of the conditions of Infants:
and of Christians truly humble and meek.

1. THe Points remaining to be handled are Three. The First is in part touched
before: That Eternal Life is nor only The gift of God, or as the Vulgar renders
the Original Gratia Dei, but (...), The gift of God (...), that is (as if you
would say) The Gift of Gifts, the greatest Gift, and the Freest Gift, that God
has to bestow on mankind for, in, or through Christ Jesus our Lord. The
second; that, The Absolute Freedom or graciousness of this Gift does not
exclude all Qualifications of works or inclinations to good works, but only
confidence in works.

The third is, The Qualification required in all such as hope to receive this
Gift; or, The manner how they are to work out their own salvation, that they
may be capable, or at least not Totally incapable of this free gift.

To the first, That Eternal Life is the Gift of Gifts, or the most free or
Gracious Gift, that God has to bestow on man, may be easily proved from
Eternal life a most Free Gift of God.
the Conditions required in a Free Gift. And These are Two. The first respects
the estate or condition of the Donor, as that he be not tied by any necessity
either natural, moral, or politic to bestow his benevolence. The second
condition respects the Donee; And it is Absentia, if not Carentia meriti; Being
without, if not a want of desert or merit: In both respects Life Eternal is
(...), that is, The most excellent and most undeserved Gift, that can be given.

That it is freely given without any constraint or Tie of necessity, is clear;
For no operations of the most Holy and Blessed Trinity besides the Eternal
Generation of the Son of God, and the Eternal Procession of the Holy Ghost,
have any Natural necessity in them. These be operations of the Divine nature:
all extraneous things are works of Gods divine will and pleasure. God, who
works all things, works all things else according to the Counsel of his
Will; that is, he so works them, he so preserves and orders them, as it
was free for him from eternity not to make them, not to preserve them, not so
to order them, as he does. He was when the world was not, and might so have
continued. And this clearly evinceth that there was no Natural necessity, why
he should create the world, or any thing in it; for so the world should have
been, as he is, eternal without beginning. Nor was there any Moral necessity,
that he should create the world, or man, or Angel; for none could have
impeached him of injustice or unkindness, or of other transgression of any Law
or Rule, if he had never given them such Being, as they have. Nor was there any
Politic necessity, that he should Gods infinite Freedom.
create the world or man or Angel, in whose creation he had no respect to any
private end; he gained nothing by their Being; the best of them are but
Unprofitable servants.

2. It was free then for God to create or not to create man: but as it was his
pleasure to create him; so it was necessary that man being created by him, he
should be created good and righteous. Suppose then the First man had continued
in his First Estate, that is, righteous and good; his righteousness could have
merited nothing of God, much less Eternal Life. It was as free to God to have
annihilated him, or to have resolved him into nothing, as it was to make him of
nothing. Indeed to have punished him with everlasting death, unless he had
wilfully, and through his own default, lost his Orginal righteousness, could
not have stood with the righteousness or goodness of God. There was a moral
necessity that his Creator should not punish him with everlasting death,
unless he had transgressed his Law, and made himself unworthy of everlasting
life. But the First Man did wilfully and freely (that is, without any
necessity) transgress the Law of his God, and make himself, and his posterity
unworthy of eternal life. That God upon this transgression did not instantly
punish him with everlasting death, this was An Act of the Free Grace and mercy
of God: thus he might have done without any impeachment to his Justice, without
any disparagement to his Goodness.

That unto man thus ill deserving he made A Promise of Redemption, and of
Restitution to a better Estate, then he lost, this was An Act of his Mercy and
gracious goodness; a more Free Act then his first Creation; For that was not
deserved and therefore Free; But not so Free as the Promise of his Redemption,
after he had justly deserved the contrary, to wit, condemnation unto
everlasting death. But this Promise of Redemption through the Woman's Seed being
freely made; is not the performance of it on Gods part necessary? Is he not
bound by promise to bestow his Grace on all them, to whom he promised
Redemption? Though he be Debtor unto no man, yet he is Faithful in himself and
cannot deny himself, or not perform, what he has promised. It is true; if the
parties to whom he promises do so demean themselves as they should, or as by
the Second Covenant they stand bound. But who is he can make this Plea with
God? Who is he, that can truly say, there was any necessity at that time when
the promise was made to our first Parents in the Woman's Seed, that he should be
begotten or born, or that he was such a child of promise, from the time of
Adams Fall, as Isaac was? And if there were no necessity then, that he should
be born, what necessity is there that he should be partaker of Grace after he
is born? Or what necessity is there, that after the Grace of Baptism received
he should come to be of the number of the Elect? No man can plead any worth or
merit in himself for the receiving of Grace; or any necessity, whereby God is
tied by promise or otherwise to bestow Grace or perseverance in Grace upon him
in particular. The true way of laying hold on General Promises.


These and the like Favors must still be sought for by the Prayer of Faith;
that is, by unfeigned acknowledgement of our own unworthiness, and of Gods
Free Mercy, not only in making the First Decree concerning man's Redemption,
but in continual dispensing the Effects of the same Decree, or the means of our
Salvation: This is the only way, To lay hold upon the General Promise.

3. It was no Contradiction in Cardinal Bellarmine (as some conceive it) after
he had strongly disputed for Merit of Works, thus to conclude, Tutissimum est,
It is the safest way to place our Confidence in the Merits of Christ. This
Resolution of his will truly infer, that albeit the Question concerning
Merits were doubtful, yet we Protestants take the more useful and safer way,
and the way which Cardinal Bellarmine himself in his Devotions, and, as I hope,
on his death bed, did take.

Yet admit his Doctrine concerning Merits, had been true indefinitely taken;
There had been no Contradiction between his Premises and Conclusion; For many
things, which are unquestionable in Thesi, or in the General, are doubtful or
uncertain in Hypothesi, when we come to make particular Application. This
Doctrine is most true in Thesi, That God is faithful in all his promises, that
he cannot deny himself, or falsify his promise; Yet is it not safe for Thee or
Me thus to infer: that God cannot deny eternal life to us in particular,
because he has promised it as sincerely to Thee or Me, as to any others: The
absolute It follows not; God cannot deny himself; ergo, I am in, and shall
persevere in the state of Salvation.
and unchangeable Fidelity of God will not infer (how strongly soever we
believe it) That either Thou or I are faithful for the present; or shall
continue faithful unto the End, or until our final victory over the devil,
the world, and the flesh; which is the True Importance of this Phrase [To the
End] in many places of Scripture.

Now Gods promise of eternal Life is not immediately terminated To any man's
Person or Individual Entity, but unto such as continue faithful unto the End,
or unto such as overcome; as you may observe in many places of Scripture;
especially, in the second and third Chapters of The Revelation of St. John. Now
it is a great deal more easy for a man to assure himself that he is faithful
for the present, or victorious in respect of instant temptations, then to
assure himself that he shall continue victorious in respect of temptations that
may befall him. And yet in respect of the deceitfulness of our own hearts, it is
not safe for most men to make it as an Article of their Faith, or point of
Absolute Belief, that they are so faithful for the present, as that God cannot
deny Eternal Life unto them, though not in respect of their Merits, yet in
respect of his Promise, if they should instantly depart this life; So that such
as have as full and perfect Interest in the Promises of God, as others have,
may forfeit their Interest, as well by Immature Persuasions or Presumptions,
that Equally dangerous to confide in Merit, and to presume of Election.
they are of the number of the Elect, as by conceit of Merit or Confidence in
works. Both persuasions are dangerous, because both prejudice the Free Mercy
and Grace of God in bestowing eternal Life, or in dispensing the means required
unto it. The Romish Church says, it was Free for God to give us Grace (or
ability to do the works of Grace) or not to give it; but this Grace being
Freely given, and the works performed, it is not Free, but Necessary in respect
of Gods Justice, to give eternal Life as the Reward of Works. Others, opposite
enough to the Papists, say, that it was Free for God to Elect, or not to Elect
us unto eternal Life: but being Elected, it is not Free for God to deny eternal
Life unto us; For this, in their language, were to deny himself, or falsify
his promise. Yet by their leave, If we were thus Elected from Eternity, it was
never Free for God to Elect or not to Elect us: and so eternal Life should not
be the Award of Gods Free Merry and Grace as now present, but an Act of his
Fidelity or promise past, before we had any being, before the world was made.
But if God had not the same Free Power at this day to Elect or not to Elect any
man now living, or not the same Free Power to show mercy on whom he will, and
to harden whom he will, which it is supposed once he had, he should not have
the same Power over us, which the Sea Book 10. Chap. 42. Fol. 3228.
Potter has over his Clay, which is at his free disposal, not only before he
works it, but while it is in working.

I may conclude this Point with Cardinal Bellarmines, Tutissimum est, It is the
safest way, the only way, absolutely to rely all our life time upon Gods Free
mercy and Grace, and to make continual supplications unto God the Father
through Christ, that as he has prepared a Kingdom for us from the foundation
of the world, so he would prepare and fit us for it: For without preparation or
fit Qualification, we are not capable of it; and thus we come unto the Second
Point proposed.

4. The Second Point (to which the Third is annexed or sub-joyned) The Free
Gift of eternal life excludes not due Qualifications in the receiver.
was, That the Absolute Freedom of this Gift does not exclude all
Qualifications in the parties, on whom it is bestowed, but rather requires
better qualifications in them, then can be found in others, which exclude it,
or make themselves incapable of it.

The Truth of this Assertion you may easily conceive by this one Instance or
Example. Suppose you, that are Governors of this This was preached at Newcastle
upon Tine.
Corporation, should Found (as God put it in your hearts to do) a Goodly
Hospital or Almeshouse at your own proper cost and charges, the Gift would be
most Free, a Gracious Gift or Foundation; and yet no man would conceive that
the doors of that house, though most Freely Founded, should be as open, or the
good things belonging to it as Free for thieves and robbers for Bands or
Panders, for sturdy and lazy Beggars, as for the halt and lame, for the aged
and impotent, or as for men of decayed estate by Casualties, as for Widows or
Orphans; not so free or open, for persons so qualified, but otherwise, haughty
and proud, as for Widows or for decayed persons that were pious, humble,
modest and ingenuous. He should wrong you much, that should conceive, that you
did intend only to have the number filled up, though it were by such as the
Poet describes, but in a verse somewhat better;

Qui numeri essent, and fruges consumere nati. That is, by persons good for
nothing, but only to devour Gods Blessings. To admit all sorts of people
promiscuously into such a Foundation without respect of any Good Qualification,
would be an Act of Prodigality or impiety, rather then of Free Bounty or
Gracious Charity. And can you imagine or suspect that the most just and
righteous Judge, the only wise immortal God, who requires no more of us, then
that we should be perfect as he is perfect, that we should be bountiful as he
is bountiful, and merciful as he is merciful, does not more constantly observe
the Rules of his eternal Equity, Bounty and Mercy, then we can observe our
Saviors Rules, which are but the Copy of them, albeit we made this our chief
care and only study? Thus to do, is natural unto him, not so unto us: we cannot
imitate the paterns, which He sets us, without much difficulty, and many
interruptions. We may Freely bestow our Alms or Rewards, but we cannot qualify
the parties that are to receive them; we may prepare good things for them, but
we cannot prepare their hearts to receive them well or worthily. But God does
not only prepare the Kingdom of Heaven for us, but must also prepare us for it:
otherwise as our Apostle speaks, Heb. 4. 1. We shall come short of the promise
which is left us for entering into his rest. And no man can come short of the
promise, or of the blessing promised, but he that had a true Interest in the
promise, or he, for whom the blessing promised was prepared.

5. What shall we say then, That any, for whom the Kingdom of Heaven was
prepared from the Foundation of the world, shall finally miss of it, or be For
whom was the Kingdom of heaven prepared?
excluded from it, at the end of the world? so our Apostle in the forecited
place evidently supposes.

Was it then prepared for all, or for a Certain number?

A curious and ticklish Question: Yet about which if any Contention have grown
or may grow, this cannot arise but only from the malice, ignorance, or
incogitancie of the men, which dispute and handle it. For between these two
Propositions themselves [The Kindom of Heaven was prepared for all; The Kingdom
of Heaven was not prepared for all;] there is no Contradiction, if men would
not look upon them through some imperfect Logical Rules, which hold true only
in some Cases or Subjects: If we should say [That the Kingdom See the 10. Book
Chapt. 42. Fol. 3236. etc.
of heaven was prepared for the self same man (Saint Peter for example) from
Eternity; And, The kingdom of heaven was not prepared for the same Saint Peter
from Eternity:] we should say no otherwise then the Holy Ghost has taught us.
There is no more Contradiction between the Affirmative and the Negative, then
if one should say [The inhabitants of this town are rich; The Inhabitants of
this town are not rich, but poor.]

The Rule is general; that Betwixt an Indefinite Affirmative, and an
Indefinite Negative there is no Contradiction. Now though Saint Peter were all
his life time One and the same Individual man for Person, if we consider him
only as he stands in the Predicament of substance, yet he was not all his life
time One and the self same Object in respect of Gods decree of mercy or
Judgment, or for the preparation of Eternal life. To affirm this were to
contradict the Holy Spirit, whose unquestionable Maxim it is; that God renders
to every man according to all his ways. Now if Saint Peter's ways and works
were not at all times the same, he was not at all times the same individual
Object of Gods Decree. God had One Award for him whilst he denied his Master,
or dissuaded him from under-going the Cross for us; and Another Award for him
whilst he resolutely confessed Christ before Princes, though certain to undergo
the Cross himself for so doing.

6. But where does The Spirit of God teach us this Logic, or thus to
distinguish? Matthew. 20. ver. 23. Mark 10. 40. The story is plain, save that the
one Evangelist says, It was the mother of Zebedees children; The other says,
that the sons themselves (to wit, John and James) came with this Petition unto
our Savior, that The one might sit on the right hand, the other on his left
hand in his Kingdom. And it is plain out of Saint Matthew, that the Petition
was as well exhibited by the sons, as by the mother; as it is likewise plain by
our Saviors Reply; and his Interrogation: ye know not (says he) what ye ask:
To drink of the cup, whereof he did drink, and to be baptized with the baptism
where with he was baptized he grants was possible for them, though perhaps in
another sense then they conceived, when they answered his Interrogatory.
However, to sit on his left hand or on his right hand, as he finally concludes,
was not his to give, but was to be given to them, for whom it was prepared by
his Father.

But hence arises A Dilemma Captious at the first sight; for, If the Kingdom
of heaven were prepared for these two Apostles, then it was his to give them;
for he must give it to them, for whom it is prepared; and so he gave it to the
Thief upon the Cross: Or if the Kingdom of heaven were not prepared for them
from the beginning of the world, they might not, they could not enter into it.
What shall we say then; that James and John did never enter the Kingdom of
heaven? God for bib! the very phrase and Character of our Saviors Speech, and
the circumstance of the Text should (me thinks) call that Logical Distinction
to any man's mind, that had ever learned it, or known it before; if not teach
such, as knew it not, to make it.

The Distinction I mean of Sensus divisus and compositus, which indeed is the
only Distinction for resolving many difficulties in Divinity, for the
Resolution of which, many other impertinent and unartificial ones have been,
and are daily, sought out. The meaning of the Distinction in this particular
Humility a necessary qualification.
is this, If we consider James and John with their present Qualifications, it
is true that the Kingdom of Heaven was not prepared for them, they could not
enter in at the strait gate, that leads unto it, until their present swelling
humor of secular ambition or pride was assuaged; for God from eternity had
excluded pride and ambition from any inheritance in the Kingdom of his Son. But
this bad habit or disposition being laid aside, and the contrary (wherewith as
yet they were not invested) to wit, true humility, being put upon them, the
Kingdom of Heaven was prepared for them, and prepared for them thus qualified
from the Foundation of the world. Our Saviors Answer unto them imports no more
then Saint Peter does, when he says, Deus dat gratiam humilibus, sed resistit
superbis, God gives grace to the humble, but resists the proud; and so our
Savior repels their Petition for the present, because it did proceed from
secular pride; and from this particular took occasion, not only to teach James
and John, but the other Ten also, the necessity of humility, as a
qualification without which no man shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
either into the Kingdom of Grace in this life, or into the Kingdom of glory in
the life to come.

7. For albeit the other Ten did much mislike this ambitious humor of James
and John; yet (as one observes) that, Diogenes Calcavit fastum Platonis cum
majori fastu: So the Ten Apostles bewray more then a spice of the like
ambitious humor in themselves by the manner of their mislike or indignation at
the Petition of James and John. Unwilling they were to give place and
precedence unto them, albeit they were their Lord and Masters kinsmen; when the
ten heard it (says Saint Matthew. 20. 24.) they were moved with indignation
against the two brethren; but Jesus called them unto him and said, ye know the
Princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they, that are great,
exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever
will be great among you, let him be your minister: and whosoever will be chief
among you, let him be your servant, Even as the Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. The
same Lesson had been taught them twice before; As, Mark. 9. 34. by the way they
had disputed amongst themselves, who should be greatest: and he sat down, and
called the twelve and says unto them, If any desire to be first, he shall be
the last of all, and servant of all; and he took a child, and set him in the
midst of them, and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me, and
whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me. This
admonition you see does equally The third Point.
concern all the Twelve: not James and John alone. The Tenor of the admonition
is this; that no man is fit for the Kingdom of heaven, unless he become as a
child, unless, he receive it as a child, that is, unless they better affect a
humble and childish disposition, as well in themselves, as in others, then any
pre-eminence or worldly dignity. Thus much our Savior expressly taught them,
Mark 10. 13. They brought young children unto him, that he should touch them;
and his disciples rebuked those, that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he
was much displeased, and says unto them; Suffer the little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the Kingdom of God Verily I say
unto you, whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he
shall not enter therein; and he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon
them, and blessed them. Thus he treated them, not with reference to their
Individual Persons, but to their Qualifications; hereby giving his disciples to
understand, that all such as seek to be actually blessed by him, whatsoever
their Parentage, or other Prerogatives be, they must be so qualified, as these
children were; not so qualified, they are not capable of the Kingdom of Heaven.
We must so demean our selves toward our heavenly Father, out of knowledge and
deliberation, The Qualification for receiving this Free Gift.
as little children do themselves toward their earthly parents out of
simplicity or instinct of nature. In respect of malice toward. God or man we
must be as little children, but in knowledge of our own infirmities, or more
then childish impotency, we must be men.

8. To parallel the Conditions or properties of little children by nature, with
the properties of the children of God by supernatural Grace. The very
Impotencie of little children, whilst they learn to go, includes a power, at
least a proneness to fall, though it be in the sink or channel; but no power at
all either to raise themselves, or to make clean their garments from such stain
or filth, as they have contracted by their fall. In this property we agree too
well with them; for as St. Austine says, Sufficit sibi liberum arbitrium
admalum, adbonum non. We have a Liberty or Freedom of Will to defile our
garments by falling or backsliding after Baptism; but no Freedom of will, no
power of our selves to rise again unto newness of life. The Knowledge, wherein
we must in this Case exceed little children, must be out of the consciousness
of this our Impotencie or infirmity to frame our Petitions unto God with the
Prophet, Psalm. 51. 2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from
my sin; And again, ver. 10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a
right spirit within me: cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy
holy spirit from me.

Again, Little Children, though they be set upon their feet, after their Fall,
they are not able to stand upright, although they adventure not to go, unless
they be supported by their nurses, or other helper; and it is our Apostles
advice unto such as stand, to take heedlest they fall.

But is this circumspection in their power after Grace received?

No; no more then it is in the power of Little Children to keep themselves from
falling.

To what end then does this Admonition serve?

To make us more careful by the knowledge of this our infirmity continually to
use that or the like prayer, Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy
gracious favor, and further us with thy continual help.

If we truly acknowledge our selves to be but Little Children, we cannot but
know, that without his preventing Grace we must still wallow in our natural
filthiness and uncleanness, that without his Concomitant Grace we cannot stand,
and that without his Subsequent Grace we can make no progress toward eternal
Life: All our doings must be begun, must be continued, and ended in him by his
Grace; otherwise we shall fail of the end here proposed unto us by our Apostle.

Again, Little Children are sensible of hunger or want of Food, yet cannot
provide it, cannot be their own carvers of it, cannot take it, unless it be
reached unto them. We then become in some degree the children of God, when we
feel a want of spiritual Food, or when we hunger and thirst after
righteousness, But power we have none after Grace received to give satisfaction
to this hunger and thirst after good things: The best knowledge that in this
Case we have, is, To Beg Food Convenient at our heavenly Fathers hands in that
or the like Form of Prayer, Give us this day our daily bread. And thus to beg
it out of full assurance, that he is more ready to hear our requests, then any
earthly Father is to give his children bread, or any earthly Mother to give her
sucking Infants milk when they cry for it; For some Mothers are unnatural,
others may forget their children, but so will not God forget his, so they be
children in malice, not in the Knowledge of his Goodness.

Little Children again if they be exposed to cold, or heat, or any other
danger, that may accrue from hostile or ravenous creatures, have no power or
strength to defend themselves, all that they can do is but to cry for help from
others.

Now the spiritual and Ghostly enemies of every Child of God, and the dangers,
whereto they daily expose themselves, are more in number, then the bodily
dangers, whereof little Children are capable; Less able we are, though endowed
with some measure of Grace, to resist the Devil, who goes about like a roaring
Lion seeking whom he may devour, then a sucking child to withstand a Bear or
Wolf, that should come upon him. To what end then does God bestow his Grace
upon us, if with this we cannot defend our selves, as with a weapon? Only to
this end, that we should daily pray for his special protection, as his Son has
taught us: Lord lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,
specially from the Author of evil; for thine is the Kingdom, the power and the
glory. Thou only art able to subdue and conquer the Prince of this world, and
to destroy him, who has the power of death.

Lastly, albeit we must exceed Little Children in the acknowledgment of our
infirmities, and though our capacities to conceive these and the like forms of
prayer be greater then theirs, yet in respect of most particulars we are in
this too like Little Children, that we know not how to pray, or ask those
things, which for the present we stand most in need of. And in this point our
Knowledge must exceed theirs, that we must have a knowledge of this infirmity,
and out of the consciousness of it pray more fervently unto our heavenly
Father, that he would teach us how to pray, or hear the supplications of his
Spirit for us, whose language we perfectly understand not: and not to indent
with him for other particulars, but only to grant us what he knows to be best
for us, and most available, though not for our present occasions, yet for the
attainment of Everlasting life. Until we learn this lesson of Humility and
meekness, which The Son of God himself so often commends unto us by his own
example, by Precept, and Instances, we shall find no true Rest unto our souls;
we shall not have that Full Assurance of hope unto the end, whereof our Apostle
speaks, Heb. 6.

9. But is this Qualification of becoming like Little Children alone sufficient?

No: he that says, Whosoever receives not the Kingdom of heaven as a little
child shall not enter therein, has also said, Matthew. 5. 20. Except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

Does he Instance in them, as in the most wicked men, that were?

So his Instance should not have been so pertinent, at least his Admonition not
so peremptory.

The Scribes and Pharisees, if they had not thought so of themselves, were the
most righteous men then living; they were the only Precisians of those times,
and observed many Rules of righteousness more exactly, then most men now living
do any.

Wherein then did they come short of the promise?

By making Extraordinary Conscience of some necessary duties, and little or
none Why Christ instanceth in the Scribes and Pharisees.
at all of others.

The old Serpent deceived them, as he does many Christians to this day, by that
Fallacy or Sophism, which we call A Dicto secundum quid ad simpliciter, that
is, in using their known zealous observance of some good duties as an Argument,
that they were simply and absolutely more righteous then other men, specially
then those, whom they saw gross transgressors of some Commandments, which they
made conscience of. They did acknowledge, that they had received many Graces
from God, for which they thanked him; but yet they gloried, as if they had not
received them, and this polluted all their works.

A good man, says Solomon, is merciful unto his beast. This property of Good
men is in the Turks, for they are more compassionate toward their dogs, more
careful for begging them benevolence of strangers and passengers, for feeding
them in the open streets, then most Christians are for the relief of their poor
brethren; yet is that property of wicked men, which Solomon Turkish mercy
in the same place describes, more remarkable in them. Their mercies are cruel;
for out of this compassionate affection toward dumb creatures they will be
ready to kill a Christian man, if he chance to wrong or harm them. It is a good
thing then to be zealous of good works; but unless this zeal be uniform, that
is, unless it proportionably, if not equally, respect good works of every kind:
partial or deformed zeal will bring forth complete Hypocrisy.

10. But it is an easy matter to tell men, that their zeal must be uniform and
unpartial; the point wherein satisfaction will be desired is this: How this
uniformity of zeal in good works must be wrought and planted in men? This men
must learn from that fundamental Rule of our Savior. Whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you so do to them: for this the Law and the Prophets. All of
Us desire or wish, that, not this or that man only, but that every See the
discourses following upon that precept, Do as you would be done to.
man should deal justly, friendly, and kindly with us; should think or speak
well of us, whilst we do or intend well; should Judge charitably of us when
they know nothing to the contrary, and censure us charitably, if we chance to
do amiss. The Rule of practice then in brief is this; that we make payment by
the same measure, by which we borrow; that is do good, as occasions or
abilities serve, to every man as he is a man or our fellow creature; though in
more abundant measure unto such, as are our Christian brethren, and of the same
Church and Religion. To be charitable in word, indeed, in thought, toward all,
even toward such, as deserve punishment or censure.

Another branch of the same Rule is this; If any have really showed themselves
kind unto us, to do unto them as they have done; If any have dealt rigidly or
unkindly with us, not to do as they have done, but as we desired they should
have done unto us; for our desires to be well dealt withal are just, but so
were not their dealings with us: And why should we make other men's unjust
dealing with us, rather then our own just desires of being friendly dealt
withal, the Rule of our future actions, or dealings with the same men? For God
will judge us by the former Rule, the Tenor whereof is this, not to do as we
have been done unto, specially if we have been unjustly dealt withal, but to
do to every man, as we desire they should have done unto us. The same Rule may
be yet further extended thus; we must do to every man not only as we desire
that every man should do to us, but as we desire that God should do to us, or
for us: So when we pray that God would forgive us our trespasses, we must be
ready to forgive them, that have trespassed against us. If we desire that God
would relieve us in distress, comfort us in sorrow, or succor us in need, we
must be ready to relieve our neighbors in their distress, to succor and
comfort them (as we are able) in time of need; not thus (in some good measure)
qualified, we do not pray in faith, our prayers are not truly religious; For as
St. James tells us, Chap. 1. verse the last. Pure religion and undefiled before
God and the Father is this; to visit the fatherless and widows in their
affliction, and to keep himself unspotted of the world.

are not put in Execution! Yet this being the Final Sentence, that shall be

shall be put in Execution. If reason, grounded upon Scripture, be not
sufficient to enforce our belief, as well concerning the Execution of the
Sentence, as the Equity thereof, we have an Express Testimony of the Judge
himself for the certainty of this Execution, ver. 46. And these (to wit, the
Goats, which were placed on his left hand, that is, all workers of iniquity or
fruitless hearers of the word of life) shall go away into everlasting
punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.

curiosity of some wits) been made the matter of many controversies, especially
Controversies about the Sentence.
in latter times: Of which we shall deliver our Opinion, as it shall fall out,
in the prosecution of the Positive Truth, which we are bound to believe.

The Positive Truths, which I would commend unto the Readers meditation are
Three.

The First, That Life everlasting shall be awarded, Secundum opera, or that all
men shall receive their final doom according to their works. Three Positive
verities or Conclusions.


The second, which will necessarily follow upon this; That good Works are
necessary to salvation, or to the inheritance of this Kingdom here promised.

The third, That good works are necessary to our admission into this kingdom,
Non tanqnam Causa regnandi, sed quia Via ad regnum, not as meritorious Causes,
for which this kingdom is by right due to us, or to any, but as the necessary
Way or path, by which all such, as seek to enter into this Kingdom, must pass.

To begin with the First Point; That the Final reward or retribution shall be
Secundum opera, according to men's works.

2. About this Position, Controversy between us and the Romish Church there
needed to have been none; unless some in that Church had been more desirous to
open a gap to new contentions, then ready to bring the controversies already
set on foot, to a Tryable Issue, by reducing them to some Point of
Contradiction.

But some of good Note in that Church for learning and moderation, have left
this Animadversion upon These words of Saint Matthew, That this place alone
does sufficiently evince, that the Final Award or retribution shall be made
Secundum Opera, non Secundum Fidem, according to works, not according to Faith.
That God should render to every man, either in this life, or at the last day,
according unto his works, yea according to all his works, we never denied, For
Solomon had long since said as much, in his prayer to God. 2 Chronicles. 6. 30. Yea
all works, even the most secret works, those of the heart not excepted, shall
have their Proper Award, and every man shall reap according to that he has
sown; Whether he has sown unto the flesh, or unto the spirit. But that this
Final Retribution should be made, Secundum Opera, non Secundum Fidem, according
to works only, not according to Faith, we cannot grant, without contradiction
to the truth delivered by our Savior and Saint Paul. For Faith and Works, by
both their Doctrines, are so strictly linkt together, that if the Final
Retribution be made according to men's works, it must likewise be awarded
according to men's Faith. And unless the Advocates of the modern Romish Church,
had been diposed to follow those Hypocrites against whom Saint James disputes
in his second Chapter (in their notions or apprehensions of Faith) more then
Saint James, yea more then Saint Paul; Nay more then our Savior himself: they
could not be ignorant of that contradiction, which is implied in their
Assertion, See The Fathers cited by this Author in his fourth Book Chap. 11.
etc. about the inseparableness of Faith and works.
That the Final Retribution is made according to Works, not according to Faith.
Know ye, says our Apostle, Gal. 3. 7. that they which are of faith, the same
are the children of Abraham: so Abraham is called The father of the faithful;
And none can be his sons or children, but by propagation or participation of
his faith. Our Savior says unto the Jews, John 8. 39. If ye were Abraham's
children, ye would do the works of Abraham; And if they had done the works,
they should have had the Reward of Abraham. Yet, as the Apostle says, They
that be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

So then it is true, that God rewarded Abraham according to his Works, and yet
withal according to his Faith: yea he was therefore rewarded with blessing
according to his works, because his works were done in Faith, or because he was
faithful in his works.

But do these Romanists which say, that we shall be rewarded according to
Works, not according to Faith, as evidently contradict their pretended Patron
Saint James, as they do Saint Paul? They do, without Question; if we look into
his intent and scope in that very place, from which they seek to magnify Works
above Faith, as well in point of Justification, as in respect of salvation or
Final Retribution.

3. Was not Abraham our Father (says Saint James Chap. 2. 21.) justified by
works, when he offered Isaac his son upon the Altar? Yet the same Apostle does
not deny, but rather suppose, that Abraham offered up Isaac by Faith; for so he
adds ver. 23. that by this work, that Scripture was fulfilled, which says,
Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness. If this
Scripture were fulfilled by this work, then Abraham's Faith did work in this
work, or rather, did work this work; it was his working Faith or belief, which
was imputed unto him for righteousness; and it was impossible, that Abraham
should be rewarded according to this work, and not be rewarded as well
according to his Faith, as according to his Work. Indeed if Abraham had professed
only in General, That he did believe God and his word, but had started back
from this or the like Service, which God had enjoined him, he had not been
justified.

But why not justified? only because he had no works? nay, rather, because, not
having such works as God required at his hands, his Faith had not been sound
and perfect; and his Faith being not sound and perfect, had not been imputed
unto him for righteousness. Now the Scripture plainly affirms, and St. James
takes it as granted, that Abraham's belief, not his works, was imputed to him
for righteousness.

Albeit Saint James does say, that the Belief was perfected by the work, yet
all the perfection was the perfection of his Faith; the use and End of his work
or of his Trial was to perfect or strengthen his Faith; as we say exercise of
body does perfect or confirm health; but it will not therefore follow, that
Exercise of body is better then health, seeing all the perfection, that it
has, is at the service of health. So far was this work of Abraham, by which
Saint James says his faith was perfected, from being a distinct perfection
from the perfection of his faith, that Saint Paul includes the very Work in his
Faith, Heb. 11. 17. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac. The
reason why he ascribes this work unto his faith, is given ver. 19. He accounted
that God was able to raise him up from the dead, from whence also he received
him in a figure. It was a Great and difficult matter for Abraham to believe,
that he should become the Father of many nations, Romans 4. 18. Not to consider
his own being now about an 100. years old, neither yet the deadnes of Sarahs
womb. But it was a greater work after he had received Isaac (upon the thread of
whose life the blessing promised, Genesis 15. 5. of being the Father of many
nations did wholly depend) to offer him up in sacrifice: this was more then to
believe in hope, against hope; The ready way (for ought that humane wisdom, or
any experience, till that time manifested unto the world, could inform him) to
cut the very throat of all his hopes or future blessings. But how great soever
this work were, the strength, by which it was wrought, was merely the strength
of his Faith; so the Apostle says, Romans 4. 20. He staggered not at the promise
of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith giving glory to God, and being
fully persuaded, that what God had promised, he was also able to perform, and
therefore was it imputed to him for righteousness. So that if any man do not
the works of Abraham it is because he has not the faith of Abraham; Impossible
it were for any man that has the same measure of Faith, which Abraham had, not
to do the like works, which Abraham did. What measure of works truly good any
man does, so much, or so great a measure he has of true Faith; And so far as
any man is Rewarded according to his works, he is likewise rewarded according
to his Faith.

We may extend that Saying of our Savior (though spoken then, but to one man)
unto all and every man [According to their faith so shall it be done unto
them.] And our Savior in the Parable next before This Sentence, expressly
avoucheth; that the Final Award or retribution shall be according to Faith;
Matthew. 25. 23. Well done thou good and faithful servant, thou have been
faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord. No man shall be rewarded for any Works, unless they
were the Works of Faith, or done in Faith. To speak properly it is the Fidelity
of our Works, or our Fidelity in Working, which shall be rewarded. As for those
Hypocrites, against whom St, James disputes (and from whose Notion or Conceit
of Faith the Romish Schoolmen, for the most part, take their Description of
Faith) they had altogether as little of Abraham's Faith, as they had of Abraham's
Works; For if they had been partakers of Abraham's faith, then, as our Apostle
infers, Gal. 3. 7, They had been the sons of Abraham; and if they had been the
sons of Abraham, they would (by our Saviors Inference) have done the works of
Abraham. Such faith as they made brags of, could not justify them, because it
was a dead and fruitless faith, devoid of works. Such works, as the Romish
Church does magnify in opposition to faith, can neither justify, nor receive
any Reward, because they are no faithful Works; but rather like seeming fruits
without any Root. They put their works upon their faith, as we do sweet flowers
upon dead Corpses. Neither can give life or perfection to others. The best
Censure that Christian Faith or Charity will permit us to give of their
doctrine Concerning the nature of faith and works, is This; That albeit, they
all profess to believe that, which their Church believes, yet the most of them
do neither believe nor practice as the Church (in these points) teaches. Their
ignorance in this particular is much better then their knowledge of most of the
rest.

But to conclude the first Position; Because some of our Writers exclude all
works from the work of Justification, some Roman Writers (I dare not say all)
sought to be even with them by excluding faith from sharing with works in the
Final Award or retribution. For besides this Eagerness of extreme Opposition or
desire to be contrary unto us, it is not imaginable what could move any learned
Writer amongst them to Affirm that this final Retribution shall be according to
Works, and Deny it, According to Faith.

4. About the Second Position there is no Controversy betwixt us and the Good
works necessary to Salvation.
Romish Church; we hold Good works to be as necessary to salvation, as they do;
As necessary according to both Branches of Necessity. Necessary they are,
Necessitate praecepti, and necessary likewise Necessitate medii; necessary by
Precept or duty, for God has commanded us to do them, he has redeemed us to
the end that we should serve him in righteousness and holiness. But many
things, which are in this sense necessary, in that their Omission does
necessarily include a breach of Gods Commandment, and by consequent a sin, do
not always induce or argue a Forfeiture of our Estate in Grace, or utter
exclusion from the' Kingdom of heaven: For this Reason we say, That Good works
are necessary, not only Necessitate praecepti, by way of Command, but
Necessitate medii, as the way and means, so necessary to salvation, that
without the practice of them, no man can be admitted into the Kingdom of
Heaven. Through the Omission of Good works, many do forfeit that Interest,
which they Omission of Good Works forfeit our interest in the promises.
truly had in the promises of everlasting Life.

In the promise it self, all that are partakers of the Word and Sacrament, all
that acknowledge the Word revealed to be the way unto everlasting life, have A
true Interest. Of the pledge or earnest of the blessing promised, that is of
justifying or sanctifying Grace, none are partakers, but such as are fruitful
in Good works, according to the means or abilities, which God has bestowed
upon them.

Whether it be possible for such as are once estated in Grace to give over the
Practice of Good works, that here we leave to such as desire to exercise their
wits in the controversies about Falling from Grace: (and the rather because we
have spoke a word of that Point in the 26. Chapter of this Book.) Let them
determine of the Categorical Affirmative or Negative as they please: This
Conditional is most certain: [If it be possible for him, that has Grace or
Faith (in what measure soever) inherent, to give over the practice of Good
Works; he shall thereby forfeit his present estate in Gods promises and defeat
his hopes of inheriting the Kingdom of God.] Whosoever (says our Savior)
shall break one of these Commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be
called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whosoever shall do, and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. For I say unto
you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
Matthew. 5. 20. Yet did these Scribes and Pharisees many Good Works, and made
conscience of many Duties, which many Precise Ones in our days do not trouble
their Consciences withal. This notwithstanding, These Scribes and Pharisees did
exclude themselves from the Kingdom of Heaven (as here established on earth) by
leaving other Good Works (altogether, or for the most part) undone, which the
Law of God did no less require at their hands. Even the Good Works, which they
did, were not well done by them, because they were not done in Faith; they
never came so near unto the Kingdom of Heaven, as to acknowledge Christ for
their Lord; much less to be partakers of those Gifts and Graces of the Spirit,
which after his Ascension were bestowed on men.

Nor shall all they, which were partakers of those Gifts, and which did still
acknowledge him for their Lord, enter into the Kingdom, which is here prepared
for such as continue in well doing. So says our Savior, Not every one that
says unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom, but he that does, etc.
Many will then say, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then
will I profess unto them; I never knew you; Depart from me ye workers of
iniquity, Matthew. 7. 21, 22.

5. But, in this place, We see the Sentence is not awarded for Positive
Damnation awarded for Omissions.
Works of iniquity, but for Omission of the duties of charity; He says not,
Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his
Angels, Because ye have oppressed the poor and stranger; or, for that ye have
robbed the Fatherless and made a prey of the widow. These indeed are works of
iniquity, and deserve Exclusion from the Kingdom of Heaven.

But is it a Work of iniquity, not to work at all? As not to give meat unto the
hungry? Not to give drink unto the thirsty? Not to cloth the naked, or lodge
the harbourless? Yes; even these Omissions deserve Exclusion from the Kingdom
of Heaven: Either by their connection with sins of oppression, because it is
scarce possible that any which hear Christ's promises should be barren of good
Works, unless they were too fruitful in the works of impiety and oppression;
or rather because, as our Savior elsewhere infers, that, Not to save men's
lives, when means and opportunity is offered, is to kill; Not to feed the
hungry, is a bloody sin; Not to cloth the naked, is as the sin of Oppression.

The Doing of some Good Works cannot excuse men for the Omission of others
which be as necessary; To prophecy in Christ's name is a Gracious Work; to cast
out Devils is a Work of Greater Charity and comfort to the possessed, then to
visit the prisoners; and yet such as have done these and many other wonderful
Works shall not be admitted at the Last Day.

Besides the Goodness of the Works which we are bound to do, there must be an
Uniformitie in them; Otherwise they are not done in Faith. Now the same Faith
and belief, which inclines our hearts to works of one kind, will incline them
to the practice of every kind, which we know or believe to be required at our
hands by our Lord and Master. That even the best Works of mercy, or most
beneficial unto others, are not acceptable unto God; unless they be done out of
Faith and obedience to our Masters Will, is clear from our Apostles Verdict of
Enoch, Heb. 11. 5. Before his translation, says our Apostle, he had this
testimony, that he pleased God; For so it is said Genesis 5. 24. that he walked
with God; the way, by which he walked, was his Good Works and Conversation, but
The Guide of this way and his works was his Faith. So the Apostle infers,
without faith it is impossible to please God; for he that comes to God must
believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them, that diligently seek
him. ver. 6. As God is the Author of goodness, yea goodness it self; so we
cannot come unto him by any other way, then by doing good to others; yet that,
which must make even our best Works pleasing to him, must be our Belief in him,
and in his goodness, and that he is A bountiful Rewarder of all that do good;

The good Works even of the Heathen, and of such as knew neither him nor his
Providence; of such, as in stead of him worshipped false gods, were rewarded by
him; but with rewards and blessings only Temporal: He was their Rewarder; but
not himself their Reward. This was the Peculiar of Abraham his friend, and of
Abraham's children, that is, of all such, as do the works of Abraham out of the
Faith of Abraham, that is, out of a lively apprehension and true esteem of his
goodness; Unto all such he himself shall be merces magna nimis, or valde magna,
Their exceeding great Reward. Unto men thus qualified, and only unto them, it
shall be said; Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the world. This Kingdom shall be a Kingdom of
everlasting bliss; and yet the greatest blessedness of this Kingdom shall
consist in the fruition or enjoying of the presence of this Everlasting King,
who is goodness it self; the participation of whose goodness is the very Life
and Essence of that happiness, which all desire, but none shall attain, besides
such as do His Will by well doing. To be separated for ever from his presence
is the source of all the misery, which shall befall the damned or accursed.

But from this place of our Apostle, Heb. 11. 6. The Romanist (always The
Romanists wresting Hebr. 11. 6. to maintain merit of Works.
ready like the spider to suck poison from such flowers in this garden of God
as naturally afford honey to such as seek God) labors to infer, as he does out
of the words of the text, That the Everlasting Kingdom here promised is the
just Reward of our good works, and is as properly merited, as everlasting death
is by the Omission of the works here mentioned, or by the Positive Works of
inquitie. So that I should here according to my proposed method proceed unto
the third point, That these good works, how necessary soever they be, The third
Positive truth mentioned. 1. handled Chap. 31.
are necessary only Tanquam via ad regnum, non tanquam causa regnandi, only as
the Way and Means, which lead unto this Kingdom, not as the causes of its
preparation for us, or of our admission unto it. But for the present, I choose
rather to make some use or Application of what has been said concerning the
necessity of Good Works, then to dispute of their Efficacy or Causality for
attaining this Kingdom, intending to touch that a little more in the next
Chapter, though with reference to what I have spoken in the 27. and 28.
Chapters.

6. You see that Good Works done in faith (or, which is all one, a Working
Faith) are absolutely necessary unto salvation. But are they as necessary to
Justification? If they be; how is it said by St. Austine, and approved by the
Articles of the Church of England; Bona opera sequuntur hominem justificatum,
non praecedunt in homine justificando? Good works follow Justification; they do
not go before it. This Orthodoxal Truth only imports thus much, That no man can
do those works, which are capable of the promises before he be enabled by God
to do them; and that this ability to do them is from the Gift of Justifying
Faith. Now every one that has this Faith in his heart is said to be Justified,
that is, absolved from the Guilt of sins past, and freed from the Tyranny and
Dominion of sin, by receiving this pledge or earnest of Gods mercy: and in
this sense is Justification taken by St. James, when he says, a man is
justified by works, that is, He is not to be accounted the Son of faithful
Abraham, nor may he presume upon his own Actual Justification or estate in
Grace, until he be qualified and enabled to do the Works of Abraham. In the
same sense is Justification taken by St. John, Rev. 22. 11 Qui justus est
justificetur ad huc; Let him that is righteous be righteous still, or more
justified. And in this sort Children or Infants are said to be Justified by the
Infusion of Faith. The practice of Good Works is not required to their
Justification before they come to the knowledge of good and evil. But neither
is the apprehension or actual Belief of Gods mercies in Christ required of
them; Though they be justified and saved for the Merits of Christ and through
his blood, as we are. Yet is not the Rule for Application of these Merits, the
same in them and in men of years and discretion: (Though, with some abatement
or allowance, it holds in such as are converted to Christ upon their death
beds; These must apprehend Gods mercies in Christ, resolve to do Good Works;
and leave testimony of sorrow for their past negligence in doing Good Works:)
For in such as are endued with knowledge of Christ, and are enlightened to see
their miserable estate by nature, the self same Faith which apprehends Gods
mercies in Christ, cannot be idle, it will be working that which is Good and
acceptable in the sight of God. In vain it it shall be for them to sue for
mercy at Gods hands through the Merits of Christ, unless for love to Christ
(whose Merits for them and Goodness toward them, Faith apprehends) they be
ready to do the works, which he has commended unto them. For (as you heard
before) not every one that says unto him, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the will of his Father, which is in Heaven;
and his Fathers Will is, that we do those things, which he here commands.

But another special Branch of the same Will is, That when we have done all
this, we faithfully acknowledge our selves to be unprofitable servants. This
our Plea for mercy (as men altogether unworthy for our best Works sake to be
partaker of Gods Goodness or of everlasting bliss) is that justification,
which St. Paul so much insists upon in most of his Epistles: and unto This
Justification, that is, to our good success in making this Plea, Good works are
necessary and usually Precedent; or, as it is usually taught by Good writers;
Good works are necessary quoad presentiam, (to justification) non quoad
efficientiam: Their presence is necessary to Justification, their Efficacy or
efficiencie is not necessary; for as you have heard before, and shall
afterward (Chap. 31.) hear; meritorious efficiencie they have none.

7. But let us ever remember, as I often put the Reader in mind, when it is
said, We must renounce all our works in the Plea of Justification or suite of
Pardon for our sins; This must be understood Of those good Works, which we have
done, not of those, which we have left undone; For these are not ours. These,
the Hypocrites and unbeleevers will be ready to renonnce. He alone truly
renounceth his Works, that does Good Works, and yet when he has done them,
puts no trust or confidence in them, and seeks not to improve them so far as to
make them meritorious, but wholly relies upon Gods mercies in Christ, appealing
from the Law unto the Gospel. Nor is it every sort of Relyance upon Gods
mercies in Christ, but A faithful and steadfast relyance, that can avail; and no
man can faithfully rely upon Christ's merits, but he that is faithful in doing
his Fathers Will.

8. But is this Necessity of good Works to be equally extended to all sorts of
Good works? So says Saint James, Chap. 2. 10, 11. Whosoever shall keep the
whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all; for he that said,
do not commit adultery, said also, do not kill. Now if thou commit no
adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the Law. His
meaning is, That albeit we are diligent in many points of Gods service, yet if
we wittingly dispense with our souls in other parts of it, this is an Argument
that we Truly and faithfully observe no part. For, if we did observe See this
Authors Treatise of Justifying Faith or fourth Book. Chap. 15.
Any part of his Commandments, out of Faith or sincere obedience to Gods Will,
we would observe, as much as in us lies, every branch of his Will revealed.

For as true Faith will not admit (...) Respects of Persons (which was the
fault in the beginning of that Chapter taxed by St. James, and gave occasion to
the Maxim or principle in the words last cited) so does it exclude all (...)
Partiality to Gods Commandments or branches of His See this Authors Treatise
Of Justifying Faith or fourth Book. Chap. 15.
Will revealed; If we love and prize one, we must love and value all: We may
not love and respect One and neglect another. This is the true intent and
meaning of the Apostle, which some (to the wounding of their brethrens weak
consciences) have extended too far, who say expressly (or at least are so
defective in expressing themselves, as they occasion others to think) That if a
man either positively or more grievously transgress in breach of Gods Negative
Precepts, or often fail in performance of some Positive Duties commanded by
him, it is all one as if he had transgressed all Gods Commandments.

This is more then can be gathered from St. James in this place; or from A
Sinister exposition of Saint James. 2. 10.
any other part of Gods word, which only condemns Partiality to Gods
Commandments. Now a man may trespass oftener and more grievously against some
one, or more of Gods commandments (whether Negative or Affirmative) then he
does against others, and yet do all this, not out of any passionate affected
Partiality toward Gods Commandments, or for want of uniformitie in his Faith
or Affections toward Christ; but only out of the Inequality of his own
natural or acquired inclinations to some peculiar sins or vices in respect of
others. Some men, as well before Regeneration or knowledge of Christ, as after,
may be naturally, or out of custom, more prone to wantonness, then unto
covetousness. Others again by natural disposition or bad custom, may be more
prone to covetousness, to ambition, or unadvised anger, then unto wantonness.
Others again by bad education may be more prone to rash oaths or causless
swearing then to any the former vices. One sort, after their regeneration, or
after they come to make Conscience of their ways, may offend more often and
more grievously against the third Commandment, then against the sixth or
seventh. Another sort may offend more grievously against the sixth Commandment
[Thou shall not kill] then against the seventh [Thou shall not commit
adultery.] A third sort, such as are by natural disposition or custom given to
wantonness may offend more grievously against the seventh Commandment, then
against the sixth. A fourth sort, more pecularly prone to covetousness or
ambition may offend more grievously and more often against the last Commandment
[Thou shall not covet,] then against any of the former. And yet none of them
fall under that censure of Saint James; Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and
yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For they may all respectively
offend in some one part, or few points, not out of any Partiality to Gods Law
or Commandments, but out of the Inequality of their particular or peculiar
dispositions to observe them.

Their desires or endeavors to observe those duties, which they more neglect,
may perhaps be Greater, then their desires or endeavors to observe those,
wherein they are less defective. However this may fall out; Yet this Rule is
certain, that, Whosoever truly observes any or more of Gods Commandments out of
Faith and sincere obedience to his Will; as his love and zealous Observance of
those commandments, in whose practice
he finds less difficulty, increases, his proneness to transgress the other,
from whose observance he is by nature or custom more averse, will still
decrease: his Positive diligence or care to practice those duties, which are
not so contrary to his natural inclinations, will always in some proportion or
other raise or quicken his weak desires or inclinations to observe those
duties, which he has formerly more often and more grievously neglected or
opposed.

9. But some happily will here demand why our Savior in this place of St.
Matthew. 25. 34. etc. (seeing all Good works are necessary unto Salvation)
should instance only in works of one kind, that is, in works of Charity
toward others, and not in works of Piety and sanctity, as in fasting and Why
Christ instances in works of Charity rather then of Piety.
praying? It is an Excellent observation, (and so much the more to be esteemed
by us, in that it was) made by Jansenius, a learned Bishop, not of Reformed,
but of the Romish Church, that, However fasting, and other exercises of
mortification, be duties necessary in their time and place, yet God is better
pleased with us for relieving and comforting others in their affliction (be it
affliction of body or of soul) then for afflicting our own souls and bodies:
And as for fasting, One good Use of it is, To learn by our voluntary want of
food truly to pity and comfort others, which want it against their wills; we
then truly fast, or our fast is then truly religious, when we fast, not for
thrift or sparing, or for the health of body, but that what we spare from our
selves we may bestow (not sparingly but cheerfully) upon our needy brethren. So
the Prophet instructs us, Esai. 58. 5, 6, 7. Is it such a fast, that I have
chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a
bul-rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will thou call this a
fast, an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast, that I have chosen?
to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the
oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to
the hungry, and that thou bring the poor, that are cast out, to thy house? when
thou see the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy self from
thine own flesh. Again, Fasting is useful or expedient only at some certain
times and seasons: These duties here mentioned Mat. 25. 34. etc. are at all
times necessary, they are never out of season; they are (upon the respects
last mentioned) most seasonable when we Fast, and yet in some sort more
seasonable when we Feast. For feasting of our selves or of the Rich, being
unmindful of the poor and needy is to bring a curse upon our selves, and
upon our plenty: As we see it set forth in the parable of Lazarus and Dives.
See Pro. 22. 16. Luke 14. 13.

St. Austine observes, that, the duty of praying continually is not literally
meant of praying always with our lips, nor of multiplying set hours of
Devotion; but Omne opus bonum; Every good work is a Real Prayer, specially if
we consecrate our selves to it by prayer. The continuance of Good works begun
and undertaken by prayer, is a continuation of our prayers; So that by Praying
often, and doing Good to others continually, we may be said to observe or
fulfill that precept Pray continually.

10. As we cannot more truly imitate, or express our Savior's disposition in
more solid Characters, then by the practice of these duties (for he went about
doing good, healing all that were oppressed) so are there no Duties, which are
so easy for all to imitate him in, as these are: None can plead exemption for
want of means or opportunity to practice them: For though some be so needy
themselves, that they cannot clothe the naked or feed the hungry,
yet may they visit the sick, or resort to such as are in Prison. As every one
in some kind or other may be the object of his neighbors charity, so may every
one be either Instrument or Agent in the doing thereof. The rich may stand in
need of visitation, or of their Neighbors Prayers, either for continuance or
restoration of health; and they cannot want other, on whom to exercise their
charity: For, as our Savior says, Pauperes semper habebitis vobiscum, You
shall always have the poor amongst you: And who knows, whether the Lord in
mercy has not suffered the poor in these places to abound, that the rich, or
men of competent means, might have continual and daily occasion to practice
these Duties here continually enjoined. We of About Newcastle upon Tine where
these were preached.
this place cannot want soil to sow unto the Lord; For, as the former Parable
imports, we shall not want occasion to put out the Talent wherewith God has
blessed us, to advantage: So Solomon says, He that has pity on the poor,
lends to the Lord, and look what he lays out, it shall be paid him again,
Pro. 19. 17. What greater Encouragement can any man either give or require, to
the performance of this service, then that which Our Lord and Master has given
to all, which either truly love him, or esteem of his love? What can the
Eloquence of man add to this Invitation in this place? What better Assurance
could any man require, then the solemn promise of so powerful and gracious a
Lord? Or what greater Reward or Blessing could any man expect to have assured
unto him, then that which our Savior here assures us? Whatsoever we do to the
poor and distressed, he will interpret it as done to himself, and really so
reward it.

And with Reference to this Last Day of Final Retribution, did the Psalmist
say, Psalm. 41. Blessed is the man that provideth for the sick and needy, the
Lord shall deliver him in time of trouble: Sickness, Death, and Judgment, are
Critical days of Trouble.

But I know it will be Objected, that, The greatest part of the poor, which
dwell and sojourn amongst us, are not such Little Ones as our Savior here The
worse the poor be, the more we may be charitable unto them.
speaks of, that is, not his Brethren: Men or Children they be, which for the
most part draw near unto him with their lips, when they hope to receive an Alms
through his Name, but are far from him in their hearts; more ready at most
times, and upon no occasion, to abuse his Name with fearful Oaths, then to
call upon it in Prayer, in Reverence and Humility. Would God the matter
Objected were not too true! However, The truth of it does not so much excuse
the Contraction, as it does exact the Extension of your bowels of compassion
toward them.

11. Seeing for them also Christ shed his blood; their ignorance of Christ and
his goodness, should move us all to a deeper touch of Pity and Compassion
toward them, then sight of their bodily distress, of their want or calamity
can affect us with: And this deep touch of Pity or Compassion, would raise our
spirits to an higher point of service unto Christ, then any relief or supply of
their bodily wants can amount unto. You may (if you will for Christ's sake be
pleased to do it) distribute so unto their bodily necessities, as you may lay a
necessity upon their souls of coming to the ordinary All neglect of the poor is
sin: This spiritual neglect, is a sin exceeding sinful
knowledge of Christ, and of Gods mercies in him toward man. You may by
authority put the Precept of our Apostle in execution; Such as will not work,
let them not eat; or such as will not work the ordinary works of God, that will
not labor to be instructed in his fear and in his Laws, let them not be
partakers of your Bounty and Pity.

To constrain the poor, the halt, and lame, to enter into the Lords house were
a matter easy; if, as the Law of God and man requires, none were permitted to
remain amongst us, but such as were confined to some certain dwelling or abode,
where they might live under the inspection or cure, as well of Civil, as of
Ecclesiastic Discipline. And consider with your selves, I beseech you, how
either the Civil or Ecclesiastic Magistrate will be able to answer the great
King at the last day, through whose default (whether jointly or severally) many
children have been by Baptism received into Christ's Church, and yet permitted
after, to live such a roving and wandering life, that no Tie can be laid upon
them to give an account of their Faith or Christian conversation to any Church
or Ambassador of Christ. But as Bodies, while they are in motion, are in no
place, though they pass through many; so these wandering Meteors are of no
Church, though they be in every Church. If I should in private persuade You
Magistrates to seek some Redress of this Enormitie, and blemish to the
Government of this place, I doubt I should be put off with the Exception, to
which I could not easily reply; That you have better experience then I, or
others of my opinion or profession have; And out of that experience see greater
difficulties, then we can discern.

But now having express warrant from our Savior's words, and this Fair
opportunity of Time and Place, You must give me leave to reply unto you, as an
ingenuous and learned Scholar once did to a Christian Emperor, which pretended
greater difficulties in a good work, which he commended to his Princely care,
then you can do in this; Yet a work not all together so necessary nor so
acceptable unto God, as this work would be. In rebus pijs aggrediendis nefas
est considerare quantum tu potes, sed quantum Deo fidis qui omnia potest. Think
not, when you are about works of Piety, so much of your own Ability (or
weakness;) but examine how much you rely and trust in Almighty God, who is
able to do exceeding abundantly above what we conceive or think.

CHAP. XXXI.
MATTHEW. 25. 34. 41. Come ye Blessed of my Father --, FOR I was hungry, and ye
gave me meat: I was thirsty, --, Go ye Cursed --, FOR, I was an hungered and ye
gave me no meat, I was thirsty, --.
Jansenius his observation and disputation [About merit] examined; and
convinced of contradiction to it self and to the Truth. The definition of
Merit. The State of the Question concerning Merit. Increase of Grace no more
Meritable then the First Grace. A Promise made Ex mero motu, sine Ratione dati
et accepti, cannot found a Title to Merits. Such are All Gods promises, Issues
of Mere Grace, Mercy and Bounty. The Romanists of kin to the Pharisee: yet
indeed more to be blamed then He. The objection from the Causal Particle, FOR,
made and answered.

1. AGainst such as deny the merit of humane works, Thus much, says Jansenius
his Observation.
Jansenius (an ingenuous and learned Bishop though a Papist) is diligently to
be observed; That Christ in this place deputes this Kingdom to the righteous
FOR, their works sake; hereby giving us to understand, that Life Eternal is
bestowed upon them FOR their works, by which the righteous Merit Life Eternal,
even as the wicked by their evil works Merit everlasting punishment.

The only ground or reason of this Assertion is; For that our Saviors Form of
speech in both Sentences is the same, and Causal in both. As he says unto the
wicked, Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire; FOR, I was an hungered
and you gave me no meat, etc. ver. 41, 42. So he says unto the righteous, or
them on his Right Hand, v. 34. Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the Kingdom
prepared for you, FOR, I was an hungered, and you gave me meat, etc.

Yet least any man should except against him, as dissenting from the Doctrine
of Christ elsewhere delivered, and from the Apostolic and Catholic Church, By
which, Our salvation is ascribed to Gods Grace and mercy; he adds this salve to
the wound which he had made: Non tamen Sic merit is nostris putetur dari vita
aeterna, etc. Let no man think that life eternal is So bestowed upon our
merits, as All may not be given to the mercy of God, from which we have our
good works or merits. He grants withal, That the salvation of the Righteous
depends upon Gods Blessing and Predestination, upon which likewise their Good
works depend, Lest any should glory in himself; A sin forbidden, by Gods
Prophet, Jer. 9. ver. 23.

That All then is to be attributed to Gods mercy, that no man may glory in
himself, or in his works, is true, Our enemies, in this Point, being Judges; is
confessed A Catholic verity.
by our Adversaries, even in this place, from which they seek to establish
Merits. And This we may conclude is A Point of Catholic Doctrine taught by
Christ, Prophets and Apostles, steadfastly embraced by all Reformed Churches,
and expressly (in words) acknowledged by the Romish Church. With this Point of
Catholic Faith we mingle no Doctrine, no Opinion, which may but questionably
pollute or defile it; We avoid all occasions of incurring the least suspicion
of contradicting it; and for this cause We abandon the very name of Merit, as
now it is used (or rather abused) by the Romish Church: Although in some Ages
of the Church it were an indifferent and harmless Term, Mereri importing no
more (as was showed, Chapter 27.) then, to Get or Obtain.

But Merit in the language of the modern Romish Church [Est actio, cuijustum
The Definition of merit.
est, ut aliquid detur,] is, An action or work, to which (something or) any
thing is due, by Rule of Justice. Yet does the Romish Church not only Enjoin
the Use or Familiarity of this Name in this Sense or signification, but Require
the Assent of Faith unto the Reality Expressed by it.

2. The Points then, which lie upon that Church to prove (if she will acquit
her self from polluting the holy Catholic Faith) are Two.

The One; That this Doctrine of meriting heaven by works does not contradict
the former part of Catholic doctrine acknowledged by her, to wit, that All is
to be ascribed to the mercy of God: that no man ought to glory in himself, or
in his works.

The other; That this Doctrine of merit is taught by the Holy Ghost, as either
by Christ himself, by his Prophets, or Apostles; for so it must be taught, if
it be imposed as an Article of Faith, although we could not convince it to
contradict the Former, or any other Article of Faith.

First then, of the state of the Question, or Point of Difference betwixt us.

Secondly, Of the Refutation of their Opinions.

Thirdly, The answer to the Objection, which they frame out of the Causal
Particles in this Text, Math. 25. 34, 41.

3. That the Doctrine of Merits does not contradict the Catholic Doctrine,
which ascribes our salvation wholly to the mercy of God; Jansenius seeks to
justify by this One Reason: For that the Romish Church does acknowledge The
state of the Question,
those Good Works, (wherein she places Merits) to proceed from the Mercy of
God. But this speech of his [Habemus bona opera a miscricordia Dei: By or from
the mercies of God we have our Good Works:] is Indefinite; that is, It is
uncertain how far this man himself, or any of his profession, do acknowledge
Good Works to proceed from the Mercy of God. If he had said, that All our Good
Works are wholly from God, this had agreed well with both branches of his
Former Conclusion; As First, That All were to be given to the mercy of God;
And Secondly, That no man might glory in himself or in his works. But if his
Speech had been thus far extended, it would have left no room for merits;
whereas the Doctrine of Merits must have place in all the writings, that come
from the Roman Press, albeit perhaps the Writer himself had assigned them none.
But if either All our Good Works be not from God; or if All of them be from God
Quoad Originem, only as they are in the Root, but not as they are in their
Growth and perfection; Then there may perhaps some place be left for Merit. So
much of them, as proceeds from our selves and not from God, might be accounted
our own; but yet being ours, there is no necessity, that God should reward them
with everlasting life.

For the clearer understanding of our adversaries meaning, and the State of the
Question betwixt us and them, we may consider, First, the Root or Faculty;
Consider three things.
Secondly the Stem or Habit of meritorious works. Thirdly, the Fruit, or
works themselves, or the exercise or practice, of, or according to, their
Habit. The Root or Faculty whence works truly good do spring (as most of the
Romish Church now acknowledge) is Grace infused. And this Infusion of Grace (by
which men in their Divinity are first justified) they acknowledge to be wholly
from God. And in that they acknowledge the First Grace, or Root of Good Works
to be wholly from Gods mercy, they consequently deny that it can be merited.
It Is a Maxim in their modern Schools, as we showed before, that, Fundamentum
meriti non cadit sub merito, The Foundation of merits cannot be merited. And
this Foundation of merits is the First Grace, by which man is first justified:
But after this Grace be once infused, the Use of it depends upon man's
Free Will: He that uses this Talent well, or not amiss, shall have more given
him. This Overplus the Romish Church ascribes to the Merit of Works: And by the
habitual and constant use of Grace, and Free Will, Life Eternal it self (by
their Doctrine) may be properly merited. We acknowledge that whosoever does not
hide the Talent of Grace, but imploys it aright, shall certainly receive
increase of Grace from God, and be partaker of joy according to the measure of
his Works, though not For his Works sake, or for his right use of Grace.

4. We say the Increase of Grace is no more from any Works or Merits Increase
of Grace no more merited then the First Grace.
of Works, then the First Grace it self is. The inheritance of Eternal Life can
no more be purchased by the fullest measure of Grace, or greatest perfection of
Works (that in this life can be attained unto) then the First Grace can be
purchased by Works. That the First Grace is not given for our Works, is not
procured by them, the Romish Church now acknowledges.

This beginning of Grace or foundation of merits they confess that they
receive from the sole blessing or Predestination of God. And so say we, All
increase of Grace; the Preparation of this Kingdom for us, our Preparation to
be capable of it, our admission into it, are the Effects likewise of Gods
Predestination, and the Fruits of his mercy; Yet not so, as that his Mercy or
Predestination does impose any necessity upon the men, for whom this Kingdom is
prepared: We deny not a Freedom of will in this Preparation, but the Merit of
our Free Will. A Freedom of will we have to neglect or despise the ordinary
means, by which Grace is bestowed; A Freedom likewise to About Free Will. See
an elaborate Treatise, Book X. Chap. 24. etc.
hide or not employ those Talents, or blessings, which God has already
bestowed upon us. If we do evil, or employ these Talents amiss, the evil is
wholly our own, the miscarriage is wholly our own: If we do well, or employ
them aright, This is Gods Work, and not ours; or not so ours, as that we may
hence challenge any Reward as due unto us. No man can do well, unless he be
enabled first by God to do well; and the more he is enabled by Gods Gifts and
Graces bestowed upon him, the more he is bound to God. Nor can we ever in this
life be so thankful unto God for Gifts already received, as we ought to be. The
least increase of Grace after the First Grace given, exceeds the greatest
measure of our service or thankfulness; if we could impartially esteem or rate
them by their proper worth or weight. So that the more Grace we receive from
God, or the better our Works are, the more still we are indebted to him that
inables us to work: and as our debt to him increases, so our Title, to Merit
any thing at his hands (questionless) decreaseth.

To conclude then;

That which creates a new Title of bond or debt unto God from us, cannot
possibly be the Ground-title of merits (that is, Of any debts or dues from God
A Syllogism.
to us:)

But Grace (not the First Grace only, but all increase of Grace) does still
create or found a new Title of Debt from us to God;

Therefore, Neither the First Grace, nor any increase of Grace can be
Fundamentum meriti, any Foundation or Ground-title unto merits:

But rather, seeing Merits include a Debt or due from God to us, he that most
abounds in Grace, which is the Free Gift of God, will be most ready to
disclaim all Merits.

6. But if Works (it may be, some of the Romish Church will say) cannot deserve
Everlasting Life, in themselves, or as they are wrought by us; yet If there be
not Ratio Dati and Accepti A promise is no Ground of merit.
may they deserve it, in as much as God has promised Life eternal to all that
continue in well doing. But that Good Works should deserve Eternal Life, Only
upon supposal of Gods promise, some of the greatest Scholars (I will not say of
the best men amongst them) will not yield. But to take them at their Best; As
when they say, that Good works do merit as much as God has promised to Reward
them with; This is too bad. For to merit, in their language, is a great deal
more then to be Rewarded; it includes a Reward due unto the works wrought, not
merely given out of the mercy or bounty of him that promises.

The Rule is General; Whatsoever any man has Interest in by promise, it must
be expected, sued for, and accepted upon the same Terms, that it is promised;
unless between the promise made and the performance of it, we can oblige the
party promising by some real service that may be profitable unto him more then
was included in the Conditions to which the promise did tie us: To do more then
is Covenanted and promised, so it be behoof-ful for either party, especially,
if it be profitable to the Rewarding party, deserves a Reward in Equity, though
not in Law, at his hands to whom it is behoof-ful. If the party, which
promises us a good Turn, receive any thing from us in lieu or consideration of
what he promises, he is tied in Law to perform his promise; and is a debtor
till he perform it: The performance is not a mere courtesy or bounty, but an
Act of Commutative Justice. The Assuming of a shilling may bind a man to the
payment of many pounds. Wheresoever there is Quid pro quo, or Ratio dati et
accepti, something as well given as taken upon mutual promise, there is an Act
of Commutative Justice; And wheresoever there is not Ratio dati et accepti,
Somewhat given as well taken, there can be nothing due in Justice. From this
ground some great Schoolmen in the Romish Church deny Justice commutative, or
that branch of Justice, which is the Rule of all matters of bargain or sale, to
be properly in God, because there cannot be Ratio dati et accepti, any mutual
giving or taking between God and his creatures; For he gives us all that we
have or can have; we cannot possibly give him any thing which he has not. And
for this reason albeit he were purposed to bestow the greatest measure of Grace
upon us, that any creature is capable of, this could not include any Grace of
merit; for still the more place Grace has in our hearts; the less room there
is for Merit.

True it is; that our Lord and Savior did merit heaven at his Fathers hands
for us; but the ground or foundation of this His merit, was, not only the
fullness of Grace in him as man, but that he being in the Form of God, the Son
of God, equal to his Father, did humble himself and become man for us, and did
his Father service as man; he therefore did merit all graces for us, because he
was the Son of God, not by Adoption, or creation, but by Eternal Generation. To
be the Sons of God by Adoption, or to be made his sons by Grace, is a blessing
bestowed on us, for the which we become Debtors to God the Father and servants
to God the Son; so deeply indebted to both, that albeit we should do ten times
more then we do, we should still be unprofitable servants; we could not make
the least Recompense for that, which he has done for us.

The manner of the Apostles Interrogation, Romans 11. 35. Quis prior illidedit?
who has first given to him? includes an universal negation, No man has given
ought to God; No man can give any thing unto him. And if none can give any
thing unto him, none can receive any thing from him by way of merit or valuable
consideration, but of mere mercy and free Bounty.

7. If we would scan the Tenor of all Gods promises made unto us in Scripture,
with such accurateness as Lawyers do Tenures of Land; we should find; that he
only promises to be merciful and bountiful unto us; whether we limit his
promises to the First Grace, which we receive from him, or extend them to All
after-increase of Grace, or to the accomplishing of all blessings promised in
this life by our admission unto life eternal in the world to come. Now if Mercy
and Bounty be the Complete Object of all his promises, then may we not expect
performance or accomplishment of his promises as a Just recompense or merit for
any service, which we do him, but only as the Fruit or effect of his mercy or
loving kindness.

If a loving earthly father should allot his son a liberal Pension before he
could in modesty ask it, or in discretion expect it, and promise him withal,
that if he did employ this present years Pension well, he would allow him more
liberally for the next year following; in this case, how well soever his son
did either demean himself, or use his present Pension; yet seeing the whole
profit did redound unto himself, not unto his father; the more bountifully his
father deals with him in the years following, the more still he is bound unto
him. An ingenuous or gracious son would not challenge the second or third years
Pension as more due unto him by right or merit, then the First, albeit he had
his fathers promise for these two years, which he had not for the first: For
the fathers promise was only to be good and bountiful unto him, so he would be
dutifully thankful for his bounty. Now to expect or challenge that by way of
right and merit, which is promised merely out of favor or loving kindness, and
upon condition of dutiful demeanor, is a transgression of duty, an high degree
of unthankfulness, especially from a son unto the father. For every son by the
Law of God and nature owes obedience and respect unto his Father; and though
there be no mutual bond of Obedience, yet is there a bond of mutual duty
between an earthly father and his son; at least the father as well as the son
owes obedience unto Gods Law, and Gods Law enjoins every father unto kind
usuage of his son, so he challenge it not by way of debt or merit, but in love,
humility, or obedience.

But on our heavenly Father no bond of Obedience, of debt, or duty can be
laid; what good soever he does unto us, it is merely from his Free Mercy and
loving kindness. It was his mere goodness to Create us; to give our First
Parents such Being, as once they had. This First Being could not be merited,
nor does any Romanist affirm it could. Having lost that goodness, wherein we
were created, it was more then mere Goodness, the abundance of mercy, to make
us any promise of Restoration to our First blood and Dignity. And after this
promise made, it is but the continuation or increase of the same abundant mercy
to bestow the Grace of Adoption upon us; and no more it is then a continuance
or Overplus of this abundant mercy, to increase this Grace of Adoption in us,
yearly, daily, and hourly. Lastly to crown this continuance of his Grace and
mercy toward us with an Everlasting Kingdom, is but an abundant excess of the
same mercy and loving kindness, out of which he first promised the Grace of
Adoption, and daily increased it. Si merita nostra aliquid facerent, ad
damnationem nostram veniret. Non venit ille ad inspectionem meritorum, sed ad
remissionem peccatorum. Non fuisti, et factus es: Quid Deo dedisti? malus
fuisti, et liberatus es: Quid Deo dedisti? Quid non ab eo gratis accepisti?
merito et Gratia nominatur, quia gratis datur.

Briefly, in that Gods Mercy and Goodness is absolutely infinite, it can admit
of no External Motive or inducement, either for bestowing the First Grace upon
us, or for increasing it, or for the perpetuation of it: we may deserve or
merit the withdrawing of his mercies from us, or the decrease of his blessings;
but deserve or merit their increase we cannot; for merit supposes more then a
motive or inducement; it necessarily includes a Tie or Obligement; whereas no
obligement or inducement can be laid upon infinite goodness, whose continuation
and increase is likewise successively infinite (without all period or
restraint) unto all such, as do not merit or provoke the substraction or
diminution of it,

8. Difference in this point of merit between the doctrine of the modern Romish
Church, and the doctrine, or rather the conceit of the Pharisee, I, How the
Papists and Pharisee agree in this point: rather how they exceed him.
for my part, could never conceive any, save only secundum magis et minus, A
difference of defect and Excess. The nature and quality of their opinions and
conceits is the same. The excess of pride or self conceit of their own works
and of their worth, is on the Romanists part, not on the Pharisees. The
Pharisees mere wen of more strict life, then most either of the Romish or
Reformed Churches now living be. They abstained from many Enormities, in which
the Publicans with whom they lived, did wallow; They were zealous followers of
many Good works, which the Publicans did not so much as approve, much less
practice, least of all practice with zeal and constancy. But were they
therefore nearer to the Kingdom of heaven here promised? or were they more
justified by their works, then the Publicans were, which did not work? The
Parable of the Pharisee and Publican, Luke 18. does witness the contrary. I
tell you, says our Savior, verse 14. this man went down unto his house rather
justified then the other, to wit, the Pharisee. What was it then, that made the
Pharisee more incapable of justification, then the Publican? want of works! No!
As he alleges (and no man could disprove his allegation) He fasted twice in
the week, and gave Tithe of all, that ever he possessed. What then? Only The
opinion of merits, or overweening conceit of the worth of these his Positive
works, or of his abstinence from gross and mortal sins.

But it may be, he ascribed all this to His own Free Will, not to the favor
and grace of God? Not so! For if we compare him with the modern Papists in this
Point, we are bound in conscience to pronounce the same sentence of them, that
our Savior did of the Pharisee and the Publican. The Pharisee, that very
Pharisee, which our Savior said was less justified then the Publican, is more
justifiable then any modern Romanist, which believes the doctrine of merits, as
now it is taught; or despises our Church, as less holy then the Church of
Rome, for denying the merit of works. For even this Pharisee, albeit he thought
himself a great deal better then the Publican, yet did he not ascribe this to
himself, or to his Free Will; for so he makes his confession, ver. 11. God I
thank thee, that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
or even as this Publican. In saying thus, he did acknowledge not only his
Positive good works (as fasting and paying tithes) but his Abstinence from
evil, as from extortion etc. to be from God: For he thanks him that he was not
an extortioner; and his solemn Thanks include an acknowledgment, that it was
his gift whom he thanks, that he was no extortioner, no unjust or adulterous
person. That the Pharisee did conceive as the Romanist does, that the First
Grace, by which he began to be more observant of Gods Laws, then the
Publicans, or other men, were, was only from God; and that the increase of this
Grace, or his proficiencie in good life and works was from himself, or the
effect of his Free Will, this is more then can be laid unto his charge; For he
says not, God I thank thee that thou have converted or reclaimed me from so
sinful paths, as this Publican walks in: To have said thus much, and no more,
might have left a suspicion, that he did acknowledge the First Grace of his
conversion to be Gods mere Gift, not so the Second or Third Grace; or the
increase of Grace, or his proficiencie in good Life. But now he says [God I
thank thee that I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican;] This
includes an acknowledgment, that all the Perfection, whereof until this very
day he deemed himself possessed, was from God, was his Free Gift. So that it
would be very hard to fasten any part of the doctrine of merits, which is now
stiffely maintained by the Romish Church, upon this Pharisee.

Seeing then he boasts of nothing, which he does not acknowledge that he had
received from God, wherein does his pharisaical pride or conceit, or (as the
Evangelist styles it) his Trust in himself, consist? Only in that he Glories in
Gods Graces, as if he had not received them; in that he was not humbled by that
Grace, which by his own acknowledgement, he had received from God; therefore is
he less justified then the Publican. So then the true End and use of all our
works, of all the Graces, which God bestows upon us in this life, is to teach
us true humility, and to work out our salvation with fear and trembling; as men
that seek for the Kingdom of Heaven, not by Works, much less as due to our
works, but by acknowledgement of Gods Mere Mercy, and our own unworthiness.

Many, which in words disclaim the doctrine of Merits (as, for ought I know,
this Pharisee did) may secretly trust in themselves, or in their Merits; but
none which make the doctrine of Merits a point of Belief, as the Romanists do,
but must of necessity trust in themselves, and in their merits, as this
Pharisee did: Hence says St. Augustine; Vis excidere a gratia? jactes merita.
Would thou fall from Grace? Boast of thy merits.

9. All that they have to Object against us from this place, is from the Form
of our Saviors Speech, Inherit the Kingdom of God prepared for you, FOR, I The
Objection drawn from the Causal Particle For in the text framed; and answered.
was an hungered, etc.

The Form of it is Causal; and it necessarily imports some Cause; as either the
Cause of the Preparation of the Kingdom; or of the righteous their Admission
into it. Otherwise, the same form of speech, ver 41. FOR I was an hungered, and
you gave me no meat, should not import the true Cause, why the wicked are
sentenced to hell. But the Protestants (say they) generally grant, that this
Particle, (...), FOR, ver. 41. does import, that the true Cause, why the wicked
are condemned to hell, is, The Omission of these works: and hence they infer,
that the true Cause, why the righteous are admitted into heaven, is the
performance of those Works, which the wicked neglected; and that our Savior
did note out this Cause unto us in the manner of his speech; Inherit the
Kingdom prepared for you, FOR, I was hungry, and you gave me meat, I was naked,
and ye clothed me. Hence says Jansenius Jansenius his Argument.
The righteous do merit eternal life by their Good works, as the wicked do
everlasting punishment by their bad works. This is his Note upon the words; and
the only Ground or Reason of this Inference is, Because the Form of our
Saviors Speech is One and the same in both Sentences, as well in the Sentence
of Life, as in the Sentence of Death.

But though the Phrase or manner of speech be the same, will Jansenius
therefore stand to the Inference or Observation, which he makes upon them, The
Author his Answer.
viz. That the Good works of the righteous are altogether as true Causes of
inheriting the Kingdom of heaven, as the bad works of the wicked, or their
Omission of good works, are of their damnation to hell?

That this was his meaning, any honest plain dealing man that should read him
only upon those words of this Text, would easily be persuaded; howbeit, in the
Process or Sentence against the wicked, ver. 41. he expressly unsayes the most
part of that, which he here seems to say; being thereto enforced by the Real
circumstances of the Text. He ingeniously acknowledges, what Origin and
Chrysostom had observed before him, That our Savior says unto those on his
right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father: but unto those on his left hand,
though he say, Depart ye Cursed, yet he says not, Ye cursed of my Father.

This implies, as Jansenius acknowledges, That God the Father is the Author
and Donour of everlasting bliss; but every one that does wickedly, is the
Author of his own Woe, or cursed estate. God then, not our works, is the Cause
of our Bliss or Salvation: Men's evil works, not God, is the Cause of damnation.

Again, in the other Sentence of Condemnation, our Savior does not say, That
the everlasting punishment is prepared for unrighteous men, but for the Devil
and his Angels.

What does this in the Judgment of Jansenius imply?

First, That the condemnation of men is not so to be ascribed unto the
Ordinance of God, as men's salvation is: For God created no man to the end, that
he should perish; but men by their Free Will, or Wilfulness in sin, do make
themselves liable or obnoxious to those torments, which principally were
prepared for the Devil and his Angels. For this Reason, says the same
Jansenius, Christ does not say, that the Kingdom, unto which he calls the
righteous, was prepared for the Good Angels, as the fire is prepared for the
Devil and bad Angels, lest we should hence collect, that men might by Good
works deserve or merit the society of Good Angels after the same manner, that
they do merit the company or fellowship of evil Angels or Devils. For, as he
adds, The merits or Good Works of men do not depend only upon our Free will,
but they issue from the Grace and bounty of God: And our Savior (as this
Author concludes) in saying, That this Kingdom was prepared for the righteous
since, or from, the foundation of the world; and in saying, hell was not
prepared for wicked men but for the Devil and his Angels, does hereby give us
to understand, That the salvation of the righteous is to be ascribed unto the
mercy of God, and the condemnation of the unjust, not unto God, but unto their
own iniquity.

10. But does not this plainly contradict his Former Assertion upon the Text,
when he says [Justi suis operibus merentur vitam aeternam, sicut impijsuis
operibus aeternum merentur supplicium: That the righteous deserve eternal Life
by their works, as well, or after the same manner, that the wicked by their
works deserve hell?]

All that can be said for him, or for his Acquital from contradicting himself,
is; that he put no set Quantity to his First Proposition, but leaves it
Indefinite: a fault common to the Romanists, that they may have some excuse for
their palpable Contradictions. To say [That Good Works deserve Heaven, even as
bad Works deserve Hell] and to deny, [That the one deserves Heaven as well as
the other deserves Hell] seems to imply a Contradiction. Yet if any man should
press Janfenius too far upon these Terms, he has this Evasion; Non omnino
similiter merentur; The one does not merit Heaven altogether by the same
manner, that the other does merit Hell; because men's Good Works or Merits do
not depend only upon the Freedom of Will. But this favorable construction
being permitted or allowed him, yet to say, as he does, That the best works of
men (how much, or how little soever they depend upon man's Free Will) do in any
sort, either in whole or in part, merit the Kingdom of Heaven, this directly
contradicts his former Assertion, that Totum deputandum est misericordiae Dei,
That all is to be imputed to the Mercy of God: Quod totum est a Deo, non
potest vel in part ascribi meritis nostris; That, which is wholly from Gods
mercy, cannot so much as in part or at all be ascribed unto our merits. For
what is the Reason why the First Grace cannot (in their doctrine) be Merited?
is it not, because it is wholly from the mercy of God? now if this Kingdom of
heaven or man's salvation be wholly from the mercy of God, it can no more be
Merited by any increase of Grace or Good Works, then the First Grace it self
can be Merited. See the 27th Chapter of this Book, where this Argument is most
fully answered, and that with some variation of what is here.


11. But what shall we punctually answer to the Grammatical Inference drawn
from the form of our Saviors speech; Inherit the Kingdom etc. FOR I was an
hungered and you gave me, etc. The usual Answer is, that this Conjunction or
Illative, For, Because, and the like, do not always denote the Cause of the
thing it self, but sometimes only the Consequence of what is spoken. But seeing
the Form of this speech is, as Grammarians speak, Causal; to say that a
Conjunction Causal does not always import some Cause, were to deny Principles,
and affirm that the Grammar Rule were to be corrected. But admitting that this
Conjunction does always import some Cause; it will not hence follow, that it
always imports the Real Cause of the thing it self which is known, But
oftentimes the Cause only of our knowledge of it. Again, such Causal Particles
do not always import some Efficacious Causalitie, but only Causam sine qua
non, some necessary means, or condition, without which the prime and principal
Cause (especially if it work freely) does not produce its intended effect.

To give you Examples or instances of these Observations. If a stranger coming
into a City should say; surely yonder Gentleman is the chief Magistrate,
because the sword is born before him; No wise man would hence collect, that the
bearing of the sword before him is The Cause, why he is the chief Magistrate;
For, his lawful Election, is The Cause of that, and that is the Cause why the
sword is born before him. Yet may we not for this reason deny, that the former
speech does necessarily import a Cause; for, the bearing of the sword before
him is the true True Cause of his knowing him to be the chief magistrate. And
in as much as we oftentimes come to know the Cause by the Effect, this word,
For, or other Conjunction Causal does ofttimes point out the Effect, rather
then the Cause of the thing it self. So it does in the speech of our Savior,
Luke 7. 45. Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven,
for she loved much. However some Romanists, whose delight it is to set
Christian Charity and faith at odds; would hence collect, that Charity is the
Cause of the forgiveness of sins; yet their greatest Scholars acknowledge their
error or oversight, and ingenuously acknowledge (their understanding being
convinced by the evidence of truth) that This woman's Love was not the Cause,
why her sins were forgiven; but, that the Free forgiveness of her sins, which
were many, was the True Cause, why she loved so much: however her extraordinary
love being testified in such solemn sort, was a true Cause or reason, by which
all that saw her might know, both, that her sins had been many, and that she
had an internal feeling or apprehension of their forgiveness. And the true
reason, why the Pharisee did neither bear such love unto our Savior, nor
exhibit the like signs of respect unto him, was, because he did not feel
himself sick, much less did he feel or apprehend the cure of his sickness, as
the woman did. For if he had known either the measure of his own sins, or that
our Savior was the Physician of his soul, he would have given better
Testification of his love and respect unto him, then he did by a Complemental
Invitation of him.

12. To instance again; If of two parties equally suspected of Felony a man
admitted to hear their examination or trial should say; This is the thief, For,
Two competent witnesses have given evidence against him, no man would hence
infer, that the evidence, given in against him by two honest men, was the Cause
why he was a thief; and yet was it the true Cause, why he knew him to be the
thief.

Every Revelation or authentic Declaration of any truth before unknown is the
true Cause of our knowledge of it, but not of the Truth it self: for that is
the Cause why the Declaration or our knowledge of it is true. Now amongst such
as profess Christ, and call him Lord, it is unknown to us who be the true
heirs of this heavenly kingdom, who be not: but in the day of Final Judgment,
in which all shall be judged by their works, the sheep shall be known from the
goats; and the first certain knowledge, which we shall have of this difference,
shall be from The Declarative sentence of the Judge, who cannot err; and his
Declaration, as you see, shall be made according to their works: The ones
performance of the Good works, here mentioned, declared and testified by the
Judge, shall be the True Cause, by which men and Angels shall know them to be
heirs of the everlasting Kingdom; the others Omission of the like works,
testified likewise by the same Judge, shall be the true cause, by which we
shall know them to be altogether unworthy of Gods favor or mercy, most worthy
of everlasting death. We shall then truly know, that the one sort are crowned,
as Saint Cyprian says, according to Gods Grace, and that the other are
condemned according to Justice: That the ones omission of Good Works is the
true Cause of condemnation, and that the others performance of Good works is
not the Cause of their salvation, but the Declaration only, or a Testimony
that they are the Sons of God, and that they did Good works by the secret
Operation of the spirit of Grace in them. And thus much, if you observe it, is
employed in the Reply or Answer of them that be saved, to their Judge; Lord,
When saw we thee an hungered, etc? So far they shall be from conceiting their
works to be meritorious, or worthy of eternal bliss, that they shall be ready
to disclaim them, as not worthy of it; ready to blame their sluggish
backwardness or want of cheerfulness to have done much better, seeing what they
did unto their poor brethren (as now they perceive) shall be so graciously
accepted; that Christ in his Throne of Majesty will acknowledge that he takes
them as kindly, as if they had been done unto himself.

The Case is the same, as if a Gracious Prince of his own free motion and
goodness should proclaim a general Pardon to a multitude of Rebels, Thieves and
Traitors, so they would accept of it, and make their peace with their honest
neighbors, whom they have wronged. All of them in show accept the Pardon, but
some of them in the Interim secretly practice treason or disturb the public
peace. If at the general Assize, or at their Arraignment, the Judge upon
certain notice of their several demeanors, should say to the one sort, I
restore you to your former state and dignity, Because since the Proclamation of
your Pardon you have demeaned your selves as becomes Loyal Subjects and
thankful men: And to the other, you I condemn to death, Because you have abused
your Sovereigns Clemency: No man would ascribe the restoration of the one unto
their good demeanor, in the Interim betwixt the getting of their Pardon and
their Arraignment, but unto the Princes Clemency: Albeit the condemnation of
the other were wholly to be ascribed unto their misdemeanors, not unto any want
of Clemency in the Prince, toward them. The good demeanor of the one could
but be at the most, Causasine qua non, A necessary Condition, without which the
Princes Clemency in his Pardon expressed, could not profit them. And so we say
of Good Works; They are Causae sine quibus non, necessary Conditions or means,
without which no man shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven; but no Positive or
meritorious Causes of our inheritance in it.

To conclude; If any one should ask me, Why all men that profess they believe
in Christ shall not be saved, Albeit Christ died for All; albeit the Pardon
General be proclaimed to all? The best Cause or Reason I could render, would be
This; Because, All, that profess they believe in Christ, do not truly believe
in Him; For, if they did, They would be careful to maintain Good Works, and
glorify God by being Fruitful in them.

The End of the Fifth Section.
The sixth SECTION.
A Transition of the Publishers.
WE have by Gods Good Blessing, dispatched The main of this Book, the Five
first Sections; so many Commentaries or Expositions of such Points or Articles
of Christian Faith, as are most proper (by way of Dread and Terror) to awake
the Conscience and stir the Affections: To persuade men to reflect seriously
upon all their Actions or Omissions, Failings or Achievements; and to prepare
themselves for that Account which must shortly be Rendered To God the Judge of
All, who will respect no Persons nor endure Pretenses. If these have their
kindly perfect work, They will Produce, Judging our selves, to prevent the
Judgment of the Lord; Repentance, and Restitution of all things; Circumspect
walking for the Future, and passing the Remnant of our Pilgrimage here in Fear.

To enrich the volume, and to benefit the Reader, I have thought good to annex
this sixth Section, which is A Collection of such Sermons of this Authors, as I
conceive likely to prove most effectual to the ends above mentioned; and be
most proper not only for this Place in the Body of His works, but for these
Times also; which may perhaps be startled, to see their present sins so
flagrantly reproved many years ago by one who knew not any of their persons
that commit them.

Our great Author had in his Eighth Book and third Chapter sadly complained of
some, that made this Great Rule of Charity, Equity and Justice, [Do as you
would be done unto;] This Law of nature and Precept of our Lawgiver; A nose of
wax, A very Lesbian Leaden Rule.

He had more sadly complained in his Tenth Book, Chapter 23. That not only the
Practice of this Transcendent Rule was extinct amongst men, But that the very
Sense of it was (if not utterly lost among the Learned, Casuists or Expositors,
yet) most shamefully decocted, and Piteously shrunk up, for want of improving
and deducing it into several pipes and Branches of Good Life.

Lastly, in the 29 Chapter of this Book, amongst other useful things concerning
this Rule, He told us, That God would Judge the world by it.

So then, This next Discourse (I mean the three Sermons upon this Text) Comes
not in unseasonably! And I hope the next but One will follow this as sutably as
a silver Thread, can follow a needle of Gold. And I shall endeavor to pick,
choose, and so place the rest, that the Reader shall not deny their Consequencie
to the five precedent Sections treating, Of Christ's Power, to raise the Dead,
to judge the quick and dead, and finally to sentence Both, according to the
things done in the Body be they Good or Bad. At which day, God send this
present sinful Generation (and amongst them my Soul) A Good deliverance; and in
order thereto, a Timely unfeigned Repentance, especially of their applauded and
avowed transgressions. This for Jesus sake, who is our Ransom, would be our
Peace, and shall be our Judge.

Amen.

unto you, even so do ye unto them, For this is the Law and the Prophets. Prove.

The misery of man, of the wisest of men, in their Pilgrimage to be wanderers

Spirits of the Law and Prophets; Do as you would be done unto. The Cohaerence.
The Method. Christ advances This dictate of nature into an Evangelical Law;
Fortifies it, and gives us proper motives to practice it. Two grounds of
Equity in this Law. 1. Actual equality of all men by nature 2. Possible
equality of all men in Condition. Exceptions against the Rule. Answers to
those Exceptions. This Rule forbids not to wage or invoke Law, so it be done
with Charity. Whether nature alone bind us to do good to our enemies. God has
right to command us to love them. Plato 's Good Communion. The compendious way
to do our selves most Good, is to do as much good as we can to others. The

mistakes of man.
incident to all sorts of men, that, when they take a perfect Survey of all
their former courses, they find their wanderings and digressions far larger then
their direct proceedings. The more excellent the End is whereat we aim, the
greater (commonly) is our Error, the more our Bypath from the right way that
leads unto it: Because, The greatest Good is always hardest to come by. Thus,
such as hunt most eagerly after the knowledge of Best matters (seeing the Best
are worst to find) after natures Glass is almost run out, and most of their
spirits spent; whilst they look back upon their former labors, like weary
Passingers that have wandered up and down in unknown coasts without a Guide
desirous to see the way they missed, in a Map, when they come to their Journeys
end, begin to discern what Toil and pains they might have saved, had they been
acquainted with such good Rules and directions at the first as now they know.
Nor have we so great cause to be ashamed of our folly, as to bewail The common
misery of our nature, seeing the wisest among the sons of men either for Civil
knowledge or speculative learning, Solomon himself, had almost lost himself in
this Maze; never finding any other issue of his Tedious course but only this
[All is vanity and vexition of Spirit:] Until he had almost come to the End
of his days; Then, he found out That short compendious way of godly Life,
Eccles. 12. 13. Let us hear the End of all: Fear The short or sum of man's
Duty.
God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. In this is
contained all we seek.

2. Had Solomon in his younger days fixed his eyes upon this Rule which he has
left us, as the Mariner does his upon the Pole or other Celestial sign, he
might have arrived in half that Time at that Haven which He hardly reached in
his old Age, after continual danger of Shipwreck by his wandering to and Fro.

But how-so-ever This fear of God and our observation of his Commandments be
the Readiest, the safest, and the shortest Cut, that Solomon knew, unto that
True Happiness which all men seek, but most seek amiss: yet these Commandments
cannot be kept unless they be known; And known they cannot be without good
study and industry either in reading or hearing the word Life. The life of
man is short, And The Text of the Law wherein the precepts are contained is
long: The Commentaries of the Prophets and sacred Histories necessary for the
Exposition thereof are voluminous and large: The true sense or meaning of
either, in some points not easy to be found out, unless we be well instructed
how to seek it; so as what the Jesuit says absolutely, but, falsely of all
Scripture, is Comparatively true of This advice of Solomon's: It is a plain and
easy way, a light of man's life, after it be once well learned, but it is hard
to Learn without a good Guide to directs us. Wherefore behold a greater then
Solomon, Christ Jesus himself directs us, in One, and that a very short Line,
unto that Point whereunto the large discourses both of The Law and the Prophets
do as it were by the Circumference Lead us: Whatsoever ye would that men should
do unto you, even so do ye unto them; for this is the Law and the Prophets:
that is, The Sum of the Law and the Prophets is contained in this short Rule.

3. Because our Savior gives it, we may believe it; that this is the best
Epitome that ever was given of any so large a Work: Or rather, not an Epitome
of the Law and the Prophets, but the whole Substance or Essence of the Law and
the Prophets. Herein all their particular Admonitions are contained, as
Branches in their Root. Out of the practice of this Principle or Precept, all
the Righteousness which the Law and the Prophets do teach will sooner spring,
and flourish much better, then if we should turn over all the Learned Comments
that have been written upon them, without the practice of this Compendious Rule.

This Abridgement is a Document of His Art that could draw a Camel through the
eye of a Needle, that spoke as never man spoke.

Sure then if any place of Scripture, besides those which contain the very
Foundation of Christian Faith, as Christ's Incarnation, Passion, or
Resurrection, be more necessary to be learned then other, then is this most
necessary and most worthy the Practice: Seeing all Doctrines of good Life, of
honest and upright Conversation are derived hence, as particular Conclusions in
Arts and Sciences from their Causes and Principles.

4. For any Coherence of these words with any precedent or consequent, we need
not be sollicitous. It suffices to know, They are a principal part of our
Saviors Sermon upon the Mount; in which He delivered the true meaning of the
Fundamental Parts of the Law, purging the Text, from the corrupt Glosses of the
Scribes and Pharisees. Every Sentence therein is a Maxim of Life, and as it
were an entire complete Body of it self, not a limb or member of any other
particular Discourse. Every full Sentence of it, This Main Rule especially, may
be anatomized by it self, without unripping any other adjoining. For which
Reason, some Learned have thought, that St. Matthew was not curious to relate
every sentence in that Rank and Order as it came from our Saviors Mouth: but
set them down, as any one would do all the memorable good sentences he could
call to mind (of a good Discourse read or heard) placing that perhaps first
which was spoke last, or that last which was spoke in the midst.

Yet if (as in Description of Shires, men usually annex some parts of the
Bordering Countries) any desire to have the Particular words or Speeches The
Coherence
of our Savior, whereunto this Illative [Therefore] is to be referred; he must
look back unto the fifth Chapter of this Gospel, verse 42. Give to him that
asks of thee, and from him that would borrow turn thou not away. For so St.
Luke (who is more observant of our Saviors method in this Sermon then St.
Matthew) in the sixth Chapter of his Gospel, verse 30, 31. Couples these two
Sentences together, which St. Matthew had set so far asunder. And immediately
after the words of the Text he inferres by Arguments, that Duty of loving our
Enemies (which he had set down the precept for, before, verse the 27.) though
St. Matthew place both Duty and Arguments immediately after the Sentence before
cited, viz. [Give to him that asks, etc.] So that this Precept [Whatsoever ye
would that men should do unto you, etc.] as is most probable, came in, between
the matter of that 42, and 43, verse of that fifth Chapter.

And yet it might be repeated again in the latter end of that Sermon by our
Savior: At least, for some special Use or Reason placed there by St. Matthew:
because, being the Foundation or Principle whence all other Duties of Good Life
are derived, it seems the Evangelist would intimate thus much unto us, That of
all our Saviors Sermon, which contained the very Quintessence of the Law, this
was the sum; And for this Reason he adds that Testimony (concerning the
Excellency of this Rule) which St. Luke omits, namely, That in it is contained
the Law and the Prophets.

5. The Method which I purpose, by Gods Assistance, to observe, is This. The
Authors Method.


First, To set down the Truth and Equity of the Rule it self [Whatsoever ye
would that men, etc.] with the Grounds or Motives to the practice thereof.

Secondly, To show in what sense or how far the Observation of it is, The
Fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets Doctrine; with such Exceptions as may be
brought against it.

Thirdly, Of the means and method of putting this Rule in practice.

It was A Saying of the Father of Physiicans, Natura est Medica; let Physicians
do what they can, Nature must effect the Cure. The Physician may either
strengthen Nature when it is Feeble, or ease it from the oppression of Humors;
But Nature must work the Cure.

This is, in proportion, true, for matters of Morality or Good Life. Natura
est optima Magistra; All that the best Teachers can perform in natural or moral
Knowledge, is but to help or cherish those natural Notions or Seeds of Truth
and Goodness which are ingrafted in our Souls. Art does not infuse or pour in,
but rather ripen and draw out, that which lay hid before. And it is the skill
of every instructor to apply himself to every man's nature, and to begin with
such Truths as every one can easily assent unto, as soon as he hears them;
albeit without help of a Teacher he could not have found them out himself. And
yet the more easily we assent to any Truth, the less we perceive how we were
moved thereto: and the less we perceive it, the more ready we are to imagine
that we did more then half move our selves, or that we could have found out
that by our selves which we have learned of others. Whereas in truth there is
nothing more hard then to speak to the purpose, and yet so (in matters of
Morality and Good Life) as every man of ordinary capacity, shall think, upon
the hearing of it, that he could have invented or said the like.

-- Ut sibi quivis
Speret idem: sudet multum, frustraque laboret
Ausus idem --.
Hor. De Art. P.

This, as the Great Rhetorician says, is the surest token of a perfect Orator.

6. For this Reason, He that knew what was in man, better then man did what was
in himself; He that spoke as never man spoke, and taught as never man taught,
does ground his Doctrine of good Life and Manners upon such Evident Principles
as his very Adversaries could not deny, (whereunto any civil natural man would
assent, albeit he could not have found them out;) and illustrates it by such
plain and natural Similitudes, as every man of ordinary capacity might
conceive. As here in this place, This Rule it self [Whatsoever ye would, etc.]
is a Principle of nature; at least the Negative of it [Quod tibi fieri non vis
alteri ne feceris;] is so.

The Use or Consequence of the Rule (though) That to observe this should be the
fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets, none could have drawn, unless our
Savior had first told us so. And yet the Deduction or derivation of all moral
Precepts (as I hope will appear) is easy to find, since he has taught us to
seek it. Seeing then, He that spoke as never man spoke, and taught as never man
taught, does ground his Doctrine upon such Principles as were in us by nature;
I shall take leave to imitate Him (quantum, Deum mortalis possum) and to show
the Equity and Truth of this Precept; First, as it binds us by Nature: and
Secondly, as it binds us in Christianity. Or First, as far as the equity of
it may be gathered by natural Reason; Then Secondly, as it is set down in holy
Scripture.

7. That This is a Dictate of the Law of Nature, is evident from the confession
of the Heathen and mere natural men. Severus the Emperor, albeit no Christian,
yet as some report of him, did like best of the Christians for their good Life,
because they most practiced this Rule. And the Negative of it, [VVhat you would
not have others do unto you, do not you to them,] seemed such an excellent
Ground of Civil Justice and honest dealing, that he caused Severus
it to be written in the places of Civil Justice, or Courts of Judgment, as we
do the Sentences of the Law or Commandments in our Churches: which he would not
have done (or should have done to small purpose) unless he had known the Rule
had been written before in every man's heart, so men would look into them. And
such amongst us (I am persuaded) as know not whether this sentence be in the
Law of God or in the Gospel of Christ, or no; or such as little think whether
it be there or no, if they see one insult over another in distress, deal hardly
with a stranger, or laugh at another misery, or the like, will naturally use
this or the like Reason to dissuade him: If you were in their case you would
not be well pleased with this Usage; Do (in Gods name) as you would be done
unto. The force of which and other like Reasons is grounded upon this Rule or
Principle of Nature. Nor is there any man that has (as we say) any good nature
in him, albeit ignorant in most points of Religion, but will in his sober mood
be much moved with such Reproofs; and however he may seem little to be affected
with them whilst he is in the heat of passion, yet his own Conscience, after
his passion cease, will secretly condemn him for so doing.

8. The Grounds of Equity in this Rule are two (though the one be subordinate
to the other.)

First, The Actual aequality of Nature in all men: For though there be
difference or distinction of men by place, pre-eminence, or dignity; yet in
Two Grounds of this Rule, or Law of Nature
Nature all men are equal, all alike subject to corruption and Calamity.

Secondly, The possible equality of condition amongst all men. For seeing the
Best men are but men, what is one man's Case may be another, because his
Nature, much more his Estate or Condition is subject to change. No Prince was
ever so firmly established in his Throne, but might be pulled down thence to
lie with Beggars in the Dust. Ancient Times yielding more frequent examples of
the Circumrotation of this Sphaere or Wheel of mutabilitie, their observations
to this purpose were Rife. Quod cuiquam contigit, cuivis potest. Whatsoever
has befaln any man, good or bad, might befall any one of all.

Et subito est Irus, qui modo Croesus erat. One turn (as the Heathens would
have said) of Fortunes Wheel might raise up Beggars or Servants to the Throne,
and bring down Monarchs to the Dust.

From this Actual Equality of all men by Nature, and this Possible Equality
of all men in Condition, was it, that even among the Heathen he was thought
inhumane, no natural man but a Monster, that would not be affected with
another extraordinary misery.

The Former of these two (in natures not extremely depraved) does work a
Sympathy or Fellow feeling of others misery; and the Latter, that is,
Possibility of suffering the like, does work Fear of doing the evil intended,
or Penitencie after it be done. Likeness or Identity of nature causes Sympathy
or Fellow-feeling in bruit Beasts: if one pant for Grief, others of the same
kind will be affected with it. Ignorant and simple men do many things by
instinct of nature; whereof Philosophers only know the Reason. And even in such
as did not expressly know this Rule, Nature her self did oft-times work and show
by the Effects, that it was hidden in their hearts.

Thus Cyrus, when he had condemned Croesus his conquered Enemy to be burnt,
only calling to mind, what a Potent Prince he had sately been, and as Cyrus
unlikely to have come to that end as himself was before the victory gotten,
was afraid (as the Historian notes) least some like plague might have come upon
himself, and so pitying himself rather then the other, he recalled the Sentence.

From the same Reason did that noble Roman weep amain, when he saw Carthage the
Enemy City of Rome set on fire, though by the Senates Decree: as Scipio
if he could have wished that her flames might have been quenched with his and
other Romans Tears. The present Calamity of that late famous and mighty
City, put him in mind, That Rome her self, though then sitting as a Queen that
knew no sorrow, might one day be as bright with fire as for the present she was
with Glory. Yet was the difference betwixt Cyrus and Croesus's estate as great,
betwixt Rome and Carthage greater, then can ordinarily be found between man and
man. Cyrus was Conqueror, and had gotten the strength of a mighty Kingdom to
his former by his Enemies Fall. And Rome had never the like occasion to be
secure as she had by Carthages destruction, which standing would never suffer
her to be quiet, being the only City of all the world that was able to give Her
check.

Thus, could we but consider, That, whosoever we be, we be but men; whatsoever
our estate be, it is but Humane, subject to chance and obnoxious to change;
Nature would tell us, that whatsoever is evil whilst done unto us, is evil
also to be done to others: And seeing there is no evil which we can do to
others, but the like may be done unto us, we should be as unwilling to do any
evil at all to others, as we are to have any done to us. For Nature it self
does (as it were of course) suggest a fear of being done to, as men have done
to others. Hence springs that Negative precept. Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri
ne feceris.

Again, whatsoever is good whilst it is done to us, the same is Good whilst
done to others in like case; nay, as good to them as unto us. And seeing All
Good is to be desired, we should be as desirous to do good to others as to have
good done to our selves. Yea, seeing, according to the mind of Christ, Beatius
est Dare quam accipere, Acts 20. 36. to do good is better then to have good
done to us, (as every action is better then Passion) we should therefore be
more desirous of that. And hence rises the Affirmative Precept, Do as you
would be done to.

Even the Heathen knew, that, it was better to give then to take.

Quas dederis solas semper habebis opes: It was more to have a Conscience
fraught with the memory of Good Turns done, or benefits bestowed on others,
then to have store of possessions or goods, and yet therewith to do little or
no good.

9. Yet are not these Two Rules so plain and evident unto natural Reason; but
natural passion and self-love will find exceptions against Exceptions against
these two Rules.
them.

There is no man will deny that these Rules were very Good in the old World or
Golden Age: or that they be Good now if all men would be content to observe
them alike. But he shall be sure to live by the loss that resolves to do
better to any others, then it is likely any will do to him. Nay, many in their
heat of discontent at others bad usage of them, will not stick quite to invert
this Rule, and think that it is just and right, at least no wrong, to use
others as they have been used themselves. (Thus I have known some use more
severity toward their inferiors, then did well agree with their natural
disposition, only, because they had been severely used by others whilst they
were inferiors.) And this they think not amiss, so they do it with no ill
mind, but only because they would not be the only men that should be noted and
marked as fit to suffer abuse and wrongs whilst their equals go Scot-free. Thus
sundry shut up from others by reason of infection have sought to infect others,
only because they would have companions in their miseries, albeit it was not
Man, but God that brought that Bodily Evil upon them. And thus many rude and
barbarous Beggars (being denied harbor or relief of such as might afford it
them) through a conceit of their own forlorn estate, will seek to make others
as poor, or more miserable then themselves, only that they may have some to be
their equals or inferiors.

The like suggestions of evil and wrong in some degree or other, will every
man's Passions present unto his thoughts: yet who so is but naturally wise,
either will not hear them, or (if this be too hard to put them off, because
passion is so familiar and intimate with the soul) will not give sentence
until he have heard Reason speak, which would oppose him Thus.

10. When thou wast hardly and despightfully used by others (suppose The Answer
to the former Exceptions
abused in person, disgraced in speech, or indamaged in Goods, etc.) did they
well or ill that so did use thee? If well, why wast thou moved therewith? Why
do thou complain? Or rather why would thou not be so well used again? If
evil they did, why seek thou then to imitate them in the evil which thou
hate? for if it were evil in them whilst it was done to thee, then will it be
evil in thee whilst thou do the like to others: Yea, perhaps much worse in
thee, because, thou having suffered the like wrong before, thou better knows
what an heinous Fact it is to do the like. For none knows, none possibly can
know, so well what a grievous sin oppression is, as he that has been violently
oppressed by others. None can so distinctly perceive what an odious offense
slander, defamation or scurrilitie is, as he that has been scourged by
scurrilous Tongues, or wronged in his good Name by false accusers, sly
informers, or envious whisperers. Generally, the nature and quality of all
evil that happens to one man from another, is much better known by suffering
then by doing it. For he that does it first, perhaps scarce knows well what he
does; he sees the nature of it but (as it were) afar off; But he that suffers
it feels it, at hand, and knows it by experience.

Now the greater we know any evil to be, and the more feeling touch we have of
the nature and quality of it, the more grievous is our sin if we practice the
like. Wherefore he that has been most hardly dealt withal, sins most, if he
deal so with others; for he does that to others which he is most unwilling
should be done unto himself: because he best knows the smart of the
evil, and according to his unwillingness of having the like done to himself
will the smart of the sting of Conscience be for doing so to others.

Some perhaps, or some man's Passions would here Reply; These reasons hold true,
if we should so use them that never did us wrong, as others have wrongfully
used us; but if the party that used us ill come in our way, we do him but
right, if we use him just so as he has used us: For Justice it self consists
in Equality; (...), and if we pay him but in the same measure that he did mete
to us, he is justly dealt withal.

Its true indeed! he is but justly dealt withal; because he is but done to as
he had done to others. So a thief or murderer is but justly dealt withal if he
be hanged: yet if every man that has his goods stolen should do this which is
but right unto a Thief; or if every man that has his friend or brother slain
should but do that which is due and should be done unto a murderer, not
expecting the Judges sentence, both might do themselves great wrong in doing
that which was but right and due to the offenders respectively. And so shall
every one wrong his own soul and conscience, that will prevent him in his
judgments to whom vengeance belongs (by taking Revenge into his own hands)
and not expect his good leisure, by lawful and public means.

The Law of nature is, Do As thou would be done to: not As thou have been
done to, against thy will. For what-soever was evil in another whilst done to
thee, is evil in thee whilst thou do the same to him. Thy fact is as his
fact: and thy sin as his sin; The evil is one and the same. Only thou may
allege, that he was more prone to do the same evil, because he did it without
Provocation, and thou do it provoked: that is as much as to say, he has
overcome thee in evil, but thou also art overcome of evil, the evil has
overcome that which is good in Thee, Thy passion overbears thy Reason and
Judgment: which is such an offense against the Law of nature, as it would be
against the Law of this Land, if a Tumultuous multitude should take the Laws
(as we say) into their own hand and execute malefactors without the Judges or
Magistrates consent.

11. What then (will some say) shall I pocket up every wrong? shall I make
myself a But or mark for all to shoot at? shall I prostitute my person to
abuse, my good name to slander, my goods to spoil without redress? God forbid!
For vengeance is Gods and he will repay; and he has Powers on earth which More
exceptions against that Rule and Answers to them.
bear not the sword in vain. If it be an open injury, by whose example if it
should go unpunished, others might be imboldened to do the like, and if the
present offendant might thereby grow insolent or retchless, likely to do the
like again to others as well as to thee, Thou do no way Transgress, rather
Two ways observe This Rule of natures Law, if thou solicit his chastisement at
the Lawful Magistrates hand. First, Thou shall teach the offender the practice
of this Rule, which, before, he knew not or neglected, though bound thereto as
well as Thou. For, when the Magistrate shall inflict upon him such punishment
as shall be more grievous to him then the wrong that he did was to thee, he
will be as careful to avoid the doing as thou art to avoid the suffering of the
same or like injury. This is The Rule of Public punishments, That they should
always be such as the party offending would be as unwilling to suffer, as the
party offended is to endure the wrong. Secondly, seeing all men naturally
desire security from danger, loss, or disquietness, and for this End wish
that all private Disturbers of Public Peace might either be amended or cut
off; Thou shall do to others (whom thou have more reason to respect then the
party offending) as thou would desire they should do for thee in the like

thou would that they should do to thee in the like Case.

Thou can not but consider that other men's cases may be thine own, and
could be willing, that if they had the like occasion of complaint, and could
make legal proof of wrong done, they should prosecute their cause for thine and
others security from the like. For these Ends and purposes to prosecute any
injury done by any private person before a Public Magistrate, or wrongs done
by an inferior Magistrate before his lawful Superior, is but just and right, a
Duty whereunto we are bound by the law of nature, if the party offending be
insolent and stub born, likely to hold on his wonted course, unless restrained
by the Magistrate. But if the offense be private betwixt thee and thy
neighbor, not likely to redound to any further public Harm; if it was an
offense of infirmity, or proceeded from some natural unruly passion, for which
he is afterward heartily sorry; then thou art bound in conscience to remit it.
For if thou considerest thine own infirmities, thou can not but find thy self
obnoxious to like passions, and that thou may at one Time or other be as far
overseen, and yet could wish in thine heart that such thine escapes or
oversights should not be prosecuted to the uttermost, but rather be pardoned
upon submission or penitencie. And experience does Rigid censuring a Pronostick
of falling.
teach us, that such as are too rigid or austere censurers of other men's
infirmities, do oft-times fall into the like or worse themselves; even into
such as they are otherwise least inclined unto (but, in that they are men, the
sons of sinful Adam, they are in some degree or other inclined unto any evil;)
And therefore whilst they prosecute such as upon infirmity or Passion fall
into some Enormous crime, as if they were not men but monsters or Noxious
creatures of another kind, their judgment is just, if they themselves fall
into the like, that they may know themselves to be but men, not altogether free
from passion and infirmities. Vide interpretes in 7. cap. St. Matthaei. v. 1.
See Plinies epist. lib. 9. epist. 12.

12. Thus far natural Reason may lead us in our sober thoughts, That we should
not do any harm to others because we would not have any other do harm to us; or
that we should forbear to prosecute the infirmities of others, because we would
have others bear with our own. But yet if we consult nature alone, it Q. If
nature alone bind men to do good to their enemies.
may seem doubtful, whether a man be bound by her Laws to do good unto his
enemy; as to relieve him in distress, to defend him in danger or the like:
This Rule of nature may seem not to bind men hereunto. For many men oft-times
would choose to suffer great loss rather then to be beholden to their enemy:
sometimes rather to starve for hunger, then to be upbraided with his
Benevolence: or to incur evident danger of Death, rather, then it should be
said, That his deadly enemy had preserved his life. He that is thus minded
(the salvage and Giant-like spirit would say Bravely minded) may in the
Jollitie of his resolution think himself no way bound to do his enemy any
good, of whom he looks for none; nay, of whom he would receive none, though it
should be thrust upon him. Yet natural Reason and conscience (so this man would
hear them speak and abide their censure) would condemn him, if he refused to do
good unto his enemy. The Rule is mis-applyed by Passion: for nature and Reason
bid us, That we should do that to every man which we would have any man do for
us; not to do that to this or that man which we expect from them alone. Now,
there is no man so wilful, unless he be witless also, but would be relieved
in distress, delivered from danger, and warranted from loss, albeit not by
this or that man whom he disliketh, yet by some one or other whom he likes
better. Wherefore, seeing Reason teaches us, That to do good to others, as
they are men, is good it in self, it teaches us (so we would learn of it) to
good unto whomsoever. For why should enmity (or our enemy) hinder us from
doing that which our consciences approve for good. If thy enemy be of that
strange temper above described, and one that would scorn to be beholden to
thee; steal thy good in upon him, and do him good so as that he shall not know
from whom it came. Thou art bound to minister comfort to him, as a
compassionate and cunning Physician does Physic to a melancholic or
distempered patient. But thou will say, so I shall lose all my thanks for all
my pains and cost. I answer by asking Thee, is the honor (or thanks) that
comes from God alone, of no value? The Heathen could say to his friend We are
each to other Theatrum satis amplum a Theater sufficiently large for matter of
content and contemplation. By doing So thou shall be sure to gain The
Testimony of a good Conscience. And herein thou may justly triumph over
thine enemy, in that thou art better aminded toward him, then thou could
expect that he would be toward thee. These are the best terms of comparison
that thou can stand upon with thine enemy, if thou can truly, say, That
thou art A better man then he: and if, the mind be the man then he is truly and
properly said to be The better man, that is better aminded toward all men, in
as much as they are men. This is the perfection and goodness of men as they are
Civil and natural men: and this is that Law of nature, which St. Paul says,
Romans 2. 14. 15. was written in the Gentiles hearts. For when the Gentiles which
have not the law, that is, not the written Law of God, do by nature the things
of the law (or contained in the Law) these having not the Law are a law unto
themselves: which show the effects of the Law written in their hearts, their
consciences always bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing one another or
else excusing.

13. But however the Heathen had this Fundamental Law of nature, This Root of
Righteousness (as without offense I hope I may term it, because it was a
Relic of Gods image in them) with many branches of it, ingrafted in their
hearts; yet, as their consciences might acquit them for performing many
particular duties which it enjoined, so might they accuse them for negligence
in more.

For neither did they practice so much as they knew to be good, nor did they
know all that to be good which This Rule might have taught them to be such. And
albeit, the better sort of them will rise up in Judgment against us, and may
condemn even the best sort of Christians (as the world counts them) now living;
Yet most of them we may suppose (especially in later times) were as negligent
hearers of natures Lore, as we are of the Doctrine of Grace. God, as the
Apostle says, Romans 1. had given some of them over to a Reprobate sense, That
seeing they would not practice what they knew for good, they should not know
Good from Bad. And as the learned observe, when mankind had like Retchless
unthrifts corrupted their ways, and like ungrateful Tenants to their
Landlord, Or undutiful subjects to their Prince, had cancelled the Original
instruments of their inheritance, Or copy of that Law by which they were to be
tried, daily defacing and blotting it by their foul transgressions and stain of
sins: it pleased The Lord in mercy, to renew it once again in visible and
material Characters engraven in stone, adding to it the commentaries of
Prophets and other Holy men, that so his people might once again copy out that
Covenant whose Original they had lost: (the written law being but as the
sampler or drawn work which was to have been wrought out by the law of nature;)
and imprint it again in their hearts by meditation and practice. Yet once again
the people of the Jews (unto whom this written Law was committed) did by their
false interpretations and Hypocritical glosses corrupt the true sense and
meaning of Gods Law, as the nations before had defaced the Law of nature by
their foolish imaginations and conceited self-love. Nevertheless, as sin did
abound in man, so did Gods grace and favor superabound. For, when hoth the Law
of nature was almost wholly lost among the Gentiles (drowned in Gentilisme, as
the Latin tongue is in the Italian) and the Jews (who should have allured
others by their good example and continual prosperitic (had they continued
faithful in observing it) to observe the written Law of God,) had quite
corrupted it: God sent his Only Son in the nature of man and Form of a Servant,
by infusion of Grace into men's hearts, to revive the dead Root of Natures Law,
when it was almost perished; and also to purify and cleanse Gods written Law,
from the false interpretations of the Scribes and Pharisees, which he performs
in this seventh Chapter and in the two precedent. So our Savior says, Chap.
5. v. 17. Think not that I am come to destroy (or dissolve) the Law or the
Prophets; I am not come to destroy them, but to fulfill them.

But how did Christ come to fulfill the Law? Only by his own Righteousness How
Christ fulfilled the Law.
and example?

No, not so only; but by proposing unto us the true sense and meaning of the
moral Law: which, all that were to be his followers, were to fulfill in a more
spiritual and better manner then either the best of the Heathens, or the most
strict Sect of the Jews of that time, did. For they had abrogated the force and
sense of sundry Commandments, and stood more upon the letter then the meaning
of the Law. Wherefore he adds, verse 20. I say unto you, except your
righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. It is evident then, from our
Saviors words, that both the righteousness commanded in the moral Law, and in
the Prophets, must be fulfilled in better measure by Christians then it was
either by the Scribes or the Pharisees; and that the best and most easy way of
fulfilling both the Law and the Prophets is the practicing of this Rule,
Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye so unto them, For this
is the Law and the Prophets.

14. Let us see then what we have more from His Doctrine then from Nature for
the Right Practice of this Royallest Rule. By Christ's Doctrine we have both the
Grounds of the former Precept (which Nature afforded us) better fortified and
confirmed unto us; And also have Motives or inducements, which may sway Reason
against Passion to the practice of the same Rule, more certain and infinitely
greater then the Heathen or mere natural man had any. (I must request you to
call to mind what was said before; See. 8.
That the Ground of this Precept, was, The Equality of all men by nature.) The
Heathen knew this full well, That all men were of one kind, all mortal, all
capable of Reason, and consequently of right and wrong. And from this
knowledge, even such among them as held no Creation, no dependence of man upon
the Divine Power, did often show commendable effects of this Law written in
their hearts in sundry duties of Good neighborhood (as we speak) and civil
kindnesses: As for any Affinity or Bonds of society between man and man, at
least between men of diverse Countries, more then is between beasts of the same
kind, most of them acknowledged none; nor did they acknowledge as much affinity
betwixt Creatures of any kind as we do that acknowledge all things to have one
Creator. Herein then is Our Equality and Affinity greater, that we all
acknowledge one God for our Father, who is in a more peculiar sort the Creator
of every man, then of any other corruptible Creature.

Again, All we Christians acknowledge One Christ for our Head, of whose Body we
are Members; hence arises another Peculiar Equality, from the equal price of
our Redemption which was all one for the Rich and Poor, for the Little and
Mighty Ones of the Earth. This God pre-figured in the Law, Exodus 30. verse 11,
12, 15. Afterward the Lord spoke unto Moses: When thou take the sum of the
Children of Israel after their number, then they shall give every man a
Redemption of his life unto the Lord, when thou tellest them, that there be no
plague among them when thou countest them. The Rich shall not pass, and the
poor shall not diminish from half a shekel, when ye shall give an Offering unto
the Lord for the Redemption of your Lives.

From this strict Dependencie of all men upon one and the same Creator, and
this Equality and Brotherhood which we have in one Father, does our Savior
Christ, Luke 6 v. 36. draw that precept Of loving our Enemies: which he makes
as it were an Essential property of all such as truly acknowledge One God. Not
that all men were not bound thereto, and might have known so much by nature,
but that it was a greater shame and more praeposterous sin, in such as did
acknowledge One God, not to perform that Duty. The Consciences of the Gentiles,
as St. Paul says, might secretly accuse them: But the Others words and
speeches did bear open Testimony against them, if they neglected so to do; so
says our Savior Christ immediately upon the words of the Text, -- For if you
love them which love you, what thank shall you have? for even the sinners love
those that love them. -- And if you do good for them which do good for you,
what thank shall ye have? for even the sinners do the same. And if you lend to
them of whom you hope to receive, what thank shall ye have? for even the
sinners lend to sinners, to receive the like. Wherefore love ye your enemies,
and do good, and lend looking for nothing again, and your reward shall be
great, and ye shall be the children of the most High: for he is kind to the
unkind and to the evil.

15. This further confirms what out of the principles of Nature was formerly
gathered, to wit, that where it is said, Whatsoever you would that men should
do unto you, do ye so unto them: The meaning is not, What ye would have this or
that man do unto you, do ye so unto the same man; but rather thus, Whatsoever
ye would that any man should do unto you, do ye the like in like case to every
man, in that he is man, in that he is your fellow Creature, in that he is the
Son of your heavenly Father, be he otherwise friend, or foe. Yet further, we
may; nay we must enlarge this Precept, if we will have the full meaning of it,
Thus. Whatsoever ye would should be done unto you, whether by Man, by Angel (or
any other of Gods ministering Spirits or procurer of mankinds good) or by God
himself, That do to every man because every man that God to his Father, who as
He has a care and providence over all, so is it his will that every Creature
under him, all men especially that call him Father, should be his Ministers in
procuring and furthering any others good, of whom this our heavenly Father
vouchsafes to take care and charge.

A lively Emblem of this Duty we have in the Ravens feeding of Eliah, being
destitute of all ordinary means of Food; If we consider the nature of this
Bird, none more Ravenous, none more Greedy of the Prey then it: yet because the
Lord feeds the young Ravens, when they call upon him, being otherwise destitute
of ordinary relief from their Dams or old Ones (as both Aristotle and Pliny
observe; and the Psalmist alludes to it in that speech) Therefore, the Lord
commanded them to afford the like help to Elias being forsaken or rather
persecuted by the King and his Officers, who should have yielded him house and
harbor; and from their example we should learn the practice, to do for others,
as either the Lord has done, or, we expect he should do for us.

Thus much I say is fully and directly included in our Saviors Deductions and
Conclusions drawn from this Principal Rule, albeit so much be not fully expressed
in his words; especially if we observe the Greek phrase only: But the language
(whose manner of Dialect the Evangelists retain though writing in the Greek
Tongue) will very well bear, and our Saviors words Luke 6. 36. verse enforce
as much, Be ye therefore merciful as your H. Father is merciful: and in the 6.
of Matthew. v. 14. He tells us, that if we look for mercy at Gods hand, we must
show mercy unto men; not to our friends or brethren by kindred or Nation, but
unto men. The place is so much the more worth our observation, because he adds
no Exposition or Comment to any one Petition in all the Lords Prayer, save only
that He gives this Note upon that [And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
them that trespass against us;] his Note is this, If ye forgive men their
Trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you; -- But if you do not
forgive men their Trespasses, no more will your Heavenly Father forgive you
your Trespasses. Wherefore, as we desire God to forgive us our Trespasses,
though we have been his Enemies, so must we be ready to forgive our Enemies:
and as we desire all good of him; so must we be ready not only to forgive, but
even to do any good to our enemies. If he be our enemy deservedly, we should
therefore do him good that we might make amends for the occasion offered: if
our Enemy he be without any just occasion given by us, we should consider, that
this voluntary Enmity in him is the work of Satan, but he Himself, as man, is
our fellow Creature, the workmanship of Gods own hand; God made him man, but
the Devil made him an Enemy: And we should seek by all means possible to
dissolve the works of Satan, and to repair the handy work of God: that is, we
should love his person, and seek to reform his vice; we should overcome his
evil with our good will to him: if he be hungry we should give him meat; if
thirsty, drink; as the Apostle commands. In sum, we must feed Him, but Romans
12. 20.
seek to starve his Humor, by substracting all occasions of exasperating his
mind, and seeking occasions to do him good; so, the heat of his malice having
nothing to work upon, will by little and little, die, as fire goes out when the
fuel fails.

16. For a Friends sake that has indeared us to him for many, of whom we yet
expect more kindnesses, we think it good manners to tolerate many things, which
otherwise we would not. And shall not Christian Faith and true Religion teach
us much more to remit all for Gods sake, of whom we have received our selves,
our very bodies and souls and all that we have? of whom we yet expect much more
then we have received, even everlasting life and immortal bodies to be crowned
with Glory? What if our Enemies have sought to take away this miserable and
mortal life? God freely gave it us, who likewise at his pleasure may justly
challenge it. And if we cannot justly complain if he should take it from us, is
it an hard Precept that he wills us not to revenge, yea not to complain by way
of revenge, of such as would but could not take it from us?

The Lord may as justly command us to forbear all desire of revenge, all
complaint of such as would take away our Life, as he himself can take it.

That they would so have done, was their own, That they could not do so unto
us, is the Lords doing, to whom we owe all thankfulness for preserving it, and
this may be the best occasion of showing our thankfulness, if we for his sake
forgive such as sought to take away our Lives. Nay if we would but examine this
Precept by exact Reason (passion set aside) in as much as God has freely given
us life, he might most Justly command us not to murmur against such as should
take it from us. For who can appoint him his Time? or who can refuse any for
his Executioner whom the Supreme Judge of Heaven and Earth shall permit? But in
as much as God has preserved our lives which our Enemies sought, he may justly
command, and we must obey him, so commanding, to do any good unto them that
sought our evil. God is a a more Absolute Lord over the lives of Kings and
Princes then they are over their Lands or goods; he has a more absolute
interest in all men's actions and affections then any man has in his own goods
or fruits of his ground. Now what Lord or Master is there that would endure
such a servant as would not bestow his goods or benevolence on whomsoever it
pleased him to appoint, albeit he were his servants enemy? If this we refuse,
and yet acknowledge our selves to be Gods servants, may not God justly say unto
us? Ex tuo ipsius ore judicaberis. If any refuse to set his affections on
whomsoever God shall appoint him, to employ his actions for whose good it
pleases him, albeit he be our open enemy. How much more ought we to do it if
we consider the Hope of reward in the life to come?

17. Thus you see The First ground of this precept drawn from The equality of
all men by nature, improved, and fortified by the Doctrine of Faith, that is,
by The acknowledgement of One Father and Creator, and yet may it be further
confirmed, if we consider what Affinity, nay what Consanguinitie we all have
in Christ, and, what he has done for us.

We are (says the Apostle, if we be Christ's) flesh of his Flesh, and bone of
his Bone. Our conjunction with him (if we be or would be conjoined with Him)
although it be spiritual and mystical, yet is it a True, a real and lively
conjunction. He is a True and lively Head; we are true and lively members of
him, and one of another: And must have as true a fellow feeling one of another
harms or sorrows, as one part of our own body has of the pain of another. No
body Politic ever on earth, not the most united in place, in Laws, customs
or any other Bond of Civil Society whatsoever, had, or can have the like
union, or so near conjunction, as all that are members of Christ's mystical
Body truly have; as all that profess themselves members thereof should in
practice testify that they have: otherwise, as the Lawyers say, Protestatio
non valet contra factum. It is in vain to profess thou art a Christian, in
vain to protest thou art a true professor or Protestant, if thy deeds and
resolution, if thy practice do not seal the truth of thy profession or
Protestation: for not doing this (as the Apostle says) thou shall confess
Christ and Christianity with thy lips, but deny both Him and it, in thy deeds
and in thy practice: and so thou shall be judged, not according to thy sayings,
but according to thy works and resolution, or omissions of working.

Would you know then what some of the Heathen have thought of the duties of
every member in a body Politic? Plato in his fifth Book, De Republica, has a
comparison to this purpose. If a man receive a wound in any part, as in his
foot or hand; or have but some pain or grief in his finger, we will not say,
That his hand or foot is wounded, or that his finger feels pain; But, The man
himself has suffered a wound in his hand or foot; That he himself has a great
pain; etc. For albeit the pain or grief spring first from this or that part,
yet it overflowes and affects the whole body; The branches of it spread
throughout all parts: and every part is worse because one part is so ill. Yea
every part forbears its natural function or recreation in some measure, for the
ease of this; The head wants its sleep, other parts their rest, by reason of
the spirits recourse thither, as so many comforters sent from them to visit
their sick friend or fellow member. In like manner Plato thought it meet, that
in every City or Commonweal, as often as any good or harm did happen to any
Citizen or Free denizon thereof, it should not be counted that man's good or
harm only, but the good or harm of the whole City; and every member thereof
should be alike affected. If this the Heathens by mere light of nature could
discern to be the duty of the mere natural man, what tongue of man or Angel
can express in Terms befitting so high A mystery, what Brotherhood, what
fellowship, what Sympathy, and what affection should be between the members of
Christ's Body? for no society like this; no fellowship like to that in Him. This
union exceeds all other much more then the union of one part of our heart with
another does the union of the heart with the foot. Doubtless our Savior spoke
according to the duty, if not according to the custom of honest hearty
neighbors, in the good old world, in the Parable of the lost sheep and Groat?
His rejoicing for the recoverie of his strayed sheep, was not his alone but his
neighbors also: Her sorrow for loss of her money, was not only hers but her
Gossips, as after the finding it, her joy was theirs too.

It is worth the consideration, and I beseech you to consider; what a madness
it would seem to a wise man, if because the finger did ache or pain him, a man's
head or heart and inward thoughts should presently resolve to cut it off, or
vex it more because it did vex them. Yet such is our malice and madness, if,
because our brother or fellow member in Christ (so we must account all that
Communicate with us in the same Sacraments) does vex or torment us, we should
therefore resolve to vex and torment him again. This is A Symptom of such
hellish Phrenzie as the Poet describes;

Ipse suos Artus lacero divellere morsu Certat. As monstrous and pitiful a
Spectacle to the eyes of Faith, as it would be to the eyes of the Body to see,
as we have heard of some (hanged quick in irons) ready to starve for hunger,
and destitute of hopes of other food, to eat the flesh of their arms to
satisfy their gnawing entrals. So monstrous is their sin, so miserable their
estate, that to satiate their revengeful minds, or to wreck their imbred spite,
do harm, vex or torment their Fellow Members in Christ. If you bite and devour
one another, (says the Apostle, Gal. 5. 16.) see that ye be not not consumed
one of another. His meaning is; Whosoever does vex or harm his brother, shall
feel the smart of it himself one time or other, as certainly as the heart or
soul that wounds or cuts an outward member shall feel the smart or want of it.
And again, that whosoever yields any comfort to his distressed or comfortless
brother, shall as certainly be partaker of the good he does to him, as the
heart, which directs or the hand which applies the medicine to any ill affected
part, shall find ease and rest by the mitigation of the sickly members pain.

18. Would you then know the most certain compendious way to do your selves
most good? seek as far as in you lies to do good to all other men: seek not
your own good so much as the good of others; or rather seek your own good
especially by the means of doing good to others. Consider, that there is a
great reward promised to such as do good to others; but there is no promise
made for doing good to our selves. If we seek to enrich our selves or advance
our estate, we have our reward if we obtain riches or advancement: but if we
relieve those that be in necessity; if we assist or direct into good ways,
those, that for want of means may be tempted to ill courses, To this double
good work (which both relieves the Body and rescues the soul) There is
appointed a great reward. There is a reward promised to such as relieve the
poor; none to such as enrich themselves. There is a reward promised to such as
comfort the broken hearted, none to such as solace themselves with mirth and
pass their Time in pleasures. There is a reward for those that raise Up them
that fall, none to them that being in competent estate, seek to advance
themselves. If such as seek riches get riches; if such as seek advancement get
advancement, verily they have their full reward: But if they get or seek it to
the prejudice of their poor brethren, their sin is grievous; And our Savior
Christ pronounces A woe unto them, Luke 6. 24. Woe unto you that are rich for
you have received your consolation. Is this the condition of all such as be
rich? no; but of such rich ones as regard not (understand not) the poor. Of
such as seek to enrich themselves more then to relieve others. Woe be to you
that be full, to wit, when others are hungry and you give them not to eat. Woe
unto you that laugh, to wit, in time of Public calamity and woe, when you
should mourn with your brethren that do mourn; for thus not doing unto them as
you would be done unto in the like case, God shall do that to you which you
would not, and give them their hearts desire: God will turn their mourning into
joy, and your laughter into tears.

A False Balance, says Solomon, is abomination to the Lord, but a perfect
weight pleases Him. Pro. 11. 1. Now to be more desirous to do good to our
selves then to others, is as it were to buy with a greater measure and sell
with a less: For even this practice were no cousenage in Hucksters and
marketters, unless the Balance of their hearts and minds were unequally set
before, that is, unless the measure of their desire of private gain were
greater then their desire of doing good to others.

This is the point wherein their own Beam differs from, or disagrees with Gods
Balance hung up in their consciences, Love thy neighbor as thy self. Do as you
would be done unto.

God that tries the very heart and reins does weigh all our secret thoughts
more exactly and curiously then we would weigh Gold: and by how much we are
more desirous to receive good from others then to do Them Good so much more
shall we want of our hearts desire.

This is the second point wherein the Doctrine of Grace exceeds the Law of
nature.

The Heathen had a surmise or fear that some like evil might befall them as
they had done to others; yet was not their expectation of punishment so
certain, but they thought it might be, and often was, prevented with policy;
or if they escaped unpunished in this life, they thought themselves safe
enough: whereas we certainly know and believe that God will certainly bring all
to equality: and it shall go worst with them that go unpunished in this life:
for usually his punishments in this life bring men as it were to a composition
with their adversaries, both teaching them to do as they would be done unto,
and to repent for the wrongs they have committed: but such as pass this life
unpunished and impenitent are arrested at their first entry into the other,
they fall immediately into the Jaylors hands from whence there is no Redemption.

19. Thus much of the First Point (according to the method proposed. 5.) that
is, Of the equity of the Precept, and of the Grounds or motives which might
incite us to the performance of it, either drawn from the Law of Nature, or
from the Law of Grace, the Holy Gospel.

Of the Second Point (that is, In what sense The Observation of it is the
fulfilling the Law and Prophets, or, How The Command it self contains the Sum
of the Law and Prophets;) afterward.

Here only for A Ground to Application, I take it as granted, That natural
Reason and the written Law teach every man what is good for himself and whereon
to set his desires. And this Rule of Nature and Precept of The Application.
our Savior binds every man to further his Neighbor or Fellow Creature in all
such desires, that is, Generally in all desires which pertain either unto the
necessary supplies or comforts of this life, or to the hopes and means of
attaining the life to come.

Unto what part of the Affirmative Precept, it is most requisite I should
exhort you; or from what part of the Negative I should dissuade you, I cannot
tell: because I am ignorant in what part of the one you are defective, or in
what part of the other you most exceed. In both (no doubt) we all offend: both,
In not doing to others (in sundry cases) as we desire it should be done to us;
and also, in doing that to others which we would not have them do to us.

Two especial Breaches of this Law of Nature I have observed (so far as my
experience reaches) and have heard noted by others to be almost general
through out the Land.

The one, in not affording our distressed brethren that comfort for the support
of this life, which in their case we would desire.

The other, in procuring their undoing or grievous loss by our greedy desires
of enlarging our own estates, advancing our selves, or increasing our wealth
and commodity.

For the First, None of us can be ignorant, how in ofttimes, Sometimes the
Famine, oft-times, nay always for this seven or eight years past, the Plague of
Pestilence has raged one where or other, throughout the Land. The grievousness
of that Malady albeit we know not fully, yet that we know it in some sort, and
esteem of it as a grievous malady, A Plague indeed sent from God, our fear of
it when it is near unto us does sufficiently witness: and from the measure of
our own fear or care to avoid it, we may gather how desirous we would be of any
comfort, if it should seize upon us: Of any comfort I say, either bodily to
case the pain by Lenitives, or to prevent the last danger of it by Physic and
good Diet. Or if in these we could have no Hope, the less we had in them, the
more desirous would we be of spiritual comfort under the wings of the Almighty.
The less help, Art, or Nature, or men themselves could afford us, the more
earnestly would we desire hearty prayers for succor and comfort from the
Almighty. It would much strengthen our Faith and Hope, to know that others did
join with us in fervent prayers for mercy; and it would much lessen our bodily
grief and discontent of mind, to know that they did bear a part with us: it
would abate our sorrow to know that they did abate their wonted mirth and
jollitie as in compassion to us. The Saying is most true;

Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris: But the solace is most comfortable,
when men do willingly and not by constraint share with us in our misery: for
then they take as it were part of our burden from us, and put it upon their
own shoulders: So as that which is most heavy and grievous whilst it is only
laid upon one or some few, becomes very light and easy when it is divided and
laid upon many willing to communicate in the burden.

These and many like, but more effectual Arguments, all of us could plead for
our selves, if we were in this or any other kind of misery. But who is he of a
thousand that would lay half of this to heart when sorrow lies heaviest upon
his poor distressed brethren? I know not how men in this place are affected;
but elsewhere for the most part, if they be so mindful of their distressed
brethren, as to relieve their wants and furnish them with the necessaries of
this life, they think it almost a work of super-erogation: and if they should
not be commended for it at first, they would be more slack to do the like again.

But that they should afflict or pinch themselves for others penury; That they
should abate their ordinary mirth for others sorrow, is an ungrateful Doctrine,
almost a Point of Puritanism. Or if some be thus well minded toward their
neighbors or allies they think they have sufficiently discharged their duty:
They think this Precept of our Savior extends it self no further then the
Statutes of the Land, binding them to do good (such good as they would have
done to them) only to the men of their own or the next Parish. As for the
miseries of such as are afar off, the sound of them enters not into their
ears; their sighs and groans move not their hearts.

If we should tell the people of one Shire or Country, That they ought to
mourn and lament, to fast and pray for the afflictions of others some forty
miles off, or in the utmost confines of another Country in this Realm, They
would be ready (I am afraid) to laugh at our folly, and count us as uncivil as
any voluntary disturbes of their sports. But here I trust I may be bold to say
as much as the Lord has said, whose word requires, at least as much, I think
much more then I have done.

20. Consider (I beseech you) What was their sin to whom Amos pronounces the
dreadful Woe; Amos. 6. 1. Woe to them that are at ease in Sion! Why? What harm
was there in this? May not men take their ease? Yea, when the Times so permit.
But now their Brethren of Samaria were disquieted by their Enemies; ease, which
before was good, was now unseasonable and preposterous, because not consorting
with their Brethrens Estate.

They lie upon Beds of Ivorie and stretch themselves upon their Beds, and eat
the Lambs out of the Flock, and Calves out of the Stall. What of all this? Does
any man keep a Flock, and eats not of the milk thereof? Does any man plant a
Vineyard and not eat of the Fruit thereof? Yea, of all or any the increase
thereof at his pleasure? Yet is not all kind of eating (of moderate eating) fit
for every season, There is a Time as well of Fasting as of eating
and Feasting. Herein then was their sin, that they did not sympathize with
their brethren, who were either pined for hunger or fed with the bread of
Affliction.

They sing (says the Prophet) unto the sound of the Viol; they invent to
themselves Instruments of Music like David. Why? Could they have followed a
better Example? Not if they had followed it aright: for David's Music was
invented to praise the Lord. And Yet (as the Sons or Daughters of Sion might
have replied) partly to delight himself and his friends. It may be so! Where is
the point of difference then? There is a Time to be sad, says Solomon, and a
Time to be merry; a Time to weep and a Time to laugh. Every thing has its
appointed Time, and every thing out of his Time is preposterous and evil. If
David did solace himself with pleasant mirth, it was because prosperity
flourished in those Times; he did not use it when news was brought him of Saul
and Jonathans Death, nor when the Angel of the Lord had smitten his people with
the Plague of Pestilence. Those against whom Amos speaks did sin, in that they
had their Ps. 35. 13
pleasant music whilst their brethrens miseries did call them to the house of
mourning. These had their delightful Ditties, whilst their brethren were ready
to sing the Lords Song in a strange Land.

This was it that did so displease the Lord, that they were so desirous Esai.
22. 12. Ezekiel. 21. 10.
to please themselves with these or any other delights, whilst his heavy wrath
was upon their neighbor Countries. They drink Wine in Bowls and anoint
themselves with the choice Ointments, but no man is sorry for the afflictions
of Joseph. This was a grievous sin in Judah, that they were not sorry for the
affliction of Israel, that is, of the ten Tribes. It was a grievous sin in the
Princes and Nobles, that they did not mourn and lament for the miseries of the
mean and common People. Therefore, says the Lord, now shall they go Captive
with the first that go captive, and the sorrow of them that stretch themselves
is at hand. So certain it is, That God will make their misery greatest, that
will not equalize themselves in public Calamities to their Brethren.

The Second Sermon upon this Text.
CHAP. XXXIII.
MATTHEW. 7. 12. Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do
unto you, do ye even so unto them; For this is the Law and the Prophets.
The Second General (according to the Method proposed, Chapt. 32. Sect. 5.)
handled. This Precept [Do as ye would be done to:] more then Aequivalent to
that [Love thy neighbor as thy self:] For by Good Analogy it is Applicable to
all the Duties of the first Table which we owe to God for our very Being and
all his other Blessings in all kinds bestowed on us. Our desires to receive
Good things from God, ought to be the measure of our Readiness to return
obedience to his will, and all other duties of dependents upon his Grace and
Goodness. God, in giving Isaac, did what Abraham desired: And Abraham in
offering Isaac did what God desired. Two Objections made and answered. 1. That
This Rule may seem to establish the Old Pythagorean Error of Retaliation, and
the new One of Paritie in Estates. 2. That the Magistrate in punishing
offenders (it seems) in some Case must of necessity either violate this Rule
or some other.

THat this Precept [Do as ye would be done to] does contain as much as that
Other [Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self] is evident to every man at the
first sight. For, that we desire either to have How this Precept (Do as you,
etc) contains all the Second Table.
any good or no evil, done unto us, it is from the love we bear unto our
selves. And if we could be, as desirous to do all good, and as unwilling to do
any evil unto others, as we are to have the one done, the other not done, to
our selves; our love to Others, and Our selves would be equal. And if we love
others (or our neighbors) as our selves, then we have fulfilled the Law. So
St. Paul says, Romans 13. 8. Owe nothing to any man, but to love one another,
for he that loves another has fulfilled the Law; for this, Thou shall not
commit adultery. Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not bear
false witness. Thou shall not covet. And if there be any other Commandment, it
is briefly comprehended in this saying, even in this, Thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self.

But here arises a Question, concerning the extent of these words [If there be
any other Commandment.]

The Frame or Form of Speech is Universal, and may seem to import thus much, If
there be any other Commandment whatsoever. Notwithstanding the best
Interpreters usually restrain it thus, If there be any Commandment of the
second Table, it is comprehended in this short saying, Thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self: Whereas St. Paul had here reckoned up all the
Commandments of the Second Table, save only one (which indeed is rather the
Medius Terminus or coupling of the First and Second Table, as much belonging to
the one as to the other) that is, Honor thy Father and thy Mother.

More fitly might the same words be restrained thus; If there be any other
commandment, whether one of those Ten mentioned, Exodus 20. or elsewhere in the
Law which concerns the duty of man to man, be it one, or be they more, they be
contained in This saying, Love thy neighbor as thy self. But as for our duty
toward God, or those four Commandments of the First Table; they may seem no
way comprehended in the former Saying; and this restraint may, it seems, be
gathered from our Saviors Doctrine, Matthew. 22. ver. 37. For being asked which
was the greatest Commandment in the Law? He answered, Thou shall Love the Lord
thy God with all thine Heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; This is
the first and great Commandment: As if he had said, This is that Commandment
which contains in it most of the Rest; or all that concern our duty toward
God; But there is A second like unto it, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy
self, and on these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets; Hence
as some collect, our Savior in my Text, says not, This is the whole Law and
the Prophets; But, This is the Law and the Prophets: because This precept, to
their seeming, is but equivalent unto That, Thou shall love thy neighbor as
thy self; which is but One and the less of the Two, on which hangs the whole
Law and the Prophets?

2. Yet may it be further Questioned, In what sense These Commandments are said
to be Two? as whether they be, as we say, Primo diversa; as distinct as the
Commandments of Murder and Theft; neither of which is any way included in the
other, or dependent upon it: Or whether they be only so distinguished as the
Old Testament and the New; that is, as is said, Novum Testamentum velatum est
in veteri, et vetus Revelatum in Novo: The New Testament is in the Old, but
invailed; and the Old, revealed in the New: so we may say, That, the first and
great Commandment, Of loving God withal our heart, and all our soul, is
implicitly contained in the second, of loving our neighbors as our selves: and
the second again expressly or impulsively contained in the former.

Thus much is certain that no man loves his neighbor aright, unless he love
him for Gods sake whom He loves above all and whose love commands all other
love. In this sense says St. James, whosoever shall keep the whole law
besides, and fail in one Commandment (that is wittingly and willingly; or if he
would grant himself an Indulgence or dispensation of breaking that one) He is
guilty of all. Why of all? St. James adds; He that said thou shall not commit
Adultery, said also, thou shall not kill. His meaning is, He that gave one
commandment gave all: and therefore, he that breaks one willingly and
wittingly, keeps none truly and sincerely; because He observes them not, in as
much as God commanded them to be kept, for then He would be desirous to observe
all alike: or if he show diverse effects of love unto his neighbor, these
proceed not from the love of God, for that would command all his Affections,
and every effect of love as well as One. He can expect no reward of God as the
fruit of such love, because it is not thoroughly rooted in the entire and
sincere Love of God. So that their Reasons, who restrain this precept only to
the second Table, admit a double exception.

First, It is not proved by them, that This Precept is adaequate, or only but
aequivalent to that, Love thy neighbor as thy self.

Secondly, If it were, yet the fulfiling of This might be Interpretative the
fulfilling of the Law, seeing no man can love his neighbor, but he must love
God above all.

3. It is as true again that no man can love God, unless he love his brother
also; so says St. John, 1. Epist. chapter 4. ver. 20. If any man say He loves God
and hate his brother, he is a liar; for how can he that loves not his brother
whom he has seen, love God whom he has not seen? So that our love to God must
be the motive or incitement for us to love our neighbor: and yet the same love
of God must be perfected and made complete in us by practicing love for his
sake upon our neighbors. So says St. John, verse 11. If God so loved So
Christ said to St. Peter's Love thou me? Feed my sheep: So David said to God.
Psalm. 16 My goodness extends not to thee: But to the Saints that are in
earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight.
us, we ought also to love one another; no man has seen God at any time. As if
he had said, We cannot direct our love immediately to God himself, because He
dwells in light that none can attain unto; but our love must be bestowed upon
our neighbors, that is, upon men, in whom His Image shines, and loving them
in Him and for His sake, we love him more then them: and this is it which S.
John says in the same place, If we love one another God dwells in us and his
love is perfect in us. And in like sort, when we do to men as we desire they
should do unto us (because this is a Duty acceptable to God, and proceeds from
the love we bear to him) we do not only perform our duty toward men, but also
our duty toward God. So that This Rule rightly practiced, is the whole Law and
the Prophets, and in effect equivalent to those Two Commandments, Love God
above all; and thy neighbor as thy self: as appears out of the former
Collections. But is more evident, if we observe the Former Extent or exposition
of it, which was thus -- Whatsoever ye would should be done unto you, either by
God or man, That do to all men as they are your fellow creatures, for your
Creators sake. Or if we would further search out the exact Temper and
constitution of mind whereat this precept aims, it consists (as I may so speak
in Aequilibrio:) in the aequipoise of our desires of doing and receiving good,
whether the Good be to be directed immediately unto God or to our neighbors
for his sake. That is, we should be as ready to glorify Gods name both
secretly, with our hearts, and by outward profession and practice of good
Deeds, as we are desirous to receive any blessing or benefit from him.

And thus it is evident that the exact performance of this Precept would be the
exact fulfilling of the Law and Prophets; that the performance of every part of
this duty sincerely, in some, though not in perfect measure, is in like sort,
the fulfilling of the Law, Quoad perfectionem vel integritatem See St. Aug: De
Civit. Dei. Lib. 10. Cap 4. and 15. Cap. 22. and Lud. vives's Comment.
partium, as the Schools say, though not quoad perfectionem Graduum: that is,
observing this Rule (as it has been expounded) we shall observe every
Commandment or part of the Law, though none of them in that perfect and exact
measure which we should; but performing the former, the Blood of Christ Jesus
shall cleanse us from all our guilt of sin whereto we are liable, if God should
enter into judgment with us for not performing of the later. Thus you have seen
how this precept does directly concern both the First and Second Table.

4. Yet further! That even that love and duty which we owe unto our neighbors
does Collaterally likewise respect every Preceept of the First Table: for we
are bound by this love we owe one to another, every one according to his
calling, opportunity and ability, to instruct another in the knowledge of every
precept, whether of the First or Second Table, or any other part of the Law,
and to incite one another to the performance of the same, and to dehort from
their Breach or Transgression. So says the Lord, Levit. 19. v. 17. Thou shall
not hate thy brother in thy heart, but thou shall plainly rebuke thy neighbor
and suffer him not to sin, not to transgress any of Gods Commandments
whatsoever.

The sum of all is this. The Law of Nature, and the Law of God, teach every man
to know what is good for himself; and thereupon to fix his desires: and this
Rule of Nature, whose practice is here enjoined by our Savior, binds every man
to be as willing to further his Neighbor or Fellow Creature in pursuit of any
lawful good, as he is desirous of the same himself; whether these desires be of
things pertaining to this life, or to the hopes and means of obtaining the life
to come. An Objection against this precept thus improved and expounded.


Yet against this Precept it may be Objected, That it may seem to establish the
Pythagorean Retaliation, which was such an error in Philosophy, as the present
error of the Anabaptists is in Religion. Both of them tending to an Equality
of all sorts of men. So may this Rule seem at first sight to make all men
Equal. For if every man must do to others as he would be done unto; Then, most
the Master perform the like duties to the servant as he expects from him; so
must the Prince unto his Subjects, the Magistrate to such as are under him; the
Father to the Son, etc.

There be some common Grounds which will serve to Answer other Objections which
may be made;

As first, Whatever ye would etc. must be understood of a Regulated Will, A
Will not tainted with any inordinate self-love or sinful desires.

Secondly, It must be interpreted with A Salvo to all Gods other Commandments,
They must stand as God has set them, reconciled to one another, and not be set
at variance by our exorbitant wills or affections.

Thirdly, It must not be extended to the dissolving of Order, and disparagement
of Dignities or Powers ordained by God.

But this Objection may have its proper Solution two ways.

First, The meaning of the Precept is not, that we should do the self same to
every man in every estate, which we expect he should do to us, living in that
An Answer to the Objection.
estate wherein we are; For seeing there is an Inequality of Estates, there
must be also an Inequality or diversity of Duties belonging to those several
Estates.

The meaning then is thus, Whatsoever you could wish that men should do unto
you, supposing you were in the same estate they are in, that you must do to
them now they are in that estate. Thus the Greatest Monarch on earth, in as
much as He is but man, and might have been or may be yet subject to another
pleasure, must stoop to this consideration, what usage he would expect of his
Prince if he himself were a Subject; and he must afford the self fame to them.
So must the Father likewise consider what usage he did expect of his Parents,
and the like he must afford unto his children. So likewise must every Inferior
seriously consider with himself, what respect he would desire of his Inferiors
were he in place of Authority, and the self same he must afford unto such as
are his lawful Magistrates; Otherwise (besides the evil of confusion) if either
Superior or inferior use other loss respectively or more contemptuously, then
they would be content withal, themselves, the Righteous Judge will reduce all
to equality. Thus St. Paul teaches, Colos. 3. ver. 20. Children (says he)
obey your parents in all things for that is well-pleasing to the Lord: and
verse 21. Fathers provoke not your children to anger. And concerning servants
he says more expressly, Ephesians. 6. v. 5. Servants be obedient unto them that are
your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service as men pleasers, but
as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart: and ye masters
(as it follows in the 9. verse) do the same things unto them, putting away
threatening, and know that your master also is in Heaven, neither is there
respect of persons with him. If either servants would use their masters
otherwise then they would be used if they were masters, or masters Use their
servants otherwise then they would be Used if they were such, God will bring a
more miserable servitude on the One and continue it on the other.

From these places of St. Paul, we may likewise frame a Second Answer to to the
former Objection, Thus. If we compare men in their several estates wherein they
live, wherein they are, not wherein they may be, then this mutual Duty of doing
as we would be done unto must not be paid (as we say) in Kind, but in
Proportion.

The Rule is this; seeing all men delight in comfort and contentation of mind,
and only that is such which is truly good in respect of the party which desires
it, every man should be desirous to do that good to others which is best
befitting his estate wherein he may take true comfort and best content. Seeing
great personages take great comfort in honor and serviceable respects,
inferiors should with a good mind give Honor to whom Honor is due; and they
should be as ready, though not to Honor their inferiors, yet to afford them
that wherein they have more delght, as in relieving the poor and needy by
Hospitality; in countenancing others of competent estate in their commendable
courses; in protecting them from wrong; or (in a word) according to the
Exigence of their several states or occasions.

6. Again it may be objected, That this Rule however we interpret it; must be
violated by the Public Magistrate in inflicting punishment upon Offenders. A
Second Objection.
For many a man that has deserved Death according to Positive Laws, will
naturally, and that I think without offense, be most desirous of life, and
would make earnest suit for his release.

The Question is, Whether the public Magistrate in this Case should do as he
would be done unto if he were in the like Case. For it may seem, that either he
must transgress the Positive Laws to which he is sworn; or violate this Law of
Nature which is more sacred then any Positive Law.

The Answer is easy, from that which has been said before. No public Officer
is here to propose unto himself this one man or Malefactors Case, but rather
the Commonwealths, or such in it as deserve better, and yet might be further
endangered, by Malefactors escaping unpunished; if his Case were theirs, he
would be desirous to have the Law executed, and therefore must afford them this
their just desire, if it be in his power, otherwise such pity finds oft-times
at Gods hands the reward of Cruelty.

A notable Example whereof we have in Alexander de Medices, the first of that
Family that took upon him to be the Prince of Florence, but not so willing to
execute Justice as to usurp Authority. He, contrary to his Country Laws,
granted pardon to a Murderer at one of his near Kinsmens Request, who
afterward willing to purchase Fame by freeing his Country from his Kinsmans
Duke Alexanders Tyranny, used the former Malefactors help in killing the Duke
which had given him life at his request.

7. But to return to that we were upon, when these Objections crossed our way:
God weighs our secret thoughts more exactly then we can do bodies gross and
sensible. As the Balance is just in our sight, when both ends are even, and
both alike apt to be aequally moved with equal weights; so Men's affections are
right balanced, when they be as ready to do, as to receive good.
are our thoughts in Gods sight, just, when we are as apt to do good, as ready
to receive it.

We may desire or receive good either from men or from God, and we may return
good respectively to both; kindnesses (as we say in kind) to men; Duties of
obedience, praise, and thanks etc. unto God. To men we may repay good either
for their own sakes, or because we would desire good from them in like case; or
else, because we expect good from God. The equality of our conditions as men,
as fellow creatures, or brethren in Christ, binds us to afford the same
measure of good to others; not which they have measured to us, but as we desire
they should do to us if we were in their case. Every man knows his own desires,
and therefore cannot he ignorant what he should do. If they have dealt ill with
us, we may not in any case deal so with them; for we were unwilling to receive
ill, and therefore should be as unwilling to repay it; and the rather, for fear
God do to us as we do to them; Because in so doing we took his office into our
hands. If they have done us any good, we are more strictly bound to repay them
in larger measure then we received it; because we were prevented by them: As in
a Balance even set, the Rebound does always exceed the first sway or motion;
so in repaying such good to our brethren, as God has graciously dealt to us,
we should exceed the former proportion; because we are bound to distribute to
their necessities, so is not He to ours. And always the freer the Gift is, the
greater should the receivers thankfulness be.

This was that which aggravated the unthankful servants offense, that seeing
his master had freely forgiven him, yet he would not forgive his fellow
servant. (Mat. 18. 23.) We are in many respects bound most strictly, to render
unto God himself according to his reward. (It was Hezekiahs sin that he did not
so. 2 Chro. 32. 24,) First, because he has prevented us with his blessings; he
gave us Being before we could desire it; and with it He gave us a desire of
continuing it. Secondly, he gave it Us of his mere freewill and abundant
kindness: And therefore in all equity we are bound, First to render what
possibly we can unto Him, and that with greater alacrity and cheerfulness then
unto man for his sake; as Reason teaches us, to perform our personal duties
and services to our Parents, Patrons, and Benefactors with greater care and
forwardness, then such offices as for their sakes we owe to their Followers or
Favorites. Hence may we descry the equity of those two main Commandments on
which the whole Law and Prophets depend: [Love God above all; and thy neighbor
as thy self.] All the services of worship, of praise, thankfulness or the like,
which we return immediately to God himself, belong unto the First Table. All
the duties we perform to men, either because we have received, or could desire
like kindness from them; or because we expect some greater matters from God,
belong unto the second Table. It remains we see how this Rule does direct our
thoughts for the true practice of every particular Commandment: What I omit,
your own meditation may easily supply.

8. None of us (as in charity I presume) is so ignorant of God or his Goodness,
but often prays that he would continue his blessings of life and health unto
us: desiring withal, that he would do some other good unto us, which yet we
want, Could we in the next place take a perfect measure of our own desires of
what we want, whilst they are fresh, and at the height, and withal duly weigh
those Blessings of life and health, considering the full and sole dependence
they have on the good-wil and pleasure of our God; the strength of the one and
weight of the other, could not but impell and sway our minds to performance of
such duties toward God, as his Law and this Rule of Reason require. These are
good Beginnings of such performances, as this Rule requires. But here we
usually commit a double oversight. A double oversight


First, We do not weigh blessings received as duly and truly as we should. For
who is he, that truly considers what life is, till he come in danger of death?
Or how pleasant health is, till he be pained with some grievous sickness,
wound, or other malady? Or if we come by such occasions duly to esteem of life
and health, or other blessings already enjoyed; or to take a true measure of
our desires of what we want, whilst they are fresh and at the height; yet
either we apprehend not, or we consider not, what absolute and entire
dependence the beginning or continuance of benefits received, or the
completing of others desired, have on the good will and pleasure of our God.
We think we are in part beholden to our Parents for our Life, to our Physician,
to our strength of nature or good diet, for recovery of health; to our own wit
or friends for obtaining such things as we desire. These or like conceits
arising from ignorance of Gods providence, or want of faith in his Goodness,
are as so many props or stays that hinder the weight of his best Blessings, or
the strength of our desires of further good, to have their full shock upon our
souls and minds. Otherwise, the true consideration or feeling of their
dependence on Gods will and pleasure, would sway and impel us, to do our duty
to him with the same alacrity we desire good from him; to love him with all
our heart, with all our souls, with all our strength: yea, we would
be as desirous to do his will and pleasure, as we are to obtain the things
that please us: as unwilling any way to displease him, as we are to forgo any
thing we have from him. As willing to consecrate our lives and actions to his
service, as we are to enjoy life and use of limbs.

If a Landlord should command his Tenant at will to do him such a business,
perhaps to go some errand of importance for him, or else he should go without
his Tenement; but promise him a better if he did it faithfully; The sweetness,
as well of what he enjoyed, as of the Reward he looked for, would disperse it
self throughout his thoughts, and season his labor with cheerfulness, and make
all his very pains sweet unto him. But if he had lately received an Estate for
Lives, and could not hope for any further good shortly to come from him;
although perhaps he would do what his Lord bad him, least he should be
upbraided with unthankfulness; Yet his service would but be faint and cold in
respect of the former; like his that wrought (as we say) for the dead Horse.

This may serve to set forth the difference betwixt the faithful or true
believers, and the unfaithful or unbelievers heart in the performance of this
great Commandment.

The unbeliever, although he acknowledge in some sort, That he received all he
has, and must expect all he hopes for from God; and in this respect must do
what God commands: yet, if at any time he do his Will, it is without all
Devotion or Cheerfulness: partly, because he thinks the Blessings he looks for,
must be gotten by his own endeavor; and such as he has, have been improved by
his own good husbandry; nor does he fear that the Lord should dispossess him
of life or health, but there will be time enough to gain or renew his Favor,
before his Lease (as he takes it) of life, of health and prosperity be run out.

The faithful man steadfastly believes and knows that God is the Lord and giver
of life; that he kills and makes alive, that he wounds and alone makes whole;
that we have no hold of either, but only during the Term of his Will and
Pleasure: he firmly believes all the threatenings of his Law; as, that either
God will punish sinners with sudden and unexpected death, saying unto them as
he did unto the rich man in the Gospel, Thou Fool! this night shall thy soul be
taken from thee: or else suffers them to enjoy life, and health, and other
Blessings to their greater condemnation. He believes likewise all his promises
to the righteous; to such as do his will. Whence, as well the Goodness of all
the Blessings he injoyes (life, health, wealth, and estate) as of those which
he hopes for, whether in this life, or in the life to come, do as it were
provoke a desire in him of worshipping God and doing his will, equal at least
to his desire of either having present blessings continued, or greater bestowed
upon him. His joy in praising God and keeping his Laws, is greater then in the
enjoying of life, of his soul, his strength, or other endowments. His life is
good to him because it is from God; His soul is good because Good things are
only pleasant, whilst they relish of Gods Goodness.
he knows (and as it were feels) it to be created by God: his health seems
good, because it springs from him who is The Fountain of Salvation. He loves
these because they are good; But he loves God above all, because he is better
then all, even then the best of all his Blessings. These are only Good, because
they are seasoned with a spice or savor of Gods Goodness.

Now as it recreates an hungry man to smell meat, but much more to taste it; so
is it a matter to be more desired, to taste the Goodness of God (as the Psalmist
speaks) then to enjoy the sweet Savor or Fragrance of him in his Creatures. And
we best taste the Goodness of God, by doing His Will and pleasure; as our
Savior says, John 4. 34. My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and
to finish his work.

As we de desire our Spirit at the hour of death should return to God, not only
because he gave it, but because also he is our Bliss; so even in this life,
the sweetest joy that can be found, is, when we are lifted up in Spirit to
behold and taste the Goodness of God; when we can say, with the Blessed Virgin,
My soul does magnify the Lord. We should never desire Him to do us any Good,
but with an instant Return of a more earnest desire, to be enabled to do what
he would have us do; to love him above all, and all other things for his
sake.

Having our thoughts and desires thus composed, although we have not the
particular things we desire, yet shall we have our Hearts desire: because we
delight in the Lord, who alone can satisfy our hearts, otherwise unsatiable.
Whereas the wicked, albeit he get possession of what he most desired, yet has
he not his hearts desire: because the desire of it was (like a good arm, as we
say, cast aw^^; being) set upon a wrong Object, not on the goodness of his God,
nor on his blessings for his sake, but for themselves. He sets his eyes upon
that which is nothing (Prove. 23. 5.) and so cannot satisfy. This gives witness
to the truth of what the Psalmist says. Psalm. 37. 16. A small thing that the
righteous has is better then great riches of the ungodly. Pro. 16. 8.
To the godly, The loving kindness of the Lord is better (not only then all the
means of life, but) then life it self: his soul is satisfied as it were which
marrow and fatness, and his mouth praises God with joyful lips.

As Saint John says, we cannot love God whom we have not seen, unless we love
our brother whom we have seen; So neither can we delight in God who is a
Spirit, unless we first delight (purely, and aright) in his blessings, which
are sensible and agreeable to nature; For, it is true in this sense, First is
that which is natural and then that which is spiritual. And the more we delight
in them; so we duly consider they are his blessings, and that as well the
continuance of them, as of our ability to delight in them, depends upon His
pleasure; the more still we delight in Him.

10. It is an excellent Rule which Solomon has given in this case. Remember
thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the
years approach, wherein thou shall say, I have no pleasure in them. Eccles. 12.
1. See the 6. Book, 2 part chapt. 11. page 95.
To be a Creator, in Solomon's Language, imports as much, as to be the maker of
our Bodies and souls, the Sole giver of all things wherein we can delight, and
sole Author of all the abilities and faculties which make us apt to take
delight therein; sole disposer of all opportunities that bring about the
matters wherein we most delight. And, To remember our Creator, in his Language
also is, diligently and continually to ponder these things, and to be affected
or moved with them according to their weight and importance. But why does he
charge us to remember God, in the days of our youth? Because in that age we
are apt to take greatest delight in our selves, or any thing truly delightful;
our spirits being then most fresh and lively; so that the measure of our
delight, whether in our selves, or in things without us, being then truly
taken, would impell us to a equal delight in Him that was Author and Creator of
Both, and to correspondent Gratulation: whereas deferring of this Remembrance
or notice of our Creator till old age come upon us, wherein life grows to be a
burden, and the wonted delights of life either irksom or insipid (unpleasant or
without all taste or relish) our thankfulness for them will be but faint; our
gratulation worthless, our devotion cold and lumpish.

The former due estimate of our Creators goodness being planted in youth, our
delight in him would grow as our bodily abilities for all natural performances
did decay; we might truly say with the Apostle, when I am weak then I am
strong: and with the Psalmist, They shall bring forth more fruit in their Age,
etc.

11. Thus it was with Abraham; he had feared God in his youth, and obeyed him
in his Mature age; and though he obtained a son by miraculous means in his old
age: yet was he not more joyful at his Birth and growth, then ready to give him
Again to God in his best age. He did unto God, in this particular, as God had
done to him; nay he did as he desired God should do to him: and God did to him
above what he could desire, because he was so Ready to do what God commanded
him: He took and offered Isaac his son, his only son, in whom both he and all
the nations of the earth, as he hoped, should be blessed; and God in lieu of
this his obedience and thankfulness, promises, and in the fullness of Time
sends, his only son in whom he was well pleased, to assume Abraham's seed, and
to offer himself in sacrifice for the sins of the world; a sacrifice for a
blessing to all mankind. Thus, if we show our selves truly thankful for
blessings past, God gives us, over and above what we could desire: do we but
what he would have done by us, he does more then we could wish should be done
for us.

As he offered Isaac his only Son whom he loved in hope to receive him again in
a Joyful Resurrection, so must we offer our dearest affections, our chief
desires; yea our bodies and souls in sacrifice to him, in hope to receive them
glorified and crowned with immortality in the life to come: This is to love
God with all our heart, withal our soul, and with all our strength.

There should be the same mind in us which was in Christ Jesus. He laid down
his life for us, and we should be willing to lay down ours for our Brethren,
which is the chief and most Transcendent part of the second Table: but much
more should we be willing to offer our lives, or consecrate our selves to his
honor and service; to offer our selves in sacrifice to him when he requires,
not only in remembrance of what he has done for us, which we would not for ten
thousand lives but he had done, but in respect of Future Hopes, which, it were
better we had never been, then they should not be accomplished.

We look he should in the last day acquit us from the accusations of Satan the
great Accuser; and in the mean time give Testimony of us, as his faithful
servants, to his Father. The duty which we owe to Him, is, in this life to be
witnesses of the truth he taught: to testify unto the world, that he has
appeared, by our lives and conversations answerable to His; by our Titus. 2. 11
readiness to suffer poverty, exile, disagrace, or ignominious death for
defense of His Laws: to fear him whether in life or death.

12. To every thing we can desire of God, there is A semblable Duty to be
performed by us; without whose performance we cannot pray to Him in Faith. To
pray in Faith, is, to be so surely persuaded of Gods Benignity, as to be A
Duty semblable to every desire.

See. 13.


ready to render up all that he requires of us; to abstain from those things
which we know to be offensive to him; especially, from such as have any
particular repugnance to that we seek. If we expect God should provide for us
as for his children, we must honor and reverence Him as an Almighty and
everlasting Father. If we desire he should protect us, we must fear him as our
Greatest Lord. A son honors his Father and a servant his master: If I then
be a Father where is my Honor? and if I be a master where is my fear? says the
Lord of Hosts unto you. Mal. 1. 6. If ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it
not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick is it not evil? offer it now unto
thy Prince; will he be content with thee, or accept thy person? says the Lord
of Hosts: and now I pray you pray before God that he may have mercy upon us:
This has been by your means, will he regard your persons? says the Lord of
Hosts. No! they did not pray in Faith? For so to pray, presupposes a fidelity
in the discharge of duties appointed for their calling.


God for his part never changes. I am the Lord, I change not, Mal. 3. 6. As if
he had said, This is my nature and essence, to be immutable, And therefore, Ye
Sons of Jacob are not consumed. For so they had been, unless his mercies had
continued the same; But to do them that good they desired, or to deal as
graciously with them as he had done with their fathers, he could not (if with
Reverence I may so speak) because of their infidelity or unbelief (for which
cause the Evangelist says, Christ could not work many miracles amongst His
Countrymen, Matthew. 13. 58.) From the days of your Fathers you are gone away
from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them.

Now there must needs have been a Change in God if he had dealt as bountifully
with this backsliding Generation as with their Godly Predecessors that had
been sted fast in his Covenant. But let them be as their fathers were, and He
will be to them as he was to their Fathers; For he is no accepter of persons,
but rewards every one according to his works. Wherefore he says; Return unto
me and I will return unto you, ver. 7. But they were so far from returning,
that they would scarce acknowledge their sin. For they said, wherein shall we
return? They should have done unto their God accordingly as they desired he
should do to them. They desired the Lord should bless them as Moses had
spoken, In the City and in the field; in the fruit of their bodies and in the
fruit of their grounds; in the fruit of their cattle, and in the increase of
their kine, and in the flocks of their sheep, Deuteronomy. 28. 4. But God at this time
had done to them (in some fort) as they had done to him. They had robbed him in
tithes and offerings, ver. 8. Therefore were they oursed with a curse, ver. 9.
Notwithstanding, if they would deal better with him, he assures them he will
deal better with them. Bring ye all the Tithes into the Storehouse, that there
may be meat in mine house, and prove me herewith, says the Lord of Hosts if I
will not open the windows of Heaven unto you, and pour you out a Blessing
without measure: And I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes, and he shall
not devour the fruit of your ground; neither shall the Vine be barren in the
field, says the Lord of Hosts. And all Nations shall call you blessed, says
the Lord of Hosts.

As he that had wronged his brother was the forwarder to repine against Moses,
so the words of such in this people, as had most robbed and spoiled God, were
most stout against him. They said, It was in vain to serve God. And what profit
is it that we have kept his Commandments? And that we have walked humbly before
the Lord of Hosts? Therefore they accounted the proud blessed even they that
work wickedness are set up; and they that tempt God, yea they, are delivered.
It is not likely that they would thus speak with their mouths, for so they
should have had no occasion to demand as they did. V. 13. What have we spoken
against thee? But, that they thought in their hearts, That God did not respect
them according to their deserts, or that his Bounty had not been so great to
them as to their Fathers. If they said not, they thought with Gideon, Ah my
Lord! if the Lord be with us, why then is all this come upon us? and where be
his miracles which our Fathers have told us? and said, did not the Lord bring
us out of Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the
hand of the Medianites.

He thought this Change was in God, not in himself, or in his Countrymen. As
most men at this day think, that God is not as ready to hear our prayers as he
was to hear the Israelites, or the Fathers in the primitive Church. When as the
reason why he hears them not, is, because we are not so ready to do His will.
If we perform any obedience to his Laws, it is, for the most part, such as
those murmurers did: we offer unto him either the vile, or the lame, or else
but half that which is due: and yet persuade our selves we deal bountifully
with him too. In Fine, we do so much as serves to ground a Pharisaical conceit
of our selves, not so much, or not so sincerely, as may induce Our God, who
knows our hearts, to think well of us; We do not so to him as we desire he
should do to us; for we desire that he should bless us above the ordinary means
of humane forecast or procurement, but we adventure not any practice enjoined
by him further then we see good probability for; whereas, the Honor and Glory
we owe unto Him, as our Father and our King, as the Lord our God, is to hope
above hope, to rely upon his providence that prospers beyond all possibility
of good speed that we know, can foresee or imagine. He that will save his life,
as our Savior says, must resolve to lose it. That is (according to the
equity of this Rule) whosoever desires God to bestow upon him that immortal
and far better Life, must be in heart and mind resolved to resign this mortal
life into his hand, whenever he shall demand it. Oft-times we come to lose
this mortal life it self, by too much chariness or intemperate desires to keep
it. Such as fear death more then See St. Basil de 40. Martyr.
Gods displeasure, oft-times incur both; when as he that neglects all care of
life, by Gods extraordinary mercy and care has his life given him for a prey.
As it is said to Baruch, See the Sermons upon that Text. Chapt. 35, 36.
Jer. 45. 5. Or as it is promised by God in the forecited third of Malachi,
ver. 16. Then spoke they that feared the Lord every one to his neighbor (to
wit, to honor the Lord as he required) and the Lord hearkened and heard it,
and a book of Remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the
Lord, and that thought upon his Name: And they shall be to me, says the Lord
of Hosts, in that day that I shall do this, for a Flock, and I will spare them
as a man spares his own son that serves him. Then shall you return and
discern betwixt the righteous and the wicked, betwixt him that serves God and
him that serves him not.

13. By the equity of the same Rule we gather, that he which desires God
should bless him with extraordinary riches (that is, send him such riches as
shall be a Blessing unto him, for to many they are a curse) must resolve, as
Solomon speaks, to cast his bread upon the waters, to be open, so more
open-handed to the poor, then he can see any probability in humane reason how
it should hold out, referring the issue to God, who will bless us over and
above that we can desire or can procure by ordinary care, so we in sincerity
of heart, not out of vain ostentation, be liberal and bountiful over and above
the Rate of our ordinary means.

If we desire God should send down a secret blessing upon our store, we should
do alms so secret that the left hand should not know what the right hand gave.
He that will honor the Lord with his substance, shall have his Barns filled
with abundance, Prove. 3. 9. And the reason why many a poor man's store is not
extraordinarily increased, as the Sareptan Widows was, is, because, out of
their penury they do not minister to others that are in greater necessity then
themselves; especially to such as are dear in Gods sight, as his Prophets or
Messengers. We may not perhaps desire that God should work such a miracle in
our days, For the manner, but he can and will give as extraordinary increase
by means ordinary, though not usual: For his promise is still the same, First
seek the Kingdom of Heaven and the righteousness thereof, and all those
things, which the world cares for, shall be added unto you.

God blesses not us Ministers with such store of temporal things as we desire,
because we minister not spiritual things to you in such measure as he commands:
And God blesses not you with such store of spiritual instruction as you do or
should desire, because you are backward in ministering temporal things to Gods
Honor.

To conclude, as we must be perfect as God is perfect (though not so perfect as
he is perfect) so must we do to him as we desire he should do to us, though not
in the same measure.

If we desire Glory and Immortality of him, which is the participation of his
Divine Nature, we must first be holy, as He is holy. If we seek for bodily
health, we must use temperance and abstinence in our Diet.

You need not fear as if this Doctrine came near Popery. That we must do that
which is Good, ere we obtain that which we desire of God, is the Doctrine of
Our Church, in the Collect appointed for the fourteenth Sunday after Trinity.

ALmighty and everlasting God, Give unto us the increase of Faith, Hope, and
Charity: And that we may obtain that which thou do promise, make us to love
that which thou do command: (especially make us to love the Great
Commandments of loving Thee, O Lord, above all, with all our hearts, with all
our souls, with all our strength; and our neighbors as our selves:) Through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Third Sermon upon this Text.
CHAP. XXXIV.
MATTHEW. 7. 12. Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do
unto you, do ye even so unto them, etc.
The Impediments that obstruct the Practice of this Duty, of Doing to others
as we would have done to our selves, are chiefly Two 1. Hopes and desires of
attaining better estates then we at present have. 2. Fears of falling into
worse. Two ready Ways to the Duty. 1. To wean our souls into an
Indifferency, or vindicate them into a Liberty in respect of all Objects. 2.
To keep in mind always a perfect Character of our own Afflictions and Releases
or Comforts. Two Inconveniences arising from accersite greatness or prosperity.
1. It makes men defective in performing the Affirmative part of this Duty. 2.
It makes them perform some part of the Affirmative with the violation of the
Negative part thereof. A Fallacy discovered. An useful general Rule.

1. THe Third Point proposed (Chapter 32.. 5.) was, concerning the best means
and method of putting this Rule in Practice. And we shall the sooner find out
These, if we can discover those Impediments which usually either disable or
detain men from doing to others as they would be done unto themselves.

The Original and principal Impediment of this practice, is, because we cannot,
or will not, or do not, sufficiently and impartially propose others men's Cases
as our own. And this false out oft-times, because we are ignorant what our own
desires would be in many Cases; and therefore having no Rule within our selves
we cannot practice This to the behoof of others. It is seen by experience that
such as have the fresh prints or bleeding scarres of any calamity upon
themselves, will be most compassionate to others suffering the like. The Reason
is, These men cannot but propose other men's afflictions as their own; They know
well what they themselves have desired to be done unto them in like calamity:
and according to the full measure of their own desires, arises an Alacrity
and readiness to relieve others. The sight or notification of others men's
miseries, casts them as it were by a Relapse into a Fit of their Own: so, as
they are afflicted whilst others are tormented, and for this Reason are drawn
by Sympathy to do to others, as it has been, or as they desired it should
have been, done to them; to bring themselves out of their present pain.

Thus far nature does lead us without any actual Intention of mind, or
consideration of performing this duty as enjoined us either by the Law of
Nature or of Grace. And if we would, as they say, but let nature work, it would
teach us more particulars of every kind, and how to propose every man's Case
(of like nature) as our own. But such is our natural folly, that we learn not
many of these lessons; but only such as experience teaches us. Herein then is
the difference between the foolish, and men spiritually wise. Experience in the
one sets nature a working. In the other, Reason, assisted by Grace, from one or
two experiments draws general Rules.

2. The impediments which hinder us either in taking a true estimate of our
desires, or performing that to others which we our selves would desire, are
these. Our eager Desires either of being in better estate then we are; or our
Fears of being in worse. These are such sour door-keepers as will not suffer
any other men's desires or notifications of their miseries to enter into our
souls, or to make any impression upon them. If our souls or affections were
neither inclined much this way nor that way, but stood at the Push, The bare
sight of any others affection whether joyful or sad would possess us with the
like. But whilst our souls are fast tied and led captive by some one desire or
other unto some one Object or other (as commodity, pleasure, honor,
advancement or the like,) they cannot easily be drawn any other way. Yea
oft-times the proposal of others miseries, makes souls so affected, cleek the
faster hold; because they apprehend, that to relieve or supply those, would (in
such proportion) lessen and weaken the means of effecting what they desire and
have purposed to effect. Thus if one that has set his soul on riches see his
brother pinched with want and penury, he straight imagines, that poverty is
the mother of misery, and the more he gives, the nearer he shall bring himself
to poverty; and this incires his desire both of increasing and retaining what
he has already got, that so he may be the better fenced against poverty,
which he fears coming upon him as an armed man. If he should part but with a
penny, or some small tribute, he thinks himself quite undone, crying like the
miser in Horace, Quod si comminuas vilem redigatur ad assem.

So likewise the ambitious man if he see one crushed or kept down for want of
means, he is not so much affected with his Case, as seeks to prevent (if it
were possible all possibility of) the like in himself, and so seeking, hales
all to himself, never considering by whose wants his increase of honor shall
arise. If unto these you oppose one that relies upon Gods providence, and
seeks to content himself with what is present, rather then to intertain great
hopes for the future; or one that thinks not, how much better estate then he
many others have, but thanks God it is so well with him, and knows it may be
worse; his mind is easily moved to a fellow-feeling of others calamity,
because it is not fastened to contrary hopes, but stands rather in suspense
and more inclinable to expect a meaner, then to hope for a better estate.

3. The best Method therefore for right practizing of This Rule will be, The
bestmeans to put the duty in practice.
To keep our souls as clear as the apple of our eye; to view all estates, but
not to be dazelled with the glory of any: To Frame our hearts so as they may
take impression from any other man's estate, good or bad, but not to suffer the
desire of any to incorporate in them. For as, when the color of any object is
inherent in the sight, it hinders the impression of all others; so the desire
of any sensible Good, if it be incorporate in our hearts, will hinder us in the
Estimate of far better, and make us unapt to Sympathize with our Brethren. I
may do all things (says St. Paul) but I will not be brought under the power of
any thing; that is, he would so love all sensible good, as upon occasion to be
content to hate it; he would not fasten his desires upon it, for so it should
command him, not he use it. He knew to use the world as if he used it not, he
knew how to abound and how to want. The former Resolution was the Root of those
branches of this Duty; who is weak and I am not weak? who is offended and I
burn not? His preserving himself free, was that which made him as apt to take the
impressions of others affections, as the eye is to take the shapes of visibles.
Hence was it that he could become all unto all, being not in subjection to any
thing: Et mihi res, non me rebus submittere Conor. But we who have not attained
to this liberty of mind, nor can altogether cast off this yoke of servitude,
but have our souls as it were overcharged with many unnecessarie delights and
worldly desires, had so much the more need of counterpoizes to bring them back
to their Aequilibrium, to such a state of Indifferency as may easily be
inclined to compassion.

4. There is no man I think of riper years but has tasted afflictions at one
time or other of diverse kinds; and has been acquainted with comforts Keep an
exact Register or Calendar of our Good and evil days.
of as many. The true Character of both should be thoroughly imprinted in our
minds whilst they are fresh; and daily renewed by meditation or proposal of the
same or like. If we could truly take and so retain the true measure and
estimate either of our grief in calamity or comfort upon Release, These would
serve us as so many Keys or tunes of songs gotten by heart, so as we should no
sooner hear another sound the like Note but presently we should consort with
him: and if his case were mournful we should ease him by participation of his
sorrow, and seek remedy for it as if it were our own. He that never had
experience of calamity, his misery is the greater; and he should do well to
make it the less, by going to the House of mourning. Meditation will work
whatsoever Experience does. Gutta cavat Lapidem etc. Others tears, would we be
much conversant among the mourners, would pierce at length even hearts of stone.

The Former method was that which the Lord himself so often inculcates to the
Israelites, Remember that ye were strangers, etc. He expected that the
remembrance hereof should make them like affected to strangers, and apt to
mourn with them as they had done for themselves, and to afford strangers such
comforts as he had afforded them.

This Precept was five or six times at the least repeated to them. And not only
they that had lived in a strange Land, the Land of Egypt, but their posterity
were bound to celebrate for ever the memorial of their forefathers estate. For
this Reason whilst they reaped Gods benefits in the Land of Promise, they were
to leave somewhat for the poor and for the stranger, as it is expressly
commanded four several times, Lev. 19. 9. and 23. 22. and 25. 3. and Deu. 24. 19


All which Laws are not so far yet abolished, but that we may, upon our
deliverance from any grief, misery, or destruction, consecrate some part of our
goods, endeavors, or employments, to comfort such as are any where visited
with the like, and by the solemnity of such Acts to renew the decaying memory
of Gods mercies toward us: So doing, God will remember us with like mercies
again. But if we suffer his mercy to slip out of our minds, by neglecting our
brethren standing in need of such comfort, we shall cry and not be heard, when
calamity shall come upon us, like the unclean spirit with more then thrice
doubled force.

Surely, either This, or some practice Aequivalent to this; is as necessary to
us as to the Israelites. For we are all subject to that (...), whereof the Lord
so often forewarned Israel. Even such as seem most upright, when
once they wax fat, spurn with the heel, and cast the memories of their
miseries and Gods former mercies behind their Backs. Thou art fat, thou art
gross, thou art laden with fatness, says God to Israel, Deuteronomy. 32. 15.
Therefore he forsook God that made him, and regarded not the strong God of his
salvation. Yet did the Lord look that Israel should have proved upright.

What was the reason that he waxed thus full and fat?

Only because he did not use that Exercise which God appointed to keep him
under, and his heart from being lifted up. Deuteronomy. 8. 11. Take heed, says the
Lord, least when thou have eaten and filled thy self, and have built goodly
houses and dwelt therein, and thy beasts and thy sheep are increased, and thy
silver and thy gold is multiplied; and all that thou have is increased; then
thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee out
of the Land of Egypt; out of the house of Bondage.

The daily and lively Representation or Recognition of this their estate should
have been as usual to them as their meat and drink; yea, as it were, their
thanksgiving before and after meals. Their visitation of others with mercy
and kindness, should have been as a perpetual Homage for their Redemption.
These practices would have kept the Childrens minds at the same equable temper
which their fathers were at, upon their first deliverance. And least any man
should think this people to have been by nature more gross, and so more subject
to this disease, then we our selves are, let us consider how easily all conceit
of former calamity will slip out of our minds without such solemn Recognition
of it.

5. The nature of any Good is better perceived, Carendo quam fruendo. And for
this reason men in adversity can too well remember former prosperity. Thus
the Israelites were no sooner hungry in the wilderness, but fall a longing
after the fleshpots of Egypt. Extremity of want adds so many degrees of
Goodness to things indifferent or scarce tolerable in their kind! What would
their murmurings have been? Or how ill would they have brooked this exchange,
if they had been fed with delicates from Pharaoh's Table? But the nature of any
evil is never thoroughly known but Patiendo. And for this cause, fullness or
prosperity expels the conceit of want, as grosser bodies do Ecclus. 11. 25. 27.
air out of such places as they are infused into: Unless there be a vicissitude
or change, if not laid upon us by the Almighty, yet voluntarily undertaken; by
renouncing the use of what we might enjoy, or by using prosperity as if we used
it not: and sometime in our greatest prosperity by visiting the House of
Mourning, and taking or renewing acquaintance with the Children of Affliction.
Blessed is the Rich, says the Son of Sirach, which is found without blemish,
and has not gone after Gold, which has been tried thereby and found perfect,
etc. Ecclus. 31. 8, etc.

Thus prosperity obliterates all former print or mark of adversity, even in
such as desire no greater things then at present they enjoy; that they cannot
do to others in adversity, as they would be done unto. Because they know not
what the measure of their own desires would be. What men do not actually
apprehend as evil, or are not touched with, they cannot have any desire to
redress in themselves, much less can they relieve or comfort such, of whose
miseries they have no sense, or intelligent consideration. Psalm 41. 1. Beatus
qui intelligit super pauperem.


For these Reasons and others formerly mentioned, those men are more unapt, or
more averse from Commiseration, that are still in chase or pursuit of greater
wealth, honor, or preferment. The putting on of a better Estate puts away all
memory of their own former; and all respect to other men's present miseries:
For when hopes are spedd and delights strong, the good obtained puts, as it
were, a new tincture or die upon the mind.

That these are the natural effects of such as long after growth and promotion,
might easily be proved by Induction, if the enumeration of particulars, which
these our Times have afforded, were safe. It fares so with such men in the
exchange of fortunes or estates, as it does in change of Diet. Such as find
good relish in coursest fare (whilst they be in strait condition) used to a
better, without intermission, though but for some short space, have no taste at
all of the former. And afterward used to a more fine and curious Table, begin
to loath or not to like that which wrought out the Relish of the first; and so
on by degrees until they come to that pass, that they can relish naught but
dainties. So is it with many in our days; who in their younger years could
for the affinity of their fortunes have sympathized with the poorest soul that
goes from door to door; These a little promoted, know not what the petitions of
the poor, mean; they are strangers to their very language: They cannot conceive
what their own desires would be in such an estate. The supposal of such men's
cases for their own, is A Supposition of impossibility. Advanced yet a little
higher, they forget what they late have been; and are now further from taking
notice of any inferior, living in that Rank from which they lately rose, though
their ingenuous Brother, perhaps their better every way (unless we value them
as men do Sheep or Oxen, by the price of money which they are worth) then they
were at their first Rise, from renewing acquaintance with the meanest.

6. The Inconveniences arising from this kind of prosperity be Two great,
inconveniences of wealth and greatness unduly sought.
Two.

First, It causes a great Defect in the performance of the Affirmative part of
this Precept [Do as you would be done to.] They cannot perform it in Christian
sort; that is, with inward alacrity or cheerfulness; but only outwardly and
for fashion sake, unless it be to persons of their own Rank, whose evils and
calamities they can apprehend as their own.

Secondly, which is the worst of evils that can be imagined; whilst they
perform some Branches of the Affirmative Precept, that is, whilst they seek to
pleasure others in their eagre desires of preferment, or such things wherein
they would be pleasured again, they bring a necessity upon themselves of
transgressing the Negative part of this Precept, that is, Of doing that to
others which they would not have done unto themselves, if they were in their
Case. I am persuaded, That the miseries which fall upon the inferior sorts of
men, by the mutual desires of great men to do one to another, as they would be
done unto; (that is, by pleasuring one another in their suites of honor,
preferment, or enlarging their estates;) are more then all that God does
otherwise lay upon them in this life. Many thousands whom God never cursed, are
by these means forced to seek their bread in stony places. And is it possible
that any man can persuade himself? that if he were in such poor men's Cases he
should be well pleased with their dealings, who seek to enlarge their
superfluities by the certain diminishing of other men's necessaries for life?
And yet who is he almost that thinks he does not observe this Precept well
enough, if he be willing to do another man as good a Turn as he expects from
him, although he know not to whose harm it may redound? If no determinate
person, for the present feel the smart, they think Conscience has no cause to
cry. As if God Almighty did not see as well what evil will hereafter ensue as
what is present; and did not punish immoderate desires which necessarily bring
on with them public Calamities, as well as outrageous but private Facts.

7. With this Fallacy, A Dicto secundum quid ad Simpliciter, we usually
deceive our selves in the performance of this Duty. We think it sufficient, to
do as we have been done unto, or if we do to some one or few as we expect See
Fol. 3586.
from them, or as we could desire to be done unto if their Case were ours.
Whereas, we should examine it, not from our affection to This or That man, but
by our Indifferency of receiving and Returning good toward All. Oft-times to
do one man good may be conjoined with some others harm whom we have more reason
to respect. And here we may quickly mistake in the proposal of their Exigence
as our own. If you fulfill the Royal Law according to the Scripture, which
says, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, ye do well, says St. James.
Chap. 2. 4. But if ye regard persons, ye commit sin, and are rebuked of the Law
as Transgressors. The Apostles Discourse in that place, inferres as much as I
have said. And his meaning is, that which our Savior had taught in the Parable
of the Samaritan: That every man, as man, is our neighbor; and therefore this
Duty of loving others as our selves; and doing as we would be done unto, was
to be performed to all alike, without respect of persons; For that which we are
to respect, is, the Exigence of their estate. So much is Formally and
Essentially included in the Duty it self. Not that we may not be more ready to
do good to one man then to another, for this we may do without respect of
Persons. Do good to all, but especially to such as are of the Household of
Faith. The Object of this Duty is man, as man, in his lawful desires. Our love
then or readiness of doing good must be increased, according to the just
exigencies of their desires; where These are equal, our desire of doing good
may be augmented according to particular respects of nearness, etc. as, To a
Christian before a Turk, to an English man before another. For if we must love
others as our selves we must be most ready to respect that in others which we
(in a Regular Way) desire should be most respected in our selves.

Now (next to eternal happiness) life and the necessities thereof we most
respect. And if we stand in danger of losing the one, or suffer want of the
other, we desire that those main Chances (as we say) may be secured before we
begin to hunt after pleasures or superfluities. If then we must Do to all men
as we would be done unto, without respect of persons, that is, excluding none;
we must first relieve the necessities of such as want, and tender the life of
such as are in sickness or danger; and then if occasion require, we may require
or deserve kindnesses in matters of innocuous pleasure, as in feasting,
sporting, furthering men's advancements, or the like. Otherwise, to respect the
pleasuring of a Dear Friend in these, before the Releif of an Enemies
necessities is preposterous and a breach of the Law, Because it is to have
respect of persons.

8. The Rule is General in all Christian duties. Our affections must be
directed to the Adaequate Object (as we term it) and set, not more upon one
part then another, but upon every essential part alike. Or, if any increase of
affection
or liking be to be made, it should always proceed from the increase of some
Exigence essentialy included in the right Motive or Ground of our affection, or
from some Actual Intention of that Quality or Property in some part of the
Object which is the Modus Considerandi, or, which is the allurement or Term of
our desires or affections. Otherwise setting our affections more upon one part
than upon another, for some Extrinsecal or Accidental Reasons not included (as
we say) in modo Considerandi, in the Formal Reason or property of the Object,
the observing of our duty in that part, does usually enforce a Defalcation or
breach of it in some other; just as uneven and irregular zeal to one or some
few Commandments does always produce a dispensing with or neglect of the rest.
Such mixed deeds are like a Linsy-wolsey Garment; or plowing with an Ox and an
Ass yoked: or lowing miscellan.


Ense Thyestaeo poenas exegit Orestes. Orestes, in seeking to Revenge his
Fathers unnatural violent Death, did no otherwise then he himself would have
given the Son of his Body in charge, if he had lain upon his Deathbed. But yet
he ought this honor to his cruel and adulterous Mother, to have let her die at
least by some others Hands; not to have imbrued his own in her blood; not to
have taken life from that body from which he received life. The Poets Censure
of his Fact is accute.

Mixtum cum pietate nefas, dubitandaque Caedis
Gloria maternae laudem cum crimine pensat.
A righteous man, says Solomon is merciful to his beast; but the mercies of
the wicked are cruel.

Pity upon dumb beasts is commanded in the Law (especially to such as do man
service:) And he that is merciful unto them upon a true respect, in as much as
they are partakers with us of Life and sense, and communicate with us in our
more general nature, will be more merciful unto man his fellowcreature; but
much more unto his brother in Christ; most of all to his fellow members in any
civil and Christian Society: For all these are included essentially in the
Object of this duty, of loving our neighbor as our selves. These are nearer
bonds of brotherhood and neigborhood: and the more such bonds we have, the more
we are Neighbors.

9. The modern Turks are very observant of this Rule of Solomon in one part,
for no man was ever more merciful to his beast then they are to some domestic
creatures; but not upon such motives, or considerations as are directly
contained in the complete Object of true pity and mercy: See Chap. 29, 9.
Fol. 3586.
for they are so folishly affectionate to Dogs, that for a small harm done to
them, they will not stick to kill an honest man: such cruelty is in their
mercy: It may justly be denominated from the Object, A dogged pity.

These Rules or Caveats (Beloved in our Lord) First, Of respecting the
Exigencies of men's lawful desires; Secondly, Of not doing to some one man as we
would have done to us without consideration what may befall another which we
would not have befall us; This again, Of doing according to the Essential
grounds or motives of performing this duty: As they concern all (for enlarging
the affections, and directing any Readiness to do good to others) so do they
most of all concern such as have the oversight of our souls; such as are put in
trust with the dispensation of the good things belonging thereto, amongst such
as have a common right to them. They especially should have a care that they do
not more affect One then another, in bestowing of any public Favors, but
according to the Exigence of their estates, or according to their obedience and
performance of the public constitutions by which they live. As this concerns
all such Societies, so most I suppose this was preached at St. Ma. in Oxon.
of all, Societies of Students. For such as are given to Attick studies, are
usually subject to Attick affections; Qui vult ingenio cedere rarus erit. Every
excess of favors in such Cases, is a Testimony of excess of worth, in those
things wherein they can hardliest brook comparisons. Hence,

-- Manet alta mente repostum
Judicium Paridis spretaeque injuria formae.
As the wound is deep and grievous, so is it very dangerous in such as live
daily together in one house, and meet at one dish: for living apart the wound
might quickly close, and heal without a skar; whilst the sight of his Aemulus
or competitor, does rub and grate upon his sore, and causes such bitter
Exulcerations, as often bewray their inward grief or disdaign in outward
gestures: yea oft-times I am afraid have caused His wounds to bleed a fresh by
whose stripes we were healed, and by whose blood which was shed for us we hope
to be cleansed.

Those persons who are of this disposiition must needs be entreated to study
moderation of Desires; and to think of others better then their selves, at
least of such as are in place before them. And you that are in place of
Authority, unto whose care and trust the dispensation of the good things of
this place are left, let me in the Bowels of Christ Jesus beseech you (even as
you will answer it at the last day) not to have the Faith of our glorious Lord
Jesus Christ in respect of persons. I speack chiefly to the sons of Levi: Let
me beseech you (for a Close) to remember what was our father Levi his praise;
or rather what the Commendation of his Function in the Abstract; what was the
Foundation of his Peace; the Ground of Gods Covenant of mercy and long life
with him; was it not this? as Moses tells us, Deuteronomy. 33. 9. He said unto his
father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither knew he his brethren,
nor acknowledged his own children: for they observed thy word O Lord and kept
thy Covenant.

They shall teach Jacob thy Judgments and Israel thy Law. They shall put
incense before thy face and the Burnt-offering upon thine Altar.

Lord! Let thine Urim and thy Thummim be still with thine Holy one. Bless O
Lord his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the Loins
of them that rise against him and of them that hate him that they rise not
again.

Amen.
The Former Sermon upon this Text.
CHAP. XXXV.
JEREM. 45. v. 2. Thus says the Lord -- unto thee O Baruch, Verse 3. Thou
did say, woe is me now! for the Lord has added grief to my sorrow: I fainted
in my sighing and find no rest. Verse 4. Thus shall thou say unto him --,
Behold that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted
will I pluck up, even this whole Land. Verse 5. And seek Thou great things
for thy self! seek them not: For behold I will bring evil upon all Flesh, says
the Lord: But thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither
thou go.
Little and Great, Terms of Relation. Two Doctrines. One Corollarie. Times and
occasions alter the nature of Things otherwise Lawful. Good men should take the
help of The Antiperistasis of bad times to make themselves Better. Sympathy
with others in misery, enjoined in Scripture; practiced by Heathens: Argia,
and Portia. The Corollarie proved by Instance, and That made the Application of
the Former doctrine.

1. IT is as true in matter of desire, as in materials subject to sight, or
other bodily sense; Magnum aut parvum non dicitur, nisi cum respectu. The
different bounds of Great and Little cannot be determined but by their Nothing
is called Little or great but in Comparison with other things.
References; The least body that is, is not little in respect of the several
parts, whereinto it may be divided. No Part can be said Great, in respect of
the whole, whence it is taken. Of the largest Country in Europe we may say;
Quota pars terrarum? Little England is a competent style for our native Country
compared with France, Spain, or Germany. And yet Armorica with reference to
England is truly instiled Little Britain. Within the less of these two
Provinces, it would be matter of no long search to find Huge Mole-hils, and
such petty hills as cannot deserve the name of Mountains.

And in the Revolutions of times, the exigence of some peculiar seasons may
truly argue Extraordinary favors in ordinary Gifts; large bounties in small
Donatives: yea great excess as well in the matter as in the manner of such
desires, as at other times would come short of mediocritie.

For a man descended, and qualified so well as Baruch (to whom this message was
here directed) to set up his staff at a Levites lodging door, resolved to live
contented with a poor bed, a stool, and a Candlestick in a corner of some
Country village; may with Reference to modern Practices seem to argue rather
great moderation of desires, then any immoderate desire of great matters. But
such are the streights, whereinto Jerusalem, and Juda his native Country, now
are brought; That to use the whole Latitude of his lawful wonted liberties,
were to transgress the bounds of Religious discretion; yea, to outrage in
licentiousness. So heavy were the burdens, which the Lord had laid upon the
mothers neck, that for her best born sons not to stoop at her dejection,
bewrayes in them a stubborn spirit of untimely ambition.

2. The least quantity of food that could be assigned, was more then this
people might lawfully take during the time of their solemn fasts. And the Lev.
23. 27.
meanest external contentments, which Baruch at this instant could affect, must
needs be deemed A great matter, because too much in these days of public
sorrow and discomfort. All he sought for, was to be freed from the danger,
disgrace, and scorn of Great Ones, in whom he saw matter, store, of Just
reproof, but little hope of amendment. And who will be forward to procure his
own harm, by free speeches, without probability of doing others good? Baruch
had once adventured to read all the Woes of this Prophecy in a solemn assembly
of all sorts; A task, which with fair pretense of conscience might easily have
been avoided by him; If reading the word of God (as he found it penned by
others) might in no Case go for preaching. Unless the Lord had hid them; he for
reading, and Jeremy for indicting;
had been used, perhaps, as the Roll was, wherein this burden was written. Now
the Roll, Jehoiakim King of Judah did cut with his penknife, and after cast it
into the fire till it was consumed. Jeremie 36. 23. But though the paper were
subject to the flame; as Christ's body (to use Theodorets application of this
Type) was unto death: yet the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is
the word of the Lord, which came to Jeremy, and which Baruch was to preach
(after the King had burnt the Roll and the words, which Baruch wrote at the
mouth of Jeremie:) Take again another roll, and write in it all the former
words, that were in the first roll, which Iehoiakim the King of Judah burnt.

And thou shall say to Jehoiakim the King of Judah; Thus says the Lord; Thou
have burnt this roll, saying: why have thou written therein saying, that the
King of Babel shall certainly come; and destroy this land and shall take thence
both man and beast? etc.

3. Baruch's late persecution, and hard escape (for being the imprisond
prophets The occasion of Baruchs complaint.
hand and mouth, in notifying the Contents of the former Rolls unto Prince and
People) might well make him shrink at writing or preaching this latter (being
purposely replenished with the addition of many like words to the former)
because more personally directed to Jehoiakim.

Out of the abundance either of grief and sorrow during the time of his
Latitation from the Kings Inquisitors, or out of present fear least the Tyrants
rage might be enlarged against him for undertaking this second Charge imposed
upon him by Jeremy; or (as it is likely) upon both occasions, did he utter
those Complaints registered in the third verse of this Chapter. Woe is me now!
for the Lord has laid sorrow unto my sorrow: I fainted in my mourning, and I
can find no rest.

But why should it grieve him not to find, what the Lord had commanded him not
to seek? for this is the Tenor of the message, which Jeremy was to deliver unto
him: The Lord says thus. Behold that, which I have built, will I destroy: and
that which I have planted, will I pluck up, even this whole Land. And seek
thou great things for thy self? Seek them not, etc.

4. The sum of what I principally have, or would have, observed out of the
words of this Text, may be comprised in these Two Propositions. Two Doctrines,
or two Propositions.


1. The desire of a faithful man, specially of a public Minister, must always
be suited to the condition of the times wherein, and of the parties with whom
he lives.

2. In times of public calamity, or desolation, the bare Donative of life and
liberty is a privilege more to be esteemed, then the prerogative of Princes.
Or in other Terms, thus. Exemption from general plagues, is more then a full
recompense for all the grievances, which attend our ministerial charge, or
service in denouncing them.

Unto the Former, (the truth of whose Doctrine must be the principal subject A
Corollarie added to the former.
of my present meditations) I shall add or annex this Useful Corollarie. As the
intemperate desire of mirth, of pleasure, or preferment, in the days of
public Calamity is in every private man preposterous: So where the humor is
general, it is the usual Symptom of a forlorn or dying state, or fearful sign
that God has forsaken the land, and people wherein it reigns. Seek thou
great things for thy self? Seek them not, etc.

What were the great things which Baruch sought? Excessive pleasure, wealth or
honor? Any positive delight more then ordinary, or solace greater, then could
agree with his calling? Any exemption from tax, or trouble common to all? The
principal, if not the only fault, for which he was taxed by the Prophet, was,
his untimely desire of ordinary ease, of freedom from extraordinary and
thankless pains in service distastful to the present State, and therefore
dangerous.

Did ever the austerest Founder of most superstitious strict Orders, tie their
Followers to a more rigid Rule then Baruch here is bound unto? The Predicant or
begging Friar may interpret his ministerial Commission in the strictest sense;
He does not ride, but go as bare footed as he was born, to Preach the Gospel
unto every Creature under heaven (unto stocks and stones, as St. Francis his
Father, they say, has fondly taught him.) But unto which of them was it by
Rule of Founder enjoined? Or what monkish Votary did ever voluntarily undertake
to proclaim Romes final desolation in St. Peter's Church in the year of Jubily?
Or menace downfall to red Hats, and the triple Crown in the Consistory? Yet all
together such, no easier was the task which Jeremy had enjoined Baruch.

Was this Injunction then given him by way of Counsel, or necessary Precept?
Did he super-erogate ought in undertaking? Or had he not grievously sinned in
refusing this necessary (but hard and dangerous) service? Surely a Necessity
(not from the General Law, but from the particular Circumstances of the time)
was laid upon him, and a Woe had followed it, if he had not read the Prophet
Jeremies Prophecy. The Scholar was not greater then Things indifferent, yea
lawful things, by Circumstances become unlawful.
his Master, nor his liberty more; Both their liberties were alike great, yet
both subordinate, both subject to the diversity of times and seasons. Both
were free in their persons, both free in their actions, and choice of life: yet
both absolutely bound to walk as they were called.

5. Had not Jeremy as good authority as Isaiah and his fellow Prophets had, to
have taken a Wife of the Daughters of his people? Doubtless the Law was one to
Both, and Matrimony alike lawful to Both; What then did restrain Jeremy of that
liberty, which Isaiah used? Nothing but instant necessity (which knows no Law)
could make the use of the Law, unlawful to him; because most unexpedient for
the present. So the Lord had said, Jerem. 16. 9. Behold I will cause to cease
out of this place in your eyes, even in your days, the voice of mirth, and the
voice of gladness; the voice of the Bridegroom and the voice of the Bride. And
seeing the Lord at this time had determined not to pipe unto this people;
Jeremy had greatly offended, if he had been taken in their marriage Dances. He
knew Children were an heritage, which comes from the Lord; that the fruit of
the womb was his reward; and that in the multitude of sons was store of
blessings; Marriage he knew to be honorable amongst all, but at this time
unseasonable for him. Good seed is well sown when it is likely the Crop may
stand, and prosper. He planteth well, that plants in hope to reap the fruits of
his own Labors. But who sowes wheat, unto the winter floods? or plants a
vineyard for his fuel? why then should Jeremy at this time become an Husband to
beget Sons unto the sword? Or take a Wife to bring forth Daughters to
destruction? To this purpose the Lord had inhibited Jeremy in particular; (But
the Reason of the inhibition in like times is perpetually General:) Yhou shall
not take thee a Wife, nor have Sons nor Daughters in this place, For thus
says the Lord concerning the Sons and concerning the Daughters that are born
in this place, and concerning their Mothers, that bear them, and concerning
their fathers that beget them in this Land. They shall die of grievous deaths
and diseases, they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but
they shall be as dung upon the earth; and they shall be consumed by the sword,
and by famine, and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and
for the beasts of the earth, Ier. 16. 1. The Prophets and sweet singers of
Jerusalem and Judah, had sometimes brought them such joyful Ambassages of their
espousals unto their God: Their Princes and people, had formerly known such
happy days, of joy, security, and peace, that for Jeremy and Baruch to have
then affected this rigid course of life, which now they follow, would have been
but as the taking up of a sad or doleful Madrigall at a marriage feast, or as
the acting of some ominous direful Tragedy upon a Coronation day. But seeing
the glory is now departing from Israel, the Bridegroom leaving their coasts,
and their mother, whom the Lord had once betrothed unto himself in surest bonds
of dearest love, stands liable to the sentence of final divorce; The Children
of the Bride-chamber (specially Jeremiah and Baruch) must betake themselves to
fasting, prayer, and mourning. Now to have used their wonted solace, mirth, or
feasting, would have been all one, as if the one had piped, the other had
danced (a wanton Jigge or Corranto) in the Solemnities of their mothers
Funerals; or as if they had marched together in a morisce-dance over their
fathers Grave. He means some man that had turned to the Church of Rome.


6. Had that late Fugitive, or other his Fellow Postillers, learned thus to
distinguish times and seasons: The supposed difference between Precepts
necessary to all, and Evangelical Counsels peculiar to such as aim at
Extraordinary perfection; would clearly appear to be but a Dream or
imagination, which has no root but ignorance. Their error perhaps may thus be
rectified, if to discover the Original thereof, be enough to rectify it.

Many Divine Precepts there be, from whose absolute and sovereign Necessity,
no powers on earth can plead exemption: and yet the practices enjoined by them
are neither necessary to all, nor expedient for any, at sometimes or in some
places: Because the Precepts themselves may be Disjunctive, or opposite
branches of some more General Mandate. It will not follow, This or That man in
former Ages has done many Good works pleasant, and acceptable unto God, such
as not the godliest man living is bound at this time to do, Ergo he did
supererogate in doing them, that is, in plain English, he did more then he was
bound to do. For though (rebus sic stantibus) no man be bound: yet every man
(say we) stands bound by the Eternal, and unchangeable Law of God to do the
like: as often as the same external occasions shall be offered; or the like
internal suggestions be made unto him by The signs of the Times, or
disposition of Gods providence. But here, By the Eternal Law of God we are not
bound to understand only the Ten Commandments: The Decalogue (if without
offense, Gods Words may be so compared) contains only the Praedicamental Rules,
or Precepts of the eternal Law. Other divine precepts there be more
Transcendental, which have the same Use in matters of Christian practice or
true Observation of the ten Commandments, as General maxims have in particular
Sciences. Such a Precept in respect of the second Table is that; Love thy
neighbor as thy self. By this precept, every man stands necessarily bound to
perform more then ordinary Charity toward his neighbor, as often as his
neighbors occasions to use his charitable help are more then ordinary.

The same Use in respect of both the Tables has that other Precept; Whatsoever
ye would have done to you, so do ye to others. Most General likewise and most
indispensable are these Two mandates: Let every man walk as he is called. Time
must be redeemed, when days are evil. And seeing the inhabitants of every
Country stand bound Jointly and severally to glorify God by due observation of
his Commandments: The more licentiously others violate any Good men are, and
ought to be most religious in worst Times.
one, or more negative precepts: his Children always know themselves tied in
conscience to so much more strickt observance of the contrary Affirmatives,
which are always understood in the Negative. The measure of their sobriety,
and devotion must be taken from others excess in Luxury and profaneness.

Briefly; the prohibitions, or injunctions expressly contained in the Decalogue,
or others parts of the moral Law, describe the General bounds or limits,
without which we may not, within which we must, continually walk. Our
observation of Gods Providence and signs of the times will best direct us to
such particulars within those Limits, as are most expedient for the present.
The several exigence of every season, and the necessity and conditions of the
parties with whom we live, will notify the definite measure or exact quantity
of such good offices, or performances, as the eternal Law requires of us.

To be well instructed what is most fitting for the season, every man must ask
counsel of his own heart; but after his heart, examined by the Rules of the
eternal Law, has informed him what is fit and expedient, it is no matter of
Counsel, but of necessary Precept to do it; and that in such measure, as the
Exigence of time, of place; and persons require; Albeit others, which have not
had the like occasions to consult their own hearts, be not bound to do the
like. And some (it may be) of better Note, then is fitting for us to censure
nominatim have been induced to mistake such necessary performances, as are not
usually undertaken without precedent consultation of men's own hearts, for
matter of Counsel, not of Precept.

7. Subordinate to those general Precepts, [Do as ye would be done unto: Let
every man walk as he is called:] are these disjunctive Precepts of the Apostle,
Romans 12. 15. Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Both
these precepts are necessary, both most necessary in their time, and place;
neither necessary at all times and in all places, for they are incompatible.
Hence says Solomon Eccles. 3. 4. There is a time to weep and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn and a time to dance; So then weeping and laughing, mourning and
dancing, are both in their several turns, or seasons expedient; but weeping and
mourning most suitable to the occasions of most times, and more expedient for
most persons. For it is better to go into the house of mourning, then into the
house of Mirth. Men seldom mourn without just occasions, and few men, but often
have just occasions to mourn: But many laugh when they have just cause to
lament; And to consort with such in this their folly, were extreme impiety;
especially in such as Jeremy and Baruch were; in all that are Overseers, or
Watchmen over Gods flock; This made the Prophet Jeremy, Chap. 9. 1. to wish, O
that mine head were full of water, and mine eyes fountains of tears, that I
might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.

Thus wished Jeremy even whilst Jerusalem went mad in mirth and Jollity, whilst
her children were bold and audacious to hold on more then an ordinary Pace in
their wonted courses from evil to worse; because they were blind and ignorant,
and would not see the day of their visitation drawing on. To men therefore
endued with reason (more especially to Christian men; amongst them, most
especially to the Preacher and Pastor, who have Christ Jesus and the Prophets
for their pattern) the Precept is all one; To mourn with them that mourn, and
to mourn for them, whose Case is mournful, Though happily not so apprehended by
them; such as Jerusalems Case was, when our Savior beheld it and wept, saying;
O that thou had known at the least in this thy day, those things, which
belong unto thy peace, but now are they hid from thine eyes. etc. Luke the 19.
42. As also at this time, when this message came to Baruch.

8. So natural is this precept of the Apostle; weep with them that weep; that
even bruit beasts, to whom God has given neither speech nor Language, nor
understanding to perceive the words of the wise, or the exhortation of the
eloquent, are yet so intelligent, so apprehensive of the vocal signs or
Sympathy planted in Bruites.
significations of grief uttered from others of their own kind; that they may
well seem to bear the Emblem of St. Paul's Practice engraven in their nature:
Who is weak (says the blessed Apostle 2 Corinthians. 2. 29.) and I am not weak?
who is offended and I burn not? For what beast of the field shall groan and
others of the same kind are not upon the hearing, like affected? which of them
pants for pain or want of breath; and others at this spectacle stand not
amazed either bereft of all motion, or else tortured with like? He that Created
all things, in number, weight, and due proportion, has mutually framed their
hearts to others groans, and sighs, as a stringed instrument to a voice
Unison. So doubtless were our hearts set in our first Creation, All in just
proportion to their maker; our voices were consonant to his word, our
affections conformable to his will, all Unisons amongst themselves. Until the
Rector of this Quire, that should have taken up this everlasting song, did
strain too high; polluting our nature, and corrupting our instruments of breath
(ordained only to have sounded out praises to our God) by eating of that
poisonous apple. Since which time the best of our voices have been harsh and
unpleasant in their makers ears; And besides the harshness of every one in
particular; we have always sung out of tune, perpetually Jarring among our
selves; whilst one has sung, another cried; whilst one mourns another pipes,
or dances for Joy. Yet does the mutual bond of our affections remain still
greater, then any bond amongst beasts; we have this consort set out unto us in

Fol. 3610.


part of which we are bound to obey; This is the sum of the Prophets writings;
each period whereof we are bound to believe. What music can be more pleasant
to a pensive heart; then to have others bear a full consort with him in grief?
Herein then, we do not only omit A Precept of Christ, but directly violate Gods
eternal Law, yea the very Prime Fundamental Law of nature, in that we do not
Sympathize with others, in such sort as we desire they should do with us in
like distress; in that we minister not comfort to others with as great
alacrity, and delight, as we desire to receive it from them. Nature teaches,
and Gods Law commands, to mourn with them that mourn; and the Necessity of
such as mourn, and the true unpartial estimate of our own desires of comfort in
like Case, will give us the exact measure of our mourning.

Our mourning is then truly harmonical, when it is for the Quality, sincere,
and for the Quantity, rightly proportiond unto the present necessity of
times, places, or persons. And on the contrary, then we walk (as the Scripture
speaks) with a heart and a heart, and use a deceitful balance, when our hearts
are open to receive comfort or benefit from others, and shut or straightened, to
return the like; or when we receive any of these from God or man with our whole
heart, and either repay to the same parties from whom we had them, or
distribute them to others, with a faint or fained heart, without
such delight or joy in doing them good, as we take in having good done unto
us. This Eternal Rule of Equity was Transcendent, unto that particular strict
Command, so often inculcated to the Israelites when they came into the good
Land of Promise: viz. Not to forget the stranger that lived amongst them.

The positive precept aimed at through this negative, as the End, or scope, was
the Cheerful relief of the poor stranger; and the immediate Means unto this
End, was always to remember that they themselves had been strangers in the Land
of Egypt; Now to remember that they themselves had been strangers is (in the
language of the holy Spirit) still to retain the perfect estimate of their
former grief, whilst they were strangers: to be able continually to sound the
depth of their own misery, that it might serve as a Key to tune their hearts in
just and full consort to the miserable. They did then truly remember the
strangers, that were within their gates, when they sorrowed in the same manner
for them, as they had done for themselves: when the delight and joy that they
had taken in their own deliverance from servitude and thraldom, was made the
measure of their delight, and joy, in freeing others from the yoke of
servitude, in relieving the poor distressed stranger that sojourned with them.
True compassion is but a fellow feeling of others miseries: And then only are
we truly compassionate when their miseries are made ours: when (as the Apostle
says) we are weakened at their weakness, and burn at their offense, or
grievance. Once thus affected, in easing them, we ease our selves; their
comfort becomes our comfort: whence arises our cheerfulness and sincerity in
doing good; for now we do unto them as we desire they should do unto us: Yea,
even as we would do unto our selves; seeing the only way to case our selves of
this present grief, which is by Sympathy in us, is by curing the Protopathie
in them. This is equity and righteousness in the sight of God, when we afford
comfort unto others, according to the same measure we our selves would receive
it from others: or when we distribute Gods benefits with the like Joy to our
fellow servants, as we receive them from him: Delight in receiving and delight
in doing good, ought to be so fully reciprocal in nature and quantity, that
they should differ but as via Thebis Athenas, and Athenis, Thebas; or as two
times three, and three times two. This is (as the wise man speaks) truly to
keep the heart, when we keep it still in this Aequilibrio, not more inclined to
accept, then to afford a blessing; not more prone to rejoice at our own good,
then to sorrow at others harms; Not more apt to be elevated with our own
promotion, then to be depressed by others undeserved dejection, or discomfort.
And albeit we were able to frame the whole course of our lives fully parallel
to this straight Rule; yet should we still remain unprofitable servants and
altogether unable to supererogate. All actual, or purposed swerving whether
directly or indirectly from this Level, is a declining to hypocrisy. He that
cannot contract his ordinary liberty in the use of things pleasant or
profitable for this life, according to the Exigence or Aboading of the instant
season, or does not labor so to frame and settle the habitual bent of his
affections, as they may be alike free and apt to be moved with sad occurences,
as with occasions of joy: such a man may happily often joy in his courses, but
his rejoicing cannot
be in the Lord; his laughter is madness, his choicest recreation, folly;
dissimulation harbors in his heart, mischief is companion of his thoughts;
the issue of his untimely mirth, is grief and sorrow everlasting.

9. But here I know it will be replied, that this constitution of mind is in
these latter times more rare, then absolute Complexion in men's bodies, or
mixture ad pondus in bodies natural. The Replication perhaps is true, but true
especially for this reason, that every man seeks great things, greater then
Baruch here did, for himself; And hearts stretched by desires unseasonably
superfluous or exorbitant, to an higher strain, then is fitting, can hold no
consort with their humbled brethrens affections; They can neither be brought to
any true Consonancie with the times wherein they live, nor with their own
Callings.

Howbeit we require not such an exact or absolute temper of man's heart as our
Creator framed in our first Parents. That was the Pattern, by which we must
direct our practice; If our intention to imitate this pattern, be sincere; And
our endeavors to accomplish our intentions industrious and entire; whatsoever
is wanting to our ability, The super-excellencie of Christ's righteousness, and
merits (far exceeding our first Parents worth) shall abundantly supply in us,
which were first the natural Sons of Adam, then degenerate Sons of the living
God, now regenerate by Grace, and adopted Sons in Christ. But the experience of
others temper in former times (though Adams Children as now we are, or once
were) bewrayes the Complexion of our Age to be deeply tainted with hypocrisy.
For this I have found (and every one may find without curious search) that the
very sight, remembrance, or rehearsal of others miseries united by the bond of
Common duty, has brought the minds of such, as have bent their ears to
natures discipline, or been well instructed in Civilitie, unto a perfect
sympathy, with as great facility, as men tune their voices to others pleasant
songs, or fashion their bodily motions to others music.

Apathie or want of Fellow-feeling (to speak indifferently) is no natural
property, Apathie, a Symptom of a graceless obdurate mind.
of the mere natural, or unregenerate man; but rather a symptom of a graceless
mind, obdurate with self-pleasing humors and desires: Of hearts truly
mollified, with a mutual touch (though but of moral or civil Love) one takes
the impression of another woe or grief, as easily as softened wax does the
seal.

Thus the fresh memory of the Camp, the consideration of the Ark of God, and
Isreal's and Joabs lying abroad in the fields, makes honest Uriah (joined with
them in the common link of military life; though far dis-joyned in Numb. 32. 6.
2 Samuel 11.
place) abjure with double oath the solace of his lawful bed.

Thus the remembrance of our Saviors humiliation in Jerusalem makes Uriah.
that Noble Duke of Bulloign, many hundred years after, refuse to wear a golden
Crown in that City, though but the lawful Guerdon of his Heroic worth; Godfrey
of Bulloign.
an honor well befitting his person, but not the place, wherein his Lord
Redeemer (under whose banner he fought) had been anointed King with his own
blood, shed by the impression of a Crown of Thorns.

Are the true paterns of those practices extant only in the book of Grace? Or
are the practices recorded only in sacred Story, or of Christians, or sacred
Persons only? Or have not Heathen Poets, which knew no Law besides the Laws of
Nature, and their Rules of Art, exactly painted the like paterns? Have not
heathen Histories, whose veracity is no way liable to just suspicion, related
the like real practices of Heathen persons? Argia in Statius.


Non haec apta mihi nitidis ornatibus (inquit)
Tempora, nec miserae placeant insignia formae.
Thebaidos Libro 4.
It is the Poetical Character or speech of the Noble Princess, uttered rather
out of fear, then certain foresight of the mishap that might befall her Husb^d
now setting forth unto the Thebane war in hope to recover his supposed right.
As the Reason of her refusing Harmonia's Chain (that was the insignia or
ornament offered her by way of gratification for gracing or furthering the
present consultation of war) was much what the same with Duke Godfreys
refusal of the Golden Crown: So the Manner of her abjuring it, was not unlike
Uriah's Oath.

Scilicet, heu superi! cum tu cludare minaci
Casside, ferratusque sons; Ego divitis Aurum
Harmoniae dotale geram?
It was a dishonor (in her esteem) to be disclaimed by an Imprecation, for a
Princes Daughter to adorn her head, and neck, with costly Jewels like a Bride,
whilst her Husband was clad in steel; and yet, so clad, every hour in peril of
life. During the time of this his danger abroad; she desires no greater train
at home, then would suffice to expel Melancholic fear; And that artire does
please her best, which best suited with her pensive heart, most likely to move
her Gods to Commiseration of her widdowhood. For such costly ornaments, as were
now profferd, she thought a fitter time would be to wear them, when her Husband
returned in peace with such rich spoils from the enemies Court; And in this
Resolution well fitting her present estate; she leaves them to the proud
upstart insolent baggage, whose longing desires after those unseasonable
fooleries had enchanted the poor Prophet her husband to Countenance an Ominous
unfortunate war, the issue whereof was this; that after most of the Noble
Argives, sent thither by the enemies sword, the Prophet himself went quick down
to hell.

This Conclusion you will say is false in the litteral sense, or rather fained;
but, I would to God the Fiction were not too true an Emblem of the most
State-Prophets in later Ages. Such as are here represented, and no better, are
the usual fruits of untimely desires, or discording appetites of parties united
in strict bond of common duty, especially in men consecrated to public
ministry. Always they are displeasing to God, in nature preposterous,
hateful as death to civil and ingenuous minds.

10. But herein the Poet, (as the Philosopher well observes) exceeds the
Historian, for moral instructions. He may paint men and women, as they should
be not as they are; whereas the Historian must express them as he finds them.
Most Women indeed are not for their affections like this Poetical Picture of
Argia. Yet the Carriage of Portia, as the ingenious Historian has expressed it,
Of Portia see Plutarch in vita Bruti.
did far exceed it; When her Husband Brutus had disclosed that inward grief
and perplexity, by his ill rest by night, which he had purposely concealed
from her in his waking thoughts, she takes his Concealment, as a disparagement
to her birth and education, and as a tacit impeachment of her honesty. Brutus
(says she) I had Cato to my Father, and was matched into thy family, not as a
whore, to be thy Companion only at bed and board, but (...), to be as true a
Consort of thy miseries as of thy welfare. I had never cause to complain of thy
usage, no occasion to suspect thy loving affection toward me; but what
assurance can thou have of my love to thee? If I may not be permitted to
sympathize with thee in thy secret grief; nor bear a part in those anxieties,
whose communication might ease thy mind, and much set forth my fidelity? I
know well the imbecility of our Sex; we need no rack to wrest a secret from
us. (...); But know (O Brutus) that there is a secret virtue in good parentage,
ingenuous breeding and conversation, for settling, and strengthening the frame
of our affections, even where they are by nature brickle and unconstant. And
this is my portion in these Pre-eminences; A woman I am by sex, but Cato his
Daughter, and Brutus his Wife. To give him a sure experiment (answerable to
these Protestations) how ready she could be in all misfortunes to take grief
and sorrow at as low a Note, as for his life he could: She had cast her self
into a burning Fever by a grievous wound of her own making, before she vented
the former complaint, which she uttered, (...), in the extremity of her Fit or
pangs. I may truly here apply that verse of old Ennius, as the late
extinguished Lamp of this University once out of this Lantern in another Case,
did. Vos Juvenes (shall I say?) nay verily; Nos viri, Patres and Fratres,
animos gerimus muliebres; Illaque Virgo viri.

Was this praeeminency (that she was Cato's daughter, and Brutus's wife) of
power sufficient to arm her female heart with man-like resolution, and true
heroical constancy to bear the yoke of all misfortunes with her Conjugal Mate,
and is it no Praerogative in Christian men, before a Heathen woman, that they
have God for their father, and holy Church for their mother: Christ Jesus
supreme Governor of the world, the Lord of life, and Conqueror of Death and
Hell, for their Brother? Is Baptism into his death but a naked name; that our
professed unity therein cannot unite our hearts in like affections? Is the
effusion of Gods spirit but as the sprinkling of Court Holy Water? are our
daily Sermons but as so many Bevers of wind, whose efficacy vanishes with the
breath that utters them? or has the frequent participation of Christ
precious body and blood no better operation on our hearts, then the exhalation
of sweet odours upon our brains? Be they no longer comfortable, then whilst
they be in taking? Are all those glorious similitudes of one head and many
members, of one Vine and many branches, but Hyperbolical Metaphors? Is our
mystical union only a mere Mathematical imagination? are those or the like
Praerogatives of our calling, but like the Soloecisms of the Romish Church,
matters of mere title, or ceremony, without realitie? Beloved in Christ! if
either we actually were, or heartily desired, or truly meant to be true
branches of that Celestial Vine; were it possible the strongest boughs
thereof should be so often shaken, with dangerous blasts of temptations; and we
no whit therewith moved? could so many flourishing Boughs daily fade, and we
hope that our Luxuriant branches should always flourish? should their goodly
leaves hourly fall, and we live still as if we never looked for any winter? or
should God so often threaten to pluck up the vineyard, which his own right hand
has planted; and yet the dressers of it still seek after great things, for
themselves, as if they never dreamt of dispossession? would the most of us
either seek to raise our selves as high as the highest room in the Lords house;
or make it a chief part of our care how to forecast mispense of time in
merriment, gameing, or other worldly pleasures, or contentments, whilst sundry
of our poor brethren, and fellow Prophets (perhaps in worth our betters) die of
discontent; whilst others younger run mad after riot abroad, least they should
be attached by sorrow and grief at home; whilst other begin to expect a change,
and entertain a liking of Romish Proffers.

Others, which have ever hated Rome more then death, begin to loath their
lives, and set their longing on the Grave; desirous to give their bodies to be
devoured by that earth, which has not ministered necessary sustenance to them;
as being overcharged with maintaining the unnecessary desires and superfluous
pleasures of worse deservers. Or would so many (were they true members of
Christ) suffer that flock, which he has purchased with his precious blood to
starve for want of spiritual Food: That flock, from which they have reap't
carnal Commodities in greatest plenty?

But here I will not dispute whether Non-Residence, or Plurality be simply
unlawful: suppose in former times both had been lawful, both necessary, when
the greatest scarcity was of Scholars sufficiently qualified for the ministry.
Is it therefore Now as expedient? It had been once more lawful for Baruch to
have sought the Ease of a retired life, then ever it was for any man to trouble
himself with joining house to house, Land to Land, or Church to Church. But now
it is unlawful: seek thou great things for thy self? Yet what was his
seeking to theirs? or what are many of their deserts to his? Theirs especially,
who have scarce been so much as scribes to a learned Prophet, scarce ever
brought up in Jerusalem at any Gamaliels feet? but only came to this our Sion
as so many spies, to find out the weakness of the place, to discover by what
devices good Statutes might be frustrate, and means made for conferring degrees
upon Drones. And Drones having once gotten A degree or place in this Bee-hive
by others perjury; will make shift to get spiritual preferment by their own.
After, unto their Titles in the Schools they have gotten an Ite Praedicate from
the Generals of our spiritual warfare, they make their entrance into the Church
of Christ, just so, as if it were into the Enemies soil: once enabled to
compass a convenient Seat, they never think they were placed there as laborers
in Christ's harvest, to gather and break the bread of life to his people; they
only use it as a Fort or Sconce to gather strength in, till they can watch an
opportunity for expugning a better. And advancements into highest Offices in
this spiritual Charge, go often, not so much by virtues as the golden mean.
Experiments are so rife and frequent, that not the meanest Arcadian Creature,
but lives in hope to make himself Lord of the greatest dignity the Land
affords; if he be once furnished sufficiently for practice of the Macedonian
Stratagem. This seeking after great things, especially in men of so little
worth, is at all times odious in the sight of God, and injurious to men. But in
these present times fraught either with examples, or fearful threatenings of
Gods heavy Judgments; in these times wherein superstition increases as a
Plague growing up to quell hypocrisy and licentiousness; far less desires,
even all unnecessary seekings, are preposterous and abominable, and yet in all
States through the Land very usual, and being so, They are Ominous: Which was

12. One Age may afford sufficient store of Examples. A curious Searcher shall
not be able to find any disease, either more Dangerous, or more Genoral, then
this late specified disease of Baruch, in the Christian world, at that time
when the Lord did so grievously lance the whole body of it with the swords and
spears of the Vandals, Goths, Hunnes, and other Barbarians, scarce known
before by name. The approach of all or most of them was so sudden and
unexpected, that a man could scarce imagine what other Errand they had to visit
these parts of Europe, save only to be Gods Chirurgions, in cutting of the dead
and unrecoverable members of the Church. Of what sort or kind soever the sins
of any Age or People be, when sinners once come to such A Great Warning; and a
Greater Truth.
height or progress in them, as the sight of Gods Judgments, or experience of
his displeasure cannot persuade men to forsake them: It is a true Crisis of
General plagues or desolations approaching.

No sign more deadly, then intemperate longing after unseasonable mirth or
pleasures, of what kind soever, especially of such, as are contrary to that
course of life, whereunto God for the present calls men. For they that seek
after such things, plainly declare, That they say in their hearts, We shall
have Peace albeit we walk according to the stubbornness of our own hearts,

That the General constitution of the Christian World when the Barbarians
overran it, was altogether such, as we have said (such as this people for the
most part is at this day.) Salvianus, A Reverend Bishop of those times has

and Ludicrorum Confundebatur, etc.

The like stupiditie and intemperance the same Author out of his experience
attributes unto one of the Chief Cities, of the Galls, whose Inhabitants were
so besotted with drunkenness, that they could not shake it of when they were
beset with death. Ad hoc, postremo, rabida vini aviditate Perventum est, ut

of Pestilence his Messenger unto us; both their Commissions are of equal
authority, both their Summons should be alike dreadful, and yet what day did
any die in this City by the Arrow of God, but as many, or more were dead drunk,
or had surfeited of their beastly banquets.

Again, in Trevers, one of the most flourishing Cities of the Galls, and (as I
take it) the Reverend Bishops native soil, so intemperately were the
Inhabitants set on their wonted delights and vanitites, that after their City
had been three or four times sacked, and did not retain so much as the likeness
of what it had been; yet they are still the same; And as if they had never
sown unto the spirit, but altogether unto the flesh; as if their sportings and
pastimes had been the only harvest they cared to reap, No sooner was this storm
of War and blood broken up, And the beams of peace restored again; but they
errected their stages even in the fresh Sent of deadly vapors exhaling from
their murdered Citizens buried in their Cities ashes. Pauci nobiles, qui
excidio super-fuerant, quasi pro summo deletae urbis remedio, Circenses ab
Imperatoribus postulabant. And may not we think (unless our Magistrates
Religious care had been the greater to have prohibited Stage Plays in these
dangerous times of visitation) that a great many in this City would have
adventured to have been in Circo, though death had been appointed to keep the
Playhouse door. Should the Stage Player, or other instrument of vanity, have
visited our Suburbs within two months after our fourth, or fifth visitation
past; more of better rank amongst us, would have been more afraid of being
censured as Puritanes for speaking against them (though out of this place) then
would have blushed to have been spectators of their lewd unseasonable
sportings, in places not so well be fitting their Calling.

I will not take upon me to Censure this or any like Recreation, as altogether
unlawful. But what time has been for sundry years past (would God this present
did presage much better to come) wherein the use of these, or other more
unquestionable recreations, might not justly be censured for superfluous, if
not preposterous. And with what indignity that worthy Bishop did prosecute
these unseasonable vanities of his Countrymen, I refer you to his books, De
Gubernatione and Providentia, a fit Manual for the volume, but Salvian.
in these times, an excellent Cordial for the matter. Ludicra ergo publica
Trever pet is? Art thou an inhabitant of the miserable more then thrice
ransacked Tryers; and seek thou after such fruitless toys, as plays? Ubi
(quoeso) exercendae? Where (on Gods name) will thou have them acted? an super
bustum, and Cineres, super sanguinem and ossa mortuorum? upon the Graves? upon
the ashes? upon the blood and bones of thy massacred brethren and fellow
Citizens? The continuance of this vainitie in the living did in his estimation,
surpass the misery and infelicitie, which had befalne the deceased.

13. Death and the destroying Angel (which by their often soaring, and hovering
over our heads had over-shadowed this City; and for the solitariness of these
and like assembles had sometimes almost turned our day into night) have now,
Gods name be praised for it, taken their flight another way. Yet shall not
these Admonitions seem altogether so unseasonable now, as our sportings were
then. Though secured we be from present dread; yet may we without offense (as
men that had passed great dangers in their night Distempers, or sudden
affrights) look back by day, in Calm, and sober thoughts, upon our former ways.

And I beseech you, take these following speeches, that distilled from that
sage, and learned Bishops zealous Pen, as preservatives against the like
dangerous times to come, not as censures, or invectives of mine to gall any for
what is past. Suppose this Reverend Bishop had lived amongst us: how would he
have taxed the unseasonable Luxuries of late times. Go to now! Oye that are
strong to pour in wine; or ye that have verified the Proverb by your practice,
that, Man's life is but a stage play, wherein you know to act none but the
mimickes part; ye that make your selves mutual sport by grieving or abusing
others: Go to now, ye that have quite inverted Solomon's Counsel: ye that have
wholly consecrated your selves to the house of mirth, and feasting, and hold it
a hell to be drawn into the house of mourning; where do ye mean to celebrate
your wonted sports? where shall your meriments: where shall your pleasant
meetings be? what, in the City which the Lord so often has smitten, which so
often has groaned under his heavy hand? what, even then, when the sore did
run amongst your brethren? O fools and slow of heart to believe the writings of
the Prophets, and frequent Admonitions of so many holy, and Religious men!
might not nature, which nurtereth the heathen, which teaches the beasts of the
field, and birds of the air, to know their season, have also taught you how
unseasonable your mirth, how prodigious your insolence has been? What foul
indignity had you offered, though you had offered it to a private man, to
revell it in the room, wherein his children, wherein his wife had laid a dying?
What humane heart, what civil (though unregenerate) ear could endure to hear,
of one and the same family some in the midst of bitterest Agonies praying,
others swearing or blaspheming; some panting for faintness, or rattling for want
of breath; others cackling or shrugging at the sight of wanton sporting? And
dare you account them, for whom Christ Jesus shed his blood, less dear to him,
then dearest children are to loving Parents, or wives to most loving husbands?
And what is this City in respect of him! (would God This was preached in Oxon
after the visitation by the Plague.
you would permit it so to be) But at the best could you imagine it any more,
then the Chamber of the great King, whom neither the heaven, nor the heaven of
heavens can contain? Shall not his ear, who fills all places with his
presence; be as able to discern each dissonant noise, or disagreeing speech, or
carriage within the walls, or suburbs of this City as the most accurate
musicians ear is to distinguish contrary Notes, or jarring sounds within the
compass of a narrow parlour? And what music think you will it make in his
ears, or how will it sound to those harmonical spirits, which by his
appointment Pitch about this place, when they shall hear, in one corner, some
in the Agony of their souls sending out grievious screiks, and bitter
outcries; others out of their abundant heat of mirth and pastimes filling the
streets with profuse immoderate clamors? Some again praying with deep sighs,
and grievous groans; others foaming out their shame, in drunken, scurrilous or
lascivious songs, some having their hearts ready to break for grief; others to
burst their lungs with laughter?

These beloved have been the abuses in former times! which any Reverent, and
zealous spirit that had lived amongst us, justly might, and questionless would
have taxt more sharply: And yet of such reproves, the best of us might well in
some measure have been sharers. But these dangers are gone long since; would
God the guilt of our sins were as far removed from us; If it remain, like times
may return again. What then remains, but, that we repent of what is past, and
take heed of what is to come? Lord! never let the pensive sighs, the mournful
groans, or grievous outcries of dying men be mingled with our lavish mirth,
and sportings. O let not the songs of pleasure, and the voice of death ascend
the heavens, or appear at thy Tribunal seat together, least This most
unseasonable discord sound still in thy ear until the sound of the Angels
Trumpet, summon us to that fearful Judgment; wherein they may laugh and we may
cry, wherein their comfortless sighs, and dolorous groans, may be changed
into everlasting Haleluiahs of joy, and peace; and all immoderate unlawful
mirth, all unseasonable, and untimely pleasures be terminated with endless
grief. And as for such as seek to raise the spirit of unhallowed mirth, and
belch out their scurrilous Jests by pouring in wine and strong drink, even in
the days, wherein the Lord has called them to fasting and mourning: O that
they could consider, the time may come wherein they shall wish for one drop of
that liquor for a whole day (which now they pour in hourly without measure) to
cool their scorched tongues; And yet (unto their greater misery) shall not be
heard in so miserable a wish; but in the continual want of this, and all other
comfort, their pleasant songs shall be turned into bitter howlings; Their
wanton motions, and mimick gestures into wailing and gnashing of teeth.

And as for you Reverend Fathers, or you my much Respected Brethren, to whom
any charge of others either private or public is committed: Consider (I
beseech you) what places you bear in these Houses of God. All of you in your
several Charges sustain the place of righteous Job in his Family, for your
fatherly care over inferiors. Whilst then your Sons thus banquet in their
houses, every one his day, and send and call their friends to eat and drink
with them: Be you sure the Lord will require at your hands, that you be so much
more vigilant in your Callings: not only in punishing the Chief Offenders in
this kind, as some of you have begun, (though this no doubt will be an
acceptable sacrifice unto God) but even in offering up your evening and morning
sacrifice for them, according to the number of their transgressions. For
doubtless your Sons have grievously offended and blasphemed God in their
hearts: And therefore you must be so much the more diligent to offer up the
sweet incense every day. For all of us (Beloved in our Lord and Savior) see
the days wherein we live are extraordinary evil, and the time must be redeemed
by our extraordinary vigilancie, sobriety and sanctity. As others double and
treble the sins of this present, in respect of former times, so must we in like
proportion increase our industry, and diligence, fervent prayer, good
exhortation, charitable deeds and sacred functions. Thus would you (Reverend
Fathers) go before us in these duties, as you do in dignity, God would restore
your lost sons to you again; and besides Jobs Restitution in this life, you
shall certainly be partakers of Daniels Blessing in the life to come. For thus
turning others unto righteousness by your good Examples, you shall shine like
Stars for ever. God grant you (Governors) wise hearts, thus to rule; And all
inferiors Grace to follow your good Examples and Advice.

Amen.

which, God, took away good King Josiah, in favor to him. Baruch, as man, did
sympathize with the miseries of his people; As a faithful man and a Prophet of
the Lord, He conformed to the just will of God. The Application

1. OF the Two Aphorisms deduced out of the Text, The later (left before
untouched) comes now to be handled. And it is This.

In times of public Calamity or desolation the bare Donative of life and
liberty is a privilege more to be esteemed, then the Prerogative of Princes.
Or in other Terms thus. Exemption from General Plagues is more then a full
recompense for all the Grievances which attend our ministerial charge, or
service in denouncing them.

Of this, by Gods Assistance, I shall treat without further Division, or Method
more accurate, then that Usual One; (...).

First, Of the Natural Esteem of Life, or Exemption from common Plagues in
General.

Secondly, Of it, as the Case here stands with Baruch.

Vox populi, etiam vox Dei est:

It is the voice of Nature uttering only what is engraven by the Creators
Finger in the heart of man, and of creatures otherwise dumb; Life is sweet: and
would be so esteemed of all, could we resolve to live at home, endeavoring
rather to improve those seeds of happiness, which grace or Nature have sown in
us, then to encompass large or vast materials of foreign Contentments. But
unto men whose desires are once diverted from the true End of life unto the
remote Means destinated for its procurement; unto such men as have set their
thoughts such Roving Progresses as Pyrrhus did: or with the fool in the Gospel,
are not able to give their souls their Acquietances, until they have enlarged
their storehouses, and laid up goods for many years: the attaining of such
particulars as for the present they most seek after, does rather whet then
satiate their appetite of the like.

Hence life attended with mean appurtenances becomes either loathsome or little
set by because the provision of necessaries actually enjoyed is as nothing in
respect of those impertinencies, which they have swallowed in hope, or have in
continual chase: The want of these latter unto men wedded unto vast desires, is
more irksom, then the possession of them can be pleasant; so that to live
without them seems a kind of loss.

Methinks Plinies Hyperbolical or Fabulous Narration of the greedy wildgoose,
which plucks so eagerly at the roots (of what plants I now remember not, but)
so fixed to the ground that she oft-times leaves her neck behind her, may be a
true Emblem of such men's intemperate pettish hopes, usually so fastened to the
matters, which they much desire, that sooner may their souls be drawn out of
their bodies then weaned from these.

Wounds, though deep and grievous, are scarce felt to smart whilst the blood is
hot, or the body in motion: No marvel then, if in the fervent pursuit of
honor, gain, or pleasure, men sometimes suffer their souls to escape out of
their prison, before the flight be discerned.

In fine, as young Gallants for speedy supplies of luxurious expenses usually
morgage their Lands ere they know their worth: So life it self is oftentimes
hazarded upon light terms by such as know not, what it is to live.

We have heard of a Soldier so forward to take the advantage, which A Forward
Soldier.
Chance of War had given, that he cried out unto his Captain; Follow and we
shall have a day of them: whereas a perpetual night was taking possession of
his eyes, his entrals being let out whilst he uttered these words. I can more
easily believe this of an English spirit, though not in print, because it is
upon Authentic Record, that Petrus Strozius a famous Italian Commander, being
shot with a bullet of a larger size under the left pap, fell down dead to the
Petrus Strozius.
ground, leaving these words behind him in the air; The French King has lost a
true and faithful servant: It seems his heart had been too full fraught with
swelling Conceits of his own worth.

I could instance in many (did the time permit) which have either encountered
death with such und antedness, or suffered life to be taken from them with so
little ado, as their Example may seem a just Temptation unto braver spirits, to
dis-esteem the proffer here made to Baruch, as scarce worth the acceptance;
unless the conditions were more ample then have been intimated.

2. But if that be true, whereof some of Natures Principal Secretaries have
given us notice. In ipso mortis articulo sumus vitae avidissimi: Many such as
have rusht upon extreme danger without dismay, or outward sign of fear, See
Val. Maximus de Cupiditate Uiae.
(could their tongues have been their hearts interpreters, whilst their souls
did take their farewell, or whilst their heads were severed from their bodies,
as Homer relates of his Heroicks) their last Ditty (I am persuaded) would have
been, Dulce bellum inexpertis. It was well observed by the younger Pliny;
Impetu quodam and instinctu procurrere ad mortem, commune cum multis:
deliberare vero and causas ejus expendere, utque suaserit ratio, vitae Epist.
Lib. 1. Epist. 22.
mortisque consilium suscipere and ponere; ingentis est animi. For his sick
friend to weigh life (though laden with grief) and death not fully apprehended,
but approaching, in steady calm and quiet cogitations, not suffering his mind
to be so far biased or cast with the conceit of the one or other; but that
the voice of Physician or Friend should sway his choice to accept of either,
did in this Romans judgment argue a truly resolute and noble spirit.

God sometimes in mercy (in justice often) so appoints, that death shall fully
attach men, before they apprehend the least Terror of it; which, without the
special Assistance of his Spirit, is one time or other, terrible to flesh and
blood without exception. That many are never heard expressly to recall their
stubborn resolutions, for abandoning discontented or disgraced life, does not
sufficiently argue, they did not finally mislike their choice. They might
mislike it when it was too late, the door of repentance being shut upon them,
whilst with the foolish Virgins they sought for the oil of mercy to renew the
decaying lamps of life. For, albeit the unwieldy desires of lofty minds may
overturn the very foundation whereon they are built, ere notice can be taken
which way they sway; yet at the very moment of dissolution (on which the
Conceits of what they are, and what they must be, move upon equal terms, as
upon an indivisible Center) they will relent. And although they had formerly
been persuaded, that souls might be annihilated by death, yet to live, although
with never so little, yea even to live, because life is something, must needs
seem better, then to be utterly nothing. He that can see no mean betwixt the
members of that division; Aut Caesar, aut nihil; is questionless subject to
some strange suffusion of his internal eyesight, or has his hopes hoysted
with wine, the usual bellows to inflame the heart with rash and desperate
resolutions.

Many, for true valor better able to win an Empire, and for wisdom more fit to
manage it then Caesar Borgia (either first Author or chief Practitioner of this
false Logic) have been content to beg life and liberty at their insolent
enemies hands, whose presence they never did, nor ever would have feared in
Battle.

3. To give you A full Induction in One Instance: It shall be in that Famous
Spanish Leader, which had Italy, France, Germany, unpartial Witnesses; and See
Lanoue, Paradox second, Page 204.
his professed Enemies, professed Admirers of his heroical Worth; Alvares de
Sand; under whose Colors not one of his Countrymen, but was more afraid to
play the Coward, then to encounter the fiercest Enemy that durst affront him.
Or least this his courage might be suspected to be of Cravons kind; or the
Sohaere of his valor terminated within the bounds of Europe; his Africane
Exploits against the Moors, would hardly be credited by modern Soldiers;
unless Lanoue a man without the reach of suspicion either for Ignorance, or
vulgar Credulity in matters Martial, had given them undoubted Credence, and
used this Great Spanish Commanders Performance, as an Experiment or Probatum to
evince the truth of the seeming Paradox; Concerning the use of the Pike in
war. For what Captain almost since the ancient Romans times would have
undertaken to maintain that in the Schools as possible, which this Noble
Spaniard proved by practice? To conduct four thousand pikes over a plain of
four or five miles length, in despite of eighteen thousand horse, appointed of
purpose to prevent their passage. Yet after six fierce encounters upon the best
advantage that so great distance could afford unto his barbarous enemies, He
brought his company, all save 80. safe unto the place intended; leaving seven
or eight hundred of his assaylants dead on the field; the rest repulsed.

I should not have given so much credence unto La-Noue's reports or discourse,
unless that Noble English General Sir John Norice (who entitled Lanoue to the
Father of modern Wars) had put in execution the rules prescribed by Lanoue for
use of the Pike and harquebuse or musket, with better success then either
Alvarez de Sand, or that well trained Spanish band which slew, that Noble Peer
of France, Guaston de Fois, in that uncelebrated yet most famous Retreat at
Gant, never be forgotten by the English Nation.

Or if some young Gallant or hard-bred soldier should here except against
Sandeus, as the Aramites did against the God of the Israelites. It may be he
was a man of an intrepid spirit in the field, but perhaps more faint hearted
then many others of his time, to endure a lingering siedge: I will refer such
to his Defense of Gerbis, where having brought himself to the common soldiers
stint, as well for the quality as for the quantity of his meat, he persuades
Thuanus Lib. 26. page 543. colum. 1.
the feeble remnant, being but one thousand left of many, which had been
consumed by famine and such languishing diseases (as scarcity or homeliness of
diet usually breed) to honor their death with the enemies blood, rather then
to yield themselves into their hands. Albeit the success did not answer his
Resolution, yet the attempt was on his part so valorous, that the Turkish
General (whose Tent he sought to surprise by night, being) stricken with
admiration of his worth, did woo him upon honorable Terms to become servant
to great Solomon his master, as Solomon himself afterward did upon the Fame.
But he whose carriage for any terror or calamity of Wars was thus
invincible, was by a short captivity (though not half so miserable as the
Princes and nobles of Judah were now to suffer) brought to deprecate death in
humble sort, and afterward to esteem of life as a more welcome prey then the
richest spoils of all his former victories, then the greatest Kingdom that
could have been offered him in the days of his prosperity.

How easily the Almighty can teach the haughty stomach or intrepid heart to
esteem his favor here profer'd to Baruch as they ought, we need no better
testimony (for no better can be brought) then Busbequius his relation of this
Noble Spaniards miserable perplexity, during the time of his imprisonment in
Constantinople. This Busbequius, the Legate there for Ferdinand, See Busbequius
his fourth epist. De Rebus Turc.
being requested by some of Sandeus's quondam followers (now his companions in
captivity) to comfort their master by his letters, tells us. Ego recusabam: quod
mihi non ratio, non oration suppetebat, qua hominem tam graviter afflictum
consolarer. It is a true and lively Symptom of a great spirits temper, whom
the Lord begins to humble, once subject to the Almighties discipline, which the
same Author has observed upon this occasion. Erat Sandeus ingentis spiritus
vir, spei abundans, timoris nescius; sed qui sunt hujusmodi, ut omnia quae
optant, sperant: sic post quam cuncta retro ferri, et contra animi sententiam
evenire experiuntur, Ita plerunque animis concidunt, ut non sit facile ad
aequitatem eos erigere.

4. Pearls are precious (and as he says, cara, auro, contra) though such
simple creatures as Aesops cock, value them lower then a grain of barley. And
life at all times is sweet, always more worth then any pleasure, wealth, or
honor (unless that honor, which comes from God alone) however haughty
cock-brains or furious hot-spurs esteem it lighter then a puff of popular fame.
But besides the untimely loss of life, or ordinary dread of violent, or bloody
death (the manner how it is God grant we never know by experience) but so
assuredly it is, That, When the wrath of God once thoroughly kindles against any
Land or people, it puts an unusual terror upon the countenances of their
enemies; an unusual edge upon their swords: It sharpens the sting of natural
death, and so envenomes the jaws and teeth of famine, and his fellow
messengers, that the smart of their impressions, or the mere terror of their
threatenings, becomes unsufferably grievous beyond all measure of former
experience, or precedent cogitation.

Nothing before has been held so base; whereunto greatest spirits will not
then be fain to stoop. Nothing so cruel or unnatural, unto whose practice the
mildest and lovingest natures will not be brought, upon Condition, yea upon
Hope, nay upon probable Presumption, that they might become but half sharers in
the Donative, which is here bestowed on Baruch: Thy life will I give unto thee
for a prey in all places whither thou go. Not the most womanish among the
weaker sex, in this whole Land, but would presume of so much manlike
resolution, as by one means or other to lay down the wearisome burden of an
irksome life, rather then she should be enforced to seek the preservation of it
by killing them whom she had lately quickened, or devouring their flesh, whom
she lately brought forth with sorrow, and daily fed with her own substance.
Suppose we then that those mothers of Jerusalem, which re-intombed their
sucking infants in their wombs, were naturally more cruel and savage than other
women ordinarily are? No! The Lord himself has fully acquitted them of this
imputation. The hands of the pitiful women (says the Prophet, Lament. 4. 10.)
have sodden their own children: Lament. 4. 10.
they were their meat, in the destruction of the daughter of my people. And if
women, women of pity, in the time of War, can thus bestrip themselves of all
wonted bowels of compassion toward the tender offspring of their wombes,
shall not the strong man put off his valor and the valiant forget to fight?
shall not flight be far from the swift, and wisdom perish from the Politic? It
is the day of the Lords wrath (says the Prophet) and who can stand, who can
abide it? Not such as for any motion of fear have stood more immovable then a
rock, whilst the strongest walls of their defense have been terribly shaken with
the enemies shot. The stronger their wonted confidence had been, the greater
their horror and confusion, when they shall discern the finger of God
beginning once to draw the dismal lines of their disasterous Fates; or when
with Belshazzar they begin to read their Destinyes in visible but Transient and
unknown Characters: then feebleness, woe and sorrow come upon the mightiest men,
as upon a woman in her travel, breeding a dissolution in the loins, and causing
their knees to smite one against another. The terrors of War or other
affrightments, whereunto they have formerly been accustomed, though oft-times
very great, did never appear more then finite, because always known in part.
But of these Panici terrores or Representations, which usher Gods wrath in the
day of vengeance, that is most true, which the Philosopher gives as the Reason,
why uncouth ways seem always long; Ignotum, qua ignotum, infinitum est. And
as the the Kingdom of God, so his judgments, and the terrors, which accompany
them, come not by Observation; In respect of this sudden dread or un-observable
terror wherewith the Almighty blasts their souls, whom he has signed to
fearful destruction, They may say of their adversaries most furious assaults,
as he did of his Antagonists most blustering words;

-- Non me tua fervida terrent
Dicta ferox; Dii me terrent, et Jupiter hostis.
One while they shall seek for death, but it will not be found of them. Another
while death shall present it self to them, and they shall make from it, and yet
it in the very next moment wish they had entertained it. And though life abide
with them still, yet shall it not be as a Prey unto them, but as a Clogg, their
persons being exposed unto their enemies pleasure, perpetually tortured either
between vain hopes of escape and uncertain expectance of an ignominious doom,
or between their desires of speedy and gentle death and the lingering
grievances of miserable and captived life. In all these respects the Prophets
Advice is good: seek ye the Lord all the meek of the earth, which have
Zephaniah 2. 3.
wrought his judgments, seek righteousness, seek lowliness, if so be that you
may be hid in the day of the Lords wrath.

5. But, be it true in Thesi, That life in its naked substance is sweet; That
ingenuous Liberty, though mixed with poverty, is as a pleasant sauce The
Doctrine handled in Hypothesi.
to make it relish better: yet who shall persuade Baruch, as The Case stands
with him, so to accept it? Nay me thinks flesh and blood should regurgitate his
former murmurings upon this motion made by Jeremy, and interpret the
Prorogation of his life, as a fresh heap of sorrows laid unto the burden of
griefs under which he fainted. Profers made by earthly Princes must be
respected by their followers, though worth little in themselves: for unto them
Court holy water must seem sweet, although it have no smell of gain. But shall
the The King of Kings obtrude That as an Extraordinary blessing upon his poor
distressed servant, which had been adjudged, (as his own word An Objection.
bears Record) for a bitter curse or grievious plague; from which Two Kings
(the one of Israel the other of Judah) were not exempted but upon great
humiliation and penitent tears? For, was it not The word of the Lord which came
to Elijah the Tishbite saying: see thou how Ahab humbles himself before me?
(for he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted 1 King.
21.
and lay in sackcloth and went softly) because he humbles himself before me, I
not will bring the evil in his days, but in his sons days will I bring the
evil upon his house. Such was that Message which Hulda the prophetess
delivered unto Josiahs messengers. But to the King of Judah which sent you to
enquire of The Lord, thus shall ye say to him. Thus says the Lord God of
Israel, as touching the words which thou have heard; because thine heart was
tender, and thou have 2 Kings 22. 18. 19 20.
humbled thy self before the Lord, when thou heardest what I spoke against this
place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a
desolation and a curse; and have rent thy clothes and wept before me: I also
have heard thee says the Lord: Behold therefore I will gather thee unto thy
fathers, and thou shall be gathered into thy grave in peace, and thine eye
shall not see all the evil, which I will bring upon this place. Yet did the
arrows of Isreal's and Judahs most inveterate enemies, the arrows of the
Aramites and Egyptians, make violent entrance for death into both these
Princes bodies, long before the time by ordinary course of nature prefixed for
dispossession of their souls: How then should life be unto Baruch as a welcome
Prey, being to be fully charged with all these hard conditions and bitter
grieviances, whose release or avoidance made untimely bloody death become A
kind of gracious Pardon unto Ahab, and a grateful Boon or Booty to good Josias?
For what evil did the Lord either threaten, or afterward bring upon Iosiahs
posterity or people, which Baruchs eyes did not behold? Nor did this lease of
life and liberty here bequeathed unto him expire, till long after Jerusalems
glass was quite run out, till after her whitest Towers were covered with dust,
and all the cities of Judah and Benjamin laid wast; till the King, the Princes,
and nobles were led captives, or slain, and the remnant which War had left in
Judah, as a gleaning after harvest, dispersed and sown throughout the Land of
Egypt, never to be reapt but by the Sword, which even there pursues them;
(excepting a very small number that escaped, Ierem. 44. 28.) And what greater
evil could Iosias's eyes have seen, though he had lived as long as Baruch?

The Difficulty therefore seems unanswerable, How life should be a more
grateful prey unto Baruch, then it might have been unto Josias? The Objection
pressed home.


6. But here, if we rightly distinguish the Times, the Persons and Offices; We
may easily derive the violent shortning of good Josias his days, and this
lengthening of Baruch's, to see the evil, which Josias desired rather to be
sightless then to see, from one and the same loving kindness of the Lord.
Josias The Answer to the former Objection.
(we must consider) was The Great Leader of Gods People, and could not but wish
their Fall should be under some other then himself.

It was a Donative more magnificent, then the long reign of Augustus, that
being slain in war he should go to his grave in peace. For this included his
peoples present safety, whose extirpation had been till this time deferred for
his sake, though now at length, he must be taken out of the way, that the
Messengers of Gods wrath, which could forbear no longer, may have a freer
passage throughout the Land. No marvel if after thirty one years reign in
prosperity and peace, he patiently suffered violent death, being thus graced
with greater honor, then either Codrus, the last King of Athens, or the Roman
Decius, purchased by voluntary sacrificing themselves for their people. Perhaps
the plagues, which these men feared, might otherwise have been avoided: Or it
may be, the fear it self was but some vain delusion of Satan, always delighted
with such sacrifices. But that Jerusalem and Judah, standing condemned before
Iosias's birth, were so long reprieved and so well entreated for his sake, we
have the great Judges Sentence for our warrant. And therefore the Word of The
Lord which Huldah the Prophetess had sent, must needs seem good to him.

It was a message more unwelcome, then such a death as Josias suffered, which
Isaias brought to his great Grandfather Hezekiah, lately delivered from the
Assyrian, and miraculously restored to life; but more forward to receive
Presents from Berodash King of Babylon, then to render praise and thanksgiving
to his God, according to the Reward bestowed upon him. Behold, the days come
(says Isaias) that all that is in thine house, and that which thy Fathers have
laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried unto Babylon: nothing shall be
left (says the Lord.) And of thy sons, which shall issue from thee, which thou
shall beget, shall they take away, and they shall be Eunuchs in the Palace of
the King of Babylon.

Does he repine or mutter at this ungrateful Message?

No; But with great submission replies, Good is the Word of the Lord, which
Thou have spoken. And he said: Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my
days? Isaiah. 39. 8.

Shall we hence collect that this Good King was of that wicked Tyrants mind,
who, as he had shortened her days from whom he had beginning of life, so did
he envy his Mother Nature should survive him; wishing the world might be
dissolved at his death, and that Old Chaos might be his Tomb?

God forbid we should wrong the memory of so Gracious a Prince by the least
suspicion of such ungracious thoughts! Rather, his heart did smite him for
showing his Treasury, his Armory, and other provision, wherein he had gloried
too much, unto the King of Babels Messengers. This sin he knew to be such as
his Father David's had been in numbering the Hosts of Israel: The plagues now
threatened by his God he could not but acknowledge to be most just: and great
therefore must his mercy toward him needs seem to be, in that for his sake, who
had so ill requited this strange Delivery and Recovery, he would yet defer
them. But seeing the wickedness of Manasseh, and the mighty increase of this
peoples iniquity from Hezekiah's death, did earnestly solicit the Day of
Visitation, the former adjourning of it must cost Josiah dear. And, Gods Arrows
being flesht in him; No marvel, if they return not 2 Chronicles. 32. 25, 26.
empty from the blood of the slain, or from the fat of the mighty: Having begun
with so good A King, it might well be expected, they would make an end of so
naughty a people.

This was he, of whom not the people only, but the Prophet has said: Under his
shadow we shall be safe: As he was a shadow (without question) of that Great
Shepherd, which was to be smitten ere the flock were scattered; upon the
occasion of whose death, his Disciples likewise said, We trusted it had been he
which should have redeemed Israel. And for Josias to become the true 2 King.
23. 30. 2 Chronicles. 35. 21, 24.
shadow, or the bloody picture of that Great Shepherds death, was a greater
honor, then if the shadow in the Dial of Ahaz had returned backward ten
degrees in token of prolonging his days as long as Hezekiah's had been:
specially if we consider, that the Saying fulfilled in the Great Prophet, was
verified in him: Of them, which thou gave me, have I lost none: Though he
were slain, yet his Army returned home safe, and he went to his grave in peace,
being buried in his own Sepulcher by his Servants.

7. But (alas!) Baruch lives in an Age super-annuated for any such Grace or
Favor, as Hezekiah or Josias found; in a City, in which though Noah, Job, and
Daniel lived together, yet as I live (says the Lord God) they shall deliver
neither son nor daughter, they shall but deliver their own souls by their
righteousness. Ezekiel. 14. 20, 21.
And shall not the Word of the Lord, which Jeremy has spoken unto Baruch, be
good? For is it not good that when the Lord has determined to send his four
sore judgments upon Jerusalem; the Sword, and the Famine, and the noysom Beast,
and the Pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast, yet his life shall be a
prey, not unto these, but to himself? Yes, this is much better, considering the
season, then if he had been sole heir to Hezekiah or Josias: Three or four of
whose Successors, all in their turns Kings of Judah, he lived to see led bound
in chains, and their Nobles linkt in fetters of Iron. For Baruch (with
reference unto these men's persons and present calamity) to have such an ample
safe Conduct, as no Monarch living could have granted him; License to travel
whither he listed, with full assurance of life, was An Honor peculiar to Gods
Saints; A Reward wherein at this time my Prophet Jeremy, and Ebedmelech (which
had received Jeremy in the name of a Prophet, ministering bread and water etc.
unto his necessities) were to be his only partners.

8. But though they had liberty to travel whither they please, will they be as
careless passengers without all regard of their mothers sorrows, wherewith the
Lord had afflicted her in the day of his fierce anger? Jeremie doubtless would
have endured all the tortures cruel Babylon could have devised, upon condition
Jerusalem and Judah might still have dwelt in saftie. The Galatians were not
more affectionate toward Paul, then Jeremy was to the meanest branch, that
sprang from good Josias; willingly would he have plucked out his own, to have
redeemed Zedekiah's eyes, or to have prevented that lamentable Farewell, which
they were to take of sight, the barbarous massacre of his dearest children. And
how then can this short prolongation of life be sweet to Jeremy the Aged, or
unto Baruch the Scribe, being now to see such misery fall upon their native
Country, King, and people, as they might justly wish their mothers wombs had
been their graves, rather then they should have been brought forth to behold
it? A thousand lives had been well spent, upon condition such calamity had
never been seen in Jury; and yet the prorogation of Baruchs and Ieremies life,
though certain to see the execution of all the plagues here threatened: (these
becoming now at length without any fault or negligence in them, but rather by
others neglect of their forewarnings, altogether Fatal and inevitable) is much
better then a thousand years spent in mirth and jollity. But would they not
sorrow day and night for the slain of the daughter of their people? The Book of
the Lamentations will witness, tears, not sweet wine, to have been the drink of
him that wrote them.

And shall life, though it have continual sorrow for its sauce, be sweet?
whose heart among us would not be sad, even full of sorrow? whose eyes would
not overflow with tears at the Tragical representation of their disasters and
calamities, whose living persons we had always honored, whose memory and
never dying Fame we reverence? And yet to minds decked with more polite
literature, or mollified with the Muses songs, the secret delight, which in
this Case arises from the Poets Art and contrivance; much more from our
Observation of the strange concurrence of real causes conspiring to work
designs worthy of God (whether for mercy or for vengeance) is infinitely more
sweet and pleasant, then the profuse mirth of lascivious Comedies, on any other
positive delight, whereof humane senses (whether external on internal) are
capable. And if with Reverence any may be thereto compared, This secret placid
delight, (which is thus accompanied with sighs and composed sadness) most
perfectly resembles the internal comfort of the spirit, always rejoicing in
tribulation. Such truly was the joy and comfort, which Jeremy and Baruch found,
who had now been admitted spectators twenty years and more of a true unfeigned
Tragedy; whose Catastrophe was to contain the most doleful spectacle, the great
eye of the world (since it first rolled in his sphere, until this time) had
ever beheld. Had they looked upon the several parts of this Tragedy (the last
Scene especially) with natural eyes; the ghastly sight had doubtless inspired
them with some desperate Roman Resolution, to have acted the like cruelty
upon themselves, as the Babylonians had done upon their brethren; to have set a
full and Capital Period to all the woes (which they had written against this
people) with their own blood spilt in the ruins of the Temple or mingled with
the ashes of the Altar. But now, that The Lord has enlightened their hearts, to
discern the sweet disposition of his all-seeing Providence, still
counterplotting the subtle Projects of man, and making the Politicians (which
had accounted his Prophets silly fools, unexperienced Idiots or raving
Bedlames) more curiously cunning, then the spider, to weave the net which he
had ordained to spread upon them: the more they sorrowed to see the desolation
of their country, the greater still was their solace in contemplating the
justice, power and wisdom of their God, in accomplishing his indignation
contrary to Prince and peoples expectation, but agreeable to their predictions.

Finally, as men compacted of flesh and blood, they could not but sympathize
with miserable men, even their brethren, their flesh and bones. As faithful
men they could not but be in mind and affection conformable to The Lord their
God, by whose good spirit their hearts were touched, and their souls illuminated
to foresee the contrivance of his designs upon these his disobedient
children, which had so often refused the ways of peace, which he would have
led them in, but they would not follow.

9. From this Double Aspect, the One of Nature, the other of Grace, and this
Twofold Sympathy thence arising, the one with their Creator, the other with
their Fellow Creatures; does the Lord frame this Pathetical and forcible From a
double Aspect: A twofold Sympathy arises.
Charge unto Baruch: Behold, that, which I have built, will I break down, and
that, which I have planted, will I pluck up, even this whole Land, and seek
thou great things for thy self? Seek them not. The Exegesis or Implication
fully unfolded extends thus far: Baruch! Would thou reap pleasures from a
Land overspread with plagues, and drowned with sorrow? Or seek thou applause
or credit among a people now become an hissing and astonishment to all their
neighbors? Would thou eat Lambs out of the flock, or fat Calves out of the
Stall, whilst famine devours the men of war, whiles such, as have fed
delicately, languish for hunger in the streets? Would thou be clothed with
soft raiment, or crown thy head with roses, whilst such, as have been brought
up in scarlet, embrace the dunghill? Is it thy desire to glad thine heart with
wine, or with oil to make thee a cheerful countenance, when as the visage of my
Nazarites, sometimes purer then snow, and whiter then milk, is become more
black then any coal? Or do thou affect to live at ease in Sion, to be lulled
asleep with sound of viols, whilst the the outcries of the maimed, captives, or
mothers robbed of their children, are ready to wake the dead out of their
sepulchers? For a voice is taken up (throughout all the Cities of Judah and
Benjamin) a voice of bitter weeping, like that of Rachel mourning for her
children, and refusing comfort, because they are not. Sooner shall heaven fall
to the earth, and the whole earth shrink into its Center, then one word, my
Prophets have spoken, shall fall to the ground. And now, if thou would be
instructed; those days, long since foretold by Micah, are approaching: The
days, Wherein Sion must be plowed as a field, Jerusalem become an heap, and
the mountain of the house like the high places of the Forest: Thou see whole
cities, whole Kingdoms subject to mortality: and seek thou to enclose that
prosperity, which they could not entertain, within thy breast? Albeit thou
could hope to live happily in the midst of so great misery as is decreed
against thy native Country, yet what is, or has been therein, what is it thine
eyes have seen under the sun, whereon thy love and liking could have been more
affectionately set, then mine have been upon this Land and people? For, has it
not been sung of old? Jerusalem is the vinyard of The Lord of Hosts, and the
men of Judah his pleasant plant; yet I (thou see) must forgo mine own
inheritance, and be deprived of Jerusalem my wonted joy: and art thou so wedded
to ought in it, that thou can not leave off to love it, and be contented to
take thy life with thee for a prey to possess in whatsoever place thou shall
make choice of?

10. But is Baruch by this Donative discharged of his former Watchmanship in
Jerusalem? No! As the proposal of these Calamities ought in reason to wean his
soul from wonted delights or seeking after great matters; so one special End of
his not seeking after these, is, that he may be more resolute, and diligent in
denouncing Gods judgments against this people. The intimation of the former
words may (on Gods part) be thus continued.

[ However I have determined to destroy this people, which have forsaken me;
Yet, do not thou forsake thy former Station: repine not at thy wonted charge,
but execute faithfully with alacrity that service whereto my Prophet shall
appoint thee; What though thou have seen no fruit of all thy former labors?
What though Iehoiakim begin to rage afresh, and this people hold on still to
rebel against thee? Has not my spirit continually Warred with the
uncircumcised hearts of their forefathers? Has not the Great Angel of my
Covenant wrastled from time to time with this stubborn and stiff-necked
generation? What could I have done more to my vineyard that I have not done
unto it? Howbeit at every season whilst I looked for grapes, it has brought
forth wild grapes; yet hitherto have I not ceased, nor do I yet cease to prune
and dress it. Have the inhabitants of Jerusalem at any time grieved thee or my
Prophets? Or do I now send thee with this message unto them, and am not with
thee? Yes, in all thy troubles I am troubled; And what art thou, or who is
Jeremy? Not against you, but against me is the rebellion of my people, for they
have vexed my holy spirit; And does this complaint well become thee? I fainted
in my sighing and I find no rest. ]

All these and many like branches, which without violence to the meaning of the
Spirit, might be spread out more at large, are virtually enclosed in the Text.
The force and efficacy of the persuasion arises more particularly from the
Reference, which these words [Seek them not, etc.] have to Baruchs repining at
the message enjoined by Jeremie, and to that Reply of the Almighty upon his
repining; Behold that, which I have planted, will I pluck up, etc. Which last
words (unless I mis-observe the native propriety of the Original) implie such
an Emphatical Antithesis between the losses, which God and Baruch might seem to
suffer, as that speech of the Apostle, 1 Cor. See Chap. 14.. 6. Fol. 3439.
15. 36. implies, betwixt Gods sowing and man's sowing. (...); Thou Fool, that
which thou sowest, is not quickened, except it die. The Implication is, Much
more shall that, which is sown in corruption by the Almighties immediate hand,
be raised in glory. Our Prophets words are verbatim thus: Ejus, quod
aedificavi, destructor Egomet; Of what I have built, I my self must be the
destroyer: Ejus quod plantavi, evulsor Egomet; what was planted by me alone, I
my self must now pluck up: Et tu quaereres grandia tibi? As if he had said. I
may not reap where I have sown, nor gather the fruits which I have planted; and
can not thou be contented to forgo thy harvest, which thou hopest for, but
did not sow? To the least grain whereof thou can have no Title, none so
just and sovereign, as I have to this whole Land, to every Soul that lives in
Judah; and yet the whole and every part of this fair crop must be plucked up and
transplanted.

11. But though the Lord at this time had thus threatened, and more than half
shut the door of Repentance upon this stubborn people; yet the Decree did not
pass the irrevocable Seal of his absolute and unresistible Will, until some

fourteen years after (as has been showed in former meditations out of this
place.)

As much as I now affirm, is included in Ieremies words to Baruch at the very
instant when he repined, Jerem. 36. v. 6, 7. Therefore go thou and read in the
Roll, which thou have written from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears
of the people, in the Lords House upon the fasting day: and also thou shall
read them in the ears of all Judah, that come out of their Cities. It may be
they will present their supplication before the Lord, and will return every one
from his evil way; for great is the anger and the fury, that the Lord has
pronounced against this people.

Whether they would pray in faith or no, was Juris controversi, a matter (at
least to the Prophets foresight) of question. But, that the Lord would repent
him of the plagues denounced, so they would pray in faith, was Iuris liquidi, a
point whereof he never doubted.

Nor is it possible our hearts should ever be thoroughly pierced with the right
conceit either of our own, or of our Countries sins, without this undoubted
Persuasion of Gods infinite love toward all, and every one of us. Impossible
it is for us his Ambassadors to be armed with such indefatigable Courage and
diligence, as the times require; either for discharge of our duty, in
denouncing his plagues against the impenitent, or in averting men from
impenitency, and exciting them to true repentance; until our souls be firmly
possessed with the Prophets Doctrine, Of Gods immutable Facility to repent him
of such plagues, as without our repentance are eternally and immutably decreed
against us.

These Alternations of Gods loving kindness and severitie, toward the Same
People, yea, toward the same Individual Persons, are as the Tropicks, under
which the Messengers of Peace must constantly run their contrary
courses; sometime exhorting with all long-suffering to embrace his mercies;
otherwhile sharply reproving and powerfully threatening his fearful Judgments.

Constancy in truly observing and duly entertaining the just occasions of this
contrariety in the matter of our message, is as the Center, on which our souls
being thoroughly settled, the whole Frame of our affections, whether of love unto
their persons, or of hate unto their sins (over whom he has made us
overseers) becomes parallel to the Almighties Will; who, though he punish the
impenitent with death temporal and eternal, yet does he not will their
impenitencie, but uses all means possible to bring them unto true repentance.

12. It is, I confess, A matter hard for flesh and blood to conceive so much,
as may satisfy this desire of knowing the manner, how Omnipotency should for
many generations be possessed with an eager longing after a peoples safety,
which in the end must be destroyed. How the great Creator of Heaven and Earth,
which gave Being to all things by his Word, and made our souls immortal by his
See the following Sermon upon Matthew 23. 37.
breath, should be as it were in a continual childbirth of sinful men, seeking
to fashion and quicken them with the Spirit of Life, and yet they, after all
this travel, prove but abortive and misshapen, like the untimely fruit of a
woman, which never saw the Sun, never to be seen amongst the living. But no
marvel if we poor Worms of the earth, blind and naked, perceive not the force
or nature of those burning flames of eternal and unchangeable Love (such is the
very nature of our God) seeing they are seated in that glorious inaccessible
light: Yet of that eternal and glorious Sun, whose brightness no mortal eye may
look upon and live, we may behold a true and perfect Module in the Ocean of
mercy and compassion, in the watery eyes of the Son of God, with sighs bewailing
impoenitent Jerusalems woeful Case. If thou had known, even thou, at least in
this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace; but now they are hid from
thine eyes! Luke 19. 42. And elsewhere: O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that
killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would
I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not? Matthew. 23. 37. If Christ Jesus as truly God
as man, did thus thirst after Ierusalems peace, after Jerusalem, thus glutted
with the Prophets blood, did thirst most eagerly after his; far be it from us
to think his loving kindness is utterly estranged from us, albeit our sins have
made a great separation betwixt him and us. Let us not then trifle out the time
with Curious Disputes concerning the manner of his Decree, but rather seek him
with all speed and diligence whilst he may be found; laying sure hold on his
mercy, before the swift approach of his judgments (violently haled down each
day more than other, by the grievous weight of our sins) remove it without the
reach of Ordinary Repentance.

13. It is a truth most delightful and comfortable to Contemplate; That, The
Immensitie of our God is as full of mercy and compassion, as the Sea is of
water, or the body of the Sun of light. But let us withal consider, That the
more abundant his loving kindness toward us, the more sweet and fragrant his
invitations have been; the more grievously have we provoked his fierce wrath
and indignation by our continual wilful refusal to be gathered under the shadow
of his wings daily stretched out in mercy for our safety. Be we sure God knows
his own, as well as we do ours, and will not be overreached by us. The longer
we defer the renewing of his wonted favors, the dearer we must account it
will cost us; our suit at death will be more difficult. Those prayers, those
tears, those sighs, or other attendants or concomitants of true repentance,
which in times past would have gone for current, will hereafter be esteemed
light or counterfeit.

And yet, alas! Who is he in Court or Country, in the City or in the Village,
in the Academy or among the Ignorant or illiterate, that lays his own or
others sins to heart, as he should? Or poures forth such fervent prayers and
supplications unto his God, as our Predecessors have done upon less
signification of his displeasure, and fewer fore-warnings of his judgments,
then we have had continually these diverse years past? Yea who is he amongst all
the Sons of Levi, that with Jeremy and Baruch has utterly disavowed all care
or study of his own advancement or contentment, that he may entirely consecrate
his soul, his thoughts, and best employments to his Masters will, to take away
the precious from the vile, to be as Gods mouth, to cause others to conform
themselves to him, not to conform himself to them? To set himself as a wall of
brass for this rebellious people to fight against; whilst he thunders out Gods
judgments against great and small without all respect of persons? Nay does not

heretofore I have had, and elsewhere shall have occasion to decypher all the
symptoms of a dying State, either set down by the Word of God, or observed by
the expert Anatomists of former dead bodies politic.

14. My message unto you my Brethren the Sons of Levi, is briefly this: Add not
Gods anger to our Countries Curse, which at this day, whether just or no, is
bitter and rife against us; as if we were all or most of us like the companions
of Jesus the son of Josedech, persons Prodigious, but in a worse sense then
they were; Persons, that had procured her, much, and did yet portend her,
greater sorrow; partly by our Dastardly silence in good causes, but especially
by our prophesying for Rewards, and humoring the great Dispensers of those
dignities, on which our unsatiable desires are now unseasonably set.

It was a saying amongst the Ancient Romans; Qui Beneficium accipit, libertatem
vendit. It is thus far improved in true modern English; He that will purchase
preferments (Ecclesiastic especially) must adventure to lay his soul to pawn.
What remedy? Only this, to make a virtue of necessity. For so must every one
do that means to live as a Christian ought. Let us not look so much upon the
sinister intentions of corrupt minds, as upon the purpose of our God, even in
men's most wicked projects.

And who knows whether The Lord by acquainting us with men's bad dealings in
dispensing Ecclesiastical honor, do not lay the same restraint upon us his
children, which he did upon Baruch? Without all question, he absolutely forbids
us to seek afer great matters in this age, in that he has cut off all hopes of
attaining them by means lawful and honest: And all this he does for our good,
that using Baruchs freedom, or Jeremies Resolution in our embassage, we may be
partakers of their Privilege in the Great day of visitation; wherein, such as
in the mean time crush, and keep us under by their greatness, will be ready to
give their wealth for our poverty, and change their honor for our disgrace,
upon condition they might but enjoy life with such liberty and contentments as
we do. Or, in Case they shorten our days by vexation or oppression; yet
faithfully discharging our duties, whether we live or die, we are the Lords.
And though they out live us an hundred years, yet shall they be willing to give
a thousand, yea ten thousand lives, if so many they had, so they might be but
like us for one hour in the day of death. We need not search forain Chronicles,
nor look far back into ancient Annals; The registers of our own memories, and
our fathers relations may afford examples of some sons of Levi, men, if we
rightly value their admirable worth, of place and fortunes mean in respect of
our selves; which after their death (hastened perhaps by hard usage) have filled
both this and foreign Lands with their good name, as with a perfume sweet and
precious in the nostrils of God and man, whilst those great lights of state (so
they seemed, whilst parasitical breath did blaze their fame) which had
condemned them to privacie and obscurity, were suddenly put out but with an
everlasting Stinch. God grant their successors better success, that a precious
well deserved fame may long survive them.

For our selves (Beloved) as we all consort in earnest desires and hearty
prayers, that the Lord would renew his Covenant made with Levi, his Covenant of
life and peace; so let us join hearts in this meditation: The only way to
derive this blessing from this our father unto us his sons, must be by arraying
our selves with Phineas our eldest brothers integrity, by putting on his zeal
and courage, to walk with the Lord our God in peace, and equity, and to turn
many away from iniquity. And now remember them, O my God, that defile their
Priesthood, and break the Covenant of the Priesthood, and of Levi: Smite them
through their loins that make a prey of his possessions; and grind their
heads, as thou did Abimelechs with broken milstones from the walls, or with
the relics from the ruinated houses; yea grind all their heads, O Lord, to
powder, that grind the faces of his poor and needy children. But peace be upon
all such as walk according to this Rule here set to Baruch, and upon all those
that Love God. To this God, The Father, The Son, and the holy Ghost, be
ascribed all honor and glory now and ever.

Amen.

The Publisher, To the Readers of these two last Sermons,
WHo may see, That this great Author was not afraid Most acul^atly to reprove
the sins of his own Time: nor is The Advertiser ashamed to set his seal to the
justness of them by a full and true Publishing his Reproves. Let the Lord be
glorified though with our shame, and justified when he speaks Judgment! And
(to Gods glory be it spoken) This word has prospered in the thing where unto
God sent it, in some of the Gentry and Clergy: Yet can it not be denied but
there is still too great store of matter of Reproof in the same kind. Many
whose estates are sore diminished have minds still set upon Great Things: what
ever they have lost, they find pleasure. Had The Author lived to this day I am
persuaded he would have gone on with The Holy Bishops complaints; Perdidere tot
calamitatum utilitates. Pacem et divitias priorum Temporum Salvian. in his 6.

These are wracks indeed! To Miss the Good which may be got by suffering evil,
is the worst of evils. To lose that gain which should be gotten by losses, is
of losses the greatest. But to grow worse with suffering evil, is perdition it
self. Now if any one, of Prosperous condition, when he reads this shall triumph
and bless himself in his heart saying: We have not sinned in devouring these
men! I beg his Pardon: and beseech him to read on; if he saw our faults in the
last, he may perhaps see his own in the next. And humbly desire leave to say.
1. A man may punish sin and yet (inter puniendum) Commit a sin greater then
that be punishes. 2. In these times, and among the persons promising
Reformation, there has been Greater seeking after great things and that with
greater Inordination too, then was in former Times.

Our Author complained that the Baruchs of his Time sought great things by the
Art of Philip of Macedon. Would God my Clergy Brethren (so I do esteem such
(and none but such) as were begotten to our mother by the R. R. Fathers of the
Church) had not used the Art of Alexander of Macedon to make themselves great.
I must appeal to God and their own Consciences, whether the Demolition of
Bishoprics, Cathedrals, etc. was not intended for augmenting Benefices
(wherewith men, in times accounted corrupt, lived well contented) that they
might satisfy the seekings of this present generation. But alas! What Comfort
can it be to this present that the Former Generation was so Bad? or to the old
ones that the present is so evil? Hoc Ithacus --. There is none that fears God,
(sure not one of those that have erred in their simplicity) but will have to
his prayers, That God would graciously please to reconcile, amend, and forgive
both, and unite serious and Religious endeavors for the good of our afflicted
Church: whose very stones are so precious and Dust so beautiful that they
deserve our Pity: yea, so, that if they be not set up again by us they will
either be transported to Rome, or consummate by Doomsday.

The first Sermon upon this Text.
ROMANS. 2. 1. Therefore, Thou art inexcusable, O Man, whosoever thou art that
judge: for wherein thou judge another, thou condemnest thy self, for thou

judge do the same things.
From what Premises The Apostles Conclusion is inferred. The Limitation of The
Conclusion, to the securing of the lawful Magistrate exercising judicature
according to his Commission, and in matters belonging to his Cognizance. David
and Ahab judging persons (by the Prophets Art) feigned, did really condemn
them-selves.

The sense of The Major Proposition improved, by virtue of the Grammar-Rule,
concerning Hebrew Participles: and by exposition of The phrase. How the later
Jews judging the deeds of their Fore fathers; did condemn themselves.

1. It is not my purpose now to enter a long Dispute with the Anabaptist, or
other Sectaries, which may seem to have help from this Text to oppose Judges
and Magistrates; Being assured, that the Apostle who so warrants and
establishes Power, exercised by heathens over Christians, in the thirteenth
Chapter, does not intend, the least, to disparage it here. It will be Task
sufficient for me to give the True Extent and Limitation of the Text; which
says, That every one that judges another is without Excuse.

The very First Word of the Text, you see, does bear the Stamp or Character The
Text is A Conclusion.
of A Conclusion: Therefore art thou inexcusable O man. Now, every Conclusion
is a Proposition; though every Proposition be not a Conclusion. For, Every
Conclusion is a Proposition inferred from some one or more Propositions more
clear; Or, From which being granted, It will necessarily follow. The first
Question is, from what Premises this Conclusion in my Text is inferred. If Q.
From what Premises inferred.
you peruse the whole Former Chapter, it will be hard to find any Proposition
with which it has any necessary Coherence or Dependence: we are therefore to
look into this second Chapter for the Premises; and to consider, that however,
in Logical or punctual School Disputes, the Premises have always precedence
of the Conclusion; yet in Rhetorical, Civil, Moral, or Theological discourses,
The Conclusion is oft-times prefixed to the Premises or Propositions whence it
is inferred. And thus it is in this Text. To draw our Apostles meaning into
Logical or School-Form, We must place his Propositions, Thus.

Whosoever does the same things, for which he judges another, is without
excuse (and does condemn himself by judging them.)

But, Every one that judges others does the same things for which he judges
them.

Therefore, Every one that judges is without excuse, (and does condemn himself
by Judging them.)

It were a Method brief and plain: First, to show the Truth of the Major.
Secondly, the Validity of the Minor. But I must, according to my intimation
given, first speak Of The True Extent and right Limitation of the Conclusion.

2. The Conclusion you see is Universal: [Every one, whosoever he be, that The
Limitation of the Conclusion.
Judges is without Excuse, Plea, or Apology.] But may we hence infer, that
all such as exercise Judicature, whether Ecclesiastic or Civil are
inexcusable? Or that the Magistracy established in most Christian Kingdoms is
unlawful, as questionless it is, if all such as exercise Judicature be
inexcusable? No: To teach this were a kind of Heresy. The Apostles Conclusion
then must be thus far Limited, in Reference to the Parties judging. It does
not involve or include All that Judge others, but such as take upon them to
judge others, being not lawfully thereunto called. The Judgment, which men
lawfully called do Administer, is not theirs but the Lords, and so far as they
exercise his Judgment, either in matters Civil or Ecclesiastic, they are
worthy of Honor, no way liable to this Censure of such as judge others.

Nor must this Conclusion be extended to Facts or Actions subject to the
External Judicature of Courts; In respect of such, an unrighteous man (so he be
a Judge lawfully called and constituted) may give righteous judgment; and
whilst he does so, he shall not be condemned for judging another who deserves
judgment In Foro Exteriore; yet will God judge him for not judging himself In
Foro Interiore (in case he be guilty of such sins as he judges others for, and
judges not himself) whilst he judges other men's misdemeanors. For a man may be
free from Human or Positive Laws, and yet be a more grievous Transgressor of
the Law Moral, or of the Law of Nature, then they are whom he condemns to
Death, and that deservedly, for transgressing Humane positive Laws: And such an
One is highly obliged to judge himself, That so he may, by Gods Mercy, escape
the judgment of God.

But, though this Conclusion do not involve lawful Magistrates moving in their
own sphere: yet does it lay hold upon and include them also, if they shall The
Extent of the Conclusion.
be found to exercise judicature in those things which belong not, or are not
proper to their Cognizance, albeit, they be in other Cases lawful Judges: for,
in passing beyond their line or exceeding their Commission, they put themselves
into the number, and so into the Condition, of those that take upon themselves
to judge others, having no Authority so to do.

3. Again, it is not simply, Every one that judges; But every one which does
the same things which he condemns in another, that is inexcusable or without
Plea. So the Apostle in the words following seems to limit his Another
Limitation
Conclusion, For wherein thou judge another thou condemnest thy self, for
thou that judge do the same things. Now he that does the same things which
he condemns in another, is properly (...), that is, Without Apology, Excuse
or Plea. He that once grants the Premises (or two first Propositions in a
Syllogism) is by the Law of Disputation, presumed to grant the Conclusion. The
Law of Reason will admit no Negative Plea. Much more does he, which pronounces
Sentence against another, conclude himself under the same Sentence, by doing
the same or like Fact which he condemns in others. The Sentence which he
pronounces upon any other in this Case is more then a Premiss or Antecedent, a
Precedent or Ruled Case to his own Conviction or condemnation. Now as to make a
man grant any Conclusion which he is willing to deny or conceal, there is no
way so expedite, as to press the Premises upon him, from which it necessarily
follows: so to bring a man to condemn or judge himself, for any fault or error
committed by him, there is no means so available, as to let him see how he has
judged or condemned some others for the same or like Fault. Every Sentence or
judgment
which a man makes against himself, is a Conclusion, and for the most part a
Conclusion which no man is willing to grant, unless he be by this means drawn
unto it.

Had that Prophet, of whom we read, 1 Kings 20. 35. delivered his message (from
the Lord) unto King Ahab, (without any Premises or Preamble) Two Instances (in
Ahab and David) who by judging others did condemn themselves.
in these or like plain Terms, Because thou have suffered Benhadad King of
Syria, to escape out of thine hands, he shall do to thee, as thou should have
done to him; Ahab would have put him to his Apology, or rather have left him
inexcusable for meddling in affairs of State. But the same Spirit of God which
gave him knowledge of Ahabs transgression, and Resolution to tax or censure him
for it, did likewise teach him The Art of Discretion, for the manner of
delivering his message, and for the clearer Conviction of this Unruly King: He
first disguised himself with Ashes upon his face, lest the King by his habit
should discern him to be a Prophet: And making Ahab no party, He proposes the
Case as his own or as the Case of some inferior man or common Soldier, He
cried unto the King and said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the
battle, and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said, keep
this man, if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life,
or else thou shall pay a talent of silver; and as thy servant was busy here
and there, he was gone. Here is the Case, or Species Facti; The Kings Sentence
upon it is more brief, ver. 40. So shall thy judgment be; Thy self has decided
it. And the King having granted these Premises, the Prophet knew it was too
late for him to deny the Conclusion, which he immediately presses upon him,
Thus says the Lord, because thou have let go out of thy hands a man whom I
appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and
thy people for his people, and, upon this Conviction, the King of Israel went
to his house heavy and displeased.

Had the Prophet told the King the same Truth directly and bluntly, it might
perhaps have displeased him more, but it could not have made him so heavy as
now he was; for his displeasure would have found a Vent, and ended in rage and
fury against the Prophet. But being thus left without Apology or excuse, (by
condemning another for a less fault (if it had been true) then he himself had
really committed) his displeasure or rage was swallowed up in silent heaviness
of heart.

If Ahab upon this Conviction had been as ready to judge himself by humble
Confession of his fault which he could not deny, as he was to condemn the
disguized Prophet for a far less, He might have escaped the judgment of the
Lord which was here threatened, and did afterward befall him.

By the like Sacred Art or cunning, the Prophet Nathan brought King David
unwittingly to condemn himself by judging the rich man, which (as the Prophet
feigned) had taken away his poor Neighbors Lamb, for entertaining his guests.

Had Nathan immediately and directly told this, otherwise Good King, as
afterward upon this premised Parable he did; Wherefore have thou despised the
Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight? thou have killed Uriah the
Hittite with the Sword, and have taken his Wife to be thy Wife, and have slain
him with the Sword of the Children of Ammon; the Kings anger, which was greatly
kindled against the supposed Rich man, which had wronged his poor Neighbor,
would have kindled more fiercely against Nathan; But now that his anger against
this supposed Rich man, was so truly and really kindled as it burst forth into
this Sentence denounced by solemn oath, As the Lord lives, The man that has
done this thing shall surely die. The blow which he thus fiercely intended
against a shadow, does wound himself at the Rebound; for when Nathan upon the
former Premises makes this Conclusion, Thou art the man, Thus says the Lord
God of Israel, etc. He left him altogether without Plea or Excuse, as standing
condemned by his own judgment upon another. And though the Prophet brought him
unwittingly to condemn himself; yet after his Conviction he willingly
acknowledged his fault; and so by judging himself escaped the judgment of the
Lord, in part at least, though not wholly.

The Facts for which these Two Kings did judge these imaginary or feigned
Persons, were not so heinous or so palpable (if they had been true) as were the
Real Transgressions, of which the Prophets did clearly convince themselves. And
whosoever does the self-same Facts, or Facts worse then those, for which he
judges another, is altogether Inexcusable, and stands convicted by his own
Conscience, condemned by his own mouth.

4. But, albeit This Major or Universal Proposition be unquestionably true
[VVhosoever does the same things, for which he judges another, does condemn
himself; because the doing of the same Fact, does necessarily draw the same
Sentence which he passes upon others, upon himself;] Yet all this, how
Universally how Unquestionably true it be, does not, to my apprehension, make
up the Full meaning of this Proposition, (...); The Full Meaning according to
the Original I take to be this; Every one that is apt to Judge or Censure
others is without Apology, without Excuse. The word in the Original (rendered
by Mr. Calvin, qui Iudicas; and in our English, thou that Judge) is a
Participle, (...). And the Participles of the Greek Testament, See Book 10.
Fol. 3018. and 3099.
or the Septuagint, are to be taken according to the Rate or Value of the
Hebrew.

Now the Hebrew Participles (as every one that has any insight in that Dialect
will observe;) do more properly denote the Habits or custom, then the transient
Acts, and are of the same value with the Latin Verbals. So the Greek (...),
Faciens malum, is as much as Factor mali, Or Operarius iniquitatis, A
Malefactor, or Worker of Iniquity. So in the fourth of St. Matthew ver. 3.
(...). So 1 Thessalonians. 3. 5. (...). So Matthew. 13. 3. (...). And so in this place
(...) is more then he that judges, as much in Latin, as Judex or Censor, He
that is A Judge or Censurer.

Now as a man may appetere vinum and yet not be appetens vini, so may he
sometimes judge or censure another, and yet not be A Judge or Censurer of
others, for that notes the Habit or Custom, not the Act alone.

Now every one that takes upon him the Habit or Custom of censuring others, is
without Apology or Inexcusable, not only in that he takes upon him that
Judicature, which God has not appointed him to exercise; but, Because it is
impossible for any man much accustomed to judge or censure others not to do the
same things, which he Condemns in others: (which was the effect and sense of
the Minor Proposition.) For, as St. James tells us (not excluding him The Minor
of the foregoing Syllogism.
self, who questionless was one of the best men then living,) in many things we
all offend. And if we offend in many things and accustom or use our selves to
censure many, or to pass our sentence upon most things which we see amiss, we
cannot possibly avoid the condemning of our selves, because we cannot possibly
avoid some one or other of those faults, which we censure or condemn in others.

Again; As it is not every Matter for which a man may in any sort be judged (as
for natural parts, or businesses of Art, suppose, unartificially done) so
neither is it every kind of judging or censuring which is here meant. The Text
must needs (at least) have more special force and Reference to matters of more
special weight or consequence: (To give instance) in such matter of Life and
Doctrine as imports, or is conceived to implie, Favor or Dis-Favour with God;
As that, This man is an Elect vessel; That a castaway or Reprobate. Now every
one does condemn himself who so judges others in these Points, that he seeks
to justify himself by judging them. He says in his heart, as the Pharisee
did; I thank God I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican. The Pharisee
had taken notice of some good Evidences or qualities in himself, of which he
saw a want in the Publican: and of some ill conditions in the Publican from
which he thought himself free in the particular; Et sic ad pauca respiciens
facile pronunciat. This is the ordinary ground of rash and uncharitable
judgment when men compare their own Good parts with others Bad.

5. To sift the Orginal (...) a little further: besides the Multiplicitie of
censuring, or proneness to judge others, It imports a kind of Usurped
authority over others. For whosoever takes upon him (...) to sentence or judge
another, has a secret persuasion or Conceit, that he is better then the man
whom he judges, at least in respect of those things for which he judges him.
Otherwise, he would not judge but rather pity him or pray for him, and for
himself lest he fall into the like temptation. No man is fit to judge or
censure another, but he that is able to correct or reform that fault or Error
for which he judges him. Now the fervent zeal of correcting or Reforming
Abuses most gross and palpable, usally misleades men not well instructed in
the
ways of God, into worse errors then those are which they seek to Reform in
others. He that will take upon him to be a Reformer of others, must first be
thoroughly reformed himself, must be renewed (as the Apostles speaks) in the
spirit of his mind, enabled by The spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his
Providence to see a far off as well as near at hand; and to forecast the
inconveniences which may follow long after, as well as to discern mischiefs
present, or their redress.

And, When our Apostle says, Thou that judge another do the same things;
His meaning is not, that he does always the same things, Quoad speciem, as we
say in kind; or the same things for outward semblance; but oft-times the same
things by Equivalencie, things of the like value or importance. And after this
manner, Two men may do the same things, although the things done by the one, be
quite contrary to the things done by the other. Every Opposition to error is
not a Truth; For, Two Contrary Propositions, (as Logicians observe) may be
alike false. And so may the Reformation of grossest Errors, whether in matter
of Manners or Opinions be altogether as bad as the Errors or Abuses which they
seek to Reform, if they always seek the cure of the disease by contraries. In
matters of Fact or Manners that saying of the Poet is most True;

Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt. Whilst unwise men seek to avoid
one vice they run into a contrary vice. And in matter of Opinion or speculation
That Saying of the same Poet has been often ratified by woeful Experience;

In vitium ducit culpae fuga, si caret art. The eschewing of one error is the
high way to another, if it be done by hasty inconsiderate flight and not
according to the Art and Rules of A Sober Retreat.

The truth of what is said before, is plain from the Apostles Instances, v. 21.
22. Thou that teach, a man should not steal; do thou steal? This imports
a committing of the same sin in kind, for which he judged another. But when he
says, Thou that abhorrest Idols, committest Thou sacrilege? This cannot be
meant of commiting the same sin in kind, but only by Equivalency; For Idolatry
and Sacrilege are contrary; The one is the fruit of superstitious zeal or
blind devotion; The other of Atheism. But as diverse other Contraries, so
these Two agree too well in One General, that is, in robbing God of his honor.
And for this Reason, As often as any Sacrilegious persons (suppose the Jews)
which robbed God in his tithes and offerings, did judge or censure the heathen
for Idolatry, they did condemn themselves; for they did the same or worse. And
it is Generally True, That none are so rigid Judgers, censurers, or Reformers
of others, as those that are tainted with the
contrary Crime or Fault. And no marvel, seeing the unwiser sort of men (which
are the far greater part) know no other way how to eschew one vice but by
running into the contrary. Like that Lunatic child in the Gospel, sometimes
falling into the water, and then soon after, into the fire, which was a
miserable cure of the harm received in the water: Not much better is the
Reformation which many in our days seek to make in themselves or Others: Some,
whose Zeal, in youth had outrun their discretion, have changed that temper into
Retchless profaneness. Others from a dissolute riotous course of life have been
transformed into fiery zealots or Seditious Schismatics.

6. In matters spiritual (whether concerning Manners or Opinion) The natural
man is no better, no wiser, than a natural fool in matters Civil. And many
which are in part spiritual, that is, well reformed in Christian Life and
manners, are but Punies or Novices in matters of Opinion or speculation, or of
small insight in the Sacred Art of Reforming others.

As in War or battle the strength or courage of the common Soldiers is not
sufficient unless they have skilful and well experienced Commanders to direct
their obedience: So for the Reformation of gross abuses or palpable
misdemeanors in Church and Commonweal, the spirit of wisdom and knowledge,
the best gifts of Art and learning, (which for the most part are resident but
in a few) are no less requisite then Sanctity and integrity of Life in the
multitude that are to be governed and directed by them. To give you then the
Aim and scope of our Apostle in this Chapter, the Jews which lived in his
time, or in the times betwixt the building of the second Temple and our
Saviors death, did take upon them to judge their fathers which had lived
before the destruction of Solomon's Temple, for transgressing the Law of God:
and yet by judging them most deservedly, did more manifestly condemn
themselves. For they did the self-same things, though not in kind or in
particular, yet the self-same by Equivalencie. And it is, if not the only, or
whole, yet the principal part of our Apostles intention in this Chapter, to
prove, That even the most zealous Reformers of Religion amongst the Jews did
the very same things which they so mightily condemned in the Heathen, or in
such as were partakers with the Heathens in their idolatrous services; as you
may gather from the seventeenth verse unto the end of the Chapter.

The truth of his General Conclusion will appear, if we first show, How these
later Jews did condemn themselves by judging their Forefathers; or, that they
did the self-same things or worse.

That these did judge their Fathers, as we say, Authoritative, their own
speeches recorded by our Savior will plainly witness. If we had been (say
they) in the days of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them
in the blood of the Prophets, Matthew. 23. v. 29. That they themselves did the
same things, which they condemned in their Fathers, Our Saviors Verdict upon
their hypocrisy in thus saying, puts out of Question. Fill ye up then (says
he) the measure of your Fathers; ye Serpents! ye generation of vipers! how can
ye escape the damnation of Hell? He did not command or impel them to fill up
the measure of their fathers iniquity, but only foresaw that they were
desperately set to fill it up unto the brim. Now they could not fill it up, but
by doing the same things, or worse, then their Fathers had done.

7. But wherein did their Hypocrisy consist? In pretending one thing See Book
4. or justifying Faith Sect. 2.
outwardly to the eyes or ears of men, and concealing another secret purpose
in their hearts? Did they thus speak only Ad faciendum populum, to gain
applause amongst the people? Did they say otherwise then in Conscience they
were persuaded was true? when they said, If we had lived in the days of our
Fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets?

No! To have spoken thus, and not to have thought so, had been gross
profaneness, a branch of Atheism or Infidelity; whereas those men, whom Our
Savior thus taxes, were Scribes and Pharisees, and their hypocrisy was
Pharisaical.

Now Pharisaical hypocrisy, or The Leaven of Pharisees, has always some
ground of Truth, and a great measure of zeal (but of zeal without knowledge or
discretion) to maintain that which it takes for truth, for its Ingredients. The
composition of Hypocrisy Pharisaical.


These Pharisees (which thus spoke, as Truth it self relates of them) had this
ground of truth for their persuasion, That if the Prophets and their Fathers
had lived in their days, they knew themselves so free from those gross abuses
which their Fathers committed, that they would have taken part with the
Prophets against their Fathers: They had the Testimony of their own
Consciences, that they would rather have died themselves then have consented to
the shedding of the Prophets blood upon the same Motives or Occasions which
drew their Fathers to shed it.

How then did they make up the measure of their Fathers iniquity? or accomplish
their sin in shedding the Prophets or other innocent blood? By their
distempered zeal to maintain their Rigid Reformation of the most gross and
palpable abuses, which their Fathers had committed, and for which especially
they had been plagued by God. The diseases themselves they knew (by Gods heavy
hand upon their Fathers) to be most dangerous; and whilst they seek to cure the
same diseases or prevent like plagues by practices quite contrary to the
practices of their Fathers, they secretly nurse more grievous diseases, and
bring more grievous plagues upon themselves and upon their posterity.

8. The Two special Sins for which their Fathers had been plagued, and which
Two special sins of the Ancient Jews.
did include the most gross, and most palpable breach of Gods Commandments
that can be imagined, were Idolatry, and open violation of the Sabbath.

These were sins not only gross and palpable in themselves, but sins
Transcendent, such as did open a wide gap or sluice unto other sins, as well
against the first as the second Table: Sins wherein they did most properly
participate with the Heathens and Infidels. Their Idolatry exceeded the height
of heathenish superstition; and Sabbath breach was the root of more then
heathenish profaneness.

Now that the ancient Jews, as well those of Judah as of Israel, were
remarkably plagued for their Idolatry, as for a grand or capital transgression,
all men know that read the Scripture. That they were likewise plagued in
particular for the profanation of the Sabbath; we may gather from Nehemiah,
Chap. 13. 17. 18. Then I contended with the Nobles of Judah, and said unto
them; What evil thing is this which ye do, and profane the Sabbath day? Did
not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and
upon this City? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel, by profaning the Sabbath.

Their Fathers had been so deeply tainted with this pestilent disease, that
their posterity were not cleansed from it, by seventy years captivity in the
Land of Caldea, but it breaks forth again immediately upon their return unto
the City and Land of their Fathers, which in their absence had enjoyed its
Sabbaths, for it had layen for the most part waste and untilled.

As these two sins of Idolatry and Profanation were most gross, so this
peoples delight in them before this Captivity was great, and the more they
delighted in them, the more impatient they were of reproof; and the more
impatient they were of reproof, the more still they were enraged against Gods
Prophets, that did tax their persons or oppose their practices.

Now as their plagues for these transgressions had been grievous, so their
posterity, after Nehemiah his time, were more zealous and severe in the
Reformation of Idolatry, and breach of Sabbath, then of any other
transgressions. So strictly did they, in after times, observe the Sabbath, that
they made a Conscience of defending themselves against the violent assaults of
their Enemies upon the Sabbath day; and did choose rather to die then to pollute
the Sabbath by making up the breaches made in their walls or fortifications, as
ye may gather, 1 Maccab. 2. And Plutarch (in his Book, De Superstitione) taxes
them for their Folly. (As Iuvenal, Satyr. 14. scorns them for observing the
Rest of the Day.

Quidam sortiti metuentem Sabbata patrem
Judaica ediscunt quae jura volumine Moses
Tradidit arcano: Cui Septima quaeque fuit Lux
Ignava, and partem vitae non attigit ullam.)
Their Fathers sinned grievously, in taking that liberty upon the Sabbath,
which the Law of God had denied them. These later Jews sin in refusing to use
that liberty which God had in some Cases allowed them, or at least in
applauding themselves for their strict Reformation, and condemning others which
in matter of doctrine or practice opposed them. And this their Fervent zeal to
maintain their own Rigid Reformation, did in the issue draw them The Ancient
Jews sins. The later Jews Reformation.
to worse practices then their Fathers had committed in their grossest
profanation of the Sabbath. Their Fathers were not at any time more violently
bent against Esaias, Jeremy, or others of Gods Prophets, who taxt their
scandalous breach of the Sabbath, then these later Jews were bent against our
Savior for not complying with them in their Rigid Reformation of former
abuses. Their Fathers were not more apt to persecute the Prophets, as peevish
disturbers of their peace by reproving their profaneness, then these later
Jews were to persecute our Savior, for a profane Fellow or Sabbath-breaker,
for doing works of mercy and charity upon the Sabbath; albeit he wrought all
his Cures without any manual labor or servile work.

9. The Ancient Jews were so delighted in gross Idolatry, That they left the
house of the Lord God of their Fathers, and served Groves and Idols, by a
common consent of the King and his Princes, as you may read, 2 Chronicles. 24. 17.
And not herewith content, they stoned Zachariah the Son of Jehoida their
High Priest to death in the house of the Lord, for opposing their practice, or
controlling the Kings License, by a Countermand from the Lord, as it is ver.
20, 21. See a following Sermon upon that Fact.
This was a Prodigious Fact, as the later Jews have curiously aggravated it,
and his blood did cry for vengeance, even upon that later generation, which
thought they had so acurately reformed their Forefathers abuses; As Our
Savior tells us, Luke 11. 51. Verily I say unto you, IT, to wit, the blood of
Zacharias shall be required of this generation. But how did these Jews make up
the measure of their Fathers sins which shed Zacharias blood, for dissuading
them from Idolatry? Seeing they did detest this very Fact and the occasions of
it? By no other means then by Over-prizing their Rigid Reformation; and by
their distempered Zeal to maintain it against all that should contradict it. So
far they sought to root out this sin, that they made not only all Causes but
all probable or remote Occasions of renewing Idolatry, to be matter of death;
yea, they did rather choose to die themselves, then to admit so much as an Image
or Picture in their Temple, or upon the walls of it, though set up but for
Historical or Civil use. So vehemently did they distaste and loath the very
conceit of multiplicity of Gods, that this their extreme opposition unto the
Heathens, did so far mis-sway them as they could not be brought to admit a
Distinction of Persons in the Trinity. How often did they accuse our Savior of
blasphemy, for saying he was the Son of God, or God as well as man.

In fine, The chief matter or occasion which they took to persecute our Savior
unto death, was, for that he would not consent unto them either for doctrine or
practice, in their Rigid Reformation of those gross sins which their Fathers
had committed; or in their uncharitable Expositions of the second and fourth
Commandment: He could not away with their Sabbaths Is. 1. 13.

To omit other places for the present; That one place of St. John, chap. 5.
shall suffice. There you may read, ver. 8. that he had cured a man by his mere
word, which had been sick of a grievous infirmity thirty eight years together.
But after the Jews knew that it was Jesus which made him whole, they sought to
slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.

And when our Savior makes this Reply, Pater meus adhuc operatur, and ego
Christ's true Exposition of the Negative part of the fourth Commandment.
operor, giving them a true Exposition concerning the negative Precept of the
Sabbath, which did prohibit only works resembling the works of Creation, not
works resembling Gods everlasting preservation of things created, They sought
the more to kill him, not only because he had broken the Sabbath; but said also
that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. Verse 17, 18.

10. To Parallel both their misdemeanors with the Issues. The Fathers for love
unto heathenish and sense-pleasing Idolatry did forsake their God and the
service of his house wherein he had promised to dwell. These later Jews for
their delight and complacencie in their known freedom from these and the like
particular sins of their fathers, solemnly forsake and utterly disclaim the
same God, even, when according to his promise made to Moses, he had his
Tabernacle among them, and did walk with them (as the ancient Jews expected
their Messiah should) in visible manner. Their fathers slow their High Priest
in the Temple: these in killing Christ did destroy the Temple and Tabernacle of
God; so his body was. Thus to forsake or disclaim their Messiah, they had a
plausible pretense or show of truth; That he whom they saw to be a man, did
take upon him that Authority which was proper to God alone. For so we read
that when he said to one, whom he cured of the palsy, Be of good cheer! thy
sins are forgiven thee: The Scribes and Pharisees which were then present,
began to reason saying, who is this that speaks blasphemy, who can forgive
sins but God alone? And for thus censuring Him, they presumed they had the
warrant of God himself. Isai. 43. 25. I, even I am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. It was most
true what they from this place allege, That God alone can forgive sins. But
from this present miracle, and the manner of our Saviors conversation here on
earth, and their own wicked dealing with him, if they had compared these with
the words immediately precedent in the Prophet, ver. 24. they might have
gathered, that He was that only God which did forgive sins. For so the Prophet
had said unto Israel, in the person of this only God, Thou have made me to
serve with thy sins, thou have wearied me with thy iniquities. This is One of
those many places, which, even by the Jews confessions were evidently meant of
God himself, and yet were never literally and punctually fulfilled or verified
but of God incarnate. For God did never serve with this peoples sins, was never
weary with their iniquities, save only whilst he took the form of a servant
upon him, and bare their sins in his flesh or humane nature.

11. To recollect more briefly the manner how these later Jews did the same
things for which they judged their Fathers, albeit their practices and
dispositions were for the most part clean contrary; as also by what means they
were drawn to make up the measure of their forefathers sins by shedding
innocent blood; it is thus. The ancient Jews did shed the blood of the
Prophets, specially because they severely taxed their Idolatry and breach of
Sabbath; But the true reason why they shed their blood for taxing them, in
these particulars, was, because these and the like practices wherein they
complied with neighbor Nations were the most predominant and plausible humors
of those times; and did command all their other desires or affections. These
later Jews did kill the King of Prophets for opposing the practices of
intended Reformation; but the Reason why they crucified him for opposing them,
especially in the Rigid Reformation of these two sins, was, because secret
pride and desire of applause, amongst the people which professed true Religion,
was most predominant in these times of Reformation, and did oversway all other
desires in the Pharisees. Both of them commit the self same sins even whilst
they follow contrary Practices, because both of them had made themselves
servants to their unruly desires, and would not obey the Truth, but were
enraged against it, whenever it fell cross upon the desire, which for the
time being, was most sovereign and had the prerogative in their affections.

12. Thus you see, how these later Jews condemned themselves by judging their
Forefathers, even for the most abominable Facts or Errors committed Take we
heed of condemning our selves by judging the later Jews.
by them. Let us beware lest we condemn not our selves by judging these later
Jews, especially at this time of solemn remembrance of his death, wherein we
are bound to examine and judge our selves, every man his own self, not any
other man of what Religion or Sect soever. What then? May we not say or think
that these later Jews did most grievously sin (more grievously then their
Forefathers had done) in that they put the Lord of life to death? God forbid,
that we should not thus far censure them! But thus far to censure them and
no farther, is not to judge them, it is such a Preparative or Precedent Rule
for right examining or judging our selves, as Ahab's sentence against the
Prophet, whom he mistook for a Soldier, or David's against the supposed Rich
man, which had taken his Neighbors Sheep, was to judge and condemn themselves:
But say not in your hearts as these later Jews did, If we had lived in the
days of Herod and Pilate we would not have been partakers with them or with
the Pharisees, Scribes or Priests in murdering that Just and Holy One.

I know there is not any amongst you but will say in his heart, I thank God I
am for the present better affected toward Christ then these later Jews were
which put him to death, and whilst ye thus say, Charity commands me to think,
that you speak no otherwise then you think, then you are verily persuaded in
heart. Yet let me entreat you, not to make This or the like persuasion, any
part of that Rule by which you are to examine and judge your selves.

What other Rule then is there left?

Surely for examining our selves, whether we be greater Friends or greater
Enemies unto Christ then these later Jews were, There can be no other certain
See the fourth chapter of this Book, Fol. 3342.
Rule besides our Conformity or Nonconformity to the will of Christ.

Every personal wrong is so much the greater or less, as it more or less
contradicts the Good Pleasure of him that is wronged, if so his Will be
regulated by Reason; or be a Constant Rule of Goodness, as we all believe our
Saviors Will was.

That Saying of the Poet may be true, in some Cases of Divinity:

Invitum qui servat idem facit occidenti. He that persuades a man, ready to die
upon good, to live upon evil Terms, does wrong him no less then he that should
kill him when he was desirous to live.

Our Savior taxes St. Peter more sharply for dissawding him from laying down
his life for us, then he did the Scribes, Priests and Pharisees, for putting
him to a lingering cruel and disgraceful death, then he did Judas for betraying
him. For upon this occcasion he said to Peter: Get thee behind me Satan, for
thou rellishest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
Peter's sin had been as great as Judas his sin, if it had been as habituated and
unrelenting, or if he should have gathered forces for his Rescue. For however
death (such a disgraceful cruel and lingering death as our Savior suffered) was
bitter unto him, and went much against his humane will; or however it more
displeased Him, that the Jews his own people should be willing to put him to
death, then the sufferings of death did: yet he was comparatively far more
willing to suffer the extremity of death and whatsoever they could inflict upon
him besides, then to leave the works of the Devil undissolved either in them or
in us; either in all of us, or in any one of us. For this purpose, says S.
John, The Son of God was manifested that he might dissolve the works of the
Devil. 1 John 3. 8. What were these works of the Devil which he was willing to
dissolve, though it were by dissolution of his soul from his body? These were
sins of all sorts, original and actual; or more punctually, thus: The main work
of Satan which the Son of God came to dissolve, and did by his death actually
dissolve for all and every one of us, was that bond of servitude See Book. 8.
which Satan by right of Conquest had gotten over our first Parents and us. All
of us by right of this Conquest were born slaves of Satan, until the Son of
God, by right of Conquest over Satan obtained in our flesh, did make us again
the servants of God De jure.

He took away the right of Satan, and established his own over us. We are his
servants by peculiar purchase. Now if any man whom the Son of God has redeemed
from this slavery unto Satan (and thus far he has redeemed all) shall return
to Satan's service and abandon the true service of Christ, he wrongs him more
then the Jews did which put him to death; because he was more willing to die
for every one of us, then to suffer the works of Satan to be undissolved, or to
be accomplished in any of us.

13. All of us even from our cradles have learned to take up the Name of a Jew,
as a Proverb; and can take the boldness upon us (as occasion serves) to censure
the Scribes and Pharisees which put our Lord and Savior to death as paternes
of envy, malice, hypocrisy, and cruelty. But were not these very Jews as
forward and free to censure their forefathers (to whom they owed more respect
then we do to them) for Idolatry, profaneness, and guilt of innocent blood;
and thus they censured them without dissimulation or affected zeal. And yet in
thus judging their Fathers, they did condemn themselves, for they did the same
things, or worse. But you will say, It is not possible, that we should do the
same things which these later Jews did, or worse things then they did: For,
Christ cannot be buffeted, cannot be spit upon, cannot be crucified again. Yet
may we do those things (and would to God oft-times we did them not!) which are
more displeasing to him, now enthroned in Heaven, as King, then all that the
Jews did unto him whilst he was in form of a servant here on earth.

It was not the evil which the Jews did to him, as to their professed enemy,
but the evil which was in themselves, as their pride, envy, hypocrisy
uncharitable censuring of others, which made him that made them, to be their
enemy; and him that had been their Protector to fight against them. These are
diseases not Proper to the Jewish Nation, but Epidemical and common to all
Nations and places. The matter of them (as our Apostle in this Chapter
disputes) is alike common to all. But the Jewish Nation came to their Crisis at
Christ's first appearance in humility. Our Critical Day is not to be expected
until his second appearing in Majesty and glory: Then, nothing which lies hid
in the heart, but shall be laid open; then and not before will all enmity
betwixt the serpent and the woman's seed appear. And, in that day it shall be
more tolerable for them which crucified him then for us; unless we take
warning by Gods known Judgments upon them and their seed; to avoid those
practices and accustomances which wrought and swayed them by means secret and
unsensible to exercise enmity and hostility against their Lord, their Maker
and Redeemer.

14. And here my purpose was to have used the former Parallel betwixt the
Ancient Jews which killed the Prophets, and the later, which, condemning them
for so doing, did not withstanding kill our Savior; as a Map whereby to show
you in what particulars, many in this Land, who not content with that discreet
and judicious Reformation, which is contained in the public Acts and Liturgy
of our Church, by their solicitous care and anxious zeal to be extremely
contrary unto the Romish Church almost in all things, do by judging her and her
children, condemn themselves doing the very same things, or worse things then
she does, and help to make up that measure of iniquity upon this Land, which
the Romish Religion whilst it was here authorized had left unaccomplished; But
for this point and others which serve for use and application of the general
Doctrine hitherto delivered, this present time will not suffice. The
Application shall be brief. Take heed you measure not your love to truth by
your opposition unto error. If hatred of error and superstition spring from
sincere love of truth and true Religion, the root is good, and the branch is
good. But if your love to truth and true Religion spring from hatred to others
error and superstition, the root is naught, and the branch is naught; There can
no other fruit be expected, but hypocrisy, hardness of heart, and uncharitable
censuring others.

CHAP. XXXVIII.
The Second Sermon upon this Text.
ROMANS. 2. 1. Therefore, Thou art inexcusable O man, etc.
1. THe Points worthy our Consideration are Three.

First, How our Fore-elders in the beginning of Reformation, and many amongst
us since the Reformation established, did or do condemn themselves whilst they
judge the Romish Church in particulars worthy of Condemnation by all.

Secondly, How the Romish Church in General, and many professing Reformed
Religion, condemn themselves, even whilst they judge the Jews in Points most
gross and damnable.

Thirdly, How, not the Romish Church only, or the Jewish Synagogue, but many
amongst Professors of true Religion, men in Opinion, Orthodoxal, evidently
condemn themselves, whilst they judge or censure the very Idolatry of the
Heathen.

The Points for which one Church or Nation, one sort of People or generation of
men may judge another, either concern matters of Manners and practice; or
matters of Opinion and doctrine; or matters mixed, that is, Errors in Opinion,
which induce misdemeanors in practice. If Errors there be any, which do not
draw after them dangerous or ungodly Practices, these rather deserve pity or
toleration, then Rigid Censure. But Doctrinal Errors, which induce lewd
practices, are more dangerous, more to be detested then the most gross or
lewdest practices into which some men fall, being not mislead or drawn into
them by Plausible Errors or false doctrine. Practices, how gross soever, if
they want the supportance or Countenance of Doctrinal Rules, pollute the souls
and consciences of the parties peccant, they are not so powerful to seduce
others. But Misdemeanors or perverse Affections being coutenanced by Pretense
or Color of sacred. Authority, are most infectious. Briefly, there is no
false Doctrine, but it is an Inconvenience, whereas grosser misdemeanors
without error in doctrine, are but Mischiefs. And it is a Maxim received by the
most sage and prudent, that Better is a Mischief then an Inconvenience, or at
least, an Inconvenience is worse then a Mischief. But worst of all is an
Inconvenience, which draws Mischief after it; and such is every Error in
Doctrine, which inclines or disposes men to evil practices, or which does
leaven or malignifie the affections of the heart naturally bad or but
indifferent.

That which our Fore-elders did most condemn in the Romish Church, or at least
that which they went about to reform, was the Excessive Wealth which the Church
or Clergy had gotten into their possession, with the Transcendent Authority
of the Papacy, by which they sought to detain what they had gotten, or to
gather more.

Whatever the manner of getting their wealth or Revenues was, the manner of
using or employing them was exceeding bad, and did deserve, yea require a
Reformation. Our Fore-elders did well in judging the Clergy for abusing
Revenues sacred, to the maintenance of idleneness, superstition and idolatry.
But would to God they had not condemned themselves by judging them, or that
they had not done the same things wherein they judged them. Happy had it been
for them, and for their posterity, if those large Revenues which they took from
such as abused them, had been employed to pious uses; As
either to the maintenance of true Religion, or to the support of the needy,
or to prevent oppressing by extraordinary Taxes, or the like. This had been an
undoubted effect of pure Religion and undefiled before God. But it was not the
different Estate or condition of the parties, on whom Church Revenues were
bestowed, that could give warrant unto their Alienation, or which might bring a
blessing upon their intended Reformation, but the Uses unto which they were
consecrated, or the manner how they were employed.

Now the manner of their employment, no man, whose Ancestors have been Parties
in this business, will take upon him to justify. Nor have the posterity of
such as were at that time most enriched with the spoils of the superstitious
Church, any great cause to rejoice at their Ancestors easy purchase. It was a
practice just and right, as being authorized by God himself, that the
Israelites should despoile the Egyptians of their costly earrings and gaudy
jewels. But albeit the Israelites, who were the borrowers, had better right
unto them then the Egyptians, which did lend them; yet much better had it been,
if the Egyptians had either not lent them, or after the lone recovered them,
than that they should have afforded, as they did, both matter and opportunity
for erecting golden Calves in Israel. And of two Evils it had been the less,
if the Churches Revenues had been possessed by their first Owners; and not been
mis-imployed in riot, luxury and other branches of profaneness, whereby the
measure of this Lands Iniquity was rather augmented then diminished; however,
the nutriment of superstition and Idolatry, was by this means abated. But be
our Fore-elders fault, if not in alienating, yet in mis-imploying, Church
Revenues, as it may be, worse then superstition, equivalent to Idolatry it
self: it was in no wise the fault of Reformed Religion nor of the Reformers of
it; it must be charged upon the mainteiners of superstition: For at the
Dissolution of Abbeys and other Religious Houses, there was no Public
Reformation of Religion attempted, save only, the denial or Abjuration of the
Popes Transcendent Authority and Restoration of the King unto his ancient and
hereditary right of Jurisdiction, in Causes Ecclesiastic. Nor was that
Boisterous King so much to blame in dissolving material Temples or houses
(rather abused then consecrated to superstition) as he was, after this
Reformation (if so it may be called) in destroying so many living Temples of
God, which sought not the dissolution of his Kingdom, nor any other Reformation
of him and his people save only the clearing and purifying of their hearts and
breasts, (which had been consecrated unto Gods service) from the infection of
Romish superstition and Idolatry.

2. Idolatry was that, which in the first place required Reformation, because
it did pollute the whole service of God. And I think it would be hard to find
any generation of Christian men since the first plantation of Christianity,
which did more abhor idols, or adoration of images in the Church, then the
first Reformers of that Religion which we now profess did; witness Those
learned Homilies against the peril of Idolatry. And yet, would to God, that
many of those times of high authority, and most zealously forward in the work
of Reformation had not condemned themselves by judging the Romish Church, or
their fore Elders which lived in it. Or that our Apostles censure of the Jews
hate or opposition unto Gentilism, had not fallen as jump and fit upon the
times of Edward the sixth, as it did upon the times and people to whom it was
first purposely fitted.
Our fore Elders (especially the Nobility and Gentry of those times) did abhor
idols no less then the Jews did; and yet did commit more gross and palpable
sacrilege, then the Jews to my observation, at any time had done.

And what could it boot them to deface Images or pull down Idols in the
material Churches, so long as by their very spoils, they nourished that Great
Idol, Covetousness, in their own hearts: Thus to seek to enrich themselves or
fill their private Coffers with the spoils of Abbeys or Churches, or by Tithes
and offerings, was but to continue the practice of the Prelacie or Clergy, in
destroying Parishes to erect Monasteries; or demolishing lesser Religious
houses to build up others more sumptuous, more Luxurious.

3. Many, at this day there be, which out of zeal, complain that the Laws
against superstition and Idolatry are not severe enough: and there is no
moderate man (unless of the Romish faction) but could wish, that such laws as
have been made for suppressing the growth of it were more constantly more
impartially executed then they are. In all this neither of them are to blame.
And yet by soliciting Gods cause and the cause of true Religion against the
mainteiners of superstition and Idolatry, we shall but solicit our own
condemnation, unless we bear a like zealous desire and good affection for the
depressing and rooting out of all sacrilegious Practices or Opinions. And yet
seriously to attempt the Reformation of this foul sin, which is Equivalent to
Idolatry, and has the same burden of Gods curse, would be a matter (I am
persuaded) as full of difficulty and danger in this Land; as to attempt the
defacing of Images in the Church of Rome, or in any Province subject to her
Jurisdiction. But the further prosecution of this point would better befit an
Audience of Statesmen of Parliament Men, or Lawyers, then this place or
Audience. Only let me forewarn you, That your Predecessors have been grievous
offenders in this kind, witness the short revenues or poor Endowments of your
goodly Churches.

4. But this sin of sacrilege or Church robbing has been, though not common to
all, yet in a manner peculiar to such, as exercise the Co-active Power of
Reformation. The Clergy, in whom the Power directive was, did either not at
all or unwillingly partake with them in this offense; they have been and are
the Patients, that is, the men which suffer wrong, not Doers of wrong in this
kind. And if we set aside those Points of Romish Religion, which did not come
to opposition or counterpoize with Power Royal, or with the Interest of
Potentates or commodities of private men; The Reformation made by our fore
elders in other points of Doctrine was judicious and Religious. They did no way
condemn themselves by judging the Romish Church. The judgment which they
exercised was the judgment of the Lord. The Reformation which they intended
and accomplished was The Lords doing. But many which have enjoyed the benefit
of that wholesome Reformation, and of true Christian liberty restored by it,
have not submitted themselves, their opinions or Practices to the Laws or
Rules prescribed by it. Many have taken upon them, and yet do, not only to
judge or censure the Romish Church, but even to condemn the Reformation of
their Ancestors, as if it did to this day savor of the superstition from which
it was severed: of those men I only speak, which out of an hatred, Antipathy or
loathing the Romish Church, do cast themselves out of all Churches, and will be
members of none, unless they may be heads of some one new one of their own
making, or of some that has no real pattern or Module save only in their own
busy heads or brains.

5. To instance in some particular errors into which, the very hate of Romish
errors has transported them, One of the most weighty Masses of A Romish error
requiring Reformation.
Popery which required Reformation and Refining, was, that they made The
Church, which in their Language, was, the body of the Clergy, A body Politic
or kingdom distinct from the body of the Layetie: holding even Christian Kings
and Emperors to be Magistrates merely Temporal or civil, altogether excluded
from meddling in affairs Ecclesiastic. Now this being granted, the Supreme
Majesty of every kingdom, State, or nation, should be wholly seated in the
Clergy: The greatest Kings and Christian Monarchs on earth should be but mere
vassals to the Ecclesiastic Hierarchy; or at the most, in such subordination
to it, as Foreign Generals and Commanders in chief are to the States or
Soveraignties which employ them, who may displace them at their pleasure,
whenever they shall transgress, or not execute their instructions or
Commissions. For this reason (as in the handling of the first verses of the 13.
Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans has been declared unto you before) All
the disputes or Laws concerning the Supremacy of Kings or Free States within
their own Dominions were to no purpose, unless this Root of mischief and
Rebellion be taken away, which makes the Clergy a body politic or Commonweal
Ecclesiastic altogether distinct from the Layetie-Christian. Now this
erroneous Root of mischief has been well removed by the Articles of Religion
established in this Church and Land, Article the 37. wherein, The same
authority and power is expressly given to the Kings of this Realm and their
successors, which was in use and practice amongst the Kings of Judah, and the
Christian Emperors, when kingdoms and Commonweals did first become Christian.
The Law of God and of nature, will not suffer the Sovereign Power in Causes
Ecclesiastic to be divorced from the Supreme Majesty of any Kingdom or free
Soveraigntie truly Christian.

But what be the contrary Errors, into which, such as take upon them to be
Reformers of the Reformation already made, have run headlong? Or how do they
the same things wherein they judge the Romanists? The Romanists (as they well
observe) deserve condemnation by all Christian States, for appropriating the
Name or Sovereign Dignity of the Church unto the Clergy, and by making the
Prerogative of Priests and Prelates to be above the Prerogatives of Kings and
Princes. The Contrary faction of Reformers An Error of the Contraire extreme,
disparaging The Reformation.
not content to deprive the Clergy of those civil Immunities and privileges,
wherewith the Law of God, the Law of Nations, and the Fundamental Law of this
Kingdom, have endowed them; will have them to be no true members of the
Commonweal or Kingdom wherein they live; Or at the best, but such Inferior
members of the Commonweal, as the Papists make the Layetie to be of the
Church; men that shall have no voice in making those Coercive Laws, by which
they are to be governed and to govern their flocks; yea men that shall not have
necessary voices in determining controversies of Religion, or, in making Rules
and Canons for preventing Schism. I should have been afraid to believe thus
much of any sober man professing Christianity, unless I had seen A book to
this purpose, perused (as is pretended in the Frontispice) by the Learned in
the Laws. But the Author has wisely concealed his own name, and the names of
those learned in the Laws, A Factious Schismatical Book, modestly Censured.
which are (in gros^^ pretended for its Approbation; And therefore I shall
avoid suspicion of aiming at any particular out of mis-affection to his person,
in passing this general Censure. No man could have had the heart to write it,
no man the face to read it, without blushing or indignation, but he that was
altogether unlearned, and notoriously ignorant in the Law of God, in the Law of
nature, and in the Fundamental points of Christianity.

6. All Errors in this kind proceed from these Originals.

First, The Authors of them (Charity may hope, by Incogitancie or want of
consideration, rather than out of Malice) seek to subject the Clergy unto the
same Rule unto which the Church was subject for the first 300. years after
Christ; during which time the Kings and Emperors, under which the Christians
lived, were Heathens. And whilst the chief Governors were such, no Christians
could exercise Coercive Authority, as to Fine, imprison, or banish any that
did transgress the Laws of God or of the Church. The Apostles themselves
could use no other manner of punishment, Apostolical and Episcopal Power under
heathen Princes; and after Princes were Christianed.
besides delivering up to Satan, Excommunication, or inhibition from hearing
the word, or receiving the Sacraments.

Secondly, the Authors of the former Errors consider not, That whilst the
Church was in this subjection to mere Civil and not Christian Power; the
Lay-Christians of what rank soever, though noble men by birth, were as
straightly confined and kept under, as were the Clergy. Yea the Clergy in
those times had greater authority over Lay-Christians, then any other men had;
Authority much greater over the greatest, then any besides the Romish Prelates
do this day challenge over the meanest of their flocks. But after Kings and
Emperors and other supreme Magistrates were once converted to the Christian
Faith, their dignities were no whit abated, but gained this Addition to their
former Titles, that they were held supreme Magistrates in Causes Ecclesiastic:
That is, they had power of calling Councils and Synods for quelling Schisms and
Heresies in the Church; power likewise to punish the Transgressors of such Laws
or Canons, as had been made by former Godly Bishops or Prelates which lived
under Heathen States; or of such as the Bishops or Clergy, which lived under
their Government, should make for the better Government of Christ's Church. Unto
punishments merely spiritual which the Apostles and Bishops had formerly, only,
used; Christian Emperors added punishments temporal, as imprisonment of body,
loss of goods exile, or death; according to the nature and quality of the
transgression. But that any Laws or Canons were made by Christian Kings or
Emperors, for the Government of the Church; or that any Controversies in
Religion were determined without the Express Suffrages and Consents of Bishops
and Pastors, though all ways ratified by the Soveraigntie of the Nation or
State for whom such Canons were made, no man until these days wherein we live
did ever question.

7. And of such as question, or oppose Episcopal Authority in these Cases, I
must say (as once before out of this place in like case I did) If Heathen they
be in heart and would persuade the Layetie again to become Heathens, their
Resolutions are Christian; at least their conclusions are such, as a good
Christian living under Heathens, would admit. But if Christians they be in
heart and profession, their Conclusions are heathenish or worse. For what
Heathen did ever deny their Priests the chief stroke The Ancient Heathens gave,
(and Turks give) more to their Priests, then some professing Christianity do to
theirs; both for Power and Maintenance.
or sway in making Laws or ordinances concerning the Rites or service of their
Gods, or in determining Points Controverted in Religion? To conclude this
Point; The men that seek to be most contrary to the Romish Church, and are most
forward to judge her for enlarging the Prerogative of Priesthood beyond its
ancient bounds, do the same things she does, by Equivalencie, and run to the
same End by a quite contrary way. The Romish Church (it cannot be denied) makes
her Popes and Prelates, with other Pillars of their Church, plain Idols. They
which out of an undiscreet and furious zeal, seem most to abhor this kind of
Idolatry, commit Sacrilege, and rob God of his honor, as the Romish Church
does. And he that robs God of his honor, does the very same thing and no
other, which an Idolater does. Now they are said in Scripture to rob God of his
honor, and to commit an abomination more then heathenish (for the heathen do
not spoil their Gods) which defraud him of his tithes and offerings, which were
due unto the Priest for his ministration and service in Gods House. But they
rob God of his honor more immediately and more directly, which despise or
contemn his Ambassadors, not in word only, but in taking that Authority from
them which he has expressly given unto them; and which is worst of all, in
seeking to alienate it unto them, over whom, he has in matter of salvation
appointed them Guides and Overseers.

That Precept of our Apostle I am sure will stand good, when all Laws, or A
Precept will be in force, when pretenses will be out of date.
Intendments of Laws to confront it, will fail. Obey them that have the rule
over you, and submit your selves, Heb. 13. 17.

What Rule does he mean? merely Civil or Temporal? No! What then?
Ecclesiastic? Not that only, But the Rule of Government spiritual, such as is
proper to the Bishops of the Church; For so it follows; for they (to whom you
are to submit your selves) watch for your souls, as they that must give an
account; and you are therefore to obey that they may do their office with joy,
and not with grief; for that (says the Apostle) is unprofitable for you.

Now, that in this plenty of preaching and frequencie in hearing, The most
hearers profit so little in the School of Christ; the true Reason is, for that
men do not submit themselves unto their Pastors in such sort as they ought, but
think it his Duty or Office, only to preach, and their duty only to hear; not
to be Ruled or Governed by him, whereas the ones preaching is vain, and the
others hearing is vain, unless this duty of obedience be first planted in their
hearts. The Pastors Grief which arises from neglect or contempt of this Duty,
will prove in the issue the Peoples Curse.

8. But the main stream of Popery, from which the name of Babylon is derived
unto Rome, was the Absolute Infallibility of the Romish Church Representative.
The main Error of the Romish Church, Infallibility; both in expounding holy
Scripture, and in attesting Traditions. See the second and third Books.


The branches of this supposed absolute Infallibility were Two.

The First, That the sense of Scriptures, which that Church does maintain or
avouch concerning Faith or Manners, is always Authentic, undoubted and true.

But whereas many Points, as well of Doctrine as Practice, concerning Faith and
Manners, were in that Church established by Prescription and Use, without so
much as any Pretense of warrant from Scripture; They were enforced in the
Second Place to maintain, That the Unwritten Traditions of the Church were of
equal Authority with the Scriptures, and that the present Church was as
Infallible in her Testimony of the One, as in her Judgment of the other. The
Infallible Consequence of which supposed Infallibility, is This, That the
people were absolutely to believe whatsoever that Church should propound unto
them, as a Point of faith or practice commendable; and to abjure whatsoever
that Church should condemn for heresy, or ungodliness. By Absolute Belief or
obedience, they intend a belief or obedience, not only without Condition or
scruple in the first undertaking, but without Reservation of appeal, upon any
new discovery of dangers, unseen, unsuspected in the first undertaking. The
Churches Authority once declared, was in their Divinity sufficient to quell or
put to silence, all succeeding Replies or mutterings of Conscience.

Both these dangerous Errors were well Reformed; The later stream or The Two
former Romish Errors well Reformed.
puddle of Traditions, in a manner drained by this Church and State. For, every
Bishop at his Consecration does solemnly promise or vow, not to propound any
thing to the people as a Point of Faith, unless it be either expressly contained
in the Scripture, or may be thence deduced by necessary Inference, To bind or
tie all Bishops thus solemnly unto the observance of this Rule, the wisdom of
those Times had these Reasons: Not only to curb or restrain the licentious
Abuse of Bishops former Authority, but because they knew that the people were
in many Cases (concerning the service of God and other Christian duties) bound
to yield more credence and obedience to their Bishops and Pastors then unto men
not called to Sacred or Pastoral Function. It is One Thing to believe any
Doctrinal Proposition as A Point of Faith necessary to salvation; Another to
believe it so far as we may safely adventure upon any practice or duty enjoined
by superiors, That is, to believe it, not Absolutely but Conditionally, and out
of such belief to obey them, not absolutely but conditionally, that is, with
reservation of freedom or liberty, when either the truth shall be better
discovered then now it is, or greater dangers appear then for the present we do
suspect. The Obedience which we give unto Superiors may be Ex Fide, of Faith,
albeit the points of doctrine, or the persuasions out of which we yield this
obedience, be not De Fide, No points of Faith or necessary to salvation.

9. But a great many well-meaning men there were, who shortly after this happy
Reformation, could not content themselves to stand upon such sure Terms of
Contradiction unto the Romish Church, as the first Reformers had done; but
sought in this Point (which was indeed above all others to be abhorred) to be
most extremly Contrary unto her.

Wherein then does that Contradiction to the Romish Church (wherein the first
Reformers of Religion did entrench themselves;) and wherein does The Temper and
Bounds of the Right and Rigid Reformer.
the Extreme Contrariety, whereunto others, more Rigid Reformers, if they
could have effected their Projects, would have drawn this Church and Land,
consist?

The Romish Church, as you heard before, did make Unwritten Traditions a Part
of the Rule of Faith, as sovereign as the written Word of God, and did obtrude
those observances, which had no other warrant then such Tradition, as
altogether necessary to salvation.

The First Reformers of this Error were contented to contradict them only in
this. And their Contradiction is expressly maintained, partly in the Articles
The Cure of the Error, by the Right Mean.
of Religion, partly in the Book of Consecration of Bishops. The Contradiction
is This; That all things necessary to salvation are contained in Scripture;
which is all one as to say, That the Scripture is the only Rule of Faith. Yet
did they not for all this utterly reject All use of Tradition, or Ceremonies,
as you may find expressed in the thirty fourth Article; in which, though Rites
and Ceremonies, or other customs of the Church be not enjoined in particular
(as they take for granted) by God himself; yet obedience is due unto them in
particular, and they which disobey or transgress them in any particular are to
be punished or made Examples, lest others be emboldened to do the like. And the
Reason why they would have such punished (which I would request you to observe)
is, lest their impunity should minister offense to the weak brethren; And a man
cannot give greater offense to the weak or ignorant, then by emboldening them
to disobedience, in Cases, wherein obedience is due.

But soon after these Public Injunctions, other Private Spirits rose up, which
out of desire to be Extremely Contrary to the Romish Church, concerning
Traditions, did expressly contradict their Lawful Governors in that Article.

The Contrary Error into which they run (by seeking to avoid the error of the
Romish Church) was, in brief, This; That no Christian man is bound to obey
superiors in matters of sacred Rite or Ceremony, or in Duties of ordinary
practice, unless their Governors, or such as demand their Obedience, can show
them express Authority of Scripture; or can convince their understandings The
Error extremely Contrary to the Romish Error.
that God by his Word does enjoin them to obey in these particulars.

But thus to oppose the Romish Church by way of Contrariety, is but to seek
the overthrow of a Tyranny by the Erection of an Anarchie. For if the Flock or
inferior members of the Church, owe no obedience unto their superiors, but upon
these Terms, then Pastors, Prelates, yea Kings, should owe the same obedience
unto the meanest Tradesmen or Day-labourers, that Tradesmen or Day-labourers
own to them. For Pastors, and Prelates, even Kings themselves are bound to
obey the Word of God by whomsoever it shall be manifested or made known unto
them, and to obey it in every particular which it manifestly injoynes. And if
obedience were not due to Pastors, Prelates and Kings in matters concerning the
service of God or sacred Rites, until they can show warrant for every
particular, which they enjoin, out of Gods word, there were no obedience at all
due unto them, but unto Gods Word only; And every man might say to them as the
Emperor said to the Pope, Non Tibi sed Petro. But so, the Sacred Rule of Faith
and manners, should be not the Author of such Order as we believe it is; but an
occasion of confusion in every Christian Estate or Congregation.

10. But this is the happiness of the English Church or Clergy, that all the
Arguments which have been or can be brought by Factious or discontented spirits
in matters of Rites, Ceremonies, or Discipline, do draw their strength from
such false or mistaken Principles, as if way were given to their growth, or
exercise of their force, they could not peck the least hole in the Miter or
make the least thirle in the Surpellice without working a proportionable crack
or flaw in the Royal Crown; Their Authors disobedience to Laws or Discipline
Ecclesiastic would quickly induce, if opportunity served, open rebellion
against the Prerogative Royal.


Reason and Experience had taught the Heathen Statesmen, That it was a matter
of like sufferance or equally insufferable to live Ubi omnia Licita, et ubi
nihil Licitum: In A State wherein all must be subject to the Will of One man,
and in a place where every man may do what he will. A Tyran is like a Ravenous
Beast, which devours all that comes within his Walk or Range; but, which, there
are many ways for a wise man to escape. But if a Tyranny once dissolve into
an Anarchie, Homo homini fit Lupus; every man becomes a Wolf unto his
neighbor; Their habitations or places of meeting become but nests of waspes or
serpents.

11. Let Rome then be accounted as it was when our Forefathers departed from
it, and as it still remains the spiritual Babylon. Let the Pope be a Tyran more
cruel and Barbarous then Nebuchadnezzar or Belshazzar; yet let us remember,
that when God called his people out of Babylon, he called them unto Jerusalem,
which is by interpretation the vision of peace; A city, as the Psalmist, in
the literal sense, perhaps meant, compacted: But in the mystical or
Emblematical sense, a City at unity in it self. The long Durance of an hard and
foreign yoke, had taught them subjection unto their native Governors,
Zerubbabel their Prince, and Jesus their High Priest. The hatred, contempt and
scorn, which they had endured amongst barbarous Aliens, was a Cement to unite
their hearts in brotherly affections. But we by misimploying our peace, and
security of dread from the Enemy, have turned the Grace of God into
wantonness, and transformed that Christian Liberty which our forefathers
purchased with their Ashes, into such Licentiousness, In his Sermon before the
King upon Jer. 26. page 32. he says, divide the sins of 40. years last past
into ten parts, the sins of the Pulpit and the Press would be a large Tenth.
See signs of the Times. page 57. 58.
as if we had departed out of Babylon to build a Babel in Jerusalem. How have
our Printing-houses become the Cells and Arcenals of strife and contention? And
our Pulpits been made Babels or Towers of Confusion? When the men which came
from the East, attempted to build a Tower unto Heaven, God as you know
confounded their Language, that they could not understand one another, and the
enterprise was dissolved, and the enterprizers were dispersed over the face of
the earth. This was the Lords doing and therefore it was a confusion which did
not end in Contention. Though one of them did not understand another; Yet we do
not read, but that every man did well understand himself. But our misery is,
that every one will over-understand another when he does not half-understand
himself, or the matter whereof he writes or speaks, and so raises contention
without an Adversary, and builds up a Babel without help; making a confusion
without mixture of Language, only by pouring out his own simplicity, ignorance
and malice, and making no conscience of taking Gods Name in vain, quoting
Scripture to no other end then to countenance blasphemy, or to dazzle the eyes
of the unlearned, whilst he transforms the Nature and Goodness of God, into
worse similitudes then the Papists or Heathen do; One while speaking against
Arminians, another while unwittingly pleading for them; one Page containing a
comfortable Use or Application, whereas in the next before and after it, he
has laid the Doctrinal Foundations of despair, or more then desperate
presumption. Thus to contradict themselves is so familiar and natural unto
them, that they cannot endure to be contradicted by any others, which in the
spirit of meekness would show them the way, how they might maintain all those
Conclusions, which they so much labor for, and that without giving advantage
to the Adversaries, without dissension or disagreeing from themselves.

12. These are the men that must be disclaimed, as no true members of the
English Church, or at least no fit Expositors of her Tenets: Otherwise, we
shall be enforced to grant that our Church participates as well of Babel or
Beth-aven, as of Bethel. I have been the bolder to insist the longer upon This
Point, because some of good place and Authority in the Church and Commonweal
take notice, That some unlicensed and scandalous pamphlets, Schismatical and
Seditious books, find no where better welcome or entertainment then in this
Town. And wise men I hope will account it a work of charity rather then of
cruelty to take Rats-bane from children, albeit they should long after it more
greedily then after any wholesome meat. Or if any be so stubborn, as not to part
with this poison by gentle persuasions, the only Remedy must be to exclude
them from communicating with others in the food of life. For us, Dearly
beloved, let us, in the bowels of Christ Jesus I beseech you, content our
selves with the Reformation already established by Authority. It is no time to
sally out against the Adversary in single bands or scattered companies; but
rather with the joint forces of our united affections, of prayers, and
endeavors; either to batter the Foundation of their Churches walls, or manfully
to defend our own; keeping our selves within the bounds, whereunto authority
has confined us. The common Adversaries of the Truth which we profess, want
no strength of wit, or weapons of Art, to work upon all advantages, which our
ignorance, negligence, indiscretion, or dissension may present unto them. And
this one great advantage they have of us, that we for the most part fight (as
it were) every man upon his own head, without the advice or appointment of our
chief Leaders and Commanders. So do not our Adversaries; they have the perfect
Discipline of War; And I cannot but approve his wish, That either they had our
vine, or we their fence. And it is a Rule to be observed as well in spiritual
warfare as in any others, yea most especially in it;

-- Arma tenenti
Omnia dat qui justa negat:
By denying that to our Adversaries whereto they have fair Title out of Gods
Word, or out of Venerable Orthodoxal Antiquity, we shall but betray the true
Cause (which we maintain against them,) in main and Fundamental Points, which,
if we would wisely maintein them, are most defensible. Observe I beseech you
what has been said unto you, and the God of wisdom and of peace, give you
understanding in all things profitable to your Salvation.

1. ANother Doctrinal Point there was maintained by the Romish Church, when our
Fathers departed from it, which required Reformation. And this Point contains
all the several Tenets of that Church, which did occasion or nurse Doubt of
Salvation or Perplexity of Conscience in every private man so often as he
should examine his Estate in Grace, his hopes or Interest in Gods mercy or
promises to all.

First then, by Gods assistance, Of the General Error or that branch of it
Three Points purposed.
which especially required Reformation.

Secondly, Of the Contrary Error or Inconveniences into which many by
Curiosity of Reformation have run.

Thirdly, Of the True Mean, or Orthod oxal Doctrine which the Reformers of our
Church did hold and maintain, and have delivered unto us in the Public Acts of
the Church approved and ratified by the General Consent of this Kingdom.

The Error of the Romish Church was Doubt of Salvation: with This Error, that
Church has been often charged by all the best writers of Reformed Churches.
But sometimes, or by some men in those Churches, not upon A Romish Eror,
causing Doubt of Salvation. viz The intention of the Priest etc.
so Evident Ground as it might be charged. For some there be which charge this
Error directly upon their Tenet concerning The Nature of Faith or Hope.

But, for their Defense, if we join issue with them upon those Terms, they have
more to say, then they can have, if we charge this Error upon their Doctrine
concerning The Intention of the Priest in the Administration of the Sacraments,
By whose hidden virtue Faith and Hope are begotten and increased. For, how much
soever they may seem to magnify The Sacraments of the New Testament in respect
of the Sacraments of the Law (as, that they confer Grace upon the receivers
of them Ex Opere operato, by the very Sacramental action, which the Sacraments
of the Law did not,) Yet, all this being granted, no man can be more certain of
his Estate in Grace, then he is of the good Intention of the Priest which
administered the Sacraments. Now this Assurance or persuasion of the Priests
Intention can be no sure Ground of Faith truly Christian.

2. The Sacrament of Baptism they hold to be absolutely necessary unto
Salvation; and that, All such infants as die without Baptism are excluded from
the Kingdom of Heaven. And yet they hold withal, that Unless the Priest, when
he comes to Baptize any Infant, do intend to do what the Church appoints him to
do, the Baptism is invalid or of none effect; albeit he use the Formal Words
of Baptism, and apply the Sacramental element to the body of the Infant
presented by the solemn prayers of the Church, or Congregation present. Besides
the solemn Pronunciation of the Words [I Baptize thee in the Name of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;] and the washing of the body in
water, there must be Interior mentis intentio, the internal Intention of the
Priests mind, must jointly concur with the Word and Sacrament, or rather with
the Holy Ghost, for producing the Invisible Grace or Gift of the Spirit which
is the proper Effect of the Sacrament. So that how well soever the Parents, the
Friends and neighbors assembled demean themselves, at or before the
performance of this Sacred Act, yet every Infant brought to the Sacred Laver
may be Two Ways remedilesly prejudiced by the Priest, to the ruin of its soul
or loss of salvation.

First, It may be deprived of the fruit or benefit of this Sacrament (which A
Romish Priest may damn an Infant through neglect or malice: by the Doctrine of
that Church.
is by their Doctrine absolutely necessary to salvation) by the mere negligence
or carelessness of the Priest, as in Case he forget in heart or mind to intend
his duty, of doing that which the Church in like Case usually does or appoints
to be done; whatsoever else he do or say, all is nothing, it is no Baptism.

Secondly, The Infant may be so far prejudiced, as is said, by the malice or
impiety of the Priest. As in Case he be so wickedly disposed, as secretly to
subtract or withdraw his Intention by any interposed condition or Limitation
though not expressed, the Baptism is invalid, or of no effect. To give you One
of their own Instances or Ruled Cases. If one should come to one of their
Priests and request him to baptize such a man's child, naming his Parents, and
he shall thus with himself resolve. If this very child be brought unto me I
intend to do to him as the Church enjoins; but if any other be presented unto
me I have no Intention to baptize him, however I use the words of Baptism and
wash him with water. The Resolution of their Doctors is, that in Case another
child be brought unto the Font, and not that Individual child for which he was
first spoken unto, he shall have no benefit by his Baptism.

3. For a Priest to make such secret Conditions limitations or reservations,
the Romish Doctors acknowledge to be a wicked and sacrilegious part; But this
is all the comfort which the Infant, presumed to be baptized, or his Parents
can have, if the Priest be disposed to be thus malicious. That the Intention of
the Priest is necessarily required, not only by way of Precept, or to the
better administration of the Sacrament, but Necessitate Medii, as a means so
necessary that without it there can be no Sacrament at all; not their
Schoolmen or private Doctors only, but some of their General Councils have
declared. For the Council of Florence makes this Intention of the Priest to be
of the Sea Soto. in 4. Senten. dis. 1. Q. 5. Art. 8.
very Essence of the Sacrament: Now, Essentia non Suscipit magis and minus. If
the Priests Intention be of the Essence of this Sacrament, it must be as
necessary as the Intention of the holy Ghost.

And yet their later Doctors are in this point more Rigid then the ancient
were, which lived not long after the Council of Florence. For Thomas of Aquine,
the great Master of the modern Jesuits, required only an habitual Intention,
his Scholars, the Jesuits, always required a virtual Intention, which is more
then an habitual.

Again, whereas some of their Doctors in Ages past did think it a Probable
Opinion, which might without Censure of impiety be believed, that in Case
ordinary Priests were negligent or otherwise defective in the administration of
the Sacraments; the High Priest of our souls (to wit, Christ Jesus) might or
would supply their defect or negligence: Zuares, a late great Doctor in that
Church, censures the Author of this opinion for his zeal without discretion.
And Soto, another great Doctor, who was present at the Council of Trent,
peremptorily denies all relief or remedy from Christ to any Infant, in Case the
Priest will be so wicked, as either not to Intend to do what the Church does
appoint, or to withdraw his Intention or purpose to do him good by baptizing
him. If the Priest purpose to remit his sins by Baptism, they are remitted by
Christ: if he purpose not to remit them, but to retain them, they are not
remitted, but retained by Christ.

4. Besides the Sacrament of Baptism, and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,
which Two, the Reformed Churches only acknowledge instituted by Christ, as
generally necessary to salvation, the Romish Church presses Three other upon
all Lay People, as necessary unto their salvation, Ex necessitate praecepti,
that is, they are bound in duty to receive them, and in Case they omit them
when they may have them, they forfeit their interest in Gods promises. And
those are the Sacrament of Confirmation; the Sacrament of Absolution upon
Confession; and the Sacrament of Extreme Unction. These make a plausible show
or pretense that the Romish Church has greater store of means for salvation,
or for conferring Grace, then Reformed Churches have. But how well soever God
by their doctrine has provided for their Church, in granting it such a
multitude of Sacraments, and such an extraordinary manner, by which their
supposed Sacraments confer Grace upon such as receive them: yet when all is
Romish Priests have a strange Negative voice.
done, they grant a Negative voice to the Priest in the distribution of all
Sacramental Grace. And such a Negative as is not usual in other Cases. For all
other Governors of humane Societies, whether Ecclesiastic or Civil, have only
a Negative voice, which if they do not expressly use, their silence is
interpreted for a Grant, or testification of their Consent unto the business
proposed. But albeit the Priest profess his Consent unto the Sacramental Act by
pronouncing the Sacramental words: yet if he be pleased by secret Condition, or
tacit Limitation to withdraw the Consent of mind or spirit from his external
act or words pronounced by him; the Spirit of God shall want his influence upon
the souls of such as receive the Sacrament. And as they grant a Negative unto
every ordinary Priest in the distribution of Sacramental Grace unto the Laytie:
So they give the like Negative unto the Bishop or Prelate in the distribution
of Sacramental Grace unto their Priests. For the ordination of Priests is in
their Doctrine a Sacrament of the new Law or Gospel; and of this Sacrament the
Intention of the Bishop or Prelate which administreth it, is an Essential part.
If the Bishop either through negligence or malitiousness do not afford his
secret Intention or consent, the ordination of the Priest is invalid: the words
pronounced by him, or imposition of hands does imprint no Character upon his
soul, and without this character, he is no Priest.

5. And here by the way you may inform your selves, why such as are contented
in all points to believe as the Romish Church believes, have their own Priests
or Prelates in such esteem or estimation as no other people besides have their
lawful Governors. The true Reason is, not any extraordinary worth in their
persons, but this strange kind of Power or Authority, which were it true, or
where it is acknowledged to be true, might justly exact double honor, more
then humane; even both parts of that honor, which the heathens respectively
gave unto their several gods. Some gods the heathens honored with Placatorie
Sacrifices, lest being neglected, they should do them harm: Other gods, whom
they conceived to be the Authors or distributers of things good and
comfortable, they adored or honored with propitiatory Sacrifices. Both kinds
of sacrifices or services, one and the same Romish Priest may wrest from the
people committed to his charge: The one, to wit, Placatorie Sacrifices, he may
exact, and the people will be ready to perform, lest he withdraw or alienate
his Intention from them or their children, whilst he administers the Sacrament
unto them. For his malicious or fraudulent withdrawing of his Intention from
the Sacrament, may procure them greater loss or harm then the Heathen could
conceive their angry or wreakful gods could work them. The other kind of
Sacrifices, to wit, Propitiatory, the people committed to his charge will be
willing to exhibit to the Romish Priest, that he may be the more diligent,
circumspect and attentive, whilst he administreth the Sacraments, seeing upon
supposal or presumption of his diligence, or Intention in this business, they
hope for a greater blessing then the heathens expected from their good or
favorable gods.

But to conclude this First Point: If we put all these together:

First, The Intention of the Prelate or the Bishop necessary by their doctrine
for conferring the Order of the Priesthood, and for the efficacy of the
Sacrament of Confirmation.

Secondly, The Necessity of the ordinary Priests Intention in administering
the Sacrament of Baptism, of the Lords Supper, and of Extreme Unction, we need
not be afraid or ashamed to Charge their Doctrine in making the Intention of
the Priest or Minister of the Sacrament to be an Essential part of the
Sacrament, with nursing a perpetual distrust or doubt, not only of salvation or
perseverance in Grace; but with distrust or Doubt, whether men have the
ordinary Means for attaining unto the First or Second Grace. For of these
Means they can be no more certain, no better assured then they are of the
Priests Intention.

6. The Second Point which I undertook to show you was, How some in Reformed
The Second Point. The Remedy of the Contrarii as bad as the Diease.
Churches by seeking the Cure of this malady (to wit, Doubt or distrust of
salvation) by the Contrary, did conceive a doctrine which either nurseth a
Doubt or distrust, not of salvation only, but of means necessary unto it, as
bad or worse then the former Doubt of the Romish Church, or else occasioneth a
Presumption in many which is worse then both. The doctrine which they conceived
to be the fittest medicine for curing the Romish Malady (to wit, distrust or
Doubt of salvation) was, The Certainty or Assurance of salvation; That Fides
was Fiducia: That Faith did include a certainty of salvation, which if every
man could assume, none should Doubt or distrust of salvation. Mistake me not, I
pray, as if I did absolutely deny or condemn this Doctrine, which I acknowledge
to be wholesome and true in its Time and Place, I only mislike the mis-placing
or mis-application of this Truth. As he said, Beneficia male collocata male
facta arbitror, Good offices evil bestowed, part-take more of evil About This
Point, See Book 4. and Book 10. cha. 51, 52, 53. and Sermon. on Jer. 26. page 13.
and signs of the Times, p. 62.
Turns then of good deeds; So may I say, That the mis-placing of Truth is
ofttimes more dangerous then a gross Error.

But how or wherein has this Doctrinal Truth, concerning The Certainty or
Full Assurance of Faith been mis-placed by some Writers of Reformed Churches?

In this especially, That they have taught or maintained this (...), this Full
Assurance (or Certitudo Fidei, which is somewhat more then (...)) to be as
Essential to the Nature of Faith, of that Faith which distinguishes a
Christian from an Infidel, or a Faithful man from a Reprobate, as the Intention
of the Priest, is, by the Doctrine of the Romish Church, to the Essence or
efficacy of the Sacrament. Such an Essential Property would they have This
Certainty of salvation to be of true Faith, that, whosoever does truly believe
must be Certain of his salvation; and whosoever is not certain of his
salvation, is no true Believer. And to this Point or purpose that Saying of the
Apostle, 2 Cor. 13. 5. has been alleged by many; Know you not your own Upon
this Text See Book 7. Chap. 18, 19.
selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be Reprobates?

The former Extent of this Certainty of salvation, to All true Believers, did
give the forest blow to Reformed Religion, that ever it received; a See Book
10. Fol. 3274. Where this Author says. 300. Bellarmines, 300 Valentiaes, could
not do the Protestant Religion so much harm as Dr. Hessels did, taking
advantage of this Doctrine.
wound more grievous than all our Adversaries could have given it, had not her
friends and lovers given them this Advantage.

Now this Negative or Exclusive Interpretation of this place of St. Paul, as if
all were Reprobates or without hope, which one time or other (after means of
salvation have been offered) cannot assure themselves of their present estate
in Grace or Salvation, has more deeply wounded the Consciences of private men,
then the consciousness of all their other mis-deeds or practices. And the
Doctrine is for this reason the more to be misliked, for that it specially
wounds such as are of an humble and dejected spirit, and most afraid to offend
God either by unbelief, or by misdeeds.

7 Both parts of my Conclusion, to wit, That This Doctrine admits either
Doubt of salvation or Presumption, will be made clear, or cast upon you, from
the Confluence of these two Errors mentioned, The One, which makes The
Certainty of Salvation an Essential or reciprocal Property of Faith; The
Other, which ranks all that have not this Assurance or Certainty in the state
or condition of Reprobates; which is indeed but a Branch of another usual Error
(of which I must request and admonish you to beware, in whomsoever you find it)
of them, Who divide all mankind without Limitation into two ranks, into sheep
or goats, Reprobates. Though this be in due time and place Of this Division see
Lib. 10. Fol. 3153, 3275.
most true, yet it is a truth much mis-placed, if we make this Division of all
men before the hour of death, or day of Judgment.

But you expect a clear Explication of the manner how these Two Opinions, nurse
either a Doubt of Salvation or Presumption, which is worse then Doubt. Take it
then Thus. If it were a Truth to be taught, or if it be taken as true, That
whosoever does not attain unto the Certainty of Salvation, is none of the
Elect; or, That of all mankind the one sort is irrevisibly ordained to life,
the other irreversibly ordained to death. Then, All such, as have heard the
Word preached, and received the Sacraments, and are not as yet assured that
they are in the Estate of Grace or number of the Elect, must of necessity
doubt whether there be any possibility left for them to attain unto such an
Estate; or, whether they be not in the number of Reprobates. I know the usual
Reply to this Objection is, That albeit some men be irreversibly appointed to
death eternal before they be made part-takers of life temporal; yet because it
is unknown unto us, who they be that be thus ordained or appointed, therefore
we must preach the Word and administer the Sacraments indifferently to all,
whom we see willing to hear the Word or receive the Sacraments.

But all this does no way diminish the former Doubt or distrust in most
hearers; for if it still be true (as the former Doctrine supposes) that some
men, the far greater part of men, which hear the Word preached, are
irreversibly ordained to death, every man, which as yet apprehends not his own
estate in Grace, or his Ordination to life eternal, cannot be Certain, must
still doubt, whether he be or ever shall be in the number of them, which are or
shall be irreversibly ordained to life. The Romish Church did never deny, but
that the Priest may actually or virtually intend to do what the Church appoints
him to do, when he administreth the Sacraments. And yet, in as much as they
teach withal, That if he do not intend to do as the Church of Christ appoints
him to do, the Sacramental Act is void, we hence justly charge their doctrine
with breeding or nursing continual Distrust or Doubt of Salvation. But if we
withdraw or substract the Intention or purpose of God or of Christ, from
concurring with the Word and Sacrament which we exhibit unto all, or from
concurring with any part, or the greater part of men, we do necessarily breed a
greater scruple, or nurse a more dangerous Doubt of salvation in all men, as
yet not effectually called, then the Romish Church does. For Gods Intention or
purpose to save men, is without all question more Essential to the Efficacy of
the Word preached, or of the Sacraments administered, then the Romish Church can
conceive the Intention of her Priests to be. Besides all this: If their
Doctrine were true, who teach, That all such men as in the issue prove Goats or
Reprobates, were such from their birth, or irreversibly destinated to death
before they were born, God should withold or withdraw his Purpose or
Intention of Salvation from far more hearers of the Word and partakers of the
Sacraments, then the Romish Priests usually do.

8. But, many (you will say) which hear the Word are already assured of their
Estate in Grace, or of their salvation: And this Doctrine cannot occasion any
doubt or distrust in them. It cannot indeed, whilst they are thus persuaded.
But even this Persuasion it self, if it be immature, or conceived before its
time, does secretly nurse A Presumption, which is far See Book 10. Fol. 3262:
and signs of the Time p. 63.
worse then Doubt or distrust of salvation: And sometimes occasions a worse
kind of distrust or Doubt, then the former doctrine of the Romish Church does.
For, suppose A man, which is to day strongly persuaded of his present Estate in
saving Grace, and certain of his salvation, should to morrow or the next day
fall into some gross or grievous sin, and continue in it or the like for many
days together. If his former assurance remain the same it was; it is No
Assurance of Faith, No true Confidence but Presumption. Or, if his former
Confidence or Assurance upon consciousness of new sins fail or abate: The
Former Division of All Mankind into Goats and sheep, into Elect and
Reprobates will thrust him into Despere. For the Consciousnesse of freedom from
grosser sins, or of practice of good works cannot be a surer token of his
Estate in Grace or salvation, then the consciousness of foul and grievous sins
is of Rejection or Reprobation, if it were true that every man is at all times
either in the state or condition of an Elect person or a Reprobate. For, The
Rule of life and Faith is as plain and peremptory, that no Adulterer, no
murderer, no foul or grievous offender shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
as it is, That all such as live a godly and a sober life shall enter into it.

And yet our own consciences can give a surer Testimony that we have committed
gross and grievous sins, then that they are cleansed from the guilt of former
sins. Seeing the heart of man is more deceitful or more deceivable in its
persuasions or Judgment of its good deeds or resolutions then in its
apprehension of grosser facts committed by us. And for this Reason I cannot
persuade my self, That any man which has any sense or feeling of True Religion
or rightly understands himself in these or the like Points, can, in the
consciousness of gross and fouler sins rest persuaded that he is in the same
Estate of Grace wherein he was, or in the same way to life. Howbeit, even in
the consciousness of foulest sins he may and ought to have hope that he may be
renewed by repentance. And yet to have such an hope were impossible unless he
were persuaded that there is a Mean or middle Estate or condition between the
estate and condition of the Elect and the Reprobates.

9. But let us take a man that has been long persuaded that he is and has
been in the irreversible state of salvation; and is not conscious to himself of
any gross or palpable sin; or at least of continuance in any such sins, since
this persuasion did possess him. Yet if he have embraced this opinion or
persuasion before his soul were adorned with that golden chain of spiritual
virtues, which St. Peter requires, 2 Pet. 1. whether for making our election
sure in it self, or for assuring it unto us; This immature or misplaced
persuasion may fill his soul with the self same presumption which the absolute
infallibility of the present Romish Church does breed or occasion in all such
as believe it; And that is, A presumption worse then heathenish. For though an
Heathen or Infidel kill men uncondemned by law, live in incest, and fall down
before stocks and stones, or other dumb creatures. Yet such a man being called
in question for killing men uncondemned by Law, will not justify his Action:
If his incest be detected, he will be ashamed of it; or being challenged for
worshipping stocks and stones, he will not allege any sacred Authority for his
warrant. But if you challenge a Romanist with some like practices, and tell him
that he transgresses the Law of God in those particulars as grossly as the
Heathens do: his Reply will be, Though our facts be outwardly the same, yet our
practices are most dislike. Our practices cannot be against the Law of God,
seeing they are warranted by the authority of the Church and Pope, who is the
faithful Interpreter of Gods Laws, and cannot err in matters of faith or
practice authorized by him.

In the like case, if you shall oppose a man that makes himself thus certain of
his salvation before his time, in this or the like manner, Sir, you are as
covetous, as great an oppressor of the poor, as uncharitable, as malicious, as
proud and envious, as are the Heathen; or others whom you condemn for Infidels
and no good Christians; And press him with such evident particulars in every
kind, as would amate or appall an ingenuous Heathen, or other mere moral man
that were conscious of the like: yet you shall find him as surely locked up in
his sins, by this his immature persuasion of his own infallible estate in
Grace, as the Romanist is by his Implicit Belief, or the Churches absolute
Infallibility. So long as this Persuasion lasts, that he shall certainly enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven, no Messenger of God shall ever persuade him, that
he has done, or continues to do those things, which whosoever continues to do
shall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Gross and palpable or open sins
might happily shake or break this persuasion, how stiff soever it had been
before, but so will not secret or lurking sins. It rather animates or quickens
those secret sins of envy, ambition, pride, or malice. And of all other fruits
of this preposterous persuasion or misplaced Truth, this is the worst, that it
makes men mistake their malice toward men (whose good parts or fame they envy)
to be zeal toward God, or to his Truth.

10. Unless Satan had put this Fallacy upon some men in our times, it were
impossible that they could sleep upon the consciousness of such uncivil
behavior as they use; or such unjust aspersions as they cast upon all others,
without respect of persons, which dissent from them in Opinions often disputed
between members of the same Church without dissension. And of all the Points in
Divinity this day controverted in any Church, or betwixt the members of any
Church, there is no one that does naturally better brook diversity of Opinions
or acurate sifting without hazard of breaking the bond of Christian peace and
charity, then the Controversy about the Certainty of Salvation, or of
Perseverance in the state of Grace. For, Christian charity would presume that
every man which has his senses exercised in these or the like Points, is
desirous to be as certain of his own Salvation or estate in Grace, as with
safety of conscience his own understanding or rule of reason will permit him,
or can make him.

Such as know their own Estate in Grace by experience or otherwise, stand bound
in equity, in Christian charity, and in humanity, rather to pity then to
exasperate their brethrens weakness, which have not the skill or like
Experience to conclude for themselves so well as they do; or which doubt
whether the doctrine in Thesi (in the General) be true or false. And yet we see
by woeful experience, that the Contentions about these Points have been so
bitter and so uncivil, that no Papist or other Adversary shall ever be able to
say more against the Certainty of Salvation or men's Irreversible Estate in
Grace, then many such as have written for it have said against themselves. For,
if by the Grace which they hold impossible for men to fall from, they mean the
Spirit of wisdom or understanding in matters spiritual, or the Spirit of
meekness, of sobriety and Christian charity; every man that has any branch
of the Spirit of Grace implanted in him, may conclude without sin, that many
which contend most earnestly for Absolute perseverance in it, either never had
this Grace, or else are totally fallen from it.

11. The Third Point proposed was the Golden Mean which the Church of The Third
Point.
England mainteins as opposite to these Contrary Extremes; but most consonant
to the Evangelical Truth.

First, Our Church does acknowledge, That Fides is Fiducia, That the very
nature of that Faith which differenceth a Believer from an Infidel, or a
Christian from a mere natural man, does necessarily include a Certainty or
full How Fides is Fiducia, see Book 10. cap. 52.
Assurance in it. It must be without wavering, without distrust or Doubt.

The only Question is About the right or orderly placing of this Certainty of
Faith or full Assurance; Or What be the Points whereon it first must be pitched.

These (questionless) must be Points Fundamental, and such is that, That the
Son of God did die for us, that he did fully pay the price of our Redemption.
This, every man is firmly to believe, otherwise he builds without a Foundation.
This Certainty of Faith or full assurance, you shall find continually pressed
upon all hearers in the Book of Homilies, and other Acts of the Church.

But how shall every private man be fully assured, that Christ did die for him,
and that he fully paid the price of his redemption?

Sure, no man can have a right or full assurance of this Particular, unless he
first assuredly believe, that the Son of God did die for all men; that he has
redeemed all mankind. He that firmly and constantly believes this Proposition,
in some respect universal [The Son of God did die for all men] can never doubt
or waver in Faith, whether he died for him, or whether he has paid the full
Price of his Redemption. He which believes the General by an Historical or
Moral Faith, cannot choose but believe the particular by the same Faith. He that
believes the General by a spiritual and true Christian Faith, must believe the
particular by the same Faith. If the first Proposition [Christ died for All
men] be, De Fide, The Second likewise [Christ died for me] must be, De Fide,
too.

But how any man should have Assurance of Faith, That Christ did die for him,
or has redeemed him, unless he be first assured by Certainty of Faith, That
Christ did die for all men: This, I confess, is a Point which I could never be
assured of, nor be satisfied in, by any that plead for Special Faith.

12. Sure I am, that the Church our Mother does teach us to begin our Faith or
Assurance from the General, Christ died for All men, he has redeemed all
mankind, And this General She grounds upon that Saying of our Savior, John 3.
16. God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. The Application
or Use of this place you may find pithily pressed in the third Part of the
Homily, Upon the Death and Passion of our Savior.

To whom, says the Author of the Homily, did he give his Son?

To the whole world, that is to say, to Adam and to all that come after him.

He was not given to Adam, nor to such as come after him, until Adam, and all
that came after him were lost, until mankind were become his enemies. And this
is that which sets forth The wonderful love of God unto the world, that he
would give his only Son, whom he loved, for all of us which were his enemies.
Scarcely for a righteous man will one die, says the Apostle, Romans 5. 7. yet
peradventure for a good man, some would even dare to die. But God commends
his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners he died for us.

13. But when we are taught to believe that Christ died as well for every one
of us as he died for any, we are bound to believe, not only that he shed as
much blood for every one of us, as he did for St. Peter or St. Paul; but that
he shed as much blood for every one of us as he did for all men. That he paid
as great a price for my redemption, as he paid for the Redemption of all
mankind. It was not the Quantity of his blood shed, but the infinite Value of
each drop which he shed that did pay the price of our Redemption. Had the whole
stream of his blood been much greater then it was, if it had been See Chapt. 4.
Fol. 3338.
of value less then infinite, it could not have paid the price of one man's
redemption; and of price more then infinite, his blood, whatever quantity had
been shed, could not be for all. So that, he did as much for thee, as he did
for both thee and me, as much for either of us, as he did for the whole world.
His deservings of every one of us are infinite. Were this apprehension or
belief of the infinite and undivided love of God in Christ toward all and every
man, rightly planted in man's heart, it would bring forth the fruits of Love; he
which is thus persuaded of Christ's love toward him in particular, would love
Christ, and would keep his Commandments, would trust in Christ, and in all
temptations rely upon him.

14. To conclude all concerning The right ordering or placing of that
Certainty or full assurance, which is contained in our belief of Christ's Death
and Passion.

The first branch of it is, That, God by giving his only Son for us, did give
us an inestimable pledge of his love to us in particular. This we must believe
Certitudine Fidei, by Certainty of Faith. Upon this Foundation or Assurance of
Faith, our Apostle builds another, Romans 5. 9, 10. Much more then being now
justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For, if when
we were Enemies we are reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, much more
being reconciled to God, we shall be saved by his life. And again, Chap. 8. 32.
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how shall he
not with him also freely give us all things?

These are the Prime Seeds of true Christian Faith, and must be undoubtedly
planted in every man's heart, before he can be a fit Hearer, much less a

your assured Estate in Grace grow up together with this Purification of your

CHAP. XXXX.
The Fourth Sermon upon this Text.
ROMANS 2. 1. Therefore, Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
Judge, etc.
The Author, Chapt. 38. propounded Three Points. He handled The First in the
38, and 39. Chapt. The Second, viz. [How Papists and Protestants judging the
Jew, condemn themselves;] he omitteth, having other-where spoken to that Point,
and Particularly, Fol. 3342, 3688. of this Book. He proceeds here to The Third
Point, viz. [How Jews, Papists, Protestants, evidently condemn themselves,
whilst they Judge the Idolatry of the Heathen.]

1. THe very worst that the Jew or Christian can object unto the Heathen, as
Heathen, is the acknowledgement of many gods, or the adoring of stocks, of
stones, or as Daniel enstiles them, gods of gold, of silver, brass, iron, wood
and stone. How beit even this Imagination of many gods (or the worshipping of
many imaginary gods) was but a Transfiguration or Transformation of the True
and Only God into the similitude of those creatures, or visible substances
which they represented by the images which they worshipped. This was the very
height of heathenish Idolatry, as our Apostle instructs us, Romans 1. 23. They
changed the glory of the incorruptible God, that is, of the only Idolatry
transforms the Divine Nature into unfit similitudes.
God, into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed
beasts and creeping things. Of what things soever the images were which they
did worship; they changed the glory of God into the similitude of that thing
whose Image they worshipped; And by this means, as the Apostle inferres, ver.
25. they changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the
Creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever, So then, the
Transformation of the Divine Nature into unfit similitudes, is it, which must
give us the True Scale or Scantling for measuring the haynousness of that sin
which we call Idolatry. He that most grossly transforms, mis-pictures, or
changes the nature of the true and only God, is the most gross Idolater; be he
by profession a Jew, a Turk, an Heathen, or a Christian. And it was observed,
and excellently prosecuted, by a Great Prelate, a most Reverend and Learned
Bishop in this Land, That the worshipping of Images, and the worshipping of
Imaginations, The late R. R. Bishop of Winchester, B. Andrews in his Sermon on
that Theme.
so the Imaginations and the Images be alike monstrous or unfitting, come both
to one Pass.

2. In the worshipping of Images the Romish Church and the Heathens do (at
least for the outward Act) too well agree. And in this respect the Jew and
Mahumetan, are more averse from the ancient Heathens, then the best in the
Romish Church are. And if the sincerity of Gods worship did consist in
Negatives, as in not worshipping the Images of any living thing; the Mahumetan
or Jew might have the precedence of Reformed Churches. So far are they from
worshipping Images, that they do not allow the making of Pictures, though for
historical use. A Painter or Picture-maker is as execrable a creature amongst
them, as a professed Jew, a Turk, or Sarazen, or worshipper of Idols is amongst
us. Yet are the Jews and Mahumetans notorious Idolaters, in that other main
Branch, or rather Essential Root of Idolatry, that is, in worshipping their own
Imaginations; or in observing the Fables or Traditions of their Ancestors.

To omit then that Branch of Idolatry, which consists in the worshipping of
Images, we must examine ourselves (I mean we Christians, whether Papists or
Protestants) By our adherence to the Root of Idolatry, that is, the worshipping
The Worshipping of Imaginations the root of Idolatry. See the fifth Book.
of Imaginations, or the Transformation of the Divine Nature into the
similitude of our corrupt desires or affections. This is that which gave life
and Being to the multiplicitie of imaginary gods amongst the Heathens; And the
Poison of this Idolatry may be more malignant in others then it was or is in
them, for want of vent or issue.

3. We of Reformed Churches rightly censure it as a Branch of heathenish
Idolatry in the Romish Church, in that they teach the people to make solemn
supplication unto Saints deceased, for their Intercession or mediation with God
or Christ. And under this Censure fall all their prayers which they make in
this or the like form, Sancta Maria, Sancte Petre, etc. Ora pro nobis. Into
this branch of Formal Idolatry they could not possibly slide, but through the
other which properly consists in the Transformation or changing of the Divine
Nature into the similitude of corruptible man's corrupt affections.

Now how deeply that very Church is tainted with this Idolatry, Her own Plea
for practicing the former Branch, in praying unto Saints, will give evidence
against them. For the best warrant which her Sons can pretend unto, to
mis-perswade the multitude or vulgar, is this, That God is a Great King, the
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and therefore good manners requires that we
do not prefer our Petitions immediately unto him, but use the mediation or
intercession of deceased Saints, which are in greater favor with him, then we
wretched sinners are.

Now by this very Imagination or Conceit, they transform the glorious Majesty
of the invisible God, and of his Christ, into the similitude of mortal men, of
men though greater in power and Majesty then other men are, yet (for the most
part) not so good as they themselves are great, not so inclinable to poor men's
Peritions, nor so compassionate of their miseries as meaner
men are. Or if by nature, breeding, or civil education, these great Potentates
of the world, be more affable or compassionate then other men are; yet are they
not able to give dispatch to half the Petitions that would be presented unto
them, if every man might be admitted to be his own spokesman, or to have
immediate access unto their presence. However to compare God or his Christ in
the Audience of our prayers unto the best and wisest Kings that ever lived on
earth, or to make the manner of preferring Petitions unto Potentates, as a
pattern for preferring prayers and supplications unto the Almighty, is at the
best but a Branch of Heathenism, A manifest transformation of the Divine Nature
into the similitude of mortal man. And the Romanist, both by this Practice and
this Plea for it, does evidently condemn himself in that wherein he judges the
Heathen.

4. But would to God the Romanist alone did in this Particular condemn himself
in those things wherein he judges others, or that it were a common Error unto
him, with the Mahumetan and the Jew, who though they abhor Images more then
he does, yet they commit abominable sacrilege which is equivalent to Idolatry
in transforming the nature of the true God into the similitude of their own
Imaginations. But besides all these I am to give you notice of some in Reformed
Churches (and private Warning as occasion shall serve of some Writers in this
Church where we live, but no way authorized by it) which commit the same error
which they so much condemn in the Romanist.

The Romanist (as you heard before) transformes or changes the nature of the
incorruptible God, and of Christ himself, into the similitude of earthly Kings
and Monarchs, yet not of cruel and prodigious Tyrans. But these Writers whom I
mean, (as the Romanists object, and the Lutheranes prove) transform Some
Writers, not Papists, transform the Divine Nature
the Majesty and glory of the immortal God into the similitude of cruel
Tyrans, yea of such base and sordid Pedants (as the meanest amongst you would
disdain, should have any authority over your children) that is, such as
delight more in punishing and correcting them, then to direct or amend them in
learning or manners. For so some late Writers have expressly taught, That the
Almighty maker of all things does as immediately as primarily and directly
ordain some men to damnation, as he does others unto life; that he delights as
much in the exercise of punitive Justice, as he does in the exercise of
goodness, mercy, love, and bounty. That as by his determinate Decree he created
some to be Elect vessels of Honor for the manifestation of his Goodness: So by
the same irresistible Decree, he ordains others to be vessels of dishonor, for
the manifestation of his Justice. As if the manifestation of his Justice
punitive, or vengeance (for that Justice they mean) were as necessary from
Eternity as the manifestation of his Mercy and Goodness.

5. These and the like inconsiderate Tenets, which I forbear further to
prosecute or rehearse, did give, if not just Occasion, yet colorable Pretense,
and probability unto the Lutheran Churches, for breaking off all League or
Amity with some other Reformed Churches, because, as they conceived, either
they did not agree with them in the worship of the same God, or transformed
Gods nature into the similitude of his Enemy, into hatred and cruelty it
self. Now the best way to stop their mouths, or to make up that Breach which
the Positions of some inconsiderate men have made, would be to disclaim their
Opinions, as the most learned in other Reformed Churches have solemnly done.
For so, that Great Light of the Heilderbergh Church, whilst it flourished,
Paraeus.
and he with it (for Both were in a manner extinguished together) being
challenged by two Jesuits that came to visit him, professing withal, that they
would use the Lutheranes weapons to make their challenge good, For making God
the Author of sin, did in the Close or issue stand upon this defense, That
however this (perchance) might be Calvin's Error, yet it was not Error
Calvinistarum, no General Error of the Calvinists, as the Jesuit objected.
For, See Book 10. Fol. 3012.
as for Paraeus himself, albeit he could well brook to be accounted a
Calvinist, that is an adherer unto, or A Maintainer of Calvines Doctrine in
other Points: yet in this particular concerning Reprobation, he did rather
accord with Cardinal Bellarmine (and many others in the Romish Church) then
with Calvin himself. That he did not so well like of Calvines Opinion in this
particular, or (at least) his manner of expressing his Opinion, there is no man
of learning or understanding that wishes well either to the memory of Calvin,
or to the weal of Reformed Churches, but will commend Paraeus his wisdom and
ingenuity. But that this Good Author, should like better of Cardinal
Bellarmines Opinion, then of Calvines, in this Point, I for my part commend his
Ingenuity more then his Judgment. For if as good a Scholar as Bellarmine was,
would take the pains to examine his Opinion as strictly as he has done
Calvines, it would quickly appear, to be for Quality the very same, if not
worse, however for the Extent it may seem more tolerable.

Both of them were to blame in taking upon them to determine the particular
manner how God does reprobate; And it is a matter of no Difficulty to refute
them both: But a greater Presumption to determine any third manner distinct
from both. Only this in General, is most certain, that seeing Reprobation is an
Ordination unto death, no man is reprobated but for sin. But, as it is not the
Carpenter or Statuary, not he that works in stone, in wood, or brass, which
makes an Idol, for whilst the work is under their tools, it is an image or
statue only: He which sets it up or adores it, makes it an Idol. So this
Opinion of Reprobation how harsh soever, yet whilst Calvin, Bradwardine, or
perhaps St. Augustine did handle it, it was an Error only, or false
Imagination. They who now would make it a Fundamental Point of Faith, or insert
it in their Catechismes, make it an Heresy or worse then an heresy, an
idolatrous or blasphemous Imagination.

6. But admit all of us were free from transformation of the Divine Nature; all
of us Orthodoxal in matter of opinion concerning the Attributes of God or of
Christ, yet all this would not free us from another branch of Idolatry as rife
and luxuriant amongst other Christians, whether of the Romish or of Reformed
Churches, as it was amongst the Heathens, or is at this day amongst the
Infidels: For, we may rob God of his honor no less then the Heathens or
Infidels do, without any Idol or Image, without mis-forming or mis-picturing
him in his Attributes. And our Apostle at the 22. verse of this Chapter has
made the robbing or despoiling God of his honor equivalent to that branch of
Idolatry which consists in the adoration of Idols, Thou that abhorrest Idols,
do thou commit sacrilege, or do thou rob God of his honor. The word in the
Original extends to both, to all the branches of Idolatry. Every one which
adoreth Idols, takes that honor which is due to the only true God, and bestows
it on that which is not God: Yet in so disposing it they did offer it to a
Divine power as they imagined it; They did not reserve it to themselves; Though
self-love or indulgence to corrupt desire was the original of this Idolatry, or
alienation of Gods Worship: the Idol was their partner.

Now if any who is called a Christian, give the same indulgence to his own
corrupt desires, as the Heathen did, he robs God of his honor no less then
they.

Thus the Jews, who after their return from Babylon detained their Tithes and
Offerings, were convinced by Gods Prophets, by God himself, who taught his
Prophets thus to convince them, of as gross Idolatry as any Heathens had
committed. For the Heathens made a conscience of spoiling their Gods, so did
not Israel. That which their idolatrous Forefathers took from the true God,
they offered unto the Queen of Heaven, unto other imaginary gods and goddesses:
the later Jews spare this cost, and appropriate all unto themselves.

Now that Idolatry which a man commits with himself, or the Alienation of that
which is due to God, unto his own corrupt desires, is of all others the
worst, for it is always mixed with pride, or irreligion, which is worse then
superstition.

7. To make the Proof of this Assertion a little more clear.

First, That the sacrifices or solemn services, which the Heathens performed
unto their several gods, were but as so many luxuriant branches or excrescences
of their own corrupt desires, or of secret references to themselves, we gather
hence, That every Nation or Province did principally affect the service of that
god or goddess, which in the common esteem of those ignorant times was best
able to satisfy their longing desires, or to give a temporal blessing to their
labors.

Though there were many which were called gods, and goddesses many: Yet unto
the Inhabitants of the Isle of Sicily there was in a manner but one goddess,
that was Ceres, the supposed Patroness of Corn.

What was the reason?

The revenues of that Island or Province, did most consist in the fruitful
increase of Corn, and hence were that people more desirous to please, more
afraid to offend this imaginary goddess, then any other Divine Powers. She in
a manner had the monopoly of their Devotions.

The same Devotion and serviceable respects which the Sicilians professed to
Ceres, the Baeotians (a people of Greece) performed to Bacchus, the supposed
Patron or Protector of Vines. Of Ceres they made as small account, as the
Sicilians did of Bacchus.

What was the reason?

The chief Commodity which their Country naturally afforded, was Wine; A good
harvest did not much advance their Fortunes, nor a bad one much impair them.
Their expectation was a seasonable and fruitful Vintage.

The Athenians esteemed little of either of these gods, but held Minerva in
more esteem then the Sicilians did Ceres, or the Baeotians did Bacchus.

What was the reason?

Minerva was reputed the goddess of Wisdom, the nurse and foundress of those
Arts and Sciences, wherein the Athenians (their territories being for Corn and
Wine but barren) did most delight. And so they might excel See Book the Fifth.
others in wit, in learning and politic wisdom, they cared not much for
landcommodities.

The Ancient Gauls (a people which inhabited that Country which we now call
France, with the Netherlands, and those parts of Germany which are on this side
the Rheine) were as peculiarly devoted unto Mercury, as the Sicilians were to
Ceres, the Baeotians unto Bacchus, or the Athenians unto Minerva or Pallas.

What was the reason?

They were greedy of that gain which arises from the exercise of traffic or
merchandise, and Mercury in the foolish divinity of those ignorant times, was a
god of cunning or of wit in bargaining; a god, that, being well pleased, could
teach them how to overreach others, rather then to be overreached by them.

The Inhabitants of Cyprus being by natural disposition, and long custom
inclined unto wantonness, made choice of Venus for their Patroness.

Other Cities and Provinces, whose livelihood and maintenance did consist (as
the Netherlands now do) in traffic by Sea, had Neptune in greatest reverence
and admiration.

8. All these instances do clearly testify, that the worshipping of every Idol
or of the imaginary power which it represented, was but an excrescence or shute
of some internal immoderate desire. Now as the Schools say, Ubi unum propter
aliud, ibi unum tantum; He that desires Physic for healths sake only, desires
his health rather then the Physic; So it is again true, He that sacrificed to
Ceres for a plentiful harvest, to Bacchus for a fruitful vintage, or to Minerva
or Mercury for wit, did indeed respectively sacrifice to his own desire of gain
or of cunning wit, or to some one or other corrupt desire or imagination.

Covetousness (as our Apostle tells us, Col. 3. 5.) is Idolatry. And our Savior
calls it the Service of Mammon, The imaginary god of riches. Whence it will by
good Logic follow, that he which is most covetous, is the greatest Idolater in
this kind, that is, the greatest server of Mammon, albeit he do not serve him
in or by an Idol or Image. For the Idol is but an Accessory to this foul sin,
the Principal is the internal corrupt imagination or desire. He that can cheat
without a Broker, is never a whit the honester man then he which uses his
help, but rather (as the Proverb is) a more crafty knave; or as he is a more
cunning theif which can steal without an out-putter or receiver, then he which
always is enforced to use the help of one or other: So he that robs God of his
honor (whether by positive sacrilege, or by detention of that from him which
is his due) though this he do without an Image or an Idol to be his partner, is
as great an Idolater as the Heathens were. For he sacrifices that unto his own
Imaginations or desires which the Heathens did unto their imaginary powers.

To come to particulars.

9. If Merchants or Tradesmen be as greedily set upon their gain as the Heathen
Gauls were, which offered sacrifice unto Mercury, they are no less grievous
Idolaters then they were. If this corrupt affection be as immoderate in
Christians as it was in Heathens, it will be of like force to withdraw their
hearts, as it was to withdraw the hearts of the Heathen from the only true God:
of like force to sway them to as grievous transgression of the first and chief
Commandment, as the Heathens could commit any against it. For impossible it
is, they should love God with all their heart, with any greater part of their
heart, then the Heathens did, if their hearts be as strongly set upon riches
and worldly commodities, as the Heathens were. And so much of our love and
heart as is withdrawn and alienated from God, is a detention or robbing him of
his honor, it skils not much on whom it be bestowed, so it be utterly
alienated from him: The god of this world will place it where he list. But if
the inordinate desire of gain do mis-sway men, by profession Christians, to use
deceit in bargaining, to overreach their Neighbors; or to work their own
advantage out of their brethrens miseries or necessities, they transgress the
second great Commandment as grievously as the Heathen did, the sum whereof you
know is, to love our Neighbors as our selves, to do to all as we desire to be
done unto. And by the manner and measure of transgressing these two great
Commandments (on which the whole Law and Prophets hang) the true measure, as
of Idolatry, so of all other sins, must be taken.

10. If we should take an unpartial survey of all the several sorts or
conditions of men throughout this Land, and of their demeanors in their several
callings: What root or branch of goodness is there wherein we can be imagined
to overtop many Heathen Nations, unless it be in point of Faith and Opinion?
But these we know without correspondencie in practice of good life, will be so
far from justifying us in respect of the Heathens or Infidels, that they will
more deeply condemn us. Covetousness, deceit and violences were not more rife
amongst private Heathens, then they are with us. If opportunity serve, Homo
homini fit lupus, every one is as a snare or gin unto his neighbor. The Remedy
which God has appointed for this enormitie are public Laws and Courts of
Justice. And yet if the greivances, which private men suffer from one another,
were put in one scale, and the greivances, which befall them from the
corruptions of Courts appointed to do them right (whether these be Civil or
Ecclesiastic) were put in the contrary Scale, it would be hard to determine,
whether sort of greivances would overpoize others. And if the remedy prove
worse then the disease, what hope of health? As for drunkenness, riot and other
profaneness, these were not so rife in many Heathen Nations, as they are now
in most Christian States, because for the most part more severely punished
amongst them then they are with us, and yet I pray God that the sins of the
Pulpit and of the Printing House may be found much lighter then the sins of the
Playhouse or the Tavern, etc. when the great Moderator of Heaven and Earth
shall weigh them in the Balance of his un-erring Justice. This is certain, that
notorious delinquents almost in every other kind are ashamed to justify
themselves when their facts come to light; their very Consorts will not be
their Advocates when they are proved against them. Whereas many popular Sermons
and Treatises, albeit full stuffed with Characters of more then Heathenish pride,
hatred, malice, sedition and scurrilitie pass for current amongst the factions
Consorts, as containing rare expressions of fervent zeal in Gods cause, and of
sincere love to true Religion. And if the light of the body be dark, how great
must the darkness of that body be?

11. In drunkenness, in gluttony, in wantonness, and other branches of
licentiousness, some Heathen Nations in former ages happily have exceeded us; But
in this public and far spreading licentiousness of tongues and pens in
bitter invectives against their brethren, in audacious libelling against lawful
Superiors, no Age before the Art of Printing was invented could, no State or
Nation since the invention of that Art has exceeded or may compare with those
times wherein, and those people with whom we live.

But admit the faults or delinquencies of our time were but equal to the
delinquencies of the Heathen: yet as that ancient and religious Writer
Salvianus well observes, Though the vices of the Heathens and the Christians
were but equal, yet the same vices, are more criminous and scandalous in
Christians then they can be in the Heathen. If the Heathens were profane, were
covetous, were dissolute, licentious or disobedient, what great matter is it?
they never heard of A Redemption from this vain conversation to be purchased at
so high a rate as with the precious blood of the only Son of God: They never
were called solemnly to vow integrity of life and conversation, as a service
due unto that Lord which had redeemed them. All this we have done, and yet have
left our Masters will (which we vowed to do) altogether undone, yea continue to
do the will of his Enemy with as great alacrity and fidelity as the Infidels
or Heathens do.

Again, the Heathens had no expectation of any gracious immortal reward for
well-doing: they feared no dreadful doom or sentence after death, for the
errors or mis-doings of this mortal life. But we ever since we learned the ten
Commandments and our Creed, have been hedged in on the right hand and on the
left, on the right hand with hopes of a most blessed everlasting life, on the
left hand with fear of an endless and never-dying death: and yet have
transgressed these bounds, have on both hands out-rayed as licentiously as the
Heathens did.

Surely one special reason, why after so long, so much good preaching, there is
so little practice of good life, so much licentiousness in the ways of death,
is, because we Preachers do not maintain that double hedge which Christ has
set us for keeping us in order, that is, we do not press the fear of death and
hope of life everlasting, so forcibly and seasonably as we ought and might.

Now these meditations of everlasting life, and everlasting death, are the
points whereunto these discussions upon this Text have been praemised. God
grant you docile hearts, and me the Spirit of Grace and Understanding for
rectifying your hopes and fears of your final reward in that last and dreadful
Day.

CHAP. XLI.
2 CHRONICLES. 24. 22. The Lord look upon it, and require it.
1. THe Sayings of men in perfect health of mind, are then most pithy, and
their Testifications most valid, when their bodily limbs and senses are at The
Sayings of dying men remarkable.
the weakest pitch. And the Admonitions or Presages of wise Governors, whether
Temporal or Ecclesiastic, sink deeper into sober hearts, being uttered upon
their deathbeds, then if they were delivered upon the Bench or Throne. These
few words amount unto an higher Point of Consideration, then these Generalities
import. For, They are the last words of a great High Priest and a great Prophet
of the Lord, of a Prophet not by General Calling only, but uttered by him
whilst the Spirit of Prophecy did rest upon him. They are the words of
Zechariah the Son and lawful Successor to that Heroical High Priest, Jehoiada;
who had been the chief Protector of the Kingdom of Judah, A Foster-Father unto
the present King, The Restorer of David's Line, when it did hang but by one
slender thread, unto its Ancient Strength and Dignity.

2. The Points most considerable in the survey of this Text are Three.

First, The Plain and Literal sense, which wholly depends upon the Historical
Three points considerable.
Circumstances as well precedent as subsequent.

Second, The Emblematical Portendment of that prodigious fact, which did
provoke this dying Priest and Prophet of the Lord to utter these words. Or
which is all one, The fulfilling of his imprecation according to the Mystical
sense.

Third, The discussion of such Cases of Conscience or controversed Divinity as
are naturally emergent out of the Mystical or Literal sense, and are useful for
this present or future Ages.

To begin with the Circumstance of the time wherein they were uttered; The
Circumstance of time.
That apparently was the days of King Joash, Heir and Successor unto Ahaziah
King of Judah, who was next Successor save one unto good Jehoshaphat, by lineal
direct descent; but no Successor at all to him in virtue, or goodness, or
happiness of Government For Ahaziah was Pessimi patris haud melier proles, a
very wicked son of a most wicked father, and too hard to say whether he or his
Father Jehoram were the worse King or more unfortunate Governor. But Joash the
Orphan Son of Ahaziah has the Testimony of the Spirit of God, That he ruled
well whilst Jehiiada the High Priest did live, 2 King. 12. 2. And his zeal to
the House of the Lord (recorded at large in this chapter, as also in the 2
Kings 12. 4.) was so great, as more could not be expected or conceived, either
of Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, or good Josiah. And thus he continued from the
seventh year of his Age until the five or six and thirtieth at the least. A
competent time (a man would think) for a full and firm growth in goodness.

But amongst the Sons and Successors of David, we may observe, that some begun
their Reign very well and ended ill: Others, being extreme bad in their
beginning, did end better then the other begun. So Manasses in the beginning
and middle of his Reign, filled the City with innocent blood, and died a
Penitentiary. This present King Joash begun and continued his Reign for thirty
years or thereabouts in the spirit, but ended in the flesh (or rather in blood)
leaving a perpetual stain upon the Throne and Race of David. This strange
Apostacy or Revolt argues, that his forementioned goodness and zeal unto the
House of the Lord was Adventitious, and not truly rooted in his own breast. That
the fair Lineaments of a pious man and noble Prince were drawn not by his own
skill, but by the manuduction of Jehoiada the High Priest; as Children
oft-times make fair letters while their Tutors guide their hands, but spatter,
and blot, and dash, after they be left to their own guidance.

Jehoiada (says the Text) waxed old, and was full of days: an hundred and
thirty years old was he when he died, and they buried him in the City of David
among the Kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and
toward his House.

The solemnization of his death was a strong Argument of the respect and love
which both Prince and People did bear unto him whilst he lived; and much
happier might both of them have been, had they continued the same respect, unto
his Son and Successor. But they buried their love unto Jehoiada and (which was
worst) the zeal which he had taught unto the House of God, in his Grave. For so
it follows, verse 17, 18. Now after the death of Jehoiada came the Princes of
Judah and made obeisance to the King; Then the King hearkened unto them, and he
left the House of the Lord God of their Fathers, and served Groves and Idols.
Yet Gods love to them does not determine with the beginning of their hate unto
the House of God and to his faithful Servants. For notwithstanding that wrath
came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass, yet he sent Prophets to
them to bring them again to the Lord; and they testified against them but they
would not give ear. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon (or clothed)
Zechariah the Son of Iehoiada the Priest, who stood above the people and said
unto them, Thus says God: Why transgress ye the Commandment of the Lord that
ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsaken the Lord he has also forsaken you.
And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the Commandment
of the King, in the Court of the House of the Lord. Thus Ioash the King
remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done unto him, but
slew his Son, and when he dyed he said (or, inter moriendum, dixit) The Lord
look upon it, and require it.

3. But did the Lord hearken to him, or require his blood at the Kings and
Princes hands which slew him?

Yes! that he did; oftener then once. For it was required of their posterity:
But for the present he did visit both the King and his Princes most remarkably,
by an unexpected Army of the Syrians, unto whose Idolatrous Rites they had now
conformed themselves, complying too well with them, and with their neighbors
the Heathen, in all sorts of wickedness.

But here the Politician will reply, That the Syrians did upon other occasions
intend to do some mischief to the King, the Princes and People of Judah. For it
was never unusual to that Nation to vex or molest Israel or Judah;

-- Nunc, olim, quocunque dabant se tempore vires: As often as opportunity
served, as often as they could spy advantage. And to assign the Probable or
meritorious Causes of such Plagues as befall any Nation by their inveterate
enemies, unto the Judgment of God, for this or that sin, is not safe; specially
for men not endued with the Spirit of Prophecy.

In many Causes I confess it is not; yet in this particular we need not be
afraid to say as much as the Spirit of God or sacred authority of his Word has
taught us. (We say no more, as indeed we need not, for the point is so plainly
and punctually set down by the penman of this Book from verse 23. to the 26.
as it needs no Comment, no paraphrase or marginal conjecture, any of which
would rather soil then clear the meaning of the Text.) And it came to pass at
the revolution of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him, and
they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the Princes of the people
from amongst the people, and sent the spoils of them to Damascus, etc.

4. The Observations or plain Uses which these Literal Circumstances of this
Story afford are many: I shall touch upon some principal ones.

As First; To admonish Kings or other supreme Magistrates to reverence and
respect their Clergy; seeing Ioash did prosper so well while he followed
Observations and Uses out of the story and circumstances.
the advice and counsel of the High Priest Iehoiada: but came to this fearful
and disastrous end, first by contemning the warning of Zechariah the
Cheif-Priest, and afterward by shedding of the innocent blood of this great
Prophet of the Lord. But this will be a common place, not so proper to this
time and place, wherein we live: wherein there is such happy accord between the
supreme Majesty and the Prelacie and Clergy of this Kingdom, as no good
Patriot can desire more then the continuance of it.

Secondly, There lies open a spacious field for such as affect to expatiate in
Common Places or dilate upon that Old Maxim, Laici semper sunt infensi
Clericis, to tax the inveterate enmity of secular men against the Clergy.
Whose violent out burstings into Prodigious Outrages, did never more clearly
appear then in the wicked suggestions of the Princes of Judah, unto unfortunate
King Joash, against this Godly High Priest Zechariah for his zeal unto the
House and service of the God of their Forefathers. But however the like
prodigious cruelty had not been exemplified before this time, yet in many later
ages, the Prelacie or Clergy have not come an inch short of these Lay-Princes
in working and animating Kings and supreme Magistrates to exercise like
tyranny, and oppressing cruelty, not upon Laics only, but upon their Godly and
religious Priests, or inferior Clergy.

The Histories almost of all Ages and Nations, since the death of Maurice the
Emperor unto this last Generation, will be ready to testify, whenever they
shall be heard or read, more then I have said, against the Romish Hierarchy,
whose continual practices have been, to make Christian Kings the Executioners
of their furious spleen against their own Clergy, or neighbor Princes; or to
stir up the rebellion of Lay-subjects, against all such of their Leige-Lords
or Sovereigns as would not submit themselves, their Crowns and Dignities, or
(which is more) their Consciences unto Peter's pretended Primacie.

The sum of all I have to say concerning this Point, is This; As there seldom
have been any very Good Kings, or extraordinary happy in their Government
(whether in the line of David, or in Christian Monarchies) without advice and
assistance of a Learned and Religious Clergy; so but a few have proved
extremely bad without the suggestions of covetous, corrupt or ambitious
Priests. So that the safest way for chief Governors is, to keep as vigilant and
strong Guards upon their own breasts and consciences, as they do about their
bodies or palaces.

Now the special and safe guard which they can entertain for their souls and
consciences is, to lay to heart the Examples of Gods dealing with former
Princes, with the Kings of Judah especially, according to the esteem or
reverence, or the dis-esteem which they did bear unto his Laws and Services.

5. Another special means to secure even Greatest Monarchs from falling into
Gods wrath or revenging hand, is, not to hearken unto, not to meditate too much
upon, or at least not to misconstrue a Doctrine very frequent in all Ages, to
wit, That Kings and supreme Magistrates are not subject to the authority of any
other men, nor to the coercive authority of humane Laws. The Doctrine, I dare
not, I cannot in conscience deny, to be most true and Orthodoxal. And for the
truth of it, I can add one Argument more then usual; That Gods judgments in all
Ages or Nations, have not been more frequently executed by Counter-passion or
Retaliation upon any sort or state of men then upon Kings, or Princes, or
greatest Potentates which pollute their Crowns and Dignities with innocent
blood (as King Joash did) or with other like out-crying sins. As if the most
Just and Righteous Lord by innumerable Examples tending to this purpose would
give the world to understand, That none are fit to exercise Jurisdiction upon
Kings or Princes besides himself; and withal, to instruct even Greatest
Monarchs, that their Exemption from all Controulment of humane Laws, cannot
exempt or privilege them from the immediate judgment of his own hands, or
from the contrivance of his just punishments by the hands of others as by his
instruments, though his Enemies Agents.

I forbear to produce more instances of Divine Retaliation upon most Sovereign
Touching Retaliation, see the 6. Book (or Treatise of Gods Attributes) 2 part,.
4. chap. 31. page 343.
Princes, besides this one in my Text, which a bundantly justifies both parts
of my last Assertion or Observation. Ioash (as you heard before, and may read
when you please) did more then permit, did authorize or command the Princes of
Judah, to murder their High Priest Zachariah in the Court of the Lords House.
A prodigious liberty or license for a King to Grant, and more furiously
executed by the Princes of Judah, his Patentees or Commissioners for this
purpose. And yet the most righteous Judge of all the world, did neither animate
nor authorize the Prophets, Priests, or Levites, or other chief men in this
Kingdom to be the avengers of Blood, or to execute judgment upon the King or
Princes of Judah.

This service in Divine Wisdom and Justice was delegated to the Syrians their
neighbor Nation. And the Host, not by their own skill or contrivance, but by
the disposition of Divine Providence, did Geometrically and exactly proportion
the execution of vengeance to the quality and manner of the fact. The Princes
of Judah who had murdered Zechariah in the Courts of the Temple of the Lords
House, were all destroyed by the Syrian Host in their own Land, and the spoil
of their Palaces sent unto the King of Damascus. And King Ioash (by whose
authority Zechariah was stoned to death in his Pue or Pulpit) after the Syrians
had grievously afflicted him, was slain in his own Palace, upon the bed of his
desired or appointed rest, by the hands of two of his own servants; yet neither
of them by birth his native Subject; the one the son of an Ammonitess, the
other of a Moabitess; both the illegitimate offspring of two of the worst sort
of aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel.

In all this appears the special finger of God. But though all this were done
by Gods appointment; yet may we no way justify the conspiracy of Ioash his own
servants against him, though both aliens, unless we knew what special warrant
they had for the execution of Gods judgments, which are always most just.
However, we have neither warrant nor reason to exclaim against them or their
sins, so far or so much, as by the warrant of Gods Word we might against the
Princes of Judah, for the instigating of their lawful King or Liege-Lord to
practice such prodigious cruelty (as has been expressed) upon Zechariah the
Lords High Priest; or against the disposition of the stiffenecked Jewish Nation
in general, most perspicuous for the Crisis at that time.

6. But to exclaim against the Princes or People of that Age we need not; for
their posterity has amplified the cursed Circumstances of this most horrible
Fact; and charged these their forefathers with such a measure of iniquity as
No Orator this day living, without their directions or instructions could have
done. Septies in die cadit justus, The just man falls seven times a day, was an
ancient and an authentic Saying, if meant at all by the Author of it, of sins
and delinquences, rather then of crosses and greivances which fall upon them,
or into which they fall, was never meant of Grosser sins or transgressions. But
of that days work wherein Zechariah was slain these later Jews say: Septem
transgressiones fecit Israel in illo die. I shall not over-English their
meaning if I render it thus, Israel that very day committed seven deadly sins
at once, that is, without interposition or intervention of any good work or
thought.

First, They allege, Zechariah was their High Priest, and to kill a Priest, A
Cluster of Deadly Sins in the Horrible murder of Zechariah the High Priest.
though of inferior rank, was a sin amongst all Nations, more then equivalent
to the killing of a mere secular Potentate. A sin sometimes more unpardonable
then any sin could be committed within this Kingdom, besides the making of
Allom.

Secondly, As these Jews allege, Zechariah was a Prophet; and to kill a
Prophet, was the next degree of comparison in iniquity unto the laying of
violent hands upon Kings and Princes, for he which forbid To touch his
anointed, did also forbid to do his Prophets any harm, both are given in the
same charge.

Thirdly, Zechariah was a second Magistrate among his People: and to kill a
prime Magistrate is more then murder: or at least a mixture of Murder and
Treason.

Fourthly, This Priest and great Magistrate (by the Testimony of their sons who
murdered him) was upright and entire in the discharge of all his Offices, and
a man unblemished for his life and conversation.

Fifthly, they polluted the Courts of the Lords House, within whose precincts
Zechariahs blood was shed, without such reverence to the place, as Jehoiada his
Father upon a far greater exigencie, for the preservation of Ioash and his
Kingdom did observe. For he would not suffer Athaliah, though guilty of murder
of the Royal Seed, and of high Treason against the Crown of David, to be put to
death within the Courts of the Temple, but commanded her to be killed at the
Gates of the Kings House, Chap. 23. 14.

Sixthly, As these Jewish Rabbis observe; Their forefathers polluted the
Sabbath of the Lord, for on a Sabbath day (as it is probable, not from their
testimony only, but from the Text) Zachariah was thus murdered.

That which makes up the full number of seven and the measure of their
unexpiable iniquity, the Sabbath wherein this unexpiable murder was committed
was the Sabbath of the great Feast of Atonement.

All these transgressions or deadly sins (for every circumstance seems a
transgression or principal sin, not an accessory) were committed in one day or
at once.

Another circumstance these later Jews charge their forefathers withal, That
they did not observe the Law of the * Deer or of the Heart, after they shed
Levit. 17. 13.
Zachariah's innocent blood; for they did not so much as cover it with dust:
But this Circumstance will fall into the discussion of the Third General
proposed. The sins or circumstances hitherto mentioned were enough to
sollicitate the Execution of Zachariah's dying prayers or imprecations, Lord
look upon it, and require it.

Another circumstance for aggravation of this sin (specially on King Io, ash
his part, omitted by the later Jews) might here be added, For that this good
man, this godly Priest and Prophet of the Lord, Zachariah, was by birth and
blood of nearest kindred (as we say, Cousin Germane) to Ioash, as being the
Son, by lawful descent, of Iehoshabeath (daughter of Iehoram, sister to
Ahaziah, and so Aunt to King Ioash) whom Iehoiada the Priest had to wife, 2 Chronicles. 22. 11.

7. But did these Aggravations or curious Commentaries of later Jews, upon this
and the like sins of their forefathers any way help to prevent the like
diseases in such as made them? Rather their Exclamations against them and Rigid
Reformation of them, and their affected Zeal unto the Prophets whom their
Fathers had murdered did cast them into far worse diseases of pride and
hypocrisy; whose symptoms were fury, madness and splenctical passions, which
in the issue brought out more prodigious murder, as will better appear in the
Second General proposed, which was, The Emblematical portendment of this cruel
and prodigious Fact against Zechariah, or the accomplishment of his
imprecations according to the mystical sense.

For proof of our last Assertion or Conclusion of the Literal sense, no better
Authority can be alleged or desired, then the authority of our Savior Christ.
No better Commentaries can be made, upon the mystical sense of the former
History, then he who was the Wisdom of God made upon it, Matthew. 23. verse 29.
Woe to you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites (so he had indicted them seven or
eight times in this Chapter, before; But the height or rather the depth of
their hellish hypocrisy was reserved unto this verse; and the original thus
expresses it:) Because ye build the tombs of the Prophets and garnish the
sepulchers of the righteous; and say, If we had been in the days of our
Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
Prophets, wherefore ye be witnesses unto your selves, that ye are the children
of them which killed the Prophets.

What if they were so? What will follow? Must the children be punished for
their fathers sins, or for the acknowledgment of them?

Surely no! if they had repented of them. But to garnish the Sepulchers of the
Prophets, or the righteous men, whom their Fathers had killed, was no good
Argument of their true Repentance. So far was this counterfeit Zeal unto the
memory of deceased Prophets, from washing away the guilt of blood wherewith
their forefathers had polluted the Land, that it rather became the nutriment
of hatred and of murtherous designs, against the King of Prophets, and Lord of
life. And to this effect the words of the Evangelist St. Luke, chap. 11. ver.
48. would amount, were they rightly scanned and fully expressed. Truly ye bear
witness and allow the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them (to wit, the
Prophets and righteous) and ye build their sepulchers. In building the
Sepulchers and acknowledging their fathers sins which killed the Prophets, they
did bear Authentic Witness, that they were their sons; And in not bringing
forth better fruits of Repentance then the beautifying of their Graves, they
did bear witness against themselves, that they were but as Graves (as our
Savior says in the 44. verse) which appear not (or do not outwardly show what
is contained in them) and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.

8. That the Scribes and Pharisees (who were respectively Priests and Lawyers)
did more then witness, that they were the sons of them which killed the
Prophets; that they did, though not expressly, yet implicitly, more then allow
their Fathers deeds, and were at this instant bent to accomplish them, is
apparent, from our Saviors fore-warnings or threatenings against them, Matt.
23. 32, 33. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers, ye generation of
vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell, or the judicature unto
Gehennah? That the Scribes and Pharisees, and the People misled by them, were
now prone to make up the full measure of their Fathers sins, is apparent from
Matthew. 23. 34, and 35. Wherefore behold I send unto you Prophets, and Wisemen,
and Scribes, and some of them ye shall (or will) kill. and crucify, and some
of them ye shall scourge in your Synagogues, and persecute them from City to
City. That upon you may come all the righteous blood, that was sheed upon the
earth, from the blood of the righteous See the next Sermon upon this Text.
Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between
the Temple and the Altar. Verse 36. Verily I say unto you, all these things
shall come upon this Generation. Or, as it is in St. Lukes Narration of our
Saviors Comment upon this Story, taken by himself or by others who heard him,
in the very same words wherein he uttered it: Therefore also, says the Wisdom
of God; I will send them Prophets and Apostles, and some of them they shall (or
will) slay and persecute, That the blood of all the Prophets which was shed
from the foundation of the world may be required of this Generation: from the
blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the Altar and
the Temple. Verily I say unto you it shall be required of this Generation. This
vehement reiterated Asseveration literally and punctually referrs unto the
words of my Text. The Implication or Importance is as much as if he had said:
Ye Scribes and Pharisees may call to mind that when your Forefathers (whose
murtherous acts ye acknowledge) did slay Zacharias the High Priest, he expired
with these words in his mouth: Lord look upon it, and require it.

His innocent blood was then in part required upon King Ioash, upon the Princes
of Judah, and other chief offenders; But shall now again be required in full
and exact measure of this present Generation, more murtherous and bloody then
their idolatrous forefathers at any time were.

9. What shall we say then, That this last Generation was guilty of the murder
of Zachariah, or to be plagued for their fathers sins in murdering him? This
Point will come to be discussed in the Third General.

And however that may be determined; This Case is clear: that, These later Jews
did make up the full measure of their forefathers iniquity, in killing Gods
Prophets; especially in murdering Zechariah, who was the most illustrious Type
of Christ the Son of God, in the Manner of his death, and for the Occasions
which these several Generations took respectively to murder them both.

The special Occasion which their forefathers took to kill Zachariah the Son
of Iehoiada or Barachias (for he bore both names, though both in effect the
same, or one equivalent to the other) was, because he taxed them for their
idolatry, and labored to bring them again to the worship of the true God.

The only quarrel which the malice of the later Jews could pick against our Lord
and Savior, was, because he taxed their hellish Hypocrisies, which their too
Curious Reformation of their forefathers Idolatry had bred: And taught them
how to worship God in spirit and truth, not in Ceremonies or mere bodily
observance.

Neither Generation were so blind as to persecute men whom they did acknowledge
to be immediately sent from God. Yet were both furiously prone to persecute
such as indeed were sent from God, for pretending or promulging their
Commission from God, or taking the names of Prophets upon them, so often as
their doctrine did cross their practices or violent passions.

This later Generation of Scribes and Pharisees (after they had failed in their
Proofs of any Capital matter of Fact or point of doctrine delivered by Christ)
condemned him for answering affirmatively to this Question proposed. Tell us,
art thou the Son of God? or, as St. Mark more punctually expresses it, Art
thou the Christ the Son of the Blessed? Mark 14. 61. Zechariah (as was now
said) was Christ's true Picture for Quality, for Office, and for the Relation of
Names and kindred. For Zechariah was a Prophet and a Priest the Son of Iehoida,
which signifies as much as The knowledge of God; or, as our Savior expresses
the Reality answering to his name, The son of Barachias, that is, The blessed
of God. And our Savior was The Son of the only wise God, the wisdom of God,
and The blessed of God, the very God of blessing, being the Great Prophet of
God and High Priest of our souls.

Lastly, the Princes of Judah having by glozing flattery persuaded their King
to authorize their projects against Zechariah the High Priest and Prophet of
the Lord, put them in execution upon the solemn Feast of Atonement or
expiation.

The Scribes and Pharisees equal or Superior to these Lay-Princes in cruelty,
importuned Pilate by pretended observance and loyal obedience to the Roman
Caesar, to sacrifice The Son of the Blessed (whom they had unjustly condemned)
unto their malice at that solemn Feast, which was prefigured by the Feast of
Expiation, the Feast instituted in the memory of their deliverance out of Egypt.

CHAP. XLII.
MATTHEW. 23. verse 34, 35, 36, etc. Wherefore, behold I send unto you Prophets,
and Wise men, and Scribes, and some of them ye shall (or will) kill and
crucify, and some of them shall (or will) ye scourge in your Synagogues, and
persecute them from City to City. That upon you may come (or, by which means
will come upon you) all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood
of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye
slew between the Temple and the Altar. Verily I say unto you, all these things
shall come upon this Generation. 2 Chronicles. 24. 22. The Lord look upon it, and
require it. Luke 11. 51. Verily I say unto you, it shall be required of this
Generation.
THese words ( --) were uttered by our blessed Lord and Savior against the
Scribes and Pharisees, with their Associates in Blood, a little before the
Feast of the Passover; Whether that Last Passover; wherein this Lamb of God
prefigured by that Solemn Feast (as also by the Death of Abel and his
Sacrifice) was offered upon the Cross, is or may be a Question amongst the
learned, not at this time to be disputed; But rather (if occasion serve) in the
explication of the last verse; Verily I say unto you, ye shall not see me
henceforth, till that ye say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.

For gathering the true and full Connection of this Passage with the former
Relations, it shall suffice to observe; that as our Savior never spared the
Scribes and Pharisees: So at this time above others he reproves them most fully
and sharply. The Matter of this Reproof, was their avarice and hypocrisy: The
End, partly to prevent the like desire of vainglory, with other Enormities in
his Disciples; Partly to cure (if it were possible) the Scribes, and Pharisees
of their hereditary disease. Hence, whereas they most affected Complemental
Greetings in public places, or glorious Titles of Rabbis: Our Savior to
allay this humor, for respectful Salutations presents them Woes; instead of
glorious Titles he instyles them Hypocrites: For striking at seven several
Branches of their Hypocrisy, he seven times in this Chapter begins his speech
in this style; Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites.

2. The principal and most deadly Branch of this bitter Root, was, Their
garnishing the Sepulchers of the Righteous, and building the Tombs of the
Prophets. In which notwithstanding they did not so mightily deceive others, as
their own souls; yet by a Fallacy very familiar, and apt to insinuate it self
into all our thoughts. For, who is he amongst us, but will take his love and
good respect to Good men, whether alive, or lately dead, as a sure Testimony of
his own goodness or integrity? especially in respect of theirs, that either
have persecuted them living, or defamed them after death? Howbeit this kind of
Testimony, generally admitted for current, would make way to bring Pharisaical
Hypocrisy into Credit with our souls. Many we have known, either in hope of
filling, or fear of emptying their purses, pinch their bellies: But as none can
be so miserable, as not to desire to fare well rather then ill, so he might
have good cheer as good cheap as bad: So, hardly can any be so wicked, as not
to like better of Godliness or virtue in others, then of vice, so the one be no
more prejudicial or offensive to him, then the other. Now the Fame or memory of
godly men long ago deceased, or far absent, cannot exasperate the wicked, or
malicious, nor whet their pride to Envy. For Envy (though a most unneighborly
quality) is always conceived from neighborhood, or vicinitie. Contrariwise the
righteous, that live amongst the wicked, are (as the wise man speaks) a
Reproach unto them, because their works are Genesis 19. 9. Pto. 28. 4. Wisd. 2.
12. 1 John 3. 12.
good, and the others evil. This different esteem of virtue present and absent,
the Heathens rightly had observed. Virtutem incolumem odimus; sublatam ex
oculis quaerimus invidi. For as Bats and Owls joy in the Suns light after it is
gone down, though it offend their eyes, whilst it shines in full strength and
comforts all other creatures endued with perfect sight; So can the sons of
darkness endure the sons of light after their departure out of this world,
albeit a perpetual eyesore unto them living in the same Age, or society. Upon
this humor did Satan (that great Politician) work; putting such a Gull upon
these Scribes and Pharisees, as Domitian the Emperor did upon his Subjects. For
as this Tyrant, when he purposed any cruelty, or murder, would always make
speeches in Commendation of mercy, or clemency, to prevent suspicion: So the
old Serpent having made choice of these Scribes and Pharisees, as fittest
instruments to wreak his spite upon our Savior; first sets them a work to
build the Tombs of the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous,
whom their fathers had slain, least they should suspect themselves of any like
intent against that Just one, of whom they proved the betrayers and murderers.
Time had so fully detected their fathers sins, that it was bootless for them to
attempt their concealment. The safest, and most plausible course to appeace
their consciences, was freely to protest against them; for they said, If we had
been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in
the blood of the Prophets.

And is it credible, that men so ingenuous, as thus to confess their
fore-elders shame, and ready as far as was possible, to make the dead
Prophets amends for wrong done to them by their ancestors many hundred years
ago, should attempt any cruelty against the Prince of Prophets, whom Moses
their Master had so strictly commanded them to obey?

No; the world must rather believe Christ was not that Great Prophet, but a
Seducer, because so much hated of these great Rabbis, which so honored the
memory of true Prophets, whom their fathers persecuted. With such vain shows do
these blind guides deceive the simple, being bewitched themselves by Satan
with groundless persuasions of their own sincerity, and Of Pharisaical
Hypocrisy, See Book 4. and second Sermon on Jer. 26.
devotion toward God, and his Messengers.

To think this hypocritical Crew should wittingly and purposely use these
devices, as politic Sophismes to color their bad intentions, were to make us
think better of our selves, then we deserve, by thinking worse of them, then
our Savior meant in that censure: They do all their works to be seen of men.
This (according to the like phrase most frequent in Scripture) does argue the
praise of men to be the Issue of their works, but not the End they purposely
aimed or intended, For, their hypocrisy supposed a mis-guided zeal or
aberration from the mark they sought to hit, caused from their immoderate
desire of honor and applause, which did so intoxicate and overruled their
minds, and like leaven diffuse it self through out all their actions, that even
the best works, they did, could be pleasant only unto men, not unto God, which
tries the heart, and looks as well, that our Intention be sound and entire, as
that we intend that which is good, because commanded by him. To honor the
memory of Holy men was a good work, but ill done by them, because it proceeded
not from a contrite and penitent heart. To stint the Cry of so much righteous
blood, as had been shed by their Ancestors, what could it (alas) avail to deck
the places where their bodies lay buried? That God was greivously offended,
they could not doubt; and to think he should be pacified by such sacrifices,
was to imagine him to be like sinful men, which can wink at public offenses
for some bribe given to their servants, or some toys bestowed upon their
children. Thus to acknowledge their forefathers cruelty, and not to be more
touched with sorrow for it, was to give Evidence against themselves, as our
Savior in the 31. verse inferres; So then ye be witnesses unto your selves,
that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets. Or as St. Luke
relates the same passage; Woe be to you, for ye build the Sepulchers of the
Prophets, and your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witness and allow the
deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and ye build their sepulchers.
For, not to amend that in our selves, which we reprove in others, but rather to
assume liberty to our souls, as if we were acquitted by such reproofs or
corrections of their mis-deeds, is in deed to allow, what in word we disclaim.
Had these Scribes and Pharisees never taken notice of their fathers sins, they
could have had no occasion to conceit their own holiness so highly; but now by
comparing their own kindness to dead Prophets bones, with their fathers
cruelties against their living persons, they seem in comparison like Saints,
hence emboldened to trespass more desperately against the Holy One of God. In
this respect our Savior in the words immediately going before the Text, not
content with this ordinary Title of Hypocrites, or blind Guides, calls them
Serpents, and a generation of Vipers. As if he had said, Ye are children or
seed of the old Serpent, the Divle, which was a murderer from the beginning,
and now ye are ready to take his part against the promised Woman's seed: And
whereas they thought themselves of all men most free from stain of the Prophets
blood, whose tombs they garnished, our Savior in my Text lays that especially
to their Charge, indicting them of all the murder committed from the beginning
of the world, until that present time, or at least till Zechariahs death.

3. The Indictment we must believe to be most true and just, because framed by
Truth it self: But what the true meaning of it should be, is not expressed by
any Interpreter we have hitherto met with. Such as a man in reason would
soonest expect best satisfaction from (for the most part) pass it over in
silence: Others (like young Conjurers, which raise spirits they cannot lay)
cast such doubts, as they are not able to assoil. For acquainting you with as
much, as my reading or Observation (upon late desires to satisfy my self in a
point so difficult and useful) have attained unto, give me leave to reflect
upon 2 Chronicles. 24. 22, and to look fore-right also into the words of St. Luke,
chapt. 11. verse 51. [Verily I say unto you, it shall be required of this
Generation.] Which few words include the greatest measure of righteous blood
most unrighteously shed that ever was laid to any People or Nations Charge. And
yet laid to the charge of the Jewish Nation not indefinitely taken or according
to several successions or generations, but to the present Generation of this
People: and so laid by One that could not err either in giving of the Charge,
or in point of Judicature upon any matter within the Charge. For the Charge is
laid by the Wisdom of God, by the supreme Judge of quick and dead, as you may
see from the forty ninth verse. Therefore also, says the wisdom of God, I will
send them Prophets and Apostles, and some of them they shall (or will) slay and
persecute, that the righteous blood of all the Prophets which was shed from the
foundation of the world may be required of this Generation, from the blood of
Abel unto the blood of Zechariah which perished between the Altar and the
Temple. Verily I say unto you, it shall be required of this Generation.

The same Charge (though with some variation of words, yet with full
Aequivalencie of sense) we have in my Text, Wherefore behold I send unto you
Prophets, and Wise men, and Scribes, etc.

But however the Charge and the Emphatical Ingemination for laying this Charge
upon this Generation of Serpents in both Evangelists be for equivalency of
sense the very same. Yet St. Luke (as I take it) reherseth the Charge in the
self-same words wherein our Savior uttered it, It shall be required of this
Generation. And in thus saying he declared himself to be Vates tam preteritorum
quam futurorum, better knowing the true meaning or importance of Zecharias his
Imprecation or Prophecy, and the time wherein it was to be fulfilled then
Zecharias himself (although both an High Priest and a Prophet) did, when he
uttered it. The Imprecation or Prophecy of that Zecharias unto whom (as I
suppose) the words recited out of St. Matthew and St. Luke have a peculiar
Reference, are recorded the 2 Chronicles. 24. 22. And when he died (or as the
Original has it, when he was a dying, or in the very moment of death) he said:
The Lord look upon it, and require it.

The Exposition of which words, First according to the Literal or Grammatical
See the Sermen upon that Text, immediately precedent.
Sense, with the Historical Circumstances precedent and subsequent.

And Secondly, according to the Mystical Sense, or the Emblematical Portendment
of that Prodigious Fact, which provoked that Godly High Priest and Prophet to
utter the forecited Imprecation [Lord look upon it, and require it:] has been
the Subject of my meditations of late delivered in A less and The Former Sermon
on 2 Chronicles. 24. 22 I suppose was preached at Court, This at Oxford.
yet a greater Audience.

The Third General (then proposed, but left untouched) comes now to be handled
in this learned Auditory upon another Text.

And that was, The Discussion of such Questions or Cases of Conscience as were
emergent, whether out of the Literal or Mystical Sense of Zacharias the son of
Jehoiada his dying words; especially of such as be useful either for this
present or future Times.

4. And of such Questions the first is, Who this Zachariah in St. Matthew and
St. Luke is: Whether it be He that was slain (as is told) 2 Chronicles. 24. 22. or
some other of that name?

The Second, (supposing, the same Zecharias to be meant in all three places;)
Why the Wisdom of God after he had laid the blood of all the righteous men and
Prophets whom their forefathers had slain; or happily whom they intended to
slay, should instance in Zachariah the son of Jehoiada or of Barachiah, as the
last man whose blood was to be required.

The Third; Whether the blood of Zecharias, or other Prophets or righteous men
slain by their forefathers, or the blood of the Son of God himself, or of his
Apostles, of whom this present Generation were the murderers, was in strict,
and Of the Jews Calamities see Book 1. chap. 23. and 27.
Logical Construction of these words, required of this present Generation? Or
in other Terms, thus; Whether the murder of Our Savior, or of his Apostles,
plotted or practiced by this present Generation, or rather the cruelties
practiced by their Forefathers upon the Prophets and other righteous men, were
the true and Positive Cause of all those unparalleld Plagues and Calamities
which befell the Jewish Nation within forty or more years after our Saviors
death: of the desolation of Jewry, and the Jews utter extirpation thence by
Titus and Adrian.

The Fourth, In what Cases, or how far, the posterity or successors of any
people or nation are liable to the punishment of their Ancestors sins; or what
manner of repentance is required for the known and gross sins of their
Fathers?

The Fifth; Whether it were lawful for any of Christ's Apostles (or other of
his followers at this day) upon the like provocations as Zacharias had, to
curse their persecutors in such manner as he did his, upon their deathbeds, or
when they are a dying.

The Sixth (which might as well have been the First) is; With what Intent, or
to what End, The Wisdom of God did send Prophets, Apostles and Wise men unto
this present Generation, or their forefathers: As whether to rescue them from
the Plagues denounced against them by Zachariah and other Prophets; or to bring
their Righteous Blood upon them.

5. To the first Question, Who this Zacharias was. Some have questioned
whether He was Zechariah Coaeval to Isaiah, and witness of his Espousal, The
first Question, Who this Zechariah was.
Isai. 8.

Others there be of opinion, this Zachariah here meant should be Zachariah the
Prophet, whose Prophecy is extant in the Sacred Volume, the last in order but
one, as he was one of the last in time, and prophesied about this peoples
return from Babylon. And it is true indeed, that this Prophet was the Son of
Barachiah, as appears from the very first words of his Prophecy. But this
opinion is obnoxious to the same exceptions the former is: viz. it is neither
warranted by Scriptures, nor by any good Writer. Neither is it credible, that
the Jews then living would kill the Prophet of the Lord immediately after their
deliverance from captivity; At least, the Reverence to the Temple then scarce
finished, would have made them abstain from shedding his blood within the walls
of it near the Altar.

Others there be amongst the Ancients (but few later Writers of better note)
which think this Zacharias should be John Baptists Father; what reason they
should have so to think I cannot conjecture, save only Our Saviors words in
the 35. verse [VVhom ye slew between the Temple and the Altar*] This in
ordinary speech may seem to implie, that this just man had been killed by this
people now living, not by their Fathers; For so our Savior happly had said,
Whom your Fathers slew, not Whom YE slew. But it is a Rule in Divinity, to
gather our Saviors and his Apostles meaning by the usual Phrase of Scriptures,
not by our common manner of speech. Now it is usual to the Prophets and Sacred
Writers to lay the fathers sins unto the childrens charge if they continue in
the like, or repent not for them. And if this people now living must be plagued
for the ancient Prophets blood; no question, but they were guilty of it, and
may be said to have slain them, in the same sense, they are endicted as guilty
of it.

That our Savior should not mean John Baptists Father, is more then probable,
for these reasons.

First, His death is not mentioned in the New Testament; nor in any Good
Ecclesiastical Writer.

Secondly, Because it no way benefits the Authors of this Opinion, but rather
increases the difficulty.

For if he were slain by Herod the Great, who was a Philistine by Parentage,
why should not John Baptist's death be laid to their charge being slain by
Herod's Son? Nay, why not our Saviors or his Apostles, whom he fore-tels they
would shortly kill, and persecute?

This plainly argues, that the reason, why he names this Zacharias, was not
This punctually agrees with the Copy.
his slaughter. And besides this reason there is none, why we should think this
Zacharias was John Baptist's Father. As for the Apocriphal Stories or
Traditions, which are pretended for this guess, or groundless conjecture, we
have just cause to suspect, that it rather brought forth them, then that they
should first deliver it.

Not to trouble your patience with any more Reasons for refuting those
Opinions; it is agreed upon by most late Writers I have read, Papists, or
Protestants, and by St. Hierom the best in this kind of all the Ancient, that
this Zachariah, here spoken of, was the son of Jehoiada the Priest, whose death
we have set down 2, Chron. 24. verse 21. And they conspired against him, and
stoned him with stones at the Commandment of the King, in the Court of the
House of the Lord. In what Court it is not specified, but it is most probable
from the circumstance of the Text, that it was in the Court, where the Priests
offered sacrifices, or in the place, where he instructed or blessed the people;
for it is evident that Zechariah was slain in his Pue or public seat appointed
for instructing the People.

And hereunto the ancient Jews in their Traditions accord. This is that our
Savior says in my Text, that he was slain between the Temple and the Altar.
By the Temple we are to understand the outward Courts, or Isles, or as The
Temple and the Altar.
we distinguish betwixt the Church and the Chancel, the body of the Temple
comprehending Atrium Israelis and mulierum, the Courts, wherein the
Congregation of men and women stood; By the place between these and the Altar,
the Court where the Priests taught, or celebrated their service. And so it is
said, verse 20. That Zachariah should stand above the people, when he delivered
that message unto them, for which they stoned him to death.

Why this Zachariah should be called the son of Barachiah, diverse Expositors
bring diverse reasons, all probable in themselves, and each agreeable with
other. Some think his father (as was not unusual amongst the Jews) had two
names, or a name and a sur-name, Jehoiada and Barachiah. Others think, that our
Savior did not so much respect the usual Name, whereby the Prophets father was
called, as his Conditions, or virtues unto which the name of Why Zachariah
called the son of Barachiah.
Barachiah did as well, or better agree, then Jehoiada, although the one of
these cannot much disagree in sense from the other, for the one signifies The
knowledge of the Lord, the other, to wit Barachiah, The blessing of the Lord,
or Man blessed of the Lord. Well might both names befit that Famous
High Priest, famous both for his wisdom and piety, every way blessed of God,
and a great blessing to this people: For as it is said 2 Chronicles, chap. 24.
verse 16. He had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house,
In which respect he was buried in the City of David amongst their Kings.
Admitting then Jehoiada either usually had, or were for the reasons intimated
capable of these two Names, it is not without a special Reason, perhaps a
Mystery, that our Savior in this place should call Zachariah rather the son of
Barachiah, then of Jehoiada, For the more blessed his Father was of God, the
greater blessing he had been to Israel; the more accursed was this See Dr.
Hammonds Notes on Matthew. 23. fol. 125. where he cites Josephus Lib. 4. cap. 19.
for another Zacharias, killed by the Zelots immediately before the Seige, which
puts a short end to this Question.
ungratious people in killing his virtuous and religious son in the House of
the Lord, for dissuading them from Idolatry: And the more fully did they
prefigure the sin of this wicked generation their children, which for the like
cause did now go about to kill the Son of God Christ Jesus Blessed for ever.
For hereafter they were to acknowledge Him to be the True Barachiah, as it is
intimated in the last verse of this chapter: Blessed is he that comes in the
Name of the Lord.

Thus much of the first Point [Who this Zachariah was] gives some light unto
the Second.

6. And the Second Question, [Why our Savior should make such special instance
in, or peculiar mention of the Blood of Zachariah] is the least difficult of
all the rest; and yet a Question not so easily answered, as the learned The
Second Question, Why our Savior instanceth in Zechariah.
Spanish Jesuit Maldonate in his Comments upon this place would persuade us.
His best Answer to this Question solemnly proposed by him, is This. Christ's
purpose was only to instance in those Prophets, whose slaughter was expressly
testified in the Bible, least the Scribes and Pharisees might deny them to have
been slain by their forefathers: Now of Prophets, whose deaths are mentioned
in Scripture, Zacharias the son of Jehoiada was the last. We have just occasion
to suspect his conjecture (were it true) to be impertinent because the Reason
whereby he seeks to confirm it, is evidently untrue. Seeing Zacharias the son
of Jehoiada was not the last of all the Prophets, whose bloody deaths are
recorded in Scripture. For in the 26. chap. of Jeremy, There is express
mention of one Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim, who for prophesying
against Hicrusalem was put to death (240. years after Zechariah by Jehoiachim
King of Judah, and by his Council of State and of War, and was fetched back
from Egypt, whither he had fled for refuge, by Elnathan the son of Achbor a
great Counselor of State, and other Commissioners for this purpose, unto
Iehoiachim* who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves
of the common people. And this Prophets blood, and other indignities done unto
him and to his Calling after his death, were Required of that Present
Generation, of the King especially: For, as Jeremy, perhaps taking his hint
from this Bloody Fact, had foretold, so it came to pass; that Iehoiachim was
cast out of Jerusalem, not into the Graves of the Common people, but into the
Open Fields, for he had no other burial then the Burial of the Ass, or other
like contemptible creature.

But however the blood (perhaps) of this Prophet amongst many others, was to be
further Required of this Present Generation; Yet Zacharias was Zachariah the
only Prophet that dyed with an Imprecation
the Last, and I think the First of all the Prophets which at the moment of his
death did beseech God to Require his blood and to revenge his death. And this
(I take) is the true Reason, why Our Savior after he had indicted the Jews of
the blood of all the Prophets and righteous men shed from the foundation of the
world, should instance only in Abel the son of Adam, and Zacharias the son of
Iehoiada or Barachiah. Christ's Instance in Abel literally and punctually
referres to that Dialogue betwixt God and Cain: Genesis 4. 10. The Lord said unto
Cain, where is Abel thy Brother? And he said, I know not: Am my brothers
keeper? And he said, what have thou done? The voice of thy brothers blood
cries to me from the ground, and now art thou cursed from the earth, which
has opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand.

But did the voice of Zacharias his blood cry in like manner unto the Lord
after his death, or solicit the like Curse or vengeance upon them which shed
it or their posterity as Abels did? yes, besides the forementioned
Imprecation, Lord look upon it, and Require it, which was uttered by him, after
a great part of his blood and Spirits were spent, his blood spoke as bad
things, as that of Abels; For so the Jewish Rabbis (besides that Cluster of
seven deadly sins, committed by their forefathers at once in the murder of
Zacharias) See Fol. 3721.
mention another Circumstance subsequent, not recorded in Scripture; or not so
plainly, as a Christian Reader without their Comment or Tradition would take
notice of it; which in my Opinion does better illustrate that passage of
Scripture whereon they ground or seek to countenance it, then any Christian
Commentator has done, Our Fathers (say they) in shedding Zacharias's blood,
did not observe the Law of the blood of the Deer or Heart: For so it was
commanded, Levit. 17. 13. Whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or
of the strangers that so journ among you, which hunteth and catches any beast
or fowl that may be eaten, he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover
it with dust. But Zacharias blood (though shed in the Temple) was not so
covered, it was apparent. To this purpose they allege that of the Prophet
Ezekiel, chap: 24. 6. Woe unto the bloody City, Her blood is in the midst of
her, she set it upon the top of a rock, she poured it not upon the ground to
cover it with dust: that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance.

No question but the Prophets entire purpose was to indict Jerusalem (as our
Savior does in my Text) of all the Innocent blood that had been shed before
his time within her Territories, and withal to note her Impudence in
committing such foul sins so openly, without care to cover the conspicuous
marks of her own shame. Yet this no way argues that the Prophets did not point
out some Memorable and Prodigious Fact, which might serve as an
Emblem of her shameless carelessness in all the rest. Such Allusions to
particulars sufficiently known in their own times are very usual in the
Prophets: This is the special Reason why their Writings in General are so
obscure to us, why some of their Metaphors seem harsh or far fetched, because
in truth their speeches in these Cases are not merely Metaphorical, but include
Historical References to some famous Accidents present or fresh in memory. From
the same Cause, all ancient Satyrists, or such as tax the capital vices of
their own times, are hardly understood by later Ages, without the Comments of
such as lived with them or not long after them: as our Posterity within few
years will hardly understand some passages in the Fairie Queen, or in Mother
Hubbards, or other Tales in Chaucer, better known at this day to old Courtiers
then to young Students.

It may be these murderers said of Zachariah, as their posterity said of our
Savior: His blood be on us, and on our Children. It is not likely they would
be careful to cover it with dust, or wipe the stain of it (whilst fresh) out
of the walls or stones of the Temple, because they had solemnly forsaken the
House of the Lord, and made a league to serve Groves and Idols, willing perhaps
to let the Print of his blood remain to terrify others from being too forward
in reproving the King and His Council for their offenses against God.

But whether the marks of it were left on purpose, or through mere
forgetfulness of this people, God in his Providence, as the Prophet intimates,
suffered it so to remain, To cause fury to come, and to take vengeance. For
whereas this fact, or forgetfulness to cover it, was in the words before
attributed to Jerusalem: Her blood is in the midst of her, she set it up on
the top of the Rock, she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust;
The Prophet after intimation of the Cause, why it so remained; To cause fury,
etc. Immediately adds, in the Person of God; I have set her blood upon the top
of a rock, that it should not be covered. Of these words no meaning can be
rendered more natural, then This; To wit, That God did suffer the print of
Zachariah's righteous blood to remain in the Temple, as it were to solicit
vengeance for all the rest, that had been, or should be shed in Jerusalem; to
cry unto him, as Abel's did from the earth, which (as it seems) was not
covered, certainly the voice of it was not smothered with dust.

How long the stain of blood, especially dashed out of the body by violence,
will be apparent upon stones, or moist walls, experience does not often teach,
because it is usually covered, or wiped off whilst it is fresh. Yet some
prints of blood have longer remained (unless Domestic Traditions be false) on
stones, then the blood it self could have done by course of nature in the veins
that enclosed it. Albeit we may with good probability presume, that Zachariah's
blood (if we consider the manner of his death) might continue, by Gods
permission or appointment, far above the time that any Ordinary Experience
can testify.

More strange it is, which Ecclesiastical Writers report of this Prophets body,
that being crushed with stones, it should be found otherwise entire and
incorrupt in the days of Theodosius, which was above a thousand years after
his death. Unless they had greater Occasion, then I can conceive, to lie, I
neither dare distrust this Report of theirs, nor the other Tradition of the
Jews, by whose account the stain of His blood remained a greater part of two
hundred years in the Temple.

However, we may (with good probability) conclude, that the true Reason, why
our Savior mentioned Zachariah's death as one special Cause of Ierusalems last
destruction, was not because he was the last, or one of the last of the
Prophets that had been murdered by the Scribes, and Pharisees Fore-elders, but
rather because his murder was the most foul Prodigious Fact, that was
committed in that Land, and did from the very Commission of it, portend
Destruction to the Temple; and the Consequents of it fore-shadowed the
miseries, which were afterward to befall the Nation. The truth of this
Conclusion will better appear from Discussion of the third Point proposed.

7. And this was [Whether the blood of Zacharias and other Prophets, or of our
Savior and others after him were more especially required of this Generation.]
The Third Question.
Or [Whether this Generation and their posterity were so grievously plagued (as
we know they were) for their own personal offenses against the Person of the
Son of God, or for communicating with their fathers in shedding the blood of
the Prophets and of other righteous men.]

The modern Jews peremptorily deny Their long Exile and Calamity to have been
inflicted upon them as a just punishment for putting Christ to death; because
their Fathers did not (in their judgment) therein offend.

Diverse Christian Writers (as it usually falls out) refuting this Error of
theirs, run into a Contrary, ascribing the Greivousness of their memorable
plagues unto their personal offenses against our Savior, being otherwise free
from the sins wherein their fathers grievously trespassed, Maldonate the
Jesuit is so far addicted to this Opinion, that he thinks our Savior in my
Text spoke but according to Vulgar Language; As if to a Malefactor, which had
escaped often, but is afterward taken for some notorious murder which cannot
be pardoned, men would say, he should now pay for all his villainies; not that
they mean he shall suffer several punishments for several offenses, or more
grievous tortures then were due for his last fact alone; but that he should
have judgment without mercy and be punished as grievously as might be, though
for it only. Thus much then and no more he thinks our Savior would have
signified; That the Scribes and Pharisees should suffer such grievous
calamities for murdering Him and his Apostles, as they might well seem to be
plagued for their Fathers cruelties, Howbeit they were not at all punished for
them but only for their own. For (says he) although neither they nor their
Fathers had killed either Prophet, Apostle, or Disciple (but Christ alone) they
had deserved greater plagues for killing him then are recorded, by Josephus.
This last Assertion (I confess) is no less true, then Non-concludent: for the
Conclusion to be inferred was not, what manner of Plagues they did deserve for
putting our Savior to death; but, whether these punishments were de Facto
inflicted, for putting him to death, or for the murder of Zachariah and other
Prophets, whom not their fathers only, but they had slain, for so our Savior
lays the Charge of Zachariah's blood unto them in particular, whom YE slew
between the Temple and the Altar.

8. A good Auditor must be able not only to give a true Onus or Charge, but
withal to make right Allocations or Deductions; otherwise, he shall often
over-reckon himself or wrong such as are to deal with him. The like skill is
required in making such Calculatory Arguments as Maldonate, and many other good
Christians use, in aggravating the offenses of this Present Generation of the
Jews against Our Savior* Let them lay the Charge of the later Jews trespasses
as deep as they list, or can; we shall be able to make the Deductions or
Allocations much-what equal; so that Computatis computandis, the greatest part
or fullest measure of the blood which came now to be required of this
Generation must arise (as the literal meaning of my Text imports) from the
righteous blood of Zacharias and other Prophets unjustly shed in former Ages,
and unrepented of by this present Generation.

They must lay their Charge from the Infinite Excess of Christ's Dignity in
respect of other Prophets; for, His Person was in Majesty truly Infinite. We
are to make the Deduction from his Infinite Power and Facility to forgive
offenses against himself or his Person. For, questionless he did as far
exceed all the Prophets in Goodness, in Mercy and loving kindness, as he did
in Majesty and Greatness. And had Peculiar Power and Authority to forgive
sins, and remit those plagues which the Prophets had denounced against
Jerusalem and her children. Nor could the malice of his enemies against him be
more available to procure, then His prayers and tears for Jerusalems peace,
were to pacify his Fathers wrath against it; especially for their offenses
against his Person alone.

9. The flagrant Expressions of his special Love unto Jerusalem (not yet
alienated A Paraphrase or Exegesis of Christ's loving and threatening expressions.
from the worst sort of this present Generation) if we compare them with this
Threatening fore-warning in my Text and in the words before it, will bear this
sense or brook this Paraphrase; However I see and know you more maliciously
bent against me then Cain was against his brother Abel, then your forefathers
(Prince or People) were against Zachariah the son of Iehoiada (or of
Barachiah;) however you thirst more greedily, and more irrelentingly after my
blood then the chafed Heart does after the brooks of water: yet, whenever you
have glutted your selves with the sight of it pouout upon the ground: In-stead
of covering it with dust, cast not this foul aspersion or slander upon me or
it, as if either it or I did or shall solicit vengeance against you for the
cruel indignities which ye have done or shall do, either to me or to my
followers when I am dead. The blood of my Apostles will not speak so bad; And
My blood shall speak much better things for you, then the blood of Abel did for
his brother Cain, then the blood of Zachariah whom your Fathers slew betwixt
the Altar and the Temple did for the then King and the Princes or people of
Judah. For my Heavenly Father has not sent me, nor will I give any Commission
to my Followers or Ambassadors to curse, but to bless you; not to wound and
destroy, but rather to save and heal you. If your impenitencie and perverseness
have moved me to speak severely, or threaten you, it is still for your good.
Severum medicum ager intemperans facit; Your obdurate hearts have caused me
oft-times (the mildest Physician that ever took cure of the body or soul upon
him!) to use tart speeches unto you; yet shall it never A Paraphrase or
Exegesis of our Saviors meaning, or Implication.
provoke me to be cruel in my practice. So far am I from seeking your blood
or harm, that my blood, which you have continually sought, whenever you shed
it, shall make an Atonement for you, shall procure a Free and Gracious General
Pardon for all your sins, and for all the sins of your forefathers in shedding
the Blood of Prophets sent unto them. But when I have done all, when all is
done that could be done unto this Vineyard which my Father planted, according
to the Rules of Equity, of mercy and benignity, without wrong or prejudice to
eternal Justice; Unless by sincere Repentance, as well for your own sins, as
for the sins of your forefathers (wherein you have been too deep part-takers
with them) you submit your selves unto my Fathers will, and with all humility
crave allowance, of that most Free and Gracious Pardon which my blood shall
purchase for you and for all the world besides; The City of Abel's and of
Zachariah's blood will at the last prevail against you; the blood of both of
them, and of all the Prophets whom your forefathers have slain, will be
Required of this Generation in fuller measure then it was of those which slew
them: and this will be a burden too heavy for you to bear; much heavier then
the punishment of Cain, albeit neither my blood nor the blood of any of mine
(Apostles or Disciples) do come at all upon the Score or Reckoning, wherewith
Moses in whom ye trust, and the Prophets whose Tombs and Sepulchers ye build
and garnish, will be ready to charge you in the day of your Account or
Visitation. For if the blood of Christ or of his Apostles had been Required at
their hands which shed it (me thinks) this Emphatical Ingemination, Verily, I
say unto you, it shall be required, etc. should not be so needful and weighty
as were all the words uttered by Him, who spoke as never man spoke.

10. But may we from any or all these Premises conclude, that This present
Generation was not punished at all for putting our Savior to death? How
Christ's death was A Cause of the Jews Calamities.
Or that his death or the indignities done unto His more then sacred Person at
or before his death, was no Cause at all of those Exemplary Punishments or
unparalleld plagues, which fell upon Jerusalem and Judah, upon this whole
present generation? God forbid!

The Question is not, Whether our Saviors death was any Cause at all of the
exemplary punishments; but, What manner of Cause it was; or, In what sense they
may be said to be plagued for wronging him thus.

We answer that the indignities done unto Him at his death, and at his
arraignment were such Causes of the ensuing Woes and calamities which came upon
this Generation, as Absentia Nautae is naufragii; The Case or Species facti is
thus. Suppose a skilful Navigator and experienced Pilot, which had long
governed some tall and goodly Ship with good success in many difficult voyages,
should at the length either by the greediness of the Owner be casheerd or
enforced to leave his place; and a storm upon his departure should arise, and
through want of good steerage or sounding should run them on ground or dash
them against the rocks, we may say without Solecisme, that the Abandoning or
Absence of the former Master or Pilot was the Cause of the shipwreck or the
loss of men or goods, although he neither were any Cause of raising the storm,
nor prayed against them (as Zacharias did against his persecutors) nor gave
them any wrong directions before he left them.

Now the Son of God from the time of his peoples thraldom in Egypt, but more
especially from the time of their deliverance thence, had been in Peculiar The
Son of God in a peculiar manner to the Jews King of Old.
manner the King and Governor of the Jews, in all their Consultations of Peace
or War; their only Pilot in all their storms. And however, throughout their
several Generations they were often greivously punished: yet were they always
punished* Citra condignum, much less then their iniquities had deserved.
Briefly; by His wisdom he preserved them safe in such distresses, as without
his only skill would utterly have overwhelmed the State and Nation: And by his
Intercession prevented the Out-bursting or fall of that hideous storm, which
had been secretly, and by degrees more insensible, gathering against them, then
that Cloud which Eliah's servant saw rising out of the Sea, even from the death
of Zachariah the son of Iehoiada and other Prophets and righteous men whose
blood their forefathers before and after his had shed.

But after this last Generation had both by express words and practice verified
that saying of God to Samuel, They have not cast off thee from being King over
them, but they have cast off Me. That other prophecy or sweetly mild
fore-warning, for which they took occasion to stone Zachariah to death in the
Courts of the Lords House, was exactly fulfilled in and upon them. This
Prophecy or fore-warning we have, 2 Chronicles. 24. verse 20. Thus says God; Why
transgress ye the Commandments of the Lord that ye cannot prosper? because ye
have forsaken the Lord, he has also forsaken you. This Prophecy with that
other of Samuel was most exactly fulfilled, Tam verbis quam factis male
ominatis, and mala ominantibus, when they solemnly protested before Pilate,
that they had no other King but Caesar. From this time, the hideous storms of
Gods wrath and anger against them, for their own sins, and the sins of their
forefathers, did daily increase; and at last were poured out in full measure
upon them, when they had no Prophet nor any man that understood any more; no
Psa. 74. 10
Signs or Tokens but such as were dismal; no Pilot or skilful Governor to
direct them* no pious Priest to make Intercession for them. For having thus
solemnly abandoned The Son of God their King and Lord, who had been their
continual Sanctuary; the destroying Angels, who had long waited their
Opportunity to put their Commission in Execution, did Arrest their bodies,
delivering up some to the Famine, some to the Sword, others to the Fowls of the
air and Beasts of the field, and did seize upon their Land, which God had given
to their Forefathers, for the use of others, even for the most wicked of the
Heathens, Luke 4* 6. Ezekiel. 7. 21* 24.

Dan. 4. 17.


first bestowing it upon the Romans, afterward upon the Saracens, and last of
all upon the Barbarous Turk, under whose heavy yoke the inheritance and some of
the posterity of Jacob have long groaned, and still must groan until they
confess their own sins and the sins of their forefathers, and return unto the
Allegiance of their Gracious Lord and Sovereign whom their Forefathers (this
present generation in my Text) had crucified. But so returning unto him by true
Repentance he will return unto them in mercy, and be as gracious and
favorable to the last Generations of this miserable people, as he was of old
unto the first or best of their Forefathers. For in this Case especially, and
in this and the like alone, that Saying of our Apostle, which some in our days
most unadvisedly and impertinently mis-apply and confine to their own
particular state in Grace, or Gods Favor, is most true, The Gifts of God are
without repentance. That Lord and God whom they solemnly forsook has not
finally forsaken them, but with unspeakable patience and long-suffering still
expects their Conversion. For which, Christians above all others are bound to
pray. Convert them Good Lord unto the Knowledge, and us unto the Practice of
that Truth, wherewith thou have elightened our souls, that our Prayers for them
and for our selves may ever be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord our strength and
our Redeemer.

Amen, Amen.

fol. 3729. where this was the 4 Question propounded.
unto this Audience a year ago) One (and that one of greatest difficulty) was;
How the sins of former Generations can be required of later, From Abels to
Zachariahs death were 3000. years. from Zach. to these words spoken were 00. or
900.
specially in so great a distance of time as was between the death of Abel and
of Zachariah, and this last Generation which crucified the Lord of life: the
Discussion whereof is my present Task.

In this disquisition you will I hope dispense with me for want of a formal
Division or Dichotomie, because the Channel through which I am to pass is so
narrow and so dangerously beset with Rocks and shelves on the right hand and on
the left; as there is no possibility for two to go on breast, nor any room for
Steerage, but only Towage. One passage in my Disquisition must draw another
after it, by one and the same direct Line.

For first, if I should chance to say any thing which either Directly, or by
way of Consequence might probably infer this Affirmative Conclusion, [That
God does at any time punish the children for the fathers sins, or later
generations for the Iniquities of former;] This were to contradict that
Fundamental Truth which the Lord himself has so often protested by Oath, Ezekiel.
18. 1, 2, etc. And the word of the Lord came unto me again, saying: What mean
ye that ye use this Proverb concerning the Land of Israel, saying; the Fathers
have eaten sour grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set on edge? As I live,
says the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this Proverb in
Israel. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the Father, so also the soul
of the Son is mine; the soul that sins it shall die. And again, verse the
last; I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord God:
wherefore turn your selves and live ye.

Now to contradict any Branch of these or the like Protestations or Promises,
would be to make shipwreck of Faith, more dangerous then to rush with full sail
upon a Rock of Adamant.

On the other hand, if I should affirm any thing, either directly, or
indirectly, which might infer any part of this Negative [That God does not
visit the sins of the Fathers upon the Children, or of former Generations upon
later:] This were to strike upon a shelf no less dangerous then to dash against
the former Rock; directly to contradict Gods solemn Declaration (in the second
Commandment) of His Proceedings in this Case, which are no less just and
equal, then the former Promise, Ezekiel the 18. By this you see the only safe
way for passage through the straits proposed must be to find out the middle
Line, or Mean, whether Medium Abnegationis, or Participationis; or in one word,
The difference betwixt this Negative [God does not punish the Children for the
Fathers sins] and the other Affirmative [God visits the sins of the Fathers
upon the Children, even unto the third and fourth Generation, etc.]

2. But in the very first setting forth, or entry into this narrow Passage,
some here present perhaps have already discovered a shelf or sand, to wit, that
See a following Sermon, on 2 Kings 23. 26.
the passage forecited, out of the second Commandment, does better reach or
fit the Case concerning Josiah his death, and the calamity of his people, then
the present difficulty or Problem now in handling. For Josiah was but the
third in succession from Manasseh, and dyed within fewer years, then a
Generation A Generation contains thirty years: betwixt Manasseh's and Iosiahs
death were about thirty three years.
in ordinary Construction imports, after his wicked Grandfather. But if the
blood of Zachariah the son of Jehoiada, or other Prophets slain in that Age, or
the Age after him, were required of this present Generation; God does visit the
sins of Forefathers upon the Children, after more then three or four, after
more then five times five Generations, according to St. Matthew's account in
the Genealogy of our Lord and Savior. Yet this seeming Difficulty The
Objection is hardened by taking in Abels Blood. Zechariah was slain 900. years,
Abel 3800. years before Christ spoke the words of the Text.
(to use the Mariners Dialect) is rather an Over-fall then a shelf, or at the
worst but such a shelf or sand as cannot hinder our passage if we sound it by
the Line or Plummet of the Sanctuary, or number our Fathoms by the scale of
sacred Dialect in like Cases. For when it is said in the Second Commandment,
that God does visit the sins of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third
and fourth generation of them that hate Him: This is, Numerus certus proincerto
aut indefinito: an expression or speech equivalent to that of the Prophet Amos.
For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four I will not turn away the
punishments thereof. For three transgressions of Tyrus* and for four; for three
transgressions of Ammon, and for four, etc. Throughout almost every third verse
of the first Chapter, and some part of the Second. The Prophets meaning is,
that all the Kingdoms or several Sovereignties there mentioned by him,
especially Judah and Israel should certainly be punished, not for three or four
only, but for the multitude of their continual transgressions, and many of
them, transgressions of a high and dangerous nature. Both speeches, as well
that in Amos, as in the Second Commandment (reverently to compare magna
parvis) are like to that of the Poet,

O terque quaterque beati; that is, most happy. So that (unto the third and
fourth generation) may imply more then seven times seven generations; as many
several successions of men or families as have lived since Abels death unto
this present day. All this being supposed or admitted; yet the Expression of
Gods mercies in the same Commandment unto the children of such as love him and
keep his Commandments; is a lively Character of that Truth which we must
believe, to wit, That Gods Mercy as far exceeds his Justice toward men,
as a thousand does three
or four, unless they desperately make up the full measure of their own and
their forefathers sins, either by positive transgressions, or by slighting, or
not repairing in time, unto the outstretched wings of his Mercy. In this Case
they provoke or pull down the heavy stroke of his outstretched Arm of Justice.

3. This difficulty in the Entry into or Bar of this narrow passage being
cleared, we may safely proceed by the former way proposed; that is, by
searching the Mean or sounding the difference between these two Absolute
Truths. 1. [God never punishes the Children for their Fathers sins.] Secondly,
[God usually visits the sins of the Fathers upon the Children, etc.]

The most punctual difference of these two undeniable Truths, to my
apprehension and Observation, is this: To punish the Children for their Fathers
sins, What it is to punish Children for their fathers sins.
implies a punishment of some persons (be they more or few) without any
personal guilt in them, or actual transgressions committed by them. And thus to
do in awarding punishments temporary, whether Capital or Corporal (for with
punishments everlasting, or in the world to come, I dare not meddle or
interpose my verdict) were open injustice. The sons of Traitors or Rebels
against the Crown and dignity of the State wherein they live, are not by
humane laws obnoxious to any Corporal or Capital punishment, unless they be in
some degree guilty of their Fathers treason or rebellion, not by misprision
only, but by Association. And however Good Laws do deprive guiltless Children
of the Lands and Titles of honor which their Fathers enjoyed; yet are they
oftentimes upon their good demeanor restored to their blood, and to the lands
and dignities of their Ancestors, even by such Princes as are no fit paterns of
that Clemency which becomes Princes; Not so much as good foyls to set forth
or commend the clemency and benignity of God, if we consider it, as it is
avouched by Ezekiel in the eighteenth Chapter. However earthly Princes may
demean themselves toward the guiltless or welldeserving sons of Traitors or
Rebels, the reason or intendment of severest public Laws in this Case
provided, was not to lay any punishment upon the Children, but rather a Tie or
bond upon their Fathers not to offend in this high kind, so often as otherwise
they would do, save only for the love they bear unto their Children and
posterity, or for the fear of tainting their blood, or dishonouring their
Friends and Families. Of the equity or good intendment of such Laws we have the
fairest pattern in the forecited place of Ezekiel, chap. 18. 31, 32. Cast away
from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed, and make you a
new heart and a new spirit, For why will ye die O ye house of Israel? For I
have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord God; wherefore
turn your selves and live ye.

4. To visit the sins of the Fathers upon their Children, always supposes
What it it is to visit the sins of fathers, etc.
some degree of personal guilt in the Children: yet such a guilt or such
transgressions as would not be punished so greivously either for measure or
manner as usually they are, unless their Fathers had set them bad Examples by
sinning in the same or like kind. But the Circumstances or Conditions which
most aggravate or bring the heaviest visitation of Fathers sins upon the
Children Two particulars hastening and justifying the visiting of the Fathers
sins upon the children.
are these.

First, if their Fathers have been punished citra condignum, that is, in a less
measure or lower degree then their personal transgressions had deserved.

The Second, if their Fathers punishments have been upon Register or Record so
remarkably suited unto their sins, that their Children might (as they ought)
have taken notice of the occasions of Gods displeasure against them or
punishing hand upon them.

To draw these Generals more close unto the Hypothesis, or to join them
together by annexing some particular Instances unto them.

Few here present can be so ignorant either of domestic or public Statutes
amongst us, but may easily observe that the same offense being re-iterated or
often committed by one and the same party, is, or ought to be, more greivously
punished for the second Turn then for the first, more greivously for the third
time then for the second, more for the fourth, then for all the three former.

This manner of proceeding in Colleges or Academical Societies, is most
agreeable to the Ancient Constitutions of this Kingdom for the manner of
Processes in Courts Ecclesiastic.

The not appearing upon lawful Summons in Courts Ecclesiastic, was for the
first neglect, but a mulct of Twenty pence according to the Rate of money in
those days. The second mulct for not appearing upon like Summons did double
the first; and so did the third, the second. The mulct for the fourth neglect
did more then double or treble all the former. For the party thus offending the
fourth time in the same kind, became liable to the Writ De Excommunicato
Capiendo, without more ado. And this was an heavy punishment if it were
executed according to William Rufus his Constitutions. Note here 1. That God
made this Covenant with them and their Posterity in successive Generations as
with one man, or one aggregate Body or Corporation. 2. It was not only a
Covenant of Life and Promises, but of Threatenings and Death also.


Now the Covenant of Life and Death which God made with the Seed of Abraham, or
with the Sons of Jacob upon their deliverance out of Egypt (afterward, in
more express words, with the house of David, or tribe of Judah throughout their
generations) is the true Pattern or Authentic leading Case of all Just and
Legal Proceedings, with One and the same Party, for often committing the same
Offense; especially in Case he had been solemnly forewarned, whether without
any punishment at all, or with some light punishment annexed for the first
time. Every fore-warning makes the following offense, though in it self not so
great, a great deal more heinous and liable to more grievous punishment.

5. To take a more particular view of the peculiar Aspect, which these heavenly
Lights (Gods Laws I mean) had to the Seed of Jacob, or Kingdom of Israel and
Judah: For in respect of other Kingdoms or Nations their aspect admits some
variation: To keep the seed of Jacob upright in the ways of Faithful Abraham,
the God of their fathers left them a Twofold Register God left Israel a
Register of Good and Evil.
to be perpetually continued by his Prophets or other sacred Writers. The One,
containing their forefathers Good deeds and the prosperity which always did
attend them. The Other, of their Forefathers grossest sins or transgressions,
and of the calamities which pursued them. The former Register was to encourage
them to do that which was good and acceptable in his sight. The other, to
deter them from evil, from turning aside from him and his Laws. The manner of
Gods augmenting the punishments or plagues upon succeeding Generations, which
would not take warning by the punishments of their forefathers, usually runs
by the scale of seven.

Every man that sees me (says Cain, after the Lord had convented him for
killing his brother) will kill me; whereas, there was not a man in the world
besides his father and himself; But a man's Conscience (as we say) is a thousand
witnesses: And his Conscience did sufficiently convict him, to have deserved
Execution, whereas there was neither Witness nor Executioner.

According to this Sentence engraven in this murtherous heart, did God
afterward enjoin Noah, and gave it in express Commandment under his hand to
Moses [Whosoever does shed man's blood* by man shall his blood be shed.] If this
Law were Just amongst the Israelites, why was it not executed upon Cain the
first Malefactor in this kind? Nay, why does God expressly exempt him from it,
and punish him with exile only? Doubtless this was from His Gracious Universal
Goodness, which always threats before it strike, offers favor before he
proceed to Judgment, and mingleth Judgment with Mercy, before he proceed in
rigor of Justice. Now Cain had no former warning how displeasant murder was to
God, and therefore is not so severely punished, as every murderer after him
must be. For so it is said, Genesis 4. 15. Whosoever slays Cain, vengeance shall
be taken on him sevenfold. Yet for any of Seths Posterity to have killed
murtherous Cain, had been a sin in its nature far less then for Cain to
murder his righteous brother: yet (by Rule of divine Justice) to be more
greivously punished then Cains murder was; because, in him they had their
Warnings.

6. The same Proportion God observes in visiting the sins of Fathers upon How
neglect of Gods Forewarnings past, hastens judgments; See this Author's second
Sermon upon Ier. 26.
their Children. So in that Great Covenant of Life and Death made with the
Israelites, Levit. 26. 14, 15, 16. After promise of extraordinary blessings to
the Observers of his Law, the Lord thus threatens the transgressors; But if ye
will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these Commandments: And if ye
despise my Statutes, or if your soul abhor my Judgments, so that ye will not do
all my Commandments, but that ye break my Covenant; I also will do this unto
you, I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, etc. But if for all this
they will not yet turn unto him, he will plague them still with the pursuit of
their enemies. Nay it follows, verse 18- And if ye will not hearken unto me,
then will I punish you seven times more for your sins; and if all this will not
reclaim them, these later plagues shall be seven times multiplied, and this
third plague three hundred forty three times greater then the first: and the
fourth Transgression shall likewise be multiplied by seven: So that the same
Apostasy or rebellion, not amended after so many warnings (if we may call the
literal meaning to strict Arithmetical Account) shall in the end be One
thousand one hundred ninety seven times more severely punished then the first.
But it is likely, that a Certain Number was put for an uncertain.

That the visitation of sins of Fathers upon their Children, may be continued
seventy Generations, even from the first giving of the Law by Moses unto the
worlds End, is apparent, from the verses following, Levit. 26. 37. unto This:
[Yet will the Lord still remember the Covenant made with Abraham, etc.]

For not putting this Rule or Law [of confessing their fathers sins] in
practice, the Children of that Generation which put our Lord and Savior to
death, are punished this day with greater hardness of heart, then the Scribes
and Pharisees were. For however They were the very Paterns of Hypocrisy, yet
had they so much sense or feeling of conscience, that they did utterly dislike
their Forefathers Actions, and thought to super-erogate for their Fathers
transgressions, by erecting the Tombs, or garnishing the Sepulchers of the
Prophets whom their Fathers had murdered or stoned to death. But these modern
scattered Jews will not to this day confess their forefathers sins, nor
acknowledge that they did ought amiss, in putting to death the Prince of
Prophets and Lord of Life. And their Fathers sins, until they confess them, are
become their sins; and shall be visited upon them. How Children are bound to
repent of Fathers sins. See this Authors second Sermon on Jerem. 26.


To confess the sins of their Fathers, according to the intendment or purpose
of Gods Law, implies an hearty Repentance for them, and repentance truly hearty
implies not only an Abstinence from the same or like transgressions wherewith
their Fathers had provoked Gods wrath, but a zealous Desire or Endeavor to
glorify God by constant Practice of the Contrary virtues or works of Piety.
This Doctrinal Conclusion may easily be inferred from the afore-cited 18. of
Ezekiel.

7. Sin is more catching then the Pestilence; and no marvel if the plagues due
for it to the Father, in the course or doom of Justice seize on the Son; seeing
the contagion of sin, spreads from the unknown Malefactor to his neighbors;
from the Fields wherein it is by Passengers committed, into the bordering
Cities or Villages; unless the Atonement be made by Sacrifice and such solemn
deprecation of guilt as the Law in this Case appoints, Deuteronomy. 21. 1, 2, etc. If
one be found slain in the Land which the Lord thy God gives thee to possess
it, lying in the field, and it be not known who has slain him: Then thy Elders
and Judges shall come forth, and shall measure to the Cities which are round
about him that is slain. And it shall be, that the City which is next unto the
slain man, even the Elders of that City, shall take a Heifer which has not
been wrought with, and which has not drawn the yoke. And that City shall bring
down the Heifer into a rough valley, which is neither cared nor sown, and shall
strike off the Heifers neck there in the valley: And the Priests the sons of
Levi shall come near (for them the Lord thy God has chosen to minister unto
him, and to bless in the name of the Lord, and by their word shall every
controversy and stroke be tried.) And all the Elders of that City that are
next to the slain man shall wash their hands over the Heiser, that is to be
beheaded in the valley; And they shall answer and say; Our hands have not shed
this blood, neither have our eyes seen it; Be merciful, O Lord, unto thy people
Israel, whom thou have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy People of
Isreal's charge, and the blood shall be forgiven them. So shall thou put away
the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shall do that which is
right in the sight of the Lord. The nearer unto us Actual Transgressors be, the
more they should provoke our zealous endeavors for performance of contrary
duties; otherwise Gods Justice will in time over-sway his mercy; and plagues,
first procured by some one or few men's sins, will diffuse themselves from the
Actual Transgressors deceased unto the whole living Host, and be propagated
from posterity to posterity, though no personal Actors. It is matter of death
to be mere Spectators or Idle Bystanders, where all are bound to take their
Censers and make Atonement.

8. But I have gone far enough in this narrow Passage for Clearing the
Difficulties, which concern the Doctrinal part of my Text; so far, that we
may without the help of Perspective or spectacles discover the point where it
opens it self into a wide Sea or Ocean of useful Applications for all Times,
Places and Persons: Especially for such as sit at the Stern, or are any way
interested in the Government of the great Ship of State. But the time will not
serve me, or if it did, I never had list to become the States-mans Remembrancer
out of the Academical Pulpit, not to exhort or reprove Academicks in the Court
or Presence of Statesmen.

The residue of my message for this present is to you, (Men, Fathers and
Brethren) to you especially unto whom the Lord has delegated the Government A
short Application.
or oversight of others (including my self in the number.) My message shall be
very brief, only This; That we never seek to maintain, either the dignity of
our places or means of private gain or advantages by the examples or practices
of our Forefathers or Predecessors. For this would be the most compendious
way, by which the old wily Serpent could either lead or drive us, to make up
the measure of our Forefathers or Predecessors sins. As common charity binds
us to hope the best of their estate or persons, and not to speak the worst of
their proceedings: so, True Charity toward our own souls permits us to
suppose, that many things have been done so far amiss by them, as by the
forecited Laws of God, will bind us, whilst we beseech him to forgive us our
own sins, so to forgive us also the sins of our Forefathers or
Predecessors, that if they have oppressed any by fraud or violence, or by
unconscionable using advantages of human Laws; that he would give us Grace to
deal our bread unto the hungry, to cover the naked with a garment: That if
they have dishonored Gods Name by intemperance or other impure manner of
living, he would grant the assistance of his Grace unto our Endeavors for
glorifying his Name by sanctity of life in his sight, and by integrity of
conversation amongst men. That if they have offended him by superstition, by
false doctrine or heresy, he would so bless our ministerial function or other
endeavors in our several Callings, that we may lead others in the ways of
truth from which they have erred or caused others to err.

To the C. Reader, An Advertisement of the Publishers.
THis Great Author (as may be seen Fol. 3728. and 3729.) had raised Six
Questions out of the Text: and in the Two last past Sermons (or Chapters) had
spoken to Four (the first four) of those Six Questions.

To the Sixth or last of them, he intended not to say any thing there; because
he had spoken thereto in diverse places of his Writings, and namely in the
fourteenth and fiftteenth Chapters of the seventh Book; and in his First Sermon
upon 2 Chronicles 6. 39.

But he has neither as yet here (I mean, in the two last Sermons) nor
elsewhere, that I can refer the Reader to, spoken any thing concerning the
Fifth Question: Which is One Reason why I subjoyn the ensuing Fragment or
Appendix having something in it relating to That. And (that I may give the
Reader a punctual Account of every particular) It comes to be as a Fragment or
Appendix, Thus. The Author had written a very Large Tractate upon Matthew. 23.
34, etc. Out of this Tractate, upon Occasion, himself had excerpt the Two next
fore-printed Sermons. Leaving out such things as I esteem (so will the Reader I
hope) very worthy to be inserted. And I choose rather to prejudice the Author by
Publishing them in this way, then by stifling them to deprive the Reader of the
Benefit and delight of them. In sum; What follows in this Appendix, may by
easy observation be referred, either,

1, To our Authors Opinion declared in answering the Third Question (which, I
confess, was New to me, and may perhaps seem to others A Paradox:) viz. That
our Saviors Transcendent Goodness so interposed, That His own and His Apostles
Blood was not required of them that shed it.

Or 2. To the Fourth Question, How Fathers sins are visited upon the Children?

Or to the Fifth Question; Is it lawful for any of Christ's followers in
Zacharias his Case to use the like Imprecation [Lord look on it, and require
it?]

Or lastly, to the Sixth Question; With what Intent God sent Prophets, etc.
which is proved To be out of mercy, and to recall them from sin, By two very
apposite Texts. The One, 2 Chronicles. 24. 19. The other, 2 Chronicles. 36. 15.

An Appendix to the two next precedent Sermons.
1. WE do not; God forbid we should deny, This last Generations personal
offenses against our Savior to have been most heinous, most meritorious of
exemplary punishment in this life. But I know not how it This referres to the
third Question propounded Fol. 3729. handled Fol. 3733.
comes to pass, that many Christian Writers, partly by measuring the
greivousness of the Jews offenses amiss; partly by deriving their plagues from
a wrong root, do nurse such security in their hearers, as was in these Jews;
And occasion them to make up the measure of these later Jews sins, as they did
the measure of their forefathers.

In civil Justice we know the same abuse is much greater, and more greivously
punished, whilst offered to an Officer, though but a Petty Constable, then to
a mere private man; greater to a Justice of Peace, then to a Constable, though
greater to a Justice of Assise, then to an ordinary Justice; but Greatest of
all unto the Prince himself. Thus we imagine the punishment inflicted upon
those Jews for their offenses against our Savior to have been so much more
grievous, then any punishment for the same offense against the Prophets, or any
Temporal Prince, as Christ was greater and better then the Prophets, or earthly
Princes.

In this short Collection, notwithstanding there be three gross Inconsequences.

First: Admitting, that every degree of dignity in the party offended (as much
as can be demanded) brings forth a correspondent degree of excess in the
offense, supposing the matter of the offense to be, (quoad caetera) equal: Yet,
what proportion one degree has to another, or unto what height any personal
offense, though against our Savior Himself, could by this reckoning amount, is
only possible for Infinite Wisdom to determine.

Secondly, Admitting every personal offense against Christ to be infinite in
all such as believe him to be truly God, yet the Jews Case may differ, because
they took him to be but Man.

Thirdly, admitting their personal offenses against him to have been the most
grievous sins, that ever were, or could be committed; This will not infer the
Conclusion intended by Maldonate and others, That the plagues here threatened by
our Savior must wholly be ascribed to the murdering of Him and his Apostles,
without any Reference to the slaughter of Gods Prophets.

The Infiniteness of the Person offended makes up but one and not the greatest
Dimension in the body of sin: the Soliditie or heynousness of it must be
derived See Fol. 3341. and Book 8. in quarto page 142.
from another Root. And though it be most true, that every sin is an offense
against an Infinite Majesty; yet is He, whose Majesty is Infinite in a manner
infinitely more offended with some sins, then with others.

2. Ignorance of those great mysteries (which we believe and acknowledge) did
somewhat mitigate the Jews offenses, as personal against our Savior, and
excuse their Persons a Tanto, though not a Toto. We speak the Wisdom of God --
which none of the Princes of this world knew; for had they known it, they would
not have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8. And Luke 23. 34. They
know not what they do.
again, They of Jerusalem, and their Rulers because they knew him not, nor yet
the voices of the Prophets, they have fulfilled them in condemning him, Acts
13. 27. St. Peter has avouched as much upon his own knowledge, as St. Paul
did, in mitigation of these Jews offense. And now brethren I wot that out of
ignorance ye did it, as did also your Rulers, Act. 3. verse 17. Some rigid
Accuser of these hateful men would perhaps reply that they were ignorant
through their own default. All this being granted, their fault lies properly in
the true and immediate Cause of their Ignorance, not in that ignorance which
was no otherwise Cause of their actual murder, then by not restraining their
malice, which first brought forth ignorance, and then murder. What then were
the true and proper Causes of their malicious Ignorance? Self-conceit of their
own righteousness, pride, ambition, covetousness; unto all which, as also to
their obdurateness in all these, and like enormities; such partial
apprehensions of their fathers idolatry and cruelty in killing the Prophets, as
we have of their hypocrisy and cruelty against Christ, did concur as
Accessarie or Causes Collateral. Being so much addicted to covetousness, to
pride and ambition, and so self-conceited of their own righteousness in respect
of other men, it was impossible they should not do as they did. These
Collections to my apprehension are the same with that of our Savior; He that
believes not, is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name
of the only begotten Son of God. And this is their condemnation: What? That
they went about to kill Christ? No; but that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather then light. But why did they so? Because their deeds
were evil. For every one that does evil hates the light. He that now is
otherwise as evil, as they were before Christ came, would have hated him and
his Disciples, as much as they did, and is as liable, as they were to any
punishment, which they suffered for their trespasses against him. Suppose he
had come into the world in the days of Joash, who put Zachariah to death, done
the same works, used the same admonitions and reproofs to have recalled that
headstrong generation from Idolatry, which he did to reclaim the Scribes and
Pharisees from their hypocrisy and malice; Gods Prophets, which knew their
temper, would not (I am persuaded) have been too forward to have been their
Bails for much better behavior toward their Lord and Master, then they had
showed toward themselves his servants. St. Stephen's Censure of this people
from Does God punish men for what they would have done in such and such Cases?
Quaye.
time to time; [Ye do always resist the holy Ghost: As your fathers did, so do
ye.] gives us occasion to suspect that they were sometimes before Christ's time
so wicked, as if he had come in their days, they would have done as this later
generation did. But these have killed him De Facto; Their sin notwithstanding
is not hereby greater then theirs, that would have been as forward to kill him,
if he had given them the like provocation. For so his manifestation in the
flesh should necessarily have made this later Generation worse then any former
had been, and God had dealt less graciously with them in presenting his Son
unto them, then with their wicked fathers* which never had seen him. But
against these and the like necessary Consequences of the former Position, our
Savior protests; God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but
that the world through him might be saved, John 3. 17. And this salvation was
first (out of love no doubt) to be tendered unto Jerusalem and her children.

3. The Issue of these Deductions in brief is this; The Scribes and Pharisees
did no way exceed their fathers in wickedness, unless perhaps in Hypocrisy or
unwillingness to be reclaimed. Christ was a better Teacher then the Prophets
were, and unto us it is manifest, that these Scribes and Pharisees, which would
not learn goodness of him, were most wickedly wilful; But whether more wicked
or wilful, then any of their fathers before, or others, that lived since that
time have been, is more then man can determine. It must be left to his
judgment, which judges not as man does, by the Event, but by clear sight of
the heart. For the same reason it cannot be resolved, whether they that put our
Savior to death were greater sinners then King Ioash and his Princes: Only
this we know and must believe, That these later did fill up the measure of
their forefathers iniquity; that the complement of their iniquity being come,
the vials of Gods wrath were poured more plentifully upon this last Generation,
then upon any former, but should not have been so plentifully poured upon it,
unless Zacharias and the Prophets had been so desperately slain by their
fathers. And for any Argument that can be brought to the contrary, had Christ
been crucified, when Zacharias was slain, and Zacharias slain when he was
crucified (all other proper Circumstances of each Fact (besides this change of
time) continuing the same) it is probable from my Text, That Gods judgments
upon this Nation, had been less in the former age then they were; and more
grievous, more sudden and terrible in the later, then are now recorded. Nor can
this Consequence be any whit prejudiced, albeit we grant the practices of
cruelty against our Savior to have been seven hundred thousand times more
heinous in themselves, then any could have been attempted against Zacharias.

The destruction of our Saviors Enemies, upon the first Arrest or shameless
abuse of His sacred Body, in justice might, and (without his Intercession)
perhaps would have been more sudden and dreadful then Sodoms was. Obdurate
pride, unrelenting cruelty and general impenitencie for other foul sins, as
they concerned the Whole Trinity, or were matter of sin against the Holy
According to this opinion; Matthew. 12. 32. may have a very commodious
Interpretation.
Ghost, he could not remit or make intercession for them in the days of his
flesh, but is to call their Authors to strict account, as he is the Judge of
quick and dead: But he that by virtue of his Commission, as Son of man did
freely forgive all other sins, did (as my Text imports) remit all personal
offenses, as they only concerned himself, and did not suffer the fruits or
effects of these later Jews malice to come upon Jerusalems score for shedding
of righteous blood. It was not his Will to have any, more greivously punished
for being maliciously bent against him, then they should otherwise have been
for the unrelenting habitual bent of their malice against whomsoever it had
been set. Never was bitter enmity practiced against any so little desirous of
revenge, or so unwilling to accuse his enemies, as he was, for so he protests
unto the Jews which sought his life. Do not think that I will accuse you to the
Father, there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. John 5.
v. 45. Moses, though (till Christ came) the meekest man that had been on earth,
had foretold and solemnly threatened those plagues, whose execution most of the
Prophets had solicited. But this Great Prophet beyond all measure of meekness
and patience, whereof humanity, so but mere humanity, is capable, seeks by
prayer, by reproof, by admonitions and exhortations, by all means justly
possible to prevent them; he often fore-warns what would be the issue of their
stubbornness, which he never mentions but with grief and sorrow of heart; he
often intimates, that the most malicious murderer amongst this people was not
so desirous of his death, as he was of all their lives, witness his
affectionate prayers seasoned with sighs and tears, even whiles they plotted
the execution of their long-intended mischief against him.

4. That which first moved me to make, and must justify the interpretation of
these words here made, is a remarkable Opposition expressly recorded in
Scripture betwixt our Saviors and his Disciples desires uttered at their death
for this peoples good, and the cry of Abels blood, and Zachariah's dying voice,
both soliciting vengeance from Heaven against their persecutors. When they
were come to the place, called Calvarie, they crucified him; Then said Jesus,
Father forgive them; for they know not what they do, Luke 23. ver. 33. This
Infinite Charity, notwithstanding, some (always jealous, least God should show
any token of love toward such as they mislike, or Christ manifest any desire
of their salvation, whom they have marked for Reprobates) would have restrained
unto the Garrison of Soldiers that conducted him to the Cross. But Reasons we
have many to think, or rather firmly to believe, that he uttered those Prayers
Indefinitely for all, that either were Actors in this business, or Approvers of
it, whether Jews or Gentiles: And if both his Doctrines and Miracles, whiles he
lived on earth (as all must acknowledge) did, why should not his dying Prayers
in the first place respect the lost sheep of Israel? Roman Soldiers they were
not, but Jews of the most malignant stamp, which martyred St. Stephen; yet
after he had commended his spirit unto Jesus in near the same terms, that Jesus
did his unto his Father, he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord lay
not this sin to their charge; And when he had said this he fell asleep, Acts 7.
60. It is no sin I hope to suppose, that the Master was every way as charitable
at his death as his Disciple. It is requisite that he, which bids us bless our
persecutors, should set us a more exquisite pattern, then we are able to
express; His prayers for his greatest persecutors were more fervent and
unfeigned, then ours can be for our dearest friends. St. Stephen in thus
praying for his enemies did but imitate his Master, and bear witness of his
loving kindness toward all. But when Cain had killed Abel, the voice of his
blood cried unto the Lord from the earth; and the cry procured a curse upon
him; for the earth became barren unto him, and he was a fugitive and vagabond
from the Land, wherein he lived before: Herein (as St. Augustine excellently
observes) a Type of the Jewish Nation, who having the prerogative of birthright
amongst Gods People, for the like sin became fugitives and vagabonds on the
face of the earth, whilst the good Land, which God gave unto their fathers
has been cursed with barrenness and desolation for their sakes* And this Cry of
Abels blood against his brother, God would have registered in the beginning of
his book, as a Proclamation against all like impious and bloody Conspiracies
until the worlds end: Whereby the Jews, to whom the manner of Gods process with
Cain, was sufficiently known, were condemned Ipso Facto, without any further
folicitation of Gods judgments, then their own attempts of like practices. No
marvel if his punishment foreshadow theirs, when as never any did so manifestly
and notoriously revive his sin, as this Generation here spoken of did. Cain
(says St. John) was of that wicked one, and slew his brother? And wherefore
slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous, 1
John 3. 12. Ye are of your father the devil (says our Savior to these Jews)
and the lusts of your father ye will do; he was a murderer from the beginning;
John 8. v. 44.

And why did they go about to murder him?

Because he had told them the truth which he had heard of God; ver. 40. And as
he had taught before in the third of S. John, They would not receive him,
although he came as a light into the world, because their deeds were evil.

Moses had foretold, That the Great Prophet, was to be this peoples Brother;
and, in that they would not hearken to him, they stood condemned by Moses's
Sentence; Deuteronomy. 18. 18. Whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he
shall speak in my name, I will require it of him, v. 19.

Abel, as pleasing God by his sacrifice, and as being slain by his ungratious
brother, was the live Type of Christ, as man, whose murder by his brethren,
though most displeasant, yet his sacrifice was most acceptable unto his God.
The same God, which in the fourth of Genesis admonishes Cain, partly by
threatening, partly by promises, to desist from his wicked purposes, does here
in my Text as lovingly, and yet as severely dehort these Jews from following
his footsteps, least his punishments fall heavier upon them: And they not
taking warning by Cain's example (to repent them of their envy and grudging
against their brother) the Cry, not of Christ's blood which they shed, but of
Abel's, overtakes them; for Christ was consecrated as the Sanctuary, or place
of Refuge, whereto they should have fled; And Abel was the Revenger of blood,
which did pursue them. So likewise does the Cry of Zacharias's at his death;
(for that was quite contrary to our Saviors and St. Stephen's) When he died he
said; The Lord look upon it, and require it, 2 Chronicles. 24. 22, The present
Effect of this his dying speech compared with St. Lukes narration of Our
Saviors Admonition, affords the true Comment on my Text, Therefore (said the
wisdom of God) I will send them Prophets and Apostles, and some of them they
shall slay; That the blood of all the Prophets shed from the foundation of the
world, may be required of this generation, from the blood of Abel unto the
blood of Zacharias; Verily I say unto you, it shall be required of this
generation, Luke 11. v. 49, 50, 51. The Emphatical resuming of the Terms which
Zacharias used [It shall be required of this generation] implies as much, as if
our Savior had said, The day of vengeance and execution, which Zacharias
solicited against your fathers for their Apostasy from God, and their Cruelty
toward him, is yet to come. His innocent blood, which was in part required of
that wicked King and the Princes which shed it, shall be required in fuller
measure of this generation, which is more bloodily minded then that was, and
herein worse then all the former, in that it will not take warning, either by
Cain's punishment, or the calamities which befell this people for their cruelty
toward Zacharias and other Prophets: For the Army of the Syrians came with a
small company, and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hands*
because they had forsaken the Lord; So they executed judgment against Joash;
And left him in great diseases; and his own servants conspired against him for
the blood of the sons of Jehoiadah the Priest, and slew him, 2 Chronicles 24 24, 25.

5. Yet some there be which question, Whether Zacharias did not use these This
relates to the fifth Question.
words only by way of Prophecy, fearing belike, least his using of them by way
of Curse, or Imprecation, might argue he died not in perfect charity. But
seeing he was a Prophet, he might foresee many reasons unknown to us, not to
pray for them, but against them. Or if out of the bitterness of his soul, or
indignation at this graceless Kings ingratitude, he did thus pray against him,
and his people; we may not condemn him of sin, although it would be a damnable
sin in us to imitate him in like Cases; Nor is it necessary we should think he
did wish their eternal destruction, but only indefinitely desire, that God
would not suffer such an Execrable Conspiracy to go unpunished, least others
should be emboldened to do the like. And though we know not upon what motives
or warrants all other Prophets of God, or Types of Christ, in their perplexity
and distress so zealously pray for vengeance against their malicious
persecutors: yet we should know One true Use or End of these their usual
practices to be this; that the world might note the difference between them,
and the promised Messiah; who though he had suffered greater indignities, more
open shame, and more grievous vexations at this peoples hands, then all his
forerunners had done: yet never complains, never prays against them, but for
them, even whiles they crucify him. This his peculiar Character argues he came
into the world not to condemn, but to save it. And when his Disciples desire
him to call down fire from heaven, as Elias did, he derives his sharp Check
from this Principle* which they should have known; Ye know not what Spirit ye
are of; for the Son of God is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them,
Luke 9. 55. Did then Elias or Elisha his Scholar sin in taking vengeance upon
the enemies of their God? Who dare avouch it? Or if to execute vengeance were
lawful to them, as they were Prophets, was it unlawful for Zacharias upon
greater personal indignities to desire the Lord would revenge his death? Yet
Christ's Disciples might not do so, because they were to be of another Spirit,
as having a better example set by their Master at his death.

6. But whence is it, that Zacharias's curse should take better effect against
This relates to the third Question.
this Generation, which had never offended him, never known him, then our
Saviors prayers powered out for their safety, whiles he offered himself in
sacrifice? Was it possible, Zacharias's spirit of cursing and indignation
should be stronger, so long after his death, then the spirit of prayer and
blessing was in the Redeemer of Isreal's living mouth? God forbid! Rather this
Generation by reviving their forefathers sins, awaked Gods Justice to renew
their plagues; and by their impenitencie made themselves incapable of that
General Pardon, which Christ had procured for all that be penitent, or would
rightly use it: But neither did he pray, that their stubbornness might be
pardoned, nor did Zachariah's curse make them stubborn. Their impenitency is
from themselves, and whiles they continue stubborn and impenitent, they can
have no Allowance of that General Pardon, which they will not plead or stand
to, as standing too much upon their own integrity. Since Christ's death they
have been perpetually punished for their impenitencie, yet not punished with
perpetual impenitencie for putting him to death.

But take we them, as they are in their impenitency, may we think they were
thus grievously punished for shedding His Blood, or for the blood of Abel,
Zacharias, and other Prophets, unjustly shed by their forefathers? for their
personal hatred against him as the Son of God; or for their habitual hatred and
opposition unto that truth which made his person and presence, as it had done
all the Prophets before him, so hateful unto them?

They were plagued questionless for that Blood which was required of them; And
that was Zacharias's and Abel's Blood, not Christ's.

7. That this multiplication of punishment cannot be meant only of the same
After the Citation of Levit 26. 14, etc. and multiplication of the plagues by
seven, This followed, relating to the fourth Question.
persons multiplying the same or the like offenses, but withal of different
ages or successions, is apparent, partly because it is spoken generally of the
whole State or Nation; partly from the different specifical quality, or extent
of the plagues here mentioned, often inflicted on several generations of the
Israelites; But specially from the Tenor and purpose of the Law it self*
strictly enjoining the scattered Relics of this people, after execution of
the last plague, To confess the iniquity of their Fathers, as an especial Duty
to be performed on their parts, and as a necessary mean in Gods Ordination for
their Absolution, or deliverance. And if without Confession of their fathers
iniquity, they cannot be absolved from their own; their fathers iniquity not
repented of, was their own; so was the punishment due unto it. The Consequence
is evident to Reason, but more evident from the express words of the Text; Ye
shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
And they that are left of you, shall pine away in their iniquity in your
enemies lands, and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away
with them. If they shall (then) confess the iniquities of their fathers, with
their trespass, which they trespassed against me, and that also they have
walked contrary unto me. And that I have also walked contrary unto them, and
have brought them into the land of their enemies; If then their uncircumcised
hearts be humbled, and they Le. 26. 38.
then accept of the punishment of their iniquity. Then will I remember my
Covenant with Jacob, and also my Covenant with Isaac, and also my Covenant with
Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the land.

Gods Covenant is with his people (whether Jews or Gentiles) and their children
jointly: Every Child is born, as it were, heir to his Fathers sins and their
plagues, unless he renounce them by taking their guilt upon him in such hearty
Confession, as this law prescribes, and patient submission of himself to Gods
correction. To satisfy Gods justice for the least trespass committed by our
Ancestors is impossible; But to avert their just punishment from our selves, by
unfeigned Conversion unto God in those particulars, wherein our fathers have
forsaken him, is a duty possible, because necessary to every faithful soul. As
if the father have been an unconscionable gatherer or cruel oppressor, the son
is more strictly bound, then otherwise he were, to abound in works of mercy
toward the poor; to give liberally to such as need; to lend freely to such as
desire rather their kindness then mere Alms. If the father have been a
blasphemer, or grievous swearer, the son must consecrate his tongue to God, and
use no speech, but such, as may minister grace unto the hearers. Briefly;
Posterity (besides performance of duties common to all)
must always be zealous observers of those precepts, which their forefathers
have principally transgressed. The truth of this Inference is warranted by that
very Text of Scripture, entirely considered, whose first passages are by
worldlings brought against it. What more common shelter for security in this
kind? then the Prophets speech: The soul that sins it shall die, Ezekiel. 18.
v. 4. But every soul, that sees his fathers sins, and sorrows not for them,
sins them over again. And now, Lo (says the Prophet) if he beget a son, that
sees all his fathers sins which he has done, and considers, and does not
such like; one, that has not oppressed any, nor withheld the pledge; one,
that has not spoiled by violence: shall he, by not doing all, or any of these,
escape Gods wrath kindled against his father? No; Performance of Negatives
makes no man just: If doing none of these, he has given his bread to the
hungry (whom his father deprived of food) covered the naked (whom his father
spoiled) with a garment: And taken off his hand from the poor (on whom his
fathers hand was heavy) if he has not received usury nor increase, but has
executed my judgments, and has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the
iniquity of his father (says the Lord) he shall live, Ezekiel. 18. 14, 15, 16.

From these Laws thus expounded, specially from that of Gods visiting the sins
of fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generation: The reason
is plain, why some Royal or noble families have had their Fatal See one example
in the next Sermon.
Periods in the days of such, as, to the sight of men, were no way so heinous
offenders as their fore-elders had been. With instances to this purpose, you
that can read may furnish your selves out of Histories sacred and moral,
domestic and foreign. Every one of you may without reading observe; that many
extortioners or cruel oppressors children, come oft-times to greater misery
then their fathers in this life suffered; albeit they did not so well deserve
it in your judgments. But if positive or actual transgressions otherwise equal
be liable by the Rule of Divine Justice, to more then double punishment in the
son, that has had fair warnings in his father: It is very consonant to the
same Rule, that the son, albeit he do not imitate his forefathers in actual
transgressions, should suffer greater temporal punishments, then they did, for
not confessing their sins, as Gods Law requires; or not glorifying Gods name by
his fidelity in contrary practices of charity, and godliness. Many children by
not making restitution of goods ill gotten by some of their Ancestors, have
forfeited unto Gods hands whatsoever all had gotten. The best way for all to
make kingdoms, or private inheritances greater in length or duration;
would be to diminish them in mass, or substance, by paring off what is tainted
or corrupted.

But leaving these particulars to the Application, let us apply the doctrine
hitherto generally delivered unto the point in Question. We must consider, that
the Jewish Nation had many fore-warnings of Gods displeasure in the Ages before
Zacharias; That in his time, both Prince and People, the whole Nation stood as
condemned by that his sentence solemnly pronounced Ex Cathedra; [ye shall not
prosper; ye have forsaken the Lord, and the Lord has forsaken you:] though
God, tempering his judgments with mercy, reprieved this State in hope of
amendment. But of succeeding Princes some proved more gross Idolaters then
Joash had been; viz. Ahaz: Some shed more innocent blood then he had done; so
did Manasses. And of the people more grew worse, few better, then their fathers
had been; such as were better were not so forward to expiate the sins of former
times, as the worse sort were to augment them. And according as they were
augmented, Gods judgments did gather and multiply by degrees against this
people; And the sentence solemnly denounced by Zachariah, often re-iterated in
more severe terms by later Prophets, is executed at length, according to the
full measure of their iniquity; witness the first and second destruction of the
City and Temple, the desolation of the Land, and captivity of the whole Nation.
The whole manner of Gods proceeding against them, first in Mercy, then in
Judgment, lastly in Severity and fury is most directly set forth unto us by Our
Savior in the Parable of the Vineyard let out to husbandmen, whose estate in
it was utterly void upon the first Non-payment of rent, if the Lord had dealt
in justice with them. But though of his servants, or rent-gatherers they had
beaten one, and killed another, and stoned a third; yet in merciful expectation
of their amendment he sent other servants, mo then the first, and they did unto
them likewise.

Though this iniquity exceeded the former, yet the Lords mercy exceeded both:
and out of his abundant kindness, last of all he sent His Son, saying, [They
will reverence my Son.] But as mercy had abounded; so their sins did still
super-abound: For when they saw the Son, they said among themselves, [This is
the Heir; Come let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance:] And as
they said, so they did; [They caught him, and cast him out of the Vineyard, and
slew him.] So fully ripe for Justice was iniquity once come to this height,
that they themselves, whom this Case concerns, adjudge the authors of this
murder incapable of mercy. For to Our Savior demanding of them [When
therefore the Lord of the vineyard comes; What will he do unto these
husbandmen?] They make Reply [He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and
will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the
fruits in their season, Matthew. 21. Luke 20.

Most men (I doubt not) understand the General meaning of the Parable. And it
is in effect the same with the Prophets Song of his Beloved concerning his
vineyard, Esaias 5. 1. The one is as a Paraphrase upon the other; The histories
of this Nation from that time to this, is as a full and just Commentary upon
both. The vineyard of the Lord of hoasts (says the Prophet, v. 7.) is the
house of Israel; and the men of Judah his pleasant plants; And being reasonable
plants, they were also the husbandmen here meant. The fruits looked for were
Judgment, and in stead of it behold, oppression: righteousness, See St.
Chrysostom. upon the fifth of Isaiah.
and in lieu hereof, behold a Cry. These were wild grapes. If any list to
descend to more particulars, By the fruitful hill, wherein the vineyard was
seated; he may understand the hill of Sion, or Jerusalem; by the Tower, the
Temple: By the hedge the fortifications of Jerusalem, begun by David, without
which our Savior (who is the heir meant in the Gospel) was crucified; being
sentenced to execution within the vineyard. The judgment, which the chief
Priest and Elders gave against themselves: was by the Prophet referred unto the
Inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah. The Tenor of it is the same in
the Prophet and the Evangelist, I will tell you (says the Prophet) what I will
do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten
up, and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down; And I will
lay it waste, and it shall not be pruned, or dug; But there shall come up
briars and thorns. I will also command the Clouds, that they rain no rain upon
it: That is, Not whiles it remained in Judah, whose mountains are now become
like the mountains of Gilboah, accursed for the slaughter of the King of Israel.

The execution of this Sentence was fitted to diverse times in different
measure, according to their unfruitfulness, or fertility in bringing forth wild
grapes, when good grapes were most expected.

More exactly parallel to the Parable, as it is proposed by our Savior, we
Judahs Climacterical Seasons
may (besides all other particular diseases or distempers of this flourishing
State) observe Three principal Climacterical Seasons. In the first and second
it escapes very hardly, and dies in the last.

The First we take from Zachariah's death; a Season, wherein God (the men or
Judah being Judges) might justly expect extraordinary fruit of his vineyard.
For Jehoiada the High Priest, father in Zachariah, had lastly 1. at the death
of Zechariah.
pruned and dressed it, re-ingrafting Joash, as a forlorn Plant, into the stock
of David, from which he had been for a while dis-planted by Athaliah the Queen
Regent; through whose cruelty all the rest of the Royal Branches utterly
perished: But instead of grapes the Princes bring forth wild grapes. After the
death of Jehoiada, Came the Princes and made obeisance to the King; who
hearkened unto them. And they left the House of the Lord and served groves: So
wrath came upon Judah, for this trespass. Yet he sent Prophets to them, to
bring them again unto the Lord; and they testified against them; but they would
not give ear. After all this, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Zachariah, and
he said unto them, Thus says God; Why transgress ye the Lords Commandments
that ye cannot prosper? 2 Chronicles. 24. 17, 22. He said no more then Moses their
Lawgiver had expressed in that Divine Song, Deuteronomy. 32. which this people were
to teach their children, that it might be a witness against them.
Notwithstanding in despite of Moses Law, and the Spirit of the Lord, which
emboldened Zachariah to preach it; they confirm their desperate league with the
Prophets blood, that did dissuade it.

Of those other Servants of the Lord, sent unto them about the same time; we
may without breach of charity suspect; one at least was beaten and another
slain; Because it is certain, that Zachariah, whose Father had deserved so well
of King, Princes and People of Judah, was by the Kings appointment stoned to
death. And (besides the Calamities of war, which befell the Land in the end
of that year) the Temple, in which he died, was by his dying curse designed to
ruin and destruction. It could not be purged from guilt of his guiltless
blood, but by that fire, which in the next generation did devour it.

Yet before the approach of this Second Climacterical Season; The Lord Second
Climacterical of Judah at the carrying into Babylon.
God of their fathers sent to them by his Messengers, rising up betimes, and
sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place.
But they mocked the Messengers of God, despised his words, and misused his
Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose, till there was no remedy, 2 Chronicles.
36. 15, 16, 17.

8. This affectionate description of Gods tender care and compassion in sending
Prophets to reclaim them, argues (what Our Savior expresses in the This
Referres to the sixth Question.
Parable) That he sent more, then before. And in the age following Zachariah's
death, lived all the Prophets, whose Prophecies are extant; But unto all those
(though more) they did, as they had done unto the former, Isaiah (as the Jews
confess) was slain by Manasses; Uriah (as you heard before) was killed by
Jehoiakim; and Jeremiah sometimes beaten, sometimes imprisoned, perpetually
abused, during the reign of Iehoiakim and Zedekiah; And so at length the
plagues threatened, and in part executed upon this people immediately after
Zechariah's death, are multiplied upon that wicked generation. The Rod of Gods
wrath is for fashion the same, but now more sharp and terrible. Their fathers
had slain Zachariah in the Temple: And for this sin not expiated, but continued
and approved, at least by like practices of this Generation; The Lord brought
upon them the King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in
the house of their Sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young men or maidens,
old men, or him that stoopeth for age, he gave them all into his hand. And all
the vessels of the House of God, great and small, and the treasures of the
House of the Lord, and the treasures of the King and of his Princes; all those
he brought to Babylon, 2 Chronicles. chapter 36. v. 17, 18. What are those but* mere
enlargements of the former calamities, which ensued the Butchery of Zacharias?
which were these. It came to pass in the revolution of the year, that the host
of Syria came up against Joash, and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and
destroyed all the Princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the
spoil of them unto the King of Damascus, 2 Chronicles. 24. 23. Some principal
particulars of the spoils here intimated, are fully expressed, 2 Kings 12.
where the rest of this story is omitted: And Jehoash King of Judah took all the
hallowed things, and all the gold, found in the treasures of the House of the
Lord, and in the Kings house, and sent it to Hazael King of Syria, and he went
away from Jerusalem.

But though the Chaldeans had burnt the House of God and the Palaces of
Jerusalem with fire, had destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof; yet the Lord
does not utterly forsake his vineyard, his Church (the Quire of Saints) still
nestles in the branches that are transplanted, whose off spring within seventy
years is restored unto their native soil, Jerusalem repaired, the Temple
re-edified, and the Land of Judah sown with the seed of man and beast. After
this State thus raised again from Civil Death, if posterity will not believe,
nor bring forth better fruits then heretofore their fathers have done; neither
would they believe, though Moses and the Prophets were raised from the dead to
exhort them to repentance.

For this reason, after their return from Babylon and re-edification of the The
Third Climacterical Period of Judah at Christ's coming.
Temple, God sends no more Prophets (save such as they brought with them) until
the fullness of time, or the Third Climacterical Period of this State, wherein
the disease being become more desperate; he sent his only Son the Heir of all
things, as knowing, that if he could not, none ever after should be able to
recover it. This his Son was that Lord, which, by his peculiar presence, had
brought this vine out of Egypt, but (after he had planted it in Judea, and let
it out unto these husbandmen) went into a far Country, that is, he appeared
not unto them, as he did to Moses, to Joshuah, etc. until in the last days he
descended from Heaven in the true form and substance of man to receive the
fruits: He looked (at this time especially) his vineyard should had brought
forth grapes, but it brought forth more wild grapes then before. He looked for
weighty matters of the Law, and behold tithing of Mint, Annise and Cummin; He
looked for judgment, mercy and faith; But behold, covetousness, extortion,
pride and cruelty; grapes more bitter then the grapes of Sodom; Sourness it
self the very leaven of Hypocrisy; yet upon the first denial of such fruits,
as he expected, he departs not from them, he accuses them not unto his Father:
But (as they had two or three fore-warnings more remarkable then ordinary in
several Generations of their Ancestors; so) he expects a loyal Answer at more
times of fruit, then one or two, presenting himself to them for three years and
more together at every several Passover, besides other anniversary solemnities.
And yet at last for constant delivery of that Embassage, which he had from his
father, they caught him, and condemned him in the vineyard, but carry him out
of it to be crucified in Mount Calvarie. And thus at length Zachariah's
Prophecy against Ioash and his wicked Princes, and his Imprecation at his
death, are fulfilled in this wicked generation; they formally forsook their
God, when they cried [We have no King but Caesar] and demanding Barabbas a
murderer (the son of their father the Divle;) they destoyed Jesus the Son of
God, And the Lord has utterly forsaken them, not the Temple and City only, but
the Inhabitants, but the whole race of the Jewish Nation, and has let forth
His Vineyard to us Gentiles. They were so rich by his bounty, that they were
ashamed to acknowledge so mean a man as Our Savior, for their Lord, and Owner
of the Land they inhabited. And as the Prophet foretold, they hid their faces
from him; And therefore, as Moses testified against them in his dying Song, The
Lord hides his face from them. Darkness did overspread the Land of Judah at
his Passion, and the light of his countenance, since that time, has never
shined upon that Nation. They lost Gods extraordinary Illumination by Urim and
Thummim (as some hold) at Zachariah's death, (as most agree) at the destruction
of Salomon's Temple; but now are destitute of the light of Scripture, without
all knowledge of Gods Word, since they rejected Him, which enlighteneth every
man that comes into the world; In the very sunshine of the Gospel, they grope
like blind men, that cannot see a beaten way, and must so continue throughout
their generations unto the worlds end; until they shall unfeignedly confess the
iniquity of their fathers, and that they have walked contrary unto me; And that
I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of
their enemies, Lev. 26. 40, 41.

As the sins of those Jews, which rejected the Light of the world, and solemnly
revolted from their King; have been thus remarkably visited upon their
children, that will not confess their sins in so doing, nor acknowledge him,
whom they rejected, for their expected Redeemer: So were the sins of that
generation, which slew Zachariah, visited upon this, which crucified our
Savior, because they neither did truly confess them (but rather revive and
increase them) nor finally admit of his Sacrifice, which was appointed for the
expiation of that Prodigious Fact (as of all others) wherewith the City and
Temple had been polluted. Unless God's mercy had warded off the stroke of his
justice, Jerusalem it self had been made an heap of stones* when King Ioash
stoned Zachariah to death: So had the Temple it self, wherein his guiltless
blood lay uncovered, been covered with Dust. The whole Nations plagues in
rigor of justice might have been much greater at that time, then they have
been since.

Now all the mercy or mitigation of Justice, which former Generations found,
was through the Mediation of the Son of God. And seeing these later have been
more refractorie to this their Mediator himself, then were their fathers to his
Prophets; seeing they have solemnly disavowed him, and bid a defiance to his
Ambassadors; Gods mercies, which had daily shrouded Jerusalem from his wrath,
as the hen does her young ones from the storm, leave it, and her children open
to his justice.

For Resolution of the main Point or difficulty proposed; The forsaking, or
putting the Son of God to death, is (for ought I can gather) no direct and
positive cause of all the miseries expressed or intimated in my Text: Only such
a Cause of Ierusalems destruction, as the Pilots absence is of shipwreck; a
Cause of it only in this sense, that her inhabitants by forsaking him have
exempted themselves from his wonted protection; and God's justice, which had
long watched his departure from the City and Temple (as Sergeants do their
egress, which have taken Sanctuary) now attatches them, when there is none to
become their Surety, none to intercede for mitigation of Justice, none to
hinder, why judgments heretofore always abated, and oft-times altogether
deferred, may not be executed upon them in full measure. But that their
Personal Offenses against their Mediator should wholly, or specially procure
this woeful doom, or come at all into the Bill of their Indictment, is (in my
Opinion) no way probable. The character of his own speeches, as well in my
Text, or elsewhere, altogether disclaims this Assertion, as unconsonant to the
form of wholesome doctrine. But may we say, that albeit his blood did not
augment their plagues that shed it, because never laid unto their charge, it
may notwithstanding exempt them and their children from hope of mercy, or
mitigation of punishments due unto them for other sins? Or that such, as since
his death have pined away in their own sins, and the sins of their fathers, did
therefore perish, because he had absolutely decreed not to save them or grant
them means of repentance? God forbid! This were more, then to say [They
stumbled that they should fall.] And in as much, as the riches of the world
will be much greater by their fullness, then by their Fall or diminution, the
fault is ours, as well as theirs, that their Conversion is not accomplished;
Both we and they are liable to a strict account, That we would not be gathered,
when God would have gathered us.

CHAP. XLIV.
2 KINGS 23. 26, 27. Notwithstanding, the Lord turned not from the fierceness
of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of
all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal. And the Lord said,
I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will
cast off this City Jerusalem, which I have chosen, and the house, of which I
have said, my Name shall be there.
1. THe Points to be discussed are Two. Though there be a Sermon upon Matthew. 23
37. yet I thought it best to intersert This here before it.


First, How the Lord might justly punish Judah for Manasseh's sins, and sins
committed in His time, in the days of good Josiah and His Sons.

Secondly, In what manner God proceeded to execute this his fierce wrath
denounced against Judah.

For your better satisfaction in the Former Point, You are to consider, the
Nature and Tenor of Gods General Covenant with this people. The miraculous
Blessings and extraordinary Curses proposed unto the two several ways of Life
and Death, which Moses first had set before this people, are sufficiently
known, being most expressly set down, Levit. 26. and Deuteronomy. 28. throughout the
whole Chapters.

The like Covenant was renewed with David's Line, in the same Tenor. Psalm. 89.
29, etc, His Seed will I make to endure for ever; and his Throne as the days
of Heaven. But if his Children forsake my Law, and walk not in my judgments; If
they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments, Then will I visit their
transgressions with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless, my
loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness
to fail. Or, Neither will I falsify my truth. This promise was Absolute for
Christ, Conditional for the other Sons of David: and consists not in their
Immunitie from punishments, but in the Assurance of their recovery, upon their
penitencie.

The Tenor of both Covenants then (in brief) was Thus. Following Levit. 26.
Deuteronomy. 7. 14. and 28. Amos 3. 2.
the footsteps of Abraham or David, they should be blessed extraordinarily:
Forsaking their ways and following the Customs of other Nations they should be
punished more severely then other men; yet so, that if in their distress they
did turn again unto the Lord, for Abraham's and for David's sake they should be
restored to his wonted mercy and favor. So says the Lord, Levit. 26. 44, 45,
And yet for all that (he supposes his plagues denounced had already overtaken
them) When they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away,
neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my Covenant
with them: for I am the Lord their God. But I will remember them according to
the Covenant of old, Or, I will for their sakes remember the Covenant of their
Ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the Land of Egypt. And in the 42. verse
of the same Chapter, (when they shall confess their iniquity before him in
their distress) He says, He would remember His Covenant with Jacob, and also
his Covenant with Isaac and with Abraham.

The same Covenant is more solemnly established at the Dedication of the
Temple, 2 Chronicles. 6. by Solomon. He supposed this People should be plagued for
their sins, as others were: But yet if they turned to the Lord with all their
heart, and with all their soul, in the Land of their captivity; the effect of
his Petition is; That the Lords eyes should be open, and his ears attent unto
the prayers which they made toward the Temple which he had built. And in this
sense is God said to show mercy unto thousands in such as love Him and keep
his Commandments: Because for Abraham and for David's sake, they still enjoyed
the assurance of recovering their ruinate and decayed Estate.

2. Yet here we are again to consider, that the Covenant was not made In
capita, as if it were to begin entirely with every particular Man; but rather
with their whole Successions in their several Generations. They stood all
jointly bound to obey the Lord their God: So as Posterity must make up the
Arrerages of their Fathers riot, by their wary and diligent observance of
those Commandments which the other had broken. If the Fathers had sinned by
Idolatry, the Posterity must redeem their sins or break them off, by preaching
reformation of Religion, and restoring the true Worship of God again. If the
Fathers had caused Gods wrath upon the Land by oppression, extortion and
cruelty, the Children must divert it, by mercy, bounty and open-handedness
toward the Poor; and by restitution of goods ill-gotten by their Fathers, unto
their proper Owners; or by restoring goods rightly enjoyed, but employed amiss,
unto their natural and right use. If the Fathers have transgressed all or most
of Gods neg. Commandments, the children are bound to rectify their errors, by
practicing the affirmative duties of the Law. In a word, as the Fathers
offenses have been greater, either in multitude, magnitude, or continuance, so
must the Virtues and Piety of Posterity, abound in Perfection of Parts,
Intention of Degrees and Duration of time. For although it be most true, that
the Childrens teeth are not set on edge, for their Fathers eating sour grapes,
but the soul that sins it shall die, Ezekiel. 18. Yet is not this so to be
understood, but that the son may be punished for those sins which his Father
only did actually commit, if so he seek not to rectify his errors, by
inclining to the Contrary Duties: For, not so doing, His fathers sins are made
his by participation, and the Curse becomes hereditary. As he that helps not
when he may, does further or abett the evil done by others, and is thereby made
Accessory or part-taker of other men's sins: So likewise are the Children guilty
of their fathers transgressions, and liable to Gods wrath caused by them, if
they seek not to rectify the same, by their zealous prayers, speedy
repentance and unfeigned turning to the Lord. So is it said, Ezekiel. 18. 14. The
Son that sees all his fathers sins, which he has done, and fears, neither
does such like; but rather if the father have cruelly oppressed and spoiled his
brother by violence, he feeds the hungry, and clothes the naked, and keeps all
Gods Statutes, he shall live. Hence it is, that this people of God in their
distress make The Confession of their forefathers sins as Essential Confession
of forefathers sins a necessary Ingredient of Repentance.
an Ingredient (or Condition) of their prayers, as the confession of their own,
Dan. 9. Ezra 9. Nehem. 9. Psalm. 106: 6, 7. For this the Lord himself had
expressly taught them, Levit. 26. For your transgressions the Land of your
enemies shall eat you up. And they that are left of you shall pine away for
their iniquity, and for the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away
with them also. Then they shall confess their iniquity, and the wickedness of
their fathers. Ver. 38. Thus doing, I will remember (says the Lord) my
Covenant with Jacoo, and my Covenant also with Isaac, and also my Covenant with
Abraham will I remember, and will remember the Land. You see then it is
evident, that as Adam's-sin remains in his Posterity, until it be taken away
in Christ; so does Gods wrath abide upon a Land, for the former Inhabitants
sins, and passes from the Dead unto the Living; unless the Atonement be made
by the sweet incense of prayer and fervencie of spirit, which is to be in every
Christian and spiritual Priests heart as ready upon this occasion, as fire from
the Altar was in Aarons hand, when he stayed the Plague, by standing betwixt
the dead and them that were alive, Numb. 16. 46. It is not the sacrifice,
though of the calves of men's lips, without an humbled and contrite spirit, and
fervent zeal of blessing Gods Name by Contrary good deeds, that can stay the
plague and divert the wrath gone out from God against a Land, for her former
Inhabitants their Predecessors sins.

3. From these Principles we may easily gather, How Gods Mercies may be
abridged toward a Land or People less sinful perhaps then others formerly have
been for actual transgressions, if we consider the sins only of the present
time. From the same Principles we may likewise clearly discern, how the full
measure of any Lands or Peoples iniquity may be accomplished then, when to men's
seeming their outrages be nothing so grievous, as others
before them have been, or when their Princes or Rulers are more then
ordinarily religious.

First, Where the transgressions of Predecessors have been many and grievous,
and the Reformation of their Successors, but slight or imperfect: the wrath of
God procured by the former, may remain still, and light heaviest upon Reasons
why a people less actually sinful is more plagued.
the Third Generation following, who shall procure it further, if they follow
their Grandsires sins, notwithstanding their immediate Parents or Predecessors
did in part repent, or in some sort renounce their Fathers ways. For the
fruits of such repentance, seeing it is not Total and proceeds not from a
perfect and unfeigned heart, do but as it were for a time put off the Fit or
Extremity of Gods wrath: they take not away the disease it self, which
therefore returns to its course again: As the Psalmist excellently describes
the effects of such repentance. When he stew them, they sought him, and they
returned Psalm. 78. ver. 34.
and sought God early. And they remembered that God was their strength, and the
most high God their Redeemer: but their heart was not upright with him: Neither
were they faithful in his Covenant. The fruit of this was, that oft-times he
called back his anger, and would not suffer his whole displeasure to arise:
This stayed the Course or Motion of his wrath; It did not minish the
Inclination or Propension of the same. But when the former sins burst out
again, either in them or their posterity: His judgments drew nearer unto them
then before; and his vengeance was more fierce and sudden.

Secondly, Where the Reformation of Religion and turning unto the Lord is on
the Princes parts perfect and complete, yet the people do not inwardly repent,
and with a perfect heart abjure their forefathers ways: the wrath of
God due unto their fathers sins comes upon them, and is executed by taking
away their good, and giving them Princes alike minded to themselves: And so by
little and little they fulfill the iniquity of their forefathers.

this Land and People, so far over-ballancing his Justice, that all the
Idolatry which Solomon his son had set up (albeit idolatry be a most grievous
sin) did not any more, then bring his Mercy to an Equipoize with it again. But
Rehoboam, following his Fathers footsteps in evil, not his religious
Grandfathers paths in good, pulls down Gods judgments upon his head, and first
bears the rod of his transgression, having more then one half of his Kingdom
rent from him by his servant Jeroboam, and afterward both he and Judah, which
had remained with him, bear the strokes of their iniquity, by the hand of
Shishak King of Egypt, who forraged the Land, and took away the treasures 1
Kin. 14. 25.
of the Temple of the Lord. But in this God did but shake his sword over their
heads: These beginnings of plagues and judgments are but the Motions of His
wrath which abides not: for his Mercy presently retired unto the same Point
where it stood at Jeroboams revolt. Of an unwise father there sprung up
immediately an unrighteous son Abijam, who though he had sometimes Abijam.
good success against his enemies: yet as the sequel of this Story intimates, 1
King. 15. 3. he had almost brought Gods fierce wrath upon the Land, by
following his fathers footsteps; but that the Lord as yet drew back his
punishing hand, for Righteous David his great Grandfathers sake. For David 's
sake did the Lord his God give him a light in Jerusalem, and set up his son
after him, and established Jerusalem, ver. 4. This was Asa, in whose days the
Land had peace: for he followed the footsteps of his Father David, yet Asa.
was there no perfect Reformation wrought in his reign; for the High places
were not taken away: And he himself, after good success in victory, was
infected with the Fatal disease of Kings and Princes, To begin to trust too

much to secular Policy, and grew impatient of the Lords Prophets reproof. But
by his carriage and good example, such as it is, and the righteous reign of his
son Jehosaphat, is the Current of the Lords former wrath stopped; yet so, as it
is ready to overflow the Land with greater violence, in the next succession,
wherein the like iniquity as had reigned in former times, should burst out
afresh again. Although Jehoshaphat's heart was upright: yet did he work no
perfect Reformation. For the high places were not taken away. And as it is, 2 Chronicles. 20. 23. The people had not yet prepared their hearts unto the God of
their fathers: Neither so penitent, as that they could recall Gods wrath, or
bring his mercy back again unto its former stay: Nor yet so extreme bad and
forward in sin, as that the Lord would not spare the Land and be merciful to
them for religious Jehoshaphat and the Righteous sakes, that lived in it. After
Iehoshaphats death, Iehoram his son reigns in his stead (a successor to the
Kings of Israel in all wickedness and Idolatry.) And as his life was wicked, so
was his estate unfortunate, his end terrible, and his death ignominious. In his
days did Edom make his final revolt from Judah, 2 Chronicles. 21. 10. and Libnah,
at the same time, because he had forsaken the God of his fathers. And ver. 14.
Behold (says Elijah to him by a letter,) with a great plague will the Lord
smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives and all thy substance. And so
Gods judgments came upon him and his Children: He himself dies of a lingering
loathsome disease, without the wonted solemnities of Funerals. And Ahaziah his
youngest son (all the elder being slain Ahaziah.

beginnings were good; The reformation of Religion was perfect, for the external
form, so long as Iehoiada the Priest did live, but not complete for the number
or quality of such as turned to the Lord their God. For the Princes hearts were
wholly set upon idolatry: And the King himself is drawn upon his own
destruction by them, after Iehoiada's death. As his beginnings were good and
godly: so were his later days idolatrous and cruel; and Zachariah's blood was
recompensed upon his head, and upon the head of Amaziah his son; who, though he
were not (like his father) guilty as principal Amaziah.
of actual murder in putting a Prophet to death: yet thus far by
Participation guilty of his fathers sin, that he is impatient of the Prophets
just reproof: As his father killed, so he threatens the Prophet for reproving
him for his sins; for taking the gods of Edom for his gods, 2 Chronicles. 25. 14.
Have they made thee the Kings Counselor? Cease thou: why should they smite
thee? And the Prophet ceased, but said, I know the Lord has determined to
destroy thee, because thou have done this, and have not obeyed my Counsel. His
doom is read, and judgment follows: For he is shamefully foiled, 2 Chronicles. 25.

good success, became in his later end, sacrilegiously presumptuous. For
intermedling with the Priests Office, he becomes liable to the Priests
Tribunal: He is judged a Leper, and removed from administration of the Kingdom,
for the leprosy wherewith the Lord had smitten him, 2 Chronicles. 26.

5. Thus in process of time is still the increase of sin: either their Kings
are wicked (as but two from David to Hezekiah's time which continued in good:)
Or if their Kings be virtuous and religious, as Iehoshaphat had been, and
Iotham son to Uzziah now is: yet in his days again the peoples hearts are not
prepared to serve the Lord, 2 Kings 15. 35. But the high Places were not Iotham.
put away; for the people yet offered and burnt incense in the high places; and
so kept in the fire of Gods wrath, which had been long kindled against Judah,
but not suffered to burst out into any flame, in the days of righteous Jotham,
and such as by his example followed righteousness. Nay, to encourage others to
follow him, the Lord gave him victory over the enemies of Judah, and He grew
mighty, because He directed His ways before the Lord His God, 2 Chronicles. 27: 6.

6. But neither did he nor any Prince of Judah, since Righteous David, so
perfectly direct, as Ahaz his son did pervert his ways before the Lord. This
is the first that adds stubbornness to infidelity, and drunkenness to thirst,
as the Ahaz.
Spirit tells us, 2 Chronicles. 28. 22. In his tribulation did he yet trespass more
against the Lord; (this is King Ahaz, says the Text) you must expect a
remarkable monster in his dealings; For he sacrificed unto the gods of
Damascus, which plagued him, and he said: Because the gods of the Kings of Aram
helped them, I will sacrifice unto them, and they will help me: yet they were
his ruin, and of all Israel, ver. 23. This people was always prone to
wickedness, even during the reign of most religious Kings; but are now so
violently carried to all mischief, having got this preposterous Monster for
their Governor, that as a ship sailing with advantage of wind and tide, and
help of oars, continues motion when sail is stricken and Rowers cease; so
Jerusalem and Judah, after Ahaz their Commander in mischief ceased from his
wicked labors, held on still their mischievous courses, even in good King
Hezekiah's days.

7. Whereas Gods threatenings had been but particular heretofore; either to the
King alone, or to his Line and House, or of some momentary desolation upon the
Land: Now God thunders out a General Deluge of Calamity to the City and Temple,
by the Prophet Micah: Sion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be
an heap, and the mountain of the house shall be as the high places of the
forest. Here the scattered clouds of Gods judgments, which had long soared
over Judah, are gathered as it were into one shower, ready to fall upon her (as
it were an Hawk stooping to her prey:) but that good King Hezekiah, and the
people by his example, laid fast hold upon his mercies, Hezekiah.
and averted his fierce wrath from them, by hearty and unfeigned prayer: They
feared the Lord, and prayed before him, and the Lord repented him of the evil,
that he had pronounced against them. Whiles I behold the Complete Reformation
which Hezekiah wrought, and the peoples will to accord with him therein; Me
thinks I hear the Lord wishing from heaven, as he did sometimes to their
fathers in the wilderness, Deuteronomy. 5. 29. Oh that there were such an heart in
them to fear me, and to keep all my Commandments always, that it might go well
with them, and with their children for ever. But Hezekiah did not render
according to the reward bestowed upon him: For his heart was lifted up, and
wrath came upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem, 2 Chronicles. 32. v. 25. Not that
it did seize upon them, but that it was ready to smite. For as it follows, ver.
26. Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself (after his heart was lift up) he
and the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the wrath of the Lord came not upon them
in the days of Hezekiah, but of Manasseh his son, who pulled Manasses.
it down upon his own and his peoples heads. For as it is registered, 2 Kin. 21.
3. He went back and built the high places, which Hezekiah his Father had
destroyed, and erected Altars for Baal, and made a grove as did Ahab King of
Israel, and worshipped all the Host of Heaven, and served them. And, as if he
meant to thrust the Lord out of his own House, He built Altars in it, of the
which the Lord said; In Jerusalem will I put my Name. And he built Altars for
all the Host of Heaven, in the two Courts of the House of the Lord, ver. 45.
And besides these and many other sins, wherewith he caused Judah to sin, and to
do evil in the sight of the Lord, after the abominations of the Heathen, which
the Lord had cast out before them, he filled Jerusalem from corner to corner
with innocent blood, whose cry did fill the Courts of Heaven. So both 2 King.
21. 16.
he and his people are plagued for their grievous sins; He is the First King of
Judah that is led into Captivity; yet upon his returning to the Lord his God he
is restored again. But his good example does not move his peoples hearts unto
like repentance, as his former bad example had caused them to sin. Wherefore
albeit the Lord repent him of the evil which had befallen his person; yet (Amon
his son and successor imitating his fathers sins, but not his repentance, 2 Chronicles. 33. 21.) does he not turn away from his fierce wrath Amon.
wherewith he was angry against Judah; albeit Josiah his virtuous Nephew (or
Grandchild) had turned to him with all his heart, and with all his soul,
according to all the Law of Moses. Manassch's sin therefore is said to be the
Cause why the Lord did cast off Judah, in such a sense as the Addition of the
last weight may be said to cast the scale, which was inclined that way before,
albeit restrained from motion by a counterpoize, until the last weight
over-powred the Restraint. God's wrath remained still upon the Land from
Salomon's and Rehoboam's reign: And the weight of his judgments was daily
increased more and more; howsoever the final execution of them was deferred, at
the instant prayers of religious Kings and righteous people: But now Manassch
has made up the full measure of all his forefathers sins; the weight of God's
Judgments has so far overgrown his Mercies, that there is no hope of
recovery left, unless Prince, Priest and People would fill Jerusalem as full
with their repentant tears, as Manassch had with blood; and devote the whole
course of their life, to doing good, as their forefathers had sold themselves
to work wickedness; which good Josiah for his part performs; and Good Josiah.
so deads the stroke of God's judgments whilst they are in motion. But his
peoples hearts are not so strongly set on their God. Although they join with
him in renewing the Covenant betwixt God and them, the chief strength of their
zeal and fervencie is spent in the first Act of Repentance, or in the Motion of
their Retire to God; Their Permanent Disposition and Propension is not firm:
Their very turning unto God, is rather forced then voluntary; so as they hold
off God's judgments only for a time. As if a man by haling and pulling with
might and main should keep some heavy and mighty body from falling, or some
great weight from swaying the full compass; whereas the solid weight of it
still remains the same, and will have full sway when his actual strength fails
him. Thus they quickly become weary of well-doing, and God's heaviest judgments
take their course. For however it be said, 2 Chronicles. 34. 33. That they did not
turn back from the Lord God of their fathers, all the days of Josiah: Yet was
this their cleaving to him, but compelled: It consisted more in the outward
solemnity or public fashion, then in inward sincerity and integrity: They did
not profess, or openly practice the solemn worship of strange gods; but had
still a longing after foreign fashions: as appears out of the Prophet Zephanie,
who wrote of those times; Chap 1. 8, 9. And it shall be in the day of the
Lord's sacrifice, that I will visit the Princes and the Kings Children, and all
such as are clothed with strange apparel. In the same day also will I visit all
those that dance upon the threshold so proudly, which fill their Masters houses
by cruelty and deceit. The corruption of both the Clergy and Magistracy had
continued grievous from Hezekiah's See this Auchor's Sermons on Jer. 26.
days, wherein it cried for vengeance. And this peoples repentance of these
sins in Josiah's days, was either none, or but feigned and hypocritical; as
the same Prophet testifies, Chap. 3. ver. 1, 2, 3, 4. Woe to her that is filthy
and polluted, to the robbing City. She heard not the voice; She received not
correction; She trusted not in the Lord; She drew not near to her God. Her
Princes within her are as roaring Lions; Her Judges are as Wolves in the
evening, which leave not the bones till the morrow. Her Prophets are light and
wicked persons; Her Priests have polluted the Sanctuary, they have wrested the
Law, And even for this peoples pronenesse to fulfill the measure of their
forefathers sins, was good Josiah removed from off the earth; lest Gods
judgments should come upon Jerusalem in his days. And no marvel, if the
fullness of Judah's sin be accomplished in Iosiah's days, though he were the
most righteous Prince of David's line. For, sin and iniquity may so abound in a
Land and people, that albeit Noah, Job and Daniel lived amongst them, they
should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness. And it is one of the
best notes Ezekiel. 14. 14. Ier. 15.
that I have somewhere found, That men should not lay all the blame on Princes,
where States miscarry; seeing it is said, that Hosea, in whose days Israel was
led into captivity, was either the best, or least evil, of all the Kings of
Israel, 2 King. 17. He did evil indeed in the sight of the Lord, but not as the
Kings of Israel that were before him, ver. 2. Which equity of Gods judgments in

of all his kindred, except the first, did with humility acknowledge, before
the foolish Politicians School-mistress Experience taught him the truth by the
evidence of the event. For when his wise and gravest Counselors did humbly
entreat him in the behalf of State and Country, to suffer at least some
provisions to be brought up secretly as his own, lest Millain might be
delivered up to some Forrainer: He requested them to set their hearts at rest;
The unhappy family had run their race; and it was impossible, but that the
bloody practices of his Ancestors should blot out the very name in him: A
Prince though otherwise in Charles the fifths esteem, the wisest of all the
Italian Princes in his time, yet herein endued with wisdom in an higher rank,
then the stateliest Potentates are wont to trouble themselves withal, in that
he could so well foresee, There was no counsel against the Lord; whose Decrees
concerning any Land or People, then usually take place, when as Posterity seeks
earnestly by secular Policy, to patch up the rents and breaches of a State
decayed and ruinate by the heavy burden of their Predecessors sins. Such was
the temper of Iosiah's Statesmen and Princes, though his heart was of another
metal, and had been fashioned in another mold. Wherefore the Book of the Law,
which had long laid buried, is now risen out of the dust, to proclaim
Ierusalems downfall, and Sions burial in her ashes. And this sentence of the Law
now found, is ratified by the Prophetess Huldahs mouth: Gods wrath shall
presently be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. But unto
good Josiah, who sought the Prophetesses, and not the Politicians advice, is
this sole comfort left. To the King of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the
Lord, so shall ye say unto him: Because thine heart did melt, and thou have
humbled thy self before the Lord, when thou heardest what I spoke against this
place, and against the Inhabitants of the same, to wit, that it should be

grave in peace, and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring
upon this place, 2 King. 22. 18.

8. But should not his righteousness have saved him? Or is this to be put in
his grave in peace, to be slain by his enemies? Yes, this his burial was in
peace, in that he was buried in the Sepulchers of his Fathers, and mourned for
by all his people, without the molestation of their enemies. This was a
blessing of peace, which none of his Sons or Successors enjoyed. For of them
all, not one but dies captive in the enemies Land, or in their own, without the
decency of Princely funerals. And who knows, Whether Iosiah's violent death
was deserved by going to battle without the Lords advice? Yea, who knows,
whether the Lord did not thus suddenly take him away, partly to prevent the
increase of that disease, wherewith no Prince of all the stock of Judah, but
had been more or less infected, and which now, as it seems, was growing on
him. All of them in their prosperity, began to trade in secular Policy, whose
practice was Jerusalems ruin, and Iudahs wreck; howsoever right dear in the
sight of the Lord was the death of this holy and religious King, who if he had
lived the longer, should have died the oftener. His Childrens and peoples sins
are now full ripe for the sword; and their vengeance hastens on so fast, that
either he must suddenly die, or else see their manifold miseries, far worse
then so many several deaths. For what pangs would it have caused in his tender
heart, which melted even whilst the noise of Ierusalems curse did but approach
his ears, if his eyes should have beheld the flames of Gods fierce wrath
devouring her gates, and his ears had been filled with her woeful outcries in
the days of mourning? For Jeremy or Baruch, two Prophets so poor that their
fore-warnings of these miseries could not merit any credit with this politic
generation, to live and see the event, was a blessing of God; and bare life
given them a bountiful prey; But what benefit could so great a Prince have
reaped by life; What comfort in length of days, to have seen the children of
his loins, born unto higher hopes then any Princes of the world besides, either
led captive into the enemies land, or made a prey unto the birds of heaven in
their own? Much better an enemies arrow stick once for all fast in his side,
then that the sword should continually pierce through his soul, whilst he should
see his dearest people cut down like grass; and Judah the Lords enclosure laid
open like a common field, to their bordering enemies spoil; and Jerusalem his
hearts joy, which the Lord had hedged and walled about, laid waste like a
forlorn vineyard, whose grapes were wild and naught. Yet such are the days
which immediately ensue his death: The Land is one while ransackt by the
Egyptian; another while made tributary to the Chaldean; another while forraged
by the Aramite, Ammonite and Moabite, until it was utterly laid waste. For
judgment is here begun already at the house of God; and in godly Iosiah's fall
might the ungodly Judah read her Fatal Destiny registered in Characters of
blood. And doubtless at this his
sudden unexpected end, the execution of Gods fierce and violent wrath did
begin; Of the successive degrees whereof, I shall, God willing, hereafter
speak. For the Manner of it, I only note thus much now in general; That not all
the wisdom of their most Politic Enemies, albeit the Lord had given them
liberty to have plotted this peoples overthrow at their pleasure, could have
invented so ready and sure a course for their swift destruction, as this
people themselves (in great Policy to their seeming) still make choice of. Not
one project which they can forecast, but proves an inevitablegin to entrap
themselves, and is as a fatal snare unto their own feet.

9. First good Josias, without Warrant from God, or his Prophets advice, thinks
it in Policy the safest course, to assault the Egyptian in the confines of his
Country, lest afterward he should be enforced to defend himself upon harder
terms, nearer to the heart of Judah, from his Enemy strengthened with the
spoil of her borders; so jealous he is of Nechoh's purpose, which meant him no
harm, that his word will not serve him for warrant; albeit his words, as the
Text says, were from the mouth of God. The issue of his policy, 2 Chr. 35 22
is, that he himself is slain; and Pharaoh Nechoh, by this his unseasonable
provocation, took a fair pretense of invading the Land after his death, and
condemns it in an hundred talents of Silver, and a talent of gold. And for the
effecting of this his purpose, the people themselves had given occasion; for
they (no doubt out of some politic purpose) had preferred the * younger
brother Iehoahaz to the Kingdom: who (poor Caitiff!) in stead of swaying David's
Scepter in the promised Land, is after three months space led Captive Iohanan,
or Iehoahaz.
in chains (like a Bond-slave) into Egypt, whence the Lord had redeemed the
meanest of this peoples forefathers. So contrary has Judah been in all her
courses, that all the glorious hopes of David's Line run backwards: So far is
the Calendar of Ierusalems good days run out of date; such are the revolutions
of times, that this Light which they had set up for David has taken darkness
for its habitation: The Sun of their Comfort is set, before it came to the
Meridian, and runs away out of their Hemisphere. And in his stead a Comet
arises out of Egyptian exhalations, which portends nothing but war and blood.
This is Jehoiakim whom Pharaoh Nechoh, which slew his father, has now
appointed to be King over this people, for his purpose; the Iehoiakim.
success of whose Reign in general the people might well prognosticate by his
life and manners: the Epitome of which, Josephus, lib. 10. cap. 5. has given
very pithily, in two words, He was neither religious toward God, nor just
toward men. And yet besides this, his natural disposition was particularly
incensed against this people, for preferring his younger Quaere. See 1 Chr. 3.
15 where Johanan is called the firstborn, yet Josephus, l. 10. c. 5. in
english, says, that Eliakim, who is also Jehoiakim, was elder brother to
Iehoahaz.
brother to the Crown, and so more ready to wreak his spite, by reason of his
dependence upon the Egyptian, out of whose Country he had the Prophet Uriah
brought, to satiate his thirst of blood: Jer. 26. 23. which bloody Fact of
his, and the like (with their like success) is the train I have pursued in
these present Meditations.

I will conclude them with that of Solomon, Prove. 28. 2. For the transgressions
of a Land, many are the Princes thereof. And of Judah never a good one after
Josiah; such they were as might serve to scourge this people, until they were
cast like Vagabonds and unprofitable Members out of that City and Land which
had bred them.

10. Thus you see, Gods largest Promises have their limits; greatest prosperity
has a period, and mightiest Kingdoms have their fall. You have likewise seen,
how for the uncircumcised hearts of this people, is he slain by uncircumcised
hands, who had so thoroughly cleansed Jerusalem and Judah from all the
abominations of the Heathen. The Heroical attempts of whose Princely resolution
and zeal in restoring the true worship of God unto this people, needs not mine,
it has the commendations of Gods Spirit, who has been curious in calculating
his particular good deeds throughout this Chapter, to have been matchless in
David's Race; and how then possible to be paralleled in any other Princes Line?
And what? If through the religious care and industry of some one or two
Princes, whom the Lord in mercy had raised up as Lights unto this Land, the
foggie mists of Superstition, Heresy and Idolatry be driven hence? This is an
Infallible testimony of Gods former love unto our forefathers, no sure
Document of our continuance in his favor; if yet this Land and People may be
taken in the very manner of those capital Crimes, which did condemn Judah (his
firstborn amongst the Nations) in the days of good Josiah, even whilst it
was acquitted from profession of Idolatry and Superstition. What shall it
avail us, that those foreign hungry Hell Hounds, which brought Commissions of
Charter Warrant for hunting out the good things of this Land, and made this
people a prey for maintenance of the many-headed beast, have been long time
prohibited to continue their wanted raunge, if the Princes which are left
within her, be as roaring Lions, and her Judges as wolves in the evening, which
leave not the bones until the morrow? What availes it that the secular Priests
and Jesuit are (would God they were) transported out of this Land, if her own
Prophets be light and wicked persons, and her Priests pollute the Sanctuary,
and wrest the Law? Or what shall it avail us, that the Light of the Gospel does
shine amongst us; if the just Lord be in the midst of us, and every morning
bring forth judgment unto light, and fail not, and yet the wicked will not
learn to be ashamed? Or what avails it, that we have cast off all blind
obedience to the Sea of Antichrist, if we will not suffer Gods providence to be
a Rule, and Christ's word a Light unto our paths, but walk on still in the ways
of the heathens; making secular observations our chief confidence, and worldly
policy, our greatest trust? Or what avails it to have purged our hearts from
all conceit of merit, if we pollute our hands with bribes? Or what availes it
to give God the glory in all good actions, and yet daily dishonor his name with
bad dealings? I will speak more plainly, What advantageth it us, to object unto
the Papists, that they seek to merit heaven by their works, and share with God
in the honor of good deeds, if they can truly reply upon us, That the free
Alms of Papists Founders, have been by Protestants set on sale unto their
brethren? Or that secular Appendices and Alliance of Spiritual men, devour a
great part of that liberal maintenance, which was allotted only for Prophets,
and Prophets children.

11. Beloved in our Lord, were we our selves without sin, without these
enormous sins, which I have mentioned, all of us might freely attempt to stone
that filthy Whore, and all her foul Adulterers, unto death. But such of us as
seek most to purge the Land of them, and seek not withal to cleanse our own
hearts of those sins which have procured Gods wrath against it, may justly
dread, lest we find no better success then good Josiah did; to provoke the
enemy to do more mischief then happily they meant? Mistake me not, I beseech
you, as though I misliked such as solicit severitie against that Nation; yet
cannot I hope, but some will be as jealous of me, as these Jews of Iosiah's and
Jehoiakim's days, were always of the Prophet Jeremy, whose footsteps I have
resolved to follow, through good and bad report. Give me leave to explain my
meaning, thus.

As from my heart I reverence their religious labors, who have of late so
effectually stirred up our Sovereignes heart to this purpose, and earnestly
request your hearty prayers unto Almighty God, that his Holy Spirit may
continually inflame his royal heart with those good motions which have been
kindled in it of late: so do I desire from the very center of my soul, both,
that men of place, Authority, Gravitie, Learning and Integrity of life, may
prosecute it; and that young Divines (whether young in years or manners, it
skills not) would oftentimes, even for Sions sake, hold their peace, or at
least be wary where and when they open their mouths in this argument. For he
that looks into the temper of this present people with a discreet, religious,
not with a turbulent, factious eye, may easily discern that many ill tempered
and extravagant invectives against Papists (made by men whose Persons wanting
Authority, as much as their speeches do Reason,) do nothing else but set an
edge upon our Adversaries sword; whilst the light behavior, and bad example of
the Inveighers life, infuseth courage to their hearts, and adds strength unto
their arms. In one word, Many of our words in this place, increase the wrath,
and many of our lives out of this place increase the number of that Faction.

12. Though all of us by Profession are Christ's Soldiers, yet every Soldier is
not fit for any service. Albeit I discourage no man; I only advise, that every
man that means to be a valiant Soldier in Christ, and would do his Master good
Service in so just a quarrel, would first begin to try his Valor in the
Reformation of his own life, in expelling all dissolute and inveterate lusts
all immoderate and unruly desires out of his own heart, So shall the words of
his mouth, and the Meditations of his heart, be always acceptable in the sight
of the Lord, his only strength and his Redeemer: In whose strength and valor
alone, we must assault and vanquish our malicious Adversaries. And unless
Reformation do, certainly judgment will begin at the Houses of God, at those
living
Temples of his, which have the platformes of true Religion in them, but are
not edified in good works. Let not the Eunuch say, I am a dry tree. Nor let the
meanest amongst us, either in Learning, Wit, or outward Estate, think that he
can do nothing in this case. For if we have but true faith, we all know, That
it is not the resolute Soldiers arm, nor these verest Magistrates sword, nor
the cunningest Politicians head, nor the Potent Custom of Law, that sets or
keeps Kings Crowns upon their Heads, but the lifting up of pure hearts and
holding up clean hands to him, that gives wisdom to the Wise, and strength to
the Strong; to him which has the Soldiers arm, the Magistrates sword, the
Politicians Wisdom, all Power, all Fullness at his disposal. Wherefore, Beloved
in our Lord, If either love to God, or love to Prince; if either love to that
Religion which we profess, or love unto those pleasant places which we
inhabit, or the good things belonging to them, which we possess; If love to
any or all of these, can move our hearts (as whose heart is there but is moved
to some of these?) Oh let them move them in time unto repentance, that we may
enjoy these blessings the longer. Let us draw near unto our God, and he will
draw near to us: Let us cleanse our minds, and lift up pure hands and hearts
unto the Lord, for only such can lay fast hold upon his mercy, lest our
continuance in our own daily transgressions, added to the heavy weight of our
predecessors sins, pull down Gods sudden judgments upon this Land, Prince
and People.

13. And as for such, O Lord, as set their faces against heaven and against
thee, to work wickedness in thy sight, and hold on still to fill up the full
measure of their forefathers sins, and cause the overflowing vengeance of thy
wrath; Lord, let them all perish suddenly from the earth; and let their
posterity vanish hence like smoke, ere for their provocations wherewith they
provoke thee daily, the breath of our nostrils, thine anointed Servant, be
taken in those nets which the uncircumcised daily spread for him.

And let us, Beloved, whom he loves so dearly, seek to fill this Land with the
good example of our lives, and incense of our hearty prayers: That under his
shadow, and the shadow of his Royal Offspring, we of this place, with this
Land and People, may be preserved alive from all strange or domestic tyranny.

Amen.
CHAP. XLV.
MATTHEW. 23. verse 37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets,
and stonest them which are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy
children together, even as a Hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye
would not?
1. THe Sum of my last Meditations upon the former verses, was, That
notwithstanding our Saviors Prediction or threatening of all those See the
foregoing Sermon on Matthew. 23. 34. See Signs of the Times page 24.
plagues shortly to befall Jerusalem, there was even at this time A Possibility
left for this people to have continued a flourishing Nation; A Possibility
left for their Repentance: That their Repentance and Prosperity was the End
whereat the Lord himself did aim in sending Prophets and Wisemen, and lastly
his only Son unto them.

The Former of the two Parts: [The Possibility of their Prosperity and
Repentance] was proved from the perpetual Tenor of Gods Covenant with this
people, first made with Moses, afterward renewed with David, and Solomon, and
ratified by Jeremie and Ezekiel. The Tenor of the Covenant, as you then heard,
was a Covenant not of Death only, but of Life and Death; of Life, if they
continued faithful in his Covenant: of Death, if they continued in disobedience.

The later Part of the same Assertion, viz. [That this Peoples Repentance and
Prosperity was the end intended by God] was proved from that Declaration of
his desire of their everlasting Prosperity, Deuteronomy. 5. 29. Oh that there were
such a heart in this people, to fear me, and keep my Commandments always, that
it might go well with them, and their posterity for ever. And the like place
Psalm 81. v. 13. Isai. 48. 18.

These places manifest Gods love, and desire of this peoples safety; But the
Abundance, the Strength, with the unrelenting Constancy and tenderness of his
love, is in no place more fully manifested then in these words of my Text. The
abundant fervencie we may note in the very first words, in that his mouth which
never spoke idle nor superfluous word, does here ingeminate the Appellation, O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem. This he spoke out of the abundance of his love. But Love
is oft-times fervent or abundant for the present, or whiles the Object of our
love remains amiable, yet not so constant and perpetual, if the quality of
what we loved be changed. But herein appears the strength and constancy of
Gods love, that it was thus fervently set upon Jerusalem, not only in her pure
and virgin days, or whiles she continued as chaste and loyal, as when she was
affianced unto the Lord by David, but upon Jerusalem often drunk with the cup
of Fornications; upon Her, long stained and polluted with the blood of his
dearest Saints, which she had even mingled with her Sacrifices: Upon Jerusalem
and her children, when (after he had cleansed her infected habitations with
fire, and carried her inhabitants beyond Babylon into the North-land, as into a
more fresh and pure air: Yet after their return thence, and replantation in
their own Land) returned with the dog to his vomit, and with the washed Sow, to
wallowing in the mire; God would have gathered even as the Hen does her
chickens under her wings, etc.

2. In which words, besides the tenderness of Gods Love toward these
Castawayes, is set out unto us the safety of his Protection, so they would have
been gathered. For as there is no creature more kind and tender then the Hen
unto her young ones, none that does more carefully shroud and shelter them from
the storm, none that does more closely hide them from the eye of the Destroyer;
so would God have hidden Jerusalem under the shadow of his wings, from all
those storms which afterward overwhelmed her, and from the Roman Eagle, to
whom this whole generation present became a prey. If so Jerusalem with her
children, after so many hundred years experience of his fatherly love and
tender care had not remained more foolish than the new hatched brood of
reasonless creatures: If so they had not been ignorant of his Call, that had
often redeemed them from their enemies. How often would I have gathered you,
and you would not?

Here were large matter for Rhetorical Digressions, or mellifluous Encomions of
Divine Love: Points wherein many Learned Divines have in later times been very
copious, yet still leaving the truth of that Love which they so magnify, very
questionable. It shall suffice me at this time,

First, To prove the undoubted truth, and unfeignednesse of Gods tender Two
Points propounded.
Love even toward such Cast-awayes as these proved, to whom he made this
protestation.

Secondly, To unfold (as far as is fitting for us to inquire) how it is
possible that they should not be gathered unto God, nor saved by Christ, whose
gathering and whose safety, he, to whom nothing can be impossible, had so
earnestly, so tenderly, and constantly longed after.

These are Points of such Use and Consequence, that if God shall enable me
soundly, though plainly, to unfold their truth; you will, I hope, dispense with
me for want of artificial Exornations, or words more choice then such as
naturally spring out of the matters handled, as willingly as the poor amongst
you pardon good housekeepers for wearing nothing but homespun cloth For as it
is hard for a man of ordinary means to bestow much on his own back, and feed
many bellies; so neither is it easy for me and my present opportunities, both
to feed your souls with the Truth, and to cloth my Discourse with choice
words, and flourishing phrases. And I am persuaded many Preachers might in this
Argument often prove more Theological, so they could be content to be less
Rhetorical. My purpose is not to dissent from any of the Reformed Churches, but
only in those particulars wherein they evidently dissent from themselves, and
from General Principles of Truth acknowledged by all that believe God or his
Word.

3. Were I to speak in some Audience, of this Point, it would be needful to dip
my pen in Nectar, or sweeten my voice with Ambrosia, to allay the harshnesse of
this Position, That God should so earnestly desire the conversion of such God
earnestly desires the conversion of such as perish: The former Point.
as perish. Howbeit the surest Grounds of that Charity which God requires
should be in every one of us toward all (our greatest enemies not excepted) is
Firm Belief of this his unspeakable Love toward all, even toward such as kill
his Prophets, and stone the Messengers of their peace. I exhort (says the
Apostle, 1 Timothy 2. 1.) that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions
and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for Kings and for all that are in
authority. Yet did most such in those days, oppress Christians, and draw them
before Judgment Seats, James 2. 6. even because they did pray unto the true
God for them, who did blaspheme that worthy Name, etc. This Duty,
notwithstanding (which was so odious unto those great and rich men, for whose
good it was performed) S. Paul tells us, was good and acceptable in the sight
of God our Savior, 1 Timothy 2. 3. Why acceptable in his sight? Because (v. 4.)
he would have all men (and therefore the sworn enemies of the Gospel) to be
saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, which they now oppugned. Or,
if the express Authority of the Apostle suffice not, his Reasons drawn from
the Principles of Nature, will persuade such as have not quenched the Light of
Nature, by setting not the corruptions only, but the very Essence of Nature at
odds with Grace; For (v. 5.) there is one God; had there been more, every one
might have been conceived as partial for his own Creatures. But in as much as
all of us have but one Father, his love to every one must needs be greater then
any earthly Parents love unto their children, in as much as we are more truly
His, then Children are their Parents. But here (as the Apostle foreseeth) might
be Replied, That albeit God be One and the only Creator of all: yet in as much
as all of us are the Seed of Rebels with whom he is displeased, our Mediator
might be more partial, and commend some to Gods love, neglecting others: To
prevent this Scruple, the Apostle adds, ver. 5. that as there is but One God,
so there is but One Mediator between God and Man, and he of the same Nature
with us, A Man. But men are partial: yet so is not the Man Christ Jesus; that
is, The Man anointed by the Holy Ghost to be the Savior of the world. As he
truly took our flesh upon him that he might be a faithful and affectionate High
Priest; so, that we might conceive of him as of an unpartial Solicitor or
Mediator betwixt God and us, he took not our Nature enstampt with any
Individual Properties, Characters or References to any one Tribe or Kindred.
Father according to the flesh he had none, but was framed by the sole immediate
hand of God, to the end that as the eye, because it has no set color, is apt
to receive the impression of every color: So Christ, because he had not those
carnal References which others have, but was without father, without brother,
without sister on earth, might be unpartial toward all, and account every one
that does the will of his Father which is in heaven, as sister, mother, and
brother. Thus says the Lord unto the Eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths, and choose
the things that please me, and take hold of my Covenant: Even unto them will I
give Isai. 56. 4
in mine house, and within my walls, a place and a Name better then of sons and
of daughters. I will give them an everlasting Name that shall not be cut off.
Briefly, he is A Brother to all mankind, more loving and more affectionate then
brothers of entire blood are one toward another.

4. The very Ground of the Apostles Reason thus barred, will of its own accord
reverberate that distinction which has been laid against his meaning by some
otherwise most worthy defendants of the truth. The Distinction is, that when
the Apostle says, God will have all men to be saved, he means, Genera
singulorum, not singula generum; Some few of all sorts, not all of every sort.
Some rich, some poor, some learned, some unlearned, some Jews, some About this
distinction, see Book 6. (or Attributes) chap. 15. and Book 9. chap. 5.
Gentiles, some Italians, some English, etc. The Illustrations which they bring
to justify this manner of speech, did the time permit, I could retort upon
themselves, and make them speak more plainly for my Opinion then for theirs. It
shall be sufficient by the way to note the Impertinencie of the Application,
supposing the Instances brought by them were justifiable by the Illustrations
which they bring; Or, to show how little it could weaken Our Assertion,
although it might intercept all the strength or aid this Place affords for the
Fortification of it. For what can it help them to turn these words (because
they make toward us) from their ordinary and usual meaning; or to restrain
Gods Love only unto such as are saved; when as the Current of it in other
passages of Scripture is evidently extended unto such as perish? In stead of
many words unto this purpose uttered by him that cannot lie, those few, Ezekiel.
33. 11. shall content me. As I live says the Lord God I have no pleasure in
the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, turn
ye, turn ye from your evil ways. For why will ye dye, O ye house of Israel?

If God will the safety of such as perish, yea even of most desperate stubborn
sinners: no question but he wills all should be saved and come unto the
knowledge of his truth. The Former distinction then will not stop this passage.
Howbeit some Learned amongst the Schoolmen, and other most religious Writers
of later times, have sought out another for intercepting all succor, this or
the like places might afford to the maintenance of that truth, which they
oppugn and we defend. That God does not will the death of a sinner Voluntate
signi, they grant; but that he wills it Voluntate beneplaciti, they take as
granted; That is in other terms, God does not will the death of him that dies
by his Revealed Will, but by his Secret Will. Not to urge them to a better
declaration then hitherto they have made, in what sense God (being but One) may
be said to have two Wills. That he wills many things which we know not; that he
has diverse Secret Purposes, we grant, and believe as most true, indefinitely
taken: But because these Wills or Purposes are Secret; man may not, man cannot
without presumption, determine the particular matters which he so wills or
purposes, otherwise they should not be secret, but revealed to us, whereas
things secret, as secret, belong only unto God, Deuteronomy. 29. 29. In that they
oppose Gods Secret Will to Gods Revealed Will, they do (as it were) put in a
Caveat, That we should not believe it in those particulars whereto they apply
it. For we may not believe any thing concerning the salvation or damnation of
mankind, or the means which lead to either, save what is revealed; But this
Secret Will is not Revealed; therefore not to be believed. Nor are we by the
Principles of Reformed Religion bound only not to believe it, but utterly to
disclaim it. For admitting (what was before granted) an Indefinite Belief, that
God wills many things which he keeps secret from us; yet we must absolutely
believe, That he never wills any thing secretly, which shall be Contrary or
Contradictory to that whereon his Will Revealed is set, or to that which by the
express warrant of his written Word we know he wills. Now every Christian must
infallibly and determinately believe, That God wills not the death of the
wicked, or of him that dies; seeing his written Word does plainly register his
peremptory determination of this Negative; therefore no man may believe the
Contradictory to this, to wit, That he wills the death of him that dies:
otherwise this Distinction admitted, untwines the very bonds of man's salvation.
For what ground of hope have the very Elect, besides Gods Will Revealed, or (at
the best) confirmed by oath? Now if we might admit it but as probable, That
God, Voluntate Beneplaciti, or, by his Secret Will, may purpose some things
contrary to what he promises by his Revealed Will, who is he that could have, I
say not, any Certainty, but any moral Probability of his Salvation? Seeing God
assures us of Salvation only by his Word Revealed, not by his secret will or
purpose, which, for ought we do, or possibly can, know, may utterly disanul
what his Revealed Will seems to ratify. Lastly, It is an infallible Rule or
Maxim in Divinity, That we may not attribute any thing to the most pure and
perfect Essence of the Deity, which includes any imperfection in it; much
less may we ascribe any impuritie or untruth, unto that Holy One, the Author
of all truth. But to swear one thing, and to reserve a secret meaning, contrary
to the plain and literal meaning professed, is the very Idaea of untruth, the
Essence of impious Perjury, which we so much condemn in some of our
Adversaries, who, if this Distinction might generally pass for current amongst
us, might retort; that we are as maliciously partial against the Jesuits as
the Jews were against Christ Jesus: that we are ready to blaspheme God rather
then spare to revile them: seeing we attribute that unto his Divine Majesty,
which we condemn in them as most impious and contrary to his Sacred Will, who
will not dispense with Equivocation or mental Reservation, be the cause wherein
they are used, never so good; because to swear one thing openly, and secretly
to reserve a contradictorie meaning, is contrary to the very Nature and Essence
of the First Truth; the most transcendent sin that can be imagined. Wherefore,
as this Distinction was lately hatched, so it were to be wished that it might
quickly be extinguished, and lie buried with their bones that have revived it.
Let God be true in all his words, in all his sayings, but especially in all his
oaths, and let the Jesuit be reputed as he is, a double dissembling perjured
Liar.

5 The former Place of Ezekiel, as it is no way impeached by this distinction
last mentioned; so does it plainly refute another Gloss put upon my Text by
some worthy and Famous Writers. How often would I have gathered An odd Gloss
refuted.
you, and you would not, etc. These words (say they) were uttered by our
Savior manifesting his desire As Man. But unless they be more then men which
frame this Gloss, Christ as man was greater then they, and spoke nothing but
what he had in express Commission from his Father. We may then I trust without
offense take his words as here they sound, for a better interpretation of his
Fathers Will, then any man can give of his meaning in this passage uttered by
himself in words as plain as they can devise.

These words indeed were spoken by the mouth of him that was man, yet by a
mouth as truly manifesting the desire and good will of God for the salvation of
his people, as if they had been immediately uttered by the Godhead without the
Organ or Instrument of humane voice. But why should we think they were
conceived by Christ, as he was man, not rather by him as the Mediator between
God and man, as the Second Person in the Trinity manifested in our Flesh? He
says not, Behold my Father has sent, but, in his own Person, I have sent unto
you Prophets and Wise men, etc. Nor is it said How often would my Father? but,
How often would I have gathered you? This Gathering we cannot refer only to
the three years of his Ministry, but to the whole time of Jerusalem her
running astray from the Prophets Calls: from the first time that David first
took possession of it, till the last destruction of it. For all this time, He
that was now sent by his Father in the similitude of man did send Prophets,
Wise men and Apostles to reclaim them, if they would have hearkened to him, or
his Messengers Admonitions. S. Luke puts this out of Controversy, for,
repeating part of this story, he says expressly, Therefore Luke 11. 39
also said the Wisdom of God, I will send them Prophets, etc. And Christ is
styled, The Wisdom of God, not as man, but as God; and Consequently He spoke
these words, not as man only, but as God. The same compassion and burning Love,
the same thirst and longing after Jerusalems safety which we see here
manifested by a manner comprehensible to flesh and blood, in these words of our
Savior in my Text (or the like uttered by him, Luke 19 with tears and sobs) we
must believe to be as truly, as really and unfeignedly in the Divine Nature,
though by a manner incomprehensible to flesh and blood. How any such flagrant
desire of their welfare which finally perish, should be in God, we cannot
conceive, because our minds are more dazeled with that inaccessible Light which
he inhabits, then the eyes of Batts and Owls are by gazing on the Sun. To
qualify this Incomprehensible Glory of the Deity, the Wisdom of God was made
Flesh, that we might safely behold the true module or proportion of Divine
Goodness in our Nature: as the eye which cannot look upon the Sun in his
strength, or as it shines in the Firmament, may without offense behold it in
the water, being an Element homogeneal to its own substance. Thus should all
Christ's Prayers, desires, or pathetical wishes of man's safety be to us as so
many visible pledges, or sensible Evidences of Gods Invisible and
Incomprehensible Love; and so he concludes his last Invitation of the Jews. I
have not spoken of my self, but the Father which sent me, he gave me
Commandment what I should say, and what I should speak; And I know that his
Commandment is everlasting life; whatsoever I spoke therefore even as the
Father said unto me, so I spoke. Joh. 12. ver. 49, 50.

And what says our Savior more in his own, then the Prophet had done in the
Name and Person of his God? Isai. 49. v. 14. Sion complained, the Lord has for
saken me, and my Lord has forgotten me. But he answered. Can a woman forget
her sucking Child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?
yea! they may forget; yet will I not forget thee. Behold I have graven thee
upon the palms of my hands. etc. These and the like Places of the Prophets,
compared with our Saviors speech here in my Text, give us plainly to
understand, That whatsoever Love any mother can bear to the fruit of her womb,
(unto whom her bowels of compassion are more tender then the fathers can be) or
whatsoever affection any dumb Creature can afford unto their tender brood, the
like, but greater does God bear unto his children. Unto the Elect most will
grant: But is his Love so tender toward such as perish? Yes; the Lord carried
the whole Host of Israel (even the stubborn and most disobedient) as the
Eagle does her young ones upon her wings, Exodus 19. 4.

Earthly Parents will not vouchsafe to wait perpetually upon their children.
The Hen continues not her Call from morning to night, nor can she endure to
hold out her wings all day for a shelter to her young ones: as they grow great
and refuse to come, she gives over to invite them. But (says the Lord by his
Prophet,) I have spread out my hand all the day unto a rebellious people, which
walks in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts. A people that
provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and
burns incense upon Altars of bricks, which remain among the graves, and lodge
in the monuments; which eat Swines flesh, and broth of abominable things is in
their vessels; which say (adding hypocrisy unto filthiness and Idolatry)
stand by thy self, come not near unto me, for I am holier then thou. Isai. 65.
ver. 2, 3, 4. Such they were, and so conceited of our Savior, with whom he had
in his life time often to deal, and for whose safety he prayed with tears
before his Passion.

These and many like passages of Scripture are pathetically set forth by the
Spirit, to assure us, That there is no desire like unto the Almighties desire
of sinful man's Repentance, no Longing to his Longing after our Salvation. If
Gods Love, to Judah comen to the height of rebellion, had been less then man's
or other Creatures Love to what they affect most dearly: If the Means he used
to reclaim her had been fewer, or less probable, then any others had attempted
for obtaining their most wished End, his Demand (to which the Prophet thought
no possible Answer could be given) might easily have been put off by these
incredulous Jews, unto whom he had not referred the judgment in their own
Cause; if they could have instanced in man or other Creature, more willing to
do what possibly they could do, either for themselves or others, then he was to
do whatsoever was possible to be done for them: And now O Inhabitants of
Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard; what
could more have been done to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Wherefore
when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
Isa. 5. v. 3, 4.

6. But the greater we make the Truth and Extent of Gods Love, the more The 2d
Point, How is it possible they should not be gathered, if God so earnestly will
etc. as fol. 3 769.
we increase the difficulty of the Second Point proposed. For amongst women
many there be that would; amongst dumb Creatures, scarce any that would not,
redeem their sucklings from death by dying themselves. Yet what is it that
they can do, which they would not do to save their own lives? And did not God
so love the world that he gave his only begotten Son for it? Yes, for the world
of the Elect; I see not why any should be excluded from the number. But to let
that pass; Gods desire of their repentance which perish, is undoubtedly such
as has been said: Yet should we say that he has done all that could be done
for them, How chances it that all are not saved? Was the Vineyard more barren
then Sarah? the fruit of whose womb he made like the Stars of the sky, or as
the sands by the Sea shore innumerable. Was it a matter more hard to make the
impenitent Jew bring forth fruits worthy of Repentance, then to make a Virgin
conceive and bear a son? If it were not, how chances it, the Word of the Lord
(and that but a short one) should bring the One to joyful Issue, whilst the
other (the repentance of the Jews, and other ungodly men) after so many
exhortations and threatenings, after so many promises of comfort, and so many
denunciations of woes, as the Prophets, the Apostles and their Successors have
used, is not to this day, nor ever will be accomplished?

If repentance of men born and brought up in sin be a work altogether
impossible, all of us should utterly perish, none repent; if possible to any,
shall it not be possible to the Almighty, who alone can do all things? if
possible to him, why is not repentance wrought in all, whose salvation he more
earnestly desires then the most tender hearted mother does the life and welfare
of her darling infant? Hence with Seeming Probability, some may Conclude,
either that Gods Love unto such as perish is not so great as some mothers bear
unto their children, or else his Power in respect of them is not infinite. And
against our Doctrine, perhaps, it will be Objected, That by thus magnifying
Gods Love toward All, we minish his Power toward Some: From which to derogate
ought, is, in some men's judgments, the worst kind of Blasphemy; a Point as
dangerous in Divinity, to speak but doubtfully or suspiciously of it, as in
matter of State to determine or limit the Prerogative Royal. Howbeit, if no
other choice were left, but a necessity were laid upon us of leaving either
the infinite Power or infinite Goodness of our God questionable or
unexpressed; the offense were less, to speak not so much of his Power as most
do, than to speak ought prejudicial to that conceit which even the Heathens by
light of Nature had of his Goodness. This Attribute is the Chief Object of our
Love, and for which he himself desires to be loved most; and in this respect to
derogate ought from it, must needs be most offensive. But his curse be upon him
that will not unfeignedly acknowledge the absolute infiniteness as well of his
Power as of his Goodness. Whosoever he be that loves his Goodness, will
unfeignedly acknowledge, that he is to be feared and reverenced as the
Almighty Creator, Preserver, and Judge of men; and unless he were in Power
infinite, he could not be infinitely Good. Howbeit he that restrains his Love
and tender Mercy, only unto such as are saved, does make his Goodness less (at
least extensively) then his Power. For there is no Creature unto which his
Power reaches not, but so does not his loving kindness extend to all, unless
he desire the good and safety of such as perish.

7. For winding our selves out of the Former Snare, we are to consider a main
difference between the Love of man or other Creatures, and the Love of God to
mankind. Dumb creatures always affect what they most desire, if it be within
the precincts of their power, because they have neither Reason nor other
Internal Law of right or wrong to control or counter-sway their brutish
appetites. Man although endued with Reason and natural Notions of right and
wrong, is notwithstanding oft-times drawn by the strength or inordination of
his tender affection, to use such Means as are contrary to the Rules of
Reason, Equity and Religion, for procuring their safety or impunitie on whom
he dotes. Howbeit, among men we may find some, which cannot be wrought by any
promise or persuasion, to use those unlawful courses for the impunity of their
children or dearest Friends which the world commonly most approves. Not that
their Love toward their children, friends or acquaintance is less, but
because their Love to public Justice, to Truth and Equity, and respect to
their own Integrity, is Greater then other men's are.

A fit Instance we have in Zaleucus, King of Locris, who having made a severe
Law, That whosoever committed such an offense (suppose Adultery) should lose
his eyes: It shortly after came to pass, that the Prince, his Son and Heir
apparent to the Crown, trespassed against this Sanction. Could not the good
King have granted A Pardon to his Son? He had Power, no doubt, in his hands to
have dispensed with this particular, without any danger to his Person; and most
Princes would have done as much as they could, for the safety of their
Successor; nor could Privileges or Indulgences upon such special
circumstances, be held as breaches or violations of Public Laws, because the
Prerogative of the person offending cannot be drawn into Example. But Zaleucus
could not be brought to dispense with his Law, because he loved Justice no
less dearly then his Son, whom he loved as dearly as himself; and to manifest
the Equality of his love to all three, he caused one of his own eyes, and
another of his Sons to be put out, that so the Law might have its due, though
not wholly from his son that had offended, but in part from himself as it were
by way of punishment for his partiality toward his son. It were Possible, no
doubt, for a King to reclaim many Inferiors from theft, from robbery or other
ungratious Courses, so he would vouchsafe to abate his own expenses to maintain
theirs, or afford them the solaces of the Court, make them his Peers, or
otherwise allow them means for compassing their wonted pleasures. But thus far
to condescend to unthriftie subjects, were ill beseeming that Gravitie and
Majesty which should be in Princes. If one should give notice to a Prince, how
easy and possible it were for him by these means to save a number from the
Gallows: his reply would be, Princeps id potest quod salva majestata potest;
That only is possible to a Prince which can stand with the safety of his
Majesty. But thus to feed the unsatiable appetites of greedy unthrifts,
though such as he otherwise loves most dearly, and whose welfare he wishes as
heartily as they do that thus speak for them, is neither Princely nor
Majestical. For a King in this Case to do as much as by some means possible he
is able to do, were an act of weakness and impotencie, not an act of
Sovereign power, a great blot to his Wisdom, Honor or Dignity, no true
Argument of Royal Love or Princely Clemency.

In like Case we are to consider, That God albeit in Power infinite, yet his
infinite Power is matched with Goodness as truly infinite; his infinite Love,
is as it were counterpoised with infinite Majesty: And though his infinite
mercy be as Sovereign to his other Attributes, yet is it in a sort restrained
by the Tribunicial Power of his Justice. This Equality of infiniteness
betwixt his Attributes being considered; the former Difficulty is easily
resolved. If it be demanded, whether God could not make a thousand worlds as
good or better then this, it were infidelity to deny it. Why? Because this is
an effect of mere Power, and might be done without any Contradiction to his
Goodness, to his Majesty, to his Mercy, or Justice, all which it might serve
to set forth. And this is a Rule of Faith; [That all Effects of mere Power
though greater then we can conceive as possible, may be done of him with
greater ease then we can breath.] His only Word would suffice to make ten
thousand worlds. But if it be questioned, Whether God could not have done more
then he has done for his Vineyard? whether he cannot save such as daily
perish? The Case is altered, and breeds a Fallacy, Ad plures Interrogationes.
For man's Salvation is not a work of mere Power, it necessarily requires, An
Harmony of Goodness, of Majesty, of Mercy and Justice, whereunto the infinite
Power is in a manner subservient. Nor are we to consider his Infinite Power
alone, but as matched with Infinite Majesty; nor his Infinite Mercy and
Goodness alone, but as matched with infinite Justice; and in this case it is
as true of God as man. Deus illud potest quod salva majestate potest; quod
salva bonitate and justitia potest: God can do that which is not prejudicial to
his Majesty, to his Goodness and Justice; And he had done (if we may believe
his Oath) as much for his Vineyard as the Concurrence of his Infinite Power and
Wisdom could effect without disparagement to the Infinity of his Majesty, or
that Internal Law, or Rule of Infinite Goodness whereby he created man after
his own Image and Similitude.

8. God, as he has his Being, so has he his Goodness of himself: And his
Goodness is his Being: As impossible therefore that he should not be Good, as
not Be. Man as he had his life and being, so had he his goodness wholly from
his Creator. And as Actual Existence is no part, no necessary Consequent of
his Essence; so neither is his Goodness necessary or essential to his
Existence. As his existence, so his goodness is mutable; the one necessarily
including a possibility of declination, or decay, the other an inclination to
relapse or falling into evil. As he was made after the Similitude of God, he
was actually and inherently Good; yet was not his Goodness essential, necessary
or immutable. Nor did he resemble his Creator in these essential Attributes but
rather in the Exercise of them ad extra.

Now that Exercise was not necessary but free in the Creator; for God might
have continued for ever most Holy, Righteous and Good in himself, albeit he had
neither created man nor other Creature. Wherefore he made them good as he was
freely Good, and such is the Goodness communicated to them in their Creation,
not necessary, but free; and if free, as well including a possibility of
falling into evil as an actual state of goodness.

If then you ask, Could not God by his Almighty Power have prevented Adams
eating of the forbidden Fruit? None (I think) will be so incredulous as to
doubt, whether he that commanded the Sun to stand still in his sphere and did
dead Ieroboams arm when he stretched it out against the Prophet, could not as
easily have stayed Adams hand from taking, or turned his eyes from looking
upon, or his heart from lusting after the forbidden fruit. All these were Acts
of Mere Power. But had he by his Omnipotent Power laid this Necessity upon
Adams will or understanding; or had he kept him from transgression by
restraint, he had made him incapable of that happiness whereto by his infinite
Goodness he had ordained him. For, by this supposition, he had not been Good
in himself: Nor could he be capable of true felicity, but he must be capable
likewise of punishment and misery. The Ground of his Interest in the One, was
his actual and inherent Goodness, communicated in his Creation: Nor was he
liable to the other, but by the mutabilitie of his Goodness, or possibility of
falling into evil. In like manner, he that gave that known Power and Virtue to
the Lodestone, could as easily draw the most stony hearted son of Adam unto
Christ, as it does steel and iron. But if he should draw them by such a
necessary and natural motion, he should defeat them of all their hope or
interest in that excessive Glory which he has prepared for those that love
him. If again it be demanded, Why God does not save the impenitent and stubborn
sinner? It is all one as if we should ask, Why he did not crown brute Beasts
with honor and immortality? That thus he could do by his Infinite Power, I
will not deny; and if thus he would do, no Creature justly might control him,
none possibly could resist or hinder him. Yet I may (without presumption)
affirm, That, Thus to do, cannot stand with the internal Rule of his Justice,
Goodness and Majesty. Nor can it stand better with the same Rule to save all
men, if we take them as they are, not, as they might be; Albeit, he have endued
all with reason to distinguish between good and evil. For many of them speak
evil of those things they know not, but what they know naturally as brute
beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. Jude v. 10. It stands less
with Gods infinite Goodness or Power, if we consider them as linkt with
infinite Justice or Majesty, to bring such unto true happiness, then to
advance brute beasts to Immortality. It is a people, (says the Prophet, Isai.
27. 11.) of no understanding, therefore he that made them will not have mercy
on them, and he that formed them will show them no favor. God out of the
abundance of his Goodness, Mercy and Long-suffering, tolerates such as the
Apostle and Prophet speak of, and out of his infinite Love seeks by the
Preaching of his Word, and other means not prejudicial to his Justice and
Majesty, to gather them as he would have done Jerusalem here in my Text. But
(finally) there is a certain Measure of Iniquity which when it is full, or, an
height of stubborness and profaneness, whereunto if once they come, the stroke
of his infinite Justice falls heavy upon them for wilful contempt of his
infinite Mercy. That is, as he himself somewhere Quare whether he mean not
Jer. 44. 22.
says, He cannot any longer endure them.

9. The suspicions whereto these Resolutions will seem liable, be especially
three. Three Objections against this Doctrine.


First, That they derogate from Gods extraordinary favor toward his Elect.

Our Answer is brief; The Offense if any there be is taken, not given; Answer
to the first.
seeing we only affirm, That none so perish, but that they had a possibility
to be saved. We deny not, That many are so saved, as it were not possible for
them finally to perish. Yet so saved they are, not by Gods Infinite Power,
laying a necessity upon their wills, but by his Infinite Wisdom preparing
their hearts to be fit Objects of his Infinite Mercy, and forecasting their
final Salvation as necessary by (...) not altogether necessarily unto the
particular means whereby it is wrought; that is, in fewer Terms: Unto their
Salvation an infinite Power, or infinite Mercy, matched with infinite Justice,
without an infinite wisdom, would not suffice. To call some (how many none may
determine) extraordinarily, as he did S. Paul, may well stand with the Eternal
Rule of his Goodness: Because he uses their mir aculous or unusual
Conversion, as a means to win others by his usual or ordinary Calling, Special
Privileges, upon peculiar and extraordinary Occasions, do not prejudice
ordinary Laws: albeit to draw such Privileges into common Practice would
overthrow the course of Justice. It is not contradictory then to the Rule of
Gods Justice, to make some feel his mercy and kindness before they seek it,
that others may not dispere of finding it; he having assured all by an eternal
Promise, That seeking they shall find; and that they which hunger and thirst
after righteousness shall be satisfied.

10. The second Suspicion or Imputation, is, That this Doctrine may too much
favor Free Will. Second Objection and Answer.


In Brief we answer, There have been Two Extremities in Opinions continually
followed by the two main Factions of the Christian world; The One, That God
has so decreed all things, as that it is impossible ought should have been
that has not been, or not to have been, which has been. This was the Opinion
of the Ancient Stoics, which attributed all Events to Fate, and it is no way
mitigated, but rather improved, by referring this absolute Necessity, not to
second Causes or Nature, but to the Omnipotent Power of the God of Nature. This
was refuted in our last Meditations, because it makes God the sole Author of
every sin.

The Second Extremity is, That in man before his Conversion by Grace, there is
a freedom or abtliment to do that which is pleasant and acceptable unto God,
or an activity to work his own Conversion. This was the Error of the Pelagians,
and is in part communicated to the modern Papists, who hold a mean indeed, but
a false one, betwixt the Pelagians and the Stoics.

The true Mean from which these Extremities swerve, may be comprised in these
two Propositions: The One Negative: In Man after Adams Fall there is no Freedom
of will, or ability to do any thing not deserving Gods wrath or Just
indignation. The Other Affirmative: There is in man after his Fall, a
possibility left of doing or not doing some things, which being done or not
done, he becomes passively capable of Gods mercies; doing or not doing the
contrary, he is excluded from mercy, and remains a vessel of wrath, for his
Justice to work upon. For whether a man will call this Contingencie in humane
actions, not, a possibility of doing or not doing, but rather a possibility of
acknowledging our infirmities or absolute impotencie of doing any thing
belonging or tending to our salvation: I will not contend with him. Only of
this I rest persuaded, That all the Exhortations of Prophets and Apostles to
work humility and true repentance in their Auditors, suppose a possibility of
Humiliation and Repentance; a Possibility likewise of acknowledging and
considering our own impotencie and misery; a Possibility likewise of conceiving
some desire not merely brutish of our redemption or deliverance. Our Savior
(ye know) required not only a desire of health, of sight, of speech in all
those whom he healed, restored to sight, or made to speak, but withal a kind of
natural belief or conceit that he was able to effect what they desired. Hence
says the Evangelist, Mark 6. 5. Matthew. 13. 58. He could not do many miracles
among them because of their unbelief. Yet Christ alone wrought the Miracles,
the parties cured were mere Patients, no way Agents. And such as solicited
their cause in Case of absence at the best were but Bystanders. Now no man I
think will deny that Christ by the Power of his Godhead could have given sight,
(...) or health to the most obstinate and perverse, yet by the Rule of his
divine Goodness, he could not cast his Pearls before swine. Most true it is,
that we are altogether dead to life spiritual, unable to speak or think, much
less to desire it as we should: yet Belief and Reason moral and natural
survive, and may with Martha and Mary beseech Christ to raise their dead
brother, who cannot speak for himself.

11. The third Objection will rather be preferred in Table-talk, then seriously
The third Objection.
urged in solemn Dispute. If God so earnestly desire or will the life and
safety of such as perish, his will should not always be done. Why? Dare any
man living say or think that he always does whatsoever God would have him do:
So doubtless he should never sin or offend his God. For never Answer.
was there woman so wilful, or man so mad, as to be offended with ought that
wen^ not against their present will; nor was there ever, or possible can be any
breach of any Law, unless the will of the Lawgiver be broken, thwarted or
contradicted; for he that leaves the Letter, and follows the true meaning of
the Lawgivers will, does not transgress the Law, but observes it. And unless
Gods will had been set upon the salvation of such as perish, they had not
offended, but rather pleased him by running headlong in the ways of death.

Yet in a good sense it is always most true, That Gods will is always
fulfilled. We are therefore to consider, That God may will some things
Absolutely, others Disjunctively: or that some things should fall out
necessarily, others not at all, or contingently. The particulars which God
absolutely wills or which he wills should fall out necessarily, must of
necessity come to pass; otherwise his Will could in no case be truly said to
be fulfilled. As unless the Leper, to whom it was said by our Savior, [I will
be thou clean] had been cleansed; Gods Will manifested in these words had been
utterly broken. But if every particular which he wills disjunctively, or which
he wills should be contingent, did of necessity come to pass, his whole Will
should utterly be defeated. For his Will (as we suppose) in this Case is, that
neither this, nor that particular should be necessary, but that either they
should not be, or be contingent. And if any particular, comprised within the
latitude of this Contingencie with its consequent, come to pass, his Will is
truly and perfectly fulfilled. As for Example: God tells the Israelites that by
observing of his Commandments they should live, and die by transgressing them.
Whether therefore they live by the one means, or dye by the other, his Will is
necessarily fulfilled, because it was not that they should necessarily observe
his Commandments or transgress them: But to their transgressions, though
Contingent death was the necessary Doom: So was life the absolute necessary
Reward of their Contingent observing them.

12. But the Lord has sworn, That he delights not in the death of him that
dies, but in his repentance: If then he never repent, Gods delight or good
pleasure Another Objection with the Answer thereto
is not always fulfilled, because he delights in the one of these, not in the
other. How then shall it be true which is written, God does whatsoever pleases
him in heaven and earth, if he make not sinners repent in whose repentance he
is better pleased then in their death?

But unto this Difficulty the former Answer may be rightly fitted. Gods See
this Authors 6 Book (or Attributes) Chap. 16. and Chap. 20.
Delight or good Pleasure may be done Two Ways; either by us, or upon us. In
the former place it is set upon our repentance or obsequiousness, to his Will;
For this is that service whereto by his Goodness he ordained us: But if we
cross his Good Will or pleasure as it respects this Point; that is, if we will
not suffer our selves to be saved, the same delight or pleasure is set upon our
punishment, and fulfilled upon us: and if we would but enter into our own
hearts, we might see the Image of Gods Will hitherto manifested by his Word
distinctly written in them; and that the Rule which his infinite Justice
observes See Book the 6.
in punishing the wicked and reprobate, is to measure out their plagues and
punishments, according to the measure of their neglecting his Will, or
contradicting his delight in their salvation: that as the riches of his
Goodness leading them to repentance has been more plentiful; so they by their
impenitencie still treasure up greater store of wrath against the day of wrath.
To this purpose does the Lord threaten the obstinate people before mentioned,
Isai. 65. 5. These are as a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.
Behold it is written before me; I will not keep silence, but will recompense,
even recompense into their bosom, your iniquities, and the iniquities of your
Fathers together (says the Lord) which have burnt Incense upon the mountains,
and blasphemed me upon the Hills; therefore will I measure their former work into
their bosom. Both these parts of Gods delight are fully expressed by Solomon,
Prove. 1. 21. Wisdom cries without, she has uttered her voice in the streets;
she cries in the chief place of the Concourse, in the opening of the gates; in
the City she utters her words, saying, How long ye simple ones, will ye love
simplicity, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate
knowledge? Turn you at my reproof Behold I will pour out my spirit upon you, I
will make known my words unto you. These passages infallibly argue an unfeigned
delight in their repentance, and such a desire of their salvation, as the
Wisdom of God has expressed in my Text. But what follows? Because I have
called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded: But
ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof, I also will
laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear comes. Thus his delight
remains the same, but is set upon another Object. To the same purpose, Isai.
65. 12. Therefore I will number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to
the slaughter, because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke ye did
not hear, but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted
not. So then whether by the destruction of the wicked, or the salvation of his
Chosen, Gods name is still alike glorified: His Justice exacts what should have
been, but was not paid unto his Mercy. He can be no loser by man's
unthankfulness or ungratiousnesse; The Case is all one, as if we should take
that from a thief with the left hand, which he had picked out of our right
hand. Thus much of the two Points proposed.

13. I do desire no more then that the Tree may be judged by the Fruit. And The
whole Use of this Doctrine.
questionless the Use of these Resolutions, whether for convincing our selves
of sin, or quelling despere, or for encouraging the careless and impenitent
unto repentance, by giving them right hold of the means of life, is much
greater then can be conceived without admittance of their truth.

First, Seeing the end of our preaching, is not so much to instruct the Elect,
as to call sinners to repentance; not so much to confirm their faith that are
already certain of salvation, as to give Hope to the Unregenerate that they may
be saved: How shall we accomplish either intendment? By magnifying Gods Love
toward the Elect? who these are, God and themselves know. How shall he which
lives yet in sin persuade himself there is any probability he may be saved?
Because God has infallibly decreed to save some few? Rather seeing by the
contrary Doctrine, the most part of mankind must necessarily perish, he has
more reason to fear least he be one of those many, then to hope that he is one
of those few. The bare possibility of his salvation cannot be inferred but from
indefinite Premises; from which no certain Conclusion can possibly follow. And
without certain apprehension or conceit of Possibility, there can be no sure
Ground of Hope. But if we admit the former Extent of Gods unspeakable love to
all, and his desire of their eternal safety which desperately perish, every
man may, nay must undoubtedly thus Conclude; Ergo, Gods Love extends to me; It
is his good will and pleasure to have me saved amongst the rest, as well as any
other; and whatsoever he unfeignedly wills, his power is able effectually to
bring to pass. The danger of sin and terror of that dreadful day being first
made known unto our Auditors; the pressing of these Points as effectually as
they might be (were this Doctrine held for current) would kindle the Love of
God in our hearts, and inflame them with desires answerable to Gods ardent Will
of our Salvation, and these once kindled, would breed sure hope, and in a
manner enforce us to embrace the infallible means thereto ordained.

14. Without admission of the Former Doctrine, it is impossible for any man
rightly to measure the heinousness of his own or others sins. Such as gather
the infinity of sins demerit from the infinite Majesty against which it is
committed, give us the surface of sin, infinite in length and breadth, but not
in soliditie. See Fol. 3341.
The will or pleasure of a Prince in matters meanly affected by him, or in
respect of which he is little more then indifferent, may be neglected without
greater offense then meaner persons may justly take for foul indignities or
grievous wrongs. But if a Princes Sovereign Command, in a matter which he
desired as much as his own life, should be contemned, a Loyal Subject conscious
of such contempt, though happening through Riot or persuasions of ill company,
would in his sober thoughts be ready to take revenge upon himself, specially if
he knew his Sovereigns Love or liking of him to be more then ordinary. Consider
then, that as the Majesty and Goodness of our God, so his Love and Mercy
toward us, is truly infinite. That he desires our repentance as earnestly as
we can desire meat or drink in the extremity of thirst or hunger; as we can do
life it self while we are beset with death; That this our God manifested in our
flesh did not desire his own life so much as our redemption. We must therefore
measure the heinousness of our sins by the abundance of Gods Love, by the
height and depth of our Saviors Humiliation: Thus they will appear infinite
not only because committed against an infinite Majesty, but because with this
dimension they further include a wilful neglect of infinite mercy, and
Incomprehensible desires of our Salvation. We are by nature the seed of Rebels,
which had lift their hands against the infinite Goodness of their Creator, in
taking the forbidden fruit, whereby they sought to be like him in Majesty.
Conscious of this transgression, the first Actors immediately hid themselves
from his presence: And, as if this their terror had imprinted a perpetual
Antipathy in their posterity, the least glympse of his glory for many
generations after, made them cry out, Alas we shall dye! because we have seen
the Lord. We still continue like the offspring of tame Creatures grown wild,
always eschewing his presence that seeks to recover us, as the Bird does the
Fowler, or the beasts of the Forest the sight of fire. And yet unless he
shelter us under the shadow of his wings, we are as a prey exposed to the
destroyer, already condemned for Fuel to the flames of hell, or as nutriment
to the brood of serpents. To redeem us from this everlasting thraldom, our God
came down into the world disguised in the similitude of our flesh, made as a
stale to allure us with wiles into his net, that he might draw us with the
cords of Love. The depth of Christ's humiliation, was as great as the difference
between God and the meanest man, therefore truly infinite. He that was equal
with God, was conversant with us here on earth in the form and condition of a
servant. But of servants by birth, or civil constitution many live in health
and ease with sufficient supplies of all See Book 8. cha. 6, 7. etc.
things necessary for this life: So did not the Son of God, his humanity was
charged with all the miseries whereof mortality is capable, subject to hunger
and thirst, to temptations, revilings and scornings, even of his servants, an
indignity which cannot befall slaves or vassals either born, or made so by men.
Or to use the Prophets words, He bare man's infirmities, not spiritually only,
but bodily. For, who was weak, and he was not weak? Who was sick, and he whole?
No malady of any disease cured by him, but was made his by exact and perfect
sympathy. Lastly, He bare our sins, upon the Cross, and submitted himself
to greater torments then any man in this life can suffer. And although these
were as displeasant to his humane Nature, as to ours, yet were our sins to him
more displeasant. As he was loving to us in his death, so was he wise toward
himself, and in submitting himself to this ignominious and cruel death, did of
two evils choose the less: Rather to suffer the punishment due to our sins,
then to suffer sin still to reign in us, whom he loved more dearly then his own
life. If then we shall continue in sin after manifestation of this his Love,
the heinousness of our offense is truly infinite, in as much as we do that
continually which is more distasteful to our gracious God, then any torments
can be to us: So doing we build up the works of Satan which he came purposely
to destroy. For of this I would not have you ignorant, that albeit the end of
his death was to redeem sinners; yet, the only means predestined by him for
our Redemption is destruction of the works of Satan, and renovation of his
Fathers Image in our souls. For us then to re-edifie the works of Satan, or
abett his Faction, is still more offensive to this our God, then was his Agony
and bloody Sweat. For taking a fuller measure of our sins, let us hereunto
add his patient expectation of his enemies Conversion after his Resurrection.

15. If the son of Zaleucus before mentioned should have pardoned any as deeply
guilty as himself had been of that offense for which he lost one eye, and his
Father another; the world would have taxed him either of injustice, folly, or
too much facility, rather then commended him for true Justice or Clemency. But
that we may know how far Gods Mercy does over-beare his Majesty, he proceeds
not straight way to execute vengeance upon these Jews which wreaked their
malice upon his dear and only Son, who had committed nothing worthy of blame,
much less of death. Here was matter of wrath and indignation so just as would
have moved the most merciful man on earth to have taken speedy vengeance upon
these Spillers of innocent blood, specially the Law of God permitting thus
much. But Gods mercy is above his Law, above his Justice; these did exact the
very abolition of these sinners in the very first act of sin committed against
God made man for their redemption. Yet he patiently expects their repentance
which with unrelenting fury had plotted his destruction. Forty years long had
he been grieved with this generation after the first Passover celebrated in
sign of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage, and for their stubbornness he
swore they should not enter into his rest. And now their posterity after a more
glorious deliverance from the Powers of darkness, have forty years allotted
them for repentance before they be rooted out of the Land of Rest or Promise.
Yet has not the Lord given them hearts to perceive, eyes to see, or ears to
hear unto this day, because seeing they would not see, nor hearing they would
not hear, but hardened their hearts against the Spirit of Grace, Lord give us
what thou did not give them hearts of flesh, which may melt at thy threats,
ears to hear the admonitions of our peace, and eyes to foresee the day of our
visitation, that so when thy wrath shall be revealed against sin and sinners,
we may be sheltred from storms of fire and brimstone under the shadow of thy
wings so long stretched out in mercy for us. Often, O Lord, would thou have
gathered us, and we would not; But let there be (we beseech thee) an end of our
stubborn ingratitude toward thee, no end of thy mercies and loving kindness
toward us.

Amen.
CHAP. XLVI.
HERE. 4. verse 12, 13. For, the Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper
then any two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and
Spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart. Neither is there any Creature that is not manifest in his
sight; but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have
to do.
1. IF a mere Artist (altogether unacquainted with the Mysteries contained in
Scripture, or with the drift on scope of this Epistle) should have See Fol.
3412, etc. a Discourse upon this Subject.
dipped upon this Text; he would have thought the Author of it had intended some
Copia Verborum, or Poetical Sylva of Epithites; the words be so many and so
ponderous. And yet there be as many several Propositions almost, as there be
words: And of all these Propositions, or this weighty structure of words, the
Foundation or Subject is but One; to wit, The WORD OF GOD. About the Attributes
or Epithites of This Word, though these be many, there is no difficulty or
matter worthy of any disquisition, which is not merely Verbal or Grammatical:
The Subject, though but One, admits, or rather requires many Disquisitions, all
truly Theological, worthy the search or pains of a true Divine.

I must crave your patience for the discussing of One Question, which is the
Principal, and is briefly this; What is here meant by the Word of God, whether
The Question, What Word is here meant; Verbum Domini or Verbum Dominus.
Verbum Domini only, the Word of God, as it was written long ago by the
Prophets and Apostles, or as it is daily read and preached unto you? Or Verbum
Dominus, that Word of God which in the beginning was with God, and which was
God; to wit, the Son of God by whom all things were made, and without whom
nothing was made that has either making or beginning.

2. Pontificii Scriptores, etc. The Roman Writers (says Paraus) upon the Text,
contend, that by the Word of God, the Son of God, God blessed for ever, is
here punctually meant. But by this good Authors leave, I would be loath to
grant the Romish Church all those to be her Children which stand for this
Interpretation; And more unwilling I am to make this any Branch of Controversy
betwixt us and the Romish Church: we have enough besides of far better use and
consequence, even in Paraeus his Judgment. For he himself ingenuously
confesses, Nil mali continet in se haec interpretatio, That this
Interpretation of Romish Writers (as he conceives all those to be, who by the
Word of God here understand the Son of God) does contain no harm nor evil in
it. And if it contain no evil in it, it will be no sin in it self, no wrong at
all unto Paraeus or other Modern Writers contrary-minded, to inquire, Whether
it does not contain some Good in it. Whether it be not the better
Interpretation of the two controversed, as well for profoundnesse of Doctrine as
for profitable Use. The Principal Reason which moved Paraeus and other Modern
Writers not to subscribe unto the Interpretation of men more Ancient Paraeus
his Reason why he denies it to be meant of God the Word.
and Orthodoxal, is, Because our Apostle no where before, no where after in
this Epistle, does call the Son of God, The Word of God. But this Reason is a
great deal too light to cast the Scales for his Opinion, supposing they were
otherwise even: For the Evangelist S. John, albeit he had oftener occasion to
mention the Son of God in his Gospel, then our Apostle had to mention him in
this Epistle, does no where (to my remembrance) instyle him, Yet does S. John 1
Ep. 1. 1. call Him, The Word of Life: and Rev, 19. 13.

The Word of God.


The Word of God, save only in the first Chapter. And yet no Orthodoxal
Christian doubts, whether S. John by the Word which in the beginning was with
God, and was God, did understand any other Person or Thing whatsoever, besides
the Son of God. And if our Apostle in the Text, had some more special Reason
then he had in any other place of this Epistle before or after, to enstyle the
Son of God, The Word of God: this will be enough, at least to bring the Scales
to an aequipoize; more then enough to Counterpoiz either Paraeus, or other
Modern Writers Opinion whom he did follow, or which follow him.

3. We are then in the first Place to prove, That the Word of God here in the
Text does necessarily denote or import, The Person of the Son of God. Two
Points proposed.


In the Second, To show the Reasons, Why the Son of God is called, The Word of
God, and what the Word of God in this place does punctually import.

All the Israelites were delivered from the Egyptian thraldom by Moses; And all
these Hebrews to whom our Apostle wrote, yea all Mankind were delivered from
that bond of slaverie which Satan had gotten over our first Parents and us by
right of Conquest. For the Son of God by his Conquest over Satan upon the
Cross, did make us all the Servants of God again de jure. That this First part
of our Redemption was universal, No man which acknowledges Christ for his Lord
and Redeemer, can deny. Again, our Apostle S. Paul tells us, 1 Cor. 10. v. 2.
That all the Hosts of Israel were under the Cloud, and passed through the Sea,
and that all were baptized unto Moses in the Cloud and in the Sea. And so had
all these unto whom our Apostle writes, been baptized into Christ. Now our
Apostle in this place supposes what S. Jude in his Epistle takes as A Branch
of that Faith which was once delivered to the Saints, That however that
Inheritance which we hope for by Christ, be much more Glorious then the
Inheritance which God promised to the Israelites by Moses: yet Gods Promises
unto us for entering into this glorious Rest, are subject to the same
Conditions and Provisoes, which the Promises made to the Israelites were, for
entering into the Land of Canaan. Now many of them came short of those
Promises: And so our Apostle takes as granted; Many of those Hebrews unto whom
he wrote this Epistle, might fall further short of those glorious Promises made
unto them in Christ. All of them were, as all of us by Baptism are, the the
Sons of God, and Heirs of Promise; yet most of them, as most of us, Haeredes
praesumpti, non haeredes apparentes, Heirs presumed or by adoption, not Heirs
apparent; that is, not heirs dis-inheritable, or irreversibly ordained unto
eternal Life. And from this Ground our Apostle takes occasion, and thought it
necessary to press repentance so forcibly upon them; first by way of
Threatening; then by Promise, or encouragement. By Threatening Chap. 3. 12. Take
heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
departing from the Living God, but exhort one another daily whilst it is called
to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, for we
are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence
steadfast unto the end; whilst it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden
not your hearts. And after he had proposed the fearful example of their
rebellious Forefather, whose Carcasses fell in the wilderness, he resumed his
exhortation again Chap. 4. 1. Let us therefore fear, lest the promise being
left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it,
for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them And again, ver. 11.
Let us labor therefore to enter into that Rest (he means that better Rest
which God had promised by Christ,) lest any man fall by the same example of
unbelief or disobedience.

4 But what if they, or any of us fall after the same Example? Their Case or
ours is much worse then the case of those rebellious Israelites was; worse, in
respect of the undoubted discovery of our backsliding, how secret soever that
be; and worse again in respect of the doom or sentence which must pass upon the
discovery of our backsliding. All this is employed in our Apostles Conclusion of
his Exhortation or threatening Caveat here in my Text, For the Word of God is
quick and powerful, and sharper then any two edged sword, etc. So that there is
the same Antithesis or Opposition; or rather, the same difference of proportion
between the Voice of God unto which the Israelites would not hearken, and The
Word of God here in my Text, from whom these Hebrews were almost ready to
revolt; as is between Moses and Christ; as is between the Land of Canaan and
the Kingdom of Heaven; And who, or what then can we imagine this Word of God to
be? We read sometimes, that the Voice of God is a terrible, a glorious voice, a
voice mighty in operation: But that I take it was not the voice to which the
Israelites would not hearken, for that voice, so often as God speaks by it,
will make men hear and fear whether they will or no. But neither that voice,
nor the voice which called to Moses from the Mercie-Seat, nor the voice of God
which did daily call unto the Israelites by Moses and the Prophets, are any
where in Scripture displayed or emblazoned in such propriety of words, as
import a Living substance endowed with life and sense, with power of
Disquisition and of Judicature; the Perfection of all which properties is
attributed to this Word of God here in my Text. There is no one Attribute in
this whole Catalogue, which does not bear a lively Character of Majesty, of
Glory, of Power and Wisdom so truly Divine, that it cannot befit any mere
Creature; none but him alone, who is the brightness of Gods glory, and the
express Image of his Person. No Living Substance, no Living Person is able to
sustain or undergo all these Glorious Attributes, save He alone who upholdeth
all things by the Word of his Power, which is the very Character of the Eternal
Son of God, Heb. 1. 2. Unto the eyes of this Word every Creature, that is, even
the most hidden Secrets of the heart of man, the thoughts of Angels are most
clear and conspicuous. Whence, if by the Word of God in this place we
understand any thing in the world besides Him by whom the world was made, be it
the voice of God which the Psalmist describes to be mighty in operation; Be
it the voice of God which the Israelites heard in the Mount when they saw no
Image; be it the voice which called to Moses from the Mercie-Seat; or be it the
Word of God as by the Instructions of this voice, it was written by Moses, by
the Prophets, or Evangelists. Or be it the Word of God in general, as it was
preached by them, or by the Ministers of the Gospel; it can be but a Creature,
and being a Creature it is discerned by the eyes of This Word ^^ made by him,
and without him was nothing made that was made. How then were all things made
by the Word? This he only knows in particular; But thus much we know in
general; The Father made all things by him, not as by any Manual Workman (as
the house which the Architect conceives, is built by Masons and other
Laborers) but made by him, as by the express Image of his Father, or as he is
the Idaeal Rule or Pattern of all things which the Father made: Or, all things
were made by the Son; after such a manner; (but incomparably more excellent) as
if we would imagine a curious Architect could erect a stately Palace in a
moment without the help of any Hand-Labourer, only by casting or contemplating
the Idaea or Module of it in his own brain.

7. Again; (...), imports as much as the Latin Ratio. And this signification
Justin Martyr expresses (...) by Ratio.
or expression of it, is no way opposite, rather coordinate to all the former.
And thus Justine Martyr with other Ancients express the meaning of S. John 1.
1. As if he had said, In principio erat ratio, In the beginning was the Rule or
Reason of all things. Unto all these we may add another Importance of the same
word, which squares well with all the rest. For Ratio in Latin, sometimes
imports more then can be expressed by our English, Rule or Reason. For Rationem
reddere, is more then to give a reason; it is as much (in English) as to render
an account. And in this sense it is fully equivalent Rationem reddere.
to the Greek (...), which is the very phrase used by Athanasius in his Creed,
(...), and shall GIVE ACCOUNT for their own works. This phrase or expression of
his Belief he took from our Apostle, Romans 14. 12. Every one of us shall give
account of himself to God. Now Christ is God: and this Account we are to give
to him, as he is (...), the ever-living, all-knowing Rule of that final account
which Men and Angels must give to God for all their works, for all their
sayings, for all their thoughts: And according to this signification or
importance, the four former Importances not exclude^ but presupposed, the word
(...), in my Text, is chiefly and most punctually to be understood. For however
by the Word of God, we must understand only the Son of God, to whom alone these
glorious Attributes can be ascribed; yet our Apostles expression of that which
he here intended, is more full and more punctually emphatical by much, then if
he had said; The Son of God is quick and powerful in operation, etc. For his
purpose was to display the Attributes of the Son of God, not only as he is the
Supreme Judge of Quick and Dead, but as he is the everliving Rule by which all
our actions must be examined, by which all accounts must either be approved or
disallowed: He is a Rule endowed with the perpetual sight and sense of a
Witness; with incessant activitie of an Accuser, or Solicitor; with the Life
and Spirit of a Judge, yea, Justice it self armed with power. All that can be
required to the conviction, to the condemnation or absolution of all men, are
in him, according to their utmost perfections. In that he is (...), a Living
Rule; He is perpetually able to give the Charge home and full, for whatsoever
Men or Angels are to account, for every idle word and thought, for such things
as the Parties Accomptants cannot think of. In that he is (...), a Living and a
Powerful Rule; He is able to exact all arrerages of such as do not sincerely
acknowledge them, and crave pardon for them, to the utmost farthing; able to
sentence ungratious servants (which have been unfaithful unto him, and cruel
unto their fellow servants) unto everlasting imprisonment, without the
assistance of a Jailer, or other Executioner of Justice: He is the All-seeing
eye, and Almighty hand of Justice it self.

8. Thus much of the meaning or full importance of the word (...), here in the
beginning of my Text: But we meet with the same word again in the conclusion of
it. And if you will have the Subject of all the Propositions in my Text, which
(as I told you before) some Modern Interpreters have rent asunder, (by making
an Hiatus or chink between the 12 and 13 verses) we must put the two first
words, and the four last, together. And so the Expression will appear to be not
only more full, but a great deal more elegant in the Original, then it is in
the ordinary Latin, or then I know how to make it in our English: As thus,
(...), (...), etc.

About translating the Original in the last words of my Text, there is some
diversity amongst Interpreters. The Vulgar Latin, which the Romish Writers are
bound to follow, translate the last words thus, Ad quem nobis est Sermo: that
is, as they would express the Hebraism, De quo Loquimur, of whom we speak; but
much amiss, and far from the meaning of the Original. Beza much better, Cui
nobiscum est negotium. To the same effect our English does With whom we have to
do. But the Ancient Gloss much better then both, Cui nobis redenda est Ratio,
to whom we are to render an Account. This indeed is the main business which we
have to do with the Son of God, or he with us. And so the Syriack renders it,
save only that He puts it in the third Person plural; To whom men must give an
account; which words according to the propriety of that Tongue, (and of the
Hebrew) may be taken impersonally, to whom account must be given. And this
Interpretation I find warranted by the Authority of S. Chrysostom and
Theophylact, two of the best Expressors of S. Chrysostom, Theophylact:
the Original or Greek Dialect. And thus the Original will run clear without
any Hiatus or interruption either in the Subject or Foundation, or in the
structure of the Attributes or several Propositions.

9. According to this Importance of the Greek (...), the Breast Plate (the first
of Aarons holy Garments, made for Glory and for Beauty, wherein the High Priest
did bear the names and the judgment of the Sons of Israel, and wherein the Urim
and Thummim were set) was called in Greek (...), or, (...); The meaning of
which is better expressed by the Latin Rationale, then I know how to render
either of them in English; but so called it was with reference to the Son of
God, as he is (...), in the Abstract; as he is Life it self, and Light it self,
not carrying Spectacles on his Breast, as the High Priest did.

All the knowledge or Light of discovering Secrets, which came by the Brestplate
or Rationale, or by Urim or Thummim, when it was in its prime use, was but a
glimmering Type or Shadow of this (...), Ratio or Verbum Dei, The Word of God,
to whose sight and inspection, the most secret thoughts, which lurk in the
Center of man's heart, the very temper and constitution of our souls, are more
perspicuous and clear then the inward parts of the Sacrifices were to Legal
Priests, after they had divided them joint from joint, and broken them up. For
unto this Dissection or Anatomy of Legal Sacrifices our Apostle alludes in this
description of the Son of God, specially in those words, (...), All things are
open and naked unto his Eyes.

Soli Deo Gloria.
