Moses Message TO PHARAOH,
OR God sending to the heads of England, ^o undo the ^eavy burdens, to let the
oppressed go free, Exodus ^.9.
to serve ^im in the wilderness, that he may do them good in their latter
days. For Israel shall be many days without a King, without a Priest, without
an Ephod, Hos. 3.4, 5.
and without a Teraphim, afterward they shall look ^he Lord their God, and
David their King, and shall ^ar the Lord, and his goodness in his latter days,
^os. 3.4, 5.

Sent in the time of Isreal's Captivity under Pha^ah, and his taskmasters, to
call to remembrance that the Lord did to proud hard-hearted Pharaoh ^^d his
host, then, that did oppress and burden ^^em, and would not take warning, till
they were ^^erwhelmed in the red sea, and he is the same God (...) power now,
that he was then; take warning be^^e, Exodus 14.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, etc.
and stop not your ears against the cries of the ^^or. Let England be a fred
Nation, to serve the lord in his own way, and take off all oppressions: for
(...) is grieved at it.

A word from the Lord, both to-Priest and People, ^^dges and Justices, and
cursed Lawyers, which op^^ss and burden the creation, to call to cease from
op^ssion, and grinding the faces of the poor, Isa. 1.17, 18, 19, 20.
and to ^n to the Lord, by putting away the evil of your doings, relieving the
oppressed; and with Zacheus, to re^^e to whom you the proud Priests, and cursed
Lawyers, ^ve taken; in tithes, gifts, bribes, and rewards, and ^^e it to the
poor, that they may not want; the Lord does require it, for that is the
ordinance of Christ, b^ oppression is the ordinance of the devil, and his
serva^^ ye are to whom ye do obey: put off the old man with (...) deeds, as
pride, and oppression, and grinding the faces the poor; the Lord does require
it, for these are or^nances of the devil, ^sa. 3.13, 14, 15.
and the Priests and Lawyers l^^ it wondrous well: The ordinance of Christ is
to fe^ the hungry, cloth the naked, and let the oppressed free; Put this in
practice, Isa. 58.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Therefore put off lying, it is of the Devil, put (...) pride, it is as evil;
put off covetousness, it is uncivi^ put off heady-high-mindedness and envy, for
they (...) cruel; Joh. 4.20.
and he that envies is a murderer, and no m^derer has eternal life abiding in
him, 1 John 8.15. A^ he that says he loves God, and keeps not his
co^mandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him, 1 Jo^ 2.4. And he that
abides not in the Doctrine of Christ he has not God, 2 John 1.9. Joh. 8.44.
and Ch^^^ says, Resist not evil, but abstain from all appeara^ of it. And the
servant of the Lord must be gentle (...) wards all, even toward them that
oppose themselves and he says, Put on as the elect of God, bowels of c^^^
passion, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-sufferi^^ and forbearing one
another; and if any man have quarrel against another, forgive him freely,
Colos. 3.1 and if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly ^^ther will
forgive you your trespasses; and if ye forgi^^ not men their trespasses,
neither will your heavenly ^^ther forgive you your trespasses.

How do the Priests of England walk according these Scriptures, that deny them
in practice? As the Priests in York- shire do, that imprison the servants the
most high God, for testifying against their deceits, (...) some of them have
lain in prison near hand a year, (...) never could have his ^^yal by the Laws
of England; su^ a Turk would allow more freedom. It is high time, the Lord to
draw his glittering sword, and exe^^ judgment upon the unjust. See, do these
Priests (...) Lawyers walk any ways answerable to the Scriptures? Woe to the
wicked, It shall be ill with them, Isa. 3.1
Isa. 3.

Take warning betime, lest the judgments of God come upon you at unawares, ye
heads and rulers, priests and Lawyers, and destroy with a sore destruction. Now
you have time, prize it, and turn to the Lord with all your hearts, that he may
have mercy upon you.

unawares.
O Israel return to the Lord, for thou have fallen by thine iniquity, Hos. 14.
and art at a distance from thy Maker, remember from whence thou art fallen, and
return, now the Lord is calling upon all people, in all places to return from
the evil of their doings, that he may have mercy upon them, Rev. 2.5 14, 15, 1^
all people whose minds are yet in the earth, and are delighting in vanities,
you are fallen from your maker, Isa. 55.6, Isa. 19.
and are hewing to your selves broken cisterns, that will hold no water,
forming up ways of worships, according to your imaginations, and so worships
the work of your own hands, Isa. 29.1
delighting in them, (...) 2.22.
O cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for wherein is he to be
accounted of? All man's teaching is vain, and it does exalt and feed the fleshly
man, ^^l. 5.19, 21.
and keeps that alive which must be destroyed, and it leads to vanity it self,
the fruit of it is made manifest; Israel after the flesh, are not the people of
the only true God, ^^l. 4.^ etc. (...). 26.7, ^.
it is Israel after the spirit of that the Lord delights in, he makes his abode
with the sons of men, he is purifying their hearts, that he may have an holy

wilderness out of all the earthly delights, ^or. 6.16 ^^v. 2.8, 9, ^^, 11.

and earthly vanities, to win them from all the worlds ways, and worships, and
customs, and fashions, and delights, and outside teachings of men, that he
alone may be their teacher himself, as he led Israel after the flesh out of
Egypt, from under proud hard-hearted Pharaoh, (...) 31.34. (...) 54.13. ^^b.

which was an oppressor, and kept them in bondage, that they could not serve
him, till he had them out of Egypt, through the sea into the wilderness, where
the Egyptians could not come, ^oh. 2.27. ^^h. 14.26. ^^o. 14.^^, etc.
but as they pursued hard after them, they was destroyed, and could not come
over the sea to them, where the Lord had carried them, there to make to make
his love manifest to them; there the Lord did teach them, and gave them a law
to walk by, and made a Covenant with them, which covenant they broke, and
forgot the mercies of the Lord, which he had made manifest to them in a large
measure, ^^o. 15. (...). 47. etc. (...). 48.1, 2. (...). 59. cap. (...). 1.21,

and a carnal part go^ up in them after they had back slided and fallen from
their maker, and then oppression got up amongst them, and pride, and they then
ground the faces o^ of the poor, and lived in lust and excess, and forgot to
execute true Judgment and Justice among the people, and the Lord saw it, and
it did greatly displease him; and he sent his true Prophets to cry out against
them; Hos. 8.^ and 9 1, 2. Hos. 14.1^ Isa. 3.11 12, 13, 1^ 15, etc. Isa. 3.17
etc.
and to tell them that they had fallen from their maker, O Israel return, return
says the Lord, why do ye grind the faces of the poor? because the daughters
of Sion are haughty, and walk with stretched out necks, and wanton eyes,
walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet,
therefore the Lord will smite with a scab, from the crown of the head to the
sole of the foot, and will discover all their secret parts. The Judgment of
the Lord was to come upon them, except they did return from the evil of their
doings; Isa. 28.1,
for so long as they were kept in the fear of the Lord, it caused them to walk
humbly before the Lord, Deuteronomy. 10 12, 13, 1^, 15, etc. Heb. 8.13
and they kept his statutes, and his ordinances, which he had committed to
them; he gave them a law to walk by, and made a covenant with them, in which
covenant they had many priests; and these priests was to offer up sacrifice,
and they was to do it without money, Heb. 7.2^^ 27, 28.
and the people they was to bring of the best, the pure and the clean, and they
was to bring it in freely to be offered up in sacrifice: in bringing the best,
they brought their hearts with them; the priests offering it up without money,
was a figure of Jesus Christ, being the Saints high priest, to offer up their
sacrifice to the father freely: Numb. 28. and 29. ch^^ Heb. 7.23 andv. 24,
and^^ Heb. 9.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 etc. Heb. 9.13^ Heb. 9.18 19, 20. Heb. 9.14 15.
and the people bringing it in freely, and of the best, the pure, and the
clean, was a figure of Jesus Christ, laying down his life freely: and as the
life of the creature was to be sacrificed up, for the purifying of the flesh,
the blood of the covenant, which could not make him that offered it up clean,
as touching the conscience, was a figure of Jesus Christ being to be sacrificed
up, and his blood to be shed for the purifying of the conscience: Jesus Christ
who through the eternal Spirit offered up himself without spot to God the
Father, was for the purification of the inward parts, and in the first covenant
which was outward to the Je^outwardly; Chron. ^.22, etc. Chron. 1. Acts 47, 48.

when they was come into the Inhab^ted places, they was to build a temple,
which temple was a figure of Jesus Christ, and the Saint (being the true
temple) of the living God; and the first covenant, they had Judges outwardly,
an^ they was to be such men as feared God, and hated ^^vetousness; and they was
to Judge the people at (...) seasons, and they was not to be partial in
Judgment, but to hear the cause of the poor, as well (...) the great, and they
was to plead the cause of the poor and the needy, and to Judge righteously
b^twixt a man and his neighbor, and they was to (...) it freely, and not to
take neither gifts nor reward for gifts and rewards blinded the eyes of the
wi^^ and that was a figure of the Lord being the Judg^ of the Jew inwardly
himself: and in the first con^nan^ they was to pay tithes, and they was to fee
the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and (...) strangers with them, and to
satisfy such as was (...) want, that there might be no beggar in Isra^^ that
the Lord might be praised, and glorified (...) them: in this first covenant,
which was outward they was to be circumcised, which was a figu^^ of the
Circumcision which was to be with^^ hands; and in the first covenant, they had
a Sa^bath outwardly, Exodus 31.13, 14. A figure of the true Sabbath, which the
Saints should enjoy ^^^wardly: and in this Sabbath they was not to sp^^ their
own words, nor think their own thoughts, neith^^ to carry any burden, not so
much as gather sticks; (...) that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day, was
ston^^ to death. Now so long as they did abide in covenan^ and walked in
obedience to the Lord, the Lord bl^^sed them, and made his love known unto
them; (...) when they did transgress, and broke the covenan^ the Lord sent his
servants the prophets, to crye^ against them, and tell them of their
transgressions: ^ee Isa. 1. Chap. The vision of Isaiah the son of ^mos, which
he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, Isa. 1. cha^
(...) the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezeki^h, kings of Judah. The
Lord had opened their con^itions to his servant the prophet, and sent him to
^he heads of them, to declare unto them their trans^ressions; see verse. 2. Hear
O heavens: He called upon the heads of them first, Isa. 1.2, 3 4.
then he called to the ^eet, All sorts of people; give ear, O earth: this was
the people that the Lord had made choice of, and gave them Statutes and
Ordinances to observe, and to ^alk by, but when they waxed full and rich, their
^earts ran after their riches, they made their riches their gods, and forgot
the Lord their Maker, and ^id not abide in his covenant, but rebelled against
^him; Thus says the Lord, I have nourished and ^rought up children, and they
have rebelled against ^^e. This was the people that the Lord had mani^ested his
love unto, in such a large manner, as he ^id, in bringing them out of Egypt,
where they had been kept in such bondage under Pharaoh: and by ^is mighty power
and outstretched arm, he brought them forth, and slew all their first born in
Egypt, and brought his people to the seaside, and there he renewed his love to
them again, and made his power known in suffering the Egyptians, Pharaoh, and
his host to pursue them thither, and there he kept them safe: when they had
neither wall nor bulwark to defend them, Exodus 14^ 18, 19, 20^ 21, 22, 23^ 24,
25, etc.
but the Lords own presence; and when they saw no way of deliver^ance, then did
the Lords love and mercy, power, and goodness, appear wonderfully in making way
^or them to escape from their hands; he led them through the sea, where he kept
them safe; and the Egyptians assaying to follow them, was all drowned. Here the
Lords love and power was much manifested to them in their deliverance out of
the hands of their enemies; and that which was salvation (...) them, was
destruction to the enemies. Now wh^^ they had tasted so largely of the love of
the Lord they yet afterward revolted, and looked back, (...) brought them into
the wilderness, there to (...) them; and he gave them Statutes and ordinan^ to
walk by, and made a covenant with them, th^^ they did abide in it, and observe
what he commanded them, they should have the full enjoym^^ of his love; in this
covenant their priests was to o^ (...) up the sacrifice without money, the
people was (...) bring it in freely of the best, the pure and the clea^ and
their Judges was to judge the people freely, (...) was to be done freely, and
there was not to be a be^ger among them, now so long as they stood in the (...)
of the Lord, he blessed them, and did largely ma^^ his love known unto them;
whilst they was in (...) wilderness, for forty years together, and the Lo^^
kept them there, to humble them, and prove th^^ and try what was in their
hearts, Deuteronomy. 8. chapter
whether they w^^^ keep his commandments or no, and there he humb^^ them, and
suffered them to hunger, and fed th^^ with Manna, which they knew not, neither
(...) their fathers know, that he might make them (...) know him, and depend
upon him alone, and to (...) them know that man does not live by bread alone,
(...) by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of G^^ their raiment waxed
not old, for forty years together, when they was in the wilderness, neither
(...) their feet swell; there was his love much manife^ed to them, that they
might know the love of the Lord to them, and there the Lord did forewa^^ them
to be mindful of his covenant with them, to b^ obedient to him, when they came
into the land th^^ he did promise to them, lest when they came i^^ it, where
there was fullness of all things, that the they should forget him, and turn
aside. Read (...) ^^e eighth Chapter of Deuteronomy through, and see ^he Lords
own counsel to them, before they came ^^to the promised land, a good land, a
land of ^rooks, and of Water, of Fountains, and Depths, that spring out of
Valleys, and Hills, a land of ^heat, a land of Wine, of Barley, and Figgs,
Deuteronomy. 8. v* 11, 12, 13, 14, v. 15.
and ^omegranates, a land of Oyle-Olive, and Honey, ^land where they was to eat
bread without scarce^ess, where there was no lack of any thing: Now ^e the
counsel of the Lord to them, after he had ^^omised to bring them into such a
good land, out (...) the wilderness, where was a terrible place of fiery
^erpents, and Scorpions, and drought, where there ^as no water, says the Lord,
Beware that thou for^et not the Lord thy God, when thou art come into that ^ood
land, in not keeping his commandments and his judgments, and his statutes,
which he had commanded them, ^est, says he, when thou art full, and have built
goodly ^ouses, and dwell therein, and when thy Herds and Flock ^re multiplied,
and thy silver and gold is multiplied, Verse. 14.
and ^ll that thou have is multiplied, and then thy heart be lifted ^p, and
thou forget the Lord thy God, which has done so ^reat things for thee. See
Deuteronomy. 8. chapter from v. 15. to the and, what great things the Lord did for them;
yet notwithstanding, when they came in to the promised ^and, where there was
such fullness, they forgot the Lord, that had done so great things for them.

And see if this be not the condition of England, now ^t this present: but when
they backslided from the Lord, he sent his servants the prophets to cry out
against them, Isa. 1.2. verse. Hear, O heavens, Isa. 1.2.
and give ear, O earth, says the Lord by his servant the prophet, I have
nourished and brought up a people, and they have rebelled against me. The Ox
and the Ass does condemn them; Verse. 3.
he brings the brute beasts as ^ritnesses against them: says he in the 3.
verse, The Ox knows his owner, and the Ass his masters Crib, but Israel does
not know, my people does not consider (...) have nourished and brought up
children, Isa. 1.4, 5, 6. ^sa. 2.7, 8. ^sa. 3.9, 10, 11, 12, 12, etc.
and they (...) rebelled against me: Ah sinful Nation, a people la^^ with
iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that are ^^rupted, they have forsaken
the Lord, they have prov^^ the holy One of Israel, they are gone away backw^^.
The people was grown proud and haughty: (...) Chap. 3. pride is got to the
height: is it not so (...) amongst those that are the greatest professors he^
in England, at this time? and it does greatly (...) please the Lord: he has
sent forth his servanu^ cry* out against it, now, as he did then. Israel, af^^
they had backslided from the Lord, oppression a^ cruelty got up among them,
their hands was full blood, and their fingers full of iniquity; as is no^ they
offered up abundance of sacrifice, yet says (...) Lord, Who has required that
at your hands? how (...) the beautiful City become an harlot? Isa. 1.21, 22.
it was so then, (...) it not so now? that which makes a profession (...)
truth, and does not practice it, is so now: back^^ed and gone out of the way,
pride is out of the wa^ yet proud men makes a profession of love to Go^ and
Christ, Prove. 6.16, 17, 18, 19.
but it is now found to be hypocri^^^ and woe, and misery is their portion: woe
to the pro^^ and haughty ones, Isa. 28.1. Isa. 59. chapter Jer. 5.28. Isa. 1.23.
Mica. 3.11. Isa. 1.21, 22, 23. Isa. 59.7, 8, 9. and v. 13, 14, 15. Zeph. 3.1,

pride is an abomination to t^^ Lord, and the devil he is the king of pride;
E^^land now swells with pride, and haughtiness, a^^ cruelty, and oppression,
and grinding the faces (...) the poor, and no justice nor judgment is exe^^ed
in the land, the Lord is sore displeased at it; (...) it was with Israel after
the flesh, so is it with England now, says the Lord to them by the prophet.
How is the beautiful City become an harlot! it was f^^ of judgment;
righteousness did lodge in it, (...) now murderers; It was so then, but is it
not so now where the Lord has discovered, and laid op^^ the deceits of the
people, to any of his ferva^^ now, as he did to Isaiah, and sent them to cry
out against them, they have some of them beaten, and ^^me of them stoned, and
some of them imprisoned, (...) a Popish law, and does not give them so much
^ave, as thieves and robbers, but shuts them up ^^ose by a popish law, and
professes themselves to (...) Christians; Acts 3.18, 19. Acts 4.1, 2, 3, verse.

but now they are made manifest to (...) of that generation that persecuted the
servants ^f the Lord, and are of the generation of Cain, and are no Christians,
but enemies to Jesus Christ: neither Christ, nor the Saints of God ever
perse^^ted or imprisoned any, but was persecuted and ^^prisoned, and by those
that made the greatest ^rofession of love to God, but was the greatest ^nemies
to the truth of God, as it is now, Joh. 8.40. ^^ain was a persecuter from the
beginning, and where ^ersecution is now, it is from Cains generation, for jesus
Christ said to his, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray ^or them that despitefully use you, that ye may be
chil^ren of your heavenly Father, for if ye love them that love you, what
reward have you, do not Publicanes so? ^ut I say unto you, Love your enemies,
and if thine enemy ^unger, feed him; If he thirst, give him drink; and who
o^ver shall smite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other also. Resist not
evil, but abstain from all appearance of it, and do unto all men as ye would
they should do unto you. Now he that abides not in the doctrine of Christ, is
a Devil: Christ never persecuted; he that professes love to Christ, and acts
contrary to him, is Antichrist; and so is an enemy to Christ, devourers and
murderets; the truth is imprisoned by the laws, and may not be suffered to
speak, and all manner of evil is freed, and at liberty: pride is at liberty,
covetousness at liberty, envy at liberty, lying, and swearing, and drunkenness
at liberty; because of oaths the land mourns; Christ Jesus is imprisoned, and
Barabbas set free, as it was, Hos. 4.2, 3. Isa. 1.23. Jer. 5.28, 29. Jer. 7.3,

it is; thy princes are rebellious, and compa^^ of thieves, says the Lord by
his prophet, t^^ children of Israel: Isa. 1.23. Every one loves and follows
after rewards, they judge not the f^less, neither does the cause of the poor
come unto (...) Is it not so now? the same deceits that was the^^ now; the
priests they preach for hire, which is abomination to the Lord, the false
prophets did, the true prophets never did, but was sent to out against them.
After that the children of Is^^ had revolted, and backslided, then they broke
covenant of the Lord that he had made with the the priests was to do what they
did without mon^^ but when they did not, the Lord was displeased (...) them,
and the Lord sent to cry out against the Sea Isa. 56.10, 11. His watchmen ore
all blind, (...) and rewards had blinded their eyes, and they l^^ every one for
his gain from his quarter, The (...) teachers did so then, do they not so now?
e^^^ one looks for his gain from his quarter, and wh^ they are. Isaiah was a
true prophet of the Lord, (...) as he had received freely of the Lord, he spoke
f^^^ to them again: and said, Ho every one that thirst^ome and receive freely,
without money or price: Is^ was a true prophet of the Lord, Isa. 55.1, 2.

Many great deliverances has the Lord given to ^^is nation, never like to any
but Israel; and af^^r all these large deliverances, his mercy is forgot ^^d his

but the Saints shall ^vercome, and the beast, and beastly worship shall ^^^e

that worship the beast ^^d his Image, and that receive the mark of the ^^east:
all the worship of the world is beastial, wor^^iping the work of their own

to fulfill what the law did contai^^^ after that the Lord had made a covenant
with I^^^el after the flesh, and they did not abide in it, (...) broke it, then
he promised that the would m^^^ new covenant with the house of Israel, and the
ho^^^^ Judah, but not according to the first covenant, wi^^ covenant they
broke, notwithstanding he was an husb^^ to them; but this is the covenant that
I will make (...) them, after those days, says the Lord, I will put (...)
laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I w^^ them, says the Lord, and
they shall not need to tea^^ ^very man his brother, and every man his

I will give thee f^^ covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, open
the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of pris^^ and them that sit in
darkness into the shadow light.

Now this was foretold of by the prophets, Isai^^ and Jeremiah, and the Lord
did perform his p^^mises, made by the prophets concerning his co^^nant: Jesus
Christ was foretold to be his new co^^nant; and when Jesus Christ which was
foretold (...) by the prophets came to fulfill and put to an end (...) that was
contained in the first covenant, all t^^ Jews, chief Priests, Scribes, and
Pharisees, Elde^ and Rulers of the people sought to put him (...) death,
because he came to testify against the d^ceits that they then lived in; for,
says Jesus Christ himself, Because, says he, I testify against the w^^^ that
their deeds are evil, therefore does the world h^^ me, It is the same now as it
was then, where Jes^^ Christ is made manifest in the hearts of his people Now
when Jesus Christ came in that single person, Heb. 8.6, ^, 8, 9, 10, ^1. ^eb.
10.9.
(...) came to put an end to the first covenant, which wa^ broken, and to
establish another, he went into the ^^mple, and into the Synagogues, witnessing
the ^^^filling of the Law, and said to the people, Matthew. 5.15, 16. ver. etc.
Think (...) that I am come to destroy the law: I am not come to ^^stroy, but
to fulfill the law, and he took the book, ^^d he read that place of Isaiah,
where he had pro^^esied, and foretold of him, and said, This day is ^^s
Scripture fulfilled in your cars: now, again he ^^d that heaven and earth
should pass away, but not (...) joi, and one title of the word, should in no

Christ was sacrificed up, Heb. 8.1.2 ver. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Heb. 10.1.
ver. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Isa. 33.22. v. John 4.20, 21, 22. John 4.23, 24.
which was (...) everlasting sacrifice, then all the Types, Figures, ^^d
shaddows, was to be put to an end, all things ^^at was contained in the first
covenant, both priests, ^^thes; sacrifices, and burnt-offerings, and all things
^^at was outward and carnal, the Law outwardly, ^^d the Judges, Lawgiver, and
Kings, for he was both ^^dge, Lawgiver, and King himself; that temple ^^ich
was outward, was to be disannulled after that (...) was sacrificed up, and that
worship, for says he (...) to the Woman of Samaria, in the 4 of John: Ye
^^rship ye know not what, we worship we know what: (...) the hour comes and
now is, when ye shall neither ^^rship at Jerusalem, nor at this Mount, which
had been ^^e chiefest places of worship, but they should now ^orship at neither
of them, but they that worship ^^e Father, should worship him nearer hand, even
in ^^irit and in truth: and after that Jesus Christ was ^^crificed up, which
was the everlasting sacrifice, ^^ese was all to be ended; and the Apostles who
^^re made to partake of the substance of the second ^^venant, which was Christ
in them, they went ^^th into the temple, and into the synagogues, to ^^aw the
Jews off from that outward worship, and ^^eached the resurrection of Jesus
from the dead, Jonn 3.31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, ver.
^^rist was risen out of all those Ordinances; they ^^s dead, there was no life
in them; Christ which was the life of them, was risen out of them; the^ had
been a beauty, and an excellency in them, (...) the time that they was
commanded, but now (...) substance of them was come, and the glory of (...)
Lord was departed out of them, both out of the ou^ward worship, and out of the
outward temple, a^^ they was sent to declare against it, and to draw^^ from it:
Acts. 7.47, 48, 49. ver.
Steven he went and witnessed against (...) and said, God that made the world
did not dwell (...) temples made with hands, neither was he to be wo^shipped
there, Act. 6.10, ^1, 12, 13, ^4. ver. Act. 7.57, ^8, 59. ^oh. 10.27, ^8, 29,

Acts 7. And they said he came to ove^turne the Statutes, and Ordinances given

in those, that either stoneth (...) countenanceth them that does, they was yet
nev^^ circumcised, with the circumcision made without hands, but are stifnecked
and enemies to Jesus Christ Joh. 8.41, etc. All that the Priest had for
offering (...) the sacrifices, in the first Covenant, they was to pa^^ take of
the things sacrificed, and offered up; and the^ had rythes because they had no
part nor portion (...) the promised land; and with those tithes the poor, the

out of them, that the Lord G^^ might bless them. Deuteronomy. 14, ^7, 28, 29. ^er.
But when the Priests took money (...) what they did, the Lord was displeased
with the^ and sent his true Prophets to cry out against the^ take the tithes
from the Priest, and take off that oppression that is upheld by the Lawyers;
for the (...) are taskemakers, as the taskemakers in Egypt, th^^ do burden

(...) these oppressors, and let the oppressed go^ree, the Lord does require it,
and let there not be any want ^^member the poor that are in wants, that they
^ay have food and raiment, and be filled and sa^^^fied: seek not your selves
but the good of others, ^^at the Lord God may bless you; let love run ^^th to
all, and let it be without dissimulation, and (...) the Gospel will be

who walk (...) after the flesh, but after the spirit, be not professors (...)

oppression; ^^low him in his example, you that profess your ^^es to be

you would be done by, or else never profess ^^e love to God and Jesus Christ,
for he will call (...) to account, and workers of iniquity must de^^ from his

pride and haughtiness, idleness and ful^^^ of bread, which were the sins of
Sodom and (...) the sins of England, forgetting the poor that are ^^ants,
bonds and imprisonments, but the Lord is ^^ing to visit his people that are

25.41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46.
in Matthew. 25.41, ^^* ^3, 44, 45, 46. ver. Paul who was a true Minister ^^sus
Christ, he was imprisoned by the Jews for ^^essing the truth, and Silas was

neither (...) he worshipped with men's hands as though he (...) any thing, who

to speak over ^^em, 1 Cor. 14.23.30, 31, 32. Isa. 54.13, 14.
1 Cor. 14. chap. God did fulfill his promise ^^ven forth by Jeremiah the
Prophet of the Lord, in ^^e new covenant, Jer. 31.34. where it is said that
(...) would teach them himself, and in Isa. the 54. ^^ere it was promised by
that Prophet, that all the ^^ildren of the Lord should be taught of the Lord,

covenant, they did ^^tness the substance of all that made manifest in ^^em
which was spoken in the first covenant, that ^^s made to the Jew outwardly, Now
he is not a ^^w, that is one outwardly, but he is a Jew that is one ^^wardly.
The Jew outwardly, he had his cove^^nt outwardly; the Jew inwardly had his
cove^^nt inwardly; Christ was this covenant, and they ^^und him revealed and

outwardly written in tables of stone; the Jew ^^wardly, he had his law inwardly
in the new co^^nant, written in the fleshly tables of the heart, ^^t with Ink,
but with the Spirit of the living ^^od: the Jew outwardly, he had his lawgiver
out^ardly, but the Jew inwardly, he has his law-gi^^r inwardly in this second
covenant: Isa. 33.22. Exodus 18.13. to the 28. Heb. 12.22
the Jew out^ardly in the first covenant, had his Judges out^ardly, the Jew
inwardly he has his Judge inward^^ in the second covenant; in the first
covenant, ^^oses was to set over the people faithful men, fearing God, and
hating covetousness, and they was judge the people at all seasons: ^am. 5.9.
^xod. 18.^0, 21, 22.
the Jew inward he has the Lord to be his lawgiver, Judge, a^ King, to judge
and condemn sin in the flesh, that (...) right^ousness of the law may be

the ^ad, and the spirit, and these three agree in one. In the (...) covenant,
which was outwardly, to the Jew out^rdly, they had a Sabbath outwardly, the

sabbath is a rest, ^^gne of the true rest, which the Saints did enjoy in ^^ist,
the second covenant, Heb. 4. There is a rest the people of God; Heb. 4.9, 10.

for say they, If ^^y man love the world, the love of the Fther is not in ^im;
no man can serve two masters; they cannot ^erve God and the world, for the love
of the world (...) enmity with God; and by experience, from the enjoyment of
this mystery of godliness, made manifest in them, they said, Eye has not seen,
1 Cor. 2.10.
ear has not heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man, (...)
conceive those things that God has laid up for those that love him; The Saints
did possess that which the world does but now profess; they had the full
enjoyment of those things which the Scripture does declare, and they did live
the life of the righteous, and they were gathered, out of the world, and did
walk up in obedience to the commands of God; therein was they known to differ
from the world: for, says Jesus Christ, If you love me, 1 John 2.6. 1 John
5.2, 3.
keep my Commandments; now they did so, wherein say they, by this we know that
we love God, because we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not
grievious, but joyous, 1 John 2.3. It is the delight of those that are borne
again, to do the will of God, none can but those that are born anew, for every
man by nature is a children of wrath, and the natural man, he knows not the
things of God, because they are spiritually discerned, and again, no man knows
the Son, but the Father, neither knows any man the Faher, but the Son, and he
to whom the Son reveals him; all the wisdom of the world cannot enter into the
knowledge of this mystery, to unfold it, it was revealed to the Saints, that
had the enjoyment of it, wh^^ the world hated, at every appearance of God in
t^^ discovering himself to his people; the world is in e^^mity against it,
marvel not if the world hate you: sai^^ Jesus Christ, it is not to be marvelled
at; for says he, hated me before it hated you, and says he, if ye were of i^^
world, Joh. 3.13. ^oh. 15.17, ^3, 19, 20, ^^. ^^ak. 6.22, ^^. Pet. 4.13, ^^.
^at. 5.11, ^^. ^^h. 17.18, ^^, 20, 21.
the world would love you, but because I have chosen you out of the world,
therefore does the world ha^^ you: and again says he, Ye shall be hated of all
men fa^^^ my names sake, but says he, Blessed are you, when (...) revile you,
and persecute you, and say all manner (...) evil against you, falsely, for my
names sake, rejoice a^^ be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in He^ven,
for so persecuted they the Prophets, that were before you; And where the Lord
is appearing in his people now, great is the rage and madness of the world for
whom God loves the world hates, nay the highe^^ profession persecutes the Lord
in his Saints, whe^^ he is made manifest in power; all profession without
possession is hypocrisy and dissimulation; Al^^ the holy men of God were
possessers, but the world now lives in words, deceiving themselves, and
di^sembling both with God and man, and practicing nothing but deceit: and the
Priests are the grand enemies to Jesus Christ, and the great deceivers of the
people; they tell the people they are the Ministers of Jesus Christ, and indeed
they are Antichrist, acting altogether against Christ; and they are the
greatest upholders of oppression of any, which Jesus Christ came to throw down,
the whole creation is burdened by this stinking professed Ministry; they act
the same things that the Scribes and Pharisees did; they hold up those things
that Jesus Christ came to throw down, and laid down his life for, and yet these
deceivers that deceive the nations, say they are sent of Christ, but they are
found liars; Jesus Christ foretold of such, that should ^ome, for says he,
there shall come false prophets in ^^eeps clothing, Mat. 7.1^.16, 17, 1^, 19,
20, 21.
but inwardly are ravening woolves, but says he, By their fruits ye shall know
them, Mat. 7. ^hey say, and do not. Is it not so with the false ^eachers in
England? they say they are sent of Christ, but he that says he is in Christ, 1 John 2.6.
ought to ^alk as he walked; Jesus Christ was an example ^or all his to follow,
and the Apostle who was a ^rue Minister of Christ, did exhort the people to
^ollow him, Heb. 7.8, ^, 10, 11, 12. etc. Heb. 8.6, 7. etc. Heb. 9.8, 9. Heb.
10.9.10.
so far as he followed Christ; now Jesus Christ came to take off oppression
from the people and to undo the heavy burdens that they groaned under then, by
the fair-sayers, as those hypocrites ^re now, that say and do not; Jesus Christ
came ^o take off that oppression of Tithes, that was one ^^ing that he shed his
blood for, but Antichrist holds ^up, which is contrary to Christ: Christ came
to throw down the idols temple, and to throw down ^he outward worship, which
the Jew outwardly had, and to fulfill all that the law did contain outwardly,
that he might place his law in their hearts, to be ful^illed there: That he
alone might teach them by his Spirit, without form, Jer. 31.33.34. Heb.
8.10.11. Joh. 4.23.24.
to worship the Father in Spirit and in truth, Joh. 4. Now the false teachers
in Eng^and holds up the idols temple, and sits in the seat of the Scribes and
Pharisees, acting as in a stage^lay for money, all for filthy lucre, and
prosesseth the Scripture to be their rule, when there is not a Scripture to
warrant them for any thing they do. There is not a word in the Scripture for
them to go to Cambridge or Oxford, to be so long there, to ^earn a trade of
deceit, to give a meaning to the Scripture, to gloss them over, by their humane
and serpentine wisdom, to deceive people with their imaginations; but to the
contrary, for the Scripture says, that every word of God is pure, and he that
adds thereto, or takes therefrom, shall be reproved, and found a liar, Prove.
30.5, 6. and (...) gain, see what the Lord said to Moses in Deuteronomy. 4. (...) Ye
shall not add unto the word which I command (...) but these goes contrary to
the command of t^^ Lord, that goes to learn deceit, to add their (...) mane
wisdom, to that which is truth in it self; a^^ the Spirit of God could not
understand its own d^claration. And again, says Jesus Christ, I testi^^ that
he that adds to the word of the prophecy, I w^^ add to him all the plagues
that are written in the B^^^ Rev. ult. And again, it is said, that no man knows
(...) Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Fath^^ but the Son, and he
to whom the Son reveals him, as i^ (...) in John. Then what use is all their
brain-study (...) It is all deceit, dung, and dirt: Away with it, a^^^ with it;
the Lord is coming to burn up all dece^^^ and deceivers, and to scatter the
proud in all their i^ ^^ginations. Howl, ye proud Priests, for woe and mise^^^
is your portion: woe was the portion of the Scri^^^^ and Pharisees, that laid
heavy burdens upon (...) people, as these deceivers do, that deceive the
p^^ple, and bewitcheth them with those things wh^^^ God never commanded,
telling the people that th^^ are Ordinances of God. There is not a word in t^^
Scripture for sprinkling Infants, and those fa^^^^ Priests say that it is an
Ordinance of Christ; a^^ they can make Christians (as they say) by sprinkl^^^
them with a little water, and so enters them i^^ Covenant; so making
Christians by their imagi^tions. These are the false christ's, and false
proph^^^ spoken of in Scripture. Now the Saints, they w^^^ baptized by one
Sp^^^ m o one body, and they were (...) of one heart and one mind. There is
not a word (...) the Scripture for Tythe-mongers, and false teach^^^ in
England, to have the tenth of the years Incre^^^^ of all things for their
brain-study, whereby they ^^ceive the people, professing themselves to be the
^^^^sters of Christ, and act altogether against Christ, ^ewing themselves to be
Antichrists. What Scripture ^ave they to take Tithe of wheat, rye, and barley?
What Scripture have they for their rule, to take tithe ^f oats, pease, and
beans? What Scripture have they ^^r their rule to take tithe of sheep, the
tenth lamb, and the tenth fleece? Eze. 34.2^ 3.4. v. 16 ^
But as it was amongst the false ^eachers in Israel, Ezekiel. 34. so it is with
the false tea^hers in England now; they teach for the fleece, and ^^ed
themselves with the fat: but the Lord will feed ^uch with judgment. (...)
^^^se t^^^ ^^est th^^ ^^ipture (...) Mini^^^^ Saints ^^^phold (...) not of

What Scripture have they for their rule, to take tithe of hemp, and flax, and
pigs? and what Scripture have they for their rule, to take ^ythe-apples and
plums, walnuts and cherries? what Scripture have they for their rule, to take
money for ^ggs, and to have tythe-geese? What Scripture have ^hey for their
rule, to take money for the reek passing ^p the chimneys? What Scripture have
they for their ^ule, to take a penny for a garden every year? What Scripture
have they for their rule, to take money for every foal that is foaled? What
Scripture have they ^or their rule, to take money for every cow that has a
calf, and a penny for them that have none? What Scripture have they for their
rule, to take a farthing of a shilling of servants for their wages? What
Scripture have they for their rule to Church women as they do, and take money
for it when they have done? What Scripture have they for their rule, to bury as
they do, and take money for it when they have done? did either Jesus Christ, or
his Apostles, that were the true Minister of the Gospel ever do so? See if
these be not the taskmasters of Egypt: there is scarce any thing, but these
deceivers have an end in it, they are altogether for filthy lucre, contrary to
the Apostle to Timothy and Titus, 1 Timothy 1, 2, 3. Tit. 1.7, ^ 1 Pet 5.2, ^
who were true Ministers of Christ, Tit. 1.8, 9, 10. See who denies the
Scriptures, but those that deny to walk according to them in life and
conversation. For shame, down with oppression: blush for shame, all such
deceivers, a^^ upholders of the deceits, and never profess love (...) God nor
Christ, ^sa. 33.14.^5.
for your profession is found to (...) hypocrisy: and woe and misery will be
your porti^^^ except ye repent, and give over deceiving the peop^^ Down with
all deceivers, ^ude 11. v.
and false worships; the gre^^^ day of the Lord is coming upon them all. What
Sc^^^pture have these for their rule, that have great su^^^^ of money, so much
a year, gifts and rewards, as (...) laams priests had? What Scripture have they
(...) their rule, that have Augmentations? And what Scr^pture have they for
their rule, to go to law for tith^^ or for any thing else, that profess
themselves to (...) Ministers of Christ? Neither Christ, nor any that (...)
sent forth to preach the Gospel, but all spoke against it: says Christ,
Whosoever shall sue thee at the law, a^^ take away thy coat, let him have thy
cloak also, Matthew* (...) and the Apostle, who was a true Minister, spoke
against it: and they that say they are the Ministers (...) Christ, and act
contrary to Christ, are Antichrist^ though they have never so fair a color,
they a^^ but the colored Beast, painted outsides; mar^^^ them that say, and do
not, those are false Prophets* Mat. 7. What Scripture have they any of them,
t^^ have the chiefest places in the Assemblies, and to b^ called of men
masters? The Scribes and Pharisee^ had, which were enemies to Jesus Christ; and
those that sits in their seats are the same. What Scripture have they for their
rule to go in long Robes, or in a color differing from their brethren? The
Scribes and Pharisees did so, which were enemies to Jesus Christ. What
Scripture have they for their rule to pray standing in the Synagogues, before
they preach as they call it, and after they have done? there is Scripture to
the contrary, where Jesus Christ says, Pray not standing in the Synagogues.
What Scripture have they for their rule, to be idle 6 days of 7, and then to go
into the Idols temple, and take a glass to speak (...); and none must speak
till they have done, nor then neither (...) there is to the contrary: In the
true Church all may speak, ^^^t all may be edified; but it is plain that it is
the false Church (...) of any thing be revealed to him that stood by, in the
true Church (...) that had it revealed to him was to speak, and the other was
to hold (...) peace, 2 Cor. 14. but it is not so now; he must be haled out the
Apostles were by the Jews, and either beaten, or stoned, o^ (...) imprisoned,
and shut close up, and not one to come at him, ^^cept he give them money: all
contrary to the Scripture, for (...) Apostle had more favor showed of the
Heathen, when he (...) imprisoned, then the Saints of God have now, by those
that ^^^fess themselves to be Christians, but it is plainly manifest that ^^^y
are enemies both to God and Christ. What Scripture ^^ve they for their rule,
professing themselves to be the Mini^^^s of Jesus Christ, to imprison so many
of the dear Saints (...) servants of the Lord, by a Law that was made to uphold
(...) Popish Clergy withal? See now whether these be not of (...) generation
of Cain, yea or no, and are of the devil, standing ^ctual rebellion against
Jesus Christ, now that he is arising in (...) Saints: but the Lord will be
avenged of all his enemies, (...) his adversaries, and he alone will be
honored and reign in (...) Saints for ever and ever. The great day of the Lord
is near ^and: Awake thou that sleep, and come to judgment: (...) glittering
sword is drawn, it is four bished, and made fit for (...) slaughter, to cut
down to the ground all the enemies of the ^^^d: he will plead with all flesh by
his sword and by fire, and ^^^t shall be the slain of the Lord.

Oh England, England, repent, and turn to the Lord: Let the ^^e past of your
lives be sufficient, that you have wrought e^^^^ and now turn from the evil of
your ways; Let him that stole (...) no more: Let him that is proud forsake his
pride and haugh^^ss; it is abomination to the Lord: Let Nabal forsake his
