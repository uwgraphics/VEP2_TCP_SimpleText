PICTURES Of PASSIONS, FANCIES, and AFFECTIONS. Poetically Deciphered in
variety of CHARACTERS.
The Parliament of England. INVOCATION.
GReat Genius of my Country, whose bright eyes,
Are macerated with our miseries;
Whose unrefisted royalty convinces,
The power of Prelacy, and pride of Princes;
Great Secretary to the Fate of Thrones,
That turn'st the wheel of Revolutions;
That put'st a period to Imperial Stems,
And crownest Conquerours with Diadems:
Beneath the steps of whose immortal station,
Sits (the selected safety of our Nation)
The supreme Power: Oh! pardon my instrusion,
If on bent knees, I beg the sweet infusion
Of thy clear Spirit; which in sacred slumbers,
May fill my soul with matter, phrase, and numbers,
Pregnant and perfect: Let my impartial pen,
Picture the proper praises of those men,
Whom Providence, by a decree of Fate,
Has made the succors of our suffering State.
The Character.
A Parliament, conveneth by the voice
Of the best N^tives, fitted for free choice;
In which no private Passion or Affection,
Should sway the equal balance of Election;
Where every man is just, and does not waver
For future fear, nor yet for former favor:
They do not choose Old folly, nor Young neatness,
Unrighteous Riches, nor ungodly Greatness;
But their Election to discretion yiedling,
They find fit timber for the famous building.
The grand Conjunction of the Nation signs,
To this Convention; where each man enclines
To actuate his Countries good, which he,
Prefers above his life, or liberty:
(Not born for 1 Cor. 10.24.
himself) does daily strive
How he may meliorate the Common hive;
Where (as he led his life) he shines a Star
In Council; or a Meteor at the Bar:
Here, men (like Surgeons) boldly do propound
Lancets and Salvo's, for the Public wound.
Some Members are cut off, others are bound
Up; that they may preserve the body sound;
Nothing is unattempted to gain health,
When as the Patient proves the Commonwealth.
Here (without wrath) one Neighbor calls another
To strict account; the words, Father and Brother,
Are useless; for who ever does intend
Ill to the State, is voted no man's Friend:
Here all do take a relish from one Cup,
The poor man sinks not, whilst my Lord gets up:
It is not strength shall break the public Hedge,
But all enjoy an equal privilege;
HE that respects no persons, bids us be
In point of Justice, Holy 1 Pet. 15.16.
even as HE.
The Parliament of England are indu'd,
With power to Constitute, Transact, Conclude,
To Make, Enlarge, to Alter, to Diminish;
To Nullify, Revive, Repeal, Replenish,
In Church, or State; with purpose to advance,
By Law, by Statute, Act, or Ordinance:
All matters Civil, Common, Capital,
Criminal, Martial, and Municipal,
With Maritine affairs: It is indeed,
Our Nations Soul, and Body, the decreed
And only Power to us, on Earth; whose use is,
To Right the wronged, and suppress Abuses;
Where sight-less Justice, is not set to sale,
Or forced, by the weight of gold, to turn her scale:
Where the impartial, wel-enacted Laws,
Countenance nothing but an honest Cause:
To rectify the wretched from such wrongs,
As may arise from Bribes, or Pleaders tongues:
It is a Sacred, and transcendent Session,
Where the unblemished Purple, daunts oppression:
The Poor man's refuge, and the Just man's care,
The True man's trial, and the False man's fear:
The Good man's Sanctuary, Bad man's grief,
The Weak man's prop, the Wretched man's relief;
The Patient man's reward, the scourge of Pride,
The Simple's safety, and the Nation's guide.
A Complete Man.
HIs Life is our best method, and the Graces
Compose him a fair Book of Common places
Directing to all virtues, that inherit
The glorious Microcosm of Blood and Spirit.
His Birth, is not his boast; for he will treat
Of his blessed Ancestors, as Good, not Great:
And though the Tapers of their Fame wax dim,
The illumination is supplied by him;
Whose most enumerate Virtues make such swarms,
You Will know his House, better by's Arts, then Arms:
He studies man, and does extract from thence
A knowledge, gained by safe Experience:
So justly square he is, that we may see
In him, Natures best Rules of Geometry:
A Dye without a Chance; whom Fortunes face
With smiles, or frowns, makes neither Sice nor Ace:
So uncorrupted with his Countries crimes,
He scapes their plagues, and fears no change of Times;
Who keeping in his own sublimed height,
Elects Friends not by Number, but by Weight,
That never durst admit of such a Treason,
As priviledgeth Passion to rule Reason:
Whose self-confining Edicts can maintain
All Acts of Parliament, to him are vain
And useless; since he needs no law at all,
Who to himself is a Law rational:
He is not one that mourns, or rejoices
At new Events, according to most voices;
And thinks the true tract to Eternal Rest,
Is not the Road which Most resort, but Best:
For matter of Deportment, he will never fall
At odds, to see a worse man take the Wall,
Assume the Table; or appear disgraced,
If, amongst many, he is saluted last:
In Argument, he treads a wary pace,
And you may read your Error in his Face:
In Disputations of Religion, he
Bars things Inscrutible, or Mystery:
His holy Actions such a faith expresses,
That none ask what Religion he professes,
Indep: or Presbyt: what he was, he is still,
And will remain so, call it what you will:
Honor is not his aim, though he would have
That worth which makes just Honor truly brave.
Like him that is contented with the fate
Of a Squires Title, and a Lords Estate:
Calamities, and Court-preferments, he
Looks on with such a Mediocritie,
That though the first would vex, the latter love him;
Both alike move, but never can remove him.
He is that real A^gus that can keep,
(In spite of Mercury) his eyes from sleep:
For flattery with an alluring tongue,
Like Hermes pipe, shall never do him wrong:
He loves his Equals, envies no Superiors,
And proves an humble pattern to Inferiors:
He safely sits above, and sees the salley
Of Peace-deflowrers, dye the verdant Valley:
Who against his unknown foes, does well agree,
To use his Breast Plate, not Artillery:
Conceiving though Hell threatens greatest harms
To Man, yet Innocence wants no Arms.
He is a Tower so flanked on every part,
By something more then Mathematick Art;
That Envy, Pride, or Malice, cannot be,
The Dis-composers of his unity:
But every shot sent from a Foe (perplexed
At Goodness) proves prevention to the next.
His high resolves fixed by divine consent
Pass Persian Laws, or Acts of Parliament:
Thus with an even pace, wears many years,
Dying imbalm'd in good men's spiritual tears:
These are the Virtues make poor man complete,
Whilst wealth and crimes patch up the rich man great,
But never good; for Hell and her Accomplices
Contrive to bury him quick in his own Vices:
When to others winged Soul ascends the skies,
With contribution from each Good man's Eyes*
A Drunkard.
Does drink himself away to drown his sorrow;
A man in esse, one that will to morrow
Mend all his former Breaches, if his Groat
Do not betray him to a Mornings draught;
Which being with club-husbandry expended,
He cries to morrow, till the year be ended;
And in effect appears vainer than they
That would attempt to recall yesterday:
The Pot and Pipe are wheels that give him motion,
He Is like a reeling Ship in the raging Ocean
Unpiloted; with all her Canvass spread,
If one a harbor get, the other a bed:
By passing fatal imminent Events,
Both are secured without their own consents.
He that is Lion-spirited in drink
Dares attempt more than sober men dare think;
His wine-wrack'd brain betrays him to all faction*
With both hands dextrous for sinister actions:
The failing of his tongue makes him appear
V^x'd that he thinks of oaths he cannot swear:
Which want, preserves his secrets from expense,
And proves a double (dumb) convenience;
Then, if he meet with no resisting Evil,
Small beer, and sleep, may dispossess the Devil.
But there is your Antick-drunkard, he that reels
And makes his wise head, understand his heels,
That with his irksom Dances will out-weary
Patience, and break his legs to make you merry,
Who has as many ways to drink a health
As ere the Jew his father had for wealth:
That Is devilishly affected with new oaths
And drowns himself in Frolicks, to burn Clothes;
Who thinks there is no such precious wit as that,
The astonished, wiser People, wonder at;
And all that claim but common sense, abhor it:
Yet as they wish, they have, they are laughed at for it:
But in the next Room look, and you shall view
One that does melt himself in Maudlin dew
On sober Cups, whose sublimed thoughts do raise
The liquid zeal with Tears, and Scripture phrase,
Who with dissolved soul upon the Board*
Not only spils God's good Wine, but his Word;
Yet vows on Superstition to trample,
Then drinks, and bids us follow his Example:
He much condemns the times, and does express
A bitter anguish against Drunkenness:
And fitly does appear in this, like they
Who bear a light, and stumble in the way,
His urinary Eyes, as they do borrow
The moisture from the Pot, pay it in sorrow*
And if true penitence in tears are found,
His sin and penitence do run the round,
He sits and sighs, whilst the sad sitters by
Must needs conclude his sorrow makes them dry;
But yet he drinks to all, and does prevent
Their pledge, as Mass Priests give the Sacrament.
Now all the liquor's out, for in his Eye
You may behold the juicelesse vacancy:
His Sluices (too) are shut, and by good chance
He sighs himself into a holy trance:
Therefore we'll leave him, and direct your Eye
On one that drinks by Rules of Policy:
Whispers blank Healths, and his discourse begins
With pinching arms, and kicking of your Shins,
And in his Winks, and Nods, cautelous he
Appears the very Map of Mystery:
Speak of a King, or State, and you may spy
A hundred Notions in his wary Eye,
To figure an obstruction; and will cry
This is no place to talk of Majesty,
Let Us drink our Drink up; such a cautious Else
Will make a Jealous Fool suspect himself;
For he, in every twinkling of an Eye,
Would seem to read some strange Discovery:
But it grows late, and he must needs dispatch
To traverse home, where (by the way) the Watch
Examines him, and finding him so sly
In answering, attach him for a Spy.
To conclude all, Drink is the souls disquiet,
The wrack of Reputation, Road to Riot;
The Port to pains Eternal, the decay
Of Life, Goods, Honor; Hels broad beaten way.
A Melancholy Man.
IS one that lives in singleness of folly,
Whose Summum bonum is his Melancholy:
A stray sheep from the fold, a piece of Earth
Dug from a Quarry where the Lead takes birth.
A Lute untuned, a strange mysterious Fable,
Of one unsociably sociable:
His sighs are broken Air, and his hoarse Hum,
Like a dead March, beat on a funeral drum:
The pleasures of the world, and he, agree
As fire, and parchment, the Antipathie
Unto Time, Tune, and Mood, and wonders what
Men (when they laugh) see to be merry at:
A man of mingled thoughts, that only tend
Unto a prosecution, without end;
One in whose head more drums and rattles are,
Than sunshine days display in Smithfield Fair;
In company you will find him by these types,
He gnaws his gloves, cuts trenchers, or breaks pipes
And if you tell a story, you shall know
His approbation, by his I and No
Unpleasingly mis-plac'd, which strange applause
Has i^s direction from the Speakers pause:
He sleeps with open Eyelids, and the theme
His fancy works on, is a waking dream
Of studied nothing, which at your departing
Vanishes (Vision-like) with sudden starting:
He Is the contriver of cross arms, fixed eyes,
Treads tractless fields, dark groves, and much complies
With mourning Myrtle, Willow, Ivy, and
The straying streams of an indented strand:
His walks are deserts, if he chance to see
The ruins of an old razed Priorie,
As motionlesse as the object he appears,
And sets his fancy back five hundred years;
His nights are vigils, where he nature wrongs
By measuring time, as Choristers do songs:
His own distempers make him turn so often
From place to place, no pillow can be soft;
A down-bed is a quarry, a bare board
Has as much ease as feathers can afford;
He lies, sits, treads on thorns, and yet we may
Not hence infer, he is in Heavens way;
For Hell accounts such hapless souls her own,
Whom black despair instructs to be alone;
His practice are strange looks, and does profess
The egregious garb of studied carelessness,
Yet vexes at your Boots, to see you go,
With not a span, distant from Top to Toe.
But this mad Malady does often spring,
From the soft Mischief of self-humouring,
Or an affected Pride; which being crossed,
The World and he, are to each other lost;
And prove so potent in imperious passion,
They never admit of Reconciliation.
He Is no Religion, though he do insist,
Much on the Tenants of a Separatist;
For such repugnance is in flesh and blood,
Men when alone, seldom converse with Good.
If this disease proceed from being crossed
In Love, and's amorous expectation lost;
There Is nothing more his ecstasy can move,
Then sad Romancies, where men die for Love;
Who by a quient intelligence does find,
That Birds chaunt out his griefs against Womankind.
He knows you Crystal Brook, or silver Boorn,
For his unhappiness, are taught to mourn;
And in carved Characters, each Tree shall tell,
The falseness of his fairest Florimel.
But if the rancour of this disposition;
Take root from being thwarted in Ambition,
The fierce resentments make him malcontent,
And (growing great) proves often a punishment,
To peaceful Nations; on whose ruins, he
Resolves to raise up Towers of Tyrany,
High as projected Babel; till it please,
God to destroy it, with all Languages.
He is the Bane of Government, the Fate,
And fierce affliction to the Church and State:
Not caring so his arrogance thrives,
If the red purchase cost three Kingdoms lives.
A Plundering Coward.
OF all our Martial Evils he is the worst,
Who fain would write himself Man if he durst,
His bulk, and needless magnitude has shown
The symptoms of (what he is afraid to own)
An active honest man; although we may
Conclude, naught is more different than they;
There Is less antipathy 'twixt Lamb, and Fox:
Honest, and Coward, is a Paradox
So great, that wiser Judgments may agree,
Poison and Balsam have a Sympathy,
Compared to them; He dares not be of that
Religion he must fight for; but is what
You please to call him, which (if understood)
It shall go hard, but he will make it good:
No man like him so guilty of detraction,
But hates the words of Sword, and Satisfaction;
The hour of Six, St Georges fields, the length
Of Weapons, with a Secondary Strength;
Su^^ circumstance as this has power to kill,
Mo^^ lightning-like than the Weeks mortal Bill
Presented to a Usurer, when he
Thinks of his crimes, and his mortality:
A Debtor meets a Sergeant with less fear,
Or Indian Merchants Galleys from Algier;
Yet he is the only thing that is most froward
To his own Tribe, and speaks the base word Coward,
With such emphaticall contempt, as if
He were Bellona's Officer in chief:
He Will lie (to) and be told so, yet you may
(For ought he knows) live many a fair day
Without accounting for it; no man as he
Does bluster so in civil company:
Or puts the Drawers and Bar-boy in fear;
But (if by hapless Chance) women be there,
His Dialect is Gunpowder, his frown,
Designs the sacking of some stately Town:
His ruddy rhetorique speaks naught but Wars,
Drums, Trumpets, Cannons, Granado's, Petars;
Hurting the Ladies with uncivil force,
To show them how he charged a Troop of horse,
And killed their chief Commander: Till they pray,
He will be pleased to fight no more that day:
At which he cries, Ladies I must confess,
This language is not for your gentleness;
I shall be silent, but will only tell,
How by one Cannon shot ten thousand fell,
At storming of a City; then (it may be)
Ere that, some Gentleman relieves my Lady,
That knows his vapouring, to whom he dares,
Sooner breath Blasphemy, then speak of Wars;
A boy out-braves him, if he can but threat him,
And each man is his master that dares beat him;
(That Is every man that knows him) to whom he
Has vowed Allegiance, Love, and Loyalty:
His Friend is one for whom he does not care,
Because subjected not to love but fear:
He Is one the town rides without bit or snaffle,
Kicked capable of every sort of bafflle;
And is contented to bestow the strife
(Received abroad) at home upon his wife,
Or quaking servants; nay, his very Doxy
Shall suffer, thus he grows revenged by proxy:
The Fiddlers greatly fear him, whom he puts
To flight, or frets them to the very guts:
If Marshall law for plunder han't destroyed him,
I Will teach you by his habit to avoid him;
His look and language are both rude, and rough,
His plump corpse laced in with larded buff
Of primitive Cows skin, which he does regard
So much, that all his actions are Cow-ward.
His hat pinned up, a black patch cross the nose,
A heavy iron sword, which fondly grows
To the kind scabberd, and (the more to brave it)
A greasy scarf, fat as the fist that gave it.
But if he have a fortune, you shall see
His Cowship in more glittring bravery;
Of beaver, feather, silver spurs, rich hilt,
The medall of his General in gilt,
Yet is an Armies Cipher, and does cumber
The place he rides in, to make up the number.
A Valiant Man at Arms.
HE is the Magazine of Mental treasure,
A man that wants not Tincture, Weight, or Measure;
Whose Virtues are an everlasting story,
With every Act, showing the Makers glory*
He is the darling of a noble Nation,
And on the Liberal Arts frames his foundation.
(The Pedestal of Honor) for he knows,
We meet as well with wise, as fighting Foes:
And that his judgment who leads Troops of Men,
Must be well versed in the Why, How, and When
Great Actions may be entertained; and be
Exactly skilled in Counter-policie:
If in the Volume of his Ancestry,
He read no public Acts of Chivalry,
He thinks his task the greater; and is fitted,
In all things, to perform what they omitted:
But if he find it filled with loyal glory,
He well continues, and augments the Story:
Thus armed, his Princes Crown, and Countries Right
Gives him Commission, to go forth and fight.
Rashness he understands not, but is sure,
It is no Virtue; and does well inure,
His care-devoted Mind with Patience,
The ready Road to free Intelligence:
Now Arts, (and a Just cause) give him the power
Of a prevailing, Martial Orator;
Where with sincerity, void of Invention,
His Language does so meet the Apprehension
Of vulgar Auditory, that the Sky
Is filled with the Free Votes of Live and Die
With our renowned Commander, who inspires
Their hearts, as one spark lights a thousand fires:
This Pleases, but not makes him Proud, or grace
His new found Fate, with an Affected pace,
Or Garb ostentative, as if he were
Something, he knows not how to make appear:
His speech is Affable, his Words are weight,
His Commands Gentle, his Directions straight,
His Memory mature, his danger such
It well expresses that he is as much
In Storms, as State; so Provident of's Men
That he would not lose One, to purchase Ten*
Yet his heroic Resolution
Gives Twenty Quarter, rather then kill One:
And all his Cruelty is, he will give
Life to some Desperate men, that would not Live.
His Soldiers Poverty finds such regard,
From him, they are never Paid, but with Reward,
Conceiving it an interest as due
Unto their Merits, as the Cause is true:
Only a Coward wants his Love, for he,
Thinks better of a valiant Enemy:
And sooner will preserve a fierce Foes breath
Then save a Coward from deserved Death:
His Army sticks as close unto a Town,
As Ivy to their Walls, And it is the Crown
Of his Ambition, that he dares to be
So near a Neigbour to his Enemy:
He parley's, Summons, takes their Propositions,
Signs them, and proves more firm to his Conditions
Than Persians to their Laws, entering the City,
His Garb declares rather a noble Pity
Than an insulting Pride, and nothing more
Invites him to become a Courtier
Than do the trembling Women, to whom he
Uows himself Guardian, not an Enemy:
No Bells rung, Bonfires made, but all is done
With such a solid Celebration,
As if the Conqueror well understood
Triumphs are Terrors that be died in Blood:
This is the Man whose Acts give life to Fame,
And does nobilitate his Countries Name:
Whose memory (sweet as the pious prize
The Gods accept in a pleased sacrifice)
Should be preserved from the ravenous fists
Of wasting Time, by our best Annalists:
Death is the Life of Good men, and since he
Must, at the last, show his Mortality,
Let all great hearts attempt with active power
To practice what the Grave can not devour.
A Complemental Man.
HE is your humble Servant, and can be
(Two minutes hence) so to your Enemy;
He Is often kissing of your hands, as if
He meant to play the Complemental thief,
And bite your Rings off; nor does only show
An homage to your Hand, but to your Toe;
Therefore by Supervisors, much suspected,
To be a man that is popishly affected:
A non Conformist, one that has denied all
Deity Worship, to make Man his Idol;
He often craves your pardon, and will be
In fault, that you may practice Clemency:
He tempts your faith with promises, and vows
You Are such a man, his Conversation knows
No parallel, then does he reckon all
The minor Virtues, to the Cardinal,
And calls them yours, thanking the auspicious Star
Made your affections first familiar:
If (in this studied Eulogie) by chance,
The wild uncalculated Fancy glance
On some thing that does tickle your opinion
With self-conceit, and make you your own Minion:
Ye are caught unknown to him, and cannot be
Guiltless your self of the Conspiracy:
Therefore in VViser men, much doubt it raises
When the Applause flows from a Flatt'rers praises:
Like that Philosopher who fell in passion
To hear that Bad men, gave him Commendation,
Wondering what Evil he had lately done
That might provoke their Approbation:
His Polite words, like over-sweet Perfumes
Delight the Nose-thril, but the Brain consumes;
Or ill compounded Viands, whose rich Taste
Seduce the Sense unto a healthlesse wast:
But to a man that has the queint resistance
Of keeping his gay Courtship at a Distance,
That knows his practick Cringe, his studied Phrase,
The starched Beard, with the smile-varnish'd Face:
He has as little hopes to work upon
As on a Saint, the Turkish Alcaron:
Plays, and a Dancing school, have made him fit
To be esteemed (by his own Tribe) a Wit,
And from the Femal sort his smooth words can,
Gain the applause of pretty Gentleman:
Civil, well spoken, that neglects the Road
Of common Garb, and does it All mode:
A Critic in the fashion, and has speeches
In praise of Ribbon points about the breeches:
Extolling these grave Times, that have begun
So punctual a Reformation.
The serving Creatures are his Apes, and know
His Nod, his Smile, his Simper, and his Bow:
The Vintners are corrupted with 't, and vent
Their vilest Wine with deep-fetch'd Complement,
Calling their fairest rooms, furnished in fashion,
By the queint terms of Good Accommodation
And such words squirted through the teeth, as when,
They taste your wine, like learned Cellar men:
Your Plush-tongu'd Mercer (to) it does infect,
Who learns to Cozen you with Great respect;
And sell his words in the bargain: but you must
By your Belief, teach him the way to trust.
We draw so much our Neighboring Air of France,
That Complement (like an Inheritance:
Is Native) like Diseases of succession,
And sticks, as close as Primitive Transgression;
What vanity it is in the open Street,
Meeting your friend, to dance about his feet,
And he 'bout yours, as if you meant to show,
The people tricks, whether they will or no,
Or protest Friendship to the man you Hate,
And Promise what you vow to Violate:
Happy those Times that could such Men afford
Whose greatest Obligation, was a Word;
Whose if I can I will was of more power,
And vallid, then the Oaths of a whole Hour,
Vented in this Age; when but Clapping Hands
Where Seals, and Signets, Bonds, and Counterbonds;
For nothing more has caused this Kingdoms smart,
Then such division 'twixt the Tongue and Heart.
A Rustic.
IS a rude Son of Adam, who intends
To wear his Fathers Curse at's Fingers ends:
His Cattle are so much his Consultation,
They make him of a Beastly Conversation:
But his transport of Corn, expresses plain,
It Is he the Proverb terms A Knave in Grain:
He is all Mortal, and we justly say,
His Composition is but Grass and Hay:
Virgil he knows not, yet has skill concerning
Some Practique parcels of Georgick Learning:
He may arrive at Heaven, for each Day
His progress lies through some thorny way:
And should be stout, for though his Roof afford
No Gun, it is defended by the Sword
Of glorious Bacon, which in rust hangs by,
To hew the hunger of Posterity:
These Modern times molest him, since mad Blades
Have taught him Billets, Quarters. and Brigades
O Horse, and Foot; which (for ought he can find)
Are but new Words, made to destroy Mankind:
He loves no Fighting, yet sometimes a large
Party of Horse will put him to the Charge;
But then he brags, though he be forced to yield
His House, he will be Master of the Field:
He Is always doubtful of his Guests, and knows
No nice distinction 'twixt his Friends, and Foes:
Which makes him Mute, and warily to hide
His grave Opinion, till he know what side
They fight for, and does (cunningly) prepare
For either Party, one set Form of Prayer.
It is a Problem of most hard Digestion,
If (suddenly) any propound the Question,
To have his voluntary quick Consent,
Whether he be for King or Parliament;
And puts his Clownship in so deep a Trance,
He knows not what to plead, but Ignorance:
He would not have the Service Book put down,
For the two Weather Prayers (the only Crown
Of his Devotion) which (for ought he knows)
May be some slender Cause, that his Grass grows:
These cruel Times move him to much remorse,
Not that they kill the Men, but spoil the Horse,
Eat up the Grass, yet can the sad Assertion
Procure no Writ of Trover, or Conversion
Against the Trespassers, whose warlike Words
Are Statutes, and whose Warrants are their Swords:
Yet though his Corn, and Cattle, wasted are,
'T has versed him in the Dialect of War,
For now he can rehearse to you at large
A Troop, a March, Battalia, and a Charge,
Retreat, Relief, a Battry, and a Call,
Then from a Colonel to a Corporal
Speaks Offices gradatim* nay, he knows
Not only what the Words are, but the Blows:
There Is scarce a Woman in his house but she
Can (naturally) train a Company;
Though he had rather simply understand
The downright, thrifty, old Words of Command;
As Gee, Ho, Ree: and his blind Troopers call
By the known names of Dun, Sorrel, and Ball:
But now his hopes are (and I hope so to)
That he shall plow in Peace again, and go
In safety to the Market, though he dwell
Till Monday at the Tap, 'cause Corn sels well:
And who does know, but such a time may come
When the blown Bag-pipe shall outvie the Drum?
And the majestic May Pole have admission,
To be erected, without Superstition:
When Meg, and Margery, with Siss, and Doll,
Shall be allowed to dance their Bellies full;
And my rude Rustic (whom I do confer
Honor upon, in this wild Character)
Shall be a hob nailed Judge amongst the rest;
And gravely give his Censure who does best;
VVhilest his gray Wife, has her Ambition full
Fraught with the Style of Mistress Constable,
At every Word, and he erect his Nose
(In pride) to think how Wealth, and Honor, grows
Upon his Shoulders, whom we'll let alone,
Till a Sub poena bring him up to Town.
A Seaman.
IS the Worlds Water-work, and may be said,
(Justly) to have a Swimming in his Head;
With him the Phrase our Country makes so common,
Is true, that Time and Tide, will stay for no man;
For which he quits the Shore, his Drink and Drabbing,
To be confined or coffined in his Cabin:
He knows the Winds, with all their various Courses,
Nominally, as Plow-men do their Horses;
But cannot so command them: he is one
So daily used to Inundation,
On whose tanned Face so many Waves are hurled,
That nothing but the Burning of the World,
Could make him fear the latter Day, though he
Has but slow Faith, Fire should consume the Sea:
His steerage at the Helm, makes him appear,
Not very much unlike a Conjurer:
And all those Waves, and Winds, that act their part,
About him, Spirits conjured by his Art:
What is a Thief's Despair, becomes his Hope;
One's Faith, and to'thers Fear, lies in the Rope:
The term of Freshman is a great derision
Unto the Trade, for He, and his Provision
Are pickled both alike, which (with their peason)
Renders them Creatures never out of Season:
Pitch, Tarr, with heart of Oak, are the three chief
And naval Articles, of his Belief:
But nothing can beget a greater quarrel
Than Leaks, or Sparks, too near the powder barrel:
For though without these Elements he dies,
They are his strongest, nearest Enemies,
The Dangers of the Deep rather appear
A Merriment, than Object of his Fear:
And when his Piscatory humor flows,
The mightiest Whales are but his Play-fellows:
Sharks are his best Familiars, but (the more
His grief) his pretty Whiting Mop's on shore:
Only a good Faith cures him, which makes her
A Votresse to her absent Mariner:
And though the Shore enjoy the sacred Shrines
Of Bacchus, still he is troubled with the Signs
Of Taurus, Leo, Cancer, Capricorn,
And some such Constellations, that adorn
The situation of the Zodiac,
Nay, he is acquainted with the jolly Pack
Of all the Planets, but 'twill hardly be,
That Venus should seem sociable at Sea;
Though it is Native to her; unless he
Transport light VVares to Lisbon Nunnery;
Or carry cold meat to the Men that draw
Feminine hunger in Virginia,
Barbados, or Bermudas, where the Lasses
(Which here in England were but broken Glasses)
Are cemented for Wives, and put in the Fashion
Of Honest Women, in a new Plantation:
His Climbing shows him proud, though the World sees,
He raises all his Fortunes by Degrees;
Without much disproportion, we may vie,
His Sea-trade, with the Plowmans Husbandry;
A Ship's the Plow, a Rudder is the Tail,
A Stem the Plow-Share, Horses VVinde and Sail:
One cuts the Waves, the other Grass and Thistles:
The Boatswain and the Plowman, use their Whistles:
The Ocean does contain both Hills and Dales;
High Seas are Mountains, and calm Waters Vales:
In all particulars, they are partakers,
One furrows Leagues, the other turns up Acres:
The Rocks are Hedges, and the Fishes be
More numerous (in multiplicity)
Than Beasts are on the Shore; Nor does the Sand
And Sea, prove less preservative than Land:
The Husbandman (by Heavens good advice)
Distributes Grain, the Seaman Merchandice.
(At the same rate of Counsel) and 'twere good
Astrology by both were understood;
When one has Reaped, and the other Peril past,
Both dance, about the May Pole, and the Mast:
London's the Barn, where casting off their Armors:
(Just) at the Custom-house, he finds the Farmers;
And least the subtle Searchers should deceive him*
'Till all the Goods are brought a shore, we will leave em.
A Common Soldier.
IS one that would seem Wise, and understand,
For Silence is his first word of Command:
He may be (by his Officers assistance)
Made mannerly enough to know his distance:
Six foot, or less; One that has cause to thank
His Destiny, he lives in a good Rank:
His Leader should be right, for (sink or swim)
March, or Retreit, he is bound to follow him:
He is a man whom Fortune has bereft
Of Constancy, for to the Right, or Left,
He always wheels, and (like her frown or fleir)
One turn, converts the Van, unto the Rear:
Two shillings binds both him and his Comrade
Prentice to this ubiquitary trade
Of Marshal Mischief; and (what is strange to me)
When they are taken Prisoners, they are Free:
With Knapsack on, Match, Musket, Band of leir,
Powder, Bullet, and Sword, he does appear
Like Mars his Journyman, and (if Death stop
Not his advance) may prove Fore man oth' Shop:
Which is the first File-leader, and from thence,
( Gradatim) mount to higher Eminence:
For (once a Halbert gained) the very chance
Of war, yields Honor, by Inheritance:
They have one Custom, Civil Law abhors,
Their Enemies, are still Executors:
Yet (in a sense convertible) complies
With us, for ours, sometimes, prove Enemies;
These Soldiers are mad Surgeons, and let blood
Ere the Disease, or Sign, be understood;
Their Pills are very powerful for (to those
They give them) one will serve for a whole Dose.
The same success, sometimes, our Doctors know
Both use their Art, Cum Privilegio:
A Soldier (of all men) cannot agree
With Courtiers, what should the Reason be?
They both love Honor, and, which is the prouder,
Is disputable, both do deal in Powder
And Plasters, to, although the Soldiers Glory
(In faith of Fame) have the best Salvatory:
Religion is a thing he will think upon
At better leisure, when the Wars be done:
In the mean time, his Conscience can agree
With bold Belona's red Divinity:
Whose Basis is the Pedestall of ill,
And grand Commandment, that Thou shall kill,
Pillage, Imprison, Plunder, and do all
That is conducible unto the fall
Of him thou call'st thy foe; Patience, and Peace,
Are both Apocripha, and do increase
Plenty, and Pride; therefore resolved they are
No Law shall be Canonical but War:
The Foe a desperate Outlaw, whose abuse
The Sword, Musket, and Cannon must reduce
To the same wild Obedience, and shall use
Some strange Religion, they are yet to choose:
This is my Soldiers doctrine, and the right
End of the wrong devise that makes him fight;
Little supposing that a wheel of State
Gives such a powerful motion to his Fate:
And whirls him round, until his giddy Sense
Has lost the freedom of Intelligence:
But this is now his trade, and he must on,
March is the word, and Pay is thought upon:
His Quarters (to) are good, or else he will know
A reason why he may not make them so:
In brief, A Private Soldier is a man
(If rightly spirited) in whose short Span
Of Life, the Officer that brings him on
May read rich Rules of Resolution:
And not disdain to practice; since the Stuff
Of Valor, does not constantly line Buff,
Nor ride the barbed Barbie, whose fire,
Is quicker then his burden does desire:
A Soldier animally fraught with store
Of mettle, is (though rugged) Gold in the Oar;
So well inured to hardness, he dares yield
His Corpse to the cold herbage of a Field,
And in the fury of the fowlest weather
There join his Musket, and his Rest together.
A Roaring Boy.
HE is the Kingdoms froth, the Wisemans Wonder,
The Coward's Gallant, and the Taverns Thunder:
A thing disguised in Noise, and one that finds
A great Delight in vying with the VVindes:
If Man's Life be a blast, we cannot form
His to be less outrageous than a storm;
For at his Midnight Revels, in a Tavern,
He puffs like Boreas from the Northern Cavern,
Where Pots and Bacchanalians look next day
Like men whom last nights Tempest cast away:
His frequent Jests are Blasphemies, and swears
Such Oaths, the Hearers wish ^hey had no Ears:
Hellfire he fears not, for he knows (before
He goes) the Devil can but make him Roar:
He is the Devil's Agent, to persuade
Our younger Fry of Gallants to his Trade:
Who does with such mysterious craft deceive um:
That they are forced to Live by it, ere he leave um:
A Bail of Dice (which ow nothing to Chance)
With cheating Cards, are his Inheritance:
Then for his Women, he has choice of Faces,
Learnedly registered, with Common places
In his black Book (and for a Sum) you may
VVin on his gentle Nature, to betray
Your Liberty unto some One, which he
Vows, has but new lost her Virginity;
Merely drawn into it, by some great Lord,
Although by twenty names, she is on Record
In both Bridewels; and every Autumn, fills
A Ream of Paper, with her Doctors bills:
So comes forth (like some book that had offended*
The world) newly Corrected, and Amended.
These Creatures Annually do contribute
To his Necessity, with Buff, Red suit,
Dutch hat, and Bilbo, that must needs be drawn
When any of their Honors lie at pawn:
By which, he gains a liberty to know
Their Sensual sheets Cum Privilegio:
And (for a surplusage sometimes) his Fate is,
To get Morbosus Generosus, Gratis:
He talks much of great Houses, and 't is true
He has lived in them, Give the Devil his due:
The Poultry, Woodstreet, Newgate, and Bridewel,
A Lordship which he willingly would sell:
But that it is entailed, and must descend
To the Heirs Femal: Nay, it is thought, his End
Will be in some Great Mansion, for the Stews
May purchase him, Thomas, or Bartholmews:
It is most fit, Men that have lived as he
Has done, should end their days in Charity:
But he is not come to that yet, now he Raigns
Like Dominus fac, with his Inglorious trains
Of new fledged Gallantry, who spread the street
With their pied Plumes, Sophistically sweet
As the Exchange in Term-time, that invites
The new-dub'd Ladies, of our Country Knights:
He walks in Westminster, where his wise Pate
Contrives some Criticism on the State,
Censures the Reformation, and would be
Content, the People had more Liberty:
Speaks of Arrears, although he nere did wrestle
A Fall in the Business, beyond Windsor Castle:
Yet, for the Fighting Dialect, he talks
Most of Duellum, where he struts, and stalks,
Extends his large Man-slaying Arm, and cries,
They were too cruel, who did first devise,
This beating Men with Bullets, (so he might
Complain of them, which taught them first to fight
For any zeal he bears to it) though the Words
Of Slaughter, War, Combat, and drawing Swords,
He Will talk of, like illiterate Men, that throng
To hear Orations made in the Greek Tongue:
Thus is the Bubble blown, whom (aptly) we
May term, the Blister of Humanity;
The Timpany of Nature, the Worlds Wen,
Man in Monstrosity, from whom all Men
Should fly as from a Plague, when Death displays
His Mortal VVings in the Canicular Days;
That, but destroys the Corpse, This, kills the Fame,
Health, Wealth, Life, Soul, the Body, and good Name.
A Usurer.
BE it known to all men by these Presents, that
This great Extortor, was a spurious Brat,
Sprung from the Spawn of Mammon, now, the Actor
Of Man's Confusion, Pluto's chiefest Factor,
Obliged unto him in a thousand Scrowles
To ingrosse the World, and lie Leiger for Souls:
One blessed with Curses, and such Men do least
Love him, in whom he has most Interest:
His Life is Contradiction, and all
His thrifty Actions, Paradoxical:
He Is Poor in the midst of Plenty, and does grutch
Himself enough, because he has too much:
Extremely Avaritious, yet would die
With grief, were it not for Prodigality:
Cruel in the Act of Charity, for when
He parts with Coin, it is to undo the Men
That have it, which (if punctually they pay)
He curses them, because they keep their Day;
And well he may, for it proves fatal to him*
His very Guardian Angels do undo him:
Money was only made for Use, yet we
In him, find Use the greatest Injury:
Fear of the latter Day keeps him in aw,
For he fears Justice, though he lives by Law:
And does much doubt the fatal Day should come,
To binder the receiving of a Sum:
Good Acts and Deeds he loves, if they conduce
To Gain, Sealed, and Delivered for his Use:
And is so jealous, that he will not deal
With his own Father, without Hand and Seal:
These words in Leases are his Luxury,
To have, to hold, enjoy, and occupy;
Which by a vain Construction, (used in Mirth)
Makes him Incestuous with his Mother Earth:
He has a hundred Suits, and yet his Back
Knows but one Garment, greasy, patched, and black
As his own inside; He is much at strife,
That Law can grant no Leases for long Life:
And gratulates the happiness of them,
That lived in the Days of old Methusalem:
That he has read in the Bible, yet his Faith
Is more in Statutes, than what Scripture says;
And (like a Sectarist) would fain consent,
To nullify the Last Commandment:
Nor does he like the Second, it does hold
Much against Graven Images, and Gold:
To a young Heir he is worse than all the Birds
Of Rapine, that the whole Country affords:
He sucks the Marrow, and it does him good,
To glut his Avarice with humane Blood
Of undone Debtors; till they grow so poor,
They Are forced to beg an Alms at their own Door:
Gallants more spirited, are forced to spread
Their Wings in other Climes, and fight for Bread;
Knowing not how their Hungers to refresh
But with expense of Blood, to purchase Flesh:
His hoorded Sums are but so many Stealths,
Conducing to the Bane of Commonwealths;
The State and People suffer, where such Men
Ingulf the useful Treasure, so that when
A State-securing Army should be paid,
Unequal Rates, unwillingly, are laid
On weaker Shoulders, which, too often, have drew in
A Foreign Power, and proved a Nations Ruin:
Him and a Conjurer, Satan does fool
Alike, they both are practiced in one School:
The sweet Sin makes his Intellect so dim,
He thinks he has the Devil, when he has Him;
The Scrivener, and the Broker, are his two
Assisting Suffragans, that must undo
The sliding Knots, of such men's Fortunes which
Contemn the paltry Pride of being Rich:
Thus does he waste his ne'r-returning years,
In Daily Stratagems, and Nightly Fears:
Whilst the poor Widows Tears, and Orphans Cries,
Like the first Bloodshed, do ascend the Skies,
Till Death's Arrest his greedy Corpse assail,
With such an Action, that admits no Bail:
But must Eternally in Prison lie,
Who, all his Life, dealt in Security.
A Prison.
A Prison is a Period of the Law,
A living Sepulcher, where Men do draw
No Air, but what proceeds from sad Complaints*
A Purgatory, from the which no Saints,
But Angels can release them: It Is the place,
Where Wildest Men gain the habitual grace,
Of being Staid, and though they are bereft
Of other Chattels, have a House still left
Admits no Sale, which (by the great resort)
May properly be styled an Inn's of Court,
Where Under-graduats that never saw
The penal Statutes, here, do study Law,
And prove good Counselors, for they importune
All Men to Providence by their Misfortune:
It is the Rendezvous of Rags, a Place
So steril, men are seldom in good Case:
They may be Monsters, for unthankful Fate
Has taught them all a trick to be in-Grate;
It Is (not unfitly) called Subtletie's Schole,
Where they can See day at a little Hole;
And some come hither only for such ends,
As may confer a Trial on their Friends:
A House that little Charity imparts,
For Men do still condemn their own kind hearts:
They are Vessels in a Calm, but the Fresh Gale
Of a Release, makes them to hoise up Sail,
And lanch into the Deep, till, now and then,
Some cross Winds force them to their Port again:
Sergeants are Men of War, and do most slaughter
Upon the Merchants at an Ebbing Water:
A Jailor is the Boat-swain, who still watches
His barbrous time, to stow Men under Hatches:
Juries and Outlaries are Wind and Tide,
The fatal Upper Deck the Masters side;
Anchors are Executions; and Extents
Are the rough Rocks, that many a tall ship rents;
Intricate Cases are the Tacklings, which
Perplex the Mind; and Creditors the Pitch;
The Law to be the Lodestone does not grudge;
Pursers are Counselors, a Pilot Judge;
Attachments Cables, a long Term prevails
To be the Mast, Chancery Bills the Sails:
Here, such as have profusely rioted,
May prevent Surfets, and be Dieted
With public Charity; which I am sure
Did never yet beget an Epicure:
Here, they talk any thing, for still they cry,
They can but be in Prison; and to die
(Their Hopes are come to such a low Decrease)
Daunts not, it is but a new word for Release:
The un-hung Chambers, with the numerous Beds,
(Where open-eyed they lay their careful Heads)
Look like Churchyards, and we may aptly say,
Is a fit Emblem for the latter Day;
Where, with their naked arms stretched to the Clouds,
They rise again with neither Shirts, nor Shrouds;
The Beds are Dust, Worms are the Lice and Fleas,
The dreadful Summons, are the Jailors Keys;
The Bail-dock Purgatory, and Guild Hall
A Judgment Seat, that salves, or ruins all:
All humors in this vacuum are hurled,
To make it an Epitome oth' World.
It Is in it self (though poor) a Corporation;
For the sad Commonwealths men (by gradation)
Do clime to Offices, and, with equal Quarter,
Divide their Power, as if the City Charter
Were made their Fundamental; Here they Marry
Remove their Lodgings, carry, and miscarry,
Buy, sell, (nor do they want the Worlds Exactions)
Hold Controversies, several Sects, and Factions:
Lend Money upon Pawns, they fight, and stab,
Are cured, pay Surgeons, swear, dice, drink, and drab;
Dance, sing, write Books, in Latin, Spanish, French;
Study the Laws, in Chanc'ry, Upper Bench,
And Common Pleas; whilst the Mechanic Blades,
Alter, make, mend, according to their Trades;
Some men have made this place a Counter-charm,
That may protect them from a greater harm;
But (in a Word) all men shall find (that try)
It Is any thing that tends to Misery.
A Rash Man.
IS like a Ship mis-guided on a Shelf:
Un-naturally Out-lawed by Himself;
He Is Reason's Renegado; one with whom
The word Consider, is too troublesome:
That does obey his Passion and Affection;
Whose Cogitation, is the Child of Action;
He Loves, and Hates, but is too quick in Both,
Accounting Contemplation, a cold Sloth:
H^ Does, and then Disputes, he is a Man
Mild as a Brook, Wild as an Ocean:
Fierce as a Lion, Loving as a Lamb;
In whom the least proportion (that a Dram
Conteins) of Choler, shall beget more spoil,
Than Flame and Flax (incorporate with Oil)
Makes in a Magazine, that is obliged
To the Destruction of a Town besieged;
He Is Folly's Fire, and fickle Fortune's Frantic,
Passion's Pet^r, Love's Blast, and Angers Antic:
His Brain is Flint, Heart Steel, his wild Desire
Is Tindar: he that Crosses him, strikes Fire:
With all his Undertakings he goes on,
At the same Minute they are thought upon,
He says, Consideration is a Crime
Fettered with Laziness, it loses Time;
And therefore (like a forward Man) will be
Always before his Opportunity;
But by that kind of Care, he finds the Fate
That coming Early only, makes him Late:
Men of profundity, that dare own Wit,
Know it is two things, to be First, and Fit
In some Employments; He whose sad Condition
Upon the Scaffold, does attend Remission;
May in the Book of his reviving Fate,
Record in Gold, that Time he stayed so late;
Then to be First in some such Enterprise,
Is Ruin, by the Rule of Contraries:
So are a Rash Man's Actions, that refuse
All Counsel, but what Will, and Passion choose:
He thinks that Temperance, and Patience,
Are only Words, that want Intelligence:
And where he sees their pure Effects arise,
He calls it Idleness, and Cowardice:
His Ear is open, as his Hand is quick,
To any Sycophant, that comes to pick
Thanks, for some ill-brought News, which (in his Fury)
He Credits more than ever Judge did Jury:
Another Mad-man's Challenge has the power,
To call him (at a Sacramental hour)
From the high Altar, when the pious Priest
Communicates the holy Eucharist:
With him, no Season is unfit to Fight,
By Day, or Night; Moonshine, or Candlelight;
Delay (he doubts) in such a Case as this,
Concludes him Coward, So indeed He is:
For perfect valor, rightly understood,
Submits not to the Ebbing or the Flood
Of a hot Gall, but wisely dares advance
His towering head, invest with Temperance;
At such a season, when the Deed alone
Shall be both Act and Vindication;
And cannot need that Penitence upon it
The the other has; I would I had not done it,
Pray pardon me, Let my Repentance wash
The thought on it from you, I was much too rash;
I Will make amends; And such tame words as would
Cause a cold Winter in the flowing Blood
Of a high heart; but it is an equal Sentence,
That sudden Rashness should meet swift Repentance:
For, commonly, to him he does out-brave
This Day, to morrow he becomes a Slave:
He is a wild, headstrong, unbroken Colt,
A Wise man's Warning-piece, and the Fools Bolt*
The Coward's only Terror, Natures Bubble;
The Mad man's Disputant, the Mild man's Trouble;
The Drunkard's Ape, the Virgins Overthrow;
The Devil's dearest Friend, and his own Foe.
But, now I think on it, how shall all my Wit
Secure me, should he Read what I have Writ?
I Will ask his Pardon, and I Will vow withal,
When I write next to make him Rash-on-all.
A Corrupt Lawyer.
IS one that lives by Quarrels, a Beguiler
Of Peace, yet would be thought a Reconciler;
One whose best thriving is in troubled Times,
When the World's worst, and People full of Crimes;
By his Art, men may fight at any distance;
Envy and Malice, are his chief Assistants:
He does little in God's Name, for he brings
All Actions that be penal, in the Kings:
As in his Declaration (Toll Lege)
You Will find it writ, Qui tam pro Domino Rege:
Informers are his Clients, whose Possessions,
Are a large Record of the Laws Transgressions:
He is a Man of furious Resolution,
That aims to bring all things to Execution,
And (by bad Circumstance) it happens so
That the Defendant and the Plaintiff too
Were better be at Tiburn, then extend
Their Purses to Expenses, without End:
For Lawyers (like the Irons that support
Consuming Firebrarnds) do, with thrifty sport,
Uphold their Clients, till Demurrs and Flashes
Have burned and buried them, in their own Ashes:
Whose Ruin is the hapless Introduction,
To one man's Wealth, and twenty men's Destruction:
Not much unlike the Butlers Box, which takes
Small parcels, till it carry both the Stakes:
Or AEsop's filly Warriers, whose fierce Fight,
Betrayed them to the Rapine of a Kite:
So shall you see two Streams strongly contemn
Each other, till one Ocean swallow them.
Such Irons, Boxes, Kites, and Oceans, are
Those whom I aim at, in this Character.
Yet somewhat in him merits Approbation,
He does not much incline to Innovation;
Or any thing which toils the Apprehension,
With the AEnigma of a new Invention:
But (very Orthodoxly) is content,
That all things shall be done by President:
He Is one to whom no action comes amiss,
But what appears in Forma pauperis.
And those he looks upon with more vexations,
Then Usurers when they are to pay Taxations;
Or those rich Jews, when they enforced are
By the Great Turk, to set forth men of War
At their own charge* No just Cause seems so sweet,
As what supports it self on Silver feet:
Religion is a Term he will think upon,
IN the Country, when all other Terms are done.
For you must note, when first he took Degree,
That he sued Conscience to an Outlary:
But I believe, 'twill strike him in some terror,
At last Retorn; to see Her writs of Error:
When all his subtleties shall be expressed,
And censured by that Jury in his breast:
When the Infernal prison shall appear
A little worse than Hell at Westminster:
But these are Phansies, that can raise no Passion
In Men incapable of Contemplation:
Why should his Rumination be hurled
At the vain Fictions of another World?
Is there a Court which can return Denials,
To Him, that has endured so many Trials,
Judgments, and Executions, as would make
The very Fabric of a County shake?
No, no, go on, and let the Country know,
What it is to Quarrel, or (what is worse) to go
To Law; and, most especially, when He
That is their Advocat's their Enemy:
Like those destructive Aides, which (undesir'd)
Offer Assistance, when a House is fired,
And, at the sad Conclusion of the same,
Return a worse Consumption, than the Flame:
Not that I think the Law is so, but grieve
I have so great a Reason to believe,
Did not Law bound us, we should prove the worst
Nation, that ever the Almighty cursed:
So self-destructive, and so barbarous,
That even Heathens, would be Saints, to us:
Therefore my Heart shall ever yield applause
(Next unto my Religion) to the Laws.
A Noble Spirit.
IS Man in his Sublimity, whom Fate
Can not subject unto a sordid state:
Whom Poverty (with all her needy Train)
Incites not to the slavery of Gain;
Whose Freedom is that Magna Charta, which
Admits no Diminution, though the Rich
Revenue of both Indies, did conclude
To buy the Purchase; One, whose Nobly rude
Unpolished Bravery, contains a Jem,
Would dignifie the greatest Diadem;
In whom that Intellectual Essence springs,
Which glorifies the Sovereignty of Kings:
Whose radiant Reason, has dispersed all Passion*
To give his Actions free Illumination;
He lends Life unto Honor, and his Name
Fixes a Title on the Crest of Fame:
His Looks speak Pride, but could you know the Dress,
He wears within, his Mind shows nothing less;
His Garb (indeed) is stately, and he can
Sooner kiss Death, than cringe to a Great man,
Flatter a Prince, or be induced to go
Against his Conscience, 'cause the World does so:
He scorns to strike his Top-sail to the vain
Pride of that Man, who will not vail again:
Though Blood, Riches, and Dignity accord,
To grace him with the title of a Lord:
And nothing more provokes his discontent,
Then to abridge him a due Complement:
Therefore he meets all men with due Respect,
And is more sensible of a Neglect,
Then some of Blows, and does (alike) despise,
Dissimulations and Calumnies:
No man is more the object of his Hate,
Then He that would his Worth extenuate.
Nor is there any Man has power to cause,
A self-opinion in him, with Applause;
So justly balanced, that the even Beam,
Enclines not to admit of an Extreme:
He is a man that lies so truly square,
Fortune is not his Mistress, nor his Fear:
The glory of her Glance does not delight him*
Nor can the fury of her Frown affright him:
As no man is more capable then he,
In apprehension of an Injury;
So is it rare to find a disposition,
Of such propenfitie unto Remission:
His Love is fineless, but his fickle Hate,
A Moments time may amply terminate.
Although he be most just in the exaction,
(After a wrong received) of Satisfaction:
Which is so well contrived, he seems to take
It more for Justice, then for Angers sake:
His tyranny is exercised upon,
None but himself, for if a wrong be done,
By him, unto another, he will nere
Contentedly, forgive the Injurer;
But with incessant Murmur, and Vexation,
Deny himself all hope of Expiation:
He Is one shall sooner in a mortal strife
Expire, than poorly be obliged for Life:
Not that he would not live, but hates to be
So much engaged unto his Enemy;
Curiously fearing, that it should be said,
He wears a Life, his Fate had forfeited:
If (in the progress of his Days) he find,
The Nation's favor gratefully inclined,
By adding Honor to his Souls enjoyment,
He sets a Luster upon all Employment;
Whose Honorable Actions may exhort
The growing Gallantry of Camp and Court:
And after Ages shall record his Story,
As one that lived and dyed his Countries Glory.
A Mountebanck.
IS a Stage higher than a Quack, a Thing
Nursed by Corruption, to whom the Spring,
And Autum, prove a Harvest, He is One
That is of All, or No Religion:
His Life is hellish, for he always gains
His Sustenance upon the Peoples Pains;
His Stage is built on Barrel heads, but he
Is best supported by Infirmity;
His new-built Shop looks like an Antic School,
Where He, his Wife, a Madman, and a Fool,
Epitomize the world; which is the Cause,
His vain Spectators give him such Applause:
His Origin of living did consist,
Much on the Charcoal of an Alchymist:
Then served a Doctor, till his skill did crawl,
Up to the judgment of a Urinal:
After he Practiced, but his Art did lie,
Most commonly, hid Piss-prophesie:
Which happened as infellible as Fate,
Assisted by a good Confederate.
The Midwives, and the Nurses of the Town,
Were his Decoys, and shared, till all was known;
Then he removed himself, and did repair,
(For health) unto some more infectious Air;
For he is one of such a gross Extraction,
That nothing keeps him Sound, but Putrefaction:
There his Experiments begins on Rats,
Practices poisons upon Dogs and Cats;
(They are his Patients) Knowledge must be won,
Though it depend upon Destruction:
Then his large Bills, in Text advanced high,
(For an obstruction to all Passers by)
He plants in public Places: where he pleases,
To undertake the Cure of All Diseases:
When all that judgment values not a straw,
But what lies in Lues Venerea:
Or some such Paris-practice, which implores,
The vile assistance of unwholsom Whores:
And all the worth, his vacant Skull affords,
Is but a studied Catalogue of Words.
Virulent Stranguries, intestine Tumors,
Hypochondriacus, Malignant Humors;
Sordid and sanious Ulcers, Phlegmon, Fluxions,
Hepatick Inflammations, and Obstructions:
Hydropick Swellings, Fractions, Dislocations,
Gangrena, Gangleon, with all Vexations.
And then a more then mortal Patience tames,
With the impertinence of Authors Names:
And divine AEsculapius, Cornelius,
Undoubted Dioscorides, Farnelius;
Empedocles, Galen, Hipocrates,
Wise Theophrastus, and Democrates:
Albertus Magnus, Great Archigines,
Besides a hundred more; which he does please
To coin himself, of stranger obstruse stuff,
Lest his weak brain should not be bad enough,
Who is his Patient; and may justly fear,
The worst Diseases enter at his Ear.
Come to his Chamber, and his Library,
Looks like the Study of some Antiquary:
Adorned with the sour sight of Sceletons,
Embalmed Limbs, strange Beasts, and pendant Bones;
With tedious Lectures on them, that would quite
Destroy the patience of an Anchorite:
His Folio Books, like some great Conjurers,
Are madly stained with Rubric Characters:
Of no Intelligence, unless they be,
The Hieroglyphics of his Ecstasy:
Yet these phantastique toys, serve to advance
His Name, where Money is, and Ignorance:
When in his Chests, good store of Coin is hurld,
He gains a Pattent to surround the World.
With no less Mischief, although masked with Mirth,
Then Satan, when he compassed the Earth.
But lest I should by some misconstru'd be,
That I am Lady Physics Enemy;
My just request is, that I may refer,
Them to the title of My Character;
My Pen shall never fix a stain upon Her,
For it is an Art, I infinitely honor.
A Whore.
THat Cradle-Curs'd Impostor, is a Whore;
Which Bad men most desire yet most Abhor:
Prized in the heat of blood, at costly rate;
A Dish they feed on, surfeit, and then hate:
Who traffiques for Diseases, spends her Youth,
In luckless Riot, void of Care, and Truth:
That sels her souls Inheritance, to win
An Heritage in death, dear bought with sin:
If she arrive at Age, her best reward,
Is poor, old, scorned, and begs without regard:
She Is the unhappiest Workman-ship of Nature,
The foulest Fiend, hid in the fairest Creature:
Damnation cut in Crystal, heaps of Flowers,
Scattered upon a Viper, which devours,
The gathering hand; A subtle, shining, White
Path, to the Palace of Eternal Night:
Stars in deep Waters, which when vain men think
They shall embrace; in the soft Ruin, sink.
A Shrine-like-shewing Sepulcher, which owns
Naught but the primitive dust of putrid bones:
The Devils fair Decoy, the True-love Cheater,
Poisoned Perfumes, Suckets that rot the Eater;
Shipwracks in calmest weather; Bells that have
But one Tune to the Bride-bed, and the Grave:
They are cold Scyth^^n Winters, that appear,
So full of barrenness, as if the Year,
Had forfeited the Spring, and would degrade,
The World of that, for which it first was made:
Your Stately, Rich, and Lord-beloved Whores,
Are Treasuries which vilde Extortion stores,
And studious Riot empties; for what they,
Purloin from One, some Other makes away.
Philosophers in vain you seek to find,
Out Local Hell, in the vast Air, the Wind,
Or Center of the Earth; for ( sans dispute)
It Is in the bofom of a Prostitute:
Like Hell, they act destruction unto Man,
No Nation scapes: the French, the Italian,
The lofty Spaniard, and the lusty Dutch,
From him, whose Age depends upon a Crutch,
To the unbearded Youth, that never put on,
The long-wish'd Jubilee of Twenty one;
Men of all Qualities are thus betrayed,
They Are worse than Tributes in th'Low-Countries paid:
Exactions upon all sorts of Provision,
Meat, drink, sleep, clothes, nay even on man's perdition,
They do (like Vultures) on Ill-livers gnaw,
And are those brittle Ev'dences of Law;
(Examined by some overcurious Pate)
Which forfeit all a wretched Man's estate,
For leaving out one syllable: They be
Worse then dead bodies from the fatal Tree,
Begged by Chirurgions, and wrought upon,
To teach a man (by such dissection)
Wherein he is imperfect; She is worse,
Then all Ingredients made into a Curse.
And (though she merit it) there is nothing more
Afflicts her, then the hateful Name of Whore:
Which represents the horror of her shame,
To prosess that, which she is afraid to Name:
The careless Customs of her cursed offense,
Expel the thought of Prayer, or Penitence:
Her tempting Eyes are most unhallowed Lamps,
And, like false Coin, which, whosoe'r first stamps;
Though the Contriver subtly may leave it,
Shall bring in Question all men that receive it.
Such is a Whore, whom Pride, and Lust deforms,
First rots, then dies a poison, to the Worms.
A Virtuous Wife.
IS, to her Husband, all we can call good,
That has affinity with Flesh and Blood:
Her Chaster thoughts are so Divinely swayd,
Although a Mother, she is a married Maid:
In that her Conversation does dispense
It self no further then safe Innocence
May wisely warrant, She Is an Enchiridion,
To her kind Consort, filled with true Religion:
Which is her highest Learning, and the Stone
Laid to support her Life's foundation:
Her Passions are so regularly sweet,
That his Distempers, and her Mildness, meet
Like Flint and Feathers; for she truly knows,
From vain Resistance, vile Disunion grows:
She Is of her Husband's Counsel, though respect
Instruct her to Advise, more than Direct;
And of his Privacies so (wisely) wary,
She may be styled his Hearts best Secretary:
They are so much One, that whatsoever Fate
Bestows on Him, She does participate;
His Sorrow, is her Sadness, and his Mirth,
(Occultly) does beget a blooming Birth
Of Joys in Her; And, as I have been shown,
Two Needles touched with one Magnetique Stone,
And fixed upon their Centers, though an Ocean;
Divide them, yet, One touched, gives The Other motion:
So is it with this loyal Pair of Creatures,
No Distance makes Antipathy of Natures:
She is Man's better Genius, and it is
(Almost) impossible, that any Bliss
Should be a stranger to him, whilst her Care
Devotes her humbled Heart, and Knee, in Prayer
For his Prosperity, whose Hands and Eyes,
Are Sin and Sorrow's sincere Sacrifice.
Her temperate Speech is so divinely calm,
And from her Ruby portals, spring a Balm
So precious, and invaluably Pure
That Love makes every Kiss become a Cure:
She Is never Jealous, 'cause she does not know
By what strange means it is planted, or does Grow:
Yet (rightly) thinks they cannot be without
The Guilt of Soul, who deal too much in Doubt;
And therefore (piously) does well prevent
The Plague of both, by being Innocent.
Her Angel-Issue that about her Knee
Make her appear (as she is) true Charity;
Beget a Joy in her transcend Expressings,
And prove (what they were Meant) the Parents blessings
At whose Conception she did well agree
His Name should rather win priority
Than levity of Blood, scorning the shame,
Which the Act shares, should nullify the Fame
Of Generation, and that they should be
Only the Fruits of Geniality:
Her own Example, is a powerful guiding
Unto her Servants, that prevents all Chiding*
Or such domestique Noise, as makes the Act
Of Dehortation, worser than the Fact:
As I have heard an in-harmonious Chime
Of Words, convert the Counsel, to the Crime:
There is such Language in her Looks, her Eye
(Without a Voice) directs a Remedy;
Which is not so austere, but you may spy
Love mixed with Power, Meekness with Majesty:
Her Care is in her House, where she confines
Her Thoughts, as well as Feet, and much inclines
To Uniformity, for you shall find
The Order of her Household, like her Mind;
and so her Dress, in which, she does comply,
That cheapest Fitness, is best Bravery:
She is the Old man's Crutch, the Poor man's Treasure;
The Rash man's Remedy, the Young man's Pleasure*
The Wise man's Jewel, Noble man's Renown;
The Peasant's Rest, the King's imperial Crown;
The Sick man's Salvatory, Soldier's Fort;
The Merchant's Providence, the Pilot's Port;
Which, if he lose, He soon shall understand,
That his worst Shipwreck was upon the Land:
But if Grim Death, his Lamp of Life shall smother
He does but change one Heaven for Another.
FINIS.
