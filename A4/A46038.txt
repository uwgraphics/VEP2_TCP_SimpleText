CR HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE

royal blazon or coat of arms
BY THE SVPREAME COUNCIL OF THE CONFEDERAT CATHOLIC OF IRELAND.
(...) cannot be expressed by what subtle practices such, as for their own
ambitious ends, do for (...) ^ctions in the government, do endeavor to
obstruct all the ways, by which the blessing of a settl^^ (...) ^^e protection
of the Crown of England, and his Majesty's authority may be introduced, It was
r(...) (...) ^o have slaundered our proceedings so far, as by word and
writing, to seek to persuade the C(...) (...) ^^^^^licks, that we labor to
resussitat the late rejected ^^^ce, and that in order thereunto, we had (...)
^^ati(...) ^ith the Lord Barron of Inchiquin, B^^ (...)ng, that neither by the
unjust cen(...) (...) (...)ance thereof, nor the power of that Army, which they
had inveigled to stand in opposition (...) our autho(...) they could prevail
against the Justice of our cause, they do now fill all corners of the
King^ome, with (...) brute of a Peace less aduantagious to the Nation, then the
former, and more prejudicial to ^^e Catholic ^^^igion, said to be concluded
by some of our Agents in France, which the Marquess of Ormond (^s they say) ^o
enforce upon the Kingdom, And though we find that so malicious and groundless
reports ^e despised (...) all men, that know the honor and integrity of our
Agents, and the lymitts which, by their I^structions, (...) set unto them,
yet to vndeceiue all men that have not passions too violent, to heap more
calamities (...) this afflicted Nation, We do again repeat that part of
our former Declaration of the two and twentyeth of ^ay last, And do by these
protest again, and publicly declare, that neither we, nor any other by ou^
advice or as^^^^^nce, shall directly or indirectly, bring in any Peace, but
that which by the orders of the last Assembly was directed and ^^mitted to the
Agents sent for Rome, France, and Spain, to be by them obtained, until the
General Assembly of the ^onfederat Catholics, shall otherwise determine, and
that we will oppose our selves, against all and every person who shall
^^deavour, in any sort whatsoever, to introduce any other Peace then such, as
our said Commissioners have in charge, from (...) Confederat Catholics to
solicit for them, or such as the said Assembly shall Judge fit to be embraced.
And whereas a (...) calumny is raised against us, by the suggestions of some
ill disposed persons, who endeavor to persuade (...) ^^^ple, that we are not
willing a right understanding should be mediated between us, and the Lord
Nuncio, (...) (...)fore to meet such calumny, and the evil construction may
be made of our intentions, Do declar^ (...) shall not give any oposition
thereunto, but rather esteem any person of quality, a favorer of the
(...)que cause, and a well wisher of the Union of the Kingdom, that shall
[without prejudice of our Appeal or (...) ^^^^ch of our public faith, given
for maintaining the late concluded Cessation] endeavor to remove the (...)
(...)ousies between us, and his Lordsipp, and shall be reddy at all times, to
afford the said part all befitting (...) ^ountenance and favor; Not intending
in the mean time to omit enforming the people of the truth of for^er
proceedings, to the'nd noe sinister suggestions may withdraw them from their
obedience to our autho^^^y.

Given at the Castle of Kilkenny the seventh day of July Anno Dom. 1648. and
in the four and twentyeth ^eare of the Reign of our sovereign Lord CHARLES by
the grace of God King of great Britain, France, and Ireland. Mountgarett,
Dounboyn, Lucas Dillon, Rob: Lynch, Richard Bellings, Gerald Fenell, Robert
