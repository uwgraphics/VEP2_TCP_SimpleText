A WHIPP For the Animadverter In Return to his Second LIBELL.

By R. L'S.

LONDON: Printed for Henry Brom, at the Gun in Ivy-lane. February the 12th,
1662.

An Answer to a Libel, etc.
I Had no sooner corrected One Libell, against the Bishop of Worcester, but out
bolts another against L'S., of the same Stamp, and Force, and Calculated for
the same Meridian. What, Wh^, or Where the Author is, I neither Care nor
Enquire; for meth^nks Hunting after Libellers, is something like Gunning at
Didappers; a man's in danger to Lo^se his Sho^t; or, if he Hitts, it is but a
Nasty Quarry.

Hark ye my Masters of the Consistory; You are the Men must do Me Right;
These Fellows are but Your Bag-Pipes; You Blow, and They Bawl: But if I turn
not up your Reverences, as fair, as ever This Whipster's Honorable Friend] did
his Boys at Westminster, let the world say I have no skill in untrussing an
Apostate.

In short; the Spirit of Untruth and Scandal is sent abroad from among you; and
he calls himself D. E. (the Two first Letters of his Fathers Name, Jeh. 8. 44.)

In the First Page, the Phantome appears in the Form of a Philosopher: with
This Character of L' S. [A Person so lost to all Good Breeding, of so
forfeited, so undone a Reputation, ^n point of mere Morality, etc.]

Gentlemen, you have been now Twenty Years at This sport of Libelling: The
King, the Queen, the Royal Family, the Bishops; all that were L^yal, of the
Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty, have been be^patter'd by those Scribblers,
and Lecturers, which you h^ve kept in Pens^^^, e^pressly to de^^me them The
Church the State; the Law, the Gospel; No^^ing so Sacred as to escape you. ( I
speak only to Those that have Revolted f^rce the Pardon.) Have ye not delivered
the Doctrine of Devils, for the Inspirations of the Holy Ghost^^ Vouching
Texts for Perjury, and Rapine; Impul^e for Treason; Cutting your Sovereign in
your Prayers? in the same Act; Seducing the People^ A^^ronting the King,
Dis^c^o^ring the Pulpit, P^^phaning the Or^inance, and Blaspheming G^d himself.

This is not Passion Gentlemen, but Truth upon Record; and Printed by
Stati^ners of your (...) Appointment, in Perp^tuam rei Memoriam. Your Names I
spare; For I wish rather your Conversion, then your Shame: my D^ift being only
to show that your T^ngues are no Slander.

In the next Page, your Agent is a little unsavory, and I advise the Reader to
make ^^e ^f a P^mander. He compares L' S. to [a H^gg playing upon the Organs.]
I p^ay'e, had not this Wi^t ^ Hand in your Centuries of Scandalous Ministers?
Look a Line further, and There you are to Phansy him, [ A Scavenger washing a
Bishops Surplice] How naturally the Sloven goes from the H^gg, to the
Sir-Reverence! with License, Gentlemen, what i^ a man should now Phansy your
^ubstitute^ to be some Gr^^m of the Sto^l to a Holy Sister? But soberly, To
cleanse his Mouth would be the fe^lest part of a Scavengers Employment.

Say now ye Br^thren of the Text: Have ye a Scripture-Rule for This Language?
We must do every thing in Mode and Figure; according to the P^ecept. [ Le^
every thing be done to Edification], says the Apostle; [Bless them that Curse
yee], says our Blessed Savior. Stick to your ^^n Rule then, and Observe the
Precept; Unles^e you will deal with the Law of God, as ye have done with the
Law of the Land: Muzzle it with a Salvo, and only Practice Christianity, so far
as it consists with Presbytery.

Not to be tedious, what your Emissary has expanded, take in Little; (that is,
the Flowers of his Rhetorique.) [A Morrice-Dancer, -- A Fiddler; -- A Common
Barreter; A Mercenary Songster; -- A Whiffling Thi^so^l'd Adversary, -- A Puny
Author, A Sack-Drinker; (beshrew me, I like the Liquor but [it goes in, Sack
(he says) and c^m^s out Water.] This, he could never have known, without the
help of a Devil.

Truly Gentlemen, (to the point of M^sique) he is a little guilty of some skill
in S^^g; and not very Mercenary neither, to a Friend; he will do your Bu^inesse
however, when you please, by the way of a Madrigall, and never put ye to pay
the Fiddler. Try him, and if he does not set ye such a suit of Hymns to your
unfumish'd Form of Public Worship, the very Ring of them shall shake the
Fundamentals of a Christ-Church (...), and make the Brethren of your
Milk-street Conventicle, Gape wor^e, and wider, then Michael Angelo's
Reprobates, in his Day of Judgment, say I Am no Conjure^. I speak with Reverence
to the Good; and Charity to the Weak; But to hear Faction delivered for
Conscience; to see People p^yson'd in the Church, and Princes Dethroned in the
Pulpit; Who, that loves either God, his Prince, or Country, has not a Horreur
for it? Further;

Your Angry mantels the World that L'S. is [ One that has been a Fiddler in all
Governments, and would have been a Fiddler in the worst of them; For which and
(says he) He knows how may Pitiful Legs and Faces he made^ to scrape
Acquaintance with the Tyrant Ol^^er.]

In earnest, This Report might do him a great deal of Hurt, but that I trust,
he has some Friends at Court, will have a C^re that nothing shall do him any
Good. Pray'e will you speak Gentlemen; You, have a great many of you been of
All sides; did any of you, ever know him of any More then One? M^. -- did you
ever see him make the Pitiful Legs, and Faces, (he talks of) to that [
Prudent, Pi^us, and Faithful Governor the Lord Protectour] Mr. -- Don't you
Remember that [ the Providence of God did as much appear in the removing of
others from, and investing their Honors with the Government of th^^ Nation, as
ever they appeared in the ^^king awa^, or bestowing of any Government in any
History of any Age of the World?] did You ever take notice of any such thing?
Mr. -- You Inaugurated the Serene Oliver, and Blessed the Scepter in the h^nds
of his Princely Successor: What say You to the World? Or did Sir John
Presbyter ever smell out any such matter in the Protectour's Water? We could
appeal further, but More were too Much, A Sober Line or Two now ((...) y L
beller apart).

I know the^e Tales are not Believed; yet they are entertained, in Whispers,
and pointed at, in little Observations; and so One Scandal is grounded upon
another: more ^o the disadvantage of my Fortune, then the dis^rder of my
Thoughts. If I am Guilty, why am I not Hanged? If I am Innocent, why am I
Slandered? In fine, so innocent I am that I affirm; wh^t Person soever, (the
Royal Blood excepted) endeavors to possess his Majesty I am other, does in all
Likelihood purpose to Betray him, and his own Soul gainsayes his Tongue.
Enough of This, now to the little Fellow again.

He says, [ That many Sober Persons (was thought it very fit that the Bishop
should be a little humbled) are much satisfied by it, but the Bishop himself so
far concerned, that he has employed one L' S. to answer it.]

A very pretty kind of Colloquy, betwixt D. and E. Both which I dare say, would
be extremely Satisfied, to see the Bishop humbled; yes, humbled by the Head, as
his good Friends humbled the Earl of Strafford; the Bishop of Canturbury next;
and at last the King. And what, when they had humbled These; and with These,
Monarchy, and Episcopacy, into a base and inextricable Confusion: what did they
raise, to fill those Vacancies, but Dunghill Vapors; that were scarce sooner
up, then down again, in Plagues, or storms upon the People? I hope any
Countrymen have not forgot the Fruits of their last Humbling of the Bishops.
In truth, a Conflict, had the Bishop replied, might have made him ashamed; but
barely to approve himself; confute a Schismatique, and cast out an Intruder
from a Sequestered Living, was for his Honor.

Whereas he says, that the Bishop employed one L'S. to answer the
Animadverter, That same L' S. did, to my Knowledge, declare, upon the first
light of the Bishops Letter, that it was below the Dignity of a Pralate to Cope
with a Libeller, and that if any man replied, he would undertake the next.

The Innocent, in the Second Page, Plays with the Bishops [Dudgeon phrase of
This is the Truth, the whole Truth, and n^thing but the Truth, etc.] The man is
here to be excused upon several accounts. First as no Judge of a Good Style, or
el^e he Counterfeits, for His Jaggs like a Saw. Next; as a Stranger to the Law,
he would not else have taken the Common form of an Oath for the Bishops Phrase.

In his fourth Page, he Challenges the Bishop and the world to make good six
Positions which he pretends Asserted by the Bishop, and for plain dealing sake,
we will set them down as the Animal delivers them.

Pos. 1. That Monarchy cannot consist without Episcopacy. Pos. 2. That the
Bishop of Worcester is the Sole and Immediate Pastor of all the Congregations
in his Diocese. Pos. 3. That it is unlawful for any, though Ordained, to preach
in the Bishop of Worcesters Diocese, without his License. Pos. 4. That it is
Lawful in the Worship of God to enjoin a small thing under a great Penalty.
Pos. 5. That the Church has Power to ex^^t Confession and Recantation, for
these Crimes which the State has pardoned. Pos. 6. That the Presbyterians are
All Seditious.
The Two first are no more the Bishops Positions, then the Animadverter is his
Friend, ( Vide my Answer to his Animadversions, Page 5. and 7. and P. 13.) the
Rest are sufficiently justified. The Third in Page 17. The Fourth, Page 30. The
Fifth, Page 22, 23. The Sixth, Page 11, 12.

You the Heads and Patrons of the Revolt, by what Name or Title soever
Dignified, or Distinguished; take notice that I here dismiss your small
officer: and now, a Cold, and Serious word Singly, to Your Selves.

I am not ^tte^ly a Stranger to your Consultations, and Cabalts; from whence I
am well Informed, that you have been Hammering at an Answer to me: but finding
that the Cause will hardly beat it, you are a little doubtful whether That or a
Libell. Proceed: and when ye shall have engaged the nameless Issue of some
Carted Strumpet to forge the Scandal; Then shall I Thank ye, Gentlemen, for
using me no worse, then ye have done Your King, and all his friends before me.

When You have drawn your Goodly Piece, we will try our skill in Printing too:
but I assure ye, Mine shall be done from the Life, Yours will be but a Fancy.

Ten^e est Mendacium, perlucet, s^ diligenter inspexeris. Sen. Ep.

THE END.
