The Humble Petition of the Citizens of London, Intended to be Presented to the
Right Honorable, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, in Common Council
Assembled.
SHOWS,
THat whilst They were under the Superintendancy of a Vigilant and Careful
Supreme Authority, They could spend Their time in Their several Callings,
without either troubling this Honorable Court, or themselves with Matters of
State; But Their Natural Affection to Their Native Country, together with Their
Interest in this Great City, moving Them, and the Universal decay of Trade
giving Them too much leisure, They cannot in this day of Calamity be silent,
without rendering themselves Insensible and Guilty; And therefore They Humbly
crave leave to Represent unto this Honorable Court,

That ever since the first Interruption of Government, not only this City, but
the whole Nation has been in a languishing Condition, as to Their Stock and
Trade.

That the Incomparable Honor and Renown which this Commonwealth was arrived
at in the World (being an admiration and terror to Their Neighbors round
about Them) is by these late Years disturbance of Government, laid in the dust,
and Our Nation in great danger of being rendered a Scorn, Reproach, and Prey to
Foreigners.

That as Our Parliaments have always been the Peoples safety and security, so
it could not but rejoice Our Hearts, to have the Long Parliament restored to
the discharge of the remaining part of Their Trust, that being the only Power
who can derive Legal Authority of Parliaments to Posterity, put an end of
Usurpation, and lay the Foundation of Successive Parliaments; And the Army by
Their Declaration owning Them to be the Eminent Assertors of the True Good Old
Cause, having a special Presence of GOD with Them, and Signally Blessed in the
Work.

That through the present varieties of Changes, We are Reduced under the only
Legal Administration of Your Lordship, and this Honorable Court.

That whereas GOD's Presence and Blessing has always gone along with this
Nation, whilst They have kept Faith with Their Governors, and His displeasure
sufficiently manifested when They have done otherwise: That the Peace and Quiet
of this Nation depends upon such Foundations as may not be objected against for
Usurpation, and may leave as few dormant Titles as may be, for any discontented
and unquiet Parties to Head themselves under: That the Nations Security, under
GOD, is in Parliament; and that at present for want thereof, We of this Nation,
and in particular, this City, are under the just Administration of Your
Lordship, and this Honorable Court, the City being the Bul-wark of the Nation.

Therefore We most Humbly Pray;That Your Lordship and this Honorable Court
would effectually endeavor the Restoration of the Parliament, to the Exercise
of their Lawful Authority, That thereby We and Posterity may timely have Lawful
Foundation of Government laid in Successive Parliaments; And that in the
Interim, Your Lordship and this Honorable Court would take speedy Care of the
Peace, Quiet, and Safety of this Great City, by the Hands of Persons of
Interest, and known Integrity, for the preventing all dangerous Meetings,
Insurrections, and Tumults: And We shall assist You with Our Lives, Interests,
and Fortunes.
