Oxford, Printed by H. Hall, Printer to the University, for Thomas Robinson.
1660.

To the young Student in Divinity,
SOme may be offended at the very Title of this, and my former Bock; for
Scholastical Divinity has, (...) since the Reformation, been so generally
declaimed against, as that most have been deterred from so much as booking into
it. How much this excess has prejudiced the Protestant Cause, I could easily,
and at large demonstrate from our Controversal Writers: for of them, none have
been so considerable, and formidable unto the Adversary, as those that have
been well versed in the Schoolmen: Others, that are utter strangers unto them,
though otherwise of great note and learning, being (...) and anon in the dark
and at a loss. But I would not be mistaken; when I plead for a sober, moderate,
and (...) use of Schoolmen, I make no Apology for their errors and fopperies;
their vain and (...) impious curiosities, no more then the Israelites approved
of the Tyranny and (...) of the Philistines, when they went down unto them, to
sharpen at their forges every man his share, and his coulter, and his ax, and
his mattock, 1 Samuel 13. 20 I cannot but confess, that he who studieth them must
take a great deal of pains, to search for a little gold in a great heap of
dross, to dig for a few Jewels in a vast dunghill: But these (...) are so
precious, as that they will abundantly (...) thy greatest diligence; (...) thy
greatest diligence will be vain, and to little purpose, if thou rush (...) the
study of them unpreparedly, and if thou read them (...). And (...) for the
study of them, I reckon, First, all (...) that have not made a severe progress
in Philosophical Learning; for without this they will be unintelligible, and
serve rather to (...) and amaze, then to give any light and direction:
Secondly, Those that are not well (...) in those points that are controverted
(...) Protestants and Papists, for without a competent insight into these, what
(...) can (...) had against their Heterodoxies? as they must be come unto with
(...), so must they he read with abundance of caution: Prove all things, and
hold (...) that only which is good, 1 (...). 5. 21. Thou must pass a very
(...), (...), and impartial examination of, and judgment upon the several
Sects and Factions of them, Thomists and Scotists; Nominals, and Reals, and not
resign up thy reason unto any one party of them: for this will (...) the study
of Schoolmen, a mere vassalage of thy understanding. (...) not therefore every
spirit (...) (...): But try the spirits, whether they be of God, 1 John 4. 1.
For (...) so pertinaciously and obstinately (...) unto their respective
Ringleaders, in all their (...) and expr (...) whatsoever; as the Dominicans
to Thomas, the Franciscans to Scotus, the Nominals to Ocham; as that without
such trial, they will more frequently mis-guid, then inform (...). Unto this
prudent liberty, thou must add, in the next place, a Christian humility,
captivating thy reason unto the (...) of faith, and submitting all subtilties
unto the perfect and infallible rule of Scripture. (...) (...) find the
Schoolmen to swerve from this, presuming to be wise, (...) that which is
written, thou may without scruple (...) them. These rules being observed,
Schoolmen will not be found to be so (...) and dangerous Authors, as they have
been represented; nor Scholastical Divinity to have such a repugnancy with
Practical, as has been imagined. To manifest this, has been (...) end of
these my undertakings; and if my (...) herein meet with success, and a (...)
reception, it may encourage me to attempt a (...) of a higher nature, The
purging of the Schoolmen from their dross, and the selecting out of them their
rarities and choicest notions. I cannot expect to live so long, as to proceed
far herein: But a beginning may invite some of both our Universities to pursue
and carry on the design, who have better accommodations for such a work, then a
Country (...) can have: That God would stir up the hearts of some of them
hereunto, is the hope, and will be the (...) of him, that is

Thine in the work of the Lord, HENRY JEANES.

A TABLE of the Contents of the Treatises in this BOOK.
A TREATISE concerning the indifferency of humane actions.
Page NOn-Conformists unjustly charged with denial of things indifferent. 1, 2.
Some distinctions premised concerning the actions of man; they are either
indeliberate, or deliberate. ib. (...) again are to be considered two manner of
ways. 1. In the general, actu signato. 2 2. In the singulars and individuals,
actu exercito. ib. In a second place it is inquired what is meant by the
indifferency of actions. 2, 3

For clearing the nature of (...), two Queries propounded.
1. What medium indifferent things are betwixt things morally good and evil;
whether medium (...), or participationis? 3, 4, 5. 2. Whether all indifferent
actions be equally indifferent; where a passage in Dr. Sanderson is at large
(...). 5, 6, 7, 8.

Having (...) (...) things, three conclusions are laid down concerning the
(...) of the actions of man.
Concl. 1. The indeliberate actions of man, etc. are indifferent, not only in
the general, but in their individuals and singulars; because such actions, to
speak (...), are not moral and humane. 8, 9, 10, 11. Page Conclus. 2. There be
diverse deliberate actions, etc. which if they be considered in actu signato, in
the general, secundum speciem, according to the sort or kind, are indifferent,
neither morally good, nor evil. 11

This confirmed

1. By Scripture. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 2. (...) reason, where we have 1. The
Arguments of the Protestants. 16 2. The Arguments of the Schoolmen. 16, 17,
18, 19. An Objection against the indifferency of some (...) actions considered,
in the (...) propounded and answered. 19, 20.

Against this Doctrine of indifferency there be two sailings,
One in the defect. 20, 21. Another in the excess. 21, 22. 2. We may be (...)
unto thankfulness; because God has indulged us Christians a greater (...) of
our liberty about things indifferent, then he ever (...) unto the (...)
Synagogue. 22, 23.

There be two ways of expressing our (...) for the (...) of this our liberty.
1. A slout (...) of it. 23, 24. 2. A due and (...) use of it. 24, 25. To
inform us more fully and particularly what is to be done herein, such (...) are
(...), as we are by the rule of Scripture, to put on the use and exercise of
our Christian liberty in things indifferent. 25

It is to be restrained.

1. By prudence. 25, 26 2. By temperance and sobriety. 26, 27 3. By conscience,
and that both condemning and doubting. 27, 28, 29 4. By religion, by the
religion of a vow, and of an oath. 29, 30, 31 5. By authority. 31, 32, 33 6. By
charity, and that 1. To our selves. 33, 34 2. Unto others, in the case of
scandal. 34, etc. usque ad 46. Conclus. 3. No deliberate actions of men, etc.
if they be considered in actu exercito, in the singular, or particular, as
clothed with circumstances, are indifferent; but all of them are morally
either good or evil. Two limitations of this conclusion. 46, 47

The Conclusion being limited, is made apparent from the end and rule of
deliberate actions.
1. From their end: and what ought to be the end of all deliberate actions of
man, may be evidenced, 1. From their relation unto their original, the (...)
soul. 47, 48 2. From a consideration of them absolutely, as they are in
themselves. 48, 49 For the further enforcement of this reason, some few
Scriptures alleged and opened. 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54. Unto these two
Arguments, a third is added, drawn from the relation betwixt moral goodness,
and idleness. 54 An Objection of Vasquez propounded, and answered. 55, 56

The (...) of our indifferent actions unto sin, affords,
1. Matter of Humiliation for the time past. 57, 58 2. Matter of Caution for
the future. 58, 59, 60, 61

A Treatise concerning abstinence from all appearance of evil, on 1 Thessalonians. 5.
22.
THe Coherence and scope of the words. 67, 68, 69, 70.

Several interpretations of the words examined.
1. Of those that take (...), species, Logically for sort or kind. 68, 69 2.
Of those who restrain the place to matters of Doctrine. 69, 70 The point
deduced from the words, is, that we are to abstain not only from things
intrinsecally sinful; but from all shows and appearances of sin. 71

For limitation of this point, appearance of evil is either in positions or
actions.
1. It Is questioned whether or no we are to abstain from all positions, which
have an appearance of evil or falsehood. For resolution, diverse distinctions
premised. 71

These distinctions premised, it is inquired,
1. How far we are to abstain from assenting to the matter and substance of
Doctrines that carry an appearance of evil unto our selves. 71, 72, 73 2. How
far we are to abstain from assenting to the matter and substance of Doctrines
that carry an appearance of evil generally unto others. 73, 74, 75 3. How far
we are to abstain from publishing of the matter and substance of Doctrines,
that carry generally an appearance of evil unto others. 75, 76, 77 3. We are to
abstain from that appearance of evil in Doctrines, which is in the expressions
used in their proposal. 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 Practical appearance of evil in
manners or matter of practice, is either real or imaginary. 82 1. No actions
that have this real appearance of evil, are upon any pretext whatsoever to be
adventured upon. 82, 83, 84, 85 2. Imaginary appearance of evil is ascribed
thereunto from our own or others misconceits. 1. From our own, and here if a
man be in his own conscience steadfastly, fully, and firmly persuaded, that such
an action is evil and unlawful, which yet in truth is not so, but lawful, what
ought he to do? Here the question concerning the obligation of an erroneous
conscience, is at large stated. 85 etc. (...); adque 93 2. An imaginary
appearance of evil issues from the supposals of others; and that either wilful
or weak ones. 92, 93 1. Wilful, proud, and wicked ones, and here, whether the
censures and scandals of wilful, etc. and pharisaical spirits, are to be
regarded, and how far, is at large resolved. 93, etc. (...), ad 104 2. If this
imaginary appearance of evil flow from the supposal of a weak one, it must be
(...), so it may be without sin, 103, 104 The action in which this appearance
of evil is imagined to be, is either necessary, or indifferent. ibid. 1. If it
be necessary, and commanded, it must not be omitted. 104, 105 Here, in a
digression, is given the sum of what Thomas, and his Interpreters, say upon
this question: An (...) spiritualia sint propter scandalum dimittenda. 105,
usque ad 109 2. If the action in which this appearance of evil, is, be but
indifferent, why then it appears from what the Apostle Paul writes unto the
Romans, cap. 14. and unto the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 8. and cap. 10. That such an
action is to be (...), though the scandal arising thereby be only per
accidens. 109, 110 Of this determination there are laid down diverse exceptions,
or limitations, that are sound and Orthodox; and others, that are (...)
rejected. 110, etc. usque ad 146

The point of abstinence from all appearance of evil, etc. being (...)
limited, is in the next (...) confirmed.
1. By Precepts. 146, 147, 148 2. By Examples. 148, etc. usque ad 154 3. By
Reasons which are drawn, 1. From God. 2. From Satan. 3. (...) our selves. 4.
From our brethren. 1. From God. 1. From our relations unto him. 154, 155 2.
From our danger in (...) of him. 155 2. From Satan, from the consideration, 1.
Of his cruelty and malice against us. ibid. 2. Of his temptations of us. ibid.
1. Of his temptations of us to sin. ibid.

For in them they are,

1. The baits by which he allures us. 156 2. An argument by which he (...) us.
156, 157 3. An encouragement whereby he is heartned to persist in tempting of
us. 157, 158 2. Of his temptations of us to despair, or at least, discomfort
for sin. 158 3. Abstinence from all appearance of evil, is needful, in regard
of our selves, for by them we may incur a double danger. 1. A danger of being
infected with sin. 158, 159, 160 2. A danger of being punished for sin, etc.
161 4. Abstinence from all appearance of evil, is expedient, in regard of our
brethren, to avoid scandal unto them. 1. As it is taken by Thomas and the
Schoolmen. 161, 162 2. As it is used vulgarly and commonly. 162 An Objection
against abstinence from things indifferent, that carry an appearance of evil,
is examined. 162, 163, 164 A general application of the precedent Doctrine,
touching abstinence from all apperance of evil. 164

Where,

1. Are propounded three inducements pressing hereunto: It will be a course, 1.
Safe and secure. 164 2. Comfortable. ibid. 3. Honorable. 165 2. Two Cautions
prescribed, directing how we are to abstain from the appearance of evil; we are
to abstain neither only, nor chiefly therefrom. ibid.

A more particular Application of the precedent Doctrine: Wherein,
1. All men are called upon for abstinence from the appearance, especially of
some evils, of their Master, of their bosom evils. 166 2. Some men, above
others, are especially called upon to decline the appearance of all evils, viz.
all public men, especially Ministers. 166, 167

Of the last and general Judgment, on Romans 2. 16.
THe difference amongst Expositors about the coherence of the words, decided.
173, 174, 175 From the words, occasion taken to handle the common place of the
last and general Judgment, which is explained, confirmed, and applied.

For explication of it, (...) in the Text set forth by its causes, object, and
adjunct.
1. By its causes, principal, and isntrumental. 1. Principal, God shall judge,
where inquired, in what sense the Father judges no man. 175, 176 2.
Instrumental, by Ies s Christ; where, whether he shall judge according to his
manhood, controverted betwixt the Thomists and the (...). 176, 177, 178

2. Next sollows the object of this judgment, and that is two-sold; personal,
and real.
1. Personal, the persons to be judged, men; where a conceit of Gorrans, that
by the naming of men, evil angels are excluded, is examined 2. Real, the
secrets of men, their secret, 1. state, 2. actions. 179 3. Lastly, We have an
adjunct, the circumstance of time, when this judgment shall be, in the day;
where (...), in what sense day is taken. 179, 180

In the next place we have the confirmation, or proof of the prediction of a
future judgment, from the testimony of the Gospel, according to my Gospel,
where three things are inquired.
1. What is meant by Paul's Gospel. 180 2. How Paul terms it his Gospel. 180,
181 3. In what sense God will judge, etc. according to the Gospel. 181, 182,
183 Unto the proof of the Text are added congiuences out of the Schoolmen, for
the last and general judgment. 183, etc. usque ad 191

The Point being confirmed, is next applied And

1. Here is a Use of Terror unto all the wicked. 191, 192, 193 2. Here is a Use
of Consolation unto all true Believers. 193, 194 Particularly against their
sins, (...), and death. 1. Against their sins. 1. The guilt. 194, 195 2. The
being and pollution of them. 195 2. Against their afflictions, of what nature
soever. 195, 196 3. Against their death. 196, 197 3. We may hence be exhorted
to an expectation of, and preparation for this day. 1. Expectation of it. 197,
198, 199, 200 2. Preparation for it. 200, 201

Out of those many duties in which this preparation stands, some few selected,
unto which the Scripture propounds the day of Judgment as a motive: and they
regard either God, our selves, or others.
Those which regard God, are

1. Faith in him. 201, 202, 203 2. Repentance of our sins against him. 203,
etc. usque ad 212 3. Love of him. 212, 213, 214 4. Fear of him. 214, 215, 216
5. Prayer to him. 216, 217

A second sort of duties, unto which the day of Judgment excites, regard our
selves.
1. Watchfulness. 217, 218 2. Sobriety 218, 219 3. Diligence in our particular
callings. 219, 220 4. A due and diligent use, and employment of our talents.
221, etc. usque ad 229

A third sort of duties, to which the day of Judgment is a provokement, regard
others. And they may again be subdivided, they respect either all men, or bad
men, or good men.
1. All men, and they are two. 1. Humility toward them. 229, 230 2. Charity in
our censures of them. 230 231, 232, 233 2. Bad men, and they again are two. 1.
Estrangement from them. 233, 234 2. Patience toward them. 234, usq, (...) 241
3. Good men, both ordinary Christians, and Ministers; and they are two, 1. The
real expressions of a cordial love of them in general. 241, 242, 243 2. All
actions of Christian communion with them in particular. 243, 244, 245, 246

The day of Judgment an inducement unto a due and requisite manner in the
persormance of the forementioned duties, which stands in.
1. Fervency. 246 2. Frequency. ibid. 3. Sincerity. 246, 247, 248 4. Constancy
and Perseverance, and that, 1. In faith, and the profession thereof. 248, 249,
250 2. In obedience. 251, 252

A brief and Scholastical Discourse touching the nature of Thanksgiving. Ephesians.
5. 20.
Giving thanks always for all things, unto God, and the Father, in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.
FIve Generals considerable in the words, 1. An act or duty, giving thanks. The
disficulty and comprehensiveness of the duty. 257, 258 By way of Connotation,
it takes in all duties that concern God or man. 258

Formally in it self, it has five (...), or degrees.
1. Observation. 258, 259, 260 2. Confession. 260, 261 3. Remembrance. 261 4.
Valuation. 261, 262, 263 5. Retribution, not of justice, but of favorable
acceptance. 263, 264, 265

2. The second General in the words, is the time when this duty is to be
persormed, always.
How understood of the effects of thanksgiving, and how of thanksgiving it
self. 266 1. Habitual. ibid. 2. Actual, in reference to that, it is to be
taken, not in a Mathematical, but Moral Latitude; and so imports nothing but
frequency and constancy. 266. 267. 268.

3. The third thing considerable, etc. is the matter for what, all things: And
we are to give thanks for all things.
1. Collectively. 268 2. Distributively. 1. Pro generibus singulorum. 268 2.
Pro singulis Generum. ibid.

Two Questions propounded and resolved.

1. The first, Whether or no Gods greatness, absolute goodness, his goodness in
himself, with other absolute perfections of his, etc. be matter of
thanksgiving, etc? 263 269 2. The second, Whether or no we are to be thankful
for afflictions? 269, 270, 271, 272 3. The third General, is the object unto
whom, God, and the Father. The words may be taken, either in regard of us, or
of Christ. 1. In regard of us. 272 2. In regard of Christ; and so they contain
a description of the Father, from two relations unto Christ, he is, 1. The God
of Christ, as man, viz. by special Covenant, and confederation. 272 2. The
Father of Christ. 1. As God, by eternal generation. 273 2. As man, not at all
by adoption, but by collation of the grace of union. 273, 274 Having spoken of
both titles, God, and Father considered absolutely; they are next treated of,
as they relate unto our thanksgiving; and so they distinguish our thanks from
Heathenish and Jewish Doxologies. 274 And here it is observed, that the addition
of Father is not exclusive of the Son and holy Ghost: Notwithstanding then the
appropriation of it unto God, as limited unto the Person of the Father, we may
justly infer the dueness of it unto God indefinitely, and that unshar'd with
any Creature, either in whole or in part. 274, 275, 276, 277

The last Particular, is the Mediator, in whose name our thanks are to be
tendered, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. There is,
1. Necessity of a Mediator, whether we regard our selves, or our thanks. 277
2. Congruity that Christ should be he. 277, 278

Of Original Righteousness, and its Contrary, Concupiscence.
ALL that is said concerning Original righteousness, is reduced unto two heads.

1. An Sit? 2. Quid sit? 1. Inquiry is made concerning its an sit? Where proved
against the Socinians, and Dr. Tailor, That Original righteousness was in Adam.
279, 280, 277b 278b 279b 2. A double quid sit of original righteousness is
inquired into. 1. Quid nominis? Why the righteousness of the first man is
called original righteousness. 280b 281 2. Quid rei? What is meant by the thing
it self: And for the clearing of this, seven particulars explicated: Its 1.
Materiale, matter or foundation. 282, 283 2. Formale, or formality. 283 3.
Subject in which seated. 283, 284 4. Causation, or production. 284 5. Effects.
285, 286 6. Difference from sanctifying grace. 286, 287 7. The relation unto
the first man, Whether it were natural or supernatural to him? Which disficult
and important question is at large handled against Papists, Arminians,
Socinians, and Dr. Tailor. 288, usque ad 318

The malignant influence, or causality of Concupiscence. Jam. 1. 14, 15.
But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is
finished, brings forth death.
LUst is not here taken for the act of lust, nor for contracted, acquired,
habitual lust: But for original lust. 318 Concerning it, we have remarkable, 1.
The propriety of its inherence, (...) own lust. 319 2. The force of its
influence, it tempts, draws, enticeth to sin, etc. ibid. Here we have of
this influence, 1. The extent. 320 2. The branches. ibid. 3. The degrees. 320,
321, 322, 323, 324, 325

The words being analized, and expounded, are in the next place cleared (...)
two (...) inferences of Papists.
The first, That Concupiscence is not sin. 325, 326 The second, That there are
venial sins. 326, 327 One observation pitched upon: That every man's lust or
(...), is the principal cause of his temptations unto sin. 327 The point
deduced from the Text, is briefly explained, confirmed, and applied. 1. For
Explication, two distinctions (...), The first, Of an immediate, and medi ate
cause of temptation. 327 The second, Of an universal, and particular cause of
temptation. 327, 328 2. The Confirmation has two parts. 1. That our own lust
is a cause. 328, 329 2. That it is a principal cause of temptation unto sin,
because it tempts, 1. Internally. 2. Esfectively. 3. Perpetually. 329 3. The
uses that are to be made of this Point, are Of Information. Of Reprehension. Of
Exhortation. 1. Of Information, and they are three. 1. We may hence learn what
a great difference there is betwixt the temptations of lapsed man unto sin, and
the temptations of our first Parents unto the first sin. 329, 330 2. We may
hence be instructed, what a wide (...) there is betwixt our temptations unto
sin, and the temptations of Christ. 330, 331 3. We may from the causality, or
influence of lust, infer its obliquity against Papists, Socinians, and Dr.
Tailor. 331, 332

From this, there may be refuted three other Points of Popery.
1. The absolute perfection of the good works of the regenerate. 332 2. Their
Justification by them. ibid. 3. Their possibility of fulsilling the Law. 332,
333 From speculative, practical uses are proceeded to. 2. The next Use, is of
reprehension of all such as excuse, or extenuate their sins, by discharging
them upon the importunity and violence of outward temptations, etc. 333, 334 3.
Lastly, Diverse Exhortations may be inferred srom the causality and influence of
our Concupiscence.

We may hence be (...) unto,

1. Humiliation for it. 334, 335 2. Mortification of it. 336, 337, 338, 339,
340, 341 3. Watchfulness against it. 341, 342 4. Thankfulness for deliverance
from it. 342, 343, 344

There be also some duties, regarding our brethren, (...) which we may from
this (...) efficacy of (...); be pressed.
1. We may hence be exhorted to be careful in our watch over them, diligent in
our admonition of them, frequent in our prayers for them. 344, 345 2. We may
hence be persuaded to sugar and sweeten our reproofs of brethren, with meekness
and moderation.

The created and lapsed condition of man. Eccles. 7. 29.
Lo, this only have I found, that God has made man upright, but they have
sought out many inventions.
THe Coherence of the words, wherein inquired in what sense Solomon says, That
he found not one woman amongst a thousand. 346 In the words, two Conclusions,
unto which is premised a Preface, (...), this only have I found: Wherein three
things remarkable. 1. The weight and importance of these two Conclusions,
employed in the Particle, Lo. 347 2. The means by which Solomon came to the
knowledge of these two Points, diligent search, and study into the word and
will of God; This have I found. 347, 348 3. We have a comparison of these
Conclusions, with other points of Doctrine hinted in the Particle only: This
only have I found; this, and nothing else. 348 Against which an Objection, and
unto it three Answers. 348, 349, 350

Having (...) over the praecognita, the Conclusions themselves are next
proceeded to.
Conclus. 1. Concerns Original righteousness, God made man upright. 350
Conclus. 2. Concerns Original Sin, peccatum originale originans, the fall of
our first Parents; They have sought out many inventions. These words describe
the fall of our first Parents, not as it is considered formally in it self; but
Metonymically, by its motives or effects. 1. By its motives, if we understand
them only of our first Parents. 350 Against this interpretation, two doubts
propounded and resolved. 350, 351 2. By its effects, if we extend them unto

Printed by Hen: Hall, Printer to the UNIVERSITY, for Tho: Robinson, 1659.

To the Right Worshipful Sir WILLIAM WYNDHAM, of Orchard Wyndham, in the
County of Somerset, BARONET.
SIR,
THose that know the depth of my obligations to you, have long since expected
my public acknowledgment thereof; and having now an opportunity to make it:
My own Conscience would condemn me of a most disingenuous ingratitude, if I
should any longer defer it. But not only my private, and personal
engagements, but your own merit will justify this Dedication: for it is so well,
and generally known, as that it may, with a great deal of justice, entitle you
unto the exactest pieces of the able pens of the age, therefore much more unto
the poor, and mean endeavors of

Your Unworthy, though most grateful Servant HENRY JEANRS.

A TREATISE Concerning the INDIFFERENCY OF HVMANE ACTIONS.
I Have often wondered at some Prelatists, charging the poor non-conformists
with denial of things indifferent; from which their Writings do sufficiently
acquit them: Dr John Burgess (in his Rejoinder, Page 188, 189.) tells (...),
that Mr Bradshaw against all Learning, and sense, resolves, that there is
nothing indifferent. But from this accusation, we have (...) (...) his
Vindication ( in his fresh suite against (...), page 161, (...).) (...) Hammond
(in his grounds of Uniformity) accuses Amesius himself for this opinion; but
with how little truth, the Reader may, soon see; if he please to peruse these
following places in him, Med. Theolog. lib. 2. cap. 3. sect. 13, 14, 15. (...)
(...) (...). lib. 3. cap. 18. Gregory de (...) informs me, that one of the
Articles of John Husse, (anathematized in the Council of Constance.) was, that
(...) sunt (...) (...). That which Papists of old charged upon him, these men
impute to those, whom they have been pleased to nickname (...). But for the
untruth, and injustice of this crimination, we dare appeal to the more
moderate, and Learned of their own party. The Reverend, and Learned Dr
Sanderson disputes against them, for making the restraint of the outward man
in matters indifferent, an impeachment to Christian liberty; on Rom: 14. 3.
Page 24. 25. And this presupposes that they held somethings to be in their
nature indifferent. I shall therefore spend no more time, or paper, to wipe off
an aspersion so manifestly untrue, and unjust: But yet however this has
occasioned me to resolve upon the brief stating of the truth touching things,
or actions indifferent: and in order hereunto I shall 1. Premise some
Distinctions concerning the actions of man; and 2. Explain what is meant by
indifferency.

1. First, The actions of man are either indeliberate or deliberate.

1. Indeliberate, which proceed, either from the disposition of natural
qualities (as hungering, thirsting, the easing and disburdening of nature) or
else from the force of Imagination, (as rubbing of the beard, or hand,
scratching of the head, lifting up of a straw from the ground, and such like
things, when a man thinks not of them.) 2. Deliberate, which proceed from
deliberate reason and are properly humane, and rational actions, all voluntary
actions.

These may be considered two manner of ways. 1. In the general, (...) (...).
2. (...) the singulars, and individual's, actu (...).


The former consideration is merely in regard of the object; The latter takes
in all circumstances whatsoever: The former is a consideration of actions,
secundum speciem, according to their sort or (...); The latter is a
consideration of them in regard of their actual existence.

In a second place we are to enquire, what is meant by the (...) of actions: It
apparently carries in its notlon, a negation of moral goodness, and
illness: I say, signanter, of moral goodness, and illness; because the most
indifferent actions are (...), and may be naturally good. (...) indifferent
action then (...) that, which is neither (...) good, (...) evil: The nature
(...) things (...), ( says the great Hpoker in his (...). (...), Page 59.) is
neither to be commanded, nor forbidden, but left free, and arbitrary: With
which I would desire Dr Hammond to reconcile what he has in his Treatise of
Will Worship; that the best of moral actions, the highest degrees of virtue,
and of worship, the most superlative love of God are uncommanded: and he, I
hope, will give me leave to add, that they are not forbidden, and hereupon I
shall conclude, that (by Mr Hooker his definition) they are indifferent; which
is as unsober a conceit almost, as can be uttered, and unworthy of any serious
resutation. I shall here only make use of part of his expressions against Ames
( in his grounds of Uniformity, Page 14.) He that thinks the highest degree of
virtue is indifferent, does certainly use other Dictionaries then we do. But
to leave him, I shall for clearing the nature of indifferency propound, and
satisfy two Queries.

1. What medium indifferent things are betwixt things morally good, and evil?
whether medium abnegationis, or participationis? The Author of Altar
Damascenum affirms it to be medium (...) a middle between them by way of
abnegation, Adiaphora non sunt media per participationem, ut (...) inter album,
and nigrum; sed per negationem utriusque extremi, conformitatis and
difformitatis ad rectam (...), seu (...), page 496.

But for the disproofe of this, I shall desire you to observe out of Esse (...)
ad bonum, and malum contingit dupliciter, aut per modum abstractionis, secundum
quod universale (...) significat ut abstractum a differentiis, and
concontrariis dividentibus ipsum, unde in (...) communitate significatum
significatur ut (...) se habens (...) differentiam. Sicut animal reque
significatur ut rationale (...) ut irrationale, and tamen (...) omne (...)
animal esse (...) vel (...). Et (...) (...) (...). (...) (...) actus in (...)
quod est agere, (...) quidem bonitatem in quantum est ens, sed (...) se (...)
bonitatem, vel malitiam moralem. Et (...) bonum ex (...) indifferenter le habet
ad bonum and malum ex cucumstantia and (...), quamvis non inveniatur aliquod
bonum in genere particulari, quod non sit (...) (...) vestitum, and ad aliquem
finem ordinatum, unde oportet, quod bonitatem, vel malitiam (...). Et secundum
hane considerationem quidam dixerunt omnes actus (...) (...) esse in eo quod
sunt actus, and quidam (...), quod non omnes, sed aliqui, accipientes magis in
speciali nomina (...), quae non (...) aliquid, unde actus, ad malitiam vel
(...) determinetur, vel (...) vel finem vel circumstantiam, (...) comedere,
coire, et hujusmodi. Alio modo contingit (...) secundum, quod aliquod
particulare significatum delicit a susceptibilitate (...) perfectionis, sicut
lapis a susceptibilitate visus, and (...) modo aliqui actus, qui deficiunt a
susceptibilitate bonitatis moralis dicuntur indifferenter. lib. 2. senten.
(...) 40. quaest. (...).
Capreolus, that a thing may be said to be a medium, or middle betwixt that
which is morally good, and morally evil; either by way of abstraction from
them (as a general nature is abstracted from it is differences, a subject from
it is accidents;) or else by way of repugnancy unto them, because it is
incapable of them, and thus a stone is of a middle nature betwixt that which
sees, and is blind, because it is incapable of both sight, and blindness. Now
it is this latter way, that a thing is said to be a medium by the abnegation of
each extreme, as is evident by the instances usually brought for the
exemplification hereof; For they are of such things as are incapable of, and
repugnant unto both extremes. And the most indifferent actions, that proceed
from deliberate reason, are capable of becoming either good, or evil, by
circumstances, and carry no (...) thereunto: so much is confessed by Didoclave
himself in the place above mentioned. Tertium quod constituit hujus medii
formale est non repugnantia ad utrunque extremum. Actus (...) in bove
cornu-peta nullam habet conformitatem, aut dissormitatem ad rectam rationem,
non tamen dicitur actus indifferens, quia ibi est repugnantia ad utrunque
extremum, nam bos est animal irratimale. Adiaphora igitur sunt dubia,
indistincta, and UTROQUE vergentia, sed non magis vergentia in unum quam
alterum extremum.

Others therefore conclude, that indifferent actions are a medium, or middle
betwixt good, and bad, in a way of participation; and that either potentiall,
or actual.

1. Potentiall, There is in them a non-repugnancy unto either of the extremes,
unto moral goodness or badnesse, so that they may be either good, or bad by
circumstances. 2. Actual, and this agrees only to such indifferent acts, as
become good by circumstances, for they being but imperfectly good, are in part
good, and in part evil, and so partake actually of both extremes. By this you
may see, though indifferent actions, which proceed from deliberate reason may
in some sense be said to be a medium of participation betwixt that which is
morally good, or evil; yet they are not said to be a middle of participation
in such a strict sense, as lukewarmnesse is betwixt cold, and heat; for that
always partaketh actually of both extremes (cold, and heat,) whereas
indifferent actions do not always actually partake of the two extremes,
(moral goodness or badnesse,) but only when they are good; for many of them
may be, and too often are by circumstances totally and altogether evil, and in
no respect good. Amesius qualifies the matter, and affirms that as it is not
medium merae abnegationis, so it is medium alicujus participationis, a middle
not of mere abnegation, but of some participation. Absolutely, and simply, in
strictness of speech, it is neither medium negationis, nor participationis: 1.
Not (...); because it has no repugnancy unto it is extremes: 2. Not
participationis; because it does not allwaies actually partake of both
extremes; But yet, (...) quid, after a sort, and in some respect, it may be
reduced unto both medium abnegationis, and participationis: It resembles
medium (...), because as such it is neither of the extremes; and it resembles
medium participationis, because sometimes it actually participates of both
extremes: And thus you see how these different opinions may be reconciled; But
yet (because denominatio fit a potiori) we shall rather reduce it unto medium
participationis; because unto that it has the greatest resemblance.
A second question is; Whether all indifferent actions be equally indifferent?
no more bending unto evil, then unto good? Didoclave holds the affirmative,
Nec solum (says he) requiritur negatio conformitatis, seu difformitatis ad
legem ceu rectam rationem, sed etiam majoris propensionis in unam quam in aliam
partem. And again afterward: Adiaphora non sunt magis vergentia in unum quam
alterum extremum. The incomparably Learned Dr Sanderson is of a contrary
opinion, that some things are unequally indifferent, Indifferentia ad unum (as
he is pleased to call them) I shall transcribe his words, and with all due
reverence of his person briefly examine them.

Dr Sanderson on Rom: 3. 8. page 58. 59. Things unequally indifferent are such,
as though they be neither universally good, not absolutely evil, yet even
barely considered, sway more, or less rather the one way, then the other: And
that either unto good, or unto evil. Of the former sort are such outward
actions, as being in moral precepts (...) commanded, are yet sometimes
sinfully and ill done: as, giving an alms, hearing a (...), repreoving an
offender; and the like, which are in themselves good, and so to be accounted,
rather then evil; though some unhappy Circumstance or other may make them ill.
Of the latter sort are such outward actions, as being in moral precepts
indefinitely prohibited, are yet in some cases lawful, and may be well done:
as, swearing an oath, traveling on the Sabbath day, playing for money, and the
like: which are in themselves rather evil, then good, because they are ever
(...), unless all circumstances concur to make them good. Now of these
actions, though the former sort carry the face of good, the latter of evil;
yet in very truth both sorts are indifferent. Understand me aright: I do not
mean indifferent, indifferentia contradictionis, such as may be indifferently
(...) done, or not done; but indifferent only indifferentia contrarietatis,
such as (suppose the doing) may be indifferently either good, or evil: because
so they may be done, as to be good, and so they may be done also, as to be
evil; but yet with this difference, that (...) former, though indifferent, and
in some cases evil, are yet of themselves notably and eminently inclined unto
good rather then evil; and these latter proportionably unto evil, rather then
good. For answer: The first sort of actions, such as being in moral precepts
indefinitely commanded, are yet sometimes sinfully and ill done, (as, giving an
alms, hearing a sermon, reproving an offender, and the like,) are not in the
language of the Schoolmen, indifferent actions: This I shall make good by an
argument out of Suarez (brought by him unto another purpose;) He disputing
against some, that held all humane actions to be indifferent, proves the
contrary; First in inward, then in outward actions; and his argument (...)
outward actions stands thus. If external acts be considered according to an
objective goodness, or illness, this cannot be true, because there are many
actions in their own nature objectively evil, and prohibited, and there are
other also objectively good, and honest; because this goodness, and illness
is not taken by extrinsick Denomination, from the inward act, but from it is
(...) call agreement with, or repugnancy unto right reason. Those actions which
have a material, and objective goodness, are not indifferent actions in the
language of the Schools. But the actions, that the Doctor speaks of, have an
objective, and material goodness, because they are commanded, and therefore
they are not indifferent. But, says the Doctor, they are indifferent at least
indifferentia Contrarietatis, such as (suppose the doing) may be indifferently
either good or evil: because so they may be done, as to be good, and so they
may be done also, as to be evil.

For answer: By this account all outward ordinances of God, all external acts
of worship, and indeed all outward good works whatsoever should be actions
indifferent, because they may be done well, or ill: But to say that all these
are indifferent would be very strange language: for although they may have
evil cast upon them externally by the agent, yet this is no hinderance but
that they may be in themselves objectively and materially good, as being matter
of precept.

But perhaps there may be some mystery in this clause, indefinitely commanded:
They are commanded, but not to be performed always, but only loco, and tempore
debitis; according to the known rule, Affirmativa praecepta obligant semper,
non ad semper.

For answer: This will nothing alter the case; for hereby it will follow, that
the matter of all affirmative precepts should be indifferent; And whosoever
shall say so takes indifferency in a different notion from the usual acception
thereof by both Papists, and Protestants; who jointly make it to be a middle
thing betwixt that moral goodness, and badnesse, which is called (...) or
material.

As for the second sort of Actions, I readily confess that in some sense they
may be said to be unequally indifferent, inclining and swaying more to evil,
then to good. To clear which I shall distinguish of a twofold consideration of
such actions: They may be considered merely in regard of their object, or else
also in regard of the circumstances, which usually are annexed with them: In
regard of their object they are equally indifferent; But yet in regard of
Circumstances may be said to be more notably and eminently inclined unto evil
then unto good; because the circumstances, which generally, and commonly are
connexed with them, are evil.

But as for the reason, which the Doctor brings to prove them to be unequally
indifferent, rather evil, then good, is to me very unsatisfying. His words
are, which are in themselves rather evil, then good, because they are over
(...), unless all circumstances concur to make them good.

The ground of my exception against this reason is; because as much may be said
of all outward good works, religious duties, and services whatsoever: They are
all ever evil, unless all circumstances concur to make them good, according
to that of Dionysius, Bonum fit ex causa integra: malum ex quovis defectu. I
shall conclude my answer unto this second (...), with rehearsal of Dr Ames his
proposal, and decision of it. An actiones indifferentes nihil inter se
differant, sed aeque omnes a bono, and malo distent?

Resp. In sua intrinseca natura nihil omnino (...); sed tamen (...) sunt, quae
ut plurimum habent circumstantias malas annexas, atque adeo dicuntur vergere in
malum, aut in malum sonare, ut accusatoris aut carnificis munere fungi: quaedam
etiam, quae ut plurimum habent circumstantias bonas annexas, atque adeo
dicuntur (...) in bonum, aut in bonum sonare, ut colere agros, diligentiam in
studiis adhibere, etc.

In their own intrinsecall nature they differ nothing at all: but yet there are
some which for the most part have evil circumstances annexed to them, and so
bend more toward evil, and have an evil name: as to do the work of an
accuser, the osfice of an hangman, etc. some there be also which for the most
part have good circumstances, and so bend toward good, and have a good name, as
to till the ground, to (...) our study diligently etc.

Having premised these things, I shall in the next place, proceed to lay down
some conclusions concerning the indifferency of the actions of man: and they
shall be three.

1. Conclusion. The Indeliberate actions of man which proceed from the
disposition of natural qualities, or only from the Imagination, as to rub the
beard, or hands, to scratch the head, to move the head, feet, or a staff (The
mind being not intent upon them,) may be, and are indifferent, not only in the
general, but in their individuals, and singulars: The reason which 1. 2a qu.
18. art. 9.
Aquinas gives for this is very solid; Because such actions to speak properly
are not moral, and humane, for they do not proceed from the soul as
reasonable: Those actions, which are not moral, or of moral consideration,
are incapable of moral goodness or badnesse: for moral goodness, or
badnesse implies a moral being: But now those actions which proceed from the
disposition of natural qualities, or from the force of the Imagination only
are not moral, are not of moral consideration, they are (...) (...) moris:
And the reason is because actions have their morality (...) this, that they are
some way or other immediately, or mediately derived from reason.

Against this reason of Aquinas, ( c) Durand propounds this following
objection: that if the acts of the imagination be incapable (...) contra hoc
(...), quia ubi (...) dominium rationis, vel voluntatis, ibi (...) genus (...),
led (...) (...) vel (...) invenitur non solum in actibus qui sequuntur rationem
(...), sed etiam qui praecedunt, in quantum a ratione praeveniri potuerunt, ut
dictum suit, supra, did. 24. q. 5. ((...) in sensualitate nullum posset esse
(...)) ergo actus procedentes a sola imaginatione pertinent ad genus moris,
(...) subsunt imperio rationis, in quantum ab ea pollunt (...), (...) sic per
(...) sunt susceptivi bonitatis, and (...) moralis, cujus (...) assumebatur pro
fundamento.

Et ad hoc potest dici, quod aliqui actus procedentes ab imaginatione, et
praevenientes (...) (...) sunt tales, circa quos ratio debet esse pervigil, ne
insurgant, et tales sunt (...) appetitus sensitivi circa materiam (...) etc.
and (...) talium actuum (...) cunque deliberationem praeveniant, potest (...)
negligens ratio in reprimendo, and (...) etc, (...) de his procedit ratio,
(...) quod sunt aliquo modo in genere moris, rec sunt indifferentes. (...)
autem sunt, circa quos ratio nullo modo (...) esse pervigil, nisi in casu
ratione (...) adjuncti, quia objecta talium (...) se non sunt materia alicujus
(...) etc. ut (...) (...), vel (...) barbam: Et (...) actus ut sic
pervenientes, quos non (...) (...) (...), nisi in casu sunt pure extra (...)
moris, and indifferentes ad bonum, and malum, de quibus intelligenda (...)
praedicta opinio.


of a moral being, and so not of a moral consideration, that then they are
incapable of sin: for every (...) action is a moral action: But now they are
not incapable of sin: for it is most evident, that in sensualitate potest
(...) (...), that sin may be in the indeliberate acts of the sensitive
appetite, and in the acts of the imagination; and the reason is, because the
sensual powers or faculties are said to belong or appertain unto reason,
though not essentialiter, yet participative, as being under the conduct and
guidance of right reason, obliged to hearken unto it is voice, and to obey all
it is just Commands, and dictates.

The answer here-unto in the same Author is, that the indeliberate acts of the
sensitive powers, and faculties are of two sorts.

1. Some have for their matter, sin, and such are moral: for they are
voluntary, though not directly, as being produced or commanded by the will, yet
indirectly, as being that, which the will is able, and obliged to hinder: and
therefore reason ought to be watchful to prevent the rising of them.

But now there are some indeliberate acts of the sensitive faculties, which
have not for their objects the matter of sin, such as are above instanced in,
and of them we may say indefinitely, and in the general, that they are not
moral; because they are not voluntary, either directly, or indirectly; Reason
is not bound to keep any watch over them, nor is the will bound to restrain,
and repress them; nisi in casu, rationo alicujus adiuncti, as Durand limits
it. As when they are a hinderance to Duties, or against that decency which is
required in the worship, and service of God; As for example if a man should be
rubbing of his beard, scratching of his head, moving of his feet, or any other
part of his body in an undecent way in the act of receiving the elements in the
Lords supper: That which I have said touching this Conclusion is for the
substance of it in Ames de Conscientia. lib. 3. cap. 18. His words I shall
transcribe. Actiones quaedam ita sunt hominis, ut non sint proprie humanae,
illae scilicet, quae procedunt ab imaginatione nuda, and non a ratione
deliberata, ut fricare manus, aut barbam, scalpere caput, levare festucam, etc.
dum aliud aliquid cogitamus. Hujusmodi actiones non sunt moraliter (...) aut
malae: quia non sunt in genere moris constitutae, dum omni consilio
destituuntur. Quamvis enim istis etiam (...) quis peccare, ut si tempore precum
vagari sineret imaginationem suam, et huiusmodi nugis indulgere, ipsae tamen
actiones per se (...) malae sunt, (...) bonae. Subijciuntur quidem istiusmodi
motus imperio arbitrii humani; sed ita subijciuntur, (...) possint exerceri
nullo rationis actu (...) neque vlterius illas ratione praevenire tenemur, quam
ut officis non obsint. Sicut in oculorum (...) movendis moderandi potestatem
habet ratio, et voluntas: sed non (...) operae pretium observare quoties
connivemus, si modo caveatur, ne praeter decorum, aut officium aliquid in (...)
admittatur.

1. There be some actions, which though they be actions of man, yet they are
not humane actions, such are those which proceed from imagination only, and not
from deliberate reason, as the rubbings of men's hands, to scratch the head or
beard, to take up a straw, etc. while we are thinking of something else: these
actions are not morally good or evil, they want that which is required to make
them so, namely counsel and deliberation: for although a man may sin by those
actions, as if in time of prayer he suffer his imagination to wander, and do
give way to such toyings as those. Yet these actions considered in themselves
are neither good nor evil. It is true these motions are subject to the Command
of man's will, but yet they are so subject, that they may be exercised without
any precedent act of reason; neither are we (...) any farther by reason to
prevent them, but only so (...) that they hinder not the duties we are about.
So (...) moving of the eyelids, reason and the will have power to moderate
them, but it is not worth the while to take notice how often we wink, if so be
we take heed, that in such things nothing be done, which is undecent, or
against our duty.

A second Conclusion: There be diverse deliberate actions, that proceed from
deliberate reason, which if they be considered in actu signato, in the
general, secundum speciem, according to their sort, or Kind, as abstracted
from all singularizing circumstances. are indifferent, neither morally good,
nor evil: This I shall confirm by scripture, and by reason.

1. By scripture: And here we have a most signal place. 1. Cor. 6. 12. All
things are lawful unto me. Here all things are to be taken not absolutely, but
limitedly, for all indifferent things: for as for things Commanded, they are
not only lawful, but also necessary, and therefore must be done (...) and
(...) (...): And as for things prohibited, they are unlawful and sinful. The
words then are an undeniable proof of the indifferency of some actions, and
withal an explication of such indifferency: Indifferent actions are merely
lawful, neither necessary, nor unlawful; They may lawfully be done, and
lawfully be abstained from. In this text then (...) have the extent of our
Christian liberty (...), and limited.

1. We have the extent of it unto all indifferent things asserted; And the
Apostle contents not himself to affirm it once, but doubleth the affirmation:
The reason of which may be, because he thought it an important point, or
because he would put it out of all doubt, and controversy. 2. We have also a
twofold limitation, or restraint put upon the use or exercising of our
Christian liberty as touching things indifferent; But all things are not
expedient; But I will not be brought under the power of any.
Many think, that Paul speaks these words per mimesin, a figure called
imitation; that he speaks not in his own person, but rehearses the words of
the Corinthians: so that here is, first Corinthiorum (...), the objection of
the Corinthians, All things are lawful for me: secondly, (...) (...), the
reply of Paul, But all things are not expedient: But I will not be brought
under the power of any. But whether the Apostle uttered his own words, or the
Corinthians is not material: because, suppose they be the words of the
Corinthians, he grants them with due limitations: The sentence of Paul, says
Aegidius Hunnius, consist's of a concession and correction.

1. A Concession of the lawfulness of all indifferent things. All things are
lawful for me. 2. A Correction or restriction of this large grant: wherein he
shows: that though all indifferent things be in their general nature
lawful; yet they are in some cases to be abstained from, when they are
inexpedient: when they enthrall us unto either persons, or things: But all
things are not (...): But I will not be brought under the power of any.
A great difference there is amongst expositors about the coherence of these
words: Some think, that the Apostle makes way for that Argument which he
handles at large chap: 9. All things are lawful for me; therefore to receive a
salary for preaching of the Gospel is lawful: But I will not make use of this
my liberty: Because it will not be expedient unto the promoting of the Gospel
amongst you, but an hinderance rather: And because I will retain my full
liberty of reproving you, which I shall in great part lose, if I should receive
my whole livelihood from you: As it fares with the false prophets among you,
that are no better then Trencher chaplains, that dare not touch your sores,
meddle with either your sins, or errors, for fear that hereupon you should
shorten your benevolence: I will not be brought under the power of any. But the
coherence is too (...) fetched, and we may say the same of others, who would
make these words to cohere with chap. 8. v. 9.

Others with more probability derive the connection of the words only from the
present chapter: and they are again subdivided: some fetch it from the words
foregoing: Others from the words following.

1. From the words foregoing. The Apostles discourse about going to law with
Brethren before the unjust, and unbelievers: The Corinthians might be ready to
object in behalf of this their practice, that it was a thing in it is own
nature indifferent, not prohibited by the word of God, and therefore lawful;
for all things are lawful, that is all indifferent things. True, says the
Apostle, but. 1. all things are not expedient: And in particular for Christians
to sue Christians before Paganish Tribunals is so far from being expedient, as
that it is an impediment unto Christians own glorifying of God in his immediate
worship and service, as also unto their quiet, peaceable, and comfortable
communion with Brethren. 2. I will not be brought under the power of any,
either persons, or things. And if you go in this manner to law with your
Brethren you will put your selves under the power of many both persons, and
things. 1. Persons: Perhaps you will lie at the mercy of an unjust judge: a
false witness may undo you; A corrupt lawyer betray you; your own witnesses
will command your table, and purse, though for attesting the truth; And though
your Advocates be never so faithful, you must give them your most diligent
attendance; As the proverb is, you must not only pay, but pray them too. 2.
Things: The many matters, the things of the world, which you sue for, will have
you so far under their power, as that they will be a great hinderance to your
free, and full service of God; for if they do not wholly withdraw you from it,
they will wonderfully distract you in it; Because law suits will take up the
greatest part of your time, and the best of your thoughts. Quidem hanc (...)
(...) explicant: (...) nullius (...) potestate, i. e. Non patiar me propter res
pecuniarias, ac temporales, velut (...) sub earum potestate, vel abstrahi vel
distrahi, quo minus libere, and absque impedimento serviam Deo, quod non
potero, si tempus and cogitationes (...) litibus. Esthius in loc.


Add unto this, that for Christians, especially in those primitive times, to
pursue their Brethren unto the judgment-seats of heathens, in matters capable
of an amicable compromise by the mediation of Brethren, was a plain evidence,
that they were under the power of the world, and the things thereof; for who
but a muckworme, a vassal to his wealth, would do a thing so much unto the
discredit of the Gospel, and reproach of Christianity; especially seeing they
might with greater probability expect justice from the umpirage of saints, then
the sentences of professed unbelievers? Others in the next place look for the
cohaesion of these words forwards, upon the Apostles ensuing discourse, touching
fornication: not only the Corinthians, but the Gentiles in general held simple
fornication to be a thing indifferent. The old man in the Comedian, spoke the
sense of the generality of them: Creed mihi non est slagitium adolescentulum
scortari. And you will the less wonder at this, if you consider, that Durand, a
Popish Schoolman, held it to be unlawful, not by the law of nature, but only
by the positive law of God: Quod autem dicunt quidam, quod simplex fornicatio
est peccatum mortale de se, exclusa omni lege positiva, divina and humana, non
been intelligo, lib. 4. did. 33. quaest. 2. And upon the Consideration of this
opinion of the Gentiles touching the indifferency of fornication it was, (think
interpreters,) that fornication is Acts. 15. by the first Council ranged
amongst indifferent things, blood, and things strangled; The use of which was
forbidden only for a time. Unto this erroneous supposition the Apostle
answers per limitationem, and per inficiationem: He limits the general rule
touching things indifferent, and then he denies the instance in question. And
this his denial he illustrateth, and confirms from verse. 13. unto the end of
the chapter. Unto this his denial he premiseth limitations of the general
rule. All indifferent things are lawful: He puts a double restraint upon it.
The first; But all things are not expedient, or profitable: Many indifferent
things sometimes prove an impediment unto our Christian race, and then they are
to be forborne. A second restraint is in these words: But I will not be brought
under the power of any: My affection unto indifferent things shall be so
temperate, as that it shall be in my power to forbear (...) upon reasonable
and important Considerations. There should be an indifferency in our desires
toward things indifferent, so that they should not have the command of us; but
we should be able to use, or not to use them, as the concurrence of particular
circumstances guide us:

To give yet further light unto these words, I shall briefly consider their
coherence as they lie in 1 Cor. 10. 23. with little variation. The Apostle
there states a case of Conscience touching the eating of Idolothytes, things
offered unto Idols. First, he resolves, that to eat them publicly in the
temple of Idols, at the idolatrous feasts of these Idols, was to have
communion in the worship of these idols to have fellowship with Devils; to be
partakers of the table of Devils: He that did thus eat them, did eat them
considered formally, as (...) and consecrated to idols; He did eat them in the
honor of the idols, unto which they were offered; He did tacitly acknowledge
their Deity, and (...) approve of the Idolatrous worship and service of them;
But now the Apostle allows a private use of things offered to idols, If they
were not eaten under a religious notion, but considered only and materially as
meat, matter of food, and as the good creatures of God. Two cases he instanceth
in, wherein they might be thus eaten; First, they might buy them in the
shambles, and eat them in their own houses, verse. 25. And secondly, they might
eat them at the tables of their unbelieving neighbors, that invited them: This
latter part of the Determination of the question he confirms, and limiteth, by
putting in an exception in the case of scandal: And unto all this he prefixeth
the extension of our Christian liberty, unto all indifferent things in the
general, together with two restrictions, that we are to put upon it in the use
and exercise: Even indifferent things are to be forborne, when they are not
profitable, and conducing unto the ends, which a Ubi nota, Hactenus egit Paulus
de idolothytis, qua talibus, sicque veruit ea comedere. Unde v. 14. Fugite,
ait, ab idolorum cultu, (...), ne sitis mensae, and calicis daemoniorum
participes, ut explicat v. 20. (...), comedendo (...) bos idolis oblates, eo

Christian should propound: when they are destructive and scandalous unto our
Brethren: Omniamihi (...), omnia scilicet adiaphora, quale est comedere
idolothyta, non quasi sacra, aut quasi idolothyta sed tanquam communes cibos.
All things are lawful for me, but all things are not (...): All things are
lawful for me, but all things edify not.

Unto these two places (1 Cor. 6. 12. 1 Cor. 10. 23.) I shall add one more (1
Cor. 8. 8.) But meat (...) us not to God: for neither, if we eat are we the
better: neither if we eat (...), are we the (...): Meat (that is) the use and
eating of meat ( (...) considered, and in the general) commends us not to
God: for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink: for (...) if we eat, are we
the (...), (...), have we the more, (that is) the more virtue in our selves,
the more grace and favor with God: Neither if we eat not, are we the worse
(...), have we the less, the less virtue in our selves, the less acceptance
with God: Eating then of any sort or kind of meat ( considered, as abstracted
from all singularizing circumstances) is a thing indifferent that has neither
virtue, nor vice in it, neither pleases nor displeases God: And what the
Apostle speaks of eating of meat, is applyable by way of analogy and
proportion unto a world of things of the like nature, as shall be manifested by
the reasons for the Conclusion, unto which in the next place I hasten.

The Protestants generally thus argue: The nature of things indifferent (as the
Learned Hooker determines) is neither to be commanded nor forbidden, but left
free and arbitrary: But now there are diverse humane and voluntary actions, that
are in the general neither commanded, nor forbidden (as to eat, drink, go a
journey, walk into the field:) Therefore there are diverse humane and
voluntary actions, that are in the general, and for the kind indifferent. This
argument the Papists dislike because they think, that there are matters of
Counsel, which contain the highest degree of moral goodness, and
perfection: And yet think they are uncommanded, and no man will say that they
are forbidden. The Argument of the Schoolmen therefore generally runs thus:
Actions, that are neither agreeable, nor disagreeable unto right reason are
indifferent: But there are diverse humane and voluntary actions, that in their
general nature, and consideration carry, neither conformity, nor repugnancy
unto right reason: And therefore there are diverse humane and voluntary actions,
that are indifferent. This argument is thus managed by Ubi autem ratio non
debet esse (...) affirmando qua^ (...), ibi voluntas non debet magiscon formari
rationi affirmativae quam negativae: unde potest sic argui. Ille actus nec est
bonus, nec est malus, circa quem ratio non potest esse magis (...) in
affirmando quam in negando, sed levare festucam, quantum est praecise ex
ratione, quam sortitur actus ex objecto, est hujusmodi, quia ratio neque
affirmando quod levanda est, neque negando levandam esse magis (...) est, ergo
actus de se neque bonus est, neque malus. Major (...), quia persecutio and fuga
actus voluntatis quoad bonitatem vel malitiam correspondent affirmationi, and
negationi rationis practicae quoad veritatem and falsitatem, and ideo ubi est
ratio aeque indifferens quoad veritatem, and salsitatem in affirmando and
negando, ibi (...) actus indisterens quoad malitiam and bonitatem in
prosequendo, and fugiendo. Minor probatur, quia (...) rationis consistit in
conformitate ad aliquam legem naturalem vel divinam vel ex his (...), circa
autem tales actus, ut levare festucam, vel buiusmodi, nulla lex aliquid
determinat, nec divina, nec naturalis nec ex his derivata, ergo circa eos sic
acceptos ratio non potest habere aliquam rectitudinem, vel obliquitatem magis
in affirmando quam in negando, and haec suit minor. Sequitur ergo conclusio.
lib. 2. did. 40. q. 1.
Durand: That act is neither good nor evil, but indifferent, Concerning which
there is in the reason of man no more rectitude, or irrectitude and obliquity
in the affirmation, then in the negation in it is dictating either the practice,
or in its dictating the forbearance thereof. For the pursuit and eschewall of
the will are in regard of moral goodness, or badnesse correspondent unto the
dictates of the practical understanding, and therefore where there is an
indifferency in point of truth in the understandings dictates concerning the
doing, or not doing of a thing, there is an indifferency in regard of moral
goodness or badnesse in the wills embracing, or eschewing of that thing. If
the understanding err not, whether it prescribe the performance, or
forbearance of an action, then the will sins not, whether it perform or
forbear it: But there are diverse acts concerning which there is in the reason
of man no more rectitude, or irrectitude and obliquity in the affirmation, then
in the negation of them, in its dictating the practice, or in its dictating the
forbearance of them: This he proves because the rectitude of reason consists
in conformity unto some natural law, or some divine law, or some law derived
from these: But there are diverse humane actions concerning which, there
occurreth no such law, either forbidding, or commanding: and therefore there is
no rectitude or obliquity in the reasons or understandings affirming or denying
of them. It is indifferent, which way the understanding takes, whether it
dictates the doing or not doing of them: and consequently it is indifferent,
whether the will (...), or nilleth them. Here by the way I cannot but take
notice, how Durand unawares crosses their doctrine of Evangelicall Counsels:
for Suarez ( de leg. lib. cap. 14.) will tell him, that Counsel is not
properly a Law: By this doctrine of Durand then in matters of Counsel there
should be no rectitude of reason, because no conformity unto any law: But this
by the by.

This argument is yet further improved by Sunt (...) complures actus, quos dum
praecise consideramus, ut versantur (...) (...), vel illud objectum; nec
laudamus, nec vituperamus tanquam (...) vel malos, sed censemus esse
indifferentes. Loquimur enim in proposito debonitate, and (...) morali proprie,
ut (...) bonitas non est qualis cunque congruentia cum ratione; and voluntate
hominis, sed congruentia ejusmodi, ut habeat laudem secundum aestimationem
hominum; tanquam aliquid, nempe quod quadret in rationem hominis, etiam ut
recta est, and ut is habet sibi a Deo propositam beatitudinem, ut ultimum
sinem. Quemadmodum (...) contra, malitia moralis, cui opponitur moralis
bonitas, consistit in repugnantia quadam erga (...) rectam hominis, quae
secundum humanam aestimationem habeat vituperium, tanquam aliquid repugnans,
and nocens homini, ut is habeat beatitudinem propositam sicut ultimum sinem
omnium actionum. Sic itaque loquendo proprie de bonitate, vel malitia morali
affirmamus quosdam esse actus, qui ex objecto (...) nec (...), nec mali sunt,
sed indifferentes. Tom: 2. Com. Theol: qu. 13. punct: 2.
(...) de Valentia. The Moral goodness (says he) which we speak of, is such
a congruence unto reason, as carries praise with it according unto the usual
estimate of men, and appertains unto man's everlasting happiness, his chief,
and sovereign end; and answerably the moral illness or badnesse of an action
stands in such a repugnancie unto right reason, as that according to the usual
estimation of men, it is worthy of dispraise, and is an impediment unto his
attaining his supreme end, the eternal bliss of his soul; But now there are
several humane actions that considered in themselves have neither praise nor
dispraise; neither prejudice, nor advantage the salvation of our souls; are
neither helps, nor lets unto the obtaining of our highest end and happiness,
and therefore there are actions morally indifferent.

Unto what has been said, I shall add two arguments more out of a late
Philosopher. Irenaeus, A Carmelite or white Friar Si omnis actus esset bonus
aut malus ex suo objecto, seu sua specie, liceret nobis judicare de quolibet
(...) opere, and tale ipsum (...), quale habet objectu^, sicuti actus ex
objecto determinatos pronuntiamus bonos, aut malos (...): sed non licet ita de
singulis (...), ex Matthew: 7. cujus ratio est apud patres, and Interpretes quod
(...) actus sint medii, scilicet de se indifferentes, ut sint boni, aut mali:
ergo, etc.

Multi actus sunt mali praecise ratione prohibitionis, V. G. portare arma de
nocte: ergo ii sunt ex specie sua indifferentes. Ethic: cap: 3. Sect: 2.




First, upon actions morally good, or bad, we may lawfully pass our Censures,
that they are such; But we should pass rash judgment, if we should censure
Diverse actions of our Brethren to be determinately virtuous, or determinately
vicious, moraly good or bad: Let not him that eats not judge him which
eats. Romans 14.

2. There are therefore some actions, which for their kind are neither good,
nor bad, but indifferent.

Secondly, Many acts are evil, only by the prohibition of some positive law;
As unto the Jews it was unlawful to eat Swines flesh, to wear a garment of
diverse colors, as of woollen and linen together, Deuteronomy. 22. 11. These actions
therefore, and many the like, were of themselves, and in their own nature,
indifferent, and became unlawful only by the ceremonial law given unto the
Jews, which law being abrogated, it is now a thing indifferent and lawful for
Christians to eat swines flesh, or not to eat it, to wear a garment of
linsey-woolsey, or not.

Unto these scriptures and reasons I shall add the testimony of Hierome,
frequently quoted for this purpose. Bonum, inquit, est continentia, malum est
luxuria. Inter utrumque indifferens ambulare, capitis, naribus purgamenta
projicere, sputis (...) (...). Hoc nec bonum, nec malum est: sive enim feceris,
sive non feceris, nec (...) habebis, nec injustitiam. Aristotle, and Sextus
Empyricus give in their verdict for the truth of this assertion, whose sayings
the reader may peruse at large in Raynaudus moral. discipline. distinct. 4.
quaest. 1. Art. 3. number. 39. page 550.

There is but one Considerable (...), which I shall briefly propound and
answer. Whatsoever agrees unto the species, the sort or kind of a thing,
agrees unto all individuals contained under it, And therefore if there be
humane actions, that be indifferent, secundum speciem, according to their kind,
the Individuals of such actions are indifferent too, which will be opposed in a
third Conclusion: That which does agree unto a thing (...) se, the opposite
thereof cannot agree unto it, either per se, or per Accidens: And therefore if
some actions are per se of themselves indifferent, it is impossible for the
Individuals of such: actions to be morally good, or evil. (i) (...) (...)
(...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...), (...)
secundum (...) negatio (...) per hoc quod est indifferens potest duplicitet
ordinari ad copulam verbalem: uno (...) nim modo (...) (...). and sic est
sensus quoth de ratione specifica actus est, quod sit indifferens et si isto modo
aliquis actus (...) speciem esset indifferens, non solum esset impossible dare
sub (...) specie actum individualem indifferentem, immo impossible esset sub
tali specie dari actum, nisi (...), quia ea quae sunt de ratione (...)
convenient omni individuo sub tali specie, sed si nullus est actus (...)
secundum speciem suam; sub quo tamen sensu argumentum procedit. (...) modo
(...) negatio importata per hoc, quod est indifferens, praepuni copulae verbali
sub hoc sensu, quod de ratione specifica actus non est, quod sit indifferenter,
vel determinate bonus (...) malus, sed tamen utrunque (...) ipfi per aliud
convenire, sicut homo ex sua specie non habet quod sit determinate albus, vel
determinate niger: et tamen per aliud ei utrunque istorum convenit. (...) hoc
(...) sunt multi actus qui sunt indifferentes secundum suam speciem, nullus
tamen secundum individuum, quia individuum multa includit quoad existentiam
suam quae ad rationem speciei non pertinent. Lib. 2. dift. 40. q. 1.


Unto this objection Durand answers, by (...) of a twofold sense of this
expression. An act is indifferent secundum speciem, according to it is kind. The
sirst is, that indifferency is of the specific nature of such an act. And this
sense, which is the sense of the objection, is false, for then it (...) be
(...) (...) any individuals of such an act not to be indifferent: But now there
is a second sense of the expression, that the specific nature of such an
action does not involve, or imply in it is notion moral either goodness or
illness, But is equally and indifferently abstracted from both: And this sense
is true: It is not of the specificke nature of many actions to be determinately
good, or determinately evil; though they may be either by circumstances. As
for the confirmation which is added; Morisan (...). Murc: Physic.
The answer unto it is usually as follows; A thing may be said to agree unto
another per se, either positively, (...) negatively.

1. (...), when it is predicated in primo, or secundo modo (...) per se, when
it is either an essential predicate, or proper passion: And thus it agrees
unto man to be a sensitive creature, to be endued with the powers of
understanding, willing, laughing, etc: And in this sense indifferency does not
agree per se, unto any humane voluntary actions, for then it would agree unto
them always, and in all places, so that it would be utterly impossible for the
individuals of such actions to be morally either good, or bad. 2. Negatively,
When a thing of it self is not such, although by accident it may be such: And
thus we may say of a man, that per se he is not white, he is not black, he is
not tawny, he is not of an olive color, or the like, because each of these
colors considered separately, are accidental unto the nature of man,
considered in the general, and in it self: And yet the individuals of the
nature of man may some of them be white, some black, some tawny, some of an
olive color, or the like: Even so we may say of diverse voluntary rational
actions of man; that per se, (considered, as divested from all circumstances)
they are indifferent, morally neither good, nor bad: because moral goodness
and badnesse is accidental unto the nature of such actions considered in
themselves, and yet the individuals of such actions are all of them either
good, or evil, (...) shall be cleared by the next conclusion, unto which before
we proceed, let us make some application of this second conclusion.
Against this doctrine of Indifferency there are two failings; one in the
(...), Another in the excess:

There are, First, some, that fail in the defect, who know not the full extent
of indifferency: and so either impose, as necessary, or condemn, as sinsull,
things that are in their own nature indifferent. Thus in the primitive Romish
Church there were some new converts, who abstained from swines flesh, and other
meats prohibited by the ceremonial law, as unlawful, The use of which yet was
indifferent and lawful under the Gospel: I know, and am persuaded (says
Paul,) by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of it self. Romans 14.
14. Thus also amongst the Corinthians there were some weak Christians, that
branded for Communion, and fellowship with Idolaters all eating of things
offered unto idols, Though bought in the market, or eaten at private meetings;
In both which yet Paul pronounces in general there was no unlawfulness, 1.
Cor. 10. 25, 27. Amongst us there are diverse persons, that are doubtless well
affected in matters of Religion, and yet are too rigid in censuring as sins
diverse innocent and harmless recreations: This is an error in, and
consequently a blemish unto the understanding: Paul calls it a weakness in the
faith, Romans 14. 1. that is an imperfection in point of knowledge, and that
privative, or blameable: For the faith and conscience of indifferent things is
never indifferent, we are never to judge a thing indifferent, to be either
sinful or necessary. Our Saviors command, John 7. 24. Judge righteous
judgment may be extended unto things and actions as well as persons: Therefore
as we are not to call good, evil, or evil, good; so neither are we to call
things indifferent, either evil, or necessary. This is injuriously to straiten
the grand Charter of our Christian liberty, and presumptuously to make the
narrow way to heaven narrower then ever God made it. Besides, it opens a
gappe unto many mischiefs, it fills the Church of God with needless, and
endless disputes, it perplexeth the minds of many conscientious people with
unnecessary and unprofitably scruples; it causes many bitter and uncharitable
censures, and occasioneth many dangers: In the believing Jews that lived in
the Church of Rome, in Paul's time, there was but a little mistake touching
things indifferent, meats and days; but how pernicious was the sequel hereof?
Hereupon the strong despised the weak, and the weak judged the strong, Romans
14. And this was a great disturbance unto the peace of the Church, and a great
hinderance unto the comfortable communion of the Saints.

2. Against this doctrine of indifferency there are some, secondly, that fail
in the excess, who make things necessary or sinful, to be but indifferent.
There be some, that hold observation of the Lords day, preaching of the word,
in distinction from mere reading of it to be no ordinances of God, but things
merely indifferent; Erastians affirm that Church Government, and
Ecclesiastical censures are only matters of indifferency: The Heathens in the
Apostles times generally ranked fornication amongst things indifferent: The
like estimate some of the Corinthians had of eating things offered to Idols, in
the midst of an Idols temple, at a religious feast of that Idol, which was a
palpable communicating with Devils, and therefore a fact in it is own nature
unlawful: And some Travailers, that profess themselves Protestants, have as
large and loose Consciences, as these Corinthians had; for they have the same
opinion of being present at an idolatrous mass, and bowing to popish Idols. Dr
Peter Heylin (as himself informs us) made no scruple of kissing a Crucifix,
when it was desired of him, to discriminate him from a Hugenot: No less loose
were the Principles of the Adiaphorists, and Flaccians in Charles the 5th his
time, who pressed the Interim, which gave allowance to diverse errors, and
superstitions of the Church of Rome, as matters that were indifferent: Our
Prelatists ever and anon in the controversy of Symbolicall ceremonies allege
their indifferency as a thing without dispute, which is never granted by us;
however it may sometimes for disputation sake be supposed. But what talk we of
Ceremonies, whilst some of greatest note among'st them have so eagerly pleaded
for such sports, and pastimes upon the Lords day as indifferent, which a devout
Papist would reckon a gross profanation thereof? Now this latter (...) against
the Doctrine of indifferent actions, in a way of excess, is as much against
the Purity of the Church, as the former sailing, in a way of defect, was
against the peace of the Church: It opens as wide a door to all licentiousness
and profaneness to call good and evil indifferent, as it does to call good
evil, or evil good, and therefore a woe equally belongs unto it with this
latter.

Secondly, we may be exhorted unto thankfulness, Because God has indulged us
Christians a greater extent of our liberty about things indifferent, then he
ever (...) unto the Jewish Synagogue. Many things, in their own nature
indifferent, were prohibited them by positive precepts, and so made unlawful
unto them; This was a yoke (said Peter,) which they were unable to bear, Acts
15. 10. Blessed therefore be God, who has freed us from this yoke by our Lord
Jesus Christ, who has abolished in his flesh the law of Commandments contained
in Ordinances, Ephesians. 2. 15. So that now all (indifferent) things are lawful
unto us; There (...) nothing unclean of it self, Romans 14. 14. all things
indeed are pure, Romans 14. 20. Unto the pure all things are pure, Tit. 1. 15.
Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, 1 Timoth. 4. 4.

There be two ways, unto which I shall direct for expressing our thankfulness
for the enlargement of this our liberty. 1. A stout asserting of it. 2. A due
and (...) use of it.

1. A stout asserting of it against Judaisme, Popery, or any other sect or
party, that shall be so presumptuous toward God, and injurious toward us, as
to abridg us thereof in any part. Stand fast therefore in the liberty,
wherewith Christ has made us free, and be not entangled (...) with the yoke
of bondage, Gal. 5. 1. The Apostle would have us not to be entangled again
with the Jewish yoke of bondage; And there is the same reason, why in
indifferent things we should decline any other yoke of bondage, which any man
whatsoever should make, and attempt to put upon our necks: for liberty toward
things indifferent is one branch of that liberty, wherewith Christ has made us
free: and therefore we should stand (...) against all opposers. But now in this
our asserting of our Christian liberty we should use a great deal of
moderation toward weak dissenting brethren: It Is the Advice which the Apostle
Paul gives in the like case, Romans 14. 3. Let not him that eats, despise him,
that eats not: The eating of meats prohibited by the Mosaicall Law was after
Christ's death indifferent; But yet there were among the Romans some weaklings
in the faith, who thought the ceremonial law still in force, and consequently
judged, the eating of all meats therein forbidden, to be sinful; Now the
Apostle would not have those that were strong in the faith, that is, more
knowing, better principled, and more fully instructed in the extent of their
Christian liberty to despise, to disdain, and contemn those poor souls for
their ignorance, and weakness in judgment; But to reach out the right hand of
fellowship unto them, to receive them into an (...) communion, (...) deal
gently, and tenderly with them, restoring them in the spirit of meekness, with
all possible prudence, and caution: Him, that is weak in the faith, receive
you, but not to doubtful disputations, Romans 14. 1. The Apostle does not
prohibit altogether all disputations for the future touching the point in
controversy: for he himself elsewhere very zealously disputes the matter, only
he interdicts such disputes as were unseasonable for the present: because these
Jewish converts were so extremely wedded unto the Law of Moses, as that to have
pressed upon them in their first conversion an abolition thereof, was the ready
way to have utterly prejudiced them against and alienated them from
Christianity: He would have them first to be taught the first principles of the
Oracles of God, the first Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, Heb. 5. 12. and
chap. 6 verse. 1. And when they were well principled, and settled in the
Christian faith, then they might proceed to a calm, and peaceable debate of
this subject: for then their mind would be more capable of instruction, and the
forementioned prejudice would be more easily removed: Indeed, after a while,
there would be no place for such a prejudice: for when once there was a plenary
promulgation of the Gospel, to observe them afterward would be a virtuall
abrenunciation of the Christian Religion, a denial, that Christ is come in the
flesh: When once the Apostles had gived the Jewish Synagogue and Ceremonies an
honorable funeral, and respective burial, for any man afterward to revive
the observation of them, would be to rake in their dust, and sacrilegiously to
violate their grave: Proinde nunc quisquis Christianorum, quamvis sit ex
judaeis; similiter ea celebrare voluerit, tanquam sopitos cineres eruens, non
erit pius deductor vel baiulus corporis, sed impius sepulturae violator,
August: Epist. 19. A second way of expressing our thankfulness for the
extension of our Christian liberty in things indifferent is a due and discreet
use of it, such an use of it as may st, and with Gods glory, and may (...) no
ways inconsistent with our own or others edification. Touching this use of our
liberty Paul gives us a general caution, Gal. 5. 13. only use not liberty for
an occasion unto the flesh; that is, to live according unto the flesh. Suitable
unto which also is the advice of St Peter, 1 Pet. 2. 16. not using your liberty
for a (...) of maliciousness, But as the servants of God: In which advice
there are two parts: On enegative: not using your liberty for a cloak of
maliciousness: that is, for a color or pretense unto any sin for (...) is
(as Dr (...) well observes) taken here more largly for all manner of evil and
naughtiness, according unto the adequate signification of the Greek and Latin
Adjectives, from whence the substantive used in the text is derived. Another
part of the advice is affirmative, using your liberty as the servants of God:
that is in the use of this liberty admit of nothing, that may be prejudicial
unto the service, unto the honor and glory of God: for this would be a most
unthankful abuse, and not a true use of it.
To inform us more fully, and particularly what we are to do in this weighty
point, I shall briefly propound such restraints, as we are by the rule of
Scripture to put on the use, and exercise of our Christian liberty in things
indifferent, for without such restraints we can never use this our liberty
aright, and as we ought: There be some loose people, that are impatient of all
these restraints: If they judge a thing lawful in it self, they never
consider, or consult farther, but without more a do adventure on it: But these
men ever and anon abuse their liberty unto Gods dishonor, their own danger,
and the scandal of both brethren, and aliens: They use their liberty as an
(...) to the flesh, for a (...) of maliciousness: He that gives himself the
full swing in things indifferent, He that will do whatsoever is lawful, will
(...) (...) into things unlawful, and ere he is aware indulge himself in the
practice of them (...) So Clemens, Alexandrinus (...). 1. Qui faciunt quicquid
(...), huc cito (...), ut faciant quod non (...). (...) prevention of this
licentiousness, I shall out of Gods word recommend unto you (...) restraints
to be put upon this part of your (...) liberty in the use and exercise of it,
(...). By Prudence. 2. By Temperance and (...). 3. By Conscience. 4. By
Religion. 5. By Authority. 6. By Charity,

1. By Prudence: which in indifferent things is, first, to compare them with
those ends which every Christian should aim at. 2. To consider whether there
concur not an obligation to some duty, or other.
First then, It is the work of Christian prudence to compare indifferent
actions with those ends, which every Christian should propound unto himself:
the glorifying of God, the salvation of his own soul, and the edifying of
Brethren: And to examine whether they be expedient, or inexpedient, profitable
and conducing, or unprofitable and impedient unto these ends: And if upon due
consideration it finds them inexpedient, an hinderance unto these ends, it then
forthwith dictates a forbearance of them: Because whatsoever is (...)
impediment unto these ends is opposite unto them, and in that regard sinful:
This restraint our Apostle lays down in way of Doctrine for the instruction
of all. All things are lawful for me, But all things are not expedient, 1 Cor.
6. 12. and Chapt 9. we have him putting it upon himself in his own practice:
It was lawful for him to have received of the Corinthians a competent, and
honorable maintenance, for his labor in the Word and Doctrine, as being a
matter of due debt from them: But he did not exact it, but wrought with his
hands for his livelihood, because he found it would have obstructed, and
hindered the end of his preaching, which was the spreading of the Gospel, that
the word of the Lord might have free course, and be glorified in the conversion
of souls.

A second act of Prudence about indifferent things is to consider, whether in
that nicke of time we are about an indifferent action there concur not an
obligation unto some duty or other; And if there do, then prudence dictates,
that pro hic and nunc, we should abstain from that indifferent action; because
otherwise we should prefer it above a necessary and commanded duty, And
though it be simply in it self lawful, it would become accidentally sinful,
to wit, by comparison; Thus it would be sinful for a man to walk in the
fields, if there lay upon him at the same time an obligation to hear such a
sermon: Thus also it would be sinful for a man to follow recreations in
themselves lawful, when the necessities of his family call upon him to follow
his occupation, the works of his ordinary calling.

A second Restraint (that we are to put upon the use of our liberty about
things indifferent) is by temperance and sobriety, and this restraint also we
have laid down by the Apostle in the place but now quoted. 1. Cor. 6. 12. All
things are lawful for me, But I will not be brought under the power of any:
Now what is it that brings a man under the power of meats, and drinks,
apparel, recreations. (...) but an over-vehement affection unto them. This
makes man a vassal unto those things, over which God has given him a full
Lordship, and dominion: Qui nimis (...) aliquam amat (says Aquinas) quodam
modo servus istius efficitur, He that loves a thing overmuch, renders himself
thereby the servant thereof: Know ye not that to whom ye yield your selves
servants to obey, his servants ye are, to whom ye obey, Romans 6. 16. He that
immoderately affects those things, that are in themselves indifferent, cannot
disobey, or resist the least temptation unto sin drawn from them, and
therefore is no better then a slave unto them, nay an Idolater of them: You may
see how Paul censures the false Prophets for such an excess, Romans 16. 18. They
that are such serve not our Lord (...) Christ, but their own (...), Their God
is their belly Phil. 3. 19. We may say the like of those, that like the rich
glutton, Luke. 16. 19. fare sumptuously or deliciously every day, and will have
a splendid retinue, when the lowness of their state requires a meaner table
and smaller attendance of those that are wedded unto such gaiety and bravery of
apparel as is above their purses, or unsuitable unto their age, and rank, As
also of those that are so mad upon their recreations, sports and pastimes, as
that in the pursuit of them they forgo their meals, and sleep, they neglect
the worship of God, and their particular callings, unto their great
impoverishment, if not final and total beggary.

A third limitation upon the exercise of our Christian liberty in things
indifferent is to be by conscience: for though a man's conscience cannot
legitimate sins, either of Commission, or Omission; yet it is of force
sufficient to make that sinful, which is in it self indifferent, and lawful:
for this we have the Apostles determination, and that touching both a
condemning and doubting conscience.

1. A Condemning Conscience. Romans 14. 14. I know and am persuaded by the Lord
Jesus, that their is nothing unclean of it self; But unto him that esteems
any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. Unto the authority of Paul's
Testimony I shall add two reasons.

1. Every man takes the voice of his conscience to be the voice of God; And
therefore he that does a thing in it self indifferent against the judgment of
his Conscience, he disobeyeth and slighteth the voice of God, as for the manner
of his action, and is a fighter against God.

A second reason I shall give you in the words of Willet upon the place,
Because the goodness or badnesse of an action is esteemed by the will and
affection of the doer; Now when he thinks a thing to be (...), and yet does
it, It shows that such an one has, deliberatam (...) voluntatem, a (...) mind
and purpose to sin.

The Apostle, secondly, gives us the same resolution touching a Doubting (...),
Romans 14. 23. He that doubts, is damned if he eat, because he eats not of
faith; for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin: that is; he that performs an
indifferent action, and yet doubts of the lawfulness thereof, deserves
damnation, because he does not act out of faith; for whatsoever we perform,
though, it be ( intrinsecally, in it self) matter of indifferency; nay though
it be matter of duty, yet if it proceed not from a belief of it is lawfulness
it becomes ( accidentally and extrinsecally) sinful; It bewrayes a wicked and
a wretched heart, that is not afraid of sin, but in a great readiness to
commit it; who, almost would do any thing that he doubts would anger and
grieve a dear friend? God then is not so dear as he should be unto such men,
as dare adventure upon the practice of that, which they are doubtful is
displeasing unto him: Let us therefore hearken unto that exhortation, which the
Apostle gave unto the Romans concerning things indifferent, Romans 14. 5. Let
every man be fully persuaded in his own (...): And this exhortation he backs
with a very good reason. ver. 22. Happy is he which condemns not himself in
that thing which he allows: that is, he that does not condemn as sinful,
that which he chooses and embraces in his practice; such a man is in that
respect, and so far forth happy, as being free from those (...), which
torment those, who do what their consciences condemn.

Thus you see, that not only condemnation, but doubtfulnesse of Conscience is a
sufficient warrant to forbear things that are in themselves indifferent: But
yet it is no ground for us to assume a liberty of condemning the same things in
others, who are sufficiently satisfied touching their indifferency and
lawfulness: Let not him that eats not judge him that eats. (...) 14. 3.
Let not him that is weak in the faith, that out of ignorance censureth, (...)
suspecteth diverse actions (...) be sinful, (...) he cannot prove to be so by
any convincing argument; Let not such an one condemn for such actions the
strong in the faith, those who are as godly and more knowing, then themselves:
This exhortation the Apostle enforces by diverse reasons in the following
words; for God has received him; who art thou, that judge another man's
servant? To his own (...) he stands or (...), yea, he shall be holden up;
for God is able to make him stand, ver. 3. 4.

The first argument is taken from the relation of the strong unto God, or Gods
acceptance of them; for God has received him; to wit, into his favor, into
an intimate union, and communion, into his family, as a servant, as a son, as
a member of his only begotten son: To condemn him then is to throw a
dishonor upon God himself.

A second reason is, Because for the weak to condemn the indifferent actions
of the strong for sin, of which they cannot prove them guilty, is a gross
and presumptuous usurpation of Gods prerogative, for which we have no
Authority: who art thou that judge another man's servant? Thou art but a
fellow servant at the most: And God only is the master of the family, the
Church: and therefore the unlawfulness of what is done in it is to be
determined by Gods precepts, and not by thy humor, or fancy, thy ungrounded
surmises: If God has permitted a thing, how dare thou interdict it? To his
own master he stands, or falls. The words are to be understood in a
law-sense, and their meaning is that God alone acquits or condemns the actions
of his servants, and none else: They are to be tried by his word and will, and
not by thy jealousies, and suspicions. Others expound the words thus: If a man
eat and drink temperately with outward prayer and thanksgiving, who but God can
discern, whether he eat or drink unto the glory of God, or no? It follows he
shall be holden up: that is, he shall be justified. This fact of his, his
eating of meats forbidden by the Leviticall Law, shall be abetted and
maintained: For God is able to make him stand: though thou load him with
censures, God is able to acquit, and clear him.

4thly. Our Christian liberty toward things indifferent must admit of a
restraint in the outward practice of it By Religion, by the Religion of a vow,
of an oath, Deuteronomy. 23. verse. 21, 22, 23. When thou shall vow a vow unto the Lord
thy God, thou shall not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely
require it of thee, and it would be sin in thee. But if thou shall forbear
to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. That which is gone out of thy lips, thou
shall keep, and perform: even a free will (...), according as thou have vowed
unto the Lord thy God, which thou have promised with thy mouth. It was
indifferent for Ananias to have sold, or held his possession: But when once by
solemn vow he had devoted it unto God, to keep back any part of the price in
his own hand, was no less then sacrilege: Suppose Lusory lots be in
themselves lawful, yet if a man swear, that he will never play more at Cards,
or Tables, etc. By this Oath a man has bound himself from such games for the
future: and if he play at them, he shall incur the guilt of perjury: Numb.
30. v. 2. If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an Oath to bind his soul
with a bond, he shall not break his word, he shall do according unto all that
proceeds out of his mouth. Calvinist's about oath's concerning things
indifferent have this case: Whether they be obligatory in trifles? As if a man
should swear to lift up a straw, to rub his beard, to give an apple, to lend a
pin unto a Child: This case Casus posterior est, cum res aut ob sui
levitatemindigna est viri prudentis deliberatione, nec cassa nuce interest
(...) an non feceris, ut levare festucam de (...), fricare barbam etc. aut ob
parvitatem (...) non estmultum estimabilis; ut dare pomum puero, aciculam (...)
etc. Juramentum de re isto (...) adiaphora omnino est illicitum. Arguit enim
sancti nominis Dei aut nimiam irreverentiam, si (ut (...) fit) ex quodam (...)
jurandi longo usu contracto (...) forte exciderit; aut apertum contemptum,
siquis id (...) prudensque admiserit, scilicet non est Deus advocandus testis,
nisi ubi dignus vindice nodus inciderit: ubi causa exigit non justa modo sed
and gravis. Et in hoc omnes consentiunt, caeterum de obligatione quid (...)?
Video quidem plerosque casuistas pontificios in (...) esse (...) juramentum de
re (...) et parvi momenti esse (...) natura nullum, and non (...) quia (...)
(...) levis non est idonea materia juramenti, and lex non curat de miminis. Sed
miror potuisse eos, qui alias videri volunt esse tam Lyncei, inretam (...)
(...): nisi quod putidae illi distinctioni (...) mortalis and venialis, quo
velut fermento totam Theologiae moralis massam faede corruperunt, locum
relictum cupiant. Sed obligare juramentum in re vel levissimi momenti constat;
primo, quia in re gravi and levi eadem est veritatis and falsitatis ratio.
Secundo, quia in assertorio juramento, qui (...) dicit quam res est, etsi in re
levissima, pejerat, ergo a simili and in promissorio, qui (...) facit, quam
juravit. Tertio, quia (...), quantum in se esset, Deum (...) rei testem
faceret. (...), quia omnis jurans tenetur facere totum quod promisit, (...)
potest, and licet: sed dare puero pomum, and (...) est, and licitum, ergo
tenetur praestare, non debuit ergo sie (...): sed ubi iuratum est, debet
impleri. De Jurament: Obligat: praelect: 3. Sect. 15.
Dr Sanderson thus answers. 1. He premiseth that such oath's are unlawful,
Because in them Gods most Holy Name is taken in vain, The Great God of Heaven
and Earth is appealed unto, and called upon to witness unto toys: But yet
notwithstanding his resolution is, that such oath's bind; and for it he gives
four reasons.

1. Truth and falsehood have place in a light, as well as in a serious matter.
2. Because in an assertory Oath, He that says otherwise then the thing is,
though it be in a most trivial matter, is forsworn: therefore by the like
reason, he is perjured in a promissory oath, that does otherwise, then he has
sworn. 3. Because Otherwise, he that has taken such an oath, should make God
as much as in him lies the witness of a falsehood. 4. Because every one that
swears, is bound to do all that he has sworn, so far forth as he is able,
and so far forth as the thing is lawful to be done: But the matters here
spoken of are possible and lawful, v. gr. it is possible and lawful to give a
child an apple, etc. therefore such oath's are to be performed: Indeed such
vain oath's should not be taken, but being once taken they ought to be
fulfilled.
A fifth restraint upon the exercise of our Christian liberty in things
indifferent is by the just commands of authority, unto which we must be subject
for conscience sake, Romans 13. v. 5. The Apostle Peter having, 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14.
exhorted us to submit our selves unto every ordinance of man for the Lords
sake; In verse. 16. (by the general consent of interpreters) he prevents an
objection, that might be made against this submission, from our Christian
liberty, As free, and not using your liberty for a Cloak of maliciousness,
but as the servants of God: Upon which words it is well observed by Estius (out
of Oecumenius and Chrysostom) that, As (...) is to be construed with (...),
submit your selves: And not (as Bede would have it) with well doing. And from
this connection we may learn two things.

First, That in submission unto every ordinance of man, we must not infringe
our Christian liberty: We must not enslave our selves to sin, Satan, and the
World.

Secondly, That submission unto every Ordinance of man, and our Christian
freedom may very well stand together: We may submit our selves as free: we may
be obedient subjects, and yet free Christians: This may also be further
gathered from what the Apostle has in the following words touching the abuse,
and use of our Christian liberty; Not using your liberty as a cloak for
maliciousness, but as servants of God: Here we have. 1. A dehortation from the
abuse of our Christian liberty, not using your liberty as a cloak of
maliciousness: now to allege it as a plea for exemption of us from the yoke
of temporal dominion, is to use it as a cloak of maliciousness; for not
only scripture, but even nature it self condemns disobedience unto, and
rebellion against magistrates, as a very High point of maliciousness, that is
naughtiness, and wickedness.

2. We have here a Direction unto a right use of our liberty, using it as the
servants of God: Now the service of God is so far from being a bar, as that
it is rather a spur unto this subjection; for First; it is for the Lords
sake, that Peter would have us to submit our selves unto every ordinance of
man, verse. 13. Secondly, How can he cordially serve God, that contemnes and
disobeyes his deputy, and ministers? so the Apostle styles the magistrate, Romans
13. 4, 6. And Thirdly, The servants of God are obliged to yield obedience unto
all his commands, and one of them is to be subject unto the higher powers, Romans
13. 1. They then that resist the higher powers do not use their liberty as the
(...) of God.

But now, (that we may not run into another extreme, and with the flatterers
of (...), and Princes, extol the power of the magistrate beyond all bounds of
moderation;) I shall desire you to take notice, that the power of the
magistrate in things indifferent is not arbitrary, but is to be limited by the
end of all (...), the public good, Romans 13. 4. He is the Minister of God unto
thee for good. Unto this public good some indifferent things carry a tendency,
and such the magistrate may command; unto it others may be prejudicial, and
such he may forbid: But now he should abuse his power, and play the tyrant, If
he should injoyne things unprofitable; As if he should command men to throw
stones into the water, to pick strawes, to scatter feathers into the air, or
the like. By this you may see, that the legislative power of the temporal
magistrate in things indifferent is not unlimited: But now as for
Ecclesiastical superiors, They have no commission for to make any laws
properly so called. To make this good Ames quotes Junius against Bellarmine, [
cont. 3. lib. 4. cap. 16. n. 86, 87. and chap. 17. n. 9, 10, 12, 13.] where he
shows, that Christ is the only lawgiver, that appoints things in his
Church; and that he has appointed all that are requisite, and that the Church
makes no laws (properly so called) to appoint any new things to be used, but
only canons, orders, directions, ordering in seemly manner these things which
Christ has appointed: and that if she add any thing of her own, she does
decline: And the reason is, Because unto her is committed no authority of
appointing new things, but a ministry to observe, and (...) such things which
Christ has appointed.

[ This argument is prosecuted at large By Ames in his Reply unto Morton chap.
1. Sect. 16. and vindicated in his fresh suit against Ceremonies, page 64, 65,
66. usque ad 71. from the rejoinder of Dr John Burgess.]

The sixth and last restraint, which I shall mention, that is to be put upon
the outward exercise of our Christian liberty in things indifferent is by
Charity: and that. 1. Unto our selves. 2. Unto others.

1. Unto our selves: He that truly loves himself, will deny himself the use
of things indifferent, if he think it will hazard the health of his better
part, his spiritual and immortal soul; He will (...) those sports, and
Pastimes he most delights in, if he find that they usually tempt him to Choler,
or covetousness: He will not so much as step into a Tavern, Inn, or
Alehouse, if he find himself prone unto excess: According unto the advice,
that Solomon gives in the like case, Prove. 23. 2. Put a (...) unto thy throat,
if thou be a man given unto appetite: Our Savior exhorts us to pluck out our
right eye, and to cut off our right hand, when they offend us, Matthew. 5. 29,
30. And Maldonate supposes that he speaks literally of a true eye and hand
indeed: neither (says he) is there any absurdity in such a sense: because the
plucking out of the right eye, and the cutting off the right hand is mentioned
only in a way of hyperbolicall exaggeration. In which there is understood such
an exception, as is usual in the like cases, if it might be, if it were
lawful: He parallels it with a hyperbole of the same nature in Gal. 4. 15. I
bear you record, that if it had been (...), yet would have plucked out your own
eyes, and have given them unto me; If it had been possible: that is, as Estius
(...) it, si natura (...), If nature would give way unto such a mutilation: Our
Savior therefore signifies, that we must incur the greatest loss, rather
then expose our selves unto the danger of sin: And from this we may conclude
that we must cast away our most beloved indifferences; when once they
scandalize us, that is, when they prove occasions of, and incentives unto
sin. 2. Charity toward others should put a restraint upon the use of our
Christian liberty in things indifferent, and make us to forbear all
indifferent things whatsoever, that may destroy the souls, weaken, or wound
the (...) of others, 1 Cor. 8. 12. Use not liberty for an occasion to the
flesh, but by love serve one another, Gal. 5. 13. Where the Antithesis implied
in the particle, but, plainly shows, that we use our liberty for an occasion
unto the flesh, if we do not by love serve one another, in the exercise
thereof. Knowledge (...) up, but charity edifieth. 1 Cor. 8. 1. that is, a firm
and full knowledge of our liberty in things indifferent, ifit be separated from
Charity, is apt to swell the mind with pride, and make men to despise, or set
at naught weak, doubting, and scrupulous Brethren; But Charity edifieth, that
is it is careful to build up others, as living stones in the spiritual house
of God, the Church; It inclines to promote their graces, and gracious
practices, and to avoid whatsoever is of a destroying nature unto their
souls, that is, every thing that may occasion their fall into sin: Now that
indifferent things may sometimes be of an unedifying and destroying nature, the
Apostle affirms 1 Cor. 10. 23. All things are lawful for me, but all things
edisie not, do not build up our brethren in truth, faith, and holiness, do not
farther them in their Religion, charity, and justice: for that the Apostle
speaks of the edification of others is plain by what follows in the next
verse, Let no man seek his own (that is, only) but every man another wealth,
that is, spiritual, the edification and salvation of another soul. And
therefore indifferent things are to be forborne in case of scandal, when they
prove to be of a destructive nature unto the souls of men, when they weaken
their graces, hinder their duties, and lead them into sin. This course the
Apostle prescribes unto the Romans in the case of things legally unclean
before the coming of Christ. Those that were strong in the faith among them,
well instructed in the doctrine of Christian liberty, knew very well, that the
legal uncleanesse of meats and drinks, all Jewish festivalls and fasts were
removed by Christ's death, and that nothing was now of it self unclean, but
all things indifferent and lawful: yet the Apostle would have them in the use
of this point of Christian liberty not to scandalize those, that are weak in
the faith, that is, such as (being newly won from Judaisme to Christianity)
were as yet uninstructed about the cessation of Ceremonialls, Romans 14. 13.
Judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block, or occasion, to fall in
his brothers way; that is in the use of meats and drinks, that were before the
Gospel Levitically unclean, and neglect of Jewish Festivalls and fasts, the
observation of which was for a while indifferent, until the interrement of the
Ceremonial law: (...) however the words run generally, yet if we look to the
coherence backwards, the foregoing part of the chapter speaks only of such
things, meats, drinks, and days: and if we look to the coherence forwards,
it speaks only of such things, meats and drinks, verse. 15. Destroy not him
with thy meat, for whom Christ died, ver. 17. for the kingdom of God is not
meat and drink. v. 20. for meat destroys not the work of God: it is evil
for that man who eats with offense: It is (...) not simply in it self, but
accidentally by scandal. And therefore I shall conclude, that the place is in
a special manner appliable against scandalizing by abuse of liberty in things
indifferent.
Interpreters guess at three things, wherein the practice of the strong
amongst the Romans might scandalize the weak.

1. It might unsettle them in, and distaste them against the Christian Religion:
for they might hereupon think it to be contrary unto the Law of Moses, which
they so highly reverenced, and so at last it might occasion their relapse unto
Judaisme. 2. It might embolden them to sin against their consciences, by
eating that which they thought to be unclean. And 3dly, it might grievously
exassperate them, and provoke them to power out many a bitter, uncharitable;
and sinful censure upon the actions, and state of those that were strong in
the faith.

In verse. 21. The Apostle proceeds to enlarge his doctrine touching this
particular, beyond the controversy, that occasioned this his discourse: for (as
Estius well notes) He teaches, that to avoid the scandal and offense of our
Brethren we are to abstain, not only from things prohibited by the law, but
also from things not prohibited, from flesh, wine, and any indifferent thing
whatsoever: It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing
whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. It is good,
that is, it is morally good. 1. Good in regard of God, a thing very acceptable,
and pleasing unto him. 2. Good in regard of our Brethren, profitable and
conducing unto their edification. 3. Good in regard of our selves, a duty that
God requires of us: And from this we may infer that the contrary hereof is
(by the rule of contraries) morally evil: it is displeasing unto God, hurtful
unto the soul of thy Brother, and sinful in thy self.

In verse. 22. The Apostle prevents an objection of the strong: Have thou faith,
have it to thy self before God: He speaks not of a faith (says Chrysostom)
that is (...) of doctrines and tenets, to wit, such as are fundamental, and
necessary unto salvation: but of a faith, (...), concerning the subject matter
here handled, meats, and days, things indifferent, a belief touching their
lawfulness: the strong amongst the Romans might be ready to object, that their
knowledge and persuasion of their Christian liberty in the matter controverted
amounted unto a Divine faith: for it was built upon a divine Revelation: Each
of them might say as Paul did above verse. 14. I know, and am persuaded by the
Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of it self. The Lord Jesus has taught me
this liberty now is it not fit, that my practice should be agreeable unto my
belief; that I should exercise my knowledge, and act according unto my
judgment: seeing it is so well grounded, why should I forbear the doing of
that, which I know to be lawful? Unto this the Apostles answer is, that they
should not make a vain ostentation, or unseasonable discovery of their faith:
that is, knowledge, and persuasion, unto the offense of their Brother, the
hazard of his soul: but rather in such a case conceal it, and content
themselves with Gods knowledge, and approbation of it, who sees in secret, and
will reward openly, Matthew. 6. Have thou faith, have it to thy self before God:
This prudent and charitable management of Christian liberty, the Apostle
exhorts the Corinthians unto, in their carriage toward their Brethren touching
things offered unto Idols. 1 Cor. 8. 9. take heed lest, by any means this
liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak. In Chapt. 10.
he determines, that it was lawful to eat things consecrated to the Idols, and
he instanceth in two cases. 1. When they were sold in open markets. verse. 25.
2ly, When they were made use of at private feasts: But unto this his
determination he subjoyneth the exception of scandal, verse. 28. 29. If any man
say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not, for his sake
that showed it, and for conscience sake; The earth is the Lords and the
fullness thereof. Conscience; I say, (...) thine own, but of the others: for
why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? This some understand of
the unbelieving Idolater, others of a weak brother: And indeed this practice
gives an wound unto both their consciences. 1. The Idolater triumphs, because
he thinks it an honor unto his Idol, and so he is confirmed, and hardened in
his Idolatry: And then, 2ly, As for the weak Brother, he supposes, that the
meat is so polluted by Consecration and sacrifice (...) Idols, as that to eat
thereof is a compliance with Idolatry; and therefore altogether sinful; and
hereupon the eating of these meats by the strong may occasion in the weak two
scandalls. 1. The example of the strong may entice them unto imitation; and so
they will sin against their consciences. 2ly, The practice of the strong may
provoke them unto rash and uncharitable judgment: both scandals give a great
blow unto the Conscience of the weak: But, that the Apostle speaks of the
latter scandal, I am induced to think by the words following: Why is my
liberty judged of another man's Conscience? that is, why do I needlessely,
indiscreetly, and unseasonably expose my Christian liberty unto the rash
censures of a weak Brother, who may be ready to traduce it, as a profane
licentiousness? why shall I drive him upon a sin, which I may prevent by a
prudent and charitable forbearance of the exercise of my liberty? Liberty is a
thing, which men out of an excessive self love so much overvalue, as that they
are very impatient of any restraint to be put upon it at all: But the
Restraint, that Charity prompts us unto, is of all others most disregarded;
because there is nothing almost, that is so much undervalued, as the precious
souls of our poor Brethren, and therefore we make but little conscience how
thick we throw scandals in their way: I shall therefore briefly propound such
weighty, and pressing arguments, as the Apostle uses to persuade the Romans,
and Corinthians to abstain from a scandalous use of their liberty in things
otherwise indifferent, and lawful: and they are drawn, either, from the nature
of things indifferent, or from the nature of scandal.

1. From the nature of things indifferent: and here, the first argument is Romans
14. 17. the kingdom of God is not meat and drink: It does not stand in
indifferent things; for they are neither the way to the kingdom of Glory, nor
our duty under the kingdom of grace: They are no part of Gods worship, and
service, no matter of Religion: the weal and safety of Gods people is in no
wise wrapped up in them; nay, many times a rigid pressing, and unseasonable
practice of them is a great disturbance unto the peace, and a great hinderance
unto the edification of the Church, the kingdom of Christ.

A second Argument from the nature of things indifferent, is the great latitude
of (...): Though some of them be scandalous yet there will still remain an
ample field of them besides, 1 Cor. 10. 28. If any man say unto you, this is
offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake, that showed it, etc. the
earth is the Lords, and the fullness thereof: It is as much as if he had said;
though ye abstain from things offered unto idols, yet there is no doubt of
want, no fear of pinching your bellies: for you have the earth, and the
fullness thereof for your supply: And from the scandal by meats, we may argue
in like manner touching the scandal by recreation: If cards, dyce, tables
offend thy brother, there is plenty enough of other sports, bowling, chesse,
draughts, etc.

A second sort of arguments, that the Apostle insists on, are taken from the
nature of scandal: It is a sin against that tender love, which we owe unto
our brethren: And when ye sin so against the brethren, 1 Cor. 8. 12. (And
that it is no small, but a very heinous sin, the next words evince) And wound
their weak conscience, The words are (...), where (as Beza well observes,)
the Antecedent is put for the consequent, beating, striking, or smiting for the
effect thereof, wounding: As weapons or whips wound the body; so scandalls the
conscience. Unjustly to wound the body, the face, the eye of our Brother is a
cruel and inhumane part; but to wound so tender a piece as his conscience, to
wound a weak, a sickly, a diseased conscience is the very height of
inhumanity. To wound the soul of a Brother with sorrow, is a breach of
charity; If thy Brother be grieved with thy meat, now walk thou not
charitably, Romans 14. 15. And hence we may reason in a way of comparison a
minori ad majus, that to wound the soul of a Brother with sin, violates
Christian love in a far higher measure; for the wound of the least sin is
in its own nature mortal; and therefore scandal is not only of a wounding,
but of a killing and destroying nature; it is a soul murder, Destroy not him
with thy meat, Romans 14. 15. Indeed the weak, that were scandalized, might by
Gods mercy, and Christ's merit, escape an actual destroying and damning: But
the Apostles meaning is, that the strongs scandalizing of them carried in it is
nature a tendency toward their destruction: for it drew them into sin, and
sin without repentance will destroy the soul: This malignant and destructive
efficacy of scandal the Apostle urges also unto the Corinthians Epistle 1.
chapt. 8. v. 11. And through thy knowledge shall thy weak brother perish: that
is; through thy scandalous abuse of thy knowledge of thy liberty in eating
things offered unto idols, thou shall do, what lies in thee, to farther the
perishing of thy weak Brother: This cruelty that is in scandal toward the
souls of our Brethren, is aggravated from Christ's Redemption, Gods Creation of
their souls.

1. From Christ's Redemption of their souls: Destroy not him with thy meat for
whom Christ died, Romans 14. 15. And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother
perish, for whom Christ died? But when ye sin so against the Brethren, and
wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ: 1 Cor. 8. 11, 12. In the
judgment of charity thou art to rank thy weak Brother in the number of those,
for whom Christ dyed: Christ died for his salvation, and how dare thou oppose
his work by doing that, which tends unto his damnation? Christ parted with his
life to save him, and wilt not thou for that end abridg thy self of thy
liberty in a few indifferent things. 2. From Gods creation of their souls: for
meat destroy not the work of God, Romans 14. 20. that is the soul of thy
brother: for that is styled Gods work in a way of (...): because it was one of
the choycest, chiefest, and most eminent works of the Creation, made as it
were with the consultation of the whole Trinity, and had in it engraven the
very Image of God himself: Therefore not only the defacing, but the very
attempting to deface this would redound very much unto the dishonor of the
worker God; And he will doubtless accordingly resent the despising of his
workmanship: Some interpreters expound the place of the work of Gods grace in
the sanctification, or regeneration of the soul, wherein faith is begotten,
and that faith in a peculiar manner is the work of God, we have Christ's own
testimony, John 6. 29. Jesus answered, and said unto them, this is the work of
God, that ye believe on him, whom he has sent: But even so the words display
the horrid malignancy of scandal: for they show that he who scandalizeth his
brother, fights against God; that he goes about to demolish that, which has
God alone for the builder. It was a part of Christ's character not to break a
bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax, Mat. 12. 20. How unsuitable unto
this, is the disposition of those by whom offenses come? For they do what
lies in them to quench the very beginnings of grace, and goodness. Indeed the
work of Gods grace is so all-powerfull, as that it will finally prevail
against all resistance: If God have begun a good work, he will perform it
until the day of Jesus Christ, Phil. 1. 6. And the gates of hell shall never
be able to prevail against it, Matthew. 16. 18. But yet the gates of hell will
be ever hindering of it: and in especial by the spreadth of scandals: And this
very opposition is a war against heaven, (in the language of the Scripture) a
destroying of the work of God. There is one sequel more of active scandals of
this nature, that our Apostle mentions, Romans 14. and 1 Cor. 10. which
deserves also our consideration: and it is the blot of infamy, which they will
contract unto our names, and the very Christian liberty, which we abuse: A
scandal in this case, tending unto sin, is usually accompanied with a
scandal tending unto disgrace, or defamation: And how careful we should be to
decline scandal, even in this English sense of the word, the vehemence of the
Apostles interrogations will sufficiently inform us, 1 Cor. 10. 29, 30.
Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the others: for why is my liberty
judged (...) man's conscience? for, if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil
spoken of, for that for which I give thanks? Unto these interrogations add we
the Apostles precept also, Romans 14. 16. Let not then your good be evil spoken
of: that is, give none occasion for this great privilege of your Christian
liberty to be traduced.
Before I take my leave of this restraint of our liberty by Charity in the case
of scandal, I shall examine the restraints, that some have put upon it,
without any warrant from scripture: Those in which they most confide, are two.
1. They limit it unto the scandal of the weak, and, 2. Unto matters that are
undetermined by Authority.

1. (...) limit it unto the scandal of the weak: for the scandal of the
malicious, and presumptuous persons, The scandal of Pharisees (say they) may be
neglected, Mat. 15. 12, 14. whether in our Ceremonies there was an active
scandal, a scandal given will be largely disputed in the next treatise, for
the present therefore we shall only prove that we are to avoid such an active
scandal in the malicious, as well as the weak.

For First, Such a scandal is of soul destroying nature: Destroy net him with
thy meat, Romans 14. 15. And who so wicked, and malicious upon the face of the
earth, whose soul a true Christian charity will exclude from it is care, mercy,
and compassion.

(...), The Apostles motive reaches unto the wicked and malicious: Destroy not
him with thy meat, for whom Christ died, Romans 14. 15. for they may be in the
number of those, for whom Christ died, who for their present state and
condition may be most wicked, and malicious; such as oppose themselves, such as
are in the snare of the Devil, taken captive by him at his will.

3. The Apostles prohibition, 1 Cor. 10. 32. extends unto the malicious, as
well as the weak, Give none offense neither to the (...), nor to the Gentiles,
nor to the Church of God: where Jews and Gentiles are distinguished from the
Church of God; and therefore by them are meant such as were unconverted, and as
yet enemies unto the faith of Christ, and Church of God. And the things wherein
the (...) would have their offense to be avoided were matters of indifferency;
Whether ye cat or drink, (...). 31. But now, lest some should be ready to
object unto Paul that which our Savior said of the Scribes and Pharisees,
Matthew. 23. 4. that he did bind a heavy burden and grievous to be (...), and lay
it upon men's shoulders: but he himself would not move it with one of his
fingers: the Apostle in the next verse shows, how that his practice was
conformable unto his precept, Even as I please all men (good and bad) in all
things (that is, in all indifferent things) not seeking mine own profit, but
the profit of many that they may be saved, 1 Cor. 10. 33.

In a second place, the Fautors of our Ceremonies limit this restraint of our
liberty in things indifferent by charity, in the case of scandal, only unto
things undetermined by Authority. Where Authority has determined our choice,
we must (say they) hold to their determination, any scandal to the Contrary
notwithstanding. It seems then in case the magistrate command it, we may wound
the weak consciences of our Brother, Destroy with our indifferencies, the
work of God, him for whom Christ died. It is good (says Paul) neither to eat
flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother stumbleth, or is
offended, or is made (...), Romans 14. 22. But our (...) determine quite
otherwise, if authority enjoyne it, it is good (say they) to eat bread, drink
wine, we are a surpliee, use the sign of the (...) in Baptism, though thereby
never so many Brethren stumble, or are offended, or made weak.

The unreasonablenesse of this assertion Ames in his reply to Morton has
proved by many arguments, That are as yet unanswered, which I shall here
transcribe.

A scandal in the nature of it is spiritual murder: Now suppose a superior
should command a thing in it self indifferent, whereupon murder were like to
follow, as to run a horse, or a cart, in a certain way, at a certain time,
when it may be unwitting to the commander, little children were playing in the
way, would any man's conscience serve him to do it?

Avoiding of scandal is a maine duty of Charity: May Superiors at their
pleasure appoint how far I shall show my Charity toward my brothers soul?
Then surely an inferior earthly court may cross the determinations of the
high court of heaven.

The superiors have no power given them for destruction, but only for (...):
If therefore they command scandals, they go beyond their Commission: neither
are we tied therein to do as they bid, but as they should bid.

If determination by superiors were sufficient to take away the sin of a
scandal. Then they do very ill that they do not (so far as is possible)
determine all things indifferent, that so no danger may be left in giving of
offense by the use of them. Then the Church of Rome is to be praised, in that
she has determined of so many indifferents: then Paul with the other Apostles
might have spared a great deal of labor in admonishing the Churches how they
should (...) offenses about some indifferent things: A far shorter way had
been either to determine the matter fully: or else to have given order, that
the Churches should among themselves determine it at home.

But say that (...) Archbishop of Corinth (for now I suppose such a one) had
called his convocation, and with consent of his Clergy had (...), that men
might, and for (...) of liberty should, at a certain time eat of such and such
meats, which men formerly doubted of: would not yet the Apostle have given the
same (...) he did? Would not good Christians still have had care of their
brothers consciences? Can the determination of a superior be a sufficient plea
at the bar of Gods judgment seat, for a man that by virtue or (...) thereof
alone, has done any (...), that his (...) tells him, will scandalize his
brother.

Lastly, I would (...) know whether those superiors do not give a great
scandal, which take upon them determinately to impose unnecessary rites, which
they know many good men will be scandalized by? Thus far Ames. But this
opinion of Ames, is I confess to be understood cum gravo salis, with many
limitations, which I shall lay down fully in the Tractate that next follows.

If the Prelates would have seriously laid to heart that golden saying of Paul
(1 Cor. 8. 13. If meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh, while
the world (...), lest I make my brother to offend) This would supersede all
further dispute of this argument: for thence it is easy to evict, that it is
unlawful for Church governors to command the observation of things
indifferent, when in all probability they will scandalize: how dare they make
that the matter of a Church Canon, which Paul durst not adventure upon in his
own personal practice? He thought it unlawful to do a thing otherwise
indifferent, to eat flesh in the care (...) scandal; and therefore doubtless
he judged it unlawful in such a case to impose any such matter upon others:
Greater was the importance of the flesh for borne by Paul unto his health, and
the comfort of his life; then the profit of the controverted ceremonies can be
unto the worship and service of God: And besides, the indifferency of eating
flesh was a thing clear, and evident unto all, that were well instructed in
the Doctrine of Christian liberty; whereas the indifferency of our ceremonies
will at least be judged a very doubtful matter, and that by very indifferent
men, who shall thoroughly ponder the Arguments of Didoclave, Parker, Ames and
others against them, which to this day remain unanswered. The Prelates will
not pretend unto such an ample authority in the Church of God, as Paul had: But
though they be far inferior unto him in point of Authority, they are not yet
so humble, as to imitate him in the condescension of his charity. Paul's
peremptory resolve was to forbear a thing indifferent, when it scandalized.
If (...) makae my brother to offend, I will (says he) eat no flesh, while the
world stands, least I make my brother to offend, 1 Cor. 8. 13.

But what a wide difference, nay contrariety was there betwixt this charitable
resolution of Paul, and the rigid practice of the Prelates. For they were
obstinately bent to press the Ceremonies, with all severity, without any care,
or Conscience of the scandals ensuing: nay their endeavor was daily to add
unto the heap of former ceremonies, though they knew that thereby the scandals
would be increased: They spoke a language quite contrary to that of Paul: we
will enjoyne (say they) the surplice, cross, kneeling in the sacrament of the
Lords supper, while the world stands, as long as we have any power, and
authority in the Church of God, Let who will be offended: This their rigor
brings unto my mind a cruel command of Cum Augustus coenaret apud Vedium
Pollionem. Fregerat unus ex servis ejus crystallinum: rapi eum Vedius jussit,
nec vulgari quidem periturum (...) muraenis objici jubebatur, quas ingens
piscina continebat. (...) non (...) illum putaret luxuriae causa facere?
saevitia erat: evasit e manibus puer, and confugit ad Caesaris pedes: nihil
aliud petiturus, quam ut aliter (...), nec esca fieret. Motus est novitate
crudelitatis Caesar, and illum quidem mitti, crystallina autem omnia coram se
frangi jussit, complerique (...). Fuit Caesari sic castigandus amicus: been
usus est viribus suis. E convivio rapi homines imperas, and novi generis paenis
lancinari? si calix tuus fractus est, viscera hominis distrahentur? tantum tibi
placebis etc. Seneca de ira. Lib. 3.
Vedius Pollio, that was countermanded by Augustus Caesar supping with him: A
poor boy his slave had casually broken a Crystal glass, and for this Pollio
most inhumanely condemned him to be thrown into a great pond of Lampreys,
there to be devoured. The boy escaping from those appointed for his execution,
prostrated himself at the feet of Caesar, who then sup't with his master, and
desired not pardon, but only commutation of so horrid and unnatural a death:
Augustus was extremely transported with the strangeness and novelty of so
inhumane a cruelty, and hereupon to prevent the like for the future he
forthwith commanded all the Crystal glasses of Pollio, though his friend, to
be broken, and the fishpond to be filled up: for the breaking of a sorry glass
he thought it a disproportioned and too severe a punishment, to have a man's
bowels plucked in pieces, and torn asunder. This spirit of Vedius Pollio
breathed in many of our late Prelates; The Ceremonies in comparison of men's
souls were but as paltry trifles, as glasses, and feathers: and yet, by the
maintenance of them, they hazarded the souls of thousands (In as much as in
them lay) they destroyed the work of God, they destroyed those for whom Christ
died; they scandalize Papists, and separatists: people and Pastors:
conformists, and non-conformists, as Mr Parker at large demonstrates: Dr John
Burgess (as I have often heard) urged this story in a Sermon before King James
to persuade him unto the abolition of the Ceremonies: And King James had
doubtless expressed a Christian, and royal care of his people, if he had
broken these glasses in pieces: if he had cashered these toys out of the
Church, which had broken so many in their estates, wounded so many in their
consciences, and endangered the salvation of so many souls: and hereby have
prevented those unspeakable griefs, fears, and scandalls, which they formerly
occasioned.

I proceed unto the third and last conclusion, which is, that (...) actions of
men, which proceeds from deliberate reason, if they be considered in actu
exercito, in the singular or particular, as clothed with circumstances, are
indifferent, but all of them are morally either good, or evil.

For the better understanding of this Conclusion, I shall out of Circumstantia
una aut altera actionis alicujus humanae potest esse indifferens, ut si
studiosus unus cum aliosermonem conferat, indifferens est, saepenumero, utrum
vernaculo utatursermone, an Latino: sed sermo ipse, cum omnibus suis
circumstantiis, vel bonus est, vel malus. Ratio eft, quia determinatio
actionisnon pendet ab una circumstantia seorsim, sed ab omnibus conjunctim.

Datur actio aliqua singularis, in qua nulla bonitatis ratio reperitur, quae
inalia non possit (...) atque adeo quod hoc tempore, hoc vel illud potius
agimus quam aliud, in eo saepe nihil boni aut mali occurrit. Opportunitas, aut
animi suggestio, sine ullo respectu bonitatis moralis, satis habet ponderis ad
singularem istam determinationem.

Quamvis igitur nulla singularis actio humana sit, quae neque est bona neque
mala, fiunt tamen variae, quae singulariter and in comparatione ad alias, neque
sunt necessariae, neque illicitae. Sicut enim statuarius certam rationem saepe
non (...), cur istam potius quam aliam statuam facit, si ta men aliquam faciat,
necesse est, ut vel regulas artis sequendo bonam saciat, aut aberrando malam,
sic est in multis action ibus hominum singularibus, quae quoad exercitium
nullam habent rationem propriam, praeter inclinationem animi, sed cum
exercentur vel bonae sunt, vel malae. De cas. cons. Lib. 3. cap. 18.


Ames add two limitations of it.

1. Then; this conclusion is to be understood only of an adequate consideration
of the circumstances of singular actions, for not only one, but more
circumstances of a humane action in the individual may be indifferent: In a
conference of scholars it is many times indifferent, whether they discourse in
latin, or English, whether in the morning, or afternoon: But yet their whole
conference considered adequately with all circumstances is either good, or
evil; And the reason is because the determination of an action does not depend
upon one circumstance apart, but upon all jointly.

A second limitation of the conclusion is that it is not to be extended unto
every comparative consideration of humane actions and their circumstances: I
know, that not only actions indifferent, but also those that are commanded
become sometime to be sinful by comparison; when they are preferred to better
actions. God dislikes those recreations, that otherwise he allows, when they
justle out duties: nay he abhors sacrifice, when it is inconsistent with
mercy: but notwithstanding this, when there is an equality, if not of actions
themselves, yet of their moral motives as to hic, and nunc this present time
and place, Then curiously to compare and balance such actions, were needless:
for in such a case, the prelation of one before the other, would be a thing
merely arbitrary; neither good nor bad: Reading, prayer, meditation are things
commanded: but many times that I set apart such an hour for reading
principally may be a thing indifferent: that I make choice of one Recreation
before another, of bowling before Chesse, draughts, etc. that I choose to walk
in the forenoon, rather then in the afternoon, may be of no moral
consideration, and so neither good, nor evil, but a matter of indifferency.
Look as an Image carver may have no peculiar reason to make this Image, rather
then that; yet if he make any Image at all; either he follows the rules of
his art, and then he makes a good Image; or he swarves from those rules, and
then he makes a bad image, and does not work like an Artist: So many times it
may be to a Christian, a matter merely indifferent to perform this or that
action, he may have no obligation to do either, or at least to do one rather
then the other, but may be left unto his own mind, and pleasure: but yet he is
as a Christian obliged to regard such circumstances in all his actions, and
therefore whatsoever he does, he does it either well, or ill; for either he
observes these circumstances, and then his action is good, or he neglects
them, and then it is bad.

The conclusion being thus explained may be made apparent from the end, and
rule of deliberate actions.

1. From their end, and what ought to be the end of all deliberate actions of
man may be evidenced from their relation unto their Original, from a
consideration of them absolutely as they are in themselves.

1. From their relation unto their Original, the rational soul, or the
soul, as rational, they flow from man, as man, they proceed from his
deliberate reason, and therefore, should have the same end, which man as
rational should propound, the glorisying of his maker; If they have not this
end, they are evil: and if they have this end, why then (if there be no
failing otherwise) they are good. This argument is by Quaerenda (...) lunt
firmiora praesidia, lententiae humanos actus indisserentes (...). Unum duco ex
operatione humana prout est germen naturae (...). (...) enim ad suas
operationes habet se veluti arbor ad fructus, ut optime advertit Antonius l. 9

Sic enim videmus, servata proportione, (...) in omnibus aliis naturis. Et ratio

indifferens. Moral. (...) did 4. q. 1. (...). 2. n. 37
Raynaudus thus urged: man is related unto his operations, as a tree unto it is
fruits and branches: and therefore there is the same end of the humane
operations, and the humane nature, and the reason is, because that nature is
the first act, and it is operation the second act which is a tendencie of the
first act toward it is object, and end; and therefore it seems necessary, that
there should be the same uttermost end of the nature, and the operation; Even
as there is the same end of the tree, it is stock, branches, and fruits: But now
the uttermost end of the humane nature is God: and therefore God should be the
uttermost end of every humane action; and consequently no humane action can be
indifferent: for if it have not God for it is end, it is sinful: because it
wants that relation unto the uttermost end of the humane nature, which it ought
to have: and if it have God for it is end, then it is morally good, if it want
not any other essential requisite. 2. From a consideration of them Alterum
sententiae (...) firmamentum profero ex actu humano per seipsum considerato.
Hoc est non quatenus (...) germen naturae, and quatenus (...) cum (...) (...)

bona: vel nullo modo in Deum tendit: and sic eo ipso deflectit (...) eo fine,
(...) mala (...). Nam eo ipso quod non fit ob finem increatum, nec in eum
tendit saltem virtualiter, sicut faciunt omnes boni actus, sistit omnino in
bono creato, est que ejus fruitio. Perversum autem est, frui utendis, ut late
tradit D. Augustinus 1. de Doct. Christ. a cap. 3. etc. 21. and 22. ostendens
omnia bona creata debere tantum cadere sub usum nostrum, sub fruitionem autem
non nisi Deum. Ergo Actus humani carentes bono fine, vel (...), vel extrinseco,
sunt (...) ipso (...), carentque aliquo quod (...) deberent. Est enim in omni
action (...), debitum ut sit fruitio (...): id est, ut ultimo ad Deum (...)
aliquo modo. Nam si non haberet hoc (...) debito, posset esse fruitio
utendorum, nihilque idcirco haberet indebitum. (...) (...) actus humanus, qui
dicitur fore prorsus (...), esset (...) puri boni creati, quod utendum (...)
non fruenduoo; merito convincitur non fuisse indifferens, sed oblitus coeno
turpitudinis (...), ob defectum volitionis ad finem (...). n. 38. loc. praedict.
absolutely as they are in themselves: Every humane rational action is
referred unto some chief end or other, and that must be, either the creature,
or the creator: If it be the creature, then the creature is most sinfully
enjoyed, as man's supreme end, and highest happiness: whereas it should be only
used, as a means: and hereby it is at least virtually, and interpretatively
idolized, deified, and placed in the room of God: If it be the Creator then
the action is good, unless it be in some other regard defective. And so you
see that unto whatsoever end it be referred, either created, or uncreated, it
cannot be indifferent.
For the further enforcement of this reason, I shall allege, and open some
few scriptures.

The first is Matthew. 12. 36. But I say unto you, that (...) idle word that men
shall (...), they shall give account (...) in the day of judgment. Three things
here merit our consideration. 1. What is meant by an idle word. 2. What by
giving account (...): and 3 dly, How this makes against the indifferency of
humane actions, considered in their singulars, and actual existence.

1. What is meant by an idle (...): that which has no obliquity in it but
this, that it wants a good and honest end: That it is unprofitable, and
unfruitful, both unto speaker, and hearer: quod aut utilitate rectitudinis aut
ratione justae necessitatis (...), as (...), Homily. 6. As for those, who
think, that an idle word is extended unto every word, (...) wicked, false,
lying, blasphemous, the very context will disprove them: The occasion of our
Saviors discourse was that blasphemy (...) the Pharisees, verse. 24. But (...)
the Pharisees heard it, they said, this fellow (...) (...) cast out Devils, but
by Beelzebub, the prince of the Devils: Now our Saviors (...) is to discover
the (...); and danger of this blasphemous speech of theirs: And this he does,
as by several arguments, so particularly, in this verse, by arguing a minori
ad majus, from the less to the greater: As if he should have said: If in the
day of judgment ye shall give an account for every idle word, then much more
for such a blasphemous vomit as this of yours, That I cast (...) Devils by the
assistance of (...): That our Saviors Argument here stands thus Maldonate tells
us, all are of that opinion that he ever read. And for this coherence take
these two Reasons.

1. Our Savior proceeds in a way of aggravating the now mentioned Blasphemy:
But if by every idle word you understand every grossly wicked, and blasphemous
word, there will be little aggravation hereof: for to say that every wicked
lying, blasphemous word, that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
in the day of judgment, falls very short of what was spoken already of this
blasphemy verse. 31. 32. That it was a blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and not
to be forgiven, either in this world, or in the world to come. 2. Compare we
these words with those immediately foregoing verse. 35. A good man out of the
good treasure of the heart, brings forth good things: and an evil man out of
the (...) treasure, brings forth evil things: In the latter part of these
words, by evil things are understood such evil words as were notoriously
such, such as even the Pharisees acknowledged to be so; The Idle words then in
verse. 36. are distinguished from them, as may very probably be gathered from
the Antithesis insinuated in the particle [but] But I say unto you every idle
word, that men shall (...), they shall give account thereof in the day of
Judgment: It is apparent, that our Savior spoke of such words, whose
sinfulness seemed strange, and new unto such loose commentators on the Law, as
the Pharisees were: And it is very observable, that he ushereth in this his
commination against every idle word with the very same form of speech, that he
uses ( chapt. 5. verse. 12, 28, 31, 34, 39, 44.) In his correction of their
corrupt glosses upon the law of God. So then our Savior speaks of that, which
sounded as very harsh and rigid doctrine in the ears of the Pharisees: But I
say unto you that every idle word, that men shall speak (...) shall give an
account thereof in the day of Judgment: Notwithstanding your slighting thoughts
of your vain, and unprofitable discourse, I, who am the truth, and know fully
the mind of God, as being always in his bosom, do assure you, that every
idle word, which men shall speak, every word, which is not referred unto a good
end, they shall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment.
2. Enquire we, what it is to give an account of every idle word in the day of
Judgment. The phrase sometimes signifies only trial, and examination, Luke
16. 2. Heb. 13. 17. But that here it imports condemnation, and punishment,
Illa verba dixit ad incutiendum hominibus timorem, and ex aggerandam (...)
divini judicii: ergo sensus illorum verborum est ita (...) reddituros (...)
otiosi verbi, ut si nullam aliam excusationem, vel rationabilem causam (...),
pro illo (...) sunt alioquin verba Christi nullum (...) pondus (...) energiam
haberent, neque aliquem metum inferent, cum tamen illo singulari exemplo
voluerit Christus ostendere, quam sint (...) puniendi homines: pro verbis
pravioribus. De bonitate and malit, humanorum act: disp. 9. Sect. 3.
Suarez proves from the scope of the words which was to terrify the Pharisees
for their blasphemy, and to deter others from the like, by displaying, and
amplifying the severity of Gods judgment against it: And unto this the
threatening of punishment and condemnation for every idle word is more
conducing, then a proposal of a bare trial and examination of every idle
word, which is agreeable unto the best words and works of men: (...) for them
(...) may give an account with joy, Heb. 13. 17. In the words then, there is
plainly a Metalepsis, the Antecedent, to give an account in the day of Judgment
is put for the consequent to be punished in hellfire, Every idle word that men
shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment: that is
they without repentance shall be condemned, and everlastingly punished for it:
And this acception of the phrase we find elsewhere, as 1 Pet. 4. 5.

I pass on unto the third particular how this makes against the indifferency
of humane actions considered in their singular and actual existence: I
answer: because it concludes against the indifferency of any words of men; for
those words, which in the general, and in their own nature are indifferent:
yet as drawn into exercise, and putting on circumstances they are idle, if they
have no goodness adjoined unto them, by reference unto their due, and
requisite ends: And if they be idle they are sinsull, and consequently (...)
indifferent: And what is said of idle words of men is applyable unto the idle
thoughts, and works of men: for the thought of man is a more rational act
then his speech, more an act of reason: And his rational works proceed from
his thoughts, and are of far greater moment and importance then his words:
and so in the upshot we may infer that if men's idle words are not
indifferent, then neither men's idle thoughts, and works: And the justness of
this inference, I shall confirm by two arguments.

1. Idle words are therefore sinful, because (being the birth and product of
reason, and the free will of man) there is not in (...) propounded an end
suitable unto the reasonable nature of man: Now all the vain thoughts, and
idle works of men are the issue of reason, and freedom of will: and therefore,
(because they are not (...) unto such an honest end, as becomes the dignity of
such a rational creature, as man,) they are faulty and vicious. 2. Idle words
are therefore morally evil: because in them, that precious treasure, time, is
wasted, in which a man may be more lavish, then in the most prodigal mispence
of money: But now out time is vainly consumed to no good end, and purpose, in
our idle thoughts, and works: and therefore they are sinful, as well as our
idle words: and consequently not indifferent.
A second place is, 1 Cor. 10. 31. Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all unto the Glory of God: To eat, and to drink
abstractively considered, are indifferent actions, and yet such actions are
here commanded to be referred unto the glory of God: and therefore if they be
not thus referred, they are sinful: And we may say the same of all other
actions, that are in spccie, in their own nature indifferent. Capreolus (lib.
2. did. 40. quaest 1. page 562.) notes, that these words of the Apostle [ Let
all things be done unto the Glory of God] may be understood two manner of ways
negatively or affirmatively.

1. Negatively, and then the sense is, do nothing against (...) glory, nothing
that may dishonor him: Things offered unto idols were in themselves the good
creatures of God, and to eat them an action in it self indifferent, but to
eat them in the Idols Temple was to countenance Idolatry, and so a high
dishonouring of God, To eat them also with the scandal of a weak brother, was
to prejudice, and obstruct the glorifying of Gods name.

2dly, The words may be understood affirmatively, and so there is (as Capreolus
observes) a threefold reference unto the glory of God.

1. Habitual. 2. Actual. 3. Virtuall.
1. An habitual reference there is unto the glory of God, wheresoever there is
the habit, the grace, or virtue of the love of God, the principle of actually
referring all things unto the glory of God. But now this is not sufficient: for
the habit of love may (for a long time) lie idle, and un-active, and be
consistent with very gross sins: as we see in David, Peter, and others.

2. An action is actually referred unto Gods glory, when there is an actual
cogitation of God, and his glory: And this, (though it ought frequently to be
done) is not yet required in every action: well it may be our happiness in the
next life; But it can not be our duty in this; because it would leave no room,
or place for other duties: Thus for an Artist to be always thinking upon the
rules of his Art, would be a disturbance unto his work: for a traveller to
have perpetually in his thoughts, the end of his journey would retard his
progress therein.

In a third place therefore, the reference of all our actions unto Gods glory,
that is here exhorted to, is only virtuall. And that an action may virtually
be referred unto Gods glory three things are required. 1. The above mentioned
habitual reference unto Gods glory must be presupposed, as also. 2dly, A
foregoing actual reference of a man's self, and all that belongs unto him unto
the glory of God, and the more frequent this is, the better, and 3ly, The
Action it self. 1. Must not be reserred unto any end opposite unto Gods glory.
2. It must be reserred unto some end subordinate unto Gods glory, that carries
a tendency unto it, and is naturally referrible thereunto.

Now such an action is said to be virtually referred unto Gods glory, because
it is done in the virtue, and sorce of some preceding actual, and explicit
proposal of Gods glory as a supreme end: for the virtue, and force of the
chief, and utmost end abides in all inferior ends subordinated unto it; so
that he, who propounds unto himself those inferior ends, may be said to
propound implicitly, and mediately Gods glory for his uttermost end. Thus those
godly persons who have first actually made Gods honor and glory, the maine
aim of their desires, endeavors, and undertakings, may be said afterward to
refer even their eating, and drinking, their recreations unto Gods glory
virtually, if they aim at no dishonest end, though their explicit and
immediate intendment be only the refreshment of their bodies, by which they
are the better fitted, and prepared for the glorisying of God in both their
general, and particular callings. Thus every step in a man's journey, (so he
go not out of the way) may be said to be virtually designed unto the end of
his journey, and yet it is neither necessary, nor expedient, that in every step
a man should have actual thoughts of the end of his journey.

Unto this sentence of the Apostle here, Eslius makes Parallel two other places.

The first, Col. 3. 17. Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name
of the Lord Jesus, that is; for his glory and honor, for his names sake.

The second is, 1 Pet. 4. 11. If any man speak, let him speak as the Oracles
of God: If any man minister, let him (...) it as of the ability, which God
gives, that God in all things may be glorisied through Jesus Christ; Not only
in public ordinances, not only in acts of worship, not only in necessary
duties, but even in indifferencies, in all the common actions of this life.

But as for any further exposition of these two places in themselves, or
application unto the matter in hand, I shall refer the reader unto what I but
now spoke on the 1 Cor. 10. 31. which with due change will serve here.

I shall therefore pass on unto a second argument taken from the rule of
humane actions, right reason: Unto this rule all rational actions, proceeding
from deliberate reason, are either agreeable, or disagreeable: If agreeable,
then they are morally good; for right reason is a part of Scripture materially
considered: If disagreeable, then they are vicious and sinful; For the will of
man is bound to look to it is rule, and conform all it is actions thereunto:
and therefore if in any thing it neglect, or thwart it, if it swarve therefrom
in the least particulars, it thereby commits a sin.

Unto these two arguments I shall add a third, drawn from the relation betwixt
(...) goodness and (...): They are privatively opposite; and inter privative
opposita non datur medium in proprio subjecto susceptivo; betwixt things
privatively opposite there is no middle, either of abnegation, or participation
in capable subjects: Thus every sensitive creature either sees, or is blind:
but we cannot say of a stone, that it is blind, although it sees not; because
it is not capable of sight: Now moral goodness and illness are privatively
opposed, (the formality of sin being nothing else, but a privation of that
moral goodness, which is required unto every rational action;) Now every
rational action, Every action, that proceeds from deliberate reason, and
freedom of will, considered in its singulars, and as drawn into exercise is
capable of moral goodness; because it is referrible unto a good end: and
therefore it is either good, or evil, and so not indifferent.

Against this there are diverse objections: unto those of Scotus the reader may
supply himself with answers out of what has been said already: As for the
arguments of Vasquez, there is but Prima ratio est (...) ex eo, quod Doctores
prioris opinionis concedunt, esse nimirum actionem indifferentem ex sua specie,
and objecto, tametsi in individuo nulla (...) indifferens. Ratio vero est
(...). Nulla est natura in specie, quae non habeat aliquod individuum in quo
ratio ejus maneat, and non destruatur per (...): cum igitur sit actio humana
indifferens secundum suam naturam and speciem, (...) debet aliquod individuum,
ac proinde esse (...) aliqua actio individua, and singularis, quae maneat
indifferens. In 12 (...) tom. disp. 52. cap. 4. page 378.
one of them merit's any examination, and yet that has been also answered out
of Durand. (b)

In brief, it run's thus. As no Genus, no general nature can be without one
species, so no species, no special without one singular. No specificall nature
but has at least one individual: and therefore, if there be some humane
actions, that be in their species, in their specificall nature indifferent,
there must needs be an individual of such an action, that must be indifferent:
and consequently all humane actions considered in the individual are not
morally good, or evil.

This has been sufficiently answered already; but now I shall, ex abundanti,
add two things more.

The first is out of Hunc loquendi modum, fateor esse cavillo obnoxium;
impugnaturque ab Argentina in 2. d. 40. qu. unica. art. 2. in 2. particuli:
quia nulla (...) esse species cujus non possit esse aliquid individuum. Ergo si
dantur actus secundum speciem (...), debent quoque dari indisferentes secundum
individuum. Quod argumentum agendo de specie, and individuo in sensu
quotidiano, and vulgari, recte concludit, sed non (...) eos, qui admittunt
actus secundum speciem indifferentes, negant autem dari indifferentes in
individuo. Nam (...) Autores fatentur illos ipsos actus, quos admittunt, esse
secundum speciem indifferentes, habere quc que indifferentiam quoad gradum
illorum specificum restrictum per individuationem. Tantum itaque negant, eos
actus, si spectentur cum omnibus sibi debit is accidentibus, esse moraliter
indisferentes. Et (...) appellant, actus non esse indifferentes secundum
individuum: nempe quia individuum, secluso rigore illo Metaphysico, in quo
tantum importat restrictionem gradus specifiei, (...) congeriem omnium horum
accidentium, aut ut passim loquimur, conditionum individuantium, secundum quam
congeriem actus humanus non est indifferens, quatenus vel inter illa (...) est
debitus finis extrinsecus, and sic actus est bonus, vel non est debitus finis,
and sic est malus, Mor. disc. distin. 4. qu. 1. art. 2. Number. 31.
Raynaudus: An humane action that considered specifically is indifferent, in
regard of object or (...) may in it is individuals and singulars be looked upon
two manner of ways. 1. Inadequately only as touching matter, or object. 2.
Adequately in regard of all circumstances.

1. If an humane action be considered specifically indifferent as touching
matter or object, then all the individuals or singulars of that action are
indifferent too, not simply and absolutely, but secundum quid; that is only as
touching their object, and matter: But notwithstanding this, if we consider
them adequately in respect of all circumstances, they are either good, or
evil: for either they are clothed with all circumstances required in a
rational action, and then they are good: or else they want some, or one of
these circumstances, and then they are evil and sinful, for malum fit ex
(...) defectu.

The second is out of a modern Thomist; (...), (...) aliquid esse indifferens
dupliciter. 1. Quod indifferentia sit de ejus (...), 2. Quod ipsi (...) (...)
accidens, and ab (...). Si sit indifferens priori modo, necesse in inferioribus
salvari istam indifferentiam, quia tota essentia superioris (...) in (...),
siquidem essentia consist it in indivisibili: si sit indifferens posterio i
modo, non est necesse salvari indifferentiam in inferiori: nam quae per
accidens superiori convenient, sunt ab ipso separabilia: ergo sine illis potest
(...) inferiori. Si (...) accidentia (...) inferiori. V, C. posse praedicari de
multis numerd differentibus, convenit naturae humanae secundum speciem
consideratae, sed per accidens, and ab (...), scilicet per operationem mentis
(...) (...) a singularibus, and cum illis ipsam conferentis; talis autem
operatio est mere contingens tall naturae. Ex opposito, esse animal rationale
convenit eidem humanae naturae tanquam illius essentia. Ex quo fit, (...)
humana natura nequeat communicari inferioribus, quin ipsis (...) (...)
rationale, sed non ipsis communicate posse de multis numero praedicari, alioqui
quodlibet individuum esset species. Jam ut ad propositum veniam, Indifferentia
actui secundum speciem concessa non est ipsi essentialis, sed accidentalis per
abstractionem ab individuis: imo non est indifferentia moralis positiva: quasi
actus ille sit moralis, and indifferens: sed est moralis negativa, quatenus
actus ille non est moralis, sed caret ordine ad rationem morum regulam, ideoque
(...) bonus est, nec malus moraliter. Unde patet non debere in ullo individuo
(...) (...) indifferentiam, nisi (...) in actibus indeliberatis, qui similiter
non sint moraless sed ipsi absunt a nostra quaestione. Ethic. cap. 3. Sect. 2.
Irenaeus. A thing may be said to be indifferent two manner of (...). 1. When
indifferency is essential unto it. 2. When indifferency agrees unto it only
by accident, and extrinsecally, from something that is extraessentiall unto it:
If indifferency were essential unto an humane action, considered specifically,
then every singular, or individual thereof must be indifferent too; because
the essentials of every thing superior in point of predication are imparted,
and attributed unto every thing, that is under them in point of predication; as
every individual of the humane nature is a sensitive creature, a living body,
etc. But now indifferency is ascribed unto some humane actions (considered
specifically) only by accident, and extrinsecally, from the operation of our
understandings, abstracting, and devesting them from those circumstances good,
or bad, wherewith in their individualls they are apparel'd: and therefore
agrees not unto their individuals looked upon without such an abstraction.

By what has been said, you see that our most indifferent actions Application.
are liable unto sin; and therefore afford matter of humiliation for the time
past, matter of Caution for the future.

1. Matter of humiliation for the time past: In their singular, and actual
existence they were morally either good or evil, sanctified or sinful; and
good they could not be, unless there did concur all requisites: And (alas,)
how seldom has there occurred in them such a concurrence? sometimes they have
risen from a wrong principle; other times they have been directed unto bad
ends; most times they have been faulty in regard of either measure, or manner:
It is very seldom, but there has been wanting in them some circumstance, or
other, that the word of God, or law of nature requires: And the total want of
one of the least of such circumstances will so vitiate indifferent actions, as
that it will not only render them sinful, but make them sins, meritorious
of all the flames, and torments in hell: and that which deserves so severe a
punishment, calls for a very eminent sorrow and contrition: God has set bounds
unto the use of our liberty in things indifferent, (as unto the waves of the
sea,) saying, thus sarre shall ye go, and no farther: He has commanded, that
it should be restrained by prudence, (...), conscience, Religion, Authority,
and charity, But we have transgressed these limits, and have exceeded all
bounds of moderation: We have used this part of our Christian liberty very
imprudently, and intemperately in regard of our selves; irreligiously, and
profanely in respect of God: against the dictates of our conscience, a deputy
under him; against the obligations of our oaths, and vows unto him:
disobediently against the lawful commands of our superiors: uncharitably with
the scandal of many poor brethren. And thus have we most shamefully, and
unthankfully abused this great privilege of Christianity, by using it as an
occasion unto the (...), as a (...) of maliciousness; and so have prostituted
it unto the very service of Satan (...): (...) Job's Sons and Daughters had
feasted together, Job offered burnt offerings according unto the number of them
all: for he said, it may be that my sons have sinned, Job. 14. 5. Their
feasting was a thing indifferent, and very lawful in it self: but, because it
was obnoxious unto sin, therefore Jobe sacrificed in the behalf of them all:
It may be (says he) that my sons have sinned: The possibility of sin in
the indifferent things of others (especially such as are nearly related:)
stirs up in the godly a fear, and a holy jealousy of them, and rowseth unto
prayers for them: and therefore much more should the (...), and (...) assurance
of the adhesion of sin unto our own indifferent actions provoke us, with
contrite hearts to deprecate the wrath of God against us: All the
indifferencies of unregenerate men are sins: Unto them that are defiled and
(...) nothing is pure, Tit. 1. 15. the plowing of the wicked is sin, Prove.
21. 4. And however unto the pure all things are pure. Tit. 1. 15. that is, all
indifferent things in themselves are lawful, yet they may and do accidentally
become sin, when they are not in all particulars rightly circumstanced: And
then they present us with fresh occasion for the renewall of our repentance and
faith in Christ Jesus: And how often this happens, is a matter, that the most
wakefull and quicksighted conscience can hardly discern: so that the best of
us may apply unto our indifferencies that of David, Psalm. 19. 12. Who can
understand his errors: cleanse thou me from secret faults.

Secondly, The liablenesse of our indifferent actions unto sin should be a
motive unto all possible caution and wariness for the future in them: There is
no humane action so indifferent, but it is capable of sin, nay (if it be not
in all particulars rightly circumstantiated,) it becomes actually (...); and
therefore our hearts should be very watchful against sin in the use of all
indifferencies, in our meals, in our feastings, and merry meetings, in our
journey's, in our ordinary talk, and discourse, in our walks, in the actions
of our ordinary vocations: Indeed the rule of Gods word does not at all either
command, or forbid the matter of such actions: but the manner of performing
them comes under the rule: They are all to be done to the glory of God, in
the name of Christ: every good creature is to be sanctified by the word, and
prayer: That Command, which God gave Abraham ( to walk before him) is not to be
straightened unto the ordinances of God, but to be extended unto all deliberate
acts of a man's life, and conversation, Genesis 17. 1. Zechariah (in his prophecy
of the general call or conversion of Jews, and Gentiles) gives this for one
character of such, as shall be converted, that they shall have a sacred and
sanctified use of things common and indifferent: In that day shall there be
upon the bells of their horses, holiness unto the Lord, yea, every pot in
Jerusalem and Judah shall be (...) unto the Lord of Hosts, Zech. 14. 20, 21.
Not only acts of immediate worship, but all rational actions, whatsoever,
should be offered up as spiritual sacrifices acceptable unto God by Jesus
Christ, 1 Pet. 2. 5. The Apostle exhorts the Romans to salute one another with
an holy kiss, Romans 16. 16. this kiss was no religious rite in Gods worship,
but a ceremony of civility; and therefore in it self a thing indifferent: And
yet the Apostle requires holiness for the qualification of it: All our civil
actions ought to be such, as becomes saints; that is, so far forth holy for
manner, that they be free from sin, and unto the glory of God: Indeed this is
a strictness impossible unto lapsed man: But though we cannot exactly and
perfectly observe it, yet we may sincerely and cordially endeavor it: And this
sincere and hearty endeavor is that, which God, for Christ's sake, will
accept, reward, and crown; and therefore it concerns us very much to use our
utmost diligence herein: and the rather, because we are (by far) more prone
and ready to slide-into sin in things indifferent ere we are aware, then in
such things, as are for their nature, and matter sinful; for in such things
the danger is more apparent, and therefore the more feared, and watched against;
Whereas, if once we know, and are persuaded, that actions are indifferent, and
lawful, then we are apt to think that all is safe, and that we need not
trouble our selves with any farther considerations touching their expediency,
and edification; and that there is no reason to perplex our hearts and
consciences with an anxious care of referring them to Gods glory, of walking
before God in them, and of putting holiness unto the Lord upon them. Now when
once such thoughts as these creep into men's heads, it cannot be imagined, unto
what excesses, and failings it exposes them: Add unto this: that look as the
consideration of the lawfulness, and indifferency of actions occasioneth a
surprizall many times with heinous sins: so also it proves ( by accident) an
obstacle unto repentance for such sins: When the Godly fall into gross, and
acknowledged sins, either of omission, or commission; why, the checks of
their own consciences, the public ministry, the reproaches of enemies, and
the admonition of Christian friends will soon awaken them, and inform them of
their guilt: But as for the sins, that adhere unto their indifferencies, how
quickly are they hardened in them? For it is very seldom, that, either their
consciences, or their ministers, or their Brethren take notice of them; or if
they do, they are apt presently to hold forth the indifferency, and
lawfulness of such actions in themselves, as a buckler to ward off all
accusations of Conscience, all upbraidings of enemies, all reprehensions, of
either ministers, or private friends: Those, that are most lavish of their
time, and purses, in gaming, will plead; that they follow none, but lawful
sports: A Gentleman, that murders the greatest part of his time in hunting,
hawking, and the like exercises, and redeems but an inconsiderable portion of
it to do God, and his Country service, thinks, that he has enough to stopp
the mouth of all reproof, to say, that the recreations, which he pursues are
things indifferent: such riotous persons, as wast their precious hours in
joviallity, and goodfellowship, usually make this Apology for themselves: that
it is not unlawful to drink with a friend in a Tavern or alehouse. To awaken
from this licentiousness, and to quicken in us a careful watchfulness over
our hearts in the use of things indifferent, I shall, for conclusion of this
discourse, propound some examples of the severity of Gods judgments against the
sins of men's indifferencies: David's numbering of the people was a thing not
evil in it self; but his curiosity, pride, and carnal confidence in an arm
of flesh made it so; And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote
Israel, 1 Chronicles. 21. 7. with a pestilence, that devoured 70000. Doubtless most
of those feminine ornaments (mentioned, Esaias 3.) were in themselves lawful;
but the haughtiness, and wantonness of the daughters of Zion abused them unto
sin; And how severely this sinful abuse of them was threatened, you may read
at large from verse the 16 usque ad 25: for Hezekiah to show unto the
Babylonian Ambassadors the house of his precious things, the silver, and the
gold and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his
armor, and all that was found in his treasures, all that was remarkable in his
house, and dominion was in it self, but a civil entertainment, and not
unlawful: but because he did it out of vain ostentation, this turned it into
sin, and this was one of the sins, which God chastised with the captivity of
the whole nation, Esaias 39 2 Chronicles. 32. 2 Kings 30. To be (...) in Purple, and
fine linen, and to fare sumptuously were things in themselves indifferent; but
the excess of the rich glutton made it sinful unto him: and this sin, not
being repented of, was unto him a forerunner of hell torments, Luke 16. 19, 23.
They were the sins of things indifferent that had a great hand in, and
influence upon the drowning of the old world, and the burning of Sodom, Luke
17. verse. 27, 28, 29. In the days of Noah, they did eat, they drank, they
married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered
into the arc; and the slood came and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it
was in the days of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold,
they planted, they builded: But the same day that Lot went out of (...), it
rained fire and brimstone from Heaven, and destroyed them all.

1 These: 5. 22. Abstain from all appearance of evil.
Our Apostle directs us, in the verse immediately preceding this Text,
concerning Good; in this Text concerning Evil. Toward Good he exacts a
prudent wariness; toward Evil a scrupulous fearfulness. Toward good, a
prudent wariness, Prove all things, and then, hold fast that which is good.
Nothing, how colorable soever, is to be received hand over head, before trial
and examination by the balance of the Sanctuary: for, Vitia virtutes
mentiuntur (says Gregory) vice is maskt under the skin of virtue; falsehood,
disguised under the face of truth: so that one is often mistaken for the other.
The grossest enormities have been glast and colored over with the name, and
face of virtues: the most poisonous heresies have often gained the esteem and
applause of Orthodox Tenants, and therefore as we must steadfastly retain that
which is truly true and good; so must we prudently discern, and carefully
distinguish between that which is so indeed, and in truth and that which is so
only in show, and color; this we must reject, that keep, and hold fast: Prove
all things, hold fast that which is good. But he requires now toward evil a
far different carriage: there he looks for a scrupulous fearfulness. Though
we must not hold fast any thing that has but the appearance of good, yet we
must abstain from but the appearance of evil.

Abstain from all appearance of evil: or from every evil appearance the
Words may be rendered indifferently, either way, both rendering being equally
consonant to the truth, and Original.

In the words our Apostle meets with a cavil, rise among the Libertines of
our, and former times, who when their scandalous courses are charged upon the^,
baffle of all with this plea: that they are not intrinsecally sinful. Could I
(will the prosanest Libertine say) once see such and such things proved to be
unlawful: why I would make no more words of the matter, but soon forbear
them. I, but have they the blush, the appearance of evil? that should be
motive enough to shun them.

Abstain from all etc.
But are we sure this is the Apostles meaning? are not the words capable of
another interpretation? First, some mislike our translation of (...), species,
by appearance, and rather think it should be meant logically, for sort, or
kind. That it may be so, Mat. Flac. Illyricus and Beza determine, That it is so
the Syriack Interpreter, and after him Faber, and after them our own great and
learned See his Annotations.
Doctor Hammond resolve. But I would feign know upon what ground they are thus
singular against the Current both of Ancient and Modern Expositors. Setting
aside this place the word occurres (as I think) in the whole new Testament but
four times, In Luke 3. 22. and 9. 29. John 5. 37. 2 Cor. 5. 7. And in none of
these places is it, can it be taken in a Logical notion. If not elsewhere, why
here? especially seeing such an acception is not enforced by the scope,
coherence, any other circumstance of the Text, or any absurdity otherwise
unavoidable.

But some dream of a soul absurdity, that would ensue upon translating (...)
species, appearance. If every appearance of evil should be abstained from,
then should good things, the best things be eschewed, for they commonly appear
to be evil unto sense, and carnal reason, that discern not the things of the
spirit of God. How easily may an acute wit set false faces upon them and work
a bad conceit of them into either weak or ill apprehensions.

Unto this we may add that of Dr Hammond in his treatise of (...). page 9. 10.
Appearance of evil (says he) is so uncertain and unconstant a thing, that to
abstain from it, universim, cannot be the matter of any (...) Command. This
fear will quickly vanish and be discovered to be idle, and vain, when anon we
shall explain that distinction of appearance of evil, into (...), and
imaginary: for the present therefore, leaving these men, proceed we, secondly,
to others, who agree with us in interpreting (...), in a vulgar, familiar, and
common sense, for appearance: but then their exposition is not so general, as
ours: for they restrain the place to matters of Doctrine, and will not allow
it to be extended to matters of practice: and countenance, they think, the
context gives their gloss: for the Apostle having at the 19 (...) exhorted not
to quench the spirit, in verse 20. prescribes a means for cherishing the
spirit, viz: a reverent demean our toward the word of God. If ye will not
quench the spirit, despise not prophesying. And next, lest that some should
except: are we thus reverently to receive promiscuously all prophesyings, and
doctrines preached unto us, and not to beware of some, of false prophesyings
and doctrines? the Apostle, (say they) more distinctly directs, how we should
demean our selves. First, toward all prophesyings in general: how, secondly,
toward true: how, 3 dly, toward false. First, all prophesyings, and doctrines
whatsoever must be (...) examined, Prove all things. Secondly, all true
prophesyings, sound, and orthodox doctrines are to be embraced, with a firm,
and unremoveable assent, Hold fast that which is good. Lastly, as for false
prophesyings and doctrines even their very appearance is to be shunned. Thus
they etc.

But first, I propose unto the consideration of the learned, whether or no an
exact and acurate coherence be to be looked for in most of those precepts,
delivered by the Apostle, from verse. 13: (...) ad verse. 23. The loose and
abrupt manner of heaping them together persuade (me thinks) that there is as
little dependence of many of them upon either the foregoing, or sollowing
precepts, as is to be expected between Solomon's Proverbs, or Bede's Axioms.
Hence is it that Neque necesse est hanc partem (...) (ut quidam faciunt) ut
connexionem (...) cum iis, quae proxime praecedunt: nam potius videtur
Apostolus refricare memoriam (...), quod praecipit (...) superiori: ut honesti
ambulent, ad (...), qui (...) sunt, etc. Estius.
Estius holds it not necessary to interpret the place so, as that it should
have connection with those duties that immediately precede: rather (thinks he)
the Apostle (...) to rub up the memory of what he commanded in the former
chapter, at verse the 12. That ye may walk honestly toward them that are
without.

Secondly, Suppose a coherence of the words with the former, must it needs be
that which they obtrude? The words may sit under our interpretation, and yet
the Analysis of the Context run smoothly, as thus:

The Apostle having at verse 19. dehorted from quenching the spirit, next
advises use of means tending to the preservation of its gracious and glorious
residence in the soul: which means are either negative or positive: he
assigns but one negative means, viz: a removal of a maine bar and powerful
obstacle unto the presence of the spirit, contempt of preaching, Despise not
prophesying, verse. 20. of the positive means, two concern good, one evil: the
two concerning good, are boni diligens examinatio, constans electio: Prove all
things, hold fast that which is good. This respecting evil, est
universalissima ejus rejectio, an abstinence not only from all kinds, but even
from all appearance of evil.

Lastly, suppose the primary scope and intention of the Apostle be limited unto
matters of doctrine: yet because the maine reason, for which they themselves
conceive appearances of evil, even in matters of doctrine to be interdicted,
is avoidance of scandal, the precept of which is juris naturalis, and not only
doctrines but also actions are scandalous: justly therefore unto these, as well
as those, (...) the text appliable, and applied too, by all Schoolmen, or
others that ever I met with purposely treating on the point of scandal. Should
we then against the more generally received opinion of either former or later
times, admit of their narrow and (...) interpretation for the clear, and
indubitate sense of the Apostle? Yet to make the words more instructive, their
use more general, we might warrantably put an enlargment upon them, and extend
them ad mores, (...) well as ad dogmata: ad agenda, as well as ad credenda: to
the decalogue, as well as creed; not only to doctrinall truths, but moral
duties also.

Use of a division here is none, but to bewray Logic: and therefore without
more ado we will (...) betake our selves to Limitation, Consirmation, and
Application of the plain point (...) commended to us: we are to abstain not
only from things intrinsecally (...), but from all shows and appearances of
sin.

For Limitation, appearance of evil is either in (...) or actions.

First then? it is questioned whether or no we are to abstain from all
positions, which have an appearance of evil: of falsehood.

For resolution we must distinguish,

1. Concerning appearance of evil in positions. 2. Concerning abstinence from
such an appearance.
Appearance of evil in Positions is twofold:

1. Either in regard of their (...) and substance. 2. Or else in the terms,
and expressions used in their proposal.
That (...) is in regard of their matter and substance, is, either to our
selves or others.

Secondly, to distinguish concerning abstinence from the appearance (...)
evil, or falsehood in Positions: we may be said to abstain from doctrines
false in appearance, two manner of ways: either

1. When we abstain from assenting to them. 2. Or when we abstain from
publishing of them.
We abstain from assenting to them either positively, or negatively.

Positively, when by a positive, or real act of the understanding we dissent
from, we reject them. Now dissent from them is twofold,

1 Either absolute and peremptory, 2. Or else but conditional, and cautionary.
Negatively, when we do not dissent from them, but only not assent unto them:
when we suspend our assent.

To apply these distinctions.

Note first, that though the substance or matter of Doctrines appear to be
false unto our selves, our own judgments, yet are we not bound to abstain
positively from assenting to them. to dissent from them, to reject them; for
this appearance may not be true and real, grounded upon the doctrines
themselves, which perhaps may not send forth the least color or shadow for
suspicion, but only put and fastened upon them by means of the error,
ignorance, and darkness of our understandings, that perhaps not with due care
and circumspection, but rather with much precipitancy have given their censure
of them: and therefore however at first blush they seem false, yet when once
the light of our reason is cleared from mists, and clouds, they may upon due
examination prove true: and to dissent from, and reject a truth would be a
soul error of, and blemish to our understanding. Obliged we are then, to
abstain, not positively but negatively from assenting to them: that is, not to
(...) from them, but only not to assent unto them, to stay our assent, to
demurre a while, before we give in our judgment, lest we receive any thing with
a doubtful, entangled, and perplexed Conscience.

Of this Calvin gives us an hint in his exposition on this place, Speciem mali

when as the falsehood of a doctrine is not yet so thoroughly detected, that it
may be deservedly rejected, but yet there sticks some bad suspicion of it, and
it is feared, lest poison lurk under it: therefore he commands us to abstain
from that kind of doctrine, which though it be not evil, yet appears so: not
as though it ought altogether to be rejected, but because it ought not to be
received, to be believed. For why does he before command us to hold fast only
that which is good, and here he wills us to abstain not barely from evil, but
from its (...)? Because when after a thorough sifting a truth is cleared, `tis
fitting it should forthwith be believed: but when as the falsehood of it is
feared, or the mind with doubting is entangled, we must for a while withdraw
our assent, lest we (...) any thing with a doubting, and (...) conscience.

But suppose I for mine own part am firmly persuaded of the truth of such, or
such a Tenet, or at least unconvinced, unperswaded of it is falsehood, and yet it
appear generally unto others to be false unto the judgments of the godly
learned, of most of the ancient (...), unto either general or provincial
Councils: in such a case, what course must I take, because it has appearance
of falsehood unto others understandings, must I therefore dissent from it, or
stop mine assent unto it?

For answer, take these four following rules.

First, we owe so reverend and humble an esteem of, and submission unto the
Spirits of the Prophets, to the judgment of learned, sober, and pious Divines,
unto the writings of the ancient godly Fathers, unto the Canons, and decrees of
Oecumenicall, and Provincial Councils, as that whatsoever Tenants the whole
Church representative, to wit, a general Council, or the greatest and
chiefest part of the Church most of the Fathers and Divines too, of later and
present times, have rejected and condemned for false, and erroneous, we should
abstain negatively from assenting to, that is, though not change, yet suspend
our belief of them, and not fully pass over our full and absolute assent unto
them, until by diligent inquisition, (...) prayer, imploring the guidance of
Gods holy spirit, and use of all other good means, either their consonancy
with, or dissonancy from the truth, be clearly discerned, fully confirmed, and
manifested unto our Consciences.

But Christian modesty stays not here, but goes one step further, and in a
second exacts of us a conditional, probable, and Dr Jackson.
cautionary dissent from all doctrines thus generally suspected, and censured:
for upon general dislike of a doctrine, as upon a (...) motive, we may ground
a strong presumption, an high and probable conjecture of the falsehood of it: so
that hereupon we may reject it, though not in an absolute and irrevocable way,
yet with this limitation and caution: so the apparent verity therein of it
self do not force us to embrace it. So sottish I am not, as to measure truth
by multitude of voices: for errors I know that have grated upon the
foundation, nay heresies, that have raised the foundation, have had their cloud
of witnesses: yet I should so far honor a public testimony, as to suspect
mine own, and others private bare opinions, not backed by plain scripture, with
evident sense, or a (...) demonstrative argument, rather than a general
suffrage: for, nemo omnes, neminem omnes, (...), Pliny.
improbable as for one to deceive all, so for all to deceive one, Rivet (...)

Scrip: Sac. (...). 19. Page: 272.
makes no doubt, but caeteris paribus, that is, if parts, prayer, diligence of
study after the truth, be equal, that then a greater and fuller measure of the
gist of expounding the Scripture, and deciding controversies thereabouts, is
comn unicated. to the public ministers of the Church, (whether they execute
their function severally, and apart in some one particular Church, or else
jointly confer and discourse among themselves concerning the true and genuine
sense of the Scriptures in some assemblies called lawfully, and in the name of
Christ) than unto several private men, who are neither endowed with so many
gifts, nor see with so many eyes, nor by their private and single meditation
can equal the united consultations and enquiries after truth of many. And thus
you see how far Christian modesty requires us to abstain from assenting to
doctrines upon the appearance of evil, or falsehood, which they carry unto
those, who in interpeting scripture, and deciding controversies, have committed
to them the public office of direction and instruction of others: but yet it
takes not (...) us the judgment of private discretion; for Christian liberty
allows us such a freedom of dissenting from, or assenting unto, what the
Church, and her ministers say, as is to be specified in the next two following
rules.

In a third place therefore, although the Church, or the greatest and chiefest
part of her, charge error and falsehood upon such a doctrine; yet this bare and
single testimony, not seconded by any scripture or reason, is not to gain so
far upon our belief, as that thereupon we should presently reject, and
dissent from the doctrine thus generally censured with an absolute and
peremptory dissent. This were to give unto the Churches decisions as high and
overruling a suffrage in our hearts, as is only due to divine revelations to
receive them, not as they are indeed the word of men, but as if they were the
word of God: to yield unto them an absolute divine faith, and credence. This
were a mere Vassallage of our souls, understandings, faiths, unto the
authority of an humane testimony: a thing utterly unworthy the generosity and
freedom of Christian Spirits. If God has indulged to any the exercise of such
dominion over men's faiths, and consciences: alas! then to what purpose has he
placed that glorious lamp of reason in our bosoms? of what use are our
intellectualls? What place is there left for St Paul's proving of all things? St
John's trial of the Spirits? but the truth is, that God 1 John 4. 1.
is so far from enslaving our understandings, or captivating our belief unto
the judgment of any mortal, as that he approves not only of a forbearance
from a flat, and absolute (...) from doubtful doctrines thus publicly, and
generally disliked, but also of a full and peremptory assent unto doctrines
manifestly true, though condemned in a general Council, as is apparent from
the fourth and last rule, which is:

If a doctrine be, as true in it self, so also clearly, and evidently by me
(...) to be so, and yet appear generally to be false unto others, of what
degree, order, or condition soever; nevertheless it Commands absolute
subscription, and assent of the mind without contradiction, without hesitancy,
nay without so much as suspense of judgment. If the verity then of a doctrine
be apparent, it must overruled the assent of the understanding against the
testimony of the whole world. For the testimony of men, of the wisest, holiest
men, considered either apart, or assembled in a council, admits, as allwaies
of examination, and trial by the balance of the Sanctuary, and rules of right
reason, so likewise of contradiction and denial, when in it there is an
express, and evident variation from either reason, or divine authority. In
such a cause we may lawfully, and safely dissent from it; allwaies provided,
that it be not in an insolent manner, but with a reverend, child-like, and
respectfull bashfulnesse.

But to go on, if I am not to abstain from assenting to a doctrine manifestly
true, because it appears generally to others to be false, must I not yet
abstain from publishing, from spreading of it, either by writing or preaching?

For answer, thou must consider the general nature and quality of the
doctrine, thus wrongly either (...), or suspected of falsehood, and also of what
use, and importance it is in regard of the present times, and places, wherein
thou live, and if it prove to be a doctrine either fundamental, or at least
of such weight and moment that from the publishing of it, will spring a greater
good, more glory to God, and benefits to the Church then the trouble and
disquiet it brings can be an evil, thou art then at no hand to conceal it, so
should thou be unfaithful both to God and his Church, and become accessory
to the betraying, nay murder of the truth. Si de veritate scandalum sumatur
(says Gregory) melius est ut scandalum oriatur, quam ut veritas relinquatur.
If scandal or offense be taken at a truth which the estate and exigence of
those souls committed to a man's charge requires him to publish, better suffer
the whole world to be scandalized, than such a truth disadvantaged, either by
denial, or but a cowardly smothering, and dissembling, thereof. Quemadmodum
enim (says Calvin) Charitati subjicienda est nostra Call. lib. 3. Just. c. 12.
Sect. 13.
libertas, ita sub fidei puritate subsidere (...) charitas ipsa debet: As our
liberty is to be subjected to charity, (...) also our Charity it self to
faith's purity.

But now if it be a doctrine, either not fundamental, but of a lower rank and
quality, wherein both orthodox writers, and preachers may vary and abound in
their own sense, without prejudice to the foundation: or if it be of so small
use, that upon its divulgement, it is not probable there will arise so much
honor to God, and edification of the Church, as may preponderate those
mischiefs, that hurly-burly, those tumults, and contentions in the Church,
which in all likelihood will ensue thereby, thou must then forbear to vent it,
either from press, or pulpit; so shall thou best consult for thine own private
quiet, and public peace. And we must follow after things that make for peace.
and edification: Romans 14. 19. About such matters to be contentious, we have no
custom, nor the Churches of God: and indeed about them to be contentious were
the right pranke of a Schismatic: for not only he is a Schismatic (says Non
enim Schismaticus eo (...), quod fover perversum dogma, (...) comingit
aliquando, ut sententia schismatici (...) verissima sit, tamen quia eam neque
loco neque tempore debitis, (...) necessitate (...), Schismaticus est, and
(...) (...) Dei (...) enim non (...) (...) Ecclesiae, ostendit se non adductum
studio gloriae Christi, sed suae potius existimationis Ecclesia turbasle.
Cameron in (...) quaedam N. T. loca. Tom. 2. in Mat. c. 18. v. 7.
Cameron) who maintains a perverse Tenet: a man may hold a very true opinion,
and yet play the Schismatic, and give scandal unto the people of God by
delivering it in a rash, unpeaceable, and unseasonable manner, neither in fit
place, nor due time, no necessity urging thereunto. for seeing in determining
of his opinion the glory of God, and weal of the Church lie not at the stake,
he plainly shows, that he has troubled the Church, lead with desire of not
Christ's glory, but his own Credit. I confess indeed, that a controverted, and
suspected truth even of this low quality may be peaceably, and modesty
professed, and debated too in private, but a public promulgation thereof is at
any hand to be forborne, non sub intuitu mali, sed minoris (...), not under the
apprehension of any evil in the truth, but only as a lesser good, which will
not consist with a greater, the tranquillity of the Church; or if you will, the
public promulgation of such a truth is to be forborne, sub intuitu mali, etsi
non simpliciter, tamen per accidens talis: under the apprehension of evil, not
in the controverted truth, but in the promulgation thereof, which though it be
not simply evil, yet becomes accidentally so, to wit, by comparison, in
respect of a greater good then required, preservation of the general quiet;
with which for the present it cannot stand, unto the care of which it is
opposed, though not primo and per se, yet ex consequenti connexione virtutum,
as Suarez upon another occasion phraseth it. But I digress.

To go on to that appearance of evil in doctrines, which is in the
expressions used in their proposal, a thing I could wish it were not to rife
amongst many, who like no truth, unless delivered in heretical terms; men
wonderfully taken with the language of Ashdod, the Romish dialect. But let it
be our care to refrain all words, and phrases, which carry an appearance of
either heresy or schism; for though they may, and are by us meant in an
orthodox sense, yet carry they a shrewd show of evil, make others jealous, and
suspicious of our soundness, and therefore In rebus (...) verba debent esse
casta, and (...). and quae rem ipsam (...) exprimant, and haereticis non
praestent occasionem calumniandi. (...). Martinez; lib. 12. de locis cap. 9. ad
(...).
Canus although he will by no means assent, absolutely to that usual saying;
ex verbis inordinate prolatis fit haeresis: yet he is content to approve of it,
if it be moderated with this caution, secundum praesumptionem audientium, and
judicum, qui per exteriora signa debent judicare de haeresi: if it be
understood according to the supposall of hearers, and judges, who ought and
indeed can judge of heresy only by outward signs. Between a minister and
Popery let there be a great Chasma, a distance as wide as between heaven, and
earth, nay heaven, and hell: yet if his phrase do but smell of Popery, if his
words, though not his meaning, trench near upon it, men will presently exclaim
that he has a Pope in his belly, at least that he sounds for a Parley, and
thinks upon conditions of peace with the Romish harlot. And besides as this
suspicious complying in phrase, and language with the known errors of
Popelings, or other novellers, and corrupt teachers grieves the settled and
judicious, so farther it staggers weaklings, confirms and hardens aliens, and
Apostates: rather opens than stops the mouths of gainsaying carpers, and
sooner disadvantageth the truth, than converts an adversary. So far is it
from effecting the usually pretended end, reconciliation; as that to use the
similitude of our Savior, Mat. chapter 9. v. 16. like the putting of a new piece
of cloth unto an old garment, it makes the rent worse, and wider. There goes
a manuscript from hand to hand, said to be penned by a learned Dr Sanderson.
Doctor of this Church, wherein (that amidst notwithstanding all the variety of
opinions there may be yet preserved in the Church the unity both of faith, and
charity) private men are advised in their own writings to observe formam,
sanorum verborum, and to abstain not only from suspected opinions, but as
much as may be also from phrases and speeches obnexious to misconstruction and
exception.

For first, it is not enough, much less a thing to be gloried in, for a man to
be able by subtilty of wit, to find loop-holes, how to (...), and by colorable
pretenses, to make that, which through heat of passion, or violence of
opposition has fallen from him unadvisedly, to seem howsoever defensible. But
he should have a care to suffer nothing to pass from him, whereat an ingenious
and dispassionate adversary (though dissenting from him in opinion,) might yet
have cause to take distaste, or exception.

And besides, it were a thing of dangerous consequence in the Church, if every
man should be suffered to publish freely whatsoever might by some strain of
wit be made capable of a good construction, if of it self it sounded ill, or
suspiciously. For so many (...), unhappy notions implicitly and virtually
serving to the patronage and protection of Schism or heresy, might be
cunningly conveyed into the minds of men, and impressions thereof insensibly
wrought in their hearts, to the great damage and distraction of the Church.

This last reason for the substance you may meet with in Aquinas 2. 2 dae. q.
11. a. 2. where (having told us out of Hierome, ex verbis inordinate prolatis
fit haeresis: that by unwary irregular expressions, by words disorderly spoken,
the most dangerous heresies have often taken their first rise, and original)
he afterward gives us the reason hereof: Similiter enim per verba quae quis
loquitur, suam fidem prositetur: est enim consessio actus fidei: and ideo si
sit inordinata locutio circa ea quae sunt fid. i, sequi potest ex hoc corruption
fidei: Unde Leo Papa quadam Epistola ad Proterium Episcopum Alexandrinum dicit,
quod inimici crucis Christi, omnibus and verbis nostris insidiantur and
syllabis, si ullam illis vel tenuem occasionem demus, qua Nestoriano sensui nos
congruere mentiantur. Likewise a man professes his faith by words, which he
speaks; for confession is an outward act of faith, and therefore, if there be
but an inordinate speech about matters of faith, the corruption of faith may
hereupon ensue.

Whence Leo the Pope, in a certain Epistle unto Proterius Bishop of Alexandria
says, that the enemies of Christ's Cross lie in wait for all our words, and
syllables, if in them we give any the least occasion, upon which they may saine
that we comply with Nestorianisme. Hence is it that Aquinas himself having
proposed this question, whether or no this proposition be true, Christ is a
creature in his answer thereunto tells us, first in general, cum haereticis
nec nomina debemus habere communia, ne (...) errori favere videamur, then more
particularly, unto the question; that the Arrian heretics have said that
Christ is a creature, and less than the Father, in regard not only of the
humane nature, but also divine person, and therefore resolves, that lest we
should seem to countenance their error, we must not say absolutely that
Christ is a Creature, and less than his Father; but only with this
limitation, according to the humane nature.

Ariani autem heretici Christum dixerunt esse creaturam, and minorem Patre, non
solum ratione humanae naturae, sedetiam ratione (...) personae, and ideo non
est absolute dicendum, quod Christus sit (...), vel minor Patre, sed cum
determinatione, scilicet secundum humanam naturam. Nay not only Aquinas, but
generally all the Schoolmen, and Civilians too, are so precise in this
particular, as that among the degrees of damnable propositions are ranked by
them not only propositions down rightly heretical, or (...), but also
Propositio (...), quae etiam male (...), (...) (...), aurium offensiva, (...),
quae praebet occasionem ruinae auditoribus, hoc est facilitatem cadendi in
haeresin, ut sunt multae propositiones, quae licet cum modificatione adjuncta,
sunt verae, per se tamen and absolute sine modificatione prolatae videntur
favere propositionibus haereticalibus. Ut si quis assereret simpliciter Patrem
majorem Filio, and Deum in incarnatione factum creaturam, and similes, quae mag
is sunt exponendae, (...) extendendae. Arnoldus Albertinus de agnoscendis
assertionibus Catholicis and hereticis. quaest. 60. Propositio haeresin
sapiens, aut male circa ea, quae ad fidem pertinent, sonans, est illa quae in
prima significatione, quam verba prima facie ostendunt, sensum (...)
haereticum, quamvis (...) intellecta sensum aliquem habet verum. Alphonsus a
Castro de justa haereticorum punitione: cap. 3.
propositio sapiens haeresin, propositio male sonans, every proposition, that
does but smell, that has but a smack of heresy, that sounds but ill or
suspiciously; and such are all propositions, that in the first signification,
which their words at first blush seem to import, have an heretical sense; all
propositions, that of themselves, that is, uttered absolutely without any
explanation, or qualification, seem to favor or countenance heretical
propositions, allthough they be capable of a good construction, and with many
cautions, limitations, and restrictions might pass for current. And therefore
was it, that the Council of Basil condemned this proposition, Christ sins
daily, because taken properly it is false and against the faith, although perhaps
it may be freed from error, if expounded in a unproper sense, thus; Christ
sins daily, not in himself, but his members. Explicatur optime, modo supra
tacto de propositione aequivoca, quae in proprio aliquo sensu, potest esse
haeretica, and in also etiam proprie Catholica, nam illa absolute, and sine
distinctione, vel declaratione prolata merito dicitur male sonans, in quo
distinctio alia (...) potest. Nam quaedam propositio dicitur ab extrinseco male
sonans, alia ab intrinseco. Ab extrinseco vocatur, quando suspicio, vel malus
sonus, non (...) propositione nude sumpta, sed cum circumstantiis personae,
loci, aut temporis oritur. Suarez. de triplici virture Theologica tract. de
fide disp. 19. Sect. 7. Dicendum igitur est, quod propositio sapiens haeresin
illa est, quae quamvis non appareat haeresis manifesta, quin potius aliquando
poterit habere aliquem bonum sensum, tamen ex qulbusdam (...), vel ex part
asserentis, vel ex temporum calamitate, saporem quendam (...) haeresis, and
suspicionis judicio prudentum and sapientum, id est, suspicionem quandam
majorem vel minorem pro qualitate circumstantiarum. Bannes.
Suarez says, that if an equivocall proposition having two proper senses, one
Cathelick, another heretical be delivered absolutely without any distinction,
or declaration, in which sense it is meant, it is then deservedly said to be
propositio male sonans. The same author goes on and tells us, that a
proposition is said to be male sonans, not only ab (...), but also ab
extrinseco when the suspicion or ill sound thereof arises not from the
proposition taken nakedly, as it is in it self, but considered jointly with
the circumstances either of the person delivering, or of the time and place, in
which it is delivered. Omitting his instance, I will give you others more true,
and savory. The word Sacrament with the ancients sounded no other, than an holy
significant rite; in those times then to have called matrimony, orders, etc.
Sacraments, had been (it may be) without all manner of offense. But now, since
the Church of Rome has peremptorily determined, that therebe Seven Sacraments
properly and strictly so called, seven outward and sensible signs, which by
divine institution, have annexed unto them the promise of justifying grace. He
that shall now term any thing a Sacrament, besides Baptism, and the Lords
Supper, renders himself thereby justly suspected.

In the writings of the Fathers, the words of satisfaction, and merit have been
of large use. Satisfaction signified every bitter afflictive acknowledgment, or
penitential mortification of our sins, whereby we prevent, and turn away
God's hand, and punishments for them. Merit, denoted only obtaining,
procurement, impetration, and according to this acception of the words, a man
might safely have heretosore affirmed, that our prayers, alms, and other good
works are satisfactory and meritorious. But now since some of the Romanists
have wrested these sayings of the Fathers unto a worse sense, than they were
uttered in: and hereupon taught that works are properly satisfactory, just
compensations for our sins, wherein we make recompense unto Gods wronged
justice, and redeem our selves at least from temporal punishments; that works
are strictly and properly meritorious of eternal life, deserving and earning
it ex condigno, in the way of condign wages; as if there were an equality or
due proportion between it and them, without all regard unto Gods gracious
acceptance of them; he that shall now aver these propositions, may without
breach of charity be justly thought to embrace them in that false, and
erroneous sense, which our adversaries the Papists take them in.

Hitherto concerning doctrinall appearance of evil, in Doctrines. Practical
appearance of evil in manners or matters of practice next follows; Dr Sclater
in locum.
and that may again be divided into (...) or Imaginary. The distinction is the
same with that of others. Aliquid (...) speciem mali, vel per se ex condition
operis, vel per accidens ex aliorum (...).

The difference between these must be well weighed, else we may as foully be
mistaken, as once the Pentickes were, who, as Florus tells us, fighting in a
night with the Romans, per errorem longius cadentes umbras suas quasi hostium
corpora petebant: mistaking their own shadows projected long as at the going
down of the Moon, laid at them as at the very bodies of their enemies: or as
the Romans themselves, were, unto whom when Tiberius Gracchus touched his head
with his hand to exhort the people, as by a sign, to stand upon their guard
for their lives, it seemed as if he demanded a diadem. Cum (...) ad
defensionem salutis suae manu caput tangens, praebuit speciem regni sibi, and
diadema poscentis, Flor. lib. 3. cap. 14. To distinguish them then, a real
appearance of evil flows per se ex natura operis, from the nature, and
condition of the fact it self: when that of it self, and in it is own nature,
is a very probable sign of evil: and so it is, when it is ordinarily done for
an evil end, when it is per se an occasion of Sin in our selves, and of
scandal unto others: it must be occasio data, non accepta.

First, when naturally, and not only casually, it may prove, and ordinarily
does prove an occasion of an incentive to sin in our selves.

Secondly, when it becomes an occasion of scandal or offense, of scandal
tending unto sin in the weak, of scandal tending unto sorrow and vexation
in the strong and discreet:

Such an appearance is there of adultery, in a man's lying in bed with another
man's wife, though he has no carnal knowledge of her.

Talis sc. materialis usus circumcisionis semper habet speciem mali, non ex
accidentia tantum sed quasi per se supposito Eccesiae stau. Suarez. de legibus
lib. 9. cap. 14.
Such an appearance of Judaisme, (than which few greater evils) is there in
the (c) circumcision of those Ethiopian Christians, that live under Prester
John. Such was the appearance of evil in Christians fitting at meat in the
Temples of Paganish Idols, in Naamans bowing himself in the house of Rimmon,
however Cajet an excuse him with a pretty distinction, inter genu (...)
imitativam, and genu flexionem obsequii. And such also is that appearance of
evil in a good man's intimate fellowship with bad ones, in a true and formal
compliancy with aliens in the signs of profession. As in a Protestants
presence at the superstitious, and Idolatrous worship of Papists, or in any
other complementings with them in the expression of that worship.

Now no actions that have this real appearance of evil are upon any pretext
whatsoever to be ventured upon, and for this I shall give two Reasons.

First, because in them there is allwaies a scandal given, an active scandal,
as is plain from Aquinas his definition of scandal, 2. 2 dae. qu. 43. art. 1.
Scandalum (says he) understand it of an active seandall) est dictum vel factum
minus rectum praebens alteri occasionem ruinae. For a word or fact is Dicitur
autem minus rectum, and non absolute malum, aut non rectum, ad denot and
umposse etiam scandali rationem esse in actu, qui non sit undequaque pravus,
sed tantum habeat speciem mali; aut qui duntaxat ratione (...) sc. ruinae
alterius, malus sit, licet (...) per se omnino sit bonus. Itaque quamvis per
illam particulam, minus rectum significetur in praedicta (...) actus, qui ex
aliquo capite careat debita (...), atque adeo simpliciter sit non rectus, seu
pravus, tamen propter dictam rationem merito hoc ipsum significatur illo modo
dicendi, scil: minus rectum. Non enim id duntaxat minus rectum appellari solet,
quod simpliciter rectum est, licet non adeo, comparatione alterius; sed etiam
id; quod propter aliquem defectum est minus rectum, quam simpliciter debet, and
quod ideo est absolute, and simpliciter malum. Juxta illud D. Dionysil cap. 4
de divinis nominibus: Bonum consurgit ex integra causa, malum autem ex
quocunque (...). Greg: de Valentia Comment: Theol. Tom: 3. Quest. 18. Punct. 1.
minus rectum some way or other irregular, not only when it is a sin in it
self, but also when it has a manifest show of sin; for the bare and naked
show of sin may ( praebere alteri occasionem ruinae) morally lead another to
sin, may be the moral cause of another sin, as well as sin it self; the
actions, in which there is only an appearance of sin, may yet provoke
another unto the practice of sin, as the performance of the sinful action it
self: To see a Christian sitting at meat in an Idols Temple, at an Idols
feast, may tempt a raw convert unto Idolatry, as well as to behold him knceling
before an Idol. For this I could muster up the suffrages of all the schoolmen,
a generation yet of divines, that are none of the precisest either in
positions, or practice. But I will not trouble my Reader with the testimonies
of above two of them. Opus malum (says Suarez) vel (...) speciem mali, quod de
fe inductivum est ad pecc andum, vitandum est; nam illud est vere scandalum
activum, ut patet ex desinitione ejus, moraliter enim inducit hominem ad malum.
Quod (...) non operteat esse vere malum, sed satis sit apparere, patet, 2 These.
5. 22. 1 Cor. 12. Ratio est, quia tenemur recte operari, non selum coram Dco
sed ctiam coram hominibus. Secundo, quia cum opus habet speciem mali, inducitur
proximus ad malum opus, non selum sua malitia, sed etiam ex vi mei operis, and
ex quadam fragilitate. (...), op. de triplici virtute tract. 2 disp 10. sect.
3. Quotiescunque datur occasio scandali (says Vasquez) malo opere, aut habente
speciem mali, semper imputatur scandalum tribuenti occasionem, sive scandalum
(...) ex malitia, sive infirmitate, aut ignorantia. Tunc enim qui (...)
occasionem scandali, peccat peccato scandali activi, quod nulla ratione licet.
Ratio vero est, quia nulla justa aut rationabili causa excusari potest aliquis
a peccato, qui coram alio peccat, vel exercet opus habens speciem mali: and
ideo jure optimo dicitur tribuere occasionem peccandi, quia tale opus ex se
occasio est peccandi. Vasquez opusculis Moralibus. tract. de scandalo.

But now (to proceed unto a second reason) besides the evil of scandal in
actions, that carry a real appearance of evil, there is also reductive the
guilt of that evil of which they have an (...); for that command, which
forbids such a sin, forbids all the shows and occasions of it, all the
preparatives unto it; as is usually observed by Commentators upon the
Decalogue. Thus the prohibition of adultery takes in all the causes, and signs
thereof: by this rule to sit at meat in the Idols Temple, at the Idols feast,
was not only a sin of scandal, as being a provocation unto, and so a
participation of the sin of Idolatry in weak and ignorant spectators; but also
a sin of Idolatry by way of reduction, a sin against religion, a
transgression against that worship, which God requires. Suarez expresses
this, though somewhat obscurely, yet more fully: first he lays down this
conclusion; Quando aliquis indirecte inducit alium ad peccandum per actionem
malam, vel habentem speciem mali, etiam incurrit specialem malitiam scandali:
against this conclusion he propounds amongst others this objection; Sequitur
eum etc. per actionem non malam, sed habentem speciem mali contrahere duas
malitias. Vnam scandali contra charitatem: aliam illius speciei peccati, ad
quam proximus inducitur. Consequens est contra divum Thomam hic, et sumitur ex
Paulo primo ad Corinth. 8 and 12. Vbi manducantem scandalose sacrificata
Idolis, non reprehend reprehendit, ut Idolatram, sed ut scandalosum. Sequela
autem patet, quia ille est (...) talis malitiae, ergo incurrit illam. Unto this
his answer is: that an action only evil in appearance may have a double
obliquity in it, to wit, that of scandal, and that of which it is an
appearance, unto which it induces Concedo, inquit, ibi esse duas malitias. Est
tamen advertendum, (...) contra aliquam virtutem peccari. Vno modo per se
primo, quia (...) agitur contra objectum ejus, vel circumstantias illi ex se
debitas, and hoc modo actio solum mala in apparentia, nullam virtutem (...).
Alio modo peccari potest tantum ex consequenti connexione virtutum. Nam ut
dictum est 1. 2 quia actus virtutum sunt undique boni, quando hic, and nunc
actus alicujus virtutis (...) esse contrarius alteri virtuti, ( quamvis in suo
objecto, vel circumstantiis quasi intrinsecis (...) habeat defectum) non potest
prudenter sicri, atque adeo neque est actus virtutis simpliciter, and ideo
participat malitiam contrariam utrique virtuti, sed alteram per se, alteram
quasi per accidens, and consequenter. Sic etiam propria malitia scandali fere
semper fundatur in alia malitia, tamen ex consequenti, and per accidens, semper
habet aliquo-modoillam conjunctam ex defectu circumstantiae debitae, saltem
propter aliam virtutem, propter quam non (...) prudenter cessandum (...) ab
opere hic, and nunc, habente speciem mali, quamvis ex se esset alias honestum.
Suar: de triplici virtute Theolog. tract. de charitat: disp. 10. (...). 2. It Is
of this real appearance (...) believe that the Apostle is here only to be
understood. But yet to make this our discourse complete I shall also take in
consideration that appearance of evil in an action which is but imaginary; and
this is ascribed thereunto from our own, or others (...) and censures thereupon.

First, from our own. And here, if a man be in his own Conscience steadfastly,
fully and firmly persuaded, that such an action is evil and unlawful, which
yet in truth is not so, but lawful: what ought he to do?

These times afford many instances by which we may exemplisy this case: There
are many Sectaries that profess they think it unlawful to frequent the
public Ordinances, to pay tithes unto the Minister, Contribution unto the
Magistrate; and there be some, that think it unlawful to swear in any cause,
though called thereunto by a Magistrate; and yet all these particulars are not
only things lawful, but bounden duties.

For (...) we must premise two things.

First, we must take into our consideration, the nature of the action, and the
condition of the person that harbors this misperswasion of the action: the
action in its nature may be either necessary, or indifferent and arbitrary: and
the person misjudging it may be, in respect thereof, either sui juris, or
determined therein by the lawful command of some superior power.

Secondly, we must with Durand distinguish betwixt (...), and (...), to bind,
and to bind unto. Sciendum (says he) lib. 2. did. 39. qu. 5. quod aliud est
ligari, aliud obligari, qui. n. obligatur debet, vel tenetur, id facere ad quod
(...), nec quantum est exparte sua aliter absolvitur ab obligatione. Ligari
autem (...) (...), qui (...) dispositus est circa aliquod agibile, quod non
potest licite procedere, prout exigit natura illius agibilis, ad modum illius
qui ligatur corporaliter, nec potest procedere etiam in recta and plana via.
Conscience is said obligare to bind unto, when it is a bounden duty to do or
not do what it dictates, when it is not only a sin to do any thing against it,
but also not to do according to it: Conscience is said ligare merely to bind,
when it is a sin as to act against it, so also to act according to it.

Capreolus and others that follow him quarrel with this distinction that
Durand puts between ligare and obligare: But Capreolus himself (...) down a
distinction of obligation, that will come unto all one: Obligatio ( inquit)
potest referri ad duo. Primo ad conformandum se tali conscientiae, and ad nullo
modo discordandum illi, and ad non deponendum eam, secundo ad non discordandum
ei, sednon ad conformandum, nec ad non deponendum. Primo strictissime sumitur,
and illo modo Conscientia crronea non obligat. Secundo sumitur large, and illo
modo intelligitur conclusio nostra, quod conscientia (...) obligat, quia habens
eam tenetur non discordare illi, ita quod illa stante faciat oppositum, quod
illa dictat. Nec (...) tonetur so conformare illi, nec tenetur eam conservare,
immo potest, and tenetur eam deponere. Here his obligation largely so called
differs nothing from Durand's ligation; The Controversy then is but a strife of
words; and therefore not worthy the heeding.

These things thus premised I shall lay down four Conclusions. First
Conclusion.


First, if the action in its nature be not necessary, but indifferent, and
arbitrary, and the person mis udging it, be in respect thereof suijuris, not
determined therein by the command of any superior power. Why then he is bound
in Conscience during this his opinion, to abstain from the action. (For we
suppose it (...) rent; and a man may lawsully forbear action where there is no
necessity of doing, a licitis po (...) absque (...) abstineri.) We suppose it,
although indifferent, yet against (...): and (...) is done (...) (...), with a
settled reluctance of a man's own judgment, and conscience against it, cannot be
of faith, and whatsoever is not of faith is sin See Dr (...) in lecum.
Romans 14. 23. That is (...) action is done without a firm persuasion of the
lawfulness thereof, let it be quoad rem, and essentially, in it selse lawful,
nay necessary, yet it becomes quoad hominem and accidentally evil, unto him it
is sin. Now that action may lawfully, must necessarily be forborne, that can be
omitted, but cannot be committed without sin.

But now on the contrary (to come to a second Conclusion) if either Second
(...).
the action be in its nature necessary, or the person entertaining this
misprision thereof be justly enjoined persormance of it by some superior
power, that can herein lawfully challenge obedience from him by a law, not
(...) p nall; and so the action too, though indifferent for its nature, be yet
in its use, and unto him become (...). Why then this misperswasion of its
unlawfullnesse cannot bind to abstain from it; for so it should oblige unto
either omission of a necessary duty, or else disobedience unto lawful
authority, both great sins. And nulla est obligatio ad illicita. There is no
obligation unto things unlawful can lie upon us.

For, first, obligation is only to that which is a moral good; now nothing
unlawful can be a moral good; and therefore an erroneous Conscience cannot
oblige unto it.

Secondly, no command of an inferior power can oblige, if it be contrary to
the command of a superior power; But if an erroneous Conscience should bind
unto things unlawful, it should oblige against the commandment of God, whose
(...) Conscience is, Indeed Conscience is the next rule of voluntary actions:
But

First, it is a well- informed censcience that ought to be this rule, the will
is not bound to follow a blind guide: for then being of it self (...)
potentia, it must needs fall into the ditch.

And secondly, conscience is but a subordinate rule unto the Law, and Word of
God; and therefore its power to oblige is derived there from: it obliges not
therefore, but by virtue of some command of Gods Law, or word; and Gods Law
cannot command things unlawful, for then it should clash with it self.

Diversimode tamen ligat Conscientia (...) and erronea, recta simpliciter ligat
and (...) se, erronea autem secundum quid and peraccidens. Dico autem rectam
ligare simpliciter, quia ligat absolute and in omnem eventum. Sienim aliquis
conscientiam habet de vitando adulterio istam conscientiam (...) peccato non
potest deponere, quia in hoc ipso quod eam deponeret errando graviter peccaret.
Ea autem manente non potest (...) in actu sine peccato. Unde absolute ligat and
in omnem eventum: sed conscientia erronea non ligat (...) secundum (...), and
sub condition. Ille enim cui dictat conscientia, quod tenetur fornicari, non
est obligatus ut fornicationem sine peccato dimittere non possit, nisi sub hac
condition, si talis conscientia duret. Haec autem conscientia removeri potest
absque peccato, unde talis conscientia non obligat in omnem eventum. Potest
enim aliquid contingere, scilicet Depositio conscientiae, quo contingente
aliquis ulterius non ligatur. Quod autem sub condition tantum est, secundum
quid esse dicitur. Dico (...) quod conscientia recta per se ligats erronea vero
per accidens. Quod ex hoc patet, qui enim vult velamat unum propter alterum,
illud quidem propter quod amat, reliquum per se amat, quod vero propter aliud,
quasi per accidens, sicut qui vinum amat propter dulce, amat dulce per se,
vinum autem per accidens. Ille autem qui conscientiam erroneam (...) credens
esse rectam, alias non etraret nisi inhaereret conscientiae etroneae propter
rectitudinem, quam in ea credit esse, inhaeret quidem per se loquendo rectae
conscientiae, sed erroneae quasi per accidens, in quantum (...) conscientiam
quam credit esse rectam, contingit, esse erroneam. (...) exinde est quod per se
loquendo ligatur a (...) recta, per accidens vero ab erronea. (...): Ex
Aquinate Lib. 2. sent. Did. 39. Quest. 1. Ar. 1.

Nemo potest obligati ad malum sub rationem mali, sed been ad malum, quod (...)
judicatur esse bonum, and quod proponitur sub ratione boni. Nec conscientia
obligat contra legem Dei per se formaliter, sed solum per accidens, and
materialiter, Becanus Sum: Theol: Scholast: T. 2. Tract. 1. chap. 4, Q. 7.


Capreolus, Becanus, Raynaudus with many others resolve that however a right
and well informed Conscience only binds unto a thing per se formaliter and in
omnem eventum; yet an erroneous conscience, denominated such from an invincible
and involuntary error, may oblige unto a thing materially, per accidens, sub
condition, and secundum quid. It obliges per accidens as it is apprehended
and believed to be right, and well informed; so that an erroneous Conscience is
adhered unto, for the rectitude supposed to be in it. It obliges sub
condition upon condition that such error of Conscience lasts: for it may be
removed without sin: and when it is removed the obligation cease; and then,
that which obliges conditionally, obliges only secundum quid, and not
absolutely.

Unto this I have three exceptions.

First, they limit themselves to error invincible and involuntary, which is
not imputable or blameworthy.

This error may be conceived to be; either in matter of fact, or in matter of
rule.

Error in matter of fact, as when Jacob mistook Leah for Rachell; as when a
poor subject, that cannot judge of the titles of primes, thinks a usurper to
be his lawful Sovereign, or as when a man takes goods left unto him by his
Parents to be truly his own, though perhaps a great part of them were gotten by
sraud or oppression, without any knowledge of his: These and the like
particulars are all impertinent unto our present purpose; and therefore I shall
not stay upon the consideration of them.

Error in matter of Law, right, or rule is again twofold, either in regard of
law natural, or law positive. Now unto all that have actual use of reason,
The error of the law of nature is vincible, and voluntary; because the law of
nature is sufficiently promulgated unto them, it is written in their hearts,
Rom: 2. 15.

And we may say the same of Christians, that enjoy the plenary promulgation of
the Gospel, and are capable of understanding it: for the Gospel sufficiently
reveals all divine positives; so that a rational man may know them, and is
bound to know them; and Aquinas states it rightly. 1. 2 ae. q. 19. art 6.
voluntas (...) rationi erranti circaca, quae quis scire tenetur, (...) est
mala: If a man err concerning such things, as he may know, and is bound to
know, such an error is (at least indirecte) voluntary, and sinsull, and cannot
oblige.

A Second exception: Conscience has no power to oblige, but what it deriveth
from God: and therefore what it obliges unto; God also obliges unto: and God
is the moral cause, and consequently the Author of whatsoever he obliges to:
but he cannot be the moral cause, and author of that which is sin, and
unlawful, either per se, or per accidens and therefore neither he, nor his
deputy Conscience can oblige so much as per accidens unto that which is
unlawful.

A Third exception shall be the objection of Durand in the place above quoted:
Sola vera notitia de re (...) non (...), (...) magis confirmat: sed vera
notitia de eo quod (...) conscientia dictat, tollit (...), ergo obligatio nulla
suit. To be well informed, and to have a true knowledge of a thing cannot take
away any obligation to it; But to be well informed, and to have a true knowledge
concerning that, which an erroneous Conscience dictates, takes away all
obligation to it; Therefore there was never any such thing as an obligation to
it.

The most considerable objection is that of (...) [Sum: Theol. 2. part. p. 1.
tom. 2. tract. 1. cap. 4.] Durandus concedit illum p (...), qui operatur contra
hanc conscientiam: Ergo debet (...) (...), hanc conscientiam obligare. Nam ubi
non est (...), ibi (...) (...). Durand grants, that he sins who acts against
an erroneous Conscience: therefore he ought also to grant, that an erroneous
conscience obliges: for where there is no obligation there can be no sin.

But the answer hereunto is very easy by distinguishing concerning obligation,
which is twofold either as touching the (...), or manner of actions. Though
there be no obligation, as touching the matter of such actions, concerning
which an erroneous Conscience dictates: yet there is a general obligation as
(...) the manner of all actions, that they be done without the Contempt of
conscience: and therefore in every action where conscience is contemned, sin is
committed: Quaevis voluntas (says Aquinas, 2 dae. q. 19. art. 5.) a ratione
sive (...) sive errante discordans semper est mala.

Which brings me unto my third conclusion. Allthough this Third Conclusion.
erroneous conceit of the unlawfullnesse of this action, (...) to be necessary
either in its nature, or at least in its use, because lawfully commanded by
authority, does not obligare, that is, so bind, as that I must follow it; yet
it does ligare, so entangle and perplex, as that I cannot without sin oppose
it, and for this I shall allege these following reasons.

First, because whosoever goes against his Conscience, (whether ill or well
informed it matters not) goes against the will of God, although not for the
thing he does, yet for the manner of doing it, although not (...), yet
formally, and interpretatively: because whatsoever the Conscience (...), a man
takes for the will of God: each man's Conscience being (...) Deputy God to
inform, and direct him. Look as he who reviles, wounds, kills a private man,
mistaking him for the King, is guilty of high treason against the King
himself: so, he that 'thwarts the judgment of even an erroneous Conscience,
fights against God, wars against Heaven: because what his conscience says,
he thinks to be the voice of Heaven.

Thus you see, that he, who acts against an erroneous Conscience in such an
action, (...) himself as disaffected toward God: for he knowingly adventureth
upon that, which he thinks will infinitely displease him.

And in a second place: such an action is an argument of disaffection toward
that rule of our moral actions, which God has appointed: he that has an
erroneous Conscience, supposes it to be right and well informed: and
therefore, if he act against it, he slights that, which he takes to be the rule
of his working: and therefore his action is, for the (...) of it, lawless, and
irregular. Velle aliquid contra Synt (...) naturalem (...), id est, contra
primum aliquod principium (...) a (...) dictatum, omnino est malum and
peccatum. Sed qui vult id, quod ratio judicat esse malum and fugiendum, sive id
vere, five (...) judicet, vult aliquid contra synteresin: (...) (...) peccat.
Major est evidens, Adversatur namque id imprimis legi naturali, quae (...)
tissimum (...) in principlis primis moralibus. Minor probatur. Nam principium
illud primum, (...), malum non est prosequendum, sed vitandum: inprimis vetat,
ne quis, quantum in (...) est malum consectetur. Ut enim praecepta naturalla
affirmativa jubent inprimis (...) homo, quantum in ipso est, bonum prosequatur;
(...) etiam praecepta negativa (...) imprimis, ne (...) quantum in ipso situm
est, (...) malum. Qui autem (...) vere (...) false judicat aliquid esse malum,
and nihilominus illud prosequi (...), is hoc ipso, quantum in se est, sectatur
malum. Nam quod objectum ipsum per se sit revera bonum aut malum, hoc quidem
non est in hominis voluntate situm, sed illud solum, ut quod ipse malum judicat
vel bonum, id vitare, aut pro equi velit. (...) qui judicans aliquid esse malum
sive vere, sive false. (...) nihilominus vult, is quantum in ipso situm est,
vult malum, and proinde (...) violat legem illam naturalem (...), quae id (...)
inprimis vetat. Greg. de (...) tom. 2. disp. 2. q. 14 (...). 4.


Thirdly, in such an action there is a depraved, affection toward sin: and
that in Morals is the fountain of all illness: If a man's conscience be right,
and well informed, and he act against it, every one will grant, that such an
action proceeds from the love of that which is sin: and there is the same
reason to say as much, of that action, which is against the dictate of an
erring Conscience.

Besides these reasons I shall allege Scriptures (to omit Rom: (...). 23.
already spoken of) (...) quotes also Romans 14. 14. To him that esteems any
thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. The learned Dr Hammond alleges
for the same purpose the 1 Cor. 8. 7. For some with (...) Idoli (...)
Apostolus, non (...) qua quis recte de simulacris (...): (...) male
interpretatur and male probat Cajecanus, eain re singularis: sed (...) quo quis
existimet Idolum esse aliquid, id est (...) virtutis: ac proinde cibos (...) ab
idolo pati mutationem aliquam, sicque (...) and co. (...) posse edentes. Quod
quidem judicium erroneum est: atque ex (...) sequitur ut talem habens conscien:
iam, si edat idolothytum, edat illud quasi idolothycum: id est quali immutatum
aliquo mo 'o per (...) quod idolis sacrificatum sit ut eius opinione tam idolum
qua idolothytum sit aliquid.

Et conscientia ipsorum, cum sit infirma, polluitur. Illative pars haec
exponenda est: ut (...) sit: atque ita animus (...) erronea hujusmodi
conscientia imbutus, cum (...) infirmus, (...) quod (...): (...), qua (...)
(...) Dei quam habe, tapplicet ad particulares conclusiones, ut supra dictum
est, polluitur peccato: dum videlicet contra conscientiam quam idolothyto
habent, existimantes edentes contaminari, de illo edunt. (...) in locum.


Conscience of the Idol, i e. (...) resolved in mind that it is not lawful to
eat or taste of any (...) or (...), part or portion of the Idol-feast, (whether
(...), at the idol table, or having bought it at the shambles (as it seems was
the fashion of those (...), to be sold there at second hand, chap. 10. 25.)
(...) it unlawful to eat any meat consecrated to that use, do yet eat that
which is of this nature, and by so doing, their weak i. e. uninstructed
Conscience, is polluted, i. e. they sin against their Conscience, do that which
they are persuaded they may not do, which although it be never so innocent and
harmless thing in it self (an Idol being simply nothing) yet to them which
do it, when they think it unlawful (and all have not knowledge, says he in
the beginning of the verse, i. e. are not sufficiently instructed in their
duty) it is pollution or sin.

I shall proceed unto the fourth, and last conclusion. The only way then for a
man to rescue himself out of these difficulties is to rectify his Conscience,
to depose, and correct the error thereof, so he shall escape contempt of the
judgment of his own Conscience on the one hand, and breach of either Gods or
man's laws on the other.

This Rayunaudus (from whom I know none do dissent) expresses as follows [
Moral. disc. did. 4. q. 3. art. 1. n. 247.] Unum igitur illud subsidium
superest, ut judicium de malitia vincibiliter errans, abjiciatur: Si enim neque
adhaerere ei licet, ut primo loco monstravimus: neque illi obsistere, ut nunc
diximus; non aliud superesse potest, quam ut homo errorem depellat, quod posse
supponitur, (...) de malitia sensum induat: alioqui quocunque se vertat, in
culpa erit.

An imaginary appearance of evil issues, Secondly, from the supposals of, not
only ourselves, but others that censure it, whose judgments are either misled
by ignorance, and weakness, or else blinded through pride and prejudice: such
was that in the moving of Hannah's lips, not afforded by her fact, but only
fastened on it by old Eli his hasty censoriousnesse: no other appearance of
evil was there in our Saviors healing the diseased, his Disciples plucking
and eating of the ears of corn on the Sabbath day; 'twas not grounded on
their actions; but only (...) by the Pharisees swelling uncharitableness.
What other was that appearance of evil, with which the Gentiles charged the
primitive Christians, lifting up of their hands in prayer, when they accused
them for adoration of the Clouds? as appears by Tertullian, and by a Poet of
their own, qui puras nubes and coeli numen adorant. (...) part. 2. page 63.


This imaginary appearance of evil proceeds, from either supposals of
wilful, or weak ones: The censures and supposals of wilful, proud, and
wicked ones, and the scandals thence arising, scandala Pharisaeorum, I
determined ( in my first Edition of this (...)) that we might slight: our
warrant (said I) is our (...) president. When his Disciples told him, that the
Pharisees took offense at his speech, he made no reckoning thereof, but
answered, let them alone, Matthew. 12. 13, 14. and we, warranted by his example,
may then be secure and regardlesse of many calumnies, and groundless
exceptions against the government, discipline, and ceremonies of our Church:
for (...) has been so much spoken and written concerning these subjects, as
that the pretense of weakness is quite taken away from those that are capable
of information.

First, here my censure of the non-conformists to be wilful, proud, and
Pharisaicall was very rash, and uncharitable: all that I can say in excuse for
my self is: that when I wrote this, I was a very young man, and conformity
unto the Ceremonies established by Law was then generally embraced, without any
of the least contradiction, for ought I knew; nay stoutly and zealously pleaded
for by men, whom I admired for the general report that went of their sanctity,
and (...) v. g. Dr John (...), Dr Sclater, Dr Sanderson and others: And then I
had read but one side, being an utter stranger unto what the Inconformitants
could say for themselves: and their adversaries represented their objections,
and answer, to be so weaks: and ridiculous: as that it is no great wonder, that
I was prejudiced against them: But, about the beginning of the long Parliament,
being awakened with the general complaint of the Godly against the Ceremonies,
I began to think a new of the controversy, and out of my former prejudice
intended a full vindication of the discipline, and Ceremonies of the then
Church of England: and in order hereunto I read all such books of the
non-conformist's as I could procure: for I knew well by experience, that a
controversy can never be well handled, unless all dissenting opinions
thereabouts be weighed: but upon perusal of the non-conformists I soon found:
that their adversaries most disingeniously misrepresented all that they said:
that they refused to join issue with them in the state of the Question: that
they came not up to an orderly grapple with their arguments: and that they
seldom regularly replied unto the solutions, which were given unto their
objections: and this quickly produced an alteration in my judgment, and I
believe it will do so too in all, that will make such an impartial search into
the matter; as I have done.

But Secondly, to come unto the examination of that aspersion: that the
scandals of the malicious, of Pharisaicall, and wilful spirits are not to be
regarded, so as to sorbear that, by which they are scandalized.

Gregory de Valentia: though he lay down the affirmative in the general, yet
afterward he delivers it to be his opinion: that we are to do what lies in
us to prevent the scandals of even Pharisees, so it may be done without any
great loss, or notable damage unto our selves. Existimo etiam, si quis cum
nullo suo, vel pene nullo detrimento posset impedire scandalum proximi
Pharisaicum, aliquid faciendo vel omittendo, debere ipsum facere. Nam ut
tradidimus supra in quaest. de correctione fraterna, etiam is qui ex malitia
peccaturus alioqui est, est in aliquali necessitate spirituali, ac proinde ut (
illic vidimus) debet ex charitate corrigi, vel aliter a peccati scandalo
impediri, quando id sine detrimento proprio fieri potest. tom. 3. disp. 3. q.
18. punct. 4.

For the better stating of this Question, I shall premise some distinctions of
scandal: a scandal is either active or passive.

An active scandal is in all such words, or deeds, as culpably occasion the
fall of another into sin: and this is again by Gregory de Valentia [tom. 3.
disp. 3. q. 18. punct. 1.] rightly subdivided into that which is per se, and
into that which is per accidens.

An active scandal per se is in such public acts, as either by the express
intent of the agent, or from their nature, and in themselves, are inductive
unto sin: and they are again twofold:

First, all public sins, or sins committed before another:

Secondly, all such public actions, as carry a real and manifest appearance
of sin.

An active scandal per accidens is in such things, as are not in themselves,
and in their own nature occasions of sin unto another: and this is, either in
an unseasonable performance of positive duties, commanded by affirmative
precepts, which are not necessary hic and nunc: or else by an unseasonable use
of our liberty in things (...).

A Passive scandal is the fall of another into sin: and this (by the author
but now mentioned) is subdivided into given, and taken.

Scandalum datum, a passive scandal given, is that which arises truly from
the active scandal of another, as from its moral cause.

Scandalum acceptum, a passive scandal that is only taken, is that which is
only the fault of the party scandalized, and cannot be imputed to any other,
as a moral cause: the words or deeds of another may be an occasion of it, but
not a culpable occasion.

I desire that these distinctions of scandal may be well heeded: for the want
of Consideration of them has occasioned a great deal of confusion in men's
discourses about scandal.

First, many exclude from active scandal all things that scandalize per
accidens: and then, what will become of those scandals Paul speaks against?
Romans 14. 1 Cor. chapter 8. chapter 10.

Secondly, most confound a passive scandal with scandalum acceptum, a scandal
that is only taken, and make them to be of an equal extent: whereas a passive
scandal may de distributed into both given, and taken: if it be culpably both
given, and taken: then it is scandalum datum: if it be culpably taken, and not
culpably given, then it is scandalum acceptum.

Well, these distinctions being thus premised: I suppose it will be agreed upon
by all sides: that the question is to be understood: First of active scandals,
our scandalizing of the wicked: or Secondly, (which comes all to one) of such
passive scandals of them, as are given by us, as well as taken by them: Not,
thirdly, of such passive scandals, as are only taken by them, not given by us:
for from the guilt of these we may wash our hands, so that there is no
obligation upon us to forbear those things, by which they are in this manner
scandalized.

My Conclusion shall be: that we are to eschew the active scandals, and
consequently scandala passiva data, of the wicked, and malicious, those that
are Pharisaicall and wilful spirits: this is apparent: First from (...)
prohibition of scandal, 1 Cor. 10. 32. Give none offense neither to the Jews,
nor to the Gentiles, etc. he spoke of unconverted Jews, and Gentiles, such as
were enemies unto the Christian faith: and the Jews were of all men the most
malicious enemies thereof.

Secondly, from our Saviors denunciation of a woe unto the world by means of
scandal, Matthew. 18. 7. (...) unto the world because of offenses; which
undeniably is to be extended unto all sorts of men.

Unto these two arguments we may add four other, taken from, First, the
distribution; (...), relation; Thirdly, effect; Fourthly, opposite of an active
scandal.

First, from the distribution of an active scandal, and perusal of the
members thereof: An active scandal (as I showed but now) is distributed into
scandalum per se, and per accidens: now there is no doubt, but that we are
carefully to avoid such things as scandalize the wicked, and malicious per se,
of themselves, and in their own nature, public sins, or such words, and deeds
as have a real appearance of sin: all the question will be concerning such
things as scandalize them only per accidens, our duties, and our
indifferencies: and by these they are frequently scandalized, and that out of
an erroneous opinion concerning their unlawfulness: in which regard the
resolution will be pertinent unto the matter in hand.

First then: duties, that are commanded by affirmative precepts, may be
forborne, hic and nunc, sometimes, and in some places, to avoid the scandal
of the wicked, and malicious. The usual instances are in reproof, admonition,
punishment of sin, and the like: and this is warranted

First, by the precept of our Savior, Matthew. 7. 6. Give not that which is holy
unto the dogs: neither cast ye your pearls before swine: lest they trample
them under their (...), and turn again and (...) you.

Secondly, by the example of David, Psalm. 39. 1, 2. I will keep my tongue with
a bridle, while the wicked is before me: I was dumb with silence, I held my
peace even from good.

Thirdly, by that rule in Divinity; affirmativa praecepta obligant semper, non
ad semper; they always bind, but not to always: they do not oblige to do the
things required at all times, but only, when they are expedient for the glory
of God, and the good of others: To reprove, and admonish sinners is a duty
commanded by God, Lev. 19. 17. Thou shall not hate thy brother in thine heart:
thou shall in anywise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him. But
now this duty is not to be performed unseasonably, when it is likely to bring no
glory to God, nor good unto others, but rather likely to scandalize them. Thus
every private man is not bound to run into an alehouse, or tavern, there to
reprehend a company of desperate drunkards, who would look upon his
reprehension as an act of pragmaticalnesse, and insolency, and for it be ready
to quoite him down the Stairs, or run him through with their swords: and as
imprudent an act would it be, in Spain, to run into their Churches, and there
to cry against the Idolatry of the Mass; and in the Streets of Constantinople
to declame against the impostures of Mahomet; for hereby we should scandalize
them indiscreetly, and foolishly occasion them, as to blaspheme our religion,
so to cut us in pieces.

Unto the (...) rule in Divinity I shall add another out of Logic; finis dat
mediis amabilitatem: it is the (...) only makes the means desirable: Now
reproof, admonition, punishment, and the like duties are enjoined as means,
in order to the reformation, and bettering of others: when therefore they are
not likely to conduce unto this end, but rather to oppose and hinder it,
prudence in such a case dictates an abstinence from them. But let us take two
exemplifications of this out of Aquinas 2. 2 dae. 9. 43. art. 7. The first is
concerning the punishment of sin: (...), quod poenarum inflictio non est
propter se expentenda: sed poenae infliguntur, ut medicinae quaedam ad
cohibenda peccata, and ideo in tantum (...) rationem justitiae, in quantum per
eas peccata cohibentur. Si autem per inflictionem poenarum (...) sit plura and
(...) peccata sequi, tunc poenarum inflictio non continebitur sub justitia. Et
in hoc casu loquitur August. in libro contra epistolam Parmenlani docet, quod
ubi (...) periculum timetur, a punitione peccatorum cessandum est.
August quando (...) ex excommunicatione aliquorum imminet periculum
schismatis: (...) enim excommunicationem far non pertinet ad veritatem
justitiae.

The second is concerning brotherly reproof: (...) quod correptio fraterna
ordinatur ad emendationem fratris: and ideo in tantum computanda est inter
spiritualia bona, in quantum hoc consequi potest. Quod (...) contingit si ex
correptione (...) (...), and (...) si propter scandalum correptio dimittatur,
non dimittitur spirituale bonum.

But to proceed next to the scandal of the wicked by our indifferencies: That
we are to forbear things indifferent when they scandalize the wicked, and
malicious. Parker [in his treatise of the Cross part. 2. page 57.] proves by
many instances: when the thing was indifferent, does not our Savior foregoe
his liberty, to please the malicious? as when he paid tribute lest he should
offend them? Matthew. 17. 27. They were malicious at Corinth, and seekers of
occasion against Paul, that were likely to be offended by his taking of wages
there: yet the thing, being no necessary duty, he thinks it his duty to
forbear his power therein, 1 Cor. 9. The Heathens are malicious to take
offense, when Christians go to Law for their own: yet, because going to law is
not a duty necessary, it must be forborne, and Christians rather must loose
their own, then give occasion of scandal to them, 1 Cor. 6. v. 6, 7. Unto
these examples let me add another (quoted by the same author elsewhere) out
of Ezra 8. 22. I was ashamed (says Ezra) to require of the King a band of
Soldiers and horsemen, to help us against the enemies in the way: because we
had spoken unto the King, saying, the hand of our God is upon all them for
good, that seek him, but his power and his wrath is against all them that
forsake him Here for Ezra to have asked of the King of Persia, a Heathen, a
band of soldiers, and horsemen for his safe conduct, was a thing lawful: and
yet he forbore it, lest he should scandalize him by begetting in him a
suspicion, that that was false, which he had told him concerning Gods power,
and justice.

A second argument is drawn from the relation of an active scandal: it is the
moral cause of a passive scandal; so that he who scandalizeth another,
partaketh of, and is accessory unto the sin of the party scandalized, and we
are not to partake of, or be accessory unto the sins of any, 1 Timothy 5. 22. We
must have no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness in any whomsoever,
(...). 5. 11.

A third argument is fetched from the effect of an active scandal: it is of a
soul destroying nature, and so a kind of spiritual murder: destroy not him
with thy meat for whom Christ died, Romans 14. 15. for (...) destroy not the
(...) of God, verse. 20. and who should not tremble at the guilt of the murder
of any soul whatsoever? for there is no soul so wicked, but may (for ought
thou know) be one of those, for whom Christ shed his most divine, and
precious blood.

The last argument is taken from the Opposite of scandal, Charity, and its act
beneficence: We are to love all, even our most malicious, and persecuting
enemies, Matthew. 5. 44. We are to do good unto all, though especially to the
household of says, Gal. 6. 10. We are to exercise patience, and meekness,
toward even those that oppose themselves, 2 Timothy 2. 14, 15. And from this it
will inevitably follow, that we are to scandalize none.

Here we have usually objected the example of our Savior, who slighted the
scandal of the Pharisees, Matthew. 15. 12, 13, 14. Then came his Disciples and
said unto him: know thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard
this saying? but he answered and said etc. let them alone they be blind leaders
of the blind etc.

The objection concerns only the scandalizing of them in things indifferent;
and unto it I shall give an answer in the words of Parker part. 2. part. 57. If
this be all the warrant we have, not to forbear in a thing indifferent for the
malicious, then have we no warrant at all, because the scandal (there) not
cared for, is when the Pharisees are (...), at his abstaining from their
washings, and his preaching of a true doctrine: both of which were necessary
duties for him to do. And when he defends his healing on sabbaths, and his
Disciples plucking ears, upon this reason they are duties of necessity and
charity, he plainly insinuates, there is no defense for deeds unnecessary,
when the malicious are scandalized.

In a second place I shall allege the Objection of the Schoolmen which by
Gregory de Valentia is thus urged [ Tom. 3. disp. 3. q. 18. punct. 4.] (...)
qui non ex ignorantia, aut infirmitate, sed ex malitia (...), non laborat tali
aliqua necessitate spirituali, cui non possit ipse sine open alterius proximi
facile prospicere mutando pravam suam voluntatem. Ergo alter non tenetur tunc
cum ali quo suo detrimento prospicere. Pharisees, the wicked, that are
scandalized out of mere malice, and not out of ignorance, or weakness are not
in any such spiritual necessity, or danger, but that they can casily provide
for the safety, and indemnity of their souls, without the help or assistance
of others, by changing their depraved will: and therefore others are not bound
to (...) any detriment for the prevention of their scandal.

The answer unto this may easily be foreseen, for here is nothing but
Jesuiticall dictates, that are altogether proofelesse.

First, Pharisees, the wicked, that are scandalized out of malice, are in a
greater spiritual necessity, and danger, then those, that are scandalized out
of ignorance, or weakness: for, they are in the snare of the divill, taken
captive by him at his will. 2 Timothy 2. 16.

And therefore, Secondly, they are more unable to help themselves, and prevent
their own falling into sin; for their hearts are altogether destitute of any
gracious habits: there is not in them the spirit, a renewed principle, to make
head, or resistance against the flesh, the sinful corruption of their natures:
there is need then of all help possible to keep them from falling: and all
will be uneffectuall, unless God also put in his helping hand.

Whereas he talks: that it is an easy matter for a wicked, and malicious man to
provide against all danger, and need of his soul, by changing his perverse,
and naughty will: this is a very gross Pelagian conceit: for it ascribes
that, unto the power of man's corrupt will, which can be wrought only by the
omnipotent grace of God.

By this time (I hope) the Reader is sufficiently satisfied that the active
scandals of the most wicked, and malicious are not to be contemned.

But yet there remains a great difficulty in the point to be cleared; and
that is, when an active-scandall is committed toward them, in our duties, and
indifferencies?

First, we actively scandalize them by our duties, when they are not rightly
circumstanced, seasonably performed, in due time, and place: when they are not
expedient unto those ends, for which God enjoined them: now when this is,
cannot be determined by any general rule, but every one must be left to be
guided by his spiritual prudence, and wisdom. [But for this hereafter I shall
allot a peculiar digression by it self.]

Secondly, we actively scandalize them by our indifferencies, when it is
probable they will occasion their passive scandal, their falling into sin; But
now this general rule is to be limited, and I shall give you three limitations
of it.

The first limitation: this rule is to be understood, when the use of our
indifferencies is likely to prejudice, and obstruct the propagation of the
Gospel, and the forbearance of them will in all probability conduce unto the
advancement of the Credit of the Gospel, and not otherwise, ordinarily: upon
this account, it would have been scandalous in Paul to have received
maintenance from the Corinthians: but it is now unscandalous in Ministers, to
accept, and challenge that maintenance, which is due unto them by the laws of
the land; for a general forbearance thereof now would soon be followed with
the utter ruin of the Gospel.

A second limitation: the sorementioned rule is to be understood, when the
forbearance of our indifferencies is likely to win upon the wicked, and
malicious, so as to further their conversion, and not otherwise, when it only
exposes unto their contempt, scorn, and derision, 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22.
Though I be free from all men (says Paul) (...) have I made my self servant
unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a few, that
I might gain the Jews: to them that are under the law, as under the law, that
I might gain them that are under the Law. To them that are without Law, as
without Law (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Christ) that I
might gain them, that are without Law. To the weak became I as weak, that I
might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all
means save some. Here it is very remarkable, that Paul was made, in things
indifferent, all things unto all men, only in order to their salvation, to
gain their souls unto Christ; and why should we abridge our selves in the use
of our liberty, in things that are of great expediency and convenience unto us,
when such a restraint of our liberty, is not a probable means of reaching the
said end? what reason can be given, why we should incommodate our selves, by
forbearing all such indifferencies, that wicked men are scandalized at, when
such forbearance is unprofitable unto their spiritual good, and unlikely to
bring them any jot the nearer unto God and Heaven?

A third limitation: the forementioned rule has not place, when by the
sorbearance of our indifferencies, at which some wicked men are scandalized,
there is incurred as great, if not a greater scandal, then that by their use:
as when they are hereby confirmed, and hardened in their error, and sin; and
others are hereby drawn into the like: prudenter advertendum est (says
Bernard) scandalum scandalo non emendari, qualis emendatio (...), si ut aliis
scandalum tollas, alios scandalizas.

Thus you see how the rule is to be limited; and without such, or the like
limitations, rigidly to press it, would make against both the liberty, and
peace of conscience.

First, against the liberty of Conscience: for it would in great part evacuate,
and annull the grand charter of our Christian liberty in things indifferent, it
would (as Peter says in another case) put a yoke upon the neck of the
disciples, which neither our Fathers were, nor we are able to bear, Acts 15.
10. All things are lawful for me (says Paul) But I will not be brought under
the power of any, 1 Cor. 6. 12. But now if we must forbear all our lawful
conveniences, at which wicked men perhaps will be purposely scandalized, we
should be brought under the power of them, we should be little better then
their slaves; and what an unspeakeable, and intolerable vassalage would that
be? Quoties scandalum passivum alterius futurum est, ex malitia nullus debet
(...) opus, quod nec est malum, nec (...) speciem mali propter malitiam
alterius, quando opus illud utile est temporaliter, vel spiritualiter operanti,
quia non postulat ratio, ut (...) alterius cum damno nostro succurramus, (...)
quilibet malitia sua possit nobis vocere, ut (...) opus nobis (...) autem
alterias nobis vocere non debet Lucssius Turrianus.


Secondly it would make against the peace of Conscience; for it would so
perplex men's consciences with doubts, and uncertainties; as that they would
hardly know when, and how to act in the use of things indifferent, for wicked
men are very prone to be scandalized at the lawful conveniences of the Godly:
and there is no doubt, but many are so wicked, as that they would of set
purpose nourish, and cherish such scandals in themselves, if they thought that
the Godly would hereupon forbear such their conveniences: there be some
people of such malevolent spirits against Ministers, as that they are
scandalized at the decent apparel of them, and their wives, at their competent
fare, and moderate housekeeping: and, if they must make the humor, and opinion
of such men the rule of their walking in all things indifferent, it will be a
very difficult matter for them to know how herein to carry themselves. But this
doctrine, that we are to (...) all indifferencies, at which wicked men are
scandalized, if it be unlimited would create perplexities, not only unto
Ministers, but unto all sorts of men, especially such as have any thing due
unto them from others: for grant this, and how often will a Landlord be at a
loss to demand his rent? a Creditor his debts? and the magistrate his tribute
or contribution?

Add unto this, thirdly, that this doctrine, without limitation, will tend
unto the overthrow of public peace, and (...), and brings in nothing but
anarchy and confusion: for public peace and order depends much upon the
preservation of propriety: and upon what a ticklish point would propriety
stand, if we must forbear to exact, or receive all such temporals, at which
wicked men are scandalized, that can be forborne without sin? unto what wrongs,
and injuries would this expose such, as are well affected? for there be some
men so wicked and malicious, as that they would be scandalized at their
temporals for the nonce to deprive them of them. I shall conclude this
particular with the resolution of Aquinas 2. 2 dae. q. 43. art. 8. Propter cos,
qui sic scandala concitant, non sunt temporalia dimittenda: quia hoc and
noceret bono communi: daretur (...) malis (...) occasio, and noceret ipsis
rapientibus, qui retinendo aliena, in peccato remanerent. Unde Greg. dicit in
Moral. Quidam dum temporalia a nobis rapiunt, solummodo sunt tolerandi: quidam
vero aequitate servata prohibendi: non (...) cura, ne nostra subtrahantur, sed
ne (...) non sua, semet ipsos perdant.

But what if this imaginary appearance of evil slow from the supposall of a
weak one, yet an holy one.

Why then it must be omitted, but with this caution, so it may be without sin,
or as the ordinary gloss upon that 15 of Matthew. v. 12, 13, 14. resolves it,
Salva triplici veritate, vitae, Justitiae, Dectrinae, so the threesold verity
of life, justice, and doctrine be preserved safe: Nam per hanc triplicem
veritatem (says Gregory de Valentia), intelligitur omnis rectitudo, and
immunitas a (...) in actionibus humanis. Veritas namque vitae continetur in
actionibus rectis, quas quis in seipso exercet convenienter rectae rationi, and
appetitui recto, atque (...) vere veritate quadam practica: Veritas (...)
justitiae rectis actionibus quae (...) erga (...) similiter, convenienter
rectae rationi, prout vere and absque (...) oportet: veritas denique (...)
continetur (...) vera, and minime (...): By this triple verity is understood
all the rectitude and freedom from sin, that is in humane actions, for the
verity of life is contained in those regular actions, which any one (...) in,
and toward himself agreeably to right reason, and a well governed appetite,
etc. The verity of justice consists in those regular actions, which are
performed toward another, likewise sutably to right reason, as it behooves,
truly and without sin.

And to conclude, the verity of doctrine consists in a true, regular, and
unerring faith: if these three verities be kept inviolate, every thing must be
abstained from, upon which follows scandalum pusillorum, a scandal springing
from either the ignorance, or weakness of our brother: but, because this
resolution may be thought both too general, and obscure (the Schoolmen
themselves sumbling much about its explication,) we will therefore go to work
more distinctly, and particularly.

Consider whether or no the action, in which this appearance of evil is
imagined to be, is necessary, or indifferent.

If it be necessary, and commanded by God, it must not be omitted, though all
the world be offended: For evil must not be done, that good may come thereof.

prevent scandal and sin in our (...), Scandalum quod oritur ex rebus perse

we may not run upon sin our selves: for a well ordered charity, as Aquinas
gives the reason 2. 2dae. q. 43. a. 7. begins ever at home, making a man
chiefly desire and endeavor the salvation of his ownsoule, and consequently
more sollicitous to avoid sin in himself then to prevent it in other: I may
not then omit or neglect necessary duties, because to some they seem but
needless niceties; I must not fly true holiness, and the power of (...),
because unto the world it appears but brain sick peevishness, and an
irrational preciseness: others error should not be seconded, and
countenanced with mine impiety, and disobedience.

Here it will not be an unprofitable, nor much impertinent digression, A
Digression.
to give you the sum of what Thomas and his Interprerers say upon this
Question, An bona spiritualia sint propter scandalum dimittenda?

Not to mention their rotten distinction between matters of counsel, and
matters of precept, we will only out of them take notice, that there is a
difference between (...) of a precept, and a temporary, partial, or
occasional (...) of the matter commanded by a precept.

No precept whatsoever, whether of the Law of Nature, or else but positive, is,
for eschewing the scandal of any whether weak, or malicious, to be (...)
broken or transgressed. And a precept is transgressed whenever what is
enjoined in it is omitted at such a time, and in such a case, when all the
particular circumstances, which we ought to regard, being considered, we are
tied to all performance of it.

But yet however upon emergency of scandal, that which is commanded by some
precepts Opera (...) praecepti (...), quod non pro semper obligat, debent
aliquando deserri pro aliquo tempore, quando causarent pusillis scandalum,
(...) illi (...) (...) instructi, sed circumstantiae illius scandali sint
mutatae, ita ut contingat praeceptum affirmativum etiam iuris quasi naturalis,
aliquando hic and nunc non obligare (...) concursum negativi praecepti de non
ponendo (...) pusillis. (...) Wiggers.
may pro hic and nunc, in some times, and at some places, be omitted, may for a
while be forborne, until the scandal taken thereby can be removed by
information, or instruction, or until the circumstances of the scandals be
some way or other changed. Promulgation of a truth, and Christian reproof, are
duties commanded by God, and yet are to be sometimes abstained from, for
scandals taken by, not only the weak, but all malicious. Reprove not a
scorner lest he hate thee, Prove. 9. 8. Speak not in the ears of a fool, for
he will despise the wisdom of thy words, Prove. 23. 9. (...) not that which is
holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they
trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you, Matthew. 7. 6.

To explain this farther, recourse must be had unto that old and golden rule.
(...) praecepta semper obligant (...) ad semper. Affirmative precepts do
always bind, but not to always: so (...) we are not bound to perform always
what they enjoine, but only loco and tempore debitis, when we have due time and
place. Now as by the intercurrency of other circumstances, so especially by
occurrence of the scandal of weak brethren there may not be opportunity, and
seasonablenesse of doing what we are urged unto by some affirmative precepts;
and so those precepts may pro his and nunc cease to be obligatory: For when the
obligations of two precepts seem to meet together at the very same time, that
which is of greater obligation tieth us, and so consequently we are for the
present freed from the obligation of the other. Now the negative precept of
eschewing the scandal of the weak is more obligatory than many affirmative
precepts; and therefore (to use the words of Malderus,) contingit aliquando
(...) natural affirmativum, hic and nunc non obligare, propter concursum
negativi (...) naturalis de vitando scandalo pusillorum: For example,
vindicative justice binds a magistrate to execute wrath upon him that does
evil: Charity on the other side obliges him to hinder, as much as he can, the
scandal of the weak: now Charity is a virtue, of an higher note and nature,
than vindicative justice: the precept belonging unto charity (hinder as much as
you can the scandal of the weak) does more strictly tie us, than that
pertaining unto vindicative justice, (punish the guilty). And therefore, if it
be probable, that a great and spreading scandal will be taken at the punishing
of delinquents: a Magistrate may not transgress against justice, and yet
defer the execution thereof.

But so manifold and different are the degrees of obligation in affirmative
precepts: such is the variety of circumstances appertaining unto the matters
commanded by those precepts, and constancy of alterations about those
circumstances, as that I do not see, how any unvariable rules, or constant
directions can be given for Christian carriage in this case. For particulars
then, every man is to be left unto the guidance of his spiritual prudence and
wisdom, which is to direct him in a right apprehension, and discretion of
circumstances: to define the opportunity, and seasonablenesse of practicing
what is commanded by affirmative precepts: and to compare them and the precept
of eschewing the scandal of the weak together: and thereupon to determine,
which is hic and nunc, most obligatory, or does most strictly tie us to the
obedience of it, as being of greater moment. Only in the general we may
safely say thus much: that whereas we have said, that for shunning the
scandal of the weak, we may forbear the practice of things commanded by
affirmative precepts, Hic and nunc, in some places, and at some times, it must
always be taken with this proviso, that there be not incurred a greater, and
more perilous scandal, by forbearance, then would probably be occasioned by
practice of the thing (...); which is done, when either first, more are
scandalized by the forbearance, than in all likelihood would be at the
practice: or else, secondly, when the body in general, the Church and Common
wealth, or the greatest, and (...) part of either is scandalized at the
sorbeareance, and only some few particular private persons stumble at the
practice: or else, thirdly, when others take (...) by this partial and
temporary forbearance of what is commanded by affirmative precepts, to contemn
the precepts (...), as being by this our carriage induced to believe that we
verily despise them, and do not so much, for a while forbear, as utterly
disclaim the practice of what they command.

Thus you see, that, according to the common opinion of the schoolmen, things
commanded may in case of scandal for a while be omitted or forborne; but
Vasquez and (...) dissent from them in this particular: the explication and
confirmation of their opinion I will propound, and then breifely pass my
censure thereon. Sum. Theol. (...). 3. (...). 27. q. 5.
Becanus, to make way for his opinion premiseth, that there is a difference
between natural precepts, for some says he bind simply, and always
whatsoever circumstances intervene, and their obligation never cease, such
like are those that forbid lying, perjury, hatred of God, Idolatry etc: for
these facts are so intrinsecally sinful, as that they cannot by any
circumstances be made lawful: others now bind not simply, and absolutely, but
with certain circumstances, and therefore they bind as long as those
circumstances remain, they cease to bind when those circumstances are changed:
Such is the precept forbidding to kill: for that (...) with these
circumstances, that we kill not by our private authority, except in case of
necessary defense. Take away these circumstances, and it binds not, for it is
lawful to kill upon the command of authority, or in our necessary defense:
such also is the precept of eschewing scandal: for, however it be dictated by
the law of nature, yet it obliges not absolute and quomodocunque: but with
certain circumstances: and one circumstance necessarily requisite to make it
bind us is, that there occur not any other precept, either natural, or
positive. The reason is, because every one is bound to have a greater care of
his own, than others salvation, and consequently, rather to avoid sin in
himself, than to prevent it in his brethren. And therefore that precept which
is given us for the prevention of sin in others, is but of a secondary
obligation. Now the precept of eschewing scandal is imposed, only for the
hindering of sin in others, and therefore does not tie us, when there occurreth
any other precept, which is given for the avoiding of sin in our selves. But
it may be objected, that the precept of shunning scandal is of the Law of
nature, and therefore is more obligatory than those precepts that are but
positive. Unto this (...) answers, that a natural precept is more
obligatory, than that which is (...), caeteris paribus, that is, if each
precept, both that which is natural, and that which is positive, be primarily
referred unto the furthering of our own salvation, unto the preventing of sin
in our selves: But now if on the other side the primary scope of the natural
precept be to hinder sin in others, as it is in the precept of scandal; and
the principal end of the positive precept be to shun sin in our selves, then
that precept which is positive does more deeply bind us, than that which is
natural.

Again, secondly, it may be objected: that if the obligation of the natural
precept of eschewing scandal cease upon occurrence of but a positive
precept; why, then it seems, this positive precept detracts or derogates from
the natural precept of avoiding scandal: as being of greater force, and
validity? In no wise, only it takes away a circumstance requisite to make the
precept of avoiding scandal obligatory, quare cum dicimus (says Vasquez) non
esse omittendum praeceptum positivum (...) vitandum scandalum proximi, non
dicimus praeceptum natural derogari (...) positivo tanquam fortiori; sed
dicimus occursu praecepti positivi (...) quandam circumstantiam necessariam, ut
(...) praeceptum de vitando scandalo etiamsi natural sit.

But all this labor would have been saved, if the question had been rightly
stated: for, whereas it is said, that one circumstance necessarily requisite to
make the precept of eschewing scandal bind us, is, that there occur not any
other precept either natural or positive: this is to be understood cum grano
salis, with this limitation, in case such precepts bind (all circumstances
considered to the performance of what they enjoyne) (...) and nunc, at such a
particular time and place; for then omission of what they enjoine would be
sinful, and we are not sinfully to omit any thing, for prevention of scandal
in our brother: Unto the proof of which the reason of Vasquez and (...) may be
applied.

But, the obligation of affirmative precepts is not universal ad (...), but
only loco and tempore debitis: and therefore what they enjoyne may sometimes,
in the case of scandal, be prudently omitted; but perhaps this which I say is
all that Vasquez and (...) aim at; and then they have no adversary that I know
of; Every one will grant unto them, that one circumstance necessarily requisite
to make the precept of (...) scandal bind us, hic and nunc, in such a time and
place, is, that there occur not any other precept binding us to what it
enjoyneth at that very instant time, and place: for it is evident unto all,
that upon occurrencie of such obligations, though scandal ensue, it would not
be on our parts a culpable scandal, an active scandal. But it may be thought
that I have stayed too long upon this digression: to return therefore where we
left.

Secondly, if the action in which this appearance of evil is supposed to be,
be but indifferent: why then, the best direction that we can have will be from
what the Apostle Paul writes unto the Romans chap. 14. and unto the (...), 1
Cor. 8. and chap. 10. of converts amongst the Romans there were some strong,
and knowing ones, that were well principled, and so knew very well their
deliverance from the yoke of the mosaicall Law: and hereupon, without any
scruple, did eat such meats as were prohibited thereby, perhaps Swines flesh,
or the like: Now at this their practice, several weak Christians, who were as
yet ignorant and uninstructed touching the latitude of their Christian liberty,
were in several regards scandalized, as I have shown in a foregoing treatise:
But yet here the practice of the strong was a thing indifferent in it self
verse. 14. 20. and the appearance of evil (to wit, a profane, and irreligious
contempt of the Law of Moses) was only imaginary, arising from the ignorance,
and error of the weak, who thought that Law of Moses to be still in sorce, and
unabrogated; and the scandal consequent hereupon was only (...) accidens,
flowing not from the nature of the action in it self, but from the
misapprehension of the weak: and yet the Apostle blames the strong for
scandalizing the weak: and therefore in this their action, though indifferent
in it self, there was an active scandal, a scandal culpably given, as well
as taken. The Apostle gives the same resolution unto the Corinthians concerning
things offered unto Idols; to eat them at the Pagan religious feast, and in the
temple of an Idol, carries a real appearance of communion with, and
approbation of an Idolatrous worship of the Idol, and so is scandalous per se,
of it self, and in its own nature, 1 (...). 8. 10. cap. 10. verse. 20, 21. But
now to eat these same meats when sold, and bought in the shambles, or set
before them in private meetings, the Apostle resolves to be a thing lawful,
and indifferent, 1 Cor. 10. v. 25, 26, 27. And indeed it could not carry a
real, but only an imaginary appearance of evil; for they were the good
creatures of God, and so incapable of any (...) pollution, and they had no
religious use, and so did not reflect any glance (...) the least honor, credit
or countenance to the Idol. The scandal then, accrewing by them, was only per
accidens; and yet they were by the Apostles advise to be forborne, if such
scandal were likely to ensue upon the use of them. But if any man say unto
thee, this is offered in sacrifice unto Idols, eat not for his sake that showed
it, and for conscience (...), 1 Cor. 10. 28. Here we have a general rule,
together with three limitations thereof.

First, a general rule: if any man imagine evil, and sin to be in an
indifferent action, and (...) be scandalized, that action is to be abstained
from; if any man say unto thee, this is offered in sacrifice unto Idols, (...)
not, for his sak that showed it.

But now here are couched three exceptions.

First, we are not bound to abstain from things indifferent, unless the
scandal consequent be probable; if any man say unto you, this is offered in
sacrifice unto Idols etc. if he say nothing, but (...), there his opinion, and
dislike in his own breast, we may be guiltless and blameless. And indeed, if
we are to forbear all indifferent things, in which there is only a mere
possibility of scandal, we should be at an utter loss, and uncertainty in our
actings in things indifferent, and never know what to do, we are obliged then
to abstain from things indifferent, only in the case of (...) (...) (...) (...)
circumstantiis ctus inordinatus unius non (...) (...) ut (...) (...) (...)
(...) (...) occasio (...), non (...) peccatum scandali, nec (...) (...) non
(...), ut (...) (...) Bannes hic art 4. in fine. Nam (...) nonpotest quis
censeri (...) (...) ruinae alterius. Gregor. de (...) tem. 3. q. 18. punct. 2.
scandal probable, and not in the case of scandal (...) possible, and so much
is observed by Calvin upon the 1 (...): 8. 13. Deinde (...) jubet nos Paulus
divinare (...) offendiculo futurum sit quod facimus, nisi cum est praesens
periculum.

A second exception is; that we are not required to abstain from things
indifferent, in which our weak brethren imagine that there is evil and sin,
and thereupon are scandalized, unless they have some probable ground for their
imagination: for though the eating of the Idolothytes at a private feast was
not an action in it self scandalous, or nductive unto sin; as being free from
both sin, and all real appearance of it, yet the Corinthians scandalized
hereat had a probable ground why they conceived it to be unlawful and sinful,
the late moral or religious (...) n that the Idolothytes had unto an Idol:
this is off red in sacrifice unto Idols; Mr Rutherford [in his treatise of
scandal page 53, 54.] expresses this limitation as follows; we read not of
scandals culpable in Gods word, but there be some moral reasons in them; and
(...) applies it unto the offense, that is taken, at tolling of bells, at a
ministers gown, when he preaches: there is no apparent moral reason why the
tolling of a Bell, or a ministers gown should scandalize; for they are of
mere civil use, and have no moral influence in the worship; for the same
tolling of bells is, and may be used to convocate the people to a Baron Court
to hear a declamation, to convocate soldiers. This exception, that I have
laid down, is, I conceive, grounded, as upon what the Apostle says; so also
upon the reality, and truth of our Christian liberty in things indifferent,
which otherwise would signify nothing; for if we are to abstain from all
indifferent things, in which another without probable ground imagines that
there is sin; the servitude of Christians under the Gospel would be far
greater, and more intolerable, then that of the (...) under the mosaicall
administration.

A third exception; which we may gather hence, is, in great part, coincident
with the first, and it is; that the abstinence unto which we are obliged, in
things indifferent, in the case of scandal, is not universal, and total, but
limited ad hic and nunc, those times, and places in which there is danger, or
likelihood of scandal: the Corinthians were, in their private feasts, to
forbear eating Idolothytes, only in the presence of persons apt to be
scandalized, and might elsewhere use (...) liberty without regret of Conscience.

Unto these exceptions insinuated here by the Apostle we may add diverse
others; of which, some may be collected from what we above said touching the
scandal of the wicked in things indifferent mutatis mutandis, and by and by I
shall add others; but first I shall examine some restrictions, which I gave in
a former edition of this book.

Former Edition.
But now, if the action in which this appcarance of evil is supposed to be, be
but indifferent, then these two following things must be (...). First, whether,
or no it be annexed with a necessary duty, or not? Secondly, whether or no it
be undertermined, left to our own liberty and choice, or else by authority
either Oeconomicall, Political, or Ecclesiastical?

If it be annexed to a necessary duty, we must not omit this, to abstain from
that: So to fly the shadow of sin, we should (...) the body of sin, a sin
really so, a sin of omission; for what is not good, if to omit a duty be not
bad? Good must not be left undone, though evil per accidens come from it, much
(...), when only an appearance of evil is joined to it. We must not then shun
the Lords table, because some weaker judgments have imagined in the act of
kneeling, a show of Idolatry. So to avoid but an imaginary appearance of evil
unto men, we shall (...) indeed unto God to be evil. A Minister must not
neglect the discharge of his duty, because some have supposed a show of
superstition in some harmless ceremonies annexed to its performance. So, to
avoid men's unjust censures, he should incur a just woe and curse from God:
woe be to me (says the Apostle) if I preach not the Gospel.

Answer.
This first limitation I borrowed from Dr (...) upon the text: for the
examination of it we must distinguish of humane Ceremonies; they are of two
sorts, Circumstantiall, or Doctrinall.

First, circumstantiall, such are the Circumstances of time or place, matters
of order, decency, and the like. Now these are necessary in the general, and
the particulars may be determined by the Magistrate, or Church Officers v. g.
that the public assemblies be at such a convenient time of the day, in such a
place, and that they be convocated by tolling of bells; that the Minister
officiate in a grave habit, gown, cloak, or coat, etc. Now though some of
these may be by some causelessly imagined to be evil; yet they are not
therefore to be forborne, if they be by lawful command of the Magistrate, or
Church, to be annexed with necessary duties; for necessary duties are not to be
omitted for mere circumstances connexed with their performance.

Thus we are not to forsake, or refrain our public assemblies, because some
think there is some superstition in the places of them, our Churches, and the
Convocation of them by bells, upon this ground, that both our Churches and
bells have been abused by Papists. Dr Heylin [in a former edition of his
Geography] relates this following story of Peter Du Moulin; that hearing how
diverse English Ministers scrupled to officiate in a Surplice, he said, that he
would willingly preach at Paris in a fools coat, if leave could not be gotten
of the King, upon any other condition. If this great light of France ever
dropped such words, he had in them doubtless a very good, devout, and zealous
meaning; but yet (under correction) I cannot see how his resolution can be
accorded with that rule of the Apostle; Let all things be done decently; for it
cannot as yet sink into my foolish head, how that a fools coat is a decent
garment to preach in. But this on the bie.

To proceed unto a second sort of Ceremonies, which we may call, for
distinction sake, humane, Doctrinall, (...); such as men institute, by their
moral signification, to teach, v. g. the Cross, Surplice etc: if these might
lawfully, by any humane authority whatsoever, be unavoidably annexed with
necessary duties, we should then soon resolve, that we are not then to abstain
from them; but the non-conformists ever held that no mortal wight whatsoever
could lawfully urge, or press the unavoidable connection of such Ceremonies
with necessary duties; and indeed they have very good reason against the
Command of such a connection; because it would have been against religion, and
against charity.

First, against religion: they never granted them (as is still supposed) to be
indifferent, but always arraigned them as guilty of superstition, and
will worship; and so, manifest (...) against the second commandment,
presumptuous additions unto the word, and ordinances of our Lord Jesus Christ,
a setting of man's threshold by Gods threshold, and their posts by Gods posts,
Ezekiel. 43. 8. and the justice of their accusation will be soon confessed by all
learned, and unprejudiced men, that will with patience, and impartiality read
the reenforcement of their arguments by Parker, Didoclave, and Ames against all
answers and replies whatsoever. The Prelates connexing of humane symbolicall
ceremonies with duties and ordinances that are necessary, and commanded by the
word of God, brings into my mind an artifice of Julian the Apostate: in the
market places of Cities, he set up his own image, with the Essigies of the gods
of the Heathen pictured round about, to the end, that whosoever should do
civil reverence to the Emperors Image, might also seem to worship the gods of
the Gentiles: and by the contrary, they who would not bow to the Gods of the
Gentiles, might seem also to refuse all due (...) to the Emperor. Thus the
Prelates, of their own heads, most presumptuously have set up in Gods worship,
and service, their own inventions, and have commanded them to be joined with
the ordinances of Christ: so that hereby they drove many conscientious
Ministers into a great strait, if, out of a lothnesse to loose the exercise of
their Ministry, they conformed unto their Ceremonies, this they interpreted to
be an approbation os them; and, if to avoid their Ceremonies, they did forbear
to baptize, to administer the Lords supper etc. then they accused them for
neglect, and contempt of Gods Ordinances.

Secondly, it was against charity for the Prelates, so rigidly, and
peremptorily to press their paultry Ceremonies, as that unless men observed
them they would not suffer them, by their good wills, to enjoy the precious
Ordinances of Christ Jesus; and this can reasonably be denied by none, who
think, that the souls of men may be damnified by the want of such ordinances:
But to proceed unto a second restriction in the former edition.

Former Edition.
If we are not, secondly, nostri juris, but restrained; and determined by
authority, we must (...) disobey that to (...) Brother; transgress duty, to
express charity: So to please men, we should displease God. So we should do
evil, that good might come thereof. When the Obligation of two precepts (...)
lies upon us at the same time, and impossible for both to be at once obeyed,
in such a case, because there is no clashing between Gods (...), neither does
God by them impose upon his creatures any necessity of sinning, therefore one
of (...) precepts must give place unto the other; to wit, that which (...) a
less duty, unto that which prescribes a more weighty and pressing one. Now the
(...) of Justice (as a learned Inconformitant, even Amesius himself, med:
(...). lib. 2. cap. 16.. 62, 63, will tell us) are of stricter obligation (...)
those of charity. We are more bound to pay our debts then to distribute Alms.
He that has trespassed against another, is more strictly (...) to sue for
reconciliation, then the party who has received the injury. Now to hinder the
scandal of the weak, is a duty of Charity; to obey the lawful commands of
authority, a duty of justice; and therefore of the greater obligation and
(...), unto it then the other must give place. I would have traveled farther
in this argument, but that I am anticipated by the learned, and (...)
Professors of (...) in their Duplies to the second answers of the Covenanting
ministers, who from page 65. unto 75. have (...) discussed this very question,
whether the precept of obedience to Superiors, or the precept of eschewing
scandal be more obligatory, and have there proved by many unanswerable
arguments, that the former precept, that of obedience to Superiors is of the
twain more Obligatory. Those then that desire larger satisfaction concerning
this matter, I shall (...) unto the perusal of them. How ever in the mean
while (...) it not be thought troublesome, if I insert, what I judge in them,
if not most, yet very remarkable. It Is this, Debitum obedientiae, the debt of
obedience, which we owe unto superiors, is (say they pa: 74) not only debitum
morale, a debt or duty unto which we are tied by moral honesty, and Gods
Commandment: but also debitum legale, or debitum justitiae, (quod viz: fundatur
in proprio jure alterius) a a debt grounded upon the true and proper right
which our Superiors have to exact this duty of us, so that they may accuse us
of injury, and censure us, if we perform it not. There is a great difference
betwixt these two sorts of debts, and the last is far more obligatory than the
first; as for example: A man owes (...) to the poor by a moral debt, but to
his Creditour he owes them by legal debt, or debt of justice: and therefore
he is more strictly obliged to pay his creditor, than to give alms. So by
moral honesty, and Gods precepts also, a man owes to his neighbor a pious
car fullness to hinder sin in him, by admonition, instruction, good example,
and by omission, even of things lawful, when he foreseeth that his neighbor,
in respect of his weakness will be scandalized by them. But his neighbor has
not such a right to exact these things of him, neither can he have action
against him for not performing of them, as our lawful superiors have, for our
due obedience. Thus they.

Hence then may we shape an answer unto that same frequent clamor of some
tumultuous spirits, that our (...) for sooth, is wondrous offensive to many of
our weak brethren.

First, suppose it be so, better they without thy fault be offended,
scandalized at thee, than that the Magistrate be with thy fault disobeyed by
thee. It is no safe course to provide for the peace of thy brothers conscience,
by wounding thine own with the sin of disobedience against authority, to
which for conscience sake thou (...) to yield subjection: we must not, to
comply with men's humors, resist the ordinance of God, despise the voice of the
Church, rather than a weak brother should be offended, scandalized: we may,
and sometimes must part with our own right; but we ought not to rob the (...)
of hers, by (...) her of her power, by denying her our obedience. Nay farther,
I confess that rather than a weak brother should be scandalized, we may pro
hic and nunc in some particular times and places, pretermit what superiors
prescribe, provided they take no distaste thereat, and others by our example be
not encouraged to contemn their persons, callings, commands: for so a greater
and more pernicious scandal will be incurred, than was declined. But we are
not upon occurrence of any scandal whatsoever, taken by whomsoever, either
absolutely to deny, and utterly refuse obedience to the lawful injunctions of
our public governors, whether temporal, or ecclesiastical: or so much as
contemptuously and scandalously for a while omit the practice of what they
enjoine. And omission of what they require, is than contemptuous, when they
(...) urge the practice of it, then scandalous when it heartens others to a
contempt of their authority. To grant any of these lawful, what were it,
alas! but to license confusion both in Church and (...)?

Secondly, I demand whether or no the offense given to, or taken by a
Magistrate, who is a brother, and withal a magistrate, be not greater than
that which is given to, or taken by one, who is only a brother? An impartial
Judge will soon determine, that the double relation of brother and magistrate,
weighs down the single and naked relation of a brother. Howsoever I am sure,
that the whole exceeds the parts severally considered: the relation of mother
exacts more at our hands than that of brother, and therefore, in warding a blow
from my brother, I am to take care, that thereby the same stroke light not
upon the head of my mother the Church. Whereupon, as Paul exhorts to give none
offense, neither to Jew, nor Gentile, so he Bishop (...).
adds in a further specialty nor to the Church of God, 1 Cor. 10. 37. The Jews
and Gentiles were but parts, the Church of God the whole, they but brethren,
she the mother. Si (...) sit vel pusillum quempiam sca^dalizare, and
praestiterit alligata collo mola (...) demergi quempiam in profundum, Taris

If then it were better to be thrown into the bottom of the sea, with a
millstone about ones neck than to offend a little one, a poor and illiterate
artizan, what expression shall we then find answerable to the heinousness of a
scandal given to a pious Magistrate, to a religious Prince, to a Parliament,
and Convocation, to a whole Church and Commonwealth?

Examination.
First, it cannot be denied, but that diverse indifferent things may be hic and
nunc of such weight, and moment, of such necessity, or at least expediency, and
convenience, as that the just commands of our lawful superiors may render
them our duty, and omission of them would be sinful: of subjection unto such
commands the Apostle speaks, Romans 13. 5. Wherefore ye must needs be subject,
not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. Where by wrath is understood
Metonymically punishment: we are therefore to obey the Commands of the
Magistrate, not only for fear of punishment, but also for fear of sin: lest
we wound the Conscience with transgression of the fifth Commandment. To assert
the contrary, (that it is not a sinful disobedience to violate the Commands of
Superiors concerning some things indifferent in their general nature,) tends
apertly to the dissolving of all government, and stocks up the authority of
Magistrates, and masters of families by the very roots.

Secondly, it is as unquestionable, that all omissions of what is commanded by
humane laws are not sins, unless they be out of contempt of authority: for

First; otherwise (as Aliae leges humanae, quia possunt esse vel justae vel
injustae, idque ratione efficientis, materiae, formae, finis, and hujus aut
illius subjecti, vel adjuncti; idcirco non ita simpli citer alligant, ut earum
quaelibet violatio culpam lethalem inducat. Si enim sic esset, tum quot sunt
leges, tot essent laquei anima. rum, and qui sub legibus vivunt, pluribus multo
peccatis essent obnoxii, quam qui in barbaris gentibus, vel absque legibus, vel
cum paucissimis transigunt vitam. Ames. de Consc. cas. lib. 5. cap. 24. Number. 22.
Ames rightly says) as many laws as there were, so many snares for souls
there were, and they that live under laws, should be subject to many more
sins, then they who live among barbarous people, either quite without laws, or
with but a few.

Secondly, there be diverse laws, that be Multae leges sunt pure (...), ita ut
ipsis plane satis fiat, si (...) solvatur. Rat. 1. Quia legis (...) est
deterrere homines a communi and frequenti usu hujus aut illius rei, ad quem
finem sufficit constitutio poenae. 2. In talibus etiam legibus est tacita
conventio and pactum, de poena ferenda si contra fiat: Contra leges autem
conventionales, aut sub condition latas, venire quis potest absque peccato. 3.
De talibus legibus, intelligentes homines nunquam faciunt scrupulum
conscientiae, si absit contemptus, scandalum, and notabile damhum. Tales sunt
leges de non (...), de non piscando, de volucribus aut feris non capiendis, de
non utendo hoc aut illo genere vestium, ciborum etc. number. 28.
purely penal, and the intent of such laws is satisfied, when one patiently
submits unto the punishment inflicted for the breach of them; such are several
laws of our Land putting restraints upon some men in fouling, fishing,
hunting, and the like: as also that statute, which prohibited the eating of
flesh, at such times upon politic respects, for the breed, and increase of
cattle, as also for the encouragement of fishing, Now no man can reasonably
hold, that every breach of such laws is a sin, especially when it is not
contemptuous, and scandalous: I put in that limitation, because contempt of
authority, and scandal unto others will make a very small, and otherwise
inconsiderable violation of a mere penal law, to be a very heinous sin.

Thirdly, the omission of what is commanded by humane laws is in many cases
Obligatio legis non potest extendi ultra intentionem, and mentem (...), eamque
justam. Praesumend umautem est nullum hominem velle su. os subditos ad (...)
teatum and damnationem obligate, propter quemlibet suae voluntatis neglectum.
Into si in aliquo casu magnum damnum, scandalum, aut (...) modum ex
observatione quarundam legum sequuturum esset, praesumitur non inte^disse
legislatorem, ut in illo casu observaretur.
agreeable unto the presumptive will of a just magistrate. It is to be
presumed, that if he knew the cases, he would tolerate the omission, and
therefore such a bare omission would not be a sin: Of this Ames speaks very
well: the obligation, says he, of a Law, must not be stretched beyond the just
intention, and mind of the lawgiver, but it is to be presumed, that no man
would oblige his Subjects to a mortal guilt, and utter damnation, for every
neglect of his will and pleasure. Nay if in some case, the Law cannot possibly
be observed, but some great damage, scandal, or inconvenience, must needs
follow, it is to be presumed, that the Lawgiver never intended that the Law in
such a case should be observed. We would reckon him a very cruel Magistrate
that should be implacably angry at a sick man for eating flesh in a time of
Lent, and can we think then, that there was any such thing as Christian pity
and commiseration in the breasts of those men whom nothing could atone for the
omission of the Cross, Surplice, etc? while they scandalized, that is
destroyed, the immortal souls of many for whom Christ dyed. Suppose the
greatest Monarch upon the face of the earth should command the meanest, and
lowest of his slaves upon some important affair to ride post through such a
City, without any of the least stay or diversion, and then it should happen,
that a company of little children should be playing in the streets; can this
slave think, that he is obliged to ride over them? Nay, unless we imagine his
Master to be a most bloody Tyrant, we must needs think, that he will be highly
displeased at so horrid a cruelty; and can any man then make any tolerable
apology for the tyranny Ames. de Con. lib. 5. cap. 24. (...). 22.
of our late Prelates, who commanded all to drive on with a furious career in
the course of conformity, without any the least stop, though hereby were
hazarded a world of souls, purchased at no lower a rate than the divine blood
of our blessed Savior?

It is the will and pleasure of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that
matters commanded by his affirmative precepts should be, for a while, forborne,
in case of the likelihood of scandal consequent; but these men (in imitation
of him that exalted himself above all that is called God 2 These. 2. 4.) could
not be persuaded to dispense with a temporary forbearance of any ceremonies
they enjoined: though they well foresaw, that the sequel of them was likely to
be a very great, and spreading scandal.

But now the non-conformists might spare all this discourse touching the
obligation of humane laws in general: because they hold that humane,
religious, Doctrinall Ceremonies the matter in question, cannot be lawfully
determined by the authority of either Political, or Ecclesiastical
superiors: and for this they have two, as I take it, very convincing arguments.

First, because all such Ceremonies are Saucy additions unto the word, and
ordinances of God, Deuteronomy. 4. 2. and cap. 12. 32. strange fire which the Lord
commanded not, Lev. 10. 8.

Secondly, because suppose they be indifferent (which was a thing never
granted) yet they are unnecessary toys, and trifles: and therefore it is not
lawful for our superiors to command them, when, from the practice of them, it
is very probable, that scandal will arise. For

First, every power is the Minister of God to thee for good, Romans 13. 4 the
power of the Magistrate is like that of the Minister, only for edification, and
not destruction, 2 Cor. 10. 8. and cap. 13. 10. but now if he should have power
to command humane symbolicall Ceremonies (that may be well spared in Gods
worship and service) whenthere is likelihood of the consecution of Scandal:
then he should have power to do mischief, to enjoine things hurtful, and
destructive unto the souls of men.

Secondly, our Saviors commination against scandal, Matthew. 18. 7. ( Woe to
that man by whom the offense comes,) reaches Magistrates, as well as private
persons: and we may say the same of the Apostolical prohibitions of scandal
both to the Romans, and the Corinthians, Romans 14. 13, 15, 20, 21. 1 Cor. 8. 9.
and chap. 10. 32.

Unto these prohibitions add we Paul's resolution to avoid scandal arising
from the use of things indifferent: if meat make my brother to offend ( says
he) I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to
offend, 1 Cor. 8. 13. For

From this resolution the unlawfulness of the injunction of such ceremonies as
ours will undeniably follow.

To clear this I shall presuppose that, which cannot (with any color of
reason) be denied: to wit, that, that, which Paul held unlawful for himself
to practice in his own person upon a general account belonging to all
Christians, could not by him be lawfully imposed upon others by an
Ecclesiastical Canon; but now Paul held it unlawful to eat flesh in case of
scandal probably consequent, and this was upon a general reason belonging to
all Christians: and therefore he thought it utterly unlawsull to impose any
such matter upon others when scandal was likely to follow.

From this thus premised, I shall hence thus argue Syllogistically, against our
Prelates imposition of our Ceremonies.

If it were unlawful for Paul to impose upon the Corinthians such ceremonies
as ours, then it was unlawful for our Prelates to impose such upon us.

But it was unlawful for Paul to impose such Ceremonies as ours upon the
Corinthians.

Therefore it was unlawful for the Prelates to impose such Ceremonies upon us.

The sequel of the major is evident: because the Prelates could not pretend
unto so much authority in matters Ecclesiastical as Paul had: for in each of
the Apostles there was a greater (...) of jurisdiction then in any that
succeeded them.

As for the Minor that may be confirmed by this following Syllogism.

If it were unlawful for Paul to impose upon the Corinthians the eating of
flesh when scandal was likely to ensue, then it was unlawful for him to
impose upon them the use of such Ceremonies as ours.

But the former appears to be unlawful by the 1 Cor. 8. 13.

Therefore the latter was unlawful also.

There is nothing here can be questioned but the Major, and that is easily
confirmed from a just comparison of flesh with such Ceremonies as ours.

First, the eating of flesh was undoubtedly a thing more clearly indifferent,
then the practice of such Ceremonies of ours.

Secondly, flesh was necessary unto the maintenance of the life of man by
disjunction: that is, flesh, or some other meat: but now such Ceremonies as
ours are not necessary unto the worship and service of God by disjunction: for
God may be worshipped without them, or any others in their stead: a surplice
(says Rutherford) is not necessary by way of disjunction, for neither is
surplice necessary, nor any other white or red habit, that has some mystical
signification, like unto Surplice: So kneeling to the elements is neither
necessary, nor any the like religious honoring of them by prostration before
them, or kissing them.

But against this accusation of our Ceremonies for scandal there are objected
two Comparisons.

First, of the duties of justice and Charity together: the duties of justice
are more obligatory then the duties of charity, as being not only a moral, but
a legal debt: Now to hinder the scandal of the weak is a duty of charity,
only a moral debt, to obey the lawful command of authority in things
indifferent a duty of justice, a legal debt; and therefore of the greater
obligation, and moment: I shall the rather insist on this argument, because it
is of late so much stood on by Dr Sanderson [in his last Sermons printed 1656.
page 249.] where we are not (says he) able to discharge both: debts of justice
are to be paid (says he) before bebts of charity. Now the duty of obedience is
debitum justitiae, and a matter of right: my superior may challenge it at my
hands as his due; and I do him wrong, if I withhold it from him. But the care
of not giving offense is but debitum charitatis, and a matter of but courtesy.
I am to perform it to my brother in love, when I see cause: but he cannot
challenge it from me as his right, nor can justly say I do him wrong, if I
neglect it. It is therefore no more lawful for me to disobey the lawful
command of a superior, to prevent thereby the offense of one or a few
brethren, then it is lawful for me to do one man wrong, to do another man a
courtesy withal, or then it is lawful for me to rob the Exchequer to relieve
an Hospital. Quis est, qui dicat, ut habeamus quod demus pauperibus, faciamus
furta divitibus? August. (...).


For answer: First, if this argument be applied unto our Ceremonies there will
be in such application a mere begging of the question; for that our Ceremonies
were things indifferent, the command of them lawful, the practice of them a
duty of justice, a legal debt, is the maine thing in controversy betwixt the
conformists, Mendac. cap. 7.
and non-conformists; and therefore all this should be proved, and not barely
presupposed as it is. But

Secondly, the fore mentioned rule is to be understood with this limitation,
caeteris paribus, if the terms of the comparison be equal: and equal they
are not, when the minims of justice are put into the balance with the
weightiest duties of charity: and so it is in the present comparison, though we
suppose our Ceremonies to be indifferent, and the practice of them a duty of
justice: for of what importance is such practice in comparison of the not
scandalizing of our Brother? Who, that is not extremely transported with
prejudice, will think, that the commands of the Prelates to wear the surplice,
to sign children with the sign of the Cross in Baptism etc. carry any
tolerable proportion with those precepts of the Apostle, destroy not him with
thy meat, thy indifferencies, for whom Christ died; for such things destroy not
the work of God? Romans 14. 15, 20. What laws, of any earthly wight whatsoever,
concerning ceremonies, can be more obligatory, than the Commands of God
touching the externalls of his worship and service? and yet it is his will, and
pleasure, that these externals of his worship should be laid aside for the
performance of outward works of mercy? I will have mercy and not sacrifice,
Matthew. 12. 7. Thus are we to leave our prayers, both public, and private, to
forsake a Sermon, for to save the life (...) our neighbors, to quench the
firing of his house, to help his cattle out of the ditch: now, if the sacred
Ordinances of God are to give way unto works of mercy unto the bodies of men,
surely then much more is the trash of humane inventions to yield unto a work
of mercy toward the souls of men: This answer which I now give was made by
(...) in his dispute of scandal unto the Duplies of the Doctors of Aberdeen
pa. 50, 51, 52, 53. his discourse there is so satisfactory, as that I have
thought fit to transcribe what he says; and I hope the reading of it will not
be irksome unto the Reader.

It is true these duties which we owe to others by way of justice, are more
obligatory then those, which we owe only by way of charity, caeteris paribus:
(...) duties of the Law of nature, and moral Law, are compared together, then
indeed the duties, which we owe both by the tie of justice and charity, are
more obligatory then the duties that (...) owe only by the tie of charity. As
for example, My Father is in danger before mine eyes to be drowned, in one
(...) water, and before my (...) also my neighbor or friend is in danger of
the like kind: the two (...) and bands of justice and charity, both by the
fifth and sixth Commandments, are more obligatory, hic and nunc, and do more
strictly oblige, that I run to succor and preserve the life of my Father, than
the life of my neighbor: for the obligation to my neighbor, is only Charity,
by the obligation of the sixth Commandment, which obligation cease, hic and
nunc, at this time, when my fathers life is in hazard: and thus far the
Doctors argument goes for strong, as Schoolmen, Casuists, and Divines teach.
But it is not to a purpose for the Doctors: for all offices and duties
generally, and universally, of what ever kind, which we owe by way of Justice,
are not more obligatory, than duties which we owe only by way of charity: as
when duties of a positive commandment of God, (...) by our superiors, and
duties which we owe by charity only, are compared together, then the Doctors
Major proposition is not clear of it self, as they dream, neither do
Casuists, or Amesius, or Divines say with them; but truth, and all our Divines
say against them. Let us suppose that the King, and Convocation, and Assembly
of Priests and Prophets of Israel make a Canon according to Gods word. That no
manner of man presume to eat shewbread, save the Priests only. All men owe
obedience to this, both because it is Gods express Law, and by the band of
Justice the (...) and assembly of the Ancients have forbidden it. But if our
Doctors argument st and strong, David at the point and hazard of famishing for
hunger, sinned in eating shewbread, yet Christ acquitteth him of all sin,
and says Matthew. 12. 5. he and his followers are (...), blameless. Now David
was under a duty by mercy, and love to his own life, and the lives of his
followers, to eat show bread, and he was under the band of Justice, by the Law
of the Ancients of Israel, and Gods law, not to eat. Therefore in some cases
when our superiors commandments are only positive Laws, they are not more
obligatory, than duties of Charity, only commanded in the Law of nature. I
clear it further thus, I see my neighbor in danger before my eyes of
drowning, and my father commands me to go and labor, or sow his farm in
that time, while I am to preserve the life of my neighbor, in present danger,
to loose his life in a great water. By the Doctors maxim, I am under the
higher obligatory tie of Justice, to obey my father, who commands a thing
both lawful and necessary, by virtue of the higher commandment, to wit the
first of the second Table, than I am obliged by the sixth Commandment, and of
charity only, to give present succor and help to my dying neighbor, so I
must let my neighbor dye in the waters, to give a duty of Justice to my father
of far less necessity. I would not commit my Conscience to such Casuists, as
are the Doctors of Aberdeen. But if the Doctors would see with some new light
of reason; it is clear that not only, the tie of justice makes the precept
more obligatory, but also the (...) of the thing commanded; yea, and if the
positive Commandments of the Lord our God, who of Justice, and Kingly
sovereignty has right to ask obedience of us above all earthly Superiors, do
yield and cede as less obligatory, then commandments of love only, that are
commanded in the Law of nature. What do our Doctors clatter and fable to us of
a right of Justice, that mortal Rulers have to command in things indifferent,
from which the destruction of souls does arise? for these commandments of
Rulers, (Kneel religiously before bread, the (...) image of Christ crucified)
(keep humane holy days) (Cross the air with your thumb above a baptized
infants face) at best, are but positive Commandments, not warranted by Gods
word. But shall they be more obligatory by a supposed band of Justice that
Prelates have over us to command such toys, than this divine Law of God, and
Nature, Romans 14. For indifferent days, meats, surpsice, (...) not him for
whom Christ dyed? All the Casuists and Schoolmen, Navarra, Sylvester, Sanchez,
Raphael dela Torre, Meratius, Duvallius, Thomas, Scotus, Bonaventura, Suarez,
Uasquez, Greg: de valentia, Albertus, Richardus, Biel, Corduba, Angelus,
Adrianus, Alphonsus, Becanus, Yea, and all the host of our Divines cry with
Scripture, that mercy and the precepts of love, and of the Law of nature are
more obligatory, than sacrifice, burnt offerings, and Gods own positive Laws,
yea, and that positive Laws loose their obligatory power, and cease to be
laws, when the laws of nature and necessary duties of mercy, and love (as not
to murder our brother) (not to scandalize) stands in their way. I might
weary the Reader here with citations, and be wilder my self also, but it is a
point of Divinity denied by none at all. 3. What we owe of Justice to our
Superiors, is indeed both a moral debt of obedience, and a debt of Justice
and law, which Rulers may seek by their place, and exjure, as Aristotle says,
but this right is limited: Rulers have no right to seek absolute obedience,
but only in the Lord, not against charity. And though the place of Rulers be
authoritative, yet their commanding power, as touching the matter of what they
injoyne is only (...), and they cannot but in Gods place exact, that which is
Gods due, and seeing God himself, if he should immediately in his own person
Command, he would not urge a positive commandment, sarre less the
commandment of light and vain Ceremonies, against and beyond the precept of
love, not to destroy a soul for whom Christ dyed. Ergo, Superiors under God,
who borrow all their light from God, cannot have a higher right, than God has.
4. The comparison of a man who owes (...) to a Creditor, and owes moneys to
the poor, is close off the way, sor he is obliged to pay the Creditour first;
but the case (...) is far otherwise; the debt of practicing indifferent
seathers, and straws, such as (...), crossing, wearing Surplice, is neither
like the dept owen to the poor, nor to the Creditor; For natures Law, and Gods
word, 1. Cor. 10. 18. 19. makes the Non-practise, non-murthering obedience to
God, when the practice of indifferent things is a soul stumbling to the weak,
and the practicing is but at 'its best obedience to a positive Law, and ought
to stoop, and go off the way, and disappeare, when natures Law (murder not)
does come in 'its way. When the Doctors put Loyalty above Charity, they suppose
obedience to Commandments commanding scandalizing of souls to be loyalty to
Superiors; which is questioned, it being treason to the sovereign of Heaven,
and Earth, to destroy his Image, it is taken as loyalty by our Doctors, but
not proven to be loyalty, and so a vain question here, whether Loyalty be
above Charity or not.

This dispute of scandal is annexed unto his divine right of Church Government,
which was published 1646. since that Dr. Sanderson 1656 (as I showed you but
now) propounds the argument a new, with a great deal of triumph, but without
any considerable reinforcement; and withal he takes no notice of Rutherford,
his answer, from whence I gather that he never read it: and indeed it is a
thing very incident unto the greatest Scholars of that party to censure, but
never to read their adversaries.

Thirdly, to say something unto Dr. Sanderson as well as unto the Duplyers, I
must needs confess, that I am transported with a just admiration, that so
great a scholar should so extenuate, as he does, the guilt of an active
scandal; for he makes the care of not giving offense to a brother to be a
matter but of courtesy; he cannot, (says he) justly say I do him wrong, if I
neglect it: But first, the Apostle Paul speaks another language, in his
account to make brethren to offend is to sin against them, to wound their weak
consciences, and so to sin against Christ. 1 Cor. 8. 12. Compared with ver. 11.
13. and Romans 14. 15. 20. he resolves, that it is a destroying of a brother for
whom Christ died, a destroying of the work of God in him: whereupon Divines
generally determine, that it is soule-murther: Now, in wounding the weak
conscience of our brother, in murdering his immortal soul, there is
doubtless some wrong committed against him: not to destroy him for whom Christ
dyed etc. is more than a matter of mere courtesy unto him.

Secondly, suppose the care of not giving offense be, in respect of our
brother, but debitum charitatis; yet in regard of God it is (...) justitiae, a
legal debt: he may, and does challenge it as due, and we do him wrong if we
disobey him. Our Savior thundereth a woe against such disobedience; Woe to him
through whom offenses come, Luke 17. 1. and in the second verse this woe is
aggravated by comparison with a very grievous punishment, it were better for
him that a Millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea,
then that he should offend one of these little ones.

But to proceed'unto the second comparison on which I insisted out of Bishop
Morton and Dr Sanderson: a Comparison betwixt a scandal given to a Magistrate,
and a scandal given to one, who is only a brother: I demand whether or no the
offense given to, or taken by a Magistrate, who is a brother, and withal a
Magistrate be not greater, than that which is given to, or taken by one, who is
only a brother? an impartial Judge will soon determine that the double
relation of brother, and Magistrate weighs down the single, and naked
relation of a brother etc. ut supra.

For answer unto this, distinguish we of a twofold acception of scandal,
Primary, and Secundary.

First, Primary, and so it is an occasioning culpably the fall of another into
sin.

Secondly, Secundary, and so it is only the angring, vexing, displeasing of
another.

This distinction premised; the comparison may be understood; either of the
scandal of a Magistrate in a secundary acception, with a scandal of one, who
is only a brother in a secundary acception of the word too; or else of the
scandal of a Magistrate in a secundary acception with the scandal of a
brother in a primary acception; or 3. of the scandal of a Magistrate in a
primary acception with the scandal of a brother in a primary acception also.

First; if the Comparison be on both sides to be understood of scandal taken
in a secondary sense, there is no doubt, but the scandal of the Magistrate is
more dangerous, than that of one, who is only a brother: for the wrath of the
supreme Magistrate is as the Messengers of death, Prove. 16. 14. as the roaring
of a Lion, Prove. 19. 12. In indifferent things then it will be our safest
course to anger a brother, rather then to displease the Magistrate. But this
acception of scandal is impertinent unto our purpose, and so much is consessed
by Dr Hammond in his treatise of scandal page: 23. To be angry, grieved,
troubled, at any action of another, is not (to be offended) in the scripture
sense, nor consequently does it follow, that I have done a miss in doing that
which another man is angry at, unless my action be in it self evil. The
scandal we speak of is culpable; but to displease a magistrate is not always
a sin: the mistake of scandal for the angring of one is taken notice of by
Calvin also upon 1 Cor. 8. 13. having affirmed, that some corrupted the
doctrine of scandal with foolish glosses, and others with their impious
calumnies, he shows the original of both their mistakes touching the meaning
of offense in the Apostle. Utrique errant in verbo offendendi. Nam offendere
accipiunt, pro incurrere in odium, vel effensionem hominum, aut quod idem fere
est, (...) quodipsis displiceat, vel minus arrideat. Atqui clarissime patet ex
contextu, nihil esse aliud quam mulo exemplo tanquam obice fratrem impedire a
recto cursu, aut illi praebere causam lapsus. Non ergo hic disput at Paulus de
retinenda hominum gratia, sed de sublevandis infirmis, ne (...), and prudenter
regendis, ne a recta via deflectant.

Secondly, if the comparison proceed of the scandal of the Magistrate in a
secondary sense with the scandal of a brother in a primary sense, doubtless
the scandal of a brother is more to be declined: it is far better to anger,
and displease a pious Magistrate, a religious Prince, a Parliament, a whole
Church, and Commonwealth, then culpably to occasion the fall of the meanest,
poorest, and most illiterate artizan into sin: and this will be denied by none
who know, that it is more dangerous to displease God, than man.

Thirdly, if the comparison be to be understood of the scandal of the
Magistrate in a primary acception with a scandal of a brother in a primary
acception too: then I should think, that the scandal of the Magistrate is the
greater, and more to be eschewed, it is a greater sin culpably to occasion the
fall of the Magistrate into sin, then the fall of a mere brother: because the
falls of Magistrates are of a more pernicious example, giving greater
countenance, and encouragement unto sin.

But this will no ways advantage our Sticklers for Ceremonies: for the
non-conformists deny, that their forbearance of Ceremonies did culpably
occasion the fall of the Magistrate into sin: and the contrary they expect to
have proved and not barely dictated.

One thing let me observe on the bie, before I pass on: and it is: that, if
those who make this comparison of the scandal of a Magistrate with the
scandal of a brother, take scandal on both sides in the primary acception
thereof: then they seem to intimate, that there may be a case wherein a man
may be necessitated culpably to occasion the fall, either of a Magistrate, or
of a brother into sin: Of a Magistrate if he forbear what he commands, of a
brother if he practice it: But this is not casus dabilis, for God by his
providence, can never necessitate a man unto sin: of this Rutherford speaks
very solidly in his resutation of the Dupliers page 41, 42. You shall (says he
unto them) be (...) to give a case, wherein we are necessitated by Gods
providence, and that by way of contradiction, whether we forbear, or forbear
not to murder either the souls of some weak ones, or the souls of
superiors, by our (...) of the practice of things judged expedient by
superiors: You make us to murder the souls of Superiors, by the
non-forbearance, or you will have us to murder the souls of weak brethren,
if we practice. This is a wronging of providence, and a Manichean tenent, that
we can be under such a necessity of sinning. Yea, there must be two contrary
revealed Wills in God, Commanding, by forbearing the Ceremonies, not to murder
Superiors, and commanding by not forbearing, not to murder weak brethren:
and so God commands both to forbear and also not to forbear. Mr Tombs [in
his treatise of scandalizing p. 266, 267, 268.] quarrels with Ames, for
affirming, that there can be no such perplexity, that it should be necessary
for a Godly man, whether he do this or that, or not do it, to scandalize some
one: But Dr Ames is to be understood of a scandal in the primary sense, a
culpable occasioning the fall of another into sin: and the objections of Mr
Tombs proceed only concerning scandal in a secundary acception thereof, as
will be apparent unto any one, that will be pleased to peruse them.

There be two things more I shall take notice of in my forementioned discourse.

First, I suppose all along that the Convocation was our Mother, and the Church
of England: but surely she was a step mother unto diverse of the Godly, using
toward them far more rigor, then unto such whom profanesse rendered
obnoxious unto their Courts: if any indifferent man look upon their Canons he
must needs confess, that one of their chief designs was to crush, and
persecute such religious persons, whom they nicknamed Puritans, to (...) with
their Ceremonies such among them for whom Christ died. But I wonder upon what
account, I, or any man else, could think it to be the Church of England. If in
any sense it can be called the Church of England, it was because it represented
the Ministry of England, and that it did not; because the far major part of
it were Cathedral men, Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, and such as were chosen
by the respective Chapters of each Cathedral: it might then be a
representation of the Cathedral Ministers, but not of the ministry of England:
and that I shall make good by two parallels.

The first shall be, betwixt our Convocations, and the Council of Trent: many
sober, and moderate Papists accused this to be a packed assembly, a
representation, of, not the Catholic Church, but the Court of Rome; because
the greatest part of it were of the Popes faction, and depended wholly upon him:
So the Major part of our Convocations were of the Bishops faction, and minded
chiefly the interests of Cathedrals: and therefore were not a representative of
all the Ministers in England. I shall exemplify this by instancing in the
Diocese of Bathe, and Wells, wherein I lived: In this there were members of
the lower house of Convocation, one Deane, three Archdeacons, and one chosen by
the Chapter of Wells: and to balance these there were but two Clerks chosen
by the Ministry of the whole Diocese: Now what impartial man, but will
determine that these seven could be no due representation of the Ministers of
the Diocese of Bathe and Wells, as long as five of them were members of the
Cathedral, in whose election the Ministers of the Diocese had no hand at all.

A second parallel shall be betwixt our convocation, and a civil assembly:
wherein we will suppose, that the Prince chooses three hundred, who are his
Courtiers, or else such as have their dependence, either wholly, or in great
part upon him: and the nation choose only a hundred: you may call this assembly
a Parliament, or what you will; but surely no rational man can think it to be
a representation of the nation: and as irrational were it to call the
Convocation a representation of the Ministers, of England, seeing those chosen
by the Ministers were an inconsiderable part of the Convocation.

And unto this we may add; that there was seldom a due, and regular choice
made of the Clerks of the Convocation: I was present at the last election, that
was at Wells: and then Bishop (...) told us, that it was an unquestionable
privilege due unto his See for him to propound unto us the Clerks that we
should choose, unto which he expected our conformity, tacitly menacing all that
dissented.

And when yet, by all this violence, he was unlikely to carry it for such as he
had nominated; why then, he had another shift, that was (I believe) never heard
of before: he enabled the Pluralists, of whom either all, or most were his
favorites, to voice it in several capacities: to give as many double voices,
as they had dignities, and benefices: his Son gave at that time eight single
voices, two as he was Archdeacon of Bath, two as he was Prebend of Cudworth,
two as he was Parson of Bucklan-Mary, two as he was Vicar of Kingsbury: Now, to
say that such an election was regular, and lawful is as ridiculous, and
senseless, as if a man should say, that in the Choice of Knights of the Shire
for Parliament, men may give as many double voices, as they have Farms and
Livings.

A second thing I shall take notice of, in the now mentioned discourse, is my
misinterpretation of the 1 Cor. 10. 32. Upon which I thus descanted: as Paul
exhorts to give none offense (...) to Jew nor Gentile, so he adds in a further
(...) (...) to the Church of God: The Jews and Gentiles were but parts, the
Church of God the whole, they but brethren, she the mother. Here was a gross
mistake, in thinking, that the Jews and Gentiles here spoken of were members
of the Church: whereas, by the Apostles distinction of them from the Church of
God, it is plain, that they were not as yet converted unto the Christian
faith, but were as yet enemies thereunto, and consequently strangers unto the
Church: And thus having finished my examination of the two limitations that I
gave in a former edition of this treatise. I shall go on to that which
follows.

But suppose the action in which this appearance of evil is imagined to be as
indifferent in it felfe, so also not annexed unto a necessary duty, and we also
left to the use of our liberty, what then?

Two things are here especially to be considered: first, the quality of the
action expected at; secondly, the difference of times, and places.

To begin with the first, the action (at which thy brother is scandalized, by
his groundless imagination, that it is evil, or carries a real appearance of
evil) is either of none, or great importance to thee.

If it be of none importance, but weightlesse, as affording thee either none,
or but small benefit: offend not thy brother by an unseasonable exercise of thy
liberty. Know that as authority, so charity should also restrain it: consider
that by this undue use of thy liberty thou sinnest against thy brother, and by
sinning against him thou sinnest against Christ. 1 Cor. 8. 12.

But now if it be of some weight, and moment, as yielding thee some great
profit, why thou must a while forbear it, until thy brother may be better
informed; and to inform him that the action is lawful which offends him, thou
must take care too, otherwise thou will prejudice the truth, through thy
regardlesse silence, and also continue his weakness, and foment in him a
negative superstition. Let every one of us, (says the Apostle, Romans 15. 2.)
please his neighbor for his good unto edification, And for a man to humor his
neighbor in an erroneous and superstitious opinion, however it may please him,
yet not for his good unto edification: Upon which ground I take it, that the
Apostle Paul, as he refused maintenance at Corinth, to avoid appearance of a
coveteous intention, and mercenary affection in preaching: so also his just
title, and unquestionable right thereunto he at large both professes, and
proves.

But now if thy brother refuse, and contemn information: Tunc desinit esse
scandalum pusilli ex (...), aut simplici ignorantia, et incipit esse scandalum
Pharisaei ex pura malitia, aut ignorantia affectata, and crassa. The shelter of
weakness is thereby taken from him, his judgment being now overshadowed no
longer with a mere weakness arising out of simple ignorance, but with a
proud, and wayward, if not envious and malicious perverseness, that is
accompanied with a gross, wilful, and affected ignorance, He is no longer
then to be accounted a weak one, but a proud and wilful one, and for his
peevishness thou may choose, whether thou will forgo thy liberty. Calvin
upon the 1 Cor. 8. 13. tells us os some foollish interpreters, that leave unto
Christians almost noe use at all of things indifferent, upon pretext to avoid
the offense of superstitious persons inepti sunt, inquit, qui nullum prope usum
rerum indifferentium (...) faciunt Christianis, ne superstitiosos offendant,
And he discovers the ground of their mistake to be; because they do not
consider, that Paul here inveigheth against those, who unseasonably abuse their
knowledge before such weak ones, whom they neglect to inform, or instruct
concerning the matter, at which they are scandalized: therefore there will be
no place for reprehension if such information preceed, In hoc hallucinantur
inquit, quod non (...) Paulum hic invehi adversus (...), qui scientia sua
intempestive abutuntur coram infirmis, quos docere negligunt. Ergo (...)
amplius locus non erit, si praecedat doctrina. Mr Tombs [in his treatise of
scandalizing, page 233, 234.] quotes Peter Martyr, and Bucane for the same
purpose, and this what they say is (...), ordinarily, or for the most part
true; for if we are to forbear all our conveniences, and matters of
expediency, when men are scandalized at them, after we have given them, or
offered to give them full information; our Christian liberty in things
indifferent would in these our times come to be just nothing: nay our servitude
would be greater, and more unsupportable, than that of the Jews under the
Leviticall Ceremonies.

However yet information does not always alter the nature of scandal; for the
scandal of the weak may sometimes last, Postquam reddita est ratio facti,
after a reason of the fact, whereat they are scandalized, is rendered to them.
For, by reason of their extreme ignorance, and slownesse of understanding,
they may be utterly incapable of information, and instruction; or else some
opinion, or practice, whereunto they have been long accustomed, may cast such a
mist before their weak judgments, as that they may not be able presently to
apprehend the reason that is given of the action, at which they stumble. And we
should so far pity the simplicity of such poor souls, as to abstain from
that which scandalizeth them, if by such abstinence there accrue not to us any
great loss, or inconvenience.

This is observed by Cajetan upon Aquinas 2. 2 dae. q. 43. art. 7. Ubi dicitur,
inquit, articulo 7 mo. de scandalo pusillorum, si autem (...) redditam rationem
hujusmodi scandalum duret, jam videtur ex malitia esse; adverto, quod author
non assertivo verbo utitur, sed opinativo, dicendo, jam videtur ex malitia
esse; potest siquidem contingere, quod pusilli non sint capaces rationis
redditae, vel propter pristinam consuetudinem, quae facit apparere dissonum,
quod veritati consonat, vel propter rationem apud eos magis apparentem, vel
aliquod hujusmodi: and tunc quia malitia non facit scandalum, sed ignorantia
vel infirmitas, quamvis reddita sit ratio, cessandum est ab hujusmodi
spiritualibus non necessariis. Cajetan. in 2. 2. 0. 43. etc. Whereas it is said
in the 7th article, touching the scandal of the weak, if after a reason given,
the scandal do still remain, it seems to be of malice; you must note the
Author does not use (verbo assertivo, sed opinativo) saying, it seems to be
of malice. For it may fall out that the weak are not capable of the reason
that is rendered, either by reason of his former Custom, which makes that to
appear discordant with the truth, or for some reason which in his eyes is more
apparent, or by reason of some such like cause, and then it is not out of
malice that he is offended, but out of ignorance and infirmity.

After Cajetan, Petrus de Lorica does roundly and fully express the matter.
Verum est (says he) quod Cajetanus advertit, scandalum pusillorum perseverare
posse adhuc, postquam reddita est ratio facti, vel quia rationem non capiunt ob
mentis tarditatem, vel ob consuetudinem diu firmatam: in quo casu docet
Cajetanus (...) esse actionem, ex qua scandalum accipiunt; vel differendam,
donec ad saniorem mentem venerint. Quod solum verum, si actio omitti potest
(...) jactura nostrae utilitatis. Si enim magna utilitas temporalis vel
spiritualis interveniat, contemni potest scandalum pusillorum, postquam
sufficienter admoniti sint. In the next place I will recite a limitation of
Gregory de Valentia, that comes under this head, and is very remarkable.

Having laid down a rule, that for avoiding the scandal of our neighbor,
which springs, either from his ignorance, or weakness, it behooveth us by
the obligation of Charity, to do, or omit, that which may be done, or left
undone without sin: he afterward puts this exception. Est autem
animadvertendum hanc regulam intelligi debere de omni eo, quod sine peccato
fieri, aut omitti possit, non quom: docunque, sed moraliter, attenta suavitate,
quae est in jugo legum divinarum: idest, quod sine peccato fieri, aut omitti
possit, sine maxima etiam aliqua, and pene intolerabili (...), spectata quoque
in hac condition (...) etc, And indeed (me thinks) he speaks reasonably. For
improbable seems it, that the sweet moderation, which is in the yoke of divine
laws, should consist with so great a rigor, as in all matters whatsoever, not
simply unlawful, to exact, not only a brotherly, but also a servile compliancy
with every supposed weak one, whose weakness may be but pretended by those,
that are willing to speak favorably of them. For the humouring and contenting
of every supposed weakling in all matters at which he takes offense, I conceive
not my self bound to endanger my life, to hazard my estate, and fortunes, or
to incur any other great, or notable inconvenience: for that would truly be
durus sermo, an hard saying: who were able to bear it?

But now against this may be objected the resolution of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 8.
13. if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world
stands, lest I make my brother to offend: flesh is of great expediency for
the nourishment of man's life, and yet Paul resolves upon a perpetual
abstinence therefrom in case of scandal Consequent; and this example of Paul
is obligatory unto all Christians.

For answer, first, this flesh may be understood only of such as was sacrificed
unto Idols; for words in scripture usually are to be restrained unto the
subject matter spoken of, and the meat, and flesh, here spoken of in the
Context, was such as had been offered unto an Idol.

Secondly, Calvin resolves that it is an Hyperbole: est, inquit, hyperbolica
locutio, quia vix possibile est, ut quis a carnibus tota vita abstineat,
siremaneat in communi vita: significat tamen se (...) usurum potius sua
liberate, quam ut fit insirmis offendiculo. Nunquam (...) licitus est usus,
nisi moderatus ad charitatis regulam. This Hyperbole of Paul's you may Parallel
with that of our Savior, (...). 5. 39, 40, 41. whosoever shall smite thee on
thy right (...), turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue (...) at
the Law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And (...) shall
compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

Thirdly, Paul is to be understood, only upon supposition that the Gospel
should not be fully promulgated, and brethren should remain uninstructed
concerning the nature of Christian Liberty; for usually it is in this case only,
that to eat flesh involves in the guilt of an active scandal, makes a brother
to offend: hence the Apostle exhorts the strong amongst the Romans to abstain
from meats forbiden by the Law of Moses, for prevention of the scandal of the
weak: but amongst the Galathians; and Colossians he dislikes such an
abstinence, and dehorts from it: and the reason, of this his (...) carriage,
was: because the weak amonst the Romans were not fully taught the doctrine of
Christian liberty, and the Galathians and Colossians were Julian, mistaking the
Apostles doctrine of scadall, thought to make use of it for the starving of the
Christias, and therefore, in Antiochia, and in the region round about, he
dedicated all the sountaines to the Goddesses of the Gentiles, and caused all
the victual, that was to be sold in market places, to be sprinkled with
Ethnic, holy waters, thinking that some would be scandalized at the drinking
of the water of such fountains, and at the eating of such victual, and that
the Apostles doctrine obliged all to forbear any thing in the (...) of
scandal: never-thelesse Christians, without scruple of conscience, drank of
the water, that was in the Wels, and ate of the meat, which they bought in the
market; being, since the full publication of the Gospel, fully persuaded,
that to the clean all things are clean. Rutherford determines; that, since
the plenary promulgation of the Gospel, we are not obliged to forbear the
good Creatures of God, things good, fit, and useful for the life of man, or of
physical use in the worship of God, though men be scandalized at such things,
and the reason of their scandal be, because they have been abused unto
Idolatry, and superstition: he instanceth in Churches, (...) unto the saying of
Mass, and unto the Idolatrous worship of Saints, and in bells that have been
abused by Papists by being consecrated, baptized and used to chase away devils:
and for this his determination you may gather out of him [p. 69, 70, 71, 72,
75, etc.] these two reasons.

First, because abstinence from such things, (upon a religious account, for
avoidance of scandal, because abused to Idolatry, and superstition,) would be,
(after a (...) publicatio^ of the Gospel) a Judaizing, an external Co^formity
with the Jew, a betraying of our Christian liberty, a co^firming and hardening
the Jews in their Apostasy: it would make, as Paul says, Jesus Christ of no
effect, it would make us debtors to Circumcision, and to all the Ceremonies of
Moses, Ga. 5. 3, 4.

Secondly, the practice of such things, since we are (...) possessed in that
liberty, wherewith Christ has made us free, is morally and Theologically
necessary, for the asserting of our Christian liberty: to show, that every
Creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, (...) Tim. 4. 4. That unto
the pure all things are pure, (...) 1. 15. that we dare not call that unclean
which God has cleansed, Act. 10. 15.

But there is one passage in this author concerning scandal, which I cannot
in any ways approve of: it is page 58, 59. where he averreth, that things of
mere civil use, that are necessary with a necessity of convenience are to be
forborne, if scandal follow, if they be not convenient in the highest degree.
And that no man may think I misreport him, take his own words. There be some
things of (...) civil use, as Bells, gowns, Pulpits, preaching on Tuesday or
Thursday. These be considered two (...). 1. As necessary with (...) of (...)
simply. 2. With (...) of (...) secundum (...) gradum, as convenient in the
highest degree of necessity, or that moral maximum quod sic. In the first
degree, what scandalizeth, is to be rejected: in the last respect they oblige,
and (...) any be scandalized thereat, it is taken and not given.

But sure this doctrine if embraced will put and hold men's Consciences upon a
perpetual rack: For it will be a matter of great difficulty especially for
some men allwaies to determine what in their indifferencies is convenient in
the highest degree.

Secondly, we must put a difference between times, and places: for however they
be but circumstances of actions, and therefore extrinsecall to them, so that
they cannot cause any such essential variation in them, as to make those
actions materially good, or sinful, which are of themselves in their own
nature indifferent: yet notwithstanding the public and ordinary abuse of an
action at such a time, or in such a place, may make it then and there, in that
place and for that time appear to be evil; although the same action at
another time, and in the same place; or in another place, at the same time, may
not be obnoxious to any such censure.

First then, time may alter this imaginary appearance of evil in an action.
Reservation of the brazen serpent, as for other ends and purposes, so for
commemoration of that miraculous deliverance of the Israelites thereby, from
the stings of fiery Serpents, was for a while free from all suspicion, either
of Idolatry or superstition: but when once it became the general, ordinary,
nay daily occasion, and object of Idolatry that can be, when incense was
offered to it: then if the public Magistrate had not demolished it, he might
justly have been thought to favor that Idolatry wherewith it was polluted. And
therefore commednable was Hezekiah his zeal in breaking it in pieces, 2 King
18.4.

In the former Edition it was observed out of Morton that the same Hezekiah did
not destroy the high places, which Solomon had built for Astoreth, the
abomination of the Sidonians: and for Chemosh, the abomination of the Moabites;
and for Milchom, the abomination of the Children of Ammon, and yet was never
taxed for countenancing of Idolatry. For in his days the Idols there erected,
were disregarded no man worshipping them, and therefore might safely be
suffered to stand: but when afterward they were generally and usually adored,
then the good King Josiah justly demolished them: and indeed should he have
permitted them then when the Idolatry wherewith they were defiled, was flagrant
at the height, he might justly be suspected to be a favourer of that Idolatry.

But unto this observation of Mortons; Ames thus replyeth. He propounds, as
very observable, that Hezekiah did not abolish the Idols, which Solomon
suffered to be set up, because they were neglected. But. 1. it may well be
thought that those idols were destroyed by Hezekiah, and set up again before
the time of Josiah, as many other superstitions were. 2. It cannot be doubted
but they should have been destroyed, even though they were for the time
neglected: because either Hezekiah had as good cause to destroy them as Josiah,
or else he might have prevented that cause which Josiah had: and to prevent
evil, we are as well bound, as to correct it.

Unto this Reply of Ames, Dr. Burges rejoineth, whose Rejoinder and Ames his
Triplication I shall rather transcribe them then Epitomize.

Dr Burges his Rejoinder unto the first part of the Reply.
Say you so? then belike it may be well thought that the holy Ghost knew not so
well as you what was done, for the text says, that Josiah destroyed those high
places, which Solomon King of Israel had set up: and then describes by the very
place, where, and by name those same Idols, which Solomon had set up for his
outlandish wives, 1 King. 11.5,7. I hope you will repent this rashness, I am
sure you should.

Because the Defender did make this one ground of denying our consequence from
Hezekiahs zeal against the monuments of Idolatry, that he did not abolish the
Idols which Solomon suffered to be set up in favor of his strange Wives:
because they were (at that time) neglected Idols. It was replied, that it may
be well thought, they were destroyed by Hezekiah, and set up again before the
time of Josiah. This the Rejoinder calls rashness to be repented of: because
it is said (2. Reg. 23.13.) that Josiah destroyed those high places, which
Solomon had set up. And was it such a rashness, to say that it may be thought
so? the phrase is more mod^st then theirs, who peremptorily affirm those Idols
to have been neglected, until after Hezekias time: when the Scripture
testifies plainly, that Ahaz Hezekiahs his father worshipped Molech (which was
one of those Idols) by making his son to pass through teh fire: and was so
madly given to superstition, that he sacrificed under every green tree. 2. Reg.
16. Nay less was said, then some learned have with great probability affirmed:
Existimamus etiam, vlvo Salomone, omnem illam daemonum officinam disruptam
fui^le, dilaceratam, atque disperditam. Videnturque referendae illae statuae,
and luci, and ^rae and reliqua Idolatriae monumenta (2. Reg. 23.13.) ad
Manastem, and Ammonem (qui exc^taverant illa ^ncodem loco and ^upra eadem
funda^enta) non ad Salomonem, ante annos 250. extinctum. Incredibile dictu est,
tantum scandalum ab Asa, Josaphato, Joiada, cum late idolatriam disperderent,
in oeulis ipsis positum, non vidisse, aut non ausoattingere, and ad annum 3405.
Mirum profe^^ si Idola illa post tercentos 50. annos subsisterent, quae Solomon
ipse poenitens, and caeteri reges boni su^tuliessent, Utique dicendum videtur,
ab impiis regibus extructa fuisse ejusdem generis fana, and Idola, quae olim
Solomon in lisdem locis extruxerat: ut illud quae aedificaverat Solomon, sit
idem ac si dixisset, qualia aedisicaverar.
Namely that those Idols with their appurtenances were first defaced by Solomon
himself, after his repentance; and being restored after by Idolaters, were
again defaced. Salianus (in his Annals ad an. 3309.) says thus: we think
also that while Solomon lived, that whole shop of Devils was broken up and
ruined. And withal the statues, the groves, and altars, as also the rest of
Idolatrous monuments. 2. King. 23. 13. to have reference to Manasses, and Ammon
(who had set them up in the same place, and upon the same foundation) and not
to Solomon, who ayed 250 years Before. It is incredible to speak, that when
Asa, Josaphat, and Jehoiada did far and near (...) idolatery, they
notwithstanding suffered a scandal so apparent. And to the year 3406. It were
very strange if those idols after 350 years should yet remain, the which
Solomon after his repentance, and other good Kings had abolished. So that it is
probable that such like temples, and Idols were repaired, and built up again
by other succeeding ungodly Kings, which Solomon in former time had made: that
that which Solomon builded should be all one with such like as he had builded.

Where he shows by diverse instances, both out of scripture, and out of common
speech, how that word which, does not always note the same singular substance;
therein confuting all the ground that the Rej. had for censuring the Repl. of
rashness to be repented of. This sentence is the more also to be favored;
because according to the other, which our Def. and Rej. maintain, it will be
very hard to answer that objection against Solomon's repentance, which Solomon
de (...) Idolatriae scelere, nunquam perfect paenituit. Nam si fractus
paenitentiae dignos faceret, satageret ante omnia, ut idola quae aedificaverat,
tollerentur, and non in scandalum stultotum, quae ipse cum fuisset
sapientissimus, erronea fecerat quasi sapiente ac recte facta relinqueret.
Rabanus on 2 Reg: 23. groundeth on that supposition: Solomon never truly
repented of his Idolatry: for if he had manifested fruits worthy repentance, he
would have taken order with those Idols, which he had set up by removing them,
and (being so wise a man) never have left them to stand for stumbling blocks
to fools, as if what he had erroneously devised, had been well and wisely
done. Beside all this, it is not credible, that the same individual Temples
stood by Jerusalem from Solomon's time to Josias; if it were but for this, that
the Assyrians came even to the gates of Jerusalem, spoiling and breaking down
all costly buildings, (Such as Solomon's Temples were) not sparing, but deriding
the Gods of nations. 2. Reg. 8.

Unto the second branch of the Reply Dr. Burges thus rejoineth

Burges his Rejoinder,
This prooves not that they were, nor is it likely that God himself would have
vouchsased such through praises to Hezekiah, as he does, 1. Kings. 18. 5. If
Hezekiah had been bound to destroy those neglected Idols, as well as others
(...) taken in the manner, and did not say, why he was bound to do that which
he did not.

Because either Hezekiah had as good cause to destroy them as Josiah; or else
he might have prevented that cause which Josiah had; and to prevent evil, we
are as well bound, as to correct it.

If Hezekiah had as good cause to destroy those high places, which stood
neglected, (and had done perhaps about three hundred years, even since the
death of Solomon's wives, whose Chapels they were) as Josiah had, when
Manasses, or Ammon had, after Hezekiah his time, revived that Idolatry; the
holy Ghost would have taxed Hezekiah for not doing that, for doing whereof he
commends Josiah; or at least, not have left his integrity crowned with like
praises, as he does, 2 Kings, 18. 5. nor was Hezekiah bound to (...) the cause
which Josiah had, unless he had suspected it. For though we are bound to
prevent evil which we for see, so far as we well can, yet are we not bound
to foresee all that may happen. Neither are the same means always requisite
for prevention, which must be used for recovery. If you think otherwise, burn
all your popish books, (...) they fall into the hands of popelings, and do
mischeife; for you are bound to prevent evil, as well as to correct it.

Ames his Triplication.
It was added by the Repl. that those Idols should have been destroyed, (though
they had been for the time neglected) because that evil for which Josiah
destroyed them, ought as well to have (...) prevented as corrected. To this the
(...) answers, that this is not true, except Hezekiah had suspected that
evil. And who will say, that there is no cause to suspect evil of an Idol,
though it be for a time neglected? or can any man think, that if the
Israelites had neglected them, no Sydonian, Moabite, or Ammonite gave occasion
of any evil to be (...) by those Idols? The Spanish and French Papists (to say
nothing of English) when they in passing by the Cross in Cheape-side, do (...)
unto it, give they not cause to suspect (...) evil to (...) unto it? The same
means. (says (...) Rejoinder) are not (...) (...) requisite for prevention,
which must be used for recovery. Yes truly, about Idols (if we judge out of the
Scripture) the very same means. Burn then ( says the Rejoinder) all your
Popish books, (...) they fall into the hands of Popelings to abuse them. So
will I certainly, if you can show me, that they must be burned, when Popelings
have had them in their hands, and abused them, which here you grant concerning
these Idols.

Here is nothing of the Rejoinder left unexamined, but his quotation of the 2
Kings 18. 5. and how impertinent y that is alleged will appear by comparison
of it with 1 King. 15. 5. David did that, which was righ in the eyes of the
Lord, and turned not aside from any thing, that he commanded him all the days
of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. For (...) this
commendation of David we may as well conclude, that his numbering of the
people, and his purpose and attempt to revenge himself of Nabal by destroying
him and all his, were lawful; as we may infer from the praises of Hezekiah,
that his omission in not demolishing Solomon's outlandish Idols, must be
unlawful: See Rutherford page 90.

Secondly, we must distinguish of places. That which in some places carries a
show of evil, elsewhere perhaps is not suspected thereof. According to places
therefore, in indifferent matters we may vary our practice. It was the advice
of Ambrose unto Austin, and Monica, respected by Austin, as if it had been the
answer of an heavenly oracle; Ad quamcunque Ecclesia (...), inquit, ejus mone^
servate, si pati scandalum non (...), aut facere. Aug. Ep. 86.
unto whatsoever Church ye shall come, observe the manner or custom thereof,
if ye will neither give nor take scandal. Which advice if restrained unto
things indifferent is very good: and besides we have Paul's precept, and
president for it: his precept, 1 Cor. c. 10. v. 32. Give none offense, neither
to (...), nor Gentile, which could not be done, but by complying with them in
indifferencies. His president also answers his precept; To the Jews he
became a Jew, to them that were under the Law, as under the Law; to them that
were without the law, as without the Law; to the weak, as weak, 1 Cor. 9. 20,
21, 22. Amongst the Jews he shaved his head, made a vow, Acts 18. 18. and
(...) was then indifferent, but after the full promulgation of the Gospel it
became to be not only mortua but mortifera, not only dead but deadly, as being
an interpretative deny all of Christ's coming in the flesh.
circumcised Timothy, Acts 16. 3. and yet amongst the Gentiles, where these
actions bore an appearance of Judaisme, he withstood Peter for them even to his
face, Gal. 2. 11. There be three other instances in the former edition, which
because they are questionable I shall wholly wave, and pass on unto the
examination of my vain triumph over the non-consormists, wherein, as the
Proverb is, I reckoned without mine host.

Former Edition.
After these limitations of the duty of abstinence from all appearance of
evil; I cannot but wonder at our irregulars misapplication of it. They hence
eagerly cry down the laudable discipline, and lawful Ceremonies of our Church.
What fearful outcries do they make concerning their appearance of Idolatry,
superstition, will worship and Popery? (...) you see by the exceptions put to
this precept, as much too by for our innocent, and (...) Ceremonies, as
Hercules Hooker.
shoe, for a child's foot. Indeed our Ceremonies, for example, the Surplice,
Cross in Baptism, kneeling at the Lords Supper, may have a material
semblance with those that in Popery have been abused to Idolatry, and
superstition, and so consequently taken materially, in respect of their
materials, may have an outward show of Popish Idolatry, or superstition; but
consider them as imposed by our Church, and generally used by her members, so
they are formally differenced from those which Papists have applied to
Idolatrous ends and purposes. For our Church publicly professes a quite
contrary use or application, end, or intention of them. And external actions
have their specification, and consequently distinction from their end, and
intention, from it they take their species, or kind, and accordingly are
distinguished. Now since all Popish, whether superstitious, or idolatrous
abuses of our Ceremonies, are publicly disclaimed, and their right use
explained; who can justly imagine any show of Popery in them? An Israelite was
not to be smitten for an Egyptian, because for a while he once sojourned in
Egypt, if afterward he had his constant abode in Canaan. The garment spotted
with the flesh was no longer to be hated, than spotted: being once washed, it
might again be used. Our Ceremonies were defiled in Egypt, in Popery, with
superstitiom, and Idolatry; but our Church (God be praised) has washed them
from both in her public, and professed use of them. And therefore now they
stand above either calumny or suspicion.

Examination.
First, our non-conformists will tell us, that there was betwixt our
Ceremonies, and those of the Papists, even a formal conformity, (...), and in
part, though not total and adequate. For though our Prelates disavowed many,
nay most of those superstitious and idolatrous ends, unto which the Papists
applied our Ceremonies, yet they still prosessed one end and intention of the
Papists in the use of them, to wit, mystical signification; and this to be a
Popish and superstitious end, the non-conformists prove at large in their books.

Secondly, a material conformity in Ceremonies, carries many times a real
appearance of evil, and scandalizeth actively. It does not appear that the
Altar which Uriah erected, was formally the same with that Ahaz saw at
Damascus, that it had the same use and intention, the worship of a false God.
The text mentions only a material conformity unto it, and for this reason
it is condemned, 2 King. 16. 10, 11. Peter's conformity with the Jews Gal. 2.
was only material, not formal, for a Jewish end and purpose, and yet it is
blamed by Paul as guilty of an active scandal, verse. 11, 12, 13, 14. Suppose a
timorous Protestant in Spain or Italy go to Mass, and there bow before their
breaden God, not out of any intent to honor the Idol, but only for
preservation of his life; his presence and bowing will only be materially the
same with that of Papists; but will any man think that this can acquit him from
the sin of Idolatry? Indeed Aelian var. Histor. lib. 1. cap. 21. excuses
Ismenias a Thobane from adoring the King of Persia, because though he stooped
down before him, yet it was not to worship him, but to take up a ring that he
had for the nonce let fall at his feet: but no rational man will admit of this
his apology, because this stooping in common use was the adoration of the King,
and interpreted to be such by the King himself, and by the spectators.

Some think that though a different end and intention from Pagans, Jews, and
Heretics in the use of their Ceremonies, cannot legitimate them and free them
from scandal; yet that profession of such a different end and intention, is
sufficient for such a purpose. But

First, the primative Church was of a different opinion. Ames dispute about
humane Ceremonies page 127.
The story of Origin is well known, how he delivered Palm to those that
offered it to the image of Serapis, with this expression of his intention: come
and receive the boughs, not of the image, but of Christ. Yet was he therefore
censured as a worshipper of that Idol.

Secondly, if this were true, then we might lawfully use circumcision and the
passover, so we disclaim the Jewish end of them, to signify Christ to come;
and profess that our intention, was by them only to signify, that Christ was
already come in the flesh.

Thirdly, a material conformity with Papists in their Ceremonies, has
nourished in them a hope of our coming up to them, but not inclined them in any
degree unto us: for they have still protested that they would not step so much
as one foot to mere with us: and if my memory fail me not, there is some such
thing in Franciscus Sancta Clara.

Indeed experience has always showed, how uneffectuall a means such a
compliance has been for the conversion of Papists. Whom of them has it ever
won over unto the Protestant party, but Spalato, and others of the like
temper, who (as Mr Fuller speaks of some Italians that pretended unto true
conversion) were neither good dough, nor good bread, but like Ephraim a Cake
not turned?

There was a greater material conformity with Popish Ceremonies in Cathedrals,
then in other Churches; but how thin a harvest of converts can they produce?
Nay it is observed by some, that near them, Popery thrived more then in other
places. I heard a Knight of the royal party once affirm, in the presence of
many persons of worth, that he thought there were more Papists in Wells then in
all the County of Somerset besides: and yet of late years that Cathedral
outstripped most in England for Ceremoniousnesse. In the times immediately
preceding the late troubles, not only the former Ceremonies of the
Common Prayer book were urged with more violence than before, but diverse
others quite antiquated were revived. But though Popish Ceremonies were
increased, we do not find that the number of Papists was hereby any thing
diminished. I shall conclude this with that of Didoclave page 540, 541.
Formalistae se retinere quosdam ritus Pontificiorum, ut eos lucrifacere
possent, and reducere in rectam viam. Deus in dirigendis suis prudentissimus
aliam praescripsit rationem, long diversam, ut nempe ab omni gentium

But I pass on to the second thing I proposed, the confirmation of the point;
where my proofs shall be applied some to real, some to imaginary appearances
of evil.

First, See it backed by consonant places of Scripture. Solomon advises his
young man to walk caute, as well as (...), not to come nigh the docre of the
strange woman's house, Prove. 5. 8. This had not evilnesse real, but only the
appearance of evil, as being in a corrupt mind an incentive to uncleanesse,
and in beholders an occasion of jealousies and suspicions. Now from Solomon's
interdicting this appearance of evil in special, we may by way of Analogy and
(...) (...) a fitness of forbearing all in general. Unto this is anagogically
applied the Nazarites precise abstinence from wine, Number. 6. 3, 4. The Nazarite,
as you may see there, was to abstain from wine, from vin gar of wine, from any
liquour of grapes, from the materials of wine, grapes, from moist grapes, from
dried grapes, from all that is made of the vine tree, from not only the
kernel, but even the husk of the grape. The Jews have added, they were not to
come nigh a vineyard. With a semblable strictness are we to separate from
sin, from all sin, not only from the kernel of sin, from a sin really
so, but also from the husk, the appearance of sin.

The Children of Israel were charged not to do like the Heathen that were
round about them, 2 King. 17. 15. where they are interdicted not (...)
samenesse with, but also likeness unto their fashions: they were forbidden the
fashion of rounding their heads, and cutting their flesh, of marring the
corners of their beards, of making any baldness upon their heads, or between
their eyes, Lev. 19. 28. and chap. 21. ver. 25. Deuteronomy. 14. 1. Not because so to
do was simply in its own nature a sin, but for that it gave show of a sin, of
inordinate sorrow for the departed; of which 'twas then an expression much in
use amongst the heathen. Hugo Cardinalis upon the text alleges Hosea 2. 16.
Thou shall call me Ishi, and shall call me no more Baali.

The Gentiles gave the title of Baal, so also of Baalim unto their great and
common Idol-God, supposed to be the Sun, and to all the several images, and
representations thereof. And therefore God prohibited application of that title
unto himself, in worship and invocation: Thou shall no more call me, o my
Baal: for though there be no harm in the word (it signifying in Common use
husband, as well as Ishi) yet by reason of the ordinary application thereof
unto Idols, there would have been in invocation of God by that name, a gross
and palpable appearance of Idolatry. Dico (...) (...) suisse prehibitam (...)

excepted, that most of these rigid, and severe prohibitions, were given unto
the Jews under their pedagogie of ceremonies, and time of bondage, and
therefore farther then in a moral admonition lay no restraint upon us
Christians. See therefore all this seconded in the New Testament by Locus hic,

St Jude ver. 23. Where in reference to that legal pollution, which came by
touching the garment of one that was Levitically unclean, he exhorts
Christians to hate the garment spotted by the flesh, that is, says Gualter,
quicquid ingenium carnis sapit, whatsoever has but a smack or relish of the
flesh, all preparations and accessaries of evil, any thing that is near of
kin unto, or but bordering upon vice, thinks Calvin.

Observe here the emphaticall gradation of the Apostle, hate not only the
flesh, but the garment spotted by the flesh, not only the garment overspread,
quite covered, but the garment that was but here and there a little spotted by
the flesh. Out of Christ's garment there issued virtue, which cured the woman
that had the bloody flux; but contrariwise out of this garment, but spotted
with the flesh, exit vis quaedam maligna, there goes a poisonous kind of
infection, which soon will stain a soul with the leprosy of sin.

Unto this place of Jude I shall add another out of the Apostle Paul, Heb. 4.
1. Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us, of entering into his
rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. Hence (...) collects, that
we must not only fear, by misbelieving to come short; but to seem, or give
any appearance of coming short. Pareus also has the like note upon the place,
verbo (...), videatur, sollicitudine tanta hic opus esse innuit, ut non modo
quae revera nos frustrent, sedetiam quae videatur frustratura provide caveamus.

But because (as the old saying runs) praxis sanctorum est interpres
praeceptorum, I shall entreat you next to take notice, how this precept has
been exemplified, The Church. Those words Cant. 1. 7. as one that turns (...)
side, may be rendered, as one that is recovered or (...). This sense the Greek
(...) gives, according to the usual signification of the Hebrew word: and
this covering either is asigne of sorrow and shame: as (...) used to cover
their faces, Ezekiel. 24. 17. or of lightness and dishonesty, as Thamar was
thought to be an (...) because she had covered her face Genesis 38. 14. 15. So
here the spouse desires to know where Christ (...), lest she should wander
about and (...) him with sorrow, and be by others reputed an (...), for she
would (...) all appearance of evil. Ainsworth in locum.
Cant. 1. 7. professes against, even all show of communion with false Churches
that pretend unto fellowship with Christ, Why should I be as one that turns
aside by the flocks of thy companions?

But to come unto particular examples, and here in the times before Christ, is
very remarkable the courageous and undaunted resolution of Eleazar, against
but the appearance of an evil. 2 Mac. c. 6. v. 18. usque ad sinem: When he was
besought to bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to
use, and but make as if he did (...) of the flesh, taken from the sacrifice
commanded by the King. v. 21. Why? even this evil appearance, this seeming,
this making as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by
the King, so deeply disrelished him, as that he chose death before it. For it
becomes not our age (says he) in any wise to dissemble, whereby many young
persons might think that (...) being four score years old and ten, was now gone
to a strange religion; and so they through mine hypocrisy, and desire to live a
little time, and a moment longer, should be deceived by me, and I get a stain
to my old age, and make it abominable. v. 24 25. But why mention I (...)?
behold the example of one greater then Eleazar, the example of the rule and
pattern of holiness unto the Church, Christ Jesus God blessed for ever! whose
example, in Morals and matters of ordinary obedience, amounts ever unto the
authority of a command. How exemplarie he was in this particular you may read
Matthew. c. 17. from v. 24, unto the end of the Chapter. There you have him
performing an action, not for that omission of it would have been evil, but
because in opinion of the Jews, it would have given show of evil. For if
first, you understand the words, as most Interpreters do, of the tribute to be
paid unto the secular Magistrate, then sinful it had not been in our Savior
to have refused payment of tribute unto Caesar. For how could the Son to the
living God (who was King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, King of heaven, and
earth, whose the earth and all the (...) thereof was,) be justly tributary unto
any mortal? The Kings of the earth take tribute, or custom, not of their
own children, (however they expect obedience from them) but of strangers;
because paying of tribute denotes some degree, or kind of Servitude. The
children then are free, verse. 25, 26. Therefore from all taxes and impositions,
justly was to be exempted Christ, the Son of David; there was no reason he
should pay tribute unto Caesar: nay more reason (he being of the blood royal)
should receive tribute from the Jews, than Caesar, a forrainer, having no
title to the Crown, but that which the sword gave him. Not payment, constant
denial of payment, had not been (you see) morally evil in our Savior; and
yet because it would have borne appearance of an evil, of disloyalty, and
disobedience, and so have drawn prejudices against, and scandal upon his
unspotted person, holy and heavenly office, and doctrine: because seemingly it
would have crossed a doctrine he afterward delivered, Render unto Caesar the
things which are Caesar's: therefore he stands not to plead his privilege, but
voluntarily parted with his right, paid the tribute, and to pay it wrought a
miracle: notwithstanding, Peter, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
(...), and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up, and when
thou have opened his mouth, thou shall find a piece of money, that take, and
give unto them for me and thee, verse. 27.

Or if secondly, with the learned Cameron, you rather conceive to be here meant
the half shekell, which by prescript of the Ceremonial Law, Exodus 30. was by
the Jews to be paid for the use of the Sanctuary. Why yet so also sinful it
had not been in our Savior to have refused paying of it: for first, it was a
Ceremony, and the Ceremonial Law Christ was above, Lord he was of the
Sabbath, Matthew. c. 12. ver. 8. Mar. c. 2. v. 28. where it is manifest (thinks
Cameron) the Sabbath should (...) signify the whole Ceremomall Law. Then
secondly, this Ceremony, together with Sacrifices and all other Legal,
typical Ceremonies, presupposed sin in the party, to whom they were commanded,
and were a note, or badge contracted by sin; and therefore reach not unto
Christ, a man without sin. Thirdly, as our Savior well argues, even as Kings
of the earth take not tribute of their own Children, so neither the King of
Heaven of his Son, therefore seeing this half shekel is a tribute to be paid
to the King of Heaven, for the Tabernacle of witness. 2 Chro. 24. 6. Christ
was certainly free, and so might lawfully have refused to pay it: Yet because
the Jews would have taken offense, and umbrages at such his resusall, and
charged it with appearance of a profane contempt of the Law of Moses, and the
Sanctuary, therefore he voluntarily paid it, and so became a Jew to the Jews,
as under the Law to them that were under the Law: Notwithstanding lest we
should offend, etc. And if this be the sense of the place, what is said of this
one Ceremony, may be applied unto all; for one of the reasons, and ends, why
Christ observed the whole Ceremonial Law was, to prevent scandal, to abstain
from all appearance of evil. In nature (says Cameron) there is, appetitus
quidem unionis, which causes things to be moved, and to rest often, besides
the proper condition of their particular nature, whence sometimes light things
are moved downwards, heavy things upwards. Unto this appetite of union in
nature, there is answerable in grace, the desire to promote Gods glory, which
often inclines and carries the Godly beyond and besides the ordinary
obligations, arising out of their particular and personal conditions and
relations. And unto the measure of grace is proportionable the degree of the
desire of Gods glory, so that the holier any one is, the more vehemently he
desires the promotion thereof: and if it require any thing to be done of him,
why he will do it, although otherwise by virtue of his particular, and
personal condition, he be not bound thereunto. Therefore although Christ,
secundum (...) rationem personae suae, if we eye the special consideration,
and dignity of his person, was not tied to keep the Ceremonial Law, yet he
kept it, in as much as the Glory of God required him so to do. If you demand
how the glory of God exacted this at Christ's hands, why Christ himself tells
us, Ne simus illis scandalo, lest we should offend them; for if Christ had not
observed the Ceremonial law, he had doubtless wonderfully estranged the Jews
from him.

In observing it then he did but as Kings often do in stooping to many things,
unto which they are no ways obliged, for to win the hearts and affections of
their humorous subjects. This example of our Savior, was followed by the
Ap^stles, and elders in the first general Council at Jerusalem, where they
imp^sed upon the Gentiles abstinence from meat offered to Idols, from things
strangled, and from blood, Acts 15. 29. Not for that these meats were in
themselves unclean, and abominable, but because they appeared to be so to the
froward and peevish Jews, who were kept off from Christ, because these meats,
in which they supposed to be such abomination and uncleanesse, were usually
eaten by the Christians. But this was but a temporary injunction they gave to
others. Let us view their own practice. Maintenance for preaching was due unto
Paul, from both the Corinthians and Thessalonians, and yet he did forbear
exacting it, 1 Cor. 9. 1 These. 2. that so he might take away all color for
suspicion of any mercenary or greedy appetite after gain, to be in his
preaching, and quice cut off all scandalls thereby, which in that dawning of
Christianity upon them, would have put a rub to the progress of the Gospel,
and have made his ministry to be evil spoken off. And of St Paul, the Saints
in succeeding ages were sollowers, as he of Christ. Those (...), so often, and
sharply censured by St Cyprian Epist. 15. 31. 52. lib. de lapsis. lib. de
exhortatione Martyrum, Though they did not sacrifice, or directly deny Christ,
were yet by the Church put to their penance, for seeming to deny him, because
they either by themselves, or others, at least accepted from the Magistrate
bills, or scroules testimonial of their abnegation. Secundus (as Parker
relates out of (...) (...) Secundus and ad scipsum (...) a Curarore and ordine

Auxentius being commanded by Licinius to set a branch of a Vine-tree laden

favored (...), or given manifest appearance of it, rather than do it, he chose

boys of Samosatene, who because a tennis-ball, with which they played, had
but touched the foot of the ass whereon Lucius rode, their Heretical Bishop,
they presently cried out that it was defiled, (although indeed it was not
capable of any moral pollution) and therefore to purge or expiate it, threw it
into the fire in the midst of the Market place. This may be thought, but a
Childish pranke, and therefore not imitable, however yet it aptly serves to
demonstrate that their education, framed them unto a hatred of whatsoever had
any remote reference, unto either evil actions, or persons. St Ambrose forbad
Monica the bringing of wine and cakes to the Celebrities of the Martyrs, ne
ulla occasio se ingurgitandi daretur ebriesis, and quia illa quasi parentalia
superstitioni Gentilium essent simillima, as St Austin lib. 6. Confess. c. 2.
lest occasion of excessive quaffing should be given to drunkards, and because
those parentalia, funeral feasts, were very like to heathenist superstition,
the offerings of the Pagans which were made at the Tombs of their parents, and
to their ghosts. Bishop Morton assigns another reason, because this custom,
had some resemblance of those superstitious, and idolatrous Colorydians,
mentioned by Epiphanius, who offered cakes to the Virgin Mary, in imitation of
that heathenish custom condemned by the prophet Jeremy chap. 7. ver. 18. of
such as did offer cakes to the Moon, as unto the Queen of heaven. Now when
Monica understood that Saint Ambrose had forbidden this, tam pie, atque
obedienter (...) est, ut ipse mirarer, says St Austin in that forecited place,
quod tam facile accusatrix potius consuetudinis (...), quam disceptatrix illius
prohibitionis effecta sit: she so piously, and obediently embraced this
prohibition, as that I my self, says Austin, wondered to see her so easily
rather accuse her own custom, than dispute his command. When once the custom
of thrice dipping or sprinkling in Baptism was used by Heretics, to signisy a
trinity not of persons, but natures in the Godhead, then Saint (...) thought
fitting that it should be left off, not because it was evil, but for that it
might seem to countenance their (...) heresy: his words are these, De trina
vero (...) baptismatis nihil responderi verius potest, quam quod ipsi sensitis,
quod in una side nihil officit sanctae Ecclesiae consuetudo diversa, etc. sed
quia nunc hucusque ab haereticis infans in baptismate (...) mergebatur,

dividant, dumque quod faciebant faciunt, se morem nostrum vicisse glorientur.
lib. 1. Epist. 41. Gabriel Biel lectione 38: says, that the Church of Rome
thought it meet to use common leavened bread in the administration of the
Eucharist, lest in using unleavened bread, they should be deemed to imitate
Ebion the heretic. Nay Rellarmine in his recognition of his book de verbo
(...), admonishes the Reader, that in the title of the third Chapter of the
first book, Divi Pauli is put for Beati Pauli, for in making mention of the
Saints, I never approved (says he) the use of the word divus, or diva, and one
of his reasons, is; because amongst the Heathens, 'twas usually ascribed to
their false, or fained Gods.

To heap up other, either testimonies, or instances, were to prejudice, if not
the authority of those before mentioned, yet your esteem of them, as if you
were not by them sufficiently persuaded and convinced. My labor (I suppose)
will be better spent in demonstrating unto you the expediency of that, which
may seem rigor in this Doctrine, in discovering unto you what good reasons
Saint Paul had to exact so great a measure, and so high a pitch of abstinence
from sin. Those that I will specify shall be drawn from God, from Satan,
from our selves, from our brethren, First, from God, we have these two, our
relations unto him, our danger in offending of him.

First, our Relations unto him, he is our Father, our Sovereign, Christ Jesus
is our spiritual husband. Now a dutiful child declines not only disobedience,
but whatsoever has the color of it; an obedient, and loyal subject startles
at not only treason, but also whatsoever may occasion suspicion thereof: a
faithful and chaste wife abhorres not only adultery, but whatsoever may make
her husband justly jealous, others but suspicious of her chastity. And shall
not every child of God, every one that professes subjection unto heaven, be
fearful of the appearance of disobedience, and undutifulnesse to so indulgent
a father as God, of the appearance of Treason and Rebellion against so Almighty
a King as God? Does it not befit the Spouse the Church, every member of Christ
to dread all shows, and signs of disloyalty, and unfaithfulness to so
loving a Spouse as Christ Jesus? Did Julius Caesar, but an earthly potentate,
think it not enough that his wife was without a fault, unless withal she was
without so much as the suspicion of a fault? And will not Christ (think you?)
who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, expect as great unblameablenesse in
his Spouse? Plutarch.
(...) Lesbiai to dissuade Pompey from flying into Parthia, tells him, that his
wife would be liable to a great deal of danger amongst those barbarous people;
and though (said he) they proffer no villainy unto her, yet it is an undecent
thing to think that the wife of Pompey might have been dishonored: To
dissuade us from the appearances and occasions of sin it should, (me thinks) be
an effectual argument, that our souls, which are married unto Christ in
righteousness, judgment, and holiness, will hereby be obnoxious unto danger
of pollution. What though they be not actually defiled? Yet it is an undecent
thing to think, that the Spouse a member of Christ might have been dishonored,
might have been foild with a lust, ravished, varquished by Satan, defiled with
sin.

If from these appearances of evil, our relations to God cannot draw us, yet
(me thinks) in the second place, our danger in offending of him, should drive
us: for he is a consuming fire unto, as the Works, so also the workers of
impiety: and how can we then but be afraid to venture on not only that we know
does, but what we fear others suspect may, deserve the wrath of so sin
revenging a God?

That we should abstain from all appearances of evil, may, secondly, be
gathered from Satan, from the consideration, First, of his cruelty and malice
against us, Secondly, of his temptations of us?

First, from the consideration of his cruelty and malice against us, which the
Scripture shadoweth out by terming him, the enemy by way of excellency, the
envious man, the accuser, the tempter, the destroyer, the devourer, a murderer
from the beginning: as also by comparing him unto a roaring Lion, unto a great
red Dragon, and an old (...).

Now me thinks we should fear to come, not only under the power, but also into
the sight of such an adversary: and yet by rushing upon the shows, the
occasions of evil, what do we but hazard the surprizall of our souls by him?

This will be more apparent from the consideration,

2. Of Satan's temptations of us: of his temptations of us to sin, of his
temptations of us to despair, or at least discomfort, for sin: because in
both sorts of temptations he goes about by these appearances of evil, to wreak
his malice upon us.

For first, in his temptations of us to sin, they are, first, the bait by
which he allures: Secondly, an argument by which he persuades us thereunto.
Thirdly, an encouragement, whereby he is heartned to persist in tempting of us.

First then, the appearances of sin, are a bait whereby Satan allures us
unto sin, which if we bite at, our consciences will soon be enlarged to
swallow sin it self. Satan well knowing that Gods Children would even (...)
at your gross, and more hideous sins, such as are, Idolatry, Adultery,
Drunkenness, and the like, therefore chiefly plyeth them with enticements to
the signs, shows, and occasions of them; for these will smooth the passage
unto the sins themselves. Of this we have a remarkable instance in Alipius,
who (as St Austin relates Confess. lib. 6. cap. 8) being drawn by his friends
importunity to accompany him unto the Roman Gladiatorie Games, yet resolves
though he were present with his body, to be absent in his heart, and for that
purpose to keep his eyes shut, that he might not defile them with so barbarous
a sight: yet at last upon a great shout, that the people gave at the fall of
one of the Combatants, his curiosity made him behold the occasion, and
thereupon he presently became an applausive spectator of that bloody and
inhumane spectacle. An Italian, as Holerius writes, by his often smelling to
the herb Basile, had a scorpion engendered in his head: even so we by our
often dallying, and tampering with things that carry a show of unlawfulness,
may have Satan, as I may so speak, even formed in us, for as St Hierome says
upon Ecclesiastes the ninth, Diabolus serpens est lubricus, cujus si capiti, id
est, primae suggestioni non resistitur, totus (...), dum non sentitur,
illabitur, that is, the Devil is a slippery serpent, and if we do not keep out
his head, that is, his first suggestions, it is not to be doubted but that he
will stealingly slide into the most secret corners of the heart: and so we
actuated by him, shall at last proceed from things only appearing (...), unto
the practice of most horrid and ghastly crimes.

Secondly, the appearance of evil is an argument by which he persuades us unto
what is in its own nature evil, for if a man have but slipped into such actions
as the best minded judge to have a real appearance of evil, Satan forthwith
will suggest unto him, that he has by this quite cracked his credit amongst
those that are accounted religious: by them (will he say) thou art as much
suspected, and as deeply censured for thy seeming evil, as for thy being so:
were thou not better therefore, be as thou seem, for they cannot think worse
of thee then they do, thy shame, and disgrace, their jealousies, suspicious
and censures cannot be greater for sin it self, than it is already for the
show of it. Now this temptation of Satan, receives great advantage from our
nature, for we naturally are addicted to society, and therefore if we find
that upon the signs and shows of such and such sins in our practice, good
men condemn us as guilty of the sins themselves, and therefore begin two
reserve and estrange themselves from us, refusing any longer to reach out unto
us the right hand of fellowship, why, then we will presently have fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness, and couple in with loose, carnal and
formal men, whose conversation will quickly infect us, so that it will not be
long e're we run with them to the same excess of riot.

And thus you see how Satan takes occasion from the appearance of sin, to
draw us on unto sin it self, which me thinks should be sufficient to
dissuade us from them. For is Satan so backward in tempting, or is his
invention grown so barren, as that our lives and practice must put arguments
into his mouth? is the purchase of hell and damnation so difficult, as that we
must needs furnish the Devil with baits to allure us, with reasons to persuade
us unto our everlasting perdition, this were folly and madness that would want
a name.

But in the third place, the signs and appearances of sin are not only a
bait, by which he enticeth us, an argument by which he persuades unto sin,
but withal an encouragement, by which he is heart'ned to go on in tempting of
us, for they make him gather heart, and hope that we are coming on to sin it
self; and this hope will breed diligence, make him a more importunate
solliciter, make him to double and strengthen his assaults, to plie us even
thick and threefold with temptations: A dog will not run from a man as long
as he throws bread unto him, and can any man suppose the Devil will fly, so
long as he gives place unto him, as long as he throws himself upon
temptations, by practicing such things as have a manisest show of evil? for
though in themselves they be never so small, yet will they serve to usher in
farther and greater matters: being then preparatives unto sin, they cannot be
(as some have imagined) good senses against sin: seeming to be evil is not,
cannot be a means to shield us from being so, no more then the opening the
Gates of a City can be the way to raise the seige of it, or letting go the
sluices of a river can be the course to stop its current.

You have seen arguments from Satan's temptations of us to sin: take next one
from his temptations of us to despair, or at least discomfort for sin, a
temptation of so hideous a nature, as that, me thinks, our actions should not
(...) it the least advantage. His First labor is by the appearance of sin to
make us offend God, but when he cannot proceed so far, his Second endeavor
will be, to make us disquiet our selves: when he cannot wound us by them, he
will vex us for them; for he will wrest and misconstrue all that we have done
unto the worst sense, he will swell motes into beams, mole-hils into
mountains, appearances of evil into realities, and thunder unto us that there
is not a pin to choose betwixt those and these; unto which our souls being
distracted by the violent importunity of this temptation, will be over apt to
give credence. And for a man to be thus tossed between Satan's powerful
suggestions, and his own fears and suspicions cannot but even crush his
spirits, and quite eclipse the peace and joy of his heart.

Abstinence from all appearances of evil is, thirdly, needful in regard of
our selves, for by them we may incur a double danger, a danger of being
infected with, a danger of being punished for sin.

First, a danger of being infected with sin: what Bern: tract. de grad. (...).
Bernard spoke of Eves beholding the forbidden fruit, is true concerning every
appearance of evil: Et si culpa non est, culpae (...) indicium est, and si
culpa non est, culpae tamen occasio est, indicium commissae, and causa est
committendae. Although it be not in it self a sin, yet it is a token, yet it
is an occasion of sin, a token that sin has been committed, a cause of
committing it for the future. Now our natures are strongly bent to evil, when
this (then) our natural inclination, is furthered by outward occasions, we may
soon be led to the realities of sin, though the occasions of themselves are
weak, they working but as objects, and the objective causality being of all
most imperfect, yet Satan is strong, our lusts are strong, these occasions are
suitable to our lusts: our souls therefore, by a little help from Satan will
quickly catch infection from them. For this reason were the Israelites, in the
time of the passover prohibited not only the eating, but the very having of
leavened bread in their houses. For this reason too were the Nazarites
forbidden to eat so much as the husks of the grapes, for if that had been
permitted, they would perhaps have soon proceeded to the eating of the grapes,
and thence to drinking of the wine it self: hence also grew that precise
resolution of David, Psalm. 101. 3. I will (...) no wicked thing before mine
(...): well may the world, and Devil set wicked things before mine eyes, but
for mine own part I will not invite temptations, I will set no wicked thing
before mine eyes, as much as I can I will decline the objects, examples, and
shows of wickedness: do but put fire unto flax, and it will presently be on
flame: so present we unto our loose and corrupt natures the shows, (which (as
you have seen) are also the occasions of evil) and how suddenly will they take
fire? This Joseph knew, and therefore when his Mistress solicited him to that
foul act of uncleanness, he harkned not unto her to lie by her, or so much as
to be with her, Genesis 39. 10. but fled, and got himself out of her presence,
ver. 12. doubting lest the very sight of her might kindle lust. Nay to the
shame of many secure and venturous Christians, of this even Scipio an Heathen,
and Soldier too, was apprehensive and fearesull, and therefore would not
suffer certain captive Virgins, though of an exquisite beauty, to be brought
so much as into his presence Ne quid (faith Florus) de virginitatis integritate
delibasse, saltem vel oculis vid rotur. That he might not seem to have sipt,
or skimmed the honor of their chastity, so much as with beholding them. As
Apelles then by drawing the picture of Campaspe fell in love with the pattern
of his work Campaspe her selse, so we from retaining, from affecting the show
of sin, will soon proceed to a delight in sin it self.

Some indeed are so strangely confident of their abhorrencie from sin, as
they doubt not infection from appearance of it: they can venture into the
loosest company, yet so bridle their appetite, as that they fear no excess;
be present at an Idolatrous Mass, and yet be in no danger of being affected
with it, unless it be with dislike of it.

Surely these men are dropped from Heaven, never borne in sin, or conceived in
iniquity: for they, whose original is from men, may possibly be drawn away by
sinful objects, and shows: but these men (forsooth) are above gunshot,
beyond the reach of temptation; Their professed hatred of sin brings me in
mind of Pigmalions averseness from women; he was a professed, almost a sworn
enemy to woman kind, yet drawing but the picture of a woman, he fell in love
with it, and he hugged, and kissed it so long, till at last by the power of Venus
(as the Poet fables it) it became a woman: Their case is like; they profess
detestation of sin, and yet delight in some things, that have the appearance,
the resemblance thereof: let them take heed they dote not so long upon these,
as that at length by the power of Satan, and the strength of their own lusts,
they be transformed into real sins. I will end this reason with that of
Chrysostom, in his fifteenth Homily unto the people of Antioch.

(...), etc.

(...).

It will be to (...) the occasion, or ground of greatest security. if we do not
only flee sins, but such indifferent things also, which are means whereby they
do supplant us: for as he who goes upon the edge of a steep, and craggy
rock, though he falls not, yet with fear trembles, and so falls through his
trembling, so he who leaves not sin a loofe, and a far off, but
approaches close to the brink of it, has just cause to live in fear, seeing
he has just cause to fear to fall into it.

Secondly, danger of being punished for sin, not by God, for he is an
Omniscient Judge, and therefore cannot mistake the appearance of evil for
evil it self: he is a just Judge, and therefore will not punish the
appearance of evil, for evil it self: but by man, by the (...) Magistrate
with temporal punishments, by the governors of the Church, with
Ecclesiastical censures, and by all men generally with shame and obloquie.
(...) you know in the apparel of Ahab, was like to have been killed for Ahab.
Plutarch.
(...) having on the Cloak, and armor of Pyrrhus, was slain for Pyrrhus:
even so many times some men, for the bare appearance of some crimes, are as
hardly thought of, and as severely handled, as if they had committed the crimes
themselves. Florus l. 3. c. 14.
Tiberius Gracchus was butchered by the Romans, because it seemed unto them,
that by touching his head with his hand, he had demanded a Diadem, when he
thereby as a sign only exhorted them to stand upon their defense. Because the
Island of Creete seemed to have favored Mithridates, for this seemings sake,
the people of Rome took revenge by the sword, Favisse Mithridati videbatur,
hoc placuit armis vindicare. Indeed the Lord sees not as man sees, he looks
on the heart, and thereunto squareth his judgment, but man looks on the
outward appearance, 1 Samuel 16. 7. and according to it censureth, and so he may
do, and yet often times judge righteous judgment. For if when there is wanting
sufficient evidence of fact, Judges, and Juries should not sometimes proceed
upon pregnant signs, and strong presumptions, howmany villainies would pass
unpunished? And if Ecclesiastical Governors, should not take the same course
too, how could they possibly stop the spreading mischeifs of scandal.

This abstinence from appearance of evil, is lastly expedient in regard of our
brethren, to avoid scandal unto them.

First, as it is taken by Thomas, and the Schoolmen, for that which
occasionally leads unto sin, which puts a stumbling block, or an occasion to
fall in the way of others, Romans 14. 13. for so do all evil shows, and that
both in the way of the weak, and in the way of the wicked.

First, in the way of the weak, for they are misguided, and drawn unto the
practice of that evil, the appearance whereof they see in us,

Secondly, in the way of the wicked, for first, hereby the obdurate are
heartened, confirmed, and comforted: secondly, hereupon adversaries take
occasion to speak reproachfully of that holy name, and profession which we
bear, to blaspbeme the Cross, Truth, and Gospel of Christ.

Secondly, as it is used vulgarly, and commonly for sorrow, grief, dislike, or
displeasure at an action, for it matters not much whether our facts be evil,
or bear show of evil, they equally would wound the hearts, and vex the
righteous spirits of the Godly, and therefore are both violations of Saint
Paul's precepts, Romans 15. 2. Let every one of us please his neighbor for his
good to edification. Valerius Publicola (says Florus) ne specie arcis
offenderet, eminentes aedes suas in plana submisit: he levelled with the ground
his high and losty building, lest he should offend the people with the
appearance of a Cittadell: and wilt not thou throw aside a vanity, an
excrement, some idle if not monstrous fashion, rather than offend thy brother
(for whom Christ died) with the appearance of an evil? A (...) shame were it,
that popularity should prevail more with a Roman, than Charity with thee, who
art a Christian.

But some will be ready to object, that this doctrine is prejudicial to our
Christian liberty. For that reaches to the use of all things that are of an
indifferent nature, and such are these actions charged with the appearance of
evil, and therefore if you streighten us in the use of them, you injuriously
deprive us of that liberty which we have in Christ Jesus unto the use of all
indifferent things. For answer,

First, those actions, in which there is a real appearance of evil, are not
indifferent in their nature, but evil, and sinful, forbidden, first, by the
general prohibition of scandal, they are per se scandalous of themselves and
in their own nature, and therefore (...), for a per se ad de omni valet
argumentum: prohibited, secondly, by those precepts which are against those
evils of which they have a real appearance, because they are a step unto, and
occasion of them, whereas it is usually said that they are evil only in
appearance, this is not to be understood so as to exclude evil from them, but
to restrain the evil of them unto this particular: that they have a real
appearance of evil, the meaning is, they are evil in no regard but this, and
this regard, for the reasons abovesaid, is sufficient to denominate them evil:
they are allwaies temptations unto evil, so that there is allwaies committed
in them an active scandal. This was the opinion of the vulgar translater, who
translates, 1 (...). v. 22. ab omni specie (...) abstinete vos, abstain from
every evil appearance, this reading Cornelius a Lapide and other Popish
Expositors think equivalent with (...) translation abstain from all appearance
of (...), according to it then every appearance of evil is evil, if it be
real and not merely imaginary. Unto this let me add that of Suarez already
quoted, an action, says he, only evil in appearance transgresses some
virtue, though not per se primo, yet (...) consequenti connexione virtutum, by
reason of the mutual connection and commerce of one virtue with, and dependence
upon another.

But to come to, secondly, those indifferent actions in which there is only an
imaginary appearance of evil, two things are here to be answered.

First, however they be in thesi in their general nature indifferent, yet they
do in casu and in hypothesi become to be accidentally evil, because done
against Conscience, when they appear to be evil to our selves; against
charity, when they appear to be evil unto others: and then we are bound to
abstain from them, though notlege communi, yet lege particulari, by reason of
particular circumstances.

Secondly, Although our Christian liberty extends to the use of all things
indifferent, yet ought we in godly wisdom, and discretion to abridge our
selves of the outward exercise of this our liberty, whenever it is very
probable that it will become dangerous to our selves, or scandalous to others.
Ye have been called (...) liberty, only use not liberty for an occasion to the
flesh, but by love serve one another, Gal. 5. 13. As free, and not using your
liberty for a cloak of malitiousnesse, the 1 Pet. 2. 16. Now we use or rather
abuse our liberty for an occasion to the flesh, for a cloak to malitiousnesse,
by practicing such indifferencies, as have show of evil; for they, (as I have
shown at large) are likely to prove, as occasions of sin unto our selves, so
also active scandalls to misguide our brethren, and therefore, though they be
not absolutely, and simply in their nature unlawful to be done, yet they are
by accident unlawful for me to do, as long as they carry show of evil. All
things (indeed) are pure ( says the Apostle) but it is evil for that man, who
eats with offense: It is good neither to (...) flesh, nor drink wine, nor
any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak, Romans
14. 20, 21. Infirmitas nominat promptitudinem ad scandalum, offensio autem
nominat indignationem, etc. scandalum autem importat ipsam impactionem ad
ruinam, Aquin. 2. 2 dae. q. 44 art. 1.


What remains then but that all be admonished in the Lord Jesus to take to
heart a matter so deeply concerning them, both in conscience as a duty expressly
enjoined by God, practiced by Christ, his Apostles, and Saints; and in
consequence, as befitting us as the Sons, subjects of God, as the spouse,
members of (...), as being needful to defeat Satan's malice, to cut off his
temptations unto sin, and unto discomfort for sin, to avoid sin, etc.
Application.
in our selves, scandals unto others, unto the weak, obstinate, and strong. If
therefore there be in you any love of God, any care to walk worthy of those
high relations you carry to him, any regard to the safety of your own souls,
any fear of Satan, sin, or punishment, any compassion over the Consciences
of your poor brethren, keep a loofe from whatsoever neighbors, and borders
upon sin, whatsoever has the blush and show thereof: hate, as Ambr. 1. 6.
Hexaem.
Ambrose exhorts, not only sin, but the coat of sin, the garment spotted
by the flesh. Even an heathen will advise, you hereunto. Quint. 1. 2. cap. 3.
Carendum (...) solum crimine turpitudinis, verum (...) (...).

Want we inducements, take we these three. It will be a course, First, Safe,
and Secure: Secondly, Comfortable: Thirdly, Honorable.

First, Safe, and Secure, by it sin and Satan shall be stav'd off, kept out
at daggers end, your own souls secured, kept out of gun shot either of
infection or punishment, so that they shall not come nigh, scarce so much as
the confines either of Sin, or Hell.

Secondly, Comfortable: For what an unspeakable comfort will it be unto thy
drooping soul in the hour of death, or in the time of spiritual desertion,
when thy Conscience can truly suggest, that thou have been so abhorrent from
sin, as that thou have shunned whatsoever has been homogeneall thereunto,
whatsoever has looked but like unto it, it must needs stop Satan's mouth, and
make thine own triumph in the calmnesse of a clear, and good conscience.

Thirdly, Honorable, for 'twill gain thee esteem amongst both good, and
badones, with those 'twill make thy name precious, twill muzzle the mouths of
these, when they behold such uprightness in thy life, as that thou shunnest
not only downright irreligiousnesse to God, injustice to men, but even their
very picture and resemblance, this cannot but extort from them, though never so
malicious, an ingenious acknowledgment, that thou art a true Israelite, a
sincere Nathaniel, in whom there is sound no guile. Now though our maine and
first endeavor must be to keep a good Conscience, yet is not the jewel or
precious ointment of a good name, to be in the mean while neglected; our care
should be to preserve that likewise unspotted, St Paul, ( Acts 24. 16.)
professes that he exercised himself to have always a conscience void of
offense, as toward God: so toward (...); and he advises us to provide things
honest in the sight of all men, Romans 12. 17. To walk honestly toward them
that are without. 1 (...). 4. 12. To strive for a good report of them that are
without, 1 Timothy 3. 7.

I will but prescribe two cautions directing how we are to abstain from the
appearance of evil, and then I shall have done with the general application
of the words. We are to abstain neither only nor chiefly from the appearance
of evil.

First, not only, that were foul Hypocrisy of which yet there are even a
generation guilty, who only combat with the shadow of sin, and in the mean
while embrace the body of sin real sins: who abstain from the show of
every evil worke' and yet remain reprobate to every good work, who
professedestation of gain by gaiming, because they conceive it to be an
appearance of theft, and yet make no conscience of fraud, deceit, and cousenage
in their dealings, who stand at (...) with all shows of uncleanesse, and yet
make no scruple of the grossest acts thereof.

Secondly, not (...), that were a great incongruity, for so care of the means
should be greater than that of the end, because abstinence from the appearance
of evil, is enjoined as a preservative against the evil it self. The evils
themselves therefore should cheifely be avoided, the body of sin should be
opposed more than the shadow, than the shows of sin. The flesh should be
abhorred in a higher degree, than the garment spotted therewith.

You have seen the point pressed generally as it concerns all men's abstinence
from the appearance of all evils. I will only crave your pardon to call more
particularly.

First, upon all (...) for abstinence from the appearance especially of some
evils.

Secondly, upon some men especially for abstinence from the appearance of all
evils, and then I will put a period to my meditations upon these words.

First, We must decline the shows of some evils above others, of our Master,
our bosom evils. For from them is most danger to be feared, they having
commonly most (...) from our natures: and Satan besides knows but too well how
our tide stands, he quickly acquaints himself with our predominant lusts, and
most raging corruptions, and unto them especially fits and accords his
temptations: as (...) Suetonius.
Agrippina, when she poisoned her husband Claudius, mixed the poison in the
meat which he most loved.

Secondly, some men above others are especially to decline the appearance of
all evils. All public men should do so, but especially we of the Ministry. The
high Priests and Nazarites, under the Law were not to come nigh a dead body,
Lev. 21. 11. Numb. 6. 6. And in imitation of them among the Romans, the Priest
might not touch the dead, nay they might not see the dead: for if a Priest
pronounced a Funeral Oration, 'twas not without a veil drawn betwixt him and
the Corpse. Nay a Flaminian Priest might not hear the sound of pipes used at
Funerals nor come into a place where there was a grave. Was theere such rituall
purity under the Law? such Ceremonial strictness in heathenish Priests? and
shall there not be found an answerable degree of moral preciseness in the
(...) of the Gospel? shall they be willingly within sight, sent, and hearing
of impiety, except to reprove it? (...) (...) (...) Psalm. 110.
As a woman big with Child, for fear, and danger of miscarrying for bears
Physic, violent exercise, and many meats and drinks, which otherwise she might
freely use: even so those who travel in birth with the Children of Christ, are
put to deny and abridg themselves of many indifferencies. I will eat no flesh,
says St Paul while the world stands, rather then make my brother to offend,
1 Cor, 8. 13.

Reasons enforcing their abstinence after an especial manner from the
appearance of evil are two: Because in them they (...): First, greater
looseness in bad ones: Secondly, more heaviness to good ones.

First, Greater looseness in bad ones. (...) it is how the lower, and more
ignorant rank of men will be hereby strengthened in their downright sinful
courses; Nay if a Minister do but wisely, and lawfully use his Christian
liberty the rude vulgar will thereupon open themselves a gappe unto all
licentiousness. If he be but innocently pleasant, think they we may be mad. If
he but sip, we may carouse. If he spend but some few hours, in his honest, and
harmless recreations, the common gamester presently concludes his mispense of
both time, and patrimony in gaming to be thence (...).

Secondly, more heaviness to good ones: it grieves the spirits of the
righteous to see them in any, it wounds their souls, it makes their bloods,
their hearts (...) to behold them in a man of God. It becomes not my weakness
to advise, only in mine own and others behalf, I unfainedly wish, and pray,
that this were seriously thought upon, and practiced by us all, that all of us
in a tender regard to the reputation, and honor of our high calling would
walk with great surcumspection, make strait steps unto our feet, tread every
step as nicely, as gingerly, as if we went among snares, walked upon ropes, or
pinnacles.

I will conclude with that of Bernard to (...), lib. 3. de consideratione, cap.
4. which though written particularly unto him, may yet fittingly enough be
applied to every Minister, nay every Christian. (...) (...) (...) malas res,
and malas pariter species (...), in altero conscientiae, in (...) (...) (...).
It becomes your holiness to decline as evil things, so also evil
appearances, in that thou consult'st for thy Conscience, in this for thy fame,
nay (indeed) if it be not presumption to add unto the Father, in this thou
providest both for Conscience, and Fame: for (...) first; for the purity, for
the peace of thy Consci nce; for the purity of thy Conscience, to keep it void
of offense both toward God, and toward men; for the (...) of thy Conscience,
to preserve it from the violence of Satan's temptations, from the vexations of
thine own fears, and jealousies, Secondly, for fame, so to hedge it in from
scandal, as that it shall be above the reach of suspicion. Therefore to go on
in the words of the Father. Puta tibi non licere, etsi alias fortasse liccat,
quicquid (...) (...), coloratum, non sit in sama naevus malae (...). Think not
for the lawful, though perhaps otherwise lawful, whatsoever shall be evil
colored: In thy fame let there not be so much as a spot of evil appearance,
so shall thou follow things, that are of good report, Phil. 4. 8. and thereby
quite take off all private prejudices, all open calumnies against either thy
person, or profession. However thou shall procure the testimony and approbation
of God, and thine own Conscience, and be presented unblameable, clear from
offensivenesse before men, from saultinesse before God, at the appearing of the
Lord Jesus Christ: To whom with the Father, and Holy Ghost, be ascribed by us,
and the whole Church, the Kingdom, the Power, and Glory, from this time forth
for evermore.

AMEN.

of that County.

OXFORD:

Printed by H. Hall, Printer to the University, for Tho: Robinson. 1660.

The Stationer to the Reader.
THe Theme here handled is very usual and common: But our Author, as I am
assured from very good hands, has done his best for the removal of this
prejudice; for first, his method is such, as, I am confident, will prevent all
nauseating: and then, he has inserted ever and anon out of the Schoolmen,
such Notions, as thou shall hardly meet with in any other Books upon this
subject: Besides, many obscure and difficult places of Scripture are here fully
explicated and cleared. This alone is enough to render this piece as
acceptable, as any other Works of the Author.

Romans 2. 16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
Christ according to my Gospel.
THere is some difference amongst Expositors about the Coherence of these
words: Beza fetches it from the 11th verse, making the 12, 13, 14, 15th verses
to come in by way of Parenthesis; there is no respect of persons with God, in
the day when God shall judge the (...) of men by Jesus Christ according to my
Gospel. Pareus amongst Protestants, and Estius amongst Papists draw it from
the 12th and 13th verses, and they enclose verse the 14th and the 15th in a
Parenthesis: for as many as have sinned without the Law, shall also perish
without the law: and as many as have sinned in the Law, shall be judged by the
law: for (...) the (...) of the Law are just before God, but the doers of (...)
law shall be justified, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by
Jesus Christ etc. But against both these ways the objection of (...) against.
Beza will serve: This verse cannot be well joined unto words so sarre off,
without great divulsion of the sentence, and suspending of the sense: and
therefore, with him, I shall look no further, for the (...) of the words, then
the foregoing verse, Which show the (...) of the Law written in their hearts,
their Conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while
accusing, or (...) (...) one another in the day, when God shall judge the
secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel. What the Apostle here
speaks of the Gentiles is applyable unto all men: the Consciences of all men
shall bear witness, and their thoughts either accuse, or excuse them in the
day, when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ etc. there will
then be a special. 1. (...). 2. Influence. 3. Evidence in the testimony of
Conscience, more then there is in this life.

First, A special Eminence; it is testimony will then be louder: that evil
Conscience, which does but now whisper, will then roar, and thunder: the peace
of a good Conscience here, in this life, passes all understanding: and that
joy, which is the result of it, is unspeakeable, and full of Glory: but
compared with those ravishing sweets, and Comforts with which the Conscience
shall be filled in the day of judgment, it bears not unto them half that
proportion, which a Cluster of grapes, cut down at the brook (...), had unto
the whole vintage of Canaan, Numb. 13.

Secondly, The influence of Conscience will then be greater, and (...), more
irresistible, and unobstructed then now; for now it may be silenced, or
out-noised by our louder pleasures; but then, nothing will be able, either to
stop or drown its voice; it will speak in as loud, and shrill an accent,
as the voice of the Arkeangel, and the trump of God: as these shall awaken the
dead out of their Coffins; so shall that raise in the memory of Reprobates
those sins, which their impenitency had buried in a grave of forgetfulness,
and put fresh life, and vigor into them, to torment, and terrify unto all
eternity.

Thirdly, In the day of judgment, there will be a clearer evidence in the
testimony of Conscience, then now: for now it is many times undiscerned by any,
but our selves: for what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of
man which is in him? 1 Cor. 2. 11. but then it will be made as legible, as if
it were written with the glorious beams of the Sun upon a wall of the purest
Crystal: in conformity hereunto it is, that some think, that there is an
Elipsis in the words, which they thus supply: their Conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts in the mean while accusing or else excusing one
another, as shall be manifested in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
men by Jesus Christ.

Estius quotes Stapulensis for another interpretation, to wit; that in the day
is as much as against the day: and why may not (...) be translated here against
the day, as well as verse the 5 th (...) against the day of wrath? and thus the
coherence will be fluent, and (...), and afford us this note: That Conscience
will bind over against the grand assizes of Jesus, that day wherein God will
Judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ etc. the tribunal of Conscience is a
prognostic, and representation of Christ's throne: it is verdict a presage, and
preoccupation of Christ's sentence, futuri judicii praejudicium, as Tertullian
phraseth it: what are the terrors of a bad Conscience, but slashes of Hell
fire? what are the triumphs, and Consolations of a good Conscience, but a
glimpse, and dawning of Heaven-happinesse? But I dwell too long upon the
Coherence.

In the words themselves we have three things considerable. First, A
prediction. 2ly, A Description. 3. A Confirmation of the last, and general
Judgment.

First, A prediction of it: shall Judge.

Secondly, A description of it: and that. 1. By its causes. 1. Principal, God
shall judge. 2. Isntrumental: by Jesus Christ.

Secondly, By its object, and that both personal, and real. 1. Personal:
men. 2. Real: secrets of men.

Thirdly: By an adjunct, the Circumstance of time when: in the day.

Lastly, we have the Confirmation of this prediction from a testimony of
undeniable authority, the testimony of the Gospel: according to my Gospel.

From the words I shall take occasion to handle the Common place of the last,
and general judgment, and it is a point that I shall briefly explain,
confirm, and apply.

(...), In the explication of it, I shall confine my self to the opening of
the text: the act of judgment is an aggregate action, containing many distinct,
and particular acts: some formally, and others by way of concomitancy: a
description of which you may see at large. Matthew. 25. verse. 31, 32, etc. usque
ad finem, 2 Thesal. 1 verse. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Jude 14. 15. Rev. 20. 11, 12, 13,
14, 15. here in the text it is set forth by its causes, object, and adjunct.

1. By its causes, principal, and isntrumental.

1. Principal, God shall Judge: God is taken in Scripture, either (...), or
personally.

1. Essentially: for the three persons in the Trinity: and so it may be taken
here; because the act of judicature is an outward work, and therefore common
unto them all. 2. Personally: for the first person, the Father: and the act of
judging may, in a special manner, be ascribed unto the Father, by that manner
of speaking, which the Schoolmen call appropriation: for hereby the Son, and
holy Ghost are not excluded, but only the order of the Fathers concurrency
shown: to wit, that being the fountain of the Trinity, he judges of himself,
by the Son, and Holy Ghost. But against this, that saying of our Savior, may
be objected John 5. 22. The Father Judges no man: but has committed all
judgment unto the Son.
Unto this there are usually given two answers.

1. The Father Judges no man separately, without the Son, but has
communicated all Judgment unto the Son non largiendo, sed generando, says
Ambrose, not by temporary donati n, but by eternal generation: but, if any
think, that to say, that Judgment is given, or committed unto the Son by
eternal generation is too harsh a Catachresis. 2. In a second place therefore,
(...) answer may be returned, to wit: that the Father Judges no man in that
manner, that he has committed all Judgment unto the Son: to wit, as (...), as
God man, as subsisting in the (...): he Judges no man in a visible, and
external manner: for thus judgment is ascribed unto the Son, not per
appropriationem, but per proprietatem.
2. Isntrumental, by Jesus Christ, to wit, as man and Mediator; for, as God,
he is a principal cause: but, the judiciary power conferred upon Christ's
manhood: though, in comparison of other creatures, it be a power singularis
(...) of singular, and transcendent excellency, unto which no creature can
have an equal power: yet, in respect of the judiciary power of his Godhead,
it is but a secundary, subordinate, and ministerial power, which he has by
delegation, and Commission: so that, as man, he is but a deputy Judge; the Father
has committed all Judgment unto the Son, John 5. 22. that Christ shall Judge,
in the humane nature, the Scripture is express: the Son of man shall come in
his Glory etc. Matthew. 25. 31. chap. 24. v. 30. He has appointed a day in which
he will Judge the world etc, by that man whom he has ordained etc. Acts 17. 31.
Every eye shall see him, and they also which (...) him, Rev. 1. 7. Even
Reprobates shall see him: but they cannot behold his Godhead; for the sight of
that would make them happy, and banish all sadness in his manhood; then it is,
that he shall be visible, and conspicuous unto them: but, though the Scripture
be thus clear, that Christ shall judge in his manhood: yet whether he shall
judge according to his manhood? is made a controversy betwixt the (...) and the
Scotists. Not so much for the state of the question it self, as for Aquinas
his proofs of it; the validity of which Scotus, according unto his usual
wont, questioneth and disputes against: the place of Scripture, that is chiefly
quoted for the affirmative, is John 5. 27. And has given him authority to
execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

Here Beza notes, that (...) because, is put for (...) or (...) as. (...)
says that the Authors of this interpretation, Heretics, render it infamous:
and he quotes in the margent Calvine and Beza upon the place: but their great,
and subtle Suarez [ in tertiam partem Thom: quaest. 59. artic. 2.] cites
Tertullian (...) (...) cap. 22. for the very same thing: and he takes notice of
it, as a thing very remarkable illud observatione dignum non legere quia sed
qua: but now ( as) is here to be taken not reduplicative; for then authority to
execute judgment would be essential to, and reciprocal with man: but
specisicative, so that it only determines the subject in which this derived
authority is seated: unto this purpose speaks Er juxta (...) expositionem,
illis verbis quia filius hominis est, non (...) causa adaequata, ex qua oriatur
potestas judicandi sic enim, ut argumentatur (...): (...) homines haberent
illam (...) sed (...) in (...) natura, quae necessaria fuit in Christo, ut
esset capax hujus donationis, and potestatis. Si enim tantum fuisset Deus non
(...) hanc potestatem (...) (...): (...) quia filius (...) est, fuit capax ejus
(...). in (...) pattem Thom. quaest. 59. at. 2.
Suarez in the place but now quoted: according to this exposition (says he) in
those words ( because he is the son of man) is not rendered the adequate cause,
whence this power of Judging arises, but that nature is designed, which was
necessary unto Christ, that he might be capable of the gift of this power; for,
as God, he could not receive this power anew; but, because he was the Son of
man, he was capable of it: but we may well stick unto our own translation, and
render (...) because, for the humane nature has not only a concomitancy with,
but also a causality in respect of the act of execution of judgment. But then
we must not abstract, and sever the humane nature from the grace of Head-ship,
and the grace of personal union; but Consider them (...) jointly.

This Aquinas hints, when he says [ par. 3. quaest. 59. art. 2.] that the
Father has given authority unto the Son to execute Judgment, because he is the
Son of man: (...) propter conditionem naturae; not merely because of the
condition of his nature; for then, as Chrysostom objects, all men should have
this authority: sed hoc pertinet ad gratiam capitis, quam Christus in humana
natura accepit: but this appertains to the grace of head-ship, which he
received in the humane nature: the words then may be thus glossed; he has
given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man,
because, as he is Mediator, King, and head of his Church, so also he is
qualified for discharge of this his office, by being not only God, but man in
one person, God-man: and it we take this way, the (...) (...) translated also,
will not be redundant, but emphatick: and Maldonate makes the Emphasis to stand
thus: the Father has not alone the power of judging, but he has transferred
it also upon the Son, because he is the Son of man, and so fitted for the
audible, and visible administration of judgment. Aquinas his reasons are by
Lib. 4. did. 46 quaest. 1.
Capreolus thus summed up: judgment agrees unto Christ, according unto that
nature, in regard of which, he has, as Mediator, Redeemer, and head of his
Church, a Lord-ship over men; but this Lord-ship agrees unto him, not only
according to his Godhead, but also according to his manhood: for to this
(...) Christ, both dyed, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of
the d ad, and living, Romans 14. 9. and therefore he shall judge according to his
manhood. Next follows the object of this judgment, and that is twosold,
personal, and real.

1. Personal, the persons to be judged, men; although men be here expressed
indefinitely: yet we may, by warrant of the Scriptures, add the universal
sign, and say; God will judge the secrets of all men, of all sorts, ranks, and
degrees of men; of all individuals of men: we shall all stand before the
judgment seat of Christ, Romans 14. 10. we must all appear before the judgment
seat of Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 10. Gorran has a Conceit, that, by the naming of
men, the evil angels are excluded, he shall judge the (...) of men, not
devils, says he; but, that the wicked angels shall come unto judgment also at
the last day, the scripture is very plain, know ye not that we shall judge
the Angels, 1 Cor. 6. 3. For if God spared not the Angels that sinned, but
cast them down to (...), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be
reserved unto judgment. 2 Pet. 2. 4. And the Angels which kept not their first
estate, but left their own habitation he has reserved in everlasting chains
under darkness unto the judgment of the great day, Jude 6. 2. Real, the
secrets of men: their secret state, election, and reprobation; their most
secrets actions, their chamber, their midnight, and closet sins, that have no
witnesses, but such whose partnership, in guilt will render silent, Eccles. 12.
14: 1 Cor. 4. 5. the most hidden, and darkest musings of the mind: those
purposes, desires, nay wouldings, and wishings of the will, unto which no vent
was given, either by language, or action: those passions of the heart, which
have been smothered from outward notice with the greatest care, and cunning:
nay those first motions, and inclinations unto sin, that were never consented
unto, which arise so thick in the soul, as that it is impossible, for the most
watchful Conscience, to take an exact survey of the most of them: and
therefore, may be deservedly ranked, amongst those errors, and secret faults of
which David speaks, Psalm. 19. 12. Who can understand his errors? cleanse (...)
me from secret faults.
Lastly, we have an adjunct, the circumstance of time, when this judgment shall
be, in the day; which is so called (says Gorran) propter (...) (...), because
then shall be a manifestation of all secret things: sometimes it is called
midnight, Matthew. 25. 6. propter improvisionem, because of the suddenness, and
unexpectedness of it: it is called the even, Matthew. 20. 8. propter sinem
temporis, because then shall be the final period of time; and it is styled the
morning (as he infers) from a mistranslation of the Latin Interpreter,
Zeph. 3. 5. propter initium aeternitatis, because 'twill be the beginning, and
as it were dawning of eternity: but these are but curious niceties, that have
no footing in the text; for, doubtless the day is here taken for time
indesinitely, as it is usually in many other places of Scripture Esa. 49. 8. 2
Cor. 6. 7. Luke 19. 42. Joh. 8. 56. So that there is no need to make any
inquiry touching that opinion of some Millenaries; that the day of judgment
shall last a thousand years; because it is the day of God, 2 Pet. 3. 12. and
with him a thousand years is as one day, verse. 8. and as little cause have we
to stay upon the examination of that in Aquinas [ Suppl. ad tertiam partem
quaest. 88. artis. 2.] where, because he thinks it impossible, that the
discussion, and sentencing of all the thoughts, words, and works of men should
be dispatched in the space of a day; therefore he concludes, that all things
shall then be transacted, not by vocal locution, but mentally in the minds,
and Consciences of men.

In the next place we have the Confirmation, or proof of this prediction of a
future judgment, from the testimony of the Gospel; according to my Gospel;
that is according to that doctrine which I have taught you in preaching the
Gospel: and this is a proof of unquestionable credit, not to be contradicted
by any, either humane, or Angelical testimony: if any man, (...) Angel from
Heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you, then that you have received, (...)
him be accursed, Gal. 1. 8, 9.

Here inquire we three things.

1. What is meant by Paul's Gospel? 2. How Paul terms it his Gospel? 3. In
what sense God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according unto the
Gospel of Paul?

First, What is meant by this Gospel of Paul? not any History of the birth,
life, and sufferings of our Savior written by Paul, as by Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John: but the doctrine of the Gospel, concerning Jesus Christ,
delivered unto them by Paul, either in writing, or else by word of mouth.

And hence we may note: that the last judgment is a branch of Evangelicall
doctrine: it was one of the chief points, that the Apostles had in their
Commission to publish: God commanded us (says Peter) to preach unto the
people, and to testify, that it is he, which was ordained of God to be the
Judge, both of quick, and dead, Acts 10. 42. Rolloc. Evangelium vocat
praedicationem illam judicii futuri, non quod ea sit proprie annunciatio
gratiae, sed quod ei inserviat, eique necessar. o permittenda sit, ut agnoscant
bomines miseriam suam, qui est primus ad salutem (...). loc:
thinks, that it belongs unto the Gospel only by way of subserviency, and
preparation: but I shall make no scruple to affirm, that it appertains
properly unto the Gospel, for it is a consummate act of Christ's regal
function, and that, not only in the perfect subduing of enemies, but also in
the full rewarding of his faithful subjects, unto whom therefore it will be
good, and acceptable tidings: neither is this impeached by its terror unto the
wicked: for this is only by accident, and so the sweetest, and most comfortable
points of the Gospel are unto them a savor of death unto death, 2 Cor. 2. 16,

A second inquiry is why the Gospel is styled Paul's Gospel? according unto my
Gospel, the same expression we find also, Romans 16. 25. 2 Timothy 6. 8.

For answer we must distinguish betwixt the authority: and the Ministry, or
dispensation of the Gospel. The Gospel is Gods and Christ's in regard of
authority: for it owes all its divine worth, and authority unto them: and
therefore is styled the Gospel of God, Romans 1. 1. the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ, 2 These. 1. 8. the Gospel, which was preached by me (says Paul) is not
after man; for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
the revelation of Jesus Christ, Gal. 1. 1, 1 2.

The Gospel then is termed Paul's, only in regard of Ministry and dispensation:
because Paul was a Minister, a dispensor, a Steward (amongst (...)) of the
mysteries it (...). 1 Cor. 4. 1 a dispensation of the Gospel (says he) is
committed to me, 1 Cor. 9, 17. (...) pray I (says Christ) for these alone, but
for them also, which believe on me through their word, Joh. 17. 20. where
Christ terms his own word, the word of his Disciples; because they were the
Ministers, and dispensers thereof. And for the same reason, the Gospelis termed
the report of the Prophets, and Apostles: who has believed our report, Esa.
53. 1. Thus the Gospel you see is Gods, (...), and Paul's: it is the Gospel of
God, and Christ, tanquam Authoris: it is the Gospel of Paul, tanquam
Praedicatoris.

The third and last inquiry is how, and in what sense, God shall judge the
secrets of men, according unto Paul's Gospel? according unto my Gospel.

This clause [according to my Gospel,] may be referrred, either unto [ Jesus
Christ] or else unto [ Judge].

If it (...) referti ad (...) (...). Provocat e im ad suum Evangellum non at
doceat secundom quid Deus sit judicaturus, sed per quem nempe media torem: id
quod non in lege, sed in Evangelio (...). Pareus in loc.
be referred unto Jesus Christ; then the Apostle, in referring them for
evidence unto his Gospel, does not teach them, so much, according unto what
rule God will judge: as by whom to wit, the Mediator: which is a point taught
and revealed, not in the law, but in the Gospel.

If we place this clause according unto my Gospel in order of sense and
construction after judge: then it may import one of these two things concerning
Gods future judgment of the world: either a conformity of it unto the Gospel:
or else the revelation of it by the Gospel.

1. A Conformity of it unto the Gospel: and so it signifies, that the
sentence, then to be denounced, is already set forth, and proclaimed in the
Gospel, from which the Judge shall not then vary: he that believes on the
Son has everlasting life, and he that believes not the Son shall not see
life, but the wrath of God abides on him, Joh. 3. 36. He that believes and is
baptized, shall be saved: but he that believes not, shall be damned, Mark 16.
16. This is the voice of the Gospel: and according to the tenor of this
Evangelicall decree, as I may say, shall God pronounce sentence at the last
day: to wit a sentence of absolution and benediction upon believers, and of
condemnation upon unbelievers.

But now, though all that have not believed in Christ Jesus shall that day be
condemned: yet those Pagans, unto whom Christ was never revealed, shall not be
condemned for their not believing in Christ: but for transgression of the Law
written in their heart: and the reason is, because the Obligation of any Law
necessarily presupposes promulgation thereof; and therefore those, unto whom
Christ is not preached, cannot be bound to believe in him. How can they be
condemned, for refusal of the Gospel, unto whom it was never offered? the
rule then, by which God will judge such, will be, not the Gospel, but the Law
of Nature.

And therefore in a second place I rather believe that [according to the
Gospell] signifies, the revelation of the judgment to come by the Gospel.
Dominus judicabit occulta hominum secundum Evangelium me um. Quomodo dicat
Apostolus Deum Judicaturum lecundum Evangelium: cum prius dixerit, reddicurum
unicuique secundum opera sua; Evangelium vero non est doctrina operum, sed
fidei?

Respons: In Explicatione ostendimus, particulam (...) non significare normam
judicii, ut prius, sed certitudinem: q. d. judicabit de occultis hominum, prout
docui vos in Evangelio. Quod si (...) de norma accipiatur, sententia non erit
incommoda, nam infideles quidem Condemnabit Deus ex operibus secundum; legem:
maledictus omnis qui non manserit in omnibus: sideles vero (...). olvet
secundum Evangelium: qui credit in silium Dei, habet vitam aeternam. Et tamen
his and illis reddet secundum opers, prout vel ex side, vel ex insidelitate
sluxerunt bona vel mala. Parcus dub. in loc.




God shall judge the secrets of men, by Jesus Christ according unto my Gospel:
that is, as verily and certainly, as I have foretold you of it in my Gospel: in
which sense the particle according is taken by our Savior; Matthew. 9. 29.
according unto your faith be it unto you, that is, let it be unto you, as ye
believe: Paul (least any one should think this his discourse of judgment to
come to be a fable or fiction) backs it with the authority of the Gospel: God
shall judge etc. according unto my Gospel, that is, as I have taught you in my
Gospel, in the preaching of which I was guided by a full, and infallible
spirit.

As for other scripturall proofs, besides the text, it is needless to urge
them unto those, that have read the Bible, for, there is hardly any argument,
wherein it is more plentiful: supposing therefore the (...) of the point to be
clear out of Scripture, I shall only point at some few Congruences, out of the
Schoolmen, why it should be so.

(...) ad iudicium generale quatuor congruentiae. Prima talis, quia (...) est
finaliler separati omnes malos ab omnibus bonis. Non enim malus communicate cum
bono; nisi vel ad hoc ut malus corrigatur, vel ut bonus per eam exerceatur,
secundum illud Aug. super. Psalm. nunc autem veniet finalls determinatio, ubi
nec ultra boni exerceantur, nec mall corrigantur. Ergo (...) est (...)
generalem sententiam: Ergo and generale judicium ut separatio illa generalis
appareat iusta.

Secunda Congruentia, quia in secretis iudiciis quae fiunt circa singulas
personas, licet sit iustitia, non tamen omnibus manifesta: rationabile est ergo
quod Deus habeat aliquod iudicium generale, in quo manifestetur sententia, vel
iustitia, quam exercuit in iudiciis particularibus. Tertia Congruentia, sicut
tes sunt a primo efficiente ita reducuntur in primum, ut in sinem: sed praetet
speciales exitus rerum a Deo per illam operationem, de qua dicit Salvator Joh.
5. Pater men's usque modo operatur, and ego operor. Fuit unus exitus Unversalis
in prima terum creatione: ergo a simili praeter singulares reductiones congruit
(...) unam finalem reductionem in finem suum, and per Consequens ad hoc, unam
finalem sententiam discretivam, quia mali non reducuntur.

Quarta and est melior, quia praeter hoc, quod unusquisque ascribatur regno vel
carceri tota multitudo praevisa ad regnum debet aliquando determinari ad
possidendum (...), and tota alia multitudo relinqui Carceri, ut sic
sequestratio duarum familiarum, seu duarum civitatum, sicut tractat August. per
totam de civi: Dei. licat ergo (...) nunc iste, nunc ille, ascribatur regno,
nunc iste nunc ille (...): tamen (...) est aliquod iudicium generale per quod
tota multitudo praevisa ad regnum, mittatur in possessionem regni, and tota
alia, relinquatur (...).


Scotus lib. 4. did. 47. assigns four Congruences why there should be a
general judgment.

The first Congruence is: because it is meet, that all the bad, and wicked
ones should be finally, and everlastingly separated from all the good: for one
purpose, whereto their outward Conjunction and Communion serves, is for the
exercise, and trial of the Godly. Now there shall come a time, wherein the
godly shall be no longer exercised, tried, or vexed with the unrighteous
Conversation of the ungodly: therefore there must be a final separation
between them; and Consequently a general judgment, that so the general
separation may appear to be just, wherein the wheat shall be no longer cumbred
with the grouth of tares amongst them.

A second Congruence; because the justice of Gods secret judgments of
particular persons is not manifest unto all: therefore it is reasonable, that
there should be a general judgment: wherein the justice of Gods sentence in
particular judgments shall be made manifest, and open to all the world.

A third Congruence is; because as things are from God, as their first
efficient, and author; so they are to be reduced, and as it were, brought back,
or returned again, unto God, as their last end. But now, besides the special
(...), or outgoings of things from God by that operation, of which our Savior
speaks; My Father works hitherto and I also work; there was one general
(...), or outgoing of all things from God, in the first Creation of things:
therefore (by an argument drawn a simili,) besides the singular and several
reductions of things unto God, it is Congruors that, of such as belong unto
God, there should be one final reduction unto God, as unto their end: and by
consequent there should be one final sentence distinguishing those, who belong
unto God by election, from the wicked, who shall never be reduced unto, but for
ever severed from Gods glorious presence.

The fourth and (says Scotus) the best Congruence is, because it is meet,
that, besides the private and several admittances of particular believers into
possession of the Kingdom of Heaven, there should be a public, joint, and
general admittance of all believers into inheritance of the Kingdom, which
was prepared for them before the foundation of the world. And, besides the
private, particular, and several condemnations of unbelievers unto the prison
of Hell, there should be one public and general condemnation of all
unbelievers unto perpetual abode in the said prison: that so there may be a
sequestration, as it were, of two families, or Cities, the household of God and
of faith, and the family, or brood of Satan.

Unto these Congruences of Scotus, I shall add this one thing more; that,
before the last judgment, Gods judgment of man is not complete, and consummate;
and this shall be cleared:

First, from the two essential parts of man, soul and body,

Secondly, from a twofold Consideration of the actions of men, as they are in
themselves, and as they are in regard of their effects, and men's opinions of
them.

Thirdly, from a twofold Consideration of man himself as he is a particular
private porson and as he is a part of the universe.

First, from the Consideration of the Cum non sola anima, sod homo integer
peccer, (...) been operetur, homo etiam integer judicari debet, and
convenientem paenam aut praemium in animo and corpore debita proportione
recipere. Suar. in 3 am partem Tho. 2. disp. 53 Sect. 1. p. 629.
two essential parts of man, soul, and body, for, in the particular judgment,
there is but one of these parts judged, the soul; therefore there is another
judgment to be looked for, which shall be a total judgment, a judgment of the
whole man, soul, and body: we must all appear before the judgment seat of
Christ, that every one may receive the thing done in his body, according to
that he has done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Cor. 5. 10. the body and soul
of the wicked have here in this life a joint and mutual Concurrence unto the
work of sin; and therefore Congruent, that in the next life, they be
associated in the punishment of sin, and be reciprocal tormentors one to
another. The members of their bodies are here instruments, or weapons of
unrighteousness; and therefore equitable, that hereafter they be subjects of
misery, and unhappiness: Meet is it, that those eyes should then be full of
anguish, which now are full of adultery; that that tongue should be then full
of deadly torments, which now is full of deadly poison: so on the other side
fit, that as the bodies of the Saints are isntrumental unto their souls in
Well-doing; so they should share with them in the reward of wel-being, and have
as much of their glory, and luster derived unto them, as they are capable of.
As here the members of their bodies are instruments of righteousness unto
God; so it is Congruent, that they should then be receptacles of glory, and
happinsse from God.

Secondly, from a twofold Consideration of men's actions: they may be
considered, (...), as they are in themselves; or Sciendum, quod licet per
mortem vita hominis temporalis terminetor secundum se, remanet tamen ex
futuris, secundum quid dependens. Uno quidem modo, secundum quod adhuc vivit in
memoriis hominum, in quibus quandoque contra veritatem remanei bonae famae vel
malae etc.

Alio modo quantum ad effectum Suorum operum sicut ex deceptlone (...) and
aliorum seductorum, postulat infidelitas usque ad finem mundi, and usque tune
proficit sides ex praedicatione Apostolorum etc. Omnia autem baec sub (...)
existimationi judicii divini. Et ideo de his omnibus perfectum and manifestum
judicium (...) non potest, quamdiu hujus (...) cursus durat. Et propter hoc
oportet esse finale judicium in novissimo die, inquo perfect id quoth ad
unumque^que hominem pertinet, quocunque modo, perfect and manifest judicetur,
Aqu. 3 a par. (...). qu. 59, Art. 5

Quia opera hominum alio modo manent post mottem eorum, vel in (...) (...),
and. sama, vel in effectibus suis qui varii, and multiplices esse solent: Ergo
licet Deus judicet actiones unius cuiusque hominis in morte ejus, considerando
illas secundum (...), id est, secundum id, quod vera sunt, oportet nihilominus,
ut de eis faciat publicum and universale iudicium in quo conster tam de ipsis
actionibus, quam de omnibus effectibus earum, and nocumentis, ac fructibus qui
ad alios ex eis redundarunt tum re ipsa, (...) etiam secundum aliorum
existimationem. Suarcz in 3 am partem Thom. Tom. 2. disp, 53. Sect. 1.


secondly, in regard of their fruits and effects, unto which we may annex
another consideration; in respect of the same, that goes of them, of the
judgment, opinion, and estimate, that men pass upon them.

First, we may look upon men's actions as they are in themselves: and so God
judges the actions of every man at his death, Heb. 9. 27.

Secondly we may Consider men's actions according to their effects, fruits,
issue or event, good, or bad: and so, however they are Physically transient,
and therefore can have no Physical operation after the death of their agents:
yet their moral influence, (to wit by way of motive,) may reach unto many
after ages: for unto that there is requisite only an objective existence in the
minds, and memoryes of men. Thus good books edify, and Erroneous and
heretical books pervert, and poison many thousands of years after the
Authors are dead, and rotten: the Preaching of the Prophets, and Apostles will
be fruitful, and effectual in the hearts and lives of men, as long as the
sun, and moon endure. How many are there, even to this day, wonderfully
affected with the Exampels, of Abraham's faith, Moses his meekness, Jobs
patience, Samuels justice, and uprghtnesse, David's repentance, and the like?
and so again, on the other side, the scandal of a lewd example may be
propogated unto many generations: Jeroboam made Israel to sin a long time
after his interrement as long as their was a face of a Church, or Commonwealth
in Israel: how long does a place groan under the effects of the ministry of
precedent Pastors, that have been, either lazy, and negligent, or ignorant, or
profane, or superstitious, or Erroneous? there must therefore be a time wherein
Christ shall pass public, and universal judgment upon, not only men's
actions considered in themselves; but also of all the fruits, and effects,
which have from their actions redounded unto others; and that, both in their
life, and after their death; that so the wicked may have a full measure of
wrath, according unto the full measure of their sins, considered in themselves;
and according to the full measure of their harmfull, scandalous, and mischivous
effects; and that the Godly may have a full and ample reward, as for their
faith, and good works in themselves, so for the happy fruits of them; for the
glory, that by them has accured unto God, and for the benefit, and
edification, that from them has arisen unto the Church.

Quamvis etc. estentiale praemium, vel poena conferatur in fine vitae, etc.
nihilominus tamen effectus postea subsequuti duabus ex causis conserre possunt
ad iudicium. Primo ad accidentarium praemium, vel poenam, ut iniqui omnium
actionum suarum structus intuentes magis consundantur: boni vero econtrario de
bonis (...) gaudeant. Secundo and maxim quia essectus sleudunt malitiam, vel
bonitatem operum, unde orti sunt, ut (...) illis omnibus propositis and
ponderatis evidentibus omnibus pateat aequitas divini iudicii, valde congruum
suit post consummaras et sinitas omnes actiones humanas hujus vitae, omnesque
effectus earum, sleri universale iudicium in quo omnia (...) perpendantur.
Suarez [ in tertiam partem. Tho. To: 2 dis. 53. (...). 1.] assigns two
reasons, or causes, why the effects of actions, after the death of their
agents, should conduce unto the universal judgment of them.

First, they contribute, if not unto the essential, yet unto the accidental
and accessory reward of the Godly, as also accidental and accessory punishment
of the wicked.

First, unto the accidental and accessory reward of the Godly; for, unto them,
it cannot but afford matter of unspeakable joy, and triumph, to behold the
blessed fruits of their exemplary faith, profession, obedience, patience,
labors for the public etc. in that by them they have (perhaps) won many a
soul unto God, Confirmed weaklings, Confounded adversaries, furthered any in
the way of salvation, in the building up of their souls, in either knowledge,
or holiness.

Secondly, they confer unto the accidental and accessory punishment of the
wicked; in that, they cannot but be amazed, and confounded, at the view of the
many dismal effects of their accursed sins as in others; so particularly, in
the wives of their bosoms, fruits of their loins, their dearest intimates: O!
what a cutting consideration will it be unto them, at the day of judgment, that
by their sins, as they have damned themselves, so also they have been the
guilty occasion of sin, and consequently of damnation unto others, who have
been seduced, and perverted by their Frrors, and heresies, or misguided, and
misled by their evil counsel, corrupt discourse, and advice, and scandalized
by their sinful example?

A second reason (assigned by Suarez) is: because effects show the
naughtiness, or goodness of the works, whence they spring, that therefore all
those things, being both propounded, and examined the equity of Gods judgment,
may more evidently be manifested, it is very meet, that, after all the actions,
and all the effects of the actions of all mankind in this life are once quite
consummated, there should be a universal judgment, in which all things may be
most exactly weighed.

Before Quanquam effectus (...) accidentarii, qui nec praevisi sunt nec
connexionem (...) (...) cum action (...), non augeant etc. praemium vel paenam
apud Deum: (...) illi (...) qui aliqua ratione sunt praevisi, vel quovis modo
coniuncti cum actionibus hominis, ita ut in eis tanquam in semine contenti
suerint augent praemium ac paenam etc. lapraed.
I leave this argument, I shall entreat you totake notice of Suarez his
limitation of it: who understands it, not of such effects, as are merely
accidental which cannot probably be foreseen, nor have any natural connection
with the actions themselves but of such effects, which are, or may be some way
or other foreseen, and are in some regard conjoined with the actions: so that
they are contained in them, as in a seed, or root.

With this Consideration of men's actions, in regard of their effects, we may
connex another, in regard of the fame that goes of them, of the judgment,
opinion, and estimate that men pass upon them: here men's actions are Ad (...)
etiam consert illa ratio sumpta (...) existimatione. Facile enim decipitur
(...) (...) vel malicia vel (...) (...). Quia ex iis, quae exterius apparent,
(...) unde fit, ut and bonorum sama saepe laedatur, and iniquorum malitia adeo
occultetur, ut boni and insti existimentur. Oportuit ergo ut in divino iudicio,
quod non est secundum carnem Joan. 8. nec secundum (...) (...), aut auditum
(...), Isa. 11. sed (...) omnium (...). 1. Reg. 16. (...), inquam in hoc (...)
singulorum iniurias (...) in (...) quadam (...), divinaque lance pensari, and
justice (...) restitui, iniquotum (...) (...), and versutiam detegi. Quare de
illis dicitur Sapient. 5. Stabunt (...) (...) magna (...) etc. De iis (...)
Videntes turbabuntur timore horribili, and infra. Dicentes, hi sont, quos (...)
aliquando in derisum, etc. Huc (...) spectant (...) illae, quibus Christus
utitur in Evangelio, quibus explicat bonos and malos in (...) (...) (...)
permixtos ita, ut vix discerni possint, sicut virgins fatuae, and (...):
oportuit ergo (...) discerni, and seperari, sicut (...) a zizaniis, and granum
a pallea, etc. Suarez in tertiam (...) Thom. Tom. 2. disp. 53. sect. 1. p. 629.
misjudged, misinterpreted, misconstrued; gross villainies are many times so
colored, and made so specious, as that they carry away a general applause:
and the most laudable actions meet with most disgraceful, and reproachful
aspersions. And as men's actions, so consequently men's persons are misjudged
two. The rankest, and grossest Hypocrites pass many a times for glorious
saints; and the best of Saints are reproached as the worst of men. Hannah was
censured for a drunkard; David for a traitor, (...) for the troubler of Israel;
Paul a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition amongst the Jews through out
all the world: there must there fore be a second, and universal judgment,
wherein all actions, and persons, that have been misjudged shall have righteous
judgment pass upon them; so that men's now shining sins shall their be
unmasked, and displaied in their proper colors; and on the Contrary, the
prosession of the power of Christianity, all pious aactions, which are now so
discountenanced, and despised shall then receive a public, not only
approbation, but reward, and that from God himself; and then for men's persons
God will put a difference between the wheat, and the chafe; the Corn, and the
tares; the empty formalist, that has only a form, a powerles show of
Godliness and the sincere Christian, that has the power of Godliness, the
vitals of religion, flaming in his heart, and life: then the Lord will (to
allude unto the words of Moses in another case) Numb. 16. 5. show who are his,
and who is holy, and will cause him to Come near unto him, (...) (...) whom
he has chosen, will he cause to Come near unto him.

Lastly, that Gods judgment of man is not complete, before the last judgment,
is to be manifested (...) a Dicendum quod quilibet homo, and est singularis
quaedam (...), and est pars totius generis (...) unde and duplex ei judicium
(...) (...) (...) de eo fiet post mortem, quando recipiet (...) ea quae in
corpore gessit, quamvis non (...), quia non quoad (...), (...) (...) (...)

(...) Consideration of man; to wit, as he is a private, and particular person;
and as he is a part of the Universe, that is whole mankind: this, by Suarez,

is thus cleared up; it is, not only necessary unto the manifestation of Gods
justice to Consider the sins of particular men secundum se, as they are in
themselves: but also in reference unto others, in order unto the government of
the whole world: in reference to that universal, and special providence,
which God has, both in respect of the whole Universe, and in respect of
particular men: and therefore God will not only judge privately particular men,
but he will also publicly judge the whole Universe, to wit of mankind, by way
of one entire politic body: all whose good, and evil actions shall be
brought unto a most severe trial: and that Considered according to all their
respects, and references whatsoever.

Hereupon it follows: that, although on Gods part this general gathering, or
assembly of all be not necessary unto him to pass judgment on every
particular person: yet in regard of men themselves it is after a sort necessary,
both for the public manifestation of Gods justice, as also that a certain
special kind of retribution, proceeding, either from public praise, and
honor, or else public shame, and confusion may have place: for this kind of
retribution necessarily results from such a manner of public, and universal
judgment, not from the private judgments of particular persons: judge nothing
before the time until the Lord Come, who will bring to light the hidden things
of darkness, and will make manifest the Counsels of the heart: and then shall
every man have praise of God; to wit public praise, and honor: and this also
is imported by the resemblance of the reward of the Godly at the last day unto
a prize, 1 Cor. 9. 24. unto a Crown, a Crown of righteousness, a Crown of
life, and a Crown of glory: for, however a prize, or a crown may be designed,
or allotted privately; yet it is usually bestowed publicly, in some great
assembly or concourse of people, seldom or never in a corner: and thus have
you seen, that, before the last judgment, Gods judgment is not consummate;
for, it is but a judgment of the soul: it is but a judgment of men's actions,
considered in themselves: it is but a judgment of men taken as private, and
particular persons: therefore there is another judgment, which shall he
complete, and perfect: a judgment both of bodies, and souls: a judgment, as of
men's actions in themselves, so of their fruits, and effects, and of men's
judgments, and opinions, that they pass upon them etc. a judgment of men, not
(...) as private particular persons, but as they are parts of the universe of
mankind.

Kings, and Lord of Lords is a forerunner: and, in Comparison of this, the most
tormentfull death of the body is but a flea-biting: for the hatred of an
infinite God, cannot but make a creature infinitely miserable: behold (says
Malachie) the day comes that shall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, yea,

branch, Mal. 4. 1.

Suppose the place be chiefly meant of the destruction of Jerusalem, shortly
upon the first coming of Christ; yet there is no doubt, but it may be applied
unto the execution of Christ's wrath upon the ungodly in the very day of
judgment: here, in this life they may be proud, (like the metals of iron, and
brass) stubborn, and inflexible; but, in that day, they shall be like stubble
before fire, before the fire of an Oven, where it burns more fiercely, and
furiously then in the open air: the consuming fire of Gods wrath shall then
utterly, and irrecoverably destroy all their comforts, and happiness: the day
that comes shall burn (...) up, it shall (...) them neither root nor branch.
The Doctrine of judgment to come made Felix, a corrupt Judge to tremble upon
the (...) though the Pulpit was the bar, and the preacher but a poor
prisoner, Paul in his bonds, Acts 24. 25. if the bare commination of this
judgment be so terrifying: what will the sense, and experience of it do? In
Rev. 6. 15, 16, 17. you shall find, that it will put the Kings of the earth,
the great men and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men
into such a desperate affrightment, as that, they shall be so foolish, as to
hide themselves in the dens, and the rocks of the mountains: as if it were
possible for them to run from omniscience, and withal they shall bewray so
impotent a passion, as to invocate the rocks and mountains to fall (...) them:
indeed to be crushed in pieces by them will be a more tolerable ruin, then the
frown, and wrath of the Lamb that (...) the Throne: it is strange there should
be such Lion like terror in a Lamb; but, though he be a Lamb in regard of
mildness unto his own, he will be the Lion of the Tribe of Judah unto his
adversaries; and he will be unto them so dreadful a Lion, as that they shall
be even forced to acknowledge the (...) of his wrath, and the unresistablenesse
of his power: they shall say the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall
be able to stand: indeed the greatness of their terror will be such, as that
it is undecipherable by the tongues of men, and Angels: but a guess we may
give at it (though ( alas!) very narrow and defective) by the terrors of some
condemned Malefactors. Before the Assizes, how full are their minds of boding
fears, and when it comes, how are these their fears heightened? every
circumstance, the grave, and severe aspect of the Judge, the aufulnesse of the
Bench, and the Judgment seat, the Sheriffs Halberts, the great throng of
spectators, and auditors, the rattling of their own irons will even distract and
amaze them; the trumpets, that are musical unto others, sound unto them a
doleful note; and are, as it were, a passing bell; but the dreadful sentence
of death strikes them dead, and kills them before their execution: as you may
see by their pale and bloudlesse cheeks, shaking hands, and trembling knees:
but when once they are dragged from the prison to the place of execution,
without hopes, either of pardon, or reprieve, then despair, the most terrible
of all passions possesses the place of fear, and sorrow, and the expressions
of it are so doleful, as that they (...) the pity of any humane breast: But
now, what is any terrene Judge compared with the Son, that has all judgment
committed to him, all power given to him in Heaven and in earth? how poor and
mean is the retinue of the most magnificent sheriff, in comparison of those
millions of Angels, that shall wait on Christ? how inglorious is any bench, in
respect of these Assessors, that shall sit with Christ in judgment, the myriads
of Saints each of which shall shine forth as the Sun, Matthew. 13. 43? how
dreadlesse, and contemptible is any tribunal, in comparison of Christ's
Throne? which Daniel 7. 16. is described to be like a fiery flame? what are
your trumpets, in comparison of that shout, the voice of the Ark-Angell, and
the trump of God? with which the Lord himself shall (...): from Heaven, 1
These. 4. 16. which shall shake Heaven and earth? these, all these particulars
together, with the thunder of that condemnatory sentence, and the sight of the
horrid executioners there of, the Devil, and his Angels, will beget such an
earthquake in their bosoms; that will be followed with such unspeakable
yellings, roarings, and howlings, as will express the greatest perturbation,
that an humane soul is capable of.

The day of judgment (you see) will be a black, and dismal day unto all the
ungodly, a day of darkness, and not light, Amos 5. 18. The horror of it will
receive no allay, or mitigation by the least degree, or drop of comfort.

But, there are two particulars in the text, that will aggravate the sadness,
and discomfort of the day unto unbelievers in the Church: and that far more
then unto mere Pagans, though professed worshippers of Devils: to wit,
consideration of. 1. The person by whom. 2. The rule by which they shall be
judged.

First, God will judge them by Jesus Christ: to accept of whom they have been
daily woed, and courted; and yet they have, with unspeakable contempt, refused
him: whereas there be Pagans, that never so much as heard of the name of
Christ, and therefore, it will be more tolerable for these in the day of
judgment then for those.

2. God will judge them according to the Gospel, which they have so vilified,
and despised: the Gospel cannot oblige those, unto whom it was never
published; and consequently they cannot be judged by the rule of the Gospel,
but now it has been daily sounded in the ears of loose, and profane
Christians: how shall they then escape (according to the Law of the Gospel)
damnation at that day? if they continue with a scornful obstinacy to neglect,
and reject that great Salvation, which is tendered them in the Gospel? and
that, with the greatest and most condescending importunity, that can be
imagined, Heb. 2. 3?

Secondly, Here is a use of Consolation unto all true believers: 2 Use, Of
Consolation.
for the great day Jude 6. will be unto them a good day: as good as it will be
great. The Psalmist, in a most Elegant Apostrophie, exhorts the inanimate,
dumb, and senseless creatures to bear a part with them in their exultations
and doxologies for the Lords coming to judgment: and, as it were, to
congratulate the bliss, and glory, which they shall then enjoy: Let the
Heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roar and the fullness
thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein, (...) shall all the
trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord, for he comes, for he comes to Judge
the earth: he shall Judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his
truth, Psalm. 96. 11, 12, 13. Make a joysull noise unto the Lord, all the earth:
make a loud (...), and rejoice, and (...) praise: Sing unto the Lord with the
harp: with (...) harp and the voice of a Psalm: with trumpets and sound of
(...): make a joy full noise before the Lord, the King. Let the sea roar and
the fullness thereof: the world and they that dwell therein. Let the slouds
clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together before the Lord, for he
(...) to Judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and (...)
people with equity, Psalm. 98, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

But to instance in some particulars, against which the expectation of the day
of judgment may comfort the members of Christ: and they shall be their sins,
their afflictions, and their death.

First, It may comfort them against their sins: against. 1. The guilt. 2. The
being and pollution of them.

1. Against the guilt of their sins: for God will Judge them by Jesus Christ,
their Savior, their Redeemer, their Head, their Husband, their elder Brother,
who will spare them, as a man spares his Son, that serves him, Mal. 3. 17.
Christ calls his Disciples his Friends, Ioh. 15. 15. and therefore he cannot
be unto them a rigid, and inexorable Judge; for exuit personam judicis (says
the Orator) quisquis amici induit, he that assumes the person of a friend, puts
off the person of a Judge. He that shall then judge of their sins, is now an
Advocate against their sins: and his Advocation is in the right of his
satisfaction: he intercedes for the pardon of those sins, that he has
satisfied Gods Justice for unto the uttermost farthing: if any man sin? we
have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the
propitiation for our sins, 1 Ioh. 2. 1. 2. Christ will appear the second time
without sin unto them that look for him, Heb. 9. 28. And they are only such as
believe in him: his appearing the second time will be the consummation of his
discharge, from all the sins of believers imputed, to him at his first
appearing: and if he, their surety, be discharged from them, impossible that
they should be condemned for them: and therefore Peter promises unto them,
that at that time their sins shall be blotted out, Acts 3. 19 that is at least
declaratively: the pardon of all their sins shall then be proclaimed in the
hearing of all the world: and they shall then also receive the full fruit of
their pardon, a consummate deliverance from all the consequents of sin, in
their bodies, as well as their souls.

Secondly, against the being and pollution of their sins, for then Christ
will appear without sin considered mystically, as well as personally: he will
present his Church to himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing, but it shall be holy and without blemish, Ephesians. 5. 27.

Here is comfort, secondly, unto believers against all their afflictions, of
what nature soever: rejoice, in as much as ye are made partakers of Christ's
sufferings: that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be be glad also with
exceeding joy, 1 Pet. 4. 13. here the Saints life of glory is hid with Christ
in God; hidden with great heaps of external misery: but when Christ who is
their life shall appear, then shall (...) also appear with him in glory,
Colos. 3. 3, 4. God will then be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all
them that believe, 2 These. 1. 10. Their glory shall be such, as that it shall
strike their scornful slighters with stupor, and astonishment: and shall
infinitely overbalance their greatest pressures, and lowest abasures: here is
but the seeds time of glory. Light is but sown for the righteous, and
gladness for the upright in heart, Psalm. 97. 11. and commonly they have a wet
seeds time too: they sow in tears Psalm. 126. 5. but in this day, they shall
reap a plentiful harvest of a most intense joy, in which there shall be no
allay, by the mixture of the least grief, for God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes, Rev. 21. 4. here their light is frequently interrupted, and
eclipsed: a child of light may walk in darkness and see no light, Esai. 50.
10. not so much as a glimpse of comfort: but then they shall enjoy a clear,
and a perpetual noone, that shall not be overcast, so much as with one cloud:
Gods Jewels may now lie in the dirt, and upon the dunghill, but that will be
the day when God will make up his (...) Mal. 3. 17. and then they shall shine
oriently with unimaginable luster: those that are, as David, men after Gods own
heart, may have their good names buried in a deeper and filthier grave then any
in (...) valley, Ezekiel. 37. (a throat of calumny deservedly entitled by the
Psalmist an open sepulcher, Psalm. 5. 9.) but God will give their reputations,
as well as their bodies, a resurrection: he will bring their innocence to
light, and make their righteousness clearer then the (...)-day, Psalm. 37. 6.
Though Gods people have lien amongst the Pots, Psalm. 68. 13. though they be so
vile and miserable, as that, in this world, they are in no better a condition,
then poor scullion boys, that stink with grease, and are blacked all over
with smoke, and soote; yet in the resurrection they shall be as the wings of a
dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold, that is, they
shall glister, as the beautiful wings of a Dove; that are of a silver and
golden color: the day of Judgment is termed by Peter, times of refreshing,
tempor a refrigerii, times of cooling, and the hope of this may support against
even a siery trial, 1 (...). 4. 12. In ver. 21. of the same chapter it is
entitled the day of restitution of all things: and this may digest the highest
outward losses; for there is nothing, that injustice, and tyranny can bereave
us of, but the glory of that day will make ample recompense for it, Matthew. 19.
29. In Romans 8. 19. it is styled the manifestation of the Sons of God: here Gods
sons are under a cloud, the world treates them like the worst of slaves: but
then their Sonship shall be manifested unto all, by Christ's public
invitation of them unto a full possession of their glorious inheritance, the
Kingdom prepared for them before the foundations of the world: here the silthy
conversation of the wicked will be, unto the just, a perpetual corrosive, and
vexation: but the day of Judgment will, for ever, deliver them from their
company: so that afterward they shall never hear so much as an idle word,
never see so much as a sinful act, or a scandalous object: the Son of man
shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his Kingdom all
things that offend, and them which do iniquity, Matthew. 13. 41.

Thirdly, and lastly, the day of Judgment may cheer against even the terrors
of death it self; and, in pursuit of this branch of the use, I shall only
mind you of two appellations given unto the day of Judgment in Scripture.

First, In Matthew. 19. 28. as some point the words, it is termed by our Savior
(...) the regeneration; it will then be, as it were, a new birth day unto the
bodies of the Saints; the earth will then prove a teeming mother, and bring
them forth in a new, and glorious state.

Secondly, The Apostle Paul calls it the day of redemption, Ephesians. 4. 30. to wit
from death, and all its consequents, that debase the body, all the corruption,
and dishonor of the grave: unto all them, that belong truly unto Christ we may
apply those his words. Luke 21. 28. Look up and lift up your heads, for the
day of your redemption draws nigh.

Thirdly, we may hence be exhorted unto an expectation of, and (...) Uses of
Exhottation (...), an expectation of, and preparation for the day of Judgment.

preparation for this day.

1. Expectation of it: for this is that, which will infallibly seal up unto
our souls all the ineffable comforts of this day: unto (...) that look for
Christ shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation, Heb. 9.
28. Here we have a double (...) of Christ's second appearing; (...) cujus, and
(...) cui.

1. Finis Cujus, the end for which he shall appear the second (...): [ unto
salvation.] 2. Finis Cui, the end unto whom; unto them that look for him: The
(...)
word is a double Compound of two prepositions (...), and (...), and a verb
(...): the word then implies a desirous, and hopeful expectation of that,
which is apprehended as good; so that, from the words, we may gather, that
Christ will bring salvation unto all those, that look, and long for his second
appearing, as a desirable thing: there is laid up a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give unto them that love his
appearing, 2 Timothy 4. 8. That love it with a love of desire: now if those
prisoners, whom their own heinous misdeeds, and the law have marked out for
condemnation, cannot desire the approach of the Assizes, and the coming of the
judge; how is it possible, that the revelation of the Lord Jesus from Heaven
with his mighty Angels in flaming fire should be desired by those, that (...)
(...) God, and obey (...) the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, seeing then he
will take vengeance on them, and they shall be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 2
These. 1. 7, 8, 9. the Apostle, (in his description of those, that wait for
(...) Adoption, to wit, the redemption of their bodies, (...). 8. 23) gives two
characters of them. 1. They have in general all sanctifying and saving graces;
they have the first fruits of the spirit, and these are a pawn unto them of
their future fullness of both grace, and glory. 2. In particular, they have the
grace of repentance, or humiliation; they groan under the burden of sin
within themselves: that is (as (...) glosseth it) ex imo cord from the bottom
of their hearts: our selves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit,
even we our selves groan withim our selves waiting for the adoption, to wit,
the redemption of our bodies. By this description then, there are excluded from
being waiters for the sull manifestation, and effect of Adoption

1. In general, all unsanctified persons, that are destitute of even the first
degree of regeneration: and so their souls are part of the suburbs of Hell, as
being replenished with the initials thereof, reigning, and unmortified sins.

2. Particularly, all unrepentant, and unhumbled sinners, that do not groan to
be disburthened of sin, as feeling it no load unto their spirits. In Gal. 5. 5.
Paul professes, in the name of all believers of the Jews, that their waiting
for the hope of righteousness had two causes, the spirit, and faith: we
through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith: and what he
says of believers of the Circumcision is appliable unto those of the
uncircumcision also; therefore unspirituall, and carnal persons, that are not
governed by the spirit, that do not walk in the spirit: and unbelievers, that
are destitute of a justifying faith, that uniteth with Christ, and transformeth
the heart, can never, whilst such, attain a due expectancy of that day,
wherein there will be a full revelation, and fruition of the hope of
righteousness, that is eternal life, which now is only an object of hope: In
Phil. 3. 20. you shall find, that those, who look from Heaven for the Lord
Jesus Christ, as a Savior, are such, whose conversation is already in Heaven;
the thoughts of their minds, and the affections of their hearts are in Heaven;
their aims, and desires are Heavenward; their actions savor of Heaven:
whereas, on the contrary, they, that mind earthly things, verse. 19. who have
their hearts, as it were, nailed, and glued unto the earth, would not have so
much as a thought of Heaven, if they could be secure from Hell; but would be
very well contented to have their perpetual abode on the face of the earth,
and would be very loath to be disturbed by Christ's coming from Heaven: for
their utter aversation from things heavenly sufficiently instructs them, that
thence they have no reason to look for Christ to come, as a merciful Savior:
for what good, what salvation may they expect, from a place, they have so much
contemned? The Thessalonians waiting for the Son of God srom Heaven, 1 These. 1.
10 has, for its antecedents a true Conversion from Idolatry, unto the worship
and service of God, verse. 9. as also an inchoation of rescue from Hell: they
turned to God from Idols, to serve the living, and true God, they were
delivered from the wrath to come: and indeed it was an act altogether
unperformable by them, as long as they were unconverted: as long as they were,
either Idolaters, or Atheists, as long as they were children of wrath, in whose
souls deliverance from wrath to come was not so much as begun; the Kingdom of
sin, and Satan remaining in them still, as entire, powerful, and unbroken as
ever. Compare 12, 13. of Titus 2. together, and you may easily collect, that
those, who look for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
God, are such as deny ungodliness, and wordly lusts: such as live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world, St (...) joyneth looking for, and
hastening unto the coming of the day of God with a most intense, zealous, and
transcendent diligence in all holy conversation and Godliness, 2 (...). 3. 11,
12. in the Lords prayer the petition, for the coming of Gods Kingdom, is
placed betwixt the two petitions Hollowed be thy name. Thy will be done in
(...) as it is in Heaven; and from this method we may observe, that none can
pray cordially for the coming of Gods Kingdom of Glory, when Christ shall
deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, that are careless of the
glory of Gods name, and regardlesse of obedience unto his will.

I shall conclude this particular with Rev. 22. 17. where desire of, and prayer
for the coming ofChrist to judgment, for a perfect vindication of all his from
all the sequels ofsin, is appropriated unto: he Bride, unto the Church
mystical, and unto every true, and genuine member thereof, every sincere
believer, that is betrothed unto Christ in righteousness, in judgment, in
loving-kindnesse, and in mercies, Hos. 2. 19. And the spirit and the Bride say,
Come. In the words (...) thinks there may be an Hendiadys: so that, the spirit,
and the bride may be put for the spiritual Bride, the bride sanctified by the
Spirit: or, if you rather think, that the Spirit is taken properly for the
Holy Ghost; why then, says he, the spirit says come, in the same sense, that
it makes intercession for us, Romans 8. 26. to wit, (...); it enableth, and
makes the bride to say come; the Spirit and the Bride say come: that is, the
Spirit in the Bride, or the Bride by the assistance, influence, and actuation
of the Spirit, says come: Come Lord Jesus, come quickly: those, that are
espoused unto Christ, long for the Consummation of their Nuptials, and their
marriage with the Lamb is this great and last day, Rev. 19. 7. 9. Whereas now,
on the Contrary, such as have gone a whoring after the creature, and have been
wedded unto the mortal adversaries of Christ Jesus their lusts, and
corruptions: their desire is to build Tabernacles on earth; and they stand in
as great a terror of Christ's coming, as the disloyal Adulteress does of the
coming home of her abused Husband; for their guilty consciences cannot but
assure them, that, without repentance, this day will not be their wedding day,
but a day of eternal divorce: their outward, and visible be trothment unto
Christ, by receiving of his Sacraments, and profession of his name, will then
be proclaimed to be a mere nullity, and they shall be everlastingly separated
from all communion with him: this day then will be unto them, as ( Job says)
the morning is unto murderers, Thieves, and Adulterers, as the shadow of
death: they will be in the terrors of the shaof death, Job. 24. 17.

Secondly, preparation for it: In the Parable, only the wise Virgins A second
Exhortation unto preparation for the day of judgment.
were ready for the coming of the Bridegroom: and hereupon they went with him
into the marriage, and the (...) (to wit of grace and mercy) was shut against
the (...) unprepared virgins, and could not be opened by their greatest
importunity, Matthew. 25. 10, 11, 12. the Apostle Peter connexeth this
preparation for the coming of Christ in both his Epistles with expectancy of
it. (...), in his first Epistle chap. 1. v. 13. Wherefore gird up the loins of
your minds, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought
unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ: where girding up the loins of the
mind is a (...) expression of that preparation, which is requisite in all
those, that hope to the end, for the grace, that is to be brought unto them, at
the revelation of Jesus Christ, in allusion unto an ancient custom, of those
Eastern Countries, where, not only women, but men, wearing long garments, were
wont to tuck them up, when they addressed themselves unto a journey, unto
work, unto battle, or unto service: our Savior uses the very same
similitude unto the same purpose; and joyneth another of the like nature with
it, Luke 12. 35. Let your (...) be girded about, and your lights burning, the
whole verse is a borrowed speech from the guise of good Servants, that prepare
for the coming of their Masters, by girding, and trussing up their garments, to
wait and attend on them, and by lighting candles in a readiness for them.

2. In his second Epistle chap. 3. v. 12. he makes the like connection: looking
for, and hasting unto the Coming of the day of God: Indeed we cannot accelerare
diem, but yet we may accelerare ad diem: though we cannot hasten it, yet we may
hasten unto it: to wit, by fitting our selves for it, by going forth, as it
were, to meet the Lord with burning lamps: that is with saiths, that not only
blaze before men, but also shine before God in their sruits, good works. This
preparation is of a vast extent, and takes in all duties, whether regarding
the first, or second table: so much may be gathered from the, 1 Pet. 1. 13, 14,
15. Wherefore gird up the loins of your minds etc. as obedient Children, and
not fashioning your selves according to the former lusts, in your ignorance,
but as he which has called you, is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
conversation. Here we have a Concomitant of this preparing of our selves, a
general obedience, and Universal holiness: and hence also is it, that
unpreparednesse is described by disobedience, Luke 12. 47. that Servant etc.
which prepared not himself, neither did according to his Masters will etc.

But now, out of those many duties, in which preparation for Out of those many
duties in which this preparation stands, some, (...) regarding either God, or
ourselves or others.
the day of Judgment stands, I shall select some few: unto the performance of
which the Scripture propounds the day of judgment as a motive: and they regard,
either God, or our selves, or others.

1. God and his Son Christ Jesus and says in him. 2. Repentance of our sins
against him. 3. Love. 4. Fear of him. 5. Prayer to him.

First, faith in him and his Son Christ Jesus: and unto the exercise Those
which regard God are.
of this faith there are two pressing arguments in the text. 1. Faith in him.


1. God shall Judge by (...) Christ: now of all graces, faith is that, which
primarily and principally ingratiates with Jesus Christ; for it unites us with
him, and renders us his beloved spouse, and members: and therefore, though it
cannot purchase or merit, yet it will infallibly procure his favor: so that,
unto every believing soul, he will, when he sits upon his Throne of glory, (as
(...) unto (...)) at it were hold out his golden Scepter. 2. God shall (...) by
(...) Christ according to the Gospel, according to the Covenant of grace; and
the condition thereof is faith: a believer then, has the fidelity, the
promises, the oath, the Sacraments of God engaged for his absolution; but now,
on the contrary, unbelievers shall be judged according to a Covenant of works,
and the severity of such a trial, even as David deprecates: Enter not into
judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified,
Psalm. 14. 3. 2. That is, do not try me by thy law, for so wide is the
perfection thereof, as that I fall infinitely short of it; and therefore can
expect therefrom nothing but condemnation: sordet in conspectu judicis, quod
(...) in (...) operantis: those performances, which most glitter in my own, and
other men's eyes, will be found filthy, if the pure eyes of the Judge measure
them by the rigor of the Law.
But to pass on unto other Scriptures, 2 Pet. 3. 14. (...) beloved, seeing
that you look for such things, be diligent, that you may be found of him in
peace (to wit) with God: and this peace is an inseparable consequent of faith;
being justified by faith, we have peace with God etc. Romans 5. 1. 1 Ioh 2. 28.
And now, little children abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have
(...), and not be ashamed before him at his coming. Now it is by faith, that we
have our abode in Christ: and therefore faith gives an undaunted boldness to
stand in judgment before Christ: Whereas, on the contrary, those, that die in
final unbelief, will hang down their heads, and be even confounded, as not
being able to look the Judge in the face with any confidence, whose tenders of
life, and mercy they obstinately and contemptuously refused unto the very last
gasp: The Guest, that is without a wedding garment, will in the day of
judgment be speechles Matt. 22. 12. This wedding garment is the robes of
Christ's righteousness: and what puts these on but says? without faith then
our guilt will strike us dumb Ioh. 3. 18. He that believes not is condemned
already, as by the Law, and Gospel, so by the verdict of his guilty, and
accusing Conscience, when ever it awakens; now if our unbelief be so gross,
as that our own Consciences cannot but condemn us for is, how can we expect,
that our Omniscient Judge should acquit us? if (...) hearts condemn us, God is

Secondly, we may hence be exhorted to repentance of our sins against 2. (...)
of our sins against him.
him; The times of this ignorance God winked at, but now (...) all men every
where to repent, because he has (...) a day in the which he will judge the
world in righteousness, by that man whom he has ordained etc. Acts 17. 30, 31.

This place has some obscurity, and therefore I shall stay a while upon the
opening of it; the particle, but; plainly shows, that here is an Antithesis,
or opposition betwixt two (...) of (...) and Gods dispensation in them. 1. Here
are times of Ignorance at which God wincked; times before the general
publication of the Gospel. 2. The present times of the Gospel, But he
commands all men every where to repent; from this Antithesis or opposition it
naturally follows, that in the times before the general promulgation of the
Gospel, times of ignorance, God did not Command all men every where to repent;
he winked at them, he suffered the Gentiles to lie in their Idolatries without
so much as any admonition.

Against this, it may easily be foreseen, that it may be Objected; that all
men, even before the times of the Gospel, had the law of nature written in
their hearts, and that Commands repentance, by that then God, even before the
times of the Gospel, commanded all men every where to repent.

Unto this I find those following Answers.

1. Though all men, since the fall of Adam, were obliged by the natural law
unto repentance; yet not by any positive command, and revelation superadded
unto the law of nature [and this Answer I have in the Author of that learned
Manuscript, unto which Mr John Goodwin pretends to give a reply in his Pagans
(...) and dowry] the generality of the Gentiles, before the resurrection of
Christ, had no other preachers of Repentance, but the light of nature, and the
book of the creature; but now God, by the Ministers of the Gospel, command,
all men every where (that is where the Gospel is revealed) to repent.

A (...) Answer is; that the denial of the generality of the Command to
repent, in the times of ignorance, before the Gospel, is to be understood only
in a comparative sense; so that the import of the Antithesis is: God now
commands all men every where to repent more clearly, fully, distinctly, and
expressly, then in those times of ignorance before Christ: and this way
Mounsieur (...) praeterita (...) ignorantiae tem pora vocat (...) ad praesenth:
non quod Deus gentes nullo planesuae vel irae, vel bonitatis documento, ad
resipiscentia minvitasset, sed quod (...), quam nunc, obscurius atque (...)
vocasset; quod scilicet ad gentes, quos nunc (...) verbi praecones, nullos
antehac misisset. (...) Apol. par. 3. p. 384. 1.
Dally, and others of that party take: The Command then, to repent, was given
unto all men allwaies, for the substance and matter of it: and is new only
(...) the manner of it.

Unto which I may add for a third answer: that it is also new in regard of the
inforcement of it by a new motive, the last, and general judgment of men, by
Jesus Christ: which was not revealed, generally unto the Heathens, before the
Gospel times: indeed the light of nature might dictate unto them the
congruence, and probability of a second, and universal judgment: and this
might be ground enough for the Poets fictions, touching the three Judges of
Hell-Minos, Aeacus, and Rhadamanthus: but though the light of nature, and
reason be never so improoved, yet as Scotus well observes [ lib. 4. did. 47.
quaest. 1. n. 5.] it can never make any demonstration of the certainty thereof:
and he gives this reason: because it is a matter less known unto reason, then
the resurrection, and this is a thing we can only prove by the revelation of
Scripture. God then now commands all men in all nations, unto which the
Gospel is published, to expect by a more pregnant, and (...) motive, then ever
the Gentiles in their times of ignorance heard of; to wit; because he has
appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in (...), by that man,
whom he has ordained, etc.

Unto these answers I shall add one of mine own, which I hope will be
satisfactory: Repentance may be considered under a twofold notion: sub ratione
officii, and sub ratione medii: as a duty, and as a means or way unto
salvation.

1. Sub ratione officii, as a duty: and so the law of nature commanded it
always, unto all, that had the actual use of reason: for what is Repentance,
but a returning from sin unto God? Now this the law of nature enjoyneth: for it
obliges to love God with all your soul, heart, might, and strength: and
impossible, that this should be done by those, that do not turn from their
sins, and return unto God. 2. Repentance may be considered sub (...) medii, as
a means, or way unto Salvation: and so the Gospel only declares, that all men,
unto whom it is preached, should repent; for the Law is so rigorous, and
inexorable, as that it admits not of Repentance in order to life, and
salvation: Cursed is every (...), that continues not in all things, which are
written in the (...) of the Law to do them, Gal. 3. 10. Indeed the Law may
press our obligation unto repentance, and discover its opposite to be a
damnable sin: but it is only the Gospel, the Covenant of grace, that
propounds it as an anteccdent condition of salvation, and promises the reward
of eternal life, and happiness unto it. And thus I have done my best to
explain this dark assertion: that God (...) Commands all men every where to
repent, which before he did not.
But the Confirmation of it ( (...) he has appointed a day (...) the which he
will judge the world in righteousness by that man, whom he has ordained etc.)
is as obscure as the assertion it self: for this decree, or appointment of
judging the world by Christ, was from all eternity; and therefore no Congruent
proof, that God in, and since the fulness of time propoundes it unto all men,
every where, as of avayle unto everlasting Salvation,

For the clearing of this we must take a rule, that is usual in the
interpretation of Scripture: Many things are said in scripture to be done, when
they are only manifested to be done: And so here the appointment of the day in
which God will judge the world is put for the manifestation (...). The words
then may be thus Paraphrased: God, by the preaching of the Gospel, has
revealed and manifested, that there shall be a day, in which he will judge the
world in righteousness; by that man, whom he has ordained etc. And that this
is a competent argument, to provoke men unto Repentance, is evident from the
manner of Gods procedure; in this day he will judge men according to their
repentance, or unrepentance, he will acquit all true penitents, and Condemn
all (...) impenitents: (...) ye therefore and be converted (says Peter) that
your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come, from the
(...) of the Lord, Acts 3. 19. without Repentance all our sins, our sins of
baro, and naked omission, Matthew. 25. 42. 43. Our idle words Matthew. 12. 32. that
have no obliquity in them, but (...) (and what is said of idle words is
appliable unto idle thoughts and works) shall all be fully charged upon our
souls: those, who are not, by the (...) of God, led unto repentance, after
their (...), and impenitent (...), treasure up unto themselves wrath against
the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, Romans 2. 5.
they pile up plagues, Curses, and Torments: the day of judgment is termed the
day (...) wrath, in opposition unto (...) time of this life, which alone is the
(...) of grace, and mercy: Behold (...) is the accepted time, behold now is the
day of salvation, 2 Cor. 6. 2. and therefore repent, now if ever, for in the
day of wrath there will be no place, or time for, no acceptance of repentance,
though sought with never so many, and bitter tears.

Repentance implies. 1. Examination, Consession of, and sorrow for past sins.
2. Caution and resolution against future sins. And unto all these the day of
judgment persuades.

First, Unto Examination, (...) of, and sorrow for past sins: a voluntary
selfe-inspection will avoid the severe scrutinie of that day: to Confess unto
an earthly Judge is a speedy and an assured way unto Condemnation; but, with
our Heavenly Judge, it secures our pardon; I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and
mine iniquity have I not hid: I said, I will (...) my transgressions unto the
Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Psalm. 32. 5. qui (...) vult
peccata, detegat. is (...) rule; the way to have our sins covered in this, and
the next life, is to uncover them in this before God in an humble, and (...)
Confession; and without this God will discover them to the knowledge of all the
world unto our Confusion in the day when he will judge the (...) of (...) by
Jesus Christ etc. if now we would accuse our selves, it would then stop all the
accusations of the Law, Satan, and our own Consciences; if we would now judge
our selves we should not then be judged, if we would now privately, in our own
bosoms, arraigne and Condemn our selves for our sins, and lie prostrate at
the feet of Christ for mercy, we may be certain, that we shall publicly be
acquitted by proclamation in the great Assizes of the whole world, wh n Christ
shall Come with Clouds, it is said that all kindreds of the earth shall wail
because of him. Rev. 1. 7. Many think, that this is meant of the obstinate,
and incorrigible enemies of Christ Jesus, and that the wailing here spoken of
is (...) (...) a wailing of hellish desperation, to prevent which no such way
as Planctus (...), the wayling of Evangelicall repentance and contrition: and
is it not infinitely better to mourn, weep, sigh, and sob for sin here, then
hereafter to roar, houle and yell for it unto all eternity? Behold the Lord
comes with ten thousands of his Saints to execute judgment upon all, and
convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which
they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches, which ungodly
sinners have spoken against him, Jude 14. 15. The conviction here spoken of
has, for its end, the unrepealeable condemnation, and irremediles confusion of
the parties convicted: The Lord will execute judgment upon all the ungodly whom
he convinces of ungodly deeds, and hard speeches against him: but yet now even
the most ungodly may escape this conviction by a timely, internal,
penitential conviction of conscience in this life, which, as an Echo,
answers the spirits convincing the world of sin, Joh. 16. 8, 9. Now those,
whom the spirit convinces of sin, it convinces also of righteousness, verse.
10. this Conviction then has a tendency toward the conversion and salvation
of the soul: for it is inseparably followed with the judging, executing, and
crucifying of our sins: that our spirits may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus: Gods threatening of the wicked, Psalm. 50. 21. to reproove them, and to
set their sins in order before their eyes, is by many applied unto the day of
judgment: And Modo ergo tu fac quisquis (...), quod (...) (...) (...) (...)
Deus, (...) a (...) (...) by te videre non vis dissimulans a fact is tuis, and
constitue te ante te ascend tribunal mentis tuae, esto tibi judex, torqueat te
timor, erumpat a te confessio, and dic (...) tuo, Quoniam (...) meam ego
cognosco, and delictum (...) ante me est (...). Quod erat post te, fiat ante
te, ne tu ipse postea a Deo judice (...) ante te, et non sit quo fugias a te.
Austine upon the words advises us to do unto our selves here, that which God
threatens to do unto us hereafter: to put our sins before us, that now we
have forgotten, and cast behind our backs, to ascend the tribunal of our own
Consciences, and there to act the part of judges against our selves: to
arraigne, condemn our selves, and by the exercise, of a filial fear, Godly
sorrow, and penitent confession to do as it were execution upon our selves: to
say, as the Psalmist in the following Psalm v. 3. I acknowledge my
transgression, and my sin is ever (...) me: Conformably hereunto I find, that
Mellerus, and other Interpreters think, that the next verse is an exhortation
to repentance: Consider this ye that forget God, least I (...) you in (...),
and (...) be none to (...): Words of Knowledge (in Scripture) imply affection,
and action: Consider this, to wit, that God will in the day of judgment
reproove you, and set your sins in order before your eyes: Consider it
affectionately, Consider it (...): Consider it so as to endeavor to prevent
it, and for that there is no such way, as to imitate the Process, that God
here threatens, to reproove our selves, to set our sins in order before our
own eyes, to tear our hearts in pieces, to rend our hearts by Evangelicall
Contrition, and, if we do thus our Judge that otherwise would condemn us,
will deliver us from every evil work. 2 Timothy: 4. 18. from the condemning guilt
of (...) (...) (...), and consequently from the wrath to come. 1 These. 1. 10.
Wherefore ( (...)) (...) you look for such things (as shall be in the coming
of the day of God, the dissolution of the Heavens by fire, the melting of the
Elements with fervent heat, the Creation of a new Heaven, and a new earth,
wherein dwells righteousness) be diligent, that you may be found of him
without spot and (...). 2 Pet. 3. 12, 13, 14. Now the unspottednesse, and
blamelesnesse of sanctification stands in a total exemption from the
sovereign dominion of sin, and this is utterly inconsistent with impenitency,
for sin we daily contract new spots and stains, and they have a throne in
those souls, where they are not washed and rinsed with penitent tears; though
Christ's blood only cleanses from the guilt of sin with the cleansing of
Justification; yet, repentance cleanses too from the spot, and pollution of
sin with the cleansing of Mortification, and, if we are not here cleansed with
this latter cleansing from the filthiness of sin, Christ will not in the day
of his coming openly discharge from the guiltiness of sin.

Secondly, We may, from the day of judgment, be exhorted unto Caution and
resolution against all sin for the future; against acknowledged sins, and
against suspected sins.

First, against such sins as are acknowledged to be such: the very possibility
of obnoxiousnesse unto Judges here on earth makes men afraid to displease them:
how dare we then, day after day by our multiplied sins, to grieve, and incense
the Judge of all mankind, out of whose mouth must proceed a sentence that will
everlastingly either save, or condemn us? I have often heard of purses cut,
even at the Assizes, in the place of justice; but sure no cutpurse can be so
audacious, as to play such a pranck, when he sees the judge look upon him: Is
it not then very strange, that we should make no scruple of committing sins of
a very high, and heinous nature, when as yet we know, that all the sins we can
commit are naked, and open unto the Omniscient Judge of quick, and dead? can we
expect to be associated with Saints, and Angels in the Train of Christ, and in
the mean while live like incarnate Devils? can we hope for the honor of
Saints to be attendents unto the Judge, and abhor holiness, that denominates
us to be Saints? If we be like goats here, in this life unruly, and unclean:
why should we think to have the honorable place of sheep, at the last day,
upon the right hand of Christ? Christ will then reject, and banish from his
presence, not only forward Professors, but even able and diligent Preachers,
Prophets, nay such as have been renowned for miracles, if they be such as do
not endeavor abstinence from sin; but are so addicted unto iniquity, as that
they make it their trade, and business to commit it: Many will say unto me in
that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have
cast out Devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then I will
(...) unto them, I (...) (...) you, depart from me ye that work iniquity,
Matthew. 7. 22, 23. The Apostle Peter, prophesying (...) such, as (in the last
days) should scoff at all the predictions of Gods word concerning the last
judgment, saying (...) is the (...) (...) his coming, lays down this
description of them: that they shall be men walking after their own lusts;
knowing this that there shall come, in the last days, Scoffers walking after
their own lusts, saying; where is the promise of his coming, 2 Pet. 3. 3, 4.

Those that walk after their own lusts, that are acted, in the constant
course, and way of their lives, by their (...) lusts, are (in the
interpretation of God) Mockers at the Doctrine of the day of judgment, (...),
such as shall make childrens play of it: [for the simple verb, (...)
signifies properly to play as a child, (...)] the same Apostle, having (in his
first Epistle Ch: 4. v. 4.) spoken of the Gentiles running into an excess of
riot, and of their wondering at, and complaining of the Convert Jews dispersed
among them, for not complying with them, presently. v. 5. he mentions the
Account, that they shall pass at the last day: The Gentiles think it strange,
that (...) run (...) with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of
you, who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the
dead. From these words, it appears plainly, that a due, and serious
consideration of the account, that we must give unto him, that is ready to
judge the quick, and the dead, is a strong bridle to restrain from the sins of
the Gentiles here taxed, (...). 3. 4. as also from all other sins whatsoever.
Solomon makes use of it, to retrench the Exorbitancies of a youthful
voluptuary, Eccl. 11. 9. here we have an Ironicall Concession, and a dreadful
(...).

1. An Ironicall (...) Rejoice, O, young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart
cheer (...) in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart,
and in the sight of (...) eyes: as if he should have said; pursue thy (...)
pleasures without check, or stop; and abridge not thy self of any thing, that
thy heart desires or delights in; but to show, that this is but a Sarcasme,
he presently brings in a dreadsull commination of judgment, as a cooling card
to (...) the the rage, and fury of his lusts: But know that for all these
things God will bring thee to judgment. For all these things: that is, for all
thy excesses, for all thy intemperate courses, for all thy Epicurisme and
Sensuality; God will bring thee unto Judgment: thou may perhaps be unwilling
to come to a trial; but God will compel thee, and the Ministers of his
justice will dragge thee unto his Tribunal.

This, in its own nature, is an apt and forcible dissuasive as unto all men
from all sin, so especially unto those, that are in the Magistrary, or in any
office apperteining to justice, from those sins; that are opposed unto the
duties of there respective places: Dr Heyling Geog.
Asterion in Tenedos is memorable, for an old custom observed amongst them,
which was, that at the back of the Judge there always stood a man with an axe
advanced, as well to terrisie the witness from giving false evidence to the
Judge, as the Judge from pronouncing a false sentence upon the evidence:
(whence the Proverb (...) securis.) But this axe was but a (...)-crow, in
comparison of a deep imprestion of the last judgment, one would think, that it
should deter even a Judge, that is not very zealous for justice, from the
perverting of judgment, and resusall to do justice; and make him return this,
or the like answer unto all temptations unto unjustice, How shall I commit this
great wickedness and sin against the Judge of all Judges? What then shall I
do, when God (...) up? and when he visits, what shall I answer him? Job: 31.
14. And why should not this meditation have the like influence upon all organs
of Justice, from the highest unto the lowest, from the Sheriff unto his
Bailiffs? why should it not affright all Plantiffs, from unjust contentious,
and frivolous actions? all Accusers, and Informers from suggesting? all
Witnesses from deposing any untruth? all Jurors from (...), and partiality in
their verdicts, and presentiments? all Lawyers from coloring, and palliating
bad causes, and persons? from betraying or delaying the causes of their poor
Clients? Would all these but sadly Consider, that a day will come when all
their actions, and proceedings at this time shall be revewed and reexamined;
how (...) might it make them against all failings, and practices, that turn
judgment into (...), into gall, and the fruit of (...) into (...)? Amos. 5. 7,
and. 6. 12. that is, that turn public Judicatories into places of bitter,
banefull, and deadly injustice unto the oppressed: for of all these their Judge
has a more perfect cognizance, then their own Consciences. The Prophet Amos
tells the great ones of Samaria, that they did put far away the evil day, and
caused (...) (...) of (...) to come near, Amos 6. 3. Although the evil day be
there meant primarily of the (...) of some particular judgment upon Israel: yet
it may be extended unto the day of general judgment, which will be unto the
wicked, in a way of eminency, the evil day, a day of sad, and (...) tidings:
Now if those, that have any employments in public dispensation, or
distribution of Justice, put far away from them all thoughts of this day,
they cause the seat of violence to come near: the (...) of justice should be a
sanctuary unto the distressed: but they, who dread not a day of accounts, turn
it into a seat of unjust and Tyranicall violence: and they are very hot, and
eager in the pursuit of their oppressive courses: they cause the seat of
violence to come near.

Secondly, The day of judgment should be a disswasive from even suspected sins;
from all things that have an appearance of evil: When Tunstall Bishop of
Durham told Mr Gilpin that he should have a dispensation for non-residence
during his travel beyond the (...); Mr Gilpin answered, that he feared (...)
he came to stand before Christ's Tribunal it would not serve his turn: and
indeed, whosoever will seriously weigh the matter, must needs confess; that,
in the general, we all have very good reason to stick, and scruple at those
things, which we doubt will be disallowed by the supreme, and Sovereign Judge
of all rational Creatures in this sublunary world: Me thinks then men should
be afraid to adventure upon those recreations, fashions, or the like,
concerning the lawfulness of which, they have not clear, full, and evident
satisfaction.

A third duty, regarding God unto which we may be exhorted 3. Love of him.
from the day of judgment, is love of God and Christ Jesus: for the sincere and
upright love of them will give admirable erection, and embolden against the
terrors of that day, 1 John 4. 17. Herein is our love made p rfect, that we may
have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this
world: Whereas, on the Contrary, how can they have boldness in the day of
judgment, whose hearts are here (...) with enmity against Jesus Christ, by
whom God will in that day judge the secrets of men? and God reckons all those,
to be mortal enemies unto him, who are cordial friends unto any sin: against
such what a thundering curse does Paul denounce. 1 Cor. 16. 22. If any man love
not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha: there be many learned
Expositors, that take the word to be an advise unto the third, and highest
degree of Excommunication, that answered unto the Jewish Shammata, an accursing
of a man, unto the coming of Christ, without hope of mercy, which cannot be
done without a Prophetical spirit.

But against this it may be objected: That the mere not loving of Christ is a
sin of the heart, and therefore comes not under Ecclesiastical Cognizance, and
censure.

Unto this Objection I find two answers.

The first, Of the learned and Reverend Doctor Hammond: that the not loving of
Christ is the denying of him in time of trouble, and signifies here him that
was taynted with the Error of the Gnostics, and so would not confess Christ
in time of persecution.

A second Is, that the not loving of Christ is the sin against the holy Ghost,
an opposition of Christ, and his Gospel, out of mere malice and desperate
hatred.

But to make either of these interpretations good we must fly unto a Meiosis
(whereby less is spoken, and more employed) and what need we run unto a figure,
as long as the words are capable of a fair interpretation in their proper
sense: I shall therefore conclude (with Cornelius Alapide, Dickson and others)
that the words contain only a simple denunciation of an eternal curse, and
damnation to be inflicted at the coming of the Lord to judgment, upon all that
love not the Lord Jesus: for Anathema is a Greek word, and signifies cursing
or banning; Maran-atha is a Syriack or Caldee word, importing that the Lord
comes: for Maran signifies Lord, or our Lord, and Atha comes: the words then
may be thus glossed; all impenitent haters of the Lord Jesus, all, in whom
there shall be found a final want of the love of the Lord Jesus, shall be
accursed by him when he comes to judgment: Now Christ will then interpret all
those to hate him, who, in their love of him, admit of any corrivalty: who love
any thing, any creature, any lust, either above him, or but in an equality, and
coordination with him: It is the general opinion of Expositors, that the
Apostle alludes unto the Prophecy of Enoch, mentioned by (...) verse. 14. 15.
And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam prophesied of these, saying, behold the
Lord comes with ten thousands of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all,
and to convinee all that are ungodly among (...), of all their ungodly deeds
which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches, which
ungodly sinners have spoken against him: And, if this conjecture be true, then
from the collation of these two places, 1 Cor. 16. 22. Jud. 14. 15. we may
gather this observation: That they love not the Lord Jesus Christ who are
ungodly, irreligious, and profane ((...), that is, without worship) who
neglect, and omit Gods both natural, and instituted worship; and such shall be
Anathema; when the Lord comes he will convince them, and execute judgment upon
them: of these ungodly persons there are two Characters in the text.

1. Ungodly (...) (that is sinful actions against the first Table) which (...)
have ungodly committed; and ungodly deeds are committed after an ungodly
manner, when they proceed from souls, in which there is no renewed principle,
no gracious habit, no seed of God, no divine nature to oppose, and resist them,
or to incline unto repentance for them.

A second part of their character is the hard speeches which they have spoken
against Christ; and those, whose tongues run riot against his Ordinances,
Ministers, Members, he accounts to utter hard speeches against himself; though
their thoughts, and expressions of his person, nature, and offices be all
orthodox.

Fourthly, this point may provoke unto a fear of God, and of 4. Fear of him.
Christ; not a distrustful, but an awful fear; that is opposed unto carnal
presumption, and security, and not unto the assurance of faith. How do men
dread those judges, whose severest doom reaches only unto (that which they
themselves cannot avoid) death of the body? and shall not we fear that Judge:
whose bare sentence is so operative, and efficacious, as that it is able to
destroy body and soul in Hell? If ye call on the Father (says Peter) who
without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the
time of your sojourning here in fear, 1 Pet. 1. 17. If ye call on the Father,
that is, if ye make profession, that God is your Father, nay if by the spirit
of Adoption ye be assured that he is your Father, yet fear him; for he that is
your Father now will be your Judge hereafter, and he will be an impartial
judge, he will judge without respect of persons; there will be no deceiving of
this Judge by bare words, naked professions, and pretensions: he will judge
according to every man's work: and besides we have but a short time unto this
general Assizes, it is but a time of sojourning, and, for all these reasons,
let us fear God: This fear, unto which the day of judgment should be a
forcible incentive, is of so large a compass, as that virtually it takes in
all duties whatsoever.

For first, in the Old Testament, the Preacher explicates it by universal
obedience, as its effect, Eccles. 12. 13, 14. Fear God, and keep his
Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man, for God shall bring every
work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it
be evil: Here the last judgment is used, as an argument, for the keeping of
Gods Commandments, a well as for his fear; and for this it is very home, and
pressing, for what can we expect, but that God should then be deaf, and
inexorable unto our prayers and cries for mercy, if we now stop our ears, and
hearts unto his calls, and exhortations of us unto obedience? the equitablenesse
of such a course God himself demonstrates, Prove. 1. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man
regarded: But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my
reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear
comes; when your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a
whirlewind; when distress, and anguish comes upon you: (...) shall they call
upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not
find me.

Secondly, in the New Testament, it has subjoined unto it an effect, of as
vast an extent, the glorisying of God; for unto that all other actions of
religion, together with those of justice, and Charity are related, as means,
Rev. 14. 7. The Angel that preached the everlasting Gospel etc. said with a
loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is
come. And unto the glorisying of God the coming of the hour of his Judgment is
a very apt and stirring motive, for we then look for glorisication by God: and
unto such an expectation, what can be more suitable, then a cordial endeavor
to promote the glorisying of God? what reason have we to hope then for the
fruition of his glory, if we be now regardlesse of the advancement of his
glory? If we do not here live unto God, Gal. 2. (...). it will be but
presumption to think that hereafter we shall live with God.

I shall conclude this use with Mal. 4. 2. which together with the first verse
may be applied unto the day of judgment: the particle [ But] denotes the
opposition betwixt the terror of that day unto the wicked, and the comfort, and
happiness of it unto those that fear God: But unto you that fear my name,
shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings, and ye
shall go forth, and grow up, as Calves of the Stall.

Unto you that fear my name; that fear (not only my justice and judgments,
but) my name, (every thing by which I reveal my self, my pardoning mercy,
Psalm. 130. v. 4: my goodness, Hos. 3. 5: those that tremble at my word, Isa.
66, 2: unto all such) shall the Son of righteousness arise (here they may
have a dark and a gloomy time, but then Christ as a Sun shall arise upon
them, and scatter the darkness as of sin error, and ignorance, so also of
misery and discomfort, he shall arise as a Son of righteousness their
righteousness shall be as visible unto all the world, as the rising of the Sun
is, he shall arise with healing in his wings (then shall there be a perfect
cure of all spiritual diseases whatsoever) and ye shall go sorth (to wit, in
the resurrection, out of the (...) of your graves) and grow up as Calves of the
stall (your glorified bodies shall be endued with vigor, and agility; they
shall leap and skip for joy like fatted Calves; and besides ye shall have a
full both conquest and triumph over all your adversaries, v. 3.) And ye shall
tread down the wicked: for they shall be as ashes under the soles of your
feet, in the day that I shall do this, says the Lord of Hosts.

Lastly, we may hence be exhorted unto zealous, and frequent prayers 5. Prayer
to him.
unto God, Luke 21. 36. The end of all things is at hand, therefore watch unto
prayer, 1 Pet. 4. 7: not only pray, but be watchful in prayer; men dare not
supplicate, in a sleepy posture, for their lives, that are forfeited unto the
justice of the Law; for dull, and drousy supplications bespeake a repulse
rather than an answer: shall not we then rouse up our selves, and stir up all
our abilities, when we are suitors for the unmerited salvation of our souls in
the day of the Lord Jesus? If petitions could prevail with Judges on earth,
how would they be even overwhelmed with them? now God has always an ear, and a
heart open unto prayers rightly qualified; and impossible he should be ever
cloyed with it; to be an Hearer of Prayer is one of his Titles, o thou that
hear prayer! says David, Psalm. 65. 2. And shall not this quicken us unto a
diligent frequency, and most raised fervency in prayer for prevention of the
Condemnatory sentence of the last day? He, that then shall be our Judge, is in
the mean while to be God's great and sole master of requests; and God will be
favorable unto every one, whom he intercedes for; and he will deny his
intercession unto none, that Cordially, and sincerely crave it: but yet how
seldom are our requests made known to God by him for favor? and how saint,
and unzealous are those requests? He, that the last day shall sit upon a
Tribunal of justice, now sits upon a Throne of grace and a mercy seat; and
yet how desolate and unfrequented is this Throne of grace, this mercy Seat (how
few, and cold are the petitioners that resort unto it? it is very strange; that
we should be so backward and remiss in our prayers here in this life, seeing
in the next, after death, and in the day of judgment, all prayers will be as as
bootlesse, as the vain cries of condemned prisoners for mercy unto the Judge:
though Christ be now an Advocate, that offers to plead for any Client who will
sue unto him in a due manner; yet then his Commission for Advocate expires, and
he is to enter upon the execution of the Commission of a Judge, and he is to
give righteous judgment without the least partiality.

Secondly, there be another sort of duties unto which the day of A second sort
of duties unto which the day of judgment excites that regard ourselves.
judgment excites, that concern our selves, and they are four. 1
Watchfulness. 2. Sobriety. 3. Diligence and faithsulnesse in our particular
callings. 4. A Diligent use, and faithful employment of all our Taleuts, etc.

First watchfulness; and that, over all our duties, and actions, against the
temptations of all our spiritual adversaries, Satan, the world, and our own
deceitful hearts: unto this watchfulness our 1. Watchfullnesse.
Savior and the Apostle press from the (...) and uncertainty of the day of
judgment; the certainty that it shall be; the uncertainty when it shall be,
Matthew. 24. 42, 43, 44. Mark, 13, 32. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. These. 5, 2, 3, 6.
Luke 21. v. 35. 36. That day shall come, as a snare on all them, that dwell on
the face of the whole (...): Watch ye therefore, etc. that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape all these things, that shall come to pass, and to stand
before the Son of man. The worthiness that our Savior speaks of is a
worthiness of fitness, not desert, and may be expounded by that of the
Apostle, Col. 1. 12. Made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints
in light: unwatchsull souls are unprepared for judgment, and consequently
unqualified for Heaven: When Epaminondas sound a (...) sleeping he ran him
through; The Lord has appointed every one to be a spiritual watchman, What I
say unto you, I say unto all, watch, Mark. 13. 37: and when the Captain of our
Salvation shall be walking his great round in the day of judgment, if he find
any securely sleeping, and snorting in sin, having their souls ungarded, and
the Gates of their hearts lying wide open unto the enemy, what can such expect
but the extremity of martial Law? indeed the wise Virgins may slumber and
sleep, Matthew. 25. 5: but it is only a slumber of insirmity; each of them may
say as the Church, Cant. 5, 2. I sleep but my heart waketh; that is my
regenerate part, the spirit striveth, and struggleth with the flesh to shake of
all drouzinesse; so that in regard of the constant bent of my heart I am
always vigilant.

A Second duty, regarding our selves, unto which by the Consideration 2.
Sobriety.
of the day of Judgment we may be stirred up, is sobriety: The Apostles Paul
and Peter join vigilance, and sobriety together; because sobriety is a great
help, and furtherance unto vigilance; and they propound the day of judgment to
enforce the practice of both, 1 These. 5. 2, 6. For your selves know perfectly,
the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night: Therefore let us not
sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober, 1 Pet. 4. 7. But the (...)
of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober and watch, etc. Nomen
sobrietatis sumitur a (...). (...) enim aliquis sobrius, quasi briam, i. e.
mensuram servans, and ideo illam materiam specialiter sibi sobrietas ascribit,
in qua maxim laudabile est mensuram servare. Hujusmodi autem est potus
inebriare valens, quia (...) usus mensuratus multum confert, and modicus
excessus multum laedit, quia impedit usum rationis, magis etiam quam excessus
cibi, etc. Et ideo specialiter sobrietas attenditur circa potum, non
quemcunque, sed eum, qui sua fumositate natus est caput conturbare. sicut
vinum, and omne quod in ebriare potest. Communiter autem sumendo nomen
sobrietatis, potest in quacunque materia dicl. 22(...). quast. 149. artic. 1.
cap.
Aquinas points at two acceptions of the word sobriety: one more strict, and
restrained; and thus taken it moderates the appetite in the use of drinks; the
other more large, and general; and according unto this it puts due bounds, and
limits unto our desires of, and endeavors after all things temporal; it keeps
in all things, that measure, which is requisite: the opposites of sobriety, in
each sense, are a virtuall denial of the day of judgment: not only, they that
are drunk with wine, and strong drink; but they that are intoxicated with
coveteousnesse, or any kind of Epicurisme, carry themselves, as if they thought
there were no day of general account: and hereupon our Savior, dehorting from
things, that expose unto the hazard of a sudden, and unexpected surprizall by
that day, coupleth in his said exhortation the cares of this life, with (...)
and drunkenness; And take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so
that day come upon you unawares: for as a snare shall it come on all them that
dwell on the face of the whole earth, Luke 21. 34, 35.

First, gross drunkenness extinguisheth, for the present, all thoughts of a
judgment to come; for a prisoner to reele drunk unto the bar, where he is to
be tried for his life, would argue a belluine contempt of his life, and throw a
strange and high scorn upon justice: though men habitually fear, and love God
above all, and prize their precious souls more than millions of worlds; yet
their act of drunkenness is a real, and interpretative slighting of the
allpowerfull Judge, of men and Angels, and a disvaluing of the pricelesse soul.

Secondly metaphorical drunkenness, drunkenness with prosperity, and riches,
with delights, disports and recreations, etc: argues an inadvertency, and
inconsideration of the last judgment: they, that are in this sense drunk, and
intemperate, show themselves to be careless of that, which merits the cheifty
of their care, and extremely sollicitous about that, which deserves the very
height of contempt: whatsoever their professions be, yet, the truth is, such
men make but little reckoning of their immortal souls; and the fear of the
great Judge of all the earth is not before their eyes: see how the Apostle Paul
backs his exhortation unto moderation with the near approach of the Lord to
judgment, Phil: 4. 5. Let your moderation be known unto all men, the Lord is
at hand: the moderation, that the Apostle calls for, extends unto all our
actions, and passions; and, that it concerns us very much to labor for such
moderation, he prooveth; because the Lord is at hand, to call all to a most
severe account, for all exorbitancies, all intemperatenesse, either of the
inward mind, or outward behavior: By the same reason he dehortes (in the
following words, verse. 6.) from an opposite of moderation, inordinate, or
immoderate care; The Lord is at hand, therefore be careful for nothing. This
clause, the Lord is at hand, stands in the middle betwixt the exhortation and
dehortation, and therefore may aptly be related as a motive unto both.

A Third duty, regarding our selves, is diligence and faithfulness in our
particular callings: our Savior himself, Mar. 13. 34, 35, 36, 3 Diligence in
our particurar callings.
37: backs his (...), of all Christians in general, and Ministers in
particular, unto vigilance in their respective Callings, with proposal of the
uncertainty of the day of Doom. 1. He shows how he has allotted every one
their work, verse. 34. For the Son of man is as a man taking a sarre journey,
who left his house, and gave authority to his Servants, and to every man his
work, and Commanded the Porter to watch. Hereupon he gives a charge unto his
Disciples, and Apostles to be watchful in their places: watch ye therefore, v.
35. And hereunto he urges them; because the time of both particular, and
general judgment is uncertain, for ye know (...) when the master of the house
(...), at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning, ibid.

Now this is a motive, that concerns, not only the then Disciples of Christ,
but all Christians in general, and accordingly, our Savior presses the duty
upon all, v. 37. And what I say unto you, I say unto all, watch; that is, in
your callings; and be careful conscionably to discharge them: for, that the
watchfulness here spoken of includes this particular, if it be not restrained
there unto is evident; because the first inference of our Savior's Command of
watchfulness, is drawn, from his appointing unto all the Servants of his
family, and in particular the Porters of his house, that is, the Pastors of his
Church, their several works, and employments, he gave to every man his work,
and commanded the Porter to watch: Watch ye therefore, v. 34. 35. Unto this
exhortation of our Savior's let us add the gracious promise, that he makes,
Matthew: 24. 45, 46, 47: of a glorious reward unto Ministers, for diligence in
their callings, and the like promise may be, in some sort, extended unto all
others, that shall be found faithful in their stations. Here we have. 1: the
duty of the ministerial function described, v. 45. Who then is a saithsull and
wise servant, whom the Lord has made ruler over his household, to give them
meat in due season? Next we have the reward of it propounded and that, 1: in
proper terms, verse. 46: blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he comes
shall find so doing: next in metaphorical terms, in allusion unto the
Custom of great men in preferring their diligent, and faithful Servants,
verse. 47. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him Ruler over all his
goods. Here you see, that the faithful and laborious Minister, who gives his
Lord's household their meat in due season, shall be happy at the last day: and
from this we may, by the rule of Contraries, infer, that those Ministers
shall then be most miserable, and accursed, without repentance, who are here
idle, or active only in doing mischief, in sowing tares, and distributing
poison, damnable Heresies destructive of the very foundation of faith: the
belief of the terriblenesse of the last judgment had an influence upon Paul's
diligence in the work of the ministry, 2 Cor. 4. 10, 11. We must all appear
before the judgment seat of Christ; knowing therefore the terror of the Lord,
we persuade men: here we have the work of the ministry expressed
Synecdochally by it is principal part, we persuade men, to wit, unto faith,
repentance, obedience, etc, and then we have the inducement that stirred him up
hereunto, (...) therefore the terror of the Lord, to wit, in the day of
judgment: Now, that Paul herein was acted by a servile and and legal spirit, I
belive none will presume to assert.

Those Ministers, have no practical knowledge of the terror of the day of
judgment, that are remiss or unfaithful in their Callings, and do not
resemble Paul, in his unwearied endeavors, to persuade men to fly from the
wrath to come: but the terriblenesse of the last judgment should be, not only a
spur unto Ministers to be diligent in their studies and Pulpits, but also an
incentive unto activity in all others: it should make the Husbandman laborious
at the Plow, the Artificer industrious in his shop, the Judge upright and
impartial upon the tribunal, the Lawyer conscientious in his practice, and
that both in his chamber and at the bar, and the Soldier valiant, and
resolute in the field: knowing the terror of the Lord (should the husbandman
and artificer say) we labor working with our hands that which is good, that we
may have to give to him Job. 29. 14, 15, 16, 17.
that needs, Ephesians. 4. 28: knowing the terror of the Lord (should the Judge
say with Job) I put on righteousness, and it (...) me, my judgment was as a
robe and a (...): I was eyes to the blind, and (...) was I to the lame, I was a
father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out: and I brake
the jaws of the wicked, and (...) the spoil out of his (...), knowing the
(...) of the Lord (should the Lawyer say) my advice and pleadings shall be all
guided by Conscience, and squared by law and justice, knowing the terror of
the Lord (the Soldier should say) I will (...) (...) to no man, neither accuse
any falsely; and be content with my wages, Luke 3. 14. I will be of good courage
and play the man for my people, and for the cities of my God, and the Lord
(...) that which (...) him good, 2 Samuel 10. 12.

A fourth duty of this sort, under which the last mentioned may be 4. A due and
dilignt use (...) employment of our talents.
comprehended, (as the particular under the general) is a diligent use and
faithful employment of all the talents we have received from God: whether bona
animi, corporis, or fortunae, whether they be goods and (...), of the mind, or
of the body, or of fortune (as they are usually called;) the least ability, or
opportunity, that we have for the doing of any good; for they are all our
maste'rs goods, Matthew. 25. 14: our Lord's (...), verse. 18: and we enjoy them,
but as stewards, factors, or trustees; and so stand accountable how we have
used them, and in the universal Audit God will punish, not only the
misimployment, and abuse, but also the non-imployment of our talents: the world
applaudes the politic retiredness of those, that napkin (...) talents, or
hide them in the (...); that bury their parts, and gifts in an obscure privacy,
though they have, from both God, and man, many a (...) call unto public
imploiment; but the sharp check, and terrible censure of these men by Christ,
at the last day, will discover them to be the arrantest fools that ever were
upon the face of the earth: every slothful, and unprofitable servant shall
then be pronounced to be a wicked servant, Matthew. 25. 26: and he shall be
condemned to be cast into utter (...), verse. 30: that is, into Hell; which is
so termed; because it is infinitely remooved from the light, that is joy,
comfort and happiness of Heaven: but he shall suffer, not only a privative
punishment, a punishment of loss; but also a positive punishment, a punishment
of sense: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, ibid: but now cast we
our eye one the other side, and see with what approbation and reward Christ
will reward him, that duly uses and imploieth his talents? verse. 21: his Lord
said unto him well done thou good and faithful Servant, thou have been
faithful over a (...) things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord. Carnal men look upon him, as a busy, and
forward fool; but Christ will proclaim him, in the hearing of all the world,
to be a good and faithful Servant: and how should this cheer, and encourage
against all the miscensures and reproaches of men? but his reward will be not
only verbal, but real, and this is expressed, 1: in metaphorical, 2: in
proper terms. 1. In metaphorical terms: thou have been faithful over a few
things, I will make thee ruler over many things: or as it is in Luke 19:
because thou have been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over
ten Cities. verse. 17: and over five (...), verse: 19: Our Savior here alludes
unto the custom of great Princes, that reward those, who (...) their trust,
and serve them faithfully in inferior places, by preferring them unto
profitable, and honorable Commanderies.

2. In proper terms, enter thou into the joy of the Lord, that is, the joy
which thy Lord enjoys, do thou share, and communicate in it. O! how could
men be slothsull, and unprofitable, if they had but respect unto this
recompense of (...), fellowship with Christ in all his glory? The account that
we must one day give for all our talents, is a very serious, and sad Theme; for
it cal's upon all for mourning, and reformation; because there is none, that
can plead totally not guilty; as would soon appear, if men would but balance
their receipts of Talents, and the employments of them; thou have good, and
great parts, both natural, and acquired; but of what good have they been
productive? what is the service, that thou have done with them? how few are
there of thine intimates, that have learned any considerable thing from thee?
Nay does not thine own family remain uninstructed, and unchatechized, ignorant
of the first principles of the Oracles of God? thou have a strong memory; but
it has been only a storehouse for vanities, and not a treasure for good
things, out of which thou bring forth things new and (...), Matthew 13. 52.
Thou have a large portion of temporals; but alas how narrow, and short is the
Catalogue of thy good works that thou can produce? how backward have thou
always been to contribute toward any good cause? the wants, and necessities of
thy poor brethren have loudely cried unto thee for relief and supply, when
their modesty has made them silent; but thou have shut the bowels of thy
compassion from them, 1 John 3. 17. How sharply does James reprehend the wicked
rich, merely for their sordid sparing, and hording? Jam: 5. 23. (...) to now ye
rich men, etc: your riches are corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten: your
gold and silver is cankred, and (...) rust of (...) shall be a witness against
you, and shall eat your flesh as it (...) fire: ye have heaped treasure
together for the last days.

Here we have a description of their sin, and a (...) of the punishment of it.

1. A description of the sin of the Covetous rich; that they chose rather to
have their goods corrupted and spoiled, than employed to good uses: their
victuals might have refreshed the bowels of the hungry; but they rather
suffered them to putrify and stink: the garments; that lay useless in their
Wardrobes, might have clothed the backs of their naked brethren; but they
rather let them be (...): their gold, and silver might have been laid out for
many a good use; but they had rather it should be cankred, and rust in their
chests.

2. (...) is a denuntiation of the punishment of their sin, (...) rust of
their gold and silver (and we may say the same of the corruption and spoiling
of their other goods for want of use) shall witness against them (by
reflection of their Consciences it shall convince them of base avarice, but it
shall be not only a witness, but an executioner) it shall eat your (...) as
it were fire (the memory and review of it shall gnaw their Conscience, and this
corroding of their Conscience shall have an impression upon their bodies, it
shall (...) their (...), not for consumption, but for (...), and it shall be a
sore and great torment like that of fire;) it shall eat your flesh as it were
sire: (their design may be to amasse up a great heap of treasure, to make
provision against a rainy day; but instead of treasuring up wealth, they
treasure up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath, Romans 2. 5: they
only add to the heap of their vengeance) Ye have heaped treasure together for
the last days. The poor now may think thence themselves unconcerned in all
this discourse; but there may be some poor men, laborers, that get their
living by their handy work, who yet may be obliged to give an alms unto those,
that are poorer than themselves; and so much may be gathered from Ephesians. 4. 28.
Let him that (...), steal no more; but rather let him labor working with his
hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs:
but those that are poorest, may yet have other talents, wherewith they may be
as useful in their place, as the rich, and yet in such use they extremely
fail: they have wit, and judgment, and yet how shie are they of giving
counsel, and advice unto their poor brethren? how backward in speaking for
them, when they themselves are either ashamed out of modesty, or disabled by
sickness to go to speak for themselves? they have health and strength; and
yet they neglect to visit them, they refuse to watch with them, or to travel
unto a Physician for them: nay there are some poor, who, though they are of
very able bodies, are yet so extremely lazy, as that their own wants, and the
cries of their wives, and children for bread, cannot awaken them unto any
industry: but perhaps thou art, not only a beggar, but a Cripple also; why yet
thou may have a richer and more precious talent, than many of vast wealth
have, thou may have the spirit of grace, and supplication poured upon thee,
and have thou improved this as thou oughtedst to have done? must thou not needs
confess, that thy prayers for thy sick, and poor brethren have been both
unfrequent, and unfervent? but to proceed unto those, whom God has entrusted
with the talent of power, and authority: and here, I shall not my self accuse
them, but desire them to examine their own Consciences, and they will soon
inform them; whether they have exercised it so far as they might, for the
suppressing of sin, for the encouragement of virtue, and religion, for the
reforming of their Country? for helping the distressed? for crushing, or
restraining potent oppressors? and delivering the oppressed from their
violence? whether they can as clearly make such a protestation as Job did
Concerning the administration of his Magistracy (...). 29. 11, 12, 13. When the
care heard me, then it (...) me: and when the eye saw me it gave witness to
me: because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that
had none to help him: the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon
me: and I caused the widows heart to sing (...) joy.

From the talent of the Magistracy go we on to that of the Ministry; the
Ministerial office, and the Ministerial gifts: and here who is there among
us, but has cause to bewail his unfaithfulness in part? and his supine
negligence in discharging that trust, and duty, which the measure of his gifts,
and the condition of his calling exact from him? for the perfecting of the
Saints, for the work of the Ministry for the (...) of the body of Christ,
Ephesians. 4. 12. if our enemies should be silent, the unreformednesse of our
congregations will witness against us: for they are most of them, and that in
great part by our default, like the sluggards field in Solomon, Prove. 24. 31.
Which was all overgrown with thorns, and (...) had covered the face thereof,
and the stone wall thereof was broken down: so they are overspred with
ignorance, error or profaneness, and the wall of discipline is broken down, or
rather never erected. I might almost be infinite in the exemplification of this
point, by instancing in all outward helps, all relations, interests, any thing
whatsoever, that gives us any advantage of bringing any glory unto God, any
benefit unto others, any true good unto our selves; for, which of these things
have any of us husbanded as we might; and in such a measure as our Lord and
Master has appointed? what a sorry and pitiful improvement have we made, of
the many good sermons, that we have read; the good company that we have
conversed with; the remarkable experiences, that we have met with? what
unfaithful stewards have the most of men been of that large, and rich talent
of time, which God has trusted them with? omne tempus nobis (...), (...)
qualiter sit expensum; all the time, that God has indulged us, must be
accounted for, how it is spent: non peribit capillus de capite, (...) momentum
de tempore: as not a hair shall fall from our heads unnoticed by God: so
neither shall there pass a minute, or moment of our lives unexamined by God:
and then, how sad will the reckoning of those be, that have redeemed but an
inconsiderable portion of their days for communion with God, and Christian
fellowship? but have wasted the greatest part of them in eating, drinking,
gaming and other pleasures, and recreations, if not in rioting and
drunkenness, in chambering, and wantonness? thus you see, that all of us have
been more or less faulty not in the abusing, yet in the not using of our
talents: as for the future, let the command of our great Lord and Master, that
has received for himself the kingdom, prevail with us, Luke 19. 12, 13. he
says occupy till I come, that is, negotiate, and traffic with your gifts,
for my use, until I come, either by particular or general judgment: and that
indeed will only be a time of reckoning, and no further place for trading: and
therefore now, whilst we have time before us, let us up, and be doing: let us
not receive our talents, our gifts, and graces in vain: and they are received
in vain, when they are not used, for the glorifying of Gods name, the
promoting of Christ's Kingdom, the edifying of our brethren, the advancement of
the public good, both of Church, and Commonwealth, 1 Cor. 12. 7. and 15. 10.
2 Cor. 6. 1. 1 Pet 4. 10.

To quicken unto all possible diligence herein I shall propound three motives,
and that out of the parable of the talents. 1. The Universality of the
accomptants. 2. A specialty remarkable under this universality. And 3ly, The
proportion, that shall be observed in the passing of their accounts.

1. The universality of the accomptants: those that have the fewest, and
meanest talents must come to an audit for them: he that has but one talent
must reckon for that: to whom God gives any thing of them he will require
something: now God gives to all men liberally, Jam. 1. 5. and therefore God
expects from all men a grateful, and plentiful return: as God has
distributed to every one, so let him walk, 1 Cor. 7. 17. Now God has
distributed to every man some gift, and therefore he has really called every
man unto some work and employment: omne beneficium propter officium: you know
what Mordecai said to Hester concerning her preferment, Esth. 4. 14. Who
knows whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? and we
may apply the saying ( mutatis mutandis with due change) unto all ranks, and
conditions of men: we may say to the Judge: who knows whether thou art come
unto the tribunal for such a time as this? to rescue such a poor innocent
from oppression, to deliver such a wronged party from injury? to curb such a
mighty oppressor? to check such a litigious, and vexatious plantiffe? to
repress, and moderate the overbold vociferations of such, and such Lawers, who
otherwise would bassle an unconfident witness, and puzzle an ignorant Jury?
nay we may go far lower, and apply it unto those, that move in inferior
orbs: we may say unto a Constable, Tythingman, or Churchwarden, who knows
whether thou art come to thy office for such a time as this? to suppress such
a disorder? to convict such a grandee of swearing, drunkenness, uncleanesse,
profanation of the Sabbath etc. who thinks that his birth, alliance, riches,
power, and reputation will shelter, and secure him from all pursuits of
Justice? we may say unto a juror; who knows whether God has called thee to
serve for such a time, and cause as this? to prevent that partiality, and
injustice, which is intended by some crafty, and false companions, who are for

some whom God will reckon with in a more special manner then with the rest of
mankind: and they (as you may see in the parable) are Christ's own Servants,
Matthew. 25. 14. the members of his Church visible, those that profess service
to him: for their receipts are far greater then those of Pagans, and
infidels: and therefore they shall undergo a more severe account. 3. Come we
to the proportion, that God will observe in this account: he will proportion
his reward, not unto the nature, or number of men's talents, but unto their
diligence, and fidelity in the use and employment of them: well done thou good
and faithful Servant, Matthew. 25. 21: not well done thou wise, learned, rich,
powerful, valiant servant. Now a man may be as faithful over few things as
another over many: he that has but few and mean talents, talents of silver,
may be as faithful a steward of those, as he that has more, and richer
talents, talents of gold: in the parable he that had but two talents, had the
same reward with him, that had five talents: and Interpreters give this reason;
because there was no unequality in their labor: he that had two talents
labored as much in the employment of his two, as the other in the employment
of his five; and therefore he, as well as the other, was to be ruler over many
things, to enter into the joy of his Lord, Matthew. 25. 20, 21, 22, 23.
Inferior persons may, in their place, glorify God, and serve their Country,
as faithfully, and diligenly, as the justice of peace upon the bench, the Judge
upon the Tribunal, the Prince upon the Throne, and therefore may shine out all
as gloriously in Heaven: a plain Country man, that has but a little knowledge,
and mean gifts, may do his utmost in the communicating of them, and then his
happiness may not come short of that of the greatest Scholar: the Widow,
that cast into the treasury but her two mites, was more accepted with, and
shall more bountifully be rewarded by God, than those that threw in far
larger sums, Luk 21. v 1. 2, 3, 4. Mark. 12. 41, 42, 43, 44: for though her
talent was smaller, yet her fidelity was superior, and that, by the testimony
of our Savior himself: he, that praises God only upon a (...) instrument,
(his authority extending but to his family, and his example but unto his
neighborhood) may have as thankful a heart here, and as high a place in the
celestial Quire hereafter; as the greatest Monarch, that praises God upon a

pipes, as there be men, to whom his authority or example reaches.

But, though God will not proportion men's rewards unto their talents; yet he
may be said to observe aproportion betwixt their talents, and accounts; because
he expects that men's use, and employment of their talents should be answerable
unto the nature, and number of them: unto whomsoever much is given, of him
shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will

proportion with the gifts that God has distributed; and therefore those, unto
whom God has distributed more, and greater gifts, for them he has cut out
more, and greater work: men then should make their gifts, and talents a rule
unto themselves in working; for it will be a rule, unto which God will have an
eye in judging: we should therefore conclude; that we have never done our full
duty, as long as we have not done all that we can, as long as we have not

in some reasonable fort proportionable unto your receipts: if thou have a
greater income, a more plentiful estate than others, more raised
intellectualls than others; if thou enjoyest more spare time than others; if
thou have a vaster power, and authority than others if thou sit under a
better ministry, conversest with more able, and knowing company than others,
and if withal thou do not do thy master more service than others; thy

men, or bad men, or (...).

1. All men: and they are two; humility toward them, charity in our censures
of them.

1. Humility toward them: the day of judgment diswades, 1: from all pride in
temporals; because then there will be an utter abolition of them, 2. from all
pride in spirituals; because (...) then, there will not be a perfect
consummation of them. 1. From all pride in (...); because then there will be an
an utter abolition of them; at least as to the use of putting a difference
betwixt men in point of degrees, for before Christ's tribunal there will be no
respect of persons, Colos. 3. 25. (...), that is; there will be no respect of
the face, or outward appearance, no regard had unto externals: God will then
sentence all men according to their works; and he will put no distinction
betwixt the free and the bond; the most redoubted Emperor, and his lowest
vassal; betwixt a Craesus and an Irus; the rich glutton, and beggar Lazarus;
betwixt the spruce and complementall Courtier, and the plain and blunt
Peasant; betwixt the learned Critic, and the illiterate Swain; the gallant
Lady, and the homely milk-maide, her that grindeth at the mill. It would be
little better than madness for a stage player, that personates a King, to be
proud over his fellows who act inferior parts, when he knows, that the
tiring house and the Conclusion of the play will end all this disparity: and is
it not as ridiculous a folly, to pride it over others, in regard of those
transitory things, in which the Charnell house, and the day of Judgment will
take away all inequality? 2. Our spirituals are unapt fuel for pride; because
their full consummation will not be until the day of judgment: for here, in
this life, they will still be defective; and so present a continual argument
for our tears, and humiliation: the Corinthians were enriched by Christ Jesus
in every thing in all utterance, and all knowledge, so that they came behind in
no gift: but yet, they waited for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Cor.
1. 5, 7. Dutch Annotations.
as knowing, that then alone they should be made perfect in all that which was
yet wanting to them: indeed, presently upon separation from the body, the
spirits of just men are made perfect: Heb. 12. 23. intensively their graces
then arrive unto their highest, and utmost degree: but this intensive
perfection of their graces does not extend it is operation, and influence unto
their bodies, until the coming of of our Lord Jesus.
2. Charity in our censures of them (especially if they be professors 2 Charity
in our censures of them.
with us of the same true religion) in our censures of their state, and of
their actions: it will be one great torment of reprobates that day to review
their miscensures of the Godly: how will it vex them to behold them their
Judges, whom by their rash judgment they branded as scelestique hypocrites?
how will they be confounded to hear all their black jealousies of them
pronounced to be groundless, and injurious? nay the Godly themselves (though
their glorified Condition be incapable of shame and blushing) will have cause
to retract their over censoriousnesse: God will then own many Sons, unto whom
they would not vouchsase the respect of brethren; they shall meet those,
intermixed with the Angels in the glorious train of Christ, whom their
uncharitable rigor always condemned unto the pit of Hell, as graceless; and
shall hear their actions cleared from those crimes with which their bitter,
and unjust censures charged them. There be two places, in the Apostle Paul,
wherein the day of judgment is used as a reason to dehort from rash, and
nncharitable judging.
The first is, Romans 14. 10, 11, 12, 13: Why do thou judge thy brother? or
why do thou set at naught thy brother? we shall all stand before the
judgment seat of Christ: for it is (...), as I live says the Lord, every knee
shall bow to me, and every tongue shall (...) to God: (...) us not therefore
judge one another any more. The things, for which the Apostle would not have
the weak to judge the strong, as irreligious, and profane, or the strong to
despise the weak, (and despising is a kind of judging) as ignorant, and
unnecessarily scrupulous in the use of their Christian liberty, were matters of
an indifferent nature: and here (to pass ab Hypothesi ad Thesin) we may hence
infer, that in indifferencies, wherein there is no outward and visible
failings, we are not to judge or condemn one another, because Christ has
reserved the judicature of such matters unto himself, for he alone knows how
they are in all particulars circumstanced, and therefore, for us here to be
peremptory in censuring is a presumptious usurpation, and invasion upon the
royal prerogative of Christ.

A second place is the 1 Cor. 4. 4, 5. He that judges me is the Lord,
therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will
bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
counsels of the hearts: and (...) shall every man have praise of God. The
Corinthians it seems had passed a very hasty, and headlong censure upon Paul
in comparison of others, and that unto his injury, and disparagement; from them
therefore he appealeth unto the unerring tribunal of Heaven: he that judges
me is the Lord, he alone is my supreme, and infallible Judge, others may take
upon them to judge me, and to call in question the uprightness, and the
fidelity of my heart in the work of the Ministry: but, alas! they have no
commission for such an act, and besides, they are utterly unqualified for it,
for how little can they pierce into that privy closet of man's soul, the
heart, and conscience? hereupon the Apostle dehortes them from the like
rashness, and precipitancy for the suture, therefore judge nothing, (to wit,
that is hidden and unknown) before the time until the Lord come, wherein
alone there will be a perfect discovery of all secrets: this the Apostle
affirms: first, in the general he will bring to light the hidden things of
darkness: some understand the passage only concerning evil actions, because
darkness in scripture is usually taken in an evil sense: but (as Estius well
observes) it else where signifies only privacy, and (...), and is applyable to
both good and evil actions: for it, he cites two places, Matthew. 10. 27: what I
(...) you in darkness that (...) ye in light, Luke 12. 3: whatsoever you have
(...) in darkness shall be heard in the light: that darkness is here taken in
this latter sense he confirmteth from the context, which agrees in common unto
both sorts of actions: he will then bring to light both, he will then manifest
the good, as well as the bad (...) of the hearts: in these latter words he
exemplifieth by a particular what he had said only in general in the former:
and he instanceth in, what is inwardest, and secretest in man, the counsels of
the heart: men's outward actions lie open unto our view; but the counsels of
men's hearts, the purposes, intentions, ends, aims, and motives whence their
actions spring are of themselves invisible, and no created understanding can
have of them an immediate, and infallible intuition, and therefore, we must
refer them unto the judgment of the last day: then indeed (...) man (to wit,
that has done well) shall have praise, and his praise shall be proportioned
unto the degree of his well doing: They, that will adventure to anticipate the
divine retribution, will be very liable to mistakes, they may, ere they are
aware, detract from the most praiseworthy, and crown those with praises that
are of all others most undeserving: that which Paul here speaks to the
Corinthians (and in them unto all private Christians) may be pressed, in a more
special manner, upon public judicatories, they should judge nothing secret
before the time, until the Lord come: indeed, that which Job professes of
himself, Job. 29. 16: the cause which I knew not I searched out, is the duty
of every magistrate: a Judge should do his best for the bolting out of the
most hidden truth, and to search into the bottom of the darkest cause; but, if
when in this search he has proceeded with his most diligent care, and greatest
caution, he yet has no convictive prooses, but only mere (...) presumptions,
and probabilities to guide him, which can beget only a conjecturall knowledge,
and that is full of uncertainty, here he may guess, but cannot properly judge:
he, that in this case will peremptorily judge either way, may soon wrong the
generation of the upright, and condemn as frequently the innocent as the
guilty: the hidden things of darkness are to be put over unto the final, and
infallible judgment of the great day, which will bring them all into the open
light.

Proceed we next unto those duties that regard wicked men; and they are two,
(...) from them, patience toward them.

First, we may hence be exhorted unto an estrangement from all unnecessary,

the world into a mutiny, and the dissolving of all humane societies, our
callings, relations: and necessities will many times enforce us to have
commerce with the worst of men; but to enter into any league of familiarity,
amity, and inwardnesse with persons notoriously; or professedly impious, and
profane 1. Estrangement from them.
is a thing disagreeable unto that final separation, which Christ shall make
the last day, of the sheep from the goats, the godly from the ungodly, Matthew.
25. 32, 33: shall they only be our intimates, and confidents here in this life
from whom in the next life we are like to be everlasting separatists? shall
they now alone have our hearts, and bosoms, unto whose curse, and condemnation
we shall (without God give them repentance) give our vote, and suffrage? shall
they have our most intimate, and friendliest conversation, that are as yet the
professed enemies of Christ, and his Church? seeing, if they continue so still,
we shall in the last day rejoice, and triumph in their eternal ruin, and
damnation.

Unless God work a change in their hearts, after death we shall never come
into their company again; and after the day of judgment never so much as see
them again, and therefore why shall they now ingrosse, if not all, yet the
greatest part of our intimate, and familiar society? betwixt us then there will
be an impassable gulf, and that unto all eternity, and therefore why now is
there such a nearness betwixt us? the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
nor sinners in the Congregation of the righteous, Psalm. 1. 5: the goats shall
not so much as come nigh the sheep, and therefore now the righteous should not
stand in the way of (...), Psalm. 1. 1: they should (as (...) exhorts) not enter

and at their (...), Jam: 5. verse. 7. 8, 9. Be patient therefore, brethren,
unto the coming of the Lord: behold the husbandman waits for the precious
fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early
and latter rain: be ye also patient, stablish your hearts: for the coming of
the Lord draws nigh. Grudge not one against another, (...), lest ye be
condemned; behold the Jugde stands (...) the door. Here we have an (...)
unto patience, verse. 7. 8: and a (...) from the effects of impatience, verse. 9.

1. An (...) to patience; and this is addressed unto the poor Christians
oppressed, and persecuted by the wicked rich, and so much may be collected from
comparison of verse. 7: with (...). 6: unto which, the illative particle
[therefore] carries us: ye have condemned and killed the just, and he does not
resist you, be patient therefore brethren; your unjust and unavoidable
sufferings are, not only the matter, or object of, but a motive unto patience;
ye are just, and innocent, and yet condemned, and killed, and you can make no
resistance; therefore be patient, therefore you have need of the buckler of
patience, and indeed without it the persecutions, that you are to suffer, will,
not only ruin your states, and bodies; but even sink your souls: the word
is, (...); and (in the margent) it is rendered be long patient, or suffer with
long patience; let patience have her perfect work, (Jam. 1. 4.) let it be
parallel unto your sufferings, be as lasting, and as durable as they can be;
and with them you must expect no truce here in this life, be patient therefore
unto the coming of the Lord, that is, to judgment, until that time you will
daily meet with matter for the exercise of your patience. In the words there
may be both the extension, and the limitation, or restriction of our patience:
be patient unto the coming of the Lord, and when he comes there will be no
further need of your patience: indeed, the habit of patience will still
remain, but there will be no objects wherewith to exercise it: the Apostle
exhorts, as to patience it self, so also to the cause of it, stablish your
(...) (be firm, and unshakeable in the faith:) and be rooted and grounded in
love: (Ephesians. 3. 17.) and in all other practical graces: unsetlednesse in the
faith, temporary graces, that have no firm, or deep rooting in the soul, will
soon betray a man unto impatience, and unto it is usual sequel Apostasy: some
think, that the Apostle urges the fortification of our hearts with courage,
and resolution, against the most bloody, and violent persecutions, that are one
of the strongest temptations unto impatience: Christian fortitude will even
steel, and (as it were) harden the soft spirits of women with an
all-conquering patience, and enable them quietly, and composedly to encounter
such dangers, as a stout Soldier would tremble to think of, whereas, on the
other side, from the want of spiritual valor, you may expect nothing, but
such impotent whining, and puleing language, and behavior, as expresses a
lower impatience, then a man shall meet with in poor children. Hitherto we
have a (...) of the patience exhorted to, 1: From it is (...) of the bloody
persecutions of the ungodly rich, (...). 6. 7. 2. By it is (...), and limitation
unto the coming of the Lord, be patient until then, and afterward there will
be no further trial of your patience, 3. By it is cause establish your hearts.

In the next (...) consider we the arguments, by which the Apostle enforces
this his exhortation unto patience, and they (...) two, 1: A (...) of it: 2. A
promise of reward unto it. 1. A (...) of it, behold the husbandman waits for
the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it until he
receive the early, and latter rain, (...) ye also patient: With a comparison
in point of quality, similitude, there is joined another in point of quantity,
a comparison of unequals: so that the argument proceeds, a minori ad majus,
from the less unto the greater: if husbandmen wait, with such long patience
for the precious fruits of the earth, how much more should Christians wait,
with all possible patience, for the far more precious objects of their faith
and hope?

But the second argument is more to our purpose, and that is the promise of
reward unto this patience in the day of judgment: for the coming of the Lord
draws nigh, and he when he comes will recompense your patience with such a
glorious crown, as shall make a whole age of affliction, and misery spent in
expectation of it to seem but a few days; as Jac. b's time of service seemed
unto him for the love of Rachell, Genesis 29. 20.

The very same motive is used in the next verse to (...) from the effects of in
patience: Grudge not one against (...), (...), lest ye be condemned, behold the
Judge stands before the (...): the latter words are a (...) expression of the
neernes of a thing; so likewise ye, when you shall see all these things, know
that it is near, even at the doors. Matthew. 24. 33: the words, read in our
translation, grudge not one against another, are in the original, (...), and
in the margent it is thus varied, groan, or grieve not; to wit, either out of
(...), or envy. Unto both sorts of groans, I shall show how, the near
approach of the Judge is suited, as a disswasive.

1. Groan not against others out of a desire of revenge for injuries received
from them; for behold the Judge stands at the door: Vengeance is one of
God's royal prerogatives, Romans 12. 19. Deuteronomy. 32. 35: and the day of judgment
is the time, which he has set apart in a more special manner, for the
complete inflicting of it; God will recompense, when he judges his people,
Heb. 10. 30. It is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them
that trouble you; and to you, who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord
Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, 2
These. 1. verse. 6. 7, 8: avenge not your selves therefore, but rather give place
unto wrath, Romans 12. 19: and commit your cause unto him, whose insinitenesse
will have a more tender resentment of your wrongs, then your own narrow hearts
arecapable of.

No injuries cut deeper in men's spirits, than those of tribunals; for what
greater aggravation almost can there be of a man's wrongs, than to have them to
be authorized by the abused Law, and cloaked with a pretense of Justice? and
yet this is a mischief, that sometimes Judges, of the greatest, both ability,
and integrity, may be unable to prevent; for unto the administration of Justice
there be very many, that have a concurrence; and therefore it may be hindered by
the default of the least, and lowest instrument: even as the motion of a clock
will prove irregular, if the least wheel, or but pin be out of order: alse
witnesses may misguide both Jury, and Judge, nay suppose the witnesses give a
true, and full testimony, and the Judge be (as the woman of Tekoah said of
David, 2 Samuel 14. 20.) wise according to the wisdom of an Angel of God, and
discharge his part exactly, in directing the evidence, in recapitulating,
selecting, and collating the material points of that which has been said; yet
one crafty, and wilful knave in a tame Jury may pervert, or disturb Justice:
but now, against the perjury of witnesses, the unjustice of Judges, Jurers,
Counselors, Attourneys, Clerks, there is not the poorest wretch, but may
enter his appeal unto a Judge, that can neither deceive, nor be deceived, and
this should make him in patience to (...) his soul, and take up such an
estimate of the unrighteous, both verdict, and sentence of men, as Paul had of
humane unjust judgments in the general, private, as well as public; with me
it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment,
1 Cor. 4. 3: in the Greek it is, (...), of man's day, or a humane day; man's
day (by a metonymy of the Adjunct) is put for man's judgment; and it is a
phrase taken from ordinary Courts, in which set days are appointed for
judgment: Hierome thinks, that it is a form of speech proper unto the
Cilicians, among'st whom Paul first learned his Greek, as being borne at Tarsus
a City in Cilicia: others take it for a Hebraisme, for with the Hebrews (say
they) the day of the Lord signifies the judgment of the Lord, and so man's day
may, in like manner, signify man's judgment: the like also is in use among'st
the Latins, with whom diem dicere, is in jus (...): here is an opposition
employed betwixt man's day, and the Lord's day. Paul knew that in the Lord's
day he should be acquitted, and so long it was a matter of light moment with
him to be condemned in man's day, if a man can say as Job; (...) hold my
witness is in Heaven, and my record is on high, why then he is beyond the
reach of a slavish fear, or a distempered sorrow; that may arise from the
falsenesse of testimonies, from a pack't jury, a Corrupt Judge, an unfaithful
Lawyer, God knows thine innocence, and he both can, and will clear it, if
thy cause be just, and yet miscary here, (...) it unto the Lord, and he will
(in his day) bring forth thy (...) as the light, and thy judgment as the
noonday, Ps. 37. v. 5. 6 (...) having shown how prone men are to abuse
authority unto oppression, he comfort, and encourages those that are
oppressed, with a consideration of Gods future judgment, Eccles. 3 16, 17. And
moreover I saw under the Sun the place of Judgment, that wickedness was (...),
and the place of (...), that iniquity was there, I said in mine heart, God
shall judge the righteous and the (...): for there is a time there for every
purpose and for every work. That worldly power, and authority is no branch of
true happiness, but a mere vanity, the Preacher proves from its being subject
to be abused unto wrong, and injustice; for let men have what opinion they will
of it, yet, because it is liable to so great a mischief, the utmost it can
render (if severed from the fear of God) is a glorious infelicity: Now the
Preacher observes, that this abuse of Magistracy was a thing very rife, and
usual; and in all likelihood he speaks, not only of foreign nations, but of
the Kingdom of Israel, the only Church of God at that time, wherein
righteousness should, if in any place, reign, and flourish: not only of the
former times under David, Saul, Samuel, and the Judges, but even of the very
days wherein he himself lived: he was a very prudent prince, and his peace
gave him leisure to look after the execution of his Laws; and withal, we may
well presume, that his utmost vigilance, and circumspection were not wanting;
but notwithstanding all this injustice too too frequently crept into his very
courts of Justice: Moreover I saw under the Sun the place of Judgment, that
wickedness was there: and the place of righteousness, that iniquity (...)
there. The offense is aggravated from the circumstance of place, wherein it was
committed; the place of righteousness, the place of Judgment: to violate
justice any where is naught, but to do it in the Courts of Justice is extremely
odious and abominable: for they, by their institution, should be Altars of
refuge unto the wronged, and distressed: and therefore, when they prove unto
them a rock, against which they split, and ship-(...) all their hopes, and
fortunes, the disappointment of their just expectation, cannot but add
exceedingly to their injury, and vexation: as the Temple was consecrated wholly
unto Gods worship, so that no vessel, but what was holy, was to be brought
therein: even so places of judgment are to be sacred unto justice, and nothing
unjust should dare appear there: and if it do the frown of the Judge should
soon scatter it. Solomon's great Throne (and it was a throne whereon he
executed judgment, 1 King. 7. 7. was made of Ivory, and overlaid with the best
gold, 1 Kings 10. 18. and this (...) (...) (...) Solomon (...), and (...)

(think some) was to signify, that from it nothing was to proceed, but what
was white, (...) Ivery, sound, and incorrupt, (...) precious as the best gold:
the moral may be applied unto the tribunals of subordinate Judges; for, let
them consist of whatsoever matter, yet their use, and end is not only innocent,
white, like ivory, but also (...), and glorious, like (...) gold: and from a
throne of ivory overlaid with the best gold, no dross should be heard, no
lead, no sentence of ignorance, no iron, no sentence of violence: hereupon is
it (as Mr Cartwright observes) that the Prophet Esaiah thus describes the
corruption of public Justice in Judah, Esai: 1. 22. thy silver is become
dross, thy wine mixed with water (and how he explaineth this Allegory you may
see in the next verse) thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves:
every one loves gifts, and follows after (...): they judge not the
fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.

But the Preacher (having shown the disease of his times, public unjustice)
in the next place points unto the remedy of the wronged against it verse. 17.
and that sometimes is only a patient waiting for Gods last judgment, that will
review, correct, and redress all the miscarriages of humane judicatories: I
said in my heart God will judge the righteous (to wit, by a sentence of
absolution) and the wicked (to wit, by a judgment of condemnation) for there is
a time there (that is, with God, in the judgment to come) for every purpose,
and for every (...): if men be overthrown in one court, and there lie an
appeal unto another, where there sits a Judge of known, and unquestionable
uprightness and incorruption, they will hopefully, and cheerfully fly unto
that other, though the prosecution of their appeal be very chargeable: The
lowest vassal, that is upon the (...) of the earth, has liberty to appeal,
from the highest court upon earth, unto one that is far higher, that which the
Lord will hold in the day of judgment; the pursuit of thy appeal thither will
cost thee nothing, but thy tears, and prayers; and there, God will Judge over
thy cause again, and do thee all the right, that thou can desire, and
assurance of this should (one would think) exclude, all excess of sorrow,
faintness of courage, and despondency of spirit for the misiudgings of the
highest of men: If thou see the oppression of the poor, and violent,
perverting of Judgment, and Justice in a Province, (...) not at the matter: for

punishment then shall be such, as shall throw them below all envy: it will then
be plainly seen, that innocent Paul, at the bar, had no reason to look with
an envious eye at his unjust Judge, Felix, upon the tribunal: that Lazarus the
beggar, in his rags, (...) of sores, and wants, had no ground to repine at the
pompous attire, and sumptuous fare of the rich glutton: that the poor Martyrs,
in their deepest, and darkest dungeons, laden with irons, and chains, upon
the rack, in their greatest tortures, at the stake, amidst their flames were in
a far happier condition, than their cruel persecutors in the height of all
their power, pomp, and glory: the upright shall have dominion over them in the
morning (to wit, in the resurrection) Psalm. 49. 14. here the wicked flaunt it,
domineer, and tyrannize it over the godly: but these, in the last day shall
enjoy a full victory, and triumph over them: Ye that fear my name shall tread
down the wicked (says God, in the Prophet Malachie) for they shall be (...)
under the soles of your seet, in the day that I shall do this, says the Lord
of Hosts, Mal. 4. 3. Now they trample, upon the godly and make up the upper end
of the world: but then, they shall be the vilest, and most contemptible of men:
they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet to tread upon: the present
selicity of the wicked was a great stumbling block even unto a David, until he
went into the Sanctuary, then he understood their end, Psalm. 73. 2. 3. 17. when
he understood their end, their novissima, what happened unto them after death,
and judgment, this calmed, and composed his spirit: for then he saw, that they
were not to be envied in their highest glories.

To go unto the last sort of duties: to wit, those which regard good men, both
ordinary Christians, and Ministers, and they are two. 1. The real expressions
of a cordial love of them in (...). 2. All actions of Christian Communion with
them in particular.

First, the day of judgment should provoke unto real expressions A third sort
of duties unto which the day of judgment perwades, regards good men: and are
two.
of a Cordial love of them in general: In the prayer of the Apostle for the
Thessalonians (in the 1 These. 3. 12, 13.) you may observe: that growth in this
love will be attended with such an unblameable holiness, as will stand before
God at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: the Lord make you to increase, and
abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward

you: to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness, before
God, even our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints.

Now love, is not sincere, unless it be fruitful and expressive; and the very
omissions of the expressions of charity will be, by Christ himself, put into
the bill of endictment against reprobates in the day of Judgment, Matthew. 25.
41, 42, 43, 44, 45. and therefore, much more, their injurious, and cruel acts
of persecution, and oppression of them: men dare not affront, and wrong those,
that are near in place, and favor unto a Judge, before whom they are to be
tried for their lives: the general trial, at the last day, will concern men's
eternal life, and happiness, and unto the Judge Christ Jesus none are so
nearly related, as the Godly; for they are his servants, favorites, intimates,
members, spouse, and (...): and yet, there are none among the sons of men, that
have so much contempt, so many, and so great injuries, and abuses heaped upon
them, as they: nothing so much distasteth carnal men, as strictness in the
service of Christ; nothing amongst them exposes unto so much scorn, and
obloquie, as to be a faithful Ambassador unto Christ: and is not this an
evident argument of disesteeme of, and disaffection unto his person, and
office? the guilt hereof may sufficiently instruct such malignant enemies, that
they are not to expect any good, or favor from him, when he shall sit upon the
throne of his glory in judgment. John Damascene relates this following story of
a certain great and powerful king, Quidam Rex (...) (...) and gloriosus: and
(...) est procedente illo in curru deaurato cum (...) (...), obviasse illi duos

riding in a chariot overlaid with gold, and waited on by his Royal guard, he
met with two Ministers well known unto him, who were very meanly habited and in
a poor plight of body: He no sooner saw them but he forthwith leapt down from
his chariot and in reverence of them prostrated himself upon the ground, and
afterward arising he embraced them, and affectionately kissed them. The nobles
that attended him, deeply resented this his carriage as unbecoming the glory
and majesty of a king. Hereupon they addressed themselves unto his brother, and
he by their instigation tartly admonished him, that in this strange veneration
of two such contemptible wretches he had forgotten his dignity, and dishonored
his Crown. The king for the present said little unto him, but the next evening
he returned him a real and sharp answer. It was the custom of that Country
(where the kings power was, it seems, (...)) for the king to denounce the
sentence of death without farther process, by a trumpet sounded by an officer
appointed for that purpose, so that all the neighborhood looked upon him,
before whose gate this trumpet was sounded, as a condemned man: when the night
came, the king commanded this trumpeter to sound before the gates of his
brothers house, who no sooner heard it, but he looked upon it as the messenger
of his unavoydable death. And this despair made the Remainder of the night
(...) unto him, and all his family. As soon as it was day he went in (...)
apparel with his Wife and Children unto the Court-gates, (...) (...)
expecting every minute the Executioner. The King hearing (...) (...) elently
commanded him to be brought unto his presence; and (...) (...) in this
mournful posture, thus he (...) him: (...) (...) (...) tremble at the trumpet
of thy natural Brother, though thine (...) be not privy unto any signal
offense against him, what a (...) part then was it in thee to reprehend me for
(...) (...) and reverentiall salutation of the trumpets of my great God, which
(...) me unto his tribunal, that is insinitely more (...), than mine, seeing
mine heart is conscious of great and in numerable transgressions against him.
There was doubtless an imprudent excess in this action, which I may excuse;
but shall not undertake to justify, much less shall I press to the practice
of the same. God forbid, that any Protestant minister should accept so profound
a respect from the people of his Congregation: But yet however the example may
make those blush, (if their cheeks were capable of such a color,) who have
the ministers of Jesus Christ, by whom God will judge the secrets of men in
such an horrible contempt, as that to use the expression of Job in another
case; They disdain to set them with the dogs of their slocke, Job. 30. 3.

Secondly, we may from the day of judgment be pressed unto all obliged acts of
communion with them, let us consider (...) another, to prevoke 2. All actions
of Christian communion with them in particular.
unto love, and to good works: not for saking the assembling of our selves
together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another, and so much the
more as ye (...) the day approaching, Heb. 10. 24, 25: here the Apostle call's
upon the Hebrews for both private, and public acts of Christian Communion;
and he makes the near approach of the day of judgment a special incentive
unto both.

1. It is an incentive unto private acts of Christian communion; let us
consider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works; (...) one
another, and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching; for, when that
day comes, it will be to no purpose to exhort one another; and therefore as
the (...), chap. 3. verse. 13: Exhort (...) another daily, whilst it is called
to day: what the (...) speaks of exhortation, I may say of private prayer for
one another pray for one another, and so much the more as you see the day
approaching; for, when that day comes, prayers for one another will be in
vain, the efficacy of the prayer or petition is proper unto the time of this
life, now the effectual (...) prayer of one righteous man (...) much, and that
for others, (...) 5. 16: but (...) the prayers of millions will be of no avail.

2. Unto public acts of Christian communion; not forsaking the assembling of
our selves together, as the manner of (...) is: and so much the more as you see
the day approaching. At that day all the Saints will concur unto the making
up of the general assembly and Church of the first borne, Heb. 12. 23: and
therefore, why should any of them, that live here together, forsake the
assembling of themselves together? then they shall for ever associate in the
praises of God; and why then shall they not in the interim join in all other
parts of God's worship? and walk hand in hand together, friendly, and
fruitfully in all the ordinances of Christ? then shall there be a perpetual,
and uninterrupted union, and communion betwixt them; and is it not a thousand
pities, that there should be in the mean time betwixt them a separation? then
they shall all stand together in one (...) at the right hand of Christ; and why
now should there be such distances, and divisions betwixt them? nothing shall
then break off that happy fellowship, in which they shall everlastingly
embrace one another; and what is there now then, that should make them to
refuse to reach out to one another the right hand of fellowship? O beloved! the
animosities, sidings, factions, schisms, and bandings, that are among st
Protestants (betwixt Lutherans, and Calvinists; Presbyterians and Independents;
and betwixt both, and some moderate persons for Prelacy) are unmeet
qualifications for that blessed unity, agreement, and harmony, which shall be
betwixt all the Godly at the day of judgment, and from that unto all (...):
there is nothing almost more opposed unto this communion of Saints, then their
condemning, and (...) one another: and from both those the Apostle dehortes
upon the account of the general judgment, Romans 14. 10, 11, 12, 13. But why
do thou judge thy brother? or why do thou set at naught thy brother? we
shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ: for it is written. As I
live, says the Lord, every knee shall (...) to me, and every tongue shall
confess to God. So then, every one of us shall give account of himself to
God; let us not therefore (...) one another, any more. Why do Christians judge
one another, seeing they shall all be associated with Christ, as assessors in
judgment? why do they set at naught one another, seeing they shall all stand
upon the same level before the judgment seat of Christ? and at this general
appearance; the weak must give an account, for judging of the strong, and the
strong for their despising the weak; and both for their rending the Church of
God, and disturbing the peace thereof: however their persons may be acquitted,
yet their actions shall be condemned, and discovered to be naught. Contests
between brethren are very unsuitable unto their work in the day of judgment;
for then they shall all join in the worship of God: as I live says the Lord,
every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God, verse. 11:
and unto this sacred conjunction how unfortable is it for them here to be
snarling one at another, to be judging and despising one another?

There is another opposite of Christian fellowship mentioned by James; and his
dissuasive from it is, the nearness of the great Judges coming, grudge not one
against another, brethren, behold the Judge stands before the door, Jam. 5.
9: in the Greek it is, (...), groan not one against another, brethren: it is
very probable, that he speaks of the dissenting Christians of those times,
that went under the names of the circumcision, and uncircumcision: in the two
next foregoing verses he exhortes them to patience toward persecuting enemies,
and in this he dissuades them from the effects, and fruits of impatience one
toward another; to wit, contentious groans, groan not one against another
(out of contention) for behold the Judge stands at the door; and he
disalloweth all such groans, and will put an utter period unto them: as he
will wipe away all tears from the eyes of brethren, Rev. 21. 4: so he will
suppress all their groans: we shall all be perfect friends at our journeyes
end; and therefore, why do we fall out by the way? God will reconcile all the
brethren at the last day; and therefore it is folly for any of them to jangle
in the mean while? they shall not then so much as harbor an ill thought one
of another; and therefore why should they now think so uncharitably of, and
speak, and write so bitterly one against another? that persecuters should
condemn, and kill the just is no wonder, verse. 6: but that brethren should
thus sigh, groan, and pray one against another, especially seeing the Judge
stands at the door, is very strange.

Thus, having seen how the day of judgment is an inducement unto the matter of
the forementioned duties; I shall only crave thy patience, Reader, to show, how
it has the same use, as touching the manner requisite in the performance of
them; which stands especially in four things; fervency, frequency,
sincerity, and constancy.

The two (...) I shall join together: the day of judgment is an apt Day of

motive unto fervency and frequency in the foregoing duties, 1 Cor. 15. 58. Be
ye always (...) in the work of the Lord; estote eminentes in opere (...), as
Beza reads it, be ye always eminent, or excelling in the work of the Lord;
for as much as you know that your labor will not be in vain in the Lord: for,
in the day of retribution, he will render unto every man according unto his
(...), according unto the degree, and measure, and according to the number of
his works: the harvest of our glory will be proportioned unto our seed of
grace, and good works: he which sows spareingly, shall, reap spareingly,
and he which sows bountifully, shall reap bountifully, 2 Cor. 9. 6: those
that outshine their brethren here in holiness, shall hereafter outshine them
in (...): and this our Savior 2. Frequency
expresses metaphorically, in conformity unto the guise of prudent Princes;
who prefer their Servants proportionably unto the degree of their service: he
that gained ten pounds, had authority (...) him over ten Cities; and he that
(...) but five pounds, was placed but over five Cities, Luke 19. 16, 17, 18, 19.

Thirdly, the day of judgment is an apt motive unto sincerity, because 3. In
sincerity.
then there will be a perfect, and full disclosure of all hypocrisy, and
dissimulation; God will then judge the secrets of (...); God will then bring
every secret thing unto judgment, Eccles. 12. 14: he will bring to light the
hidden things of darkness, the bidden things of (...); he will make manifest
the counsels of the hearts, 1 Cor. 4. 5: unto this some apply that of our
Savior, Luke 12. 1, 2, 3. Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is,
hypocrisy; for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, (...) hid;
that shall not be known: therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness,
shall be heard in the light, and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house tops: the 2. and 3. verses are (by
Cajetane and others) understood of the life to come, to wit, in the day of
judgment. The design of Pharisaicall hypocrites is to cloak, and conceal
their vices, and sins with shows, and professions of religion: but this will
be a vain, and fruitless design; for, in the day of judgment, the craftiest
hypocrite shall be unmasqued; his most concealed, covered, and hidden actings
shall be displaied, revealed, and made known; darkness shall be no shelter to
him, and the greatest privacy cannot prevent detection: what he has done in
darkness shall be made visible to all the world: his most private whispers,
and that in the closet, shall become audible to all the world, shall be as it
were proclaimed upon the house tops: he respects the manner of the Jewish
buildings, which were slat rooft, whence they might speak to multitudes in the
streets: the books of men's consciences, that were here perhaps clasped, and
tied, shall then be opened, Rev: 20. 12: and the contents of them shall be
plainly legible by men, and Angeis. Ottocar M. Thomas Fuller.
King of Bohemia, refused to do homage to Rodulphus the first Emperor, till

homage to the view of three armies in presence. Thus God at last shall uncase
the closet dissembler to the sight of men, Angels, and (...), having removed

found out the Imposture: it is no difficult matter for hypocrites to cheat men
with Semblances of piety; but let them not be deceived for God will not (in
their day of trial) be mocked; but will clearly evidence their hypocrisy unto
all, by the hardness of their hearts, and brawninesse of their consciences:
the most discerning eye can hardly pierce into the hypocrisy of some

Virgins themselves: but the coming of the Bridegroom will make an evident, and

Cajetane observes that they had oil in their lamps, but not in their
vessels: they could produce, as a testimony of their goodness, and sincerity,
the blaze of outward good works: But, alas! this will never pass with God in
the day of judgment, as long as there is wanting; in their hearts, and
consciences the inward testimony of uprightness, and that is wanting in them,
they have no oil in their vessels; for God is not the formalis Ratio, the
ground, and principal inducement of their good works, and duties: they are
not performed for his sake, from a love of him, in obedience to 4. In constancy
and perseverance.
his command, and out of respect unto his glory.

Lastly, the day of judgment is a strong and powerful incentive unto
Constancy, and perseverance, and that both in faith and obedience.

1. In faith and the profession thereof: Now we beseech you brethren, by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gath ring together unto him, that
ye be not soon shaken in mind, or judgment [ or from your mind and judgment,]
2 These. 2. 1, 2. The Apostle speaks of a particular error concerning the day
of judgment: but, we may enlarge what he says unto instability of judgment in
all matters of faith whatsoever, and shall gloss the words by these following
Scriptures, Ephesians. 4. 14. Be not children tossed to and fro, and carried about
with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of (...), and cunning crastinesse
whereby they lie in wait to (...), Heb. 10. 23: Let us hold fast the (...) of
(...) faith without wavering, Heb. 13. 9. Be not carried about with diverse and
strange doctrines, for it is a good thing that the heart be established with
grace.

But you will demand why he adjures them hereunto, by the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him?

The reason is, because, when the Lord Jesus Christ comes, when we shall be
gathered together unto him, we shall all then come in the unity of the faith,
and knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, Ephesians. 4. 13: then we shall
all attain a firm immobility in the truth, and for this, not only a revolt or
dissent from, but even a doubting or unsetlednesse in any part of the doctrine
of faith meritoriously unqualifieth: Christ promises when he comes to make
him that overcomes a pillar in the (...) of his God, Rev. 3. 12: and for such
a place in the Heavenly structure how unfit are those, that by every blast of
false doctrine are transported from the truth of the Gospel? for every storm
of persecution slip anchor and (...) cable? he that denies any parcel of
Evangelicall doctrine does in part deny Christ, and how can such expect, but to
be disowned by Christ, when he comes to judgment? how esfectually this
meditation wrought with a Persian Eunuch (one Usthazanes that had been
Governor unto Sapores King of Persia in his minority) you may read in
Sozomene, lib. 2. cap. 8: this man for fear denied the Christian faith, and
worshipped the Sun, but was (...) (...) by a strange providence: Simcon
Archbishop of Seleucia and (...) was for his constany in the faith dragged unto
(...) by the Courtgates where Usthazanes then sat, who, though he durst not
make any profession of Christianity, yet he could (...) but arise and express
his reverence unto the aged Archbishop iu a respective and an honorable
salutation, but the zealous good man frowned upon him, and turned away his face
from him, as thinking him for his Apostasy, unworthy of his notice, and
acquaintance: this forthwith stroke Usthazanes unto the heart, and (...) from
him store of tears, and groans: and thus he (...) with himself, Simeon will
not own me, and can I expect any other but that God should disclaim me when I
appear before his tribunal? Simeon will not speak unto me, will not so much
as (...) upon me, and can I (...) for so much as a good word or a good look
from Christ, whom I have so shamefully betrayed, and denied? hereupon he threw
off his rich, and courtly garments, and put on mourning apparel, and
profissed himself a Christian, and so, of a Cowardly (...), he became a
resolute, and glorious Martyr.

2. The day of judgment is a congruent inducement unto Constancy in obedience:
stablish your hearts (says James) for the coming of the Lord draws nigh,
Jam. 5. 8: not only stablish your heads in (...), but also stablish your hearts
in all moral virtues, graces, and duties; stablish your hearts (...) in (...),
1 These. 3. 13: for the coming of the Lord draws nigh; and he when he comes
will give a crown of life unto all those, and only those, that are faithful
unto death, Rev. 2. 10.

I shall conclude with Heb. 10. 36, 37, 38, 39. For ye have need of patience,
that after ye have done the will of God, ye (...) (...) the promise yet a
little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry: Now the
just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back my soul shall have no
pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto (...); but of them
that believe to the saveing of the soul. The patience here spoken of differs
but little from constancy, and perseverance; and it regardes in duties those
difficulties, impediments, troubles, and molestations, that deter from them,
and tempt unto a desertion of them: these are so many, and great; that patience
is necessary unto every Christian to keep him from backsliding: and this
patience must be an active, and diligent patience; ye must do the will of God;
and without this patience there is no receiving of the promised reward; ye have
need of patience that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the
promise: for the promise runs conditionally, upon condition we patiently
persevere: God will render to them, who by patient continuance in well doing,
seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life, Romans 2. 7. But now
they may be ready to object, that the promise would not be fully accomplished
until the day of judgment, and that was a great ways off, unto this Paul
answers, that Christ's coming was near at hand, if Cornelius Alapide.

He that comes will come, he will come as certainly as if he were come
already, but, because flesh and blood, out of impatience, is apt to think,
that the time is very long, he contents not himself with a vehement and
earnest affirmation, that Christ will come shortly, and speedily, but goes yet
further to put the matter out of all doubt by denial of the contrary, and will
not Quod sequitur, and non tardabit, hunc sensum habet: Non differet adventum
suum ultra tempus constitutum. Tardat enim, non qui (...) non veniet: fed qui
procrastinat ultra condictum. (...) dictum est a B. Petro secundo Epist.
tertia. Non tardat Dominus promissionem suam, etc. (...). 22. Decimas tuas, and
primitias non tardabis (...) id est, reddes eas suo tempore. Aliud igitur est,
tardare, aliud moram faccre: Nam (...) non tardet Christus, moram interim
facit. Hoc enim praecedit apud eundem (...) Simoram secerit, (...) eum. Estius
in loc.
tarry, that is (as Diodati upon the place) beyond the time, which God has
prefixed, and beyond the tune as shall be necessary for the Church.

But, though Christ's coming be near at hand in the above mentioned respects,
yet in it self it is a long time off: and what shall poor and persecuted
Christians do in the mean while? why the Apostle tel's us (out of the Prophet
Habakkuk) that until that time the just shall live by faith, faith in the
promise of Christ's coming will sustain, and support the soul, and make to
walk cheerfully and comfortably, But, one the contrary, the condition of the
Apostate is very sad, and uncomfortable.

For. 1: he incurreth the hatred of God. if any man draw back my soul shall
have no pleasure in him, in the words there is a Litotes, so that more is
understood, then is expressed: by the denial of God's complacency, is
signified his hatred of, (...): so that it is, as if he had said; I infinitely
detest, and abhor all back-sliders: a slavish fear of the wrath of man, is
that which makes many Apostates; but such shall find in the day of judgment;
that the hatred of their Judge will be more dreadful, than that of their most
potent persecuters; who without repentance, will, as their fellow prisoners, be
arraigned with them at the same bar: men think, by their sinful compliances
with the times, to procure the favor, and approbation of great men; but,
alas (...) this is but a sorry design, for withal they pull upon themselves
the dislike of Jesus Christ: the foolish Virgins, whose lamps go out, shall
be rejected by the Bridegroom, Matthew. 25. v. 10, 11, 12: and what good will
the countenance of Princes do a man, if he be rejected, and condemned by the
Judge of all the earth.

Thou may by thine unconstancy preserve thy state, and the life of thy body;
but then thou runnest upon the assured ruin, and destruction of thy soul: we
are not of them, who draw back unto perdition; all that draw back, draw back
unto perdition: so that we may say of all Apostates, that are finally
impenitent, what the Apostle speaks above, v. 26. 27: of the highest rank of
them, such as sin against the holy Ghost, there remains no more sacrifice
for their sins, but a (...) fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery
indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

A BRIEF AND Scholasticall Discourse, TOUCHING The NATURE of THANKSGIVING.

Printed by HEN: HALL for THO: ROBINSON, 1660.

Unto the Worshipful, The MAYOR, The ALDERMEN, WITH All other the well
affected Inhabitants of the City of CHICHESTER, HENRY IEANES Dedicateth this
ensuing discourse of Thanksgiving;

AS

A Public, and perpetual Testimonial of his Cordial gratitude, for their
hospitable reception of him, and his, during the late Civil Wars of this
Nation.

To the READER.
I Formerly published a Treatise touching the Excellency of Thanksgiving, and
the favorable acceptance of that has encouraged me to send after it This,
Concerning the nature of Thanksgiving; The Subject was my first Theological
Essay, which some twenty years since, or upwards, I revised, and contracted,
and now I present it unto thee without any considerable either alteration, or
addition: Many Authors I might perhaps then make use of, which now I have
forgotten: But all that (...) can remember I have either quoted in the
discourse it self, or placed in the Margent:

Thine in the Service of Christ, HENRY JEANES.

Ephesians: 5. 20. Giving thanks allwaies for all things unto God, and the Father,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
THe words without surther discourse, contain 5 Generals.

1. An act, or duty -- Giving thanks. 2. Next the time when to be performed, --
allwaies. 3. The matter, for what -- all things. 4. And 4ly, the object unto
whom -- God, and the Father. 5. Lastly, the Mean, or Mediator, through whose
mediation, In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
I begin with the act, or duty it self -- Giving thanks. A thing not so
soon done, as said, but an harder task then most conceive, unto which must
concur the whole man, the inward, the outward man, but the inward, first, and
chiefly. The Summons David gave his soul, Psalm. 103. we must ours, Praise the
Lord, o my soul, and all that is within me bless his Holy Name. And indeed in
these Eucharisticall offerings with the fat, and inwards God is most
delighted-He is the searcher of hearts, -- Father of spirits, the thanks
therefore of the heart, and spirit, he will especially eye, and reward. That
sacrifice of thanks then, which is like that last of Caesar's without an heart,
will prove but a sacrifice of fools, unacceptable to Heaven. Above all
therefore have a care, that the instrument thine heart be as David's was, Psalm.
57. 7. prepared, and the strings the faculties thereof well-tuned, else the
melody of thy Verbal thankfulness will be quite marred, even as the
gracefulness of a sweetly sung song is lost by jarring upon a distun'd
instrument. But now, however this sacrifice must be first kindled at the Altar
of the heart; yet it will not long stay there, but spread further, and break
out into the Temple of the outward man. And first 'twill awaken our glory,
Psalm. 57. 19. that is our tongue, so styled, because the chiefest instrument of
glorifying God, wherein stands man's highest glory. And next it will quicken
the hands to act, every member, some way or other, to express the
thankfulness of our hearts, that so our thanks may absolutely be full,
complete, and entire. Gratitude, as blood in the body, runn's through the
whole practice of Christianity, and so has general use in, and influence
upon, all the duties we perform. Because as special Precepts oblige unto the
severals of them, so also the freeness, and fullness of God's favors engage
generally to all of them. And answerably the Schoolmen make ingratitude a
general circumstance of sin, not as though it were of the Notion, and
Definition of sin in general, but only because it adheres, and cleaves unto
every sin, gradually aggravating the guilt, and demerit thereof. For in all
sins we commit, there is, as a deviation from the special Laws against
them, so also a virtuall disregard of God's mercy, a powerful disswasive from
them: and therefore, although ingratitude be formally only when there is an
express and actual contempt of Benefits; yet there is (says 21, (...). q.
107. art. 2. ad (...).
Aquinas) a material kind of ingratitude in every sin. Thankfulness unto
God then, by way of Connotation, takes in both tables, all duties that concern
God, or man; and suitably unthankfulness too is by way of Concomitancy a
bundle, or fardle of all other vices. -- Ingratum si dicas, omnia dixeris.

Nay thankfulness formally in it self is also of a wondrous wide extent, made
up of many parcels, containing many integrals, all which (...). (...). q. 107.
art. 2.
Aquinas reduces unto three. 1. To Recognize a (...). 2. Duly to prize it
etc. And 3ly, To requite it. We will add two more, and so reckon up in all
five degrees of thankfulness, and so of thanksgiving.

Observation, Confession, Remembrance, Valuation, Retribution, -- -- matters
not so quickly run over, so soon dispatched, as we ordinarily dream, as
will appear if we weigh them severally.

1. First then, we must punctually, or particularly and heedfully, or fixedly
observe blessings; their receipt, enjoyment, use, continuance, increase; and
this indeed is the foundation of all the rest: for unless favors be known, or
taken notice of, they can never be acknowledged, remembered, duly valued, and
then small likelihood any thing should be rendered for them: hopes then of our
gratitude are even desperate, for notwithstanding the overflowings of mercies,
the showers of blessings upon us (to phrase it with Ezekiel 24. v. 26.) how
dull and heavy are we in the apprehension of them? Strange, that as Moses face
shone to all except himself; so the luster, and splendour of our growing
happiness should even dazzle neighbor-nations, and we our selves scarce
perceive so much as a glimse thereof. Whom will it not possess with a degree
of just amazement to consider, that we, though encompassed with Gods favor, as
with a shield, hedged about with blessings so many, so eminent, as that,
unless we hoodwinke our selves, impossible they should escape our observation,
can yet discern none of all this, though sharp-sighted enough in espiall of
miseries and losses?

But to return. Our observation will be too short, if it reach no further then
Blessings in themselves. Our thoughts therefore must not be fixed, and stay
upon them, but be raised upward to a view of that bounty, which gave them; unto
a sight of God in them: unto an apprehension, not only of his general
providence, (for that makes the Sun to rise on the evil, as well as the good,
and sends rain on the unjust, as well as just:) but of his special love,
benevolence, the light of his Countenance shining through them on us in his Son
Christ Jesus. This David preferres before a very great blessing in it self
considered, and for it is chiefly thankful, Because thy loving kindness is
(...) then life, my lips shall praise thee, Psalm. 63. 3. And indeed to observe
God's kindness will give a sweet relish to the meanest favors, to but a cup
of cold water, whereas want of such notice will imbitter your oil, corn,
wine, your richest variety and greatest plenty of outward things. Nay a
thorough-sense, and feeling of Gods special favor in the benefits we receive,
will, as sweeten all of them, so elevate the nature of some of them,
spiritualize, as it were, your temporal ones, and so make them, though in
themselves (...) of vanity, and vexation of spirit, suitable un to the nature,
and desires of the soul. Dr Edward (...).
For the object of the lower part of the soul is then proportionable to the
higher part, unto the soul as reasonable, as spiritual; when linked with the
object thereof, God. And therefore temporal blessings are then proportionable
unto the soul as spiritual, when we behold Gods name written upon them, as
tokens of his love, when God comes along with them to the soul. For then,
though they be still temporal in regard of their nature, and being; yet are
they in a sense spiritual, as joined with God, the adequate spiritual good of
the soul, as directed by a supernatural providence to work unto a spiritual
end for the increase, exercise, and trial of our graces, for the bringing us
to true happiness; such as spiritual, and supernatural union and communion
with God.

We have gone over the first step of our thanks -- Observation, unto which the
second, Confession, must be as it were the Echo, and reflection, resounding the
same notes. What we have observed in blessings, we must confess too; as, That
we have them, Whence and How.

1. That we have them. This to deny, or smother, or but sparingly to discourse
of, what bewrayes it, but a loathnesse to acknowledge our selves engaged to the
Almighty? and yet in the acknowledgment of this we may be ample enough, and
all the while but vent our pride, and stroke our selves. Nebuchadnezar will
acknowledge a great Babylon, but withal add that it is built by the might of
his own power; and so we confess, (and perhaps beyond truth) the having of
such or such benefits; but then we (...) them to our selves, as either the
Authors, or deservers of them.

This indeed (to speak properly) is not Confession, but boasting, and bragging
of mercies. We must therefore, in the second place

2. Acknowledge that they come down from above, from the Father of lights
there, and that

3ly, By way of (...), freely -- (...) gratis (says Bernard) (...) merito,
(...) labor nostro, without our desert, without our endeavor: without our
endeavor, allwaies as the (...) cause, sometimes as the means. We reap
often, (as he in the parable) where we have not sown, and gather where we have
not strawed.

More freely yet; not only without, but against our deservings; for what are
our (...) except such as Augustine speaks of, merita mala? without our prayers,
against our hopes, beyond our desires. But should I insist longer on this
point, I should but anticipate what I am to deliver at large upon the fourth
general.

Dismissing it therefore, I pass on unto the third branch of our
thankfulness, Remembrance of blessings, which is almost nothing else but a
multiplied, and reiterated observation, and confession of them. And therefore
all three, Observation, (...), Remembrance, are wrapped up by Aquinas under one
head, Recognition. That which is forgotten is not actually known for the
present; nothing unknown works upon the will. A danger unknown moves not; A
Benefit unknown affects not. As the sacrifice of thanks then is kindled by
observation, blazeth in Confession; so memory of benefits keeps in the flame,
fetches life into it, though almost extinguished even as the fainting light of
a lamp is restored by a fresh supply of oil.

That charge then that David gave his soul, Psalm. 103. 2. we must ours.
Bless the Lord, o my soul, and forget not all his Benefits: that is, by an
ordinary Hebraisme, forget not any of all his benefits. But now in divine
dialect, words of knowledge do ever imply the affections: Our memory then of
blessings must be not only Historical, and speculative, (for that by it self
is dull, and lumpish, and will beget but a cold, and heartlesse thanksgiving)
but also practique, and affectionate, accompanied with such effusion of the
spirit's, dilating of the heart, such enlarged and enravish'd affections, such
stupor, and admiration, raptures of joy, melting into kindness, as are in some
measure proportioned, as unto the goodness, and quality of the blessings
themselves, so also unto the love, and bounty of God rellished in them; as
'twas said of her in the Comedy -- Laeta (...) non tam ipso dona, quam abs
(...) datum esse; id serio triumphat.

Besides a diligent Recognizing of benefits, which, as you have heard, is made
up of Observation, Confession, Memory, there is required unto thanksgiving.

A due valuation. 1. Of the worth, and greatness of God's gists in themselves.
Thankful then we can never be, if we either prize them not at all, or
underprize them: and yet herein how extremely fail me: Some there are amongst
us, that are very loud in their complaints against the greatest outward mercies
we can enjoy; They exclaim against the blessed work of reformation, as an
unsufferable innovation; against the plenty of preaching as an intolerable
burden: as the Israelites, Number. 11. 6. repined at their manna, saying there is
nothing but this manna before our eyes, so these men at the bread of life,
saying, there is nothing but preaching Sermons etc. As they, loathing manna,
lusted after the Cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic which they had
in Egypt; so these people, even fursetting on the good word of God, hanker
after those husks, I mean Superstitions, and Egyptian Ceremonies, with which
they were formerly fed. There are others that, as 'twas said of Israel, Psalm.
106. 24. despise, or as some read it, think scorn of this pleasant land,
professing a liking rather to live in any barbarous, remote nooke of the world,
with cleanness of teeth, and scarcity of bread, then here, where Gods mercies
swarm about us.

But some of us have more, though not grace, yet shame, then downrightly to
complain of God's mercies: yet all the best of us do much lessen their worth.
We aggravate our pettiest pressures beyond an Hyperbole; but then on the other
side, how do we extenuate, and diminish the worth of our greatest blessings?
(y) as the Cities Solamon gave Hiram pleased him not, and he said Dr Sanderson.
to Solamon, What Cities are these thou have given me? and he called them, the
Land of Cabul, that is, as you may see by the margin, displeasing, or dirty, 1
Kings 9. 12, 13. so Gods richest favors (...) us not, but ever we have some
quarrel or other at them, some flawes in them. How faulty we are in this
particular, St Basil illustrates, by a similitude taken from the eye: look, as
that sees not objects, which are applied close unto it, and even lie on it;
but taken away some pretty distance does clearly discern them; so we have no
sense or feeling of the worth of benefits we enjoy, until God by removal of
them, teach us to set better price on them.

But now our estimation is not to be bounded and terminated in the mercies of
God considered in themselves, according to their own worth, and goodness,
without reference to their ground, and Author; for so are we apt sometimes to
over-rate them, as the Epicure his pleasure, the covetous man his mucke, the
(...) his victory.

Therefore we must in the second place rightly prize the love, and (...) of
God the giver: for as (...). (...). q. 106 ar. 5. ad (...).
Aquinas tells us: A Benefit taken morally as laudable, worthy of (...),
however materially it stands in (...) in the thing given: yet formally and
principally it consists in voluntate and affectu in the will and affection of
the Donor. (...): Var. Hist. lib. 1. cap. (...).
(...) (...) accepted, largely requited a cup of water, which a poor man gave
him. Why? because he had an eye, not to the value of the present, but to the
good will of the giver: In like manner, would we but look on the meanest
blessings we enjoy, as tokens of Gods love, and goodness, how thankfully
would we accept them, at how high a rate prize them, how be even ravished with
the rellishing of Gods favor in them?

I proceed on to the last Degree of our thanks -- Retribution, not of Justice,
but of favorable Acceptance, that is, not such as God may expect; but such as
he in his Justice may, and in his mercy will accept. How can thou recompense
(says Ecclesiasticus 7. 28.
Jesus the son of Sirach) thy Parents the things that they have done for
thee? more justly may we demand. How shall we recompense our God the things he
has done for us? which infinitely surpass those of the most indulgent Father,
the tender'st Mother: for these, though great, yet but finite. A man's tongue
may reach them, at least his conceit may fathom them; but those are above all
expression, nay all thoughts.

(...) then, such as God in rigor of Justice may exact, is below Gods Majesty
to receive, above men's ability to give; Even the light of nature dictates (as
(...), grants) that man cannot, paria reddere (...).

And yet there are certain expressions of a grateful mind, which God is
pleased to interpret after a sort, as rendrings and retributions made to his
bounty. Else, what shall we think of David's (...)? Psalm. 116. 12. of
Hezekiah's not rendering again according to the benefit done to him? 2 Chronicles.
32. 24. Now of those almost infinite duties, which though they be, to speak
properly and strictly, nothing less, yet it pleases God for Christ his sake,
to accept as a requital. I Will specify but these few following.

1. Proposal of Gods honor, and Glory as our highest, and utmost aim in all
our Actions, all our sufferings. A virtuall Intention of this end is ever
requisite: and that the Schoolmen tell us may very well be without an actual
Advertency, and Consideration of it: even as in going a journey (says Aquinas)
it is not necessary that every step we tread, we should actually think, and
ponder upon the end of our journey.

2ly, A placid, and well temperd contentedness upon a final warning to part
with Gods blessings, either one after an other, or all at a clap, when either
Gods Providence takes them from us, or else his cause require them of us.

3ly, Consecration, and dedication of our blessings unto God, employment of
them for promoting of his glory, maintenance of his Cause, comfort of his
children, whom he has pleased to appoint receivers of his tribute. All the
Benefits we enjoy are, as Samuels, obtained of God: and therefore fit we should
make them, as Lemuels, dedicated unto God. If we have learning, we must write,
preach, dispute for his cause; if riches, spend them for his cause. Be we never
so mean, so poor, run, ride, and pray for his cause.

Lastly, A Resignation of our selves, lives, unto him, to be governed by him,
sacrificed for him, sanctified unto him: sacrificed for him in Martyrdom:
sanctified unto him in mortification. Unto the, former, a sacrificing of our
lives, we may never be called: the latter, a sacrifice of the corruptions of
our lives, must daily, hourly continually be offered. And in that consists the
life of our thankfulness.

By this time then you see that our thanks must not stay in words and
complements, but proceed on to a return of affections, and actions. It must be
Actio gratiarum, a doing, a working of thanks. David having Psalm. 106. 1. called
for praise, and thanks unto God, makes a stop and begins to correct himself,
verse. 2. as if he had called for an impossibility -- Who can utter (says he) the
mighty acts of the Lord? who can show forth all his praise? He makes the
answer verse. 3. Blessed are they that keep Judgment, and he that does
righteousness at all times: as if he should have said: Indeed none can as they
should render what praise, and thanks are due unto God, but he that comes
nearest to it, is the keeper of judgment, and doer of righteousness. He
answers not the question, as you may observe, directly, but only by (...). He
does not expressly tell us, who can perform the duty, but who injoyes the
reward, Blessed are etc. as if he should say. None indeed can perform this
duty of thanksgiving as they ought, none can sufficiently declare the marvelous
and merciful works of God: none can, shall I say, render, nay express what
praise, and thanks the Lord deserves. However if the performance of this duty
be real, and active, if we keep judgment, and do righteousness, this our
performance of it, though weak, and imperfect, shall find acceptance with, and
the reward of happiness from God. Blessed are they etc. We may then say of
gratitude as James of says- show it me by thy works, by thy works of piety,
and devotion unto God, of charity and Justice unto men. If these be wanting,
no matter for thy honoring of him in thy words: Thou really dishonourest him
in thy works, and Ward.
that which an evil, and harsh-sounding Instrument is to a good voice, that is
an unthankful life to a thankful mouth. Tacitus speaking of certain words of
Tiberius, says, they were Praeclara verba, sed non pro Tiberio, very excellent
words, but not suiting with Tiberius. The like may we say of forms of
thanksgiving utterd by ungodly men, they are very good and excellent in
themselves, but very much unbefitting them. (...).
For praise is not comely in the mouth of a sinner. Prove. 17. 7.
Prove. 17. 7. Excellent speech, or the lip of (...) (says Solomon) (...) not a
fool, a sinner. And the reason of it is that which Tacitus gave of his dislike
of other words of Tiberius, nec enim ad hanc formam caetera sunt. His other
actions are not of the same stamp, but of a far differing strain; sounding
forth Gods dispraise and dishonor in a louder accent, then his lips his
praise. No matter then for thy forms of thanksgiving, if thou want the power:
for thy singing a new song, if thou do not lead a new life. Canticum novum
and (...) homo male concordant, says Austin. A new song sounds very
illfavordly, loses much of its grace and relish from the old man's mouth.

And thus have I opened the nature of thanksgiving, about which if any think I
have stood overlong, let them weigh how vast the duty is, how many and large
it is parts are, each of which had I not severally, though briefly, saluted, my
discourse would have been lame and imperfect.

Hasten we next to the second General -- the Time, when the duty is to be
performed -- Always. Giving thanks always. This seems to be morally
impossible. And therefore we must distinguish betwixt thanksgiving, and the
effects of it. The effects and expressions of it may be perpetual, as lasting
as our lives. A principal one, Obedience unto God, styled a real
thanksgiving, the thanksgiving of the life may, must be so, Luke 1. 75: nay
sometimes signs of our thankfulness should outlive us: we should leave
behind us some pawn of our thanks unto God, some permanent expression or
other, that may even eternize them, transmit and convey them to succeeding
ages. But for this perpetuity of the fruits and effects of thanksgiving the
Apostle calls not here upon us. He is express for the duty of thanksgiving it
self -- Giving thanks always, etc.

How can that, you will say, be done?

Why thanksgiving, you must know, is either Habitual, or Actual.
1. Habitual (...): the Habit of thankfulness, a thankful heart, and
disposition must always be had, never laid aside, quoad (...) and
dispositionem animi; we must continually be thankful, our hearts should ever
be kept in so sacred a tune and temper, as that they may always be apt,
disposed, prepared for this work, so was David's. My heart is prepared, O God,
my heart is prepared, I will sing and give praise, Psalm. 57. 7. 2. Actual
thanksgiving: The act of thankfulness whether inward, or outward cannot be
perpetual. We cannot, indeed we are not bound to be always actually
thankful; for other duties are also required, and therefore must have their
turn as well as thanksgiving. Recourse therefore must be had to that old
golden Rule, Affirmativa (...) obligant semper, non ad semper. Affirmative
precepts do always bind, but not to always, so that we are not bound to
perform always what they injoyne, but only loco and tempore (...), where we
have due time and place. We are then always bound to give thanks actually
always; but then only when there is opportunity and seasonablenesse of doing
it. The word Always, then is to be taken, not in a Mathematical, but a
Moral latitude, and so it imports nothing but Frequency, and Constancy. And
this acception of the word is usual in Scripture. The Disciples of Christ are
said, Luke 24. 53: to be continually in the Temple prayseing and blessing God,
that is, frequently. (...). th thy masters Son shall (...) bread always at
my Table, 2 Samuel 9. 10. 2 King. 25. 29. Giving thanks always then, with our
Apostle, sounds no other than giving thanks frequently, and constantly.
First, then we are to do it (...), not for fits, and upon brunts only. Gods
hand is ever opened to bless us with an operative blessing; our mouth should
therefore be if not ever yet often open to bless him with a declarative
blessing.

He daily loades us with benefits, says David, Psalm. 68. 19. He (...). was his
mercy every morning, says (...). Lament, 3. 23: we may add, every hour,
every minute, every moment. No day, morning, hour, minute, moment comes over
our heads, but we have a fresh supply of them. We heve them continued,
increased, enlarged, old mercies renewed, new ones added. Is it not Justice
then, that we desire and strive to send him back as often a fresh return of
our praises: at least that we ingrosse up as much of our time as we can for
this business: that for it we think all our spare hours too sew? David
herein was exemplary, with him no time amiss, no season unseasonable for this
work. We have him at it as in the day. All the day, Psalm. 71. 8: seven times
a day, Psalm. 119, 164: all the day long, Psalm. 35. 28: so at night, in the
deepest of night. At midnight will I rise, and give thanks unto (...), Psalm.
119. 62.

2: Our thanksgiving must be, not only frequent, but constant, durable: not as
a flash, or blaze suddenly extinguished, but rather as the Vest all fire
among the Romans ever kept in. This permanency of our thanks was figured
(thinks Philo the (...)) by the fire upon the Altar; which, as you read,
Levit. 6. 13: was ever to be burning, never to go out. Intimated (say some) by
the binding of the sacrifice with cords unto the horns of the Altar, mentioned,
Psalm. 118. 27: for it is not only, lay the sacrifice, viz: of praise on the
horns of the Altar, but bind it, bind it with cords: and what so fast and
surely bound likely to hold.

Now for this we can assign no better reason then the constancy of God s
mercies, 'twas David's, Psalm. 89. 2. I will sing of thy mercy, says he, for
ever. Why? for I have said mercy shall be built up for ever: built up, built up
for ever; each term denotes a fixed and permanent state. His compassions fail
not, Lam. 3. 22. Neither should our thanks therefore fail, but be as lasting
as our lives; while I live, says David, I will praise the Lord, I will sing
praises unto my God while I have any being, Psalm. 104. 33. His compassions are
new every morning, Lam. 3. 23: and if so, then not fadeing: semblably therefore
let our thanks be still new and fresh, never dying, nay not so much as
languishing, decaying.

You have seen one extent of thanksgiving in respect of Continuance, always.
Another follows in regard of it is matter, for all things. Howsoever
thankfulness asks a sound Judgment to estimate duly of the value of
blessings, yet not any Invention to find them out, to do that a barren and
mean one will serve the turn. So we have a thankful heart we cannot be to
seek of matter: for with it all things will supply us giving thanks: for all
things, etc.

And we may give thanks for all things, either collectively, or distributively.

1. Collectively, jointly for all things together, when we heap the whole
matter of our thanksgiving into one lump, some such general form as: God be
praised for all his mercies. This we may, must do; but at this we must not
stop. We must go farther and give thanks for all things -- Distributively,
severally and apart: desire and endeavor we must to do it not only
distributively, pro generibus singulorum, for all sorts, ranks, kinds of
blessings; but also distributively, pro singulis generum, for all blessings of
all sorts and kinds whatsoever.

Labor we should to keep an exact bill and register of particular favors, and
for them to allot particular and several thanksgivings. When we come to count
our crosses, we reckon them distinctly, one by one, as how we have been
afflicted this way; how that; how crossed in such an action, disappointed in
such an enterprise, and shall we not be as punctual in our recognition of
favors, and distinctly blazon out the specialties of them too?

You see what a sea of matter even without bottom I have before me: All
things. Should I curiously run over but the heads of blessings, blessings
positive, blessings private; blessings temporal, blessings spiritual;
blessings in (...), blessings in reversion, and expectation, this discourse
would be enlarged far beyond my intention. I will only then propound, and
resolve two scruples, that hang by this point, and so dispatch it.

The first of them is, Whether or no God's greatness, absolute goodness, his
goodesse in himself, with other absolute perfections of his, as Truth and
power manifested in his works, be matter of thanksgiving, whether or no we
must be thankful for them?

For (...), we must presuppose there is a difference betwixt praise and thanks
(though we ordinarily use the words promiscuously.) We may you know praise
Strangers that never did us good tune, nay enemies who have done us many bad;
but we thank only benefactors. Any worth or excellency may be matter of our
praise, only benefits of thanksgiving. God then absolutely (...), without the
relation of (...) is invested with such attractive (...), and ravishing
beauties, as that he is, says David, worthy to be praised, Psalm. 18. 3.

Secondly, we must observe that a thing may be said to be matter of our
thanksgiving, either properly and directly, or else improperly, and by way of
reduction: properly and directly only God's relative goodness, his goodness
to us, the goodt hings we receive from him can be matter of our thanksgiving:
yet by way of reduction, and improperly God's absolute persections may be also,
as they have respect to those good things we enjoy: either as the fountain
from whence they flow, or as arguments illustrating (...), confirming their
communication, increase, Continuance to us. (...) tamen ad gratiarum actionem
(...) (...) iaudum (...), quae versatur (...) illas (...) quae in Deo ipso
(...), and in operibus (...) (...), sed cum respect (...) quodam ad illa, quae
accepimus, quatenus nempe persectiones illae sunt (...), vel (...) qued
accepimus (...), vel (...) nem ejus (...). Apoc 4. 8, 9. Ames (...): The (...).
(...). 2. (...). 9. 8.
And this of the first.

The second, whether or no we are to be thankful for afflictions?

For resolution. (...) are, we must note, either curses, or crosses. Curses are
the sad effects of divine malediction, and vengeance, punishments properly so
called, sor satisfaction of God's justice, and manifestation os his wrath; and
so but the prologue to the Tragedy of damnation, the very earnest, and pawn of
Hell, therefore matter of trembling and humiliation, not of joy and
thanksgiving. As for Crosses, (...) (...), not (...), which proceed from not
God's (...), but corrective wrath, or rather, tenderness, and compassion: As
for them God's Children must, say some, indefinitely be thankful for them.
Why? because they work for their good. Nothing does, or can betyde them, but
God turns it to their benefit. Afflictions are Physic for the soul, as to
cure it of present diseases, so to preserve it from future. Now (says
Chrysostom upon the 147. Psalm,) We observe our Physician not only indulging,
but restraining us of liberty in diet, exercise; not only anointing, but
burning, cutting us; not only when he gives cordialls, but when he administers
the most bitter pills, and potions. And shall God have no thanks for our
afflictions, whereby our corruptions are pruned, our diseases cured, our
holiness and happiness increased, our souls weaned from the world, pollish'd
for the temple, prepared for Heaven?

Thus many of the Sea Doctor Sclater on 1 These. 5. 18.
learned state the question (...) as for mine own part I dare not be so
general, but will distinguish betwixt crosses considered formerly in
themselves, as oppressions, and distresses of nature, and according to their
fruit, issue, and mitigation.

If we consider them formally in themselves, as crosses, as evils of pain,
tending either to the destruction, or trouble of nature, I see no reason, why
we should be thankful for them. For first, the matter of petition, and
thanksgiving is of the same latitude. Now we have no ground, no precept, no
president to pray for afflictions, as they oppress, and disquiet nature; nay
we have examples, and those unquestionable of declining them, withstanding
them, praying against them and therefore as little warrant to give thanks for
them.

Secondly, whatsoever is matter of thanks, must be matter of joy too; for joy
is not only a companion, but a cause of thanksgiving, both producing, and
conserving. Now crosses, afflictions, simply considered as such, are not,
cannot be matter of joy; for so considered they are of a destructive, malignant
nature; therefore neither of thanksgiving; for crosses we must (I confess) be
joyful, thankful, but not as they fall under the consideration of evils, as
they oppress and burden nature, for them so considered impossible we should;
Because evils as evils are undesirable, from them our natures and wills cannot
but be abhorrent, and that cannot be matter of our joy, which is undesirable,
and if not of our joy, then neither of our thanksgiving.

The reason alleged in the beginning to the contrary, viz: that crosses and
afflictions work together for the best to them that love God, is, methinke, of
no force. For all this they do not naturally, but by accident, by means of
God's wise, powerful disposing, and ordering of them: they are in their own
nature wholly destructive: it is the grace, power, mercy and providence of God
that makes them otherwise. He works good out of evil, light out of darkness,
beauty out of ashes. Now as things in themselves good, cease not therefore to
be the object of our prayers, and praises for that they are accidentally evil;
so neither, do things in themselves evil become to be just matter of thanks,
because they prove accidentally good. For the good that by accident flows from
crosses, we ought, I confess, to be thankful; not so for the crosses
themselves.

Moreover. 1. This reason holds as well for sins, as afflictions; because they
also are so ordered by God's overruling power, as that by accident they work
the good of his chosen.

2. The miseries and calamities of the Church by accident also turn to the
advancement of God's glory, to the bettering, humbling of his Church. But yet,
I think, we would count him a monster, a prodigy, and curse, who should still
rejoice, and give thanks simply for this, that Zion is afflicted, that the
stones of Jerusalem lie still in the dust; that her members are wallowing and
tumbling in their own blood.

But we are 2ly, to give thanks, though not for crosses themselves, yet for
their fruit, issue, and mitigation.

1. For their fruit and issue, that our souls are bettered, humbled by them,
drayn'd from their humors, sins, purged from their dross, winnowed from
their chasse. So we thank the Chy. rurgeon, not for that he cuts, burns, and
lances us, but because by these he heales us: the Physician not for the
bitterness of his pills and potions, but for the health they procure us. The 2
d: thing that in our crosses we must be thankful for, is their mitigation,
that they are mitigated in themselves, or in reference to us: First that they
are mitigated in themselves in regard either of their degree, or continuance.

1. Degree: that they are not extreme, unsupportable, but tempred with mercy,
that though God has thresht'd us with his slayle, beaten us with his staff or
rod, yet he has not broken us with his wheel, Is. 28. 27, 28.
Jeremiah in behalse of the Jewish Church acknowlegeth mercy, and therefore
matter of praise amid'st sore desolations. When their young and old lay slain
in every corner of the street; yet says Jerimy here is mercy. It is thy mercy
Lord that we are not consumed Lament. 3. 22.
that a remnant of us are left, all are not gone, that some of us, though but
an handful in comparison of the rest, are spared, not consumed.

2. Continuance, that as Job speaks of his comforts, they are swifter than a
Weavers shuttle, that heaviness is our guest but for a night, and then joy
comes in the morning.

But suppose our crosses in themselves extreme, most bitter, stinging, as
lasting as our lives, yet to us, in reference to us: there may be moderation in
them, and so cause of thankfulness for that they exceed not our comforts we
have to sweeten and allay them, our stock of grace, abilities of faith,
patience to undergo them, our deservings of them. Let our (...) be what they
will, we may still say with Ezra. 9. 13: they are less than our iniquities
(...): were we in hell we might say so: the torments there would come short of
our sins; were we there beaten with nere so many stripes, yet still it would
be with fewer than we have deserved: for still in what place, case, state
soever we be, it will be true, Deus praemiat ultra, punit citra, God always
rewards beyond, but he punishes on this side of our deserts, beneath our
iniquitics, as it is in the marginall note upon that forecited place of Ezra; He
deals not with us after our sins, nor rewards us according to our
Iniquities: for we in sinning have dealt with him as Traitors, and he in
afflicting has spared us as sons. And so much for this Question and the
third General.

From the object (...) the matter for which, pass we on the object personal,
the person unto whom we are to give thanks; unto God and the father. Here are
not meant two persons, whereof one God, the other father, but the same essence
or person is called both God and father: For usual is it with the holy Ghost,
as to express one and the same thing by diverse appellations, so to couple
those several appellations by the copulative particle (...) in which case the
particle does either redound, or signify nothing else but even: unto God and
the father then is all one with God even the father, or else God who is the
father: and the words may be taken in regard of us, or Christ.

In respect of us (as Zanchy and (...) a Lapide expounds them) they import a
general and special mercy of the Almighty, God the general, father the
special. For as God he blesses us only as Creatures, has created, does
preserve and govern us; as Father he blesses (...) as Sons, adopt's us in
Christ Jesus to an Inheritance in the heavens, which is says Peter, 1 Pet: 1.
4: incorruptible, undefiled, unfading.

Now if you understand the words in reference unto Christ, the word God is
taken not essentially, but personally for the first person in the Trinity, and
the word Father is added by way of explanation. So that this clause, God and
the Father, contains a description of the first person from two relations unto
Christ. One of God, the other of Father. He is the God of Christ as man, the
Father of Christ both as God and as man.

First, the God of Christ as man. How a God? for a God in a sense we know he
may be said to be, and is to all things whatsoever. To the Devils as they are
his vassals: Dr Edw: Reynolds.
To the wicked of the world as they are his prisoners: To the faithful more
especially as they are his subjects and followers: To Christ most especially. I
ascend says Christ, (...). 20. 17. to my God and your God: not our God in
common, but mine and yours by way of severance, to imply that he is otherwise
(...), and otherwise his, Ours by right of Dominion, as we are his creatures;
His (understand me still in reference to his humane nature) not only by right
of Creation, though so too; but also by special coven ant and confederation,
by predestination of his manhood unto the grace of personal union, by
Designation of him unto the glorious office of Mediator, by all the relations
of intimatenesse that can be named.

Secondly, the Father of Christ whether considered as God, or as man. The
Father of him as God, by eternal generation, begetting him in the equality,
nay numericall Identity of the same nature with himself. The Father of him as
man, not only in the largest and most improper sense, as he is the Father of
every creature, the Father of rain, and of the drops of (...), in (...). 38.
28. not at all by Adoption, for that is allwaies (say Civilians) personae
extrancae, and the manhood of Christ is taken into personal union with God the
Son. So that Christ, even as man, is (...) (...) personale God, and therefore
incapable of Adoption. Whereupon the Counsel of Frankford condemned Foelix,
and Elipandus ArchBishop of Toledo, for calling Christ in his humanity the
Adoptive Son of God; not at all then by Adoption, but by collation of the
grace of Union. For unto Christ's humane nature, by virtue of the Hypostaticall
union, the Primogeniture and Inheritance of all things is due, and as it were
connaturall. A congruence is there, that the man in whom all the fullness of
the Godhead dwells (...), bodily, that is personally, should be the first
borne among many brethren, the first borne of every creature, the heir of all
things.

Hitherto of both titles (God and Father) considered absolutely.

A word of them as they relate to our Thanks giving, giving thanks unto God,
and the Father. And so they distinguish our thanks, and praises from heathnish,
and (...) Doxologyes: The Heathen and Turk will give thanks unto God Almighty
maker of Heaven and Earth; this to give thanks but as creatures. The Jew will
give thanks unto the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but the Christian alone
to God the Father of Christ. This then the Christians Thanks giving.

But here observe, that the addition of Father is not exclusive of the Son,
and Holy Ghost, but inclusive rather; for they have all the same essence, and
therefore our blessings proceed from all three equally, undividedly, as from
one entire, indivisible, and coessentiall agent according unto that known
Maxim, Opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt Indivisa. Our thanksgiving by consequent
must be directed to each. Notwithstanding then the appropriation of it unto
God, as limited unto the person of the Father, we may justly infer the
Duenesse of it unto God indefinitely, and that unshar'd with any creature,
either in whole or in part. Indeed we may give unto the Instrument, that which
is the Instruments, provided withal that we give unto God that which is Gods.
The sword of the Lord, and the sword of Gideon, Judges 7. 20. but the sword of
the Lord had the upper hand; first the sword of the Lord, and then the Sword of
Gideon. We may then give thanks unto second causes, as unto the conveighers,
carryers, and messengers of Gods favors: But only unto God, as their Donor and
sender: for he alone the principal Author of them, and in him his mercy the
sole motive to confer them.

First, He their principal Author, the Father of lights, James 1. 17. from
whom not only every perfect, but every good gift comes down. The Apostle
alludes (think Interpreters) unto the sun in the firmament, that great
fountain of light, whence the Moon and lesser stars borrow all their
splendour. Now if God be the Alpha of our Blessings, if they come originally,
and primarily from him, just then is it that he be the Omega of our thanks:
that they be terminated in him, not directed unto secundary causes, either only
unto them and not him, or chiefly unto them above him, or unto them equally and
jointly with him, as far forth as unto him. Thanksgiving is an act of
Religion, whereby in an immediate, direct, and especial manner we honor God,
though not ad intra by an inward increase of his honor, yet ad extra by an
outward manifestation thereof: And in acts of religion God could never away
with corrivalty, and partnership, still he would have all or none at all: Hope
not then that a party, and shared thankfulness should now content him, who was
always so jealous of his glory. In the beginning he created the earth naked,
void, and without form, Genesis 1. 2. lest we (thinks Chrysostom) should ascribe
that beauty, and glory wherewith afterward it was apparreld verse. 12. unto its
own nature, and not his omnipotency, that made it out of nothing. In the
ceremonial law he commanded the Israelites not to lift up any tool of iron
upon any altar of stone they should erect, but to build it all of unhewen and
unpolished stones, Exodus 20 25. Deuteronomy. 27. 5. to intimate (says Rabbi Isaac)
that what ever blessings they obtained at the Altar, they should attribute them
not to humane endeavors, but merely to the good will, and pleasure of that
free spirit, which blows when, and where, and how he lists.

But farther: as we are not to detract, or defalk any thing from the
entireness, absoluteness, and plenarinesse of Gods praises, by rendering them
unto others: So neither

Secondly, by giving them to our selves, either wholly, or in part. We give the
commendation of a wise speech and saying unto, not the tongue that utters, but
mind that conceived it. For the fairness of a Character, not the pen, but the
hand, that guides it, is praise worthy: so the glory of benefits belong not
unto us, who possess them, but unto God that gave them: (The Illustrations are
not mine, but Bernards) for them no sacrifice to be offered to our own nets,
either of nature, or endeavor: as some, I remember, descant upon that place of
Habakkuk. The people that are with thee, says God to Gideon, Judge. 7. 2. are
too many for to give the Midianites into their hands, Why? lest Israel vaunt
themselves against me, saying, mine own hand has saved me. Should then Israel
have said mine own hand has saved me, they had vaunted themselves against God.
It Is Salvians note. Now (...) we make default two manner of ways: by
attribution of our blessings unto our selves, either as the physical and real
causes, the procurers; or moral causes, the deservers of them.

First, as to the physical, and real causes, and procurers of them. We
persuade our selves that we have won them propria Mart, by our hand, or
head, something in us; and therefore deserve to wear them. Aristotle tells us
of some, who had their eyes so depressed, and darkened, that they imagined
themselves to see in the air near unto them, as in a glass, their own
proper, and bodily figures. We, I am sure, have the eyes of our understandings
so blinded, and darkened, that we can see nothing in all the good we have, all
the good we do, but our own abilities and endeavors. But if it be plain that
nothing in us has gotten our blessings, that God is the sole Author of them,
then next we flatter our selves with a presumptuous conceit that we are the
moral causes, the deservers of them. That something from us, our desert,
holiness, has moved God to bestow them. Against this no so sovereign remedy,
as meditation upon the second thing above proposed.

As God the principal Author of blessings, so in him his mercy the sole motive
to confer them. And therefore those abilities and perfections, which the
Philosopher called Habits; St James stild gifts, James 1. St Paul 1 Cor. 12.
(...), grace gifts, or gifts not of Justice, but of grace: as they are a Deo
for the Dr Sanderson.
Author, so they are ex Dono for the manner; from God, and by way of most free
and Liberal Donation; although in the procurement of benefits there be a
concurrence of our abilities, our hand and head, power and wisdom; yet, if we
dig to the root, we shall find these abilities to be the free gifts of God.
For what have thou that thou have not received? 1 Corinthians. 4. 7, Could we
deserve, as we cannot, favors at the hand of the allmighty, yet in the last
resolution that desert would be of grace. For, whence but from God should come
power to deserve? But what talk we of desert! can God be (...) to any man? or
has any man given to him first, that it might be recompensed him again? Romans
11. 35. As for our parts we are not only (...), but male merentes, not only
undeserving, but ill deserving, and so every way lesser then the least of Gods
mercies. Not therefore unto us Lord, not unto us, not to our abilities,
endeavors, merit, but unto thee, and in thee to thy free grace and goodness,
be the honor and glory of all our blessings.

Well we have done with the party, to whom our thanks are to be directed, and
in whom terminated. I will but touch upon the last particular, the Mediator, in
whose name our thanks are to be tendered: In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
There is, first, neoessity of a (...), or mean to prefer our thanks unto
God: then congruity that Christ should be he.

First, need we have of a Mediator, whether we regard our selves, or our thanks.

First, our selves, who as Creatures are infinitely beneath God; as sinners at
odds, and (...) with God, enemies unto him, and therefore should not dare, in
our own persons, approach the pure eyes, and dreadful presence of so consuming
a fire, to present our selves or our thanks unto him. Especially considering,

In a second place. The blemishes of our thanks; Our thanks, alas, are seldom,
faint dull heartlesse, livelesse, like the sacrifice of Prometheus to Jupiter,
nothing but skin and bones, outside and formality, and therefore, of
themselves, unlikely to win acceptance.

A Mediator therefore necessary to take away the guilt of sin, from our
persons, by his merits, to hide the failings of our thanks by his intercession,
and so to win our persons access, our thanks acceptance to God.

This office not more needful for us, and our thanks, then Christ meet for it.
In the name, through the Mediation of none so congruously as of Christ, can our
thanks be given to God.

For, first, Decursus gratiarum, the streams of Gods bounty flow unto us, from
God, by Christ; Bishop Andrews.
from God, as the fountain: by Christ as the channel: and, therefore,
Recursus gratiarum, the return of our thanks, should be unto God, by Christ:
unto God as the object: by Christ, as the Mediator, or means in which
presented. If for his sake, by his means, merito Passionis, beneficio
Intercessionis, efficacia Operationis, for the merit of his passion, by the
virtue of his intercession, through the efficacy of his Operation God showreth
down his blessings on us, therefore in his name, through his mediation, should
we power out our Benedictions unto God.

Secondly, Thanks cannot be given but Adjutorio Christi, by help and (...)
from Christ, by assistance of his spirit, working in us, both the will, and the
deed: the will, the habit of thankfulness: the deed, the act of thanksgiving:
and therefore should not be given but Nomine Christi, in the name of Christ.

And there is a third reason too, on Christ's behalf, our Lord. He is ordained
to be a Priest for men in things pertaining to God, Heb. 5. 1. to offer
sacrifices for them, not only (...), and expiatory, but also (...) and
gratulatory sacrifices of thanksgiving: And as he is a priest to offer them, so
he has a (...) (...), and much (...) to sweeten, and purify them from all
sin adhering to them, and this seems to be laid down, Rev. 8. 3. for the
place by some of good note (...) Edw: Reynolds.
is expounded of Christ's Mediation and Intercession for his members at the
right hand of his Father, his bearing the Iniquity of their holy things, as
Aaron his Type was appointed to do ( Exodus 28. 38.) his covering all the
imperfections of their services, and procuring of them favor and acceptance.

Secondly, he has a golden altar whereupon to consecrate them, that is
besprinkled with the blood of that great sacrifice, which has more virtue,
merit, and welpleasingnesse in it, then there can possibly be demerit, and
malignity in all the corruptions and failings of our thanks. Meet therefore
that we bring, as all our sacrifices, so the sacrifice of praise and thanks in
particular unto this our high priest; so however of it self offensive in Gods
nostrils, yet, being (...) with his Incense, (...) by his altar, it shall
ascend up in an holy smoke unto Heaven; and as the Apostle spoke of Alms,
Phil. 4. 18. shall be an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, and
well-pleasing unto God.

Gentlemen,
I Have joined you together in this Dedication, to publish your Conjunction in
a very laudable, and Charitable action, The giving of a plentiful Exhibition
for the maintenance of a poor youth, Student in the University of Oxon; A rare
Example in these days in Gentlemen, of whom how few can the greatest
importunity win to spare any thing from their superfluities for so good an
use? But your Liberality was so forward, as that it needed no spur, nor
Excitation, only it called for direction unto a meet object. That this should
be published in Print, was a thing, I believe, you never desired, nor expected:
But though you do not expect the praises of men, as being acted by a higher
principle; yet you may lawfully accept them; provided, as Theseus dedicated
unto Hercules the Temples that were built in his own honor, so you do not
suffer these praises to be terminated in your selves; but carry them further,
and higher unto that God, who has given you hearts and estates for such a
work. There remains yet one thing to be done, and that is, that we all, you,
and I, join in sincere and unfeigned prayers unto God for his blessing upon
the studies of him, unto whom you have shown such Munificence; for though you
water this plant, it is God alone can give the increase; Unto this God I commend
you and yours, and rest

Yours to be Commanded in the things of Christ HENRY JEANES.

That Original Righteousness was in Adam Proved against Dr TAILOR.
ALl that I have to say concerning Original Righteousness shall be reduced
unto two heads. 1. An sit. 2. Quid sit.

First, Inquire we concerning its An sit; for the Socinians deny, that there
was any such thing, as you may see by what Socinus himself says, in his
Prelections, Chap. 3. and with him Dr Jeremy Tailor fully accords, in diverse
places of his books; [ Further explication of Original sin, page 461.] The
matter of Original Righteousness is a thing framed in the School forges; but
not at all spoken of in Scripture, etc. [ An answer to a letter touching
Original sin, page 5.] When the Luth^ran, and the Roman dispute, whether
justice, and Original righteousness in Adam was natural, or by grace, it is
de non ente. [Unum necessarium, page 380.] Innocence of Actual sin seems to
be that which Divines call Original Righteousness, there being no other
either taught or reasonable: who these Divines are, that he speaks of, I cannot
guess, unless it be his reverend friends, the Socinians, and some (...), that
tread in their steps; for, excepting them, the generality of both Protestants,
and Papists dissent from this conceit of his, touching Original
Righteousness; but the censure of Socinianisme is that which Dr Tailor
despises, and smileth at, as a trifling noise, a boys trick, a woman's
argument, etc: and therefore we shall oppugn his, and the Socinians opinion by
arguments, and they shall be taken from Scripture, and Reason.

First, From Scripture.

The first place is, Genesis 1. 26, 27. God said, let us make man in our Image,
after our likeness etc. and the principal part of this Image stood in
Original Righteousness, as is apparent by Paul's exposition thereof, Ephesians. 4.
24. Col. 3. 10.

A second place is, Genesis 1. 31. And God saw every thing that he had made, and
behold it was very good; man therefore was in his kind created very good: and
the goodness proper unto a (...) creature is a moral (...), the
righteousness which we here speak of: so that, it is impossible for man to be
very good, unless his understanding be full of saving light, truth, and
knowledge, and his will, affections, and whole man of holiness. Socinus [
praelect. cap. 3.] has here a very sorry shift: (...), ((...),) ibi non de
animi (...), (...) de justitia sermonem esse, sed de aptitudine and (...) ad
id, quod Deus (...) sibi (...). I Answer (says he) that by goodness is meant
the fitness, and convenience of every thing for that end, which God has
appointed: but, this is so far from infirming our argument, as that it rather
makes unto the confirmation thereof: because, as I shall show anon, man cannot
be fitted, and qualified for the end, unto which God has designed him without
a positive righteousness.

A third place is Eccles. 7. 29. (...) this only have I found, that God has
made man upright: the word translated upright, is jaschar: and that usually
denotes one, that is upright, not only with a negative uprightness, an
uprightness of innocence, an exemption from sin; but also with a positive
uprightness, an uprightness of virtue, purity, and holiness. Johannes Junius
(in his refutation of Socinus his Prelections) observes, that the (...) render
it here by (...), that signifies strait, or right, [ Matthew. 3. 3. Mark. 1. 3.
Luke 3. 4, 5: Acts 8. 21, 13, 10. 2 Pet. 2. 15.] elsewhere by (...), righteous,
or just, [ Prove. 17. 26. Numb. 23. 10.] by (...) good [ Deuteronomy. 12. 28.] by (...)
good, or fair; by (...) pure or clean [ Job. 3 3. 3.] and does not this
amount to more, then a mere innocence, a bare absence of vice? he notes as
much also concerning the Latin word rectus; (...) in line a non negat tantum,
sed and ponit aliquid. [Cicer. 1. Offic.] (...) autem officium, rectum opinor
vocemus, quod graeci (...). [Idem 2. de finibus.] quae autem (...) aut recta,
aut (...), facta dicimus, si placet, illi autem vocant (...), omnes numeros
virtutis continent, valet ergo idem quodjustum, ut cum Virgil. 1. Aeneid.
dicit, and men's sibi conscia recti.

But to pass on unto the New Testament; and there (by the Apostle Paul) we
have the particulars of that uprightness, and the image of God, in which the
first man was created clearly expressed: to instance first in that, which was
the leading grace unto all others, a true saving and sanctifying knowledge: and
that, man was endued with such a knowledge, when he was created, may be easily
concluded from, Col. 3. 10. And have put on the now man, which is renewed in
knowledge, after the image of him, that created him: here, that knowledge,
which is restored to man in his regeneration, has for it is exemplar the image
of God stamped upon man in his creation; and therefore Beza Est (...)
articuius, ut sit (...) quam ob causam sic malui interpretari, quam ad verbum.
secundum (...).
renders, (...), in agnitionem (...) imagini ejus, renewed in knowledge
suitable, and agreeable unto the image of God; the knowledge therefore of the
regenerate man represents, at least inpart, the image of God in the first man
when created, and consequently knowledge was a branch of that image of God, in
which the first man was created.

Dr. Tailor speaks detractingly of the knowledge of Adam in his state of
integrity [ Unum necessarium, page: 373.] neither can we guess ( says he) at
what degree of knowledge Adam had before his fall: certainly, if he had so
great a knowledge it is not likely he would so cheaply have sold himsefe, and
all his hopes (...) of a greedy appetite to get some knowledge.

But we may go further than guesses, and that with good warrant from
scripture; for.

First, God created man in his image: and, wheresoever the image of God is,
there is an assimilation unto God in understanding, wisdom, and knowledge,
though with great inequality.

Secondly, that this knowledge was, notitia (...), an affectionate practical
knowledge, that drew after it suitable affections, and actions, appears by
these four arguments.

First, because words of knowledge, in Scripture do imply answerable
affections, and practices.

Secondly, the word [ Coll. 3. 10.] is (...), and it is rendered, by latin
Interpreters, rather agnitio, than cognitio; not a bare knowledge, but
knowledge with an acknowledgement.

Thirdly, it could not be inferior to that knowledge, which is a part of the
new man; for it was the pattern, and samplar thereof: the new man is renewed
in knowledge after the image of God.

Fourthly, in the now quoted place [ Coll. 3. 10.] knowledge is (by a
synecdoche of the part for the whole) put for the whole new man; and the image
of God in the first man is, ( by a synecdoche of the whole for the part) put
for his knowledge: now, for these Synecdoches, what better, and more probable
reason can be assigned, thanthe connection of knowledge with the principal
parts of God's image, as in the new, so in the first man.

Thirdly, the scripture ascribes diverse things unto man, in his state of
innocence, unto which a very great measure of (...) was requisite: he was made
head of all mankind, Lord of the universe; he gave names unto all the cattle,
unto the sowles of the air, and to every beast of the field, Genesis 2. 20: and
doubtless, they were apt names, significant of their natures; because given by
appointment, and approbation of God himself: God brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them, and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
was the name thereof, Genesis 2. 19: besides, God created man for his service; the
Lord has made all things for himself (says the wise man) Prove. 16 4: to wit,
to serve him, according to the capacity of their several natures: now man's
nature was rational; and therefore his end was a reasonable service; and, to
guide him in the way hereunto, he had the law of nature written in his heart:
now all these particulars joined together required, even a fulness of
knowledge. Politic Princes on earth will choose none but wise, and prudent
persons for their deputies; and can we then imagine, that an omniscient God
made choice of an ignorant, and unknowing Viceroy? God gave him dominion over
the fishes of the sea, and over the foul of the air, and over the cattle, and
over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth:
and why should not his intellectualls hold proportion with his dominion, and be
as vast, and extensive? it is altogether improbable, that God should give him
so great, and large a scepter, and not qualify him for the weilding of it: he
was nomenclator unto the creation, and for such an office he was altogether
unmeet, if he were ignorant of the essences, and qualities of creatures:
doubtless, he knew the end, for which he was created; the duties, that were
injoined him; the light, and law of nature shone not more dimly in his breast,
when he was in his integrity, than it does in his lapsed posterity; and in the
worst of them, the law is written in their hearts, Romans 2. 15. We can do more
than guess at the dictates of right reason, or else we should be at a loss
touching all first principles, both speculative, and practical; and there is
no question to be made, but that Adam, before his fall, knew all the dictates
of right reason, and assented unto them, and therefore we are not, in such an
utter uncertainty, touching the knowledge Adam had before his sall, as Dr.
(...) would bear us in hand.

But let us weigh the Doctor's argument. Certainly if he had so great a
knowledge, it is not likely he would so cheaply have sold himself, and all his
hopes out of a greedy appetite to get some knowledge.

The answer is very easy, and obvious: This greedy appetite to get that
knowledge promised by the Serpent, was undenyably a great sin, and therefore
to say it could be in him before his fall, were a very gross contradiction:
for this were to affirm, that sin was in him in a state of innocence, when he
was without sin; that he sinned, before he sinned: and, if it were not in him
before his fall, I would know of the Dr. and all his admirers, how it can be an
argument against the greatness of his knowledge before the fall? It is a
common opinion among'st both Bellarm: tom: 4 (...). great: and stat: (...): lib.
3. cap. 5. versus finem.
Papists, and Protestants, that this greedy appetite proceeded, not from error,
or ignorance, but from incogitancy, inconsideration, or inadvertency.

But I proceed on unto the last place. Ephesians. 4. 24. And that ye put on the new
man, which after God is created in righteousness, and true holiness, here,
(by the consent of most Interpreters) (...), after God, is as much as, after or
according to the image of God and, by this interpretation, it will follow, that
the image of God consisted principally in righteousness and true holiness,
and these are so comprehensive, as that they take in all graces, and virtues
whatsoever: Junius [ in his conference with Arminius] speaks of some, who
understand that clause [ after God] concerning the power, and virtue of God,
working this righteousness, and true holiness: (...) contendam ( inquit) quod
multi interpretantur [ secundum Deum] ac si (...) Apostolus virtute Dei agentis
in nobis: But Dr. (...) [in his animadversions upon the said conference] tel's
Junius: first, that this interpretation is opposite unto his own interpretation
of the words, and then, he confesses his ignorance os any, that are the
authors of such an exposition: (...) contenderes, (...) ipsi contradiceres, ut
qui ad Genesis 1. 26: hac ipsa (...) (...), de imagine Dei in homine
interpreteris. Qui vero illi sint, qui contra instituunt mihi nondum (...) est
[pag. 39. cap. 1.] But, I shall further, unto this sense of the place, oppose
an argument from the signification of the particle [(...)] which here, in all
probability, rather denotes the relation of righteousness, and true holiness
unto it is (...), than unto it is cause, physically procreant.

By what has been said, the reader may be informed, how remote from truth an
other passage of Dr. Tailors is [ in his Unum necessarium, p362.] What gifts
and graces, or supernatural endowments God gave to Adam in his state of
innocence, we know not, God has no where told; and of things (...) we commonly
make wild conjectures.

God, you see, has told us, that he created man after his image, in knowledge,
righteousness, and true holiness; that he made him very good, that he made
him upright: now, whether the Dr. has the forehead to affirm, that all this
signifies noe gifts, graces, or supernatural endowments, which God gave to
Adam in his state of innocence? and what proofs he will bring, for so strange
an assertion, we will leave unto the issue?

Unto the above mentioned scriptures there are usually added two reasons: the
first, drawn from the end of the first man; the second, from the laws
prescribed unto him; for without a positive righteousness it was impossible
for him to reach this end; to obey these laws: but, of these two arguments, I
shall hereafter speak more fully, and therefore, for the present, I shall
pass on, from the Quod sit, unto the Quid sit of this original
righteousness, and here, we have a double Quid sit of it, to be inquired into:
Quid nominis, and Quid rei.

To begin with Quid nominis; why the righteousness of the first man is called
original righteousness.

Four reasons may be given for it.

First, because 'twas seated in the original, and parent of all mankind.

Secondly, because 'twas the first righteousness of mankind that ever was in
the world, it was before any other, either habitual, or actual.

Thirdly, because Adam received it from his very original; and beginning; as
soon as he was created, God created him in his image, after his likeness,
Genesis 1. 26, 27. God's image was stamped upon him the very first moment of his
creation, and his righteousness was the principal part of this image; God
made man upright, Eccl. 7. 29: he made him, and made him upright at the same
time, the essence of his soul was, in order of nature, before it is
uprightness, as being the subject thereof, and accordingly it was created
before it in order of nature, but yet this is no hindrance, but that the
creation of the essence of his soul, and the superinfusion of right. ousnesse
thereinto, might be simultaneos, in regard of time; unto these scriptures, I
shall only add a congruence out of the schoolmen.

All the other creatures were created in a perfect state, with abilities for
operations, suitable unto their respective ends, the herbs were created
yielding seed, and the trees bearing fruit, Gen: 1. 12, 29: congruent therefore
was it, that man the noblest of sublunary creatures, should be created in such
a state too; but, if he had been created without original righteousness, he
had been in a worse condition, than the meanest of the creatures; for, he would
have been unfurnished for the ends of his creation, the glorification of, and
communion with God, and destitute of the seeds of his glory, and happiness.

Fourthly, it is called original righteousness in respect of Adam's
posterity, because, if he had stood, it would have been coevall with the very
beginnings of their beings, and so they would have received it together with
their very natures: for, it was not given unto Adam only as a personal
endowment, but as a gift unto the whole humane nature, he had it as the head,
and representative of all mankind, and therefore his posterity were to receive
it, (in regard of the habits, that were the foundation of it) when they had
their humane nature derived from him: this the Schoolmen further confirm,
from (the opposite of original righteousness) original sin: original sin is
privatively opposed unto original righteousness, but because of the sin of
Adam all his posterity are borne in original sin, therefore if he had never
sinned all of them had been borne in original righteousness.

But to pass on from it is Quid nominis unto it is Quid rei, what is meant by
the thing it self; and for the clearing of this we shall explicate these seven
following particulars.

First, the materiale, secondly, the formale of it, which are (as it were) the
essential parts of which is consists: Thirdly, the subject in which it is
seated: Fourthly, the causation, or production: Fifthly, the effects of it:
Sixthly, the difference of it from sanctifying grace, seventhly, the manner of
it is relation unto the first man; whether it were natural, or supernatural to
him.

First the materiale, the matter, or foundation of it; and that was all the
moral perfections, all the graces, and virtues of the whole man; it was not one
single habit, but an aggregate of all those habits, by which man was rendered
right, and perfect, according to all his parts, and powers: Solomon says, that
God made man upright, Eccl. 7. 29: but upright he had not been, unless he had
been sanctified wholly, in spirit, soul, and body: the least deformity, or
defect had been inconsistent with his uprightness: the integrity, and
universality of the righteousness of the first man is by Arnd (as Gerard
insormeth us, (...): Th. ol: l. 2. p. 179.) resembled unto the beauty of
Absalom, 2 Samuel 14. 25. But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised
as Absalom, for his beauty from the sole of his foot, even to the crown of his
head, there was no blemish in him: so in all mankind there was never any so
much to be praised (Christ Jesus alone excepted) as Adam in Paradise; for his
beauty of holiness, from the sole of his feet, even to the crown of his head;
from his lowest (to wit,) his sensual faculties, unto his highest, his
intellectual faculties there was no blemish in him.

The Schoolmen generally affirm, that there were, in the first man in his
innocence, the habits of those virtues, whose acts did include an imperfection
repugnant unto that state, and they instance in repentance, patience, mercy,
etc. Suarez goes further, and affirms; that some, though not the chief acts
of repentance, and mercy, were consistent with the state of innocence. Licet
verum sit, non (...) has virtutes exercere in statu innocentiae potissimos
actus suos, nihilominus se^per aliquos actus exercere potuisset: Primo, actus
(...) conditionatos, ut in poenitentia esset hic actus, si (...) (...), in
misericordia, si proximus indigeret illi (...): Nam licet aliqui putent, (...)
actus esse potius intellectus, quam voluntatis, tamen esse possunt in actuali
(...) voluntatis de conditionato objecto. Imo illi conditionales non essent
(...) vere in homine, nisi fundarentur in actuali proposito voluntatis ejus.
Secundo, posset exerceri actus complacentiae circa (...) objectivam talium
virtutum. Tertio, specialiter virtus poenitentiae, quamvis non posset (...)
malum commissum posset odio habere peccatum, quod offertur ut committendum, and
habere voluntatem non (...) Deo injuriam. Misericordia etiam (...) semper, aut
per se requirit dolorem in miserente, nam voluntas sublevandi (...), si absque
dolor haberi p sset, revera (...) actus misericordiae. Hoc autem (...), si
status innocentiae duraret, posset unus (...) cadere, and alter innocens habere
voluntatem (...) illi, (...) displicentia de malo ejus, quae posset haberi sine
tristitia, (...) dolor. Et fortasse inter ipsos (...) non (...) occasiones
habendi (...) actus. Nam licet in illis non esset propria miseria poenalis,
(...) (...) aliqua indigentia naturalis, ut parvuli (...) auxilio majorum ad
educationem, and ad vitanda pericula, and ignorantes, (...) insipientes
indigerent doctrina. Ad (...) ergo modum non (...) ibi aliqua materia
misericordiae, and sic (...) de aliis similibus virtutibus facile (...). De
hom: creat: ac stat: (...): lib. 3. cap. 11.

Secondly, the Formale; the formality of this righteousness was (as Estius
notes in lib. 2. sent: did: 25. sect. 5.) not so much the aggregation, and
collection of those habits, that rendered man perfect, as the relation of (...)
resulting from them: original righteousness then was the rectitude of the
whole man, and all his powers in reference unto one another, and (in regard of
their acts it was) a relation of conformity of all in man unto the rule, the
revealed will of God: but hear Estius himself largely and clearly explicating
himself in this particular. (...) et si non sit dubitandum, quin (...)
originalis (...) bona vel omnia, vel (...) in primo homine habuerit conjuncta,
quod and futurum erat in posteris ex eo nascituris statu innocentiae durante;
non tamen justitiae nomine (...) proprie tale aliquod aggregatum, seu complexum
significari, sed potius rectitudo quaedam quae in toto homine ex partium ac
potentiarum ejus ordine atque optima dispositione consurgebat. Quare justitia
originalis ad omnes (...) habitus, seu dispositiones, ac perfectiones
potentiarum, videtur (...) habuisse tanquam relatio (...) ad rations fundandi;
ut non sit (...) is necesse, vel unum aliquem habitum, vel plures quaerere, qui
proprie sint, (...) constituant justitiam originalem, sed sufficiat intelligere
quo d homo secundum parts, and potentias suas it a fuerit ordinatus, ut
absolute rectus, ac justus (...), ut pote nihil habens in se inordinatum, (...)
(...) vitiosum.

Thirdly, what was the subject of original righteousness in which it was
seated? Scotus places it only in the will: because upon that depends the
rectitude of humane actions: Durand restraines it unto the (...) or (...)
faculties of the soul: because they only are regulated, and made subject unto
reason: But Illud (...) ex dictis colligi potest, quod (...) solet de subjecto
(...) originalis, de quo quidem, vary docti (...) putant. Sed (...) (...)
(...) and per se (...) (...), id est, relationem quandam, ut dixi, mus,
consequitur subject um originalis (...) esse (...) seu potentias inter se
coordinatas. (...) enim sive in corporalibus, sive in
spiritualibusintelligatur; existit in partibus eum inter se ordinem habentibus,
a quo totum quod ex illis constat, rectum dicatur.
Estius, in the place but now quoted, with better reason makes the subject of
it to be all the parts or powers of the soul; for rectitude (says he) whether
we understand it to be in corporals, or spirituals, existeth in the parts,
having that order betwixt themselves, whence the whole that consists of them is
denominated to be right, or strait: that was the subject of this original
(...), which was the subject of those habits, that were the foundation thereof:
now those habits were placed in all the powers of the soul, some (as
temperance, fortitude, and the like) were seated even in the sensitive
appetites: for these lower, and sensitive powers are capable of habits in man;
because in him rational, though not formally, yet by participation, as
obedient unto reason.

As for the body, this righteousness was not in it, as a subject, but only
reached it as an instrument: its members were weapons of righteousness: To
make the sensitive powers obedient unto the rational, habits were requisite to
be in them for determination of them hereunto: it is true, habits were requisite
to be in the sensitive powers, to make them obedient unto the rational; and,
without inherence of such habits, they could not be determined hereunto; but
now, there is no necessity for assigning any such habits in the body, to render
that readily subordinate unto reason; because, it is sufficiently determined
hereunto by those habits, that are in the faculties of the soul, directing,
and commanding its actions.

A fourth thing is the causation, or production of this original
righteousness: seeing it is a relation it cannot be created, or produced per
se, but ratione fundamenti, in its foundation, for neque datur motus neque
mutatio ad relationem per se spectatam; relations are all produced by the same
action, that their foundations are; and not by any new, proper, superadded,
predicamentall action: Thus, the likeness betwixt two white walls is produced
by no other action, then the whitening of them; and thus God made the first man
upright, or righteous only by the infusion of those habits, gifts, graces,
virtues, that were the foundation of this uprightness, or righteousness; for
man was denominated fundamentally upright, or righteous by them; though
formally by the relation of righteousness.

A fist thing is the effects of original righteousness: and these the
Schoolmen generally make to be three.

First, A subordination of the upper faculties of the soul, the understanding,
and will unto God: In his understanding there was no privative, or blameable
ignorance, but a clear, and full knowledge of God, and his law: his will was
clothed with grace, and holiness; it was created holy though mutable; so
that, though there was in him a possibility of sin, yet not the least tendency,
or inclination unto sin; as long as he stood, he adhered allwaies unto God,
and said, as the Psalmist, It is good for to draw near unto the Lord, Psalm.
73. last.

A second is a subjection of the inferior faculties of the soul unto the
superior; of the phantasy unto the understanding, of the sensitive appetite
unto the will: so that, in those inferior powers. there was no motion
unsuitable unto, either the dignity, or duty of man: The Centurion, Matthew. 8.
9. tells our Savior of the forward obsequiousness of his soldiers and
servants: for I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say
to this man go, and he goes, and to another come, and he comes: and to my
servant, do this, and he does it. Such was the ready and cheerful obedience of
Adams lower faculties unto his superior: His (...) were most likely to be
unruly, and yet they all, went, and came; were let out, and chained up;
intended, and heightened; slackned, or remitted; lengthned, or broken off
according to the directions of his understanding, and commands of his will.

A third effect of Original righteousness in Adam, was a regular subjection
of his body unto his soul: in regard whereof, it was an helpefull, and
serviceable instrument thereunto, as in all, so especially in its gracious
operations, those of piety toward God, and those of charity and justice
toward man: all the members of his body were weapons, arms, or instruments of
righteousness unto God, Romans 6. 13. servants to righteousness unto (...),
verse. 19. His eyes were as windows to let in good, and profitable observations,
from the creation of the world, concerning the invisible things of the Creator
his eternal power and (...), Romans 1. 20. 21. His ears were as the gate of
life, which, if he would, might have been shut, and locked against all evil,
and open unto all good: his tongue was as the pen of a ready writer, Psalm. 45.
1. ready to utter those things which a good heart had indicted: his hands on
every occasion were apt to be lifted up to God in prayer, and devotion, and
stretched out to man in actions of charity, and compassion: his (...) were
ready to be employed in any good errand, swift to run the ways of Gods
commandments.

The sixth thing I propounded concerning Original righteousness, was, the
difference of it from sanctifying grace: This is to be understood concerning
the Materiale, or foundation of Original righteousness: Some distinguish it
wholly, and altogether from the sanctifying grace of Adam: But such are by Sum.
The. (...). Tom. 1. Tract. 5. de homine in (...) Innocentiae Cap. 3. Qu. 2.
Becanus thus refuted: Original righteousness rendered our first Parents
righteous, and holy: But they, having no foreign righteousness to be
justified by, could not be righteous and holy without sanctifying grace;
Original righteousness therefore in them didinclude sanctifying grace: But,
though it did include Habitual Holiness, or sanctifying grace, yet Becanus
with others think, that it superadded something thereunto, and was not that
alone: so that it was distinguished therefrom distinctione includentis ab
incluso. It included sanctifying grace, and signified further such Habits in
the inferior faculties, as made them obedient unto the superior, and repressed
and prevented in them all Rebellion, and disorder, all irregular and disorderly
Motions. Becanus loc: praedict. for this produces an Argument, which stands
thus: Original righteousness had three effects, by the common (...) of the
Schoolmen, upon the souls of our first Parents. 1. Subjection of the superior
part of the soul, the understanding, and will (...) God. 2. Subjection of the
inferior and sensitive part of the soul unto the higher, and rational part.
3. The Ready Subjection of the Body unto the Soul; But now grace alone,
single, by it self had not these three effects, and therefore Original
righteousness was not only grace: but implied something else: The Minor he
goes about thus to prove; (...) sanctifying grace, in the state of innocence,
was of the same nature, and kind with our grace: But our grace has not these
three effects, but only the (...), and this he exemplifieth by Paul's complaint
of a law in his Members warring against the law of his mind, Romans 7. 23. that
is; of Rebellion in his body, and sensitive faculties against the higher, and
rational faculties of his soul: Paul's grace was (...) to repress this
rebellion; therefore we may conclude the same of Adam's too; and therefore
(Besides sanctifying grace,) there were (to this purpose, and intent,) further
requisite some gifts, or habits distinct from it.

For Answer: These two last effects of Original righteousness may be produced
two manner of ways, (...), or (...).

The grace of Paul, (and we may say the same of all regenerate Persons,) did
produce these two (...), but not in the same degree that Original
righteousness did in Adam; for it was imperfect, defiled by the coexistence of
sinful corruptions: and hereupon, it could beget in his material part, and
powers only an imperfect obedience unto his immateriall and spiritua'l powers;
But this obedience, though imperfect, is yet true and sincere. Grace
wheresoever it is can lay commands, and impose laws upon the senses, and
sensitive passions, as also upon all the members of the body: and can make
these laws, and commands to be obeyed in some measure. Job could make a
Covenant with his eyes. David could put a bridle into his lips: All the
regenerate (...) their Members instruments of righteousness unto God, servants
to righteousness, unto (...), Romans 6. 13, 19. Therefore their inherent
righteousness, and holiness has some domination, and rule over their
members; All rebellions and mutinies (such is its weakness and imperfection
(...) in this life,) it cannot possibly prevent; yet, when these flames break
out, it does what it can to allay, and compose them; it quenches them with the
waters of repentance, and so far prevails over them, as that it never
suffers them to enjoy a total, and (...) victory.

Indeed the grace of Adam preserved in the soul a full, and undisturbed
tranquillity, and gave reason, and the rational Appetite such a perfect
regiment over the body, and the inferior faculties, as that there was not in
them the least disobedience, or so much as reluctance unto the dictates of the
understanding, and motions of the will; and the Reason hereof was, because in
the grace of Adam, there was all requisite perfection (...) And, whereas
Becanus objecteth, that grace in the state of innocence was of the same nature,
and kind with that of ours: this is nothing unto the purpose: for, allthough it
be the same in point of (...), yet it falls far short of it in degree and
measure: and therefore is unable for the perfect causation of that, for which,
in the full, and persect grace of Adam, there was an ample sufficiency.

The seventh and last thing I proposed, concerning Original Righteousness,
was a question concerning the manner of its (...) unto the first man: whether
it were natural or supernatural to him in his state of innocence? some may
look upon it as an unnecessary nicety: but the Papists make it the foundation
of many dangerous opinions: for grant that original righteousness was
supernatural before the fall, they will hence inserre, that its contrary
concupiscence was natural: and from this again, they will conclude, that in
the regenerate it is not properly a sin, and consequently, that it is no bar
unto the absolute persection of their good works, and their justification by
them: and diverse other the like unsound, and (...) tenants: By a right stating
then of this question these errors will be forestalled: and yet it is strange,
what confusion, and mistakes there are in the stating of it, amongst both
Protestants, and Papists: Amesius (I confess) has, in a very short passage,
given me herein greater satisfaction, then I could find in the larger
discourses of others: His words are these Neque dicimus nos justitiam fuisse,
vel (...) (...) naturae physice, aut physico modo ex (...) principiis (...),
sed conditionem esse moralem, naturae illi debitam, quae ad just operandum
fuit creata. But this may be looked upon, rather as a general, and an obscure
hint, than a just determination of the question: and theresore I shall address
my self unto a more full handling of it: and in order hereunto shall premise
an Explication of these two terms in it, natural and supernatural.

The first term to be explained is natural: and this has many acceptions: a
thing may be said to be natural to man five ways; in regard; first, of its
(...) of his nature: (...), consecution, or emanation from it: or thirdly,
(...) unto it: or fourthly, connection with it: or fifthly, duenesse unto it.

First, a thing may be said to be natural unto man in regard of the
constitution of his nature: to wit: that which is a principle, or essential
part of his nature: his soul, and body, and all integrall parts of one of his
essential parts his body.

Secondly, a thing may be said to be natural to man in regard of consecution,
or emanation from his nature, that physically results, and flows from the
principles of his nature: and thus the properties of his nature are said to be
natural unto him, v. g. the faculties of the understanding, and will.

Thirdly, a thing may be said to be natural to man in regard (...)
suitableness unto his nature: and thus every ornament, or (...) suitable, and
agreeable to his nature: every thing that heales, perfects, adornes, or
advances his nature: all gracious and glorious endowments may be said to be
natural: for natural, in this sense, is opposed unto, not supernatural, but
that which is against nature, which is hurtful unto, or destructive of nature.

Fourthly, a thing may be said to be natural to man in regard of (...) with
his nature: to wit: that which he has derived unto him together with his
nature, in the same instance of time, though not of nature: and thus original
sin is said to be natural unto lapsed man, that is, connaturall, connexed with
his nature, from the very first receipt thereof: we were (says Paul) by nature
the children of wrath, Ephesians. 2. 7. that is, we were obnoxious unto wrath, as
soon as we received our nature.

Fifthly, a thing may be said to be natural to man in regard of duenesse to his
nature: without which his nature could not be created: and thus things due unto
man, are said to be natural unto man: because they do (in some way) resemble
natural properties in point of necessity: and are (in some sort) necessary
unto man: This acception of the word is found in some of the most learned
amongst the Papists, when they speak of other subjects: It is usually said,
that habitual grace was connaturall unto Christ's soul, as a property
consequent unto the personal union, though it did not result theresrom by any
physical dimanation, or real efficiency, but was immediately given thereunto
by Gods power and will: and this (...) cur (...) (...) haec (...) (...) (...)

(says he) may be said to be connaturall: not only, when they flow, and result
actively from an intrinsic principle: but also, when by an extrinsick agent
they are conferred juxta naturae debitum: so we say, that grace was called a
connaturall property of Christ God-man: because, from the worthiness of his
person, it was due, debito quodam proportionis connaturalis, by a debt or
duenesse of connaturall proportion, so that, it would have been a strange,
preternaturall, and prodigious thing, to have created the humane nature of
Christ, and to have joined it unto the person of the word, and not to have
replenished it with all the ornaments of divine grace.

This duenesse of a thing, unto the nature of man, is again twofold; either of
condecency, or of obligation.

First, A duenesse of condecency; and according unto that a thing is only fit,
congruent, convenient.

Secondly, A duenesse of obligation: and that again may be conceived to arise,
either from the merit of man, or else from some acts of God preceding, or
concomitant: for, though Gods will be most free, yet by one act he may
necessitate, and oblige himself unto another, either following it, or connexed
with it: Deus promittendo se feclt debitorem, is a proverb in Divinity: God by
his promises freely obliges himself: and we may say the same of other acts:
this is fully declared (upon another occasion) by Mr Hord, whom I take yet to
be our antagonist in this question: I grant (says he) [in his treatise
entitled Gods love unto mankind] that God is simply and absolutely bound unto
no man, he is agens liberrimum, a most free dispenser of his own favors, both
what he will, and to whom he will; but yet he is conditionally: determinavit
seipsum: he has bound himself to give supernatural abilities to men by three
things.

First, Decernendo, the Almighty is eternally subject to his own decree, or
else he would be mutable, and therefore what gifts soever he has decreed to
men, he is bound to give them by virtue of his decree.

Secondly, Promittendo, we use to say promise is debt, it is justice to
perform, what it was free to promise: if therefore God has made a premise of
any gift or grace to men, this promise binds him to performance.

Thirdly, Legem ferendo; by giving men a law to keep, which, without
supernatural power, they cannot keep any more then they can eat a rock: by
such a law the Allmighty Lawgiver binds himself to his creatures, to give
them such power as may enable them to keep that law, or else he becomes the
true, and proper cause of the transgression of it.

From the first term, natural, pass we on to the second, supernatural: A
thing may be said to be supernatural to the first man, either in regard of its
original, or else in respect of the manner of its inhesion in, or agreement
unto its nature.

First, in regard of its original and efficient which is produced immediately
by God, without the concurrence of any creature.

Secondly, in regard of the manner of its inhesion in, and agreement unto the
nature of man: and so, that is said to be supernatural, which resembled such
supernaturals, as were unnecessary unto man's nature, without which his nature
might well be created.

Having thus explained the terms, the question may be divided into two parts,
according unto the two parts of the predicate.

First, whether or no original righteousness were natural unto the first man
in his state of innocence?

Secondly, whether it were supernatural?

First, whether it were natural? and here I shall lay down

First what is uncontroverted on both sides: Then secondly, what is
controverted.

First, what is uncontroverted on both sides:

It Is granted by Protestants

First, that original righteousness was not natural unto man constitutive,
it was no principle constituting his nature.

Secondly, that it was not natural unto man consecutive, in regard of
emanation, or consecution from his nature. It was no property physically
resulting from the principles of his nature.

Now, for both these concessions there is usually alleged this one reason,
because that, which is natural in either of these senses, is inseparable:
things thus natural remained even in the Devils, and so also in lapsed man,
his fall did not take away, either the principles or properties of his nature:
but original righteousness remains not in lapsed man, and therefore it was
not natural, as either a principle or property of nature; Bellarmine therefore
[ De gra: prim: hom. cap. 5.] does but calumniate, when he makes this acception
of natural to be that, of which the question is to be understood Quarto
natural vocatur, quod aut est pars naturae, aut fluit a (...) naturae. Qua
significatione (...), and animus facultates quoque, tum sentiendi, tum
intelligendi, and operationes quae ab iisdem facultatibus exercentur, naturalia
esse dicuntur. Atque haec est signisicatio, de qua hoc loco proprie disputamus.
And yet here, it cannot be denied, but that some Protestants have herein
expressed themselves very unwarily, rectitudo quam primus homo in (...)
accepit, was, (says Maccovius) Naturalis hec significato quo facultas
sentiendi, videndi, cap. 44. loc: com: and there is a passage in Tilenus [
Syntag: lib. 1. cap. 33. sect. 17] that sounds very harshly this way. Tam
nature. lis primo parenti haec justitiae originalis qualitas fuit, quam ipsa
natura, and forma substantialis, per creationem accepta: unto these I may join
also our own Willet, for he makes natural in the question, to be that, which
was either a part of man's nature, or did arise, or spring out of some natural
beginning, as we say the soul in the body, and the understanding in the soul
are natural.

From the grants of Protestants proceed we unto those of Papists, here

First, they grant, that original righteousness was natural to man in regard
of connection with his nature, it was concreated with: and this is confessed by
Bellarmine, Primum natural dicitur id omne, quod habetur a nativitate, qua
signisicatione dicimur filii irae, Ephesians. 2: and hoc modo justitiam originalem
fatemur dici posse naturalem. Sed haec significatio ad quaestionem praesentem
non pertinet, (...) quod natural hoc modo acceptum non opponitur
supernaturali, cum tam naturalia, quam supernaturalia dona possint haberi a
nativitate, ut notum est. De gra: prim: hom: cap: 5.

(...), they grant, that it was natural unto man in regard of suitableness
unto his nature, it was a perfection very agreeable unto a reasonable creature.

Nay thirdly they go further, and seem (as I think) to affirm, that it was
natural in respect of duenesse unto nature, if we speak only of a duenesse of
condecency: thus much may be gathered from these following words of Bellarmine
[De gra: prim: hom: cap 7.] Respondeo, aequum omnino fuisse, ut Deus homini ad
finem tam sublimem ordinato media necessaria non negarit: For he cannot deny,
but that original righteousness was a necessary means unto man's chief end.
Now all these three concessions of the Papists are by Greg: de valentia [tom.
2. disp. 6. 15. punct. 1.] thus briefly summed, Donum originalis justitiae
natural ab extrinseco dici potucrit, quatcnus and naturae hominis ab initio
ingenitum erat, and ei congruebat, and (...) (...), atque roborabat ad recte
exequendas operationes omnes bonas natura humanae a bitas: Or (as he expresses
it in a second assertion) Ad exequendum sine disicultate, etc: (...) natural
virtutum earum, quarum actiones lege naturae praecipiuntur, and praescribuntur.

There is another grant that I shall premise, which (I believe) is agreed on,
both by Papists, and Protestants, and that is; that original righteousness
was not due unto man's nature in a way of merit, there was nothing in man's
nature, that merited it.

The Question then proceeds only concerning a (...) of obligation arising from
some acts of God, and may be thus propounded: whether or no original
righteousness were not natural, that is, necessary unto the first man, in the
state of innocence, necessary though not absolutely, yet, ex hypothesi, upon
supposall of some acts of God? or whether God did not by some acts oblige, and
necessitate himself unto the enduing of the first man with original
righteousness?

Where the assirmative, which is our conclusion shall be made good, by
instancing in three decrees of God, by which he had bound himself to give the
first man, in the state of innocence, original righteousness. First, his
decree (...) the goodness with which he intended to invest him. Secondly, his
decree concerning the end unto which he designed him. Thirdly, his decree
concerning the Laws unto which he intended to oblige him.

First, his decree concerning the goodness with which he invested him: man,
as the rest of the creatures, was created very good, Genesis c. 1. v. 31: and
consequently, God decreed to create him very good; for he works all things
after the counsel of his own will, Ephesians. 1. 11. But now he could not be made
good, much less very good, unless he had been created with original
righteousness; for moral goodness is that, which is proper and agreeable
unto a reasonable creature, and therefore, without this righteousness, man
could not be morally good: presupposing therefore God's decree to make man very
good, it was impossible to create him without original righteousness.

Secondly, his decree concerning the end which he prescribed, and designed unto
him: for the utmost end, unto which man was appointed, was the glory of God,
Prove. 16. 4: and his own eternal happiness, consisting in the beatificall
vision of God's essence, and the eternal fruition of his glory, even the light
of reason dictated this only to be the supreme end of man and all other ends to
be unsatisfactory, below the nature of his spiritual, and immortal soul:
God's giving man a capacity of this end was a sufficient intimation that it was
to be the chief end, which he was to aim at; hereupon also was it, that there
was naturally in man a desire of this end and no other end could give
satisfaction unto his infinite, and boundless desires; so that Bellarmine
himself sticks not to affirm that it was natural unto man, Quoad appetitum,
though not, Quoad consecutionem. Now God by thus designing man unto this end,
and placing in him a natural appetite thereunto, engaged himself to furnish
him with all necessary means, abilities, and qualifications for the compassing
of it; for, qui destinat ad sinem, destinat ad media; and original
righteousness was (undoubtedly) a qualification absolutely necessary for such
a purpose; and, if he bad been created without it, he had been made, not only,
a little lower than the Angels, but beneath the very beasts that perish; below
the most contemptible worms, that crawle upon the face of the earth, for there
is none of them destitute of such furniture, as is requisite, for the reaching
of their respective ends.

Thirdly, his decree concerning the Laws unto which he intended to oblige him:
he intended to write the Law of nature in his heart as soon as he was created;
and accordingly it was written; so that, from his creation, he was obliged unto
several duties, but it was impossible for man to perform acceptably these
duties without original righteousness, and therefore, God by his purpose to
impose these duties upon man, determined himself to enable him for them, by
making him habitually upright, and holy: for if he should have enjoined,
impossible commandments where there was no ability for obedience, he had been
a very unjust Lawgiver, like Pharaoh, that exacted brick, and would not allow
straw: God's purpose to create such a creature as man, with the rational
faculties of understanding, and will, implied a purpose, to oblige him to
serve, obey, and glorify him as his Creator; and this again implied a purpose
to enable, and qualify him for such service, and obedience: and was not
original righteousness a necessary qualification: for this. Man no sooner
knew, that he was a poor creature, dependant upon the All-mighty maker of
Heaven, and Earth; but he forthwith understood, that he was, by the Law of
creation, without any positive superadded Law bound, to love this his Maker
above all things with all his soul, heart, might, and strength; to love
himself, and all other things in reference unto him, to (...) all his
voluntary, and rational actions unto his Glory, at least virtually: but now
all these duties were unfeasible without the virtue, or grace of the love of
God, and therefore, from God's purpose to to oblige man unto these duties, we
may conclude, his purpose to (...) into him the habit of love: and what we say
of the acts, and habits of love may be applied unto the acts, and habits of
other graces. Si quis per debitam intelligat (...) ex hypothesi (...) and
voluntatis divinae, de (...) creatura, a qua (...) (...) obedientiam persectam,
negare non possunt adversarii, tali sensu, (...) (...) primaevae naturae, qui
gratiam universalem eamque sufficientem, debitam (...) homini in statu lapsus
constituto, ex hypothesi, non verentur (...). Certe legem quandam naturalen:
(...) (...) inditam ab initio, fatentur nobiscum adversarii. Si data (...)
homini (...) naturae, cur (...) non dicendum erit, debitam fuisse homini
creando (...) qua ad legem unplendam (...) erat? debita ergo fuit, per
intentionem, and voluntatem divinam, quia voluntas sinis, necessariam, and
quasi debitam facit voluntatem mediorum ad (...). Rivet. in Genes. (...). 7.
page 34. 35.
This Medium the Arminians generally make use of to prove, the (...) of
universal grace: Because God has commanded all men to believe, and obey,
therefore he has bound himself to give every man power to believe, and obey:
Their abuse of this argument it is not now pertinent to examine, only, I cannot
but observe, the inconsistency of it with their opinion in the now controverted
question: for Arminius, and his followers generally hold, that original
righteousness was not natural, that is, due, and necessary unto man in his
innocence: But for resutation of this their denial we need no other medium,
but that now mentioned, which they bring for universal grace: for that with
due change will sufficiently serve our turn: God commanded man in the state of
innocence actual righteousness, therefore he had bound himself to furnish
him with original righteousness, therefore original righteousness was
necessary and due unto man in that state, and that is all we mean by the word
natural.

There be diverse other arguments, usually alleged by Protestants, which I
shall for the present wholly wave; only, I cannot but take notice of one, (that
is urged by Macovius, and others) from the remainders of this original
righteousness in man since the fall: these are now natural unto man;
therefore original righteousness it self was natural to man before the
fall; but this argument has a tang of Pelagianisme: there be relics of Gods
image in man in his corrupt, and unregenerate condition; but none of original
righteousness; for this was wholly lost, and extinct; supernaturalia erepta,
naturalia corrupta: however then, there be left some shadows, and resemblances
of it, yet not any true remnants of it: even Arminius himself in his
conference with Junius confesses, that there be not left in us so much as any
principles, or seed of spiritual virtues. Dico agnition millam quae est (...)
pietatem, justitiam illam, and (...), de qua Apostolus non corruptas sed
sublatas esse, null aque earundem in nobis post lapsum manner principia. Fateor
principia and semina virtutum moralium, quae anologiam quandam and
similitudinem habent ad istas spirituales virtutes in nobis manner post lapsum,
quin and ipsas morales virtutes; licet per (...) corruptas. Haec similitudo
fallere potest non accurate inter hasce and illas spirituales virtutes
discriminantem. In hac sententia mea, qua statuo illa bona esse ablata, habeo
praeeuntem (...) nostrum questione. 9: his verbis: Homo se and omnem
posteritatem divinis illis (...) orbavit: Quae autem sint illa divina (...),
explicatum est quaestione sexta praecedente, nempe, (...) and sanctitas.

But what congruence this has with other principles of Arminius I leave to be
determined by his disciples.

Before I take my leave of this part of the question I shall desire the Reader
to take notice that, besides Henricus de Gandavo, there have been many learned
Papists of the opinion, that original righteousness was natural to man in
his state of integrity: so much you may see at large in Estius: [ in l. 2.
sent: did. 26. sect. 6.] who reckons up distinctly seventeene of their
arguments: indeed they take original righteousness (in a stricter sense than
we) only for the subjection of the inferior faculties unto reason; but yet
even herein, they are opposite unto the generality of Papists, as well, as we.

But proceed we unto the second part of the question: whether or no original
righteousness were (...) unto man in his state of innocence?

And here we readily grant, that it was supernatural to man, in regard of
original or (...), for God immediately produced it, and it did not, could not
flow from any principle of nature: this concession is made by Dr. Twisse in his
animadversions upon the conference of Arminius with (...), page 36. 37, etc:
and there justified by him at large against Junius, but though this be a very
plain, and evident truth, yet Arminius does very weakly confirm it, as
appears by Dr. Twisse his examination of all his arguments.

But there is one argument of Videris mihi non recte imaginem Dei confistentem
in justitia, and (...) a supernaturali gratia excludere. Licet enim illud donum
homini collatum sit in creatione, and simul cum ipsa natura, ita enim (...)
pono, tamen supernaturale est, and (...) hominis naturam excedens: quod probo
ab actu regenerationis, qui est gratiae supernaturalis. Quum enim regeneratione
opus sit ad illam (...) and sanctitatem recuperandam, quae (...) est actio
supernaturalis: (...) est (...) (...) homini initio collatam fuisse (...)
supernaturali. Armin:
his, which he urges, not only in the place cited, but also in his Examen of
Perkins, page 587: that merits in a special manner to be remarked, not so much
for the strength, and solidity of it, as for the facetiousnesse of Dr. Twisse
his answer to it: Arminius his argument stands thus: that which is restored
unto man by the supernatural action of regeneration, was at first
supernatural, and bestowed upon man by a supernatural action; but holiness,
and righteousness is restored unto man by a supernatural act, to wit,
regeneration, therefore it was at first supernatural in it self, and bestowed
upon man by a supernatural action.

We shall pass over the greatest part of Sin Perkinsius (...) non modo hac
ratione naturalem esse, sed and alla, nempe tanquam ex (...) naturae
profluentem, prorsus nihil obfuisset haec ratio (...) a regeneratione sumpta.
Neque enim sequitur, quia qualitas aliqua producitur action supernaturali in
statu naturae corruptae, (...) fuisse etiam supernaturalem in statu naturae
integrae. Etenim non paucis restituit Christus sanitatem corporis action
supernaturali, nec tamen (...) (...), sanitatem corporis non fuisse Adamo
naturalem; Action supernaturali restituebat aurem (...), quam Petrus
praeciderat, (...) tamen (...) aurem illam sive dextram, sive sinistram, non
fuisse Malcho naturalem.
Dr. Twisse his answer, and only pitch upon what he says unto the major, which
he invalidates by two instances. Christ restored unto many health of body, by a
supernatural action, it does not therefore follow, that health of body was not
natural unto Adam before his fall: it was by a supernatural action, that he
restored unto Malchus that ear, which Peter with his sword had cut off, but it
does not therefore follow that this ear was at first supernatural unto
Malchus.

But leaving Arminius his argument, we confess that original righteousness
was supernatural unto Adam, if you respect the principle of it, and thus it
was supernatural unto Adam, not only per accidens, but also per se, it neither
did, nor could flow from the principles of nature.

That then, which alone is Id tamen monemus nostros non negare absolute, (...)
fuisse justitiam originalem; non solum, comparate ad (...) praesentis naturae,
sed etiam ratione prioris status, quia etsi natutalis (...) quomodo diximus,

exerc. 7. p. 35.

We say that this (...) (...) essentially required to the (...) of nature. So
that there is no state of sole and pure nature, without addition of sin or
grace, as the (...) fondly imagine, for that the nature or man is such, as must
(...) be lified above it self by grace, or (...) below it self and be in a
state of sin. Field of the Church page 137.

We say that original righteousness is said to be a supernatural quality,
because it grows not out of nature, and because it raises nature above it
self, but that it is natural, that is, required to the integrity of nature.
Neither should it seem strange to any man, (...) a quality not (...) out of
nature, should be required necessarily for the perfecting of natures integrity,
seeing the end and object of (...) desires, knowledge, and action, is an (...)
thing and without the compass and bouuds of nature, ibid.


controverted, is, whither or no original righteousness was supernatural
unto Adam in his state of innocence in respect of the manner of it is inhaesion
in, and agreement unto the nature of man? whether the nature of man, could have
been created without it?

Here the Papists generally aver that man might have been created in his pure
naturals without original righteousness, nay that the contrary of original
righteousness, concupiscense would naturally have flowne, and resulted from
the codition, and very constitution, or composition of his nature, and such
resultancy was prevented, and stayed by the supernatural gift, or grace of
original righteousness: to illustrate this their opinion, they use diverse
(...), they compare original righteousness unto a rich robe, or garment,
which God threw upon man, to cover his natural nakedness; so that the state
of man, after the fall of Adam, differs no more from the state of Adam, in
his pure naturals, than a man that is spoiled differs from a naked man; they
farther resemble it unto a garland, set on the head of a Virgin; as also unto
Sampsons locks; for look as a garland is not necessary required unto
virginity, nor the strength that lay in Sampsons locks unto humanity, so
original righteousness (say they) was no necessary requisite unto the
integrity of man's nature: a Virgin may be a Virgin, though no garland be put
upon her head, and when the garand is taken away her virginity remains
untouched, and unblemished; (...) had been a man, though no supernatural
strength had layne in his locks, and he remained a man still, when that
strength was departed from him: thus (say they) man might have been created in
his pure naturals, without the addition of original righteousness, because it
was not required nececessarily sor the perfecting of his natures integrity; and
therefore, when this original righteousness was taken from him he was only
reduced unto the condition of pure, and sole nature, and his naturals were no
ways vitiated: original righteousness was (say they) as a sovereign
antedote against concupiscence, which would have been a natural disease unto
man; as a golden bridle to restrain, and keep in that fierceness, rebellion,
and unrulinesse of the inferior faculties, which otherwise would naturally
have been unavoidable; it was (say they) as a precious (...), that made bright
the nature of man, and kept it from that rust, which necessarily would have
grown upon a nature, so framed, and compounded, as ours was: (...) [ in lib.
2. sent. 32. (...). 1.] out of Anselme likneth original righteousness unto
the (...) of a ship, when the rudder of a ship is wanting, or broken, how can
the Pilot guide it? will be in perpetual peril of being dashed, or split upon
rocks, and quicksands: thus, if man had been created in his pure naturals
without original righteousness, he had been as a ship without a rudder; so
that he could never have steered the vessel of his soul unto it is wished end,
the haven of heaven; for it would have been, in continual danger of
shipwreck, by the wind of every sensual passion, and desire: thus you see how
dishonourably they speak of the nature of man, which yet was the master-peice
of the creation, and made (as it were) by the consultation of the whole
Trinity; God said, let us make man in our image after our likeness, Genesis 1. 26.

In opposition unto this doctrine of the Papists, I shall lay down (...)
conclusions; wherein I shall wholly lay aside the term supernatural, and
speak only to the thing and matter: and indeed it were heartily to be wished,
that the terms natural and supernatural had never been used in this
controversy: for they have brought no light unto it, but occasioned only a
strife of words.

The first (...) shall be: It was hypothetically impossible for man in the
state of innocence to be created with the contradictory of Original
righteousness, to wit, the negation and absence of it.

The second conclusion: It was (...) impossible for man to be created with the
contrary of original righteousness, concupiscence and inclination (...) sin.

To begin with the first conclusion: It was hypothetically impossible for man
in the state of innocence to be created with the contradictory of original
righteousness, to wit, the negation, and absence of it: of more briefly: It
was hypothetically impossible for man to be created without original
righteousness; I say hypothetically, in respect of Gods ordinate power,
presupposing those decrees of God mentioned in the first part of the question:
First, his decree to make man very good: Secondly, his decree to prescribe him
so high and glorious an end, as the glorifying, and enjoyment of himself, an
infinite good: Thirdly, his decree to impose upon him several laws, obedience
to which might bring him unto the said end. for, without original
righteousness, it was impossible for any of these decrees to be put in
execution: without it impossible, that he should be made (...) good: for what
goodness is correspondent unto a rational creature, but a moral goodness,
righteousness and true holiness? without it impossible, that man should
obtain the end prescribed unto him. that he should perform the duties
injoined him: and it was against the justice and goodness of God, and so a
gross contradiction to appoint unto man an impossible end, to impose upon man
impossible commandments: Gods chalking out such an end for man to seek,
implies, that he supplied him with means for assecution hereof: his
injunction of laws argues, that he gave power and ability to yield obedience
unto them: but of this already more fully, and distinctly in the first part of
the question.

Unto what is there said, (...) me add what Dr Field [in his learned book of
the Church page 251, 252, 253.] has, in resutation of this fiction of the
Papists, that man might have been created in his pure naturals, in a state of
neutrality and (...), (...) (...) grace or sin; his argument may briefly be
thus summed up.

It was impossible for the nature of man, without grace, to perform its
principal actions, about its principal objects, the sirst truth, and the
chiefest good; without grace 'twas impossible for man to know God as he ought,
to love him as he should, amore amicitiae, with a love of friendship, for
himself, and his own sake, and without such a love all a man's actions would
have bin sins; for they could not have been done unto the glory of God; because
it is such a love only, that refers man's actions unto Gods glory; and that
state cannot, but be a sinful state, wherein all that a man does is sin:
briefly thus, without the grace of God it is impossible to love God; and without
the love of God all our actions will be evil and sin, and therefore a primo ad
ultimum without grace all our actions will be sin; and hereupon 'twill follow,
that there can be no state of nature sinlesse without grace; and consequently
that there can be noe state of pure or mere nature.

For the surther clearing of this I shall lay down two (...) which cannot
reasonably be denied.

First, that God decreed, that man should act rationally, that he should
perform rational actions.

Secondly, that all his rational actions were under the law of nature; some
for their substance, as to love, sear, praise and glorify God; and others for
their (...), and other the like (...): whether a man did eat or drink,
whatsoever he did, he was to do all unto the glory of God: to deny this were
to uncreature man, take away his dependence upon, and relation unto God: and
from this grant, (it undeniably follows that) all a man's rational, or
voluntary actions were capable of moral goodness, or badnesse, and
consequently, that, how ever some of them might be indifferent in their
general, and abstract (...), yet considered actu exercito, as singularized,
and clothed with circumstances, they were all either morally good, or evil;
for moral goodness and badnesse are privatively opposite, and it is an
unquestioned rule in Logic, inter privative opposita non datur medium in
subjecto capaci; Between privative opposites there can be no middle, either of
abnegatien, or participation in a capable subject; every subject capable of
privative opposites must necessarily have one, or the other: thus a sensitive
creature must be either seeing, or blind; the air must be either lightsome, or
dark: now if there could be no indifferency, or neutrality in the rational
actions of man, but that they must all necessarily be, either good, or bad;
then it was impossible there could be any such state of indifferency, and
neutrality in the rational faculties of man; they must also be morally either
good, or bad, holy, or sinful; and therefore the possibility of man's
existence in a state of pure naturals, without grace, or sin, has no
foundation in sound reason.

The second conclusion: It was absolutely impossible for man to be created with
the contrary of original righteousness, concupiscence, a pronenesse, or
inclination of all the faculties of man unto sin.

This conclusion is thus confirmed: if man had been created with this
concupiscence, God had been the author of it; but 'twas impossible for God to
be the author of it; the Apostle John says, it is not from the Father, but is
of the world, 1 John 2. 16: we may go farther and say, it could not be from
the Father, and therefore it was (...) for man to be created with it.

The Minor is thus proved it was impossible for God to be the author of sin,
but concupiscence is sin, and therefore God could not be the author of it.

Unto this argument we find in Bellarmine two answers.

First, that God would not have been the author of this concupiscence, though
man had been created with it.

Secondly, that this concupiscence is not sin, and therefore, though God had
been the cause of it, yet it would not have therefore followed, that he had
been the cause of sin.

First, that God would not have been the author of concupiscence, though man
had been created with it, but it would have been besides his purpose and
intention: for it would (says he) have flowne naturally from the condition of
the matter of man, and so it would have been natural unto man, not as a good,
gift, or ornament, of nature, but as a defect, disease, or infirmity of nature:
he endeavors to illustrate this by the similitude of a Smith: though a Smith
frame a sword of Iron, and the sword grow rusty, yet the rust is not caused by
the Smith, but proceeds, as a sequel, from the nature, or quality of the
Iron, that is the matter of the sword.

But this answer is, first, dissonant from the truth: secondly, repugnant unto
Bellarmines own principles.

First, dissonant from the truth, and that I shall clear by three arguments.

The first argument: Causa causae est causa causati in (...) subordinatis, the
cause of a cause is the cause of its effects in things essentially subordinate,
but God is the cause of the nature, and matter of a man, and (by the opinion of
Bellarmine) concupiscence is essential to the nature, and matter of man (...),
and a (...), for it would naturally, and necessarily (thinks he) have resulted
from the nature, and matter of man, but that it was supernaturally prevented by
the gift of original righteousness, and consequently God must needs be the
cause, and author of it.

A second argument is: because, this concupiscence is not only in the
sensitive, and inferior, but also in the rational, and superior faculties,
in the understanding and will: St. Paul Coll. 2. 15: speaks of a fleshly mind,
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, so then there is flesh in the very mind of
man: the carnal mind (or the minding of the flesh) (...), is enmity against
God, Romans 8. 7: remarkable is that saying of Augustine, voluntas sine charitate
est tota vitiosa cupiditas, without love, the will is as it were wholly turned
into lust, that is, wholly depraved and defiled with lust: he thinks then,
that lust might be seated in the will, nay Caeterum negandum non est, etiam in
part superiore simile vitium (...). Nam ea quoque animi (...) prona est ad
concupiscendos (...), inanem (...), and (...) vanitates, and, (...) nolimus,
interdum parit ejusmodi desidetia. (...) B. (...) in (...). ad (...). cap. 5.
cum (...) carnem concupiscere adversus spiritum, (...) enumerans opera (...),
non solum nominavit fornicationem, (...) and alia id (...) sed etiam (...),
(...), (...), etc: quod diligenter notavit S. Augustinus lib. 14. (...) civ.
cap. 2. 3. and 4: ubid. (...) carnem interdum accipi pro toto homine, qualis
est, (...) Dei, post lapsum Adami, and (...) dici carnalem, qui secundum
seipsum, non lecundum (...) (...). (...) quo in explicatione Psalm. 79: dicit,
omne (...) (...) ex cupiditate male inflammante, vel ex (...) male humiliante.
Itaque concupiscentiae vitium licet praecipue in (...), tamen etiam in mente
sedem habet. de amiss. great. and stat. pecc. l. 5. cap. 15.
(...) himself though he think that concupiscence has it is chief residence
in the flesh, (by which he means the body, and the sensual powers of man) yet
he withal (...), that there is something like unto it in the superior part of
the soul; for even that is prone immoderately to desire honors, vain glory,
and the like vanities; and therefore Paul Gal. 5: having said; that (...) (...)
lusts against (...) spirit; he names, not only fornication, drunkenness,
and the like carnal sins; but also idolatry, heresies, envyings, etc: which
were spiritual sins, sins of the upper region of the soul: thus you see,
that a great part of concupiscence is placed in the supreme, the rational
faculties of man; and extended unto spiritual, and immateriall objects: and
hereupon it will follow, that (at least) this part of concupiscence cannot
(...) from the condition (...) the matter.

A third argument is, because this assertion (that the resultancy of this
concupiscence from the nature, and matter of man would have been besides the
intention of God) strikes against, either the omniscience, or omnipotency of
God: for, either God foresaw this resultancy, or not? to say, that he did not
foresee it, takes away the infiniteness of his knowledge; if he foresaw it,
then I demand whether he could not? or would not prevent it? to say, that he
could not prevent it, denies the infiniteness of his power; if he could, but
would not prevent or stay it, then it follows, that this resultancy was not
besides, but agreeable unto his purpose, and intention.

Secondly, this answer is repugnant unto Bellarmine his own principles: I shall
instance in two.

First, it is apparent; that he makes this concupiscence, to be chiefly, the
natural, and necessary propension of the sensitive faculties, unto their
proper, and natural object: and from this I thus argue.

Natural, Concupiscentia vocatur a Bellarm. cap. 5. (...) carnis ad bonum
corporale, and sensibile, in quod fertur per sensum and appetitum, propensio
autem rei ad suum (...) natural, est (...) naturae, non desectus, non morbus,
nec ex materia pendens, sed ex illa causa, quae singulis facultatibus (...)
indidit propensiones. 2. Praeter intentionem Dei non factus est (...) mo animal
vivens, cum omnibus illis propensionibus quae animalis naturae convenient.
Ames. Bell. (...). tom. 4. page 11.
and necessary propensions of the natural faculties of any thing, unto their
natural, and proper object, cannot be besides the intention of God, the
creator; for such propensions must needs be positive qualities; and of every
positive being, God is the cause, and author.

But now concupiscence is (by Bellarmines discourse) the natural, and
necessary propension of the sensitive faculties of man unto their proper, and
natural objects: And consequently, it is not besides the intention of the
Creator, flowing as a natural defect, or disease, only from the condition of
the mould, or matter of man.

A second thing in Bellarmine, with which this his answer clasheth, is his
confession; that concupiscence is contrary to the nature of man [de gratia
primi hominis cap. 7.]

From hence I thus argue. Adversarius expressis verbis cogitur (...) concupi.
(...) illam (...) naturae contrariam. Ex quo sequitur, id quod est purae
naturae contrarium, idem simul secundum puram naturam natural esse non posse,
nisi quis velit, lucem and tenebras simul in (...) ponere, and aliquid esse,
and non esse contra (...) notiones asserere. Qui ergo concessit, cum natura
pura concupiscentiam carnis and sensuum (...), necessario (...) debet, si sibi
(...) velit, concupiscentiam naturalem esse, seu ex puris naturae principiis
emanantem, and contra concedere, (...) illam naturae congruam, quae rebellionem
tollendo, naturam perfecit, naturalem (...), quod nos asserimus. Est ergo in
verbis Bellarmini foeda contradictio, dum unam and eandem concupiscentiam,
ratione unius and ejusdem naturae, naturalem simul and naturae contrariam
dicit. Omne enim (...), vel quod (...) ex naturae principiis, naturae non
contrarium, sed consentaneum est; vicissim autem, quod contrarium, hoc natural
non est. Rivet. in Genes. Exerc. 7. page 35.


Nothing, that is against the nature of man can (...) naturally, and
necessarily from the principles of his nature.

But Bellarmine confesses that this concupiscence is against the nature of
man; And therefore he contradicts himself, when he affirms, that it results
from the principles of man's nature, the condition of his matter.

As for the similitude (of the Smith, and the Iron sword) that will be nothing
unto the purpose: for

First, no Smith whatsoever can make Iron, that is the matter of a sword, but
God alone is the author of the matter of man, and consequently is the cause of
all the natural sequels thereof.

Secondly, a Smith, if he could, would frame such a sword as might not be
subject or inclined unto rust, but it is not a thing in his power, for he
cannot alter the nature of Iron, so that, if he will produce an Iron sword, it
will be liable unto rust: The Papists seem to ascribe such an impotency unto
God himself; for they suppose all along, that God cannot make man to be
compounded of a reasonable soul, and sensible matter, but that, (besides the
intention of God) the natural, and necessary result of such a composition
will, (without supernatural prevention,) be a headlong inclination unto
sensible objects, against the dictates of right reason: but the falsehood of
this supposition I shall anon at large detect.

A second answer of Bellarmin's ( which we frequently sind also in Dr. Tailor,)
is, that this concupiscence is not a sin, but only a disease, languer,
infirmity, or (...) of nature, and therefore, though God had been the cause of
it, it would not yet have followed, that God was the author of sin.

Unto this I shall oppose the clear testimony of Paul, who (in 6, 7, 8.
chapters of his Epistle unto the Roman's) cal's it sin fourteen times, as
Bishop Davenant, and Dr. Francis White (after Bishop of Ely) calculate the
places.

But unto all these places Bellarmine replyeth, ( in which reply he is seconded
by Dr. Tailor) that concupiscence is called sin, by the Apostle, not properly
and formally, but (...), because it is the effect, and cause of sin, the
effect of Adam's first sin, and the cause of our sin.

But, that concupiscence is properly and formally a sin, I shall prove
against both Bellarmine, ( and his confident second Dr. Tailor) from it is
influence, subject, adjuncts, opposites.

First, from it is influence, mediate, and immediate.

First, from it is mediate influence: it is the cause of all actual sin
whatsoever, whenever we are tempted to any sin, we are enticed, and drawn
away by our own lust, this is the mother that conceives and brings forth all
sin, Jam. 1. 14, 15: and doubtless the daughter resembles the mother, the
cause and the effect have the same nature: that which as a habit or quality is
the cause of sin, must needs be sin too; but concupiscence, or the
original pronesse of our natures unto sin is the root of all sin; and
therefore (to use the Apostles expression) it is exceeding sinful, Romans 7. 13:
for, nil dat, quod non habet vel formaliter vel eminenter: But, for
confirmation of this argument, we have the testimony of him, who is the truth
it self, Mat. 7. 17, 18. A corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit, a good
tree cannot bring forth evil fruit; now concupiscence, or an inclination unto
sin, brings no fruit, but that which is morally evil, and corrupt; and
therefore it is a tree morally evil, and corrupt: but this argument I shall
insist on more fully hereafter in opening, Jam. 1. 14, 15.

Secondly, from it is immediate influence: it naturally, and directly produces,
as it is immediate effects, those first motions unto sin, which are without
consent; and therefore, if we can prove these first motions unto sin to be
sin, our adversaries will confess, that concupiscence is sin also: now,
that they are sin, may be concluded from the Apostles description of sin, 1
(...) 3. 4. Sin is the transgression of the law; for the first motions unto
sin trespass against that, which our Savior cal's the first, and great
commandment, thou shall love the Lord with all thy soul, might, mind and
strength; for if sin, God's greatest enemy, has, any motions, or
inclinations of the soul, any thoughts of the mind, God is not loved with all
our soul, and mind; and the soul is faulty, when it is divided betwixt God,
and sin: their heart is divided (says the Prophet) now shall they be found
faulty, Hosea 10. 2. This argument Dr. Abbot Bishop of Salisbary (brings in his
defense of Mr. Perkins his reformed Catholic against Dr. Bishop, page 187.
188.) He erreth (says he) in that be makes Original (...) to (...) only in
the integrity of the will, and the form of sin to stand only in the aversion
of the will from God, by the (...) of the same original justice, whereas
original justice was in truth the integrity of all the parts of (...), not
subjecting the (...) to the mind, and the mind to God, but (...) whole man to
God, the image whereof is set forth unto us in the commandment, Mar. (...). 30.
Luke 10. 27.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy mind, with
all thy soul, with all thy thoughts and strength. The form of sin
therefore, is not only in the aversion of the will, but in the aversion of any
part, or power, or faculty of the soul: if in any of these there be a
declining from the law of God, it is the sin of man. Now Cum est (...) (...)
concupiscentiae carnalis quod vel continendo (...) non (...) (...) tota anima
diligitur Deus. August. de perfect. justit. Rat. 17.
(...) so long as there is any matter of concupiscence to be yet (...) and
restrained, God cannot be loved with all the soul (for how can (...) have all
the soul, so long as concupiscence has any part?) therefore in the (...) of
any matter of concupiscence, there is sin; because it is sin, when either
there is not love at all, or it is less than it should be, when it is not with
all the soul.

But further; as these first motions, and agitations of concupiscence are
virtually, and implyedly contrary unto our Savior's summary, of all the
commandments, of the first table: so they are particularly and, expressly
forbidden by the last commandment of the second table, the tenth commandment
that God here deals with the first motions, and thoughts of the heart is the
sense of Bishop Andrews upon the commandments: and Dr. Tailor cannot say,
that he was a Calvinist, or Presbyterian. But this his exposition has for it
very good (...); because those motions unto sin, which are consented to, are
forbidden in the several commandments, as appears by our Savior's gloss
upon the seventh commandment, Matthew. 5. 28. Now, if they be forbidden in the
several commandments, it is unlikely, that there should be alloted, for the
prohibition of them, a distinct commandment, considering how short a breviary
of man's duty the (...) is: Indeed Ames rightly holds, that the first motions
unto unjustice are here only expressly forbidden; but, from the forbidding of
them, we may conclude, by way of proportion, the prohibition also of the first
motions, which are against the duties of religion, and (...) commanded in the
first table.

But, though the first motions of concupiscence had not been forbidden by any
written law, yet it is sufficient to make them sin, that they are repugnant
unto the light of right reason, for this is truly, properly, and univocally the
law of God, the law of nature written in the hearts of all men, and, as for the
repugnancy of the first motions of concupiscence unto right reason, it cannot
be denied, if we instance in those, which are in the sensitive powers of man
against the dominion of his mind: and so much may be gathered from what Aquinas
acknowledges concerning concupiscence it self [ part. 3. quaest. 15. art. 2.]
Ad rationem fomitis, inquit, pertinet inclinatio sensualis appetitus, in id
(...) est contra rationem, and again afterward [ ad 1 m] ratio somitis
consistit in resistentia sensualis appetitus ad rationem; and [ ad 2 m] fomes
peccati importat concupiscentiam delectabilium praeter ordinem rationis. This
reason is urged by Augustine, to prove concupiscence to be, not only a
punishment and cause of sin, but also sin it self: the concupiscence of
the flesh, against which the good spirit striveth, is a sin (says he) quia
inest illi inobedientia contra dominatum mentis, by reason there is in it
disobedience against the dominion of the mind.

A second argument, to prove that concupiscence is a sin, and not a sinlesse
infirmity, is taken from the subject of it: It is only found in sinful men,
such as are descended from Adam in an ordinary way of natural generation:
Hence now I thus reason.

All sinlesse infirmities, so they were general unto our nature, and not
personal, were found in the humanity of Christ, for he was made like unto us
in all things, sin alone accepted.

But concupiscence was not in the humanity of Christ, (as is confessed by the
generality of Papists.)

And therefore it is not a sinlesse, and natural, but a moral, and sinful
infirmity.

Unto the Major the Papists give an answer (I confess) which I have upon
another occasion, replied unto in my treatise of the incarnation, page 103. 104.

The Minor Dr. Tailor seems to deny [in his further explication of original
sin, page 494.] his words I shall transcribe, and then give what reason I
have for my suspicion: If concupiscence, which is in every man's nature, be a
sin, it is certain Christ had no concupiscence or natural desires, for he
had no sin. But if he had no concupiscence, or natural desires how he should
be a man, or how capable of law, or how he should serve God with choice, where
there could be no potentia ad oppositum, I think will be very hrd to (...)
understood: Christ felt all our infirmities, yet without sin: All our
infirmities are the effects of the sin of Adam, and part of that which we
call original sin, therefore all these our infirmities which Christ felt, as
in him they were for ever without sin, so long as they are only natural, and
unconsented to, must be in us without sin: for whatsoever is naturally in us
is naturally in him; but a man is not a man without natural desires, therefore
these were in him, in him without sin: and therefore so in us, without sin
I mean, properly, really, and formally.

Here, I expect to be cold, that the Dr has explicated concupiscence by
natural desires: But now I demand, whether, by natural desires, he understand
the desires of the sensitive appetite after meat, drink, and and the like? if
he does, then, he speaks nothing to the purpose, but fights with his own
shadow; for those whom he opposes, (...) and Calvinists hold such desires to
be lawful, and indifferent, and never affirm, that they were in themselves
sin, unless vitiated by circumstances: but, to prevent his shifting, and to
sift out his meaning, I shall propound unto him this following Dilemma: either
he speaks of concupiscence in that sense it is understood by Protestants and
Papists in this controversy, or not.

If not; then he plays the egregious (...), and runs away (...) the
question; and whither such a trifler be meet to reform the Divinity of
Christendom, let any man judge.

If he say, that he takes concupiscence in such a sense as Papists and
Protestants understand it in the controversy, then I shall assume the boldness
to tell him, that to say, that it was in Christ, is an assertion guilty of
(...) falsehood, and palpable blasphemy; for both sides take this concupiscence
to be a pronenesse, or inclination unto sin, (as will be confessed by every
one that knows any thing in the controversy:) and that a pronenesse, or
inclination unto sin was in Christ's humanity is a proposition apparently,
not only false, but also blasphemous against the purity, and persection of that
holy one of God: this I shall evince by two arguments.

First, an inclination unto sin could not be where there was not so much as a
possibility of sinning.

But, in Christ's humanity, there was not so much as a possibility of sinning.

Therefore much less an inclination unto sin.

This is one of the arguments reckoned up by Estius, Christus potuit assumere
naturam humanam in (...) naturalibus; non potuit autem assumere
concupiscentiam, rebellionem (...) contra spiritum, pronitatem peccandi,
difficultatem bonae voluntatis. Sic enim sequeretur eum peccare (...) (...)
pronitas (...) suppoint posse peccare, in lib. 2. sent. did. 25.
which those dissenters from the usual, and general opinion, of Papists, and
Schoolmen, which he speaks of, do allege.

A second argument, an inclination unto sin in any degree could not be in
that wherein there was a total and utter aversen sse from sin in the highest
degree, (for of contraries, if one be in the highest and most intense degree,
it is not consistent in the same subject with it is fellow contrary, so much as
in a remiss degree:) But, in Christ's humanity, there was an utter and total
averseness from sin in the highest degree, for there dwelled in him an
allfullnesse of grace, Col. 1. 19. Joh. 1. 14.

And therefore there could not be in Christ's humanity an inclnatination unto
sin in any the least degree, much less such an impetuous inclination unto
sin, as Papists affirm concupiscence to be.

A third principal argument is taken from the adjuncts of concupiscence, ab
adjunctis occupatis: it is to be crucified, destroyed, and mortified, Gal. 5.
24. Romans 6. 6. to be hated, as being hateful, not only unto good men, butunto
God himself.

But, nothing is to be thus dealt with, but sin, Concupiscence therefore is
sin.

The fourth principal argument is drawn from the opposites of concupiscence:
First, the Law of God: Secondly, the grace of God in general: Thirdly, the
love of God in particular.

First, the Law of God: it warreth against the law of the mind, Romans 7. 23:
that is, (as Estius upon the place) adversus legem Dei, against the Law of God
in which Paul (...) after the inward man, verse. 22. Est enim (inquit) eadem lex
Dei and lex mentis, sicut e diverso eadem est lex peccati and membrorum. Ex his
verbis recte colligitur concupiscentiam etiam quae in (...) est, repugnare and
contrariam esse legi Dei, quia ad instar legis ad ea quae legi divinae
contraria sunt, impellit: the law of God, and the law of the mind are one, and
the same thing: as one the other side the law of sin, and the law of the
members: from these words then it may rightly be gathered, that even that
concupiscence, which is in the regenerate, is repugnant, and contrary to the
law of God, because, as a law, it impelleth unto those things, which are
contrary unto the divine law.

Unto this place let me add also To: 8. 7: the carnal mind, or the minding of
the flesh, or the wisdom of the flesh, (...), is enmity against God, for it is
not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be: the putting of the
abstract for the concrete, enmity for enemy signifies, that it is a very grand
enemy unto God; and it is an enemy unto God only, because it is opposed unto his
law, and revealed will: suppose, it be not a branch of concupiscence, or the
flesh, but only an affect or fruit thereof, an actual sin (as Bellarmine
determines) yet; first no probable reason can be given, why (...), the minding
of the flesh should be so restrained as to exclude the first motions of the
flesh, or concupiscence; and if they be enmity against God, then so also is
(...) original, the flesh or (...) too.

Secondly, whatsoever is meant by this (...), it proceeds from the flesh, and
it deriveth from the flesh, as it is being, so it is enmity against God, ti
fights against God under the colors of the flesh, which (in this war against
God) heads all actual sins whatsoever as their General: now from the enmity of
the flesh (or concupiscence) unto God, we may infer it is opposition unto the
law of God, and the law of God is holy, just, and good. Romans 7. 12: and
therefore, that which is opposed unto it, must needs be naught, bad, and
sinful.

Unto this Gregory de Valentia [ comment. theol: disp. 6. quaest. 12. punct.
1.] answers, by distinguishing concerning a twofold repugnancy unto the law
of God, one effective, and another formal concupiscence (says he) is repugnant
unto, the divine law effectively, as it inclines unto sin, not (...), as if
that perfection of which it is a privation, were commanded in the law of God.

But, this is refuted by the tenth commandment, wherein, the first motions
unto sin are prohibited, and consequently concupiscence, the root of them:
unto this I might add in the next place, that, this answer may be retorted in
an argument, thus: that, which is repugnant unto God's law effectively, is also
repugnant thereunto formally, that, which inclines to disobey the law of God,
is formally opposite thereunto (as I shall hereafter at large manifest:) But
thus does concupiscence (by even the confession of our adversaries,) and
therefore it is opposed thereunto formally, as a deviation therefrom, and a
transgression thereof.

A second opposite of it is the grace of God in general: the flesh and the
spirit (says the Apostle) are contrary the one unto the (...), Gal: 5. 17:
where, by spirit, is understood the inherent and habitual grace, and by flesh,
the concupiscence of a regenerate man, the corruption of his nature: the
contrariety, of these two principles, is especially manifested by their actings
one against another in the regenerate, for in them, and in them only, the flesh
lusts against the spirit,. and the spirit against the flesh, Gal. 5. 17: now
nothing can be contrary to the spirit, and grace, but that which is properly,
really, and formally a sin.

Lastly, it is contrary unto the grace, or virtue of the love of God in
particular.

That, which inclines the soul unto inordinate, and immoderate love of the
creature, is contrary unto the love of God: (for where the creature is loved
inordinately, God is not loved with all the soul, heart, mind, and strength.)

But now, concupiscence inclines, and disposes the soul unto an Inordinatio
(...) (...) virium (...) (...) (...) (...), (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...)
(...) (...) (...) mordinatio (...) (...) potest dici (...). Aquinas. 1 2 ae. q.
8 2. a. 3.
inordinate, and immoderate love of the creature, to wit, as it is sovereign
end: (for what is it, but an habitual conversion of the soul from the
enjoyment of an immutable God, unto the fruition of mutable goods? what is it,
but an unbridled lust of committing fornication with the creature? which is
done, when the creature is idolized, and placed in God's room, as it is,
whenever it is loved, either above God, or in an equality with him.)

By this then it undeniably follows, that concupiscence is contrary unto the
grace, and virtue of the love of God; and abateth, and diminishes of it is
strength, and vigor; and consequently is sin.

That, which has hither-to been said against the Popish opinion, concerning
the possibility of man's creation with concupiscence, will serve a fortiori,
for resutation of the Socinians, and Dr Tailor, who, outstripping the
generality of the Papists, maintain; that concupiscence was actually in Adam
before his fall by the creation, and as natural unto him, as the (...) of
hunger and thirst: concupiscence, you have heard, is sin; and therefore this
is a downeright blasphemy, making God to be the author of sin; and besides,
it apertly contradicts what Moses speaks of God's complacnecy in all the
works of his creation, Gen 1. 31: and God saw every thing, that he had made,
and behold it was very good, for, if man was created with concupiscence, he was
made very defective, imperfect, and miserable; indeed the most miserable of all
creatures, unable to reach his natural end; to discharge acceptably any part
of that duty, which even the law of nature exacted of him; and to answer (in
any measure) chose great, and high relations, which God had put upon him: he
had a law in his members warring against the law of his mind; so that he might
with a great deal of justice, power out the pitiful complaint of Paul, Romans 7.
24: oh wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

If Dr Tailor shall, in the behalf of himself, stoop so low, as to make any
reply unto what I have said, I shall not decline him, and do assure him that
he shall have very fair play from me, as (...) words, and as hard arguments as
I can possibly give him; only one thing I shall entreat of him, that he would
dispute, and not declare against my opinion; and this request will not be
thought unreasonable, if it be considered, that, in his controversiall
writings, his florid, and Rhetorical language does disguise, and hide, the
seeblenesse of his argumentation, with his ordinary readers.

But to return unto Bellarmine: the most considerable argument that he has,
to prove that concupiscence was natural, and would have been in man, (...) he
had been created in his pure naturals, is taken from the composition of man's
nature; for hence (he thinks) it (...) loweth, that naturally there would have
been a rebellion, and a repugnancy of the sensitive faculties against the
rational: but let us hear his own words. Natural est corpori animali sensu,
and appetitu praedito concupiscere bonum sensibile: natural est spiritui
rationali, concupiscere bonum spirituale, quare si siat una natura ex spiritu
rationali, and corpore animali conflata, natural erit illi habere diveras, and
inter se pugnantes propensiones. Quod igitur primi parents nostri ante
peccatum pugna is it a diversarum appetitionum carerent, domum erat
supernaturale, non conditio naturalis. [de great: prim: hom: cap 6.] it is
natural unto a sensible body endued with sense, and a sensitive appetite to
covet a sensual good; and it is as natural unto a rational spirit to desire a
spiritual good; therefore if one nature be compounded of a reasonable soul, a
spirit, and a sensitive body, it will be natural unto it to have different,
and repugnant propensions, the sensual appetite naturally would have rebelled
against the rational.

The usual answer to this objection is very solid, and rational, unto which I
shall (...) this one thing, that the sensitive faculties in man are rational,
though not formally yet by participation, as being capable of the conduct, and
government of reason.

This being premised, the answer is, that, before the fall, all the motions of
the sensitive faculties were subordinate, obedient, and agreeable unto reason.
there might then be a diversity, but there could be no contrariety, or
repugnancy betwixt the rational and sensitive appetites, for, all desires
against reason are unnatural, against the very law of nature. Whereupon Quia
inquit in homine concupiscibilis naturaliter regitur ratione, in tantum
concupiscere est homi ni natural, in quantum est secundum rationis ordinem:
concupiscentia autem quae transcendit (...) rationis, inest homini (...) (...).
Aquinas [12 ae. q. 82 a. 3 ad (...).] confesses, that concupiscence is
against the nature of man, so far as it is against the reason of man, such a
concupiscence therefore cannot be the sequel of man's nature, as it came first
out of God's hands. Suarez in his Metaphysics [ disp. 44. sect. 1. n. 13.]
has a dictinction concerning the sensitive appetite, that will be a full and
formal answer unto the present objection, Appetitus sensitivus hominis ex vi
sui generis naturaliter inclinatur ad sensibilia, and delictabilia, tamen ex vj
conjunctionis and emanationis ex anima rationali habet inclinationem ad
obediendum rationi, and (...) appetendum ipsamet bona sensibilia, non tantum
quatenus (...) aut (...) commoda, sed maxim quatonus simpliciter bona homini
existimantur: to make application of this unto our present purpose; the
sensitive appetite in man might be considered ex vi gen ris, or ex vi
conjunctionis and emanationis ex anima rationali; in regard of it is kind; or in
regard of it is conjunction with, or emanation from the reasonable soul: we
are here to speak of the sensitive appetite, in the first man, not as it is
considered only in regard of it is kind, or (...) nature; for so it was common
unto beasts, as well as man, and so inclined unto a most intense desire of
things sensual; because as Scotus [lib. 2. sent. did. 29. q. 1.) natural est
unicuique appetitui (...) in suum appetibile, and si est appetitus non liber,
natural est (...) sum ferri quantum potest: quia sicut talis appetitus
secundum Damas. 24. ducitur and non est in potestate suaejus actus, quin (...)
quantum potest; as it is natural unto every appetite to be carried unto it is
object; so it is, unto that appetite, which is not free, to be carried as
highly, and intensely as it is possible; so that, as it is act, an lusting is
not in it is power, so neither is the intension thereof.

But we are to consider it in regard of it is conjunction with and (...) from
the reasonable soul; and 'twas rational, and free (as is noted before) though
not formally, yet participative, as being under the guidance of reason; and so,
in the first man before his fall, it was inclined only regularly, and orderly
unto the desire of things sensual with subordination unto the dictates of
right reason, and such motions of the will, as were suitable unto right reason:
now this I shall not magisterially dictate, but make good by two reasons.

The first reason I have (...) of Ames (Bellarm. enerv. l. 4. page 8. Cum unio
inquit naturae, ex spiritu rationali and corpore naturali, facta sit modo
perfecto subordinationem infert unius propensionis ad alteram, quae pugnam
omnem excludit. The union, betwixt the body, and the soul of man, was perfect;
and therefore inferred a subordination of the propensions, and operations of
the body unto the soul; and subordinatorum nulla est pugna, subordination
excludes all opposition: this argument strikes chiefly against such as make the
body to be the proper subject of the sensitive powers. But there be some (as
you may see (...) Metaphys. lib. 2. cap. 5. tit. 6. art. 1.] who in man make
all sensitive powers to be seated in the soul; and unto them too this argument
may be applied; the conjunction betwixt the sensitive, and rational faculties
in the same soul? supposing them to be both there (which now it is not
pertinent to dispute) was a most perfect, and orderly conjunction, made by God,
the author of all good order, who abhors all ataxy, and confusion; and order
still requires a subjection of those things, or persons, that are inferior
unto those, which are their superiors, the sensitive faculties therefore being
the more ignoble, were, by God, who made man, subjected unto the rational; and
they never had rebelled, if man by his fall had not perturbed this order:
indeed we may now apply, unto the powers of lapsed man, that of Solomon,
Eccles. 10. 7. I have (...) servants upon horses, and Princes walking as
servants upon the earth: those powers, which by the law of creation were
servants, made to serve, and obey, have the throne, and supremacy in the soul;
and those, unto which God gave the regency, are dethroned, and become servile;
but it was impossible for any such disorder or confusion to be in the soul of
man by creation; there could not then but be a most perfect. sweet, and
blessed harmony betwixt all man's parts, and powers; without any the least
clashing, or disagreement; for othewise how could man be made, as Solomon says
he was, strait, or upright, Eccles. 7. 29.

A second reason I have borrowed of Tilenus Atqui cogitari debebant, formae
specificae, cujusmodi est anima rationalis in homine, duplices esse
operationes, (...) tum proprias, ipsa habet, and exerit (...), quas non habet
(...) generalis, cujusmodi in (...) mine est (...) vegitans, and sentiens: tum
etiam coarctat, and (...) (...) modum revocat, and restring it operationes
formae generalis, suaeque (...) non modo congruentes, sed edam propias (...).
Sicut igitur anima vegetans, quae (...), and bestiis and hominibus est
communis, (...) coarctatur in homine, ut ejus operatio non nisi humana sit, ac
propterea homo non instar (...) vel pecudiscreseat, (...), gignat: sed humano
(...) agat. Ita and (...), quae (...) and hominibus est (...), per rationalem,
quae specifica est in homine, ita coarctatur and (...), ut. ex natura humana,
quamdiu illa incorrupta, non (...) secundum rationem, qui (...) humanus est
modus, appetat and concupiscat.
[syntag. page 1. cap. 33. s. 40.] the specificall form of man, his reasonable
soul, does so limit, determine, and restrain his general forms, vegetative,
and sensitive, as that it makes their operations, not only agreeable, but
proper unto man; it makes the operations of the vegetative soul, which of
themselves are common unto men with plants, and beasts so proper unto man, as
that they are in man after a sort only humane; and therefore man grows, and
increases, not as a tree or beast, but after a humane way; even so also it
makes the operations of the sensitive soul, which are common unto men with
beasts, proper and peculiar unto man; so that, whilst man's nature was
uncorrupted, he naturally coveted sensual, and corporeal things, not after a
brutish, but humane manner; that is conformably unto right reason: his nature
then, as 'twas created by God, (for so you must still understand me) was
without any repugnancy between his sensual; and rational appetites.

As for the other objections of Bellarmine I shall wholly pass them over;
because, some of them come not nigh the question as stated by me; others of
them are trivial, and receive an easy solution, and unto all of them the
Reader may find sufficient answers in Ames, Rivet, Gerard, Maccovius, and other
writers upon popish controversies.

It may now be expected, that I should make some application of this point, and
in particular, that I should show how far we are to be humbled for Original
sin, whose formale is the privation or want of original Righteousness; and I
had prepared a great deal of matter upon this subject, but shall now wholly lay
it aside; because I am happily prevented by the learned, and elaborate work of
Mr. Anthony Burgess concerning original sin, whither I shall refer the
Reader, and all that I shall do more, shall be to annexe a brief exposition,
and application of some few scriptures, that conduce to this purpose.

Jam. 1. 14, 15. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
lust, and enticed. Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and
sin when it is finished, brings (...) death.
IN the foregoing verse the Apostle James denies God to be the author of
temptation unto sin, in verse (the 15.) he opposes unto this denial an
affirmation, that man himself is the cause thereof; and this Antithesis is
denoted by the particle (but.) There is no doubt can be made, but that lust is
here taken in an ill sense; but even so it has a twofold acception, it
signifies either the habit, or the act.

Habitual lust again is twofold, either original, or acquired and contracted.
1. Lust is not here taken for the act of lust; because actions are here
ascribed unto it [ to draw, entice, conceive, bring forth,] it draws (...) to
sin, eonceiveth, brings forth sin; and, actionis non est actio, actions
are better and more fitly ascribed to an habit, than to an act. 2. Lust is not
here (...) for contracted, and acquired habitual lust; because the lust here
spoken of, is the cause of all temptations into sin whatsoever: Every man,
whenever he is tempted into sin, he is drawn away of his own lust, and
enticed, and men may be tempted, sometimes into some sins, not by any
contracted and acquired habits of lust, as is plain, in the temptation of Noah
into drunkenness; of Lot into both drunkenness, and incest; (...) Peter into
a cowardly denial of his Master, and Savior.
The lust then, which is the Theme that the Apostle James here treates of, is
that, which is called original sin. Aquinas 1 a. 2ae. q. 82. a. 3. Well
observes that there be two things considerable in original sin, the formale,
and the materiale of it.
1. The formale, and that is nothing else but the privation and want of
original righteousness. 2. The materiale, is an inordinate conversion, or
inclination of man's faculties, especially of his two appetites rational and
sensual unto the creature, and so it is called lust, or concupiscence which
says Cornelius Jansenius [in his Augustinus, Tom. 2. lib. 2. cap. 7.] is,
nihil aliud quam pondus habituale quo animus inclinatur ad sruendum, creaturis,
(...), ut Augustinus loquitur, rebus, (...), it is as it were an habitual
weight whereby the soul is inclined and carried downwards unto the fruition
of the creatures as it is supreme end.
Concerning this original lust we have here remarkable.
1. The propriety of it is inherence, his own lust. 2. The force of it is
influence, it tempts every man unto (...), etc.
1. The propriety of it is inherence [ by his own lust,] (...):] indeed,
original lust is one and the same specifically for sort or kind in all men;
unto which some apply that of Solomon, Prove. 27. 19. As in water face answers
to face; so the heart of man to man; but yet every man has his own particular,
several, origiginall lust numerically different from that of others: even as
the reasonable soul, though it be the same for kind in all men, yet every man
has his own soul, a soul individually distinct from that of others; (it is
Laurentius his illustration upon the place.) Thus Paul appropriates unto
himself the body of sin, which is the same with this lust. I keep under my
body, 1 Cor. 9. 27. This appropriation of original lust, or the corruption of
man's nature unto our own selves will more affect, and humble us; than to (...)
upon a general, and abstract consideration thereof: and hence is it that David
singleth out in his confession the iniquity, and sin of his own conception,
Psalm. 51. 5. Behold (says he) I was (...) in iniquity, and in sin did my
mother conceive me. He does confess, not only that there was such a sin, but
also that he himself was defiled therewith: besides this Epithet [ own, or
proper] may be added to prevent men, excusing of their sins by charging them
upon the temptations of other men's lust, who have drawn or enticed them. This
is a thing very usual, and therefore the Apostle advises to resolve, all
temptations into sin into our own lust, the lust in our own bosoms: Satan and
the world may tempt (...) sin; but whenever any man is tempted into sin, he
is drawn away, and enticed of his own lust.

2. We have here the force of it is influence [ it tempts, draws, (...) unto
sin, conceives, brings forth sin, etc.]

Here we have (...) the (...), secondly, the branches, and thirdly, the degrees
of this influence.

1. The extent of it in regard of it is subject. Every man is tempted by his own
lust: every man, except he that was God-man; who had God for his Father, and a
Virgin for his mother; that holy thing which was borne of the blessed Virgin
Mary, and was called the Son of God, Luke 1. 35.

2. Here are the branches of this influence, it [ draws and enticeth unto
sin:] these words may be understood either in regard of the parts in sin unto
which it tempts, or of the ways by which it tempts.

1. Of the parts which are in sin unto which it tempts: There are two parts
as it were in every sin, and aversion from good, and a conversion unto evil:
Now unto both these lust tempt's; it draws from that which is good, and
enticeth unto that which is evil; it draws, ab incommutabili bono, and
enticeth, ad commutabile bonum, it draws from God, man's chief end, and
enticeth to the sinful love and adulterous embraces of the creature, it
inclines the soul to forsake the fountain of living waters, to hew out unto
it self Cisternes, broken (...), that will (...) no water, Jer. 2. 13.

2. The words may signify the several ways, or means by which every man's
own lust tempts him unto sin: it draws by the importunity and impetuosity
of it is inclination unto unlawful objects; it enticeth, and allureth by (...)
plausibility of such objects; it draws as a tyrant, and enticeth as a harlot.
There are in the temptations of lust (as Bishop Andrews observes on the tenth
Commandment) uncus, and esca, a hook, and a bait, it draws as a hook, and
enticeth as a bait: The Metaphor Metaphora (...) a piscibus qui esca ex hamo
(...) (...) oblectantes (...) capiuntur. Ad eundem modum inescantur homines
illecebris quibusdam a concupiscentia sua, quae (...) in magna and multiplicia
(...) rapit dum oblatam sibi voluptatem, bonumque solum (...) persequuntur. Dia
bolus piscator est, ho no piscis, mundus piscina, peccatum hamus, bona (...)
escae, and illecebrae illae sunt, quibus (...) capitur. Tuk. in (...).
is taken from fishermen, who make use of both; they draw the fishes by the
hook, and entice them by the bait. Concupiscence deals with us, as Joseph's
Mistress with him, she enticed him to lie with her, she spoke to him day by day;
and then she attempted to draw him to her, and she caught him by his garment,
saying, lie with me, Genesis 39. v. 7, 10, 12.

3. We have the degrees of this influence of lust: and they may be reduced unto
three heads; it had an influence upon, first, the production, secondly, the
consummation, and thirdly, the punishment of sin.

1. Upon the production of sin; and that is, either inward, or outward: first
inward, and that is twofold; first, the first motions unto sin, it draws
and (...), secondly, consent unto such motions, lust when it has conceived.

2. It has an influence; secondly as upon the inward conception, so also upon
the outward birth or production of sin, Lust brings forth sin. Next it has
an influence upon.

2. The Consummation of sin; Lust when it is finished.

3. And lastly upon the punishment of sin. Sin (...) it is sinished
brings forth death. But, to lay aside the curiosity of division, we shall go
over these gradations in the influence of lust, in order as they lie in the
words, without taking notice of any subversions.

First, it draws and enticeth unto sin: by which may be meant the first
motions, suggestions, agitations, and (as it were) titillations of lust before
consented to.

Secondly, lust when it conceives; Conception (say Physicians) is never but
with some kind of consent of both parties; by the conception of lust therefore,
is understood a consent unto it is motions, either consensus in (...), or
consensus in actum, as Aquinas distinguishes, 1 a. 2ae. q. 74. a. 7. 8: a
consent of delight, or a consent of resolution.

1. A Consent of delight; when a man takes (...) in the very thoughts, and
apprehensions of the committing such a sin; and accordingly desires
conditionally to commit it, provided, that all obstacles were removed; thus
many a rank lecher neighes after his neigbours wife, though he dare not
outwardly attempt her chastity.

Omnia si claudas intus adulter erit.

His delights and desires, unto which he dares give no vent, will render him an
adulterer in the sight of heaven.

2. A consent of (...); an effectual purpose to commit sin, which yet may
prove abortive, or miscarry, and be hindered from execution: the Children may
come to the birth, and there may not be strenth to bring forth, Esaias. 37. 3.
Psalm. 21. 11.

3. A third degree in the influence of lust is, that it brings forth sin:
that is, sin eminently, visibly, and manifestly such; the outward act of
sin: thus sin is also taken, Genesis 20. verse. 6. I withheld thee, says God
to Abimelech, from sinning against (...); to wit, by the gross and outward act
of adultery; for there is no question, but that he sinned inwardly (...) his
desire, and purpose to (...) Sarah: that here [by the bringing forth of sin] is
meant the external perpetration of sin, either by word, or deed, I shall
evince by two reasons.

1. Because in the inward conception of sin, by sinful delights, desires,
and purposes, sin is brought forth in the eyes of God, Matthew. 5. 28. I say unto
you, (says our Savlour,) that whosoever looks on a woman to lust after
(...), has committed adultery with her already in his heart. In conformity
unto this it is, that the Schoolmen make the outward act of sin to add
nothing per se, and properly unto the intensive badnesse of the inward,
perfect, and (...) (...) (...) commit it: In good works God accepts the will
for the deed

2 Cor. 8. 12. Heb. 11. 17: and therefore, (by the rule of contraries) he hates
in evil works a full purpose to commit it, as much as he does the outward
commission of it: now the bringing forth of sin is here distinguished from the
conception of it, and therefore (seeing in the very conception of sin, sin is
brought forth before the eyes of God,) therefore by the bringing of sin is
meant the bringing forth of it forth into external act, as it were before the
eyes of men; and our most secret words and deeds may be said to be brought
forth before men; because, the former are audible, though there be actually no
auditors, and the latter visible though there be actually no spectators: even
as a child may be (...) to be brought forth, that has no witness of it is
birth besides the mother.

2. Secondly, this sense would be most agreeable unto the Metaphor that is here
used, for lust is here compared unto a teeming mother, now a mother conceives
inwardly in her womb, and brings forth the fruit; of her womb out of her
body into the world semblably, the conception of sin is inward by delights,
desires, and purposes of the (...), the birth of it is outward by words and
deeds.

The two last steps in the progress of sins influence, is the consummation of
sin, and it is production of death: sin when it is finished brings forth death:
upon the exposition of which words, before I enter, I shall premise the
several acceptions of each term.

First, sin may be said to be finished either (...) in it self, or else
(...) by extrinsecall denomination.

1. Intrinsecally in it self: and that is, either in regard of the commission
of it, when it is outwardly committed; or else in respect of impenitency for it,
when it is continued in without repentance.

2. Extrinsecally, by extrinsecall denomination, from God's decree of
permitting it, when one has sinned so far, and so much, as God has decreed
to suffer him.

2. Death is taken, either for the inchoation of the spiritual death (...) the
soul, here in this life, or for the consummation of it, eternal damnation.

3. Sin finished may be said to bring forth death; either in regard of merit,
and desert; or else in respect of issue, or event.

The equivocation that is in the words being thus opened, proceed we next unto
the interpretation of them; and

1. Enquire we how sin finished brings forth death; it cannot be understood
of a meritorious production thereof; and my reason is, because this bringing
forth of death is appropriated unto the finishing of sin, sin when it is
finished, (and not before) brings forth death; but now before sin is
finished, before it is brought forth, when it is but an embrio, when it is but
conceived in the heart by consent unto it, and approbation of it, then it
deserves death, Hell, and damnadation (for this consent unto it is truly and
properly sin, and the wages of every sin is death corporal and eternal) the
bringing forth of sin then, is to be understood not in regard of the merit and
desert but of the issue and event; it actually brings forth death, it actually
throws into Hell.

2. By the finishing of sin cannot be understood barely the outward commission
of it, for

First, then the finishing of sin would be the same with the bringing of it
forth; whereas (in all probability) they are distinguished as well, as the
other degrees in sins influence.

2ly. Sin when it is (...), as soon as it is finished bringes forth death
actually, in regard of the event; but as soon as sin is actually committed, it
does not bring forth death actually, in regard of the event; for God many times
grants a long reprieve after the externallcommission of the foulest enormities.

3ly. If by the finishing of sin you understand (...) for it; yet even so there
will occur difficulties, to clear which, we must distinguish betwixt present
impeniteny, and (...) impenitency; and present impenitency is again twofold,
actual, or habitual; which we may call the state of impenitency; and that is,
when there is no renewed principle, no grace in the soul to dispose, and
incline it unto repentance: these distinctions thus premised, I shall lay down
four propositions, which will show the sense of this clause.

The first proposition: Actual impenitency does not always bring forth death
actually; for it may be consistent with the seeds of spiritual life, gracious
habits: and of this we have an example in David, who lay in his sin a long time
impenitent, until awakened and rowsed by the ministry of Nathan.

A second proposition: Neither does present habitual impenitency, the present
state of impenitency, always actually bring forth death; if ye take death for
eternal death, hell and damnation: for unto those, that are, for the present,
most impenitent, God may, in his due time, give repentance unto the
acknowledgement of the truth, 2 Timothy 2. 25: and so rescue them out of the snare
of the Devil.

A third proposition: when sin is finish: d by a present habitual
impenitency, by a state of impenitency, it does actually bring forth death;
that is, the inchoation of spiritual death, standing in a separation from God,
and Christ, (who are the life of the soul,) and in an utter, and total
privation of grace: a state of impenitency is a state of death: that soul
which is habitually impenitent for sin, is totally dead in sin, for sin is
there (...), and reigns as a prince, or Lord; because there is no contrary
principle of grace to oppose it, no spirit to (...) against it, Nam in quo
peccatum consummatur spiritus sanctus non commoratur, (as Tuke upon the place)
sin finished brings forth death, that is, spiritual death is the formal
effect of habitual unrepentance for sin.

The fourth proposition: when sin is finished by final impenitency, by
perseverance in a state of impenitency, then it actually bring's forth death:
to wit, hell and Damnation: those of grown years, that dye without repentance
drop into the eternal flames, and torments of hell.

What I have hitherto said may be applied, not only to the whole course of sin,
but also unto every actual sin: but Calvin restraines the words to the whole
course of sin in a man's life, Perfectum peccatum (says he) non intelligo unum
aliquod opus perpetratum, sed cursum peccandi completum: with Calvin,
Cartwright accords also (in his answer unto the Rhemists annotations upon the
place) James (says he) by the consummation of sin, does not mean every
actual sin, but sin (...), and (...) up to such a height, as that (...)
calls for an utter uncurable, and unresistable destruction from the just
(...) hand of God; as when a man does not only walk in the counsel of the
wicked. stand in the way of sinners, but even sit him down in the seat of the
scornful, Psalm. 1. 1: which are of such desperate hope, as Solomon will not
have them once (...), the only remedy of recovering them, if they were
recoverable, Prove. 9. 7, 8.

If sin be here taken, as these worthies determine, only for the whole course
of sin: then it is said to be finished, not only (...) in it self, but also
extrinsecally by extrinsecall denomination from God's decree of permitting it,
and it is when men are come unto that fulness of sin, that extent, number, and
measure of sin, which God has purposed to suffer them to run into, when men
arrive unto the utmost bounds, and limits, that God by his decree has prefixed
unto their sins, then sin being thus finished brings forth death, both
temporal, and eternal.

The words, thus analyzed, and expounded, we shall in the next place clear
them from two false inferences of the Papists: first, that concupiscence is not
sin: Secondly, that there are venial sins: we have here set (...) (says
Bellarmine) [Tom. 4. de amiss. great. and statu pecc. lib. 1. cap. 9. lib. 5.
cap. 7.] four things; lust, and three of it is (...), one involuntary, two
other voluntary, one involuntary without all consent of the mind, and that is
(...), [ lust draws, and (...) unto sin;] the two other are voluntary; one
imperfectly, and the other perfectly; one imperfectly voluntary, and that is
such a delectation wherein there is but an imperfect consent, [ lust when it
conceives, it brings forth sin,] the other perfectly voluntary, when there
is a full, and perfect consent [ sin when it is finished brings sorth death.]

These things thus presupposed: first he concludes, that (...) is not sin;
because the Apostle does not call it sin, but only affirms that it is the
cause of sin: lust (...) it conceives, it brings forth sin.

But this argument is very weak, for

First, though it be not expressly here called sin, yet it is expressly called
sin by the Apostle Paul, and that fourteen times, (as Commentators generally
reckon) in three chapters of his Epistle to the Romans ( viz: chap. 6. 7. and
8.)

Secondly, though it be not here called sin expressly, yet it is imply'dly, for
it is made the cause of sin: and such as the fruit is, such is the tree.

Add unto this thirdly, that, if the place prove concupisence not to be sin,
it proves it not to be so in those that are unbaptized, unjustified, and
unregenerate, as well, as in the baptized, justified, and regenerate, for it
speaks universally, of all men, every man when he is tempted, etc: and
therefore it is fallaciously done to bear his Readers in hand, as if he
limited his conclusion, only to those, that are baptized, justified, and
regenerate.

In a second place, he endeavors from the words to prove, that there are
venial sins: there are (says he) two birthes of lust, one imperfect [lust
when it conceives brings forth sin,] but it is a venial sin, for it is
distinguished from the consummate birth, of lust, sin finished, unto which it
is appropriated to bring forth death, to be mortal, to deserve hell and
damnation: the argument may thus be reduced into form: every mortal sin
brings forth death, deserves hell, and damnation, but the sin, that lust
ingendreth or brings forth, when it has conceived, does not bring forth
death, does not deserve hell and damnation, therefore it is not a mortal, but a
venial sin.

The minor is confirmed, because it is appropriated to sin finished to bring
forth death, and sin brought forth, is distinguished from sin-finished.

The Answer shall be unto the Minor, and it is confirmation: and it stands in
two particulars.

First, to bring forth death in regard of issue or event is appropriate unto
sin consumate or finished, but to bring forth death in point of merit agrees
unto the least sin, for every sin merits the curse of the law, Galat. 3.
10. Mat. 5. 19.

Secondly, the sin, which lust, when it has conceived, brings forth: and
sin finished are not distinguished, as diverse sorts, and kinds of sins,
but only in regard Non distinguit ut varia (...), sed ut peccatum (...)
admissum, distingui (...) a peccato (...) (...)a (...). Amefius Bell: enerv. 1.
4. p. 36.
of several considerations: the very same sins, that lust brings forth, may
be said to be finished, when they are unmortified, unsubdued: lust brings
them forth as they are externally committed or accomplished, and they are (...)
to be finished, when they are (...), and unsubdued, and so reign in the soul
without repentance.

The words afford many observations, But I shall pitch upon one, for which I
made choice of them, and it is: that, every man's original lust or
concupiscence, is the principal cause of temptation unto sin, and hereupon
it is called original sin, because actual sins are unto it their rise, and
orignall: est peccatum actuosum, seu agens, licet non sit actuale (says Tuke,
page: 50:) indeed Satan, and the world tempt unto sin, but James here makes no
mention of them, and what better reason can be assigned for this omission, than
this, that they have not so great a stroke upon our temptations, as our own
lust?

This point being thus deduced from the Text, I shall briefly

First, Explain: Secondly, Confirm: and Thirdly, Apply it.
First, for explication: we must distinguish of an (...), and a mediate cause
of temptation: secondly of a universal and particular cause of temptation.

First, of an immediate and mediate cause of temptation: original lust is not
always the immediate cause of prevailing temptations unto sin, for we are
many times tempted immediately by our contracted, and acquired lusts, but yet
of such temptations our native concupiscence is the mediate and remote cause.

Secondly, we must distinguish of a universal and particular case of
temptation: original concupisence is an universal, not a particular cause of
our temptation unto sin: now the influence, or causality of universal second
causes as if the heavens, and stars is determined, much diversified by
diverse particulars in the subjects upon whom it is, and thus the influence, of
original lust upon men's temptations unto sin, is much differenced according
to the variety, that is in the complexions, dispositions, conditions, and
relations, etc: of men: it tempt's a chollericke man unto wrath, and hatred, a
man of a sanguine constitution unto good fellowship, riot, and luxury, a
phlegmatic man unto idleness, a melancholy man unto envy, unto dark
mischeivous plots, a rich man unto pride, and covetousness, a poor man unto
impatience, discontent, and murmuring, subjects unto disobedience, sedition,
and rebellion, Princes unto Tyranny, and oppression: but this influence of
concupiscence varieth not only in several men, but in the same men, as their
(...) varieth, not only in several men, but in the same men, as their
conditions, and relations alter: when (...) came to the scepter of Syria, it
quickly tempted him unto that belluine rage, toward the people of Israel,
which, when he was a servant of Benhadads, he thought he had abhorred, his
(...) heart misinformed him, that he was scarcely capable of so great a guilt,
2 King. 8. 12, 13: it made Caius Caesar Caligula, when he was a subject, to be
a base and servile flatterer of Tiberius, and when he himself came to the
empire, it rendered him intolerable, for all kind of Tyranny: hence also it is
ordinary for men, whilst they are in a low condition, to declaime most bitterly
against the arbitrary, and unjust government of magistrates, but, when they
themselves get into places of authority, they prove so injurious, and
oppressive unto all under them, as that one may justly think, that power is
hardly capable of being abused unto greater wrong, and unjustice, then they
have practiced.

The Consirmation shall have two parts: first, that our own lust is a cause,
secondly, that it is a principal cause of temptation unto sin.

First, that it is a cause of temptation unto sin, and that, these following
scriptures evince, Matthew. 15. 19. Out of the heart, that is, out of that
bottomless evil treasure of the heart, Matthew. 12. 35. Concupiscence,
proceed, the smallest sins, evil thoughts, and greatest murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, falsewitnesse, blasphemies, Romans 7. 8. sin, (that is
original sin) taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner
of concupiscence, to wit, actual concupiscence, those passions, or motions of
sin, spoken of in verse the fifth: the commandment is only a cause per
accidens Rolloc.
of them, not properly a cause, but only an occasion: an occasion, not given,
but taken, it is the imbred corruption of our nature, original sin alone,
that is, the causa per se of it, 2 Pet. 1. 4. All the corruption and
naughtiness, that is in the world is throw lust: flesh in scripture is the
same with lust, and what abominations the flesh produces, you may see, Gal. 5.
19, 20, 21. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are (...),
adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft,
haired, variance, (...), wrath, strife, seditions, (...), envyings, murders,
(...), revellings, and such like.

Secondly, that it is a principal cause of temptation unto sin: and that is
evident by three reasons, because it tempts first, internally; secondly,
effectively; thirdly, perpetually.

First, it tempts internally; whereas Satan, and the world are but external
tempters; this is domesticus hostis, a traitor and tempter in our own bosoms.

Secondly, Satan and the world tempt only objectively, by their proposal of
objects; but our concupiscence tempts effectively, and physically, by way of
real efficiency; really inclining, and disposing unto sin: I mean (so far
forth, as sin is capable of real efficiency) quoad materiale.

Thirdly, concupiscence is the principal cause of temptation, because it
tempts perpetually: resist the devil, and he will flee from you, Jam. 4. 7:
but make never so great resistance against this lust, it will never flee from
you; nor can ye ever flee or run from it: it is as restless an adversary as
(Hanibal Cum (...) (...) (inquit (...) Host res est, qui nec bonam, nec malam
(...) fortunam potest, seu vicit ferociter (...) (...): seu (...) est,
instaurat cum victoribus certamen. Livius lib. 27.
said) Marcellus was; who would never be quiet, whether he was a conqueror, or
whether he was conquered: men may retire themselves from most of the vanities,
and temptations of the world; but it is impossible, whilst here in this mortal
body, to withdraw our selves from the temptations of our own lusts; of these
Hermites have complained in a wilderness, and Anchorites in their cells.

The uses that may be made of this point, are of information, (...), and
exhortation.

First, of information; and they are three.

First, we may hence learn, what a great difference there is, betwixt the
temptations of lapsed man unto sin, and the temptation of our first parents
unto their first sin: every man, that has sinned since their fall, is
tempted by his own lust, whereas Adam, and Eve had only an outward tempter; and
it was only by the abuse of their free will, that they consented unto his
temptations: it is said of Eve Genesis 3. 6: when she saw, that tke tree was good
for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat: here indeed she
was tempted by her own lust; by those three sorts of lusts, that John speaks
of, 1 John 2. 16: First, the lust of the flesh (when the woman saw that the
tree was good for food) secondly, the lust of the eyes (and that it was
pleasant to the eyes) thirdly, the pride of life (and a tree to be desired to
make one wise:) but this was not before her fall, but a degree, and part
thereof. Dr. Tailor I know teaches another doctrine [in his unum necessarium,
page 374.] concupiscence (says he) was actual before the fall; it was in
Adam, and tempted him; [ and in his further explication of original sin,
page 462.] by rebellion, and prevailing of concupiscence it was, that Adam
fell: but the answer unto this might easily be foreseen; to wit; that the
rebellion, and prevailing of his concupiscence was a cause of a part of his
fall, viz: of his outward eating the forbidden fruit, wherein his fall was
completed; as also of his resolution to eat thereof: but yet notwithstanding
it was not the cause of the first act of his fall, his first sin, for
concupiscence (as I have proved) is sin, and by this, man should sin before he
had sinned.

Secondly, we may hence be instructed what a wide difference there is, betwixt
our temptations unto sin, and the temptations of Christ: every one of us is
tempted by his own lust, but lust is so filthy a thing, as that it was utterly
repugnant unto the perfect, full, and unspotted purity, and holiness of the
Lamb of God? the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in (...)
(says Christ) Joh. 14. 38: nothing in me to side, and comply with his
temptations: hence was it, that that sygnall temptation of him by Satan, Matthew.
4: did not, could not make so much impression upon him, as the waves of the sea
upon a rock: the devil tempted him unto all those branches of lust mentioned
by John, [in the now quoted place, 1 John 2. 16.] first unto the lust of the
flesh, Matthew. 4. 3: when the tempter came to him, he said, if thou be the Son
of God, command that these stones be made bread: secondly, unto the lust of the
eyes, verse. 8. 9. Again the Devil takes him up into an exceeding high
mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of (...) world, and the glory of
them: and says ununto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou will
fall down and worship me. Thirdly, unto the pride of life; to purchase unto
himself renown by his miraculous preservation in his fall from the temple,
verse. 5. 6: then the Devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him
on a pinnacle of the temple, and says unto him, if thou be the Son of God,
cast thy self down; for it is written, He shall give his Angels charge
concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, least at any time
thou dash thy foot against a stone: none of these temptations could fasten on
him; for, the Hypostaticall union, the all-fullnesse of his grace, and the
beatificall vision secured him from the danger of all temptations; and rendered
the prevaling of them a thing utterly impossible.

Thirdly, we may from the causality and influence of lust infer it is
obliquity: aganist Papists, Socinians, and Dr. Tailor: that it is not only a
natural but a moral disease of the soul; not only vitium, but peccatum: that
which as a quality, or habit tempts, draws, and entices unto sin, conceives
and brings forth sin, must needs be sin; but lust does all this; and
therefore it is sin: to wit; properly, and formally: The Minor is affirmed in
terminis by the Apostle in the text; and, for confirmation of the Major, I
shall lay openly three things.

First, the testimony of our Savior Matthew. 7. verse. 17. 18: a corrupt tree
brings forth evil fruit, a good tree cannot bring sorth evil fruit; but the
fruit of lust is morally evil, it brings forth sin; therefore it is a tree
morally corrupt.

A second thing is that known Maxim in Logic: Nihil dat quod non habet vel
formaliter vel eminenter; that which is the principal cause of the obliquity
and deformity of sin, must needs have in it self that deformity or
obliquity, (...) formally, or (...); it must either have the same deformity, or
obliquity; or else some deformity, or obliquity, which is more eminent than
that; but no deformity or obliquity can transcend that of sin; and
concupiscence is the principal cause of sin, (whether efficient, or
deficient it comes all to one) therefore concupiscence contains the obliquity
or deformity of sin formally; and consequently is formally a (...).

A Third particular, which I shall allege for confirmation of the Major is,
the manner of lusts causality of, and influence upon sin: it tempts, draws,
and enticeth unto sin; not outwardly, as an object; but inwardly, as a
quality, or habit, it inc^lineth unto sin, as habits dispose unto their acts;
now habits impart both their name, and nature unto their most accomplished, and
complete acts, concupiscence therefore communicates unto it is most consummate
acts their nature, and name, and therefore has (as they) both the name, and
nature of sin: Ames thus urges this argument against Bellarmine,
Concupiscentia dicitur parere peccatum, eo modo quo interna animi rectitudo (
quae est justitia) parit justitiam, id est, completum actum, de quo nomen, and
natura totius motus; and principii ejus usitate and proprie maxim praedicatur,
[Bell. enerv. tom. 4. page 36.]

From this there may be refuted three other points of popery: First, the
absolute perfection of the good works of the regenerate: Secondly, their
justification by them: And thirdly, their possibility of fulfilling the law.

First, the absolute perfection of the good works of the regenerate, for
concupiscence works in all the actions of man, and therefore (seeing it is a
sin) it distilleth sinfullnesse into the best of them, and renders them
peccaminosa, though not peccata, sinful, though not sins: the flesh lusts
against the spirit, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would, Gal. 5.
17: the good things that ye would so exactly or perfectly as ye desire.

Secondly, we may hence conclude against justification by goood works, at
least in a meritorious way, for it so distaineth them, as that it disableth
them to satisfy for the least sin against God, to merit the least good from
God: and this may discover the necessity of a Christ for our justification, who
was God as well as man, and in his manhood had such an all-fullnesse of grace,
as was utterly exclusive of, and inconsistent with the least degrree of
concupiscence: lust therefore did not, could not mingle with any of his
actions, and sufferings, to impede the all-fullnesse of their satisfaction, and
merit.

Thirdly, we may hence infer the impossibility of fullfilling the law in a
legal way, for though we may keep it evangellically, in such a measure, as
God, for Christ's sake, will accept, yet concupiscence does so immixe it self
with all our actions, the very best of them, as that they must needs prove
gradually defective, and come far short of that exactness and perfection which
the law requires: and so consequently every man is a sinner, a transgressour
of the law.

But to pass from speculative unto practical uses:

The next use is of reprehension of all such as excuse, or extenuate their sins
by discharging them upon the importunity, and violence of outward temptations,
the text in hand teaches us, that the principal cause, into which we are to
resolve all the prevailing temptations unto sin, is our own lust: so that God
may say to those that perish in their sins, as the Prophet unto Israel, Hosea
13. 9: thou have destroyed thy self; it is thy own concupiscence has undone
thee, has damned thee: oh Beloved! it is our own lust, that has conceived, and
brought forth all our sins it is this internal tempter in our hearts, that
has betrayed us unto all foreign, and external suggestions unto sin, by
opening the gate of our consent unto them, and therefore it would be injustice
to lay our sins at any others doors: external tempters are never total, but
only partial causes of sin, they do never more than cooperate with that
sinful lust within us: the goodly Babylonish garment, the two hundred shekels
of silver, and the wedge of gold of fifty shekels, had never enticed Achan unto
sacrilege if he had not been also tempted by his own lust, the lust of the
eyes, coveteousnesse: David had never by the beauty of Bathsheba been allured
unto adultery with her, but that he was tempted by his own lust, the lust of
the flesh: though Satan provoked him to number Israel, 1 Chronicles. 21. 1: yet he
could never have drawn him thereunto, but that he was tempted by his own lust,
the pride of life, ambition, and haughtiness: and hence was it, that he did
not throw the blame upon Satan, but charged himself alone, 2 Samuel 24. 10.
David's heart smote him, after that he had numbered the people: and David said
unto the Lord I have sinned greatly in that I have done: when Scipio's invasion
of Africa drew Hannibal out of Italy (it is said that) Hannibal brake out into
this expression; it is not Scipio, but mine own country men Hanno, and his
faction in the Senate of Carthage, that has thwarted, and contradicted all my
designs, and hindered my recruits, and supplies; it is he only that has driven
me out of Italy: So every regenerate man may say, when he is drawn, or driven
from his communion, and fellowship with the Allmighty; it is not so much Satan,
the world, evil company, the badnesle of times, or places in which I live,
outward provocations, and allurements, the infelicity of my condition,
relations, and the like it is not so much these, the traitor in my heart; the
flesh lusting against my better part, the spirit, has tempted, and seduced me,
has drawn me from my God, and Savior, and has enticed me unto sin.

Lastly, diverse exhortations may be inferred from the causality and influence
of our concupiscence: we may hence be exhorted unto; First, (...) for it:
Secondly, mortification of it: Thirdly, watchfulln sse against it: Fourthly,
thankfulness for deliverance from it.

First, unto humiliation for it.

There will be a great deal of justice in our tears, for the fountain of all
temptations, the mother of all sins: for that which tempts, draws,
enticeth unto sin, which conceives, and brings forth all sorts of sins:
David therefore (in his penitential Psalm, for murder, and adultery) had very
good reason to spread before God this his birth sin, because 'twas a seminall
sin, it contaiued the seeds of his adultery, and murder, Psalm: 51. 5: hence
also it is no wonder, that Paul, having mentioned the malignant operation of
this law in his members, forthwith subjoineth a most bitter complaint touching
his infelicity and misery thereby, and most passionately wishes for a (...)
deliverance therefrom: oh wretched man that I am (says he) who shall deliver
me from the body of this death? Rom: 7. 24: concupiscence is the root of
bitterness; Heb. 12. 15: the root of all the bitterness, that is in our evil
deeds; and therefore every one, upon whom God has powered a spirit of grace,
will, or should be in bitterness for it, as one that is in bitterness for his
first borne: every gracious heart greives at the sad, doleful, and banefull
effects of (...), and shall we have no resentment of the badnesse of the cause:
oh Beloved! did we but afford unto the accursed, or pernicious issue, or
progeny of lust a due, and through contemplation, we would think, that we
could never weep enough for that, which is productive of so much, and great
mischief, though our head were waters, and our eyes a fountain of tears,
Jer: 9. 1: even the most wicked are troubled in their minds, when enormous
sins break out into their lives, and thereby terrify their consciences, blot
their reputations, prejudice their estates, or any other ways incommodate
them; but this is but a worldly sorrow: the damned in hell howl, when sin
being consummate brings forth death; but this is but a hellish sorrow: a
true, heavenly, and godly sorrow rises higher, and goes further; it begins
with the very inchoations of sin, the first suggestions unto sin, with
concupiscence, that makes these suggestions; for this would be a likely means
to retard, and in some measure (...) any further progress of lusts influence;
and so anticipate, or prevent the worldly, and hellish sorrow now spoken (...)
[when Elisha healed the waters of Jericho, he went forth unto the spring of the
waters, and cast in salt there, 2 King. 2. 21. If we would heal the streams
of actual sins, we should go unto the spring, original sin, and power
out our salt, our brinish tears upon it.]

To surther, and increase our humiliation, for this malignant influence of
concupiscence, I shall propound only one, but that shall be a very stirring
motive: and it is, that this influence is exceedingly heightened, and intended,
viz: (...) by the good, holy, and just law, and commandment of God: even as (
by an antiperistasis) heat is many times intended by the opposition of the
adjacent cold, Romans 7. 8, 13: sin taking occasion by the (...) wrought in me
all manner of concupiscence; sin by the commandment became exceeding sinful:
the prohibitions of the law (...) accid ns provoke, exasperate, and enrage
concupiscence; and render it is workings more vigorous, outrageous, and violent,
then otherwise they would be; for

Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata.

We long most after forbidden fruit; we are most addicted unto interdicted
actions: (...) waters, says (...) wise man, are sweet, Prove. 9. 17: and hence
is it, that those carnal and unregenerate men, who sit under a powerful
ministry, usually run into a greater excess of riot, than such, whose lusts
are not at all awakened by the home, and searching preaching of the law: oh!
what an unfathomable pravity is there in this, that makes a most equitable
disswasive from sin, to be a powerful incentive unto it? that makes that a
spur to excite unto sin, which in it is natural tendency is a bridle to
restrain therefrom? and so turns a most wholesome (...), into a most
pernicious poison? makes that to bring forth fruit unto death, which was
ordained to life? Romans 7. 10.

Secondly, unto mortification of it: sin when it is si nished brings forth
death; and it is finished, when it is unmortified: now lust is a part of sin
consummate (as Ames (...) peccatum non distinguit (...) a peccato consummato
and mortem generante, (...) speciem a specie, sed tanquam partem a toto. Ames.
Bell. enerv. tom. 4. page 15
marks in his answer unto Bellarmine;) and therefore, when our own lust is
finally unmortified, it brings forth death, it cast's into the fire of Hell:
if we do not therefore mortify lust, it will kill, and damn us; without the
mortification of original sin, the mortification of actual sin will be
impossible; unless we mortify the body of sin, we can never mortify the deeds
of the body, it will be a vain endeavor to dry up the streams, when the
fountain is as full as ever. Stephen Gardener, used (in the time of Queen
Mary) to say, that 'twas in vain to strike at the branches, whilst the root of
all heretics did remain; meaning the Lady Elizabeth, that was afterward
Queen: thus may we say; it will be to little purpose to lop the branches of the
tree of corruption, unless we lay the axe unto the root of the tree, that root
of bitterness, our own lust; which unless mortified will abundantly fructify,
in sinful wishes, desires, delights, resolves, and outward works; it will
always be conceiving, and bringing forth sin: the King of Meth in Ireland,
sometimes asked one Turgehesie, how certain noisome birds, that came flying
into the realm, and did much harm, might be destroyed; he answered him, nidos
(...) ubique destruendos, the way to be rid of them was to destroy their nests:
the way to destroy actual lust is to mortify, and pull down original lust;
that is, fomes (...), the nest and the womb of all actual sins whatsoever:
unto this the Apostle: Paul exhorts, Romans 6. 12. Let not sin reign in your
mortal bodies, here [by sinne] many learned interpreters (both Protestant, and
popish) understand original sin; unto which all actual sin are but as
Vice-royes; and the mortification of this is nothing but the dethronization
thereof; when original sin is mortified, then it is uncrown'd, and dethroned;
and it is unmortified, and reigns, when there is no spiritual resistance made
against it, by a spiritual principle, upon spiritual, and scripture grounds;
because it is displeasing unto God, and contrary unto his law; when there is no
grace to impair, and weaken it, no spirit to lust against the flesh: The
reign of original sin (which is nothing else but the unmortification
thereof) is here verse. 13: described by it is (...) and opposite.

First, by it is correlate: and that is a twofold subjection.

First, and obedience unto it is laws, edicts, and commands, not obeying it in
the lust thereof, that is, not yielding a full, and total consent unto it is
motions, suggestions, and desires.

The second, is a (...) to fight it is battles, to take up arms in it is
defense, to employ all the parts of our body, and consequently, all the powers
of our soul, by which these parts are acted, in it is service: (...) yield ye
your members as instruments [or as it is in the greek arms or (...).
weapons] of unrighteousness, [actuall unrighteousness, unrighteous actions]
unto sin, [that is, unto original sin.]

Secondly, the reign or unmortification of original sin is here described
by it is opposite, subjection, and obedience unto the kingdom of God, and the
righteousness thereof: but yield your selves unto God, etc: and your members,
[and conseqnently the faculties of your roules] as instruments of
righteousness unto God.

Unto the mortification, that is, opposition of the reign of original sin, we
have here two arguments: First, the shortness of the combat; (...).
Chrysostomus in locum.
it will be only whilst you have these mortal bodies: Secondly the assurance
and certainty of victory: First, sin shall not have (...) over you, verse. 14:
so you will do your devoyre, and make head and resistance against it; and this
promise of victory, he confirms, from the state of regeneration; for ye are
not under the law but under grace; ibid: ye are not under the law, as it is the
strength of sin, 1 Cor. 15. 56: as it irritates, stir's up, and provokes unto
sin, Romans 7. 8: but ye are under grace, the grace of sanctification; it will
enable, and assist you to resist, and overcome sin, and that original, as
well as actual: unto this place let me add another of the same author in his
Epistle unto the Hebrews, (...), 12. 1, 2: let us lay aside the (...) which
does so easily beset us: original sin cannot here in this life be laid
aside, as touching the existence of it; but let us lay aside the dominion of
it, let us shake of the rule of this sin, which (of it self) does so easily
beset us, beleaguer all our faculties; it tempts us without a tempter, it is
motions will arise without any outward provocation: Erasmus renders the clause;
abjecto tenaciter inhaerente nobis peccato, sin, that cleaves so fast unto
us: so fast, that it cannot be loosed from us, ( a conceptione ad funus) though
we be working on it, and weeding out of it from the beginning to the end of our
life, so Bishop Lake, on Psalm. 51. v. 5: notes upon the words: and (according
to this translation) (...) tel's us of some, who think, that the Apostle
alludes unto Ezekiel 24. 26: where some wicked men are compared to a pot, whose
scumme is therein, and whose scumme is not (...) out of it: the scumme of
concupiscence will never wholly be gone out of our natures here, but however we
should always be rubbing, and scouring it away so much as we can: let us
endeavor our utmost, to lay aside the sin which does so easily beset us,
that so we may with patience run the race, that is set before us; for if it be
not in some measure laid aside, abated, and weakened, it will burden, hinder,
and entangle us in our spiritual race: hence, in the Italian translation, the
former words are thus read, the sin which does so easily hinder us: the
similitude (says (...)) seems to be taken from such long, and large garments,
as were wont to be laid of in such races, to be so much the more active: the
laying aside, that is, the mortification of this sin is a very difficult
task, and therefore in it we should look off from our selves, upon our head,
and Savior Christ Jesus, and this will encourage us, for he is the author,
and finisher of our faith, and faith will purify our hearts from original, and
actual sin: he has broken this head of the serpent for us, by his death and
passion, in which he gave for it ample satisfaction (...) the justice of God,
and he has also broken this head of the serpent in us by the remission and
mortification of it: and this work, that he has begun he will perfect, and
accomplish in our glorification; in which he will present us to himself
glorious, not having the least spot of lust, any the least pronenesse unto sin.

This mortification of concupiscence is of such necessity, and importance; as
that our Apostle, Gal. 5. 24. makes it the character of our christianity, our
relation unto Christ; they that are Christ's [the true, and genuine members of
Christ] have crucified the flesh, [that is, our original, and native lust]
with the affections and lusts [the affections: that is, the sudden passions,
and lusts, that is settled desires which it works,] those that do not
endeavor to mortify, to crucify the flesh, the corruption of their natures,
are not true, and real; but only nominall christians. The mortification of the
flesh is here compared unto a crucifixion; not only, because in part it
resembles it; but also, because it is from the virtue, and merit of Christ's
Cross, and by meditation thereon: for a (...) thus reasons with himself; my
inbred lust had a hand in the crucifying of my Savior; shall I then suffer it
to live, and reign in me? For it he hung upon a cross; and shall it then
have a (...) in my heart? shall I spare, and indulge that, which put him to so
painful, and shameful a death? No I will (as it were) nail it unto a cross
too, disable it for motion, so that it shall not have such liberty to revell it
up and down in my heart, and life as formerly.

The Apostle, not only recommendeth the subduing of the flesh unto others; but
also exemplifieth it by his own practice, 1 Cor. 9. 27. I keep under my body,
and bring it into subjection; where [by body] protestant writers generally
understand, that body whose deeds by the spirit are to be mortified, Romans 8,
13: that which is called, Rom 6. 6: the body of sin, Romans 7. 24: the body of
death: and even Estius Significat (...) in hac pugna (...) (...) corpus suum,
utique ratione carnis, id est, (...) concupiscentiae, de (...) dicit, Gal. 5.
Caro (...) adversus spiritum: (...) autem adversus carnem, Haec enim sibi
invicem (...) ideoque (...) perpetua pugna debet este contra carnem, (...) adeo
contra corpus nostrum, quatenus per carnem adversatur (...).
a (...) expositor, though he interpret it of the body, yet it is with regard
unto the flesh in it, the carnal concupiscence; of which Paul speaks, Gal. 5.
17: the flesh lusts against the spirit: the greek words (...) etc: (...),
are very emphaticall; (...) (as the Critics observe) is to strike about the
face, or under the eyes, to give black, or blew wounds in the places there
abouts; as Champions did unto their antagonists with their fists, or clubs;
(...), is to bring under, as masters did their slaves, when they were unruly,
wanton, or insolent, or, as wrestlers did their fellow combatants, when they
overcame them.

But you may now perhaps expect some directions for the mortification of
concupiscence; I shall in this last, point at three: First, lust is mortified
by sorrow for it, and hatred of it; it dies, when it dies in the affections, it
is crucified, when it is bewailed, and loathed. Secondly, lust is mortified by
the growth and (...) of grace, for, intenso altero contrariorum (...) reliquum;
when one contrary is height'ned, and intended, the other is thereby remitted,
depressed, and abated; the strengthenning of grace then, will weaken the
corruption of our nature: and therefore (whith Paul, Ephesians. 3. 14, 16. let us
bow our knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would grant us
according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might in the inner
man by his spirit, giving efficacy unto a diligent use of God's ordinances; for
this will decay and impair the old man.

A third way to mortify concupiscence is, to stop it is influence; for this must
needs enfeeble it, and (as it were) dishearten and discourage it; now this is
done, when it is motions, and desires are resisted, it is conceptions are
strangled in the womb, it is births (like brats of Babylon) Psalm. 137. 9: dashed
in pieces against the (...), i: e: destroyeyd by a timely repentance, and never
suffered to arrive unto any growth, or maturity.

For this hinderance of lusts operation, I shall prescribed two means one
inward, another outward.

First inward, and that will be to exert, and act all our (...), as much as
possibly we can, for contrary actions, as well as contrary qualities, will
weaken, and wound each other: the way then, to quench the lustings of the flesh
against the spirit, will be, to foment the lustings of the spirit against the
flesh, to entertain, and cherish all holy motions, thoughts, and desires.

Secondly outward, and that is, abstinence from the occasions, that are likely
to excite, and stir up concupiscence, that bring (as it were) (...) unto the
fire, and throw oil upon the flame thereof, for what were this? but to make
provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof? Romans 13. 14: we should
therefore take up David's resolution, Psalm 101. 3. I will set no wicked thing
before mine eyes; if we set wicked things before our eyes, they will soon
steal into our hearts, and there kindle a fire, that may never end, but in the
flames of hell, Prove. 23. v. 2, 31: put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man
given to appetite. Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it gives
it is color in the cup, when it moves it is self aright. Forbear gaming, if
thy experience inform thee, that it tempts thee unto either rash anger, or
covetousness, if thou find, that thou art prone unto wantonness, do not so
much as look upon an amorous romance; hearken unto the advice of Solomon,
Prove. 5. 8: remove thy way far from the strange woman, and come not (...) the
door of her house, imitate the prudence of Joseph, who, not only refused the
embraces of his mistrisse, but sled from her very sight, and presence. Genesis 39.
verse. 10, 12: he was more afraid of the temptation of his own lust, then of
all the charms in her beauty, and the importunity of her solicitations.

Thirdly, we may from the influence of lust be exhorted unto watchfullnesse
against it, and that in all the faculties of our souls, and members of our
bodies: we should trust none of them without Job's covenant, Job. 31. 1: or
David's bridle, Ps. 39. 1: Peter exhorts unto vigilance, because our adversary
the Devil as a roaring Lion walks about seeking whom (...) may (...): 1
Pet. 5. 8: But if it were not for the compliance, and correspondence of our own
lust, this roaring lion could do us no more hurt, than the Lions did Daniell
in the den: it is this that opens the door of our souls unto him, and so
betrayeth us unto his temptations: nay this would be an importunate, and
restless tempter, though Satan, and the world should surcease their
temptations; for it can conceive sin without a father, bring it forth without a
midwife, and breed it up without a nurse: concupiscence is a dangerous
adversary, not only, when as a King it commands all in the soul, but also,
when it is deposed from it is rule, and is in a subdued, nay in a crucified
condition, and therefore the most sanctified should keep on still their watch
against it, and be jealous of all it is motions, though they seem to be never
so weak and remiss: Mr. Knowles in his Turkish history relates a very strange
story concerning a wounded soldier, which I shall insert, and apply unto our
present purpose. After Amurath, the third King of the Turks, had overcome
Lazarus, the (...) of Servia, he (with some of his chief captains) taking view
of the dead bodies, a Christian (...) sore wounded, and all (...), seeing him,
in staggering manner arose out of an (...) of stayne men, and making toward
him, for want of strength fell oftentimes by the way, at length drawing nigh
unto him (when they that guarded the King's person would have stayed him) he
was by Amurath himsele commanded to come near, (...) sing, that he would have
craved his life of him: thus this half dead Christian, pressing near unto
him, as if he would for honors sake have kissed his feet, suddenly stabbed him
in the bottom of his belly with a short dagger, which he had under his
soldiers (...), of which wound, that great King and conqueror presently dyed:
unto this soldier every regenerate man may compare his own lust, though it be
in a wounded, nay dying, and mortified state, ready (as it were) to expire, and
give up the Ghost, yet, if we suffer it to arise from the dead, if we do not
hinder it is motions though they seem to be faint, and feeble, if we do not
continue a constant watch, and guard against it, but suffer it is approaches,
and give way unto a conference, and parley with it, it will soon smite us (as
it were) under the fist rib, give such a fatal blow, and stab unto the
conscience, as would soon make a total, and final dispatch, an utter riddance
of all the remainders of spiritual life in us, but that we are under the hands
of a Physician, unto whom belong the issues of death, who has a plaster of
divine, and infinite virtue, and value, his own heart blood, the blood of
God-man; and a sovereign balsome of infinite power, and efficacy, his spirit
which can cure the deepest, and most dangerous wounds of the soul, that
otherwise would be deadly.

Fourthly, from the influence of lust we may be exhorted unto thankfulness
for deliverance from it; and this exhortation may be addressed unto both the
unregenerate, and regenerate.

First, unto the unregenerate, who are delivered from it only in a way of
restraint; when they see malefactors imprisoned, stocked, whipped, dragged to
shameful executions, let them consider, that, if God did not withhold their
concupiscence from it is natural energie, it would have brought them into the
like case, made them as public spectacles of shame, as any; if it were not
for the bridle of God's (...) grace upon them, original sin would work in
them all manner of concupiscence, Romans 7. 8: out of the concupiscence, that is
in their hearts, would proceed (as waters stream from a fountain) not only
evil thoughts, but the most scandaloussinnes, Adulteries, fornications,
murders, (...), coveteousnesse, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil
eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness, Mar. 7. 21, 22: their lives would soon be
repleate with those odious, and abominable works of the flesh, which Paul
mentions, Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21: adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunknnesse, revellings, and
such like.

But, in a second place the regenerate have the greatest reason to be thankful
for their deliverance from concupiscence: because it is in a way of remission
from it is condemning power, in a way of mortisication from it is reigning power:
and hence is it that the Apostle, Paul after along discourse touching the
tyranny of it, concludes all with a doxologie for his freedom from it, I
thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord, Romans 7. 25: in the next words he
lays down the ground of this his thanksgiving: First, deliverance from the
dominion of the (...), by a contrary principle inclining unto contrary, and
better actions, with the (...) I my self serve the law of God: Secondly,
deliverance from the (...) of it, for the sake of his relation unto Christ,
there is noe condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, chap. 8. 1:
concupiscence is in them damnable, but yet it shall not actually condemn them,
and every Believer, every member of Christ has the same inducements to bless
God, that Paul here speaks of.

First, he has ground to praise him for the remission of concupiscence: if the
fault, that is in his concupiscence were not remitted, it would rise up in
judgment against him, and the desert of it is sufficient for the condemnation
of millions of worlds, and that single by it self, abstracted from all it is
black train, it is works, and fruits.

Secondly, he has ground to praise God for the mortification of his
concupiscence, as would soon be consessed, if he would but compare himself,
with himself, and others.

First, with himself: if he would compare his present with his past state: Oh!
reflect upon the temptations, conceptions, and births of lust in the days of
thy unregenerancy, which thou now blushest to own, consider how thy own lust
made thy heart, as it were, another hell, full of such black wishes, desires,
delights, and purposes, as thou now tremblest to think of, and then how can
thou but acknowledge thy deep obligation for that happy change, which God has
made in thy soul? that is, now become a temple of the holy Ghost, replenished
with all those gracious, and glorious fruits of the spirit, reckoned up by
Paul, Gal. 5. 22. 23.

Secondly, compare thy self with others, with the worst of men, and (...) of
sinners, and then weigh, that, if the power of (...) to tempt, to draw from
God, and entice unto sin were not in some measure in thee broken, and abated,
it might have rendered thee, as criminal, and scelestique, as any of them, as
those that are the greatest monsters of irreligion, and unjustice in the world:
Oh! seriously, and sadly propound unto thy self Paul's query, 1 Cor. 4. 7: who
(...) thee to differ from another? Alas! it was not, it could not be nature,
for thy nature is originally as corrupt and depraved as that of others: it is
grace then, that has made the distinction, and therefore say with Paul, and
say it with a grateful heart, by the grace of God I am what I am, 1 Cor. 15.
10: by the grace of God, a participation of the divine nature, it is, that I
have escaped the coruption, that is in the world through lust, 2 Pet. 1. 4.

There be also some duties regarding our (...), unto which we may, from this
malignant efficacy of sin, be pressed; at which I shall only lightly touch,
and so conclude.

First, we may hence be exhorted, to be careful in our watch (...) them,
diligent in our admonition of (...), frequent and (...) in our prayers for
them: exhort one another daily (says the Apostle) (...) it is called to day,
(...) any of you be hard ned through the deceitfullnesse of sin, Heb. 3. 15:
not only actual, but original sin is very deceitful, Romans 7. 11: seducing
the understanding with the mere shows of truth, the will with the bare
appearances of good, it is so deceitful Familiare scripturis est, ut peccatum,
seu concupiscentia dicatur homines seducere, decipere, (...), and (...), ut
Romans 7. (...). 12 (...). 1. Idautem (...) per quandam (...), (...) homo
tentatione (...), velut suasione sollicitatus and inductus est, (...)
consentit, quasi ab ipso (...) persuasus; fit autem (...) modo, (...), dum cor
(...) (...) (...), paulatim (...) adversus praecepta (...). Estius in locum.
that it soon tempts, not only into sin, but into obduration in sin:
whilst by it s temptations it softens, and even melts the heart in the
delights of sin, it hardens it toward the commands of God: now from this we
may infer our obligation, unto an assiduous diligence, in admonishing of one
another, in order, unto the discovery, and prevention of all it is deceites,
wiles, and policies: exhort one another daily, whilst it is called to day, we
may extend, what the Apostle says, further unto all other acts of Christian
communion: watch over one another, warn, and advise one another, pray for one
another daily, whilst it is called to day; whilst ye have time, and
oppoertunity, lest any of you be hardened, through the deceitfulness of this
sin; which without the preventing grace of God is able to harden any of us,
the very best of us: unto this place, let me add another of the same Apostle
in the same Epistle (at least by way of allusion unto the words) Heb. 12. 15:
Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of
bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: there is a
root of bitterness in every one of our hearts: this radical sin, and this
root is of it self very apt to spring up, and to bring forth a venomous, and
mischeivous fruit; to trouble the peace, and quiet of the Church; and to
diffuse a spreading, and infectious scandal to defile many: now from this we
may learn, that there is a necessity, that we should be overseers, and
superintendents one toward another; (...), looking diligently, that is, one
toward another, and with all exciting, stirring up, and quickening one another
graces; for it is from the languor and decay of God's grace, that the corruption
of our natures grows fruitful: when we fail of the grace of God, then the
root of bitterness springs up, and fructifieth, but of all those, that come
under our care, and inspection, we are to have a more especial regard unto our
own families; and in them unto our little children; for their age, and
innocence does not exempt them from the temptations, and operations of their
own lust: they are (...) from the womb, the imagination of man's heart is
evil from his youth, Genesis 8. 21: man is borne like a wild Asses colt, Job. 11.
12: foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, Prove. 22. 15: this root of
bitterness begins to operate in little children, as soon as they come unto
actual use of reason, and therefore we should be very (...) (to do what we
can) to repress it is workings, by early instructions, and seasonable
corrections.

Secondly, we may hence be persuaded to sugar, and sweeten our (...) of (...)
with meekness and moderation, Gal. 6. 1: if a man be overtaken in a fault,
(...) which are spiritual, restore such a (...), in the spirit of (...),
considering thy self, (...) thou also be tempted: here spiritual is taken in
opposition, not unto the unregenerate, as it is used, 1 Cor. 2. 15: but unto
weak Christians, babes in Christ, and so it is understood chap. 3. verse. 1: by
spiritual persons then are understood, those that are strong in the faith, of
full age, who by reason of use have their senses (...) to (...) both good and
evil, Heb. 5. 14: now the Apostle, to induce these spiritual persons unto
(...), and gentleness in their reproves, propounds unto them the
consideration of their own frailty, and obnoxiousnesse unto surprisall by
sin; considering thy self lest thou also be (...); as if he should have
said; suppose thou art spiritual, an eminent Christian, one extraordinarily
gifted, with the gifts of both edification, and sanctification; yet if thou will duly consider the depravation of thy nature, thou must needs be sensible
that it is no impossible thing for thee, to be tempted, drawn, and enticed by
thy own lust, into the very same faults, with which thy weaker brethren are
overtaken; and for which they are now under the lash of thy censures, thy lust
may conceive, and bring forth the same sins; meditation upon this, would take
of much from the rigor, severity, and unclemency, that usually is in our
reprehensions; which makes them to be mistaken, for railings; and deemed to
proceed from an hostile, and not fraternall affection; it would incline us to
reprehend our falling, and failing brethren, with such tenderness, as a
Surgeon handles his patients; and so much, may be imported by the word here
translated, restore, (...), for (...), signifies to set a bone, that is
broken, or out of joint; and this is, or should be done with a tender hand, and
(...) heart.

Ecclesiastes, 7. 29. Lo, this only have I found, that God has made man
upright, but they have sought out many inventions.
IN the verse foregoing, Solomon complains of the general depravation of
mankind: one man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those
have I not found: in the words there is an (...), (...), sive (...); so that
the words [ one] and [ none] are here taken for few, and fewer, as it is
observed in the Dutch Annotations: if ye take the words properly, the last
clause is to be limited unto his outlandish wives, and concubines, that seduced
him unto Idolatry; who are said to be a thousand, 1 Kin, 11. 3: seven hundred
wives three hundred concubines: amongst all these, there was not so much as one
prudent, and good woman; now lest any, should hereupon throw the blame of this
upon God, for giving man so depraved a nature, he clears God, by laying down
two conclusions.

The First, concerning the state of man by creation, God made man upright.

The second, concerning the state of man by his apostasy, and defection from
God; but they have sought out many inventions.

Unto these two Conclusions he premiseth a preface; Lo this only have I found;
wherein we have three things remarkable: First, the importance of these two
conclusions; employed in the note of attention [ Lo!] Secondly, the means, by
which he came to the knowledge of them, diligent search, and study into the
word, and will of God, [ this have I found.] Thirdly, a comparison of them with
other points, he found them [only.]

First, here is the weight and importance of these two conclusions, employed in
the note of attention [ Lo:] and the weight, and concernment of them may be
gathered. First, from the influence of them upon practice; being well studied,
they will make us thankful unto God; humble in, and watchful over our selves;
charitable unto others, in admonishing of them, and praying for them. Secondly,
from the pronenesse that is in men to justify themselves, and accuse God for
the corruption of their natures: let no man (says James) say, when he is
tempted, I am tempted of God, James 1. 13: this prohibition implies, that men
are apt to say, that they are tempted by God.

Secondly, we have the means by which Solomon came to the knowledge of these
two points; diligent search, and study into the word, and will of God: this
have I found; to wit, by inquiring after divine revelations, the light of
nature, and reason can never discover, that Adam was made upright. as the
representative of all mankind; and that, his fall from this uprightness was
imputable, and derivable to all mankind: indeed the Lord of Plessie Marlie in
his work entitled the trueness of Christian religion, chap 26, proves, by
natural reasons; that man's nature is corrupted, that man is fallen from his
first original, and for it also chap. 27: he alleges the testimonies of
diverse ancient Philosophers: indeed, by the woeful effects, they had a
confused knowledge of the (...), that there was a great confusion, and disorder
in the soul of man; but first, however they knew it to be vitium, a blemish,
or infirmity of nature; yet doubtless the generality of them was ignorant that
it was peccatum, a fault, or sin.

Secondly, reason, though never so much improved, could never attain unto so
much as a glimmering of it is (...), the cause whence it came: it fared with
them, as with Rebecca, Genesis 25. 22: two children strugled together within her
womb, and (...) said, if it be so, why am I thus? so they, by daily
experience, find contrary appetices struggling within them; but they cannot
guess at the cause of this unnatural war; and therefore they say, as she, if
it be so, why are we thus? and unto this demand it is impossible to have any
satisfying answer, unless they do, as she did in the close of the verse,
she went to inquire of the Lord.

This then may discover the true reason, why Papists, Socinians, and Arminians,
have been at such a loss, touching original righteousness, and original
sin: they have not taken such a course, as Rebecca here; they have not gone
to inquire of the Lord, they have consulted reason only, and not scripture,
they have followed Aristotle, not Paul, for their guide.

Thirdly, we have a comparison of these conclusions, with other points of
doctrine; shinted in the particle [only:] this only have I found; this, and
nothing else. But sounds not this very strangely? was Solomon such a truant,
such a sorry proficient in the study of divinity, as to know only two heads
thereof, original righteousness, and original sin? sure then he was not
gifted, or qualified for the office of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, for he had
been unable to declare all the counsel of God.

For Answer unto this

First, this particle [only] is to be taken, not simply, but secundum quid,
Solummodo hoc inveni: Hic notatur concupiscentiae (...) litas, quae quidem non
(...) a Deo, sed a (...) (...), (...) solummodo hoc inveni, quod fecit Deus
hominem (...). Bonavent.
in relation unto that depravation of mankind, spoken of in the foregoing
verse: this only have I found; to wit, as touching the cause of it; first,
negatively; that God is not the cause of it; for he made man upright: secondly,
affirmatively; that man himself is the cause of it; But they have sought out
many inventions. If it be objected, that the Devil was also a cause of the
corruption of man's nature, and therefore the Preachers resolution of it into
man alone is defective; he might have found, that Satan propounded unto our
first parents many inventions, as well, as that they sought out many inventions.

For answer; Satan was the cause of our first parents fall, or sin, only per
modum suadentis, not per modum (...) determinantis, he was only a counselling,
and persuading cause, and that is only an imperfect cause, only a moral cause,
he was not of sufficient efficacy to make them sin, for, nothing can be the
sufficient cause of sin unto man, besides his own will, as Aquinas Nil (...)
potest este homini (...) (...) (...), quod est spiritualis (...), (...) propria
voluntas, and ideo dicta, vel fact a alterius hominis (...) else solum causa
imperfecte (...) (...) ad ruinam.
rightly 2 a. 2ae. q: 43. Ar. 1. ad 3 m; nothing can compel, or determine him
thereunto: so then, notwithstanding Satan's temptations, the Preacher says
truly touching the causation of that pollution, which is in our nature; that
it is only to be attributed to the fall of our first parents, because they of
their own accord have freely sought out many inventions.

There Is a second (...) of the word translated [only] that makes it to amount
to no more than chiefly; and indeed, some Logicians say, that exclusive
particles sometimes exclude not, a (...) a (...), but only a summitate (...),
and, if the particle may be thus interpreted, then Solomon by the addition
thereof signifies; that the principal thing, that is to be remarked, touching
the sinfullnesse of men is; that God was not the cause of it, by his creation
of man's nature; but that our first parents were authors thereof, by their fall
from that rectitude, in which God created them, God has made man upright, but
they have sought out many inventions: now the pre-eminence of this above all
other doctrines, touching the sinfulness of man, is very evident unto those,
that look upon sin, as the scripture describes it; for it is the foundation
of all true sincere sorrow for sin, and mortification of it: the knowledge of
an effect is ever confused, until we understand it is cause; so our sight of
sin is never distinct, and accurate, until we come to a veiw of the
original of all sin; and when this fountain of sin is found out,
original sin, both imputed, and inherent, it will be then a far more easy
work, than formerly, to discover the streams of actual sins.

There Is a third interpretation of the particle yet behind, which renders it,
seorsim, The original word (...) most directly signisicth (...), apart. so
that it sccmeth to me, that the (...) (...) may be that (...) in the
consideration of man the works of God, and the (...) of man be found the
works of God to be right all and that it was man himself who had made
himself and his works to a perverse and (...).
apart, or severally; and, by this exposition, Solomon professes, that he has
separated, in his consideration, God's work, from man's work; God's work in
the creating of man's nature upright; and man's work in the defiling of his
nature by his fall; wherein he sought out many inventions: and (...)
separation, (...).
of God's act, and man's act, being (...) made, may sufficiently instruct
concerning the cause of (...) irrectitude in men, and women, of which he
complains in the verse preceding, that it is not God, but man himself.

Having thus briefly run over the praecognita, proceed we next unto the
conclusions themselves.

The first conclusion, concerns original righteousness, the second concerns
original sin.

The first conclusion concerns original righteousness; God made man upright;
not only with an uprightness of innocence, but also with an uprightness of
sanctity: but of this before at large.

The second conclusion concerns original sin; peccatum originale originans;
the fall of our first parents; they have sought out many inventions: these
words describe the fall of our first parents, not as it is considered formally,
in it self; but metonymically, by it is motives, or effects: by it is motives,
if we understand them only of our first parents; by it is effects, if we extend
them unto their posterity also.

First, by it is motives, if we understand them of our first parents only; they
sought out many (...): that is, plurima (...), many reasonings, as Junius, and
Tremelius render the word, they found out many reasons, arguments, or motives
to eat of the forbidden fruit; and what they did, in this their first sin,
is reckoned to be done by us their offspring, because we were represented by
them, and contained in them; even as Levi is said to pay tithes in Abraham,
because, he was in the loins of his Father Abraham, when Melchisedech (...)
him, Heb. 7. 9, 10.

Against this interpretation there are two doubts. Quod autem quaesivisse
dicuntur ratiocinia, quae tamen illis non (...) a serpente antiquo (...) (...)
sunt: eo docere voluit, illas frauds (...) avide (...) arreptas fuisse. Quod
vero dicit plurima (...) (...), cum tamen (...) testetur duplici tantum ratione
pellectos fuisse, nempe quod corpori simul and animae (...) (...) verito fructu
comedere, sciendum est in his multas rations comprehendi. Nam quod aperiendi
illis essent oculi, and ipsi Deo assimulandi, multiplicem rationem continet:
fore ut Deo felicitate per omnia similes sorent; non minus quam ille sapientes,
potentes, (...), omnique virtute consummati: Ad corpus quod attinet sibi in
animum (...) fructum illum esu jucundum, and (...) (...). Cartwright in locum.


The first, these reasons or motives were first propounded by Satan, and
therefore not sought out by them; they were his temptations, and not so
properly their own inventions.

Answer; They are said to be sought out by them, as their inventions; because
they so greedily, and speedily embraced them; their acceptance of them
answered Satan's temptations, as an echo; and there is such resemblance
betwixt a voice, and an echo; as that standers by sometimes can hardly
discern betwixt them.

A second doubt is, concerning the multitude of these inventions, or reasons;
they have found out many inventions: now Moses, in his history, mentions but
a few motives, or arguments, that induced them to this fact, Genesis 3. 6: and
when the woman saw, that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant
to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise; she took of the fruit
thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat:
improbable therefore that the Preacher speaks of these reasons, or motives.

Answer. These motives were very comprehensive; though they were formally, and
expressly few, yet they were implyedly many: that one design to be wise, to
have their eyes opened, knowing good and evil, virtually comprehended many
other plots, dependent upon it: or concomitant with it: they hoped, that their
knowledge, and wisdom would be backed, or accompanied with an equal power,
and so able to effect whatsoever they desired: they projected then, not only to
be as knowing; but also as powerful, and in every thing as happy, and glorious
as Gods.

But some may think, that this exposition is somewhat strayned, and far
fetched; and therefore I shall propound a second, which extends the clause, not
only unto them, but to all their posterity also, that descend from them in an
ordinary way of generation: and so the fall of our first parents is here set
forth by it is mediate effects, the inventions of them, and their progeny:
touching their actual sins, which issue from original corruption inherent in
both, as streams from a fountain, and branches from a tree; they have all
sought out many inventions. First, for the committing of sin. Secondly, for
the defending of sin. Thirdly, for the extenuating of sin. Fourthly, for
the concealing of sin.


First, for the committing of sin: and so the clause may be verified either of
the same, or of several men, and both again of the same, or several sins.

First, of the same sins; and that in regard, either of the motives for,
means unto, or manners of committing them:

First, they have found out many inventions; that is, many motives and reasons
to incite themselves unto the same sins: thus an Harlot, is allured unto her
libidinous course of life, by pleasure, and by profit, by a desire to maintain
her self in idleness, and gaiety of apparel, by a vain, and proud delight
that she takes in the courtings, and adorations of her beauty: thus in an
unworthy, and sinful compliance with the vices of the times, there may be a
concurrence of many impulses, servile fear, covetousness, vainglory, and
ambition; but now, though men may by variety of arguments tempt themselves unto
the same sins; yet there is no solidity in any of these arguments; they are
but inventions, have no more reality in them, than poetical fictions.

Secondly, they have found out many inventions; that is, many means and ways
for the practicing of the same (...): how many are the wiles by which an
adultresse devises to defile her husbands bed? who can reckon up all those
unlawful practices, tricks, deceits, cheats, and fetches, by which misers
scrape, and hoard up wealth in an inordinate way? and it is not as impossible
to trace all the bypathes, and crooked ways, by which the ambitious ascend
their undeserved honors, and preferments.

Thirdly, they have (...) out many inventions; that is, many ways and manners
of acting the same sins. Tiberius instituted (says (...)) a new office
forsooth, a (...), for the devising of new, and various pleasures; he had also
(as the same Author) monstrosi concubitus repertores, such as invented
monstrous kinds of libidinous filthiness; indeed not only he, but diverse
others of the Romans (as their Historians and Satyrists inform us) used such
unnatural ways of lust, and uncleanness, as modesty prohibits the recital
of them; and the devisers of them may be those inventors of evil things, of
which the Apostle speaks, Romans 1. 30: But to speak of our own times; the
drammatique poetry of our age has been very inventive; and (...) was never
able to keep pace with the various, and quaint frauds of cheaters; with the
several modes, and methodes of drinking unmeasurable healthes; with those
horrid oaths, and blasphemies, that some men (shall I say rather incarnate
Devils) daily coin, and boast of such coynage, as a rare invention; with those
monstrous, and ridiculous fashions in apparel, and otherwise, by which the
gallants of both sexes express their pride, and vanity.

Secondly, this clause may be understood of several sins they have found
out: many inventions; that is, they have invented many forts, and kinds of
sins; First, many sins against the first table; much profaneness, and
neglect of duties; many (...), and heretical inventions against the truth of
God; many superstitious, and idolatrous inventions against the worship of God.

Secondly, many sins against the second table; many vile, unjust, and
uncharitable practices in the way of converse with, and carriage toward men.

If this be the sense of the clause, there be three things observable in it:
First, the nature and original of men's sins, they are their [inventions;]
Secondly, their numerousnesse [many] Thirdly, their voluntarinesse [sought out.]

First, their nature and original: they proceeded from their own invention,
and therefore called their inventions: the ground of all sin is, that men lay
aside the unerring rule of God's word, and will, and invent rules of their own
to walk by: our first parents had never fallen, but that they first suspected,
and then disrelished the supposed rigor of God's precept; and hereupon chalked
out unto themselves a way unto happiness, that in truth, and reality lead
down unto the chambers of Death: what made Saul run upon a worser sin, than
that of witchcraft, rebellion against his maker.? a sin that rooted out him,
and all his posterity? but that he undervallued God's command, and followed his
own judgment, his own invention? God commanded him to smite (...), and utterly
to destroy all that they had, and to spare them not; but to (...), both man,
and woman, infant, and suckling, ox, and sheep, Camel, and Ass, 1 Samuel 15. 3:
but he devised (as he thought) a more prudent, and politic course; he
reserved their King for triumph or ransom; and the best of their cattle, for
spoil, and plunder; though he pretended it was for sacrifice, in Psalm. 106.
verse 43: that which the Psalmist calls, the counsel of the Israelites, in the
former part of the verse; he terms their iniquity in the latter part: they
provoked him with their (...), and were brought low for their iniquity: now,
from this collation, the inference is (...); that men's own counsel is their
iniquity: men sin, when they are guided by their own counsels, and
inventions; the best way then, for prevention of sin, is not to be directed
by our own counsels, and inventions, but to keep exactly unto the perfect rule
of righteousness, the law, and testimony of God: I hate vain thoughts, but
thy law do I love (says the Psalmist, Psalm: 119. 113.) the cause of his
hatred of vain thoughts, was his love of the law of God: so, on the contrary,
distaste at the laws of God is the principle of all vain thoughts, and sinful
inventions: because men do not love God's law, therefore they love vain
thoughts, they seek out many inventions.

This note, as it may be averred of all sin in general; so in a more
special manner of will worship, and (...); for what is it other, than humane
invention, the offering of strange fire to the Lord, which he commanded not?
Levit. 10. 1: the setting of our posts by God's posts, our thresheld by his
threshold? Ezekiel. 43. 8: what was the cause of the Israelites Idolatry against
the second commandment, the same thing with superstition, but their desertions
of God's ceremonial Law, (that was to be the adequate rule of instituted
worship,) and their seeking, and following of many inventions? and with what
severity did God both threaten, and punish this Idolatry of the Israelites, you
may read at large in the old Testament.

Secondly, we have the numerousnesse of man's sins; many inventions: the (...)
inventions, which the deceitful hearts of men have sought out, are so various,
and numerous: as that they are unsearchable by any, but the Lord himself, who
(...) the heart, and tries the (...), Jer. 17. 9, 10: Unto this, at least by
way of allusion, we may apply that of the Prophet Isay, 57. 10: thou art (...)
in the (...) of thy way: the way to hell is so great, and broad, the paths in
it so many, the sinful inventions which wicked men seek, and pursue are so
infinite as that it is no wonder, that they are quite tired out in their
journey: they are in this respect as a swift Dromedary traversing her ways,
Jer. 2. 23: The late annotations.
that is; several ways running, when she is proud, or hot with lust, to and
fro after several males, one while after one of them, and another while after
another.

Thirdly, we have the voluntarinesse of man's sins, they are of their own
seeking; they are their own inventions: they not only greedily embraced, what
(...) counsels were propounded by others; but of themselves, of their own
accord sought out many inventions; they sinned not only by others temptatinos,
but by their own inventions, Hosea. 4. 8. Eccles. 8. 11.

Secondly, men have found out many inventions, as for the committing, so for
the defending of sin: how many inventions have the Papists sought out for the
supporting of Papal monarchy, and usurpations? for the patronage of their
idolatries, in their invocation of Saints, worshipping of images, (...) of
mass, and for the defense of all other execrable tenets, and practices in
their religion? But, what talk we of Papists? some among us, who profess a
great distance from Antichrists, have (to the reproach of our nation) made
shameless apologies for libertinisme, profanation of the Sabbath, polygamie,
sacrilege, disobedience unto magistrates, neglect, and contempt of all God's
ordinances.

Thirdly, they have found out many inventions, for the extenuating, excusing,
palliating of sin; of which see Dyke at large in the deceitfullnesse of the
heart: I shall instance only, in the excuse of sin, translation of it upon
another cause, because herein our first parents were precedentiall unto all
their posterity: Adam transferred the blame of his fall unto the Woman, nay he
fathered it implyedly upon God himself, Genesis 3. verse. 12: the man said, the
woman, whom thou gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat:
it is, as if he should have said, if thou had suffered me to have been alone,
I had still been innocent; it is this companion, whom thou have given me, that
has enticed, and undone me: and Eve for her part, translates all the fault
upon the Serpent, verse. 13: and the woman said, the serpent beguiled me, and I
did eat, this example, of our first parents, is imitated but, too too well by
their sinsull progeny: there are that in their hears, though not in their
words, impute their sins unto God's decrees, and providence, and others
(which comes all to one) blame, the malignant influence of their stars, the
good creatures of God; they were borne (they will say) under an unlucky planet;
others complain of Satan, and the world: the Devil is a wily serpent, the
world a cunning strumpet; and how is it possible for such imprudent, and
ignorant creatures as we, either to discover or evade their artifices, and
stratagems? the Devil (say some) owed me a spite; others discharge their
sins upon the infortunity of their condition, and relations: it was poverty
(says the (...)) that made me steal; it is the greatness of my charge, and
family (says the worldling) that makes me osten pass by family duties, that
makes me seem a covetous niggard; it was provocation (says the swearer) that
made me take God's name in vain; it was ill language (says the manslayer)
made me strike; it was bad company (says the intemperate person) has seduced
me unto this excess of riot: I should never thus have frequented tavernes, and
alehouses (says another drunkard) but that my calling ingageth me there to
meet, and confer with chapmen: I had plied my vocation, and kept my house
(says a third) but that the the tempest of my wives tongue ever and anon drove
me out of doors; I had never been disloyal, and unchaste (says the
adultresse) but that my husband was unkind, and jealous.

Lastly, men have found out many inventions for the concealing of their sins:
very observable unto this purpose is that place in Job. 31. 33: If I covered my
transgressions, as Adam: by hiding mine iniquity in my (...): here the word [
Adam] may be taken, either as the proper name of the first man; or as the
common name of all men: first, as the proper name of the first man; he did what
he could to hide his sin, Genesis 3. 8: and as the common name of all men; and
so it is as much as, after the manner of men, as it is varied in the margin; and
so, we may note from the words; that it is the guise and manner of men to cover
their transgressions, to hide their iniquity in their bosom: in this regard,
what Solomon says of the way of an adulterous woman, Prove. 30. 20: is incident
unto other sinners; they cate, and wipe their mouths, and say we have done no
(...): the way of most sinners (save those impudent ones, that declare their
sins as Sodom) may be compared (for secrecy, and concealment) to the way of
a man with a maid, to the way of an Eagle in the air, the way of a serpent
upon the rock, the way of the ship in the midst of the sea, which leave no
track, or foot-step behind them: David was a man after God's own heart, and
yet, what sad inventions did he seek out to hide the shame of his adultery
with Bathsheba? first, he made Uriah drunk, that in that distemper he might
go home to ly with his wife; and so father that bastard, which he had begotten
on her; and when this would not do, gave directions unto (...), for the
contrivance of his death, which could not be effected, but by the fall also of
diverse other innocent subjects of David's, 2 Samuel 11.

The words, as hitherto expounded, run of sin considered indefinitely; there
be also that restrain them unto one particular sin, men's erroneous
inventions concerning their supreme (...), and happiness, and the ways, and
means leading thereunto: indeed this may be called a (...) sin; because it is
(...) with every sin; in every sin, there is an aversion from the right end
God, and a conversion unto some wrong end in our selves, or the creatures:
several men propound unto themselves several chief ends; some pleasure, some
profit, some honor, some knowledge, and learning; nay, the very same men do
so succestively: in the morning of their days men usually aim at sensual
pleasures; and in their riper years their aims are as vain, dirt, air and
smoke, riches, and honors, etc: childrens ends are toys, and trifles; and,
when the days of childish vanity are past over, men dream to be happy in the
embraces of some rich, beautiful, and loving wife; but they are soon cloyed
with the sweets of marriage, which are quickly embittered, and over balanced
by it is greater cares, and troubles; and then men comomnly promise to
themselves a great deal of comfort, and happiness in their little children,
and they when they grow up to maturity, prove many times the greatest crosses
of their lives; and so bring down their gray hairs with sorrow to the grave:
now, the reason of this variety, and vagrancy, that is in wicked men's desires
about their chief ends, is the unsatisfactorinesse, which is in all sinite,
and inseriour ends; unto which men divert from God, who alone is an infinite;
and therefore all satisfying good: in the ways of sin, and lust, in the
fruition of the creatures there is nothing but vanity, and vexation of spirit; no
rest for the sole of the souls foot, Genesis 8. 9: and therefore no wonder, that
men, in a natural condition, make their end to be, one while to satisfy this
lust, and another while to satisfy that; one while to enjoy this creature,
another while to enjoy that: when men for sake the fountain of living waters;
they then hew, and dig out unto themselves (many cisternes) (...) (...), that
will hold no water, Jer. 2. 13: when they neglect the unum necessarium, the one
thing that is needful, they are soon (with Martha) careful, and troubled about
many things, Luke 10. 41. Carnal men's desires of happiness are consused, and
unsettled; for, they are the many (of whom the Psalmist speaks, Psalm. 4. 6.)
that say, who will show us any good? they do not pitch upon the true, and only
good; yet they desire, in a general way, to be happy; but they know not where
this happiness lies; and therefore is it, that (in the prosecution of it)
they post, and run from creature to creature, from lust to lust, from sin to
sin; they seek out many inventions, and do not fix (as David) upon the
lifting up of the light of God's countenance upon them: and thus have I given
you the sense of the words, according unto our translation; I shall briefly
acquaint you with other rendrings of them, and so conclude my meditations upon
them.

First, the Septuagint render the word we translate inventions, (...), Junius
renders it ratiocinia, reasonings, or disputings; Luther, arts: Some translate
it deliberations; others (of which Diodati is one) expound it so largely as to
take in all thoughts, imaginations, and counsels, that are vain, false,
sinful, and exalt themselves against the knowledge of God; Symmachus turns
the whole clause thus, (...), operati sunt curiositatem (...) variam
negotiationem; they were become polypragmatists, they toyled, and busied
themselves with many curious, and (...) affairs, that were utterly unrelated
unto their chief end, the glory of God, and salvation of their souls; Bernard
renders it thus, ipse autem se implicuit (...) (...), he inwrapped himself in
many griefs, troubles, difficulties, perplexities, and miseries, Titil (...)
vult quaestionum nomine contineri omnem (...), perplexitatem, miseriam, in quis
homines post primum parentem, qui naturam ipsam involvit, se quoque ipsi
involvunt.
Adam's fall was, as it were, a Pandora's box, out of which flew all the evils,
and calamities, with which the world is replenished; in the vulgar latin it is
ipse (...) infinitis miscuit quaestion bus, he has mingled himself, or (as
the Divines of Doway express it) he has entangled himself with infinite or
numberless questions; (...) Alapide Quaestiones significant cupiditates,
quibus scatet homo, per (...): quaestiones enim notant cupiditatum originem,
and fontem, (...) quod prodeant ex (...) (...) and sciendi, puta ex (...)
sentiendi, and experiendi, quid in qualibet re sit bonum, (...) and (...).
(...) ad primam quaestionem serpenus, quam movit Evae, dicens; cur praecepit
Deus vobis, ut non comederetis de ligno (...) boni and mali? Gen (...) ad quam
quaestionem in curlositatem gustandi pomi exarsit Eva, illudque (...), ac eodem
maritum nosque omnes perdidit, arque suam curiositatem and concupiscentiam in
posteros omnes (...).
thinks, that questions here signify lusts and sins in general, by a
metalepsis; because all lusts, and sins have in some sort their original
from questions; the first sin of our first parents had it is rise from the
question of the serpent, Genesis 3. 1: He said unto the woman, yea, has God said
ye shall not eat of every tree of the Garden? and (...) by listening unto this
question ruined herself, her husband, and all her posterity; and in ensuing
sins the sinner has ever some questions: First, interpretatively he questions,
and disputes the authority of God's commands; and next, commonly, he has some
question concerning some creature, or other, to sind out what is good, and
evil in it; and thirdly, some question concerning the sin committed, a
curious itch to experience what sweetness and delight there is therein.

But the generality of Popish interpreters understand the clause more
particularly of the ignorance, (...), and contentiousnesse of lapsed man,

First, of his ignorance: for questions presuppose ignorance, and doubts; to
say that man has mingled himself with infinite questions, is as much as to
say, man is ignorant, sull of queries, in search of which he languisheth away
his days: this the endless disputes of Philosophers, de summo (...),
concerning man's chief good, and end, do plainly witness; for these imply
that man is naturally (...) of it, and at some loss about it.

Secondly, of his (...); he has mingled himself with insinite questions; to
wit, curious, nice, and unpresitable questions, that have no tendency to
edification; such as the Apostle speaks of, 1 Timothy 1. 4: and 6. 4: of this
curiosity the schoolmen are a sad example; many of whose questions are, like
spiders webs, curiously spun but (...) to catch flies, than souls.

Thirdly, of his contentiousnesse, he has mingled himself with infinite
questions; that is, brawles, disputes, and quarrels; and that both with
himself, and others.

First, with himself; how frequent, and warm are the contests in his own
bosom, betwixt his rational, and sensual powers? ever and anon his sensitive
appetite disputes the most rational dictates of his understanding, and the
most regular commands of his will.

Secondly, with others; with strangers, and nearest neighbors, with foes, and
most intimate, and dearest friends, with his most faithful servants, with the
wife of his bosom, the children of his bowels.

Pineda observes; that there is an Auxesis in the word [mingled;] so that it
signifies man is ingulfed in, and (as it were) swallowed up of questions: they
are (as it were) incorporated into him, and he (as it were) compounded, and
made up of them; he is wholly, and altogether a questionist.

But the Reader may perhaps think, that I stay too long upon these several
versions, seeing the word [ Chishbonoth] has but one signification in the
whole scripture: it signifies inventions (as it is rendered by our Translatours)
and nothing else.

FINIS.
Certain Letters OF HENRY IEANES Minister of Gods word AT CHEDZOY. AND Dr
JEREMY TAILOR Concerning A passage of his, in his further Explication of
Original sin.

OXFORD,

Printed by HEN: HALL for THO: ROBINSON, 1660.

Dr Tailor in his further explication of the doctrine of original sin, page
496.
THat every man is inclined to evil, some more, some less, but all in some
instances; is very true: and it is an effect, or condition of nature, but no
sin properly; 1: because that which is unavoidable is not a sin; 2: because
it is accidental to nature, not intrinsecall, and essential; 3: It is
superinduced to nature, and is after it, etc.

To the unprejudiced Reader.
I shall only give thee a brief narrative of the occasion of the ensuing
letters: one Mr T. C. of Bridgwater being at my house, brake out into
extraordinary, (that I say not excessive, and Hyperbolicall) praises of Dr
Jeremy Tailor; I expressed my concurrence with him in great part; nay I came
nothing behind him in the just co^mendations of his admirable wit, great parts,
quick and elegant pen, his abilites in Critical learning, and his profound
skill in antiquity: but notwithstanding all this I professed my dissent from
some of his opinions which I judged to be erroneous; and I instanced in his
doctrine of original sin; now his further explication of this lay then
causually in the window (as I take it) which hereupon I took up, and turned
unto the passage now under debate, and showed unto Mr T. C. that therein was
gross nonsense, and blasphemy; he for his own part, with a great deal of
modesty, forthwith declined all further dispute of the business, but withal he
told me, that he would, If I so pleased, give Dr Tailor notice of what I said;
whereunto I agreed, and in a short time he brought me from the Dr a fair, and
civil invitation to send him my exceptions, and with it a promise of a candid
reception of them; whereupon I drew them up in a letter unto Mr T. C. the Copy
whereof follows.

Letters of the Author And Dr JEREMY TAILOR To Mr T. C.
Sir,
I have here, according unto your desire sent you my (...) against that rassage
in Dr Tailor, concerning which you (...) at my house; It is in his further
explication of the Doctrine of original sin, page: 496: and it is the second
argument, which he brings to prove; that inclination to evil is no sin
properly; because it is accidental to nature, not intrinsecall and essential.
The argument put into sorme may be reduced into two syllogismes.

The first.

Sin properly is not accidental to the nature of man.

An inclination to evil is accidental to the nature of man: therefore

An inclination to evil is no sin (...).

A second Syllogism is.

Sin properly so called is intrinsecall, and essential to the nature of man.

An inclination to evil is not intrinsecall, and essential to the nature of
man: therefore,

An inclination to evil is not sin properly so called.

Unto the first of those syllogismes; I answer that the major is false; and
that according to Porphyry his so celebrated desinition of an accident.
Accidens est quod adest, and abest sine (...) interitu: that is, as the best
Commentators upon Porphyry expound the words. An accident is that, which may be
affirmed, or denied of it is subject, without any repugnancy, or contradiction
to the essence, and desinition thereof; now to deny sin of man, gives no
overthrow to his essence and definition, for a man that is no sinner may be
animal (...); sin therefore is accidental to the nature of man.

The major of the second syllogism is (...) less salse, than that of the
first, as for the term, intrinsecall, I shall not stay upon it; because the
(...) uses it as equivalent to essential, as is apparent by the (...), he
puts between (...) and accidental; but shall wholly insist upon the word (...):
To say, as the Dr does hy consequence, that sin is essential to the nature
of man, is an assertion, guilty of nonsense, Blusphemy, and libertinisme.

1. Nonsense. A thing may be said to be essential unto an other, either a
priori, and then it is (...) of it, in primo modo dicendi perse; or else (...)
posteriori, and then it is predicated of it, in secundo modo dicendi per se.
And to say that finne is either of these ways essential to the nature of man,
is such pitiful, and prodigious nonsense, as that I cannot think it (...) of
any serious refutation.

In a second place I charge it with Blasphemy: it blasphemes three actions,
three acts of God.

1. The creation of man. 2. The incarnation of Christ. 3. The full (...) of the
Saints at the resurrection.

1. The creation of man: God was the Author of whatsoever was essential unto
man; And if sin be essential unto the nature of man, then God was the Author
of sin. 2. The (...) of Christ: in which God made Christ like unto man in
essentialls; If sin then be (...) unto the nature of man, God made Christ
sinsull; a blasphemy that I tremble to mention. 3. This opinion blasphemes
God's full glorification of the Saints in the resurrection; for it affirms by
just consequence, that they shall be raised with sin; because doublesse they
shall be raised with whatsoever is essential to the nature of man.
In the third, and last place this Tenet is chargeable with (...): It Is a
licentious doctrine, and opens a gap to the greatest (...); for it takes away
all conscience of sin, all repentance of it for the time past, all caution
against it for the suture: If sin be essential to the nature of man, what
reason has he to be humbled for it? to ask God pardon for it? to make any
scruple of the committing of it?

And thus having briesly performed my promise, and satisfied your request, I
shall rest

Your affectionate friend, and humble servant HENRY JEANES.

Before the receipt of this, Mr T. C. gave an account unto Dr Tailor of what he
remembered in our discourse, and received from him an answer, which he concealed
from me until the delivery of my paper, and then he produced it. This answer
together with my reply thereunto I shall next offer unto thy Consideration.

To his respected Friend Mr. T. C. these, etc.
Mr. C.
I thank you for your letter, and friendly information os Mr Jeanes his
exception; but is he had been as careful to understand as he was forward to
object, and mistake, he had cased you, and me of this little trouble. He
objects that I say, that inclination to sin is no sin, because it is
accidental, not intrinsecall, and essential: and he gives reasons why such a
reason is absurd. To all which I return this sost answer, that he says true,
but nothing to the purpose. For the thing that I was to prove then, was the
precedent word: [that every man is inclined to evil, some more, some less:]
that is, that this inclination to evil is not regular and (...), and (...) not
natural, sor as sor the other clause] it is an effect or condition of nature,
but no sin properly] that was the less principal part of the proposition,
and to it only the first reason (...) (...), viz: [that which is (...) (...)
not a sin.) But if he had considered the (...) I was then (...), he (...) needs
have seen that I was explicating that clause of the Church Article [and is
inclined to evill] which I was to say, was an inclination not natural, not
(...), not (...); but accidental: (...) (...) this thing I pursue, and to this
all the other (...) relate to the end of that section, and none of (...), the
first only excepted, (...) (...) the (...) part of the proposition, which is I
had lest out, and the reasons (...) to it, the sense had been as complete, and
my argument not the worse, and my (...) no (...) (...). And (...) be (...) the
4 last reasons, that is, all (...) the (...) to that (...) of the variety of
our inclination to (...), he will not only (...) (...) (...) reason, but all
the (...). Besides this if Mr Jeanes had so much (...) as he pretends to have
Logic, he would have perceived that sor me to (...), what he says I (...),
had been the perfect destruction of all my (...), and all my (...), sor if I
had said, that nothing could be a sin, but what is (...) and (...) I had
(...) that not only some sin, but all sin had (...) (...). Now my Thesis
being, that no sin, properly such, is natural; it cannot be imagined that I
should mean what (...) dreams of: it had not been to my purpose, either there
or in (...) question. But all the following reasons do so explicate, and sully
manisest the meaning of the second; that I wonder hon Mr Jeanes is he be that
person which he would be thought, could mistake, it, unless he be also that
person he would not be thought: I could say many more things, but this being
the truth of the business, and the real (...) of my discourse, I need add no
more; but one thing I cannot but add to Mr Jeanes, that is, since he instances
in our B. Savior, he must needs allow that (...), taking it for those (...),
which are purely natural, and concreated with us, cannot possibly be a sin:
Because as Mr Jeanes rightly observes, whatsoever is natural to man, was in
Christ, because he (...) all our (...) (...), but he had, not our (...); (...)
our (...) nature has no sin: sor Christ was in all things (...) to us, sin
only excepted, but he took (...) him our nature, and nothing of that was
excepted; (...) our nature of it self is not properly (...): nothing os our
constitution is (...).

Sir, I have given you a saire and (...) (...). I pray let Mr Jeanes have (...)
much conveyed to him, as (...) that part to which he (...): and if he writes
(...) thing against me, let him take notice os this my answer, or else all the
World shall take notice of his impertinent, and uningenious dealing: I pray let
not this letter (...) (...) of your hand, because I have no copy os it, if Mr
Jeanes should be troublesome: But if he be, it will be (...) to acquaint his
neighborhood with my (...), (...) what he says shall go no (...). Sir, I
hope you will (...) this trouble I put you to in reading a long letter to my
readiness to do you service, and as a return os those great kindnesses by
which you have obliged.

London July 4th. 1657. Sir, Your very affectionate friend to love and serve
you (...): TAILOR.
Postscript.
I hope I have spoken clearly enough in the explicating, and untying this knot
in the bulrush; but if it be not extremely plain, for your own satisfaction
make but the second part of the proposition to be a Parenthesis; thus,
beginning at (and it is an effect, etc: unto 2.) and then the thing is
extremely plain, (or there the design was only to say and prove that
although man be (more or less, as it happens) inclined to sin, yet his
nature is never the more criminal for that: for it is besides his nature, it
is accidental to it, not but that it is natural to be inclined to such
objects; but that this should be sinful is but in some cases, and it is
accidental, and it is because those objects were forbidden after our nature
was given to us. Man is naturally inclined to some things, which are not
naturally, but accidentally sinful.



To his Loving friend Mr T. C. these etc.
Sir,
I have received Dr Tailor his letter sent unto you, bearing date July 4th.
What design you had in concealing of it so long from me I cannot guess. But
if you had delivered it before I had sent you my objections, you would have
eased me, and Dr Tailor of some trouble: for I should then have let alone these
objections, and have only proved, that I did him no wrong, in charging him with
the conclusions, against which these objections were directed; to wit, that no
sin is accidental; that all sin is essential, and intrinsicall.

Two things he lays to my charge, want of care to understand him, and
disingenuity.

1. Want of care to understand him. [ If he had been (he says) as careful to
understand as he was forward to object, and mistake, he had eas^d you, and me
of this little trouble.] But if the Dr had been a man of that ingenuity, which
you fame him for, he would have confessed his carelessness in expressing of
himself, and not have charged me with want of care to understand, that to be
his meaning which I could not understand to be his meaning without offering
violence to his words: he propounds two propositions (without any thing, but a
copulative conjunction interposed between them) And unto the last of these
propositions he subjoyneth 6 reasons. Now what rule of Logic obliged me to
carry the 5 last of these reasons backwards, and to place them between the above
mentioned propositions, I readily confess my self to be utterly ignorant, and
shall be very ready to sit down at the Doctor's feet, and to learn any such
rule of him. If the Dr must have such liberty allowed him to make such
unexampled transpositions, he is a very formidable adversary, not to be coped
with by mortal wights, who cannot guess, how he will in an after game sever
these reasons, that he has first joined together.

Logic informs me that secondly signifies a relation of order betwixt it
self and firstly. But now if two reasons be related unto not one, but several
conclusions, I would feign know why one should be the first, and the other the
second reason.

Besides here is a first reason, that has no second reason following it,
relating unto the same conclusion. There goes a story of an Alderman in
Oxford, that upon the reading of some records touching something controverted
betwixt the Town, and University, he brake out into this expression; unless we
can prove King Henry the 8th to be before King Henry the seventh the University
will have the better of us: But if we can make it good, that King Henry the 8th
was before King Henry the 7th, then there is no doubt, but that we shall in
this (...) have a full Conquest over the Scholars. I take this to be a fable:
(...) however give me leave to make application of it unto my present purpose.
All the wrong, that the Dr can pretend, that I have done him, is because I did
not place secondly before firstly, and if he can make it good, that I ought to
have placed secondly before firstly, then I must needs confess I have done him
a great deal of Injury, and shall be ready to ask his pardon; and unless
such proof can be made, he must lay the blame upon the Confusion, and disorder
of his own discourse: But to go on. The Dr tells us, that this clause [ it is
an effect, or condition of nature, but no sin properly, is the less
principal part of the proposition:] both clauses then, according unto him,
make but one proposition; and this is a great failing against that Logic,
which the learned have (...) used; for by that, (...) two clauses are not parts
of one proposition, (...) several, entire, distinct propositions.

But perhaps he may say, that they make one compounded proposition.

Unto this I shall reply, 1. That a compounded (...) consists ever of simple
propositions. Now the last of these (...) (to say nothing of the first) is a
compounded proposition it self, for it is an (...) proposition; and therefore,
though these two clauses may make an (...) of several propositions, yet they
can never concur to the Composition of one.

2. If both clauses make one (...) proposition, then it is a (...) proposition;
because they are knit together by a copulative conjunction; Now a copulative
proposition is not true, unless all parts be true; and (...) it is not proved
to be true, unless all parts be proved to be true: Now the Doctor for the
proof of this pretended copulative proposition jumbleth together 6 reasons
without any note of distinction to direct the (...), (...) which part of the
proposition (as he calls (...)) he should apply the (...) all reasons: and
whether this proof of a copulative (...) be not illog call, I (...) (...) any
man, that knows any thing in Logic.

He informs you, that the first reason is to be (...) unto the latter part of
the proposition (as he calls it) and the 5 other reasons unto the first part of
the proposition. But what precept of (...), or Grammar I have transgressed in
(...) making such a distribution, or application of his reasons, he does not
(...) you.

But the Doctor directs you unto two ways sor the (...) out of his meaning.

The First to leave out the second clause, and the reason relating unto it. Is
I had ((...) he) (...) out the latter part of the proposition, and the reasons
(...) to it, my sense had been as complete, and my argument not the (...), and
my discourse no (...) (...).

But the second clause being lest in, perturbeth, and confounds the sense,
and occasioneth the mistake: and who (I pray) is to be blamed, the Dr for
putting it into the (...), or I for still keeping it in the Analysis of his
words? (...) would be a strange, and unheard of way of analyzing, that a Reader
should loppe off two lines at a time of an author: But it should seem we are
to make such (...) to make your great Dr speak sense, only I would know by
what warrant, and obligation.

A second way, which will make it extremely plain (as he tells you in the
(...)) is to make the second part of the proposition (as he terms it) and the
reason relating unto it to be a (...).

But, 1. that this was not brought in by way of Parenthesis, who is in the
fault?

Again, 2. The Dr has told us, that it is the second part of the same
proposition with the foregoing clause, and if so, then it cannot be inserted as
a (...) betwixt it, and the following proposition.

And besides, 3. If he bring in the words only by way of Parenthesis, I would
(...) know what is to be done with 2ly, in this case he must new figure, and
number his reasons. That which he figureth to be the second reason, must be the
first, and his six reasons will prove to be but five.

The second thing that he charge me with is disingenuity. Besides this (says
he) if Mr Jeanes had so much ingenuity, as he pretends to have (...), he would
have perceived, etc.

1. As what he speaks of my pretending unto Logic, I think unworthy of any
answer, and shall leave it unto the Reader to judge of the wit, and ingenuity
thereof.

2. It is no disingenuous part in me to charge the Dr with a conclusion, that I
prove his words to be guilty of: For as for his meaning, I cannot guess at it,
but by his words, but I believe the unpartiall Reader, will judge it a very
high point of (...) in the Dr, not to acknowledge the incommodious structure of
his words.

But let us hear wherein my disingenuity consists. Is Mr Jeanes (says he) had
so much (...) as he pretends to have Logic, he would have perceived that for
me to mean, what he says I mean, had been the persect destruction of all my
discourse, and all my intention.

If this be all; The Dr has no reason to charge me with want of ingenuity in
this particular; for I do very weil perceive, that for him to mean, what I
say, his words hold forth (for as for any secret, and reserved meaning, I have
nothing to do with) had been the perfect destruction of all his (...), etc.
But I believe the (...) meaning is, that it is an ingenuous part in me to (...)
it possible; or probable for him to assert any thing, that is the perfect
destruction of all his discourse, and all his intention. Now this I utterly
deny. I have no such apprehension of the Doctor's (...); but take him to be a
man as likely to (...) himself, as other mortals.

There is one thing more, that the Dr add's concerning our blessed Savior,
that concupiscence taking it for those desires, which are purely natural, and
concreated is no sin, because it was in Christ.

Unto which I answer that this is nothing unto the purpose; for the
concupiscence in controversy is (...), and never created, or concreated by God.

It is an inclination unto evil; and therefore irregular, and disorderly: it
is that which the Apostle terms, the sin, that dwells in him, Romans 7. 17:
which (...) him do that evil, which he would not, verse: 19: which he hated,
verse: 15. The law of his members warring against the law of his mind, verse: 23:
the body of this death, from which he desired to be delivered, verse: 24: And
(methinks) he should be afraid to ascribe this concupiscence unto Jesus
Christ, who was the Lamb of God without blemish, and without spot, 1 Pet. 1.
19: holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, Heb. 7. 26: And thus I
have according unto the Doctor's desire, taken notice of his answer, and shall
not be so hasly as to write any thing against him, but that I shall stay a
convenient time to hear the uttermost, that he can say; and when our Paper
shall be made public unto all the World, I do not doubt but there will be
more that will accuse him of incogitancy, than me of impertinency. Many
ingenious and learned men, and some, that otherwise admire the Dr, have made
the same construction of his words, that I have, and thought that, he here
forgot himself. I am informed that the Dr in a letter unto you, tells you, that
he desires not to be (...) with my (...) Logic, I hope he reviles not
Logic as trisling, for (...) I know in what herd of writers to rank him, and
should decline him as an (...) adversary, who is an enemy to the very art of
reason.

But it is not Logic it self I believe, but my Logic, that he thus
bespatters: and if it be so, I shall return nothing unto this his censure, but
leave you, and others his admirers to judge of the humility, and (...) thereof.

I have heard that the Dr has printed a very good Grammar, if he will also
publish a Logic, for the better information of such triflers as my self, I
do assure you, that I will very diligently peruse it, and if it be more solid,
weighty, and (...), than those which I have hitherto read, give him many
thanks for it.

As for his last letter, I have not yet had the leisure fully to peruse it, but
by that (...) view which I have taken of it, I find it to be as empty of
reason, (though fuller of passion) as the former: you have given it out that it
is unanswerable; but I shall desire you to have a little patience, and if I do
not give it a satisfying answer, I shall submit unto what penance you will
injoyne me. In great have I rest.

Your affectionate (...), and servant, HENRY JEANES.
Chedzoy August 31. 1657.
Mr C. thought, that the Doctor's letter would supersede all (...) sputation;
but perceiving that I was unsatisfied, and that I intended a replication, he
conveyed my objections unto the Doctor, which begat a very angry letter from
him; unto which he would not vouchsafe so much as a superscription; but I saw
the Contents concerned me, and therefore unto thee I shall present it, together
with my answer thereunto, submitting both unto thy censure, and so shall rest

Devoted to thy spiritual service HENRY JEANES

Sir,
I understand by my very good friend Mr T. C that you are very much troubled at
a passage in my [further explication of original sin] page: 496: The words are
these [that every man is inclined to (...) some more, some less, but all in
some instances, is very true, and it is an effect, or condition of nature; but
no sin properly.] The (...) you conceive is because, one of the (...) I bring
to prove it is, because it is accidental to nature, not intrinsecall and
essential.] (...) this you (...) that I (...) that all sin is intrinsecall
and essential to nature: which indeed is I had said, I had been as very a fool
as you conceive me, and worse; (...) besides the reasons you are pleased to
object, which I am no way by this (...) to (...), I had destroyed my maine
intention, nay, that which I was proving in that (...) place; for my work
there was to prove that no sin is, or can be natural.

Now (...) although I (...) you could easily have understood what I did and
must mean there; yet because you are pleased not to do it; I will point in
out to you. To (...) to evil is an effect or condition of nature; but no sin
properly, (...): of (...); for that is the subject of the Question: whether
inclination to evil be an (...) os nature, (...) (...) (...) principle of
evil; a sin natural and necessary. Now that it is not this; I doc suppose
that reason, which you so misconstrued competent: (...): It is not a natural
or necessary sin, not a sin of our nature, because it is (...) to nature,
not intrins. call, not essential; If it be in our nature, it must be (...)
(...), it (...) be at first, it must be in all persons, that have our (...).
And this is my meaning; and that you may not be troubled at the word essential;
I (...) it not in the (...) physical, but in the moral sense; that which is
not after our nature, but together with it in real being: and I explicate it,
by intrinsecall; I oppose it to accidental; (in this (...)) (...) to
[superinduc'd] in the next, Sir I did give an account to Mr C. in a letter to
him, which I know was sufficient, and (...); for cujus est loqui, ejus est
(...); I told you perfectly what is my meaning, it is very plain by the whole
(...) of that, that it must be my meaning; it is also (...) enough and very
easy in the expression, and therefore I now appeal to your (...), whether you
ought to have made such tragedios with that which common (...) would have made
plain to you, unless you had received a prejudice.

And now (...), to your two (...), be pleased to the subject of the two majors,
to add but this qualification; [naturall] and try if those horrid consequents
will follow which you assixed to your own (...).

But I shall for this once consider the particulars.

1. You charge it with nonsense; but with your favor you prove it most
pitifully, your (...) is, that to say [essentiall] is predicated of (sin) in
either os the two ways, dicendi per se, is such pitiful and prodigious
nonsense, that you (...) it not worthy of any serious resutation: so that this
is your argument [to say that sin is essential is prodigious and pitiful
nonsense; g. it is prodigious and pitiful nonsense] surely a good argument; or
thus, that which is such nonsense that you think' not worthy of resutation, is
certainly nonsense: but to say that sin is essential is such nonsense that
you think not worthy of resute: therefore it is (...). I do not say your
argument is (...), but I am sure it is no argument, (...) a (...) affirmative
be a sufficient proof in your Logic. But to the thing that (...) is
essential, is (...) false to say, but to say so, is not (...). And whereas you
will suppose me to say so, you are uncharitable, and something unreasonable in
it: for I was to prove that inclination to sin, was not a sin of our nature
(as was pretended,) because what was (...), is (...) and essential, as
docibility to man; which because to be (...) to sin is not, g. it is not a
sin, viz: of nature.

In the next place you charge this with blasphemy. If I had (...) or meant what
you pretend; you had reason. But then pray consider how your charge will
return really upon your self. For is it be blasphemy to (...) (...) to be the
Author of sin; then what I derived from (...) is no sin, for that (...)
sin should descend upon me, I demand, who was the Author of that? If you
please you may take time to consider it; but in the interim, if you be pleased
to read a little (...) of mine called Deus justificatus, you shall find my
Question not to be answered by you, if you have any regard to the authority, or
to the reason of Mr Calvin, Dr Twisse, and some other Bigots of your party.
Your second charge of Blespemy, is that my reason does by implication involve
Christ in the guilt of sin; because whatsoever is essential he had. But then
if you remember, that I say not, that sin is essential; and that I bring the
reverse of this very argument against your party and (...) in some of my late
discourses, you have reason to (...) the (...) out of your own bosom, not to
tell me, that I (...). For if inclination to sin be a sin naturally, and
derived from our Parents, I demand whether or no had not Christ all natural
(...)? If he had not, he was not a (...) man. If he had then all natural
desire: are not natural sins, for if you say they be you are the blasphemer by
the consequence of your affirmative; not I: But God sorbid that either of us
should. Your (...) reason also is as pretty. For first; I demand whether a
possibility to sin be not of the nature of man (for that is all I mean by
essential.) If it be not; how came Adam to sin his first sine? if it be; I
ask: whether shall the (...) in the resurrection be raised up with it or no? If
yea, then you (...) God's full glorification of the Saints in the resurrection,
for (...) is certainly a part of their full glorification; If nay, then it is
no blasphemy to say that in the resurrect on the Saints shall be raised up will
out something that is essential to them, or of their nature. But Sir, what
(...) you of mortality? is that (...), or os the nature of man? I suppose you
will not (...) it. But yet I also believe you will confess that though we are
(...) a corruptible (...), yet we shall be (...) an incorruptible; and the
(...) shall put on immortality. Once more, is it natural to be natural? that
will not be denied; but then remember that although to be natural is
essential, that is, of the essence of the body, yet the natural body shall
(...) without it is (...), it is sown a naurall body, it is raised a
spiritual. So that you see if I had said this which you charge upon me, which
is so contrary to my thoughts, and so against my purpose, yet your arguments
could not have overthrowns it. It is good advice, (...). If you had been
pleased to have learned my meaning, before you had published your dislike, I
should have (...) my self obliged to you in a great acknowledgment: now you
have said very much evil of me, though I deserved it not. For suppose I had
not prosperously enough expressed my meaning; yet you who are a man of wit and
parts could easily have (...) my purpose and my design, you could not but know
and consider too, that my great (...) was to say, that sin could not be
natural; that it is so sar from being (...), (...) (...) is not so much as
subjected in our common nature, but in our persons only. (...) beside (...)
Sir, I am a little to complain of you, that when you had two (...) at your
choice to explicate each other, (intrinsecall and (...)) you would take the
(...) and the worst sease, not the easiest and most ready: for you cannot but
know that ((...)) is not always to be taken in the (...) sense os Philosophy
(...) that which is (...) os a nature; but largely and for all sorts of
proprieties, and the universal accidents of (...); as it is essential to man
to laugh, to be capable (...) (...), to be mortal, to (...) a body of contrary
qualities, and consequently by nature corruptible; and in a moral (...) to
(...) metaphysicall significations, and not to be content with (...) and (...),
(...) (...) from an (...) to quarrel, but not from that ingenuity which will be
your and (...) (...) (...).

Although I have not much to do with it, yet because you are so (...) a (...),
and so great an admirer of that, which everyone of your (...) (...) I (...),
(...) desinition of an accident: I care not if I tell you, that the (...) on is
imperfect and (...) it is not convertible with the (...). For even (...) things
(...) be (...) (...), sine interitu subjecti. I instance: to be (...), is
essential (...) a ledy, (...) (...) have succession of duration; but yet in
the resurrection, when bodies shall be spiritual and eternal, those other which
are now Essential predicates shall be taken away, and yet the subject remain,
and be improved to higher and more noble predicates. This I have here set down,
not that I at all value the problem whether it be so or no; but that you may
not think me a Socinian particularly in this Article, or that I think the
bodies in the resurrection shall be specifically distinct from what they are: I
believe them the same bodies, but enobled in their very beings: For to a
specifical and substantial change, is required that there be an introduction of
new forms; but yet the improving of Essential predicates, is no specification
of subjects, but melioration of the first: But the consequent is, that abesse,
and adesse,etc is not an excellent definition of an accident. And yet further,
it follows, That if sin were as essential to a man, as mortality is, or to be
quantitative, yet there is no more need that a man should rise with sin, then
with mortality: But Aristotle's, Philosophy, and Porphyri^s Commentary, are but
all measures in Theology; and you should do well to scour bright the armor in
which you trust, which unless it be prudently conducted, it will (...) a man a
Sophister, rather then a Theologue; but you are wiser. I have only this one
thing to add, That the common discourses of Original sin, make sin to be
natural, necessary and unavoidable; and then may not I use your own words? This
Tenet is chargeable with Libertinism: It is a licentious Doctrine, and opens a
gap to the greatest profaneness: For it takes away all conscience of sin, all
repentance of it for the time past. If sin be natural, necessary, and
unavoidable, as it is to us, if we derive it from Adam, etc. What reason has
he to be humbled for it, and to ask God pardon for it? So that you have done
well against your own Opinion; and if I had not used the argument before, I
should have had reason to thank you for it: Now as it is, you are further to
consider it, not I. Sir, Though I have reason to give you the priority to every
thing else, yet in civility I have far outdone you: You were offended at a
passage, which you might easily, but would not understand: You have urged
arguments against me, which return upon your own head: The Proposition you
charge me withal, I own not in any of your senses, nor (as you set it down) in
any at all; and yet your Arguments do not substantially or rationally confute
it, if I had said so: Besides all this, you have used your pleasure upon me,
you have reviled me, slighted me, scorned me, untempted, unprovoked: you never
seat to me civilly to give you satisfaction in your objections but t^k'd it in
my absence, and to my prejudice; yet I have sent you an answer, I hope
satisfactory, and together with it a long Letter, which in the midst of my many
affairs, and straightened condition, is more then I can again afford: And after
all this, I assure you that I will pray for you, and speak such good things of
you, as I can ^^^de, or hear to be in you, and profess myself, and really be,

Sir, Your affectionate Friend and Servant in our blessed Lord and Savior
Jesus. Jer(...) Tailor.
August 15. 1657. Postscript.
Sir, I received yours late last night, and I have returned you this, early
this (...). that I might in (...) thing be respective of you; but I desire not

To the Reverend and Learned, Dr. (...) Tailor.
SIR.
WHat you mean, by my being very much troubled at a passage in your further
Explication of Original Sin, I know not; Indeed I expressed unto Mr. T. C. my
dislike of it, and charged it with nonsense and Blasphemy: And this charge I
have proved; and now shall briefly vindicate the proof of it, from your Reply
in this my Rejoinder. You tell me, that your work in that very place, is to
prove, That no sin is, or can be natural: Now I cannot find any thing sounding
that way within forty lines of these words; and that it was my duty to look
further for the Coherence of them, I confess, I knew not. Another great mistake
also, it seems I have committed; in that I have not so high thoughts of you, as
to think it impossible, or very unlikely, that you should be so uncautelous as
to drop any contradiction unto your main intention: And this is an error that I
can hardly shake off as yet; but I do assure you, that I shall endeavor to
have as reverend an opinion of you as I possibly can; only, I shall never
exempt you from a (...) of (...): never think that you sit upon a Chair made of
Irish Timber, that cannot endure a venomous Spider to hang his web thereon. I
shall, for that which follows, insert the words of your Letter verbatim, that
the Reader may the better compare them and my answer together.

Dr. Tailor.
Now although I know you could easily have understood what I did, and must
(...) (...); yet, because you are pleased not to do it, I shall point it to
you.

(...).
I wonder why you should think it so easy a matter to understand your meaning,
seeing you, who are the Author, (...) from your self in (...) what it is; for
in your Letter unto Mr. C. you apportion'd this second Reason soley unto the
(...) Clause; That every man is inclined to evil, some more, some less, but
all, (...) some (...)stances is very true: And here in your Letter to me, you
apply it unto the second Clause: It is an effect or condition of nature, but no
sin (...). Suppose I were at a loss, yet you have no reason to blame me, until
you agree with your (...): I have no Spectacles to look into your meaning, but
your words, and that they (...) related only unto one Proposition, as a reason
thereof; and yet related to two Propositions, as a proof of each, was a thing
that I could never (...) (...), (...) cannot yet understand; and herein, I am
afraid, you are as unable to teach me (...) (...) can be, as I am incapable of
learning; but if you can teach any such thing unto me, you shall find me,
though perhaps not an apt, yet a willing and thankful Scholar: But to deal
plainly with you, I am very confident that your words in themselves hold forth
neither of those senses that you propound; and if by (...) of argument you can
prove either of them from your words, you shall have my most (...) and subm
ssive (...) of my mistake, and shall have full leave to prescribe me as public
and shameful a satisfaction, as you can think on; unto which, I do (...) to
conform my (...). But let us hear how you point out your meaning to me.

Dr. Tailor.
Yet because you are (...) (...) to understand what I did, and must mean (...),
I will point it out to you: To be (...) to evil, is an effect or (...) of
nature, but no (...) (...), viz. of nature; (...) that is the subject of the
(...), whether (...) unto evil be an effect of nature, or an (...) principle of
evil; a (...) natural and (...)? Now that it is not this, I do suppose that
reason, which you so (...), competent, (...). it is not a natural, or necessary
(...), not a sin of our nature, because it is (...) to nature, not (...), not
essential.

Jeanes.
To rescue your second reason from that which I charge it with, you are (...)
to make an additional supply unto the Proposition; unto which, you (...) your
second reason is competent. To be (...) to evil, etc. is no sin properly, no
natural and necessary sin, no inherent Principle of evil. Now unto this
addition I shall apply your words that you have (...) (...) and (...) in the
like case; whether it may be allowed you by (...) cense, less then (...), let
(...) judge: Surely, Sir, if the most of your Writings be thus (...), they will
be (...) unto me without a Commentary, and if you must be indulged the liberty
of making such (...), all the (...) in Christendom are no match to dispute with
you.

But to insist a little upon the (...) of this Interpolation.

1. You seem to make equivalent these two (...); (...) to (...), is (...) (...)
principle of evil, (...) to evil, is a sin (...) and (...): But I am utterly
unsatisfied touching this their (...), and shall desire you to clear it up unto
me.

Nay further, I very much question the truth of the first Proposition; this
(...) to evil, is not (...) (...) principle of evil; and shall entreat you to
inform me, whether you deny it to be a (...) of evil, or an (...) principle,
and think it only adherent, (...), or the (...): but I believe you will tell
me of some (...) in your words, that I ought to understand, and supply
something to make out your (...): What it is, I will not adventure to guess at,
but leave it to you to express it your self.

Secondly, The conclusion that is confirmed by your second Reason, is the same
with that which is proved by your first Reason; and that was, that inclination
to evil was no sin, without the additional Epithets of natural and (...) It is
no sin, say you, properly; because, that which is (...), is no sin: and indeed,
the unavoidableness of our (...) to evil, may be a probable argument that it is
no sin, and require an answer; but no competent reason at all to prove it not
to be natural and necessary: But seeing you say, it must be your meaning that
these (...) should be interposed, we will for once (...) it, for Disputation
sake, and see whether we can understand by any means what you would have.

1. You say, your meaning in your conclusion is, that (...) to evil is no sin,
(...). of nature, which I shall consider (...), when I shall come to examine
that (...) of yours, That sin is not so much as (...) in our common nature. 2.
Let us inquire what you mean by (...) and (...).
1. What you mean by natural: There be diverse significations of the word
natural, which are impertinent to our present Discourse, and therefore I shall
omit them. I suppose that you take natural, either for that, which is so
termed, in regard of (...) with our nature; or else in respect of Physical, and
necessary (...) from (...) nature.

If you take it for that, which is so termed, in regard of (...) with our
nature, which is (...) with our nature, derived unto us in the Nativity and
Concept on of our nature, then your second Reason is Tautological, a most
pitiful and (...) begging of the question; for you tell us afterward, that by
essential, you mean that which is not after our nature, but together with it in
real being; and then, there will be no more difference betwixt essential and
natural, in this acception of it, then there is betwixt (...) and gladius, and
so your Argument explained will stand thus.

(...) to evil is not connexed with our nature; because it is not connexed with
our nature: it is not coeval with our nature, derived unto us in the Conception
and Nativity of our nature; because it is after our nature, and not together
with it in real being.

2. If you take natural, in regard of (...) (...) from our (...); then your
Argument is impertinent, and concerns not those whom you oppose; for they deny,
as well as you, that (...) unto evil is natural in such a (...): Let two speak
for all.

First, (...) (...) in his (...), where his determination of the sixteenth
Question, is, (...) ad (...) (...) (...) ex (...) (...) (...).

The second is Dr. Baro in his Metaphysics, page 256. Theologi (...) (...),
(...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...)

But perhaps you may pitch upon some other acception of natural; if you (...),
I (...) (...) you not to chide me, but to certify my mistake by (...) of your
meaning; for I have done my (...) to bolt it out, and must needs (...), that I
cannot (...) at any other signification of natural, which you can here in (...)
place with any (...) pretend unto: But if you can (...) me with any other, when
I know it, I shall be ready to examine it.

But to proceed unto the next (...) necessary: When you said, that an
inclination to evil was not properly a sin, your meaning was (you say) that it
was not a necessary sin.

But then I desire to know how your first Reason will be suited unto this
conclusion, for your first Reason stands thus, because that which is (...), is
not sin; and I would entreat you also to inform us, what is the difference here
(...) necessary and unavoidable; for if there be no difference, I shall (...)
suspect your arguments sick of that infirmity, called (...) (...).

But perhaps we must here make the (...) supply, and understand you thus,
because that which is unavoidable is not a necessary sin; if so, your Argument
reduced unto form, will run thus.

Nothing that is unavoidable can be a necessary sin: But an inclination to evil
is unavoidable: Therefore it is not a necessary sin.

Unto your (...) I say, that though unavoidableness, in one sense, may carry a
(...) unto sin, yet not to necessary; it may prove a thing not to be a sin, but
it makes (...) against its being necessary; for that which is (...), may be,
and is necessary; it is probable therefore, that necessary was never in your
(...) thoughts, but put in, to secure your second Reason from (...) Objections
against it.

However, yet I shall here propound and apply a (...) of necessary, usual
among your Antagonists: Dr. (...): Reynolds 3 Treatises, page: 209.
A thing, say they, may be said to be necessary, in regard of either (...) and
created, or (...) and contracted (...).

If you speak of that, which is necessary with that necessity, which is
primitive and created, then indeed I grant your conclusion true, and your
second reason competent unto it: Inclination unto evil is not a necessary sin,
in regard of a Primitive and Created necessity.

But now this were utterly besides the main of your intention, for here you
would sight with nothing but your own shadow, because your adversaries do not
avouch such a necessity in our inclination to evil, but desie and abhor it more
then your self; and you cannot (...) any such thing unto them, unless you (...)
calumniate them.

If you speak of that which is necessary, with a consequent and contracted
necessity; then your conclusion is false, and your second reason no
confirmation thereof; if it be put into form, it will make up two Syllogisms.

The first Syllogism.
Nothing that is accidental, can be a sin necessary, with a consequent and
contracted necessity.

But our inclination to evil is accidental.

Therefore it is not a necessary sin in respect of a consequent and contracted
necessity.

The second Syllogism.
Every thing that is necessary in respect of a consequent and contracted
necessity, is intrinsecal and essential.

But (...) to evil is not intrinsecal and essential.

Therefore it is not necessary, in regard of a consequent and contracted
necessity.

The major in both Syllogisms is evidently false, as will appear, when you
attempt the proof of them: and I am very (...), you never will own them, if you
can any other way shift off my objections.

In the next place, we have a strange Paradox of yours, which I understand not,
I shall propound it, and briefly consider it.



Dr. Tailor.
Is it (...) in our nature, it must be naturally inseparable, it must be at
first, it must be is all (...) that have our nature.

Jeanes.
I shall not (...) charge this Proposition with falsehood, until I know how you
(...) it, and yet I will tell you what reason I have to suspect it to be very
false; diverse accidents are in our nature, properly and strictly inherent in
our nature, which yet are naturally separable from our nature, which were not
at (...), which are not now in all persons that have our nature: I might
instance in several acquired habits, and (...) acts of the rational soul, which
are neither adequate unto, nor coeval with, nor naturally inseparable from it.

But I look for some strange Ellipsis; a Rhetorical Scheme it seems you are
much delighted with; but if you use it (...) often, it will prove rather a
Weed, then a Flower in your Rhetoric; you expect, it seems, I should pay such
reverence unto your Writings, as great Critics do unto the Ancients, in whose
words, when they cannot make sense, they suppose some Chasma to (...) up, with
which they torture (...) (...); but I have something else to do, then to
trouble my self with Divinations at your meaning: when you vouchsafe to
acquaint us what it is, I shall then examine it.

But having seen how ill you have sped in new shaping your conclusion, let us
(...) next whether your success be better in the qualification of your second
reason (...) (...).

Dr. Tailor.
And this is my meaning, and that you may not be troubled at the word
Essential; I mean it not in the strict Physical, but (...) the moral sense,
that which is not after our nature, but together with it in real being, and
explicate it by (...); and I oppose it to accidental in this reason, and to
(...) in the next.

Jeanes.
But first, pray who could tell that you thus meant it, until you now tell me:
Is this a usual and received sense of the word? and if it be, direct me unto
those moral Philosophers and Divines, that thus take it; if it be not, my
ignorance of it is (...) negationis, not (...) dispositionis, not privative and
blameable: (...) (...) se positum slat pro (...) Analogato; and therefore I
appeal unto your own ingenuity, whether I have injured you, by supposing that
you took Essential in the accustomed accept on thereof.

2. I shall beseech you to set down the difference that you make betwixt
natural in your conclusion, and essential in your second reason for it; and
when you have done this, I am very confident to make it appear, that your
Argument is either a mere tautology, or an utter impertinency; but of this
before.

Next you refer me unto your former Letter unto Mr. C.

Dr. Tailor.
Sir, I did give an account unto Mr. C. in a Letter to him, which I know was
sufficient, and (...).

Jeanes.
The vanity of this brag you will soon acknowledge, when you shall compare that
Letter with this unto me; for in this you apply the second reason unto the
latter as a congruent proof; it it is an effect, or condition of nature, but no
sin (...): And this you point out to be your meaning, and say, That I could
easily have understood it: But in your Letter to Mr. C. you aver, that this
second reason is appliable only unto the first clause; That every man is (...)
to evil, some more, some less, etc. and not at all unto the second; nay, that
it is not appliable unto it, without a mistake of not only the second, but the
four other reasons also; and of this too, you say that it must be your meaning,
and that it is clear enough, and easy in the (...); and you wonder that Mr
Jeanes, if he be the man, that he would be thought could mistake it: Here you
propound inconsistent and contrary meanings, and it seems you intend to tie me
unto such hard meat, as that I must find out each to be your (...); but this
is a task, that my understanding cannot perform, and therefore I (...) beg
assistance from the (...) and learning of yours: and until you afford this, I
shall offer unto your consideration this common rule in (...), That contrary
(...) cannot be both true, (...) one of them must needs be false: But these
(...) (...), this second (...) is referred unto the second clause, as a
competent proof, and this second reason is not referred unto the second clause,
are contrary propositions; the opposition betwixt singular propositions, being,
as (...) well shows, de prop: cap. 11. number. 18. most aptly reducible unto
contrariety; an i yet both these propositions are yours, the first in this
letter, the latter in your former letter, and therefore one of them must needs
be false; you are not then so much (...), extra (...) (...), out of Gunshot,
but that my poor (...) Logic is able to reach you: if you should deny the
matter of Fact, that both these propositions are yours, your letters will
convince you of untruth, and I shall need no more then to transcribe your own
words: The first Proposition you have in these words of this Letter, To be
inclined to evil, is an effect, or condition of nature, but no sin properly,
viz. of nature, etc. a sin natural and necessary; now that it is not this, I do
suppose that reason, which you so misconstrued, is competent, etc. The second,
in several passages of your former Letter; as for the other clause, it is an
effect, or condition of nature, but no sin properly, that was the less
principal part of the Proposition, and to it only the first reason was
apportioned; and again afterward, none of the other reasons, the first only
excepted, relate to the latter part of the Proposition: But let us hear your
reason for the sufficiency of your Letter unto Mr. C.

Dr. Tailor.
For cujus est loqui, ejus est interpretari.

Jeanes.
I shall willingly grant you all fair liberty of interpreting your self, so you
do it logically and rationally; but that which you expect, is rather a
licentiousness, then a true liberty of interpretation.

First, You would have a license of (...), to carry your words where you
please; you would have the second reason placed betwixt the two Propositions,
and before the first Reason; thus in your Letter to Mr. C.

(...), You usurp the license of interposition, to put in what you please; as
when in this Letter you add the Epithets of natural and necessary to sin.

And thirdly, You take up a strange license in exposition of your Terms; for if
you cannot justify what you say, if such a term in your words be taken in the
common and usual sense: Then you impose upon me an unusual, that I say not a
new and unheard of signification thereof. Thus you deal with the word Essential.

And lastly, You assume a license of contradiction, to contradict your self, to
say and unsay; one while to make this your meaning, and another time to make
that which is contrary your meaning; and you think that I am obliged to take
these contrary meanings to be both your meanings.

Surely Sir, if you can get a Patent for these four Licenses, you will, for
matter of Disputation, be shot-free and invulnerable; your Opponents may (...)
their caps at you, but not an Argument of theirs can touch you.

Dr. Tailor.
I told you perfectly what is my meaning, it is very (...) by the whole design
of that, that it must be my meaning, it is also clear enough, and very plain,
and very (...) (...) the expression; and therefore I now appeal to your (...),
whether you ought to have made such Tragedies with that, which common sense
would have made plain unto you, unless you had received a prejudice.

Jeanes.
As for this triumphant appeal which you make in the close here to my
ingenuity, I need say nothing, but refer unto the premises; only I cannot but
(...) one Advertisement unto your Disciples, that you sometimes triumph when
you have not conquered.

Dr. Tailor.
And now Sir, to your two Syllogisins, be pleased to the subject of the two
Majors, add but this qualification [ natural] and try if (...) horrid (...)
will follow, which you affixed to your own (...).

Jeanes.
I have already considered with how little sobriety you have added this
Qualification of natural, and, I believe, the impartial Reader will conclude
with me, that you have foisted it in upon second thoughts, only to avoid those
horrid (...), unto which your words in themselves are liable.

Dr. Tailor.
But I shall for this once consider the particulars. 1. You charge it with
(...) sease; but with your (...) you prove it most pitisully: Your reason is,
that to say [(...)] is predicated of [sin] in either of the two ways dicendi
per se, is such (...) and (...) nonsense, that you think it not worthy of any
serious (...): So that this is your Argument, To say that sin is Essential, is
prodigious and pitiful nonsense, therefore it is prodigious and pitiful
nonsense.

Surely a good (...); or thus, that which is such nonsense that you think not
worthy of refutation, is certainly nonsense: But to say that sin is Essential,
is such nonsense, that you think not worthy of refutation, therefore it is
nonsense. I do not say your Argument is nonsense, but I am sure it is no
Argument, unless a bold (...) be a (...) proof in your Logic. But to the
(...), That sin is Essential, is indeed (...) to say, but to say so is not
nonsense. And whereas you will suppose me to say so, (...) (...) uncharitable,
and something unreasonable in it; for I was to prove, That inclination to sin
was not a sin of our nature (as was pretended) because what was natural is
(...) (...) essential, as (...) to a man: which because to be (...) to sin is
not, (...) it is not a sin, viz, of nature.

Jeanes.
First, Here is a gross and (...) falsification of my (...), and that without
any advantage to your cause: Your reason is, say you, That to say Essential is
predicated of sin in either of the two ways, (...) (...) se, is such pitiful
and prodigious nonsense, that (...) think it not worthy of any serious
refutation: Whether these words be justifiable, or no, I need not inquire; for
there are no such words in my Paper, neither can you, with all your wit and
learning, infer any such matter therefrom.

Secondly, To make (...) for your followers, you (...)-(...) my Argument; and
first, clap it into a single Enthymeme, and then into one (...), both of your
own (...); in both which you leave out two mediums, that are in my Argument,
which reduced unto form, will make up two (...): To convince you of (...)
unfair, injurious, and (...)-ingenuous dealing, I shall insert my words at
large. To say (as the Doctor does by consequence) that sin is essential to the
nature of man, is an assertion guilty of nonsense; a thing may be said to be
essential to another, a priori, and then it is predicated of it in primo modo
dicendi per se; (...) else a (...), and then it is predicated of it in secundo
modo dicendi per se. And to say that sin is either of these ways essential to
(...) nature of man, is (...) pitisul and prodigious nonsense, as that I cannot
think (...) worthy of (...) serious resutation.

The learned Reader will soon perceive how (...) alliance your Enthymeme and
Syllog (...) have with my Argument; and to him I appeal, to judge of (...)
unworthy and unscholarly injury that you have herein done me; but yet, for the
(...) stopping of your mouth, I shall Analyze this my Argument. My conclusion
(...), that to say (as you do by consequence) that sin is essential unto the
nature of man, is an assertion guilty of nonsense; this I prove from a
distribution of essential; whatsoever is essential is such, either a priori, or
a (...).

But to say that sin is essential, either a priori, or a posteriori, is
nonsense.

Therefore to say that sin is essential to man, is nonsense.

(...) Syllogism is grounded upon a known and received Maxim [ Negatis (...)
(...) subjectis (...) (...) de aliquo subjecto (...) ipsum (...) universale,
(...) cunctis membris (...), negatur ipsum divisum]

The major I presumed none would deny, and as for the minor, that I proved from
a description of both ways of being essential.

That which is essential to a thing, a priori, is predicated of it in primo
modo dicendi per se; that which is essential to a thing, a posteriori, is
predicated of it in secundo modo dicendi per se.

Now to say that sin is predicated of man, in either primo, or (...) modo
dicendi (...) se, is nonsense: Therefore to say that sin is essential to man,
either a priori, or a posteriori, is nonsense.

The major I thought undeniable, and as for the minor, here indeed I stopped
too in the proof thereof, as thinking all further proof of it needless; because
I took it, and still do take it to be, propositio per se nota, which needs no
proof, but a bare explication of its terms; propositio per se nota dicitur;
quae non est nota per (...), as Lychetus; quae suis tantum terminis
cognoscibilis, as Collegium (...) gather out of Aristotle; quae tales terminos
habet, (...) ii (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) notitiam totius propositionis
fine addito; omnis propositio (...) est per se (...), ad (...) (...) (...)
(...) non (...) aliquod medium, sed solum (...) (...) contentus est, so Scheibl
r.

Now, for the terms of the minor (...): I presumed, that all explication of
them was needless unto a Scholar of so great a repute as Dr. Tailor: And
therefore, without more ado, I inferred, that to say that sin is (...) of
these ways essential, either a priori, or a posteriori, is such (...) and
prodigious nonsense, as that I could not think it worthy of any serious
refutation. And now Sir, I shall entreat you to review my Argument, being thus
truly Analyzed, and I shall appeal unto (...) conscience, when you are next
upon your knees before God, whether you have not deeply wronged me, to
represent my Argument thus defectively (that I say not (...)) on purpose, I am
afraid, to (...) it and me ridiculous. Suppose any (...) should be so absurd,
as to say, That a Stone is animal; and I to refute (...) should thus argue,
Omne animal est (...) (...), who is endued with reason, as well as sense; or
Brutum, which is endued with sense, but not with reason; but to say that a
stone is either homo, or brutum, is such (...) and (...) (...), as that I
cannot think it (...) of any serious refutation. Now he that shall say (...) is
no Argument, but only a bold affirmative, will go a degree beyond (...); for
(...) plain, that here are couched and employed two (...). First, a distribution
of animal in hominem and brutum: Next, a description of each member of the
(...), and my Argument is exactly paralelled unto (...). But Sir, though I
thought, that, before you, I might have spared my labor to prove that (...)
nonsense, to say that sin is essential unto man, either a priori, or a
posteriori; that its predicated of man, either in primo, or secundo modo
dicendi per se; yet, because you (...) to blame mine omission of such proof, I
shall now give you herein, I hope, sufficient (...).

First, To say that that which is (...), is positive, is nonsense: Put to say
that (...) is essential unto man, either a priori, or a (...), is to say, that
(...) which is privative is positive (for the essentials of man are positive,
and the sormality of sin is a privation.)

Therefore to say that sin is (...) unto man, either a (...), or a posteriori,
(...) nonsense.

Secondly, To say that that which is predicated of man (...) ac (...), is (...)
of man in primo, or secundo modo dicendi per se, is (...) ((...) (...) per se
and per accidens, are opposite ways of predication.)

But to say that sin is predicated of man in primo, or secundo modo (...) per
se, is to say, That that which is predicated of man per accidens, is predicated
of man per se (sor that sin is predicated of man, per (...), will be questioned
by none, who know what primus modus dicendi per accidens is)

Therefore to say that sin is predicated of man in primo, or (...) (...) (...)
per se, is nonsense.

Thirdly, To say that that which is predicated contingently of man, is
predicated (...) of him, is nonsense.

But to say that sin is predicated of man in primo, or secundo modo (...) per
se, is to say, That that which is predicated of man (...), is predicated of
(...) necessarily, (for sin is predicated of man contingently, because man and
sin cohere (...); man might not have been a sinner, and when he shall not be a
sinner, he will still be a man; and then (...), per se est gradus necessitatis.

Therefore to say that sin is predicated of man in (...), or secundo modo
dicendi per (...), is nonsense.

If these arguments satisfy you not, you may command more of me when you
please, as also any further enlargement of these.

Yea but you say, that sin is essential is (...) to say, but to say so is
not nonsense.

To this I answer, that however it may be (...) in Grammar, yet it is nonsense
in Logic; because it is a (...); for in (...) every contradiction not only
express, but that also (...) (...) (...) and employed is nonsense, a (...), as
we usually speak: thus it is nonsense to say that (...) (...) (...); that a
spirit is corporeal; that a body is (...), without quantity or extension; that
an (...) subsists; or that a substance properly inhereth.

Now my three arguments above irrefragably prove that, to say that sin is
(...) to man is a contradiction; for it is in effect as much as to say, that
that which is privative is positive; that that which is predicated of man per
accidens, is predicated of him per se; that that which is predicated of man
(...), is predicated of man necessarily; and these are gross and palpable
contradictions; and therefore not only false, but most pitiful and (...)
nonsense.

You accuse me of uncharitableness, and unreasonablenesse, in supposing that
you say that sin is essential unto man; but from this accusation I have
(...) vindicated my self by beating you from all your miserable shifts; And
unto what I have said herein, I shall refer both your self and the Reader.

Dr Tailor.
In the next place you charge me this with blasphemy: if I (...) said or meant
what you (...), you had reason; but then I pray consider how your charge will
(...) really (...) your self; for if it be (...) to (...) God to be the Author
of sin, (...) what I derived from Adam is no sin; for that Adam's sin
should (...) upon me, I demand who was the Author of that? If you please you
may take time to consider it; but in the interim if you be pleased to (...) a
(...) discourse of (...); called Deus justificatus, you shall find my question
not to be answered by you; if you (...) any regard to the authority or to the
reason of Mr Calvin, Dr Twisse, and some other of the (...) of your party.

Jeanes.
1. Here you tempt me to a digression; and you may with as good reason call
upon me to answer all the reproaches that Bellarmine in this particular, (...)
upon the Protestant Churches, and some of the most eminent members thereof, as
propound this question unto me.

2. However yet I briefly answer to it, that Adam was the author of the descent
of his sin upon me, not God; for to be the Author of sin is to be a
desicient, culpable cause thereof; and it is impossible that God should be
defective in a culpable manner; and that our doctrine of original sin makes
him to be such, you may boldly affirm, but can never prove.

3. Bishop (...) in the doctrine of (...) sin is one of our party; and he
speaks that which will abundantly (...) your demands, in his animadversions
upon Hord page 323. 224. It was not (says he) God's absolute decree of (...),
but Adam's voluntary act of rebellion, which brought sin, and the guilt of
sin upon himself, and all his posterity, God having justly (...) that Adam's
children should participate with him (...) his state of (...), did as justly
(...) that they should also participate in the state of sin.

If this Author deny the propagation of (...) from Adam, he must acknowledge
(...) a (...), etc. His whole discourse concerning original sin and the
propagating (...) unto all mankind is (...), in that he (...) (...), that the
divine (...) must needs be (...) or causative of all the (...) (...); whereas
if the events be actions sinful, God's decrees are (...), and ordinative, not
(...) of causing, much, esse necessitating such evil (...), as has been often
told him.

4. I have seen your little (...) called (...) justisicatus; and must say of
it as Florus did of the Ligurians: lib. 2. cap. 3. Major (...) labor (...)
(...) (...) vincere; The Rhetoric of it is so rank, as that it will be a very
hard matter to find out the Logic and reason that is in it.

If you please to put your arguments into form, you then may command me to
consider them; but otherwise, I shall be very loath to adventure upon any thing
of yours; for I find by this present debate about two or three lines, that I
shall not without great difficulty search out what is your meaning.

5. I wonder why you say, that by this discourse I shall find your question not
to be answered by me; why (pray Sr) could I answer it before you propounded it?
but your meaning is, I suppose, that I shall find, that your question cannot be
answr'd by me: but the event will (...) that.

6. That which you mean in Mr Calvin, and Dr Twisse, are I (...) those places
which you quote, page 32: of that your (...); and then unto the place in Calvin
you have an answer in Dr Twisse ( (...): gra: lib. 2. dig: 2. cap. 3. page 42.)
where he cleares it from the (...) of (...): And then for the place in Dr
Twisse you may gather an answer from that he says unto Mr Hord, ( (...). 149.
150.) who makes the like objections against him from another place.

7. You are the unmeerest man in the world to (...) me with the (...) of my
party; sor the rigid Zelots of your party, in your doctrine of original sin,
are such whom you may be ashamed to name. Indeed in (...) point there are very
few of your party, save the Pelagians of old, and now the worthy (...) of the
Racovian den, and their followers; unto whom the best and the most learned of
Protestants will hardly vouchsafe the name of Christians. The ArchBishop of
Armagh (...) them, in a sermon of (...) (that I heard) a company of (...)
Turks; and indeed Turks, and (...) can hardly be greater enemies unto the
divine person, and nature of Christ, unto his offices, and unto his great and
glorious work of redemption, and satisfaction, than these wretched miscreants
are.

Dr Tailor.
Your second charge of blaspemy is, that my reason does by implication involve
Christ in the guilt of sin; because whatsoever is essential he had; but
(...), If you remember that I say not, that sin is (...); and that I bring
the reverse of this very argument against your party and opinion in some of my
late discourses, you have reason to shake the fire out of your own (...), not
to tell me, that I burn; for is inclination to (...) be a (...) naturally and
derived from our Parents; I (...) whether or no (...) not Christ all natural
desires? if he had not, he was not a (...) man; If he had (...) all (...) (...)
are not natural (...); sor is you say they be, you are the (...) by the
consequence of your (...), not I; but God sorbid that (...) of us should.

(...).
First, here is no (...) of my argument; for none of my party or opinion hold,
that inclination unto (...) is essential unto man: Flaccius (...) (...), that
(...) sin was the (...), or substance of the soul; but I never heard that
(...) sollowers were considerable; he has (I am sure) both Papists and
Protestants; (...), and Lutherans for (...) opponents: but, perhaps you
confound natural with (...), and make them all one; if you do, your reason
will be (...), but (...) (...).

2. I believe, you here play with the (...) of the word natural, a thing
(though it may be tolerated in a Sophister,) altogether unworthy of a (...).

Inclination to (...) may be said to be natural, either (...), or (...).

That inclination to (...) is natural (...) (that it flows, and (...)
Physically, and necessarily from our nature,) I slatly deny: and if you can
direct me unto any place in your books, where you prove it to be natural in
this sense, I shall take it into (...). Indeed to say, that it is in this sense
natural, is to throw a reproach upon God the Author of nature.

But it is natural (...); together with our nature derived unto us from our
first Parents; and yet not in Christ, who had not his nature from Adam in an
ordinary way of Generation, but was miraculously conceived by the holy Ghost,
and (...) in the womb of the (...) Mary.

This inclination unto evil is a (...) blemish of (...) nature; because it is
a cause of sin, and qualis causa (...) est effectus. A good tree, says our
Savior, cannot bring forth evil fruit, Matthew. 7. 18. This inclination to
evil brings forth much (...) fruit, and therefore it cannot be good; and
consequently it is bad, and sinful; and therefore could not be in Christ; (who
even as man) was the most holy one of God. Indeed if Christ had wanted any
propriety of man's nature, he had not then been a perfect man, but, that
inclination to evil is a propriety of our nature, sc: proprium 4 to modo you
are never able to make good.

But, Sir, in good earnest, do you think that Christ was inclined unto evil?
if you do not, your (...) of Christ is impertinent; if you do, I shall
conclude your opinion to be blasphemous; and unto it shall oppose this
following argument.

He in whom dwelled an all-fullnesse of the Godhead bodily; he in whom dwelled
an all-fullnesse of habitual grace; he who enjoyed the (...) vision, was not,
could not be inclined unto evil.

But, in Christ dwelled an all-(...) of the Godhead (...); in him also dwelled
an all-(...) of habitual, and sanctifying grace; he enjoyed the (...) vision

Therefore he was not, could not be inclined unto evil.

The Minor will not be denied by any Orthodox Divine, and we may say the same
of the Major, for, he that shall think that the grace of personal union, the
(...) of habitual grace, and the beatificall vision are not sufficient to
exclude from Christ all inclination untoevil will render both (...) learning and
religion too suspected.

But, to put the matter out of doubt, take this following argument for
confirmation of the Major: there could not be the least inclination unto evil
in that person, in whom there was an utter averseness from evil in (...)
(...); (for of contraries, that which is in a (...) degree is not consistent
with the other in the highest and most intense degree) but, in that person, in
whom there was an (...) of the Godhead, on all-fullnesse of habitual grace,
and the beatificall vision, there was an utter averseness from evil, and that
in (...) (...); and therefore impossible that there should be in him an
inclination to evil in the least degree.

The Papists extenuate the malignancy of concupiscence as much as may be,
affirming that in the regenerate it is no sin, and that it had been (...)
Adam if he had been created in his pure naturalls; yet, they think not so well
of it, as to ascribe it unto Christ.

Indeed (...) is accused for speaking somewhat suspiciously this way; but he is
contradicted by the generality of the Schoolmen; (...) in 3 am (...) Thom:
disp. 34. (...). 2. (...). Valentia. Tom. 4. did. 1 (...). (...). 3.
who hold that (...) (...), concupiscence was neither (...) primo, nor (...) in
Christ.

1. Not in actu primo, and for this they allege three reasons.

1. The absolute perfection of his virtues, and all-fullnesse of grace. 2. The
perpetual vigilance, and advertency of (...) reason. 3. The government of his
humane nature, and actions, by his divine and infinite person.
2. Not in actu secundo, because in him, the very first motions unto sin
would have been voluntary, and consequently sinful.

Unto this purpose (...), ( (...): (...): Scholast: Tom: 5. cap. 12. (...): 5.
page: 200.) observes; that the first motions of concupiscence may be said to be
voluntary two manner of ways.

1. Antecedently; when one willingly admits them when he may avoid them. 2.
Consequently; when one yields consent unto them after they are crept in, in the
former way or manner they had been voluntary in Christ; because Christ could
have avoided them, by reason of the government of the person of the word; if he
had not therefore avoided them, but willingly admitted them, they had in him
been blameworthy.
Dr Tailor.
(...) third reason also is as pretty; for, first; I demand whether a
possibility to sin be not of the nature of man; (sor that is all I mean by
essential) if it be not; how came Adam to sin his first sin? if it be, I
ask whether shall the Saints in the resurrection be raised up with it or no?
If yea; then you blaspheme God's full glorification of the Saints in the
resurrection; for impeccability is certainly a part of their full
glorisication. If nay; then it is no blasphemy to say that in the resurrection
the Saints shall be raised up without something that is essential to them, or
to their nature.

Jeanes.
That possibility to sin is essential unto every rational creature I grant;
and hereupon (...), that it is not separated from the Saints in (...) full
(...); (...) shall I (...) your charge of blasphemy herein, having the (...) of
Schoolmen, (both Thomists, and Scotists) and reason too on my side. Indeed,
the Saints of Heaven do constantly, and interruptedly shun, and decline sin;
yet, it is an (...) possible unto their nature, considered in it self; (...)
they are (...) therefrom by their glorisied state and (...): for though sin,
and a fulness of glory (...) inconsistent; yet '(...) no (...), or
repugnancy, that their natures abstractly considered, secluding the
consideration of their glory, should be sinful. Yea, but you say, (...) is
certainly a part of the full glorification of the Saints; and what is
impeccability but an impossibility of sinning; if God then make the Saints
impeccable, he (...) away from them all (...) of sinning.

For answer.

1. There is a twosold impeccability.

1. By nature. 2. By the grace and (...) of God.

(...) by nature takes away all possibility of sinning; but it is received
generally as a rule among the Schoolmen, that a creature cannot be made (...)
per (...), (that is) such a one, as cannot by nature sin. And, if you please,
you may view the proofs thereof in (...) lib: 2. Did: 22. quaest. 1.

(...) by the gift and grace of God does not eradicate the remote power of
sinning; but only keeps it from being actuated; and it is this impeccability
only, that is part of the Saints glorification.

2. A thing may be said to be impossible, sensu diviso, or sensu (...).

In sensu diviso it is not impossible, but possible, for the Saints in Heaven to
sin; for that (considered in themselves without the custodient grace of God
always underpropping them) they are liable unto sin, the lamentable fall of
the Angels of darkness is an evident proof.

But now, (...) composito, it is indeed impossible for glorified Saints to
sin; that is; it is impossible for them to sin considered under this
reduplication, as fully glorified; because fulness of glory and sin cannot
stand together. This answer is in Scotus ( lib. 4. did: 49. quaest: 6.) whose
words I shall insert for the sake of some Readers who may not have him in their
(...):) (...); patet, quod beatus est impeccabilis in sensu compositionis, hoc
est, non (...) (...) (...) beatus, and peccare: sed in sensu divisionis, quod
manens beatus (...) habeat potentiam and possibilitatem ad peccandum potest
(...) dupliciter: vel per aliquid sibi (...), quod excludit potentian talem;
vel per causam (...), quod (...) (...) propinquam ab illo, etc: (...) est causa
intrinseca in (...) Michaelis (...) beati, per quam (...) potentia ad peccandum
pro alias, in sensu divisionis, non est autem causa intrinseca (...) istam
(...) omnino reduci ad actam: sed per causam (...) est (...) (...) illa
propinqua ad peccandum, (...) per (...) (...) (...) (...) (...), (...) semper
(...) actum fruendi, and it a (...) possit (...) suam remolam (...) (...),
(...) (...), (...) ad actum: siquidem (...) causa secunda praeventa a causa
superiori agente ad (...) oppositum potest (...) propinqua exire in aliud
oppositum. Concedo ergo, quod infert, quod (...) beatus, and sit peccabilis in
sensu divisionis loquendo de (...) remota.

Dr. Tailor.
But Sir, (...) think you of Mortality? is that essential, or of the nature of
man? I suppose you will not deny it. But yet I also believe you will (...),
that (...) we are sown a corruptible body, yet we shall be raised an
incorruptible, and the mortal shall (...) on immortality.

Ieanes.
For answer, I shall propound a distinction of mortality, that is very obvious
and ordinary. A thing may be said to be mortal, either respectu (...) (...), or
(...) (...) propinquae.

1. In respect of a remote power of dying, which has in it the remote cause of
dissolution, an elementary matter.

2. In regard of a near power of dying, arising from the actual conflict, and
(...) influence of the Elements, and their contrary qualities.

The latter Mortality is separable, but then it is not essential.

As for the former Mortality, which alone is essential, I think very few doubt,
but that it is also inseparable from the nature of a man, body: for, the (...)
and incorruption of the bodies of the Saints in the resurrection, will not be
by taking away out of their bodies the remote causes of corruption, the
Elements, and their contrary qualities. (for, then their bodies would not be
mixed; and so not for substance the same that they were) but by an hinderance or
prevention of the corruptive influence of the Elements, and their contrary
qualities.

That I am not singular in this, I shall manifest, by transcribing the
Testimonies of some few Schoolmen, who though they differ one from another in
assigning the cause and reason of the impassibility and (...) of glorified
Bodies; yet they all agree with Durand in this, That glorified Bodies are not
impassible, per privationem (...) passivae, sed per aliquod (...) impedimentum
actualis (...) ne siat.

The first shall be of Scotus, ( lib 4. did. 49. quaest. 13.) Dico ergo quod
causa impassibilitatis est voluntas divina non (...) causae secundae
corruptivae, and per hoc, est illud impassibile, (...) potentia remota, sed
propinqua, non a causa (...), sed (...) impediente, (...) (...) est de (...)
supra, etc. (...) (...) de (...) in camino, qui non (...) ad (...) trium
puerorum, non (...) per aliquam (...) (...) pueris, (...) ex carentia potentiae
(...), (...) ex contrario (...) impediente, sed quia Deus ex voluntate sua non
(...) ad (...) (...).

The second is of Durand ( lib. 4. did. 44. quaest. 4.) Restat ergo quod (...)
gloriosa non (...) impassibilia simpliciter, and absolute per privationem
principii (...), cum natura corporum gloriosorum, sit (...) eadem quae prius,
sed (...) (...) (...) aliquid praestans impedimentum actualis passionis ne siat.

Quid autem sit illud, utrum sit aliqua forma (...), an solum virtus divina
(...), duplex (...) opinio: (...) enim quidam quod talis impassibilitas (...)
per aliquam forman inexistentem, etc.

Alius modus est, quod impassibilitas corporum gloriosorum non crit per aliquam
(...). (...), sed solum per virtutem (...) (...) beatis ad (...) and
prohibentem (...) (...) extriaseci inserentis passionem.

This latter way Darand takes himself, and endeavoreth to confirm it by three
Reasons.

The third shall be of Suarez, ( in tertiam part: Thom: (...): 48. p. 531.) nam
licet in corpore glorioso maneat eadem (...), idemque temperamentum ex (...)
(...), inde solum sit, corpus illud in nuda natura sua consideratum, esse
corruptibile, and in beatitudine (...) quasi (...) (...), seu naturalem radicem
(...): (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) intrinsecam esse (...) and impassibile:
quia (...) est alia quadam persectione quae ex se potest impedire, ne illa
maturalis (...) in (...) reducalur.

Dr. Tailor.
Once more, Is it natural to be a natural? that will not be denied: But then
remember, that although to be natural is essential, that is, of the essence of
the body, yet the natural shall arise without its naturality; it is sown a
natural body, it is raised a spiritual.

Jeanes.
1. That that which is natural, is natural, will not be denied, as you say; but
it is propositio identica (...), a most (...) Tautology: and unto what purpose
you propound a question concerning it, I know not.

2. Of things natural unto man, some are natural powers, some are natural
acts: Natural ((...)) powers may be and are essential unto the body; and so
they are inseparable too; our Bodies, when they shall be raised, shall not want
so much as one such natural power: But natural acts are accidental, and in the
resurrection there may be no place for the exercise of, at least, some of them,
viz: Generation, Nutrition, and the like; as touching such things, we shall be
like the angels in Heaven, as it were spiritual.

3. In the Apostle, 1 Cor. 15. 44. it is not (...), a natural body, but (...),
an animal or souly body, that is, actuated and animated by the soul after a
natural way and manner, by the intervention of bodily helps, such as eating,
drinking, sleeping, and the like. And in all congruence of opposition hereunto,
a glorious body is said to be a spiritual, in regard of an immediate
supportance by the spirit, without any corporeal means, and without any use of
the generative and (...) faculties.

Dr. Tailor.
So that you see, is I had said this which you charge upon me, which is
contrary to my thoughts, and so against my purpose, yet your Arguments could
not have (...) it.

Jeanes.
Whether you do not here boast, and triumph without a victory, I am very well
contented to refer it unto the learned Reader.

Since my penning of my exceptions, sent unto Mr. C. I have read the
Metaphysics of Dr. Robert Baro, that learned Scot; and in them I find the
like of these three last Arguments of mine, urged against the error of (...)
(...); that Original Sin is of the substance of man, and essential to him after
the (...), a (...) subalternate unto that which I charge you with; (...) words
are as follows, Prima opinio demnanda and a postris (...) and a (...) de
(...) (...) (...) est absurdissima haeresis (...), (...) peccatum originale
(...) de (...) (...), (...) esse quid (...) (...) (...) (...), contra quam
(...) (...) (...) disputans; varias assert rations: (...) hae (...), Primo, si
(...) (...) pars (...) humanae, (...) Deus (...) author (...), quippe qui (...)

vitam possidebit, saltem quoad (...): Peccatum vero tum (...) erit in
glorificatis, ergo peccatum non est quid (...), sed quid separabile est ab
(...) natura, page 248, 249. These reasons differ so little from mine, as that
you may think perhaps that I have (...) mine from either Bellarmine or (...),
which yet I assure you I did not: The reason why now I recite these Reasons, is
to show, that my arguments are not such (...) and pitiful things, but that
very Learned Men have made use of the like, to (...) (...) proposition
subordinate unto that which I go about to refute.

Dr. Tailor.
It is good advice (...), if you had (...) pleased to have learned my meaning
before you had published your (...), I should have esteemed myself (...) to you
in a great acknowledgement.

Jeanes.
Your advice out of Aristophanes, I like very well; I am not conscious unto my
self that I have toward you transgressed against it: for before I uttered a
syllable of dislike, I used my best endeavor to find out what was your
meaning, and to that purpose, made use of that little Logic and Reason which I
had; and as for that meaning which I affix unto your words, let the Reader
determine, whether I have violated any rule of Logic or Reason, in imputing it
unto you: What I took to be your sense, together with my Objections against it,
I sent unto Mr. C. to be transmitted speedily unto you, exposing all unto the
utmost severity of your (...); and wherein I have here trespassed against
charity or justice, I would fain know.

Besides, my dislike I expressed only in a private place, before very few, in
private discourse, and I have not hitherto published it, from either Press or
Pulpit.

Dr. Tailor.
Now you have said very much evil of me, though I deserve it not.

(...).
This I deny, and slatly challenge you to prove what you aver.

Dr. Tailor.
For suppose I had not prosperously enough expressed my meaning, yet you, who
are a man of wit and parts, could easily have discerned my purpose and my
design: You could not but know, and consider too, that my great design was to
say, That sin could not be natural, that it is so sar from being essential,
that it is not so much as subjected in our common natures, but in our persons
only.

Ieanes.
1. Whether what you say of my wit and parts, be not a (...), I shall not
trouble my self to inquire, but leave it unto your conscience: However, I
suppose, you think your self far superior unto my poor self in wit and parts,
and I also readily acknowledge as much: Now I wonder why you should think that
I should so easily find out what is your meaning, seeing you (whose abilities
so far transcend mine) be so unprosperous, not only in the expression, but in
the after interpretation of your meaning, as that you dissent in a latter
Letter, from your self in a former Letter: How can you reasonably expect that
I, who am not (as one of your Proselites lately said) worthy to be named the
same day with you, (I shall not deny the truth of the (...), nor envy you the
honor thereof) should (as the Proverb is) see further into a Millstone then
you, who are so Eagle and quick sighted.

Secondly, Whereas you say, That sia is not so much as subjected in our common
nature, but in our persons only; I doubt that I understand you not, for to me
it seems very evident, that sin, (so far as a privation can be inherent) is
truly inherent in our natures; for it has all the Requisites of inherence,
that Aristotle lays down ( Categor: cap. 2.)

1. It is in our nature. 2. (...) as a part of our nature. 3. Neither can it
exist severed and apart from our natures: Sin is seated in all individuals of
our nature, whilst living here upon earth, Christ his humanity alone excepted;
and therefore why may not we say, that it is subjected in our common nature?
Seeing those accidents are seated secundarily, and mediately in second
substances, which are primarily and (...) placed in their respective first
substances; (...) secundae substant accidentibus gratia primarum.
Yea, but you will (perhaps) say, it is subjected in our persons only,
therefore not in our nature: But this is a very sorry Objection: For who knows
not the distinction of subjectum, in subjectum quo, and quod; our persons only
are subjectum quod of sin, our natures notwithstanding may be subjectum quo of
it; and we may say the same of other accidents. I find you ( page 494.)
quoting that usual Axiom, actiones (...) suppositorum; but, if you had
considered the limitations that are usually given thereof, you would have
spared the urging of it: actio est suppositi (says Scotus) ultimate denominati
ab action, sed non ut solius denominati ab ipsa: But you may have some deep
meaning, which I fathom not; fair leave may you take to explain your self.

Dr. Tailor.
But besides this, Sir, I am a little to complain of you, that when you had two
words at your choice to explicate each other (intrinsecal, and essential) you
would take the hardest and the worst sense, not the (...) and most ready.

Ieanes.
I have here given you, not only no cause, but not so much as any shadow or
color for complaint.

1. I gave a reason why I insisted on the word essential only, and passed by
the term intrinsecal; because you use intrinsecal as equivalent unto essential,
as is apparent, by your opposing it unto accidental: And have you said, can you
say any thing to the contrary.

2. I would fain know why you should say that essential is a harder word then
intrinsecal; there is, I am sure, that equivocation in the word intrinsecal,
which is not in the word essential; for, that which is accidental, may be
intrinsecal; there being intrinsecal, as well as extrinsecal accidents;
interaum and externum (say Philosophers) sumuntur, vel ratione essentiae, vel
ratione loci, and subjecti.

Dr. Tailor.
For you cannot but know, that essential is not always to be taken in the
strictest sense of Philosophy, for that which is constitutive of a nature; but
largely, and for all sorts of properties, and the universal accidents of
nature.

Ieanes.
The distinction of essential, into that which is such constitutive, as
constituting the essence, or that which is such, (...), as necessarily
resulting from the essence, I very well know: and I grant the proprieties which
are such, quarto modo, which agree omni, (...), semper, are in this latter
sense said to be essential; but that essential is ever taken, as you say, for
all sorts of proprieties, those which are such, (...), secundo, or tertio modo,
is notoriously false, for then essential would be taken for that which is most
accidental; but let us examine your instances.

Dr. Tailor.
As it is essential to a man to laugh, to be capable of learning, to be mortal,
to have a body of contrary qualities, and consequently by nature corruptible.

Ieanes.
If you should affirm in the public Schools of either of the Universities,
that to laugh is essential to man, you would not only be laughed, but (...),
and houted at: the gross and palpable absurdity of this your Assertion, I thus
prove.

Nothing that is accidental to man, can be said to be essential to him.

But to laugh is accidental to man.

Therefore it is not essential.

The Major is apparent from the opposition, that you your self make (...)
essential, and accidental.

The (...) is thus confirmed.

That which is predicated of man contingently, is accidental to man.

But to laugh is predicated of man contingently.

Therefore it is accidental to man.

The Major is plain, because contingency of predication is one of the chief
things which distinguishes (...) praedicabile, from all other predicables, and
it is a (...) character thereof.

And for the (...), that is no less evident: indeed risibile is essential unto
man, and predicated of him in (...) modo dicendi per se; but ridere to laugh is
accidental; because it is predicated of man contingently; for a man and actual
laughter cohere contingently: the lowest degree of necessity in assirmative and
essential predications, is de omni; and de omni (...), requires universitatem
(...) as well as subjecti; that is, propositio (...) debet esse semper vera;
now all men do not always laugh, and therefore laughter is predicated of man
contingently, and consequently accidental to him.

You see, Sir, I am bold to trouble you, ever and anon, with my (...) Logic,
and you can expect no other, as long as you thus trespass against what is most
trivial and obvious in Logic, the very A. B. C. thereof.

2. As for the second instance, you bring capacity of learning: that is taken
for potentia prima, or secunda.

1. If it be taken for potentia prima, then it immediately flows from the
soul, and is essential to man, consequutive, as a proprium 4 to modo of man,
and so it is inseparable from him; but, if taken for potentia secunda, so it
arises from the disposition of the temper and organs of the body, and is not
essential, but accidental, and separable from man.

As for the third, to be mortal, I have already spoken of that sufficiently.

As for the 4th instance; to have a body of contrary qualities is essential
consequutive. and a posteriori unto an essential predicate of man; viz: a mixed
body; and so is essential unto man, and predicated of him in secundo modo
dicendi per se, as a mixed body is predicated of him primo modo dicendi per se.
For, as Scheibler [ de prop: cap: 4. n: 41.] shows, ad praedicationes per se
secundi modi pertinent non solum praedicationes illae, in quibus proprium
praedicatur de subjecto suo primo, veluti corpus est quantum, sed etiam ille
praedicationes in quibus proprium praedicatur de speciebus sui primi (...),
veluti homo est (...): but this has no alliance with laughing, for it agrees
always unto all men.

Dr. Tailor.
And in a moral discourse to call for Metaphysicall significations, and not to
be content with moral and general, may proceed from an itch to quarrel, but
not srom that ingenuity, which will be your and my best ornament.

Ieanes.
It has hitherto been a received (...) amongst all Logicians; that in mixed
questions, the terms of which belong unto several disciplines, we must for
the explication of each term, have recourse unto the discipline, unto which it
(...); and you can say nothing to disprove this rule: whether inclination to
(...) be essential to man? is a mixed question; for inclination to evil or
(...), is a (...) term, and essential, is a (...) term, and therefore, in
taking it in a Metaphysicall sense, I have done nothing, but what Logic, and
reason have prescribed me; and therefore I shall not fear your passionate, and
irrational (...) of me for it. To clear this yet further by instancing in
mixed (...) of the like nature; an formale (...) in genere sit (...) (...) (...)
(...) ali creaturae? an formale (...) originalis sit (...) (...) originalis
(...)? (...) (...) ad malum (...) ex principiis naturae integrae? an
Sacramentum sit (...) (...)? an (...) sint (...) Physicae gratiae?

Now if here you should be pleased to say, that in these questions to call for
Metaphysicall significations, of privatio, (...), (...) respectivum, and (...)
(...), may proceed from an itch to quarrel, but not from that ingenuity, which
(...) be our best ornament, you will bewray but little judgment, and less
(...).

2. If that, which you call essential in a moral, and large (...), do not
either constitute the essence, or necessarily flow therefrom, it will in the
upshot prove to be but accidental; and how then comes it that you oppose it
unto accidental? But you will, perhaps,, tell me, that I must take accidental
in a moral, and large sense, as well as essential; But, Sir, what is there in
your words to guide me unto this sense of accidental? I took accidental for
the concrete of accidens (...), and so I believe have most Scholars that have
read you; and why it should not be thus understood I think you can allege no
reason, but that, you know not otherwise to make any tolerable sense of your
words: your discourse is Polemicall, and if therein you use Philosophical
terms, and I call for a Philosophical signification of the terms, with what
forehead can you accuse me for being (...) some, and disingenuous? if when you
cannot defend what you say, according unto the proper, and usual signification
of the words you use, you must have liberty to (...) unto large and (...)
senses of them, you may say even what you please; for no man will be able to
understand what you say, unless he has a peculiar key unto your writings,

But let us inquire what can be here meant by accidental in a moral and large
sense: essential, you say, in a moral sense, is that which is not after our
nature, but together with it; and, in conformity hereunto, accidental in a
moral sense must be that which is after our nature, and not together with it,
and then I shall desire you to awake, and consider, whether your second reason
be not coincident with your third; for your second reason, as you expound it,
stands thus; (...) to evil is after our nature, and not together with it in
real being: And your third (...) is this, inclination to evil is superinduced
unto nature, and is after it, etc.

Dr Tailor.
Although I have not much to do with it, yet because you are so great a
Logician, and so great an admirer of that which every one of your Pupils
knows, I mean Porphyrics (...) of an accident, I care not if I tell you that
the definition is imperfect and false.

Jeanes.
1. You have ever and (...) an uncivil fling at my poor Logic; But, Sir, let
me be so bold as to tell you, that as my Logic is the object of your contempt,
so that my Pupils cannot find in that (...), which you manifest in these your
papers, matter for either their envy or emulation.

2. Why, pray Sir, do you say, that I am so great an admirer of Porphyrics
definition of an accident? indeed I say, that it is a celebrated definition of
an accident; but thereby I signify only that it is frequently and much used,
commonly known, and in every man's mouth; and this acception of the word is
usual in Cicero, as these instances following evidence: Celebratur omnium
sermon (...) (...): hoc delatum est tum ad vos pontifices, post omnium sermon
celebratum, quemadmodum iste (...) fecit: quod it a esse constanti fama atque
omnium sermon celebratum est: quid porro in graeco sermon tum tritum atque
celebratum est quam, etc.

3. Though you care not to tell me, that Porphyries definition of an accident
is false, and imperfect; yet you should have been careful to have brought
stronger objections against it, than those you have urged, for they contain
such gross, and absurd untruths, as that every one that understands them, will
think you a very incompetent judge of the definitions of Porphyrie and
Aristotle. Indeed how far you are to seek in the nature of accidents,
appears by your talking of accidents constitutive of a substance, in your
discourse of the Real-presence, etc: ( Sect: 11. number: 12: page: 209.) but let us
hear your objections.

Dr Tailor.
It is not convertible with the defiaitum; for even, essential things may be
taken away sine interit u subjecti.

Jeanes.
For an answer unto this, I shall refer you to your self, in your book, but
now mentioned of the Real-presence of Christ in the holy Sacrament. ( Sect. 11.
number. 30. p. 244. and 245.) God can do what he pleases, and he can reverse the
laws of his whole creation, because he can change or annihilate every
creature, or alter the manners and essences; but the question now is, what
laws God has already established, and whether or no essentials can be
changed, the things remaining the same? that is, whether they can be the same,
when they are not the same? he that says God can give to a body all the
essential properties of a spirit, says true, and confesses God's Omnipotency;
but he says also that God can change a body, from being a body to become a
spirit; but if he saves, that remaining a body it can receive, the essentials
of a spirit, he does not confess God's (...), but makes the Article dissicult
to be believed, by making it not to work wisely and possibly: God can do
althings, but are they undone, when they are done? that is, are the things
changed in their essentials and yet remain the same? then how are they
changed, and then what has God done to them?

But to come unto your instances.

Dr. Tailor.
I instance to be quant tative is essential to a body, and to have succession
of duration; but yet in the resurrection when bodies shall be spiritual, and
eternal, those other which are now essential predicates shall be taken away,
and yet the subject remain, and be improved to higher, and more noble
predicates.

Jeanes.
1. As for the 1. of these instances it is without doubt, that to be
quantitative is essential unto a body a posteriori, and consecutive as a
probrium thereof 4 to modo. but.

1. That quantity is separable from a body was never affirmed by any besides
the Patrons of either transubstantiation or consubstantiation. 2. If a body
were without quantity, it would be without extension, and so would exist in an
undivisible point without distinction of parts, and so it would be (...), a
bodilesse body, which is a flat contradiction.
But for refutation of this, I shall refer you to your own self in your
discourse of the Real-presence, etc. ( Sect. 11. 13 page 211.) But I demand,
when we (...) of a body what we mean by it? for in all discourses and
entercourses of (...) by words, we must agree concerning each others meaning:
when we speak of a body, of a substance, of an accident, what does mankind
agree to mean by these words? all the (...) and all the wise men in the world,
when they speak os a body, and separate it from a spirit, they mean, that a
spirit is that which has no material divisible parts Physically that which
has nothing of that which makes a body that is extension and (...) by sines
and superficies. And, (Page 212.) when we speak os a body all the world means
that, which has a finite quantity. Page 219. 220: that which I now insist upon
is, that in a body there cannot be indistinction of parts, but each must
possess his own portion, or place, and if it does not, a body cannot be a
body. Sect. 11. number. 18. Again, ( Page 221. number. 20: ejusd: Sect:) If Christ's
body be in the Sacrament according to the manner of a substance not of a body;
I demand according to the nature of what substance whether of a material or an
immaterial? if according to the nature of a material substance, then it is
commensurate by the dimensions of quantity, which he is now endeavoring to
avoid. If according to the nature of an immateriall substance, (...) it is not
a body, but a spirit, or else the body may have the being of a spirit, whilst
it remains a body, that is, be a body, and not a body at the same time.

Here every material substance, by your opinion is commensurate by the division
of quantity, and therefore no material substance can be without the dimensions
of of quantity; afterward in ( page 241. and. 242. number: 29. ejusd: Sect:) you
bring in a shift of Bellarmines unto which you return a very good answer, both
which I shall transcribe. (...) says that to be coextended to a place is
separable from a magnitude or body, because it is a thing that is extrinsecal
and consequent to the intrinsecal extension of parts, and being later than it,
is by divine power separable: but this is as very a sophism as all the rest;
for if whatever in nature is later than the substance, be (...) from it, than
fire may be without heat, or water without moisture; a man can be without time,
for that also is in nature after his essence, and he may be without a faculty
of will, or understanding, or of affections, or of growing to his state, or
being nourished, and then he will be a strange man, who will neither have the
power of will, or understanding, of desiring, or avoiding, of nourishment or
growth, or any thing, that can distinguish him from a beast, or a tree, or a
stone; for these are all later than the essence, for they are all essential
(...) from it, thus also quantity can be separated from a substantial body if
every thing that is later than the form can be separated from it.

When you wrote this, you thought it a gross absurdity to aver that quantity
could be separated from a substantial body; when you have answered your self,
I shall then take up the Cudgels, and reply unto your answer in the mean while,
I shall consider your argument by which you endeavor to prove quantity
separable from a body.

It stands thus; in the resurrection bodies shall be spiritual; therefore to be
quantitative, which is now an essential predicate, shall be then taken away.

For answer.

1. If the bodies of the Saints shall be raised without quantity, then without
extension, without integral parts, without heads, eyes, arms, legs, feet, and
this would be a very pretty, and proper resurrection; it would indeed be an
invisible resurrection; this is a very strange, and false assertion, contrary
as to the constant tenet of both ancient, and modern Divinity, so also unto
express scripture; In my flesh, says Job, shall I see God, whom I shall see
for my-selfe, and my eyes shall behold, and not another, Job. 19. 26, 27: the
bodies of the Saints shall in the resurrection be conformed unto Christ's
glorious body in his: Philip. 3. 21: and that was a visible and palpable body,
it might be seen and selt, it had flesh and bones, and hands, feet and sides,
Luke 24. 39, 40: John. 20. 27: see Aquin: sup: ad 3 am part. sum: etc: quaest.
80. Art. 1. Tertullian upon these words of the Apostles [ this corruptible
shall put on incorruption] has this gloss, quantitativam and eandem numero
essentiam digito demonstrat, magis enim express loqui non poterat, (...) cutem
suam manibus (...).

2. As for the spirituality of our bodies in the resurrection, that shall not
be destructive of their quantity; for they shall be spiritual, not in regard of
substance; but in respect of either immediate supportance by the spirit, or
else resemblance unto a spirit.

1. In respect of immediate supportance by the spirit without the help of
bodily means, meats, drinks, sleep, medicaments, etc: he that raised up
Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his (...) that
dwells in you, Romans 8. 11: or else

2. (As others conjecture) in regard of resemblance unto a spirit as touching
some particulars in the resurrection; they neither marry, nor are given in
marriage; but are as the Angels of God in Heaven, Matthew. 22. 30.

But that spirituality of the body in `Paul's sense of the word is no
impeachment unto the quantity of it is evident enough from what you say in your
treatise of the Real-presence, etc: for therein you rightly aver, that
Christ's body is now a spiritual body, and yet maintain against the Papists
that it is endued with quantity, and has partem extra partem, one part without
the other answering to the parts of his place.

Your second instance is, to have succession of duration, this is essential to
a body think you; yet in the resurrection, when our bodies shall be eternal, it
shall be taken away.

But here Sir, my poor Pupils, because you are so great a Metaphysitian, care
not much if they tell you, That succession in duration is so far from being
essential to a body, as that it does not at all agree thereunto; and they have
learnt it out of Scheibler, Metap. lib. 1. cap. 16. n. 48. 53. 91, 92, 93, 94,
95, 96, 97, 98, 99, cap. 19. n. 9, 10, 11, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. And (...), disp:
50. Sect. 5. and 7. Metaphysitians no (...) inferior unto your great self.

Out of them they thus argue, whatsoever has a successive duration, has also
a successive essence or being; but now no body has a successive essence or
being, therefore no body has a successive duration.

The Major is evident, because as Suarez and Scheibler well prove, the duration
of a thing is not distinguished from the actual existence thereof, really, but
only ratione ratiocinata.

And then for the Minor, it may be thus confirmed, Whatsoever has a successive
essence or being, has the parts of its essence in fluxu, so that it is partly
past, partly present, and in part to come; but no such thing can be affirmed of
any body, and therefore no body has a successive essence or being.

Or thus, No permanent being has a successive being or essence; but every body
is a permanent being, therefore no body has a successive being or essence.

The Minor, that alone asks proof, may be thus confirmed: Whatsoever has all
the parts of its essence or being together (so that in no moment of time there
is wanting unto it any thing requisite unto its essential integrity) that is a
permanent being; but every body has all the parts of its essence or being
together (so (...) in no moment of time there is wanting unto it any thing
requisite unto its essential integrity.)

Therefore every body is a permanent being.

If you should say, That God only has permanency of being, according to that
of the Psalmist, Psalm. 102. 26, 27. The Heavens shall perish, but thou shall
endure; yea all of them shall wax old, like a garment; as a vesture shall thou
change them, and they shall be changed, but thou art the same.

Unto this they will answer, That you do but triste with the equivocation of
the word permanency, it is (they will say) opposed unto either mutability or
succession; if it be opposed unto mutability and defectibility of being, then
God alone has permanency of being; but if it be opposed unto succession of
being, then every created being, besides motion, has permanency of being; and
this Scheibler has taught them, Met: lib. 1. cap. 19. n. 35. Nullae rei
(inquit) convenit fluxus vel successio partium essentialium praeterquam motui (
(...) loquendo) unde non est tempus successivum, nisi tempus quo durat ipse
motus: nempe sicut essentia motus consistit in successione partium: ita etiam
duratio motus consistit in successione partium, and proinde utrumque est ens
successivum, si tamen a part rei loquamur, tum (...) (...) eas est
successivum, nempe motus, duratio enim motus a part rei cadem est cum essentia
ipsa. If you should say with Bonaventure, and others, That succession of
duration distinguishes the creature from the Creator, and therefore every
creature has succession of duration: They will again (out of the forementioned
Authors) distinguish of a twofold succession, privative and positive.

1. A privative or negative succession, and that is, either betwixt not being,
and being, or betwixt being, and not being; thus when a man is begotten, his
being succeeds his not being, and when he dies, his not being succeeds his
being; and this privative succession does distinguish the creature from the
Creator, and therefore does or may agree to every creature: for even the Angels
had a beginning, and so there was a succession of their being unto their not
being; and they might have an end, by Gods omnipotency, if he had not decreed
otherwise: nay, God could (...) them merely by the withdrawing of his
preservative influence, and so there might have been a succession of their not
being unto their being: this succession is opposed unto an intrinsecal
necessity of existence, or unto an immutable permanency, seu stabilitati
permanentiae, as Suarez phraseth it, Disp: 50 Sect. 5. n. 26. and not unto
(...) of being as such: This succession, if we speak of the power and capacity
of it, is essential to our bodies, and withal, it is inseparable from them; for
even after the resurrection, God could (if he had not determined the contrary)
reduce them unto their first nothing.

A positive succession has for both its extremes a positive being, and this is
again (they will say) either discrete, or continuous.

1. Discrete between beings totally perfect; as the knowledge of one Plant
succeeds the knowledge of another Plant: But this succession does not
constitute a successive being

There is another succession, which they call continuous, and that is not
betwixt total beings, but betwixt parts of the same being; when they do not
exist together, but one after another, in (...) (as they say) and this
succession is proper and peculiar unto motion, though not unto every motion.
Thus far my Pupils.

Dr. Tailor.
This I have here set down, not that I at all value the problem whether it be
so or no, but that you may not think me a Socinian particularly in this
Article, or that I think the bodies in the resurrection shall be specifically
distinct from what they are here; I believe them the same bodies, but enobled
in their very beings, for to a specifical and substantial change, is required,
that there be introduction of new forms.

(...).
1. You will not be thoroughly and sufficiently distinguished from the Socinians
in this Article, if you think the bodies in the resurrection shall be
numerically distinct from what they are here; and therefore I shall entreat you
to tell us in your next, how far you accord with or dissent from them in this
particular.

2. You here say, that to be quantitative, shall be taken away from our bodies
in the resurrection; and the sequel of this is, that bodies in the resurrection
shall be specifically distinct from what they are here; for a quantitative
substance, and a substance without quantity, are specifically distinct; because
the one is material, a body, and the other immaterial, a spirit, and not a body
at all, unless nomine tenns.

Dr. Tailor.
But yet the improving of essential predicates, is no specification of
subjects, but a (...) of the first.

Jeanes.
The ordinary Reader may perhaps think, that there is some great mystery wrapped
up under these hard words; but the plain meaning of them, is (as I suppose)
that the improving of essential predicates, does not make a specifical change
of subjects, but only advance a subject unto a better being. Essential
predicates may be said to be improved three manner of ways. 1. By abolition of
them. 2. By (...) of them. 3. By addition unto them.

The two latter are impertinent to this business in hand; for suppose (though
not grant) that the essential predicates of substances might be improved by
(...) of them, or by addition unto them; yet what will this make to the
separability of essentials from a subject: The improving of essential
predicates, that belongs unto our present purpose, is by abolition of them, and
by substituting new and more noble essentials in their room; and that
essentials may be abolished, and new essentials substituted in their rooms (the
things remaining the same) is a thing you may magisterially and imperiously
dictate, but can never Scholastically prove.

But (perhaps) you will say, that you take essential in a Moral and (...)
(...): But Sir, you must remember, that you are not to take essential here, in
such a latitude, as to include accidental and contingent predicates; for if you
should, Porphyry's definition of Accidens will remain unshaken by what you say:
Would not this be a ridiculous Argument? accidental and contingent predicates
may be taken away, sine subjecti interitu, therefore adesse and abesse sine
subjecti (...), is no excellent definition of an accident; and yet this will be
your very argument, if by essential predicates you mean any thing besides the
four first predicables, unto which all essential predicates are reducible.

Dr. Tailor.
But the consequent is, that abesse and adesse sine subjecti interitu, is not
an excellent definition of an accident.

Jeanes.
The arguments from which you infer this consequent, are overthrown, and
therefore this consequent falls to the ground of it self, without you support
it by some fresh arguments.

Dr. Tailor.
And (...) further, it follows; That if (...) were (...) essential to a man, as
mortality is, or to be (...), yet there is no more need that man should rise
with sin, then with mortality.

Ieanes.
And, pray Sir, why do not you add, and with quantity? Do you begin to startle
at this Proposition? that men shall rise without quantity: But as (...) the
separability of both mortality and quantity from bodies in the resurrection, I
have spoken already so fully, as that I may spare to say any thing anew of it.

Dr. Tailor.
But Aristotle's Philosophy, and Porphyry's Commentary, are but ill measures in
(...), and you should do well to scour bright that armor in which you trust,
which (...) it be prudently conducted, will make a man a Sophister rather than
a (...): but (...) are wiser.

Ieanes.
Aristotle and Porphiry are no contemptible Authors in Philosophy; but who ever
thought them (...) in Philosophy, or their Books measures in Theology?
Philosophy is a very useful Handmaid unto Divinity, and none will decry it,
but such whose sayings and writings cannot endure the test thereof; nothing
that is true in Philosophy, can be false in Divinity; for verum vero non
opponitur, one truth does not, cannot clash with another: As for my Philosophy,
I hope God will preserve me from trusting in it, or in any other arm of flesh:
If you can detect any error therein, I shall be ready to retract it, and be
very thankful to you for your pains; as for the dirt you have hitherto thrown
thereon, it will not stick, but recoileth on your own face.

Dr Tailor.
I have only this one thing to add, That the common Discourses of Original
Sin, makes sin to be natural, necessary, and unavoidable, and then may I not
use your own words, this Tenet is chargeable with Libeatinism, it is a
liceatious Doctrine, and opens a gap to the greatest profaneness, for it takes
away all conscience of sin, all (...) of it for the time past; if sin be
natural, necessary, and unavoidable, as it is to us, if we derive it from Adam,
etc. what reason has he to be humbled for it, and to ask God pardon for it? so
that you have done well against your own opinion; and if I had not used the
argument before, I should have had reason to thank you for it: now as it is,
you are further to consider of it, not I.

Jeanes.
If you understand by natural, that which naturally results from nature, and by
necessary and unavoidable, that which is denominated such from a primitive and
created necessity, that which you say is a foul slander against the common
discourses of Protestants against Original sin: But if you mean by natural that
which is connexed with, and cocval unto our nature, and by necessary and
unavoidable, that which is such in regard of a consequent and contracted
necessity, it will be nothing to the purpose: for you (and you may take in to
boot your good friends of Racovia) are never able to prove, that the assertion
of such a naturality and necessity of Original sin, is any bar to humiliation
or repentance for it, unto Prayer for the pardon of it.

Dr Tailor.
Sir, Though I have reason to give you the priority in every thing else, yet in
civility I have far outdone you.

Ieanes.
First, You have written a Letter to me without a Superscription, and I have
returned one unto you with a Superscription; and this I take, to be of the two,
the greater civility.

If I may believe the echo of the neighborhood, you have written several
Letters unto Mr. T. C. concerning me, that cannot pretend to any great
civility, for they are said to be stuffed with insulting reproaches: unto which
I shall return nothing, but my Prayers for the increase of your charity and
humility.

Dr. Tailor.
You were offended at a passage, which you might easily, but would not
understand; you have urged arguments against me, which return upon your own
head: The Proposition you charge me withal, I own not in any of your (...),
nor (as you set it down) in any at all, and yet your arguments do not
substantially, or rationally confute it, if I had said so.

Ieanes.
Here you sum up your Conquests, but whether you do not reckon without your
Host, let the Reader judge.

Dr. Tailor.
(...) all this, you have used your pleasure upon me; you have reviled me,
slighted me, scorned me, untempted, unprovoked; you never sent to me civilly to
give you satisfaction in your Objections, but talked it my absence, and to my
prejudice.

Ieanes.
Unto all this, a general negative is a sufficient answer, until I know the
Particulars that your Delator has informed you with; but perhaps, you may
think that for such an obscure person as my self, to dare to except against
what you write, is to revile, slight, and scorn you; if you be so impatient of
contradiction, I shall leave it unto your own bosom to judge from what spirit
it proceeds: When you published your Book, you exposed it to every man's censure
that would read it; and will you accuse every man of uncivility that passes
his censure upon any passage in it, in a private discourse with friends? But
Sir, upon Mr. C. his entreaty, I sent him in writing the reasons that I had for
my censure, and these reasons were by my consent to be conveyed to you, and
therefore I sent unto you mediately by another to give satisfaction to my
objections: If you shall say that 'twas uncivil for me not to make my address
immediately unto your self, it is a charge will easily be wiped off; I was, as
I thought, an utter stranger unto you, and Mr. C. professed a greet
acquaintance with, and interest in you, and assured me that my Exceptions
should be received with all possible candor, and promised his diligence and
(...) in conveying of them unto (...) my objections therefore were sent civilly
unto you, though sent by him; but however you are thus (...), the Reader, I
hope, will have a more charitable opinion of my procedure herein, and think,
that you have no reason to make such (...) Out-crys against me for abusive
uncivilities toward you.

Dr. Tailor.
Yet I have sent you an answer, I hope, satisfactory, and together with it a
long Letter, which in the midst of my many affairs and straightened condition, is
more then I can again afford.

Jeanes.
Unto your long Letter I have returned a longer answer; and whether yours or
mine be satisfactory, I am contented to refer it unto the indifferent Reader:
(...) your condition be straightened, I wish it were more plentiful: But my
affairs are, I (...), neither for number nor importance inferior unto yours;
and from them I have borrowed so much time, as to answer you, and shall be
ready to do so again to perform unto you the like office.

Dr Tailor.
And after all this, I assure you that I will pray for you, and speak such good
things of you, as I can find, or hear to be in you; and prosess my self, and
really be, Sir, Your affectionate friend and servant, in our blessed Lord and
Savior Jesus. Jer: Tailor.

Ieanes.
For this your promise I give you hearty thanks, and shall endeavor to make you
as grateful a return as I can, in the like Christian offices of love, and so
shall rest,

In Christ Jesus your humble servant, Henry Jeanes.

POSTSCRIPT.
Dr Tailor.
Sir, I received yours late last night; and I have returned you this early in
the morning, that I might in every thing be respective of you.

Jeanes.
This I easily believe, and am confident, that upon review of your Letter you
will acknowledge, that according to the proverb, you have made more haste then
good speed.

Dr. Tailor.
But I desire not to be troubled with any thing that is not very material, for
I have business of much greater concernment; neither can I draw the saw of
contention with any man about things less pertinent. I expect no answer, I need
none, I desire none, but expect that you will employ your good parts in any
thing, rather (...) in being ingeniosus in alieno libro. Your talents can
better ( if you please) serve God, then by cavilling with or without reason.

Ieanes.
Whether or no the controversy between us be not material, but less pertinent;
whether your Letter be so satisfactory, as that it needs no answer? as also,
whether I cavil without reason (to cavil with reason, is a Catachresis as
harsh as ratione (...), and as hardly justifiable, but by a licentia poctica)
are things in which I refuse you for my Judge, and appeal unto the learned and
unprejudiced Reader.

Secondly, That you neither expect nor desire an answer from me may be very
probable, but that I was obliged to return you one, I have 3 Reasons that
convince me.

First, By my silence, the truth which you have wronged would suffer.

Secondly, your Papers have been with a great deal of diligence published, and
if I should not give them an answer, I should be accessory to the Funeral of my
own good name. And

Thirdly, A friend of yours, when he gave me this your Letter, told me, That I
could not answer it, and that you were, as he thought, infallible: now I
thought it my duty to undeceive him, who having your person in too great an
admiration, greedily swalloweth whatsoever falls from your pen, though never so
(...) and erroneous.

UNIFORMITY IN Humane Doctrinall Ceremonies Ungrounded on 1 Cor. 14. 40. OR, A
REPLY UNTO Dr. HAMMONDS VINDICATION OF HIS Grounds of Uniformity from the 1
Cor. 14. 40.

BY HENRY JEANES, Minister of Gods Word at CHEDZOY.

OXFORD,

Printed by A. Lichfield Printer to the Universitie, for Tho. Robinson, 1660.

Uniformity in Humane Doctrinall Ceremonies ungrounded on 1 Cor. 14. 40.
Dr. HAMMOND.
1 Cor. 14. 40. (...). Decently, and according to appointment.
1. SInce the publishing that Answer to Mr. J. concerning the degrees of
ardency in Christ's Prayer, I am advertised of another passage in that volume,
in which I am concerned, relating to some words of mine in the view of the
Directory, page 19. on the head of Uniformity in Gods Service, and particularly
respecting my rendering of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 14 40. Let all things be done
(...).

2. These indeed I thus rendered [decently and according to order or
appointment] and affirmed the importance of that place to be, that all be done
in the Church according to Custom and appointment, rendering this reason of the
former, because it was employed in (...), decently (custom being the only rule
of decency, etc.) and of the latter, because the words do literally import
this, (...), i. e. according to order or appointment.

3. To the former of these he makes his first exception, thus, [he dares not
affirm that this is the immediate sense of the place, but only that it is
employed; it cannot be denied, but that decency does imply such customs, the
omission of which does necessarily infer indecency; but that the omission of
such ceremonies as ours, does infer indecency, the Doctor and all his party can
never make good: What undecencie can the Doctor prove to be in the
administration of Baptism without the Cross; as also in public Prayers and
Preaching without a Surplice? But of this see farther in (...) in the places
but new quoted: The Doctor may perhaps look upon him as an inconsiderable
adversary. But we shall think his Arguments considerable, until the Doctor, or
some other of his party give a satisfactory answer unto them. In the mean while
let us examine the proof that (...) Doctor brings for this sense: and it is
because custom is the only rule of decency.

This Proposition, though very strange, is (...); and therefore we might as
well reject it, as the Doctor dictates it. But I shall add a consutation of
it, from these follow: ing arguments.

1. If custom be the only rule of decency, then nothing else can be a rule
thereof besides custom; but this is false; for the light and law of Nature, is
also a rule thereof, and that (...). 2. Nothing can be undecent, that is
agreeable unto the only rule of (...) but diverse things are undecent, which
yet can plead custom; and this is so evident, as that I will not so much
undervalue the Doctors judgment, as to endeavor any (...) thereof It is (...)
that the only rule of decency should be undecent; but yet (...) is very
possible that many customs should be (...), and therefore I shall conclude,
that custom is not the (...) rule of (...). 3. Lastly, unto custom, as you
may see in both Aristotle and Aquinas, the frequent usage of a thing is
required. But new there may be decency or handsomnesse in the (...) usage of a
thing; and of this decency custom is not the rule, and therefore it is not the
only rule of decency. 4. The (...) thing here charged on me, is (...), that I
(...) not say what I said not, and this attended with a concession (in a
limited sense) of the truth of what I did say; the (...) is the (...)
unsufficiency of that, in that limited sense, to prove what he (...) I would
have from it, viz. that the omission of our ceremonies (...) (...) indecency:
And the proof of this charge (...), 1. by way of question, founded in two
(...), the Cross in Baptism, and the (...) in public Prayer, and (...): 2.
By reference to Ames, and resolving to think his arguments considerable, till a
satisfactory answer be given them. And his third charge, is my using an
unsufficient proof to prove my interpretation, viz. this, [because custom is
the only rule of decency] which he confutes by three arguments.
These three charges I shall now very (...) examine, and, if I mistake not,
clearly evacuate. The first by assuring him, 1. that I did dare to say, and
indeed said (as I then thought perspicuously) the full of what I meant; but
that it was no way incumbent on me, to say either what I did not mean, or what
Mr. J. or any other should be justly able to charge of want of truth in the
least degree. And 2. if what I said cannot, as he confesses, be denied, to have
truth in it in one sense, I demand why must it be a not daring (which is wont
to signify timidity or cowardice) (...) I (...) it not in another sense,
wherein (...) does not consent to it.

Jeanes.
The not daring of a thing proceeds from, not only timidity, but also from
conscience and shame: When we say of men in controversal writings, that they
dare not affirm such and such errors, we do not reproach them with cowardice,
unless he be a coward that is afraid, or ashamed to deliver an untruth. That
according unto custom is the immediate sense of (...), is a very gross and
evident falsehood; and when I said that you dared not to (...) it, my meaning
plainly was, that your conscience or shame kept you from such an affirmation,
and what wrong I have herein done you I am yet to (...).

If you demand why I say that, you dare not say what you said not?

I answer, I have two reasons for it:

1. In entrance into this dispute, I did, as is usall in Controversies, premise
what I took for uncontroverted on both sides. 1. for your part, I thought you
would not deny, but that the immediate sense of (...) was not according unto
custom; and then, I propounded for my own part what I granted. 2. Though in
Charity I judge, that you dare not say, that according unto custom is the
immediate sense of (...), yet I must needs tell you, that by your opinion it is
incumbent upon you to say as much, and that I thus prove: You (...) that
according to (...) is the importance of (...), that is, the adequate and full
importance of it, for that you should so (...), as to say, that you meant, it
is only the partial, and inadequate importance of it, I will not so much as
imagine: But now, if it be not the express, and immediate sense of the word,
but only (...) (...), as drawn therefrom, as a sequel or (...); by way of
deduction or consequence, it may only be a part or piece of the importance
thereof: to prove then, that it is the full and adequate importance of the word,
you must make good, that it is the immediate sense of it.
Dr. Hammond. sect. 6.
To make short, and prevent all (...) of his, or any man's farther mistaking my
words, I shall (...) to tell him the full of my meaning in that (...), that
((...) decently) implies (according to custom) viz. that in such things as
these, of which then I spoke, gestures, habits, and the like circumstances of
Gods (...) service, wherein the (...) prescribes care of decency, it is
necessary to observe the custom, of the place wherein we live.

Jeanes.
1. The customs of some places in gestures, habits, and the like circumstances
of Gods worship are very undecent, and it is not necessary to observe such
customs: But you will perhaps (...) that you except undecent customs, and then
you are to be understood only of decent customs; for every custom is decent
or undecent: because decency and undecency are privatively opposed, and inter
(...) opposita non datur (...) in subjecto (...), between privative opposites
there is no middle either of (...) or participation (...) a capable subject:
The (...) and upshot then of your meaning is, that, decently implies, according
unto decent customs; and then

1. The full of your meaning is but a (...) speech, that proves nothing in the
Controversy, unless you also prove the Ceremonies controverted, to (...) so
decent, as that the (...) of them will be undecent in the service of God. 2. I
would (...) know, how you will suit unto it the proof of it: Custom is the
only rule of decency, for there too, by custom you understand that which is
decent, so that your argument runs thus: decent custom is the only rule of
decency; therefore (...) decently, implies decent customs. And this argument
most of your learned Readers will (to borrow your words concerning a saying of
mine) despise under the appearance of a (...).
2. If the full of your meaning in that passage, that (...) decently, implies
according to custom, be, that in such things as these, of which then you
spoke, gestures, habits and the (...) circumstances of Gods public service,
etc. it is necessary to observe the customs of the place wherein we live, why
then I must be bold to tell you, that the full of your: meaning is very short of
the meaning of the Apostle; for these words of the Apostle, let all things be
done decently (...), etc. (...), prohibits all undecency not only that
undecency against the custom of the place wherein we live, but also that
undecency which is against the dictates of the Law of Nature. By this the
Reader may see, how defective your exposition is: the Apostle says, let all
things be done decently, and your gloss is, let some things in Gods worship be
done according unto some customs, to (...), such as are decent.

3. I suppose that by gestures, habits, and the like circumstances in the
service of God, you mean such of them as are Symbolical ceremonies; for
otherwise your full meaning is nothing unto the purpose, because it will be no
ground for that uniformity you plead for. Now that the Apostles words, let all
things be done decently implies, that in humane Symbolical ceremonies it is
necessary that we observe the customs of the place wherein we live, is a thing
which I utterly deny, and shall be constant in such denial, until you drive me
from it by some convincing argument; and that I do not do this out of stomach,
will appear by the reason that I shall allege: The words of the Apostle, let
all things be done decently, (...) not disobeyed, unless there be some
undecency committed in the worship and service of God; for decency and
undecency are privatively opposite, and therefore there is decency in those
actions where there is no undecency; but now by the omission of Symbolical
ceremonies of humane institution, such as the Cross in Baptism, Surplice in
Prayer and Preaching, which can plead custom of the present place we live in,
there is committed no undecency in the worship and service of God, viz. in
Baptism, in Preaching and Praying, as will be apparent unto any man that will
attempt to prove syllogistically the contrary; therefore the Apostles precept
is not disobeyed by the omission of such Symbolical ceremonies, and
consequently the Apostles precept does not in any way imply such Ceremonies.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 6.
This I then thought sufficiently explicated by exemplifying in men's wearing
long hair, which the Apostle proved indecent by its being against (...), i. e.
says (...), (...), a custom of some continuance in that place (which yet in
women there, and men in other places, where that custom prevailed not, had
nothing indecent in it.)

Jeanes.
1. This conceit that you have out of (...), (...) de (...) disputes against;
but his argument satisfyeth me not, and therefore I shall wave all that he
says, and confine my self unto the very words of the Apostle for disproof of
your sense of them, and my reason is taken from the joining of (...) with
(...); for suppose that (...), Nature, may sometimes signify custom, yet
that' (...), nature it self should signify custom, is very improper.

2. Women's wearing of long hair is no religious (...) ceremony, but used out of
Gods worship and service, as well as in, and therefore a most impertinent
exemplification of that which you plead for, (...) in religious mystical
Ceremonies, that are proper and peculiar unto the special and solemn worship of
God.

I readily grant, that in some places, custom has made the long hair of women
one badge of distinction between them and men; but being by custom made such a
badge, nature it self dictates the observation of it; and if a man wear such
long hair as women, he sins against the law of nature. if not immediately and
(...), yet mediately ex interventu (...) (...).

As (...) is your second exemplification, if Chrysostomes and others exposition
may have place; for they refer [ we have no such custome] unto the words
immediately foregoing (and why we should go (...) for a coherence, I can see
no reason) if any man seem to be contentious: So that the meaning of the
Apostle is, we have no custom to be contentious: Now to be contentious, is a
sin against the Moral Law, the Law of Nature, and therefore belongs not (...)
to your discourse of Ceremonies.

Dr. Hammond. sect 7.
But this exemplification of my meaning he thought (...) to conceal from the
Reader, and supply that vacuity only with an etc. yet reciting at length, to a
word, what was immediately before, and after it. His design in so doing, I
judge not, but shall endeavor to undeceive the Reader for the future, by
farther enlarging on it.

Jeanes.
1. Women's wearing of long hair is no Symbolical ceremony, and therefore what
you said of it was an (...), and no exemplification of your (...), and
therefore I had no reason to take notice of it.

But 2. suppose it were an exemplification, yet unless it were also for (...)
of your (...); that (...) is (...) only rule of (...), I was no wise obliged
to (...) what you said herein; for I (...) told the Reader, I would transcribe
what was (...) in your words; now what I (...) out was not argumentative; (...)
from it, neither you, nor any man else can ever infer your now mentioned
conclusion.

Dr. Hammond sect. 8.
All people, I think, in the world, have some outward significations, and
expressions of Reverence; but all have not the same, but according to Topical
customs, some different, some contrary to others: We of this and all our (...)
nations express reverence by uncovering the (...), the (...) (...) the
contrary. Again, among Christians, it is customary for men so to express their
reverence, but for women, says the Apostle, it is not, but the contrary; and
so it is still among us. Nay it was once among some Heathens (that worshipped
Mercury) an act of the highest reverence, even of adoration, to throw stones at
their God; among others, to cut themselves with Lances, when they were a
praying to him. And it can be no news to Mr. (...). that these customs were
not observed by other Countries; the Jews that (...) stones at Christ, and the
(...) that cut himself with them, were neither of them (...) to worship him.

Jeanes.
1, Unless you can prove, that there cannot be outward significations and
expressions of reverence in Gods service, without humane Symbolical ceremonies,
all this your enlargement about the expressions of reverence will be to no
purpose. We require reverence in all parts of Gods worship as well as you; but
then we hold, that Gods worship may be performed reverently, and in a seemly
manner, without mystical ceremonies of humane invention.

2. Kneeling in Prayer is an expression of the highest degree of Reverence,
Adoration; and it has a higher rule than Custom, viz. Scripture and the light
of Nature: No Custom can render this Kneeling undecent; unless you will say
those words of the Psalmist, Psalm. 95. 6, do not oblige Christians: O come,
let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our maker.

3. There be some customary expressions of reverence, that are undeniably
unjustifiable, and you cannot say that they are employed in the Apostles (...).
Thus (...) expression of reverence, it is a (...) with Papists not to touch the
bread with their hands, but to have it put into their (...); and upon the like
pretense of reverence, it is customary amongst them, for Lay men to abstain
from the Cup altogether.

Lastly, why you bring in the Heathens throwing of stones at Mercury in a way
of worship, I cannot divine; for I cannot imagine, that you (...) it to be a
decent way of worship, and if it be undecent, then (...) serves nothing unto
the exemplification of your meaning.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 9.
This therefore was no dark, but visible foundation of what I said; In
assigning any rite or ceremony for the service of God, (...), says the (...),
was to (...) observed, the only rule to judge of that, is, say I, to consider
the Customs of that particular place, of which we consult. Where bowing the
knee, or (...) on the ground is customarily used as a token of reverence, where
putting off, or keeping off the hat, there the choice of Ceremonies must be
made with (...) to those particular (...): Here it is evident, that I mean not
the frequent usage of that ceremony, in opposition to a first usage of it, as
Mr. (...). is willing to mistake me, and found one of his arguments upon that
mistake, but the standing custom of the place, by which, as by an argument or
evidence, such a ceremony is demonstrated to be a reverential respect, and so
(for the service of God, to whom all reverence is due) decent in that place,
though in nature or in the estimation of all other men, it be not so.

Jeanes.
1. If the Apostle had said, as you say, he says, there ought to be no farther
controversy about the lawfulness of humane ceremonies; but that clause in
assigning any rite or ceremony for the service of God, etc.] is an Apocryphal
addition of yours, without any color from the Text it self, or from the
coherence; and therefore all you build upon it is but fancy and fiction: That
the Apostles decency cannot be observed without assigning such Rites and
Ceremonies as you dispute for, you may dictate and boldly affirm, but can never
with all your learning (...) prove; and unless you can make proof hereof, you
and your party have just reason to be ashamed of urging this place for
ceremonies, with such an unshaken confidence as you do.

2. Whereas you tell us, it is evident that you mean not the frequent usage of
that ceremony in opposition to the first usage of it: This evidence of your
meaning you have not so much as attempted to prove; and if you shall for the
future make such an attempt, it would, I am afraid, prove (...). The custom of
a thing (unless you can fasten upon it a sense or meaning never yet heard of)
is opposed unto the first usage of that thing; for custom implies the
frequent usage of a thing, and to say that the frequent usage of a thing is the
first usage of it, is an evident repugnancy and an apparent contradiction,
contradictio in adjecto (...) in (...), as they say. I am therefore much to
seek for the sense and reason of that Antithesis you make in these words, I
mean, not the frequent usage of that ceremony in opposition to a first usage of
it, but the standing custom of the place, etc. for it is impossible that the
standing custom of the place in a ceremony, should be the first usage of that
ceremony; where the mistake is let the Reader judge.

3. In that which follows, there is nothing of argument, unless you can
prove every ceremony, which can plead the standing custom of a place, to be a
fitting and decent expression of that reverential respect, which is due unto
God. Bishop Morton in his Book of the Institution of the Sacrament of the
blessed (...) and Blood of Christ, p. 80, 81. shows that the opinion of
reverence, has been the (...) and nurse of (...) superstitions; and after such
demonstration he quotes a saying of (...) upon Joh. 13. 8. Let us therefore
learn (...) honor and reverence Christ as he would, and not as we think sit.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
10. Certainly this is so evident in it self, and so undeniably the importance
of my words, that there can be no need farther to enlarge on it, much less to
examine the weight, or meaning of his concession, (...) it cannot be (...) but
that (...) does imply such customs, the omission of which (...) inferres
indecency]

11. This saying of his some Readers may look on with Reverence, as not readily
comprehending the importance of it, others may (...) to (...) it under the
appearance of a tautologie. But upon pondering, it will appear that the Author
had a (...) in it; which be designed should bring in some advantage to his
cause, and without which he was not likely to advance far, (...) succeed in it.

12. Some customs we know there are, which are so highly decent, as that the
omission of then necessarily infers indecency: But what are they? why such as
the law of (at least (...)) nature prescribes, covering of nakedness, and the
like; of which it is evident among all that have not learnt of Carneades
industriously to raze out all natural measures of honest and dishonest, that
the omission of them (...) indecency, yea and necessarily infers it, this sort
of decency being natural to all men that ever were, or shall be in the world,
born and educated in what uation, or inured to what custom seever, and this
the very first hour after our first Parents fall, before any custom had been
contracted which might recommend it to them.

13 And as of these his rule is true, that the omission of these necessarily
inferrs undecency, so it is in a manner proper to these, and belongs not to any
other sort of things, whose decency flows but from some positive command
though it be of God, or custom, or command of men. To such things whose
decency flows from any (...) either of God or man, this rule cannot be fully
applied; for that command might have been not given, or there might be a space
before it was given, or a people to whom it was not given, and then in any of
those cases the omission would not be indecent, to whom the law was not given;
and so it does not necessarily and absolutely, but only dependently on the
(...), and (...), (...) (...); so in like manner the (...) holds not in those
things, whose (...) is introduced only by custom, for that Mr. (...). (...)
says, (...) (...) frequency of actions, it must again be granted, (...)
there was a time when that which now is (...), was new, and so not custom; and
again, there are, or may be Nations, with whom that custom (whatsoever can
be instanced in) has not (...), which prejudges still the (...) spoken of,
that such omission should infer indecencie.

And so we see the sum of Mr. J. his liberal concession, viz. that decency
(...) natural decency, or such customs, which are naturally decent, and so
the omission of them naturally indecent; and if the Doctor or his party do not
prove, or make (...), that the administration of Baptism without the Cross is
against the law of nature, that the Preaching without the Surplice bears (...)
to the (...) of nakedness, he is utterly refuted by Mr. J. in his
interpretation of (...), or notion of decency.

Jeanes.
1. That I had no design in putting in the word necessarily, is evident by my
leaving it out in the next words; but that the omission of such ceremonies as
ours does inserre (...), the Doctor and all his party can never make good. You
shall have my good leave instead of necessarily to place truly, or
convincingly. Voeiferations I have heard many against the undecency of Gods
worship and service amongst (...), and when I have called for proof, (...) have
been told, amongst other things, that they Baptized without the (...), that
they put up prayers unto God (...) a (...); but that (...) is undecently (...),
where such toys as these are omitted, you may stoutly affirm, but can never
prove, by so much as one convictive (...): the word necessarily may (...) very
well be inserted, in opposition to the (...) (...) of the ignorant, and
prooflesse dictates of some learned men. Ignorant men may (...), and learned
men may (...), that the omission of our ceremonies (...) infer indecency, but
this surmise and dictate can never be made good by argument.

2. In Logic, a necessary inference is opposed unto that (...) is follacious,
as also that which is but probable and contingent; and therefore I wonder why
you should quarrel at the word necessarily? for do you think in earnest, that
decency implies such customs, the omission of which does sophistically, or at
the best, only probably inserre undecency, you cannot, I know, harbor so
(...) and irrational a thought, and therefore you must say as I do, that
decency here implies only such customs, the omission of which, necessarily
infer undecency.

3. When you say that my rule is in a manner proper to those customs, which the
Law, of at least, lapsed Nature prescribes, that limitation in a manner is a
backdoor, out of which how far you may run, I know not, and therefore until
you somewhere make a stand, I shall not run after you.

4. Whereas you fasten upon me this assertion, that decency here implies only
such customs which are naturally decent, viz. prescribed immediately by the
Law of Nature, and so (...) omission of them naturally indecent, you have for
this no color, but that which you take from the word necessarily, and how weak
a ground this is for such an imputation, you must needs (...), when you
remember what I now told you, that accessarily here is opposed unto fall:
ciously and probably. Dr. (...) himself in the dispute about humane ceremonies,
page 58. confesses, that comeliness, in the very place of the Apostle,
contains all natural and civil handsomness; and in his Reply to Mortons
general Defense, etc. cap. 3. sect. 28. he acknowledges the women's vailes, 1
Cor. 11. to be an instance of this decency; for by the example of it, he
concludes that other Churches may be directed so far, just as the Apostles
rule stretches, 1 Cor 14. 40. Let all things be done (...): when Bishop Morton
desired to know whether this matter were not a thing indifferent? his answer
is, it is indifferent in the general nature of it; yet at that time, and in
that place, they sinned that did otherwise, (...) before Paul, or any of their
overseers gave them charge about it. By this his answer it is apparent, that he
did not think it dictated by Nature unto the Corinthians, before any custom
had recommended it unto them. As for my own part you shall have here my frank
concession, that decency here implies even that decency which is introduced by
civil custom, provided,

1. That it be, consuetudo rationabilis; for no other custom can have the
force and (...) of a law, and if you, or any other can bring Suarez (...) legib.
any arguments, that it was consuetudo rationabilis which introduced our
ceremonies, they shall have, God willing, an answer. 2. That the omission of it
renders Gods worship undecent: the equity of this limitation appears from
this reason, because the Apostles command of decency is not violated but by
undecency: This is at large set down in Ames his dispute about humane
ceremonies, page 77, 78.
Lastly, your, and my learned friend Mr Barlow, resolves and proves, Exercit.
Metaph. p. 29. every moral evil, every evil of sin, to be against the law of
Nature, if not proxime and immediate, yet mediate ex interventu legis
positivae, now the undecency here prohibited by the Apostle is a moral evil,
a sin, malum culpae, therefore it is at least mediately against the Law of
Nature. Your great and learned (...), page 95. of his Ecclesiastical Polity
says, that this rule of the (...) is an edict of Nature, a Canon of that Law
which is written in all men's hearts; the Church had for ever, no less then
now, stood bound (...) observe it, whether the Apostle had mentioned it or no.
And hereupon I shall infer, that if you or your party do not prove or make
good, that the administration of Baptism without the Cross, that Preaching,
Praying, without the Surplice, is against the Law of nature, in some sense at
least, mediately, he is utterly (...) by Mr. Hooker his interpretation of
'(...), or notion of decency; and I do not desire to live so long, as to see
such a proof as this made.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 15.
This is indeed his meaning, which (though somewhat darkened in that his
expression) will appear but consequent to the two things which he has premised
in this matter from Amesius his notion of decency. p. 64. in marg. 1. that
(...) requires not that any sacred things be instituted de (...), but only
that those things which are instituted by God, be used in that (...) which is
agreeable to the dignity of them. 2. That as order, so decency belongs to civil
offices, as well as sacred things, in which indecorum est vitium oppositum
debito illi modo, qui (...) ad little justum finem, and usum consequendum, (...)
is a vice opposed to that due manner which is (...) to the obtaining the just
end, and use of those things. Now if in the (...) of (...), the mode he speaks
of, as agreeable to the dignity of those things which are (...), be it
self-supposed by him to be (...) by men, then must he acknowledge humane (...)
of (...) ceremonies, which being so contrary to his design, I must (...) (...)
to be (...) (...) by him; but rather, (...) as the sacred things (...)
instituted by (...), so the mode which is consentaneous to their dignity is
instituted (...) God also, and (...) (...) is decent in sacris, which is not so
instituted. And so (...) (...) on the second (...), that of civil (...). For
that indecency, which is a vice or sin, must be (...) to (...) Law of Gods, and
so also that which is (...) to the (...) manner which is (...); (...) so is
necessary either necessitate medii, or praecepti also to obtaining a just end,
this sure is more than the omission of an indifferent (...), (...) may, or may
not be continued without any offense against nature, even the omission of
strict universal duty, either natural decency, or somewhat that bears
proportion with it.

Jeanes.
Both Ames and my poor self (...), (...) God has by the Canon of the Apostle,
and by the light of Nature, appointed and commanded, that (...) in his worship
and service, the neglect (...) would be undecent; but that he holds that there
is need of a special divine institution to render a thing decent, is disclaimed
by Ames in several places of his writings: Medul. Theol. lib. 2. c. 14. sect.
24, 25, 26. Hujusmodi igitur (...), quae (...) natura sunt civiles, aut
communes. nen sunt particulariter in (...) praeceptae, partim, quia in (...)
hominum sensum incurrunt; and (...), quia infra dignitatem and (...) legis
(...) (...), ut talia (...) in illa praescribantur, hac (...) ratione (...)
(...) fuissent singulari lege cavenda: Exempli gratia, ne in ecclesiastico,
(...) (...) in (...) sinu sese colocaret, in alterius (...) (...), out ne (...)
(...) in sacris actionibus. Habendae (...) sunt (...) ex (...) Dei (...). 1.
Quta in genere (...), sub lege ordinis, decori, and (...). 2 Quia pleraeque
(...) (...) sequuntur ex (...) quae (...) (...) sunt (...) constituta. (...)

quo possint convenire, and (...) etiam assignatam, qua (...) (...) (...); (...)
etiam minister a Des sit constitutus ad alios (...) instituendos, fimul etiam
constituitur, ut (...) and fitum corporis illum habeat, qui tali (...) congruit.

25. Illa igitur quae pertinent ad ordinem and decorum, non ita relinquuntur

26. Variae enim (...) and (...) circumstantiae tales sunt, ut nulla
institutione publica accedente, debeant tamen a singulis observari, neque (...)
(...) hominibus prohiberi sine (...).

24. Such like circumstances therefore, which of their own nature are civil or
common, are not particularly commanded in the Scriptures, partly because they
come into men's common sense, and partly because it would not stand with the
dignity and majesty of the Law of God, that such things should be severally
prescribed in it. For by this (...) many ridiculous (...) should have been
provided for by a special Law; as for example, that in the Church assenibly one
should not place himself in another (...), spit in another face, or should
not make months in holy actions: Yet they are to be accounted as commanded
from God: 1. Because they are (...) in general under the Law of (...),
Decency, and (...). 2. Because most of them do necessarily follow from those
things which are (...) appointed by God. For when God appointed that the
faithful of all sorts should meet together to celebrate his name, and worship,
he did consequently (...) that they should have a sit and conventent place,
wherein they may meet together, and an hour also assigned at which they may be
(...) together: when also there is a Minister appointed by God to teach others
publicly, it is withal appointed that he have a seat which is meet for such
an action.

25. Those things therefore which pertain to order and decency, are not so
(...) to men's wills, that they may under the name of that, (...) what they
please upon the (...): but they are partly determined by the general precepts
of God, partly by the nature of the things themselves, and partly by those
circumstances which do offer themselves upon occasion.

26. For diverse circumstances of order and decency are such, as though there be
no public institution of them, yet they (...) to be observed of every one,
neither can men forbid them without sin. Unto this add another place in his
(...) soit against Ceremonies, disput. page 29. We never said, or thought, that
all particular rites pertaining to order and decency are punctually determined
in the Scripture. We never dreamed, that all such (...) being beside the
particular determination of the Scripture, are against it, we speak of double,
or treble rites as the Rejoinder (...) them, (...) no mere order and decency
does (...) require, but only the mere will of man (...). That which is
instituted by God in his worship, (...) (...) (...) well to be a part of Gods
worship; but that decency (...) no part of Gods worship, Ames in his disput.
page 176. proves by a Reason quoted out of (...). (...), Def of Mr. (...). page
844 Order and comeliness (says the Popish Bishop) is some part of (...)
worship. But (says Dr. Abbot) who taught him this deep point of Philosophy,
that an accident is a part of the subject, that the beauty or comeliness of
the body is a part of the body, order and (...) properly and immediately
respect men, and therefore can be no parts of the worship of God. To be
instituted by God, if we speak (...) and properly, is to be enjoined by a
divine positive Law superadded unto the law of (...); and in conformity
hereunto it is that our Author Ames divides Gods worship, Med. lib. 2. cap. 5.
into natural and instituted: Now if this be your meaning, when you impute unto
Ames and me, that our opinion is, that nothing is decent in (...), which is not
instituted by God, as the charge is false in it self, so it proves not that
which you bring it for, viz. that in our sense decency in the Apostle, is only
that decency which the law of nature prescribes; but (...) the clean contrary,
because that which is instituted by a positive law superadded to the law of
nature, is not prescribed (...) and immediate by the law of nature.

You are by this time, I hope, conscious of the great injury you have done unto
poor Dr. Ames, in (...) unto him so irrational an opinion, and hereupon I shall
be bold to give you this advertisement, that however you may despise him as a
mean Author, unworthy of your perusal, yet, if you undertake to (...) and
refute him, you must read him, or else you will be very liable unto the breach
of the ninth Commandment, Thou shall not bear false witness against thy
neighbor.

But you will perhaps say in defense of your self, that if it were not the
opinion of Ames, it is the sequel of his words; and for this you have two
reasons.

The 1. because the mode or manner agreeable unto the dignity of sacred things
is instituted by God, as the sacred things are instituted by God: But this
proposition, if it be particular, (...) nothing, and if it be universal, is
false, as you might have seen in the next reason of Ames, but that you cannot
see wood for trees, as the Proverb is; There is a mode or manner in the use of
sacred things agreeable unto their dignity, that is not adequate, proper, and
peculiar to them, but common unto civil matters of a grave nature together
with them; and this is a matter inculcated by Dr. Ames in many places, which if
you had weighed, you would never have troubled the Reader with this objection,
Medul. Theol. lib. cap. 14. th: 23. (...) igitur hujusmodi circumstantiae
vocari soleant a nonnullis ritus and ceremoniae religiosae, (...)
ecclesiasticae, nihil tamen habent in sua natura, quod proprium est religionis,
atque adeo in iis non proprie consistit cultus (...), (...) ex little neglectu,
and contemptu violatur aliquo modo (...) cultus religiosi; quia communis illa
ratio ordinis and decori quae aeque convenit religiosis actibus, (...) que
civilibus, a religioso cultu non potest separart, quin oliquo modo (...) ipsius
dignitas and majestas. Although these circumstances of time, place, and other
like, are wont by some to be called rites, or religious Ecclesiastical
ceremonies, yet in their nature they have nothing that is proper to Religion,
and therefore religious worship (...) not properly consist in them, however by
neglect and contempt of such circumstances, the sanctity of such religious
worship is in some sort violated, because the common respect of order and
decency, which do equally agree to religious and civil actions cannot be
severed from religious worship, without diminishing of the sanctity and dignity
of it.

Thus also largely in his Manuduction to the dispute about humane Ceremonies,
page 55, 56. If men and (...) come purposely in their best apparel to Church,
if they compose themselves to a grave posture, give the upper place to the
chiefest persons, and take such to themselves as they may hear the (...) in,
and yet have no exception taken against them for it, if all the places and
seats be made cleanly, and fit for a meeting, to be held in a (...) fashion,
all these are Ceremonies according to the Rejoinder his definition, yet no man
but out of contention will affirm, they are merely religious or
ecclesiastical: For all these in the same manner, and to the same immediate
end, the same persons would do, if the meeting were to hear the Magistrate
propound unto them a grave civil business, concerning the Commonwealth
affairs. And surely that which remaining the same may be civil, is not merely
and properly ecclesiastical, but common to both uses, and rather merely civil,
than merely ecclesiastical; because civility is supposed and included in
ecclesiastical affairs, but ecclesiastical proceedings are not supposed and
included in civil. Dr. Jackson in his original of unbelief, page 337. does well
observe, that decent behavior does change the subject only, not alter its own
nature and form, whilst it is used in matters sacred, nor is the habit of civil
complement, or good manners, such an unhallowed weed, as must be laid aside
when we come into the Sanctuary. And indeed there is no more reason to shut
civility out of the Church or sacred business, than to shut Religion out of
the Town house, or civil affairs.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 15.
And so likewise on the second head that of civil offices, for that indecency
which is a vice or sin must be contrary to some law of God, etc.

Jeanes.
Indecency in things civil, however it may be a vice in Ethics against
civility and good manners, yet it is not always a sin in divinity contrary to
some law of Gods but undecency in things sacred in the worship and service of
God, if it be voluntary and avoydable, is against the command of the Apostle,
which is a rule of the law of nature, says Hooker; and this I believe you will
not deny in cold blood: and indeed you have no reason to deny it; for it will
not hereupon follow that the Apostle injoyneth only that decency which is
immediately prescribed by the Law of Nature, and my reason is, because as the
Apostle, so the light of Nature injoyneth as that decency the neglect whereof
would be undecent by the light of nature; so also that, the omission whereof
would be uncomely by (...) custom, and therefore as undecency by the light of
nature is against the light and Law of Nature immediately, so also undecency by
civil custom is against the law of nature mediately. The long hair of women
is one note by which custom has distinguished them (...) men; and therefore
it is undecent for men to wear such long hair as women, and this supposed, men's
wearing of such long hair is a mediate (...) of the Law of nature; whereupon
the Apostle propounds this smart interrogation unto the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 11.
14 Does not even nature it self teach you, that (...) a man have long hair,
it is a shame to him? We may say the same of the long garments of women: does
not even nature teach you (...) if a man wear such garments it is a shame unto
him, and very undecent, and yet the undecency thereof arises immediately from
civil custom, and not (...) any immediate Law of Nature.

Dr. Hammond.
For that indecency, which is a vice, or sin must be contrary to some Law of
Gods, and so also that which is opposed to the due manner which is (...), and
so is (...) either incessitate (...), or (...) also, to obtain in a just end,
this sure is more then the (...) of an indifferent custom, which may, or may
not be continued without any offense against nature, even the omission of
strict universal duty, either natural decency, or somewhat that bears
proportion with it.

Jeanes.
That decency in Gods worship and service, the neglect of which would be
undecent, is necessary both (...) (...) and praecepti.

1. Medii is required as a means unto the acceptable celebration of Gods
worship, but then it is not a means proper and peculiar thereunto, for it has
the same immediate end both in civil and religious matters, and therefore is
common unto both.

2 That it is necessary necessitate praecepti you cannot question, unless you
will deny the title and obligation unto the Apostles injunction, for that it
binds as an edict of nature we have the testimony of your own Hooker: if this
twofold necessity of decency be chargeable with any absurdities, you are as
deeply concerned to answer them as my self: indeed that decency. from the
omission whereof we cannot infer indecency is necessary, neither necessitate
praecepti, nor medii.

But with such a decency we have nothing to do; for it comes not within the
compass of the Apostolical command, and such is the decency of your ceremonies
altogether unnecessary; neither commanded by any Law of God, nor necessary as a
means for the better service of God. But perhaps you may attempt to prove, that
God is better served with your Ceremonies, than without them; when I shall have
such proof from you, I shall return it an answer.

In the mean while let us consider the absurdity with which you charge the
assertion of the, but now mentioned, double necessity of decency in Gods
worship: If that be necessary, necessitate praecepti, or medii, then undecency,
say you, which is opposed thereunto, is more than the omission of an
indifferent custom, which may, or may not be continued without any offense
against nature.

For answer, the undecency here prohibeted by the Apostle, is either by the
light of nature, or by civil custom.

The former is more than the omission of an indifferent custom, and is an
immediate transgression against nature.

As for the latter, we must distinguish of a twofold consideration of such
customs, they may be considered either (...) (...) in the general, as
abstracted from all singularizing circumstances, or (...) (...) (...) and
(...), as clothed with such and such circumstances, and so they are not
indifferent but necessary necessitate both praecepti and medii. I might
exemplify this by instancing in the long hair, proper apparel, viz. long
garments of women, and the like. There is a passage in Ames, already (...),
that will be here very apposite; Bishop Morton had demanded of him whether the
women's vailes, 1 Cor. 11. were not a thing indifferent, and his answer is, it
is indifferent in the general nature of it, yet at that time, and in that
place, they finned that did otherwise, even before Paul, or any of their
Overseers gave them charge about it.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 16.
Now this being thus far explained, it is time to close with Mr: J. and mind
him, what he cannot but know, that the decency which I said, employed custom,
is certainly another thing from natural decency, and has place only in those
things, the omitting of which does not necessarily infer indecency. That
omission which necessarily infers indecency, infers it in all that ever did it,
or shall omit it: We know in Logic that no proposition is necessary, which is
not (...), true in the whole species of all, and every one, and I leave it to
his judgment, whether he think the Dr. and his party (i. e. Prelatists, I
suppose) do conceive, that Adam, (whether in, or out of Paradise) Noah in, or
out of the Ark, etc. were obliged to pray in Surplices under pain of indecency?
And so (in his other instance) that John Baptist, that Christ, or (because the
Text says that he baptized not, but his Disciples) that those Disciples, even
before the death of Christ, might not baptize any without the sign of the
Cross, but under the same penalty?

Jeanes.
Natural decency is a branch, nay the principal branch of that decency
commanded by the Apostle, and therefore I could not think it excluded by you;
but withal, I must conclude your interpretation of the Apostle, to be very
(...) and defective, when you said the clear importance of the Apostles words
was, Let all things be done according to custom; I was so foolish to suppose
that you meant this clear importance of the Apostles words, was also the full
importance of them, neither can you assign any reason, why I should think
otherwise.

But that, I see, which so much stumbleth you, is the word necessarily,
concerning which I hope you are satisfied by what I have already said, and
therefore I shall only add this one thing, that necessarily has two
acceptions.

1. In regard of an absolute necessity. 2. In respect of an Hypothetical
necessity arising from some extrinsecal circumstance or condition. Now, I (...)
not restrain it unto either of these senses, but take it abstractively in such
a latitude, as that it is appliable unto either of the significations according
unto the nature of the things spoken of: the omission of natural (...) infers
undecency necessarily, in regard of an absolute necessity; the omission of
civil undecency, insers undecency necessarily only ex Hypothesi: and that
inference of indecency which is only necessary ex Hypothesi, is more than an
inference thereof, which is fallacious, or at the most but probable; and if we
speak of this necessity, it is very false which you say, that that omission
which thus necessarily inferres undecency, inferres it in all that ever did, or
shall omit it.
But you say that, we know in Logic, that no (...) is (...), which is not de
omni true in the whole species of all and every one.

Unto which I answer, that he who has any tolerable knowledge in (...), (...)
that what you say is to be limited only unto that necessity which is
scientifical and demonstrative; for to say nothing of such propositions as are
necessary only hypothetically, there are diverse propositions absolutely in
themselves (...), setting aside all outward circumstances and conditions, which
are not (...) de omni.

1. I shall instance in diverse particular propositions, as, Quaedam (...) est
(...): (...) corpus est mixtum. 2. In several negative propositions, as, nullus
spiritus est corpus: nullus lapis est (...). Now these are necessary
propositions, because of an immutable truth, and they are not de omni: For,
1. A particular proposition is not de omni, but de aliquo: And then 2. a
negative proposition is not de omni; for de omni is opposed unto that which is
(...) de nullo.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 17.
Nay, it is already past question, that Mr. J. in his first argument against my
dictate (as he calls it) says, that the light and law of nature is also a rule
of (...), and so not only custom: And if so, then custom is a rule of
decency also, and not only the law and light of nature, and where (...), and
not the light of nature is the rule, there the omission of that does not
necessarily infer indecency. And of such decency alone it is evident that I
spoke, on the head of Uniformity (and could not speak sense, if I spoke, either
of any other, or of the general notion of decency, which is competible to any
other) and (...) thence it follows demonstratively that of that decency of
which I spoke (though not of that, of which it is certain I spoke not) still
custom is the only rule of decency.

This therefore I hope may serve in answer to his first charge, that of my
timidity, that I dared not say what I said not; together with a view of his
concession of the truth of what I did say, and the wary limitation of that
concession.

Jeanes.
1. I called your assertion, viz. Custom is the only rule of decency, a
dictate, and shall call it so still, until you can prove it, and when you
bring any solid proof of it, abstracted from your (...), for limitations I
cannot call them, I shall be contented to be your vassal.

2 You seem to (...), that in the things you speak of, custom, and not the
light of nature is the role, but this is very false; for custom is mensura
passiva, as well as activa: When it is a rule of decency, it is first measured
and regulated by the light of nature, and without such regulation it is no rule
of decency in any matter whatsoever; for custom has not the force of a law
(...) sit rationabilis, that is agreeable unto the dictate of right reason and
the law of Nature; the law of Nature then is still the principal rule of
decency, speak of what decency you will or can, and custom is but a rule
subordinate thereunto, and to be examined thereby.

3. If you speak of such decency alone, the omission whereof does not
necessarily infer undecency, in respect either of an absolute, or (...)
necessity, you do not speak of that decency which the Apostle commands; for
that the Apostle should command such a decency, in the omission of which, men
only boldly affirm, or merely opine there is (...), and cannot make good such
an affirmation or opinion, by any other than sophistical, or at the best, but
probable arguments, me thinks should not sink into the head of any rational man.

Yea, but you say, that you could not speak sense, if you spoke either of any
other, or of the general notion of decency which is competible to any other.

Suppose I grant this, what then? this argument is of little prevalency with
me, who am in this particular your Antagonist; for though I acknowledge and
admire your great parts and learning, yet I think it not only possible, but
probable for you, or any other, though never so great a scholar, to speak
nonsense in opposition of the truth.

2. It is evident and certain that the Apostle spoke of the general notion of
decency, which is competible unto natural decency, and from thence it follows
demonstratively, that if it be so certain, that you speak not of this decency,
it is as certain that your gloss of the Apostles' (...) is (...) and maimed;
for it leaves out what is chiefly meant by it, but of this before.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 18.
Secondly, then to his second charge, the unsufficiency of that limited truth
(which is the utmost he will yield my (...)) to prove what I would have from
it] It will soon appear of how little force it is, when (...). my meaning was
quite another thing from what he affixt to my words, or yielded me in his
limited concession, as has already been largely manifested; and 2. my
conclusion is regularly consequent to that which (...) alone my meaning. This
latter the addition of a few words will clear also.

Jeanes.
For answer unto this I shall refer unto what has been said already.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 19.
My conclusion designed in that Section was the justifying of Uniformity of
Ceremonies in the service of God, and one of the grounds to support that, the
decency of those ceremonies, wherein all should join, and that decency ruled,
and judged of by the custom of the place in which such and such a ceremony was
an usual indication, and expression of that reverence, which being due from all
inferiors to their superiors is much more due from all Christians to God.

Jeanes.
1. (...) ceremonies have two acceptions. 1. They are taken largely for all
circumstances of order, decency; as also for all mere indicant signs of
reverence, and these for distinction sake may be called circumstantial
ceremonies: but these are not the ceremonies in question; for the
Non-conformists acknowledge these law full, and so also Uniformity in them; but
yet of these ceremonies, custom is neither the only or principal rule, as
shall be manifested when I come unto the examination of your Answer unto my
Objections against this your dictate.

In (...) second place, humane ceremonies are taken strictly, only for such as
are (...), symbolical, and sacramental, and unto such neither (...) nor
reverence (...) us.

Not, first, the Apostles decency; because in the omission of them there is no
undecency.

Not, secondly, that reverence which is due unto God in his worship, (...) in
the omission of them there is no irreverence committed; you may think my notion
of reverence to be too narrow; but it is the utmost I can grant you; and indeed
it is all that Scripture and Reason call for: reverence and irreverence are
(...) opposed, and between privative opposites, in a capable subject, there is
no medium, either of abnegation or participation, and therefore when there is
no irreverence in the external worship of God, that worship is reverently
administered: now that (...) is unreverently administered when the Cross is
omitted, or that (...) Prayers and Preaching are unreverent, when the Surplice
is left off, may perhaps be very affectionately averred by you and others, but
I do not hope to live so long as to receive from you, or any man living, for
it, so much as the shadow of an argument.

In the first place then you see that reverence binds not to humane,
religious, mystical ceremonies.

(...), in a second place, it binds to lay them quite aside, because Gods
Ordinances are treated very irreverently, when men's inventions are joined with
them, when men set their (...) (...) thresholds, and their posts by his posts,
Ezekiel. 43. 8. that is, when humane inventions are added unto Gods precepts.

Yea, but you may perhaps say our Ceremonies are joined with Gods Ordinances
only as adjuncts, or annexaries, not as parts of Gods worship.

But unto this I reply in the words of Ames unto Morton, all external
ceremonies, whose proper use is the honoring of God, are external worship, as
all divinity shows. Reply unto genesis Def. page 19.

Thirdly, the pretense of reverence in Gods worship, has (...) been an inlet
unto many superstitious practices; this Ames shows in his Reply unto (...)
particular Defense, etc page 69. Out of such (...) as this, says he, all
superstition has crept into the Sacrament. For expression of reverence, some
would not touch the bread with their hands, or the cup either, but have both
bread and wine put into their mouths. (...) more agreeably to (...) fashion
(urged by the (...)) where meat is taken with silver forks, (...) of hands,
devised a silver (...) to suck up the wine through. Some would not have (...)
(...). men (...) of the wine (...) all: And many for mere reverence (as they
say) will neither touch wine nor (...), abstaining altogether from the (...).
All these usages might have been, and may be (...), and yet custom cannot
legitimate them and make them decent. I shall conclude all that I have to say
unto (...) two last Sections with a remarkable passage in Parker his Treatise
of the (...), part. 1. page 112. The second office of the Cross is to procure
reverence to (...), (...) (...) esse communis ablutio: Which is the office of
the Salt, the Taper, and the rest of Popish signs, which how cut we (...), but
with this Ax that beheadeth the (...) as well. Non (...), etc. We must not think
but that the Baptism of Christ, and of the Apostles was performed with
reverence enough, when these (...) were wanting; neither must we take upon us
to be wiser than they. To procure right reverence to the Sacrament, is to lay
open the institution by the Preaching of the Word, and then to deliver it in
that simplicity in wh ch we have received it. To add signs over and above is
(...) to honor it, but to (...) it. Indeed the (...) had been more honorably
(...), if (...) had been sent home again as it came into the land and hand of
the (...). (...) thought they could not honor it sufficiently, unless they
set a budget by it of certain new devised signs to wait upon it, which did
defile it. David (...) this budget, and did well: Howbeit, (...) Cart he
thinks cannot well be spared, for which the Lord made a breach in Israel,
until he drove him to confess that he was not sought in due order, as long as
one Ceremony of the Philistines did remain. The Lord show mercy to our Church,
otherwise he will show, that our (...) of the Popish budget, in banishing the
salt, the oil, the (...), with the rest, will not be judged sufficient, unless
we cease also with a (...) of theirs to cart Baptism, which should be born up
to reverence no other way than by the shoulders of the Levites, I mean the
labors of those Preachers which now ((...)) lie in the dust, because they will
not defile their hands by touching of this Philistim (...) for to uphold it.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 20, 21.
In these it is certain, custom is the rule and the only rule of (...):
Neither nature nor Gods Law obliges all mankind to this, or that expression
(...). (...) nations have their several manners of doing (...); only nature
tells us, that the most reverent manner of treating is best becoming God, and
that it cannot be decent, to treat (...) in that manner as we would not do
(...) (...) beside, and Gods (...) (...) about the offering of polluted bread
(...) his (...), and of sacrificing the lame and the sick, Mal. 1. 8. is a
confirmation of that; Offer it now, says God, unto thy (...), will he be
pleased with thee?

21. Apply this to a particular case, to a Nation, where it is customary to
address to Kings kneeling, and (...) the (...) will (...) exactly (but not
where that is not custom) Among such I may say, Did ever any man that had his
limbs and health offer a (...) to his Prince in the gesture of sitting, or
lying along upon a table? and if he did not, then I (...), I suppose, regularly
conclude from custom, the only rule of (...) in (...) matters, that according
to Gods arguing it cannot be decently done in his service, (...) is the
tendering our petitions or requests to that infinite Majesty. And so (...) in
other things.

Jeanes.
Your (...) of the indications and expressions of that reverence of which
custom is the only rule, by instancing in kneeling in prayer, when we tender
our petitions or requests to the infinite majesty of God, is very impertinent;
for it is very evident, that (...) is not the only (...) of it, because it is
sufficiently warranted both by Scripture and the light of Nature.

Unto all this I shall add a distinction of reverence; it may be taken
sometimes largely, and so it comprehends (...): sometimes strictly, and so it
is distinguished (...) (...); for reverence, is due unto the Ordinances of God,
(...), and worship only unto God: (...) (...) be a (...) and subordinate rule
of the signs of reverence, taken strictly, whereupon by custom, uncovering of
the (...) is a general or common gesture of reverence, to be used with
discretion in all (...) exercises; but now as for the indications and
expressions of adoration, I do think the Scripture a (...) rule of them, where,
I do not exclude the law and light of nature, for materially considered, it is
a part of Scripture.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 22.
This I did not apply to the Cross in Baptism; and the Ministers using of the
(...), as being not (...) to that place. Another (...) was set (...) for those,
and proceeded to sect. 18. the Cross expressly named, and the (...) employed
under the title of other Ceremonies, of which it may there be seen, what my
(...) was, not what is here deemed incambent on me to prove, that the (...) of
them infers (...), but that standing on (...) (...), whereon they are known to
stand, Conscience duly instructed, cannot think it (...), or tending to (...)
to cast them (...) out of this Church, or the whole Liturgy for their sakes.

Jeanes.
What you said, was applyable unto the Cross in Baptism, and the Ministers
using of the Surplice for your conclusion was, the more then lawfulness of
prescription of ceremonies in a Church, and of Uniformity therein; and here
sect. 19 you acknowledge that your cnclusion, designed in that Section, was the
justifying of Uniformity of Ceremonies in the service of God: now I had reason
to think that you speak of humane, religious, mystical ceremonies, because such
only were opposed by the Non-conformists, and such the Cross and Surplice
were, (...), though not exclusively.

2. If your design be to justify doctrinal ceremonies from the Apostles
command of decency, then it is incumbent on you to prove that the omission of
such ceremonies does (...) undecency; for if it does not infer undecency, then
therein there is no transgression of the Apostles precept, and if the Apostles
precept be not transgressed by the omission of them, the Assembly had no cause,
upon that account, to repent of their casting such ceremonies out of the Church
of God.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 23, 24.
And yet if Mr. J. shall now desire to know what the grounds of these two
Ecclesiastical rites are, which alone he is pleased to name, on persuasion, I
suppose, that they were as fit, if not fitter than any others for the
disproving my position, of (custom being the only rule of decency) I shall
now render him a brief account of them, such as may in some degree confirm the
truth of it.

24. And (...) for the Cross in Baptism. 1. It Is known to all, that our
Christian course is a spiritual Warfare under Christ our great General: Now
it is, and always has been customary over the world, that in a militia there
should be some Banner, or Ensign, to which every one should resort, and fight
under it. This has custom made decent among all; and supposing that custom,
the omission of it in an Army is indecent, yet not so, as things dishonest, or
breaches of the Law of Nature are indecent.

Jeanes.
1. As our Christian course is a spiritual warfare, so unto this the Ordinances
of Christ Jesus are a more suitable Banner or Ensign, than any humane invention
whatsoever: But you think that the Banner requisite in our spiritual warfare
must be of humane invention, not divine institution; for otherwise you speak
nothing to the purpose; and if the omission of such a Banner or Ensign be
undecent, you may arraign Christ and his Apostles as guilty of undency.

2. The sign of the Cross has been a long time used by Antichrist, as an
Ensign or Banner, and is it undecent to lay aside the Ensign or Banner of an
enemy?

3. How little weight there is in the customary use of a Banner for the decency
of the sign of the Cross in Baptism, will be apparent by these following
considerations.

1. It is a custom in Armies for different companies or troops to have
Banners or Ensigns; but it was never the custom of any Armies for every
several soldier to carry a Banner or Ensign: from the custom of a Banner or
Ensign then, how you can conclude for the signing of every singular Christian
with the sign of the Cross passes my imagination. 2. The customary use of a
Banner is in the whole war, and not only at the first enrolement of Soldiers,
and therefore if it prove any thing for the Sign of the Cross, it will
conclude for the frequent and constant use of it all the time of our warfare;
and this I hope you will not plead for. 3. A permanent Cross has more
proportion unto the Banners and Ensigns of Armies than the transient and aerial
Cross; and yet there be some of your party, who allow of the transient Cross
in Baptism, that dislike permanent Crosses in Gods worship; because they think
there is more danger of superstition in them: Now these men, in all
probability, lay no great stresse upon this your resemblance of the sign of the
Cross to a Banner or Ensign, and my reason for this my conjecture (for I urge
it only as a conjecture) is, because they reject all permanent Crosses in Gods
service, which do more resemble a Banner or Ensign than a transient Cross. 4.
I have done my best to sound the depth and strength of your argument, and if I
be not deceived, thus it stands: The omission of a Banner or Ensign, in our
spiritual warfare, that was used by the Primitive Christians, is undecent; but
the sign of the Cross in Baptism was thus used by the Primitive Christians,
therefore omission of it is undecent.
By Primitive Christians, I suppose you do not mean the Apostles, or such
Apostolical persons as were guided by an infallible spirit, and then I deny
your Major, and for this my denial I shall give you two reasons.

1. In Christ our great General, the Captain of our salvation, were hidden all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and therefore he knew better what was
decent in his worship, than all Primitive Christians, han all the Fathers and
Councils that ever were in the world; and therefore seeing there is such a deep
silence of the Cross in his word, I shall never think it so highly decent as
you (...), so decent, that the omission of it is undecent. 2. It is, and
always has been (...) over the world, at least in civil and wel-governed
Nations, that in a Militia all should be done by Commission derived from the
General. Manlius put his own Son to death for fighting with an enemy, though he
had the Conquest, because it was (...) order, and L. (...) (...) had, for the
same reason, executed Q. Fabius (...), though he had (...) a great Victory over
the Samnites, but that the (...) (...) of the people of Rome (...) him. But now
our (...) can produce no Commission from our great General, to use any Banner
or Ensign in his worship, but such as he has already (...), his Word,
Sacraments, Discipline, and (...) I shall condemn (...) (...) of any such
Banner or Ensign, as a transgression against his (...) (...). (...) the (...)
of this, I found this your objection both propounded and answered by (...)
(...). Scharp. (...). theol. (...). 2 page 39, 40.
(...). (...) (...) (...) (...) militare, quo (...) (...) distinguantur: At
Christiani omnes sunt (...), Ephesians 6 11. ergo and (...) (...) debent, and per
consequens signum (...).

Resp. (...) illud conseq (...) (...) alia (...), nempe internum signum fidei,
externam (...), and (...) verbi and (...), etc. What he speaks of external
(...) and participation of the Word and Sacraments, will satisfy what you say.

I cannot here pass by a passage in (...) against Duraeus, page 191, 192 in the
Edition of his Works in Fol. Daraeus having cited many Fathers for the
Ceremonies added unto Baptism, Whitaker thus replyeth unto him: (...) vero non
interest quid Clemens, quid Leo, quid Damasus, quid quisquam alius Pontifex ad
Baptismi Sacramentum (...). Christus ecclesiae (...) de (...) ceremoniarum
nugis mandavit, (...) in illis (...), quos in scriptura legimus, baptismis,
ulla harum (...) (...) reperitur. (...) vero putemus (...) ecclesiam (...)
(...) (...), quibus in Baptismo ceremoniis (...) (...), quam Christum (...)
(...)?

Before I proceed further, I shall take notice of the limitation that you have
in the close of sect: 24. of your assertion of undecency in the omission of a
Banner in an Army: It is not so (...), say you, as things dishonest, or
breaches of the Law of Nature; Now if you apply this unto the omission of a
Banner in our spiritual Militia, I thus object against it: The public worship
of God is a chief part of our spiritual warfa e, and the command of decency in
that is, says your Hocker, an edict or Law of Nature, and whatsoever is
therein undecent transgresses against this Law: If the omission then there in
of a Banner or Ensign of humane invention (for of such only you speak) be
undecent, it is so undecent as things dishonest, or breaches of the Law of
Nature are undecent.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 25, 26, 27, 28.
And the Cross on which (...) was crucified, the Emblem also of that (...)
that every Christian enters into, a constant, courageous patience for all
afflictions, was by the Primitive Christians thus used, as their Symbol or
Ensign, and every man that is enrolled in the Christian Militia, is by him
that inrolles him, signed with it; and this practice being thus founded, and
revived in the Church, Saint Augustines words are worth remembering, and cannot
be denied to have truth in them: Signum crucis nifi adhibeatur, sive (...)
credentium, sive ipsi (...) qua regenera (...) etc. nihil rite perficitur:
Unless the sign of the Gross be used either to the foreheads of the believers
(who are baptized) or to the water it self by which we are regenerate, it is
not duly performed. i. e. with such ceremonies as by custom of the Church, the
rule of decency, belong to it; and, crucis signo in front (...) tanquam in
post (...) es, omnesque Christiani signantur (de Catechiz. rud. cap. 20. romans
4. p. 915.) thou must be signed now in the forehead with the sign of the (...),
as the Israelites on their door-posts, and so must all Christians. In the
forehead particularly Tom. 10. p. 289. B.
in front figat, ubi seeds (...), because the seat of shame is there, which we
render, in token that the baptized shall not be ashamed.

26. The usage of this ceremony of signing with the Cross, was, we (...) know,
frequent in the Church (while the gifts of healing continued) in See Aug. de
Civit Dei. l. 2. c. 8.
curing (...), and casting out Devils, to that Athanasius frequently affirms of
it, De Incarnat. Tom. 1. page 84. So page 101. D. (...). And page 102. 6.

27. And then Baptism being the (...) of Devils (the ancient Catechists we
know were called Exorcists) the rescuing of a person from the power of Satan
into Gods Sonship and Family, what can be more proper, or agreeable, or exactly
symbolical, than the use of this in Baptism, according to that of (...). de
Resurr Carn. Caro sig. nature, ut anima muniatur, the flesh or body is signed,
that the soul may be defended or fortified?

28. And if instead of the Ad omnem progressum (...) crucis signaculo. Tertul.

be of the perfect decency of this usage among us?

Jeanes.
Here you heap up many Testimonies of the Fathers for the Sign of the (...),
unto which it is no difficult (...) to add more, but you (...) very well have
spared all this labor; for first, it is not unknown unto you, (...) (...)

Unto this of the Abridgement, and Mr. Hy, let me add what Mr. (...) of the
(...), will tell thy
has observed in the Fathers speeches concerning the Cross, Treat. part. 1.
page 90. Chew a little upon these speech s, it may be they taste how unsavory
the Fathers are, in the matter of the Cross: August. de (...). 181.

The water of salvation is not the water of salvation, unless being

The water is good for no use of future health, without the Preaching of the

then it is (...) to the use of a spiritual washing, and of a saving Cup. As
therefore Moses threw the wood (...) the (...) of (...), and made them sweet,
so the Priest sends the Preaching of the Lords Cross into this (...), and the
water thereof is made sweet unto grace.

By this you may see that (...) allegations out of the Fathers are in vain,
unless you had added a proof of their infallibility, or that they are to be a
rule of our faith in matters of this nature.

2. One Papist is found (says Parker, part 1. page (...)) who (...), the
Fathers meant (...) of the outward sign, but of the thing (...), which is
Christ's death: It is well, that we (...) this (...) from him, that the Fathers
cannot be justified, in case they mean the outward sign, which they mean
undoubtedly, or else our opposites do us great wrong, who object the Fathers
against us in the Outward ceremony of the Cross, etc.

3. Those that are but tolerably versed in the Fathers, cannot but confess,
that they ascribe very strange things unto the sign of the Cross; as that it
is a necessary requisite of Baptism, that it was an (...) against the Devil,
and an instrument of Miracles, a fence or fortification of the soul against all
spiritual adversaries; but these (...), however you may excuse them, yet they
are so gross, as that they are utterly (...) of any just Apology to be made
for them; and this without more ado might (...) for answer unto sect. 25, 26,
27, 28. But I shall farther give you some general exceptions against those
testimonies of the Fathers you allege, and next, say something unto them taken
severally and apart.

My general exceptions shall be six.

The first, the not using of the Cross by Christ and his Apostles, is a
greater prejudice against it, than all the (...) can be given unto it by the
Fathers of after ages; (...) what are Augustine, (...), (...), etc. whom you
(...), in comparison of our blessed Savior: unto them the Spirit was given but
in measure, unto him without measure, Joh. 3. 34. And, it was a (...) of
wisdom and understanding, a spirit of counsel and knowledge, Isa. 11. 12. and
so was able to make (...) and (...) provision for any religious Ceremonies in
his Church that he thought requisite: Why should (...) we (...) our selves with
those few that he has ordained? (...) (...) no mortal men can produce a patent
from him for the (...) of any other: and why should we think the omission of
the Cross in Baptism undecent? seeing it was omitted by Christ himself and his
Apostles; for that it was (...) by them, is confessed by a learned Conformist,
Dr. Fulk, in answer unto the (...), page 252. Neither was the sign of the
Cross, says he, in any estimation with the Apostles, or the faithful in their
time. (...) indeed, (...) signing with the Cross to be an old Tradition, which
yet is no more certain to have been used by the Apostles, than other like
Ceremonies which he there (...), as the (...) of Milk and Honey by them that
were baptized, and the abstinence from washing for a week after baptism, (...)
for birth days, and such other, (...) since abolished, which they should not
have been, if they had been ordained by the Apostles as necessary for Christian
Religion. As a man runs to the Fountain, says Cyprian, when the channels
are defiled, so must we repair to the practice of the (...) Church, which is
the Fountain of all piety: non est attendendum (says he) quid aliquis ante nos
(...) putaverit, sed quid, qui ante omnes est, Christus fecerit, and faciendum
praeceperit. Agreeable hereunto is that which Mr. Parker part. 1. page 100.
quotes out of Sadeel against the Monks of Bordeaux. When the Monks of Bordeaux
affirm the signs which are added to Baptism, are an ornament to it, we thus
reply: Are they wiser than Christ Jesus, who has ordained his Sacrament in so
great purity and simplicity, and who knows better than all the men in the
world, what ornament was fittest for it? If it be but the covenant of a man,
when it is confirmed, no man abrogateth it, or adds any thing to it: What
arrogance is it then to add to the institution of Christ?

A second exception of the Non-conformists against the Testimonies of the
Fathers for the sign of the Cross, is, that they do not contribute so much
honor thereunto, as the suspected infamous birth and original of it does
discredit: In all probabilities, say they, that Devilish Heretic, Valentinus,
was the first Author and Father of it, the first that advanced it unto any
religious use; and this they prove out of (...). Parker part. 1. page (...)
(...), that it (...) by the Text of (...), that (...) did use the figure of the
(...), (...) express one of his (...) by; and as (...) was the Father of it,
so (...), say they, was the Nurse of it. (...). (...), as I told you, was a
Conformitant (...), and no enemy unto the sign of the Cross, so he prosesseth
of himself in his confutation of the (...) page 87. As (...) the sign of the
Cross, so it be (...) superstition, we can abide well (...). And yet this man
page 252. tells us, that Valentinus the (...) (...) (...) (...) that made any
great account of it; and (...) for it too (...), as well as the Non-conformists.

A third exception against the pretended antiquity of the Cross, and the
Testimonies of the Fathers in that behalf, is, that diverse Ceremonies (...) wi
h the Cross are not urged, but abolished, and yet they were (...) prostituted
(...) such superstitions and (...) abuses as the Cross has been: And
therefore why should the Cross be such a (...), as to be (...)? This exception
you may see thus managed by (...), part. 1. page 39. If our Opposites must

Cross has been, nor now import so much peril as the Cross bring eth with
it, may give wise men cause to wonder, why (...) should (...) buried in a tomb

A fourth exception against the ancient use of the Cross by the Fathers, is
that it is over-ballanced by the Papists abuse of it unto (...): The Brazen
Serpent was ordained by God, and yet when it was abused unto Idolatry, (...)
did well to break it in pieces, 2 King. 18. 4. And therefore the Cross being a
humane invention altogether unnecessary in Gods worship, is for the (...) abuse
of it rightly abolished. The force of this consequence may be gathered from
what two English Bishops say.

1. From what Bishop (...) has from a translation of a passage out of the
Canon Law, Def: of Mr. Perkins part. 1. page 168. (...) our (...) (...) done
some things, which at that time might be without (...), and (...) be (...) to
error, and superstition, we are (...) (says the Law) by (...) breaking the
Brazen Serpent, that the Posterity may abolish the same (...) any delay, and
with great authority. The very same (...) are (...) in the like manner by Dr.
John (...) in his (...) with (...), page 510. As also by (...) in his
Ecclesiastical (...), page 347.

2. From what Jewel (...) for the abolition of (...), because of their
Adoration, (...) to (...) (...) 14. page 383. The best remedy in this behalf,
and most (...) with Gods Word, is utterly to abolish the cause of the ill. So
the godly King (...) took down, and (...) in pe ces the Brazen Serpent;
notwithstanding (...) (...) by (...) (...) commandment had (...) (...);
notwithstanding it were an (...) figure of Christ hanging upon the Cross;
notwithstanding it had (...) so many years; notwithstanding God by it had
wrought so many (...). So the (...) Bishop (...) (...) in sunder the Image of
Christ painted in a cloth; and said, It was against Gods commandment (...)
thing (...) and (...) for the Church, and people of God; notwithstanding it
were the (...) of Christ. So the godly Emperor (...) made his (...) over all
his Dominions in this sort; Signum Servatoris (...), (...) (...) reperietur,
(...) (...): We (...) command, that the (...) of our Savior be taken down, in
what place soever it shall be found: notwithstanding it were the (...) (...) our
Savior. So it is decreed in the late Council of (...) that, when Images happen
to be (...) by the people, they be either notably (...), or (...) abolished.

Unto these two I shall add the testimony of (...), De Civitate Dei (...) 10.
(...). 8. (...) (...) Serpentem (...) (...) (...) (...) cum (...) (...) (...)
Idolum (...) (...), (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...), cum (...) (...) (...)
(...). Suppose then, though not grant, that the Ancients lawfully and laudably
used the sign of the (...), as a (...) sign of Christ's death, and a monitory
sign of their duty, yet seeing it has been made by the Papists such an (...)
Idol, there is very good reason for the utter (...) it out of Gods worship.

A fifth exception is, that our Cross is not the Fathers Cross, who never
annexed any word unto it, and therefore ours is the more Sacramental; for this
see Ames in his Reply to (...) particular Def page 27, As also Mr. Parker part.
1. page 114.

My sixth exception I shall give you in the words of Mr. Parker, part. 1. page
133. What though the custom of the Fathers, who used the Cross for a sign of
Christ, were on all sides good, the times do differ. They lived in an age when
it was despised; we in a time when it is adored. (...) in a time when it
professed the Faith; we in a time when it is common to Papists. They in a time
when it was used over all the Church for the sign of Christianity; we in an
age, when out of our own Church it is no where used but for a (...) of
Antichristianity. In regard whereof we may well appeal to the old Canons,
Regulae Patrum (...) sunt ((...) Gregory) prout res (...) videbatur, (...),
loci personarum, reique (...) habita (...). And Leo, (...) (...) sunt, quae
nulla possunt ratione convelli, (...) multa sunt, quae pro (...) temporum, ac
confideratione (...) (...) (...).

But I shall proceed to the examination of your testimonies apart.

Dr. Hammond.
Saint Augustines words are worth remembering, and cannot be denied to have
(...) in them In (...). (...). (...).
Signum crucis (...) adhibeatur, sive frontibus credentium, sive ipsi aquae qua
(...), etc. nihil (...) (...); (...) the sign of the Cross be used either to
the foreheads of the (...) (who are (...)) or to the water it self by which we
are regenerate, it is not duly performed, i. e. with such ceremonies as by
custom (...) (...) Church, the (...) of (...), belong to it.

Jeanes.
Saint Augustins words at large are as follows, Quod signum nisi (...), five
(...) (...), (...) ipsi aquae qua (...), sive (...) quo Chrismate unguntur,
sive sacrificio (...) aluntur, (...) eorum (...) (...). Saint (...) here you
see approves of the Chrism, and os the crossing of the Oil therein, and sets
it check by (...) wi h the water in (...) and the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper; now your (...) do hope that you do not concur with him herein; and
if you do not, why do you urge us with the authority of his Testimony?

2. If you apply Saint Augustines words to our times, and aver, that they
cannot be denied to have (...) in them, (...) your opinion is, that unless the
(...) of the Cross be used to the water in Baptism, and to the Elements in the
Lords Supper, (...) (...) are not duly performed with such ceremonies, as by
custom of the Church, the rule of decency, belong unto them; and then what
Apology can you make for the Church of (...), that never since the Resormation
used any of these Crossings.

3. Suppose (...) in Augustines time had been administered without Crossing of
either the forehead of the Baptized, or the water wherewith they were baptized,
it had then indeed been performed not with such (...) as by the Custom of the
then Church belonged (...) it: and so Fulk, in his (...) of the Rhemists,
expounds Augustines (...), page 693, but this (...) nothing against us; for
we hold that such Baptism has been (...), that is, duly, lawfully, and
laudably administered, because it would have been agreeable unto Christ's
institution, which alone, and not the custom of the Church, is the rule of its
administration,

4. These words of Augustine are at best, but propositio male sonans; for they
(...) a palpable appearance of evil, because they plainly seem to assert the
necessity of the Sign of the Cross unto Baptism and the Lords Supper.
Bellarmine brings them to prove, that nothing can be consecrated without the
sign of the Cross, de Sacra (...). lib. 2. c. 13 as also to justify their
Crossings, (...) they use in the (...), de Missa, lib. 3. c. 13. And there is a
Popish Ballad mentioned by the Abridgement, and transcribed in Parker, wherein
I believe this is one of the places in Augustine, related unto, part. 1 p. 92.

Without the Cross Saint Augustinesaith,
(Read him and (...) may see)
1. No man is steadfast in the Faith,
Nor Christened well may (...).
No Sacrifice, no holy Oil,
No washing in the Font,
2. Nor any thing can thee (...),
If thou the Cross do want.
Children by it have Christendom,
The water's blessed also:
3. The Holy Ghost appears to some,
(...) gifts of Grace bestow,
When that this Cross is made (...),
Of them (...) hallowed be:
4. Where it is not, there wants might,
For ought that I can see.
But the very Canons of the Convocation doc disclaim all necessity of the sign
of the Cross in Baptism, The Church of England, since the abolishing of
Popery, has ever held and taught, and teaches still, that the sign of the
Cross used in Baptism is no part of the substance of that Sacrament; for when
the Minister, dipping the Infant in water, or laying water upon the face of it
(as the manner also is) has pronounced these words ( I baptize thee in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost) the Infant is fully
baptized; so as the sign of the Cross being afterward used, does neither add
any thing to the virtue, or (...) of Baptism; nor being omitted, does detract
any thing from the effect and substance of it.

Dr. Hammond.
And, Crucis signo in front hodie tanquam in post signandus es, omnesque
Christiani signantur (de Catechiz. rud. c. 20. tom. 4. page 915.) thou must be
signed now in the forehead with the sign of the Cross, as the Israelites on
their door posts, and so must all Christians.

Jeanes.
Whereas you say above, that Augustines words cannot be denied to have truth in
them, you mean these last quoted, as well as the former; and if this be so,
then it will be an easy matter for you to clear up by argument this undeniable
truth that is in them. God commanded the Israelites to strike the lintel and
the two side posts of the door with the blood of the Passover; therefore all
Christians are obliged to be signed in the forehead with the sign of the
Cross, sounds with me as a very wild and loose inference; and therefore I
shall entreat you to confirm it, or else relinquish this place of Augustine, as
containing nothing of an argument in it.

Bellarmine alleges this place of Augustine to prove that the blood of the
Lamb sprinkled upon the posts of the doors was a figure of the sign of the
Cross: Tom. 2. (...) Eccles: triumph: lib. 2. c. 29. And unto him Chamier thus
answers; Tom. 2. page 8: 8, 879. Nego crucem significatam in (...) Testamento;
nisi per accidens: hoc est, quatenus Christus significatus est crucifigendus.
Sed crucem direct ac per se significatam ullis figuris, nego. Nec ignoro tamen
produci posse in contrarium testimonia quaedam ex Patribus. Sed ego quicquid
Patribus in buccam venit, non censco amplect endum, ut verbum Dei. Potest,
inquiebat Augustinus in Psalmum trigesimum sextum, nihil aliquid videri, alteri
aliud: sed neque ego, quod dixero, praescribo alteri ad meliorem intellectum,
nec ille mihi. Idem de reliquis dicendum. Itaque liceat in earum sententias
inquirere. Certe illud de sanguine agni (...) super utroque post, (...) est a

quando non solum ore corporis; sed etiam ore cordis hauritur. Gretserus
excipit; posse (...) idemque plura significare. Ita sane, inquam; sed primo
variis rationibus. Itaque eadem ratione qua significat sanguinem, non potest

Dr. Hammond.
In the forehead particularly Tom. 10. p. 289. B.
in front sigat ubi seeds pudoris) because the seat of shame is there, which
we render, in token that the baptized shall not be ashamed.

Jeanes.
This weighs little or nothing, unless withal you can prove, that the
Apostles command of decency enjoyneth, that the seat of shame in the baptized
should be marked with the sign of the Cross, in token that he should not be
ashamed. Doubtless Saint Paul's practice was suitable unto his precept, and you
do not, you cannot pretend, that ever he was signed in the (...) with the
sign of the Cross, either by himself or any other: he (...) his example for
imitation, and gives this for a reason, that his pattern was that of our
blessed Savior, 1 Cor. 11. 1. Be ye even followers of me, as I also am of
Christ. We shall not then think that so requisite unto Baptism which he never
used; so so long as we follow so great a (...), we shall not be much (...),
though we swarve from the advice of Augustine, that has no warrant from the
Word of God. Paul makes large professions, that he was not ashamed of the
Gospel, which held forth a crucified Christ, Romans 1. 16. Phil. 1. 20. (...) Tim
1. 12. But no man can say that he ever expressed this his profession by the
sign of the Cross; and therefore we shall make no other account of the Sign
of the Cross, than as of a supernumerarie in Gods service; and those Believers
that want it, may have confidence when Christ shall appear, and not be ashamed
before him at his coming, 1 John 2. 28.

But perhaps you think we must stoop unto the bare words of Augustine, though
not seconded with any reason; and this is more then Augustine himself would
have expected from us: for after this manner the holy Scriptures alone are to
be entertained, as Bishop Jewel proves against Harding, Def. Apol. Chur.
Englpart. 1. p. 55. out of several places of Sr. August. Therefore St. Aug.
says, Alios Scriptores ita lego, ut quanta libet sanctitate doctrinaque
praepolleant, non ideo verum putem, quod ipsi ita senserint, sed quod id mihi,
vel per alios Authors Canonicos, vel probabili ratione persuadere potuerint.
Other Writers or Fathers (besides the holy Scriptures) I read in this sort,
that be their learning and holiness never so great, I will not think it true,
because they have thought so, but because they are (...) to persuade me so,
either by other Canonical Writers, or else by some likely reason. Likewise
again he says, Hoc genus literarum non cum credendi necessitate sed cum
judicandi liberate, legendum est: This kind of Writings (of the holy Doctors
and Fathers) must be read, not with necessity to believe each thing, but with
liberty to judge each thing.

the Council of Nice against you, nor shall you allege the Council of Ariminum

cause with cause, reason with reason.

Jeanes.
Bishop Morton in his particular Defense of the Ceremony of the Cross, page
231, 232. tells us, That our Church does not ascribe unto it any (...) power of
driving out devils, or of curing diseases, etc. And what he says of our Church
he speaks by just consequence of the Primitive Church; For our Church ((...)
he, ibid.) professes, that she uses it only as primitively it was used; that
is, only as a token whereby there is protestation made of a future constancy
in the profession of Christianity: If it were used only thus, then it was not
used for the miraculous cure of diseases, and chasing away of Devils; and this
will be denied by none, that knows the force of the (...) (...) only; but you
have a higher opinion of the efficacy of the sign of the Cross, than ever
(...) Morton had, or the (...) of England, as he thought; and therefore I shall
address my self to give (...) answer unto your miracles of the Cross.

1. I shall in general say unto them three things.

1. If (...) were any such Miracles, as are pretended, they were wrought only
at the sign of the Cross, and not by the (...) of the Cross (as you bring in
(...) affirming) so much as by a Moral instrument they were done for the sike
only of the (...) and prayers of those that used the sign of the Cross, and
were consequent unto the sign of the (...), only (...) accidens; and for this
that I say, Bishop Morton alleges a saying out of Pe kins: (...) (...) ((...)
he) that miracles were done of God at the sign of the Cross, that (...) (...)
unto it a manifest, or at least a secret (...) of the name of (...) crucified:
so that the virtue was not to be imputed unto the sign of the Cross, but unto
the (...) of the (...), and invocation of Christ. 2. Many Miracles were (...)
by the Brazen Serpent; (...) it came to pass, that if a Serpent had bitten any
man, when he beheld the Serpent of Brosse, he lived, Numb. 21. 9. Yet
Ilezechias brake it in pieces, 2 King. 18. 4. and the reason is assigned why he
did so; for unto those days the children of Israel did (...) incense to it.
This fact of Hezechias is praise worthy; and therefore it was no evil act to
throw aside the sign of the Cross: for suppose, though not grant, (...)
Miracles were wrought by it, yet the Papists have burnt incense unto it: sor
(...) Dr. Rainolds in his Conference with Heart, page 509, 510. It is written in
(...) Masse-book, that in solemn Masses, the (...) having made obeisance to
(...) Cross, does incense it thrice: The Jews gave Exodus 30. 8.
the honor of God to (...) (...), in that they (...) incense to it. And
therefore (...) did (...) it brazen stuff; as if you should call your Roode
(...) stuff; your Agnus (...) Dei's (...) stuff, your Crucisixes and Crosses
(...) of Copper, Copper-stuff, because you impart the honor of God to them, by
(...) (...) (...) hope in them. And if (...). 5 5.
the (...) man be called an Idolater, (...) he makes (...) his God, not as
though he thought the (...) be God, but because he (...) to live and prosper
by it, Jer. 17 (...).
which (...) and (...) he should (...) in God only: then worship you the sign
of the (...) (...) an Idol, (...) you trust to be saved by it, as in your
(...). Roman: (...). qua to. (...)
Church (...) you (...) notoriously, and Thom. (...). Sum. (...). (...). 3.
(...). 25. (...). 4. Andrad (...) (...). Explicat. (...) 9.
so your selves (...), you worship it as God; wherefore it 2 Kings 18 3. 5.
(...) be praised by God for breaking in pieces the (...) of brass, because
the children of (...) did burn (...) to it, we who have re moved the sign of
the Cross, because you put the hope of (...) in it, (...) content (...) (...)
be dispraised by men. But if you say (...), (...) we be against the (...)
Fathers in Religion, because we pluck down that (...) they did set up, (...)
heed (...) your speech (...) not touch the Holy (...), who says that (...)
ver. 6.
did keep Gods commandments which he (...) Moses; and yet with (...) says,
that ver. 4.
he brake in (...) the (...) of brass which Moses had made. 3. A third answer
shall be that which (...) (...) concerning (...) (...) which the (...) allege
were done by the use of (...) (...) and the sign of the (...): In all which,
and the (...) Miracles ((...) he, page (...)) not to overthrow (...) (...); we
yet (...) answer, that (...) (...) success that (...) means had, prove no more
the lawfulness os them, than (...) (...) of living men amongst the Gentiles
unto their Idols, accompanied with some desired issue out of their troubles
wherein they were, prove the lawfulness of that horrible and most detestable
worship of their God. 4. That the former use of the sign of the Cross in
Miracles, obliges not to a use of it (now all miraculous use thereof is by the
general (...) of Protestants ceased) may be (...), in a way of Analogy and
proportion from what the above mentioned Bishop (...) speaks, page 58. of (...)
and Oil: We confess that spittle was used by our Savior Christ, in healing of
the cumb; and cyle by the Apostles, in curing of many other diseases; yet both
(...): but to imitate the work of a Miracle without the miraculous power, is
but an opish (...), for to hold such a miraculous ceremony, after the virtue be
gone, is but to preserve a carcass, because it had been once possessed of a
soul.
From this general Answer proceed we to some particulars of the Crosses
efficacy.

1. You say that the usage of this Ceremony of signing with the Cross, was we
also know, frequent in the Church (while the gifts of healing continued) in
curing diseases. But now for this (...) you only quote in the Margin Aug. de
Civ. Dei, lib. 22. cap. 8. And in that place there is but one instance of any
cure wrought upon the usage of the sign of the Cross, and that in Innocentia,
a Carthaginian Matron, and the story hereof I shall give unto the Reader, as it
lies in the Book and Chapter quoted.

In eadem Carthagine, Innocentia religiosissima faemina de primariis ipsius
civitatis, in (...) cancrum habebat, rem, (...) (...) dicunt, nullis
medicamentis (...). Aut ergo praescidi solet, and a corpore separari membrum
ubi nascitur, aut, ut aliquanto homo quietius vivat fomentis est pestis (...)
frequentibus. Nam ut inde mortem quantumlibet tardius (...) confidamus,
secundum Hippocratis, ut fertur, sententiam, omnis est omittenda curatio. (...)
illa a perito medico, and suae domui familiarissimo acceperat, and ad (...)
Deum se orando converterat. Admonetur in somnis appropinquante pascha, ut in
part faeminarum (...) ad baptisterium, (...) illi (...) primitus occurrisset,
signaret ei locum signo crucis Christi, fecit, and confestim sanitas secuta
est.

In the same Town one Innocentia a most religious woman, and one of the
principal in the City, had a Canker on her breast, a kind of sore which the
Physicians told her is utterly uncurable: wherefore they use either to cut the
infected part away, or for the prolonging of the life a little while in some
ease, the malady is to be assuaged and mitigated with frequent plasters; for
the opinion of Hippocrates will induce us to believe, that death will thence
ensue, though somewhat slowly: (...) he, as they say, does advise to omit all
attempt of curing it; this a (...) Physician her familiar friend told her; so
that now she sought help of none but the Lord, who told her in a dream, that
(...) next, which then drew near, she should mark on the (...) side by the
Font, what woman she was, that, being then (...), should first meet her, and
that she should (...) her to sign her sore with the sign of the Cross of
Christ: She did it, and was cured.

But the Miracles related in this Chapter are of a (...) credit, it (...) unto
Ludovicus Viues to be a matter without doubt, that many things in this Chapter
were added, etc. by those, who with their filthy hands have defiled all the
Writings of great and famous Authors: In hoc capite non dubium, quin multa sint
addita, (...) declarandi gratia, ab iis, qui omnia magnorum autorum scripta
spurcis suis (...) contaminabant, etc. Of this annotation of Ludovieus Vives
Rivet speaks thus, Critic. sacr. page 453. Lud. Viv ad cap. 8. lib. 22. In
(...) miracula multa narrantur, quae omnia non (...) exactam judicii (...),
quam in aliis August, operibus lectores sagaces observant, annotat, in hoc
capite non dubium, (...) multa sint addita, velut declarandi gratia, ab iis,
qui omnia magnorum autorum (...) (...) suis manibus (...): Huic (...) non (...)
censores Belgici in indice (...): neque Hispani inquisitores in suo: quod ideo
notandum lectori, ne semper quae ex genuin is autorum libris asseruntur,
genuina esse putet, quod per Monachorum corruptelas non licet. (...) igitur
(...) opus est sagacitate, and judicii libra. Chamier in reference to another
passage in the Notes of Lud: Viv. passes this censure upon other miracles,
alleged by Papists from that place of Augustine to justify their Invocation
of Saints, de Vigesim: Octav. lib. de Civit. Dei: Possum ex Vive dicere, (...)
in (...) Iusisse sciolorum lasciviam, aut potius (...) audaciam: the Divines of
Rhemes in their Annotations on (...) 14. 12. charge Protestants, that they
discredit, as other Miracles, so in particular, those testified by St.
Augustine in this place; and unto this charge neither Fulk nor Cartwright
entered any dissent, and therefore it is probable that they acknowledged it:
whereas Fisher in his Answer to the Questions propounded by King James, goes
about to justify the Oblations made to Saints by some of the Miracles here
recorded, said to be done at their Tombs and Shrines, Dr. Francis White seems
to think that a doubt of the truth of some of these Miracles is defensible,
because, says he, these things were extraordinary; and the credit of diverse of
them depends upon fame (which is many times uncertain) Tertul. Apol. (...).
7. cur malum sama? Quia velox, an quia plurimum mendax? quae (...) (...) quidem
cum very aliquid adfert sine mendacii vitio est (...), adjiciens, (...) de
veritate.
and Saint Augustine himself says, they are not commended unto us by such
weighty authority, as that without all doubt they must needs be credited Aug.
de civit. Dei lib. 22. cap. 8. non tanta ea commendat authoritas, ut sine
difficultate vel dubitatione credantur.
they cannot be sufficient (...) or foundations of Catholic Doctrine or
Practice.

2. You say that by the sign of the Cross all Magic and Witchcrast is brought
to naught.

1. Surely, Sir, if ever the sign of the Cross had such an influence, it is
questionable, whether there was ever any word or promise of the Lord for it,
and without such word or promise, to use the sign of the Cross for such a
purpose, was virtual and interpretative Witchcraft.

Besides 2. if it were so efficacious against Magic and Witchcraft in the
Primitive times, yet, that since it has been abused unto Magic and
Witchcraft, is confessed by (...) Abbot, a man of great (...) and learning,
part. 1. page 169. But (...) the Harpie of Rome has had the handling of it,
and made it a matter of Magical Enchantment, and through the current of (...)
prophanations, it has (...) into the hands of Conjurers, Charmers, Witches, to
be (...) with their (...) and (...) practices, we have had a religious care to
clear the first Church in the using of it; but no further to use it our selves
than it may be washed from the soil and filth of these abominations.

3. By what you say in the Margin out of Athanasius and Augustine, you (...) a
great efficacy of the sign of the Cross in the routing and chasing away of
Devils: unto this I answer:

1. That the whole Armor of God, the complete harness of the Spirit, deterres
not Satan from assailing the best and most perfect of Christians: Christ's
unspotted innocence, and his absolute all-sulnesse of Grace, was temptation
proof, and yet the Devil adventured upon the (...) of him, and therefore it is
very strange that he should be so perillously, and terribly afraid of so weak
a shield as the sign of the Cross in the forehead: No, no, says Fulk, in
answer to the Rhemists, page, 69. 4. the Devil is too craf y and strong to yield
to so weak a weapon, but when he is disposed to play with men, that they may
more easily be seduced by him.

2. It is but a sorry Sophisme, to conclude the Devils terror at the sign of
the Cross, from his running away upon (...) se thereof; for this might be done
out of design to get ground upon men, to return upon them with the more
advantage: It might be like the flight of an Enemy to draw into an Ambuscado,
(...) the superstition of the Cross, that has since so (...). It is to be
feared therefore, that that which the Pharisees blasphemously spoke of Christ,
may truly be objected unto the sign of the Cross, that it (...) (...) out
Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils. Hear what (...) says of the
Devils fear (...) the sign of the Cross, Tom. 1. page (...). Hoc omnium
interim memoriis infixum esse debet, Daemonem esse callidum, versutum,

3. Some excuse the Fathers, as if they held, that the sign of the Cross
drived away Devils ex opere operantis, only by the says and prayers of those
that used it; but others think, that they held it to be done ex opere operato,
by the Ordinance of God; and they give this reason, because they held it to be
done by aliens and unbeleevers, by Pagans and Jews, who had not the Christian
Faith. Nazianzene relates, how that Julian the Apostate being about some feats
of Necromancy, the Devils that he had conjured ran all away, when he by
chance had made the sign of the Cross, without any purpose or thought of a
Miracle; for he marvelled at the matter, as that which was more than he
expected: And (...) reports that a Jew, as yet (...) unto the Faith of Christ,
being benighted, and taking up his lodging in a Temple of (...), routed a great
multitude, or Troup of Devils that were there assembled, by signing his (...)

prohibet (...) modis, cum id justum (...) utile iudicat; nam nullo modo ulli
spiritus audent haec signa contemnere: (...) hec, (...) illa (...). By this you
may see, how far the Fathers (...) in their opinion touching the efficacy of
the Cross, and I am so charitable as (...) (...) you do not come up unto them
herein, and if you do not, you have no reason to press me with their sayings.

3. You say out of Athanafius, that by the sign of the Cross, all the Idol
Temples were laid waste and empty: I could wish that you had exemplified this
by some instances, that we might have considered of what weight they had been:
The Papists of the Seminary of Rhemes have referred us unto a famous story in
Theodoret, which says Fulk, page 694. is a Miracle wrought by Marcellus Bishop
of (...) in setting the Temple of Jupiter a fire, with sprinkling of water,
after he had signed it with the (...), and prayed, when it would not burn with
fire: This is a pretty story, if true, and will serve aptly for your purpose:
But, Sir, we shall hope for so much charity from you, that you will (...)
brand for Infidels, all, that have not faith strong enough to swallow these
Miracles of the Cross. Theodoret might have this at the second hand, and he
himself might be deceived, though he were unwilling to deceive, and in all ages
devout and well meaning persons have been over-credulous in entertaining (...)
it and fained Miracles.

As for the places quoted out of Augustine, I cannot find them in Frobenius his
Edition of Augustine, and I have no other, and therefore I think you follow
some other Edition; but the thing is not material; for I hope, that what I have
said already will be a satisfactory answer unto them.

Jeanes.
Your ordinary Readers will think you Conjure, when they hear you term
Baptism an exorcising of Devils; for they never heard of any Exorcisne in
Baptism, save of the Papists, which our Divines brand for Magical; and whether
this expression might not have been forborne to avoid all appearance of evil,
in compliance with Papists in their use of (...), I shall (...) determine, but
leave it unto your own prudence to think of. Whereas you say, that the ancient
(...) were called Exorcists, the reason of this may probably be, because the
Catechumeni were exorcised before Baptism, Aquin. Sum. part. 3. quaest. 71.
artic. 2. But I shall not contend about this with you, for fear I should be
thought as very a fool as the Philosopher, who read a Lecture of War before
Hannihal. There is a passage in Augustine that seems to (...) somewhat what
you (...). Tom 7 page (...). Ab hac igitur (...) tenebrarum, quarum est
Diabolus princeps, id est, a (...) Diaboli, and angelorum ejus quisquis erui,
cum baptizantur, negaverit parvulos, ipsorum ecclefiae sacramentorum veritate
convincitur, etc. In veritate itaque non in salsitate potestas diabolica
exorcizatur in parvulis, eique renunciant, quia (...) sua non possunt, per
(...) and (...) gestantium, ut eruti a potestate (...) in regnum sui Domini
transferantur. Unto this testimony I believe it is easy for you to add many
more.

But yet notwithstanding all this, it is very well known, by all that know the
difference (...) the Predicaments, that the Sacrament of Baptism cannot be
said to be the Exorcising of Devils, the rescuing of a person from the power of
Satan, the delivery of him from the (...), otherwise than in an improper,
tropicall, and metonymicall praedication, viz. as it is a sign and seal, and if
you will, a moral instrument of the conditional promise thereof.

But what advantage reap you unto your cause by this? why unto this Exorcising
of Devils, the rescuing a person from the power of Satan into Gods family, the
use of the Cross in Baptism is exactly symbolical? Your argument (if there be
any argument in your words) as I conceive, stands thus: That which is so
exactly symbolical unto any thing signed, sealed, conveyed, and exhibited in
Baptism, is so decent, as that the omission thereof would be undecent: but the
use of the Cross in Baptism is exactly symbolical unto that which is signed,
sealed, and conveyed, or exhibited in Baptism, viz. the Exorcising of
Devils, the rescuing a person from the power of (...) into Gods Sonship and
Family, therefore the use of it is so decent, as that the omission thereof
would be undecent; you cannot but expect that the Major will be denled, and
it is very strange that you leave it destitute of all proof; for you cannot be
ignorant if you have read the Non-conformists, whom you oppose, that their
great quarrel against our Ceremonies, was their symbolicalnesse and mystical
signification; their arguments against which you may read at large in the
Abridgement, page 41, 42, etc. usque (...) 49. Ames his Reply to Mortons

of the Cross, part 1. page 97, 98, etc. usque ad 112. Didoclave, page 522,
523, etc. usque ad 536.

But, Sir, you may think to blow off all the Arguments with a silent scorn
and contempt, and this indeed many do with those arguments which they cannot
answer; but if you will not vouchsafe to read these Authors, if you please to
accept of my service, I will abridge the substance of their arguments, and
attend your answer unto them.

Then, for the Minor, I have four things to say unto it.

1. Baptism it self is more proper, agreeable, or exactly Symbolical, unto the
rescuing of a person from the power of Satan into Gods Sonship and Family, than
the sign of the Cross; and therefore the sign of the Cross in Baptism is a
(...) (...), like the dim and smoakie light of a candle in the presence of
the clear and glorious light of the Sun at noonday. 2. The Popish Exorcisme
and (...) are as, if not more, proper, agreeable, and exactly symbolical, unto
the Exorcising of Devils as the use of the Cross in Baptism, and they have
not been so much abused as it, and may as (...) be purged from all Superstition
and Idolatry, and therefore you may as well conclude concerning them as the
Cross, that they are so decent as that the omission of them would be undecent.
3. I much question whether or no two cross motions of a finger or a thumb
(...) so proper, agreeable, and exactly symbolical, unto so high, dreadful and
profound a mystery, as the delivery of us from the power of Satan and
darkness, and the translation of us into the kingdom of the dear Son of God,
as you affirm; and I shall hardly believe you, unless you bring other proofs,
besides the Hyperbolies of the Fathers.
As for that which in confirmation of the Minor, you quote out of Tertullian:

1. It is urged by some, not only for the signification, but also for the
operation and efficacy of the Cross, and whether you will go so far I cannot
tell.

2. Unto it Mr. Whitaker, when urged by Papists for Traditions, gives this
answer, Tom. 1. page 390. At anima fide contra Satanam munienda est, non cruce.
Veteres quidem se (...) signo adversus Daemonas munitos esse putarunt, sed hoc
ex haeresi (...) fluxit.

And (...) him Mr. Fuller in his History of the University of Cambridge page
125, gives this (...) character; He was one so exactly qualified, that the
Professors Chair may seem made for him, and he for it, they mutually so fitted
each other.

3. I would (...) to know, how you like the companion of the Cross in
Tertullian, the holy oil? caro ungitur, says he, in the words immediately
foregoing, ut anima (...): but perhaps you are for the reviving of that, as
well as for the using of the Cross; and some (...) not to say, that it is as
ancient as the Cross.

One thing more I cannot but remember you of, before I leave this Section, and
it is a distinction of mystical signification by the learned and reverend
(...), the word mystical signification has two acceptions, says he, General
Def. page 52. The one Sacramental, by signification of grace (...) by God; the
other is only Moral, by signification of man's duty and obedience toward God.
The ceremonies which we defend (says he) are only mystical Moral, not
Sacramental; and for his disclaiming these, he gives this reason, page 53, 54.
A sacramental sign (being, as sacramental, so likewise (...), a seal of Gods
promises, as the Apostle Romans 4.
(...) Circumcision) is always founded upon the express Covenant of God,
therefore none but the Author of the Covenant may institute or appoint any such
sign. For whosoever shall undertake to add a seal unto the Will and Covenant
of any Testator amongst men, is farthwith held Falsarius, and thereby made
obnoxious to the Law, and liable to the grievous judgments of man: How much
more (...) an Act were it for any to offix any sign, properly Sacramental, unto
the Testament of our Lord Jesus? which whosoever shall attempt to do, becomes
guilty of sacrilegious depravation of the blessed Mysteries of Salvation.

Now you make the sign of the Cross to be that which Morton calls a
Sacramental sign; for he describes a Sacramental sign to be that which
signifies Grace conferred by God: and is not the rescuing of a person from the
power of Satan into Gods Sonship and Family (as for your other expression:
Baptism is the Exorcising of Devils, I am not much delighted with the
repetition of it) a grace conferred by God? and unto this you say the sign of
the Cross is exactly Symbolicall, and therefore a Sacramental sign.

And if instead of the Ad omnem progressum frontem crucis signaculo (...).

confidence that (...) that thus signed to Constantine Victory from heaven
((...), in this overcome) will thus give grace, and seal to us victory over our
(...) enemies. What question can there ever be of the perfect decency of this
usage among us?

Jeanes.
Here the argument to prove the perfect decency of the usage of the sign of
the Cross in Baptism, is the frequent religious use of it amongst the
ancients; I say the religious use, because we oppose not the civil use of it in
Coins and Banners. But

1. You know, it is generally denied by the Non-consormists, that the (...) use
of the Cross amongst the Ancients was lawful and justifiable, and until this
be cleared, your argument will bec little better than (...) principii. 2.
Bellarmine uses the like argument, de Missa lib. 2. cap. 15. for their
crossings in the Mass, having quoted diverse Fathers for the antiquity of the
sign of the Cross, who teach that it is to be used in every business: he
propounds hereupon an interrogation, very like unto that of yours: Quod (...)
in omni negotio signum crucis adhibendum, cur non in action tremendi
sacrificii? But this perhaps startles you not. 3. I demand whether the use of
the Cross amongst the Ancients was decent or undecent? If it was decent, then
why was it abrogated? If it was undecent, then how can you infer therefrom, the
perfect decency of the use of the Cross in Baptism?
But though I do not deny the frequent use of the Cross among the Ancients,
yet I have something to observe concerning the witnesses which you allege
therefore.

The first is Tertullian de Cor. Milit. cap. 3.

But this Book was written by him when a Montanist, this is confessed on all
hands, but I shall content my self with the naming only of two Witnesses.

The first is a moderate Conformist, Doctor Whitaker, Tom. 1. page 392.
Respondeo, Tertullianum fuisse Montanistam, quando hunc librum scripsit. Facit
enim (...) novarum prophetiarum, quarum Montanum inventorem fuisse, dubium non
est. Fuit vero Montanus (...) Traditionum author, quae postea extirpari non
poterant. Dixit, se habere illum paracletum, quem promisit Christus; and fretus
(...) paracleti authoritate, multa (...) in Ecclesiam invexit. Impius (...)
Montanus Tertullianum ipsum fefellit, cujus viri jacturam casumque merito
lugere possumus. Illo enim tempore nullus doctior, nullus sanctior, nullus
(...) fidei Christianae defensione vehementior fuit Tertulliano. Sed (...)
(...) Montani omnem Tertulliano fidem detraxit. Sic enim Hilarious ait, in
Comment. in Matthew. Canon. 5. Quanquam and Tertullianus (inquit) hac de re
aptissima volumina scripserit, consequens error (...) detraxit scriptis
probahilibus authoritatem. Hieronymus vero, in lib. (...) Helvidium (...),
(...) Ecclesiae hominem non fuisse. Et in Catal. de (...) idem ait, eum (...)
contra Ecclesiam scripsisse; and revera scripsit. Quae cum ita sint, quam
absurdum est, Montanicas Traditiones Tertulliani (...) nobis obtruderc.

The other is a zealous and rigid pleader for humane religious Ceremonies, Mr.
Hooker in his (...) Polity, page 65. when Tertullian disputed against the
Christian soldiers wearing a Crown or Garland on their heads, when they
receive their (...); He was a Montanist, and an enemy unto the Church, for
condemning that prophetical spirit, which Montanus and his followers did boast
they had received, as if in them Christ had performed his last promise; as if
to then he had sent the Spirit, that should be their perfecter and final
instructor in the mysteries of Christian truth. Which exulceratian of mind made
them apt to take all occasions of contradiction. Wherefore in honor of that
action, and to gall their minds, who did not so much commend it, he wrote his
book De Corona Militis, not dissembling the stomach wherewith he wrote it.

2. The Crossings which Tertullian speaks of, would be a weight cumbersome
enough without any other Ceremony, and this cannot be denied by such
indifferent persons as will read his words at large; for thus they are, Ad
omnem progressum, atque promotum, ad omnem additum, and exitum, ad vestitum, ad
calceatum, ad (...), ad mensas, ad lumina, ad cubicula, ad sedilia,
quandocunque nos conversatio (...), frontem (...) signaculo terimus. Here you
see, that the Crossing in Tertullians time was at every step, at every coming
to and going out, at the apparrelling themselves, at washing, at cating, at
lighting candles, and at sitting etc.

3. The frequent use of the Cross, mentioned by Tertullian at every step, and
in every action that we do, was not, could not be decent, because it could not
but be a great hinderance, disturbance, and distraction unto the more
necessary, and important actions of men's lives, especially seeing you will say,
it was to be accompanied with inward action of the soul suitable thereunto: now
how can that, which is not decent in it self, derive that, which it has not,
unto another: this perpetual Crossing, was so far from being decent, as that
it was ridiculous; and should we now see a man after this manner crossing of
himself, we would think either that he was out of his wits, or else that he was
transported with such delusions of Satan, as the Quakers are now, or the
Montanists were in Tertullians time.

A second witness is Palladius de Historia (...). This Author I suspected to
be fabulous by the two tales related out of him by Bellarmine, de Reliq. and
Imaginib. Sanctorum, cap. 29. and I cannot but wonder that you should allege
him, considering the character that Hierome and Epiphanius give of him; but not
having the Book in my own Study, I sent unto a friend in Oxford, to make some
search after the place, and in a short time this answer was returned unto me.

What authority is to be given to that quotation out of (...) concerning Quest.
Hippolytus, whom he would have to be Apostolorum (...)?

None at all, or very little: For Answ.

Besides this University friend, I consulted another in the Country, who had, I
knew, a well furnished study, and from him I received this following Answer.

Author (...) himself in his Book de Scriptoribus (...) ad (...) 390. confesses

years, and had no other sustenance, but the Sacrament once every Sabbath day.

By this time the Reader is, I hope, sufficiently satisfied, that your Author
Palladius is a Legendary writer, the Gentlemen who have made this search for
me, desire for the present, to have their names concealed, but however they
will be responsible for what they have written, when ever you shall be pleased
to call them to an account.

A third witness is the Author of the Quest. and Resp. ascribed to Justin
Martyr, but this Author is unknown, and the book a forgery, unworthy of Justin
Martyr, and as short of his former writings as Lead is of Gold, this you know a
great deal better then my self, but others may see as much demonstrated by
Rivet. Critic. sacr. lib. a. cap. 5. Out of Possevinus, Sylburgius and (...).

But you have perhaps another argument, hinted toward the conclusion of this
section, and it is the apparition of the sign of the Cross unto Constantine,
of which you speak in those words; he that thus signed to Constantine victory
from Heaven ((...) in this overcome etc.

But it is much questioned, whether or no that which you call the sign of the
Cross, was that which appeared unto Constontine. Bishop Abbot in his answer
unto Dr. Bishop his Epistle unto King James page 167. says, that the sign of
the Cross, unto which Constantine was so much affectioned (and that which he
was so affectionate unto, was that which appeared unto him) was indeed Eusebius.
de vit. Constable. lib. 1 c. 25.
the sign of the name of our Savior, consisting of the two Greek letters ch
and r, and in the form of a (...), which are the two first letters of the name
of Christ, and did import the same whole name, by the fight whereof in the sky
Conflantine was advertised, that Ib. c. 22.
by Christ he must conquer and (...). To which name of Christ, represented to
Constantine, his most excellent majesty gives the same honor that Constantine
did, reposing therein the whole trust of his Victory, and safety, both
spiritual and corporal, and knowing that no Acts 4. 7.
other name is given under heaven, by which we must be saved, but only the name
of Jesus Christ. This opinion (...) embraced by many; but Dr. John Rainolds of
all others, I believe, speaks most fully of it in his conference with Heart,
page 507, 508. The sign that appeared to Constantine in the Element was a sign
of the name of Christ, not his Cross: howsoever the Coiners and Martials
treatise of the Cross art. 2. Harpesfeildes Cope-dialog. 4.
Crosse-maintainers of your Church do falsely paint it out. For as De vit.
Constant. lib. 1. cap. 15,
Eusebius writes, (unto whom Constantine did report the thing, and showed him
that ensign, which he had caused to be made in the likeness thereof) it was the
form of a (1) Spear standing strait upright, with a (2) Crown on the top of
it, and as it were (3) a horn, which (4) did cross the midest of the Spear
aslope. So that it represented two of the Greek letters, ch and r: which being
the two first letters of the name of Christ, the name of Christ was signified
by that sign to Constantine. Thus be describes it who saw it. which words
translated amiss by Interpreters ( erat litero r inserta in (...) literae ch)
have occasioned some to make the sign otherwise then Eusebius describes it.


Unto this Heart thus replyeth, but out of doubt he calls it the sign or the
monument of the Cross also.

And unto this Dr. Rainolds thus rejoyneth. But cap. 25.
himself shows, that he calls it so, because it resembled (...).
the sign of a Cross For neither was it like the Cross fully, which had The
figure of the letter T. Tertull. advers. Marcion. lib. 3. Hieron: lib. 3.

which meaning it seems that Constantine did understand it also: because
Eusebius. de vit. Constable. lib. c. 25.
he used afterward to carry in his Helmet, not the sign of the Cross, but
those two letters by which the name of Christ was represented to him.

But suppose it was the very sign of the Cross, which you imagine appeared
unto Constantine, yet this will make nothing for the perfect (...) of the usage
of the sign of the Cross in Baptism amongst us: and my reason is, because
apparitions in the air, though they be not illusions of Satan, the Prince of
the air, but true and real miracles, do not oblige us unto (...) of the like
in Gods ordinances: strong and powerful motives they are unto the worship of
Christ, but were never designed to be a rule of it, and he that uses it to
such a purpose perverts it from its right end.

Dr. Hammond.
And then for the Surplice: It is no news, I hope, for several sorts of men
to have solemn Garments, for solemn actions which they do not use at other
times. The Judges upon the Bench, or the Lords at their coming to Parliament,
are a sufficient evidence of this, who wear not those Robes in common
occasions, which there they do, as betokening their quality. and the
employments they are about. And then what is thus customary in civil matters
(viz. to difference persons and employments, yea and days, by distinction of
garments) and is allowed to be decent therein, this by analogy undeniable, is
as fitly and decently from thence derived to solemn sacred actions also, such
are the public offices of the Priest: and the commands of our Superiors being
added to this decency of the matter, (...) to (...), it is, I am sure, more
than undecent for inferiors to be obstinate, and deny obedience to them. In the
choice of the garment, there bath been also, as near as may be, a resemblance
observed of those garments, which in Scripture are mentioned for the like
solemnities, long, shining, i. e. white robes or garments. And if the constant
usage of other Churches besides this of ours, Eastern as well as Western, for
so many Centuries together, be considered, it will be competently able to (...)
stablish an Ecclesiastical custom also, which, in things of this nature,
external ornaments and formalities, is a more (...) onal ground, and rule or
measure of decency, than any Mr. J. ( or Amesius to boot) will readily he able
to produce for the rejecting of them, or breaking and casting away those bands
which tied no harder a (...) than this upon their shoulders.

Jeanes.
The Surplice was used not only as a note of distinction, but also for its
mystical signification, to betoken sanctity of life, and until this latter use
of them be proved lawful, your four arguments will be but a begging of the
Question, as you will soon perceive, when you attempt the reducing of them into
form.

This may suffice for answer unto all your arguments; but I shall also give
unto each of them a several answer.

The first argument is taken from the Analogy betwixt civil and sacred persons
and actions: Civil persons wear solemn garments for solemn actions, which they
do not use at other times; therefore it is decent for Ministers to wear
solemn garments in their solemn sacred actions, which they do not use in
common occasions, as whilst they are walking in the streets, or the like.

To answer this, I need not trouble my (...), but only refer the Reader unto
what Ames answers unto the like objection of Bishop Mortons in his Reply to
his particular Def. etc page 4. To which I answer.

1. That if all this be granted, yet it makes not for the Surplice; which is
not a Civil (...) an Ecclesiastical, Religious habit; there is great difference
betwixt a grave, civil habit, and a mystical garment.

2. The consequence does not follow; because in the exercising of the
Ministerial duty, nothing is requisite which the Lord himself does not impose
upon his Ministers. A Minister then has another person, than when he walkoth
in the street.

3. There is a great disparity betwixt Judges and Ministers, in regard of their
Functions; for Judges Functions are civil, and therefore subject unto man's
Institutions: but Ministers in their Functions are only to observe what he,
whose service they are to perform has appointed.

This answer fits your argument, as if it had been purposely made for it, and
by this the (...) may see, that it was baffled long ago, and (...) you should
not have propounded it anew without some reinforcement.

But your second argument will strike the matter dead; The Command of our
Superiors added unto the decency of the matter. But this mends the matter
nothing at all; for our Superiors, as well as others, are prohibited to make
any additionals unto the Worship instituted by the supreme Lawgiver, who had
infinite Wisdom, and so could sufficiently provide whatsoever was fitting in
his own Worship and Service: All additions unto the Ceremonial Law under the
Old Testament (...) unlawful, Deur. 12. 32. And why then should it be lawful
to add unto the Ceremonial Law in the New Testament? Christ was faithful in
the House of God, as Moses, Heb. 3. 2. and therefore his provision for (...)
was as perfect and exact, though not as numerous.

Your third Argument, The resemblance of the Surplice unto those Garments which
in Scripture are mentioned for the like solemnities, long, shining, white Robes
or Garments, I suppose you mean some of the holy Garments of Aaron, that were
appointed for glory and for beauty, Levit. 16. 4. and then this reason may
involve the Surplice in the guilt of Judaisme, rather than prove its decency.
Has God, think you, abrogated those mystical Garments that were of his own
(...), to make way for such as shall be of men's invention: If we must needs
have mystical apparel, what can be more sitting than that which God himself
ordained?

The Word and Sacraments do sufficiently mind a Minister of his duty, and the
light of them is so full and clear, like that of the Sun, as that it needs not
the candle of a Surplice. This instruction of the Church by humane Ceremonies,
is to teach her with a Fescue, to hide the light of the Gospel under a bushel,
and it is a (...) and shadowing of its brightness.

Some have concluded the Surplice to be decent, because the Angels appeared in
shining garments, Luke 24. 4. in raiment white as snow, Mat. 28. 3. because the
glorious Saints in heaven are (...) with white robes, Revel. 7. 9. and the
Lambs Wife shall be arraied with fine linen, clean, white, Revel. 19. 8. But
these inferences are, as they say, (...) ad angulum, and you are wiser than to
own them, and yet the strength of your argument is little, if at all, superior
to them.

Your fourth argument is, the constant usage of other Churches, besides this of
ours, Eastern as well as Western, for many Centuries together.

But first, the not using the Surplice by Christ and his Apostles, and some
Centures immediately following their times, is a saser prosident to imitate,
than the usage of it in succeeding Centuries, which were not so pure and
incorrupt as the Primitive time.

2. Those which are utterly unskilled in the Ancients, may collect from the
confession of your great and learned Hooker, Ecclesiastical Polity, rag. 245.
That the true and Primitive antiquity of the Surplice, is a matter very
doubtful, notwithstanding, says he, I am not bent to stand stiffly upon these
probabilities, that in Hieromes and Chrysostomes times any such (...), as a
white garment, was made several unto this purpose, to wit, for Ministers to
execute their Ministry in, and it is without doubt that in the next age, the
cumbersome weight of Ceremonies, as you call it, burdened the Church; for
Augustine who lived in the times of Hierome complained hereof, Epist. 119. ad
Januar. Quamvis enim neque hoc inveniti possit, quomodo contra fidem sint,
(...) tamen religionem, quam paucissimis and manifestissimis celebrationum
Sacramentis misericordia Dei esse liberam voluit, servilibus oneribus premunt,
ut tolerabilior sit conditio Judaeorum, qui etiam si tempus libertatis non
agnoverint, legalibus tamen sarcinis, non humanis praesumptionibus
subjieiuntur. Sed ecclesia Dei inter multam paleam multaque, zizanta constituta
multa tolerat.

In the next place you aver, that Ecclesiastical custom in things of this
nature, is a more rational ground and rule of decency (...) any Mr. J. or
Amesius to boot, will readily be able to produce, for the rejecting of them,
etc. But until Amesius his argument against things of this nature, humane
mystical ceremonies, be answered, this comparison with impartial Readers will
pass for nothing but vapouring.

In the end of the Section, you give a hint of the tolerablenesse of the
Ceremonies, they were bands which tied no harder (...) than this, upon your
shoulders.

But first, God has broken the yoke of his own Ceremonies, and our Pre lates
cannot show us any commission for their pretended authority to make a new yoke
of their own, and with it to gall the necks and consciences of Christ's Members
and Ministers. Paul, though he thought all indifferent things to be lawful,
yet he professes that he would not be brought under the power of any, 1 Cor.
6. 12. Now we were brought under the power of the Cross and Surplice; for as
Aquinas (...), qui utitur eo, quod non expedit, sive licitum sive illicitum,
redigitur (...) sub rei illius potestate, and we were enthralled unto the use
of them, when they were not expedient, when they did not edify, but destroy and
scandalize.

2. If we may judge of the late Bishops zeal by their punishments, they showed
more zeal against the neglect of their Ceremonies, than against the omission of
the weightiest matter of both the Law and Gospel; the most scandalous and
ignorant Ministers found more favor at their Tribunals, than such of the
Nonconformists as were renowned for parts and learning, and exemplary for
personal piety and diligence in their Ministerial function.

3. Their rigor in imposing these bands was unexcusable and unsupportable; for
it was upon no less penalties than silencing and deprivation, and these were
upon the most peaceable and conscientious Dissenters: and when these arguments
satisfied them not (and they were the best arguments their Consistories
yielded) the poor men were judged obstinate and contumacious, and then the
Secular power was called upon for their (...) imprisonment, they must not
breath in English (...), unless in the close, and perhaps infected one, of a
(...) prison; and there they must (...) and (...), except they conform against
their consciences: But I hope the Prelares sufferings have awakened them unto a
sight of, and sorrow for this their over (...), if not, I shall pray unto God
to open (...) ears, that they may hear the voice of his rod.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 30.
In this case I believe (though not in the garments themselves) there is place
for that decency, the omission of which necessarily inferres indecency, and for
such order the breaking of which must soon end in (...) (which Mr. J. says St.
Paul opposes to (...)) viz. down right confusion.

Jeanes.
Here we have a great deal of confidence in your conclusion, but upon a
diligent and most impartial search, I cannot find any premises of a
proportionable strength to (...) it up; indeed you are like to meet with some
partial Readers, who will think your proofs irrefragable, because you have
(...) out so many quotations out of the Fathers, whereas all the while there is
nothing in all this your discourse that looks like an Argument: If you think my
censure injurious, you may right your self, by reducing your Arguments unto
form, and then, (...) they be found convincing, the shame will be mine, and
until this be done, I shall (...) my self with that which Aines speaks
concerning the pretense of (...), In his reply to Mortons particular def. etc.

affirmation; it were to be wished that the (...) would have brought (...) into

Logic will conclude different Ministerial Garments, from decency; (...)
decency was, and is without them, in a multitude of Christian Churches and
Ministers; but as some blundering Logicians, make their rule de omni and de
nullo, serve to prove everything so this Defendant would make us believe that
his rule of decency will (...) any thing that it pleases (...) spiritual
Lords to impose upon us.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 31, 32, 33.
Having said thus much ex abundanti above what was incumbent on me, I shall
(...) my self, (...) I (...) not spare any (...) pains, in survey of (...)
(...), which Mr. J. is, resolved to think considerable, and to speak very (...)
of (...), as proving that (...) text 1 Cor. 14. 40. rightly (...), does not
only not authorize any humane institution of ceremonies, but on the contrary
plainly condemns them, and this, says he, was so well managed by him, that he
has quite beaten out of the field Bishop Morton and his second, Dr. J. Burges,

32. Here is triumph indeed. And I suppose the Reader already discernes, what
are the grounds of it, viz. that Amesius acknowledges nothing decent, but that,
the omission of which necessarily inferres indecency, i. e. as has been
showed, nothing but natural decency, the (...) of which is a vice contrary to
that, by consequence, that there is no such thing, as an indifferent gesture or
garment, which either (...) or (...) custom, or obedience to our lawful
Superiors may render decent; that whatsoever some (...) law of nature commands
not the doing of that, if it be but wearing such a garment, which the Canons of
any Church (...), nay, by parity of reason a Cloak or a but (...) Doublet, is
absolutely unlawful by (...) of (...) Cor. 14. 40.

33. This being the bottom of those arguments of Amesius, I may safely tell
Mr. J. that they could no otherwise beat either Bishop Morton or Dr. J. (...)
out of the field, (...) that they thought them utterly (...) their making
reply's (...); He that thinks (...) is nothing (...), nothing lawful, the
omission of which is not sin, does (...) use other Dictionaries then we do,

all necessity or (...) of my farther enlarging on it.

Jeanes.
Here we have a gross mistake, and a bitter jeer.

1. A gross mistake, to (...) no worse, for Ames has no where any Argument
against things indifferent; it is a Conclusion which he never dream of, and
therefore you most injuriously fasten it upon him, and hereof, I hope, you will
repent, and give some public testimonial thereof.

Next we have a bitter jeere at Non conformists, (...) if their opinion
concerning humane, religious Ceremonies, were so silly and ridiculous, that
Bishop (...) despised it, and smiled at it, and could (...) it easily, by (...)
instances by unbuttoning and buttoning his Cassock: There may be truth in this
your relation concerning Mr Hynde and Glapthorne, but your false accusation of
Ames will render your bare word questionable, if it be not backed with farther
proofs; but suppose your relation true, yet all that you can gather hence is,
that they were weak Respondents, and knew not the state of the Question; and
unto that you seem as great a stranger as they, for you dare not say that
Bishop (...) buttoning and unbuttoning his Cassock, was a religious Ceremony,
and if it were not, was it not a proper medium to prove the lawfulness of
humane religious Ceremonies?

The Non conformists laid down four qualifications in the Ceremonies which
they oppose: 1. Humane Institution. 2. Ordained signification. 3. Mystical
signification. 4. Appropriation unto Gods solemn Worship and Service.

1. Humane Institution, they are humane inventions, now Kneeling, Bowing.
Prostrating, lifting up of the eyes and of the hands, shouting and dancing for
joy, they absolutely deny to be humane inventions, as you may see in Ames his
dispute about Ceremonies, page 495.

2. A second thing is ordained signification, though they have an aptness to
signify, yet they do not actually signify, (...) special institution of man:
those signs then that signify without institution by (...) or by civil
custom (...) shut out of this controversy.

1. By nature, natural Ceremonies as they are called, such as to look up to
Heaven, to (...) up our heads, to (...) our knees in (...); for these Nature it
self, says Ames, does teach all nations to observe without any institution
though (...) (...) some government of counsel, nor without such (...), as
Nature it self is subject unto. (...) unto disp. about humane Ceremon. page 27.

2. By civil custom, and of this nature was (...) woman's (...), (...) Cor. 11.
By received use and ancient custom, it showed the subjection of a woman unto
the husband, and so was an indicant sign thereof without any new institution
of man.

3. They are of mystical signification, they signify either some grace or
duty, they teach some spiritual and religious thing by their instituted
signification, and therefore are termed by some, (...) Ceremonies.

4. They are appropriated unto the acts of Religion in Gods service, and so are
religious in state, and have, as Parker phraseth it, a kind of immobility in
Gods worship, and hereupon they are (...) rel gious Ceremenies, and by this all
circumstances, or if you will call them circumstantial Ceremonies, all
Ceremonies of mere order and decency are excluded out of the controversy,
because they are common to things civil as well as sacred, and (...) as well
out of Gods worship, as in it.

Whereas Doctor Morton objecteth, that a (...), Communion cup, the Church and
place of Gods service it self, may be appropriated and assigned only unto Gods
Worship: Ames for answer distinguishes betwixt appropriation of this or that
individual, and of the kind; Individuals (says he) may be extrinsecally and
accidentally appropriated, the kind remaining (...) (...) common and
indifferent, and the individuals that are thus (...) appropriated, are of the
same use out of Gods service that they are in it; this, says Ames, is occasion
of admiration unto Dr. Burges the (...), but he might have considered, that
the (...) (...) of a Cloth, is to cover; of a Cup, to drink out of; of Meeting
places to meet in; and then where is the strangeness of this (...)? Is there
not the same immediate use of a man's eyes, in reading one book, as another, of
a man's ears, in hearing one voice, as another, however the subject seen, or
heard, may differ in nature or kind?

This is a true state of the Question, made, not by me, but by Parker, Ames,
Didoclave, and other learned Non-(...) long ago: And now I hope you are
sensible that Bishop Morton his buttoning and unbuttoning his Cassock, came not
within many leagues of it; there is no doubt, but that either you have, or may
(...) procure a (...) of the like (...) and fashion, as that of the Bishops;
and why should not this feat be as seasible (...) you as unto him? P ay, Sir,
try the (...) of your skill, and let all the Bishops in the Land (...) your
(...); nay, take in what help you can (...) Mr. Hooker his discourse of Laws
that you refer me unto, and if from the buttoning and unbuttoning of your
Cassock, you can with all your united forces, prove the lawfulness of humane
religious Ceremonies, symbolical signs; that is, those which teach some things
spiritual by their (...) instituted signification, and are appropriated unto
Gods worship, I will then confess that there is as miraculous a virtue in your
Cassock, as you (...) unto the sign of the Cross in the Primitive times, and
shall be ready publicly to (...) whatsoever I have written, or spoken against
these Ceremonies; but until such proof be made, it will be no act of
imprudence in you to (...) for the future, such unsavory girds; for however
they bewray a passionate, high, and (...) contempt of your poor (...), yet
upon examination they will be sound to be saplesse and irrational, to have in
them nothing of truth, and as little of charity and humility.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 35.
Mean while, to the reproach of my great stupidity, I willingly acknowledge,
that it cannot enter into my understanding, what sense that text is capable of,
which with the (...) ((...)) (...) can be taught plainly to condemn (...) of
Ceremonies in the Church, i. e. by what (...) or supplies, or advantages of art
this Enthymeme shall be rendered (...). The Apostle commands that all things be
(...) decently, and in order: ergo, he condemnt all institution of Ceremonies
for Gods worship. He that can maintain this consequence not only to be true
but (as Mr (...) it) plain and evident, will be a formidable adversary indeed,
much better deserving that (...), than one whom he knows not, and therefore
honors with it.

Nothing has more betrayed men to shameful overthrows than contempt of
Adversaries: what opened the King of Sweden so speedy a way unto his Victories,

as yet, you never read him, and yet you have undertaken to censure and (...)

Concerning an Argument against our Ceremonies, 1 Cor. 14. which is
acknowledged to be the only place in all the New Testament, that can be
alleged for their imposing. In Ames his Repl. to Mortons general Def. etc.
page 9, 10, 11, 12.

This Scripture, 1 Cor. 14. 26. 40. being rightly understood, does not only
not justify such Ceremenies as ours, but plainly condemns them. For the
manifesting of which assertion, because it may seem strange to those (...) that
are accustomed to other sounds, I will here distinctly ser down an Argument
drawn (...) of these words, against such Ceremonies as ours are.

All that is left unto the Churches liberty in (...) pertaining unto Gods
Worship, is to order them in (...) manner. This is manifestly collected out of
that place in question. So the Defendant seems to grant, so P. Martyr
understands it, as is to be seen in his (...) upon 1 Samuel 14. which judgment
of his is cited and approved by Dr (...) de Pont, page 841. and 844. confirmed
also by Junius against Bellarmine. (...). 3. l. 4. c 16 n 86 87. etc, 17. n. 9,
10, 12, 13. where (...) that Christ is the (...) Law giver, that appoints
things (...) his Church; and that he has appointed all that are requisite; and
that the Church makes no Laws (properly so called) to appoint any new things
to be used, but only Canons, Orders, Directions, ordering in seemly manner
those things which Christ has appointed; and that if she adds any thing of
her own, she does decline. The reason is because unto her is committed no
authority of appointing new things, but a (...) to observe and do such things
which Christ (...) appointed. (...) (...) Jun. de (...). (...). lib. 1. cap. 2.
n. 26, 27. 31. This is also confirmed by sound reason, both in respect of the
wisdom required, (...) in all Lawmakers, and perfectly found in Christ, and
also in regard of the nature of such Institutions. For the former reason
teaches (as (...) shows Rhet: 1. 3.) that all, which possibly may, should be
appointed in the law by the giver of it, and nothing left unto the ministerial
judges, but that which must needs be lest, as matters of fact, etc. Now in the
worship of God, all but particular circumstances of order, may easily be
appointed (as in very deed they were) by our Lawgiver Christ. As for the nature
of such institutions, that does also require so much: for (...) is above
civility therein, if it be not a circumstance of order, it is worship, and
therefore invented by man, unlawful will worship. For whatsoever (...) used.
or acted by him that (...) God, in that act, it must needs be either grounded
on (...) (...) considerations, and therefore civility: or an act and means of
worship, and therefore worship: or the ordering and manner of disposing those
acts and means, and therefore lawful, if lawfully and (...) applied: or else
at the least, idle and vain, and therefore to be avoided, according to that of
Basil (...) A (...) cannot be given. By all this it may appear, that the
authority of the Church is not to appoint what she will, no not of things in
their own nature indifferent, and say they be in order, or for order: But only
to (...) those things which God has appointed.

Thus far the proposition, or first part of my Syllogism: the assumption
follows.

But to appoint and use the Ceremonies as we do, is not to order in comely
manner any thing pertaining to Gods worship. The reason is, because order
requires not the institution or usage of any new thing, but only the right
placing and disposing of things which are formerly instituted. This (...)

1. By the (...), which is given of the word it self, which both in Greek and
Latin is (...) from the ranking of Soldiers in certain bounds and limits of
time and place. Dicebant enim (...) tribuni, (...) tibi licet, hic (...), eo
progrediere, hac revertere, (...) inde ordo, Scalig and

2. By the definitions which are given thereof by Philosophers and Divines

(...) (...) esse temporis. Aug. de civit. lib. 15. cap. 13. Order is the
disposition which fit places to things equal and unequal, id est, when things
are (...) ranked, some to go before, and some to follow, as P. Martyr
expounds it, loc. com. cl. 4. cap. 5.

3. The same also is confirmed by our Divines, who usually giving instances of
order, do insist in time, place, and suchlike circumstances, making a
difference betwixt (...) ceremonies and order, many times condemning the one,
and allowing the other: as the Divines of France and the Low Countries in their
observations on the Harmony of Confession Sect. 17. Beza Ep. 8. Jun. in Bell.
Append. tract de (...) imaginum. c 7. n. 12, 13, 14.

4. By the Context of the Chap. viz. 1 Cor. 14. it plainly appears, that
order is opposed unto that confusion spoken of verse. 33. and therefore in
porteth thing but that peaceable proceeding, whereby they should speak one by

Scripture does the word order import any more then has been said.

As for (...) that is nothing but the (...) of order. For as P. (...) (...) in
1 Cor. 11 it is such a (...) of actions as whereby they may more (...) attain
their end. Otherwhere it may contain that natural, or (...) handsomeness,
which is spoken of chap. 11. 13. as it does chap. 12. 23 and so includes all
that wh ch is (...) on civility, as a fair cloth and Cup for the Communion, a
fair and (...) vessel for (...); but not the appointing of new mystical (...),
(...) (...) (...) ceremonies were here commanded to all Churches, which the
(...) I (...) will not say: and then the (...) (...) (...) shouldhave worth
(...) God uncomelily.

Thus we have both proposition and assumption of our argument, against the
ceremonies, (...) out of this place, which the Defendant choose as the only
(...) that could be brought for them. Now I hope we may add the conclusion.

Therefore to appoint and use the ceremonies as we do, is not left to the
liberty of the Church, i. e. it is unlawful.

Concerning an argument against our Ceremonies, out of 1 Cor. 14. (...) is
acknowledged to be the only place in all (...) new Testament that can be
alleged for their imposing. Ames in his dispute about humane Ceremonies page
57 usque page 81.

1. The Replyer, seeing that all the-cause (on the (...)) depends on this
(...) of Scripture, and finding nothing by any (...) could be drawn from it for
our (...), thought (...) to try if there may not, (...) the same (...) be (...)
a (...) argument against them. This the (...). (...) (...) (...) of a new
(...), and loosing the way, as if all the Def. his (...) and all the (...) his
(...) which he makes after the (...). when he (...) (...) to fly, (...) (...)
away, were new Hares and (...) (...). I know (...) what (...) he has, to use a
(...), and a weight, one for the (...). with (...), and another for the (...).

2. The argument (...) thus put together by the Rej page 77 All that is left
unto the (...) liberty, in things (...) to Gods worship, is to order them in
(...) manner: But to appoint and use the (...), as we do, is not to (...) in
comely manner any things pertaining to Gods worship: Therefore, to appoint and
use the Ceremonies, as we do, is not left to the (...) of the Church, i e it
is unlawful The (...) answers first to the (...), and then to the
assumption, but so as he (...) both together, in many words: Yet I will follow
his order.

3. First of all the denies the proposition to be (...) in the (...) his
meaning. But I can see no reason of his (...).

1 He (...), that the order, and ordering is taken sometimes largely, for all
discipline, or policy; (...) strictly, for (...) of (...), and actions
handsomely, one before, and another (...), and so is opposed only to (...), as
in this place, 1 Cor. 14. 40. Now this is far from overthrowing the
proposition, in the Repl. his meaning: for the (...). (...) order in the strict
(...), which makes also for his purpose: And this the Rej. grants to be the
(...) of the Apostle in this place, 1 Cor. 14 40. Which place the same (...).
(...). 57. confesses to be the only place (in the New Test.) by which power is
given to the Church to constitute Ceremonies: from both which (...) together,
it necessarily (...), that all which is (...) to the Churches power under the
title of order is ordaining in the strict sense, i. e. ranking of Persons and
Actions (...). as the Rejoind. expounds it. Yet immediately after he accuse
(...) the Repl. for saying order to be the right (...) and disposing of things,
(...) for time, place, etc, not (...) why he (...) keth him, or wherein (...)
from his own expectation. Only he says that etc osten by the (...). (...) to
time and place, is a blind. Which is not so, for by etc. is meant all (...) of
like nature with time and place, as Number, Measure, vicissitude etc. How many
Psalms shall be sung, or Chapters read what and how much Scripture shall be at
this or that (...) expounded, how one part of worship shall succeed (...) etc.
without a blind.

4 In the next place, the Rejoynd. finds a wrong meaning in the Repl. his use
of the phrase (in comely manner) because afterward, in the end of he
Assumption, he says that, Comeliness is the Seemliness of order. For (says
the Rej.) beside that Comeliness of order, there is other (...). Now this the
Repher p (...) immediately after the words quoted, otherwhere Comeliness (...)
ay contain all natural and civil hand (...) etc. Neither will I contend about
this, but it implies so much in this very place; (...) that the Rejoynd. has
not given any reason, why the Proposition or first part of the argument should
not be admitted. Yet after that he has (...) it upon Mr. Jac b, and made the
Repl his disciple, he comes to examine the proofs of (...), though he
himself (as is now showed) has given sufficient assent unto all contained
(...).

The First proof is, that it is manisestly collected out of the place in
question, 1 Cor 14 and the (...). seems to grant as much. To which the
Rejoynd. answer th.

1. That in that place three distinct things are propounded, Edification,
Decency, Order: And these three cannot be one. But Edification being the end,
Decency and Order the means, they may well be contained in one: decent order
tending to Edification, or (which is as much to our purpose) in two; (...) and
Order for Edification. A holy Sacrament decently, and orderly (...) istred, for
Edification, is not four distinct things, but one.

His Second is, that these words are the (...) of the whole Tract: beginning at
(...) Eleventh Chapt. wherein are handled some things only concerning decency,
some (...) properly pertaining to Edification. and some which (...) more (...)
to Order, Ergo more is commanded in (...) words, (...) the comely placing of
one thing after another. Let this be granted, yet (...) solloweth (...) that
more is left unto the Churches (...) than order and (...) unto (...); sor all
things that are (...), are not (...) unto the (...) (...)

But hat speaking in unknown tongues, which the Rejoynd. does refer to (...),
is distinct from order and decency is by good Divines accounted (...) offend
against the order, and decency, spoken of chap. (...). and 40. So Dr. (...), de
Script. q. 2. c. 18. disputes against the use of an unknown tongue in Gods
service, out of the very place: pugnat hoc vero cum (...) quam (...), 1 Cor.
14. 40. i. e. this mightily (...); that good order which (...) so much stands
for. His 3. is, the Desend. (...) no way seem to (...) the proposition; because
the Repl. undertaketh by argument (...) (...) this place out of the (...). his
hands, (...) this nothing at all argues, that the (...). and the Repl. do not
agree (...) the (...), thought ey (...) about the place, as it is (...) in the
assumption. The Papists grant us this Proposition: No Ph (...) is used (...)
(...) in these words, This is my body, but a (...) one: Yet (...) they deny the
assumption; (...) (...) (...) are not a (...) phrase, we undertake by (...) to
(...) this place (...) of their hands. So the Des (...) no more, than order and
(...) (...) Edification, to be (...) unto the Churches (...), for the (...) of
our Ceremonies, does seem at (...) to grant, that all which is (...) to the
(...) liberty is order and (...) unto Edification, though he (...) these to
contain no more then mere circumstances, which is the assumption: Of
Edification there is not mention made in the proposition, because (...), (...)
an end, is out of question, and always included.

6. Peter Martyr is cited out of D. Whitaker De Pontis. page 841. 844. As
agreeing with that which the Repl. would have, Here the (...). (...) himself
much for the sake (as he says) of those that are unlatined.

He tells us P. M. does distinguish, though not divide, comeliness from
order, which we do also, for take the Repl. his words in the most (...) sense
you can, yet comeliness of order, does distinguish comeliness from order, no
less than comeliness of a man does distinguish it from a man.

2. He adds, that P. Mart. does there instance in the Ceremony of thrice
dipping, and in the observation or institution of Feasts. But let the Reader
know, (...) those words. Ceremony, Observation, Institution of Feasts, which
the Rej. has set down in a (...) letter, to be noted as P. M his words, are
not to be found in the place of P. M. but are added by the Rej. for advantage.
P. M. expounds the meaning he had in all his (...), by what place, what time,
what manner. If therefore the Repl. did not look upon that place, but took it
on trust, from the trusty hand of D. (...) (as the Rej objected to him) yet it
proves good and (...). So that the Rej (...) himself much, when upon (...)
uncertain, and (...) (...), he compares the Repl. to a hungry creature (or
dog) that (...) (...) with a bare bone D Morton once (at the least) alleged
some (...) on trust; and therefore, being challenged for them, he (...), that
(...) had them from Mr. Stock Yet the Popish (...) ((...) of the (...) (...))
did not (...) him to a dog, but only said, (...) he sent to (...) and
stones for satisfaction about them. Which I do not allege to the (...) of
either D. M or M St. but only to show by comparison how the (...). does
sometime ove (...) in his terms.

3 For D (...), he tells us, that he only says, that (...). Laws belong
only to order, or ordering, but not as it is (...) (...) come linosse. As if
any of us did so. The Repl his words; ordering in comely manner, do not (I
hope) refer all to order, considered apart from all comeliness.

This is the full sum of all that the Rejoind. had to except against the
first allegation. And yet here upon this nothing, it pleases him to accuse,
not only the Repl. but these men, of haughty and magistral (...), gulling,
and deceiving, great and (...) sin, and the poor. Repl. at the least, for a
man (...) of common (...). It seems he was very angry at something. Let the
understanding Reader (...), at what? 6. For more manifestation of the Repl. his
(...) of common (...), the Rej. refers us to the (...) (...) out of (...)
against Bell. Cont. 3. l. 4. c. 16. n. 86, 87. and cap. 17. n. 9, 10, 11, 12,
13.

Omitting therefore unnecessary repetition, let us (...) the reasons of
extraordinary (...).

1 Junius cap 16 n. 86, 87. says only (...), that those humane Laws are only
(...) in the Church, which tend to this, that all things may be done decently,
and in order, 1 Cor. 14. 40.

2. That (...) are improperly called Laws in the Church, being more properly
Constitutions, or Canons.

Now out of the (...) saying, the Repl. concluded, that Junius did judge the
Apostle (...) no more to the Churches liberty, than to order Gods Ordinances in
decent manner: And out of (...) second he (...) the same conclusion; because
any constitution, above ordering in decent manner that which before was (...),
is properly a Law. What extraordinary (...) is here?

2. Junius c. 17. (...). 9. says only, that to make new Laws in divine
things, is to decline, i. e. in points of Faith, or (...) rules of (...). But
Iunius (...) no (...) at all, either of Faith or Sanctimony, or Necessity, nor
Bell. himself in that place. Neither is the question there handled of points of
Faith, or things absolutely necessary to Sanctimony. All double, treble
Ceremonies reductively Sacramental, and Worship, are by the Rej. his own
dictates double sacred; and (...) is it which (...) (...) by divine.

3. (...). says that the addition forbidden (...). 4. is of (...) contrary to
the Law of God: Whereunto (...), n. 10. answers, that any Laws at all, added
to Gods Laws, are contrary to the Law of God, (...) of proper Laws, without any
backing of Gods Law, binding the (...), as he shows, cap. 16. n. 86. 8.

Here 1. the Rejoind. (...) out those words of (...), (...) contrary (...)
beside the word; which if he had (...), then the Readers (...) might have
recalled, how this place cited before for (...) (...) that phrase, was (...).
(...) by the Rejoind. page 42.

2. It is to be marked that the Def. and Rej. their answer unto Deuteronomy 4. is the
same with (...). page 134.

3. That exposition of Laws (...) backing, is of the (...). his own (...). No
such thing is sound in the places (...), (...) (...) did (...). (...) to defend
any such thing. Of binding the conscience, enough has been said in the head of
difference (...) our Ceremonies and Popish.

4. (...) n. 12 answering to (...) his saying, that God (in the N. T) gave
only the common Laws of Faith and Sacram. leaving the specials to the Church,
etc. (...) Gods Laws to be perfect (...), (...) and (...), and those of the
Church to be but Canons and disposings of convenience, for better observing of
divine Laws.

Where note 1. an example of an etc. for a blind, or blinding, which the
Rejoynd. formerly told of, for in that etc. is (...), (...) (...), and (...)
(...): (...) non possunt diversissimi (...) convenire in (...) (...) and
ritibus. i. e. for this cause, special laws of rituall things, are lest to
the Churches liberty, because of variety, which falls out now by occasion of
(...) and places, which is the very thing, that the Rejoynd. pawned his credit,
Bell. never said, page 15, 16. Note also, Secondly, that Junius does not in
this place mention Canons, (...) the Rejoynd. pleases to alter his words in
reciting (...) them; But cautions and dispositions. Now a caution about the
(...) of any thing, is not an institution of a new thing. 3. (...). is sound to
say as much as he was alleged (...), and to the contrary we have from the
(...). a (...) (...) (...).

5. Junius n. 13. says only that Christ is the only Law giver, that is, to
give laws, that in themselves and by the very authority of the law maker, do
bind the conscience. As if (...) in (...) of Bell. did only say the very same
thing with him, that he goes about to (...); (...) Bellarmine, in that very
place says: Christ is the (...) law giver, who by his own authority can judge
and make laws.

Now out of all these allegations, the Rejoynd. makes his (...).

1. Where he these words, all that is requisite as spoken of Rites and (...)?
Answer, the sense of these words, as spoken (...) all Ceremonies above mere
order and decency, is cap. 16. 28.

2. Where (...) you in (...) that the Church may constitute no new thing? Ans.
cap. 17. n. 9. this in things divine is to turn aside: for the Rejoynd. his
interpretation of those words, that they mean points of says, and necessary
rules of Sanctimony, is (...) by conference of Bellarmines words there opposed,
who in that place (...) in (...) and Judicial laws, and speaks not at all
of says and necessary Sanctimony?

3. Where are these words, Ordering in seemly manner. Ans. cap. 16. n. 86.
those only humane laws are necessary in the Church, which make that all things
be done decently and in order, 1 Cor. 14. 40.

4. If the Church may appoint no new things, but only see to decency and order,
then says the Rejoynd. what Patent has she to make particular (...) for time
and place? unless they be no new things. I ans.

1. Time and place considered as mere occasional circumstances, are no (...)
new things in Gods service, then concreated time and place, were (...) things
in creation, distinct from the created world. And Calvin (...). l. 4. cap. 10.
Sect. 22. severely (...) these, that call such times of (...) new laws: Quis
nisi (...), sic (...) (...) ab iis legem dicat, quos constant duntaxat (...)
(...), quae sunt a domino satis (...) (...)? if (...) that scandals be avoided,
be no new thing, then neither is procuring that disorder, and undecency, (...)
(...), place, etc. be avoided, any (...) thing.

As for a Patent to appoint double, (...), sacred (...), it is a (...) thing
for them to (...) it, that cannot show it (...) the (...) Seal. I do (...)
think that any (...) King would have his (...) (...) it themselves to that
power, which is fetched out of a patent, invisible and only avouched by (...).

7. A (...) was given of the foresaid proposition, out of (...). de (...). Imp.
l. 1. c 2. n. 26, 27. 31. (...). that the Church has only (...) ministry, to
observe such things as Christ has appointed, not authority of (...) (...)
(...) things. Here the Rej 1. observes, that those words (new things) have no
footsteps in Junius; As if new things could be appointed lawfully without
authority of appointing; and leaves only ministerial performance of things
appointed, he denies appointing of new things. 2 He cries thus, if the Church
have a ministry to appoint and do such things as Christ has commanded, then
must she needs have a commission legative, to appoint and use tites, serving to
order and decency. Add to this only, and then it is not only that, but all
that which we require. 3. He cries out of (...) perversion, eithe: by gross
negligence, or mistaking And why so I pray? because forsooth all that (...)
says is good to prove, that no Ecclesiastical all person has any power by
his calling over temporal Princes. But this is nothing against their delegated
dependant power, by commission: But First, these are very strange distinctions:
they have not any power by their calling, but some by commission. They have not
any power over temporal Princes (though they be members of the Church) but
over the Church they have.

2. The Rejoynd. makes Junius only to deny that, which Bellarmine never
affirmed, viz. absolute independent power of Ecclesiastical (...) persons as
supreme Lords. Nay Bellarmine answers to Calvin in the very same manner that
the Rejoynd. (...): The Pope is not the chief law giver but the Vicar of
Christ, and by Christ's authority makes laws.

3. He adds, that Junius (...). de trad. distinguishes betwixt decency, and
the (...) of (...) alone.

As if this were the main question, or any part of the Proposition, or denied
by the Repl. at all. The rejoynd. having little to say that was to purpose,
catches hold of one word in the end of the Assumption used by the Repl. seem
(...) of order (which yet is immediately there differenced from other decency,
as well commanded as (...)) and that he makes the main matter of the
proposition: whereas the meaning is, that nothing is left unto liberty in Gods
worship, above decency and order, for which (...) testimonies are brought, and
not for the other.

8. For more full support of the foresaid proposition, a reason is added, from
the fullnes of a perfect law, which leaves no more unto ministerial judges,
then needs must. For answer, the Rejoynd. 1. Observes that some cases are of
necessity variable, and so left. So the occasions of different rites, and
Ceremonies are so various, that if our Lord had fixed any one certain fashion,
he should have made rather snares then laws for his Church As if he had
appointed (...) at the table in a communion: or kneeling in prayer. This-is
strange stuff. 1. So much is granted, as is (...). viz. that God has left
nothing (about his worship) undetermined in his (...). (...) uncommanded, and
unforbidden particulary save only that which he could not (...) and (...)
forbid: Now let any man think, and judge, whether it had not been possible for
God in his word, either to have commanded, or forbidden the signing of those
that are baptized with the sign of the Cross as well, as baptizing of them
with water? (...). How can that too too bold and inconsiderate assertion be
excused: if our Lord had sixed (or Commanded) any one certain fashion of
Ceremonies, he had made rather snares then laws for his Church. If it had
pleased God to command, or forbid the sign of the Cross in particular, what
snare had it been? When God appointed all the Ceremonies of the Old Testament,
he did not I hope make snares for his Church, though he did lay a burden upon
it, 3. Whereas the Rejoynd. makes sitting at a table, in the Lords Supper, and
kneeling at Prayer, to be such things as the Lord could not command, but as
snares, because sometime a Table may be wanting, or something to sit on, or
ability to sit; and so of Kneeling: this is as poor a (...) to catch any man of
understanding in, as one shall lightly see made. For 1. many affirmative
Commandments of God there are, which in (...) cases cannot be fulfilled, and
(...) to bind, as praying unto, and praising of God with our voice; which is no
snare to him that cannot speak.

The appointing of Wine for the Supper, is no snare, though some Countries have
it not, and some men cannot well drink it. See (...) Ep. 2. (...) and Symb.
(...). lib. 1. (...). 9 2 I would know, whether it had been a snare if God
(...) appointed sitting at the Table with exception of such extraordinary
cases? if (...), then much more when men appoint kneeling, surplicing, and
crossing; if no, (...) our (...) (...) proceed.

Kneeling in public prayer might have been appointed without snaring, as
(...) before the Lord thrice in the year, was appointed to every Male in
Israel, (...). 16. 16. For (without doubt) many men in Israel, were, by
accident more unable to travel up to Jerusalem, then any Christian that has
knees, is to kneel.

After this observation, of which the (...) says it may he as we will, he
answers, that our Lord has left nothing absolute to the will of his
Officers; but has left even (...) Rites, under general rules, which will tie
them as perfectly, as if every one had been named and with (...) (...).

1. But this is (...) to the purpose; because so the in perfect est Law that is
in any Nation upon (...) earth, if it be worthy the name of Law, leaves
nothing so absolute to the will of (...) (...), as that it should be without
the general rules of Justice, common good, etc. (...) not without the rules of
order and decency.

2. Concerning the (...) of perfection, betwixt (...) and particular rules,
though enough (...) been said before, upon like occasion, yet this I will add.

If he means, that a general rule, if it be perfectly understood and applied,
does as perfectly tie as (...). I grant it to be a truth. And so was the Old
Testament as perfect a rule of (...) Faith as the New, (...) shall love thy
Neighbor, as (...) as the six of the second Table. But if he mean, that a
general rule is as sit and full for the (...) of us (...) (...), as (...) are,
then I think no man conscious of (...) (...), will believe him.

(...) (...) I believe, (...) he himself is so fully (...) in crossing the
baptized, by any rule which he has out of Gods word for that, as he is for
(...) by the rule of (...)

The (...) having (as he thought) (...) grounded the general, that a (...) Law
(...) (...) (...) (...) needs must unto (...) (...), goes on to assume, that
in the worship of God, all, but particular (...) of order, might easily be
((...) indeed (...) were) (...) by Christ, and therefore need not be (...) to
the Churches wisdom. Upon this it pleases the Rej. to say little to the
purpose, in many words.

1. He says, that circumstances of order were not harder to determine than
those of decency. Now it is plain enough that the (...). here, naming order,
did also understand decency, though he named order only.

2. He asks, what School of Divinity has taught the Repl. to say, that our
Lord forbore the determining of such circumstances, because all else was easy?
I answer, no rule of Divinity (...) (...) teach the Repl. to say so, nor yet
the Rejoinder to impute unto him, what he never said.

But if he means (as it seems (...) does) because it was not so easy to
determine circumstances of time and place, as real worship.

I then answer, that this (as I think) the Replyer learned out of that Divinity
School, out of which the Def and Rejoinder learned. That which they cite out of
Calvin, page 15, 16 Janius is cited to the contrary out of Cont. 3. l. 4. cap.
17. n. 12. (which place the Rejoinder looked upon by occasion of the Replyer
his former citation of it) But he in that very place, distinguishes betwixt
Laws, properly so called, and (...), leaving only cautions to the Churches
liberty, which is the very same that the Repl. means. The plain truth is,
that supposing Gods will to be, we should worship him in any place, and at any
time fitting, it was necessary, that the particular choice of fitting time and
place, should be left (...) to any particular time, or place, exclusively.
Calvin also is cited, as more comely, expressing the cause to be, that (...)
would not, than that he could not (...) such matters.

Now though Calvin, being so excellent in his expressions may easily be granted
to have expressed the same meaning in more comely manner than the Repl. Yet
here was no cause of noting disparity: For the Repl in saying, all things but
particular order and decency may be easily appointed, did not say what Christ
could do, but what might be easily for us appointed, or with our case, or with
the ease which we do conceive of in Law giving, or of an ordinary Lawgiver,
having such authority as Christ had. And who does not see, that it is not so
easy, to appoint every (...) place, and time, wherein God shall be worshipped,
throughout all the world, as with that worship he shall be served? For that
particular description, a thousand books, so great as our own Bible, would not
have sufficed.

The world (as John says) would (...) be capable of the volumes that must
have been written. The Rej. himself, page 89. tells us of cumber, and much
ado, that would have been, in naming every (...), and is not this as much as
less easy? yet it pleased him to seek matter of (...) about this (...), and
that (which (...) not) (...) after he had, without reason, accused the Repl. of
picking quarrels. (...). 88.

10. A second reason of the Repl. his proposition, was, that whatsoever in
worship is above order and decency, is worship: Because whatsoever is acted by
him that worshippeth, in that act, beside (...) civility, must either (...) an
act or means of worship, or an orderly decent disposing of those acts, or else
at the least idle, and so unlawful. The (...) answers 1. that a significant
Ceremony for Edification is lawful; yet comes not under any of those heads.
But he himself (...) a significant Ceremony instituted of God, to be essential
worship, and instituted of man to be worship, though nor in it self: of which
distinction enough (...) been said in the head of Worship: Yet this by the way:
A significant ceremony for (...) is the same in it self, by whomsoever it be
instituted, because institution is extrinsecal to the thing instituted, and
alters it not in it self, internally. If therefore it be essential lawful
worship, in it (...), when it is instituted by God, it is also (...) (though
not lawful) worship, in it self, when it is instituted by man. Beside that
Ceremony whose proper sole end is (...) toward God, is properly done to the
honor of God, and so properly divine worship

2. (...) answer is, that comeliness grounded on civil humane considerations,
is not mere (...) in sacred actions and use, but sacred by application. Which
is very true, if civil application be meant by (...) civil; but then it is
nothing to the purpose. For sacred by application is seemly clothing (...) on
for to go to Church in, and yet is in it self (...) civil. The Question is not
of application, but of internal (...). Sacred things (...) to civil business,
do not therefore become civil; for who will say, that prayer, at the
beginning of a (...), is a civil act, though it were used in the upper and
(...) (...), and applied to that civil meeting, as it ought to be? And why
(...) shall (...) application of civil decency unto sacred business, make it
alter the nature or name of it?

3. His answer is that all means of worship are not worship. But he knew well
enough, that this was meant of proper (...) of (...).

His fourth is, that ordering and manner of disposing is ill divided from
comeliness. Neither did the Repl. intend so to divide, but rather to (...)
them, understanding by that manner of (...), comeliness. But if the (...) not
catched up some show of confounding comeliness with order, which was not
intended by the Repl. he had been in this argument wholly at a (...).

His (...) and last answer is, that by (...) leave somethings in (...), may,
and sometimes must be tolerated. But he should have (...) bred, that the
question here is not of tolerating, but of appointing and (...).

Now if it be lawful, to (...) and use empty and (...) Ceremony; in Gods
worship, let those worshipers judge, that (...) at the majesty of God, and are
afraid in any manner to appear empty, and unprofitably before (...). Nay (to
(...) by our (...)) let the Papists themselves judge. (...). de Pontif. l. 4.
c. (...). ad 4. (...) those Ceremonies to (...) (...), (...) are unprofitable
altogether, and vain precepts, (...) and (...) Ceremonies, only by humane
spirit invented. And de (...). (...). l. 2. c. 32. empty and good for nothing,
more then needs, and not a jot (...) to any (...). and who not?

11. Thus (...) concerning the (...) of our argument: the assun (...) (...),
which is this: To appoint and (...) the Ceremonies as we do, is not to order in
(...) (...) any thing pertaining to Gods worship. The reason is, because order
(...) not the (...) (...) (...) of any (...), but only the right placing and
(...) of things (...) (...).

The Rejoynd. answers (...). (...) (...) (...) (...) time, place and measure:
which is a (...) in the (...) before (...), and (...).

2 His second is, that ordering in (...) manner, or (...), (...) the
institution of such (...), as shall be (...) to the (...), and variety of
divine actions. Where the (...) (...) is not so formal, that a man may spy in
it the difference it (...) from other things: the Rejoinder in his (...). page
36. (...) it to (...) Rochets, etc. (...) as they are distinct from Surplices:
the Bishops went (...) the hearse in their (...), the Clerks in their
Surplices. So that it (...) to mean some (...) of State, and dignity: of which
kind neither (...), not surplice is any. Howsoever the ordering of one thing,
does not require another new thing, but only disposing of that one. For if it
did, then that new thing (because that also must be ordered) would require
another new thing, and that also for order sake another, so that no one thing
could be ordered without an infinite (...) of new things.

As (...) the dignity of divine actions, that is best suited with man's reverent
and humble simplicity, not with outward shows of dignity, (...) by (...). The
woman's (...) vail was more suitable to the dignity of Gods worship, then if she
had adorned her self with Gold, and (...) us (...). (...) plain Cloak was more
suitable, then the (...) Cope in all Rome. If (...) (...) outward shows of
dignity, then Rome, which is a (...) (...), may be to all Churches a mirable
example of religious order; for the (...) of (...) Sess. 22. professes their
Mass Ceremonies to be invented, that the (...) of such a Sacrifice might be
set out.

12. To show further that order requires not such Ceremonies as ours, the
notation of the word was brought in, signifying no such thing. Now the Rejoynd.
grants, that originally the word does nor contain within the compass of it,
(...) kind of Ceremonies, though by usage it may. Which is very true, but
helps not, Except the Def. or Rejoynd, whose princi all argument is taken
from this place, and only retorted by us, can prove, that in this place the
word order is extended beyond his original signification. He will not
therefore stand with us, about the signification of the word in this place: let
order says he, in this place signify no more then placing. But he makes his
retreat to the word Comeliness; asking if comeliness be nothing? I answer
yes, it is something; but the (...). did not insist on that word, because he
took the (...) of the Def. his argument from this place, principally to lie
upon order.

But seeing the Rejoinder has given up Order, I will add a word or two
concerning Comeliness.

I take this for granted, that seeing the Rejoinder (...) order here to be taken
in strict signification, as opposed only to (...), page 78. he will also
consent with us, that decency, in (...) same (...) and (...), is to be taken in
strict signification, as opposed only to the vice (...) undecency. Now hence it
follows that decency requires nothing, but that which is necessary to the
avoiding of undecency.

I ask therefore if (...) in Gods worship cannot be avoided, without double,
(...), sacred, significant Ceremonies, of (...) (...) (...)? If not, then the
Apostles did much (...) themselves, in their public worshipping of (...),
before men had (...) such Ceremonies; for that is no answer which the Rejoynd,
after (...); all Churches are not bound to this or that particular way of
comeliness. All Churches are bound to avoid undecency, (...) to do (...)
which decency (...), or binds them unto. If yea, then (...) does not require
such kind of Ceremonies.

Neither (...) it indeed, any more (...) order. So Mr. (...), lat. to. 2. p.
888. (...) is when the service of God is (...) with (...) and (...) (...) of
time, place, person, and gesture: and hereof the Apostle speaks 1 (...). 14.
40. The plain simple (...), without (...) affectation, is, that decency is (in
this place) nothing but good civil (...), agreeable not only to worship, but
(...) to any grave assembly. Decency (says (...) upon the place) is opposed to
vanity, sports, riot: it stands not in hoods, (...), or vizards of fond
Ceremonies. etc.

I dare appeal to D. B. his conscience, if Baptism be not as decently
administered without the (...), as with it,? and public prayers made (...)
decently without a Surplice, as with it? Let conscience here speak, and the
Rejoynde harkening unto it, will (without all doubt) confess, that decency in
this (...) does no more require either Cross or Surplice, then (...), and that
(...) (...) them together does no more require those Ceremonies, then a hundred
other, which in England (though not at Rome) are denied unto them.

To this purpose Mr. Attersall, in his second book of the (...), chap 5. says
well: if they refer all this trash and trumpery (of humane Ceremonies in
Baptism) to order and comeliness, as Hosius does, do they not thereby (...)
phemously accuse the (...) of John, and of the Apostles of uncomelinesse and
disorder? whereas the (...) and dignity of the Sacraments is to (...) (...) by
the word of God, by the institution of Christ, by the (...) of the Gospel, and
by the practice of the Apostles: Nothing is more comely, decent, and orderly,
then that which Christ commands and (...): nothing is more uncomely and
unseemly then that which man inventeth in the (...) of God, and in the
celebration of the Sacraments; thereby inverting and perverting the holy
Ordinances of God.

12. The received definitions of order, are brought in to the same purpose, by
the Replier. And the Re joynder (...) so much as they import, viz. that order
in strict signification does not imply such Ceremonies as ours.

He must therefore either prove, that in this place, 1 Cor. 14. 40. that (...)
is not taken strictly, which he himself formerly granted, or give up the place,
which is (by his own confession) the only place of all the New Testament, for
(...) of such Ceremonies, or (...) to decency, upon which he cannot any more
fasten then upon order, as (...) been showed.

Nothing material is added in the rest of the Rejoynd. his answer unto this
argument (where our divines are observed, to distinguish order and decency,
from mystical Ceremonies, (...) context of the Chapter, 1 Cor.. 14. is
declared to respect (...) mystical Ceremonies, the (...) of Scripture is
showed to consent) nothing (I say, and the Reader may see) is added; but only
the same things are repeated about order, and decency which are now
sufficiently discussed.

So the Rejoinder has nothing to say to the contrary, but that we (...) safely
conclude, Ergo. to appoint and (...) the Ceremonies as we do, is not (...) to
the liberty of the Church, i. e. it is unlawful.

If there were nothing else against them, in all the Scripture, then this
place, (...) which the Defend. and Rejoynd. can find none in all the New
Testament for them, any indifferent man would say they are not allowed.

Those that are devoted to the Ceremonies may shuffle up and down, first to
(...), and when they are beaten thence, to Decency, and from decency, when they
can defend that no longer, to Edification, as the (...). does: But all will not
help. Let them pitch or insist upon one of these grounds, without starting, I
will pawn my Head, their (...) will come home to them again, as finding noe
fast ground either in Order, Decency, or Edification, for double significant
Ceremonies (such as ours) to (...) at. The Defend. could frame no consequence
out of any of these words, the Rejoynd, says there is one, but he cannot show
it. To the contrary consequence, nothing is answered of any moment,

And is not this a miserable cause, which has no place in all the N. (...)
which the best Advocates can allege for it, but only that, out of which it is
utterly confounded? To the Defend. and Rejoynders maintaining such a cause,
this (...) may be given that they would willingly, so far as they can, favor
things which the times favor, and therefore strive to make something of that
which makes nothing for them. In the former (...), when Order, Decency, and
Edification, should have been handled as rules, according to the title of the
digression, the Rejoinder suddenly breaks off, referring them to a sitter
place. Now here in this place, he was constrained to touch upon them, but so
softly, and sparingly, that it (...) he found this no fitter place then the
former, for those reserved Considerations. When shall we come to the (...)
place?

By this I hope the Reader is satisfied, that there is more in Ames his
Argument than you imagined, and thinks that (...) had no reason to slight it
before you had seen it. I will readily acknowledge that you are far his
superior (...) your incomparable skill in Critical learning and Antiquity, and
all the world would account me a fool to (...) or think otherwise; but I hope
it is no (...) to say, that he was not much your inferior for Logic,
Philosophy, and Scholastical Divinity; in which latter, he was more versed
than most of our Protestant Writers: Comparisons I know are odious, but I
Apologize for a dead man, and therefore I hope I shall be held (...): Indeed
his memory (...) to be (...) with me; for though I dissent from him (...) some
things, yet I must needs (...), that in my first study of Divinity, I most
profited by him: I have often found in a few words of his that satisfaction,
which I in vain searched for in more voluminous discourses. I know that he
has been contemned by many, but it has been by Learned men that never read
him, or by ignorant Readers that never understood him; and indeed unto those
that have not made some tolerable progress in Philosophy, he will be in many
places unintelligible; for he studied (...), and for that purpose, frequently
made choice of scholastical expressions: He lived and dyed an exile for his
dislike, and opposition of our Ceremonies; and the (...) were not contented to
have hunted him from his Native soil, but pursued him beyond the Seas; for they
engaged King James to command the then English Ambassador at the Hague to
solicit against his employment in the Netherland Universities, and he
prevailed with the States General to exclude him from Leyden, where otherwise
he had been received as a Professor; but making the like attempt at (...), the
motion was rejected as unchristian and uncharitable, with some tart reflections
upon the Bishops malice. This I have received from a very good hand, one of his
Scholars, that heard it from his own mouth: But I return from this digression.

Upon the review of this Section I find, what you say of Ames his Argument for
condemning of the Ceremonies from 1 Cor. 14. may with better reason be applied
unto Bishop Mortons medium for justifying of them, and with your leave, Mutatis
mutandis, I shall apply it thereunto: To the reproach of my great stupidity, I
willingly: acknowledge, that it cannot enter into my (...) what sense his
buttoning and (...) of his (...) is (...) of which with the best possible
managery (...) be taught plainly to justify humane institution of religious
mystical Ceremonies in the Church appropriated unto Gods worship, i. e. by what
Prosyllogismes or supplies, or advantages of art, this Enthymeme shall be
rendered concludent. Bishop Morton (...) and (...) his Cassock, therefore it is
lawful for Church governors to invent and devise Symbolical Ceremonies, that
is, those which teach things spiritual by their mystical signification, and
appropriate them unto Gods worship. He that can maintain this consequence to be
not only true, but plain and evident, will be a formidable adversary indeed,
as formidable an adversary as ever put pen to paper; and if you cannot maintain
this Consequence, the terror of your name will with me in greatpart vanish, as
touching argumentation: When the Spaniards came first into America, the
inhabitants (...) them to be immortal, but when they had once taken some of
them, they put their heads under water, and there kept them until they had
drowned them, and this soon altered their opinion: knowing your vast abilities,
I looked upon you as a very formidable adversary, and expected from you very
terrible arguments; but your arguments for the Ceremonies I have taken, and I
think (...) them with satisfying answers, and therefore you are not in this
controversy so formidable an adversary as at first I thought you; but I (...)
this to the badnesse of your cause, and not to any defect in your abilities.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 36.
His third and last impression now remains, wherein he undertakes to prove by
three arguments, that custom is not the only rule of decency; and his first
argument is, because the light and law of nature is also a rule of decency. To
this I answer, that (...) those things, whereof alone he knows I there (...)
in the Sect: concerning uniformity, i. e. in things indifferent, gestures, and
other Ceremonies in Gods service, the law of nature is no rule at all: and I
suppose he cannot think, I am sure he pretends not to prove, or so much as
affirm it is, and therefore though not (...) in all (...) of things, of which
I speak not, nor can by any rules of discourse be supposed to have (...), yet
as to the matters then before me, wherein Ecclesiastic conformity consisted,
custom, and only custom was the rule of (...).

Jeanes.
1. I had no reason to imagine that your words were to be restrained unto
things indifferent, gestures and other Ceremonies in Gods service, for you
undertook to give us the importance of the Apostles words: Let all things be
done decently, and the Apostles words reach unto even natural decency, now of
that the light of nature is a rule.

2. There be, as Bellarmine rightly lib. 2. de (...) (...). cap. 20. some
Ceremonies, which receive their institution as it were from nature it self,
which may be called natural Ceremonies, as to look up (...) Heaven, to (...)
up our hands, to bow our knees, and knock our breasts when we pray unto God:
Quaedam (...) sunt (...) (...) natura (...) (...), quae naturales (...)
possunt, qual. est respicere in (...), tollere manus, flectere genua, (...)
(...), cum Deum (...): (...) (...) natura ipsa docet, unde ettam communes sunt
Gentilibus and (...) sectis.

3. Those Ceremonies which we oppose, (...) (...), such as the Cross and
Surplice, are not things indifferent, because they are imposed and used as
parts of Gods worship, and no worship of God is (...).

4. Suppose that I concurred with you in holding the questioned Ceremony: to
be lawful, yet I should deny Custom to be the only rule of their Decency,
and that because the light and Law of Nature, right Reason is a rule thereof
too. My argument I shall thus re-enforce; If Custom be in the Ceremonies of
Gods service, the only rule of (...), then nothing else can be a rule thereof
besides Custom; but this is false; for the light and law of Nature is also a
rule thereof: therefore in the Ceremonies of Gods service Custom is not the
only rule of Decency.

The (...) of the Major is evident from what Logicians say concerning, first,
the exposition, secondly, conversion, and thirdly, consecution of exclusive
propositions.

1. Concerning the exposition of them, Propositio (...) subjecti (...)
exponitur per duas exponentes, quarum prima est affirmata, and appellatur
praejacens, estque nihil (...) quam propositio exclusiva, (...) signo
exclusivo: and secunda est negativa de subjecto exclusive in (...), vel (...).
This exclusive proposition then in the Ceremonies of Gods service, Custom is
the only rule of Decency, must be expounded by these two.

1. By an Affirmative: in the Ceremonies of Gods service, Custom is a rule of
Decency: And then 2. Negative: whatsoever is not Custom, that is not in the
Ceremonies of God: service a rule of Decency.
2. Concerning the conversion of them, Propositio exclusiva subjecti
affirmativa convertitur in universalem affirmativam de transpositis terminis.
The Doctors proposition then, Custom in the Ceremonies of Gods service, is the
only rule of Decency, is converted into this Universal Affirmative, every
rule of Decency is Custom.

Well, upon this premised concerning the (...) and conversion of exclusive
propositions, Logicians lay down concerning the consecution of them this rule:
Ab exclusiva ad exponentes propositiones itemque ad universalem conversam bona
est consequentia: By this rule then it will follow, that if Custom in the
Ceremonies of Gods service be the only rule of Decency, that then in them
nothing but Custom is the rule of Decency, and that every rule of Decency is
Custom. The Major then is fortified beyond all exception.

The Minor I shall confirm by instancing in the light or law of Nature, right
reason, this to join issue with you, would be in the controverted Ceremonies
of Gods service, if they were lawful, a rule of Decency.

For first, what is the end of a rule but to regulate and direct? now the light
and law of Nature regulates all gestures and Ceremonies in Gods worship, as
touching their Decency.

2. It is in these particulars not only a rule, but a principal rule of
Decency, by which all Customs are to be tried, examined, and regulated.

For the confirmation of this I shall add three reasons.

1. Gestures, Ceremonies agreeable (...) Custom may be found to be dissonant
unto the light and law of Nature, and to be rejected as undecent. 2. Custom is
not the rule of decency unless it have the force of a Law, and that it cannot
have, say the Schoolmen, rightly, unless it be rationabilis, and such it
cannot be, unless it be agreeable unto right reason, which is all I mean by
the light and law of nature; though the light of nature do not dictate the
necessity of it, yet it must give allowance and approbation of it; without its
warrant it is not to be received as Decent.
A 3. Argument shall be ad hominem: by nature you say, out of (...), is meant 1
Cor. 11. 14. Custom of some continuance in that place, and what more probable
reason can be assigned for terming of a Custom Nature, then its conformity unto
its allowance and approbation by the Law of Nature?

It being thus proved, that even in the Vestures, Gestures, and Ceremonies of
Gods service, upon supposition of their lawfulness, the law and light of
nature is a principal rule, it will follow that we may with far better
reason say of it, than of custom, that it is, in the matters spoken of, the
only rule of Decency: For

1. We may truly say of the law and light of Nature, that it is in Ceremonies
the only rule of Decency, though Custom be a rule thereof also; because the
exclusive particle only does not exclude things subordinate: Now Custom is a
rule of Decency subordinate unto the light of Nature, and therefore is not
excluded; when I say, the light and law of nature is the only rule of Decency.
2. We cannot say of Custom, with any truth at all, that it is the only rule
of Decency in the matters before you, wherein Ecclesiastical conformity (...),
because the only things excepted from being excluded by the particle only,
are things subordinate, and things necessarily (...); but now the light and law
of Nature as it is not subordinate unto custom, so neither is it necessarily
concomitant therewith; for diverse customs in Ceremonies may be, and have been
irrational against the light and law of Nature: The law and light of Nature
then is excluded from being a rule of Decency, by saying Custom is the only
rule of Decency.
Add hereunto, that the particle (...), only, does not always exclude a tota
(...), but sometimes only a summitate speciei, as may be seen in Scheibl.
topic. c. 2. n. 29. Now Custom is a less principal rule, that must undergo
trial and examination by the light and law of Nature, as a superior rule.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 37, 38.
His second argument is wholly deceitful, and must be discovered to be so, by
reducing it to rules of art. It Is by him variously formed in two several (...).
The (...) is this.

Nothing can be undecent which is agreeable to the only rule of Decency.

But diverse things are undecent, which yet can plead (...). The conclusion now
must be, Therefore Custom is not the only rule of Decency.

38. But this is no regular Syllogism, it is in no mood or figure, not readily
reducible to any; and therefore 'twas his only way to presume it evident, and
never to endeavor (...) proof thereof.

Jeanes.
I never said that it was an exact and regular Syllogism.

But first, here is matter for a Categorical Syllogism, and it is easily
reducible

1. Unto a Hypothetical Syllogism.

2. Ad Syllogismum ducentem ad impossible.

1. Here is matter for a Categoric al Syllogism: The only rule of Decency has
not any thing undecent agreeable unto it: Custom has many undecent things
agreeable unto it: Therefore Custom is not the only rule of Decency.

2. It Is easily reducible,

1. Unto a Hypotheticall Syllogism.

2. Ad Syllogismum ducentem ad impossible.

1. It may be reduced unto an Hypotheticall Syllogism thus: If Custom be the
only rule of Decency, then nothing can be undecent, that is agreeable unto
Custom: But diverse things are undecent which are agreeable unto Custom;
Therefore Custom is not the only rule of Decency.

The sequel of the Major is evident, because nothing can be undecent that is
agreeable to the only rule of Decency.

And the Minor cannot be denied: In the Syllogism then there is only a
Crypsis, the Major is concealed, and the proof thereof placed in its room, and
Cryptical Syllogismes are in all discourses justifiable, when they may be
reduced: If you call upon me to reduce the hypothetical Syllogism, unto which
it is reduced, unto a Categorical, you will herein be unreasonable; for those
hypothetical Syllogismes that have four terms in the Major, are hardly capable
of reduction unto a Categorical Syllogism; So Scheibler has instructed me, de
Propos. etc. cap. 12. n. 24.

2. It is reduced unto that Syllogism which is (...), which does ducere ad
impossible, as it is taken largly for that argumentation which does reduce an
adversary unto an (...) upon his own principles; for from this your principle,
that Custom is the only rule of Decency, this Syllogism will inevitably
follow,

Nothing that is agreeable to the only rule of decency can be undecent.

All things customary are agreeable to the only rule of decency: Therefore
nothing customary can be undecent.

But now this conclusion is apparently false, therefore one of the premises is
also false; for ex vero nil nifi verum sequitur: It is not the Major, for the
only rule of decency makes and denominates every thing conformable unto it to
be decent, therefore it is the Minor, which is, that all things customary are
agreeable unto the only rule of decency; and if this proposition be salse, then
your position is false too, that custom is the only rule of decency, because
all things customary are agreeable unto custom.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 39, 40.
But he has thought fit to vary this Syllogism, and give it in other terms,
and then one might hope it would be exactly formed. It Is thus,

It is impossible that the only rule of decency should be undecent. But yet it
is very possible that many customs should be indecent. Therefore he shall
conclude, that custom (...) not the only rule of decency.

40. But this is no Syllogism neither, being far removed from the measure that
Logicians exact, and such as by which I will prove any thing (...), that is the
most distant from it. For example, it is granted truth, that Law is the only
rule of Justice, yet this I shall disprove by a Syllogism exactly formed by
Mr. J. his model. Thus,

It is impossible, that the only rule of Justice should be unjust. But yet it
is very possible that many Laws should be unjust. Therefore I shall conclude
that Law is not the only rule of Justice,

Jeanes.
This is a modall Syllogism, framed exactly according to the rules of Logic
touching modall Syllogismes; as for that Syllogism which you parallel unto it,
it has no alliance with it; for both the premises of mine are true, and the
Minor of yours is grossly and palpably false; for unjust laws are not, in
propriety of speech, laws, but are so termed only equivocally, as a painted, a
dead man, is said to be a man: turpe praeceptum non est lex, sed (...), for
obligation is essential unto a law; now every law obliges in the name of God,
by authority derived from him, and the glorious name of God cannot oblige unto
any thing that is unjust: the Fathers, Schoolmen and ancient Philosophers are
all so unanimous in (...) of this, and have for this their assertion such
pregnant and convincing reasons, as that I cannot but wonder, that a man of
your learning should be of an other opinion; but in your next we shall hear
what arguments you have for your distent: In the mean while, I shall desire the
Reader to take notice of the witnesses, and reasons produced, amongst many
others, by Suarez, and Gregory de Valentia, for what I affirm,

1. Suarez de legib. lib 1. cap. 9. De ratione, and essentia legis, est,
inquit, ut praecipiat justa: Assertio est non solum certa secundum fidem, sed
(...) clara secundum naturalem rationem. Et ita (...) tradunt non solum
Theologi, and Patres inserius allegandi, sedetiam passim Philosophi etc. Verum
(...) haec ipsa conditio dupliciter explicari potest, scilicet vel negative, ut
scilicet quod (...), nec injustum, nec turpe sit; vel positive, ut sit justum
and (...).

Conditio ergo haec praecipue intelligitur (...) modo, and sic est evidens,
alia vero ratione invenitur in legibus divinis, and aliter in humanis. In
divinis (...) ratio est rectitudo per essentiam divinae voluntatis. Est enim
Deus sum bonus, and ideo non (...) (...) aliquid pravum praecitere. etc.

De legibus autem humanis, hoc fundatur in alio principio. Nam legislator
humanus non habet voluntatem (...), sicut Deus, and ideo quantum est ex se, and
quoad (...), potest interdum iniqua praecipere, ut constat: non (...) habet
potestatem ad obligandum per iniquas leges, and ideo licet iniqua praecipiat,
tale praeceptum non est lex, quia vim, cut valorem ad obligandum non habet.
etc.

Et ita est clara ratio assertionis, tum quia illa potestas, (...) obligandi,
est a Deo, quae tem a Deo sunt, ordinata sunt: Ergo est data in bonum, and in
(...), non in malum, (...) in destructionem: Tum etiam quia nullus inserior
potest obligare contra (...), and (...) superioris; sed lex praecipiens pravum
actum est contra legem Dei prohibentis illum: Ergo non potest obligare, quia
impossible est, homines simul obligari ad agendum, and non agendum aliquid: si
autem (...) (...) est prohibitum lege divina, non totest lex inferioris tollere
illam superioris obligationem: Ergo nee potest inducere (...): Ergo ejus lex
tali opere non potest esse valida. Et de hac justitia legis lequebatur August.
lib. 1. de libero arbit. cap. 5. cum dixit, mihi lex esse non videtur, quae
justa non fuerit. Et de eadem intelligi potest, quod dicit lib. de vera relig.
cap. 31. (...) segum temporalium, si vir bonus est and sapiens, legem consulit
aeternam, ut secundum ejus incommutabiles regulas, quid sit pro tempore
vitandum, jubendumque discernat. Vnde sicut lex aeterna solum just a praecipit,
quia est ipsa justitia per essentiam, (...) a vero lex humana esse debet
paerticipatio ejus, and ideo non potest valide praecipere, nisi (...), and
honesta, (...) illud Prove. 8. Per me Reges regnant, and legum conditores justa
decernunt.

Atque hinc ulterius concluditur, hanc conditionem, etiam positive intellectam
esse (...) (...) legis; (...) non (...) and (...) modo singulis applicanda sit,
etc.

Ex hac assertione sic declarata duo infer possumus. Vnum est ad illam maxim
(...) primam conditionem positam ab Isidoro, (...), ut lex (...) honesta, quod
ex ipsa vocis proprietate satis patet. etc.

(...) infertur ex (...), (...) non habentem hanc justitiam, seu honestatem,
non esse legem, neque obligare, (...) (...) nec servari posse etc.

Unto this of Suarez I shall (...) what Gregory de Valentia has to the same
purpose, tom. 2. disp. 7. quaest. 1. punct. 1. Nomen (...) (...) (...)
significat rectam aliquam regulam praescribentem communitati alicui perfectae
modum necessarium ad bonum ejusdem communitatis etc.

Atque (...) modo (...) D. Thomas (...), cum infra quaest. 96. art. 4, inquit
leges (...) magis esse violentias, quam leges. Item quaest. 90. art. 2 and 3.
Vbi definit, (...) ad (...) commune ordinari, and ab eo, qui curam gerit (...)
(...).

(...) etiam D. Augustinus lib. 1. de libero arbitrio cap. 5. (...) accepit,
cum dixit, legem non videri, quae justa non sit. In quam sententiam lib. 19. de

Alexandrinus, lib. 1. Stromatum, cum dixit: legem (...) (...) (...), and

Epineme, ubi asseruit, finem legis esse Deum and (...) ejus. Item Philosophus
lib. 5. Ethitor. cap. 1. inquiens, legalia justa esse factiva and conservativa
faelicitatis, (...); (...) Cicero lib. 2. de legitus: Constat, inquit, profecto

and juris colendi.

By this you may see, that in your Syllogism there are four terms, for laws
in the Minor are taken improperly and equivocally, in the conclusion properly
and univocally; But custom in my Syllogism, both in Minor and Conclusion, is
taken properly and univocally, for custom is predicated univocally of the most
undecent customs.

For farther justification of my Syllogism I shall reduce it in like manner
that Logicians reduce Syllogismes made in Baroco and Bocardo, to wit, with that
reduction which is ad impossible or per deductionem ad absurdum: I suppose,
that you will grant my premises, for the minor you confess in terminis in the
next Section; And the Major cannot be denied with any color of reason; for the
rule of (...) is, in some sort, an (...) cause of decency, and it is impossible
for the exemplary cause of decency to be undecent. Well then, I suppose, that
you grant the premises, and only deny, that the inference of the conclusion
from these premises is legitimate; if you grant the premises to be true, then
you grant the Propositions, that are contradictory unto them, to be false, and
hereupon it will follow, that if I take the contradictory of my Conclusion, and
can thence, (...) with one of my premises conclude, that one of the premises
which I suppose, you grant, is false, hereby I shall convince you, that the
principal conclusion, which is contradictory unto this, was true: The
contradictory of my conclusion is, custom is the only rule of decency ( I take
contradictory largely, as some opposite propositions are said by Logicians, to
be contradictory de lege) Now this I take and subjoyn unto my Major, and here
hence I infer the contradictory of my Minor, (...) which will make up this
following Syllogism.

It is impossible for the only rule of Decency to be (...).
But Custom is the only rule of Decency.
Therefore it is impossible that any custom should be undecent.
But the conclusion is false, and, I suppose, that you grant the (...) thereof.
Now if the conclusion be false, one of the premises must needs be false; for,
ex vero nil (...) verum sequitur. Now it is not the Major, for I suppose, and
that with very good reason, that it is granted by you, therefore (...) the
Minor: now the Minor is contradictory unto the conclusion which you deny, and
therefore the conclusion, which you denied, is true, viz. that Custom is not
the only rule of decency: for of contradictory propositions both cannot be
true, Contradictio semper dividit verum (...) falso.

Thus you see my (...) is demonstrated to be true, (...) ducente ad (...) vel
(...).

But for the fuller (...) of it, I shall propound and answer two objections,
that I foresee may be made against it, by such as are not well (...) in Modal
Syllogismes.

The first is, that the duo modi impossible and possibile are repeated but
once a piece in my Syllogism, and in a good Syllogism every term is to be put
twice.

The answer unto this in brief is, that in a Modal Syllogism, the modus is
none of the terms, but only a Syncategoremati call word, so Vallius Introduct.
Log. par. 3. cap. 12. In terminis, inquit, non (...) modus sicut; enim in
conversione propositionum modus non numeratur inter praedicata vel subjecta,
sed est quid additum illis, sic in Syllogismis modalibus, modus non numeratur
inter terminos, unde etiam saepe in Syllogismo modali non potest inferri
conclusio cum modo, sed sine illo. The very same thing is taken notice of by
(...). concerning such Modal Syllogisms as consist of Modal compounded
propositions, (...) enim inquit, quod modalis particula non habeat vel rationem
(...), vel rationem praedicati; sed (...) (...) se ex part copulae: inde
clarum est, quod in istis modalibus Syllogismis, particula modalis (...) poni
potest, nempe in singulis (...) Syllogismorum partibus, veluti: Necesse est
hominem esse animal. Necesse est Petrum esse hominem. Ergo necesse est Petrum
esse animal. Hic aio, particulam necesse, nec habere rationem praedicati, nec
subjecti, sed esse ex part copulae, quia in propositione, assumptione, and
conclusione reperitur. At nullus terminus in Syllogismo ter poni potest.

A second objection is, that in the (...) Syllogismes mentioned by Aristotle,
this mixture or combination of impossible and possibile is not at all
mentioned.

For answer, Aristotle instanceth in Modal Syllogismes, wherein there is a
mixture of necesse and contingens, and Logicians generally hold that
impossible is reduced unto necessarium and possibile unto contingens. Let two
speak for all.

(...). The but now quoted Vallius in lib. 1. prior page 38. Impossible
(inquit Philoponus) comprehenditur sub necessario, quia quod est necessarium,
est impossible ut non sit, (...) quia homo est necessario animal, impossible
est ut non sit animal: and (...) ratione quod est impossible, est necessarium
ut non sit. Similiter possibile comprehenditur sub contingenti, quod enim
contingit esse, (...) fieri potest, (...) est possibile, and quod (...) non
esse, contingit non esse: adeoque id, quod proprie vocatur possibile, concurrit
cum contingenti. He quotes also for it, if my memory fail not, Burana affirming
as much ex Alexandro.

The second Author is a late one read by every Fresh-man, (...) institut. Log.
lib. 2 c (...). (...) modi (...) annumerantur propositionibus (...) (...); and
propositiones modi possibile, iis quae sunt modi contingit.

Dr. (...). sect. 41.
To discover this deceit then, the Syllogism, which is now no Syllogism, must
be somewhat better formed, according to the rules of Logic, and reduced, as
(...) as it can, into a true Syllogism. Thus,

Whatsoever is it self undecent, cannot be the only rule of Decency.
But custom is it self undecent.
Therefore Custom cannot be the only rule of (...).
Here before it can be defined, whether this be a regular Syllogism, or no? It
must be demanded, quanta est minor, is the assumption universal or particular?
If it be particular, then either the conclusion must be particular also, or
else it is a false Syllogism. And if the (...) be particular, then it inferres
no more, than that some undecent custom cannot be the only rule of decency,
which is (...) granted by me, who do not at all affirm it of undecent (...).
But if the Minor be universal, then it is a false proposition; for certainly all
cust mes are not indecent. The short is, Nature may be the rule of one sort of
decency, and Custom (...) only rule of another; (...) if the custom be in it
self indecent, then of such indecent custom it is not pretended, that it is
either only, or at all the rule of decency. And so still my proposition may
stand good, which as it belonged not to natural decency, so much less to what
is by nature, or in it self undecent, never imagining it reasonable, that what
gestures were against those Laws of Nature, or Scripture, or any other Law of
decency, or rather of natural (...) and (...), (...) by pretense of any
custom whatever, be (...) into Gods (...): It Is sufficient that some customs,
may be decent, or in themselves not indecent, and that all decency in the
service of God, is to be regulated and (...) of (...) (...) with them: For I
said not, that all customs were the (...) of (...), (...) that some were, and
that there was no other rule, but custom. This, I hope, has discovered the
invalidity of his second Argument.

Jeanes.
My Syllogism is, as I have demonstrated, a true Syllogism; you might then
very well have spared the pains you have taken to reduce it, as near as you
could, to a true Syllogism; for there was no need of it: You deserve then no
(...) for your labor, but I have reason to expect reparation from you for
(...) of my Syllogism: This Section therefore I might wholly pass over, but
yet I shall stay a while upon the examination of a second restriction that you
put upon your dictate: you have already told us, that it is not to be
understood of all decency. Now you give us to understand, that it is not meant
of all custom, but only of some such as are not (...) (...); when you say
custom is the only rule of decency, your meaning is some customs are the
only rule of some kind of decency in the Ceremonies of Gods worship.

But whether this liberty which you assume in thus limiting your position be
justifiable, is very questionable; for after this rate, what (...) absurdities
(...) any man maintain? If I should say, that solum brutum est animal: that a
spirit only is substance: that number only is quantity: that Baptism is the
only Sacrament of the New Testament: would not every one cry out against these
propositions as untrue, as well they might? and do you think they would pass
for (...)? though I should come with an after game, and go about to limit
them, in such a manner as you have done, by your assertion, and say, my (...)
was, that solum brutum est animal irrationale: that a spirit only is an (...)
substance: that number only is (...) quantity: that (...) is the only
Sacrament of the New Testament of initiation; and yet these restrictions are
altogether as fair and allowable as yours.

2. I did not think your proposition capable of having an universal sign
affixed unto it; and my reason was, because as Aquinas p. 1. q. 31. art. 3.
observes out of the Summularii, dictio (...) immobilitat terminum cut
adjungitur, ut non (...) (...) sub eo descensus pro (...) suppositorum, non
enim sequitur, (...) (...) is animal rationale mortale: Ergo solus Socrates.

But yet notwithstanding this, I thought your proposition might be (...) de
(...), as they say; and so, though it were not formally, it would be (...)
universal.

But now I shall (...) aside this conjecture, because you inform us, that your
indefinite proposition, was intended by you for a particular proposition, only
I shall propound some objections against your making it a particular
proposition.

1. When you (...) Custom is the only rule of Decency, you speak of Custom
either formally or materially; if you speak of Custom formally and (...) as
Custom, why then every Custom is a rule of Decency, because a quatenus (...)
de omni valet consequentia, that which does agree to a thing as such, does
agree to every singular contained under it: but if you speak of Custom only
(...), and your meaning be, that Custom sub tali formali under such a
consideration or qualification, is the only rule of Decency, why then this
formale, this consideration or qualification of Custom, may, with far better
reason, be said to be the importance of the Apostles (...), then according
unto Custom, (...) (...) will be but the materiale in the rule of Decency.

2. Until you express how those some (...) may be qualified, that you make to
be the only rule of Decency, your interpretation of the (...) (...), Let all
things be done decently, will be very obscure, (...) (...), if not (...) (...),
yet (...) (...) ignotum, and your proof that you bring for your Exposition will
be as dark and doubtsome: Thus both will run, Let all things be done
according to some customs, because some customs are the only rule in some
things of some decency, whether that which you call the clear importance of the
place, do (...) leave the Reader in an uncertainty, be you your self judge.

3. The quantity of indefinite propositions may be gathered from their (...);
in a necessary matter they are universal, in a contingent, particular: Now I
demand whether to be the rule of decency be predicated of custom necessarily
or contingently? if necessarily, then custom cannot but be the rule of
decency, and then all custom is a rule of decency: A necessary proposition
that is affirmative, direct, natural, where superius praedicatur de (...), or
(...) de in (...), is also de omni: if it be predicated of it contingently,
then custom may be, and may not be a rule of decency, and then I desire you
to evidence unto us how (...) being thus a rule of decency, viz. contingently,
will be a solid proof, that the clear importance of the Apostles words, Let all
things be done decently, is, let all things be done according unto custom?
and your best and (...) way to clear this unto us, will be by reducing your
argument into a Syllogism.

4. If to be a rule of decency be predicated contingently of (...), then
custom is only a (...) (...) of (...), and therefore it needs regulation by a
higher rule; and if there be in the Ceremonies of Gods (...) a higher rule then
custom, it will hereupon inevitably follow, that custom is not in them the
only rule of decency.

5. You implyedly give us the Character of those Customs which you affirm to
be the only rule of decency, when you say, that of such undecent customs it is
not pretended, that it is either only, or at all the rule of decency: Now all
customs, in the Ceremonies of Gods service, are either decent or undecent: the
Custom that is undecent is not at all a rule of decency, and therefore your
position is to be understood of that Custom which is decent: for betwixt
decent and undecent customs in the Ceremonies of Gods service there is no
medium, as I have showed already: the upshot of your meaning then is, that some
Customs, viz. such as are decent, are the only rule of decency, etc. What
sobriety is in this limitation will appear, if we will consider that herein
we have a twofold decency: one in the rule, decent customs; another in the
thing, regulated decency: The former is different from, and antecedent unto the
latter: now of the former decency, in the rule, in custom it self, I demand,
What is the rule of that decency, whether custom it self, or some other thing?
I presume you will not say Custom it self; for then it would be an underived,
unsubordinate, and independent rule, a role of it self: and if you should say
that some other thing besides custom is the rule of the decency which is in
custom, thon by conformity unto this, we must judge of the decency of Customs
in the Ceremonies of Gods worship, whether they be decent or undecent? and from
this it is obvious to infer, that in Ceremonies there is a rule of decency
antecedent unto Custom, by which Custom it self is to be regulated and
measured; and therefore Custom is not the only rule of Decency. Your
limitation then is so far from being any support unto your position, as that
it gives unto it a plain overthrow.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 42.
His last argument [ because there is decency in the first usage of some
things] falls upon that mistake of my words which I discoursed of, and cleared
at the beginning; for I never said that a thing must be customary, before it is
decent in any kind: (...) knowing unquestionably that there is a natural
decency) but that the decency of any Ceremony in Gods service, wherein God and
Nature have prescribed nothing particularly, must be regulated according to
those measures, which the customs of any place do allow to be reverentiall
among them; or, in yet plainer words, the civil customs of any nation, by
which this or that sort of gesture is rendered a token of reverence, are the
only rule, by which the decency of indifferent gestures, etc. is to be judged
of, in order to Gods service. And so much for the last argument also, and
consequently for the first part of his exception, that against my
interpretation of (...) decently.

Jeanes.
You talk indeed, Section the ninth, of such a mistake of your words, but
prove it not. Now to prevent all mistakes. I shall come up unto your
limitation: Custom is not the only rule of all decency in the Ceremonies of
Gods service, wherein God and Nature have prescribed nothing particularly:
Verbi gratid, in the Surplice and Cross: For your Principles I suppose will
lead you to assert the decency of the first usage of the Cross in Baptism,
and of the Surplice in Preaching and Praying; and indeed if the first usage of
these Ceremonies was undecent, it was sinful: and besides, this decency was
not a natural decency, dictated by the Law of Nature, as you your self will
confess; but now if there were a decency in the first usage of these
Ceremonies, Custom was not, could not be rule thereof, because, as I declared
out of Aristotle and Aquinas, the frequent usage of a thing is required unto
Custom.

For conclusion of this first part of mine exception, I shall entreat the
Reader to take notice of the definition of Custom, usually quoted out of
(...): Consuetudo est jus quoddam moribus institutum quod pro lege suscipitur
cum lex deficit. By this definition, Custom has not the force of a Law, but
where the Law is defective, and the Word, the Law of God is not defective in
appointing religious mystical Ceremonies, for it is so sufficiently profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in
righteousness, as that the man of God may thereby be perfected, thoroughly
furnished unto all good works, 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17. I shall therefore conclude
that Custom does not, cannot oblige unto any religious, mystical Ceremonies,
besides those which God has instituted in his Word.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.
But there is yet a second charge behind against my rendering (...), according
to appointment] which he has managed in these words.

44. As for the other part of the words, Let all things be done in order; Ames
in the place forementioned shows, that order requires not such Ceremonies as
ours, and he gives this reason, because order requires not the institution of
any new thing, but only the right placing, and disposing of things, which are
formerly instituted: and this he makes good from the notation of the word, from
the definitions of order, which are given by Philosophers and Divines, etc.
from the context of the Chapter, and from the usage of the word elsewhere. But
the Doctor, that the words, may give some countenance unto our Ceremonies,
adventureth upon a new interpretation of them.

The words (...) (says he) literally import, according unto appointment, (...)
sometimes signifies to appoint, as Matthew. 28. 16. Acts 22. 10. and 28. 23. And
we may hereupon argue a conjugatis, that (...) may be sometimes rendered
appointment. But because it may sometimes be rendered appointment, will it
therefore follow that it must be so rendered in this place?

We may say as well as the Doctor, that the words (...) literally import
according unto order, as order is taken (...) for the right placing, and
ordering of things one before, another after, and this we have confessed even
by Doctor John Burgess in his Rejoinder unto Ames, page 78. a book published
by the special command of the late King. Moreover this sense is favored by
the coherence; for v. 31, we have a particular instance of order in this
acception of the word, ye may all (...) one by one etc. and not all or many
speak at once. 2. We have the opposite of order taken in this sense. 1. v. 33.
confusion. Let all things be done in order, then, is as much, as, let all
things be done without consusion. And I hope confusion may be avoided in the
worship of God without such Ceremonies as ours.

But we will for once suppose, though not grant, that the clear importance of
the words, is that all be done in the Church according to custom and
appointment. Yet the D. (...) a hard task to perform, before he can come nigh
his conclusion, that the words of Paul, are a proof of the more than lawfulnes
of prescription of such Ceremonies as ours, in a Church. For he must prove that
(...) and order here, are taken in such a latitude, as that they include not
only the customs and appointments of the Apostolical Churches, but also of
all the Churches of God in succeeding ages: and the performance of this he will
find not to be so easy, as he may imagine.

I am sensible that I have by this discourse provoked a very learned and
formidable adversary, but it is only love of the truth that engaged me in so
unequal an encounter, and therefore I hope the D. will pardon and excuse my
boldness. If he can by dint of argument prove the truth to be on his side, I
shall not be sorry or ashamed to be overcome by him.

45. To this, my answer will be very brief, 1. By giving the reason of my
rendering, 2. By evidencing, that if the vulgar were acknowledged the righter
rendering, yet my conclusion would very regularly follow thence, and that
therefore I have no need to contend with any gainsayer, about my rendering. 46.
For the first it is manifest to any that knows but the elements of Greek, that
(...) literaly and properly signifies (according to ordination or appointment)
(...) signifies [according to] not (in) and (...) [an ordinance or
constitution] millions of times in authors, and (...) [(...), or in order]
lying more (...) with (...), (...) reason can be rendered, why if that had been
the designed meaning, that word should not have been used there.

47. That it may so signify M. J. acknowledges, and so I have obtained all I
seek in my first proposal, which was not that it must necessarily thus signify,
but that this being the literal regular rendering of it, I had sufficient reason
to tender it thus.

48. I proceed then to the second thing, that if what be pretends to be
possible also, were indeed the only possible, or (by way of supposition, but
not (...)) if (...) (...) did really inport no more than [in order] as that is
opposed to disorder or confusion, yet I say, it will soon appear, that that
Apostles commanding such order or orderliness, and forbidling all confusion in
(...) (...), must by consequence he interpreted to command the instituting and
observing uniformity of Ceremonies in a Church.

Jeanes.
1. Our last translators of the Bible surely knew something more then the
Elements of Greek, or else King James was ill advised to make such a choice of
them, and yet they thought fit to translate (...) in order.

2. Few mortals perhaps, besides your self, have read (...) millions of times
in Authors; but to know the meaning of that word, there is no need of such
great reading, one that knows but the Elements of Greek may by the help of a
Greek Concordance and Stephanus his Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, make it
manifest, that (...) signifies literally and properly order in opposition to
confusion.

But (...) you say signifies according to, not in. But, Stephonus in the book,
but now mentioned, will furnish the Reader with store of instances, wherein,
(...) signifies [in] and a school boy may be able to do as much, for the Latin
word, Secundum, out of Cicero and Suetonius.

But suppose that (...) were translated here, according, yet this will no ways
disadvantage our sense, for, according, applied to actions. signifies,
usually, the manner of such actions; so that both it, and the (...) unto which
it is joined, may be paraphrased, by an adverb, and so (...) may be as much as,
orderly.

Add unto all this, that (...) signifies many times, with, and so it is
translated in the Dutch Bible; and let all things be done with order is
equivalent unto, let all things be done in order.

Dr. Hammond sect. 47.
That it may so signify Mr. J acknowledges, and so, I have obtained all I seek
in my first proposal, which was not, that it must necessarily thus signify, but
that this being the literal regular rendering of it, I had sufficient reason to
render it thus.

Jeanes.
Indeed I acknowledged that (...) may sometimes be rendered appointment; but I
added, that it does not therefore follow that it must be so rendered in this
place, and unless you can prove that it must be so rendered in this very place,
I am to seek, what sufficient reason you had to render it thus: for if a word
has several acceptions, that is to be embraced that has most countenance from
the context, now I gave you for the vulgar sense a reason from the Coherence,
unto which you say nothing, and you say as little from the coherence for the
justification of your own reading, and therefore I am not to be blamed for
adhering unto the vulgar reading, especially seeing it is favored by the
general consent of both Translators, and Commentators, though, as you observe
in the foregoing section, (...) lie more consonant in sound with (...), for I
do not think that the Apostle was bound always to observe Paronomasies.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 48, 49.
I proceed then to the second thing, that if what he pretends to be possible
also, were indeed the only possible, or (by way of supposition, but not
concession) if (...) did really import no more than in Order, as that is
opposed to disorder or confusion, yet, I say, it will soon appear, that the
Apostles commanding such order, or orderlinesse, and forbidding all confusion
in Ecclestasticall (...), must by consequence (...) interpreted to command the
instituting and observing (...) of Ceremonies in a Church. This I thus deduce.

First there is no possibility of worshipping God externally and publicly,
without use of some Ceremonies, (...) of time, place, and gesture, etc.

2. There is no possibility of order in a multitude, without uniformity in the
same circumstances.

3. There is as little possibility of uniformity among many, without either
agreement one with another, or direction of some superior to them all, what
shall by all be uniformely performed.

4. The agreement one with another, if it (...) only voluntary, and such, as by
which (...) are obliged, no way secures the end; but if it be such an
agreement, that every single person is obliged to observe, then still is that a
law of that body, as of a council, etc. and as truly so, as the constitution
of a single Prelate can be thought to be. And so the conclusion regularly
follows, that to the preserving but of order, or orderlinesse in a (...), it
is necessary, there be appointment, what shall by all be (...) performed;
confusion anavoidably coming in, where no certain rules are prescribed (...)
uniformity. What can be denied in this process I foresee not.

Here it shall suffice to note, that time, place, and such like circumstances,
are so manifestly necessary in their kind, that the (...) may be deduced from
them, by (...) (...), without any institution; but no man can deduce our (...)
from those kinds named. Man's will is the only reason, of them, as Gods will is
the only reason of Ceremonies truly divine by institution. No man can conclude
thus: we must every where have some garment, and therefore in England a
Surplice. We must always in Baptism, have some admonition to profess the
faith, and (...) in England, a Cross. We must use reverent gestures in
receiving the holy ``(...); and therefore in England we must kneel in the act
of receiving. But we may conclude thus; we must have a fit place to meet in,
and this place is generally fittest for our Congregation, therefore we must
have this. We must have a convenient time to meet in, and this hour is
generally most convenient for our Congregation: therefore this. The Monks may
as well conclude: we must have some garments; therefore we must in one order
have black; in another white; in a third, black over white, or white over
black; in a fourth, gray; a fifth, (...) colored; in some, all woollen; in
some, all linen; etc. ad insinitum, as well (I say) every (...), as the
Rejoinder can conclude from a garment, to a (...); from (...), to the sign of
the Cross, or from reverence in a table gesture; (...) kneeling.

Jeanes.
Though you cannot see what can be denied in this process, yet he that (...)
may read what is constantly denied by the Non-conformists, if he ever read
their books: they deny over and over, over and over etc. Your two first
conclusions if applied unto the Ceremonies in question: Indeed they grant, that
circumstances of time, place, order and decency, and the like, are necessary
genere in their kind, but these, I will tell you, are not the Ceremonies in
controversy; the Ceremonies which they oppose are not circumstantial, but
doctrinal, of moral signification, and the mere divises of men, such as the
surplice, (...), etc. And you may affirm, but can never prove, that there is no
possibility of worshipping God externally, and publicly without such
ceremonies, for it is (...), that such Ceremonies are not necessary in their
kind. In hoc vertitur cardo (...), therefore if you can prove this, we shall
yield you the cause, and ly (...) at your feet to be trampled upon and
triumphed (...): and until this proof be made, you can never regularly infer,
that to the preserving but of order or orderlyness in a Church, it is necessary
there be appointment, what (...) religious Ceremonies shall by all be
uniformely performed.

If you shall say that by Ceremonies you understand only circumstances (...)
time, place, decency, order, and the like, I shall confess my self to be
mistaken, but must withal for my own discharge (...), that you alone ere
guilty of this my mistake, for who could reasonablely imagine that in a
controversy with the opposers of Ceremonies, you should exclude from the
Ceremonies mentioned by you, all such Ceremonies as they oppose.

Your (...) conclusion call's for confirmation, and until you shall bethink
your self of some reason to confirm it, I shall offer against it these
following instances, unto which it is no difficult matter to add many more;
suppose the (...) of Churches in a City meet at nine of the clock for Gods
(...), and in the Country Parishes adjoining, where many people live at a great
distance from their Churches, they meet at ten or half an hour after nine,
nay in the same Church at one and the same time, whilst the word of God is read
or preached, those that sit in seats may have their heads uncovered, and those
that stand in allies may keep on their hats the whole Sermon (...), because the
crowd or throng may render it in convenient to keep them off. Now in both these
instances there is not uniformity in the same circumstances, and yet there may
be order observed, and confusion may very well, notwithstanding, be avoided in
all the parts of Gods worship and service.

But to give an instance ad hominem out of Parker, some of our Churches in
(...) (...) Organs, some not; some discant and broken singing, some (...); here
was no uniformity, but you will not, I believe, (...), that there was
confusion. This point of uniformity in rites and Ceremonies, the Reader may
find at large debated in the now mentioned Mr. Parker (...). of the Cross part
2. page 91. usque ad (...). These two conclusions being thus (...), I need not
stay upon the following, which will be useless and (...), without the two
former be presupposed as true.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 50. 51, 52, 53, 54.
What can be denied in this process, I foresee not, yet when it is granted, one
reserve Mr. J. has still left him. For says he, (...) it were granted that
(...) signifies appointment or ordination, yet still it will be incumbent on
the Dr. to prove that this extends not only to the customs and appointments
of the Apostolic Churches, but also to the Churches of the succeeding ages.
And my answer to this will conclude this whole debate.

51. First then I acknowledge, that it is not here necessarily ordained by the
(...), that all the Churches of succeeding ages should institute Ceremonies in
worship, for, provided those Ceremonies were once instituted, all that this
text inforces, is uniforme obedience to them.

52. But then Secondly, When for many circumstances of Gods worship, there is
no order particularly (...) by Christ and his Apostles, as in what gesture
public supplication shall be addressed, in what, lauds and hymns, and
confession of the faith, etc. And yet the rule is given by them, that all shall
be done according to appointment, and more over in other places, that obedience
be paid to those superiors, which watch over our (...); and when those rules
are not given only to the persons that then lived in the Church of Corinth,
etc. But to all that should ever live in that, and in all other Churches, it
can not then be deemed, either that there were no superiors designed to succeed
Christ, and his Apostles in the ordering of his Church, or that they should not
(...), set in order the things that were wanting, such as the (...) had left
undisposed of, or that inseriors should not be bound to obey them (...), when
they thus gave order to them.

53. When we are commanded to obey our parents, civil as well as natural, by a
Law given by God to Moses, or by Christ to his Disciples, can it be strange,
that we that lived not in either of those ages should thereby be obliged, when
God in his providence has given Fathers of both kinds (as well as them)
regularly presiding over us, and making use of that (...) that is presumed in
all parents, viz. to give Commands, and expect obedience from their children?
Certainly it cannot: and as little can it be doubted, either whether our
ecclesiastical parents have power to institute in things omitted, and thereby
remitted to their care by the Apostles, or whether we their obedient children,
that are commanded to act (...) according to appointment, should from time to
time be disobliged, and free to disobey them in (...) they appoint us.

54 It Is granted him, if he please, that what Christ, and his Apostles have
already prescribed, should not be repealed by (...), that thus succeed them;
should they (...) assume that power, they would not in so doing act (...),
whether regularly, or according to appointment; but for the (...) in which they
have made no rules, but left order to Titus, etc. (i e. by parity of reason, to
the Bishop in every Island) to make them, here what power is left them, may
certainly with perfect safety be exercised by them, and that necessarily
inferres our obligation to yield obedience to their exercises of them.

Jeanes.
Here you explicate your meaning by first a concession. 2. By instances, and
then you produce pretended arguments for the proof of the proposition which I
say is incumbent on you to confirm.

1. You lay down a concession, I acknowledge, that it is not here necessarily
ordained by the Apostle, that all the Churches of God in succeeding ages should
institute Ceremonies in worship etc,

1. I cannot imagine to what purpose you lay down the grant, for
notwithstanding it, you still hold, that uniforme obedience is to be yielded by
the members of each respective Church unto such Ceremonies in Gods worship as
have been, are, or shall be appointed or commanded by any Churches in the ages
succeeding the Apostles, and so still it will be incumbent upon you to prove,
that custom and order are here taken in such a latitude, as that they include
the customs and appointments of all the Churches of God in succeeding ages.

2. There is a difference betwixt institution and commandment or appointment of
Ceremonies, for though every institution be a commandmentor appointment, yet
every commandment or appointment is not an institution, and hence a Church in a
place may command and appoint the uniforme observance of Ceremonies instituted
unto its hand by the Church in a former age.

This pre supposed, I demand, whether you hold it here necessarily ordained by
the Apostle, that all the Church of God in succeeding Ages, should (...)
institute Ceremonies in God, worship, or else appoint and command such as have
been already instituted? If you think them all free, and disobliged from both
institution and appointment of Ceremonies in worship, why then all (...) might
lawfully have abstained from such both (...) and commandment, and if such
abstinence were lawful, I may, I believe, presume that it will be a very hard
matter to prove such an abstinence to be inexpedient and against edification.

If you should say, that some, though not all, the Churches of God are obliged
either to institute Ceremonies in Gods worship, or to appoint (...) command
such as are already instituted, by precedent Churches succeeding the Apostles
time, why then we shall justly expect that you should specify or nominate such
(...), and give some reason for the appropriation of such an obligation unto
such Churches, rather than unto others.

3. In your view of the Directory, page 19. you affirm that in the command of
St. Paul, there is a proof of the more than lawfulness of (...), prescription
of Ceremonies in a Church, and of (...) therein: Now I thought that you were to
be understood of all Churches, and then by more than lawfulness, I suppose,
you had meant necessity: You say that (...), the prescription of Ceremonies in
a Church is more than lawful, and hereupon I imagined that you affirmed it to
be necessary; but it seems I was mistaken in your meaning: I shall therefore
wait for a further explication of it, and therein I shall desire to know what
you understand by the more than lawfulness of (...), or prescription of
Ceremonies in a Church? As also to be informed, whether you extend what you say
of the prescription of Ceremonies in a Church unto all Churches? and if not,
what reason you have for the restriction of it unto some Churches? and what
these Churches are?

In the beginning of the 52 Sect. you perplex the state of the Question, by
instancing in the circumstances of Gods worship, which are by the
Non-conformists expressly excluded from the Question, for they limit it only
unto humane religious Ceremonies. Now betwixt these and the circumstances of
Gods worship, there is a great, and very wide difference.

1. Circumstances of time, place, order, and decency, etc. are necessary, and
appointed in general; but humane religious Ceremonies are not (...) in
general, as will soon appear when you go about to prove such a necessity of
them. It is impossible for Gods worship to be performed without some
circumstances, but it is very possible for Gods worship to be celebrated
without any humane religious Ceremonies.

2. Circumstances of Gods worship, viz. a sitting time and place, a decent Pew
and Pulpit, a fair and handsome cloth for the Communion Table, are not
Worship; but humane religious Ceremonies are in their nature Worship, as being
instituted to lift up Gods honor immediately in their use and end.

3. Things of (...) order require no ordering: Time and place require not other
time and place to circumstance them aright; but now humane sacred Ceremonies
are capable of time and place, and of being ordered.

4. Circumstances of time, place, order, and decency are common to religious,
with civil actions; but religious Ceremonies are appropriated unto Gods worship
and service.

But to come unto your own instances.

Your first instance is in the gesture, in which public prayer is to be (...).

But this instance is very impertinent: for

1. This is in the general necessary, so that it is utterly impossible for
Prayer to be put up, but in some gesture or other; but the Ceremonies which
Non-conformists oppose, are mere humane inventions, and so unnecessary in the
general.

2. We have, for the particular gesture in Prayer, sufficient warrant and
direction from the light of Nature and Scripture, without any humane
institution: But we have no direction in Scripture for particular humane
Ceremonies: This is very well set down in Ames disp. about Ceremon. page 139.
page 151. No (...) thing can with any color be averred of Surplice, Cross and
the like. I do not quote Ames, as if I thought you any thing valued what he
said, but that the Reader might know the true state of the question, and that
in the laying of it down you have not so much as consulted your adversaries.

But now to prevent as much as may be the multiplying of needless
Controversies betwixt us, I shall acknowledge that a Church may (...) the usage
of any reverent, lowly, submissive gesture in public supplications, when
there is conveniencie for the usage thereof.

But yet it will not hereupon follow, that all things are to be done in the
gestures of public Prayer according unto the Churches appointment; for
suppose the Church should prohibit in public Prayers the gestures of
kneeling, lifting up the eyes and the hands to heaven, I should conclude such
an appointment of any Church whatsoever to be unlawful, because contrary unto
the express direction of Scripture.

Your second instance is impertinent too, for the gestures of Lauds, Hymns and
Confessions of the Faith, etc. is a matter of mere decency, and how (...)
matters of mere decency are from the Ceremonies in question, I have declared a
little before, I shall therefore now only add these three things.

1. That a rational man may by mere light of Nature, without any institution,
easily gather, what gesture is fitting, decent and agreeable unto these
actions. 2. That notwithstanding this, the Governors or Officers of a Church
may appoint in these actions any decent gesture or posture of the body,
provided that by special institution they do not put upon it any mystical
signification, and thereby make it a Worship. 3. That from this grant it can
never be inferred, that in those gestures which are to be (...) in Lauds,
Hymns, Confessions of the Faith, all things are to be (...) according to the
appointment of Church Governors: and my reason is, because it is possible,
that Church Governors may be so irrational, as to appoint here undecent
gestures, as that the people should lie along on their faces in singing of
Psalms of Praise, and in Confession of the Faith. Now an undecent gesture
would be finfull, because against the Apostles prescription, Let all things be
done decently.
In the last place proceed we unto those arguments, if I may so call them,
which you have for confirmation of the proposition, which I say is incumbent on
you to prove: If you have for this any arguments in this your discourse, they
are, as I conceive, these three.

1. Because obedience must be paid to those Superiors, which watch over our
souls, 2. Because the Apostle left order to Thus (...) set in order the things
that were wanting. 3. Because we are commanded to obey our Ecclesiastical as
well as natural and civil parents: Now let the Reader apply unto each of these
arguments the proposition that is to be proved, therefore (...) in the 1 Cor.
14. 40. is taken in such a latitude, as that it includes the appointments of
all the Churches of God in succeeding ages, and the consequence will be of an
imperceptible validity.
The Reader may farther, if he please, make another experiment touching these
arguments, he may try what they will conduce unto the principal conclusion,
that the words of (...) are a proof of the more than lawfulness of
prescription of such Ceremonies as ours in a Church; if by the help of them he
can come nigh this conclusion of the Doctors, I will (...) that I have been
grossly mistaken.

And this might (...) for answer unto these three arguments; but yet I shall
for the further satisfaction of the Reader say something unto each of them
apart.

The first is, because obedience must be paid to those Superiors which watch
over our souls; the place is Heb. 13. 17. but this place will prove nothing for
the humane institution of religions Ceremonies, because our Guides may rule
over us without institution of such Ceremonies, and consequently we may pay
obedience to them without practice of such Ceremonies: The place is urged by
Bellarmine for the Popes Coactive power to make Laws binding the conscience,
and in Whitakers Answer thereunto, Tom. 2. page. 722. you may take notice of
this passage; Non constituit (...) Jententia regnum Episcopis extra, aut supra
Evangelium: non debent Episcopi suas traditiones aut leges, aut contra, aut
extra, aut praeter Evangelium obtrudere. Obediendum ergo est, sed cum cautione,
si praeeant illi in Domino, and nil suum tradunt: nam si hoc fecerit omittendi
sunt, juxta illud, ctiamsi nes, aut Angelus e Coelo, evangelizet vobis praeter
id quod vobis evangelizavimus, anathemae esto. Gal. 1. 8. Let the Reader
consider whether our Ceremonies were not (...), praeter Evangelium, besides the
Gospel:

A second argument which you prosecute, Sect. 53, 54. is because Paul left
order to Titus, to set in order the things that were wanting; such as the
Apostle had left undisposed of, in which they have made no rules, and the same
power you think is left, by parity of reason, to the Bishops in every Island:

For answer, (...) the things that were wanting were wanting in Crete, left
undone, as it is in the Margin of our English Bible, and not in the (...) or
rules which Paul gave to Titus: for that Titus was to keep unto the
instructions that he had received from Paul, you might have seen, if you had
had the patience to have read unto the end of the verse; (...) there the (...)
points to him the rule he should walk by, he was to (...) in order the things
that were wanting in Crete, not of his own head, but according to the
appointment of (...); as I had appointed thee.

I might farther allege, that Bishops (by whom you mean our Prelates) have not
the same power delegated unto them, which Paul committed unto Titus: But I
shall for the p (...) wave this, because it may occasion a long digression, and
the (...) (...) is abundantly satisfactory, and from it we may conclude; that
suppose Bishops had power left them to set in order things that are (...), yet
we may not thence collect, that they have power for institution of new
doctrinal Ceremonies, besides those instituted by Christ and his Apostles,
because however there may be many things wanting in their Churches, which may
need reformation, yet there is nothing wanting in the Scriptures, which needs
to be supplied by humane additions.

Your third Argument is drawn from the power of our Ecclesiastical parents and
the obedience we owe unto them. It cannot be doubted, say you, either whether
our Ecclesiastical parents have power to institute in things omitted, and
thereby remitted to their care by the Apostles, or whether we their obedient
Children, that are commanded to act (...) according to appointment, should from
time to time, be (...) and free to disobey them in whatsoever they appoint us?
Here we have no argument, but only a begging of the thing in question: It is
not denied but that Ecclesiastical parents have power to appoint and dispose of
such Circumstances of time, place, order, decency etc. (...) in their kind are
necessary, but in particular determination do vary: But that they have any
power to institute new (...) Ceremonies, of mystical signification, is a thing
which you cannot but know to be constantly denied by your Antagonists, and
therefore why you should (...) the contrary evident, and never attempt the
proof of it, I cannot sufficiently wonder.

But perhaps you have an argument couched in these words, it cannot be doubted
etc. whether our Ecclestastical parents have power to institute in things
(...), and thereby remitted to their (...) by the Apostles.

But pray, Sir, do you in earnest think, that if things be omitted by the
Apostles, they are by them hereby remitted unto the care of Ecclesiastical
parents in succeeding ages? Every one will confess that it sounds like a very
strange proposition: however, you cannot expect that I should swallow it, until
you bring (...) confirmation of it.

By this the Reader is, I hope, satisfied, that though your reading of (...),
according unto appointment, were to take place, yet you have brought nothing to
prove that, which you were justly called upon for proof of, viz. that
appointment, was to be taken here in this place of the Apostle in such a
latitude, as to comprehend humane, as well as divine appointment.

But though you fail in your proofs, your adversaries the non-conformists are
before hand with you, for they have proved that men's institution of religious
Ceremonies omitted by Christ and his Apostles is a most plain detraction and
palpable derogation, from

1. The all sufficiency of the Scripture. 2. Perfection of Gods ordinances. 3.
Fidelity of Christ in his prophetical office. And lastly from the all-fulnes of
his Kingly office.
I foresee that it will be alleged, that all these arguments are long ago
answered, and unto this I shall at present only give this short Reply, that
they have been vindicated from all answers, as by others, so especially by
Ames, and that this vindication of them remains unto this day unanswered.

However, I shall stay a while upon two places in Deuteronomy, which the
Non-(...) usually urge against our Ceremonies, and examine an answer which the
conformists gives thereunto, because this examination will conduce very much
unto the learning of the truth in the controversy of Ceremonies: the places are
Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall
you diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord
(...) God which I command you. And cap. 12. 32. What thing soever I command
you, observe to do it: Thou shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

Unto these two places, the conformists answer by distinguishing of the parts,
and the Ceremonies of Gods worship; it is unlawful, say they, to add unto the
parts of Gods worship instituted by God, but it is lawful to add unto (...)
Ceremonies of worship that are instituted by God.

Unto this answer I thus reply.

1. Moses sealed up with this prohibition not only the moral, but also the
Ceremonial Law; it was unlawful then, to add (...) the Ceremonial Law of
Moses; and why should it not be as unlawful now, to add unto the Ceremonial
Law of (...)? vis hujus consequentiae, (...) (...), (...) ex (...), quod non
minus nunc quam tunc rationem (...) (...) certis septis: (...) (...) cancellis
circumscribi opus sit, ne in rebus (...) lasciviat, aut in (...) delabatur.

2. The Scripture is a rule of even Ceremonies in Gods worship, for it gives
prescriptions and directions in the new Testament concerning the Sacraments of
Baptism and the Lords Supper; now if it does not prescribe all Ceremonies
requisite and convenient, then it is only a partial and imperfect rule of
Ceremonies in Gods worship; but we, for our part, think so honorably of
Scripture, as that we cannot but hold it to be a perfect (...) and total rule
of Ceremonial as well as moral worship, it is able to perfect the man of God,
and thoroughly to furnish him unto all good works, and so unto all Ceremonies,
that are good works.

A third reply is, that the members of this distinction are not opposite, (...)
the members of every good distinction should be, for Ceremonies of worship
though they be not parts of that worship of which they are Ceremonies, yet they
are parts of worship in general, for

1. Worship is divided into moral and Ceremonial, so that Ceremonial worship is
a subjective part of worship, a sort and kind of worship.

2. Mosaical Ceremonies under the Law were, and the Sacraments under the Gospel
are parts of worship: the distinction then betwixt the parts, and religious
Ceremonies of (...), is an artless and false distinction. To make this yet more
evident, I shall propound some arguments, by which the Non-conformists prove
our Ceremonies to be external worship, for then it will follow, that they are
parts of Gods worship.

1. Those external Ceremonies whose proper use is the honoring of God, are
external worship: But our Ceremonies are such, and therefore they are external
worship.

2. All external Ceremonies in their nature, formally elicited from religion,
are external worship: But our Ceremonies are such, and therefore they are
external worship.

This argument I find thus varied in a nameless author that has collected
twelve arguments against our Ceremonies.

All mere and immediate actions of religion are parts of divine worship.

But all religious Ceremonies, such as ours, are mere and immediate actions of
religion.

Therefore they are parts of divine worship.

And these arguments might serve to evidence, that our Ceremonies, the
surplice. Cross etc. Are imposed and used as parts of Gods worship, though for
want of a due and right author or efficient, they are false and unacceptable
(...): But to return unto the Doctor, from whom I may seem to have digressed.

Dr. Hammond.
This is all the observance M. J. seems to expect of me at this time, unless
his intimation to all admirers of M. Hooker, that they should vindicate their
great patron, of Ceremonies, may pass for an admonition to me, who
acknowledge my self a thankful adoter of Gods graces in that godly learned
man, and so exact a few lines more above the regular account.

56. This will detain me no longer, then whilst I mind the Reader, that in a
discourse of the benefits which we receive from Christ in the Sacrament, and
otherwise, M. Hooker undertakes to set down how Christ in his humane nature is
communicated to us, and so present with (...); To this end three things he
shows at large. 1. That as nothing created can be unlimited, or receive any
such accident from any as may really make it infinite, so neither the soul nor
body of Christ, nor Christ as man, nor according to his humane nature, can
possibly be every where present, no nor the substance of the body of Christ,
which netther has or can have any presence but only local. 2. That this
cannot be rendered possible, either by the grace of union with the Diely, nor by
any other possible means, as he at large excellently deduceth it, page 300,
301, 302, 3. That it may peradventure be well enough granted in some sense, and
after a sort, that Christ is every where present, as man, viz. 1. In respect of
the conjunction of the humane nature with the Deity, which conjunction is
extended as far as the Deity, the actual position being restrained, and tied
to a certain place, and 2. By cooperation with the Deity, and that in all
things.

57. Now on this third head, (without reflecting on the two former, which
assure us of the authors meaning in it) two passages M. J. takes hold of, which
if he know any thing in either Philosophy, or scholastical divinity, are both
(...) of a gross mistake, and cannot be sufficiently wondered at by him, that
they should fall from so a learned a pen.

58. But I suppose there is no great skill in either of those learned faculties
required, to distinguish betwixt that which truly and properly is, and that
which may in some sense, and after a sort, and in two respects only ((...) of
which belong to the propriety of being) be well enough granted, and that with a
(peradventure) also to have influence on all these.

59. And what severity is this, to require of every learned man, that has most
largely refuted an adversary, to be so averse from all thoughts of peace, and
reconciliation with him, that he may not allow him to speak truth, or but
perhaps to speak truth in a sort, and in some sense, and in two only respects?
All which are still more than intimations, that he thinks him to be absolutely,
and in simplicity and propriety of speaking, in a gross error, impossible even
to the power of God to have truth in it.

60. If any should chance to say of an eloquent man, that you might hear an
Angel speak in him, and I should reply, that it might per adventure be well
enough granted in a sort, or in some sense, that when he spoke you might hear
an Angel, assuring you at large of my opinion, that no (...) man can truly be
an Angel, nay that it was impossible for God himself to bring to pass, that at
the same time he should be an Angel, and not an Angel, a man, and not a man, or
which is all one, a bare man, and yet an Angel, or (in fewer words) when Christ
says he is a door, and a vine, if I should say that in a sort, and in some
sense, and that in two respects, each of these had truth in them, would M. J.
think fit to leave (...) subject, and let loose for three leaves together, and
pawn all his philosophy, and (...) (not confidering what the consequence also
may be to his practical) divinity, to (...) and wonder at, and (...) to give
over wondering, and withal solemnly to refute this or that improper figurative
(...), so perfectly acknowledged by the Speakers to be such?

61. If he have that great (...), and any prevalent temptation thus to lay it
out, I shall only assure him, that I have not so much of either, as to attend
these (...) motions, nor any other lover or admirer of Mr. Hooker, that I know
of, and theresore bescech him contentedly to rest in this general return to his
charge of that (...) man, without expecting any more explicit, or particular
survey of it: And so much for Mr. Hooker also.

Jeanes.
I believe that most ordinary Readers will think me guilty of this disingenuous
carriage toward Mr. Hooker, which the Doctor (...) me of; but if they would
have but the patience to read me in the passage related unto, they would soon
acquit me, and find the Doctor guilty of a great deal of injury toward me.
Indeed Mr. Hooker says, that it may well enough be granted in some sense, and
after a sort, that Christ is every where present as man, viz. in two respects;
but whether this were liable to exception, I meddle not, it is the (...) of the
respects which he mentions, that I question, and the words that I challenge,
the Reader may find page 141. of my (...). of the (...) of Christ thus sun med
up. Then for the great Hooker, whereas he says, That the conjunction of the
Manhood with Deity, is extended as far as Deity, that the Body of Christ is
joined unto Deity, wheresoever Deity is, that his Bodily substance has every
where a presence of true conjunction with Deity This also is easily refuted,
etc. Now this he affirms absolutely and simply without any limitation, and
not in a sort, or in some sense, and in two respects; and this any man that
has his eyes in his head may see, that will compare Mr. Hooker and me
together; and if any learned and impartial Reader will but make this
comparison, I shall be very well contented that he shall judge betwixt us, who
of us has most trespassed against practical Divinity, I in my charge of Mr.
Hooker, or the learned Doctor in his gross and undeniable falsification of my
said charge? But I shall in charity hope, that this falsification was but a
mistake, proceeding from his hasty and (...) zeal toward the memory of Mr.
Hooker: Whereas he is pleased to talk his pleasure of my pawning all my
Philosophy and fcholastical Divinity, I shall only humbly assume the boldness
to intimate thus much unto the Reader, that though I have no great store of
either, yet I hope I have enough to attend (that I may borrow the Doctors
phrase) the motions of him, and all other admirers of Mr. Hooker in the Defense
of the matter questioned: but if he shall decline all future further debate of
it, I shall with a great deal of probability conclude, that what Mr. Hooker
says is incapable of any tolerable vindication: for if he were defensible, Dr.
(...) is so able as that he could, and withal so zealous a lover and admirer
of him, as that he would continue the justification of him: Now from the
undefensiblenesse of Mr. Hooker in this one point, I shall only take occasion
to admonish his followers, that seeing he has erred in so weighty a point,
therefore he might err in matters of a far inferior nature, especially
seeing the times were such, as that they transported with prejudice many men,
that were unquestionably otherwise very learned and godly.

Dr. Hammond. sect. 62.
I have thus without any other obligation, than what my desire to undeceive the
Author and his Readers (...) upon me, paid him now this my second observance:
And may be allowed to think it time, that he who has been so liberal of his
uses of publickrefutation of others words, should find some vacancy for one use
of more private (if not (...), yet) examination of his own actions: And then I
shall offer to his consideration, how much more agreeable to the Laws of
brotherly kindness or (...) it has been, to have proposed his exceptions in
such a manner, or friendly address, as might have brought him home the same
satisfaction, and saved others the (...) of these useless, because personal
debates: When he has sincerely observed in himself the motive of his other
distant choice, I have obtained the end of my charity in mentioning it to him,
and have no more to return to him at this time.

Jeanes.
We poor ignorant men, that use the trite, but not illogical Method of Doctrine
and Use in Preaching, (...) usually first confirm our Doctrine, before we
infer any Uses therefrom. Now Sir, if you will be pleased first to prove,
that it is much more agreeable to the Laws of Brotherly kindness or candor,
to propose a man's exceptions against a printed Book in a way of private Letter
(for that I conceive is the manner of friendly address that you speak of)
than in a public way from the Press, especially when the said exceptions are
propounded, not for any personal satisfaction, but for the undeceiving of
others, unto which end the private way is no apportionare means; I shall then
proceed unto the use of, not only examination, but also reprehension of this
mine action; but in the mean while I shall (...) upon my justification, and
maintain that I am guiltless of any unbrotherly, uncandid, and disrespective
carriage toward you in the proposal of my objections, which was in as civil
and friendly a manner, I am confident, as ever you received any from any
Antagonist whatsoever.

Some Advertisements to the Reader.
I shall in a word acquaint thee with the relation and pertinency of these two
foregoing Debates unto the rest of the Book. The Letters have an apt connection
with the Tract of Original Righteousness. And the Reply unto Dr. Hammond may
be referred unto the Treatile concerning the (...) of humane actions; and
indeed it was the Doctors unjust charge of me, and Ames, with the denial of
things Indifferent, that occasioned that Treatise, These two pieces have layne
a long time by me (as can be attested by diverse Gentlemen, and Ministers, unto
whom they have long since been communicated) But I was persuaded by the
Bookseller to defer the publication of them, until a Second Part of the
Mixture of Scholastical and Practical Divinity was ready: And that had been
long since (...), if Sickness, with other private crosses, together with the
public troubles and distractions of the times, had not hundred: He has also
prevailed with me, to reserve for a (...) Part, all my future Replies, unto all
such as have, or shall write against me. Only I shall in part alter this
resolution touching the Namelesse Author of the Defense of (...) Hammonds
(...), not that I think it meritorious of any serious consideration; for it is
fraught, all along, with such reviling, boasting, and insulting language, as is
every way unsuitable unto the gravity of a Divine, the ingenuity of a Scholar,
the charity, meekness, and humility of a Christian: nay the morality of a man.
An ingenuous and good natured Pagan, would highly scorn to treat an Adversary
with such incivilities, as he does me. But because some, who are of the same
persuasion with the Author in other particulars, have triumphed, and insulted
in this his doughty work, as unanswerable; I shall therefore, as soon as that
which is now under my hands (viz. An Exposition upon the 7th. of the Romans) is
finished, address my self unto the examination thereof. I am so charitable as
to think, that Dr. Hammond has so much of Christianity, so much of a Minister,
of a Scholar, of a Gentleman in him, as not to accept, or approve of this
Thrasouical and Vainglorious Second. And if the Doctor disowne him, I might
pass him by with silence, and a just neglect. But if the Doctor shall judge,
that it is but justice, to chastise with (...), calumnies, and reproaches, so
contemptible a person, as my self, for daring to diffent from him, and to
represent the reasons of my said dissent, though in a calm and modest way: I
shall then appeal unto all the world how unagreeable this is unto that
humility and moderation, for which the Doctor is generally famed. To irritate
the Doctor against me, this Libeller tells him, that I have publicly bragged,
that I have made him a Dunce. But I profess, that this is a gross, and most
unworthy untruth; and he can bring no witnesses for it, but Knights of the
Post. With the like falsehood, disingenuity, and malice, he pretends, page 96.
etc. that I contumeliously undervalue the Doctors Critical Learning, and make
him to be but a petty Grammaticaster, etc. And hereupon he spends near five
pages, in an Apology for (...) in general, and the Doctor in particular. And
what I pray is the ground of this terrible accusation? Why ((...)) I said, I am
very loath to enter into a contest with so great a Critic, about the meaning
of a word. Hereupon he inferres, that I make the Doctor to be but a (...)
Grammarian; that I account a Critic but a (...), and a Grammarian, but an
empty Poedagogue: But that for these odious inferences there is no color, or
shadow in (...) words, will be quickly discerned by every Freshman. But such
loose sequels as (...), are very rife, and thick in his Book. And of this, I
do not doubt, but I shall shortly, make so perfect a discovery, as shall give
full satisfaction, touching the vast abilities of this our Mr. Thraso, unto all
impartial Readers, save such whose understandings reach no further than
Romances and Plays. His numerous Quotations out of the Schoolmen, have
induced some to admire him for his deep insight into Scholastical Divinity. But
(...) such his Admirers consider, (...) he be likely to be such a (...).
School-man, as they suppose him, who talks of the Author of Collegium
Complutense, as of a single person, page 30. and questions whether (...) quote
Aquinas only to refute him, as the latter School men (...) the former, page
341. whereas Capreolus was the professed Champion of Aquinas: And his Book on
the Sentences consists chiefly of collections out of (...); and hereupon he
is termed, Thomistarum princeps. Notwithstanding then this Gentleman makes such
frequent Musters of the Names of the Schoolmen, as if he were Nomenclator to
them, it is unto me very probable, that this is his first considerable voyage
that he ever made into them; and that now too he has traveled in them but by
the Index. Three great advantages this our Libeller (...) against me: First,
his Billings-gate Rhetoric, by which, it is (...) improbable, he hoped to tempt
me into such an outrageous fury, as his zeal for Doctor Hammond has
transported him with. But unto this I shall return nothing, but my pity and
prayers, that God would pardon, and heal this his distemper. The second is, the
concealment of his Name, for by this he hazards no (...); his pretense for it
is, that I might not run into personal (...). How liable he is to personal
(...), I know not: But let him be never so obnoxious, he may be secure, and
need not fear any such usage from me: For it is that which I shall studiously
decline in all contests whatsoever, though my Antagouist should be a Papist, a
Turk, a Pelagian, or a Socinian; for I know that personal invectives will
betray the best cause unto jealousies and suspicions. And besides, a man cannot
throw (...) and dung in another man's face, but some of it will slick to his
own fingers. A third artifice that he has, is the swelling of his Book into so
large a volume, as that may either wholly prevent, or much delay all
Replication. My Refutation was printed about three years since in 40. pages,
and his Defense is now come forth in 644. pages. Unto this tediousness I shall
apply what Bishop Hall speaks of his Popish Opponent; Should I follow him in
this proportion, He might expect an Answer in Tostatus hides, whose first words
should be, Quis legit haec? Or if my patience would delay my Reply to the just
paces of his Answer, this Volume of his would perhaps be vanished into Grocers
(...), for waste paper, in (...) piperisve (...), and would no more need (...),
than now it deserves one. Against this his voluminousnesse I shall make use of
this expedient; I shall consult some learned and judicious friends, and desire
them faithfully and impartially to select such passages as they think material,
and them only I shall examine. But I shall detain thee, Reader, no longer.
All that I have to desire further of thee, is thy patience, that thou will
suspend a while thy censure, until thou can hear what I can say for my self.

An Explication of a passage in the Treatise of Things (...), etc.
WHereas in the Treatise concerning the Indifferency of humane actions, page
54. as also in my Reply to Dr. (...) Vindication, etc. page 5. I laid down this
for a Rule out of some Schoolmen, viz. That (...) things privatively opposite
there is no medium, no middle, either of abnegation, or of participation, in
capable subjects; I find some to make a (...) concerning the latter, the
middle of participation; for such a medium (say they) is the dawning and
twilight betwixt light and darkness; to have one eye betwixt sight and
blindness; such a medium is a disposition unto a disease, betwixt health and
that disease. But this doubt would soon vanish, if men would heed the
limitations that are usually given of it.

The first is, that there is not such a medium of participation betwixt
privative opposites, as there is in (...), in contrary qualities; for here,
each of the extremes is positive and (...), vere ens, whereas in (...)
opposites, (...) of them is more non ens than ens.

A second you have in Scheibler in his Topics, c. 20. n. 72. having quoted a
saying out of Plutarch, that non datur (...), he refers, for limitation,
unto what he had said concerning the intension and remission of privation, n.
43, 44, 45. There he lays down this Canon, privatio (...) suscipit magis and
minus. Privations have no degrees, are not intended nor remitted. But this he
tells us is to be understood of not partial privations, such as those now
instanced in: for such are privations only secundum (...); but of total
privations, such as blindness, dumbness, deafness, death. These are
incapable of degrees, and so likewise there can be no mixture, or cohesion of
them. The same for substance we have in Aquinas, 1. 2ae q. 18. a. 8. ad (...).
Duplex est privatio, quaedam quae consistit in privatum esse: and haec nihil
(...), sed totum aufert: ut caecitas totaliter aufert (...), and tenebrae
lucem, and mors vitam; and inter hanc privationem, and habitum oppositum non
potest esse aliquod medium circa proprium susceptibile, Est autem alia (...),
quae (...) in privari, sicut aegritudo est privatio sanitatis, non quod tota
sanitas sit sublata, sed quod est quasi quaedam via ad totalem (...) sanitatis,
quae (...) mortem. Et ideo talis privatio, cum a (...) relinquat, non semper
est immediata cum opposite habitu. The sum and sense of this is, that
privations and their habits are immediately opposite, if we speak of privations
in facto esse, not in fieri. Now that Aquinas here speaks of medium
participationis, is the Comment of Gregory de Valentia, Tom. 2 dis. 2. q. 13.
punct 5. This advertisement I thought fit to insert, for the prevention of
unnecessary cavils: But yet I must confess, that medium participationis was
put into the rule ex abundanti, and contributes nothing to the matter in hand:
So that the Reader, if he please may leave it out; for the stresse of the
proof lies only upon this, viz. that betwixt things privatively opposite,
there is no medium of abnegation in capable subjects. And this is affirmed so
unanimously by all, as that I know not so much as one Dissentient.
