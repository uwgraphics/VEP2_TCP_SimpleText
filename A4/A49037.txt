Chiverton blazon or coat of arms Mayor.
Thursday the 4th of February 1657.
MY Lord Mayor and this Court of Aldermen taking into consideration the wants
and necessities of the honest and Laborious poor Inhabitants (especially of
the out Parishes) of this City; In this extreme hard and cold season, do
earnestly recommend it to the Ministers in their several Congregations within
this City and Liberties, on the next Lords day, to move their people to a
charitable Contribution toward their Relief and succor; And that the same
may succeed the more effectually, It is thought fit that the Churchwardens or
other Officers do the same day according to the usual manner after Sermon,
receive the Charity of such strangers as resort to their respective
Congregations; And that the Common-Councell-men throughout the said City and
Liberties, do on the day following Collect from house to house the benevolence
of all the able Inhabitants in their several Precincts; And further that the
whole Collection in every Parish and Precinct, be paid by the said
Common-Councell-men and Churchwardens respectively unto Mr Chamberlain at his
office in Guild Hall London, on Tuesday next the 9th of this instant February,
to be thence immediately issued, paid, and distributed, according to the
discretion and direction of the Justices of peace of the said City, to, and
amongst the several Parishes within the same City and Liberties, for relief of
their said poor, and proportionably to the number and necessities of them.

Sadler.
