The Fickle Northern Lass; OR, The Wronged Shepherds Resolution.
He thought himself the jolliest of the crew
Whilst that his love remained firm and true;
But she false Maid did prove to him d^sloyal,
And was not constant to abide the Trial:
Which made him to resolve thus in his mind,
Never to trust n^ more to women kind.
Tune of, There was in Lass in the North Country, etc.


There was a Lass in the North Country,
and she had lovers two or three,
But she unkindly dealt by one,
who had to her great favor shown:
Which made him thus for to complain,
I never will see love again:
For since that she has changed her mind,
I Will trust no more to women kind.
I gave her Ribbonds for to wear,
and now and then a pair of gloves,
But she unkindly dealt by me,
and gave them to her other loves;
But now in the Country will I hye,
And for to seek a new victory.
For since that she has changed her mind,
I Will trust no more to women kind.
Sometimes she vowed she did me love,
and I was apt for to believe,
But all her flattering words did prove,
no more then baits for to de^ieve:
As I do And it to my pain,
Therefore i will never believe again,
for since that she has changed her mind,
I Will trust no more to women kind.
As she was fair, had she been true,
I should a had no cause to sue:
But she was fickle in her mind,
subject to waver with the wind:
With each new face that she did see,
She presently in love would be.
And since that she has changed her mind,
I Will trust no more to women kind.


I Must confess that in my eye,
She was a Pearl, I valued high;
But what is beauty without grace,
Or one where virtue has no place;
Her false alluring smiles no more,
Shall draw my senses out of door.
For since that she has changed her mind,
I Will trust no more to women kind.
I gave her heart, I gave her hand,
And all I had at her command,
She could not ask what she would have,
But presently the same I gave;
Yet all my favors proved in vain,
For she would not require my pain;
Then since, etc.
When I did think her most secure,
Another did her mind allure;
And by some crafty wiles she went,
To undermine my sweet content;
So that I now repent the day,
That e're I cast my love away.
For since, etc.
But now my resolution's such,
To suffer for my loving much;
All women's company I Will shun,
For fear I further be undone;
And go where none has power to know,
The subject of my grief and woe:
for since, etc.
And in some dark and dismal place,
There will I build my self a Cave.
And in some low and barren ground,
Where none but Shepherds can be found,
I Will find a place for to be wait,
By sorrows which does me assail:
for since, etc.
Some shady desert I will choose,
Which other mortals all refuse,
And on the Trees her name I Will carve,
That does from me so ill deserve;
That future ages all may know,
What love to her I once did owe;
And since, etc.
The purling streams with me shall mourn,
And leaves relenting all shall turn,
The Wood-nimphs who my plaint do hear,
Shall new and then afford a tear;
All blaming her for cruelty,
That brought me to this misery.
And since, etc.
And when my time is drawing nigh,
I will prepare my self to dye;
The Robin Red breasts kind will be
Perhaps with leaves to cover me:
Then to the world I Will bid adieu,
And unto her that proved untrue.
For since that sshe did change her mind,
Young Men beware of women kind.
